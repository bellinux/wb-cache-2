5000|$|Pain-free {{swimming}} {{may require}} a <b>kickboard</b> or extra care to avoid hyperextending elbow and other joints.|$|E
5000|$|Kickboard: A <b>kickboard</b> is a {{foam board}} that {{swimmers}} use {{to support the}} weight of the upper body while they focus on kicking; helps build leg muscles. (Is usually used during practice) ...|$|E
50|$|There {{are some}} {{variations}} of kickboards {{from the traditional}} form with two hand grips. Some {{can be used as}} a <b>kickboard</b> and a pull buoy. These are often oddly shaped so they can be used for both of the training aspects.|$|E
25|$|<b>Kickboards</b> {{are used}} to keep the upper body afloat while exercising the lower body.|$|R
50|$|Often riders would skip {{across the}} surface of the splash pool on their <b>kickboards</b> in the same way a stone skips across a pond. Due to this, {{inflated}} inner tubes were secured to the south end of the splash pool to prevent an impact with the concrete. Also to help prevent this, the <b>kickboards</b> were molded with ridges on the bottom.|$|R
50|$|<b>Kickboards</b> {{are usually}} made from EVA foam. Some {{are made of}} more durable HDPE. The EVA foam boards can break easily and become very worn after long use.|$|R
50|$|All American Plunge, A speed slide {{that stood}} where the Big Kahuna is today. Guests rode special kickboards {{through a small}} gate and down this slide facing forwards. Guests could either sit atop the <b>kickboard</b> or lie atop it on their stomachs and ride the All American Plunge head first into the splash pool.|$|E
50|$|Pull buoy: Often used at {{the same}} time as hand paddles, pull buoys support swimmers' legs (and {{prevents}} them from kicking) while they focus on pulling. Pull buoys are made of foam so they float in the water. Swimmers hold them in between the thighs. They can also be used as a <b>kickboard</b> to make kicking a little harder.|$|E
50|$|But Ouboter {{had another}} idea: a {{three-wheeled}} Scooter, called the <b>Kickboard.</b> He {{teamed up with}} K2 and presented his idea at the International Sports Fair (ISPO) in Munich in 1998 very successfully. With the earned money he founded Micro Mobility Systems in 1999 and started producing the two-wheeled Scooter, which was an even bigger success. Because of the excessive demand, he allowed his partner in Taiwan to distribute the Scooter in the United States with the name Razor for a commission. After having sold about one million Scooters in 2000, the sales decreased rapidly in 2001.|$|E
50|$|Swimming boards (often {{referred}} to as <b>kickboards</b> or flutter boards) are a flotation aid used to develop a swimmer's kicking action. They {{can be used on}} all strokes but are primarily used on Freestyle, Butterfly stroke and Breaststroke.|$|R
50|$|For {{the first}} two years of this ride's existence, it was ridden without the kickboards...just laying on one's back. (Stomach riding was not allowed). After several {{injuries}} due to the way the people would hit the water, the <b>kickboards</b> were added for safety reasons.|$|R
50|$|Aquademics was {{a grass-roots}} nonprofit organization. As a result, the group {{obtained}} resources through several approaches and maintained its programs {{by relying on}} a combination of grants, business sponsorships, fund-raisers, annual giving and in-kind donations. Critical seed grants were awarded by the Ann Arbor Area Community Foundation and the Southeastern Michigan Community Foundation. Original corporate sponsors included two local banks. In-kind donations came from a range of sources, from swimming <b>kickboards</b> to donated coaching expertise. The programs, however, were not free. Each family contributed to the funding of camp and was assessed a participation fee every season.|$|R
5000|$|In some organs, {{a wooden}} panel called a [...] "kickboard" [...] or [...] "kneeboard" [...] is {{installed}} above the pedalboard, between the pedals {{and the lowest}} manual keyboard. Expression pedals, coupler controls and toe studs (to activate stops or stop combinations) may be located on or set into the <b>kickboard.</b> Expression pedals are used to open and close shades or shutters that enclose the pipes of a given division. Combination pistons are used to make rapid stop changes from the console on organs with electric stop action. Toe studs are pistons that can be operated by the feet which change either the pedal stops or the entire organ.|$|E
50|$|On spinet organs, the {{keyboards}} {{were typically}} {{at least an}} octave shorter than is normal for organs, with the upper manual (typically 44 notes, F3-C7 in Scientific Pitch Notation) omitting the bass, and the lower manual (typically F2-C6) omitting the treble. The manuals were usually offset, inviting but not requiring the new organist to dedicate the right hand to the upper manual and the left to the lower, rather than using both hands on a single manual. This seemed designed in part to encourage the pianist, who was accustomed to a single keyboard, {{to make use of}} both manuals. Stops on such instruments, relatively limited in number, were frequently named after orchestral instruments that they could, at best, only roughly approximate, and were often brightly colored (even more so than those of theatre organs). The spinet organ's loudspeakers, unlike the original Hammond models of the 1930s and 1940s, were housed within the main instrument (behind the <b>kickboard),</b> which saved even more space, although they produced a sound inferior to that of free-standing speakers.|$|E
50|$|The spinet organ's pedalboard {{normally}} spanned only {{a single}} octave, was often incapable of playing more than one note at a time, and was effectively playable only with the left foot (and on some models only with the left toes). These limitations, combined with the shortened manuals, made the spinet organ all but useless for performing or practicing classical organ music; {{but at the same}} time, it allowed the novice home organist to explore the challenge and flexibility of simultaneously playing three keyboards (two hands and one foot). The expression pedal was located to the right and either partly or fully recessed within the <b>kickboard,</b> thus conveniently reachable only with the right foot. This arrangement spawned a style of casual organist who would naturally rest the right foot on the expression pedal the entire time, unlike classically trained organists or performers on the earlier Hammonds. This position, in turn, instinctively encouraged pumping of the expression pedal while playing, especially if already accustomed to using a piano's sustain pedal to shape the music. Expressive pumping added a strong dynamic element to home organ music that much classical literature and hymnody lacked, and would help influence a new generation of popular keyboard artists.|$|E
50|$|Some {{treatment}} methods include; warming up slowly prior to training, avoiding strokes & positions that cause pain (butterfly/freestyle), fixing any bad technique {{that could be}} causing the pain, adjusting the distance and frequency of training to avoid further overuse of the muscles, discontinue the use of paddles, increase kick sets to allow the shoulder to rest however limit the use of <b>kickboards</b> and avoid pulling sets. Increase the use of fins to assist with maintaining a good body position and to avoid drag, avoid dry land upper body weight training, ice the shoulder daily, consider the use of anti-inflammatory creams and medicines and seek {{the advice of a}} medical professional.|$|R
40|$|Several {{researchers}} {{have established a}} link between the presence of house mouse (Mus domesticus) infestations and detrimental effects on human health. Controlling mouse infestations therefore requires methods that are quick, safe and effective. A tamper-resistant bait station with a wax block which is manufactured to fit within it so that it cannot be shaken out is considered the safest way to present the bait. However, some authors have expressed concern about the efficacy of this method. Research {{to examine the effects of}} bait stations on the feeding of mice infesting domestic dwellings was undertaken in the city of Manchester, UK. Working in conjunction with Manchester City Council, suitable sites were found. A balanced Latin Square experimental design was employed to overcome any operational biases that could have occurred. Non-toxic baits were presented in one of four ways: whole wheat in a cardboard box; whole wheat in a open tray; whole wheat in a tamper-resistant box; and a non-toxic wax block in a tamper-resistant box. Baits were placed in four different locations within dwellings and during the feeding trial; the bait stations were rotated, so that each bait type was presented in each location. The bait take from 12 dwellings within 3 housing blocks was recorded. Three-quarters of the bait consumed during the trial was taken from the cardboard box. No bait was taken from the tamper-resistant box containing the wax block. Risk assessments should drive the approach adopted in presenting rodenticide. Dwellings where vulnerable adults/children/pets are present may represent a risk of accidental poisoning may require a regime with tamper-resistant bait boxes containing wax blocks, to prevent baits being accessed. However, a balance between the safest and the most effective presentation of bait is needed and in areas where there is unlikely to be any access to baits (e. g. behind kitchen <b>kickboards),</b> use of alternatives must remain to ensure the shift resolution of infestations. Where bait can be placed safely and there are no children or pets present, cardboard boxes provide an effective means of ensuring that bait is consumed by the mice infesting domestic dwellings...|$|R
40|$|The {{present study}} was {{conducted}} to assess specific methods of teaching the "push off and gliding motion from a wall" for acquisition of posture conversion in the preparation phase. We compared teaching methods that employed a <b>kickboard</b> for developing the ability of posture to conversion autonomously, focusing on posture conversion until both legs reached the wall. We tested the effects of learning from a wide perspective, including gliding distance, biomechanical values, evaluation based on observation by a third party, the completeness of the motion, and subjective evaluation by the swimmer himself.  The subjects were 18 college students (6 men, 12 women) who majored in sports science and had signed a consent form. We divided them into 2 groups of 9 individuals with the same sex ratio, and with the same ability to achieve a given gliding distance. For one group, the instructor taught the "push off and gliding motion from a wall" to allow the students to acquire posture conversion autonomously (autonomous posture conversion (APC) group), and the other group was taught by the instructor (<b>kickboard</b> assistance (KA) group). We compared the 2 groups before and after the instructor 2 ̆ 7 s intervention, and assessed the value of each teaching method from multidimensional aspects, including gliding distance, biomechanical values (joint angle, grounding angle, velocity, time required), observation values (preparation phase, 4 parameters related to partial angle of preparation), and introspection value (4 questions).  In both groups, two-way ANOVA revealed significant main effects before and after the intervention, including gliding distance, velocity, and time required. In the APC group we also found significant interaction between the time required until both legs reached the wall after leaving the floor and until release after both legs had left the floor. After the intervention, more than 70...|$|E
