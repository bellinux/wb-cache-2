Our theoretical solution is the entourage party, which has the advantages of capturing both the specific character of Romanian political parties, {{as well as their}} functional formula, adapted to Romanian postcommunism...|$|R
5000|$|A {{mailroom}} (US) or post room (UK) is a room {{in which}} incoming and outgoing mail is processed and sorted. Mailrooms are commonly found in schools, offices, apartment buildings, and the <b>generic</b> <b>post</b> office. A person {{who works in a}} mailroom is known as a mailroom clerk or mailboy and the head person (sometimes the only person) is called the postmaster. The mailroom is responsible for a company's incoming and outgoing mail. A mailroom clerk prepares outgoing mail and packages prior to their being sent out via the post office or other carrier.|$|R

40|$|International audienceWith the {{emergence}} of Future Internet applications that connect web services, sensor-actuator networks and service feeds, scalability and heterogeneity support of interaction paradigms are of critical importance. Heterogeneous interactions can be abstractly represented by client-service, publish-subscribe and tuple space middleware connectors that are interconnected via bridging mechanisms providing interoperability among the services. In this paper, we {{make use of the}} eXtensible Service Bus (XSB), proposed in the CHOReOS project as the connector enabling interoperability among heterogeneous choreography participants. XSB models transactions among peers through <b>generic</b> <b>post</b> and get operations that represent peer behavior with varying time/space coupling. Nevertheless, the heterogeneous lease and timeout constraints of these operations severely affect latency and success rates of transactions. By precisely studying the related timing thresholds using timed automata models, we verify conditions for successful transactions with XSB connectors. Furthermore, we statistically analyze through simulations, the effect of varying lease and timeout periods to ensure higher probabilities of successful transactions. Simulation experiments are compared with experiments run on the XSB implementation testbed to evaluate the accuracy of results. This work can provide application developers with precise design time information when setting these timing thresholds in order to ensure accurate runtime behavior...|$|R

40|$|MBA - WBSChanges in the {{pharmaceutical}} industry {{as a result of}} recent changes to the legislation, aimed at the affordability and access of medicines to South Africans, together with the large number of innovative products losing patent, have resulted in an increasingly competitive generic pharmaceutical market. The objective of the research was to identify the factors that contributed to the successful launch of generic products in South Africa as well as the factors that were responsible for ensuring the growth of <b>generic</b> <b>post</b> launch. The research identifies that in order to be more competitive, the main factors that need to be taken into consideration include competitive pricing vs the innovator, being the first to market, having an aggressive sales and marketing campaign, as well as leveraging re-imbursement by healthcare funders and medical aid switching. The main factors found to contribute to the growth of the products following launch are stock availability and effective distribution, leveraging re-imbursement and relationships with funders, sales force enthusiasm and the price of the generic relative to the innovator. By taking these factors into consideration, the research has identified some of the most successfully launched generic products as Adco-Simvastatin, Prexum, Adco-Amoclav BD, Cilift, Adco-Zolpidem and Rolab-Zopiclone...|$|R
40|$|This study {{provides}} an overview of policy measures targeting pharmaceutical expenditure in Europe and analyses their impact on originator pharmaceutical prices. Panel data methods are used to examine the market of ACE Inhibitors in six European countries (Denmark, France, Germany, Netherlands, Sweden, United Kingdom) over period 1991 - 2006. We find that although some measures are effective in reducing originator prices, others appear to have an insignificant effect. Results suggest that supply side measures such as mandatory generic substitution, regressive pharmacy mark-ups and claw-backs are effective in reducing pharmaceuticals prices. Results are not as strong for demand side measures. Profit controls and the use of cost-effectiveness analysis appear to {{have a negative effect on}} prices, while results on reference pricing are inconclusive. Findings also indicate that, although originator prices are not immediately affected by generic entry, they may be influenced by changes in <b>generic</b> prices <b>post</b> patent expiry...|$|R
2500|$|Businesses {{can become}} {{compliant}} by learning upfront {{whether or not}} their products contain chemicals that match the current Proposition 65 list of 910 chemicals. Users can do this by searching in a Microsoft Excel chemical list or a website offering the search by chemical name or CAS Number. Product manufacturers may also learn if a chemical in their products has been removed from the Proposition 65 list, such as saccharin, removed December 2010. [...] Alternatively, they can <b>post</b> <b>generic</b> Prop 65 warnings just in case their products contain any listed chemicals.|$|R

Sophisticated spammers will copy posts from other areas of the site, giving the appearance of a valid, on-topic reply. The best clue that it is a spammer is that the links in the user profile are completely unrelated to the forum topic, and the posted messages, while seemingly within the general topic of the forum, will be non-sequiturs and out-of-place within the topic thread.

40|$|Aussie Post, the {{flagship}} of ocker Australiana, folded in January 2002. Post began {{life as the}} Australasian, a middlebrow magazine steeped in a nineteenth century civics of stable citizenship with a modicum of diversionary leisure. The transformation began when the Australasian became Australasian Post in 1946 under George Johnston's brief 15 -week editorship. Johnston's idealistic vision of Post as a voice of post-war Australian modernity was soon overtaken by commercial imperatives as Post's identity wavered between its civic antecedents and a new low-brow populism, a niche it had finally settled into by the mid- 1950 s. This tension between staid civics and risqué populism shaped the magazine's long evolution into its final realisation of the pictorial general interest genre. This paper, based on a close examination of the magazines themselves, tracks <b>Post's</b> <b>generic</b> evolution and focuses on the struggle to redefine the magazine’s identity during the post-war period when the axis of Australian identity was reluctantly shifting from the staid traditions of Rule Britannia to the flashy modernity of Pax Americana...|$|R
