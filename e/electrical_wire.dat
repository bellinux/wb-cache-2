5|$|In {{southern}} Florida, {{damage was}} mostly limited to moderate wind gusts; in Miami-Dade County, gusty winds knocked out several traffic lights along U.S. 1, the only route {{to and from}} the Florida Keys. A man died in Ft. Lauderdale when he stepped on a downed <b>electrical</b> <b>wire</b> and was electrocuted. Also, 100,000homes in Miami Dade County were without electric power.|$|E
5|$|Passenger staterooms {{have largely}} {{deteriorated}} {{because they were}} framed in perishable softwoods like teak and pine, leaving a warren of hanging <b>electrical</b> <b>wire,</b> light fixtures and debris interspersed with more durable items like brass bed frames, light fixtures, and marble-topped washstands. Woodwork with attachments like doorknobs, drawer-pulls or push-plates survive in better condition {{because of the small}} electric charge emitted by metal which repels fish and other harmful organisms. On the whole hardwoods like mahogany, the material for most stateroom furnishings, is more resistant to decay. Lavatories and bathrooms within the passenger quarters survive because they were framed in steel.|$|E
5|$|The Mummy is a 1911 American short silent film {{produced}} by the Thanhouser Company. The film details the story of Jack Thornton, a businessman, who {{is in love with}} Professor Dix's daughter. Jack purchases a mummy and plans to win his respect as an Egyptologist, but the mummy is reanimated in Jack's room by a live <b>electrical</b> <b>wire.</b> The mummy takes immediate interest in Jack, but is rejected and mummifies him. Before Professor Dix can cut up the now-mummified Jack, she returns and saves him. Jack explains everything and the film concludes with Professor Dix marrying the mummy.|$|E
50|$|<b>Electrical</b> <b>wiring</b> {{practices}} {{developed in}} parallel {{in many countries}} in the late 19th and early 20th centuries. As a result, national and regional variations developed and remain in effect. (see National <b>Electrical</b> Code, <b>electrical</b> <b>wiring,</b> <b>electrical</b> <b>wiring</b> in the United Kingdom). Some of these are retained for technical reasons, since the safety of wiring systems depends {{not only on the}} wiring code but also on the technical standards for wiring devices, materials, and equipment.|$|R

5|$|The major {{applications}} of copper are <b>electrical</b> <b>wire</b> (60%), roofing and plumbing (20%), and industrial machinery (15%). Copper is used mostly as a pure metal, but when greater hardness is required, it {{is put into}} such alloys as brass and bronze (5% of total use). For more than two centuries, copper paint has been used on boat hulls to control the growth of plants and shellfish. A {{small part of the}} copper supply is used for nutritional supplements and fungicides in agriculture. Machining of copper is possible, although alloys are preferred for good machinability in creating intricate parts.|$|E
5|$|Despite {{competition}} from other materials, copper remains the preferred electrical conductor in nearly all categories of electrical wiring except overhead electric power transmission where aluminium is often preferred. Copper wire is used in power generation, power transmission, power distribution, telecommunications, electronics circuitry, and countless types of electrical equipment. Electrical wiring {{is the most important}} market for the copper industry. This includes structural power wiring, power distribution cable, appliance wire, communications cable, automotive wire and cable, and magnet wire. Roughly half of all copper mined is used for <b>electrical</b> <b>wire</b> and cable conductors. Many electrical devices rely on copper wiring because of its multitude of inherent beneficial properties, such as its high electrical conductivity, tensile strength, ductility, creep (deformation) resistance, corrosion resistance, low thermal expansion, high thermal conductivity, ease of soldering, malleability, and ease of installation.|$|E
5|$|At around 11:00pm on 6 February 1965, about 300 Viet Cong {{soldiers}} of the 30th Company assembled at their positions outside Camp Holloway, where they began breaking through the wire fences. However, the Viet Cong's mission nearly turned into a disaster when their combat engineers accidentally tripped an <b>electrical</b> <b>wire</b> after breaking through the third fence barrier, but the U.S. Military Police patrolling the area did not detect it. At 1:50am on 7 February 1965, the Viet Cong attackers opened fire with their AK-47 rifles, having successfully penetrated Camp Holloway. Shortly afterwards, the Viet Cong mortared the airfield and the U.S. advisory compound, while the sections of the 30th Company attacked their respective targets with small arms fire. About five minutes later, the Viet Cong began retreating from the facility. Later that morning the Viet Cong claimed victory, having caused the death of eight U.S. soldiers, and another 126 wounded. In addition, ten aircraft were destroyed and 15 more were damaged.|$|E

25|$|This {{depended}} {{on the use of}} command-detonated mines which were triggered by hidden troops who held a detonating device connected to the demolitions by <b>electrical</b> <b>wire.</b> Mine ambush kill zones might also include punji traps or other homemade traps, land mines and natural obstacles. However, the ambush was always triggered by electrically detonating a mine, when enemy troops moved within the mines killing range.|$|E
40|$|<b>Electrical</b> <b>wiring</b> and cables, in {{many cases}} buried deep, in many systems and environments suffer damage. In some cases the damage only affects wire {{insulation}} and is not usually detected under normal operating conditions. This study discusses computer modelling of <b>electrical</b> <b>wires,</b> based on time-domain reflectometry using trains of successive pulses which were used {{in order to develop}} techniques and test procedures that would lead to identification of these types of faults. This study shows detailed simulations of defects in insulation of <b>electrical</b> <b>wires</b> and in cable shields, using dedicated electromagnetic modelling computation software. The results of simulations were compared with those obtained in experimental measurement for wires and cables of several metres in length. Comparison of the analysed measurement results for this novel technique shows clear indication of its relevance to flaw detection in <b>electrical</b> <b>wires,</b> guided through simulation...|$|R

25|$|Most often, {{magnetic}} wire {{is composed of}} fully annealed, electrolytically refined copper to allow closer winding when making electromagnetic coils. The wire is coated {{with a range of}} polymeric insulations, including varnish, rather than the thicker plastic or other types of insulation commonly used on <b>electrical</b> <b>wire.</b> High-purity oxygen-free copper grades are used for high-temperature applications in reducing atmospheres or in motors or generators cooled by hydrogen gas.|$|E
25|$|The {{printing}} telegraph is {{a derivative}} of the electrical telegraph which links two 28-key piano-style keyboards by <b>electrical</b> <b>wire</b> representing {{a letter of}} the alphabet and when pressed causing the corresponding letter to print at the receiving end. The receiver would then receive the instantly readable text of the message on a paper strip. This {{is in contrast to}} the electrical telegraphs that used Morse Code 'dots' and 'dashes' which needed to be converted into readable text. After 1850, the printing telegraph was in common use, namely along the United States east coast and in France. The printing telegraph was invented in 1846 by Royal Earl House of Rockland, Vermont.|$|E
25|$|In the Nevada example, {{crossovers}} {{were constructed}} where the lines ran {{in close proximity}} to allow reverse movements. This was necessary as at points the two tracks are several miles apart and some destinations can only be accessed from one of the lines. In other cases, where the shared lines already run in close proximity, the two companies may share facilities. In Conshohocken, Pennsylvania, where the former Reading Railroad and Pennsylvania Railroad shared lines, the lines even shared overhead <b>electrical</b> <b>wire</b> supports, for a 2-mile stretch on the northern bank of the Schuylkill River. Both lines eventually came under Conrail ownership in 1976, with the former PRR line being abandoned and now used as a hike/bike path.|$|E

500|$|While Amelia {{waits for}} the Doctor in the garden, the camera returns to her house where something, presumably Prisoner Zero, darts past the camera. It is {{actually}} Smith in footage intended for the finale, [...] "The Big Bang", but when it did not fit into that episode it was recycled here. Originally the scene where the Doctor confirms {{that he is the}} man she remembers by showing her the apple she gave him that day was cut due to pacing issues and that the fact had been established in a previous scene. The previous scene was then cut and the apple scene returned. Due to the rain, the scene where the Doctor tries to gain the Atraxi's attention with his sonic screwdriver had to be simplified. Adam Smith based the style of the confrontation on a Western film. The destruction of the sonic screwdriver shortly after was achieved with a spark effect concealed inside the screwdriver, activated by an electrical charge that reached the screwdriver by an <b>electrical</b> <b>wire</b> that ran up Smith's sleeve and connected to a receiver. Special effects head Danny Hargreaves then used a remote control to activate the device. Contrary to reports, the effect did not injure Smith. The [...] "fish fingers and custard" [...] scene was shot in 12 takes. The fish fingers were actually a breaded coconut-flavored food item; Smith estimated that he had eaten some 14 of them.|$|E
