40|$|Mixed {{conducting}} perovskite oxides {{and related}} structures serving as electrodes for electrochemical oxygen incorporation and evolution in solid oxide fuel and electrolysis cells, respectively, {{play a significant}} role in determining the cell efficiency and lifetime. Desired improvements in catalytic activity for rapid surface oxygen exchange, fast bulk transport (electronic and ionic), and thermo-chemo-mechanical stability of oxygen electrodes will require increased understanding of the impact of both bulk and surface chemistry on these properties. This review highlights selected work at the International Institute for Carbon-Neutral Energy Research (I 2 CNER), Kyushu University, set in the context of work in the broader community, aiming to characterize and understand relationships between bulk and surface composition and oxygen electrode performance. Insights into aspects of bulk point defect chemistry, electronic structure, crystal structure, and cation choice that <b>impact</b> <b>carrier</b> <b>concentrations</b> and mobilities, surface exchange kinetics, and chemical expansion coefficients are emerging. At the same time, an understanding of the relationship between bulk and surface chemistry is being developed that may assist design of electrodes with more robust surface chemistries, e. g., impurity tolerance or limited surface segregation. Ion scattering techniques (e. g., secondary ion mass spectrometry, SIMS, or low energy ion scattering spectroscopy, LEIS) with high surface sensitivity and increasing lateral resolution are proving useful for measuring surface exchange kinetics, diffusivity, and corresponding outer monolayer chemistry of electrodes exposed to typical operating conditions. Beyond consideration of chemical composition, the use of strain and/or a high density of active interfaces also show promise for enhancing performance...|$|E

Nanopowders of various compositions were compacted by three different methods: cold pressing/ annealing, hot pressing, and short term sintering. The products are compared with respect to microstructure and sample density. The thermoelectric properties were measured: thermal conductivity in the temperature range from 300 K to 800 K and electrical conductivity and Seebeck coefficient between 100 K and 800 K. The compacting method and the composition had a substantial <b>impact</b> on <b>carrier</b> <b>concentration</b> and mobility {{as well as on}} the thermoelectric parameters. Room temperature Hall measurements yielded <b>carrier</b> <b>concentrations</b> in the order of 1019 cm� 3, slightly increasing with increasing content of the additive silver bismuth telluride to the lead telluride base.

30|$|The {{electrical}} and Hall effect measurements reveal that all Zn 3 N 2 samples grown at different N 2 /Ar ratios have n-type conductivity. The <b>carrier</b> <b>concentration</b> {{of the films}} increases {{with the increase in}} N 2 flow rate during the deposition from ~ 1018 to 1021  cm− 3. A summary of the <b>carrier</b> <b>concentration</b> and Hall mobility of the grown samples is shown in Table 2. The highest Hall mobility and <b>carrier</b> <b>concentration</b> were found for the sample grown at N 2 /Ar ratio of 0.60. By further increasing the N 2 /Ar ratio, the <b>carrier</b> <b>concentration</b> slightly reduces but the Hall mobility is reduced 300 %. This indicates that N 2 /Ar ratio of 0.60 results in the optimum growth condition with the highest <b>carrier</b> <b>concentration</b> and Hall mobility. Higher N 2 /Ar gas flow rate ratio results in higher chamber pressure during the growth and that would reduce the mean free path of the sputtering species which in this case is zinc.

For Al-doped films annealed in Ar ambient, the <b>carrier</b> <b>concentrations</b> are still around 1019  cm− 3 after annealing. Then, the energy barrier height would be low and the mobility would increase {{with an increase in}} <b>carrier</b> <b>concentration</b> (Equations 4 and 5).

The <b>carrier</b> <b>concentration</b> of Al-doped films annealed in N 2 is lower than that annealed in Ar ambient. Otherwise, N 2 absorbed at grain boundaries would act as traps.
