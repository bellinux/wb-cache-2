Taking this into consideration, the study provides guidelines how to formulate a price strategy so that <b>information</b> <b>products</b> can be sold. In chapter one, concepts such as product, price and price strategy are described. The characteristics of products and services are used to describe <b>information</b> as a <b>product.</b> The marketing of <b>information</b> <b>products</b> is related to the pricing of <b>information</b> <b>products</b> and in chapter two the role of marketing and pricing of <b>information</b> <b>products</b> are described. Price as part of the marketing mix forms the highlight of this chapter. The methods of determing a pricing strategy are described in chapter three. Different authors' perceptions are taken into consideration with the emphasis on the work of G. H. G Lucas. Three scenarios forms the basis of chapter four. The scenarios are used to illustrate the formulation of different pricing strategies for different <b>information</b> <b>products.</b> The <b>information</b> <b>products</b> used as examples in these scenarios are a CD-ROM database, a training programme and a report on the involvement of mechanical engineers with the RDP project. The overriding purpose of this study is to provide guidelines to library and information services in determing a pricing strategy for <b>information</b> <b>products...</b>|$|R

Since the 2010 Haiti Earthquake, online volunteer communities have been activated to gather data and generate <b>information</b> <b>products</b> to improve humanitarian organizations' situational awareness and decision making. However, how {{and to what extent}} these <b>information</b> <b>products</b> influence the operations and organizational routines of the humanitarian organizations is a matter of considerable debate. In this paper we introduce an evaluation method to determine the impact of these new opportunities. Built on existing evaluation design principles for information systems, the resulting framework is used to identify the relevant impact factors in creating and using volunteer driven <b>information</b> <b>products.</b> Our results show that, despite the high response time and technical expertise, the organizational performance impact is inhibited by the limited embedding of volunteer driven <b>information</b> <b>products</b> in the organization. Using the presented evaluation tool the impact of other deployments can be determined and improved in a similar manner...|$|R
