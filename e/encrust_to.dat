40|$|Photographic {{samples were}} taken every 5 m along two 40 m transects on mostly rock face at Signy Island, Antarctica, during the austral winter of 1991. Dense and taxonomically rich {{communities}} of benthos occurred {{at most of}} the sublittoral study locations. These communities, however, varied significantly with substratum type, substratum profile and depth. Algae were generally the largest occupiers of space, but the area of substratum colonised by animal taxa increased whenever the profile approached vertical. Shallower than 15 m, disturbance effects, largely from ice, restricted community development to a high degree, but the frequency of disturbance at 25 m appeared to maintain high diversity by preventing domination of the assemblage by a few competitively superior taxa. Bryozoans, {{and to a lesser}} extent sponges, were the most abundant animal phyla. Among the bryozoans, species with an encrusting growth form occurred at the shallowest depths followed by encrusting massive/folaceous species and, at 40 m, the erect flexible forms. The ratio of <b>encrusting</b> <b>to</b> erect bryozoan species changed rapidly over the 0 to 50 m depth zone, from exclusively <b>encrusting</b> at 0 <b>to</b> 5 m to approaching 1 at 50 m. The erect bryozoans studied, from the shallow sublittoral to 290 m, could be classified as encrusting massive (foliaceous), erect flexible or erect rigid forms. There was some suggestion, despite the overlap between groups and considerable intra-group variation, that encrusting massive forms were abundant in the shallowest water, followed by erect flexible forms and then erect rigid forms with increasing depth. Some species which occurred as encrusting massive/foliaceous forms in deeper water occurred mostly in encrusting form only in shallow water (< 15 m) ...|$|R

40|$|Coralline {{red algae}} {{represent}} the main biogenic components in most shallow-water carbonate successions from the Eocene to the Recent. They {{contribute significantly to}} sediment production on open platforms. Carbonate sediments formed by unattached coralline algae include rhodolith pavements (RPs) which represent dense accumulations of rhodoliths, as well as maërl which is composed of rhodoliths, coralline algal branches and their detritus. Recent RPs sampled off Sesoko-jima (Okinawa-jima, southern Japan) occur at depths of 50 – 70 m on a submarine terrace. The taxonomic coralline composition is dominated by melobesioids associated with minor amounts of mastophoroids and sporolithaceans. The rhodoliths are characterised by various nuclei, an encrusting inner arrangement, <b>encrusting</b> <b>to</b> warty outer growth-forms and sub-spheroidal shapes. Bioerosion, encrustation and abrasion are the most prevalent taphonomic features. Possible fossil counterparts were identified in Chattian and Priabonian RPs from middle-ramp depositional systems from the Venetian area, north-east Italy. A direct comparison between Recent and fossil RPs is possible by contrasting the constituent rhodolith characteristics including taxonomic composition, nature of the nucleus, inner arrangement, outer growth-forms, size and shape as well as taphonomic signatures. This allows factors controlling rhodolith formation and growth in RPs to be compared especially with respect to hydrodynamic regimes and substrate type...|$|R

40|$|Fossil {{specimens}} of Heydrichia (?) poignantii, sp. nov.

A detailed morphological-anatomical account of the species is provided, and its placement in Heydrichia is discussed in relation to current classification proposals. Comparisons with the four other known species of the genus, all non-fossil, show that H. poignantii is the only known species of Heydrichia in which thalli are <b>encrusting</b> <b>to</b> sparsely warty to horizontally layered with overlapping lamellate branches that commonly appear variously curved or arched, and in which thalli have sporangial complexes that become buried in the thallus.

Current data also suggest that Heydrichia is more likely to have arrived in Brazil from Central Atlantic waters than from higher latitude South Atlantic waters. This implies that currently living species in southern Africa probably arose later from ancestors further equatorward in the South Atlantic, although confirming studies are needed. All non-fossil species of Heydrichia are known only from the southern hemisphere...|$|R

50|$|Cheilostomata (accepted name Cheilostomatida), {{an order}} of Bryozoa in the class Gymnolaemata, are {{exclusively}} marine, colonial invertebrate animals.

40|$|We {{assessed}} whether published observations ofthe {{ecology of}} encrusting coralline algae (Rhodophyta) from tropical and temperate coasts {{could be used}} to predict patterns and responses on a polar coast where such knowledge does not exist. On subtidal rocky coasts near Casey, East Antarctica, we detected a strong positive association of understorey encrusting coralline algae with canopies formed by the endemic alga Himantothallus grandifolius. The experimental removal of H. grandifolius caused corallines to bleach from red to pink/white concomitant with a decline in their photosynthetic activity. The magnitude of this decline (mean ± SE= 56. 85 ± 8. 43 %) was remarkably similar to that observedon temperate coasts (45. 98 ± 5. 91 %). Positive effects of nutrient enrichment of the surrounding water, hypothesized to alleviate the negative effects of canopy loss on encrusting corallines, were not detected. Removing H. grandifolius increased the intensity of photosynthetically active radiation and ultra-violet radiation reaching the substratum by three orders of magnitude, providing the basis for models invoking enhanced irradiance as the primary cause of the negative effects of canopy loss.

Sensors based on cellulose acetate/bromothymol blue were placed in the urine-collection bags, which were changed as usual at weekly intervals. The bacteriology was assessed and pH determined weekly on urine samples. Photographic records were made of the sensors twice weekly. On removal, each catheter was examined for encrustation and blockage. RESULTS Proteus mirabilis was not isolated from five patients and in these cases the sensor colour remained golden-yellow to brown. The catheters drained for the scheduled period and showed no signs of encrustation. By contrast, the sensors turned dark blue/black in the urine of all 15 patients infected with P. mirabilis. All these patients' catheters were encrusted and in 12 the catheters blocked. The mean interval between the sensor signalling and the catheter blocking was 12 days. CONCLUSION The cellulose acetate/bromothymol blue sensors placed in the urine collection bags are capable of signalling infection by P. mirabilis. They also signal the early stages of catheter encrustation and allow catheter replacement in ample time to avoid the clinical crises and emergency referrals caused by catheter blockage...|$|R
40|$|Encrusting algae can {{withstand}} being overgrown for relatively {{long periods of}} time. Knowledge of the mechanisms operating to reduce loss of biomass and of the temporal scales over which these are efficient is crucial for understanding competitive interactions occurring via overgrowth. In some red encrusting algae, the translocation of metabolites from unshaded to shaded parts of the thallus has been indicated as a possible mechanism for their resistance to overgrowth. This study tested {{the hypothesis that the}} efficacy of the connection between shaded and unshaded portions of the thallus in promoting the survival of the encrusting coralline alga Neogoniolithon brassica-florida, when overgrown, would vary according to the duration of the overgrowth. This hypothesis was tested experimentally by manipulating the availability of light and the connection between shaded and unshaded parts of the thalli. Although there was a slightly different response between experimental trials, the connection with unshaded parts enhanced the survival of shaded parts of the thallus, over a period of about 3 mo. In contrast, 8 mo after the start of the experiment, the percentage cover of living N. brassica-florida under artificial shading devices was small, irrespective of {{the presence or absence of}} a connection with unshaded parts of the thallus. These results support the model that translocation of nutrients across the thallus could enable <b>encrusting</b> algae <b>to</b> survive being overgrown, but not indefinitely.

I {{experimentally}} {{separated the}} positive and negative effects of light penetration and sedimentation on the assembly and maintenance of 3 subtidal habitats whose heterogeneity characterizes much of the world’s temperate coastline; encrusting (non-geniculate) coralline algae, articulated (geniculate) coralline algae and filamentous, turf-forming algae. The ability of <b>encrusting</b> corallines <b>to</b> monopolize and retain space without overgrowth depended on the presence of shade (positive effect) if sediment deposition was below that observed on coast characterized by high rates of sedimentation (negative effect). In contrast, the growth and persistence of articulated corallines depended on the absence of shade (negative effect) and high levels of sediment accumulation observed on human-dominated coast (positive effect). The recruitment of filamentous-turfs was facilitated by full light, but was not strongly affected by sedimentation. Instead, filamentous-turfs tolerated heavy sediment accumulation, a factor thought to explain the concomitant increase in spatial dominance of algal-turfs and loss of canopy-forming algae on reefs with heavy sedimentation. Importantly, different habitats will assemble or be maintained to match the environmental conditions in which they are most extensive, demonstrating the key role of physical factors associated with habitat- formers (kelp forests) and human-dominated coast (heavy sedimentation). These results also demonstrate that an appreciation of the integrated roles of physical processes may assist the development of predictive models about the assembly and maintenance of heterogeneity of natural communities, and their potential disruption by humans.

Climate models predict shifts in rainfall patterns that will exacerbate drought, with potentially devastating effects on freshwater ecosystems. Experimental approaches are now advocated to explore the impact of extreme events on natural systems: here, we synthesise research conducted in a stream mesocosms experiment to simulate the effect of prolonged drought on the structure and functioning of complex food webs in a 2 -year manipulation of flow regimes. Drought triggered the losses of species and trophic interactions, especially among rare predators, leading to the partial collapse of the food webs. Drying caused marked taxonomic and functional turnover in algal primary producers, from <b>encrusting</b> greens <b>to</b> diatoms, whereas {{the total number of}} algal taxa in the food webs remained unchanged. The recurrent drying disturbances generated transient macroinvertebrate communities dominated by relatively few, r-selected, species and compensatory dynamics sustained total macroinvertebrate densities. However, the standing biomass and secondary production of the food webs were more than halved by the droughts. Consumer-resource biomass flux was also strongly suppressed by disturbance, yet several network-level properties (such as connectance and interaction diversity) were conserved, driven by consumer-resource fidelity and a reconfiguration of fluxes within the webs, as production shifted down the size spectrum towards the smaller species. Our research demonstrates that flow extremes could have far-reaching consequences for the structure and functioning of complex freshwater communities...|$|R

In contrast, the relative timing of recruitment and the prevailing environmental conditions greatly affected recruit success. No species recruited at any time to the high shore, and species recruited as high as the mid shore only during cooler months. Species that recruited during the cooler months (e. g. Hapalospongidion gelatinosum and coralline crusts) could colonise the mid shore, while Ralfsia expanse, which recruited primarily during the hot season, was restricted to the low shore and subtidal. Recruitment also varied with substratum inclination; cool-season recruits were found in greater densities on horizontal surfaces, whereas hot-season recruits exhibited no difference between horizontal and vertical plates. Seasonal availability of free space may influence the life-history strategies of encrusting algae. R. expanse recruited during the hot season to the low shore, when free space was available following the annual die-back of algae. In contrast, cool-season recruits (e. g.

40|$|Fusion is an {{important}} life history strategy for clonal organisms to increase access to shared resources, to compete for space, and to recover from disturbance. For reef building corals, fragmentation and colony fusion are key components of resilience to disturbance. Observations of small fragments spreading tissue and fusing over artificial substrates prompted experiments aimed at further characterizing Atlantic and Pacific corals under various conditions. Small (∼ 1 – 3 cm 2) fragments from the same colony spaced regularly over ceramic tiles resulted in spreading at rapid rates (e. g., tens of square centimeters per month) followed by isogenic fusion. Using this strategy, we demonstrate growth, in terms of area encrusted and covered by living tissue, of Orbicella faveolata, Pseudodiploria clivosa, and Porites lobata as high as 63, 48, and 23 cm 2 per month respectively.

Rapid encrusters (Pr. mirabilis, Proteus vulgaris and Providencia rettgeri) were able to raise the urinary pH to 8 - 9 and cause catheter blockage within 37 h. Slow encrusters (Morganella morganii, Staphylococcus aureus and Staphylococcus saprophytics) were able to raise the urinary pH moderately (from 6. 1 to 6. 89 - 7. 39 over 96 h) and cause the formation of some encrustation on the catheters. Non- encrusters { Providencia stuartii, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Klebsiella oxytoca, Serratia marcescens, Enterobacter cloacae, Citrobacter freundii and Citrobacter koseri) were not able to raise the mean urinary pH above mean levels of 6. 45 and did not form crystalline biofilm. Pr. mirabilis, Pr. vulgaris and Pv. rettgeri were also capable of rapidly encrusting silver-hydrogel coated latex catheters (Bard I. C. catheter) and nitrofurazone impregnated silicone catheters (Rochester NF catheter). There were no significant differences between the times these organisms took to block these catheters compared to all-silicone control catheters. The antimicrobial catheters also had no effect on the urinary pH generated by these organisms. The insensitivity of the three <b>encrusting</b> species <b>to</b> nitrofurazone (MICs 32 - 128 ug/ml) is clearly a major factor in the failure of these catheters to prevent encrustation. The results of experiments in which the balloons of all-silicone catheters were inflated with solutions of triclosan (3 mg/ml in 0. 1 M sodium carbonate) confirmed previous observations that catheter encrustation by Pr. mirabilis was prevented by this strategy. It also proved effective against Pr. vulgaris. In both cases, in contrast to the controls, the numbers of viable cells recovered from the residual urine fell steeply within 24 h, the pH of the urine dropped below its nucleation pH (pH 6. 5) and the catheters drained freely for the seven day experimental period. The effect of triclosan on encrustation by Pv. rettgeri was minimal however, with no significant difference between blockage times or urinary pHs in the test and control models. While the Proteus sp. had MICs of triclosan of Pv. rettgeri was 64 ug/ml. Inflating catheter balloons with a solution which generated nitric oxide proved ineffective as a means of controlling catheter encrustation. Previous studies have shown that a simple cellulose acetate / bromothymol blue sensor is capable of signalling infection by Pr. mirabilis and the early stages of catheter encrustation. Placed in the drainage bag it can give early warnings to patients, carers and nurses that catheters need to be replaced. While the use of the sensor in this way could avoid the clinical crises induced by catheter blockage, it would be of more value if an effective strategy to inhibit encrustation could be deployed when the problem is signalled. In the present study it was demonstrated that strips of the sensor polymer placed in the drainage bags changed from yellow to blue signalling the rise in urinary pH induced by infection with Pr. mirabilis, Pr. vulgaris or Pv. rettgeri. Electron microscopy confirmed that encrustation had started on the catheters at the times the sensors turned blue. Triclosan (3 mg/ml) introduced into the catheter balloons when the signal was observed was found to halt the development of the Proteus crystalline biofilms. It was concluded that an integrated sensor / modulator strategy was feasible for the control of encrustation by these species. (Abstract shortened by UMI.).

40|$|Differences in {{bleaching}} susceptibility {{and mortality}} are apparent among coral species, {{and have been}} variously ascribed to differences in physiology and morphology, in particular overall growth form (e. g., branching versus massive corals). However, coral morphology is highly confounded with taxonomy, and no studies have tested for differences in bleaching susceptibility among corals with varying morphology within (rather than between) coral families. For this study, data were compiled for bleaching susceptibility and mortality from 65 published studies that monitored coral health throughout the bleaching event. Overall patterns of bleaching susceptibility were significantly different among coral growth forms, whereby a much higher proportion of branching, tabular, and submassive corals bleached compared <b>to</b> <b>encrusting,</b> massive, and free-living corals. However, differences in bleaching susceptibility and mortality were not consistent among growth forms within families. Branching faviid species (e. g., Echinopora) had much lower incidence of bleaching compared to massive species, but the reverse was true for Acroporidae and Poritidae. Moreover, mortality was markedly different amongst growth forms within families, such that massive Acroporidae (e. g. Montipora) suffered highest mortality when compared to Faviidae and Poritidae, but branching Acroporidae suffered lowest mortality compared to branching Faviidae and Poritidae. Our data suggest that generalities about the susceptibility of branching versus massive corals (and among other major growth forms) arise {{at least in part}} because certain growth forms are over-represented by highly susceptible coral taxa (e. g., Acropora) or perhaps because branching corals generally maintain higher dominance than massive corals...|$|R
