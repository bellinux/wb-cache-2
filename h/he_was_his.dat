5|$|Constantine {{was one of}} the {{youngest}} sons of Romanos I and his wife Theodora. Theophanes Continuatus mentions him as {{the youngest}} son of the imperial couple, while the 11th-century chronicler George Kedrenos mentions him as the third of four known sons. His older brothers were Christopher Lekapenos (co-emperor 921–931) and Stephen Lekapenos (co-emperor 924-945). It is unclear if Theophylact (Patriarch of Constantinople in 933–956) was his younger brother or slightly older than <b>he</b> <b>was.</b> <b>His</b> sisters included Helena, who married Constantine VII Porphyrogennetos (r. 913–959), and Agatha, who married Romanos Argyros. He probably also had at least two unnamed sisters, known only because of their marriages to the magistroi Romanos Mosele and Romanos Saronites.|$|E
5|$|Domnall Gerrlámhach (died 1135), {{also known}} as Domnall Gerrlámhach Ua Briain, Domnall mac Muirchertaig, and Domnall Ua Briain, was an obscure twelfth-century Uí Briain dynast and King of Dublin. He {{was one of two}} sons of Muirchertach Ua Briain, High King of Ireland. Domnall's father appears to have {{installed}} him as King of Dublin in the late eleventh- or early twelfth century, which suggests that <b>he</b> <b>was</b> <b>his</b> father's successor-designate. Although Domnall won a remarkable victory in the defence of the Kingdom of Dublin {{in the face of an}} invasion from the Kingdom of Leinster in 1115, he failed to achieve the successes of his father. After his final expulsion from Dublin at hands of Toirdelbach Ua Conchobair, King of Connacht, and the death of his father, Domnall disappears from record until his own death in 1135. He was perhaps survived by two sons.|$|E
5|$|Meanwhile, Perry the Platypus {{arrives at}} Dr. Heinz Doofenshmirtz's hideout, where he discovers Doofenshmirtz {{has gained a}} new nemesis {{in the form of}} Peter the Panda, whom he met in Seattle, Washington. Downtrodden, Perry reminisces about {{previous}} battles with Doofenshmirtz when <b>he</b> <b>was</b> <b>his</b> nemesis, while Doofenshmirtz himself grows tired of Peter due to him being much less sympathetic then Perry. Perry and Doofenshmirtz decide to appear on the talk show Dr. Feelbetter, where they decide to once more become nemeses; however, Doofenshmirtz reveals that the whole situation was merely a scheme to capture the world's top agents (who are in the audience) and freeze them with a large ray. This results in a largescale battle where the agents come out victorious.|$|E

5|$|The Countess {{was left}} rich under Leicester's will; yet the {{discharge}} of his overwhelming debts diminished her wealth. In 1604–1605 she successfully defended her widow's rights in court when her possessions and her good name were threatened by the Earl's illegitimate son, Robert Dudley, who claimed that <b>he</b> <b>was</b> <b>his</b> father's legitimate heir, thus implicitly declaring her marriage bigamous. Lettice Knollys was always close to her large family circle. Helpless at the political eclipse of her eldest son, the second Earl of Essex, she lost both him and her third husband to the executioner in 1601. From the 1590s she lived chiefly in the Staffordshire countryside, where, in reasonably good health until the end, she died at age 91 on Christmas Day 1634.|$|E
5|$|The next morning, Ms. Edmunds (Zooey Deschanel), Jess' music teacher, {{calls to}} invite {{him on a}} {{one-on-one}} field trip to an art museum. Jess tries to ask his mother's permission; however, she is half-asleep and he takes her mumbling as approval. Jess doesn't ask Leslie to accompany him, and merely looks at her house as they drive by. When he returns home, Jess finds that {{his father and mother}} were worried sick since they didn't know where <b>he</b> <b>was.</b> <b>His</b> father reveals to Jess that Leslie had died that morning while trying to swing across the rain-swollen creek, an allegory for the devastating effects of cheating. Jess, being traumatized by this shocking news, first denies it, then runs out of his house to check on Leslie, but he discovers the emergency vehicles surrounding her house, and {{has no choice but to}} accept Leslie's death.|$|E

25|$|An {{unfinished}} religious manifesto, De doctrina christiana, probably {{written by}} Milton, lays out {{many of his}} heterodox theological views, and was not discovered and published until 1823. Milton's key beliefs were idiosyncratic, not those of an identifiable group or faction, and often they go well beyond the orthodoxy of the time. Their tone, however, stemmed from the Puritan emphasis on the centrality and inviolability of conscience. <b>He</b> <b>was</b> <b>his</b> own man, but he was anticipated by Henry Robinson in Areopagitica.|$|E
25|$|He studied {{mathematics}} and {{physics at the}} University of Hong Kong.

However, he had only studied at Princeton University for three weeks before dropping out, saying that he wanted to get a job instead of studying theories.|$|E
