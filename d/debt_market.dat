40|$|The he {{financial}} crisis {{that began in}} 2007 is especially a crisis in <b>debt</b> <b>markets.</b> For example, the stock market peaked in October 2007 with the Dow Jones Industrial Average near 14, 000 and was still near 12, 000 in August 2008. While the Dow Jones eventually fell to 6, 600 by March 2009, most of that fall hap-pened in late 2008. However, problems in <b>debt</b> <b>markets</b> like the mortgage-backed securities market had been in full swing since August of 2007. A full understanding {{of what happened in}} the {{financial crisis}} requires inquiring into the plumbing of <b>debt</b> <b>markets.</b> Trades in <b>debt</b> <b>markets</b> are predominantly made by financial institutions—like banks, hedge funds, and insurance companies—rather than households. One key feature of <b>markets</b> in <b>debt</b> instruments is that whenever a trader wishes to make an investment, it must first raise money, either through a sale of existing financial assets or by borrowing funds from another party. If funds can be raised fairly easily and quickly, <b>debt</b> <b>markets</b> should function fairly smoothly. But during a financial crisis, funds often cannot be raised easily or quickly. In such a setting, the fun-damental values for certain assets can become separated for a time from market prices, with consequences that can echo into the real economy. This article will explain in concrete ways how <b>debt</b> <b>markets</b> can malfunction, with deleterious consequences for the real economy. I begin with a quick overview of <b>debt</b> <b>markets.</b> I then discuss three areas that are crucial in all <b>debt</b> <b>markets</b> deci-sions: risk capital and risk aversion, repo financing and haircuts, and counterpart...|$|R
40|$|The {{development}} of the <b>debt</b> <b>markets</b> in Singapore {{has been one of}} the key components of the Monetary Authority of Singapore’s attempts to enhance Singapore’s role as an international financial centre. The <b>debt</b> <b>markets</b> in Singapore are made up of three major segments: the Singapore government securities (SGS) market, the Asian dollar bond market, and the Singapore dollar corporate bond market. Despite the fact that the government has run budget surpluses since the 1980 s and maintains huge reserves, the government securities market remains the biggest segment of the <b>debt</b> <b>markets</b> in Singapore. This paper describes the growth and structure of <b>debt</b> <b>markets</b> in Singapore and examines the factors that have hindered the {{development of}} these two markets. It also discusses the measures taken by the Monetary Authority to promote these markets and the challenges that lie ahead. Finally, it outlines the lessons from the Singapore experience.

This article will explain in concrete ways how <b>debt</b> <b>markets</b> can malfunction, with deleterious consequences for the real economy. After a quick overview of <b>debt</b> <b>markets,</b> I discuss three areas that are crucial in all <b>debt</b> <b>markets</b> decisions: risk capital and risk aversion; repo financing and haircuts; and counterparty risk.
