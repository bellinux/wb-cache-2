5|$|In sharp {{contrast}} to the mostly mild weather in the first few weeks of winter, the <b>eastern</b> <b>half</b> <b>of</b> the continent was under the influence of cold temperatures. Numerous areas had substantial snowfall deficits before this storm. After several weak Alberta clippers crossed the <b>eastern</b> <b>half</b> <b>of</b> the continent and brought occasional light snowfalls, a large dip in the Northern branch of the jet stream favored a more active pattern, which, as it connected with the southern branch, {{led to the development of}} the storm.|$|E

50|$|Built in 1982, the A12 Colchester bypass {{provides}} an uninterrupted dual carriageway where the national speed limit of 70 mph applies.

Jaywick has significant problems with unemployment and is at risk of flooding, despite several attempts by the local council and government to transform the area.|$|E
5|$|From the {{beginning}} of Australia's colonial period until after the Second World War, people from the United Kingdom made up {{a large majority of}} people coming to Australia, meaning that many people born in Australia can trace their origins to Britain. The colony of New South Wales, founded on 26 January 1788, was part of the <b>eastern</b> <b>half</b> <b>of</b> Australia claimed by the Kingdom of Great Britain in 1770, and initially settled by Britons through penal transportation. Together with another five largely self-governing Crown Colonies, the federation of Australia was achieved on 1 January 1901.|$|E

5|$|Kona lows, most extra{{tropical}} cyclones, {{and tropical}} upper tropospheric cyclones are cold core lows. In the <b>eastern</b> <b>half</b> <b>of</b> the north Pacific ocean and north Indian ocean, {{the formation of}} a weak circulation underneath a mid to upper-tropospheric low which has cut off from the main belt of the westerlies during the cold season (winter) is called a subtropical cyclone. In the case of the north Indian ocean, the formation of this type of vortex leads to the onset of monsoon rains during the wet season.|$|E

In addition to that 12% of all immigrants were from Asia, mainly Yemen and Iraq. From the rest of Europe and America {{there were only a}} few immigrants. Due to the 10,000 immigrants who left the Land of Israel during those years, the contribution of the immigrants who stayed in the Jewish settlement in those years was very important and decisive.|$|R
