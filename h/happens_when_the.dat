5|$|An early theory, the Meyer-Overton hypothesis, {{suggested}} that narcosis <b>happens</b> <b>when</b> <b>the</b> gas penetrates the lipids of the brain's nerve cells, causing direct mechanical {{interference with the}} {{transmission of signals from}} one nerve cell to another. More recently, specific types of chemically gated receptors in nerve cells have been identified as being involved with anesthesia and narcosis. However, the basic and most general underlying idea, that nerve transmission is altered in many diffuse areas of the brain as a result of gas molecules dissolved in the nerve cells' fatty membranes, remains largely unchallenged.|$|E
5|$|Eggs {{are almost}} {{invariably}} laid on plants. Each species of butterfly {{has its own}} host plant range and while some species of butterfly are restricted to just one species of plant, others use a range of plant species, often including members of a common family. In some species, such as the great spangled fritillary, the eggs are deposited close to {{but not on the}} food plant. This most likely <b>happens</b> <b>when</b> <b>the</b> egg overwinters before hatching and where the host plant loses its leaves in winter, as do violets in this example.|$|E
5|$|In {{order for}} the flow to be well defined, the given curve must be {{sufficiently}} smooth {{that it has a}} continuous curvature. However, once the flow starts, the curve becomes analytic, and remains so until reaching a singularity at which the curvature blows up. For a smooth curve without crossings, the only possible singularity <b>happens</b> <b>when</b> <b>the</b> curve collapses to a point, but immersed curves can have other types of singularity.|$|E

5|$|The {{arterial}} partial {{pressures of}} oxygen {{and carbon dioxide}} in the arterial blood are homeostatically controlled. A rise in the arterial partial pressure of carbon dioxide, and, to a lesser extent, a fall in the arterial partial pressure of oxygen, will reflexly cause deeper and faster breathing till the blood gas tensions return to normal. The converse <b>happens</b> <b>when</b> <b>the</b> carbon dioxide tension falls, or, again to a lesser extent, the oxygen tension rises: the rate and depth of breathing are reduced till blood gas normality is restored.|$|E
5|$|Einstein {{returned}} {{to the problem of}} thermodynamic fluctuations, giving a treatment of the density variations in a fluid at its critical point. Ordinarily the density fluctuations are controlled by the second derivative of the free energy with respect to the density. At the critical point, this derivative is zero, leading to large fluctuations. The effect of density fluctuations is that light of all wavelengths is scattered, making the fluid look milky white. Einstein relates this to Rayleigh scattering, which is what <b>happens</b> <b>when</b> <b>the</b> fluctuation size is much smaller than the wavelength, and which explains why the sky is blue. Einstein quantitatively derived critical opalescence from a treatment of density fluctuations, and demonstrated how both the effect and Rayleigh scattering originate from the atomistic constitution of matter.|$|E

25|$|Under some circumstances, {{perturbation}} theory is an invalid approach to take. This <b>happens</b> <b>when</b> <b>the</b> system {{we wish to}} describe cannot be described by a small perturbation imposed on some simple system. In quantum chromodynamics, for instance, the interaction of quarks with the gluon field cannot be treated perturbatively at low energies because the coupling constant (the expansion parameter) becomes too large.|$|E

25|$|An eclipse cycle {{takes place}} when eclipses {{in a series}} are {{separated}} by a certain interval of time.

A particular instance is the saros, which results in a repetition of a solar or lunar eclipse every 6,585.3days, or a little over 18 years.

25|$|Counter attackers are any attacking {{player that}} uses their pace to beat {{defenders}} and cause unexpected scoring opportunities at any time. They also need {{some degree of}} shooting skill. Counter attacking opportunities occur when the opposition are themselves attacking a team with most of their players forward. A counterattack <b>happens</b> <b>when</b> <b>the</b> ball is won back and is quickly played into space for a counterattacking player to run onto or where a player takes the ball themselves and runs with pace into a sparsely defended opposition half.|$|E
