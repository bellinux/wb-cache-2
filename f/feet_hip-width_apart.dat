50|$|Overhead squat - a non-weight bearing {{variation}} of the squat exercise, with the hands facing each other overhead, biceps aligned with the ears, and <b>feet</b> <b>hip-width</b> <b>apart.</b> This exercise is a predictor of total-body flexibility, mobility, and possible lower body dysfunction.|$|E
50|$|The {{individual}} {{stands with}} their <b>feet</b> <b>hip-width</b> <b>apart.</b> The leg is lifted {{to the side}} in a slow, controlled manner until it forms a 45-degree angle with the stationary leg. The leg is {{then returned to the}} starting position and the exercise performed on the other side. One hand may be rested on a chair or other stable surface for support.|$|E
50|$|The first {{position}} when performing the hang clean is {{to assume the}} hang, or hinge, position. Rather than placing the barbell on the ground, the weightlifter starts with <b>feet</b> <b>hip-width</b> <b>apart,</b> bent at the hips with the barbell hanging just above the knees held in an overhand grip, close to the legs with the chest over the bar. The knees should be slightly bent and not locked. The weightlifter should maintain a flat back and keep the head up.|$|E
50|$|On a deep exhale, {{the hips}} are pushed toward the ceiling, the body forming an {{inverted}} V-shape. The back is straight {{with the front}} ribs tucked in. The legs are straight with the heels reaching to the floor. The hands are open like starfish, keeping the forefinger and thumb pressing down on the floor/mat. The arms are straight, with the inner elbows turning towards the ceiling. If one has the tendency to hyper extend elbows, keeping a microbend to the elbows prevents taking the weight in the joints. Turning the elbows up towards the ceiling will engage the triceps and build strength. The shoulders are wide and relaxed. Line up the ears with the inner arms which keeps the neck lengthened. The hands are shoulder width <b>apart</b> and <b>feet</b> remain <b>hip-width</b> <b>apart.</b> If the hamstrings are very strong or tight, the knees are bent to allow the spine to lengthen fully. The navel is drawn in towards the spine, keeping the core engaged.|$|R
40|$|Objective: To {{investigate}} whether a sensorimotor deficit {{of the upper}} limb following a brachial plexus injury (BPI) affects the upright balance. Design: Eleven patients with a unilateral BPI and 11 healthy subjects were recruited. The balance assessment includes the Berg Balance Scale (BBS), the number of feet touches on the ground while performing a 60 s single-leg stance and posturographic assessment (eyes open and <b>feet</b> placed <b>hip-width</b> <b>apart</b> during a single 60 s trial). The body weight distribution (BWD) between the legs was estimated {{from the center of}} pressure (COP) lateral position. The COP variability was quantified in the anterior-posterior and lateral directions. Results: BPI patients presented lower BBS scores (p= 0. 048) and a higher frequency of feet touches during the single-leg stance (p= 0. 042) compared with those of the healthy subjects. An asymmetric BWD toward the side opposite the affected arm was showed by 73 % of BPI patients. Finally, higher COP variability was observed in BPI patients compared with healthy subjects for anterior-posterior (p= 0. 020), but not for lateral direction (p= 0. 818). Conclusions: This study demonstrates that upper limb sensorimotor deficits following BPI affect body balance, serving as a warning for the clinical community about the need to prevent and treat the secondary outcomes of this condition...|$|R
50|$|The asana is a squat with heels flat on {{the floor}} and <b>hip-width</b> <b>apart</b> (or {{slightly}} wider if necessary), toes pointing out on a diagonal. The torso is brought forward between the thighs, elbows are braced against the inside of the knees, and the hands press together in front of the chest in Añjali Mudrā.|$|R
40|$|Abstract. [Purpose]	 The	aim	of	this	study	was	to	access	the	flexibility	of	the	spine	in	women	practicing	yoga	as	a part of	the	“University	for	Health ”	 project. [Subjects	and	Methods]	 The	study	included	 56 	women	ranging	in	age	be-tween 50 – 79 	and	attending	 90 	minutes	hatha	yoga	sessions	once	a	week. The	measurements	were	performed	twice-at the	beginning	of	the	project	and	after	its	completion,	 i. e.,	 after	 20 	weeks	of	classes. The	range	of	spine	mobility in three	planes	was	{{measured}}	using	a	Rippstein	plurimeter. The	range	of	motion	in	the	sagittal	and	frontal	planes was measured	in	a	standing	position	with	the	<b>feet</b>	<b>hip-width</b>	<b>apart.</b> The	torsional	range	of	motion	of	the	subjects	was measured with	the	trunk	bent	at	a	right	angle	and	the	legs	apart. The	flexibility	ranges	of	the	spine	and	hamstrings were also	measured	by	the	toe-touch	test	in	a	standing	position. [Results]	 This	study	showed	that	the	applied	yoga exercises increased	spinal	mobility	and	flexibility	of	the	hamstring	muscles	regardless	of	age. [Conclusion]	 Yoga exercises should	be	recommended	to	the	elderly	to	make	their	muscles	more	flexible	and	to	increase	the	range	of motion in	the	joints,	 which	is	particularly	important	for	improving	their	life	quality...|$|E
40|$|Abstract Background Torso-based vibrotactile {{feedback}} may {{significantly reduce}} postural sway in balance-compromised adults during quiet standing or {{in response to}} perturbations. However, natural non-volitional postural responses to vibrotactile stimulation applied to the torso remain unknown. Methods The primary goal {{of this study was}} to determine, for two types of actuators (tactors) and in the absence of instruction, whether vibrotactile stimulation induces a directional postural shift as a function of stimulation location. Eleven healthy young adults (20 – 29  years old) were asked to maintain an upright erect posture with <b>feet</b> <b>hip-width</b> <b>apart</b> and eyes closed. Two types of tactors, Tactaid and C 2, which differ in design and stimulation strength, were placed on the skin over the right and left external oblique, internal oblique, and erector spinae muscles in a horizontal plane corresponding approximately to the L 4 /L 5 level. Each tactor of the same type was activated twice randomly for each individual location and twice simultaneously for all locations at a frequency of 250  Hz for a period of 5  s. Results Vibration applied over the internal oblique and erector spinae muscle locations induced a postural shift in the direction of the stimulation regardless of the tactor type. For the aforementioned four locations, the root-mean-square (RMS) and power spectral density (PSD) of the body sway in both the A/P and M/L directions were also significantly greater during the vibration than before or after, and were greater for the C 2 tactors than for the Tactaid tactors. However, simultaneous activation of all tactors or those over the external oblique muscle locations did not produce significant postural responses regardless of the tactor type. Conclusion The results suggest that the use of a torso-based vibrotactile sensory augmentation display should carefully consider the tactor type as well as the instruction of corrective movements. Attractive instructional cues (“move in the direction of the vibration”) are compatible with the observed non-volitional response to stimulation and may facilitate postural adjustments during vibrotactile biofeedback balance applications...|$|E
50|$|It {{is good to}} {{approach}} the ball at around 30 degrees. Turn the foot {{you are going to}} make the pass with outwards and lock the ankle so it is strong on contact with the ball. Bend the knee of your passing leg slightly so the foot is in the correct position to pass. With your standing <b>foot</b> about <b>hip-width</b> away from the ball, bring your kicking foot through and strike the middle of the ball with the inside of your foot. The aim of a short pass is generally to keep the ball low, thus making it easier for a teammate to control.|$|R
