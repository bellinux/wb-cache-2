25|$|Fassbinder's second film, Katzelmacher (1969), (Bavarian pejorative slang {{term for}} a foreign worker from the Mediterranean), was {{received}} more positively, garnering five prizes after its debut at Mannheim.

The arrival of Jorgos, a <b>guest</b> <b>worker</b> from Greece, leads to a growing curiosity {{on the part of the}} women and the antagonism among the men living in a suburban block of apartments in Munich. This kind of social criticism, featuring alienated characters unable to escape the forces of oppression, is a constant throughout Fassbinder's oeuvre. Katzelmacher was adapted from Fassbinder's first produced play – a short piece that was expanded from forty minutes to feature length, moving the action from a country village to Munich and delaying the appearance of Jorgos.|$|E

40|$|Abstract: This study {{examines}} {{the impact of}} <b>Guest</b> <b>Workers</b> on economic growth in Jordan for the period 1980 - 2012 using the Fully Modified Ordinary Least Square (FMOLS) approach. The economic model incorporates the Cobb-Douglas Production function where the real GDP represents the dependent variable whereas capital (K), domestic labor (LD), and <b>Guest</b> <b>Workers</b> (LG) are the independent variables. The results of the unit root and the co-integration tests revealed that all variables are integrated of order one, I (1) and cointegrated indicating {{the existence of a}} long-run equilibrium relationship among variables included in the model and hence, the FMOLS can be used to estimate the economic model. The empirical findings showed that real capital and Domestic labor variables have positive and significant impacts on economic growth, while <b>Guest</b> <b>workers</b> variable has positive but insignificant impact on economic growth. The result {{can be explained by the}} fact that <b>Guest</b> <b>workers</b> are characterised as unskilled labor working mostly in the agriculture sector...|$|R

The bill aroused furious grassroots opposition among talk radio listeners and others as an [...] "amnesty" [...] program, and despite Kennedy's last-minute attempts to salvage it, failed a cloture vote in the Senate.

500|$|Nearly 8million {{immigrants}} {{came to the}} United States from 2000 to 2005, {{more than}} in any other five-year period in the nation's history. Almost half entered illegally. In 2006, Bush urged Congress to allow more than 12million illegal immigrants to work in the United States with the creation of a [...] "temporary guest-worker program". Bush also urged Congress to provide additional funds for border security and committed to deploying 6,000 National Guard troops to the Mexico–United States border. From May to June 2007, Bush strongly supported the Comprehensive Immigration Reform Act of 2007, which was written by a bipartisan group of Senators with the active participation of the Bush administration. The bill envisioned a legalization program for illegal immigrants, with an eventual path to citizenship; establishing a <b>guest</b> <b>worker</b> program; a series of border and work site enforcement measures; a reform of the green card application process and the introduction of a point-based [...] "merit" [...] system for green cards; elimination of [...] "chain migration" [...] and of the Diversity Immigrant Visa; and other measures. Bush argued that the lack of legal status denies the protections of U.S. laws to millions of people who face dangers of poverty and exploitation, and penalizes employers despite a demand for immigrant labor. Bush contended that the proposed bill did not amount to amnesty.|$|E
