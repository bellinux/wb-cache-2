40|$|A {{multipurpose}} {{anechoic chamber}} that operates over {{a very wide}} frequency range from 30 MHz through 18 GHz has been designed and constructed at the Faculty of Engineering of Multimedia University. An innovative design technique has been developed, giving rise {{to the construction of}} an asymmetrical-shaped anechoic chamber which fulfils the different requirements for various measurement needs using lower cost materials. The facility can be used for EMC tests, antenna measurements, monostatic and bistatic RCS measurements, RF transceiver testing, calibration of scatterometer, and other electromagnetic research experiments. It is suitable for both industrial use and basic research. Abeam-tracing technique has been used to develop a model for calculation of wave propagation in the anechoic chamber. The major advantage of beam-tracing over ray-tracing is the path loss information for multiple receiver locations can be determined simultaneously as opposed to running a ray tracing simulation for each receiver location one at a time. As a result, the computing time is greatly reduced. The computer program simulates an impulse transmitted from a dipole antenna and propagating in all directions in the form of polygon-shaped beams. The possible paths for the beams to reach the receivers are recorded. Instead of calculating the field strengths for a large number of discrete frequency points, the received impulses resulting from various multipath propagation are combined to give a time-domain impulse response. A Fast Fourier Transform (FFT) is performed to obtain the desired electric field in frequency domain for frequency range 30 - 1000 MHz. The asymmetrical chamber geometry has been optimised, taking into account the limited physical space, to achieve the extremely wide operating frequency range with low cost absorbing material. Combination of pyramid and wedge-shaped RF absorbers is used for lining of the chamber walls and ceiling to exploit the advantages of the different absorber shapes. The modelling method has been used to predict the site attenuation prior to the chamber construction. Ease of construction and ease of lining the absorber material on the chamber surfaces are preserved in the design. Constructability of the design allows for all seams to be properly welded. Reasonably <b>high</b> <b>shielding</b> <b>effectiveness</b> has been achieved. Space efficiency of the design allows for two additional screened rooms to be constructed next to the anechoic chamber: one is used as the control room to house the test and measurement equipment; and other is used for conducting certain RF measurements. The low-frequency applications of the anechoic chamber are for EMC test. The required site validation criterion of EN 50147 - 2 and ANSI c 63. 4 for radiated emission measurements is met for frequencies 30 - 1000 MHz. The field uniformity requirements of EN 61000 - 4 - 3 standard are also achieved. Thus the anechoic chamber can be used to perform radiated RF immunity test on electronic products. The quietness of the anechoic chamber is adequate for antenna measurements. Field probe measurements have been made across the quiet zone in the vertical and horizontal transverse directions, for both vertical and horizontal polarisations. The peak-to-peak interference amplitudes are less than 0. 3 dB for frequencies from 3 GHz to 18 GHz. Reflectivity level as low as 53 dB has been achieved at 6 GHz. The measurement facility is also suitable for accurate polarimetric measurements of both monostatic and bistatic RCS. The smallest RCS that can be reliably measured is as low as - 70 dBsm for monostatic case and - 80 dBsm for bistatic case. Time-gating technique is applied to improve the measurement accuracy. The scattering from 3 -inch and 6 -inch spheres can be accurately measured in both magnitude and phase for all four polarisation combinations. The project involves securing the financial resources, determining the required specifications, designing the chamber structure, procuring various components and instrumentation, planning the logistical arrangements(contract,shipping, insurance, haulage, time to delivery, storage space), supervising the construction process, and evaluating the anechoic chamber according to the specific performance criteria. The necessary features such as access doors, ventilation, lighting, electrical power supply, power -line filters, connection panels, cables, pneumatic air supply, turntable, and motorised antenna mast are included in the design. In this project, to reduce cost, several components of the facility have been designed and fabricated which include the knife-edge shield doors, waveguide lighting units, connection panels, low-profile non-metallic turntable, adaptive antenna elevation mechanism, and horizontal scanning mechanism.

This study evaluates the thermodynamic transmission in the green roof ecosystem under different vegetation treatments. Our model simulation is based on the traditional Bowen ratio energy balance model (BREBM) and a proposed solar radiation <b>shield</b> <b>effectiveness</b> model (SEM). The BREBM investigates energy absorption of different components of radiation, and the SEM evaluates the radiation shield effects. The proposed model is tested and validated to be efficient to simulate solar energy transmission in green roofs, with some major findings. Firstly, the solar radiation transmission processes might be considered as free vibration motion. Daytime positive heat storage of the green roof is 350 - 520 W·m - 2 on an hourly basis. Nighttime or afternoon negative value registers a rather constant magnitude of - 60 W·m - 2. Daily net average is positive around 155 - 210 W·m - 2. Secondly, solar radiation vibration is highly correlated with plant structure. The canopy reflectance and transmittance are strongly correlated (R 2 = 0. 87). The multi-layer shrub treatment has the <b>highest</b> <b>shield</b> <b>effectiveness</b> (0. 34), followed by two-layer groundcover (0. 27), and single-layer grass (0. 16). Green roof vegetation absorbs and stores large amounts of heat to form an effective thermal buffer against daily temperature fluctuation. Vegetated roofs drastically depress air temperature in comparison with bare ground (control treatment). Finally, the thermodynamic model is relatively simple and efficient for investigating thermodynamic transmission in green roof ecosystem, and it could be developed into a broad solar radiant land cover model. © 2010 Elsevier B.

40|$|There is an {{increased}} interest {{in the development of}} <b>high</b> performance microwave <b>shielding</b> materials against electromagnetic pollution in recent years. Barium ferrite decorated reduced graphene oxide (BaFe 12 O 19 @RGO) nanocomposite was synthesized by a high energy ball milling technique and its electromagnetic properties were investigated in the frequency range of 12. 4 - 18 GHz (Ku band). The results showed that barium ferrite (BaFe 12 O 19) nanoparticles with an average particle size of 20 - 30 nm were well distributed and firmly anchored onto the surface of the reduced graphene oxide sheets. The obtained nanocomposite exhibited a saturation magnetization of 18. 1 emu g(- 1) at room temperature. The presence of BaFe 12 O 19 nanoparticles in the nanocomposite enhances the space charge polarization, natural resonance, multiple scattering and the effective anisotropy energy leading to a <b>high</b> electromagnetic interference <b>shielding</b> <b>effectiveness</b> of 32 dB (similar to 99. 9...|$|R
40|$|Introduction: Due to the {{importance}} of engineering controls for prevention of microwave exposure, this study was conducted to design and constract a novel electromagnetic shielding and also to examine the factors influencing shielding efficacy in X band frequency range. Material and Method: This study used Resin Epoxy as matrix and nano-Nickel Oxide as filler to prepare the composite plates with three different thicknesses (2, 4, and 6 mm) and four different weight percentages (5, 7, 9 and 11). The fabricated composites characterized using X-ray diffraction and Field Emission Scanning Electron microscopy. <b>Shielding</b> <b>effectiveness,</b> percolation depth, and percolation threshold were measured using Vector Network Analyzers. Thermal Gravimetric Analysis was conducted to study the temperature influence on weight loss for fabricated composites. Result: A maximum <b>shielding</b> <b>effectiveness</b> value of 84. 18 % was obtained for the 11 %- 6 mm composite at 8. 01 GHz and the 7 %- 4 mm composite exhibits a <b>higher</b> average of <b>shielding</b> <b>effectiveness</b> of 66. 72 % at X- band frequency range. The 4 mm thickness was optimum and critical diameter for composite plates; and percolation depth was obtained greater than thickness of composites. However, increasing the nickel oxide content did not show noticeable effect on the <b>shielding</b> <b>effectiveness.</b> Thermal Gravimetric Analysis showed that the study shields were resistant to temperature up to 150 °C without experiencing weight loss. What is more, the results indicated that Nickel oxide Nano particles had desirable distribution and dispersion in epoxy matrix and percolation threshold was appeared in low content of nickel oxide nanoparticles. Conclusion: A novel electromagnetic shield using low thickness and few content of nanoparticle with noticeable efficacy was properly designed and constructed in the field of occupational health. In addition, this shield has low cost, easy to manufacture, resistance to wet/corrosion, and low weight. Epoxy/nickel oxide composite can represents a new generation of electromagnetic shielding, which is considered as a promising candidate for occupational protection against microwave exposure. It is recommended that future studies improve the <b>shielding</b> <b>effectiveness</b> by decreasing the percolation depth and investigate the efficacy of the fabricated shield in the workplaces...|$|R
40|$|A free-space {{transmission}} method {{has been used}} for reliable <b>shielding</b> <b>effectiveness</b> measurement of the easily available textile materials. Textiles with three different yarn densities were studied for their <b>shielding</b> <b>effectiveness</b> {{with the help of a}} vector network analyzer and laboratory calibrated two X-band horn antennas. The expressions of uncertainty estimation have been derived in accordance with the present free-space measurement setup for the calculated SE values. The measurements have shown that an electromagnetic energy can be maximum shielded up to 16. 24 dB with measurement uncertainty less than 0. 21 dB in 8. 2 to 12. 4 GHz range by a 160. 85 μm textile. Thus, a thin textile with a high density can have <b>higher</b> <b>shielding</b> and this property mainly depends on its intrinsic structure, frequency range and thickness. This study promises the potential applications of such materials as a very cost effective shielding material at microwave frequencies with some modifications...|$|R
