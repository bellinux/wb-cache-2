50|$|He {{was later}} {{transferred}} to a POW camp on Haruku Island, where he and other prisoners were regularly beaten and compelled to perform hard labor. Malnutrition among the POWs was such a serious problem {{that some of them}} suffered from impaired vision. Accordingly, senior officers among the POWs asked Audus to produce yeast, as he had at Jaarmarkt, to provide the men with needed vitamins to survive. In a 2008 interview, Audus said that his Japanese captors knew that he was producing vitamin-rich yeast and actually promoted his work, and used it to supplement Japanese soldiers' diets.This time, however, there was no maize grain available. He solved this problem by isolating a mould fungus that not only produced the vitamins but also enabled him to produce an easily <b>digestible</b> <b>protein</b> through the fermentation of soya beans. These dietary supplements, in combination with the construction of a sea latrine that stopped a dysentery outbreak, helped lower POW deaths at the camp from 334 over a five-month period to 52 during the nine months preceding liberation.

The feeding value of azolla in laying hens was studied in two feeding trials of 16 and 8 weeks duration, respectively. Azolla meal was included at a level of 50 or 100 g kg diet at the expense of sesame meal in diets formulated on a total protein and total amino acid, or <b>digestible</b> <b>protein</b> and digestible amino acid basis (Trial 1). In Trial 2, 150 and 200 g kg azolla meal was included in diets formulated using a total protein and total amino acid, or <b>digestible</b> <b>protein</b> and digestible amino acid basis. L-lysine HCl and DL-methionine were added to the diets formulated using digestible nutrients to adjust the digestible lysine and methionine contents to those in the wheat sesame meal based control diet. It was found that azolla meal could replace sesame meal on a <b>digestible</b> <b>protein</b> and digestible amino acid basis up to 200 g kg diet with egg production as the parameter, while it could replace only up to 150 g kg sesame meal in the diet based on total protein and total amino acids.

An investigation showed, that the expensive sesame oil cakes in chicken diets could partially be replaced by cheap L. minor with increased growth performance of broiler. Nevertheless, because of a lower content of <b>digestible</b> <b>proteins</b> in L. minor (68.9% compared to 89.9% in sesame oil cake), common duckweed could only {{be used as a}} food supplement in broiler diets.

The interaction effects of diet structure (fine or coarse), FC supplementation (with or without), and BA supplementation (with or without) in a poorly digestible diet based on rapeseed meal (RSM) were tested in a factorial arrangement of 8 (2 Ã 2 Ã 2) dietary treatments.

Twelve feeds were formulated with three different <b>digestible</b> <b>protein</b> (DP) levels 22. 0; 26. 0 and 30. 0 % (based on digestible amino acids) and four different lysine percentages of 4. 5; 6. 0; 7. 5 or 9. 0 % in relation to <b>digestible</b> <b>protein.</b> The fish were fed ad libtum during a 60 -day period. There was significant effect of the <b>digestible</b> <b>protein</b> and digestible lysine ratio on weight gain, because the increase in lysine levels in feeds with 26 and 30 % DP promoted linear increase in this parameter. The best values for feed conversion were obtained at the levels 26 and 30 % DP that increased the daily consumption of <b>digestible</b> <b>protein.</b> The lysine level caused a linear reduction in feed conversion and linear increase in the protein efficiency rate. The results suggested that the 26 % DP level might be used in ration to feed Nile tilapia juveniles; however, these should contain digestible amino acids and the digestible lysine/digestible protein ratio should be 6. 0 %.

40|$|Abstract Cellulose and {{hemicelluloses}} are {{the most}} prevalent sources of carbon in nature. Currently many approaches employ micro-organisms and their enzyme products to degrade plant feedstocks for production of bioenergy. Scarab larvae are one such model. They consume celluloses {{from a variety of}} sources including plant roots, soil organicmatter and decaying wood, and are able to extract nutrients and energy from these sources. In this paper, we review the physicochemical properties of the scarab larval gut, the diversity and digestive role that microflora play in the scarab gut and discuss the potential for applying these digestive processes in bioreactors for improving bio-fuel production. Scarab larvae are characterised by their highly alkaline midgut which is dominated by serine proteinase enzymes, and a modified hindgut which harbors the majority of the intestinal microbiota under anaerobic conditions. Evidence suggests that digestion of recalcitrant organic matter in scarab larvae likely results from a combination of endogenous gut proteinases and cellulolytic enzymes produced by symbiotic micro-organisms.

The nutritional compn., like the total protein, iron and calcium was found to be in appreciable level in all varieties of breakfast cereals with very low anti nutrient content.

Pro-vitamin A content of the beet top silage was 1 - 2 mg. per 100 g. The silage was found to be a favourite feed with live-stock. Beet top silage contained 544 mg. oxalic acid per 100 g. The nutrient loss in fermentation process was 24 per cent in organic matter and 9 per cent in crude protein. The results of digestion experimets on rabbits showed that the digestibility coefficient of organic matter was 78 per cent; the <b>digestible</b> crude <b>protein</b> was 2 per cent and the total digestible nutrient 10. 4 per cent(cf.

The results of digestion experiments on rabbits showed that the digestibility coefficient of organic matter was 66 per cent, lower than that of fresh beet tops or beet top silage. The sun-cured beet tops were less palatable to rabbits than the fresh beet tops or the beet top silage. The contents of <b>digestible</b> crude <b>protein</b> and total <b>digestible</b> nutrient were 8. 4 per cent and 42. 0 per cent respectively. 3) A good silage was able to be prepared from beet pulp.
