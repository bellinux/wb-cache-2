25|$|This was in {{part due}} to the German belief that the Soviets had {{insufficient}} fuel supplies, particularly oil, which would undermine Soviet armaments production. The energy resources (30 percent in the Ural-Volga region, 27 percent in Soviet Asia, and 43 percent in the Caucasus) were used to complete an enormous mechanisation program. The populations' use of fuels for lighting and general civilian needs, caused OKL to assume that the Red Army and VVS could only meet peacetime <b>fuel</b> <b>allocations</b> through restrictions. It was believed that this difficulty would continue for some time. German intelligence also had a dim view of Soviet logistical capabilities. It viewed the Soviet road and rail networks as incomplete, thus the supply of aviation fuel to the VVS on the frontline would be poor and would curtail Soviet air operations. It was also thought that the bulk of Soviet industry lay west of the Urals, and was thus vulnerable to capture anyway. Although aware that the Soviet Union intended to move 40 to 50 percent of its industry east of the Urals to continue production, the Germans viewed this plan as impossible to carry out. The Luftwaffe also vastly underestimated the Soviet ability to improvise.|$|R

40|$|Since many of {{the factors}} related to rural energy systems are {{gradually}} being quantified, {{there is a need}} to construct a model that integrates a number of these factors simultaneously in a consistent framework. Therefore, a general linear programming model is developed to capture energy and agricultural interactions existing in the rural areas of developing countries. Energy used for agriculture includes fertilizers, irrigation and mechanization. Several technological choices of each of the above are considered and so are several crop commodities, several types of livestock, and farmers of different groups along with their assets, i. e. land holdings, livestock, etc. The by-products of agriculture, i. e. biomass, such as crop residues, animal dung, wood, etc., can be used to generate energy. On the demand side the use of them for feed, fuel, and fertilizer must be considered. Thus, the household sector (which is the largest user of noncommercial energy), as well as the rural industries sector, is intimately related to the agriculture sector. Twelve different energy sources and several conversion technologies, such as biogas, charcoal kilns, alcohol distilleries, etc., are considered. The model is applicable to low-income, biomass-scarce developing countries. However, different types of countries will require different approximations, and their needs for detailing some aspects or other may vary. The model is suitable for policy purposes because it considers several income groups separately and considers how different changes affect each of them.

The new classification, known as Group C Category 1, was designed to mandate Formula One engines. Although power was generally less than existing Group C cars (around 650 bhp compared to around 750 bhp upwards) the new cars are considered to be the among the quickest sportscars ever. However, the take up of these new regulations was slow and only a handful of Category 1 cars were ready for the 1991 season. Consequently, the FIA also allowed cars complying with pre-1991 Group C rules to contest the championship (as Group C Category 2 cars) during the one transitional year. They were however seriously handicapped in terms of weight, <b>fuel</b> <b>allocation</b> and grid positions.

40|$|This thesis gives a short {{introduction}} to the Dynamic Positioning(DP) domain and focuses on developing a <b>fuel</b> optimal thrust <b>allocation</b> algorithm for marine DP vessels with a diesel electric power plant. Obtained data is used to develop a static model for the fuel consumption of a diesel generator, {{as a function of}} its produced power. This model is used to formulate a convex Quadratic Programming(QP) -problem that finds fuel optimal solutions to the thrust allocation problem. This is possible {{due to the fact that}} DP vessels are usually over-actuated in terms of their thrusters. The <b>fuel</b> optimal thrust <b>allocation</b> algorithm shows promising results with respect to minimizing consumed fuel of the generators, when compared to thrust allocation algorithms that minimizes produced thrust or consumed power by the thrusters. The simulations in this thesis typically gives a fuel reduction on a rather common Platform Supply Vessel(PSV) of up to 2 % of its maximum possible fuel consumption, when compared to thrust and power minimizing thrust <b>allocation</b> algorithms. The <b>fuel</b> optimization can be implemented as a standard (QP) -problem by recalculation of its cost function weights based on linear and quadratic model approximations at the current operation point. A method for reducing load variations in the diesel generators produced power, and its implications on fuel consumption, sooting and NOx emission is proposed and discussed. Additionally, simulations of the thrust allocation, assisting the Power Management System(PMS) by reserving power on the bus for external consumers about to connect are presented, and it is shown that it might prevent start-up of extra generators. </p...|$|R

40|$|This study {{examines}} the coping mechanisms applied by rural {{households in the}} face of fuel wood scarcity by using survey data from randomly selected rural households in Ethiopia. The determinants of collection of other biomass energy sources were also examined. The results of the empirical analysis show that rural households residing in forest-degraded areas respond to fuel wood shortages by increasing their labour input to fuel wood collection. However, for households in high forest cover regions, forest stock and forest access may be more important factors than scarcity of fuel wood in determining household’s labour input to fuel wood collection. The study also finds that there is limited evidence of substitution between fuel wood and dung or fuel wood and crop residues. Therefore, supply-side strategies alone may not be effective in addressing the problem of forest degradation and biodiversity loss. Any policy on natural resource management, especially related to rural energy, should make a distinction between regions with different levels of forest degradation. <b>Fuel</b> wood, labor <b>allocation,</b> biomass, rural Ethiopia...|$|R

40|$|Households {{in rural}} India are highly {{dependent}} on firewood as their main source of energy, partly because non-biofuels tend to be expensive. The prevailing view is therefore that, when faced with shortages of firewood in the village commons, such households, and especially the women in them, have to spend {{more and more time}} searching for firewood and eventually settle for poorer-quality biomass such as twigs, branches and dry leaves. Using data from a random sample of rural households in the Indian state of Madhya Pradesh, we come to very different conclusions, however. We find that households in villages with degraded forests do not spend longer hours searching for firewood, but instead switch to either using firewood from private trees or to using agricultural waste for fuel. In the long run, moreover, households respond to the firewood shortage by altering the mix of private trees on their land in favor of firewood, as opposed to fruit, trees.

40|$|The {{increasing}} {{awareness of}} climate change issues, unstable fossil fuel prices and concerns about energy security are leading to a rising demand for forest products. If meeting this demand involves increased harvesting {{it is essential to}} employ efficient systems that allow sustainable forest management. This thesis examines the environmental performance of the Swedish forestry system and potential opportunities to improve this system. The focus was on roundwood and forest fuel procurement and timber transport, which were evaluated using a Life Cycle Assessment perspective. To evaluate the greenhouse gas savings from forest fuel, the dynamics of soil carbon stocks and the potential to replace fossil fuel were examined. Production of roundwood and forest fuel required little external energy and emitted low greenhouse gas emissions. About 3 % of the inherent energy available in roundwood and 2 - 5 % of that in forest fuel, logging residues and stumps was required in forest fuel production. More energy was required in northern Sweden than in southern Sweden, mostly due to higher energy use in transport operations. Secondary transport of roundwood and forest fuel comprised about 50 % of energy use, which could be decreased by reducing the road transport distance by modal changes, e. g. between lorry and train, increasing the loading factor, decreasing the fuel requirements of vehicles and using an energy carrier with good environmental characteristics. There were great greenhouse gas savings when forest fuel, stumps and logging residues, replaced fossil fuel. Important factors when assessing the greenhouse gas savings from forest fuel, were the efficiency of the end use, type of fossil <b>fuel</b> substituted, <b>allocation</b> method, site productivity, intensity of the harvesting and bioenergy source (stumps or logging residues). Increasing the use of forest products and forest fuel may decrease energy use and emissions of greenhouse gases if fossil fuel and petrochemical-intensive products can be substituted.

First, we rely on an asset pricing model to empirically {{determine the effect of}} carbon price risks on firm-specific cost of capital for a sample of 20 European utility stocks during the period 2005 - 2010. Second, we employ a discounted cash flow framework to simulate carbon-adjusted equity values for three selected utilities and their investment strategies from 2009 to 2020. We show that company-specific carbon risks are asymmetrically distributed to a few utility firms: While for the great majority of power producers carbon price movements are not a relevant risk factor, we find that utilities with an extremely high-emitting fuel mix bear significant risk premiums for carbon which translate to higher cost of capital and a loss of equity value. In contrast, we find no evidence that low-emitting utilities benefit from reduced capital costs. We further reveal that, in addition to the firm's <b>fuel</b> mix, permit <b>allocation</b> rules and replacement investment decisions in terms of fuel technology choice are the driving forces behind the carbon exposure of the utilities. The carbon-related loss of equity value is substantially reduced by implementing an investment strategy directed towards a carbon-free generation mix. The derogations from full permit auctioning in Eastern European member states provide insurance against carbon risks of utilities. (C) 2012 Elsevier B. V. All rights reserved...|$|R
40|$|Thesis (Master's) [...] University of Washington, 2012 A {{modified}} Fuel Characteristic and Classification System (FCCS) fuelbed {{was created}} for the Confederated Salish & Kootenai Tribes (CSKT) of Montana. This crosswalk of data combined two principal sources of data: (1) locally the Bureau of Indian Affairs (BIA) Continuous Forest Inventory Data (CFI) and (2) nationally the US Forest Service (USFS) datasets associated with Landscape Fire and Resource Management Planning Tools Project (LANDFIRE). These two data sets were chosen for various reasons. Initially, these two data sources were used {{as the foundation for}} a geospatial assessment that was completed as part of the UW-IGERT (Cohort 2), ¡§Bioresource based Energy for Sustainable Societies¡¨ program. That project constituted {{the first step in the}} development of this thesis. LANDFIRE was a tool that the Forestry and Fire Management programs of the CSKT were familiar with. and, in addition, this tool provides a nationally consistent high resolution (30 m) coverage that is compatible with other USFS fire and management tools. Therefore, LANDFIRE allowed for modifying the FCCS database to incorporate the local and site-specific data of CSKT. This benefit affords an opportunity for future adjustments that will produce finer scale data more appropriate for the management of reservation lands. During the development of the modified FCCS fuelbed, careful attention was made to incorporate existing landscape management plans and management schemes thus creating a hierarchical framework that would better capture site-specific fuelbed characteristics. The steps associated with the development of the modified fuelbed are summarized by the following steps: Seral Cluster,,³ Fire Regime,,³ Landscape = Modified Fuelbed The first step involves extracting Seral Cluster information from the tribal data sets, then combining fire regime information from both the Forest Service and Tribal Classifications. Landscape designations were also incorporated into the final datasets. This synthesized assessment is a first of its kind in terms of a crosswalk of data for a tribal nation that links information between the US Forest Service, an organization with the US Department of Agriculture and the BIA, an organization within the Department of Interior. This project was completed in consultation with CSKT tribal forestry staff and received full CSKT Tribal Council approval. The modified fuelbeds that have been created as a result of this research will serve a dual purpose. Locally, it will establish a database that will enable the utilization of nationally available fire and fuels modeling tools for use at the landscape level. Nationally, this modification will assist the tribe in updating and correcting the mapping conducted under National LANDFIRE. This mapping and the associated fuelbeds were accepted by the BIA and implemented on all reservation. A major consequence is that all fire and <b>fuels</b> funding <b>allocations</b> are now based upon this mapping system...|$|R
40|$|This master {{thesis is}} {{concerned}} with solving a combined fuel supply vessel scheduling and <b>fuel</b> type <b>allocation</b> problem. The problem is provided by a Hellenic oil company. The company has a small, fixed fleet of fuel supply vessels, which it uses to supply customer ships anchored in the broader area of Piraeus Port outside Athens. The supply vessels are loading multiple types of fuels at refineries before carrying the fuel out to the customer ships. The customers are either mandatory contract ships which must be served, or optional spot ships which may be served if the company has available capacity. The company must decide whether to accept a spot ship or not within only minutes after the inquiry. Based on the contract customers and the accepted spot customers, the company must generate schedules which specify which customers each supply vessel should supply, when this should be done and in what sequence. The planning horizon is three days. The customers specify a time for {{when they want to}} be served, something which must be accounted for in the generated schedules. A given customer ship can place orders of various fuel types to be delivered within the same time interval. All orders placed by a customer ship {{do not have to be}} operated by the same vessel, meaning customer splitting is possible. The fuels demanded must be allocated to compartments within the supply vessels, and fuels of different types cannot be loaded to the same compartment. Conversely, different orders of the same fuel type may be blended within a compartment, and large orders may be split between several compartments. The main objective of this thesis is to develop a detailed optimization model for the problem in order to really getting to know the problem and to study its complexity. This model is intended to serve as a starting point for additional research. Further, we want to utilize the model or variants of this to support the company in its decision making. The model is developed as a mixed-integer programming (MIP) problem and implemented by use of commercial optimization software. The test cases are generated based on real life information from the company. Due to the complexity of the problem, there is made considerable effort in reducing the numbers of variables and constraints in the implementation of the mathematical model. Valid inequalities and model simplifications are added to the basic model with the intention of further improving the model?s performance. The best solutions were obtained by a model which included both tested model simplifications; stowage elimination and no customer splitting. To get feasible solutions with respect to the real allocation problem, the vessels? total capacities had to be set as low as 50 % of the actual vessel capacities. The model with this capacity fraction performed well on test cases of smaller sizes, but in larger test cases this low capacity limits the possibility of obtaining solutions where all demand is met. The problem is very complex and consequently not easy to solve, but we have seen that simplifying complicating model aspects reduces the model?s complexity and makes the model better able to support the company in its decision making. Still, with regards to support the decision making, there is a need for further research. </p...|$|R
