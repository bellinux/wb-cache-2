40|$|This paper {{presents}} {{a variation of}} the visitor pattern which allows programmers to write visitor-like code in a concise way. The Runabout is a library extension that adds a limited form of multi-dispatch to Java. While the Runabout is not as expressive as a general multiple <b>dispatching</b> <b>facility,</b> the Runabout can be significantly faster than existing implementations of multiple dispatch for Java, such as MultiJava. Unlike MultiJava, the Runabout does not require changes to the syntax and the compiler. This paper illustrates how to use the Runabout, details its implementation, and provides benchmarks comparing its performance with other approaches. Furthermore, the effect of an automatic static program transformation tool that translates bytecode using the Runabout to equivalent bytecode is evaluated. The tool uses double dispatch and runtime type checks to achieve the same semantics that the Runabout has. The performance comparisons on large benchmarks that make extensive use multiple dispatch show that using the Runabout does not result in a significant loss of performance for realistic applications and that, depending on the application and platform, small performance gains are also possible...|$|R

5000|$|In dispatching, US {{emergency}} medical services literature suggests that telephone calls to a <b>dispatching</b> <b>facility</b> should {{be answered in the}} first few rings. One document suggests emergency calls to dispatch should result in busy signals once per 100 calls during the busiest hour. In business call centers, similar standards are suggested by consultants in order to provide an ideal customer experience and to outperform competing services. Sufficient staffing should be in place so that 90% of emergency calls are, [...] "...answered within 10 seconds, or with no greater than three rings, during the average busy hour," [...] according to one source. Tolerable wait times vary from one culture and region to another: some cultures expect immediate service; others will tolerate waits for some services. Regardless of sector or industry, almost all dispatchers will spend virtually their entire work day on the phone, answering as many as a thousand calls in a single shift while multi tasking other aspects of the job. In many ways, being a dispatcher is really one person doing the work of three or four people. It consistently ranks as among the most stressful jobs in the industrialized world, with high blood pressure, fatigue, obesity, heart disease, and other stress/sedentary related health concerns existing at rates up to ten times the norm of any other occupation.|$|R

40|$|Covering {{models have}} been used to locate {{emergency}} services such as ambulance and fire protection systems. As an example, in the late seventies, an analysis of the Baltimore, Maryland fire protection system was conducted with the development and use of a covering model called the Facility Location and Equipment Emplacement Technique (FLEET). The FLEET model combined the location of fire stations with the allocation of primary and special service equipment to the stations. Further, in a recent study of Austin, Texas the ambulance system was restructured based on the use of a covering model. Covering models have also been extended to handle some of the special circumstances involved in emergency service systems. One example is the maximal expected coverage problem (MEXCLP). This paper presents a new covering model which utilizes both the special coverage structure of the MEXCLP and the simultaneous station location and equipment allocation of the FLEET model. Optimal solutions are found using linear and integer programming. Results of the model applied to several planning data sets (including a form of the Austin, Texas planning problem) demostrate that more concentrated ambulance allocation patterns exist which may lead to easier <b>dispatching,</b> reduced <b>facility</b> costs, and better crew load balancing with little or no loss of service coverage. Tradeoff curves are presented which show that significant reductions in the number of dispatching sites (keeping the number of ambulances constant) can be made without any major changes in service level. ambulance modeling emergency services expected coverage location-allocation...|$|R

40|$|Background: A {{new model}} of a local {{disaster}} medical system (LDMS) was proposedthrough the consensus method of expert panel meetings for county governmentsin Taiwan. This LDMS model adopts a local emergency medicalresponse system (EMRS) for dealing with daily accidents as a basic structureby expanding its roles and functions. The objective {{of this study was}} todetermine the feasibility of the new LDMS model by evaluating its initialphase response to simulated disasters using tabletop exercises. Methods: Two tabletop exercises were held after the responders of the LDMS weretrained according to the new model. Forty and 42 participants respectivelyjoined the 2 tabletop exercises, which simulated an earthquake causing 400 casualties in 6 different locations in order to apply the new LDMS model. The outcome measurements of the tabletop exercises were the mean accuracyrate of victim triage and disposition, and medical interventions. Results: About 92 % of victims were correctly triaged, and 88 % had a correct disposition. Moreover, around 86 % of all victims received adequate medical interventions. All victims were <b>dispatched</b> to appropriate <b>facilities</b> or treatmentareas within 45 min. Conclusion: The new EMRS-oriented model of this LDMS can respond quickly, efficiently,and adequately to the initial phase of a disaster during tabletop exercises. Further clinical investigations are required to prove the efficacy of the newLDMS model in real disasters or in full-scale drills...|$|R
40|$|In {{the future}} grid environment, more {{sustainable}} resources will be increasing steadily. Their inherent unpredictable and intermittent characteristics will inevitably cause adverse {{impacts on the}} system static, dynamic and economic performance simultaneously. In this context, energy storage (ES) devices have been receiving growing attention because of their significant falling prices. Therefore, how to utilize these ES to help alleviate the problem of renewable energy (RE) sources integration has {{become more and more}} attractive. In my thesis, I will try to resolve some of the related problems from several perspectives. First of all, a comprehensive Future Australian transmission network simulation platform is constructed in the software DIgSILENT. Then in-depth research has been done on the aspect of frequency controller design. Based on mathematical reasoning, an advanced robust H∞ Load Frequency Controller (LFC) is developed, which can be used to assist the power system to maintain a stable frequency when accommodating more renewables. Afterwards, I develop a power system sensitivity analysis based-Enhanced Optimal Distributed Consensus Algorithm (EODCA). In the following study, a Modified Consensus Alternating Direction Method of Multipliers (MC-ADMM) is proposed, with this approach it can be verified that the convergence speed is notably accelerated even for complex large dimensional systems. Overall, in the Master thesis, I successfully provide several novel and practical solutions, algorithms and methodologies in regards to tackling both the frequency, voltage and the power flow issues in a future grid with the assistance of energy storage devices. The scientific control and optimal <b>dispatch</b> of these <b>facilities</b> could provide us with a promising approach to mitigate the potential threats that the intermittent renewables posed on the power system in the following decades...|$|R
