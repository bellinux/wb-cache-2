In top drive, the drill string is turned by mechanisms {{located in the}} top drive that {{is attached to the}} blocks.

50|$|Soil mixing {{can be used}} {{to deliver}} solid or liquid forms of oxidants to {{contaminated}} soil. For near surface to intermediate contamination zones, either standard construction equipment (i.e. bucket mixing), or specialized soil mixing tools (i.e. Lang Tool, Allu Tool, Alpine, etc.) can be used. Deep soil mixing requires specialized auger mixing equipment. In order to apply this method in-situ and in deep soil, the oxidant must be pumped to the point of mixing using a <b>kelly</b> <b>bar</b> (a piece of earth drilling equipment), or appropriate piping to the place where the soil needs to be oxidized. The soil then has to be mixed by using mixing blades.|$|E
40|$|Soil mixing is a {{well-established}} technology {{used in the}} improvement of the strength of soil as well as the remediation of chemical contaminants in soil. This process is typically referred to as in situ solidification/stabilization (S/S). In situ S/S involves mixing a binding reagent into the contaminated media or waste using soil augers and has been used to treat both organic and inorganic hazardous waste constituents. Cement-based mix designs are most commonly used for S/S treatment of hazardous waste, however, a variety of additives such as fly ash, hydrated lime, bentonite can also used to meet specific project requirements. Several technologies can be used for the in situ S/S of soils, however, a specific focus will be placed {{on the use of the}} Shallow Soil Mixing (SSM) technique. SSM consists of using a single large diameter auger, generally on the range of 5 to 10 ft in diameter, capable of mixing to depths up to 30 or 40 feet deep. The mixing shaft, known as the <b>kelly</b> <b>bar,</b> is hollow stemmed and is attached to a single flight auger which breaks the soil loose and lifts it slightly to six beater bars on the mixing shaft. As the auger penetrates the soil, a slurried reagent is pumped through the mixing shaft and exits through jets located on th...|$|E

The rifle had jammed and the men had been attempting to free its bolt. Inside a bedroom, police found three Steyr rifles, ammunition and illuminating flares. Several hours earlier the UVF had exploded a car bomb outside <b>Kelly's</b> <b>Bar</b> on Whiterock Road and then taken up sniping positions from high-rise flats in Springmartin.
