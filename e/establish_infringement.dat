5000|$|A {{plaintiff}} establishes [...] "actual copying" [...] {{with direct}} or indirect evidence. Direct evidence is satisfied either by a defendant's admission to copying or the testimony of witnesses who observed the defendant in the act. More commonly, a plaintiff relies on circumstantial or indirect evidence. A court will infer copying by a showing of a [...] "striking similarity" [...] between the copyrighted work and the alleged copy, along with a showing of both access and use of that access. [...] A plaintiff may establish [...] "access" [...] by proof of distribution over a large geographical area, or by eyewitness testimony that the defendant owned {{a copy of the}} protected work. Access alone is not sufficient to <b>establish</b> <b>infringement.</b> The plaintiff must show a similarity between the two works, and the degree of similarity will affect the probability that illicit copying in fact occurred in the court's eyes. [...] Even then, the plaintiff must show that the copying amounted to improper appropriation. Indeed, the United States Supreme Court has held that not all copying constitutes infringement and a showing of misappropriation is necessary.|$|E

The ex-post (non) implementation of such explicit contract can then be discretionally exchanged against the pro-vision of non contractible tasks (B) that are highly valuable for the principal. An empirical implication of the result, consistent with casual observation in pro-curement, is that penalties for <b>infringements</b> <b>established</b> by explicit contracts are seldom exercised, even though violations take place and are easy to monitor and verify. ...|$|R

40|$|Article 6 (1) of the European Trade Marks Directive {{provides}} {{a series of}} justifications for a third party to make unauthorized commercial use the proprietor s mark when his use is in accordance with honest practices in industrial and commercial matters. Recently in Gillette v. Parason and Celine SA v. Celine SARL, the ECJ has clarified what constituted honest practices. Essentially, the third party use must not {{give the impression that}} there is a commercial connection between the third party and the trade mark owner, must not affect the value of the trade mark by taking advantage of its distinctive character and must not denigrate the mark. Unfortunately, as I would illustrate in my paper, to avail himself of the honest use defense, the alleged infringer is required under Celine and Gillette to disprove the same elements that the trade mark proprietor would have already succeeded in proving when establishing that an actionable infringement had occurred. If the purpose of Article 6 (1) is to provide a meaningful defense for a third party, the parameters of what would constitute honest practices must not be just a repetition of the elements that <b>establish</b> an <b>infringement</b> action. In other words, given that the proprietor has succeeded in establishing that the third party s sign (1) would lead to a likelihood of confusion over the origin of goods or (2) would take an unfair advantage of the trade mark s distinctive character or repute or (3) is detrimental to the repute, a defense must be open to the unauthorized user notwithstanding the existence of the abovementioned transgressions.

The third part of the paper reviews use of the copyright statute of limitations to resolve competing ownership claims. The {{last part of the}} paper, flagging important differences between § 201 (b) and § 204 (a), explains why one approach used by the Seventh Circuit to clear title was inappropriately applied by the Ninth Circuit. It concludes that, had the copyright statute of limitations been pled in the later case, the opportunity to misapply § 204 (a) should not have arisen. Summary judgment would have been warranted on § 507 (b), and that would have made it unnecessary for the Ninth Circuit to offer three alternative ways to extricate a copyright owner from the horns of a dilemma. ...|$|R

While the burden remains upon the defendant, fair dealing is considered a [...] "user's right" [...] rather than simply a defence, and should be interpreted liberally to accommodate freedom of expression as guaranteed by the Canadian Charter of Rights and Freedoms: [...] Before reviewing the scope of the fair dealing exception under the Copyright Act, it is important to clarify some general considerations about exceptions to copyright infringement. Procedurally, a defendant is required to prove that his or her dealing with a work has been fair; however, the fair dealing exception is perhaps more properly understood {{as an integral part of}} the Copyright Act than simply a defence. Any act falling within the fair dealing exception will not be an infringement of copyright. The fair dealing exception, like other exceptions in the Copyright Act, is a user's right. In order to maintain the proper balance between the rights of a copyright owner and users' interests, it must not be interpreted restrictively. As Professor Vaver, supra, has explained, at p. 171: [...] "User rights are not just loopholes. Both owner rights and user rights should therefore be given the fair and balanced reading that befits remedial legislation." ...|$|R

It has been found that for a DRM scheme to be Fair Use friendly it has to aim to reach the following idealistic characteristics: *	The copyright holders should not be able to interfere with usage which a judge would or could rule as fair use. *	The Consumers would be able to consume the content easily and spontaneously within interoperable regimes. *	The Consumers? privacy rights would be respected, in congruence with the legislation in question. *	The Consumers should be able to purchase, replicate and distribute music at a monetary cost. *	The Consumers should be able to replicate, distribute and store music at the cost of diminished quality, slow replication and slow distribution. However it has also been found that these characteristics alone are not enough, and therefore the DRM scheme should be implemented within the following conditions: *	The DRM scheme should find ways to handle the ambiguity of Fair Use. *	The DRM scheme should facilitate ex-post tracking and monitoring rather than ex-ante based decision making. *	The DRM scheme should support interoperability and privacy.

40|$|There are two {{categories}} of patent infringement: direct infringement and indirect infringement. Legislation in most major {{countries in the world}} {{pay more attention to the}} direct infringement, only some countries highlighted the importance of indirect infringement legislation. Among them, the U. S. is the first country that <b>establish</b> indirect <b>infringement</b> legislation. Base on US indirect infringement legislation, Japan, Germany and other countries established their own systems according to their national conditions and needs. This thesis argues that national legislation should take local industrial advancement into consideration while promulgating indirect infringement acts. Three different types of patents: invention patent, new model patent and new design patent, and corresponding direct infringement determination are introduce in Chapter 2. The difference of the patent infringement determination standards of invention and new design between Taiwan and the United States is addressed in subsequent paragraphs. The patent litigation of direct infringement is compared between Taiwan and the United States in Chapter 3. Issue points and theoretical basis for the dispute cases based on "All element rules", "Doctrine of equivalent" and "Estoppel" are illustrated to clarify arguments leading to conclusion of this thesis. Indirect infringement in the statute and in the patent practice of the United States, Japan, and Germany is discussed in Chapter 4. The United States covered induce infringement, contributory infringement and extraterritoriality while Japan covered only contributory infringement and Germany covered only induce infringement and contributory infringement. This chapter ends up with discussing Taiwan''s amendment draft of indirect infringement and the different views of the issue,we summed up Taiwan''s future direction of legal amendments. In conclusion, suggestion toward legal amendments based on practices in US, Japan and German are given. Industrial implications are also addressed in order to achieve win-win objectives. 專利侵權型態，主要區分為直接與間接侵權，世界各主要國家，多半設有直接侵權制度，只有部分國家有間接侵權的設立，而美國乃間接侵權的首創國，並為該制度的標竿，日、德等參考其制度，再依其本國國情及需求，建立相關而又有差異的制度。 本論文第二章先論述專利種類:發明、新型及新式樣之不同，及直接侵權認定標準，述及台灣及美國之新式樣、發明的專利侵權認定標準，從新式樣專利之本質論起，再依序舉台灣新式樣專利的權利範圍解讀與其侵權認定流程，及美國對應之設計專利的權利範圍解讀與其侵權認定流程。 第三章探討專利直接侵權判決，從製造、使用型態，舉出台灣及美國侵權判決，依全要件原則、均等論、禁反言 [...] -等原則，說明個案爭點與理論依據。 第四章介紹專利間接侵權，說明何謂間接侵權，依序介紹美、日、德的相關法規與判決實務，美國包含:教唆侵權、幫助侵權及域外效力，日本只有幫助侵權，德國則有教唆與幫助侵權，最後說明台灣間接侵權修正草案現況及各方見解，歸納出我國未來修法方向。 第五章就我國產業現況，參酌美、日、德侵權法規及實務運作結果，各別執行上的考量，衍生實務上的差異，提建議給國內廠商未來可能努力方向，也具體說明若要修法，呼應國內外各方聲音，以扶持國內產業為前提，如何能夠達到各取所需雙贏的模式。簡 目 謝 誌 I 中文摘要 II ABSTRACT IV 表 次 VI 圖 次 VII 凡 例 VIII 第一章 緒論 1 第一節 研究動機 1 第一項 專利對於產業的重要性 2 第二項 台、美、中產業現況 2 第二節 研究目的 3 第三節 研究範圍 4 第四節 研究方法 4 第五節 論文回顧 4 第六節 研究架構 8 第二章 專利直接侵權認定標準 10 第一節 專利種類 10 第一項 發明專利 10 第二項 新型專利 11 第三項 新式樣專利 11 第二節 專利直接侵權認定標準 12 第一項 發明（新型）專利侵害認定標準 12 第二項 新式樣專利侵害 40 第三章 專利直接侵權判決 49 第一節 有關製造構成專利侵權之案例 50 第一項 台灣判決 50 第二項 美國判決 77 第二節 有關使用構成專利侵權之案例 79 第一項 台灣判決 79 第四章 專利間接侵權 88 第一節 間接侵權之定義 88 第二節 美國相關規定與判決 89 第一項 美國間接侵權制度的發展歷程與法規 89 第二項 美國判決 98 第三項 本文見解 122 第三節 日本相關規定與判決 123 第一項 日本法規與實務 123 第二項 日本判決 128 第三項 本文見解 130 第四節 德國相關規定與判決 131 第一項 德國法規與實務 131 第二項 德國判決 134 第三項 本文見解 142 第五節 美國、日本、德國專利間接侵權規定比較 143 第一項 德國專利法第 10 條與美國專利法第 271 條第(f) 項之差異 144 第二項 美、日、德客觀行為的比較 144 第六節 我國間接侵權實務 146 第一項 台灣間接侵權可援引法規 146 第二項 間接侵權相關判決 149 第三項 專利法修正草案 152 第四項 專利間接侵權對我國廠商的衝擊 154 第七節 中國大陸間接侵權實務 154 第一項 中國大陸間接侵權可援引法規 155 第二項 間接侵權相關判決 156 第三項 本文見解 158 第五章 結論 160 參考文獻 163 索引 16...|$|R
