2500|$|One of the {{principal}} terms that accompanies the employment relationship is that the employer will provide a [...] "safe system of work". As the industrial revolution developed, accidents from a hazardous working environment were a front line target for labour legislation, {{as a series of}} Factories Acts, from 1802, required minimum standards in workplace cleanliness, ventilation, fencing machinery, not to mention restrictions on child labour and limits to the working day. These Acts typically targeted particular kinds of workplaces, such as mines, or textile mills, before the more generalised approach took hold now seen in the Factories Act 1961. That applies to any workplace where an article is made or changed, or animals are kept and slaughtered. The Employer's Liability (Defective Equipment) Act 1969 made employers automatically liable for equipment with defects supplied by third parties. Because isolated employees lack the technical skill, time, training to litigate, such regulation's primary line of enforcement was through inspectors or agencies before matters went to court. Today the Health and Safety at Work etc. Act 1974, enforced by the Health and Safety Executive, is the main law. The HSE can delegate enforcement to local authorities, whose inspectors have the power to investigate and require changes to workplace systems. In addition, HSWA 1974 section 2 foresees that employees will set up their own workplace committees, elected by the employees and with the power to codetermine health and safety matters with management. Spelling out the general duties found in HSWA 1974, are a set of health and safety regulations, which must also stay in line with the European-wide <b>harmonised</b> <b>requirements</b> of the Health and Safety Directive.|$|E

In this respect we choose the “PEST ” and the “SWOT ” Analyses, which give the possibility of a complete overview {{from the perspective of the}} Political, Economic, Social and Technological factors, which are classified as Strengths, Weaknesses, Opportunities and Threats in a SWOT Analysis. The result of the analyses certifies that since the beginning of 2004 the Romanian Capital Market registered a sustained positive evolution. The main cause of this evolution was the acceleration of the liberalisation process of the whole Romanian market.

An epidemiological indicator is defined as the prevalence or the concentration of the hazard at a certain stage of the food chain or an indirect measure of the hazard that correlates with the human health risk caused by the hazard. The indicators can be used by the European Commission and the Member States to consider when adaptations to meat inspection methods may be required, and to carry out risk analysis to support such decisions.

40|$|International audienceIntroduction Autogenous {{vaccines}} are “immunological veterinary {{medicinal products}} which are manufactured from pathogens and antigens obtained from an animal or animals from a holding and used {{for the treatment of}} that animal or the animals of that holding in the same locality”. 1 They are a useful addition to licensed vaccines 2 in animal disease control and in maintaining animal health. The use of vaccines, including autogenous vaccines, can be an additional prophylactic tool to avoid occurrence of diseases which require antibiotic treatment. The wide use of autogenous vaccines and cross-border movement of animals vaccinated with autogenous vaccines is now becoming a common practice within Europe. However, there are no <b>harmonised</b> <b>requirements</b> for the manufacture, control and use of autogenous vaccines across the EU. National laws and/or legislation are di. erent when they exist, and sometimes there is no speci. c legislation covering use and production of autogenous vaccines. In this article, an overview of the European situation is provided, detailing the answers received in response to the CMDv questionnaire. The aim of this questionnaire was to have an update on the situation of autogenous vaccines in Europe. A total of 22. member states provided answers to the survey even if they did not respond to all questions. The questionnaire was divided in three parts: general questions on the regulatory matters concerning autogenous vaccines; details on the types of autogenous vaccines; details on their manufacturing. First, if compared to a 2004 VMRFG 3 questionnaire on the same matters, it has been observed that there have been no fundamental changes in use and requirements between 2004 and 2014, but member states have gained more experience with these types of vaccines and their use has increased (volume/batches) ...|$|E

The meta-model Sustainability Impact Assessment Tools (SIAT) is the central tool of the European research project, which was developed over four years. We illustrate the methodology and procedure of SIAT that is tailored to simulate land use policies. SIAT allows conducting ex-ante sustainability impact assessment towards the target year 2025 at the level of 570 European regions. A critical analysis at the policy-science interface discusses the procedure of the SIAT development process and reveals the mean of prototyping as basis for the requirement analysis. We summarise the major problems we faced at intuitional level that influenced the quality of the requirement analysis. Finally we conclude on the institutional reasons for asymmetric information that (i) hinders efficient stakeholder involvement and (ii) causes shortcoming to mirror precise end-user requirements in the architectural model design: Quantifying utility level on realistic needs is not precisely applicable due to (a) high opportunity costs to survey and <b>harmonise</b> individual <b>requirements,</b> (b) uncertain forecasts on costs estimates, (c) asymmetric information related to high transactions costs for communication and strategic behaviour of policy makers, researcher and IT developer, (d) requested but unfeasible technical implementation possibilities, (e) predefined and thus limited ¿room of manoeuvre¿ and constraints laid down in research proposals and resulting contracts.

Art.  57 (e) REACH covers substances for which scientific evidence of increased persistence (vP) as well as increased bioaccumulation (vB) is available.

The toxicity criteria of Art. 57 REACH are, in case of CMRs, based on internationally <b>harmonised</b> classification <b>requirements</b> according to GHS [4] or, in case of PBTs, according to REACH Annex XIII at least more stringent compared with the requirements of international law following from the POP-convention [5]. For identification of vPvBs as SVHC evidence of toxicity is not necessary. However, the indicators to determine bioaccumulation in international law sources (POP-convention [5] and convention on long-range transboundary air pollution [6]) are identical with the vB criteria in Annex XIII, section  1.2. 2 REACH [7]. Moreover, vPvBs may also unfold adverse effects on humans and the environment on the long-term, these are, however, due to the substances’ properties, difficult to predict [8]. Furthermore, Art.  57 (f) classifications may also be founded on GHS criteria such as respiratory or skin sensitisation which is, according to ECHA, of equivalent concern to CMRs.

40|$|Croatia is geographically, {{historically}} and culturally {{a part of}} the European territory. Regions, as specific units within a national territory, are defined differently on EU level than in Croatia, where counties are far too small to be considered as regions in EU terms. The implementation of European regional policy requires "comparability" of territories, which is done {{on the basis of the}} Nomenclature of Territorial Units for Statistics (NUTS). After long discussions with the European Commission and Eurostat, Croatia has three "new" NUTS II regions (March, 2007) : Adriatic, North-Eastern (Pannonian) and North-Western Croatia including the capital city of Zagreb. These regions are now acceptable for EU regional policy and funds. Institutional structures for managing regional development on this new regional level does not exist, as well as legislative framework necessary to implement policies, strategies, plans or projects prepared at the respective levels, while at the same time very interesting developments from the bottom-up can be observed. Regional development agencies established have recently been nominated as regional coordinators for elaboration of planning documents at the County level initiating development processes, still at the county level and through informal mechanisms at the regional level. Territorial cohesion across Europe stands out as one of the top European priorities. Considerably large number of programmes, measures and priorities, aim at achievement of this goal. Croatia, as an acceding country, strives to <b>harmonise</b> numerous <b>requirements</b> prior to entering European union space in all aspects of entry, including territorial cohesion. Last decade was marked by a certain shift in shaping and implementing Croatian regional policy at programming and regulatory level towards that aim, among others.

Methods: We identified and analysed health RCS evaluation frameworks published by seven funding agencies between 2004 and 2012, using a mixed methods approach involving structured qualitative analyses of documents, a stakeholder survey and consultations with key contacts in health RCS funding agencies. Results: The frameworks were intended for use predominantly by the organisations themselves, and most were oriented primarily towards funders’ internal organisational performance requirements. The frameworks made limited reference to theories that specifically concern RCS. Generic devices, such as logical frameworks, were typically used to document activities, outputs and outcomes, but with little emphasis on exploring underlying assumptions or contextual constraints. Usage of the ESSENCE framework appeared limited. Conclusions: We believe that there is scope for improving frameworks through the incorporation of more accessible information about how to do evaluation in practice; greater involvement of stakeholders, following evaluation capacity building principles; greater emphasis on explaining underlying rationales of frameworks; and structuring frameworks so that they separate generic and project-specific aspects of health RCS evaluation. The third and fourth of these improvements might assist harmonisation...|$|R
40|$|The {{objective}} of this casebook, like others in the Ius Commune Series, is to help uncover common roots, notwithstanding differences in approach, of the European legal systems, {{with a view to}} strengthening the common legal heritage of Europe. It covers the big legal families in the EU and contains judgments from the supreme courts and other courts of the Member States. In view of the importance of EC legislation (eg harmonisation directives and regulations) in this field, the consumer law casebook contains much material derived from Community law, such as extracts from directives (eg on unfair contract terms, distance selling, doorstep selling, product liability, unfair commercial pratices etc) and judgments of the ECJ and national court decisions. Furthermore, attention is paid to the way in which, when interpreting EC directives in the consumer field, the ECJ refers to concepts common to the legal systems of the Member States and how the courts of the Member States incorporate the concepts found in the directives (as interpreted by the ECJ) in their legal systems. The casebook also compares harmonised and pre-harmonised law, especially in the case law of the Member States. It concentrates on private law in the field of consumer protection but also addresses topics, in particular in the field of enforcement, that are primarily a matter of public law.
