40|$|Oxidative stress plays a {{major role}} in {{cardiovascular}} disease. Despite the widespread acceptance of this view, it remains a challenge to establish the importance of this link in specific disease states because of the numerous pro-oxidant substances and also the many endogenous antioxidant systems that contribute to the imbalance that we term 'oxidative stress'. It seems that the vascular endothelium is particularly sensitive to oxidative stress, and this is one of the mechanisms that results in widespread endothelial dysfunction in most cardiovascular diseases. Moreover, when the endothelium becomes diseased it is itself a source of oxidative stress; however, other components of the vasculature, such as the adventitia, are also important sources of oxidative stress. The symposium Oxidative stress and the endothelium at Life Sciences Meeting, Glasgow, Thursday 12 th July 2007 aimed to bring together important new data and concepts that are contributing to the rapid advances in our understanding of this area.

USPIO can be employed to provide immediate blood pool contrast, or to act as subsequent markers of cellular inflammation through uptake by inflammatory cells. They can also be targeted to specific cell-surface markers using antibody or ligand labeling. This review will discuss the application of USPIO contrast in MRI studies of cardiovascular disease.

Although the efficacy of LAMAs and LABAs has been well established through randomized controlled trials (RCTs), questions remain regarding their cardiovascular (CV) safety. Furthermore, while the safety of LAMA and LABA monotherapy has been extensively studied, data are lacking for LAMA/LABA combination therapy, and the majority of the studies that have reported on the CV safety of LAMA/LABA combination therapy were not specifically designed to assess this. Evaluation of CV safety for COPD treatments is important because many patients with COPD have underlying CV comorbidities. However, severe CV and other comorbidities are often exclusion criteria for RCTs, contributing to a lack in external validity and generalizability. Real-world observational studies are another important tool to evaluate the effectiveness and safety of COPD therapies in a broader population of patients and can improve upon the external validity limitations of RCTs. We examine what is already known regarding the CV and cerebrovascular safety of LAMA/LABA combination therapy from RCTs and real-world observational studies, and explore the advantages and limitations of data derived from each study type. We also describe an ongoing prospective, observational, comparative post-authorization safety study of a LAMA/LABA combination therapy (umeclidinium/vilanterol) and LAMA monotherapy (umeclidinium) versus tiotropium, with a focus on the relative merits of the study design.
