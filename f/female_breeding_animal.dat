40|$|Somalia, {{one of the}} world's poorest countries, has {{livestock}} as {{the mainstay}} of the economy, with an estimated 65 % of the population engaged in the livestock sector. This paper presents a gendered study on the traditional livestock breeding practices of Somali pastoralists for camels, cattle, sheep and goats, {{with a focus on}} documenting livestock traits of importance, the criteria used to select male <b>breeding</b> <b>animals</b> and the criteria used to cull <b>female</b> <b>breeding</b> <b>animals.</b> Data for the study were obtained by performing participatory rural appraisals (PRAs) with separate male and female pastoral groups from 20 settlements of the Tog-Dheer region of Somaliland (in north-western Somalia). In total, more than 500 pastoralists were involved. In terms of livestock ownership, goats were the most common species kept (97 % of all households), followed by sheep (64 %), camels (37 %) and cattle (9 %), with considerable herd size variation across households. Traits of key importance to the pastoralists varied by species and gender of the PRA group, but included adaptedness to harsh environmental conditions, high market value/high meat production and high milk production. The pastoralists practised sensible criteria for the selection of male <b>breeding</b> <b>animals</b> for all species, capturing aspects of productivity (milk yield, reproduction), adaptedness (good hardiness) and marketability (body size and conformation). Similarly, they practised sensible criteria for culling of <b>female</b> <b>breeding</b> <b>animals,</b> with <b>females</b> removed from the herd primarily for poor performance, but also to meet the livelihood needs of the family. Differences in the selection and culling criteria were noted by species, as well as gender of the pastoralists. On the whole, there was strong alignment between the livestock selection criteria used by the Somali pastoralists, their reasons for keeping livestock and the market requirements. This is not surprising given the intimate and long-standing relationship between Somali pastoralists and their livestock. Danish International Development AgencyPeer Revie...|$|R

40|$|A {{survey was}} {{conducted}} to characterize cattle production systems and preferred cattle functions in North and South Wollo Zones of the Amhara Regional State of northeastern Ethiopia. Rapid survey and semi-structured questionnaires were used {{to collect data on}} herd structures, indicative productive and reproductive performances, preferred cattle functions and trait preferences of cattle. Individual cattle herd sizes ranged from 1 to 24 with site average herd size ranged from 5. 5 to 14. 0. The number of adult breeding bulls in each herd gave a ratio of one bull to less than three <b>breeding</b> <b>females,</b> and yet <b>breeding</b> bulls are not adequately available in the villages. Based on reported indicative performances, overall average age at first calving in the study area was about 4 years. Similarly average calving intervals ranged between 14. 4 and 19. 3 months with overall average of 17. 6 months. The overall reported average daily milk yield was 1. 9 liters with village averages ranging from 1. 6 to 2. 3 liters. The average reported lifetime calf production was 6. 5 during a productive lifetime of about 8 and 10 years for male and female animals, respectively. Generally, cattle are preferred and expected to have multiple production and service functions. The indigenous cattle are preferred to exotic/introduced animals for their robust adaptive attributes. Subsistence smallholder animals do select particularly <b>female</b> <b>breeding</b> <b>animals</b> for a range of desirable attributes of their animals, but some of these attributes are related to behaviour and body form of the animals, which are not necessarily directly related to production functions.

40|$|During the {{breeding}} season, male green anole lizards extend a throat fan (dewlap) in courtship. This behavior is facilitated by testosterone (T). Females extend {{a much smaller}} dewlap less often, even with the same dose of T. During the nonbreeding season when T is low, dewlap extension is reduced. To determine if parallels exist between structure and function, we investigated neuron soma size and density in the preoptic area (POA) and ventromedial nucleus of the amygdala (AMY), which {{are involved in the}} display behavior, in breeding and nonbreeding males and <b>females.</b> Cells from <b>breeding</b> <b>animals</b> were larger than cells from nonbreeding animals, but they were not sexually dimorphic. No significant effects existed in neuron density. This experiment indicates that portions of the anole forebrain important for sexual behavior are plastic and might be influenced by seasonal changes in steroid hormones. To investigate whether T can reverse the seasonal difference in soma size in both sexes, gonadectomized nonbreeding anoles were implanted with an empty or T propionate-filled capsule; animals were also tested for male-typical courtship behavior. Males and females treated with T had higher rates of dewlap extension, but across treatment groups these rates were greater in males. Neuron soma size in the POA and AMY was larger in males than females, but no effects of treatment were detected. Taken together, the results indicate that T can stimulate behavior in the nonbreeding season and suggest that a dissociation exists between the regulation of the courtship display and soma size of relevant brain regions...|$|R

40|$|Abstract Background Accounting for and {{quantifying}} the associative {{effect of}} each animal could improve both {{welfare of animals}} and response to selection. Because of the limitation of REML, Gibbs Sampling could be an alternative technique to estimate the variance component of the associative effect. The objective {{of this study was}} to investigate the estimation accuracy of the variance component of associative effect by using simulation via Gibbs Sampling. The simulated data comprised five generations of pigs. The <b>breeding</b> <b>animals</b> of each generation were selected randomly. In the simulation, variations were introduced for the methods of assigning pens (random, mixed sib and full sib), the number of pigs per pen (5 or 10), the number of <b>breeding</b> <b>animals</b> per generation (162 or 324) and the correlation between genetic direct effect and genetic associative effect (- 0. 5, 0. 1 or + 0. 5). Each set of simulation was run for 30 replications. Results Random assignment or mixed sib assignment resulted in bias of estimated variance components in only 3 of 24 combinations. Furthermore, these 3 cases occurred with 162 <b>breeding</b> <b>animals.</b> With full sib assignment, 9 out of 12 groups of estimates significantly deviated from the true parameter value. The Root Mean Square Errors obtained with the full sib assignment were higher than with the other two methods of pen assignment in most of the cases. The Root Mean Square Errors obtained with datasets with 324 <b>breeding</b> <b>animals</b> were notably smaller than the datasets from 162 <b>breeding</b> <b>animals.</b> Within each method of pen assignment, the relative bias of the associative effect was significantly smaller with group size 10 than with group size 5. Conclusion Full sib assignment caused difficulties to estimate variance components in most of the cases, due to a lack of identifiability. With random and mixed assignment, most data structures yielded unbiased results but increasing the number of <b>breeding</b> <b>animals</b> or group size improves the estimation. Thus to get identifiable and unbiased estimates of the genetic associative effect, it is recommended to avoid close genetic relationship between animals within one pen and to use sufficient numbers of <b>breeding</b> <b>animals</b> and sufficient group sizes. </p...|$|R
