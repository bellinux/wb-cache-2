50|$|Once {{agricultural}} societies emerged, {{the sexual}} framework shifted {{in ways that}} persisted for many millennia in much of Asia, Africa, Europe, {{and parts of the}} Americas. One common characteristic new to these societies was the collective supervision of sexual behavior due to urbanization, and the growth of population and population density. Children would commonly witness parents having sex because many families shared the same sleeping quarters. Due to landownership, <b>determination</b> <b>of</b> children's <b>paternity</b> became important, and society and family life became patriarchal. These changes in sexual ideology were used to control female sexuality and to differentiate standards by gender. With these ideologies, sexual possessiveness and increases in jealousy emerged. With the domestication of animals, new opportunities for bestiality arose. Males mostly performed these types of sexual acts and many societies acquired firm rules against it. These acts also explain the many depictions of half-human, half-animal mythical creatures, and the sports of gods and goddesses with animals. While retaining the precedents of earlier civilizations, each classical civilization established a somewhat distinctive approach to gender, artistic expression of sexual beauty, and to behaviors such as homosexuality. Some of these distinctions are portrayed in sex manuals, which were also common among civilizations in China, Greece, Rome, Persia, and India; each has its own sexual history.|$|R

I chose four areas <b>of</b> the <b>determination</b> <b>of</b> parenthood, {{which can lead to}} various complications - assisted reproduction, surrogacy, secret childbirths and anonymous births. In the first chapter of the thesis I deal with the legal aspects <b>of</b> the <b>determination</b> <b>of</b> parenthood. I examine mandatory <b>determination</b> <b>of</b> maternity and various assumptions <b>of</b> <b>paternity.</b> With the development of relations in the society and of the reproductive medicine, there emerge possibilities doubting the traditional legal principles <b>of</b> the <b>determination</b> <b>of</b> parenthood.

Accord-ingly, this study examined subjective estimates of human non-paternity (HNP), the discrepancy between social/legal versus genetic paternity. The hypothesis was that women would provide higher estimates of HNP than men. A sex difference in the hypothesized direction was observed across four community samples of Austrian adults (totalling 763 men and 795 women), with women overall providing higher HNP estimates than men (14. 5 % vs. 9. 1 %). Furthermore, key demographic variables im-pacted HNP estimates for both sexes: individuals who were unmarried, childless, currently unpartnered, or currently in a romantic relationship of a shorter duration provided higher HNP estimates than their counterparts, thus suggesting that such esti-mates might be attuned to mating effort and strategies, as well as relationship quality and investment...|$|E

40|$|Proposed {{amendments}} to the article 130 of Serbian Civil Code (henceforth: SCC) of 1844 regarding establishment of non-marital paternity were scrutinized in this paper. Originally, establishment of non-marital paternity was granted, but with significant restriction that presumed parent could have been declared the father of an illegitimate child only if he had recognized paternity. That {{is the reason why}} in 1855 the Supreme Court suggested amendment to the provision concerning <b>determination</b> <b>of</b> <b>paternity.</b> According to proposed modification, evidence that presumed father was on intimate terms with child's mother in the time of conception should have been sufficient for establishment of paternity. As non-marital relationships were condemned in patriarchal Serbian 19 th century society, illegitimate children were considered a product of sin and family disgrace. Hence, the Ministry of Justice, the State Council and Prince Aleksandar Karađorđević were not interested in bettering their position by widening possibilities of determination of fatherhood. Subsequently, in 1868 the amendment was passed by which non-marital paternity could not have been established by a court order, subject to certain exceptions (if one raped or abducted a woman, and the time of conception coincided with the time of abduction or rape). Since 1868 paternity could have been determined solely subject to the consent, i. e. recognition of the illegitimate father...|$|E

40|$|Abstract This article explores how the Portuguese legal system’s {{efforts to}} {{determine}} paternity of children born outside legal marriage, automatically {{initiated by the}} Registry Office when a birth registration does not indicate the father, reveal cultural models which reinforce the naturalisation {{of the differences between}} mothers and fathers, with significant effects on the social construction of parental roles and on expectations of family organisation and female sexual behaviour. The article relies on ethnographic data drawn from direct observation of court proceedings for the <b>determination</b> <b>of</b> <b>paternity,</b> as well as interviews with judges and prosecuting counsels all over the country. It is argued that judicial practices in the specific context of courtroom investigations of paternity reinforce gender inequal-ities in two interrelated ways. On the one hand, they are strengthened in the discursive practices performed {{during the course of the}} interactions between judges, prosecuting counsels and the mother of the child, as well as the alleged father. On the other hand, the normative model of family life and the dominant ideology of women’s and men’s relationships, which emphasise women’s socially subordinate position, are revealed by the selective use of DNA testing in paternity cases, based on the judge’s evaluation of the mother’s sexual behaviour. The article argues that legal attempts to establish the paternity of children born outside marriage—though based on novel technical and supposedly objective procedures—tend, nevertheless, to reproduce the prevailing patriarchal structures...|$|E
40|$|Synopsis We {{used the}} ‘‘morphology–performance–fitness’ ’ {{paradigm}} (Arnold, 1983) as our framework to investigate endocrine control {{of performance and}} fitness in Sceloporus undulatus (Eastern Fence Lizard). Focusing on males, we used the ‘‘natural experiments’ ’ of seasonal, sexual, and developmental variation in growth and in exercise endurance to identify testosterone and corticosterone as potential modulators of performance and related traits of interest. We followed with experimental manipulations of testosterone to investigate functional relationships, both in the laboratory and in the field. Further, we used focal observations and demographic studies, coupled with genetic <b>determination</b> <b>of</b> <b>paternity,</b> to test associations between performance and fitness, measured as reproductive success. We found that in males, endurance and plasma concentrations of testosterone and corticosterone are at their peaks in the spring breeding season, when lizards are most actively engaged in patrolling home ranges and in reproductive behavior. At that time, plasma concentrations of testosterone are correlated with body size; plasma concentrations of corticosterone and para-meters of home range, including area {{and the number of}} overlapped females, are correlated with home-range overlap between males and females. During prereproductive development, males (but not females) experience a maturational increase in plasma testosterone. At about the same time, they become more active, expand their home ranges, and grow less quickly than do females, suggesting a trade-off in the allocation of energy, mediated by testosterone. Experimentally, testosterone has positive effects on fitness by stimulating endurance and reproductive activity and increasing home-rang...|$|E
40|$|Recent studies {{indicate}} that polymorphic genetic markers are potentially helpful in resolving genealogical relationships among individuals in a natural population. Genetic data provide opportunities for paternity exclusion when genotypic incompatibilities are observed among individuals, and the present investigation examines the resolving power of genetic markers in unambiguous positive <b>determination</b> <b>of</b> <b>paternity.</b> Under {{the assumption that the}} mother for each offspring in a population is unambiguously known, an analytical expression for the fraction of males excluded from paternity is derived for the case where males and females may be derived from two different gene pools. This theoretical formulation {{can also be used to}} predict the fraction of births for each of which all but one male can be excluded from paternity. We show that even when the average probability of exclusion approaches unity, a substantial fraction of births yield equivocal mother-father-offspring determinations. The number of loci needed to increase the frequency of unambiguous determinations to a high level is beyond the scope of current electrophoretic studies in most species. Applications of this theory to electrophoretic data on Chamaelirium luteum (L.) shows that in 2255 offspring derived from 273 males and 70 females, only 57 triplets could be unequivocally determined with eight polymorphic protein loci, even though the average combined exclusionary power of these loci was 73 %. The distribution of potentially compatible male parents, based on multilocus genotypes, was reasonably well predicted from the allele frequency data available for these loci. We demonstrate that genetic paternity analysis in natural populations cannot be reliably based on exclusionary principles alone. In order to measure the reproductive contributions of individuals in natural populations, more elaborate likelihood principles must be deployed...|$|E
40|$|Despite early neglect, {{recent studies}} of sexual {{selection}} have shown {{a renewed interest in}} female reproductive strategies. Clearly the traditional portrayal of female animals as passive participants in mating is incorrect, but much is still unknown about female reproductive strategies, including the extent of female mate choice. The primary goal of this dissertation was to explore the role of female mate choice in mantled howling monkeys (Alouatta palliata), a species in which males have previously been assumed to control mating. From March 2006 through February 2007, I used continuous focal-animal sampling to record the behavior of adult female mantled howlers at Hacienda La Pacifica, Guanacaste, Costa Rica. The focal animals in the study were nine adult females in a social group that has been regularly monitored since 1984. There were also three capture sessions performed by K. Glander to collect blood samples for genetic paternity analysis. A total of 29 individuals in the study group and eight adult males from surrounding groups were captured. The genetic paternity analyses were largely inconclusive. Of the eight microsatellite markers used previously in this species, only four were polymorphic in this sample. Additionally, nearly half (7 of 16) of the purported mothers were excluded at one locus. Assuming the mother was unknown allowed <b>determination</b> <b>of</b> genetic <b>paternity</b> in only one case. In terms of behavior, females were largely responsible for soliciting copulations, but female mate choice {{did not appear to be}} a major factor. Females almost never rejected copulations (3. 3 % of copulation attempts) and mated with multiple males in 77. 8 % of female cycles. The lack <b>of</b> conclusive genetic <b>paternity</b> data leaves open the possibility of post-copulatory female choice. However, explanations exist for the apparent lack of female mate choice in this species. Because males must attain alpha status to remain in a group, differences in inherent quality may be low among group males. The potential for small differences among males in a social group, combined with the fact that females disperse from their natal group, suggests that female mate choice may occur primarily in choosing a group during dispersal.

Following the discovery DNA polymorphisms, particularly VNTR DNA polymorphisms, and the commercial availability of VNTR DNA probes, PLTI decided to offer this service to our clients. This study was the initial phase in the establishment of a VNTR DNA typing laboratory and covered the <b>determination</b> <b>of</b> inter-and intra-gel accuracy and precision, selection of restriction enzyme/probe combination, and evaluation and comparison of the results <b>of</b> 100 disputed <b>paternity</b> cases tested using both standard and VNTR DNA typing.
