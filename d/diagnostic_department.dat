40|$|In {{a subset}} of patients, anti tumour {{necrosis}} factor (TNF) therapeutic antibodies are immunogenic, resulting {{in the formation of}} antidrug antibodies (ADAs). Neutralising ADAs compete with TNF for its binding site and reduces the effective serum concentration, causing clinical non-response. It is however unknown to which extent ADAs are neutralising. To study which proportion of antibodies to human(ised) anti-TNF (adalimumab, golimumab, certolizumab) as well as chimeric anti-TNF (infliximab) is neutralising. Neutralising capacity of ADAs was assessed using a TNF competition assay in ADA-positive sera of patients treated with adalimumab (n= 21), golimumab (n= 4), certolizumab (n= 9) or infliximab (n= 34) sent in to our <b>diagnostic</b> <b>department.</b> In 34 sera with ADAs to adalimumab, golimumab or certolizumab, > 97 % of the antibodies were neutralising. In 34 sera with ADAs to infliximab > 90 % of the antibodies were neutralising. Further characterisation of the broader antibody response to infliximab revealed that non-neutralising antibodies to infliximab do not target murine domains, but may bind infliximab-unique domains not involved in TNF binding (located outside the paratope). Our study shows that ADAs to human(ised) as well as chimeric anti-TNF therapeutic antibodies are largely neutralising. This highly restricted ADA response suggests an immunodominant role for the paratope of anti-TNF therapeutic...|$|E
40|$|We {{determined}} the age-related prevalence of complement-fixing antibody to Mycoplasma pneumoniae from the computerized laboratory {{results of our}} routine <b>diagnostic</b> <b>department.</b> The material consisted of about 58, 000 sera from an 8 -year period, 1971 to 1978. Among children less than 1 month old, the frequency of complement-fixing antibody of titers {{greater than or equal}} to 8 was low (23 %), and no decrease representing loss of maternal antibody was seen thereafter. An unexpectedly early increase in the antibody prevalence up to 62 % was seen by 6 months of age. The frequency of antibody was high among young children from the age of 4 months, in whom symptomatic infection due to M. pneumoniae is rare. The frequency of higher titers ({{greater than or equal to}} 32) and the geometric mean titer increased more slowly, coinciding with the known age distribution of symptomatic M. pneumoniae disease; the frequency of high titers and the geometric mean titer peaked at the age of 7 to 10 years. Two explanations for the high frequency of complement-fixing antibody to M. pneumoniae in young children are discussed. It may be due to an asymptomatic infection caused by M. pneumoniae or to a nonspecific stimulus by lipids of other organisms, plants, or tissues leading to production of antibodies crossreacting with M. pneumoniae, or it may be due to both of the above. During the study, two extensive epidemics due to M. pneumoniae occurred in Finland, but the prevalence of complement-fixing antibody bore no correlation with these peaks of occurrence...|$|E
40|$|Introduction: Even {{though there}} is a high {{prevalence}} of carpal tunnel syndrome patients, there are very few reliable papers on the study of normal values and changes in sensory and motor latency parameters of the median nerve in the wrist region on the basis of age of patients. This retrospective study was on the basis of 5 years data (1998 - 2003) from the electro <b>diagnostic</b> <b>department</b> of Sh. Sadoughi teaching hospital of Yazd. Methods: In this analytic and observational study, subjects included 1200 patients referring to the electrodiagnostic clinic and also randomly selected healthy patients. Exclusion criteria included systemic diseases such as diabetes, radiculopathy of cervical spine, peripheral neuropathy, positive Phallen test or Tinel sign and atrophy in the thenar region of the hand. Subjects were divided to ten groups on the basis of age. (10 - 80 years) Sensory and motor latency parameters of median nerve were studied in each age group. All data was evaluated using SPSS statistical software and ANOVA, LSDREST curve regression tests were used for analysis. All values less than 0. 05 were considered significant. Results: In this study, normal values for distal motor latency of median nerve were between 2. 5 - 4. 2 ms with a ± 2 SD and mean value of 3. 3 ms. Increment in this value was mild (0. 1 ms per decade) after 5 th decade of life. This value was calculated using the formula: Distal motor latency: Normal value for distal sensory latency of median nerve was 2. 7 - 3. 7 ms with a ± 2 SD and mean value of 3. 2 ms. Increment in this value also was 0. 1 ms per decade after 5 th decade of life. This value was calculated by the formula: Distal sensory latency: Conclusion: It seems that age has a meaningful relationship with distal motor and sensory latencies in the wrist region and therefore in the future, electro diagnostic evaluation along with other increments in these parameters according to age should be considered when evaluating patients with carpal tunnel syndrome...|$|E

40|$|Background: Lack of {{standardised}} orbital MR protocols {{leads to}} a situation, when each institution/centre may arbitrarily choose sequence parameters. Therefore, the results obtained and published by the authors may not be compared freely, and {{what is most important}} may not be considered fully reliable. Signal intensity (IS) and T 2 time (T 2) are important parameters in estimation of inflammatory processes of extraocular muscles in the clinical practice. The aim {{of this study was to}} determine the reference values (i. e. cut-off values) for absolute signal intensity and T 2 relaxation time in healthy subjects, their relativised values to white matter (WM) and temporal muscles (TM) and to evaluate the correlation between those parameters. Material/Methods: The orbital examination was performed in healthy volunteers according to the protocol prepared in the Radiology-Imaging <b>Diagnostic</b> <b>Department</b> of the Medical University of Lodz for patients with suspected/diagnosed thyroid orbitopathy. Using two of the standard sequences IS and T 2 time were calculated for the muscles and two relativisation tissues in realtion to WM and TM. Subsequently cut-off values for healthy volunteers were calculated. Results: The differences between muscles for IS, IS MAX, IS/TM, IS/WM, IS MAX/TM, IS MAX/WM and T 2 MAX/WM were not statistically significant. Therefore one cut-off value of these parameters for all the rectus muscles was calculated. T 2 -relaxation time and T 2 relativised to white matter had to be calculated separately for each muscle. Conclusions: No statistical correlation was found between IS and T 2 -time for extraocular muscles in healthy volunteers. We calculated the reference ranges (cut-off values) for absolute IS and T 2 -time values and relativised parameters. In the clinical practice the objectification of IS and T 2 -time values should be done to WM, than to IS or T 2 of the temporal muscle. The T 2 MAX/WM seems to have the highest clinical utility for the assessment of the pathophysiological status of extraocular muscles...|$|E

40|$|The {{bachelor}} thesis named Examination of the urogenital system Radiodiagnostics Hospital Jablonec nad Nisou c. o. {{deals with}} methods of {{examination of the}} genitourinary system and creates a list and description of each method, using at these examinations. A radiology assistant is a non medical healthcare expert who uses their theoretical and practical knowledge gained during their university study {{in the fields of}} radiodiagnostics, radiotherapy and nuclear medicine. Radiology assistants are erroneously perceived both by other medical personnel and by lay public as technical workers. However, they are also medics who must be able to manipulate with highly sophisticated equipment but also provide medical care to the patients in full scale. As regards radiodiagnostics, the radiology assistants' task is to carry out the examination itself and obtain graphic documentation thereof. Radiology assistants ensure examination and handling of the equipment and they assist the doctor radiologist during more exacting intervention procedures. Radiology assistants' job is highly erudite and people working with ionising radiation must strictly abide by the laws and regulations stipulating strict rules and requirements which each radiology assistant must meet when they want to perform this activity. Radiology assistants' approach must help reduce the radiation burden of the population. It is logical, that the technological development {{goes hand in hand with}} higher examination yield and the ALARA principle is generally adhered to and applied in all examinations. If we strive to decrease the radiation dose, it is necessary to use an optimum amount of contrast agents. At the beginning of the thesis, there is a detailed description of urogenital system anatomy and physiology whose knowledge is a must when one wants to work in this field. Imaging methods described in the thesis range from the simplest ones to the most complex ones, both as regards the examination time and pursuant to specifications associated with individual examination types. The examination should be carried out from the least invasive examination procedures to the most complex ones. The methodics is based on gathering, study and subsequent analysis of the obtained data. Data from years 2009 2013 obtained at the radiodiagnostic ward of Nemocnice Jablonec nad Nisou p. o. hospital was gathered for this purpose. Investigations are divided into a number of men and women undergoing these tests. Investigative methods are compared, and evaluated that prevail, and from which they are abandoned prevail and which are being gradually abandoned. For the purpose of my thesi.
