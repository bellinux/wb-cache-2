50|$|Other factors, such as surface {{transport}} facilities and onward connections, will also affect the relative appeal of different airports and some long distance flights {{may need to}} operate from {{the one with the}} longest runway. For example, LaGuardia Airport is the preferred airport for most of Manhattan due to its proximity, while long-distance routes must use John F. <b>Kennedy</b> <b>International</b> <b>Airport's</b> longer runways.|$|R
5|$|The storm {{prompted}} the closures {{of public and}} private schools, businesses, offices, and factories throughout the Northeast. In some areasmdash&such as the city of Boston and parts of New Jerseymdash&classes were canceled for the entire week following the snowstorm. In New York City, student attendance remained extremely low in the days after schools reopened. The New York Public Library was forced to close its main location and all of its 80 branches. Non-essential government offices in Washington, D.C. were also closed because of the storm. Air and ground transportation came to a halt, with multiple major airports closed and rail service suspended. At La Guardia and Idlewild (now John F. <b>Kennedy</b> <b>International)</b> <b>airports</b> alone, over 100 flights were canceled. Railroads reported {{tens of millions of dollars}} in lost revenue and storm-related expenses.|$|R
50|$|On September 29, 1963, several Brooklyn streets {{including}} Sumner Avenue {{were turned}} into one-way streets; Sumner Avenue would become southbound only. Northbound B10 buses were rerouted onto Lewis Avenue at this time. By this time, the B10 had been extended east along Linden Boulevard to Drew Street/Elderts Lane in New Lots/Spring Creek, near the Brooklyn-Queens border. This extension had been proposed around 1960 {{to serve the}} Cypress Hills and Louis Heaton Pink public housing complexes in New Lots. The bus would serve Brooklyn General Mail Facility in Spring Creek {{when it opened in}} 1991. In 1993, the route was extended to its current terminal at John F. <b>Kennedy</b> <b>International</b> <b>Airport's</b> Terminal 4 in Jamaica, Queens. When the route was extended to Kennedy Airport it was redesignated as the B15 (the previous designation for a route between City Hall and Downtown Brooklyn) to avoid confusion with the , an existing route serving the airport, at the time operated by Green Bus Lines (now part of MTA Bus Company).|$|R

5000|$|Business Express {{embarked}} {{a significant}} route and fleet expansion beginning in 1993, although its facilities at hub <b>airports</b> Boston Logan <b>International</b> <b>Airport,</b> and New York City's LaGuardia and John F. <b>Kennedy</b> <b>International</b> <b>airports</b> {{were unable to}} effectively accommodate the influx in passenger boardings and aircraft movements. In May 1995, the carrier inaugurated a major expansion and renovation of its primary passenger hub at Boston Logan. Negotiated as a direct lease with Massport, this long-awaited facilities upgrade substantially increased gate and ramp space in the [...] "C" [...] concourse. Enhancements included improved Americans with Disabilities Act compliance, new airside elevators, upgraded signage, and refurbishment of all passenger lounge areas. Gatehouse expansion allowed the airline to reduce remote bus boardings, whereby 80 percent of the airline's daily departures were serviced directly from the terminal. Service was increased to both Bangor and Portland in Maine utilizing Avro RJ-70 jets and Saab 340 aircraft. Additional round-trip service was added between Boston Logan and Washington National Airport, bringing {{the total number of}} roundtrips to five daily, in addition to Delta's three mainline flights. At this time, Business Express was Boston's largest airline, operating 158 daily departures.|$|R
50|$|The {{mobile lounge}} is used at Washington Dulles <b>International</b> <b>Airport</b> in Washington, D.C. and at Montréal-Pierre Elliott Trudeau <b>International</b> <b>Airport</b> Montreal. The system {{was also used}} at Montreal Mirabel <b>International</b> <b>Airport,</b> John F. <b>Kennedy</b> <b>International</b> <b>Airport's</b> <b>International</b> Terminal in New York City, Mexico City Airport until 2007, and Charles de Gaulle Airport in Paris before the 1990s and at King Abdulaziz <b>International</b> <b>Airport</b> in Jeddah until 1994. While it is still used at Dulles Airport, the growth in {{passenger}} ridership made it impractical to use mobile lounges for individual flights. Remote concourses were constructed, and the fleet of mobile lounges {{was used as a}} shuttle between the concourses and the main terminal. On January 26, 2010, the MWAA replaced the Dulles mobile lounge system for passenger movements between the Main Terminal and the A-, B-, and C-Gates with the underground AeroTrain. However, some mobile lounges and plane mates remain in use for passenger movements between the main terminal and Concourse D (until the replacement Concourses C and D are built and the AeroTrain is built out to run in a continuous two-way loop), to disembark international passengers from all arriving international aircraft (with the exception of United Airlines and certain Star Alliance flights, which are directly serviced at Concourse C's Federal Inspection Station; and flights from airports with border preclearance) and carry them to the International Arrivals Building, and to convey passengers between the main terminal and aircraft on hard standing (i.e., those parked remotely on the tarmac without access to jet bridges).|$|R
40|$|A {{study to}} assess the noise-induced {{building}} vibrations associated with Concorde operations is presented. The approach is to record the levels of induced vibrations and associated indoor/outdoor noise levels in selected homes, historic and other buildings near Dulles and <b>Kennedy</b> <b>International</b> <b>Airports.</b> Presented is a small, representative sample of data recorded at Sully Plantation, Chantilly, Virginia {{during the period of}} May 20 through May 28, 1976. Recorded data provide relationships between the vibration levels of walls, floors, windows, and the noise associated with Concorde operations (2 landings and 3 takeoffs), other aircraft, nonaircraft sources, and normal household activities. Results suggest that building vibrations resulting from aircraft operations were proportional to the overall sound pressure levels and relatively insensitive to spectral differences associated with the different types of aircraft. Furthermore, the maximum levels of vibratory response resulting from Concorde operations were higher than those associated with conventional aircraft. The vibrations of nonaircraft events were observed in some cases to exceed the levels resulting from aircraft operations. These nonaircraft events are currently being analyzed in greater detail...|$|R
5|$|The {{aircraft}} {{arrived at}} John F. <b>Kennedy</b> <b>International</b> <b>Airport</b> at around 4:00 pm EDT and taxied {{to a remote}} part of the runway. A three-man hostage negotiation team had been assembled in the air traffic control tower. NYPD detective Dominick Misino spoke with Demeke over the radio, assisted by FBI special agent John Flood and Port Authority detective sergeant Carmine Spano. After 70 minutes of negotiation, Demeke traded his pistol for the pilot's sunglasses and surrendered peacefully to authorities. All 94 passengers and ten crew were unharmed.|$|E

25|$|NY 878, the Nassau Expressway, was {{originally}} planned in 1945 as a freeway between the Belt Parkway in Queens and Long Beach in Nassau.

The short freeway portion in Queens {{was originally}} built as part of Interstate 78 (I-78) in the late 1960s, but the segment of I-78 through New York City was canceled in March 1971 due to community opposition. Through the 1970s, the entire freeway south of 150th Street was also canceled for various reasons. A scaled-down version of the road in Nassau County, a 4-lane arterial road, was completed in 1990. There has been an attempt to complete the freeway in Queens, but it was deferred due to the early 1990s economic recession.|$|R

East of the Briarwood station, there were additional trackways built for an extension down Van Wyck Boulevard (today the Van Wyck Expressway) to Rockaway Boulevard, near the current site of John F. <b>Kennedy</b> <b>International</b> <b>Airport.</b> None of these proposals were ever funded, and only the Briarwood bellmouths were used for future expansion, while the Rockaway line was connected instead to the IND Fulton Street Line.|$|E
5|$|After peak intensity, Gloria {{weakened}} while {{turning to}} the north, moving around {{the western end of}} the ridge, toward a cold front. By September 26, the winds had decreased to 90 mph (150 km/h), just 30 hours after its peak intensity. Later that day, a buoy about 60 mi (100 km) east of the center recorded a wave height of 46.9 ft (14.3 m), which at the time was the highest buoy wave recording in an Atlantic hurricane. While accelerating toward North Carolina, Gloria re-intensified slightly to winds of 105 mph (165 km/h), making it a Category 2 hurricane. At 0530 UTC on September 27, the hurricane struck southern Hatteras Island in the Outer Banks. After weakening further, Gloria passed just east of the Delmarva Peninsula and New Jersey and interacted with a cold front. Its strongest winds remained on {{the eastern edge of the}} circulation, and the storm was gradually losing tropical characteristics.

5|$|From 1993 to 2006, Biman {{operated}} {{flights to}} John F. <b>Kennedy</b> <b>International</b> <b>Airport,</b> New York City, from Dhaka via Brussels. New York was Biman's farthest and most prestigious destination, and was kept operational despite heavy financial losses {{to maintain a}} landing slot in the US which, if cancelled, could be difficult to regain. To curb the losses, Biman reduced the service to one flight per week and re-routed it through Manchester Airport, UK, capitalising on travel demands from the expatriate Bangladeshi community {{in the north of}} England. On 8 April 2006, Biman's inaugural flight to Manchester landed at Manchester Airport en route to JFK. However, the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) had placed the Civil Aviation Authority of Bangladesh (CAAB) into Category 2 (does not meet International Civil Aviation Organization standards) according to its International Aviation Safety Assessment Program, which placed additional restrictions on the country's airlines when flying to the US. A former CAAB assistant director made scathing remarks about the CAAB in an opinion article in the Aviatour, a monthly travel and tourism supplement of Bangladeshi news magazine Weekly Holiday. For Biman, this meant that it could continue flying to the US, but could not expand or make alterations to its routes, such as changing the transit from Brussels to Manchester. The FAA fined Biman for breaching its rules, and flights to New York were again re-routed through Brussels.|$|E
