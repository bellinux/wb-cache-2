A key factor of success in practicing good corporate governance is the board’s {{ability to cope with}} paradox. The purpose of this research has been to explore the core corporate governance dilemmas facing boards. The investigation was qualitative in nature using the Delphi technique. Six core corporate governance dilemmas <b>facing</b> <b>board</b> members were identified one of which is not mentioned in the international literature.

40|$|The Delaware General Assembly has {{recently}} adopted {{an amendment to}} the Delaware General Corporation Law which provides that where shareholders have adopted a majority voting bylaw for corporate elections over the traditional plurality scheme, a corporation may not subsequently amend its bylaws to return to plurality voting without shareholder approval. I will compare this provision to other approaches and try to explain the reasons underlying its adoption. I will also briefly summarize the evolving shareholder empowerment debate and analyze the majority voting provision in the context of that discussion. I will describe some unique and unanticipated interactions between majority voting bylaws and various other working parts of corporation and securities law affecting the shareholder franchise, a carefully protected right in Delaware jurisprudence. The most prevalent corporate strategies responding to this movement will be explored and the difficulties of implementing majority voting will be described. Finally, I will analyze voting schemes from the political sphere in an attempt to find analogous lessons for the corporate arena. I will then end with some predictions about future developments which will hinge on the outcome of SEC rules proposals, further DGCL revisions, and the responses of Delaware incorporated entities. This piece blends three distinct groups of thought: i) Theoretical corporate law scholarship and financial regulatory theory, ii) Interpretation of Delaware Chancery Court cases, and iii) Practical analysis {{on the future of the}} majority voting movement and the strategic choices <b>facing</b> <b>board</b> of directors in the aftermath of the Delaware amendments and corollary SEC and NYSE regulatory initiatives...|$|E

A key factor of success in practicing good corporate governance is the board‟s {{ability to cope with}} paradox. The purpose of this research has been to explore the core corporate governance dilemmas <b>facing</b> <b>boards.</b> Furthermore, {{the purpose of the study}} was to determine best practice for managing paradox in the context of corporate governance. The investigation was qualitative in nature. Content analysis was done on the results and the constructs identified by sample respondents were compared to the literature. The main finding was that there are six core corporate governance dilemmas <b>facing</b> <b>boards</b> and that boards require specific competencies in order to cope with these dilemmas. Eight competencies were identified. These findings were summarised in a model that provides a consolidated view of the core corporate governance dilemmas and of what competencies of the board contribute to coping with these dilemmas. The model provides a tool for directors wishing to shape their boards to manage paradox and specific core corporate governance dilemmas facing them...|$|R

40|$|Research {{that applies}} agency theory to boards of {{directors}} suffers from being quite narrow as it does not recognize the true legal relationships between directors, managers and shareholders. Instead, {{the board of directors}} is best conceptualized as the principal, management as agents and stockholders’ relationships as a mix of legal and implicit contracts. I propose a recast agency relationship and develop a contingency approach that proposes (1) how a corporation’s goals vary with a board’s implicit contracting and (2) a reconceptualization of the agency problem <b>facing</b> <b>boards...</b>|$|R

40|$|The {{challenge}} for boards {{is to prevent}} crises in the organisations they govern. Performance evaluation is a key means by which boards can recognise and correct corporate governance problems and add real value to their organisations. Our paper provides a practical introduction to board and director evaluations. We discuss the reasons for governance failures and how board evaluations can help prevent them from occurring. We then review the performance pressures <b>facing</b> <b>boards</b> {{and the benefits of}} board evaluations in meeting these pressures. Finally, we introduce our framework for a successful board and/or individual director evaluation, whatever the company type. In this framework, we suggest there are seven key questions to consider when planning a board evaluation and discuss each of these seven decision areas.

This street is the glory and beauty of this city: it is the {{broadest}} street (except in the Low Countries, where there is a navigable channel in middle of the street) and the longest street I have seen, which begins at the palace, the gate whereof enters straight into the suburbs, and is placed at the lower end of the same. The suburbs make an handsome street; and indeed the street, if the houses, which are very high, and substantially built of stone (some five, some six stories high), were not lined to the outside and <b>faced</b> with <b>boards,</b> it were the most stately and graceful street that ever I saw in my life; but this <b>face</b> of <b>boards,</b> which is towards the street, doth much blemish it, and derogate from glory and beauty; as also the want of fair glass windows, whereof few or none are to be discerned towards the street, which is the more complete, because it is as straight as may be. This lining with boards (wherein are round holes shaped to the proportion of men's heads), and this encroachment into the street about two yards, is a mighty disgrace unto it, for the walls (which were the outside) are stone; so, as if this outside <b>facing</b> of <b>boards</b> were removed, and the houses built uniform all of the same height, it were the most complete street in Christendom.|$|R
