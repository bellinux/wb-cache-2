40|$|OBJECTIVE [...] To {{determine}} if subclinical hepatotoxicity {{is associated with}} exposure to perchloroethylene at concentrations commonly experienced in the workplace, and whether surveillance with serum <b>hepatic</b> <b>transaminase</b> activity underestimates such effects. METHODS [...] Hepatic parenchymal echogenicity on ultrasonography and serum <b>hepatic</b> <b>transaminase</b> activity were compared in 29 community based dry cleaning operators exposed to perchloroethylene, and a control group of 29 non-exposed laundry workers. Perchloroethylene exposure was assessed by work history and air monitoring. RESULTS [...] Mean <b>hepatic</b> <b>transaminase</b> activities were minimally increased in dry cleaners compared with laundry workers. Increased alanine aminotransferase activities, between 1. 0 and 1. 5 times the normal limits, were found in five of 27 (19 %) dry cleaners compared with one of 26 (4 %) laundry workers. In contrast, diffuse parenchymal changes in echogenicity, as determined by hepatic ultrasonography, were increased nearly twofold in dry cleaners, occurring in 18 of 27 (67 %) dry cleaners compared with 10 of 26 (39 %) laundry workers (P < 0. 05), and were most strongly associated with increased perchloroethylene exposure in older dry to dry or wet transfer operations (odds ratio 4. 2, 95 % confidence interval 1. 1 - 15. 3). Mean eight hour time weighted average perchloroethylene exposure for dry cleaners was 16 ppm, which {{is less than the}} permissible exposure limit of 100 ppm in the United States. CONCLUSIONS [...] It was concluded that mild to moderate hepatic parenchymal changes occur more frequently in workers exposed to perchloroethylene than in populations not exposed to chemical solvents, and that these effects are underestimated by serum <b>hepatic</b> <b>transaminase</b> activity...|$|E

Forty-two Wistar male rats were distributed into seven groups of six animals that received diets supplemented with 1 % cholesterol and 0. 3 % cholic acid, with the exception of the control group, which received conventional diets. Animals were treated with oral suspensions containing: atorvastatin 1. 0 mg/kg; H. dulcisextract at 50. 0 and 100. 0 mg/kg and dihydromyricetin at 25. 0 and 50. 0 mg/kg vehicle (control group).

Aim: To characterize the clinical, serological and histological liver damage among incidentally detected asymptomatic hepatitis B surface antigen (HBsAg) -positive subjects (IDAHS) in Egypt. Methods: We prospectively studied 70 consecutive IDAHS patients. Tests for liver function, serological markers for HBV, HCV, HDV and schistosomiasis were performed for all patients. HBV DNA {{was determined by the}} branched DNA technique and PCR. Liver biopsy specimens from 44 patients were studied and scored for activity and fibrosis stage by modified Knodell score and the METAVIR score. HBsAg and HBcAg were immunohistochemically evaluated in the liver tissue. Results: Of the studied 70 patients, 57 (81. 6 %) were HBeAg-negative and 13 (18. 4 %) were HBeAg-positive. <b>Hepatic</b> <b>transaminases</b> in HBeAg-positive patients were significantly elevated when compared to HBeAg-negative patients.

40|$|Background Little {{progress}} has been made to identify the central neuroendocrine pathway involved in the energy intake control in nonalcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) patients. Objective To assess the influence of orexigenic neuropeptides in the nutritional aspects of NAFLD obese adolescents submitted to a long-term interdisciplinary approach. Methods Fifty adolescents aged 15 - 19 years, with body mass index at least 95 th percentile, consisting of 25 patients without NAFLD and 25 with NAFLD. The NAFLD diagnosis was determined by ultrasonography. Blood samples were collected to analyze glycemia, <b>hepatic</b> <b>transaminases,</b> and lipid profile. Insulin resistance was estimated by Homeostasis Model Assessment Insulin Resistance Index. Neuropeptide Y (NPY) and agouti related protein concentrations were measured by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay. Analyses of food intake were made by 3 days recordatory inquiry. Results At baseline conditions, the patients with NAFLD had significantly higher values of body mass, body mass index, visceral fat, triglycerides, VLDL-C, and <b>hepatic</b> <b>transaminases.</b> After the long-term intervention, they presented a significant reduction in these parameters. In both the groups, it was observed a significant decrease in energy intake, macronutrients and dietetic cholesterol. Only the patients with NAFLD presented a positive correlation between the saturated fatty acids intake and the orexigenic neuropeptides NPY and agouti related protein, and carbohydrate with NPY. Indeed, it was observed a positive correlation between energy intake, lipid (%) and saturated fatty acids with visceral fat accumulation. Conclusion Our findings showed an important influence of diet composition in the orexigenic system, being essential consider that the excessive saturated fatty acids intake could be a determinant factor to increase nonalcoholic fatty liver disease.

Though elevations in liver function tests are often transient and asymptomatic, there are many reported cases of clozapine-induced hepatotoxicity, with damage to the liver, involvement of multiple organs, and even fulminant liver failure arising with moderate clozapine doses. This case report describes a Chinese woman who developed hepatotoxicity on a low dose of clozapine, and reviews the relevant literature.

40|$|Statins are {{the revolutionary}} {{drugs in the}} {{cardiovascular}} pharmacotherapy. But they also possess several adverse effects like myopathy with elevation of <b>hepatic</b> <b>transaminases</b> (> 3 times the upper limit of normal) or creatine kinase (> 10 times the upper limit of normal) and some rare side-effects, including peripheral neuropathy, memory loss, sleep disturbances, and erectile dysfunction. Due to these adverse effects, patients abruptly withdrew statins without consulting physicians. This abrupt discontinuation of statins is termed as statin intolerance. Statin-induced myopathy constitutes two third of all side-effects from statins and is {{the primary reason for}} statin intolerance. Though statin intolerance has considerably impacted cardiovascular outcomes in the high-risk patients, it has been well effectively managed by prescribing statins either as alternate-day or once weekly dosage regimen, as combination therapy with a non-statin therapy or and by dietary intervention. The present article reviews the causes, clinical implications of statin withdrawal and management of statin intolerance...|$|R
40|$|Treatment of latent Mycobacterium {{tuberculosis}} {{infection with}} isoniazid can cause hepatotoxicity, but {{the risk of}} isoniazid-associated hepatotoxicity among persons coinfected with hepatitis C virus (HCV) is unknown. We conducted a prospective study among 146 injection drug users with M. tuberculosis infection and normal baseline <b>hepatic</b> <b>transaminase</b> values who were treated with isoniazid. Of 146 participants, 138 (95 %) were HCV-seropositive. Thirty-seven participants (25 %) were human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) –seropositive. Thirty-two (22 %; 95 % confidence interval [CI], 16 %– 30 %) of 146 participants developed transaminase value elevations to 13 times the upper limit of normal. Transaminase value elevation was associated with concurrent alcohol use but not with race, age, presence of hepatitis B surface antigen, HIV- 1 infection, or current injection drug use. Isoniazid was withdrawn from 11 participants (8 %; 95 % CI, 4 %– 13 %). Of 8 deaths during follow-up, none were attributed to isoniazid-associated hepatotoxicity. The risk of transaminase value elevation and drug discontinuation for HCV-infected persons receiving isoniazid was within the range reported for popu-lations with lower HCV prevalence. Injection drug users {{are at increased risk}} of developin...|$|E
40|$|The {{objective}} {{of this study is}} to evaluate the effect of the daily consumption of ostrich meat (lliofemuralis internus) and bovine meat (Psoas major) on the lipid metabolism in adult mice. The analyses of the centesimal composition of the meats and preparation of the diets were accomplished following the recommendations of the American Institute of Nutrition-AIN- 93. Three groups of 150 day-old animals: group I (diet I, with casein), group II (diet II, with ostrich meat), and group III (diet III with bovine meat) were fed for 13 weeks with the respective diets and weight gain, food efficiency coefficient, total cholesterol, lipoprotein fractions, hepatic, transaminases and body fat percentage and hepatic fat content were evaluated. No difference (p < 0. 05) it was found for weight gain and coefficients for feed efficiency among the groups. Total cholesterol, HDL-cholesterol, LDL-cholesterol, relationship of total cholesterol/HDL-cholesterol, VLDL, triglycerides and hepatic transaminases were also not different among the groups (p < 0. 05). This research suggests that the consumption of ostrich meat or thin bovine meat on a daily basis does not raise concerns about weight gain, and an increase in the plasma concentrations of lipoprotein and levels of <b>hepatic</b> <b>transaminase...</b>|$|E
40|$|The {{occurrence}} of clinical and biochemical {{side effects of}} bezafibrate (400 mg daily) or simvastatin (20 mg daily) alone or combined was appraised in 13 healthy male normolipidemic subjects according to a single blind design. Each period of 2 weeks of treatment with bezafibrate or simvastatin or bezafibrate plus simvastatin {{was followed by a}} period of placebo (1 week). No subjects experienced myalgia or muscle weakness. Plasma creatine kinase (CK) elevations, particularly skeletal muscle CK (CK-MM), were observed in 6 subjects: 11 times during different placebo periods, 5 times on bezafibrate, 4 times on simvastatin, and 4 times on combined bezafibrate-simvastatin, but never reached 1, 600 IU/L. Only a trend to an increase of CK mean values on combined bezafibrate-simvastatin was shown. The <b>hepatic</b> <b>transaminase</b> and gamma-glutamyltransferase activities remained unmodified throughout the trial, unlike alkaline phosphatase activity, which fell on bezafibrate and on bezafibrate plus simvastatin. The low-density lipoprotein cholesterol level was more reduced with simvastatin than with bezafibrate. The addition of bezafibrate to simvastatin did not decrease it further. Lecithin:cholesterol acyltransferase activity expressed as fractional esterification rate was enhanced only on simvastatin and bezafibrate-simvastatin...|$|E
40|$|Murine typhus occurs {{relatively}} commonly {{in southern}} Texas, {{as well as}} in California. We reviewed records of 90 adults and children in whom murine typhus was diagnosed during a 3 -year period in 2 hospitals in southern Texas, USA. Most patients lacked notable comorbidities; all were immunocompetent. Initial signs and symptoms included fever (99 %), malaise (82 %), headache (77 %), fatigue (70 %), myalgias (68 %), and rash (39 %). Complications, often severe, in 28 % of patients included bronchiolitis, pneumonia, meningitis, septic shock, cholecystitis, pancreatitis, myositis, and rhabdomyolysis; the last 3 are previously unreported in murine typhus. Low serum albumin and elevated procalcitonin, consistent with bacterial sepsis, were observed in > 70 % of cases. Rash was more common in children; thrombocytopenia, hyponatremia, elevated <b>hepatic</b> <b>transaminases,</b> and complications were more frequent in adults. Murine typhus should be considered as a diagnostic possibility in cases of acute febrile illness in southern and even in more northern US states. 28726607 PMC 554780...|$|R
50|$|Frequent {{side effects}} of {{papaverine}} treatment include polymorphic ventricular tachycardia, constipation, interference with sulphobromophthalein retention test (used to determine <b>hepatic</b> function), increased <b>transaminase</b> levels, increased alkaline phosphatase levels, somnolence, and vertigo.|$|R
40|$|Antibody-targeted {{chemotherapy}} is {{a promising}} approach {{in patients with}} hematological malignancies. In particular, gemtuzumab ozogamicin (GO, formerly CMA- 676), an anti-CD 33 antibody linked to calicheamicin, has been approved {{for the treatment of}} elderly patients with acute myeloid leukemia (AML) in relapse. Nevertheless, no data are until now available concerning the possible efficacy of GO for myeloid sarcomas (MS). We treated with GO 24 AML patients, in 5 cases presenting with myeloid sarcomas of the skin or bones. The overall complete response rate was 21 %. The median duration of response was 6 months. Four out of the 5 patients with myeloid sarcoma showed a regression of the masses, in two cases also obtaining a clearance of marrow blasts. The most common adverse events included thrombocytopenia, neutropenia, infections, elevation of bilirubin and <b>hepatic</b> <b>transaminases.</b> Notably, severe bleeding occurred in 5 cases (21 %). VOD was documented in 1 case. We conclude that GO is effective as a single agent in AML and myeloid sarcomas. Further data are required to clarify the possible correlation between GO administration and occurrence of bleeding...|$|R
