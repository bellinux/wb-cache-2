500|$|In December 2009, Gaga {{revealed}} that {{she planned to}} cancel {{the concept of the}} original shows of The Monster Ball Tour and start afresh. She felt that the revamp of the show was needed as the original tour was constructed in a very short span of time. Gaga recalled that after West and she split up for this tour, she was unsure if she could get a show together in time, but nevertheless wanted to promote The Fame Monster. Hence she was able to put together [...] "something that, in truth, I never would have done if I had a longer amount of time". The revamp of the tour was planned from the arena shows in the United Kingdom from February 2010. [...] "My team thinks I'm completely psychotic. But I don't fucking care what they think. [...] Well, <b>just</b> <b>to</b> <b>give</b> <b>you</b> an idea, the stage is about four {{times the size of the}} one we're on now and conceptually, it's completely different. One thing that has been lost over the past 10-15 years, in pop music, is the idea of showbiz. And this is definitely going to bring that back", clarified Gaga. According to James Montgomery of MTV, the show recalled the film musicals The Wizard of Oz (1939) and West Side Story (1961), the science-fiction film Metropolis (1927), and the television mini-series Angels in America (2003).|$|E

I think this program really had its origins in the Air Force. 1970 to 1972 was a good period, particularly 1970, when you had the crash of the F 111 and a major increase in concern about the safety of aircraft structures. A lot of things changed and, basically, what happened was that there was the recognition that nondestructive evaluation or nondestructive inspection had to change from simply the problem of detection to the problem of measurement in order to incorporate fracture mechanics into life prediction. It changed from a zero-defects philosophY to a damage-tolerant philosophy...|$|R

60|$|The {{master of}} the workhouse is not, in our parish—nor is he usually in any other—one of that class of men {{the better part of}} whose {{existence}} has passed away, and who drag out the remainder in some inferior situation, with just enough thought of the past, to feel degraded by, and discontented with the present. We are unable to guess precisely to our own satisfaction what station the man can have occupied before; we should think he had been an inferior sort of attorney’s clerk, or else the master of a national school—whatever he was, it is clear his present position is a change for the better. His income is small certainly, as the rusty black coat and threadbare velvet collar demonstrate: but then he lives free of house-rent, has a limited allowance of coals and candles, and an almost unlimited allowance of authority in his petty kingdom. He is a tall, thin, bony man; always wears shoes and black cotton stockings with his surtout; and eyes you, as you pass his parlour-window, as if he wished you were a pauper, <b>just</b> <b>to</b> <b>give</b> <b>you</b> a specimen of his power. He is an admirable specimen of a small tyrant: morose, brutish, and ill-tempered; bullying to his inferiors, cringing to his superiors, and jealous of the influence and authority of the beadle.|$|E

5000|$|Few {{details were}} {{publicly}} known about Wright's pioneering career until {{he wrote a}} few vignettes about that period on his web site for [...] "The Diamond Appraised Baseball Column" [...] that he wrote for three years. They currently remain available in the biography section on Wright {{in relation to the}} radio show A Page from Baseball's Past. Of particular interest is the very different take he has on those early days of sabermetrics in major league baseball that is quite at odds with the theme in Michael Lewis's Moneyball. Lewis portrayed the early practitioners within the game as simply being ignored. Wright acknowledges that very few teams back then were adding such a perspective, and that the general usage was at times on a small scale, but he makes a strong case that there were pockets where it was not only valued but had real impact. He gives interesting examples from his career and he scores a key point with his question: [...] "All my contracts were 1-year contracts. Do you really think teams are going to keep shelling out the money year after year <b>just</b> <b>to</b> have <b>you</b> <b>give</b> advice that they will ignore?" ...|$|R

50|$|Kossmann was {{considered}} a writer with a refined style, and an erudite scholar. His intellectual outlook was sceptical, ironical, detached. He published several books in collaboration with his wife Johanna Kossmann-Putto. In an interview in 2007, his former student Frank Ankersmit gives a description of him:He had an unusually strong and fascinating personality -- I never met anyone even remotely coming close {{to what he was}} like. <b>Just</b> <b>to</b> <b>give</b> <b>you</b> an idea: he was all that one might associate with François Guizot, very much aloof, very intelligent, both impossible to get close to and yet very much accessible and blessed with the rhetorical powers of a Pericles. If he had decided for a political career, the recent history of my country would have been completely different from what it is now. It rarely happened, but if he really felt that this was necessary he could raise a rhetorical storm blowing away everything and everybody. Indeed, when thinking of him, I never am sure what impressed me most, his scholarship or his personality. He was a truly wonderful man.|$|E

25|$|Though it isn't {{much of a}} refrain as most of Redding's {{version is}} made up of shorter verses, this line appears as a {{conclusion}} to every verse and echoes into the next line tying it all together. Redding's short refrain comes {{at the end of each}} verse and leads into the next. “Redding’s version is characteristically funky, with his raspy-soulful singing and electric vocal charisma front and center.” His song utilizes “playful horns and sexy, mock-beleaguered vocals” to deliver lyrics without any subtext. The message of a man demanding respect from his woman for being the breadwinner is decisively clear. Redding's version was written from the perspective of a hardworking man who can only look forward to getting home and finally receiving the respect he deserves from his family. His version is less a plea for respect and more a comment on a man's feeling of worth in his work life and at home. He mentions that he’s “about <b>to,</b> <b>just</b> <b>give</b> <b>you</b> all of my money,” and that all he wants in return is respect. The woman he is singing to can even “do me wrong, honey, if you wanna to/You can do me wrong honey, while I'm gone.” The lyrics are repetitive and straightforward throughout the song; there isn’t any layering of messages or intentions.|$|R
5000|$|Early in 1972, the Beach Boys {{announced}} {{that they would be}} finishing Smile to follow up on the critical and commercial success of Surf's Up. By the end of the year, the idea was either abandoned or forgotten, with Brian refusing to participate in any further Smile-related reworkings, leading the group to pay a $50,000 fine. Later in the 1970s, Bruce Johnston said that an assembled release of Smile would be a [...] "bad idea" [...] commercially. He expounded that its release could only satisfy a highly-niche audience, deeming the material too inaccessible for mainstream record-buyers, and explained, [...] "Sometimes, you're kind of let down. Say you discover the tapes and you say, 'Oh yeah?' It's been talked about so much…It would live up to your expectations only if you were Zubin Mehta analyzing a young composer's work." [...] In 1981, Johnston {{announced that}} there were plans to issue a brief six-minute compilation of the album's recording sessions without Brian's knowledge. He reasoned, [...] "It's better to do it that way, because musically now, as opposed to '66 or '78, it would be more interesting <b>to</b> <b>just</b> <b>give</b> <b>you</b> a peek at it than to do the whole thing. There's been too much press on it. It's like talking about bringing out the '67 Rolls Royce and they finally show it in '81. You go, 'Oh, no.'" ...|$|R
40|$|My first {{experience}} with Depo-Provera was as a young welfare mother. I had just finished my first post-partum check-up after having had my second child. The doctor pronounced me in great health and then pulled out a syringe and a vial. I am <b>just</b> going <b>to</b> <b>give</b> <b>you</b> a shot so that you won't {{have to worry about}} getting pregnant again. She smiled. I asked her what was in the vial and she {{told me that it was}} like the pill, but that I didn't have to worry about remembering to take it every day. I was assured that Depo-Provera was safe, but I was breastfeeding and didn't want to take even an aspirin. When I refused the shot, the doctor became visibly angry with me. She stopped making even the most rudimentary conversation, scribbled something on my chart and left, but not before heaving an exasperated sigh and slamming the vial and syringe into a tray on the counter. I was scared of this doctor and her power over me. Could she call Department of Social Services and have my baby taken away? Could she make it so I couldn't come to the free clinic any more? I wasn't taking any chances so I never returned for my other post-natal checkups. It was months later that other questions surfaced in my mind: Is there an antidote if you take Depo-Provera and have a bad reaction? What kind of research has been done on this drug? Why didn't the doctor talk to me about condoms or any other kind of birth control? Did every woman get the same treatment? How much harder would it have been to say no if I didn't speak English, or if I was an uncertain teenager, or if the doctor had been just a little more pushy? Paradoxically, I ended up taking Depo-Provera anyways. Several years later, as a college student close to graduation and fearful of getting pregnant, I chose to try Depo-Provera through my college clinic. My doctor and I had a great rapport and she answered every Depo-Provera question with thoughtfulness and impartiality. However, on Depo-Provera, I became depressed, fat, irritable, and uninterested in sex. My loss of libido while on Depo-Provera was so great that it seemed only natural when I found out that it is routinely used as a chemical castration agent to suppress the libidos of male sex offenders...|$|R
