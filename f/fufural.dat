40|$|For {{a variety}} of applications, we are {{analyzing}} wood types by a standardized approach of Curie-Point pyrolysis (CP) and thermovaporization (TV), both coupled with gas chromatography-mass spectrometry {{in order to establish}} a chemical reference data base (CP+TV Wood Data Base). At the present stage, we can report the following criteria for qualitative and quantitative differentiations of individual wood types. Generally, all wood types investigated exhibit very characteristic relative intensity patterns of individual compounds which enable a distinctive chemical diagnosis and biological assignment. Bark samples can easily be related to their corresponding heart wood, which means that bark is composed of the same wood type specific, principal chemical building blocks, but with different relative concentrations [1]. Even (bio-) degraded wood and even lichen covered barks exhibit characteristic, specific wood type compounds [1]. Comparisons between CP and microscopic analyses for pine wood embedded in a peat matrix of moss (Sphagnum, Polytrichum, Brown Mosses), grasses (Carex, Eriophorum) and blueberry (Vaccinium) reveal that down to less than 1 % of wood can be verified [2], [3]. Coniferous wood: predominant compounds are <b>fufural,</b> guaiacol, ethylguaiacol, vinylguaiacol, isoeugenol, vanillin and benzenediol. These compounds are present in all conifereous woods with exception of fir (no <b>fufural)</b> and Kauri (no guaiacol). High concentrations of 1, 4 -benzenediol occur in pine, juniper, redwood, fir, spruce and yellowwood, of guaiacol in fir, of <b>fufural</b> and of vinylphenol in Kauri and of propiovanillone in one Rimu wood. Broadleaf wood: the most prominent compound is (hydroxymethyl) phenoxy propane- 2 -one. Vinylguaiacol is strongly reduced in comparison to coniferous wood. Other compounds like syringol, 4 -methylsyringol, syringaldehyde and 4 -methylguaiacol are very prominent, too. Based on the distinct differentiation potential of the CP+TV Wood Data base, we see a wide application range. Beside others, these are the fields of archaeology (e. g. artefacts, shipbuilding, restauration), ecology (e. g. environmental estimations by paleophytocoenosis reconstruction [3], paleobotany (e. g. genetic relationship of recent to fossil wood [1]), biology (e. g. recognition of tree diseases) and the differentiation of plantation wood and wood from primeval forest for various commercial users.

40|$|Woodworking {{industry}} residues {{often do}} not find proper utilisation and are heaping up or used as a fuel at best. One of the feasibilities of the appropriate use of this out-of-demand but yet valuable raw material is to produce furfural, acetic acid and activated carbon. Since such a unified processing scheme is almost unexplored, our intention was to study the main parameters of the process. Birch wood veneer shorts were chosen as a starting raw material. It contained 72. 2 % polysaccharides, including 29. 9 % of easy-hydrolysable polysaccharides; the potential <b>fufural</b> yield was 15. 3 % on the o. d. wood basis. Therefore, {{the impact of the}} catalyst (concentrated sulphuric acid) was studied to elucidate the optimum conditions to ensure a high yield of furfural and lignocellulose with appropriate properties for obtaining of the activated carbon. Changing the amount of the catalyst, the furfural and lignocellulose yields varied from 6. 3 to 8. 9 % and from 70. 9 to 60. 3 % on the o. d. wood basis, respectively. Furfural and acetic acid are obtained by catalytic prehydrolysis of hardwood residues; 2 / 3 of the left-over lignocellulose is used as a fuel in a boiler house and the rest 1 / 3 as a raw material for carbon production. The novel technology of processing fine-grained hardwood residues is environmentally friendly and energetically self-sufficien...|$|E
40|$|In this paper, {{pyrolysis}} of pine wood sawdust {{was carried}} out by microwave heating at ca. 470 degrees C under dynamic nitrogen atmosphere. Eight inorganic additives (NaOH, Na 2 CO 3, Na 2 SiO 3, NaCl, TiO 2, HZSM- 5, H 3 PO 4, Fe- 2 (SO 4) (3)) were investigated in terms of their catalytic effects on the pyrolysis. All of the eight additives have increased yields of solid products greatly and decreased yields of gaseous products more or less. Yields of liquid products have not subjected to dramatic change. The incondensable gases produced from pyrolysis consist mainly of H- 2, CH 4, CO and CO 2. All of the eight additives have made these gases evolve earlier, among which the four sodium additives have the most marked effect. All the additives have made the amount of CH 4 and CO 2 decrease, while all of them except NaCl, TiO 2 and Fe- 2 (SO 4) (3) have made that of H- 2 increase and all of them except Na 2 SiO 3 and HZSM- 5 have made that of CO decrease. Alkaline sodium compounds NaOH, Na 2 CO 3 and Na 2 SiO 3 favor H- 2 formation most. The most abundant organic component in the liquid products from pyrolysis of untreated sample and samples treated by all the additives except H 3 PO 4 and Fe- 2 (SO 4) (3) is acetol. All the four sodium compounds favor acetol formation reaction and the selection increasing effect follows the order of NaOH > Na 2 CO 3 approximate to Na 2 SiO 3 > NaCl. TiO 2 goes against the formation of acetol, HZSM- 5 has no marked effect on acetol formation. The two dominant organic components identified in the liquid products from pyrolysis of H 3 PO 4 and Fe- 2 (SO 4) (3) treated samples are both <b>fufural</b> and 4 -methyl- 2 -methoxy-phenol. A possible pathway for acetol formation is tentatively proposed. (C) 2008 Elsevier B. V. All rights reserved...|$|E
40|$|International @ BIOVERT+ACD:NES:FRAInternational audienceIntroduction The {{transformation}} of hemicellulosic feedstock into chemicals such as furfural is of high interest. The current process for furfural production uses H 2 SO 4 as catalyst in a batch reactor and gives 30 - 35 % yield in furfural from the hemicelluloses part of raw biomass[1]. C 6 -C 5 sugars dehydration in water, in a monophasic system, {{is known to}} be unselective. However, this reaction medium should be privileged for environmental and economical reasons. For that, the design of solid acid catalysts, active, selective and stable in water is essential. Niobium based materials are known to be efficient for the catalytic dehydration of xylose into furfural[2]. This concerns mainly crystallized Nb 2 O 5 or niobium phosphate, while only few studies deals with amorphous NbOH[3]. The present work compares the performances of crystallized Nb 2 O 5 to amorphous NbOH and phosphate modified Nb 2 O 5. The objectives of present study is to bring new insights on the superficial sites of Nb catalysts involved in xylose dehydration in <b>fufural</b> and their dependence with the bulk properties, together with their potential modification by the water medium. Fix bed reactor is privileged in this study to perform reaction at short contact time in order to limit the degradation of furfural into humins and to control the evolution of the catalyst properties with time on stream. Materials and Methods In preliminary catalytic tests carried out in continuous reactor at different WHSV and temperatures, we observed that hot water itself enhances the xylose dehydration reaction, evolving as homogenous reactive media. In order to solely observe the impact of the acid solid, experimental conditions have been settled properly. Thus, using high input flow (0, 6 cc/min) for the sugar aqueous solution and mild temperature (150 °C), furfural is not formed in pure water in absence of a solid catalyst placed into the reactor, and xylose conversion is limited to 9 %. Nb 2 O 5 is obtained from NbOH calcinated at 600 °C for 2 h. Nb oxide modified with phosphate is synthesized by anionic exchange between phosphoric acid with NbOH, the exchange levels were set to 25 %, 50 %, 75 %, 100 % and excess. Then, exchanged solids were calcined at 600 °C for 6 h. The acidic properties were measured by calorimetry of NH 3 adsorption and IR of pyridine adsorption. Discussion We can clearly observe that NbOH calcined at 600 °C is crystallized in Nb 2 O 5 phase while NbOH is totally amorphous. On the Nb-P samples, the formation of crystallized Nb 2 O 5 phase is progressively inhibited with the extent of the phosphate exchange. The presence of phosphate has also a positive effect on the BET surface: the NbP catalysts exhibit S(BET) between 50 - 76 m 2. g- 1 while Nb 2 O 5 present only 11 m 2. g- 1. The calorimetric curves show that all the samples have few sites with very high acid strength (Qdiff > 200 kJ). NbOH presents a significant higher amount of acids sites compared to Nb 2 O 5, and Nb-P has intermediate acidity. IR of Pyridine adsorption gives evidence that phosphates have suppressed the Brønsted acidity of NbOH. All these catalysts have been evaluated in continuous reactor for the dehydration of xylose into furfural in conditions where the homogenous contribution of hot water is limited. NbOH exhibits a significant higher activity compared to Nb 2 O 5, probably accounting to its higher superficial acidity. Both solids are quite stable with TOS, and XRD pattern of used Nb 2 O 5 does not show the formation of NbOH at the expense of Nb 2 O 5. Phosphate entities lead to less active solids than NbOH but improve furfural selectivities: 32 % on NbOH against 40 % over NbP samples. Note that as regards to Nb 2 O 5, improved activities are obtained with phosphate insertion, this might explain controversial results from the literature. Based on solids characterizations, this is tentatively explained by a passivation effect of phosphates which have suppress Brønsted sites of NbOH, probably involved in humins formation, combined to their positive impact on the textural features.
