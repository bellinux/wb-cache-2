5|$|The {{regional}} ORCA {{card was}} introduced as an integrated smart card for transit {{agencies in the}} Puget Sound region on April 20, 2009, allowing users to load monthly passes and value through an <b>e-purse</b> web interface. The card also allowed free transfers within a two-hour period between transit agencies of equal value, with the difference for higher fare subtracted from the <b>e-purse</b> or prompting for cash. While initially available for no fee, effective March 1, 2010 a $5 cost was added when ordering a standard adult or youth ORCA card. CT removed their paper transfers on January 1, 2010 after the ORCA card made them obsolete.|$|E

With the passage of time, people changed their understanding of economic systems, and switched from barter to paper money. In the contemporary world, when IT becomes a big part of common life, the electronic money, <b>e-purses,</b> pay pall and other payment systems are used more commonly and have become more important. The payment systems differ one from each other and we can talk about payment instruments market. But what if this market does not work well? The aim of this article is to determine the rules and conditions on the market of payment instruments. The author attempts to recognize the problems on the demand and supply sides. The focus here is on the system of credit cards and direct debit system together with the latest theory of the Tourist Test.

5000|$|... ===PugetPass=== PugetPass is a {{regional}} monthly pass that lets passengers travel {{on nearly every}} transit service in the region for a calendar month. A PugetPass is valid for payment of trip fares up {{to the value of}} the pass. Trip fares above the value of the pass may be paid with <b>E-purse</b> value. (Example: a passenger who has a $2.50 PugetPass and rides a service that costs $3.75 would have $2.50 covered by the PugetPass and $1.25 would be deducted from their <b>E-Purse).</b> Washington State Ferries does not accept the PugetPass. Pass values available range from 50¢ to $5.75. Passes are priced at $9 per 25¢ of fare value.|$|E

The new company worked on further developments in payment cards: Bancomat/Pagobancomat, FASTpay, borsellino elettronico (<b>e-purse</b> with the MINIpay product) and the Microcircuito project for the migration from magnetic stripe cards to microchip cards.|$|E
50|$|ORCA cards allow {{a two-hour}} {{transfer}} {{from the time}} fare is paid. If an <b>E-purse</b> or regional pass was used to pay fare, transfers are allowed on any bus or rail system in the region. If an agency pass was used, transfers are allowed only on services within that agency. Transfers are stored on the card and automatically calculated for the user. Transfers are not given or accepted on Washington State Ferries.|$|E
5000|$|The {{commands}} in {{this standard}} follow the convention in ISO/IEC 7816-4: 2005. The main commands are [...] "Read Purse", [...] "Debit Purse" [...] and [...] "Credit Purse". The design allows for partial refund and {{is limited to}} the most recent amount debited. The [...] "AutoLoad" [...] and [...] "Cumulative Debit" [...] features are also available. In this standard, key management for controlling <b>e-purse</b> operations is flexible and the final details are decided by the card issuer. Atomicity is a key focus in this standard to ensure reliability of transactions across multiple interfaces.|$|E
5000|$|There are {{two major}} {{benefits}} to moving to smart-card-based credit card payment systems: improved security (with associated fraud reduction), and the possibility for finer control of [...] "offline" [...] credit-card transaction approvals. One of the original goals of EMV was to provide for multiple applications on a card: for a credit and debit card application or an <b>e-purse.</b> With current processing regulations in the United States, new issue debit cards contain two applications — a card association (Visa, MasterCard etc.) application, and a common debit application. The common debit application ID is somewhat of a misnomer as each [...] "common" [...] debit application actually uses the resident card association application.|$|E
40|$|Computational {{models of}} trust have been {{proposed}} for use in ubicomp environments for deciding whether to allow customers to pay with an <b>e-purse</b> or not. In order to build trust in a customer, a means to link transactions using the same <b>e-purse</b> is required. Roughly, trust {{is a result of}} knowledge. As the number of transactions increases, the resulting increase in knowledge about the user of the <b>e-purse</b> threatens privacy due to global profiling. We present a scheme (and its prototype) that mitigates this loss of privacy without forbidding the use of trust for smoothing payment by giving the opportunity to the user to divide trust (i. e. transactions) according to context (e. g. location, user’s current activity or subset of shops) ...|$|E
40|$|MBA thesis - WBSThe {{purpose of}} this {{research}} was to determine whether electronic purse (<b>e-purse)</b> schemes could be positioned as alternatives to existing payment methods for low value transactions. The focus was on low value transactions since it was widely believed that this was the area for which <b>e-purse</b> schemes were best suited. The existing payment methods considered in this research included:  Credit Cards  Debit Cards  Cheques  Cash Conjoint analysis was used to analyse the contribution made by various attributes associated with payment methods towards the overall perception of the payment methods by consumers. It was determined that the cost of a transaction and the security the payment method offered against theft, were by far the most important requirements for the likely adoption of a payment method. This implied that PIN protected <b>e-purse</b> schemes were well suited for the low value transaction market...|$|E

40|$|Recent {{advances}} in networking technology {{have increased the}} potential for dynamic enterprise collaborations between an open set of entities on a global scale. The security of these collaborations is a major concern, and requires novel approaches suited to this new environment to be developed. Trust management {{appears to be a}} promising approach. Due to the dynamic nature of these collaborations, dynamism in the formation, evolution and exploitation of trust is essential. In this paper we explore the properties of trust dynamics in this context. Trust is formed and evolves according to personal experience and recommendations. The properties of trust dynamics are expressed through a formal model of trust. Specific examples, based on an <b>e-purse</b> application scenario are used to demonstrate these properties. 1...|$|E

40|$|Survey {{results show}} that Dutch {{consumers}} perceive paying in cash as an inexpensive way to pay, while they regard electronic payment cards as relatively expensive. This finding partly explains the low usage of electronic payment cards in point-of-sale (POS) payments. The survey also highlights several non-price features {{that contribute to the}} unpopularity of electronic payment cards. The objective of the survey was to identify price and non-price features of payment instruments {{that can be used to}} stimulate the use of electronic payment cards. Their attractiveness can be increased, through 1) technological modifications to e-purses and debit cards that enhance their convenience, 2) by increasing the number of acceptance points and 3) by drawing public attention to the speed of <b>e-purse</b> payments. Making it more expensive for consumers to pay in cash could also increase the usage of electronic payment instruments. household survey; cost efficiency; retail payments; payment instruments; nonprice features...|$|E
