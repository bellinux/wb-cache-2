25|$|Hook goes {{calling for}} Emma and {{stands on a}} rooftop to get attention. He jumps off, and Emma uses magic to take him safely to the ground, before asking {{why he was so}} sure she’d save him. He says he was optimistic, and then asks what {{happened}} between them in Camelot. He says he forgives her, but she says that she's the Dark One and forgiveness. Hook says there’s nothing she’s done could be as bad as what he’s done. He shows her a ring that belonged to Barnaby, and whom he killed front of his wife. He says that every ring he wears is a sad story. She shows him the ring he gave her to keep safe, and he says it was the saddest story of all; it belonged to a man better than him, his brother Liam. She tries to give it back but he tells her to keep it. He says he wore rings as trophies and now they’re just reminders. When Emma asks if Hook wants to know the truth, no matter <b>how</b> <b>terrible,</b> Hook says he loves her no matter what, and Emma says she needs to show him something. She takes him to her house and she points him to a telescope. He looks and sees the sea and a full moon over the waves. She says he told her the ocean calmed him and he says it’s a nice home she picked, but Emma says that he picked it, not her. He looks at the newspaper and recognized his handwriting on it. She says he told her this was their future and she says everything she did was to keep that future alive. He asks again for the truth and she says they’re almost there and kisses him. She says she can’t tell him everything because he would try and stop her. After the kiss, Hook gets groggy and asks what she's doing, before passing out.|$|E
500|$|Myles McNutt of The A.V. Club, Gillette's former employer, {{awarded the}} episode a [...] "B–" [...] {{and noted that}} he did not like Todd Packer, nor the episodes where his {{character}} is intentionally supposed to be vile. He did, however, enjoy the fact that Packer's antics caused Jim and Dwight to unite {{in the face of a}} common enemy, a plot that McNutt said [...] "had a scrappy feel to it". McNutt also called Kevin being [...] "slowly broken by Packer's cruelty" [...] an effective way to show <b>how</b> <b>terrible</b> Packer was to the morale of the office. He was, however, more critical about the fact that Holly seemed unaware that [...] "Michael may not be the best judge of whether or not someone is funny". At the end of his review, McNutt reminded readers that The A.V. Club specifically selected him as their new reviewer for the show because he did not know Gillette, thus avoiding a conflict of interest.|$|E

60|$|Nothing {{is harder}} for one whom life has always spoiled than {{to find his}} best and deepest {{feelings}} disbelieved in. At that moment, Summerhay meant absolutely what he said. The girl was nothing to him! If she was pursuing him, how could he help it? And he could not make Gyp believe it! How awful! <b>How</b> truly <b>terrible!</b> <b>How</b> unjust and unreasonable of her! And why? What had he done {{that she should be}} so unbelieving--should think him such a shallow scoundrel? Could he help the girl's kissing him? Help her being fond of him? Help having a man's nature? Unreasonable, unjust, ungenerous! And giving her a furious look, he went out.|$|R
500|$|Peter goes to {{retrieve}} Meg from her [...] "party" [...] and asks Meg {{to come as}} Lois wants her there. Meg just says it's just a birthday party and asks who would remember if she wasn't there. Peter says that Lois would as she remembers everything and that her best memories are of when Meg and her brothers were born. Peter then has an epiphany, the party is more for Lois than Stewie. Realizing <b>how</b> <b>terrible</b> she has been, Meg agrees {{to come home and}} the cult members agree as well. Peter makes a toast, then looks at his watch before he can drink the poisoned punch and Pulls Meg out before she can drink Her's, oblivious {{to the fact that he}} is saving her life in the process while the cult members all die. The Cult Leader chases after them while wearing his ceremonial white robe and is mistaken by Stewie as [...] "The Man in White". Stewie does away with him and, feeling victorious, joins the others to enjoy his party.|$|E
500|$|Meanwhile, Kenny {{suffers from}} a bout of [...] "explosive diarrhea", which spreads {{to others in the}} town, {{including}} the adults protesting Terrance and Phillip. Despite objecting to the show, the adults themselves laugh and make jokes at their own real-life toilet humor. Carol proclaims that if Cartoon Central does not take the show off the air, the protesters will kill themselves, and they start using a slingshot to send themselves flying into the building. With the adults out of town for the protest, the boys are free to watch Terrance and Phillip at their leisure. Grandpa Marvin continues asking Stan to kill him, and demonstrates <b>how</b> <b>terrible</b> his life is by locking Stan in a room and forcing him to listen to a song in the style of Enya's [...] "Orinoco Flow". Now convinced that his life is excruciating, Stan finally agrees to kill his grandpa, and tries to do so by rigging a cow on a pulley and dropping it on him. Just as the boys are about to do it, Death himself arrives, but starts chasing after the boys instead of Grandpa Marvin.|$|E

2500|$|While {{campaigning for}} {{re-election}} in 2014, Ford visited Danzig Street on {{the second anniversary of}} the mass shooting, dodging questions about his own connection to drug dealers. Councillor Paula Fletcher criticized his attending the event: [...] "You can't have it both ways– you can't be part of it and then crusading to stop it ... You can't technically be condoning guns and gangs and then going out saying <b>how</b> <b>terrible</b> it is that people have been shot and killed." ...|$|E
2500|$|Guttorm Hansen, {{who was the}} President of the Parliament of Norway when Lange was a Member of Parliament, {{once said}} that he {{believed}} Lange's apparent goal was to [...] "make [...] into a political circus with himself as the main clown." [...] Lange said many unexpected things in Parliament. [...] He once bragged about his own potency, and another time spoke about how much moonshine he had consumed in his lifetime, and <b>how</b> <b>terrible</b> it was. He was also censored {{for the use of}} unparliamentary language.|$|E
2500|$|The Illusionist has {{one more}} scene. [...] Bertha is {{revealed}} to be not a princess, but the long lost daughter of Auguste and Eugenie. [...] When Bertha refuses to acknowledge her true parents, the king banishes her until she apologizes. [...] She leaves sobbing but, at Ondine's urging, is soon forgiven. [...] After the events of this disastrous day, Ondine laments, “Oh, {{how difficult it is}} to live among you, where what has happened can never again not have happened.

2500|$|The pro-peace {{attitude}} {{of the people of}} the Soviet Union and People's China is not based on fear of war but on confidence in their theory and way of life. One Soviet trade unionist put the matter to us in this way. [...] "We are not afraid of war. We have been through it and survived its cruelties and horrors. We know that we can take it. Just because we have been through it and suffered from it, we know <b>how</b> <b>terrible</b> war is. It wastes materials, but worse than that, it squanders human idealism, energy, wealth and life. Still worse, those of us who are trying to build a socialist society are diverted and preoccupied by war. We know from bitter experience that if we are to engage in socialist construction we cannot fight wars. War is a full-time occupation." ...|$|E
2500|$|Adorno saw {{the culture}} {{industry}} as an {{arena in which}} critical tendencies or potentialities were eliminated. He argued that the culture industry, which produced and circulated cultural commodities through the mass media, manipulated the population. Popular culture {{was identified as a}} reason why people become passive; the easy pleasures available through consumption of popular culture made people docile and content, no matter <b>how</b> <b>terrible</b> their economic circumstances. [...] "Capitalist production so confines them, body and soul, that they fall helpless victims to what is offered them." [...] The differences among cultural goods make them appear different, but they are in fact just variations on the same theme. He wrote that [...] "the same thing is offered to everybody by the standardized production of consumption goods" [...] but this is concealed under [...] "the manipulation of taste and the official culture's pretense of individualism". By doing so, the culture industry appeals to every single consumer in a unique and personalized way, all while maintaining minimal costs and effort on their behalf. Consumers purchase the illusion that every commodity or product is tailored to the individual's personal preference, by incorporating subtle modifications or inexpensive [...] "add-ons" [...] {{in order to keep the}} consumer returning for new purchases, and therefore more revenue for the corporation system. Adorno conceptualized this phenomenon as pseudo-individualisation and the always-the-same.|$|E

[...] But former Justice Department officials familiar with his case have asserted that he could also be convicted if tried in civilian court. The New York Times, and Lawfare, have pointed out <b>how</b> Guantanamo's <b>terrible</b> reputation may alienate any foreign governments who provided information, or other assistance, that lead to Khaybar's capture.|$|R
6000|$|He {{pressed his}} hand tightly on her shoulder, and left her, without letting her see his face. Shocked and bewildered, she hurried upstairs to Margaret. She threw {{herself on her}} knees, felt her arms round her, and heard her kind soothing, and then, in broken words, told how dreadful it had been, and how kind papa had been, {{and what he had}} said, which was now the {{uppermost}} thought. [...] "Oh, Margaret, Margaret, <b>how</b> very <b>terrible</b> it is! And does papa really think so?" ...|$|R

6000|$|... [24] The word 'clergy' is {{omitted from}} all the editions {{published}} after Bunyan's death.

But <b>how</b> inexpressibly <b>terrible</b> will be the misery of carnal clergymen, who, by precept or example, have led their hearers to a false hope of heaven.
