5|$|The {{budget for}} the film's costumes was US$1,600, {{far more than the}} stage {{production}} budget, but having to <b>double</b> <b>up</b> on costumes for filming was expensive. For filming, corsets for the finale had to be doubled for the pool scene, with one version drying while the other was worn on set. While many of the costumes are exact replicas from the stage productions, other costumes were new to filming, such as Columbia's gold sequined swallow-tail coat and top hat and Magenta's maid's uniform.|$|E

5|$|Because {{half the}} country's surface {{consists}} of exposed rock, Norway has {{a tradition of}} building mountain cavern halls for many purposes, from tunnels via power plants to sport centers. These often <b>double</b> <b>up</b> as bomb shelters. Gjøvik Municipality opened Norway's first underground swimming pool in 1974. The idea to build an underground ice rink came from Consulting Engineer Jan A. Rygh while having dinner with Municipal Engineer Helge Simenstad in 1988, after the latter said that Gjøvik had been awarded an ice rink for the Olympics. The first drafts were made on a napkin in the restaurant. An alternative proposal for a conventional rink was also made. Among the advantage of a cavern hall was that it would not take up valuable downtown property space or interfere with the town's cityscape, yet it would be centrally located which would reduce travel costs, and there would be a stable year-round natural temperature which would reduce cooling costs.|$|E

25|$|As {{time went}} on by, space {{constraints}} posed a growing concern. Catechism classes for children were conducted {{in places like the}} sacristy and kitchen, thereby impeding on the priests’ privacy and opportunity for interaction. Hence, the Church decided to build a new extension that would {{meet the needs of the}} growing community. Construction on the new 4 storey extension began in early 2003.

Fifteen entered the Houses on April 10 with {{the last one to}} follow the next night. An additional eleven housemates (one Filipino, one half-Filipino, and nine foreigners without any Filipino lineage) entered the house for a Philippines vs. World clash. The nine foreigners, along with the half-Filipino, were dubbed as Teenternationals and were the first ever full-blooded ones (as opposed to participants who are part-Filipino) to compete in any reality show in the Philippines.|$|E
25|$|After the {{breakout}} {{from the}} Pusan Perimeter in November 1950, the 8th flew daily strike missions out of Iwakuni {{and at times}} recovering at Taegu AB (K-2), which forced the crews to fly long, arduous missions that sometimes lasted more than six hours. When the Chinese Communists attacked in the Spring of 1951, FEAF requested that the light bomber wings increase their nightly sortie rate. The {{only way to do}} this was to <b>double</b> <b>up</b> some of the missions. For several months, the crews flew from Iwakuni to their patrol sectors in North Korea, completed their mission, and then flew to the K-2 Airfield. Landing a B-26 at night at Taegu was no easy feat because the Pierced Steel Planking on the runway had begun to deteriorate. The B-26s landing there tore up dozens of tires, {{and more than a few}} accidents resulted. Also, the tires were in short supply, so each one lost at K-2 was hard to replace. If the B-26 crews got down at Taegu without incident, they could find a place to grab a quick catnap as their planes were readied for the next mission. About an hour later, they were airborne and heading north to their next target area. Four hours later, utterly exhausted, they were back in Japan, after up to ten hours of flight and combat.|$|E
25|$|The Food Justice Movement {{has been}} seen as a unique and {{multifaceted}} movement with relevance to the issue of food security. It {{has been described as a}} movement about social-economic and political problems in connection to environmental justice, improved nutrition and health, and activism. Today, a growing number of individuals and minority groups are embracing the Food Justice due to the perceived increase in hunger within nations such as the United States as well as the amplified effect of food insecurity on many minority communities, particularly the Black and Latino communities. A number of organizations have either championed the Food Justice Cause or greatly impacted the Food Justice space. An example of a prominent organization within the food justice movement has been the Coalition of Immokalee Workers, which is a worker-based human rights organization that has been recognized globally for its accomplishments in the areas of human trafficking, social responsibility and gender-based violence at work. The Coalition of Immoaklee Workers most prominent accomplishment related to the food justice space has been its part in implementing the Fair Food Program which increased the pay and bettered working conditions of farm workers in the tomato industry who had been exploited for generations. This accomplishment provided over 30,000 workers more income and the ability to access better and more healthy foods for themselves and their families. Another organization in the food justice space is the Fair Food Network, an organization that has embraced the mission of helping familIes who need healthy food to gain access to it while also increasing the livelihoold for farmers in America and growing local economies. Started by Oran B. Hesterma, the Fair Food Network has invested over $200 million in various projects and initiatives, such as the <b>Double</b> <b>Up</b> Food Bucks program, to help low-income and minority communities access healthier food.|$|E
