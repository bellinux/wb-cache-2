25|$|Yellow jack are predatory fish, moving both {{individually}} {{or in small}} groups, with their main prey being small fish, although observational records also show smaller benthic prey is taken. Yellow jack have been observed in a 'following role', moving around with larger species {{to take advantage of}} the commotion caused by the bigger fish, allowing the jack to opportunistically forage or take scraps left by the larger fish. As well as other teleosts, yellow jack have also been recorded following eels, stingrays and nurse sharks. In one case, they were observed following a <b>flying</b> <b>gurnard,</b> itself smaller than the jack, that disturbed the substrate, causing various organisms to be displaced and become available for predation. As well as being 'followers', larger specimens have also been observed as the 'followed' species. The species has also been observed living in close relationships with spinner dolphins, feeding off the dolphin's waste products. This behavior has also been observed in a number of other jacks living in the region.|$|E

40|$|The dolphinfish, Coryphaena hippurus, is an oceanic {{epipelagic fish}} with {{economic}} importance to sport and commercial fisheries throughout its worldwide distribution in tropical and sub-tropical waters. In the eastern Caribbean, dolphinfish are generally piscivorous, eating {{a wide variety}} of fish species including small oceanic pelagic species (e. g. flyingfish, halfbeaks, man-o-war fish, sargassum and rough triggerfish), juveniles of large oceanic pelagic species (e. g. tunas, billfish, jacks, dolphinfish), and pelagic larvae of neritic, benthic species (e. g. <b>flying</b> <b>gurnards,</b> triggerfish, pufferfish, grunts). They also eat invertebrates (e. g. cephalopods, mysids, scyphozoans), suggesting that they are essentially non-selective foragers. This appears to be typical of dolphinfish from other locations and of tropical oceanic pelagic species in general. Post-larval <b>flying</b> <b>gurnards</b> and flyingfish rank as the most important prey species overall. However, the diet varies with season, and mysids are a very important component from October to December. Diet also varies slightly with predator size (small dolphinfish eat fewer flyingfish and more squid than larger sized dolphinfish), and with sex (males take proportionally more of the active, fast swimming species such as flyingfish, squid and dolphinfish than do females). From these results and {{a review of the literature}} to determine the diet of other tropical oceanic species and the predators of dolphinfish, it can be seen that predator-prey relationships and interspecies competition for food clearly involve other commercially important species. As such, interactions between the surface trolling dolphinfish fisheries, the surface gillnet flyingfish fisheries, and the subsurface longline tuna fisheries in the eastern Caribbean can be expected...|$|R

50|$|Despite its name, the spotwing <b>flying</b> <b>gurnard</b> is {{not related}} to the true flyingfish; these are in the family Exocoetidae, order Beloniformes. Nor is it able to fly, or even to glide as the true flyingfish do.|$|E
50|$|Two {{ships of}} the United States Navy have borne the name Batfish, {{named in honor}} of the batfish, any of several fishes; a pediculate fish of the West Indies, the <b>flying</b> <b>gurnard</b> of the Atlantic, or a California sting ray.|$|E
60|$|Another {{group of}} very {{interesting}} {{fish out of}} water are the <b>flying</b> <b>gurnards,</b> common enough in the Mediterranean and the tropical Atlantic. They are much heavier and bigger creatures than the true flying fish of the herring type, being often {{a foot and a half}} long, and their wings are much larger in proportion, though not, I think, really so powerful as those of their pretty little silvery rivals. All the flying fish fly only of necessity, not from choice. They leave the water when pursued by their enemies, or when frightened by the rapid approach of a big steamer. So swiftly do they fly, however, that they can far outstrip a ship going at the rate of ten knots an hour; and I have often watched one keep ahead of a great Pacific liner under full steam for many minutes together in quick successive flights of three or four hundred feet each. Oddly enough, they can fly further against the wind than before it--a fact acknowledged even by the spectacled Germans themselves, and very hard indeed to reconcile with the orthodox belief that they are not flying at all, but only jumping. I don't know whether the <b>flying</b> <b>gurnards</b> are good eating or not; but the silvery flying fish are caught for market (sad desecration of the poetry of nature!) in the Windward Islands, and when nicely fried in egg and bread-crumb are really quite as good for practical purposes as smelts or whiting or any other prosaic European substitute.|$|R
5000|$|The paired {{pectoral}} fins {{are located}} on each side, usually just behind the operculum, and are homologous to the forelimbs of tetrapods. A peculiar function of pectoral fins, highly developed in some fish, {{is the creation of}} the dynamic lifting force that assists some fish, such as sharks, in maintaining depth and also enables the [...] "flight" [...] for flying fish. In many fish, the pectoral fins aid in walking, especially in the lobe-like fins of some anglerfish and in the mudskipper. Certain rays of the pectoral fins may be adapted into finger-like projections, such as in sea robins and <b>flying</b> <b>gurnards.</b> The [...] "horns" [...] of manta rays and their relatives are called cephalic fins; this is actually a modification of the anterior portion of the pectoral fin.|$|R
50|$|The {{pectoral}} fins {{are normally}} held against the body, but when threatened the fins are expanded to startle potential predators which may include sea breams and mackerel. The <b>flying</b> <b>gurnard</b> uses its pelvic fins to {{walk along the}} bottom of the ocean.|$|E
50|$|Some of {{the fish}} {{that can be seen}} in the waters around Crete include: {{scorpion}} fish, dusky grouper, east Atlantic peacock wrasse, five-spotted wrasse, weever fish, common stingray, brown ray, mediterranean black goby, pearly razorfish, star-gazer, painted comber, damselfish, and the <b>flying</b> <b>gurnard.</b>|$|E

5000|$|This {{fish can}} grow to 38cm in length. They feed on crustaceans, clams and small fishes. They have feeler-like leading rays and {{extensions}} from each fin ray.

50|$|The <b>flying</b> <b>gurnard</b> (Dactylopterus volitans), {{also known}} as the helmet gurnard, is a bottom-dwelling fish of {{tropical}} to warm temperate waters {{on both sides of the}} Atlantic Ocean.

The huge, rounded {{pectoral}} fins having many dark spots and wavy streaks and a bright blue edge. Each ray has a feeler-like extension on the tip. This fish is well camouflaged with a grayish brown base color with dark brown or black markings on its head and body.|$|E
