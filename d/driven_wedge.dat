40|$|Within the {{framework}} of the pilot heavy-ion therapy facility at GSI equipped with an active beam delivery system of advanced raster scanning technique, a feasibility study on actively conformal heavy-ion irradiation to moving tumors has been experimentally conducted. Laterally, real-time corrections to the beam scanning parameters by the raster scanner, leading to an active beam tracing, compensate for the lateral motion of a target volume. Longitudinally, a mechanically <b>driven</b> <b>wedge</b> energy degrader (called depth scanner) is applied to adjust the beam energy so as to locate the high-dose Bragg peak of heavy ion beam to the slice under treatment for the moving target volume. It has been experimentally shown that compensations for lateral target motion by the raster scanner and longitudinal target shift by the depth scanner are feasible...|$|E
40|$|We {{have used}} an {{embedded}} electromagnetic particle velocity gauge technique {{to measure the}} shock initiation behavior in PBX 9501 explosive. Up to twelve separate particle velocity wave profile measurements have been made at differ-ent depths in a single experiment. These detail the growth from an input shock to a detonation. In addition, another gauge element called a “shock tracker ” {{has been used to}} monitor the progress of the shock front as a function of time and position as it moves through the explosive sample. This provides data similar to that obtained in a traditional explosively <b>driven</b> <b>wedge</b> test and is used to de-termine the position and time that the wave attains detonation. Run distance-to-detonation vs. input pressure (Pop–plot) data and particle velocity wave profile data have been obtained on new PBX 9501 pressed to densities of 1. 826, 1. 830, and 1. 837 g/cm 3. In addition, the same measurements were performed on mate-rials aged from 10 to 17 years. All results to date, including the Pop – plot and wave profiles show shock sensitivity to be a function only of the initial density and not of age...|$|E
40|$|SummaryAimThe aim of {{this work}} was to {{determine}} an algorithm to obtain a predetermined inclination angle of isodoses for the Saturn 43 F linear accelerator {{with the use of}} a motor <b>driven</b> <b>wedge</b> filter. Materials/MethodsIt was assumed that a predetermined inclination angle of a reference isodose could be obtained after combining absorbed doses during irradiation with an open field and with a field with a constant 60 ° wedge. In order to find relations between isodose angles and the irradiation time doses were measured first in a plexiglas phantom and then in a water phantom at the reference depth for the combination of an open field and a field with a 60 ° wedge. The doses measured under the wedge were normalized with use of the 60 ° wedge coefficients and converted using tabulated values of the percent depth doses into depth values. Then the angles of isodose slope were calculated. ResultsThe results are presented in tables and in figures. The polynomials used to calculate times t 0 and t 60 for predetermined isodose angles were obtained. ConclusionsThe polynomials obtained differ from energy to energy. The differences in isodose inclination angles increase with irradiation time using a 60 ° wedge. The higher is the energy of the beam, the greater is the inclination of the isodoses using the same physical wedge. The differences between the results of measurements in a solid phantom and in a water phantom are due to the differences in depth dose distributions between both materials...|$|E
