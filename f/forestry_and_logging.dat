25|$|Development {{of a third}} {{generation}} protective fabrics started in 1992 under the name Avertic. By using a new combination of settings, materials and finishing, this new generation of protective textiles enhanced not only the washability of garments but also the level of protection compared to earlier generations. Thanks to Kjell Eng´s innovative mind, Avertic chainsaw protective textiles are still used in chaps, trousers, boots, jackets and gloves around the world.

25|$|In {{the early}} 80´s Kjell Eng, {{the founder of}} Engtex, got the idea to use {{textiles}} for protection and cut prevention. Having worked as a logger earlier in life, he was very aware of the danger in using and handling a chainsaw. The first generation of protective fabrics consisted of a multi-layered and specially designed tricot fabric that peeled off layer by layer at contact with the cutting chains. This was the start and the first-ever chainsaw protective fabric was born. Statistics showed a reduction in injuries at work-related accidents in <b>forestry</b> <b>and</b> <b>logging.</b> However the new fabrics did not stop the more severe accidents with deep cuts and lethal outcome.|$|E

40|$|We {{examine the}} {{implications}} of migration and insecure property rights to land use and deforestation in tropical frontier forests. Three forms of property rights risks are introduced to basic land-use forms. Illegal logging risk is associated with forest plantations, a land expropriation risk affects land in agriculture <b>and</b> plantation <b>forestry,</b> <b>and</b> illegal <b>logging</b> risks threaten native forest land. Public and private landowners can reduce these risks by employing costly enforcement effort. We show how that migration, expropriation, <b>and</b> illegal <b>logging</b> risks lead to deforestation by promoting agricultural expansion, <b>and</b> illegal <b>logging.</b> Higher public enforcement reduces illegal logging, but higher private enforcement {{may or may not}} reduce deforestation depending on migration pressures. Higher timber prices have an ambiguous effect on deforestation, but an increasing value of non-timber benefits decreases or leaves deforestation unchanged depending on the incentive structures of illegal loggers. ...|$|R
