5|$|Over {{the next}} four years, they became a major {{artillery}} tractor, mainly used to haul medium guns like the 6-inch <b>howitzer,</b> the 60-pounder, and later the 9.2-inch <b>howitzer.</b>|$|E
5|$|In 1942, {{trying to}} solve the problem of lack of a {{suitable}} mobile 152mm <b>howitzer,</b> the design bureau headed by F. F. Petrov started to work privately on a new <b>howitzer,</b> based on the carriage of the M-30 and the barrel of the M-10 (which was fitted with a muzzle brake in order to reduce the recoil and thus prevent damage to the lighter carriage). The approach allowed production to begin on the new <b>howitzer</b> almost immediately from the stockpile of parts for both earlier guns. Given the war situation and shortages of artillery, this solution was both elegant and expedient.|$|E
5|$|The D-1 <b>howitzer</b> was {{essentially}} {{a combination of the}} barrel of the 152-mm <b>howitzer</b> model 1938 (M-10) on the carriage of the 122-mm <b>howitzer</b> M1938 (M-30). Since the new carriage was lighter than that of the M-10, the barrel was fitted with a massive double-baffle muzzle brake DT-3 to soften the shock of recoil. The breech block was of interrupted screw type, the recoil system consisted of a hydraulic buffer and a hydro-pneumatic recuperator. The separately loaded ammunition included a variety of shells and eight different propellant charges in cartridges.|$|E

5|$|As {{with other}} American {{self-propelled}} guns produced {{during the early}} World War II period, the prototype was assembled and tested at the Aberdeen Proving Ground. The M2 recoil mechanism {{and other parts of}} the M2 <b>howitzer</b> carriage were used in the vehicle mounting. After several tests, the gun carriage proved fragile on bumpy terrain. The problem was corrected by reinforcing the frame, and redesigning the <b>howitzer</b> mount. Demountable headlights were recommended because of the muzzle blast, although they were not available for early production models. Early models had no shield for the <b>howitzer</b> either, but a foldable shield was added during testing. The gun faced forward, like many other half-track models. The total traverse was 40 degrees and the elevation was from −5 to +35 degrees. The armored windshield cover was remounted so it could fold onto the hood. After further testing, it was accepted for production.|$|E

5|$|However, {{the rifle}} corps were re-established in late 1942 and the {{previous}} organization of artillery at the corps level was reintroduced. As {{a result of the}} halting of 152mm <b>howitzer</b> production, the Red Army corps artillery lacked a weapon more mobile than the heavy 152 mm howitzer-gun M1937 (ML-20) (typically employed by army-level and Reserve of the Main Command artillery units), but more powerful than the 122 mm <b>howitzer</b> M1938 (M-30).|$|E

5000|$|The 1st Regiment, New York Marine Artillery, also armed {{themselves}} with boat <b>howitzers,</b> using {{them for their}} designed use of amphibious expeditions.

Other than the material used, the Wiard boat <b>howitzers</b> were identical to the Dahlgren 12-pounder rifled boat <b>howitzers.</b> The Wiard <b>howitzers</b> were not made in large numbers [...]|$|R
5|$|In {{the midst}} of this drive on Taegu, an {{ammunition}} shortage became critical for the UN forces. Eighth Army on September 10 reduced the ration of 105mm <b>howitzer</b> ammunition from 50 to 25 rounds per <b>howitzer</b> per day, except in cases of emergency. Carbine ammunition was also in critical short supply. The 17th Field Artillery Battalion, with the first 8-inch howitzers to arrive in Korea, could not engage in the battle for lack of ammunition.|$|E
5|$|The D-1 was {{manufactured}} solely at No. 9 Plant (UZTM) in Sverdlovsk {{from late}} 1943 to 1949. During World War II, the <b>howitzer</b> was only produced in small numbers because Plant No. 9 was {{also responsible for}} the mass production of the 122mm <b>howitzer</b> M-30. This resulted in critical shortages of the 152mm howitzers in the Red Army corps artillery {{until the end of}} the war.|$|E
5|$|The ship {{also participated}} in the main attack on the Dardanelles forts on 18 March. This time a 6-inch (152mm) <b>howitzer</b> battery opened fire on Agamemnon and hit her 12 times in 25 minutes; five of the <b>howitzer</b> shells hit her armour and did no damage, but the seven that hit outside her armour {{protection}} did considerable structural damage and temporarily put one of her 12-inch (305-mm) guns out of action.|$|E

2500|$|Mountain rifle {{divisions}} in 19391940 had one battalion of 122mm <b>howitzers</b> (3 batteries, 9 guns). [...] From 1941 they received instead one artillery regiment (2 battalions, each from 3 four-gun batteries) with 24 <b>howitzers,</b> but in early 1942 only one battalion (2 batteries, 8 <b>howitzers)</b> remained. From 1944 <b>howitzers</b> {{were removed from}} mountain rifle divisions.|$|R

5|$|In {{the autumn}} of 1941, when the Armored Force expanded, an urgent need for {{self-propelled}} artillery arose. Although a full-track chassis was preferred, the situation required the use of whatever vehicles were immediately available. The M3 Half-track was selected to carry a 105mm M2A1 <b>howitzer.</b> Although this design had originally been suggested in September 1941, {{it had not been}} taken up. However, the urgency of the requirement resulted in the approval by the Adjutant General and the construction of a prototype was authorized by OCM 17391, dated 31 October 1941; the new vehicle designated as the 105mm <b>Howitzer</b> Motor Carriage T19.|$|E
5|$|Almost 21 {{hours later}} the 6th Airlanding Brigade's main air assault on Normandy, Operation Mallard, began. Included in the {{operation}} was the brigade, the 6th Airborne Division's reconnaissance regiment, {{and one of its}} <b>howitzer</b> batteries. The combined force crossed the English Channel in 250 gliders, arriving at their landing zones at 21:00 6June1944.|$|E
5|$|In 1941 the Soviet Union {{decided to}} cease {{production}} of the 152 mm <b>howitzer</b> M1938 (M-10). One of the reasons was the disbanding of the Rifle Corps between August and September 1941 and the consequent removal of the corps artillery. Moreover, all 152mm howitzers were excluded from divisional artillery. As a result, there was no series production of 152mm howitzers during 1942.|$|E
50|$|Two major {{lend lease}} {{recipients}} of the M1 were United Kingdom (826 pack <b>howitzers)</b> and China (637 pack <b>howitzers</b> and 125 field <b>howitzers).</b> 68 pieces were supplied to France, and 60 to various countries in Latin America.|$|R
5000|$|Total is 219 pieces. 36 <b>Howitzers</b> {{operated}} by the LAF since the 80's, 41 <b>Howitzers</b> received in 2008, followed by 30 M-198 <b>Howitzers</b> in January, 2010, 72 pieces delivered on 8/2/2015, and a batch of 40 pieces on 8/9/2016 ...|$|R

5|$|In {{the midst}} of this drive on Taegu, an {{ammunition}} shortage became critical for the UN forces. The situation was such that United Nations Commander General of the Army Douglas MacArthur on September 9 sent messages urging that two ammunition ships then en route to Yokohama, Japan and Pusan carrying 172,790 rounds of 105-mm. shells, with estimated arrival time September 11, proceed at maximum speed consistent with the safety of the vessels. Eighth Army on September 10 reduced the ration of 105-mm. <b>howitzer</b> ammunition from 50 to 25 rounds per <b>howitzer</b> per day, except in cases of emergency. Carbine ammunition was also in critical short supply. The 17th Field Artillery Battalion, with the first 8-inch howitzers to arrive in Korea, could not engage in the battle for lack of ammunition.|$|E
5|$|Major {{changes to}} the {{original}} Verdeja 1 included removing the turret {{and replacing it with}} a gun shield with 10millimetre thick steel armor. This meant that much of the chassis' roof and rear wall was eliminated. The <b>howitzer</b> was designed as a monoblock steel tube, using a double-baffle muzzle brake, with twelve twists completing a full turn every forty calibers. As mounted, the <b>howitzer</b> could fire between 0.5° and 25°, and move 4.5° either left or right. The crew could stow eight rounds of ammunition in a ready-round stowage area near the walls of the gun shield {{on each side of the}} breech, allowing easy access to projectiles. Otherwise, the vehicle could store another 24 rounds in an auxiliary carriage. The carriage was based on the axles and wheels of a PaK 36 anti-tank gun. A unique feature of this prototype was a mechanical brake built into the idler-wheel to the rear of the chassis, guaranteeing the vehicle's stability when firing and avoiding damage to the transmission.|$|E
5|$|Produced by the White Motor Company, {{the vehicle}} {{was simply a}} 75mm Pack <b>Howitzer</b> M1 mounted on a {{modified}} M3 Half-track. It was first used in combat in the North African Campaign in November 1942. It later served in Italy and France, and possibly in the Pacific. Some were later leased to French forces and the type was used {{as late as the}} First Indochina War in the 1950s.|$|E

5|$|The 7th (Meerut) Division {{advanced}} in two columns. The 21st Brigade, on the right, {{supported by a}} mixed field-artillery brigade of two 4.5-inch <b>howitzer</b> and one 18-pounder batteries and a machine-gun company, advanced through Felamiye and Kufr Zibad. The 19th Brigade, on the left, with the VIII Mountain Artillery Brigade and two machine-gun companies followed by the 28th Brigade, moved through El Majdal and Kufr Sur.|$|E
5|$|The T30 <b>Howitzer</b> Motor Carriage (HMC) was a United States Army {{self-propelled}} gun used in World War II. Its design {{was based on}} requirements for an assault gun issued by the Armored Force in 1941 and it was built as an interim solution until a fully tracked design was complete.|$|E
5|$|A second {{column of}} 25 T-34 tanks {{approached}} the Task Force within an hour. This second T-34 formation advanced singly or by twos, and threes, close together {{with no apparent}} formal organization. The <b>howitzer</b> battery hit another tank from this column in its tracks, disabling it, and damaged three more. The North Korean tanks had destroyed the forward <b>howitzer</b> (number six) and wounded one of its crew members, had killed or wounded an estimated twenty infantrymen, and had destroyed all the parked vehicles behind the infantry line. At the main battery position {{one of the five}} remaining 105mm guns had been slightly damaged by a near-hit. Several {{of the men in the}} artillery battery began deserting their positions but Perry managed to convince most of them to return. Although Smith later stated that he believed that the rounds had deteriorated with age, the ineffectiveness of the 2.36-inch bazooka had been demonstrated repeatedly during World War II against German armor. Because of peacetime defense cutbacks the 24th Infantry Division had never received improved U.S. M20 3.5-inch bazookas with M28A2 HEAT antitank ammunition, capable of defeating Soviet tanks. After the last tanks passed their lines, no North Korean forces were spotted for around an hour.|$|E
