500|$|Despite his influence, {{according}} to Fine and Manning there are [...] "remarkably few scholars who are continuing his work", nor <b>has</b> <b>there</b> <b>been</b> <b>a</b> [...] "Goffman school"; thus, his impact on social {{theory has been}} simultaneously [...] "great and modest". Fine and Manning attribute the lack of subsequent Goffman-style research and writing {{to the nature of}} his signature style, which they consider very difficult to duplicate (even [...] "mimic-proof"), and also to his writing style and subjects not being widely valued in the social sciences. With regard to his style, Fine and Manning remark that he tends to be seen either as a scholar whose style is difficult to reproduce, and therefore daunting to those who might wish to emulate his style, or as a scholar whose work was transitional, bridging the work of the Chicago school and that of contemporary sociologists, and thus of less interest to sociologists than the classics of either of those two groups. With regard to his subjects, Fine and Manning observe that the topic of behavior in public places is often stigmatized as being trivial, and thus unworthy of serious scholarly attention.|$|E
