5|$|Fish and {{shellfish}} {{have a natural}} tendency to concentrate mercury in their bodies, often {{in the form of}} methylmercury, a highly toxic organic compound of mercury. Species of fish that are high on the food chain, such as shark, swordfish, king mackerel, bluefin tuna, albacore tuna, and tilefish contain higher concentrations of mercury than others. As mercury and methylmercury are <b>fat</b> <b>soluble,</b> they primarily accumulate in the viscera, although they are also found throughout the muscle tissue. When this fish is consumed by a predator, the mercury level is accumulated. Since fish are less efficient at depurating than accumulating methylmercury, fish-tissue concentrations increase over time. Thus species that are high on the food chain amass body burdens of mercury that can be ten times higher than the species they consume. This process is called biomagnification. Mercury poisoning happened this way in Minamata, Japan, now called Minamata disease.|$|E

40|$|Early weaned pigs {{are less}} capable of digesting and {{utilizing}} dietary fat than are older pigs (Pettigrew and Moser, 1991; Leibbrandt et al., 1975). Even at 21 days of age, weanling pigs exhibit lower fat digestibility than older pigs (Cera et al., 1988). It {{has been suggested}} that there is no benefit from adding fat to diets of weanling pigs until four weeks after weaning (Cline, 1991). Bile salts function to emulsify lipids and <b>fat</b> <b>solubles</b> to form fat-containing micelles to ease absorption from the intestinal tract. However, in animals, including humans, the production and utilization of bile salts is very limited at birth and during early development stages. In humans, insufficient bile has been associated with lipid malabsorption in premature infants (Watkins et al., 1975). The same malabsorption syndrome has been demonstrated in newly hatched chicks (Serafin and Nesheim, 1967). The addition of bile salts to poultry diets has resulted in an improvement of fat absorption in chicks and hens (Edwards, 1962; Gomez and Polin, 1976; Kussaibati et al., 1982).

25|$|The {{contents}} of these micelles (but not the bile salts) enter the enterocytes (epithelial cells lining the small intestine) {{where they are}} resynthesized into triglycerides, and packaged into chylomicrons which are released into the lacteals (the capillaries of the lymph system of the intestines). These lacteals drain into the thoracic duct which empties into the venous blood at the junction of the left jugular and left subclavian veins on the lower left hand side of the neck. This means that the <b>fat</b> <b>soluble</b> products of digestion are discharged directly into the general circulation, without first passing through the liver, as all other digestion products do. The reason for this peculiarity is unknown.|$|E
2500|$|These triglycerides, {{cannot be}} {{absorbed by the}} intestine. They are broken down into mono- and di-glycerides plus free fatty acids (but no free glycerol) by {{pancreatic}} lipase, which forms a 1:1 complex with a protein called colipase (also a constituent of pancreatic juice), which is necessary for its activity. The activated complex can work only at a water-fat interface. Therefore, {{it is essential that}} fats are first [...] emulsified by bile salts for optimal activity of these enzymes.

2500|$|The {{development}} of the APCI interface for LC-MS started with Horning and collaborators in the early 1973. However, its commercial application was introduced {{at the beginning of}} the 1990s after Henion and collaborators improved the LC-APCI-MS interface in 1986. The APCI ion source/ interface can be used to analyze small, neutral, relatively non-polar, and thermally stable molecules (e.g., steroids, lipids, and <b>fat</b> <b>soluble</b> vitamins). These compounds are not well ionized using ESI. In addition, APCI can also handle mobile phase streams containing [...] buffering agents. The liquid from the LC system is pumped through a capillary and there is also nebulization at the tip, where a corona discharge takes place. First, the ionizing gas surrounding the interface and the mobile phase solvent are subject to chemical ionization at the ion source. Later, these ions react with the analyte and transfer their charge. The sample ions then pass through small orifice skimmers by means of or ion-focusing lenses. Once inside the high vacuum region, the ions are subject to mass analysis. This interface can be operated in positive and negative charge modes and singly-charged ions are mainly produced. APCI ion source can also handle flow rates between [...] 500 and 2000 μl/min and it can be directly connected to conventional 4.6nbsp&mm ID columns.|$|E

40|$|Two {{experiments}} {{were carried out}} to study the effect of Solanum dubium fruit extract on weight loss, chemical composition, microbiological quality and sensory characteristics of white cheese (Gibna Bayda) during storage. In the first experiment, Solanum dubium fruit enzymes were characterized. The result showed that the fruit extract of Solanum dubium extract reached its maximum enzyme activity when the fruits were dark yellow in colour and completely dry. Maximum milk clotting activity was obtained by using freeze-dried extract. The loss in activity of the fruit liquid enzyme as well as solid enzyme form increased significantly at room temperature storage compared to refrigerator storage. Subjecting the extract to 70 ◦C for 10 minutes showed no detrimental effect on its milk coagulating activity. The extract activity was completely destroyed when subjected to 80 ◦C for 20 minuets. The saturation with ammonium sulphate (60 %) gave high milk- clotting activity (5. 03 mg/ml) as well as protein content. The partially purified extract had the highest enzymatic activity at 70 ◦C and pH 10. In the second experiment, the partially purified extract was used in making white cheese. The results indicated that both storage period and salt concentration had significantly affected weight loss and chemical composition of the cheese during storage. Type of milk coagulant (chymosin and Solanum dubium fruit extract) had significant effect on weight loss, total solids, <b>fat,</b> protein, <b>soluble</b> protein, salt, tyrosine and tryptophan. However, it had insignificant effect on titratable acidity and ash contents. Addition of calcium chloride has significantly (P< 0. 05) affected weight loss, total solids, titratable acidity, ash, and salt of the cheese, and gave insignificant effect on <b>fat,</b> protein, <b>soluble</b> protein, tyrosine and tryptophan. Microbiological quality of cheese samples was significantly affected by storage. Type of coagulant and salt level significantly affected flavour, texture, and saltiness of cheese samples.

40|$|Sporadic {{colon cancer}} is a multifactorial aging disease {{affected}} by long-term exposure to environmental risk factors. Epidemiological {{studies have shown that}} risk for colon {{cancer is a}}ssociated with diets high in red meat and/or animal fat. The mechanisms by which colonic tumors arise are, however, poorly understood (see General Introduction, chapter 1). The general hypothesis purports that animal saturated <b>fat</b> increases <b>soluble</b> secondary bile acids and fatty acids in the colonic lumen. These cytolytic surfactants solubilize in the fecal water, damage the colonic epithelium and thus induce a compensatory hyperproliferation, which may increase risk for colon cancer. Previous studies from our laboratory and studies from the literature have indicated, however, that increasing amounts of saturated fat in the diet do not unequivocally increase soluble bile acids and fatty acids in colon. Furthermore, saturated fatty acids may not explain the risk-enhancing effect of red meat, because the contribution of red meat to the total intake of dietary saturated fatty acids is limited. So there may be other factors in red meat that are involved in the association between red meat consumption and colon cancer. Consumption of red meat supplies heme (a tetrapyrrole ring structure with iron), which can also be metabolized to bilirubin. In literature, cytolytic effects of both heme and bilirubin have been described. [...] . Zie: Hoofdstuk 7...|$|R
