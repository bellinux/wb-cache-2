40|$|Students of the MSc {{course in}} Astronautics and Space Engineering 2006 / 07 at Cranfeld University took the Precursor Rendezvous for Impact Mitigation of Asteroids (PRIMA) mission {{as one of}} their group projects.

Large asteroid impacts are acts of nature beyond our ability to mitigate, but the much more frequent impacts with continental rather than global scale can now be prevented in many cases. Effective <b>impact</b> <b>prevention</b> depends on good knowledge of the asteroid threat: the PRIMA mission's goal is to obtain enough information about an asteroid's orbit and composition to enable <b>impact</b> <b>prevention.</b> This PRIMA study's objective is a feasible mission design. The asteroid Apophis was chosen as the prime target because it is representative of the most likely impact risk and it is also the highest current asteroid threat to Earth. To develop the baseline design the team initially identifed a range of mission concepts and then chose the best of these using a trade-off based on the concepts' various attributes. The next phase was to develop outline designs for each sub-system, focussing on issues which could affect mission feasibility. The resulting baseline design consists of a 600 kg spacecraft with electric propulsion and a lander containing a tracking beacon which is placed on Apophis. Asteroid composition is measured by radar and seismometry. All results so far indicate that this concept is feasible, although further work is required especially in the areas of low- thrust trajectories for asteroid rendezvous, and technologies for the tracking transponder, measuring asteroid composition, and attaching equipment to an asteroid where gravity is weak and surface composition is uncertain...|$|E

40|$|An ecosystem-based {{approach}} to bivalve aquaculture management {{is a strategy}} for the integration of aquaculture within the wider ecosystem, including human aspects, {{in such a way}} that it promotes sustainable development, equity, and resilience of ecosystems. Given the linkage between social and ecological systems, marine regulators require an ecosystem-based decision framework that structures and integrates the relationships between these systems and facilitates communication of aquaculture–environment interactions and policy-related developments and decisions. The Drivers-Pressures-State Change-Impact-Response (DPSIR) management framework incorporates the connectivity between human and ecological issues and would permit available performance indicators to be identified and organized in a manner that facilitates different regulatory needs. Suitable performance indicators and modeling approaches, which are used to assess DPSIR framework components, are reviewed with a focus on the key environmental issues associated with bivalve farming. Indicator selection criteria are provided to facilitate constraining the number of indicators within the management framework. It is recommended that an ecosystem-based approach for bivalve aquaculture be based on a tiered indicator monitoring system that is structured on the principle that increased environmental risk requires increased monitoring effort. More than 1 threshold for each indicator would permit implementation of predetermined <b>impact</b> <b>prevention</b> and mitigation measures prior to reaching an unacceptable ecological state.

40|$|Near Earth Object (NEO) {{deflection}} for {{the purpose}} of Earth <b>impact</b> <b>prevention</b> is recognized as a valid and valuable endeavour. NEOTωIST stands for Near-Earth Object Transfer of angular momentum (ω) Spin Test. This describes a demonstration mission intended to develop the capabilities required to execute an effective kinetic impactor NEO deflection mission. The mission concept features several novel aspects. The most important of these are a new technique to quantify momentum transfer from the Impactor spacecraft to the NEO, and the option to use small sub-spacecraft for observation purposes. For momentum transfer measurement, the NEO is struck off-center which changes its spin rate. This rate change, which can be measured from Earth via light curve measurements, allows quantification of the transferred momentum without the need for a rendezvousing observer spacecraft. To gain additional information about the impact geometry and impact physics, the NEOTωIST Impactor may deploy one or several sub-spacecraft from the main Impactor spacecraft shortly before impact. These sub-spacecraft allow observation of the impact event from multiple vantage points some of which are unique because their destruction is accepted. Different mission variations exist depending on whether the mission is implemented with only the Impactor or with a complement of observing sub-spacecraft. The paper discusses these options. Overall, the concept promises comparatively low cost and features capabilities that are unique and valuable for an operational deflection or reconnaissance mission. The overall mission concept and measurement principle are described in detail in a different abstract by L. Drube et al. This paper focuses on the results of a preliminary mission design study with the objective of demonstrating mission feasibility. It analyses the key technical challenges of the mission, and describes the concept of operations as well as geometry design for the impact and fly-by phase of the mission. Further, the communications architecture between the different spacecraft and Earth is discussed, and the preliminary design of the individual spacecraft is presented...|$|E
40|$|Aim: The {{introduction}} of the human papillomavirus (HPV) vaccine enables {{for the first time}} in the history of cancer prevention the possibility of combating the major cause of a cancer even before its onset. The secondary prevention measure of cervical cancer screening has thus been complemented by a primary prevention measure. The aim of this study is to analyse the determinants of uptake of preventive measures against cervical cancer as a basis for comparing the determinants of screening attendance with those of HPV vaccination attendance. Subject and methods: A population-based representative survey comprising 760 randomly selected women aged 14 to 65 was performed in the German federal state of Mecklenburg-Western Pomerania. Prevention behaviour, attitudes towards cervical cancer screening and HPV vaccination, and knowledge about cervical cancer and HPV were investigated by means of a structured questionnaire. Descriptive analyses and multivariate logistic regression analyses were conducted to identify the determinants of screening and HPV vaccine uptake. Results: Attendance both at screening and at HPV vaccination was best predicted by attitudinal factors. Positive connotations of cancer prevention measures and utility expectations, fear of cancer and high subjective risk perception were conducive to attendance at screening and HPV vaccination. Screening attendance was less regular among women of lower socioeconomic status. In contrast, HPV vaccination uptake was higher for young women with lower educational attainment and lower social class. Knowledge did not <b>impact</b> <b>prevention</b> behaviour significantly. There is no trade-off between screening and vaccination attendance; the vast majority of respondents was aware of the necessity of regular screening attendance even when vaccinated against HPV. Conclusions: Uptake rates for existing primary and secondary prevention measures against cervical cancer can be enhanced by fostering perceptions of utility and positive connotations of regular screening and becoming vaccinated against HPV. Elderly women in particular should be encouraged to attend screening by means of a recall system. Given the low overall level of knowledge about cervical cancer and its risk factors, there is a need for education about the necessity and utility of prevention to reach women of all social classes...|$|E
40|$|Young men {{who have}} sex with men (MSM) and MSM of color carry the burden of HIV in the United States and are the {{priority}} target population for the CDC’s High-Impact HIV Prevention approach. This strategy calls for low-cost, large-scale implementation of HIV-prevention interventions, many of which utilize digital media and leverage resources and a sense of connectedness to a larger “gay community. ” However, this broad, sweeping approach reduces a heterogeneous population of men to a single risk behavior and eschews other factors that contribute to their health, likely impeding the ability to address specific needs of different MSM subgroups. More research is needed to understand differences within the MSM population and how they use the Internet and relate to the gay community. ^ The relationship between digital media use and community connectedness was investigated in two samples of young MSM. In the first, YMSM aged 16 – 20 (N = 450) were examined for developmental heterogeneity using latent class and latent profile analyses, and the effect of the differential developmental trajectories on the association between gay-related Internet use and gay community affiliation was modeled using structural equation mixture modeling. In the second sample, the effects of online versus offline relationships at various levels of the social-ecological model on gay community cohesion were compared using multivariable logistic regression among YMSM aged 17 – 29 from two cities (N = 719). ^ Latent class analyses identified 5 classes of experience patterns and 7 developmental trajectory profiles, supporting substantial heterogeneity within the first sample. Developmental trajectories were found to moderate the association between Internet use and community affiliation, suggesting that YMSM in different trajectory profiles use and respond to the Internet differently. Multivariable logistic regressions in the second sample found that only attendance at physical venues was significantly associated with gay community cohesion in both cities and that online relationships at the interpersonal and institutional levels were not associated with cohesion. ^ The findings have implications for High <b>Impact</b> <b>Prevention</b> in that physical-venue-based interventions still show promise at increasing community connectedness, but online media should supplement offline interventions and be tailored to specific subgroups of MSM. ...|$|E
