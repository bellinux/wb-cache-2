Fish were exposed to technical-grade <b>fenvalerate</b> (0. 28 or 23 ng/L) or an emulsifiable-concentrate formulation (16 ng/L) for 36 to 48 h. No significant effects of emulsifiers or <b>fenvalerate</b> concentration on uptake were observed. The overall mean gill uptake efficiency was determined to be 28. 6 + 4. 4 %.

Flow-through acute toxicity testing with measured concentrations of technical-grade <b>fenvalerate</b> and a 30 % active ingredient emulsifiable concentrate (EC) of the insecticide was conducted.
