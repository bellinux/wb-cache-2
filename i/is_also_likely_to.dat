5|$|In 2010, {{international}} {{rail travel}} was liberalised by new European Union directives, designed {{to break up}} monopolies {{in order to encourage}} competition for services between countries. This sparked interest among other companies in providing services in competition to Eurostar and new services to destinations beyond Paris and Brussels. The only rail carrier to formally propose and secure permission for such a service up to now is Deutsche Bahn, which intends to run services between London and Germany and the Netherlands. The sale of High Speed One by the British Government having effectively nationalised LCR in June 2009 <b>is</b> <b>also</b> <b>likely</b> <b>to</b> stimulate competition on the line.|$|E
5|$|According to {{contemporary}} accounts in the Annales Piacentines the College of Cardinals {{was divided into}} adherents of Charles d'Anjou (pars Caroli) and the Imperial party (pars Imperii), but the exact reconstruction of these parties is very difficult. It is almost certain that this account is inaccurate when it claims that pars Caroli had six (or seven, in another place in that account) members, including Giovanni Gaetano Orsini and Ottobono Fieschi, while pars Imperii had eleven (or ten) members, Riccardo Annibaldi, Ottaviano Ubaldini and Uberto Coconati among them. Certainly five cardinals, namely Ottobono Fieschi, Guillame de Bray, Anchero Pantaleone, Simon Monpitie de Brie and Odo of Châteauroux belonged to the Angevin faction. But if Giovanni Gaetano Orsini was really one of their leaders, then his relatives Matteo Orsini Rosso and Giacomo Savelli should also be added here, and since Henry of Segusio <b>is</b> <b>also</b> <b>likely</b> <b>to</b> have belonged to this faction, its true size would have amounted to nine cardinals. Imperial party, on the contrary, could not have had more than ten members, including two who had died during sede vacante.|$|E
5|$|Diseases {{introduced}} to the Americas by the conquistadors had a great impact upon indigenous populations. As the Spanish were occupied with the conquest of Mexico, these diseases ran ahead of them from 1519 onwards. A smallpox epidemic swept through Guatemala in 1520–1521, and <b>is</b> <b>also</b> <b>likely</b> <b>to</b> have spread throughout the Pipil region of El Salvador. By the time the Spanish arrived {{in the area in}} 1524, it is estimated that up to 50% of the native population of El Salvador had already been eliminated by the new diseases, against which they had no immunity. It is likely that disease had significantly weakened the Pipil by the time they fielded large armies against the Spanish at Acajutla and Tacuzcalco. Further waves of epidemic diseases spread across Mesoamerica in 1545–1548, and again in 1576–1581, reducing indigenous populations to just 10% of their pre-contact levels, making successful resistance against the European colonisers extremely difficult. The deadliest of the newly introduced diseases were smallpox, malaria, measles, typhus, and yellow fever. Their introduction was catastrophic in the Americas; it is estimated that 90% of the indigenous population had been eliminated by disease within the first century of European contact.|$|E

25|$|The Navajo, Apache and Comanche peoples <b>were</b> <b>also</b> <b>likely</b> <b>to</b> {{have set}} {{camps in the}} Albuquerque area, as there is {{evidence}} of trade and cultural exchange between the different Native American groups going back centuries before European conquest.|$|R
25|$|Seawater desalination, {{which already}} {{is used in}} some resorts on the Red Sea, <b>is</b> <b>also</b> <b>likely</b> <b>to</b> become an {{increasingly}} important source for municipal water supply in coastal areas of Egypt. For example, in October 2009 the West Delta Electricity Production Company awarded a contract for a power plant with a 10,000 m3/day seawater desalination plant near Alexandria. Brackish water desalination for irrigation may also become more important.|$|E
25|$|Hierarchical checksumming of {{all data}} and metadata, {{ensuring}} that the entire storage system can be verified on use, and confirmed to be correctly stored, or remedied if corrupt. Checksums are stored with a block's parent block, rather than with the block itself. This contrasts with many file systems where checksums (if held) are stored with the data so that if the data is lost or corrupt, the checksum <b>is</b> <b>also</b> <b>likely</b> <b>to</b> be lost or incorrect.|$|E
25|$|Life {{expectancy}} <b>is</b> <b>also</b> <b>likely</b> <b>to</b> {{be affected}} by exposure {{to high levels of}} highway air pollution or industrial air pollution. This is one way that occupation can have a major effect on life expectancy. Coal miners (and in prior generations, asbestos cutters) often have lower life expediencies than average life expediencies. Other factors affecting an individual's life expectancy are genetic disorders, drug use, tobacco smoking, excessive alcohol consumption, obesity, access to health care, diet and exercise.|$|E

25|$|Eating a {{balanced}} diet {{with a range of}} foods from different food groups {{is the best way to}} avoid copper deficiency. In both developed and developing countries, adults, young children, and adolescents who consume diets of grain, millet, tuber, or rice along with legumes (beans) or small amounts of fish or meat, some fruits and vegetables, and some vegetable oil are likely to obtain adequate copper if their total food consumption is adequate in calories. In developed countries where consumption of red meat is high, copper intake <b>is</b> <b>also</b> <b>likely</b> <b>to</b> be adequate.|$|E
25|$|A {{second stage}} freeze <b>is</b> <b>also</b> <b>likely</b> <b>to</b> {{happen with the}} valve open, causing a free flow, which may {{precipitate}} a first stage freeze if not immediately stopped. If the flow through the frozen second stage can be stopped before the first stage freezes, the process can be halted. This may be possible if the second stage is fitted with a shutoff valve, {{but if this is}} done, the first stage must be fitted with an overpressure valve, as closing the supply to the second stage disables its secondary function as an overpressure valve.|$|E
25|$|PD {{patients}} often demonstrate {{deficits in}} their ability to sequence information, or date events. Part of the problems is hypothesized to be due to a more fundamental difficulty in coordinating or planning retrieval strategies, rather than failure at the level of encoding or storing information in memory. This deficit <b>is</b> <b>also</b> <b>likely</b> <b>to</b> be due to an underlying difficulty in properly retrieving script information. PD patients often exhibit signs of irrelevant intrusions, incorrect ordering of events, and omission of minor components in their script retrieval, leading to disorganized and inappropriate application of script information.|$|E

25|$|Because the {{previously}} popular fumigant methyl bromide has been phased {{out in some}} countries under the Montreal Protocol, phosphine is the only widely used, cost-effective, rapidly acting fumigant that does not leave residues on the stored product. Pests {{with high levels of}} resistance toward phosphine have become common in Asia, Australia and Brazil. High level resistance <b>is</b> <b>also</b> <b>likely</b> <b>to</b> occur in other regions, but has not been as closely monitored. Genetic variants that contribute to high level resistance to phosphine have been identified in the dihydrolipoamide dehydrogenase gene. Identification of this gene now allows rapid molecular identification of resistant insects.|$|E
25|$|The African rock python {{is still}} {{relatively}} common {{in many regions}} across Africa, and may adapt to disturbed habitats, provided that food is available. It is not currently considered at risk of extinction, but is listed on Appendix II of the Convention on International Trade in Endangered Species, meaning international trade in African rock pythons should be carefully monitored and controlled, giving wild populations some protection from overcollection for pets and skins. The species <b>is</b> <b>also</b> <b>likely</b> <b>to</b> occur {{in a number of}} protected areas, such as the Serengeti National Park in Tanzania, a World Heritage site.|$|E
25|$|The Ground Forces {{retain a}} very large {{quantity}} of vehicles and equipment. There <b>is</b> <b>also</b> <b>likely</b> <b>to</b> {{be a great deal}} of older equipment in state military storage, a practice continued from the Soviet Union. However, following the collapse of the USSR, the newly independent republics became host to most of the formations with modern equipment, whereas Russia was left with lower-category units, usually with older equipment. As financial stringency began to bite harder, the amount of new equipment fell as well, and by 1998, only ten tanks and about 30 BMP infantry fighting vehicles were being purchased each year.|$|E
50|$|Compared {{to other}} pterosaurs, The pelvis of Sos 2428 was quite large. Due to its size, The reptile's pelvis added {{additional}} volume to the torso, which <b>was</b> <b>also</b> quite large. This large torso <b>was</b> <b>also</b> <b>likely</b> <b>to</b> impair flight capabilities.|$|R

25|$|If {{a search}} or seizure is {{unlawful}} under the Search and Surveillance Act 2012 then it <b>is</b> <b>also</b> <b>likely</b> <b>to</b> {{be considered an}} unreasonable search or seizure. However, the concepts of unlawfulness and unreasonableness are independent and it is therefore possible that, for example, a lawful search can be unreasonable. Despite this, the courts have said {{that in terms of}} the most common remedy of exclusion of evidence an unlawful search should usually be considered an unreasonable search. Elias CJ {{went so far as to}} say that unlawful searches should automatically be unreasonable. An exception is that where the search is only unlawful on minor or technical grounds it may still be reasonable.|$|E
25|$|The Old Chapel Building, {{originally}} the college chapel, {{is one of}} the campus's listed buildings, gaining Grade II listed status on 6 June 1994. It is a two-storey building constructed in gothic style, with Flemish bond brickwork, built on a sandstone plinth in 1842. It <b>is</b> <b>also</b> <b>likely</b> <b>to</b> be the work of Richard Lane. The structure consists of three wings, containing a central hall range, with two domestic wings on each side, initially used as tutor accommodation, forming a symmetrical appearance with the gable end of the upper hall. For many years, this was used as a library and lecture theatre. The ground floor eventually became the student union, and contained a bar and café. The first floor was used as the base of ESRI (Education and Social Research Institute) and lecture space.|$|E
25|$|The olefin feed to an {{alkylation}} unit generally originates from a FCCU {{and contains}} butene, isobutene, and possibly propene and/or amylenes. The olefin feed <b>is</b> <b>also</b> <b>likely</b> <b>to</b> contain diluents (such as propane, n-butane, and n-pentane), noncondensables (such as ethane and hydrogen) and contaminants. Diluants in principle {{have no effect}} on the reaction of alkylation but occupy a portion of the reactor and can influence the yield of secondary reactions of polymerisation and of undesired organofluorine side products. Incondensable are from a chemical perspective similar to diluents but they do not condense at the pressure and temperature of the process, and therefore they concentrate to a point that must be vented. Contaminants are compounds that react with and/or dilute the sulfuric acid catalyst. They increase acid consumption and contribute to produce undesirable reaction products and increase polymer formation. Common contaminants are water, methanol and ethanol.|$|E
