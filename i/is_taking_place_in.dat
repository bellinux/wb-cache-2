5|$|Quolls eat smaller mammals, small birds, lizards, and insects. Their natural {{lifespan}} {{is between}} two and five years. All species have drastically declined in numbers since Australasia was colonised by Europeans, with one species, the eastern quoll, becoming extinct on the Australian mainland, now being found only in Tasmania. Major threats to their survival include the cane toad, predators, urban development, and poison baiting. Conservation efforts include breeding programs in captivity, one of which <b>is</b> <b>taking</b> <b>place</b> <b>in</b> Tasmania with support from Rewilding Australia and Conjour.|$|E
5|$|After {{exploring}} {{a number of}} the game's locations, the apprentice gains access to a guarded tunnel and is astonished to discover what lies on the other side. Whereas the valley where Drypeak is located is a dustbowl devoid of vegetation, the lands {{on the other side of}} the tunnel are lush and green, meaning highly illegal shaping <b>is</b> <b>taking</b> <b>place</b> <b>in</b> secret. Serviles, the Shapers' slaves created from life essence, show abnormal intelligence and self-awareness. While still reeling from the revelation of what lies beyond Drypeak, the Shaper apprentice discovers that Shanti has disappeared during one of her escapes from her armed escorts, her necklace lay broken on the grass outside the tunnel. At this point, approximately a quarter of the way through the game, the player's choices expand considerably.|$|E

5|$|The American online {{magazine}} InformationWeek reports {{that much of}} the software/IT activity in Romania <b>is</b> <b>taking</b> <b>place</b> <b>in</b> Cluj-Napoca, which is quickly becoming Romania's technopolis. Nokia invested 200million euros in a mobile telephone factory near Cluj-Napoca; this began production in February 2008 and closed in December 2011. It also opened a research centre in the city that was shut down in April 2011. The former Nokia factory was purchased by Italian appliance manufacturer De'Longhi. The city houses regional or national headquarters of MOL, Aegon, Emerson, De'Longhi, Bechtel, FrieslandCampina, Office Depot, Genpact and New Yorker. Bosch has also built a factory near Cluj-Napoca, in the same industrial park as De'Longhi.|$|E
5|$|Feathers become abraded {{over time}} and all birds need to replace them at intervals. Barn owls are {{particularly}} dependent {{on their ability to}} fly quietly and manoeuvre efficiently, and in temperate areas their prolonged moult lasts through three phases over a period of two years. The female starts to moult while incubating the eggs and brooding the chicks, a time when the male feeds her so she does not need to fly much. The first primary feather to be shed is the central one, number 6, and it has regrown completely by the time the female resumes hunting. Feathers 4, 5, 7 and 8 are dropped at a similar time the following year and feathers 1, 2, 3, 9 and 10 in the bird's third year of adulthood. The secondary and tail feathers are lost and replaced over a similar timescale, again starting while incubation <b>is</b> <b>taking</b> <b>place.</b> <b>In</b> the case of the tail, the two outermost tail feathers are first shed followed by the two central ones, the other tail feathers being moulted the following year.|$|E
5|$|In the 2011 census, the {{population}} of Dorchester was 19,060, with further people coming from surrounding areas {{to work in the}} town which has six industrial estates. The Brewery Square redevelopment project <b>is</b> <b>taking</b> <b>place</b> <b>in</b> phases, with other development projects planned. The town has a land-based college, Kingston Maurward College, the Thomas Hardye Upper School, three middle schools and thirteen first schools. The Dorset County Hospital offers an accident and emergency service, and the town is served by two railway stations. Through vehicular traffic is routed round the town by means of a bypass. The town has a football club and a rugby union club, several museums and the biannual Dorchester Festival. It is twinned with three towns in Europe. As well as having many listed buildings, a number of notable people have been associated with the town. It was for many years the home and inspiration of the author Thomas Hardy, whose novel The Mayor of Casterbridge uses a fictionalised version of Dorchester as its setting.|$|E

25|$|Stevens (1982) {{suggests}} that ethology and analytical psychology are both disciplines trying to comprehend universal phenomena. Ethology {{shows us that}} each species is equipped with unique behavioural capacities that are adapted to its environment and 'even allowing for our greater adaptive flexibility, we are no exception. Archetypes are the neuropsychic centres responsible for co-ordinating the behavioural and psychic repertoire of our species'. Following Bowlby, Stevens points out that genetically programmed behaviour <b>is</b> <b>taking</b> <b>place</b> <b>in</b> the psychological relationship between mother and newborn. The baby's helplessness, its immense repertoire of sign stimuli and approach behaviour, triggers a maternal response. And the smell, sound and shape of mother triggers, for instance, a feeding response.|$|E

Reactor projects in Eastern Europe are essentially replacing old Soviet reactors shut down due to safety concerns.
