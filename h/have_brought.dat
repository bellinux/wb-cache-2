5|$|First {{proposed}} in 2008 by the New York City Department of Transportation, Citi Bike's scheduled 2011 opening was delayed by Hurricane Sandy and technological problems. It officially opened in May 2013 with 332 stations and 6,000 bikes. Annual expansions <b>have</b> <b>brought</b> the totals to 706 stations and 12,000 bikes , making the service the largest bike sharing {{program in the}} United States.|$|E
5|$|Hurricanes {{that affect}} California are mainly the {{remnants}} of hurricanes or tropical storms. In the twentieth century, only four eastern Pacific tropical cyclones <b>have</b> <b>brought</b> tropical storm-force winds to the Continental United States: the 1939 Long Beach Tropical Storm, Tropical Storm Joanne in 1972, Tropical Storm Kathleen in 1976, and Tropical Storm Nora in 1997.|$|E

50|$|The {{campaign}} <b>has</b> <b>brought</b> {{in significant}} pro bono advertising support from {{agencies such as}} Ogilvy Advertising, Tullo Marshall Warren, MTV, and Metro, and most recently Topman and BMB.

60|$|The irrepressible Chancellor of the Exchequer {{was still}} talking about the birds he <b>had</b> <b>brought</b> down, the birds that Burke and Halkett <b>had</b> <b>brought</b> down, and the birds that Jenkins, their host, had failed to bring down.

5|$|Rowling and her {{publishers}} <b>have</b> <b>brought</b> {{a series}} of legal injunctions to ensure the books' secrecy before their launch. These injunctions have drawn criticism from civil liberties campaigners over their potentially sweeping powers over individual freedoms.|$|E
5|$|Sorabji {{appears to}} have had a {{difficult}} relationship with his father. Although the father was musically cultured and financed the publication of several of Sorabji's compositions (enabling 14 of them to be published between 1921 and 1931), he did not want his son to become a musician. He is also alleged to <b>have</b> <b>brought</b> about the end of his wife's singing career.|$|E

5|$|The {{final scene}} (set 8 months later) shows {{the changes that}} Borat's {{observations}} from America <b>have</b> <b>brought</b> to his village, including the apparent conversion {{of the people to}} Christianity (the Kazakh version of which includes crucifixion and torturing of Jews) and the introduction of computer-based technology, such as iPods, laptop computers and a high-definition, LCD television.|$|E
5|$|Academic {{study of}} Barbadian music remains limited. Some song {{collections}} {{and other activities}} have been conducted, but there remain significant holes in scholarship, such as the musics of recent immigrants from China and India, who presumably <b>have</b> <b>brought</b> with them styles of Indian and Chinese musics. Due {{to a lack of}} archaeological and historical records, the island's indigenous music is unknown. Since the 1970s, an increase in general interest in Barbadian culture has spurred greater study of music, and given an incentive to radio and television stations to create and maintain archives of cultural practices.|$|E
5|$|Allen was prosperous by {{this stage}} of his life. An {{inheritance}} from his mother, his earnings on the Stock Exchange {{and the success of}} investments he had made in Australia left him affluent—his knowledge of Australian markets was respected in the City. In 1965, Allen underwent the first of four hip operations spread over the following 14 years; he believed that his fast bowling may <b>have</b> <b>brought</b> about his hip problems.|$|E
5000|$|During the 2012 Summer Paralympics it was {{reported}} that coaches and escorts of the Indian Team were denied accommodation in the Games Village because their permits were being used by officials of the Paralympic Committee of India. [...] The Team's 10 athletes were to be assisted by six coaches and five escorts, but only two escorts were given passes; Paralympic Committee general Secretary Ratan Singh confirmed that he <b>had</b> <b>brought</b> his son, that the Committee president <b>had</b> <b>brought</b> his wife, and the treasurer <b>had</b> <b>brought</b> his wife and daughter.|$|R

5|$|Captain John Saris may <b>have</b> <b>brought</b> back {{examples}} of toy spaniels from his voyage to Japan in 1613, a theory proposed by Commodore Matthew C. Perry during his expeditions to Japan {{on behalf of}} the United States in the mid-19th century. He noted that dogs were a common gift and thought that the earlier voyage of Captain Saris introduced a Japanese type of spaniel into England.|$|E
5|$|Clovis sites dated at 13,500 {{years ago}} were {{discovered}} in western North America during the 1930s. Clovis peoples were regarded as the first widespread Paleo-Indian inhabitants of the New World and ancestors to all indigenous peoples in the Americas. Archaeological discoveries in {{the past thirty years}} <b>have</b> <b>brought</b> forward other distinctive knapping cultures who occupied the Americas from the lower Great Plains to the shores of Chile.|$|E
5|$|Elvis {{might never}} have been born, but someone else would surely <b>have</b> <b>brought</b> the world rock 'n' roll. No such logic {{accounts}} for Bob Dylan. No iron law of history demanded that a would-be Elvis from Hibbing, Minnesota, would swerve through the Greenwich Village folk revival to become the world's first and greatest rock 'n' roll beatnik bard and then—having achieved fame and adoration beyond reckoning—vanish into a folk tradition of his own making.|$|E

60|$|He {{turned to}} walk home, meditating. The day <b>had</b> <b>brought</b> him nothing {{that he hoped}} for, but--surely this was worth many days--it <b>had</b> <b>brought</b> him nearer to Maisie.

5|$|In 2011, the BBC and {{commercial}} radio operators launched RadioPlayer which allows over 400 radio stations to be listened to through its website and apps. In addition various {{radio stations and}} third parties allow streaming of internet radio stations through their own websites and apps.

In recent years, the growth of two specific festivals <b>have</b> <b>brought</b> recognition and notoriety for their cultural impact, attendance and revenues for both Oktoberfest and Scotfest. Both are considered in the top 5 for festivals of their kind in the United States.|$|E
5|$|In {{terms of}} social class the average American may be {{referred}} to as being either a member of the middle or working class. The discrepancy is largely the result of differing class models and definitions of what constitutes a member of the middle class. Currently the vast majority of Americans self-identify as middle class, yet some experts in the field such Michael Zweig of Stony Brook University or Dennis Gilbert of Cornell University <b>have</b> <b>brought</b> forth different theories. As most Americans are neither professionals nor managers and lack college degrees the average American may be described as being either or both, lower middle and working class.|$|E
