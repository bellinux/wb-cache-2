According to Stauffer, [...] "the disarming deflation of the passage <b>goes</b> <b>a</b> <b>long</b> <b>way</b> <b>toward</b> redeeming it, and {{is typical of the}} winning contradictions of the narrator's style". Tom Pocock in Rider Haggard and the Lost Empire has also highlighted the [...] "literary framework" [...] that Haggard constructs throughout much of the narrative, referencing Keats, Shakespeare, and Classical literature to imbue the story with a [...] "Gothic sensibility". Yet as Stauffer notes, [...] "Ultimately, however, one thinks of Haggard's plots, episodes, and images as the source of his lasting reputation and influence.|$|E
500|$|David Browne of Entertainment Weekly wrote, [...] "For all her grapplings with self-enlightenment, Madonna {{seems more}} relaxed and less {{contrived}} than she's been in years, {{from her new}} Italian earth-mother makeover to, especially, her music. Ray of Light is truly like a prayer, and you know she'll take you there." [...] Roni Sarig, in a review for City Pages, was most impressed by Madonna's vocal range, depth, and clarity and called Ray of Light [...] "her richest, most accomplished record yet." [...] Music critic Robert Hilburn from Los Angeles Times wrote, [...] "One reason why her new Ray of Light is the most satisfying album of her career is that it reflects the soul-searching {{of a woman who}} is at a point in her life where she can look at herself with surprising candor and perspective." [...] Writing for Melody Maker in February 1998, Mark Roland drew comparisons with the music of St Etienne and Björk's Homogenic album, highlighting Ray of Lights lack of cynicism as its most positive aspect: [...] "It's not an album turned on the lathe of cynical pop manipulation, rather it's been squished out of a lump of clay on a foot-powered wheel. Lovingly teased into life, Ray of Light is like the ugly mug that doesn't match but is all the more special because of it." [...] Joan Anderman from The Boston Globe said that Ray of Light is a remarkable album. He described it as a deeply spiritual dance record, ecstatically textured, a serious cycle of songs that <b>goes</b> <b>a</b> <b>long</b> <b>way</b> <b>toward</b> liberating Madonna from a career built on scavenged images and cultivated identities. Robert Christgau was less impressed in Playboy, deeming Ray of Light a [...] "great-sounding" [...] but average record because of enlightenment themes that always yield awkward results for pop entertainers, although he praised sensual songs such as [...] "Skin" [...] and [...] "Candy Perfume Girl".|$|E

Scenario about a troubled Los Angeles adolescent who gains {{a sense of purpose}} at her father’s Bahamian research center may have special resonance with tween and teen girls. But it could be difficult to hook that target demographic during the pic’s theatrical run, so Dolphin may not net a profit until it swims into ancillary tributaries." ...|$|E

The element ræd in unræd is the element in Æthelred's name which means [...] "counsel". Thus Æþelræd Unræd is a pun meaning [...] "Noble counsel, No counsel".

Dan Milliken of Country Universe gave the song a B rating, stating that although [...] "the melody and production {{are reminiscent of}} Little Big Town’s best rustic country-rock, and there’s a much more commanding hook here than “Dead Flowers” had, the effort is compromised by throwaway lines. The shortage of lyrical meat gives the song an “undeveloped storyboard” kind of feel, but the overall energy of the execution <b>goes</b> <b>a</b> <b>long</b> <b>way</b> <b>toward</b> making up for it." [...] Bobby Peacock of Roughstock gave a generally favorable review as well, noting that the song [...] "shows a sense of growth — a sense to become even more lyrically-oriented than on even her critically acclaimed first two albums" [...] but adding that he considered the bridge undeveloped.|$|E

They {{also noted that}} the story [...] "has no actual ending", but rather [...] "is something of a slice of life...its interest lies in the struggle that goes on {{in the heart of the}} naturally ferocious, brutal Rawden, turned gentle by sheer determination". A review in Variety (1918) praised Hart saying, [...] "he was a good actor long before he thought of going into pictures... he now reveals one more artistic accomplishment - that of an intelligent, careful, painstaking director. The detail in the preparation of the feature <b>goes</b> <b>a</b> <b>long</b> <b>way</b> <b>toward</b> enhancing its value". The Motion Picture Magazine (1918), said that [...] "one celluloidic thing is as inevitable as fates and taxes-that William S. Hart starts each new picture career as a bad man and ends it by being completely reformed... like the excess tax, it is an excess reformation".|$|E

The second season received a rating of 80%, based on 10 reviews, with an average rating of 7.7/10. The consensus reads, [...] "Though The Blacklist flirts with narrative overload, it's held together by James Spader's scenery-eating performance and wildly entertaining action." [...] The third season received a rating of 92%, based on 12 reviews, with an average rating of 7.4/10.

[...] (Rinaldi, Denver Post) [...] "With sublime, powerful, expressive voices, superstars Stephanie Blythe and Elizabeth Futral were a joy to behold, deserving of their robust ovations. ...

5000|$|T.P. Wiseman saw {{the role}} of Troucillus in Bellum Gallicum 1 as one {{indication}} of the breadth of Caesar's intended audience. Wiseman argues that the commentaries were first published serially, with a year-by-year account to keep Caesar and his achievements vivid {{in the mind of}} the public (populus) on whose support he counted as a popularist leader. The seven individual books were then collected and supplemented by Aulus Hirtius at the end of the 50s or beginning of the 40s. [...] "Publication" [...] in ancient Rome relied less on the circulation of written copies than on public and private readings, which were an important form of entertainment; this circumstance, Wiseman intuits, <b>goes</b> <b>a</b> <b>long</b> <b>way</b> <b>toward</b> explaining Caesar's narrative use of the third person in regard to himself, since the audience would be hearing the words spoken by a reader. In addition to public relations efforts among the Roman people, Wiseman believes that Caesar would have sent readers to the Narbonensis, the Mediterranean region of Gaul already under Roman administration, because he required Narbonese support at his back if he was to succeed in independent Gaul.|$|E
5000|$|J.Lo {{received}} {{mixed reviews}} from contemporary music critics. At Metacritic, which assigns a normalized rating out of 100 to reviews from mainstream critics, the album received an average score of 52 based on 11 reviews. Michael Padletta was positive {{in his review}} for Billboard, praising Lopez for [...] "assembling a sophomore set that's brimming with irresistibly hip-hop spiked songs ... The result is a set with hip, decidedly time-sensitive feel, which <b>goes</b> <b>a</b> <b>long</b> <b>way</b> <b>toward</b> giving Lopez the credibility she'll {{need to develop a}} long-term music career." [...] He also praised Lopez's voice, writing that it [...] "sounds more confident, as she takes more chances with a voice that is technically limited but well-suited to the material she handles". Amy Linden of Sonic.net particularly praised the album for being [...] "a feisty, damn-I-know-I'm-all-that attitude, combined with pulsating, insistent beats that leap out of the speakers and make you wanna move". AllMusic's Stephen Thomas Erlewine gave the album a rating of three-out-of-five-stars, describing it as [...] "essentially the same album" [...] as On the 6 and was unfavorable of its running length. However, he noted, [...] "it has just about the same number of strong songs, all of which sounding of a piece with 'On the 6', which makes it a success on a certain level." ...|$|E
