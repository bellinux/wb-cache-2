To improve the performance for detecting the ion current, the center electrode of the ignition plug are used for the positive pole of the bias power. 3. To overcome the lack of repeatability of the ion current magnitude, the following new controlled variables are introduced for the combustion control. • For the air fuel ratio control, the variation rate of the ion current duration (ICOD) are used. • For <b>knocking</b> <b>control,</b> the variation rate of the magnitude of ion current filtered through the frequency band corresponding to knocking are used...|$|R
