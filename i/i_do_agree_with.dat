There are the Southamptonites who date the sonnets from 1592–1596, and believe the first 125 sonnets to be in chronological order, the dark lady being Elizabeth Vernon, and the Rival Poet to be Drayton. Gray continues with the next group of critics being Pembrokists, dating the sonnets from 1598 to 1603, the dark lady being Mary Fitton, and the Rival Poet being Chapman. Gray believes, following with Sir Sidney Lee, that the sonnets are literary exercises, {{it is important to}} figure who the dark lady is, that W.H. is not the youth addressed in the first 125 sonnets, the sonnets are in no chronological order, and he had no idea who the rival poet was. Gray proclaims his view, [...] "I am a free lance among the Sonnets' critics with a special set of conjectures all my own; though <b>I</b> <b>do</b> <b>agree</b> <b>with</b> Butler that that W.H. is William Hughes, with Acheson that the Dark Lady is Mistress Davanant, and with Montmorency that the Rival Poet is Spenser." ...|$|E

The outpouring of support and the show of appreciation that {{has been given to}} me from friends, fans and my peers has been just tremendous. …overwhelming even. <b>I</b> <b>do</b> <b>agree</b> <b>with</b> Joe’s post. Pearl Jam has always seemingly had a perceived level of integrity and has been known to stand their ground & fight the good fight, but it seems the allure of being given this trophy is just to important for them to take a stand. I want to let you all know that ultimately, it’s gonna be okay. We still have the music and no amount of corporate conglomerate or ticky-tack bullshit can keep us from enjoying the power of the music we love. The fact that we find ourselves fighting for the integrity of the validity of a segment of Pearl Jam history to be acknowledged is straight up beautiful. The reason we have to is what the Rock & Roll Hall of Fame is supposed to have been built to celebrate; The love of the music. I have always thought that every award given to a band that celebrates the bands lifetime achievements should be awarded to every person that was ever a debt incurring, life sacrificing, blood spilling, member of that band. Maybe the Hall should reevaluate the need to put all the monkeys in the same cage in order to boost revenue, and instead let the history of the band be fully and completely represented as they were and as they are. …leave it up to the group to show their true colors as they celebrate their own history in a manner of their choosing. I don’t know. But whoever is ultimately responsible for the decision that deemed my work with Pearl Jam as an effort that was not important enough to grant me induction knows nothing of what we accomplished, and I am personally {{at a loss for words}} for how Stone, Mike, Jeff, Matt, Edward and Kelly Curtis are accepting of such an injustice. I will admit to wanting to look out over my drum kit at the faces of Jeff, Stone, Mike and Eddie. Looking to my left at my drum tech, the mainest of mellow, Mr. Jimmy Shoaf and seeing him give me that look that dares me to destroy my cymbals and kick the songs ass, the bands ass and the crowds ass… The idea of counting it off and giving the band, the music & the people all that I have to give, as I always have without compromise or hesitation… The sound of the people singing along… Making eye contact with the person air drumming their ass off right before the big drum fill, so we can do it together…I loved it. I loved it every single time. If you were there, then you know what this band Pearl Jam was like when it had something to prove. Well, we proved it every single time. Show after show. I was there and I am still proud to be a part of what Pearl Jam was. My point in all of this is to share the fact that what Pearl Jam once was, is what is still, and will always be Pearl Jam. I know things are tough. We need music, each other and the spirit of Rock & Roll now, more than ever before. Thanks for everything, everyone. I for one have not and will not ever forget the incredible power of the times we shared together. Be all. David Abbruzzese" ...|$|E
40|$|I deeply {{appreciate}} the careful comments from Pitak-Arnnop et al. on potential pitfalls {{of the article}} entitled “Transplantation of cryopreservation teeth: a systematic review”. In general, the review publications in basic biomedical science (either by invitation or proposal submission) were performed by well-known experts in particular fields. These traditional literature review articles provide in depth information in recent scientific advancements; however, the information selection and presentation biases may occur. A systematic review is usually employed in clinical medicine to minimize these biases. One encourages the use of systematic reviews in many fields, including basic biomedical science, and urge editors (both basic science and clinical journals) to promote a systematic review process in the “Instruction for Author ” section of their journals. In this review article, I attempt to emphasize the employment of the systematic review process to evaluate, methodologically, the information from basic science knowledge. Therefore, {{as stated in the}} publication, the aim of the article was to examine the research articles regarding biological and mechanical properties of cryopreserved teeth. The determination of inclusion criteria in this article was performed by a single researcher. One may argue for potential selection bias, and I concur that the bias can be minimized by addition of other researchers. <b>I</b> <b>do</b> <b>agree</b> <b>with</b> Pitak-Arnnop et al’s suggestion on the use of various search engines.

40|$|Chris Copper {{begins his}} {{discussion}} by writing: ‘Quite simply the tourism sector does not engage with tourism researchers: indeed the sector {{could be seen}} as a research-averse (Cooper and Ruhanen 2002). ’ This statement has a number of parts. Firstly, {{there is a lack of}} engagement, and secondly the attributed reason given for the lack is that the sector ‘{{could be seen as}} risk-adverse’. To me this is the ‘pot calling the kettle black’. The engagement between academics and industry is a two way street. Some academics may decide not to engage with industry for a number of logical reasons and they may also be thought of as risk-adverse. <b>I</b> <b>do</b> <b>agree</b> <b>with</b> Chris Cooper that lack of engagement between researchers and the tourism sector is a real phenomenon, a serious problem, and not one that tourism academics should dismiss. Indeed a lack of engagement has caused, in Australia at least, a marginalisation of university tourism academics and at least in part a loss of support for university tourism departments which are then either closed or absorbed into a business school. I consider that the reasons for a lack of engagement are not only the risk-adverse nature of parts of the tourism sector, but that this is one of a number of antecedents. In effect, I am attributing a portion of the blame to tourism researchers. Griffith Business School, Department of Tourism, Sport and Hotel ManagementFull Tex...|$|E

In our previous Congress, in Barcelona, we showed some of these images, obtained by direct digital processing of bitmaps. In another Congress, later, we showed some other images, obtained by rendering, with simple local models (Phong models) and some tricks that helped to make them more realistic. Although <b>I</b> <b>do</b> <b>agree</b> <b>with</b> the old chinese saying that a good image is worth a thousand words, in this case, I have thought more convenient to present a paper that may be read quietly by those interested in these subjects, that might be useful just as it gathers references known by many but grouped in a particular order, and that pretends, respectfully, to criticize the actual situation. This can explain why we consider that the results we have obtained should be improved by new and better techniques and why we think that this dissatisfaction should be shared by others who do not seem to feel the same as we do. The aim of this contribution is, therefore, to reflect on the actual situation and the ways there seem to be open for us to follow. ...|$|E

I would like to bear witness to the rapid advancement of SiC technology by giving a slighty updated account of SiC technology.  The boule growth of SiC now achieves diameters up to 60 mm. One of the most problematic standing issues is the presence of micropipes in the wafers with a density of the order of 100 cm- 2 or more [2].  The doping range available in epilayers is now wider. CAFE Research [3] accepts orders for doping densities from 5 × 1015 cm- 3 to 1 × 1019 cm- 3 in both N and P type. However their {{state of the art}} is better (we have received P type with doping 4 × 1014 cm- 3 and N type with doping over 2 × 1019 cm- 3 and they have also delivered [4] N type doping of 5 × 1014 cm- 3). As for large P dopings, Dmitriev has published [5] dopings over 1020 cm- 3  The specific resistance of contacts on N type layers has also rapidly improved. Kelner has published results of 3 × 10 - 6 Ohm. cm 2 with Ni contacts [6]. We have obtained with molybdenum [7] specific resistances of 2 × 10 - 5 Ohm. cm 2 on epitaxies doped to 5 × 1018 cm- 3 This value should be rapidly lowered as higher doped layers are used.  In sum, <b>I</b> <b>do</b> <b>agree</b> <b>with</b> the authors of [1] that the technology of 6 H SiC is rapidly advancing, thanks to breakthroughs in material growth and to a wide ranging renewed interest in this material.

40|$|The Law and Literature {{approach}} {{has become one}} of the most promising ways to go about observing the legal phenomenon. I will not trace out the way this {{approach has}} developed, for which purpose there is an abundance of critical essays the reader can refer to, but I will point out that Law and Literature has a long history even in Europe (Sansone 2001) and is very much thriving here (Aristodemou 2000; Buescu-Trabuco-Ribeiro 2010; Gaakeer 2007; Gaakeer and Ost 2008; Garapon and Salas 2008; González 2008; Mittica 2009; Ost et al. 2001; Ost 2004; Pozzo 2010; Ward 1995, 2004; Williams 2005), as it is in other countries outside the United States (Melkevik 2010), most notably in Australia (Dolin 2007) and less notably in Latin America (Coaguila Valdivia 2009; Karam Trindade, Gubert, and Neto 2008 a, 2008 b; Lopes 2006; Schwartz and Trindade 2008). Also testifying to the growing interest in this interdisciplinary approach is the large following attracted by the Italian Society for Law and Literature (ISLL), established in June 2008 at the University of Bologna with the aim of promoting Law and Literature and, more broadly still, Law and the Humanities: an international network has been set up linking some of the most prominent organizations devoted to this approach; an online multilingual journal called ISLL Papers has since been founded, and also a library that extends its scope so as to also keep a close eye on the research being conducted in this field in different parts of the world and from different disciplinary perspectives. It is too early to have a proper assessment of this experience, to be sure, but at least one observation can be made from the outset as far as the society’s membership is concerned. There has gathered around ISLL a community of scholars coming from a variety of disciplines, bringing a perspective both internal to law and external to it. From an internal viewpoint we have the legal sciences and the different branches of positive law, and we concomitantly have a number of disciplines traditionally engaged in observing law from an external viewpoint, such as philosophy, history (ancient, medieval, and modern), and the sociology and anthropology of law. The area that ISLL has come to stretch over is, in this sense, spontaneously interdisciplinary. Interdisciplinarity, as is known, offers great opportunities for any scholarly enterprise, but at the same time it also increases more than anything else the risk of lapsing into improvisation and dilettantism. Our aim is to work out investigative models that can be shared among different disciplinary perspectives, in such a way as to find a common language and to proceed bringing to bear the expertise distinctive to each participant. This need is the order of the day on the agenda for this field of study, and the process, especially as Europe is concerned, has gotten off to a good start through the effort François Ost. While <b>I</b> <b>do</b> <b>agree</b> <b>with</b> Posner (2009) in criticizing interdisciplinarity as an idle pursuit when undertaken in a superficial way, I argue, contrary to Posner’s view, that through a process involving a theoretical exchange with methodological controls on the data to be analyzed, Law and the Humanities makes it possible to observe the law in a useful and rigorous way, and not just to recover law’s aesthetic dimension, with a view to providing an ethical vantage point on the law for those who will be dealing with legal questions. There are three objectives in particular I will be focusing on: (a) to present a model I have called normative narration (Mittica 2006), a model understood as the main engine driving the processes of normative construction, and developed by drawing on concepts and insights pertaining to different disciplines; (b) to frame a new way of looking at the distinction between law and literature; and (c) to come at a definition of law as narrative, as well as to see how other types of narrative produced within a culture can be considered normative...|$|E
40|$|Europe's world debating forumThe {{article by}} Brinkhorst, a long-time {{political}} observer and political participant {{of the process}} of European integration, is in my opinion based on a mix of nostalgia, political ambitions which he sees for the Low Countries and an analysis of the current difficult institutional position of the European Union. The Europe of the six founding members, three of which were indeed the Benelux countries, enlarged by three more members in 1973, after difficult and politically arduous debates (i. e. the French position), was the period during which Mr. Brinkhorst started his European career, {{and it seems to be}} a sort of reference point in his reasoning. Examples of this can be found in his mentioning of several of the founding fathers and influential statesmen during this period and other pivotal times in the formation of the European institutions. The fact that several of those "wise men" were from the Low Countries seems to be part of his call for renewed political leadership from those same countries. In fact, during the process leading up to the European constitution, several experienced politicians from those states were consulted and played a central role (e. g. Jean-Luc Dehaene, ex-prime minister of Belgium). What Brinkhorst seems to underestimate, is that this type of ideational and technical exercises are fundamentally different in nature from the normal functioning of the European institutions. Political preferences of large states, and especially coalitions of larger states, are of much more importance in most cases. That does not mean that smaller member states don’t have a significant role to play, but to recall the period of six, nine or even ten members as a reference point does seem to lack applicability for the current context of an enlarged Europe. Another element of nostalgia is Brinkhorst’s reference to the role of the Benelux. He assumes that the Benelux is somehow an international organisation that has the potential to weigh significantly on EU policy making and more importantly on a certain political balance within the EU. Without underestimating the specific historical contribution of the Benelux, attributing much weight, or even political hope in the Benelux strikes me as rather unrealistic. It is now an organisation with very few responsibilities, little symbolic meaning and scant political impact. To think that a revival of the Benelux could be a trigger for the EU to sort out the current institutional crisis strikes me as highly nostalgic and unrealistic. Mr. Brinkhorst attributes recent important differences in opinion between the Netherlands and Belgium on fundamental aspects of European politics and policies to emotions that should be put aside. In my opinion, these differences reflect rather different ideological beliefs about the role of the EU, and probably more importantly, different views on specific European policy options. To dismiss those as insignificant emotions to be set aside for the ‘greater good’ strikes me as a simplification of things. It seems to be the case that the EU is not exactly waiting for a stronger Benelux, or a united Belgian-Dutch position. The institutional infrastructure of the EU is seriously deficient to function with 27 members of large diversity. Here <b>I</b> <b>do</b> <b>agree</b> <b>with</b> Mr. Brinkhorst. I also go along with his observation that smaller countries like Belgium and the Netherlands have, in general, more to gain from well functioning institutions than from a fight over their own relative weight in the Union (24 or 25 votes). In that sense the two countries can each in their own way be catalysts by formulating creative ideas, stimulating solutions with high collective gains, and ‘leading’ like-minded, yet younger members of the EU. If there is one advantage that Belgium, the Netherlands (and to go along with the Benelux idea, also Luxemburg) share, it is a long history of multilateralism and loyal membership in international organisations. Given their own relatively small political weight they have learned how to behave in certain international contexts in order to maximise their benefits through collective solutions. The new members, with their limited experience with these matters (during the Cold War period they hardly participated in a serious way in international institutions) cannot be expected to be ‘lead states’ in the same way. Belgium, the Netherlands and other small states, e. g. the Scandinavian countries, do have experience as lead states, coalition builders, ideational leadership, etc. The EU needs such leadership, ideas and creativity. This could come from smaller states. In conclusion, Brinkhorst’s contribution does provide interesting observations about the role of Belgium and the Netherlands in the history of European integration. A number of those seem to form the basis for a more personal account in the form of political memoirs. I do, however, tend to disagree with much of the argumentation about the potential role of the Benelux, and more fundamentally the assumption of a sort of ‘innate’ calling for smaller countries in processes of international integration. While there are often good reasons for smaller states to be strong defenders for collective action through different forms of regional integration, there is no particular reason to presume that this is a given. Let alone use that argument to argue that countries like Belgium and the Netherlands ought to set their different opinions aside because they are based on emotions rather than interests or differences in political insight. status: publishe...|$|E
