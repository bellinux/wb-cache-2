5000|$|Jean Maritz (1680-1743), also Johan Maritz, was a Swiss inventor, born in Burgdorf, Canton of Bern, {{who moved}} to France, {{becoming}} [...] "Commissaire des Fontes" [...] at Strasbourg (Commissionner of the King's Foundry), and invented the vertical drilling machine, {{as well as the}} <b>horizontal</b> <b>drilling</b> <b>machine</b> for cannons in the 18th century. His inventions revolutionized cannon-making, and became a key component of the de Vallière system, and contributed {{to the development of the}} later Gribeauval system.|$|E
40|$|WO 200017487 A UPAB: 20000531 NOVELTY - The {{controller}} has n {{input interface}} for receiving actual values of control parameters for the drilling machine (3) and an output unit for outputting control {{signals to the}} machine. A fuzzy controller (7) between the input interface and the output unit derives the control signals for driving the drilling machine from the actual values and demand values taking into account heuristic process steps using fuzzy logic. DETAILED DESCRIPTION - An INDEPENDENT CLAIM is also included for a method of controlling a <b>horizontal</b> <b>drilling</b> <b>machine.</b> USE - For controlling a <b>horizontal</b> <b>drilling</b> <b>machine</b> with a drilling lance driven via a drilling rod. ADVANTAGE - Enables a drill head to be maintained automatically and very accurately on a predefined course without the intervention of an experienced drill operator and the drilling target to be reached independently of soil consistency fluctuations...|$|E

40|$|A part of {{the drill}} string – the swivel (rotational connector) – accomplishes an {{important}} task in the <b>horizontal</b> <b>drilling.</b> Its malfunctioning {{makes it impossible to}} draw in (install) large diameter and length pipelines. The causes of the connector break-down during the <b>horizontal</b> <b>drilling</b> are investigated in the paper. The drilling has been made for twenty inches gas pipeline installation during reaming operations. A trouble was encountered making good work conditions of a system consisting of the <b>drilling</b> <b>machine</b> <b>drill</b> string reamer swivel tube shield of Cardan joint and the gas pipeline 500 m long. In this case, the swivel brokes down and the planned operation was not finished. The assessment of improper drilling conditions, selection of operation system components, and drilling parameters and the insufficient technological supervising have created an excessive risk of failure. A proper application of technical analysis would considerably decrease the hazard of failure which cause large costs, delays and decrease of confidence to the drilling contractor and pipeline installation...|$|R
