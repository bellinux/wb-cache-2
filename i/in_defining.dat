5|$|By 15th century, the Malacca Sultanate, whose hegemony {{reached over}} much of the western Malay archipelago, had become the centre of Islamization in the east. The Malaccan {{tradition}} was transmitted onwards and fostered a vigorous ethos of Malay identity. Since this era, the Islamic faith became closely identified with Malay society and played a significant role <b>in</b> <b>defining</b> the Malay identity. The close identification of the Malays with Islam continued until the 20th century and was finally entrenched in the Article 160 of the Constitution of Malaysia {{as well as in the}} national philosophy of Brunei known as the Malay Islamic Monarchy.|$|E
5|$|Intellectually, Scott {{and figures}} like Thomas Carlyle {{played a part}} in the {{development}} of historiography and the idea of the historical imagination. Romanticism also influenced science, particularly the life sciences, geology, optics and astronomy, giving Scotland a prominence in these areas that continued into the late nineteenth century. Scottish philosophy was dominated by Scottish Common Sense Realism, which shared some characteristics with Romanticism and was a major influence on the development of Transcendentalism. Scott also played a major part <b>in</b> <b>defining</b> Scottish and British politics, helping to create a romanticised view of Scotland and the Highlands that fundamentally changed Scottish national identity.|$|E
5|$|Late in his reign, Christian IV {{also became}} an early proponent of Baroque {{which was to}} {{continue}} for a considerable time with many impressive buildings both in the capital and the provinces.

A productive period of Historicism ultimately merged into the 19th century National Romantic style.|$|E

5|$|Most of Caragiale's prose is {{interconnected}} through {{allusions to}} himself, and, occasionally, the narratives discreetly refer to one another. Although his texts {{are characterized by}} precision <b>in</b> <b>defining</b> the moment and location for the plot, the general lines of the narratives are often subject to a calculated fragmentation, an innovative technique which, Vartic writes, attests the author's familiarity with Antoine Furetière's vision. Vartic also indicates that Balzac's La Comédie humaine, in particular its Thirteen cycle—which {{is known to have}} been one of the books Caragiale treasured most—, influenced the general structure of his stories.|$|E
5|$|Seymour Cray {{began the}} design of the Cray-3 in 1985, as soon as the Cray-2 reached production. Cray {{generally}} set himself the goal of producing new machines with ten times the performance of the previous models. Although the machines did not always meet this goal, this was a useful technique <b>in</b> <b>defining</b> the project and clarifying what sort of process improvements would be needed to meet it. For the Cray-3, he decided to set an even higher performance improvement goal, an increase of 12x over the Cray-2.|$|E

5|$|In Singapore, the Penal Code {{lays out}} {{sanctions}} for non-compliance with the Termination of Pregnancy Act, which limits abortion {{to women who}} have not been pregnant for more than 24 weeks. By not conferring the right to life upon fetuses younger than the stipulated period, the legislation has accorded greater weight to the safety and security of expectant mothers who are threatened by their unborn children. This is in contrast with the approach taken in the Philippines, where the Constitution provides that the state shall equally protect {{the life of the mother}} and the life of the unborn from conception. Similarly, the Charter of Fundamental Rights and Basic Freedoms of the Czech Republic states that human life deserves to be protected before birth. Chances of a universal consensus on this issue are slim due to the difficulty <b>in</b> <b>defining</b> the beginning of life.|$|E
5|$|Keynes was {{a lifelong}} {{member of the}} Liberal Party, which until the 1920s {{had been one of}} the two main {{political}} parties in the United Kingdom, and as late as 1916 had often been the dominant power in government. Keynes had helped campaign for the Liberals at elections from about 1906, yet he always refused to run for office himself, despite being asked to do so on three separate occasions in 1920. From 1926, when Lloyd George became leader of the Liberals, Keynes took a major role <b>in</b> <b>defining</b> the party's economics policy, but by then the Liberals had been displaced into third party status by the Labour Party.|$|E
5|$|Nolan North, {{the voice}} actor who played Drake, {{had a large}} role <b>in</b> <b>defining</b> the character's {{physical}} and vocal reactions. In the Uncharted series, the actors were used for motion capture, and acted as if performing in a movie. Motion capture was done on a soundstage, and the dialog recorded during this process {{was used in the}} game. North was allowed to ad-lib dialog and insert aspects of his own personality into the character. In naming the character, the development team considered many different choices, including Ethan, Samuel, and John. Matthew Drake was seriously contemplated, but received a poor reaction from those it was presented to. Eventually, Naughty Dog settled on the name Nathan for its ability to be shortened to Nate, and the perception that it sounded historical. Drake's character design changed little between Drake's Fortune and Among Thieves.|$|E

5|$|Public {{reaction}} to Reagan was always mixed; the oldest president {{up to that}} time was supported by young voters, and began an alliance that shifted many of them to the Republican party. Reagan did not fare well with minority groups, especially African-Americans. This was largely due to his opposition to affirmative action policies. However, his support of Israel throughout his presidency earned him support from many Jews. He emphasized family values in his campaigns and during his presidency, although he was the first president to have been divorced. The combination of Reagan's speaking style, unabashed patriotism, negotiation skills, as well as his savvy use of the media, played an important role <b>in</b> <b>defining</b> the 1980s and his future legacy.|$|E
5|$|The Kannada {{language}} {{serves as}} the official language {{of the state of}} Karnataka, as the native language of approximately 65% of its population and as one of the classical languages of India. Kannada {{played a crucial role in}} the creation of Karnataka: linguistic demographics played a major role <b>in</b> <b>defining</b> the new state in 1956. Tulu, Konkani and Kodava are other minor native languages that share a long history in the state. Urdu is spoken widely by the Muslim population. Less widely spoken languages include Beary bashe and certain languages such as Sankethi. Some of the regional languages in Karnataka are Tulu, Kodava, Konkani and Beary.|$|E
5|$|The {{courts in}} Malaysia {{have taken a}} similar {{approach}} <b>in</b> <b>defining</b> the meaning of religious practice under Article 11 of the Malaysian Constitution. Furthermore, they have also consulted religious texts to determine what type of acts might constitute religious practices. In Halimatussaadiah v. Public Service Commission, Malaysia (1992), the appellant claimed she had been wrongfully dismissed from her employment due to her refusal to comply with employment conditions that prohibited any attire that covered a female public servant's face while on duty. According to the appellant, this contravened her right to religious practice on grounds that the wearing of the purdah was part of her religious practice as a Muslim. However, the court disagreed and held that the purdah was not considered a religious practice as {{it was not a}} requirement under Islam since there was no express mention of such a requirement in the Quran.|$|E

5|$|The {{discovery}} of extrasolar planets {{led to another}} ambiguity <b>in</b> <b>defining</b> a planet: {{the point at which}} a planet becomes a star. Many known extrasolar planets are many times the mass of Jupiter, approaching that of stellar objects known as brown dwarfs. Brown dwarfs are generally considered stars due to their ability to fuse deuterium, a heavier isotope of hydrogen. Although objects more massive than 75 times that of Jupiter fuse hydrogen, objects of only 13 Jupiter masses can fuse deuterium. Deuterium is quite rare, and most brown dwarfs would have ceased fusing deuterium long before their discovery, making them effectively indistinguishable from supermassive planets.|$|E
5|$|In Sanskrit literature, Sharabha is {{initially}} {{described as an}} animal that roared and scared other animals in the hills and forest areas. Similies compare warriors to Sharabha. In the later epic Mahabharata, this form of Sharabha was exaggerated as a lion-slaying monster with eight legs, eyes on the top; living in the forest and which ate raw flesh. It is also mentioned as residing on Mount Krauncha but not as a monster but as an ordinary beast along with lions and tigers on mount Gandhamadana. The epic also includes Sharabha {{in the list of}} edible animals - the mrigajatis- the animal group of antelope, deer, hare, bear, ruru deer, sambar, gayal, boar, and buffalo - which was offered as part of food at dinner to guests. Sharabha also appears as a name of a monkey-king in the epic Ramayana, also as a proper name of heroes, apes, demons (danavas) and serpent Nāgas and one of the names of god Vishnu as well as Buddha. <b>In</b> <b>defining</b> the ecological theme in Hindu medicine related to jungle and the aroma of meats, Sharabha has also been listed among the deer natives of Kashmir, Nepal, and Sikkim. However, the features explained are of an eight legged animal of the size of a camel with huge horns and conjectured as a large Himalayan goat.|$|E
5|$|The {{chair of}} European Parliament Mediator for International Parental Child Abduction was {{established}} in 1987 by initiative of British politician and MEP Charles Henry Plumb, {{with the goal of}} helping minor children of international couples victim of parental abduction. The Mediator finds negotiated solutions in the higher interest of the minor when said minor is abducted by a parent following separation of the couple, regardless whether married or unmarried. Since its institution, the chair has been held by Mairead McGuinnes (since 2014), Roberta Angelilli (2009-2014), Evelyne Gebhardt (2004-2009), Mary Banotti (1995-2004), and Marie-Claude Vayssade (1987-1994). The Mediator's main task is to assist parents in finding a solution in the minor's best interest through mediation, i.e. a form of controversy resolution alternative to lawsuit. The Mediator is activated by request of a citizen and, after evaluating the request, starts a mediation process aimed at reaching an agreement. Once subscribed by both parties and the Mediator, the agreement is official. The nature of the agreement is that of a private contract between parties. <b>In</b> <b>defining</b> the agreement, the European Parliament offers the parties the juridical support necessary to reach a sound, lawful agreement based on legality and equity. The agreement can be ratified by the competent national courts and can also lay the foundation for consensual separation or divorce.|$|E
