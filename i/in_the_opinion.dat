She had managed to fire forty-one shots from her pair of Dahlgren guns. Virginia had sustained ninety-seven indentations to her armor from the fire of Monitor and other ships. Neither ship had sustained any significant damage. <b>In</b> <b>the</b> <b>opinion</b> of Virginias commander Jones and her other officers, Monitor could have sunk their ship had she hit the vessel at the waterline.|$|E
5|$|Biden had {{remained}} low <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>opinion</b> polls {{when compared to}} other candidates. A Rasmussen survey taken September 19–24 put him in fourth place among his Democratic opponents at 4%, trailing Hillary Clinton, Barack Obama, John Edwards. In the American Research Group, Biden was fourth at 5% behind Hillary Clinton, Barack Obama, and John Edwards, for the month of October 2007. In head-to-head matchups with Republican candidates, Biden trailed Senator John McCain on January 10, 2007 38% to 46%.|$|E

The cabinet is chosen from members of both houses of Parliament. The Prime Minister is both the head of cabinet and the head of government.

5|$|<b>In</b> <b>the</b> <b>opinion</b> of Rasanayagam Mudaliar and Swami Gnanapragasar the Aryacakravarti dynasty was {{connected}} to the Eastern Ganga Dynasty. Rasanayagam believes that a Brahmin from the town of Rameswaram married into the surviving family members of the Kalinga Magha, an invader claiming to be from Kalinga kingdom in India. Magha apparently belonged to the Eastern Ganga Dynasty. The Royal flag of the Jaffna kingdom is similar to the Royal insignia of the Eastern Gangas. Gangas themselves also claimed Brahmin origins. The Setu coins minted by the Aryacakravarti kings also have a similar symbol.|$|E

5|$|The 2008 presidential {{campaign}} of Chris Dodd was launched on January 11, 2007 and ended on January 3, 2008 after a sixth-place {{finish in the}} Iowa caucuses.

Centering his campaign in the strategically important states of Iowa and New Hampshire, he tried to bring forth a platform of change. Dodd's performance <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>opinion</b> polls varied, but in the financial sphere, he had secured some notable and influential endorsements who had sufficiently funded his campaign.|$|E

5|$|The Moravian {{cultural}} influence {{played a}} significant role in the spread of Christianity onto the Polish lands and the subsequent adoption of that religion. <b>In</b> <b>the</b> <b>opinion</b> of Davies, the Christianisation of Poland through the Czech–Polish alliance represented a conscious choice on the part of Polish rulers to ally themselves with the Czech state rather than the German one. In a similar fashion, some of the later political struggles involved the Polish Church refusing to subordinate itself to the German hierarchy and instead being directly subordinate to the Vatican.|$|E
5|$|The {{importance}} of the election was magnified due to Finland's capacity to influence the European Union's decision in regard to affecting a bailout for Portugal via the European Financial Stability Facility, as part of financial support systems for debt-laden European countries, and {{the fall of the}} Portuguese government. Small differences <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>opinion</b> polls for the traditional three big parties (the National Coalition Party, the Centre Party and the Social Democratic Party) and the surprising rise in support for the True Finns also electrified the atmosphere ahead of the election.|$|E

The accusations become increasingly sinister, and at points the speaker directly addresses the Dissenters ("You have butchered one King! deposed another King! and made a Mock King of a third!"). A brief history is given of how past monarchs—from James I to William III—have treated the Dissenters; <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>opinion</b> of the speaker, it is too leniently.|$|E

5|$|With Romanos I {{approaching}} {{the end of}} his life, the matter of his succession became urgent. In 943, Romanos drafted a will which would leave Constantine VII as the senior emperor following his death. This greatly upset his two sons, who feared that their brother-in-law would have them deposed and force them to take monastic vows. Motivated, <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>opinion</b> of Steven Runciman, partially by self-preservation and partially from genuine ambition, they started planning to seize power through a coup d'état, with Stephen apparently the ringleader and Constantine a rather reluctant partner.|$|E
5|$|Although the {{majority}} of those advocating a name change are Democrats, {{there is no indication that}} the issue is of any real significance in electoral decisions given that Native Americans are such a small percentage of the electorate and are not likely to influence the outcome of any election. There are only eight states where Natives make up greater than 2 percent of the population: Alaska, Arizona, Montana, New Mexico, North Dakota, Oklahoma, South Dakota and Wyoming. However, polls show a definite political difference <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>opinion</b> of the general public, with only 58% of Democrats opposing a name change versus 89% of Republicans. Statements by political figures have generally been expressions of personal opinion rather than recommendations for government action. There have also been non-binding resolutions advocating name change proposed in New Jersey and passed in Minneapolis, New York State and California.|$|E

The hajjis in Joehana's stories are generally greedy and lustful, without any interest in the good of humanity. In Tjarios Agan Permas, for instance, Hajji Serbanna displays his hypocrisy by damning usury as haraam (sinful) while charging high interest rates for a loan, and refuses to complete the mandatory prayers because he is waiting on a guest bearing large gifts. The hajji is portrayed as wearing so much make-up that, <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>opinion</b> of Kartini et al., it is as if he is deliberately dressing as a clown.|$|E
5|$|Edward {{automatically}} became Duke of Cornwall and Duke of Rothesay on 6 May 1910 {{when his}} father ascended the throne as George V {{on the death of}} Edward VII. He was created Prince of Wales and Earl of Chester a month later on 23 June 1910, his 16th birthday. Preparations for his future as king began in earnest. He was withdrawn from his naval course before his formal graduation, served as midshipman for three months aboard the battleship Hindustan, then immediately entered Magdalen College, Oxford, for which, <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>opinion</b> of his biographers, he was underprepared intellectually. A keen horseman, he learned how to play polo with the university club. He left Oxford after eight terms, without any academic qualifications.|$|E
5|$|Hobbs played {{just five}} {{first-class}} matches in 1921, when Australia toured England. In his opening first-class game, he played against the touring team, but tore the same thigh muscle injured in Australia. He missed the opening two Tests, but once recovered, scored a century for Surrey; as England trailed 2–0 in the five-Test series, the selectors chose {{him for the}} third Test. In the days approaching the match, played in Leeds, he suffered from increasing stomach pain but reluctantly played. On {{the first day of}} the match, he had to leave the field, and after a day of rest the pain worsened. He consulted Sir Berkley Moynihan, a prominent surgeon based in Leeds, who diagnosed acute appendicitis and operated the same day. <b>In</b> <b>the</b> <b>opinion</b> of the surgeon, Hobbs would not have lived another five hours without surgery. He missed the rest of the season.|$|E
