30|$|The high {{accuracy}} of log positioning and {{the stability of}} saw blades in breakdown machinery in modern sawmills have reduced the need to add margins for <b>sawing</b> variations. Oversize <b>green</b> <b>sawing</b> dimensions are still needed, but mainly to allow for drying shrinkage. This has put a new focus on better adapting <b>green</b> <b>sawing</b> dimensions to the shrinkage behavior of wood. In this study, a method for optimization of <b>green</b> <b>sawing</b> dimensions using stochastic simulation is presented. Normal distributions were generated for planed dry dimensions, kerf width, and target moisture content. The minimum share of boards exceeding the specified dry dimensions was decided, and deformations in boards from all positions in the cross section {{in a number of}} logs were simulated. The simulated shrinkage allowance from stochastic simulations was compared to experimental results from an industry test and to finite element results based on material data for Norway spruce. The results showed that the green width of the sawn boards should increase when the number of boards in the center yield increases. The green thickness of boards should be thinner for center boards and outer boards than for inner boards.|$|R

50|$|The Liberal Party {{has held}} the riding since its {{creation}} in 1988. The closest election was a 7% Liberal win in 2006. The riding has voted Liberal even during Progressive Conservative and Conservative governments. The New Democratic Party received its greatest level of support in the 2011 election at 18%. The <b>Greens</b> <b>saw</b> their highest vote here in 2008 with 7%.|$|R
40|$|Phytophthora pinifolia {{causes the}} needle and shoot disease of Pinus radiata in Chile known as Daño Foliar del Pino (DFP). Although P. pinifolia is {{primarily}} a needle pathogen, there are concerns {{that it might be}} spread to new environments via the export of contaminated timber. In order to determine whether P. pinifolia can enter or persist in <b>green</b> <b>sawn</b> lumber, its presence in lumber produced from trees exposed to the pathogen for at least four years was examined. Green lumber produced from the infected trees, and green wood samples artificially exposed to P. pinifolia inoculum, were analyzed by making extensive isolations on Phytophthora selective media. In addition, PCR was conducted using species-specific primers developed for P. pinifolia. Results of the study showed that the <b>green</b> <b>sawn</b> lumber taken from trees infected by P. pinifolia, or green lumber exposed in infected pine plantations, displayed no evidence of the pathogen surviving in this material...|$|R

A {{frustrating}} start to life at Forest <b>Green</b> <b>saw</b> him suffer an {{anterior cruciate ligament}} injury in pre-season training.

Crawshays accepted Rees, the first notable team in his career. Rees joined the British Army and became {{a soldier in the}} Welsh Guards, and while serving in the Guards he was selected for the Army XV.|$|R

Since the MFA {{would also}} affect the lumber warp, a sawing pattern {{avoiding}} {{the area around}} the pith or enlarging the rough <b>sawn</b> <b>size</b> when a large warp was expected could be effective in improving the lumber quality. To improve the lumber quality, not only one but also multiple wood properties must be applied to the sawing pattern.|$|R

50|$|After redshirting {{his initial}} year at Florida State, Green {{appeared}} mostly {{on special teams}} in his freshman season in 1995, and recorded 28 tackles (including 17 unassisted) on the season. He also caused a fumble and recovered it in the Seminoles' 72-13 win over Wake Forest. <b>Green</b> <b>saw</b> his role on the team increased in his sophomore year, as he registered 44 tackles (26 solo) as back-up linebackers. He also had six tackles-for-loss and three quarterback sacks (two of them against Maryland). In his first career start against Georgia Tech, Green {{stepped in front of}} a screen pass and ran the interception back for 56 yards and a touchdown.|$|R
50|$|In {{contrast}} to the misfortune of the Liberal Party, the election saw the unexpected revival of the Greens. The reduction {{of the size of}} the Assembly in 1998, from 35 to 25, had increased the quota necessary to win a seat to 16.7%. Both major parties portrayed this as a way to cut the costs of government, but the <b>Greens</b> <b>saw</b> it as an attempt to eradicate them. At the 1998 election, all of their MPs except one, Peg Putt, were defeated. However, they managed to markedly increase their vote in the 2002 poll, and picked up three new MPs, Kim Booth, Nick McKim and Tim Morris.|$|R

5000|$|In Boston, Green {{was thought}} of being a future {{replacement}} for aging All-Star Paul Pierce as the small forward alongside All-Star Rajon Rondo. After averaging 15.2 points, 5.6 rebounds and 1.8 assists in Oklahoma City, Green averaged 9.8 points, 3.3 rebounds, and [...]7 assists in Boston. <b>Green</b> <b>saw</b> a big drop in minutes per game as well, dropping from 37.0 minutes to 23.4 minutes. The Celtics {{made it to the}} playoffs as the number three seed in the Eastern Conference. They swept the New York Knicks in the first round. In the next round, however, they were eliminated by the Miami Heat. Green became a restricted free agent {{at the end of the}} season.|$|R

The layout {{and all of the}} components typically found in a small mill of the 1950s remain including: the characteristic open-sided shed, early electrical insulators tracing the route of the original cabling, breakdown (Canadian) saw, number one and two saw benches, docking saw, original hand operated winch, rails and trolleys. The milling operation continues to follow the traditional packing case sequence of initial cut at the breakdown (Canadian) <b>saw,</b> <b>sizing</b> at the number one and two benches and cut to lengths at the docker.|$|R

40|$|From a {{stand of}} 25 -year-old Pinus radiata D. Don, 183 4. 8 -m-long logs were {{individually}} measured and sawn to 100 x 50 -mm framing timber. After high-temperature drying, warp measurements {{were related to the}} individual log characteristics. Twist was the major form of degrade; beforeplaning 36 % of the lengths had excessive twist and rejection from Framing 1 grade was 28 %. Twist was most strongly related to log diameter, with corewood portion and spiral grain being the contributory factors. Twist also increased with log height class. Gauging halved the incidence of twist rejection. The relationship between corewood proportion and twist and its effect on rejection could be incorporated into current stand growth models, thereby extending the profitability modelling capability of models from <b>green</b> <b>sawn</b> timber through to the final dry product...|$|R
50|$|Mason {{was taking}} over a declining program in Hanover that had seen {{some success in}} {{previous}} years but the recent returns hadn't been good. His first two seasons with the Big <b>Green</b> <b>saw</b> modest improvements to 5- and 7-win seasons but a 2-22-1 mark in his third year was the worst the program had ever recorded. A significant jump to 10 wins the next year began to erode immediately thereafter and ended with only four victories in 1989-90, leading to Mason's dismissal from the team. In his six-year tenure the Big Green never had a winning season and missed the ECAC tournament every time. The only saving grace for Mason is that the year after he left his replacement Ben Smith beat Mason's record for the worst season in Dartmouth history with a 1-24-3 finish.|$|R
