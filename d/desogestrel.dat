5|$|Progestin-only pills, {{injections}} and intrauterine {{devices are}} {{not associated with}} an increased risk of blood clots and may be used by women with previous blood clots in their veins. In those with a history of arterial blood clots, non-hormonal birth control or a progestin-only method other than the injectable version should be used. Progestin-only pills may improve menstrual symptoms and can be used by breastfeeding women as they do not affect milk production. Irregular bleeding may occur with progestin-only methods, with some users reporting no periods. The progestins drospirenone and <b>desogestrel</b> minimize the androgenic side effects but increase the risks of blood clots and are thus not first line. The perfect use first-year failure rate of the injectable progestin, Depo-Provera, is 0.2%; the typical use first failure rate is 6%.|$|E
5|$|In women, acne can be {{improved}} {{with the use of}} any combined birth control pill. These decrease the production of androgen hormones by the ovaries, resulting in lower skin production of sebum, and consequently reduce acne severity. Combinations containing third- or fourth-generation progestins such as <b>desogestrel,</b> drospirenone, or norgestimate are preferred for women with acne due to their stronger antiandrogenic effects. A 2014 review found that oral antibiotics appear to be somewhat more effective than birth control pills at decreasing the number of inflammatory acne lesions at three months. However, the two therapies are approximately equal in efficacy at six months for decreasing the number of inflammatory, non-inflammatory, and total acne lesions. The authors of the analysis suggested that birth control pills may be a preferred first-line acne treatment, over oral antibiotics, in certain women due to similar efficacy at six months and a lack of associated antibiotic resistance.|$|E

It is more specifically a derivative of norethisterone (17α-ethynyl-19-nortestosterone) {{and is a member}} of the gonane (18-methylestrane) subgroup of the 19-nortestosterone family of progestins. <b>Desogestrel</b> is the C3 deketo and C11 methylene analogue of levonorgestrel.|$|E

50|$|Gestodene is {{a potent}} progestogen, and also {{possesses}} weak androgenic, antimineralocorticoid, and glucocorticoid activity. It has relatively high affinity for the androgen receptor (AR), with twice that of levonorgestrel (which {{is known to be}} one of the more androgenic 19-nortestosterone derivatives). However, the ratio of progestogenic to androgenic effects of gestodene is distinctly higher than that of levonorgestrel, and the increase in sex hormone-binding globulin (SHBG) levels (a marker of androgenicity) produced by oral contraceptives containing gestodene is slightly less than that produced by oral contraceptives containing <b>desogestrel</b> (which is known {{to be one of the}} more weakly androgenic 19-nortestosterone derivatives). In addition, no difference in acne incidence has been observed with oral contraceptives containing gestodene and oral contraceptives containing <b>desogestrel.</b> Moreover, gestodene has been found to strongly inhibit 5α-reductase in vitro (14.5% and 45.9% inhibition at 0.1 μM and 1 μM, respectively), and this action was substantially greater than that of <b>desogestrel</b> or levonorgestrel. Taken together, like <b>desogestrel,</b> gestodene appears to have a low potential for androgenic effects. In addition to the AR, gestodene has very high affinity for the mineralocorticoid receptor (MR), but only a relatively weak antimineralocorticoid effect that is comparable to that of progesterone. Gestodene binds to SHBG with relatively high affinity, and is 75% bound to the protein in circulation.|$|E
50|$|The 19-nortestosterone progestins, {{gestodene}} and, to {{a lesser}} extent, <b>desogestrel,</b> {{have been found to}} inhibit cytochrome P450 enzymes and to progressively inhibit the metabolism and increase the concentrations of EE.|$|E
50|$|The {{contraceptive}} {{vaginal ring}} is contraindicated for {{a risk of}} blood clots. This is because it contains the hormone etonogestrel, the active metabolite of the prodrug <b>desogestrel.</b> It is a third-generation contraceptive.|$|E
5000|$|<b>Desogestrel,</b> {{sold under}} the brand names Azalia, Cerazette, Marvelon, Mircette, Mercilon, and Novynette among others, is a {{progestin}} {{that is used}} in hormonal contraceptives. Most combined oral contraceptive pills (COCPs, or simply OCs) {{on the market today}} contain both an estrogen (usually ethinylestradiol) plus a progestin (a synthetic progesterone-like agent) such as <b>desogestrel.</b> Desogestrel-containing birth control pills are sometimes referred to as [...] "third generation" [...] oral contraceptives. In contrast, birth control pills that are considered [...] "second generation" [...] (Tri-Levlen, for example) contain an estrogen and a progestin, but the progestin is different, such as levonorgestrel.|$|E
50|$|Norsteroid {{examples}} include: 19-norpregnane (from pregnane), <b>desogestrel,</b> ethylestrenol, etynodiol diacetate, ethinylestradiol, gestrinone, levonorgestrel, norethisterone (norethindrone), norgestrel, norpregnatriene (from pregnatriene), quinestrol, 19-norprogesterone (from a progesterone), Nomegestrol acetate, 19-nortestosterone (from a testosterone), and norethisterone acetate.|$|E
50|$|In February 2007, the {{consumer}} advocacy group Public Citizen released a petition requesting that the FDA ban oral contraceptives containing <b>desogestrel,</b> citing studies going {{as far back}} as 1995 that suggest the risk of dangerous blood clots is doubled for women on such pills in comparison to other oral contraceptives. In 2009, Public Citizen released a list of recommendations that included numerous alternative, second-generation birth control pills that women could take in place of oral contraceptives containing <b>desogestrel.</b> Most of those second-generation medications have been on the market longer and {{have been shown to be}} as effective in preventing unwanted pregnancy, but with a lower risk of blood clots.|$|E
5000|$|A {{study in}} the BMJ, with over 1.6 million women, found that users of vaginal rings with {{ethinylestradiol}} and etonogestrel have a 6.5 times increased risk of venous thrombosis compared to non-users. [...] Epidemiological {{studies have shown that}} oral contraceptives that contain <b>desogestrel</b> can increase the risk of blood clots (venous thrombosis) by 1.5 to 2.4 times the risk of second-generation oral contraceptives. [...] Second-generation oral contraceptives do not contain <b>desogestrel.</b> Hormones are released continuously from NuvaRing, thus peak and total estrogen and progestin doses are significantly lower than with combined oral contraceptives, but what effect this has on the risk of blood clots has not been established.|$|E
50|$|Drugs {{containing}} <b>desogestrel</b> as {{the only}} active ingredient (as opposed to being {{used in conjunction with}} estrogen, like in combined oral contraceptives) do not show an increased thrombosis risk and are therefore safer than second-generation birth-control pills in regards to thrombosis.|$|E
50|$|Some {{examples}} of progestins {{that are used}} in hormonal contraceptives are norethisterone (many brand names, most notably Ortho-Novum and Ovcon), norgestimate (Ortho Tricyclen, Ortho-Cyclen), levonorgestrel (Alesse, Trivora-28, Plan B, Mirena), medroxyprogesterone acetate (Provera, Depo-Provera), cyproterone acetate (Diane-35), <b>desogestrel,</b> etonogestrel (Nexplanon), and drospirenone (Yasmin, Yasminelle, YAZ).|$|E
50|$|<b>Desogestrel</b> is marketed under {{a variety}} of brand names {{throughout}} the world including Alenvona, Apri, Azalia, Azurette, Caziant, Cerazette, Cerelle, Cesia, Cyclessa, Denise, Desogen, Desirett, Diamilla, Emoquette, Feanolla, Gedarel, Gracial, Kariva, Laurina, Linessa, Marvelon, Mercilon, Mircette, Mirvala, Novynette, Ortho-Cept, Reclipsen, Regulon, Solia, Velivet, and Viorele among others.|$|E
50|$|Third-generation oral {{contraceptives}} like those containing <b>desogestrel</b> {{are suitable for}} use in patients with diabetes or lipid disorders because they have minimal impact on blood glucose levels and the lipid profile. Their synthetic estrogen dosage is lower than second-generation {{oral contraceptives}}, reducing the likelihood of weight gain, breast tenderness and migraine.|$|E
50|$|Alternatively, estranes such as {{noretynodrel}} and norethisterone {{are classified}} as first-generation while gonanes such as norgestrel and levonorgestrel {{are classified as}} second-generation, with less androgenic gonanes such as <b>desogestrel,</b> norgestimate, and gestodene classified as third-generation and newer progestins like drospirenone classified as fourth-generation. Yet another classification system considers there to be only first- and second-generation progestins.|$|E
50|$|Nandrolone, {{together}} with ethisterone (17α-ethynyltestosterone), {{is also the}} parent compound of {{a large group of}} progestins, the norethisterone (17α-ethynyl-19-nortestosterone) derivatives. This family is subdivided into two groups: the estranes and the gonanes. The estranes include norethisterone (norethindrone), norethisterone acetate, norethisterone enanthate, lynestrenol, etynodiol diacetate, and noretynodrel, while the gonanes include norgestrel, levonorgestrel, <b>desogestrel,</b> etonogestrel, gestodene, norgestimate, dienogest (actually a 17α-cyanomethyl-19-nortestosterone derivative), and norelgestromin.|$|E
50|$|A 2001 {{comparative}} study of the IMS LifeLink Health Plan Claims Database interpreted that in a large cohort of women using oral contraceptives, there was found a small, statistically {{significant increase in the}} risk of gallbladder disease associated with <b>desogestrel,</b> drospirenone and norethisterone compared with levonorgestrel. No statistically significant increase in risk was associated with the other formulations of oral contraceptive (etynodiol diacetate, norgestrel and norgestimate).|$|E
50|$|Etonogestrel, {{also known}} as 11-methylene-17α-ethynyl-18-methyl-19-nortestosterone or as 11-methylene-17α-ethynyl-18-methylestr-4-en-17β-ol-3-one, is a {{synthetic}} estrane steroid and a derivative of testosterone. It is more specifically a derivative of norethisterone (17α-ethynyl-19-nortestosterone) {{and is a member}} of the gonane (18-methylestrane) subgroup of the 19-nortestosterone family of progestins. Etonogestrel is the C3 ketone derivative of <b>desogestrel</b> and the C11 methylene derivative of levonorgestrel and is {{also known as}} 3-ketodesogestrel and as 11-methylenelevonorgestrel.|$|E
50|$|Among the {{testosterone}} derivatives, and in {{no particular}} order, levonorgestrel, norgestrel, norgestrienone, ethisterone, gestrinone, danazol, tibolone, normethandrone, and norvinisterone have the greatest androgenic activity, while norethisterone and its prodrugs (norethisterone acetate, norethisterone enanthate, lynestrenol, etynodiol diacetate, and quingestanol acetate) have moderate activity. Testosterone derivatives with low (but potentially still significant) androgenic activity include <b>desogestrel,</b> etonogestrel, gestodene, and norgestimate, while norelgestromin, noretynodrel, norgesterone, allylestrenol, and dimethisterone appear to have negligible activity. Dienogest and oxendolone are unique among the testosterone derivatives {{in that they are}} potent antiandrogens.|$|E
50|$|Etonogestrel is {{the active}} {{metabolite}} of the inactive prodrug <b>desogestrel,</b> {{one of two}} third-generation progestins found in some epidemiological studies of combined oral contraceptive pills {{to be associated with}} a higher risk of venous thrombosis than combined oral contraceptive pills containing certain second-generation progestins. Because hormones are released continuously from NuvaRing, peak and total estrogen and progestin doses are significantly lower than with combined oral contraceptives, although it is not known whether this lowers the risk of blood clots. It is effective within the first 8 hours of insertion.|$|E
50|$|As of February 2017, the {{government}} subsidised three formulations {{of the combined}} oral contraceptive pill (ethinyloestradiol with norethisterone, ethinyloestradiol with <b>desogestrel,</b> and ethinyloestradiol with levonorgestrel), and two formulations of the progestogen-only pill (levonorgestrel and norethisterone). A non-subsidised six-month supply could cost up to $100, depending on its type. Appointment costs at Family planning clinics may also be subsidised: appointments are free for women under 22 years of age. For women 22 and older, appointments are five dollars for a community services card holder and $27 for those without a community services card.|$|E
50|$|The overall {{absolute}} risk of venous thrombosis per 100,000 woman years in current use of combined oral contraceptives is approximately 60, compared to 30 in non-users. The risk of thromboembolism varies with {{different types of}} birth control pills; Compared with combined oral contraceptives containing levonorgestrel (LNG), and with the same dose of estrogen and duration of use, the rate ratio of deep venous thrombosis for combined oral contraceptives with norethisterone is 0.98, with norgestimate 1.19, with <b>desogestrel</b> (DSG) 1.82, with gestodene 1.86, with drospirenone (DRSP) 1.64, and with cyproterone acetate 1.88. Venous thromboembolism occurs in 100-200 per 100,000 pregnant women every year.|$|E
