60|$|If, however, {{these men}} laid {{architecture}} little under contribution {{to their own}} art, they made their own art a glorious gift to architecture, and the walls of Venice, which before, I believe, had received color only in arabesque patterns, were lighted with human life by Giorgione, Titian, Tintoret, and Veronese. Of the works of Tintoret and Titian, nothing now, I believe, remains; two figures of Giorgione's are still traceable on the Fondaco de' Tedeschi, one of which, singularly uninjured, is seen from far {{above and below the}} Rialto, flaming like the reflection of a sunset. Two figures of Veronese were also traceable till lately, the head and arms of one still remain, and some glorious olive-branches which were beside the other; the figure having been entirely effaced by an inscription in large black letters on a whitewash tablet which we owe to the somewhat inopportunely expressed enthusiasm of the inhabitants of the district in favor of their new pastor.[11] Judging, however, from the rate at which destruction is at present advancing, and seeing that, in about seven or eight years more, Venice will have utterly lost every <b>external</b> <b>claim</b> to interest, except that which attaches to the group of buildings immediately around St. Mark's place, and to the larger churches, it may be conjectured that the greater part of her present degradation has taken place, at any rate, within the last forty years. Let the reader with such scraps of evidence as may still be gleaned from under the stucco and paint of the Italian committees of taste, and from among the drawing-room innovations of English and German residents restore Venice in his imagination to some resemblance of what she must have been before her fall. Let him, looking from Lido or Fusina, replace in the forest of towers those of the hundred and sixty-six churches which the French threw down; let him sheet her walls with purple and scarlet, overlay her minarets with gold,[12] cleanse from their pollution those choked canals which are now the drains of hovels, where they were once vestibules of palaces, and fill them with gilded barges and bannered ships; finally, let him withdraw from this scene, already so brilliant, such sadness and stain as had been set upon it by the declining energies of more than half a century, and he will see Venice as it was seen by Canaletto; whose miserable, virtueless, heartless mechanism, accepted as the representation of such various glory, is, both in its existence and acceptance, among the most striking signs of the lost sensation and deadened intellect of the nation at that time; a numbness and darkness more without hope than that of the grave itself, holding and wearing yet the sceptre and the crown like the corpses of the Etruscan kings, ready to sink into ashes at the first unbarring of the door of the sepulchre.|$|E
40|$|Abstract: Delayed {{completion}} of a construction project is often caused by a complex interaction {{of a combination of}} events some of which are the contractor’s risks while others are the project owner’s. The apportionment of the liability to give effect to the risk allocation has therefore been a matter of great controversy. Many delay analysis methodologies have been developed over the years for performing this task. This paper reports on an empirical study into the current practice in the use of these methodologies in the United Kingdom, as part of a wider study aimed at developing a framework for improving delay claims analysis. The part of the study reported here was based on a questionnaire survey of key informants. The issues investigated include the categories of staff within contracting organizations who contribute to delay claims analyses, the awareness, use and reliability of existing delay analysis methods and the obstacles to their use in practice.

40|$|Why are {{downturns}} following {{episodes of}} high asset values so detrimental to growth? A traditional explanation is “debt overhang ” – the debt built {{up during the}} boom serves to restrict borrowing and investment during the bust. But why is the debt not renegotiated? In this paper, we attempt a different explanation of the causes and consequences of debt overhang. In doing so, we also differentiate between the control rights over assets, which are sufficient to enforce <b>external</b> <b>claims</b> only in a boom, and control rights over cash flows that enable the enforcement of <b>external</b> <b>claims</b> in a downturn. It is {{the change in the}} relevant control rights that makes it so hard to renegotiate debt efficiently, and causes the debt build up to have long-drawn adverse effects in the downturn...|$|R

40|$|In {{terms of}} {{international}} law, IS naturally poses {{questions on the}} law of insurgency and international humanitarian law (ius in bello). However, IS claims to operate inside a distinct and parallel law, i. e. Islamic (international) law, the primary sources of which are the Qur’an and Sunnah. The support IS enjoys from their recruits and from {{a significant part of the}} population over which it is currently exercising power stems directly from this claim. A focus on public international law alone would thus provide only an <b>external</b> <b>claim</b> to their illegitimacy, one which they and their many supporters would disregard as meaningless, since it could never be above divine commands. In light of this and in light of the fact that in most Muslim majority states, secularism has never obtained the respect it enjoys in the West, it is thus important to ask the questions of legitimacy of IS and their actions from within the norms of Islamic international law. This study therefore essentially aims to provide answers to questions already raised by many scholars and international organisations: What are the justifications for waging war on which the self-declared Islamic State relies? Are these justifications valid under Islamic international law? Who can declare jihād and under what conditions? Could IS still rightfully claim to be a caliphate under Shari’a, regardless of a lack of international recognition? The answers to these questions are crucial because IS recruitment and rallying narrative relies on depicting its struggle as a just and noble jihād...|$|E

40|$|How can NGOs {{contribute}} to strengthening the democratic legitimacy of international intergovernmental institutions? The thesis pursues {{two lines of}} enquiry in order to {{contribute to}} this discussion {{in the context of}} global environmental politics: it looks at the <b>external</b> <b>claims</b> and internal practices of NGOs. With regards to <b>external</b> <b>claims</b> the thesis investigates the democratic demands formulated by the NGO communities interacting with the UNFCCC and the CBD respectively. Demands for equitable representation at the intergovernmental level and for participation by civil society stakeholders are especially prominent among the NGOs engaged with the climate convention. The thesis finds a convergence around very similar democratic demands across the NGO community, most of which draw upon recurrent governance norms and existing instances of good practice within environmental institutions. The thesis then turns to the internal practices of large international environmental NGOs to test the assumption that these organisations have the potential to act as “links” or as “transmission belts” between local communities and global policymaking processes. It proposes the adoption of a representation perspective for analysing the contribution of civil society organisations, and provides case studies of three large international environmental NGOs (WWF, Greenpeace and Friends of the Earth) and of the two issue-­specific civil society networks that organise NGO activities around the two UN conventions referred to above (the Climate Action Network and the CBD Alliance). The thesis shows that the potential for large NGOs to ‘represent’ local communities is shaped by organisational structures, decision-­making processes, the strategy for bringing about change, funding sources, alliances and partnerships, and values. The findings underline the need to adopt a more differentiated understanding of the democratic contribution by civil society organisations to international intergovernmental institutions...|$|R

The hospitals had similar patient demographics, and more than 80 % of them had statistically-similar Medicare risk-adjusted readmission and complication rates. Methods: Hospital and physician personnel costs were calculated using time-driven activity-based costing. Consumable supply costs, such as the prosthetic implant, were calculated using purchase prices, and postacute care costs were measured using either internal costs or <b>external</b> <b>claims</b> as reported by each hospital. Results: Despite having similar patient demographics and readmission and complication rates, {{the average cost of}} care for total knee arthroplasty across the hospitals varied by a factor of about 2 to 1.

Despite the fact that the corporate {{social responsibility}} as an institutionalized organizational management process has existed for more than 50 years, it has not yet received the deserved scientific attention, and its various aspects are still subject to debates.

The authors conducted an empirical exploratory study of the Russian small and medium-sized business organizations and found out that their representatives do not have a clear understanding of the directions and methods of implementing the social responsibility model. For instance, the standards developed for large organizations to implement the ideas of corporate social responsibility are too global and too costly for small and medium-sized businesses, however the latter in Russia still do not have their own technologies and algorithms for implementing an appropriate model of social responsibility (except for some types of charity and requirements to retrain workers, which are considered rather <b>external</b> <b>claims)</b> ...|$|R

40|$|In a two-country {{portfolio}} {{model with}} leverage constraints, I focus on private assets {{in order to}} understand how their behaviour can justify an expected excess return as well as the flight-to-safety observed in the data. The specific goal is to study how much these phenomena are {{explained by the fact that}} investors cannot always borrow the same amount of resources pledging domestic assets as pledging foreign collateral. Modeling the leverage constraints accordingly, I propose a methodology to deal with this heterogeneous pledgeability and solve for country portfolios. The central feature of this approach is that any idiosyncratic shocks generate an expected excess returns which compensate the current effects of the shock on the relative riskiness of local versus foreign collateral. The resulting portfolio solution shows that, in equilibrium, investors care for this risk and renounce to a part of the expected excess return - favouring current borrowing. The main consequences are: the home equity bias is smaller than in a model where assets are homogeneously pledgeable; the ex post dynamics of the relative premium paid on collateralized assets contribute to the cross-border transmission of shocks. Given these dynamics, idiosyncratic shocks to the pledgeability of local assets affect the value of <b>external</b> <b>claims</b> and liabilities of the country hit by the shock in such a way that its net foreign assets match those observed in the data during times of flight-to-safety. portfolio choice, riskiness of pledged collateral, return di¤erentials, macroeconomic interdependence...|$|R

40|$|The {{causes and}} {{implications}} of the developing country debt crisis - {{as well as its}} solution - all have an important fiscal dimension. The crisis was triggered by the widespread perception that the public sectors in many heavily indebted countries were effectively insolvent in the international environment of the early 1980 s. The actual fiscal response to the resulting liquidity crisis involved increased reliance on domestic financing, the inflation tax, and the curtailment of public investment. This created adverse adjustment incentives for policymakers and resulted in credit rationing, capital flight, assumption of private <b>external</b> <b>claims</b> by the public sector, and poor domestic investment performance. Solutions involve restoring fiscal health through a combination of debt relief and efficient fiscal adjustment, aimed at mitigating the burden associated with public sector debt service and minimizing the liquidity problems facing the indebted public sector. The debt and debt-service reduction (DDSR) programs implemented so far under the Brady Plan have provided only partial solutions, closing without eliminating the gap between the face value of the external debt and the present value of prospective public sector debt service. They have done so partly by reducing the former and partly by increasing the latter. Their contribution toward easing the immediate liquidity problems of the debtors has not been encouraging. The amount of debt relief embodied in Brady Plan programs enacted so far has not in itself been sufficient to restore fiscal solvency. Better-quality fiscal adjustment could greatly help improve the situation. The most important potential contribution of such programs, then, may have been the reduction - through the policy conditionality associated with resources provided by the international financial institutions - of the secondary burden associated with the internal transfer of resources to the public sector.
