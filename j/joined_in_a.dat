5|$|Following {{the death}} of Elizabeth I in 1603, the throne of England was {{inherited}} by the Scottish House of Stuart, resulting in the Union of the Crowns: the Kingdom of England and Kingdom of Scotland were united in a personal union under James VI and I. As a consequence, the Royal Arms of England and Scotland were combined in the king's new personal arms. Nevertheless, although referencing the personal union with Scotland and Ireland, the Royal Arms of England remained distinct from the Royal Arms of Scotland, until the two realms were <b>joined</b> <b>in</b> <b>a</b> political union in 1707, leading to a unified Royal coat of arms of the United Kingdom.|$|E

Raids took Tokyo by surprise on 10 July, followed by more devastation at the juncture of Honshū and Hokkaidō, the second-largest Japanese island, on 13–14 July.

In 2006, Economic Development Lethbridge partnered with SouthGrow Regional Initiative and Alberta SouthWest Regional Alliance to create the Southern Alberta Alternative Energy Partnership. This partnership promotes business related to alternative energy, including wind power, solar power and biofuel, in the region.|$|E
5|$|Atoms lack a {{well-defined}} outer boundary, so their dimensions are usually {{described in terms}} of an atomic radius. This {{is a measure of the}} distance out to which the electron cloud extends from the nucleus. However, this assumes the atom to exhibit a spherical shape, which is only obeyed for atoms in vacuum or free space. Atomic radii may be derived from the distances between two nuclei when the two atoms are <b>joined</b> <b>in</b> <b>a</b> chemical bond. The radius varies with the location of an atom on the atomic chart, the type of chemical bond, the number of neighboring atoms (coordination number) and a quantum mechanical property known as spin. On the periodic table of the elements, atom size tends to increase when moving down columns, but decrease when moving across rows (left to right). Consequently, the smallest atom is helium with a radius of 32pm, while one of the largest is caesium at 225pm.|$|E
5|$|For a {{year and}} a half, Polish patriots waited while {{planning}} an insurrection. On March 24, 1794 in Kraków, Tadeusz Kościuszko declared {{what has come to be}} known as the Kościuszko Uprising. On May 7, he issued the Proclamation of Połaniec (Uniwersał Połaniecki), granting freedom to the peasants and ownership of land to all who fought in the insurrection. Revolutionary tribunals administered summary justice to those deemed traitors to the Commonwealth. After initial victories at the Battle of Racławice (April 4), the capture of Warsaw (April 18) and the Wilno (April 22)the Uprising was crushed when the forces of Russia, Austria and Prussia <b>joined</b> <b>in</b> <b>a</b> military intervention. Historians consider the Uprising's defeat to have been a foregone conclusion in face of the superiority in numbers and resources of the three invading powers. The defeat of Kościuszko's forces led in 1795 to the third and final partition of the Commonwealth.|$|E

5|$|Since the {{discovery}} of rudimentary and nonfunctional clavicles in ceratopsians, {{it was assumed that}} these shoulder bones were reduced in all dinosaurs that did not have true furculae. Robert Bakker (1987) suggested that this would have allowed the shoulder blades to swing with the forelimbs in quadrupedal dinosaurs, increasing their functional forelimb length. This would have reduced the discrepancy of length between fore- and hindlimbs in a quadrupedal Massospondylus. However, a recent discovery shows that Massospondylus possessed well-developed clavicles that were <b>joined</b> <b>in</b> <b>a</b> furcula-like arrangement, acting like a clasp between the right and left shoulder blades and prohibiting any rotation of these bones. This discovery indicates that the clavicle reduction is limited to the evolutionary line leading to the ceratopsians. It also indicates that the furcula of birds is derived from clavicles.|$|E
5|$|Truman's unit <b>joined</b> <b>in</b> <b>a</b> massive {{prearranged}} assault barrage on September 26, 1918, at {{the opening}} of the Meuse-Argonne Offensive. They advanced with difficulty over pitted terrain to follow the infantry, and they set up an observation post west of Cheppy. On September 27, Truman saw through his binoculars an enemy artillery battery setting up across a river in a position allowing them to fire upon the neighboring 28th Division. Truman's orders limited him to targets facing the 35th Division, but he ignored this and patiently waited until the Germans had walked their horses well away from their guns, ensuring they could not relocate out of range of Truman's battery, and then he ordered his men to open fire. The enemy battery was destroyed. His actions were credited with saving the lives of 28th Division soldiers who otherwise would have come under fire from the Germans. Truman was given a dressing down by his regimental commander, Colonel Karl D. Klemm, but he was not court-martialed or otherwise punished.|$|E
5|$|The first {{trading post}} {{at the site of}} the Port of Split was Aspalathos, {{established}} by Greek settlers from the island of Vis in the 4th century BC. Position of the trading post was selected because of its location in a natural harbor and its proximity to numerous Adriatic Sea islands and extensive hinterland populated by Illyrians, most notably in Salona. The area subsequently became a part of the Roman Empire, and after its Decline of the Roman Empire, the coast was brought under rule of the Byzantine Empire, until the area was absorbed into the Kingdom of Croatia in the beginning of the 10th century. In 1102, Croatia and Kingdom of Hungary were <b>joined</b> <b>in</b> <b>a</b> personal union. By the 12th century, Split had developed trading routes with its hinterland and maritime trade throughout the Adriatic Sea and the Mediterranean. The Republic of Venice of gained full control of Dalmatia and the city of Split by 1428. In the 16th century, Split was the central maritime trade outlet of the Balkans, where goods were transported from the Ottoman Empire, India and Persia to the Venetian Republic and vice versa. After the fall of Venice, Split was briefly ruled by the Habsburg Monarchy and Austrian Empire between 1797 and 1806, and the First French Empire until 1813 when Austrian rule was restored. In that period, trade routes shifted to other Adriatic ports, especially the Port of Rijeka, causing a downturn in the city's economy.|$|E
