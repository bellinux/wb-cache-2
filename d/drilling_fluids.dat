30|$|In oil-drilling operations, a {{filtrate}} reducer is {{the most}} commonly used <b>drilling</b> <b>fluid</b> additive. Its main functions are reducing <b>drilling</b> <b>fluid</b> filtration by forming thin and dense filter cakes on the wellbore, thus reducing the mutual permeability between the mud filtrate and wellbore, minimizing wellbore instability, and ensuring the stability of <b>drilling</b> <b>fluid</b> performance (Zhang and Deng 1998). Partially hydrolyzed sodium polyacrylonitrile with an anionic hydration group, polyacrylonitrile calcium salts, and polyacrylonitrile ammonium salts are widely used as filtrate reducers, which meet the requirements of well drilling operations below 120  °C (Cui and Zhu 1999; Ahmed et al. 2013). The application of an allyl copolymer with cationic groups in the <b>drilling</b> <b>fluid</b> has been reported. This mainly revolves around its application to cationic and zwitterionic <b>drilling</b> <b>fluid</b> systems (Zhang and Deng 1998; Warren et al. 2000). Hydrophobically modified polyacrylamide as a sealing agent has been used in water-based <b>drilling</b> <b>fluid.</b> This can effectively improve the temperature and salt resistance of water-based <b>drilling</b> <b>fluid</b> system (Xie et al. 2013). Lubricants based on water-soluble polyacrylamide have also been used in drilling, particularly in low-density <b>drilling</b> <b>fluid</b> systems (Wang 2013). In recent years, standards of <b>drilling</b> <b>fluid</b> systems have become higher with the increase in deep and complex wells.

40|$|In deep {{drilling}} operation, borehole collapse due to insufficient <b>drilling</b> <b>fluid</b> pressure and borehole fracturing {{as a result}} of excessive <b>drilling</b> <b>fluid</b> pressure are two major modes of borehole failure. The latter may result in severe loss of <b>drilling</b> <b>fluid</b> into the formation, resulting in potential well control issues with influx of high pressure fluid or gas from adjacent formation layers. To prevent <b>drilling</b> <b>fluid</b> loss, the fluid pressure must not exceed an upper limit, otherwise the borehole will fail in tension or fracture.
