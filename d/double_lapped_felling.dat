It was pointed out that the load bearing capacity of the joggle <b>double</b> <b>lap</b> joint may be higher than that of the <b>double</b> <b>lap</b> joint for its decrease of peak stress, much evenly stress distribution in the middle part of the overlap zone so that more load can be subjected by the joggle <b>double</b> <b>lap</b> joint...|$|R

The effect of plate thickness using an aircraft grade aluminium alloy with <b>double</b> <b>lap</b> joints was also studied. Constant amplitude fatigue tests, under load control, were carried out, with a near zero stress ratio, on plain specimens (for bench mark purposes) and on both single and <b>double</b> <b>lap</b> joint specimens, for which several torque levels were applied on the bolted joints. The objective of the fatigue tests was to demonstrate failure trends for each joint type, material thickness and torque loading, rather than the generation of comprehensive S-N curves. Possible factors that affected the fatigue life of the bolted joints are discussed and conclusions are drawn with respect to the beneficial effects of tightening torques on the bolted single and <b>double</b> <b>lap</b> joints.

For the conventional <b>double</b> <b>lap</b> joint (DLJ), the high shear stress and peer stress {{taking place in}} the adhesive layer near the patch termination significantly influenced the joint strength. In order to diminish the amount of the stresses, a new design of stepwise patch was introduced in the fabrication of the double-lap joint.

40|$|Numerous {{advantages}} of the bonded joints result in wide application in the aircraft, motor industry or powertrain components. These types of joints enable joining materials with different mechanical properties (e. g. stiffness) and dimensions without structure change. Proper joint design limits the field of local stress concentrations or even eliminates them. The structural integrity of complete structure depends on the fatigue estimation of the bonded joint. Application of the finite element method to life prediction of the <b>double</b> <b>lap</b> bonded joint metal-composite-metal is presented. Three dimensional numerical models are generated by professional engineering software tools. The contact problem is modelled between the epoxy resin and metal and composite surfaces. A laminated composite consists of the epoxy woven carbon prepreg.

40|$|ABSTRACT: A co-cured {{joining method}} has several {{advantages}} over an adhesively-bonded joining method for its simple manufacturing process. It requires neither an adhesive nor surface {{treatment of the}} composite adherend and uses excess resin to bond both adherends, including composite adherend. In this paper, the effects of bond parameters, including surface roughness on the steel adherend, stacking sequence of the composite adherend, and manufacturing pressure in the autoclave during the bonding process, on tensile load bearing capacities of plate-type co-cured single and <b>double</b> <b>lap</b> joints were investigated experimentally. Bond parameters were related to interfacial parameters such as a contact area and adhesive thickness, which affected the joint strength. Experimental results were explained with respect to all of interfacial parameters and bond parameters through investigating failure surfaces of the steel adherend {{and a lot of}} data of tensile load bearing capacities. In order to predict tensile load bearing capacities of co-cured single and <b>double</b> <b>lap</b> joints, we considered two different failure models using stress distributions in both co-cured lap joints obtained from finite element analysis. Finally, optimal conditions to improve the joint strength of co-cured single and <b>double</b> <b>lap</b> joints have been presented.

The geometry modifies conventional <b>double</b> <b>lap</b> shear tests to minimize peel stresses and facilitate specimen fabrication, and thereby increase test reproducibility. The bonded part of the new specimen is identical to a conventional <b>double</b> <b>lap</b> shear specimen, but the specimen is end-loaded in compression instead of in tension. We analyzed the stress state using a new shear-lag theory for multilayered systems that includes residual stresses and friction on debonded surfaces. Axial stresses, shear stresses, and axial displacements were calculated for specimens stressed in the elastic regime, or beyond where local damage or yielding of the adhesive are present. They all compared well with the results of finite element analysis. Failure models of the specimen were derived using both strength and energy release rate methods. The model captured all the essential features of the energy release rate, including the e#ects of internal stresses and of friction at the debonded interface, within a certain range of debond length and friction stress. The results in this paper will be used in the remaining articles of this series, demonstrating the e#ects of internal stresses and physical aging of the adhesive on practical adhesion...|$|R

40|$|Experimental and {{numerical}} investigations {{were carried}} out on adhesively bonded full-scale <b>double</b> <b>lap</b> joints from pultruded GFRP profiles with relatively thick adhesive layers, needed in infrastructure applications to compensate for tolerances. The influence of different geometrical parameters on the joint strength was investigated, namely {{the thickness of the}} adhesive layer (from 5 to 35 mm), the fillet radius (from 2 to 10 mm) and the overlap length (from 100 to 300 mm). A statistically based method for the strength prediction of adhesively bonded <b>double</b> <b>lap</b> joints from pultruded GFRP adherends subjected to quasi-static tensile loading is therefore suggested. The prediction method is based on the experimentally determined material strength and its statistical distribution. It takes into consideration the scale sensitivity of the strength, modelled using Weibull statistics. The developed method considers not only the magnitude of the stress fields, but also the volume over which stress peaks act. The method provided reasonable results for brittle joint failure, while it cannot be used to predict joint strength of quasi-brittle or pseudo-ductile joint failures showing minor statistical scale sensitivity...|$|R
40|$|In this research, an {{experimental}} method {{for measuring the}} clamping force {{as a result of}} tightening torque in <b>double</b> <b>lap</b> simple bolted and hybrid (bolted-bonded) joints is proposed. Two types of joints, i. e. <b>double</b> <b>lap</b> simple and hybrid (bolted-bonded) joints were prepared for testing. In order to measure the clamping force or pretension resulting from the tightening torque at different applied torques, for both types of joints, a special experimental method was designed using a steel bush that was placed between the nut and the plate. Two strain gauges were stuck to the outer surface of the bush to measure the compressive axial strain and also the stress in the bush using Hookeâs law. Finally, the axial force in the bush and subsequently the clamping force were determined. The test was repeated three times for each case to obtain the mean value of compressive strains and to determine the corresponding clamping forces. The relationship between the applied tightening torques and the mean value of compressive strains for both types of joints are shown in graphs...|$|R

40|$|Adhesive bonding {{has become}} a {{powerful}} joining technique {{during the last few}} decades. It has many applications in aerospace, automotive and other industries. One of the major advantages of adhesive bonding, compared to riveting or welding, lies in its superior fatigue resistance. In this paper, fatigue crack propagation in adhesively bonded joints is analysed and discussed. Three different bonded joints are considered in this study, namely Double Cantilever Beams, Single <b>Lap</b> Joints and <b>Double</b> <b>Lap</b> Joints. Experimental samples were made from carbon fibre composite substrates bonded with an epoxy adhesive. The joints were tested in constant amplitude fatigue at different loads and plots of load against number of cycles to failure were obtained.

40|$|AbstractFailure in anisotropic/isotropic bi-materials {{starts at}} the interface, and the {{interfacial}} failure is of interest to some engineering fields. However, since the procedure for evaluating stress intensities at the interface corner is very complicated and time-consuming, few researchers have used it to calculate singular stress fields and stress intensities, though doing so would allow prediction of the failure strength of a structure. In this paper, a simple procedure for obtaining stress intensities is introduced in the estimation of the failure strength of anisotropic/isotropic bi-materials. The expanded Stroh formalism is used to obtain asymptotic stress and displacement fields near the anisotropic/isotropic bi-material interface corner. The procedure {{makes it possible to}} calculate singular stress fields more easily than before. To evaluate stress intensities at the interface corner, a path-independent conservative line integral derived from Bettiâs reciprocal principle is used. To present {{a detailed description of the}} procedure, we describe the procedure of calculating singular stress fields and stress intensities of co-cured <b>double</b> <b>lap</b> joints with a wedge that consists of carbon fiber reinforced plastic composite and steel adherends. We found two singular terms in describing stress and displacement fields near the wedge tip, and each of them referred to a different deformation mode: mode I and II.

Failure surfaces and interfaces of <b>double</b> <b>lap</b> joints were investigated, and a fracture criterion on the KIn-KIIn plane is presented...|$|R
