5|$|The video drew many {{comparisons}} to the rumors of Carey's deteriorating marriage at the time. Author Chris Nickson felt the video, like the song, {{served as a}} metaphor <b>for</b> <b>the</b> <b>things</b> <b>that</b> were taking place in her life at the time. Rumors circulated that Mottola was controlling, abusive and would even monitor Carey's phone calls. For this reason, she is portrayed with tattered clothing and hair in the video, with the final moments showing her escape. It features Carey finally leaving the lonely and abusive marriage she once was part of, and finally breaking free into the outside world. Unlike the video, the lyrics spoke of setting your loved one free, {{because it is the}} best thing for them; showing that their love for the person should be greater than their own happiness.|$|E

500|$|Homer {{is invited}} to speak his mind on a popular cable news show called Head Butt, on which host Nash Castor and {{commentator}} Adriatica Vel Johnson argue that he will soon be forgotten. However, Homer makes a convincing rant in which he tells the viewers that unlike television [...] such as Nash and Adriatica, he speaks for the common man. When the show is over, the cable network executives give Homer his own television show called Gut Check with Homer Simpson, where he provides a mix of populist and conservative ideas. During one episode, he pours [...] "gravy of freedom" [...] over a steak shaped like America, using the gravy as a metaphor <b>for</b> <b>the</b> <b>things</b> <b>that</b> make the country great. He then encourages his viewers to [...] "get on the boat" [...] to protest about the bad things in society, and proceeds to place a gravy boat on his head. This wins Homer a huge base of support among average Americans, and soon the [...] "gravy boat movement" [...] becomes popular throughout the country.|$|E

500|$|Academic Peter Hutchings, {{noting the}} many {{definitions}} of a cult film that require transgressive elements, states that cult films are known {{in part for}} their excesses. [...] Both subject matter and its depiction are portrayed in extreme ways that break taboos of good taste and aesthetic norms. [...] Violence, gore, sexual perversity, and even the music can be pushed to stylistic excess far beyond that allowed by mainstream cinema. Film censorship can make these films obscure and difficult to find, common criteria used to define cult films. [...] Despite this, these films remain well-known and prized among collectors. [...] Fans will occasionally express frustration with dismissive critics and conventional analysis, which they believe marginalizes and misinterprets paracinema. [...] In marketing these films, young men are predominantly targeted. [...] Horror films in particular can draw fans who seek the most extreme films. [...] Audiences can also ironically latch on to offensive themes, such as misogyny, using these films as catharsis <b>for</b> <b>the</b> <b>things</b> <b>that</b> they hate most in life. [...] Exploitative, transgressive elements can be pushed to excessive extremes for both humor and satire. Frank Henenlotter faced censorship and ridicule, but he found acceptance among audiences receptive to themes that Hollywood was reluctant to touch, such as violence, drug addiction, and misogyny. Lloyd Kaufman sees his films' political statements as more populist and authentic than the hypocrisy of mainstream films and celebrities. Despite featuring an abundance of fake blood, vomit, and diarrhea, Kaufman's films have attracted positive attention from critics and academics. [...] Excess can also exist as camp, such as films that highlight the excesses of 1980s fashion and commercialism.|$|E

2500|$|Paul Cantor, in {{his short}} text called simply Hamlet, formulates a {{compelling}} {{theory of the}} play that places the prince {{at the center of}} the Renaissance conflict between Ancient and Christian notions of heroism. Cantor says that the Renaissance signified a [...] "rebirth of classical antiquity within a Christian culture". But such a rebirth brought with it a deep contradiction: Christ's teachings of humility and meekness ("whoever shall smite thee on thy right cheek, turn to him the other also") are in direct conflict with the ancient ethos that is best represented by Achilles' violent action in the Iliad ("I wish only that my spirit and fury would drive me to hack your meat away and eat it raw <b>for</b> <b>the</b> <b>things</b> <b>that</b> you have done to me").|$|E
2500|$|In {{the summer}} of 1970, {{according}} to Barry, [...] "Robin rang me in Spain where I was on holiday [...] 'let's do it again'". By 21 August 1970, after they had reunited, Barry announced that the Bee Gees [...] "are there and they will never, ever part again". Maurice said, [...] "We just discussed it and re-formed. We want to apologise publicly to Robin <b>for</b> <b>the</b> <b>things</b> <b>that</b> have been said." [...] Earlier in June 1970, Robin and Maurice recorded a dozen songs before Barry joined and included two songs that were on their reunion album. Around the same time, Barry and Robin were about to publish the book, On the Other Hand. They also recruited Geoff Bridgford as the group's official drummer; Bridgford had previously worked with the Groove and Tin Tin, and played drums on Maurice's unreleased first solo album.|$|E
2500|$|The {{production}} {{was met with}} highly critical reviews from the Russian press, whose complaints were mostly all pointed towards Craig. One critic described the performance as being “smothered by Craig’s screens”. [...] The overall opinion of the Russian critics was that Craig’s modern concept distracted from the play itself. However, Nikolay Efros, insisted that despite the flaws of the production, the theatre must be admired <b>for</b> <b>the</b> <b>things</b> <b>that</b> they aspired to achieve, and the immense amount of work they put in. The press in England [...] was much kinder, and rumors spread very quickly through western Europe of the great triumph of Craig’s vision, despite the production in actuality being a complete failure. While Olga Knipper (Gertrude), Nikolai Massalitinov (Claudius) and Olga Gzovskaia (Ophelia) received poor reviews in the Russian press, Vasili Kachalov's performance as Hamlet was praised as a genuine achievement, one which succeeded in displacing the legend of Mochalov's mid-19th-century Romantic Hamlet.|$|E
