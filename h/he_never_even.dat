25|$|Her brother {{says the}} report of him {{catching}} her with his girlfriend is completely fabricated and that <b>he</b> <b>never</b> <b>even</b> spoke with the detective who wrote it. Similarly, Lieberman says the couple never fought at the courthouse after her arraignment. The police, they believe, were extrapolating from what little they could find {{in an effort to}} make up for their early inattention to the case.|$|E
25|$|Before the game, Gregg Easterbrook (author of Tuesday Morning Quarterback from Page 2 on ESPN.com) named Harrison the 2008 Tuesday Morning Quarterback Non-QB Non-RB NFL MVP. When {{receiving}} the trophy for the award, Harrison said <b>he</b> <b>never</b> <b>even</b> {{heard of the}} award. The week before, Easterbrook named Harrison to his annual All-Unwanted All-Pros due to his struggles earlier in his career of having been cut four times, three by the Steelers.|$|E
25|$|Stassen {{was later}} {{best known for}} being a {{perennial}} candidate for the Republican Party nomination for President of the United States, seeking it nine times between 1944 and 1992 (1944, 1948, 1952, 1964, 1968, 1980, 1984, 1988, and 1992). He never won the Republican nomination, much less the presidency; in fact, after 1952, <b>he</b> <b>never</b> <b>even</b> came close, but continued to campaign actively and seriously for President until just a year before his death.|$|E

25|$|The diary {{abruptly}} {{picks up}} when Jared regains consciousness after {{being involved in}} an explosion. In the hospital, Jared attempts to piece together his memories, chronicling that one of B's lecture theatres was bombed; Shirin and B's inner circle are presumably all dead. Flown back to the United States to recuperate, Jared eventually confronts Fr. Lulfre from whom he learns that the Laurentian order indeed authorized both B's assassination and {{the bombing of the}} theatre. Jared renounces his devotion to the order and returns hastily back to Europe, desperately searching for any information about possible survivors of the bombing and lamenting his lack of knowledge about the people he seeks out, for example, the fact that <b>he</b> <b>never</b> <b>even</b> learned Shirin's last name. Ultimately, though, Jared recalls that the theatre had an underground tunnel through which Shirin and the others might have escaped. Visiting the mouth of the tunnel, which is barricaded by wooden planks, Jared finds contact information engraved in the wood. He is later reunited with Shirin and the others, and the memory comes flooding in that he warned them to flee moments before the explosion, thus saving their lives. A brief epilogue explains that Jared and Shirin plan to completely disappear from the public eye together; moments before Jared must leave to board a plane, he urges the spreading of B's philosophy and writes the final words of his diary: that Charles Atterley, Shirin, he, and the reader, too, are all B.|$|E
500|$|Matthew Cradock (also spelled Craddock and Craddocke) (died 27 May 1641) was a London merchant, politician, and {{the first}} {{governor}} of the Massachusetts Bay Company. [...] Founded in 1628, it was an organization of Puritan businessmen that organized and established the Massachusetts Bay Colony. [...] Although <b>he</b> <b>never</b> <b>even</b> visited the colony, he owned property and businesses there, and he acted on its behalf in London. [...] His business and trading empire encompassed at least 18 ships, and extended from the West Indies and North America to Europe and the Near East. [...] He was a dominant figure in the tobacco trade.|$|E
500|$|Greene {{and middle}} linebacker Jack Lambert became the {{emotional}} leaders of Pittsburgh's defensive squad. Greene {{was described as}} a huge presence {{both on and off the}} field. Once, in the locker room, a teammate was loudly voicing his discontent over the long and cold practice they had just gone through as he yanked off his equipment. At a nearby locker, Greene lifted his head and silently glared at him. [...] "Believe me, that's all Joe did, <b>he</b> <b>never</b> <b>even</b> said anything," [...] Joe Gordon of the Steelers front office recalled. [...] "I don't think the other players saw Joe glare at him. I think the other player just felt it, and then he sat down and never said another word." [...] A natural leader, Greene was named the captain of the defense in 1977. His leadership was also channeled to the offense; Lynn Swann, a wide receiver, considered Greene a mentor. [...] "If you were giving less than 100 percent, he let you know one way or the other," [...] said Swann.|$|E

60|$|Mr. Morin? Certainly not. <b>He</b> was <b>never</b> <b>even</b> {{a spectator}} at the races. Not {{that kind of}} a man. Surprised the gentlemen should ask.|$|R
500|$|Warner Bros. {{president}} of production Jeff Robinov had hoped a third film {{would be released}} in 2011 or 2012. Nolan wanted the story for the third installment to keep him emotionally invested. [...] "On a more superficial level, I {{have to ask the}} question," [...] he reasoned, [...] "how many good third movies in a franchise can people name?" [...] Nolan said that <b>he</b> <b>never</b> <b>even</b> thought a third film was possible in the foreword for his book The Art and Making of the Dark Knight Trilogy. Nolan only agreed to a third film on the basis of finding a worthwhile story, fearing that he would become bored halfway through production if he discovered the film to be unnecessary. By December 2008, Nolan completed a rough story outline, before he committed himself to Inception. Later in December, Alan F. Horn confirmed that while discussions with Nolan about a third film were ongoing, no casting had been done, and Horn denied all such rumors. Before Nolan confirmed his involvement, Gary Oldman had said he was confident Nolan would return.|$|E
2500|$|The Red Monks (1989, a.k.a. I Frati Rossi, a.k.a.

Fulci was credited with handling the film's special effects, which he later denied having been involved with.|$|E
2500|$|Ishii also penned {{the script}} for Ikeda's 1988 Evil Dead Trap, called Japan's first [...] "splatter movie", and {{credited}} with being the first Japanese modern horror film. Although usually {{said to have been}} influenced by Sam Raimi’s The Evil Dead and the work of Dario Argento, Ikeda claimed in an interview never to have seen their films, hating horror so much that <b>he</b> <b>never</b> <b>even</b> watched Evil Dead Trap. He did, however, attend a showing of the film in Los Angeles when it was released for American audiences in 1999. The film was successful enough to spawn two sequels but Ikeda only directed the second of these, [...] (1993).|$|E

2500|$|... "On {{the stage}} sat four Indian men, {{one of whom}} was Sitting Bull. [...] There were two women and two {{children}} with them. [...] A white man came on stage and introduced Sitting Bull as the man who had killed General Custer (which, of course, was absolutely false). [...] Sitting Bull arose and addressed the audience in the Sioux tongue, as he did not speak nor understand English. [...] He said, ‘My friends, white people, we Indians are on our way to Washington to see the Grandfather, or President of the United States. [...] I see so many white people and what they are doing, that it makes me glad to know that some day my children will be educated also. [...] There is no use fighting any longer. [...] The buffalo are all gone, as well {{as the rest of the}} game. [...] Now I am going to shake the hand of the Great Father at Washington, and I am going to tell him all these things.’ Then Sitting Bull sat down. <b>He</b> <b>never</b> <b>even</b> mentioned General Custer’s name.|$|E

5000|$|An AllMusic review stated [...] "these {{songs are}} direct and kinetic, full of hooks, rich in metaphors and irony, and a sleight-of-hand confessionalism.

[...] The review noted the debt owed to The Velvet Underground, and also said, [...] " [...] these spirited, well-crafted songs offer rock & roll in a manner <b>he's</b> <b>never</b> <b>even</b> hinted at before." ...|$|R
