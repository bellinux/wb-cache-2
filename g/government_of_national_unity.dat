After the liberation of Belgium in September 1944, Pierlot returned to Brussels where, against his wishes, he headed a fresh <b>government</b> <b>of</b> <b>national</b> <b>unity</b> until February 1945. Criticism from the political left and the failure of the new government to deal with the serious issues facing the country following the liberation led to the fall of the government in February 1945 and he was replaced by the socialist Achille Van Acker. Pierlot's stance against Leopold III during the war made him a controversial figure during his lifetime and he was widely disliked in the same royalist and conservative circles from which his own Catholic Party (later the Christian Social Party) drew most of its support. He retired from politics in 1946 amid the crisis of the Royal Question, surrounding whether Leopold could return to the Belgian throne, and died peacefully in 1963. After his death, Pierlot's reputation improved as the decisions he took during the war were reconsidered by historians.|$|E

This article ventures into uncharted territory by asking two questions: first, does the discourse surrounding the <b>Government</b> <b>of</b> <b>National</b> <b>Unity’s</b> (GNU) campaign to increase women’s participation in formal politics uncritically assume that women parliamentarians will have a different relationship to politics, paring women representatives’ identities down to non-ethnic female subjects, seen only as promoting peaceful reconciliation? Secondly, given what external actors increasingly term an ‘authoritarian state’ that lacks political space, does the notion that women will change the political climate have any substantive meaning in post-genocidal Rwanda? The answers to such queries show that viewing the Rwandan case with a critical and gendered lens generates deeper meaning for how women political representatives’ identities can be dangerously frozen and ‘subjectified’ in post-conflict contexts; particularly those intent on building ‘national unity’ by way of quieting dissent...|$|R

This shift represents a radical departure from public ownership as embedded in the Freedom Charter, to a compromise towards a 'mixed economy' and 'growth through re-distribution', to a present capitulation towards a World Bank/IMF style macroeconomic strategy, which effectively marginalises the RDP both in content, and the means for its implementation. It is ironical that a privatisation programme, which was subject to extreme opposition and threats of re-nationalisation by the ANC and its present social partners - the South African Communist Party (SACP) and the Council of South African Trade Unions (COSATU) during the late 1980 's, is now actively pursued by the GNU, even in the present wake of extreme opposition from the SACP and COSATU.

40|$|Thesis (MCom (Kommunikasiekunde)) [...] PU vir CHO, 1995. Due to {{the growing}} dissatisfaction with mass tourism, {{ecotourism}} has emerged as an alternative form of tourism. This form of tourism is based on three precepts: conservation must take place, the neighbouring community has to benefit from it and it should give some information to the tourists visiting the attraction or area of attraction. Ecotourism offers a unique possibility to South Africa, because it is environmentally friendly and therefore provides an ideal opportunity for development. It {{is consistent with the}} <b>Government</b> <b>of</b> <b>National</b> <b>Unity's</b> Reconstruction and Development Programme (RDP) and furthermore, would relieve the growing burden of poverty in our country. An attempt at an ecotourism effort would however, not be successfU 1 without effective communication and therefore the advantages of ecotourism and the different components of ecotourism need to be communicated to the population as well as the tourists. Intercultural and development communication is essential. Development communication is not measured by the process but by the end result. This study is {{based on the premise that}} a successful ecotourism project necessitates a participatory developmental communicative approach. Without the participation of the local community, success cannot be guaranteed. This also means that local and traditional knowledge of the community have to be taken into consideration in conjunction with the modem technology and mass media. The results of this study show that ecotourism is practised on a small and informal scale in the Thabazimbi area with economic and cultural benefit for all. Conservation does not only mean conservation of nature but of a specific culture as well. The local community has a rich culture of which it should be justifiably proud. Ecotourism contributes to the quality of life. The study also shows that communication enhances the ability of ecotourism to generate wealth and contribute to conservation. By informing the tourist about ecotourism it ensures future interest in nature and culture. Communication with the local community ensures participation, wealth and pride in their heritage. These are all components of the quality of life of a people. Master...|$|R

50|$|The {{onset of}} World War I exposed the {{weakness}} <b>of</b> Nicholas II's <b>government.</b> A show <b>of</b> <b>national</b> <b>unity</b> had accompanied Russia's {{entrance into the}} war, with defense of the Slavic Serbs the main battle cry. In the summer of 1914, the Duma and the zemstva expressed full support for the government's war effort. The initial conscription was well organized and peaceful, and the early phase of Russia's military buildup showed that the empire had learned lessons from the Russo-Japanese War. But military reversals and the government's incompetence soon soured much of the population. German control of the Baltic Sea and German-Ottoman control of the Black Sea severed Russia from most of its foreign supplies and potential markets. In addition, inept Russian preparations for war and ineffective economic policies hurt the country financially, logistically, and militarily. Inflation became a serious problem. Because of inadequate material support for military operations, the War Industry Committees were formed to ensure that necessary supplies reached the front. But army officers quarreled with civilian leaders, seized administrative control of front areas, and refused {{to cooperate with the}} committee. The central government distrusted the independent war support activities that were organized by zemstva and cities. The Duma quarreled with the war bureaucracy <b>of</b> the <b>government,</b> and center and center-left deputies eventually formed the Progressive Bloc to create a genuinely constitutional government.|$|R
40|$|Why {{are some}} {{negotiated}} settlements successful at resolving intrastate conflict, while others fail? Are settlements involving agreement {{to share power}} more effective and, if so, why have conclusions about power sharing been so mixed? I theorize in this project that power-sharing guarantees improve {{the prospects for a}} peaceful settlement by reducing the stakes of winning post-conflict elections, thereby increasing the likelihood that rebels will willingly demobilize. Contrary to the preeminent model of bargaining for peace in the literature, I posit that the costs of complying with a negotiated settlement are asymmetrical. For rebels, compliance means forfeiting military capacity and bargaining power. In contrast, the government never concedes its monopoly on the use of force and, therefore, always retains the option of resorting to military action. Given this, and the risk of competing against an entrenched incumbent with an electoral advantage, it is a rational strategy for rebels to resist demobilization until expectations of future benefits are sufficiently high. Power-sharing reforms can help to increase the perceived value of the payoff to rebel elites, thereby increasing willingness to demobilize, but only when they are designed to outlast elections. Institutions that expire after a transitional period, such as coalitions and <b>governments</b> <b>of</b> <b>national</b> <b>unity,</b> fail to redress the incumbency advantage or to reduce the importance of winning post-conflict elections outright, heightening incentives for rebels to preemptively defect. The logic of my theory of preemptive defection explains why rebels would be willing to trade military capacity for long-term power sharing, and it also acknowledges the potential for rebel splintering after a settlement is signed. In the absence of power-sharing guarantees, certain elements of the rebel leadership might still be able to secure a deal that is personally beneficial. As this process of selective cooptation reveals winners and losers during the implementation period, disgruntled rebel elites have an incentive to defect unilaterally, and the likelihood of conflict recurrence is determined by their capacity to access the resources of war. Specifically, my work shows that splintering is enabled by two factors. First, the failure to sign an all-inclusive settlement means that excluded groups are more willing to form an alliance in order to facilitate continued conflict. Second, governments with a reputation for defecting on their peace agreements are easy targets for rebel leaders hoping to mobilize defection from within their own ranks. Empirically, this project relies on a nested design. It starts with new data collection on 138 negotiated settlements to domestic armed conflict signed between 1975 and 2005. I coded each settlement for its inclusion of power-sharing provisions, with specific attention to different types of power sharing and the distinction between permanent and transitional guarantees. A binomial logistic regression analysis of conflict termination reveals strong support for the central expectations of this study. Settlements that include provisions for permanent power sharing are significantly more likely to result in peace, all else equal, while transitional arrangements have no effect. I then selected a best-fit case exhibiting change over time in order to examine the underlying mechanisms at work. Through extensive field research in Uganda, including interviews with rebel and government representatives and archival and secondary research, I sought to understand why members of the insurgent party eventually rejected four of the five settlements signed, and what conditions allowed them to continue fighting for a more favorable bargain. My research indicates that settlements are more likely to succeed in resolving conflict where they include provisions for power sharing over the long term. Such guarantees increase the willingness of rebels to surrender their weapons, and they create more diffuse benefits and long-term time horizons throughout the leadership, which reduce the potential for splintering. These findings offer a number of contributions to the literature on conflict resolution and post-conflict power sharing. Most importantly, they show that including permanent and transitional formulas under the same umbrella concept have led to faulty and contradictory conclusions about the effectiveness of power sharing. In addition, by disaggregating the way that the benefits of a settlement are perceived across the rebel elite, this project helps to explain why many are signed that have few prospects of success, and it provides lessons for identifying such bargains before they can degenerate into renewed conflict. Finally, the theory departs from the common focus on coercive third-party enforcement of peace agreements by emphasizing the rationality of rebel decisions to comply or defect and showing that settlements are most effective where insurgents prefer compliance—namely, where the benefits offered outweigh the costs of both continued fighting and democratization. This suggests a different role for the international community in peace processes, specifically in disseminating new norms and strategies for engineering institutions, rather than investing in costly peacekeeping missions...|$|R

40|$|The Federal <b>Government’s</b> ideal <b>of</b> {{strengthening}} <b>national</b> <b>unity</b> through official bilingualism {{has been}} reawakened by its recently announced goal of doubling {{the proportion of}} bilingual graduates by 2013. The underlying objectives of French second language education have not changed since the Official Languages Act of 1969, but the routes to achieve them have undergone a significant evolution. The two major pan-Canadian approaches to teaching and learning French (core French and French immersion) have now been joined by another, intensive French. This case study documents the implementation of an intensive French program in Surrey, British Columbia over nearly three years. I contextualized the implementation within the history of official language policy and second language education in Canada and British Columbia and examined sociopolitical forces working for and against establishment of the new program. I drew on the existing literature on language policy and implementation {{with a focus on}} the influence on language education in Canada and in British Columbia. I also considered the relationship between language, identity and education and how globalization and language commodification influence policy and individual choices. Using a responsive evaluation approach, I developed my understanding and helped stakeholders co-construct their understandings of the program and then applied theories of social hierarchy to interpret the interactions of various stakeholder groups. Finally, I considered the role of professional and organizational learning in this implementation.

Assumptions about the linear implementation of program innovation were disrupted by the experiences of the teachers. They needed time and space to experiment, reflect and share as they problematized and integrated the new teaching approach.
