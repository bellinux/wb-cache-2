5|$|An 1891 Ordnance Survey {{map shows}} that the arm on the Rochdale Canal had been filled in and the complex's canal basin had been retitled as a reservoir, {{suggesting}} that the canal had ceased {{to be used as}} a way of transporting goods to and from the complex. By 1902, the canal basin had been filled in, however exactly when <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>filled</b> in is unknown.|$|E
5|$|By {{the mid-19th}} century it {{had gone out of}} use as a reservoir; being partly filled with rubbish and reused as a {{vegetable}} garden. In 1934 <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>filled</b> in and is now known as el-Ghazali Square. It is currently in mixed use for shops, as a car park, and as a transshipment point for refuse.|$|E

5|$|The Duke {{occupied}} {{the post of}} Lord Warden until 1765, save for two periods when <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>filled</b> by James Butler, the Duke of Ormonde and John Sidney, the Earl of Leicester. He carried out extensive work to make the castle more habitable, building extensions towards the north bastion and constructing a small house in the south bastion for the soldiers. Under the subsequent Lord Wardens, the politicians Robert Darcy, the Earl of Holderness, and Francis North, the Earl of Guildford, the castle continued to house artillery but it became increasingly less military in character.|$|E
5|$|Fitzgerald had {{no system}} {{to monitor the}} {{presence}} or amount of water in her cargo hold, {{even though there was}} always some present. The intensity of the November 10 storm would have made it difficult, if not impossible, to access the hatches from the spar deck. The USCG Marine Board found that flooding of the hold could not have been assessed until the water {{reached the top of the}} taconite cargo. The NTSB investigation concluded that it would have been impossible to pump water from the hold when <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>filled</b> with bulk cargo. The Marine Board noted that because Fitzgerald lacked a draft-reading system, the crew had no way to determine whether the vessel had lost freeboard (the level of a ship's deck above the water).|$|E
5|$|Magnetic Airborne Detection (MAD) {{was used}} to detect {{submerged}} U-boats. It consisted of a sensitive magnetometer installed in the cone of the aircraft (mostly Catalinas) that could detect anomalies in the Earth's magnetic field within a range of 400 feet and was sensitive to detect a submarine to within a few feet. The mine was {{used in conjunction with}} a 65.5lb retro bomb. <b>It</b> <b>was</b> <b>filled</b> with 25lb of Torpex and the weapon was rocket propelled backwards to the line of flight at a speed that counteracted the aircraft's forward motion. It was released rearwards from rails on the wings of the aircraft. Thus, with the aircraft's forward motion cancelled-out by the rocket motor, the device fell directly onto the target.|$|E

5|$|While {{anchored}} off the Galápagos, Beebe and {{his crew}} noticed volcanic activity on Albemarle Island, {{and set out to}} investigate it. Anchoring in a small cove, Beebe and his assistant John Tee-Van searched for an active crater where they could observe the eruption, and were nearing exhaustion by the time they found one. As he observed the crater, Beebe realized that the air surrounding <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>filled</b> with noxious gases, and narrowly avoided suffocation before staggering away from it. Observing the eruption from his ship for another two days, as well as again at a later point in the expedition, Beebe recorded how numerous birds and marine animals were killed after either failing to escape the lava, or drawing too close to it in an attempt to scavenge other animals that had died.|$|E

However, it never went to Russia, and was still in 71st Division in early 1918.|$|E
25|$|The 23rd Infantry Brigade remained, {{but without}} battalions, as these {{had been lost}} when Ambon, Rabaul and Timor fell. <b>It</b> <b>was</b> <b>filled</b> up with Militia battalions, and it and other {{remaining}} elements of the 8th Division participated in the campaigns in the South West Pacific.

25|$|The Canal {{was never}} a {{commercial}} success and in 1849 much of <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>filled</b> in by the North Staffordshire Railway Company and converted into the NSR Churnet Valley line from Leekbrook to Uttoxeter (which itself was finally closed for goods traffic in 1988). This line is still open {{as far south as}} Oakamoor, as a preserved railway, the Churnet Valley Railway.|$|E
25|$|The Landing Masonry Bridge {{continued}} {{to be used by}} automobiles along Mount Arlington Road and Old Netcong Road. By 1925, parts of the Morris Canal were filled in during construction of Station Road under the old bridge, allowing access to the new station. The use of the Morris Canal ended in 1924, and in the next five years, <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>filled</b> in by different structures.|$|E
25|$|The above {{rules have}} applied since October 1, 1982.

25|$|The {{bomb was}} {{fitted with a}} single {{transverse}} fuze pocket. The bomb was usually filled {{with a mixture of}} 40% amatol and 60% TNT, but when used as an anti-shipping bomb <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>filled</b> with Trialen 105, a mixture of 15% RDX, 70% TNT and 15% aluminium powder. A central exploder tube of high grade TNT was put down the centre of the explosive to ensure high order detonation.|$|E
25|$|During {{the spring}} of 2009, parts of the ship's rear outer decks areas were rebuilt into an indoor dance bar. All {{conversion}} work was carried out while the ship remained in normal service. Originally the Red Rose bar {{in the front of}} the ship was projected to be a dance restaurant, but in practice <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>filled</b> with diners eating food purchased from the ship's cafeteria. With the addition of the dance bar Viking Line hoped to attract more cruise passengers that sailed with the ships of competing Tallink and Eckerö Line. The reconstruction was completed by 1 May 2009.|$|E
25|$|Also on R deck, the {{first-class}} Turkish bath complex, the 1930s {{equivalent to}} a spa, was removed. The second-class pool was removed and its space initially used for office space, while the first-class swimming pool was open for viewing by hotel guests and visitors. Because of modern safety codes and the compromised structural soundness of the area directly below, the swimming pool {{could not be used}} for swimming after the conversion, although <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>filled</b> with water until the late 1980s. Today the pool can only be seen on guided tours and is in a derelict condition, having never been maintained by the hotel operators. No second-class, third-class or crew cabins remain intact aboard the ship today.|$|E
40|$|This paper {{deals with}} two questions. The first: are titles of artworks {{constitutive}} of what such works are? The second: are titles essential properties of artworks?
