50|$|Colleen is {{revealed}} to be the daughter of Len Brown, the original Dynamo and the Iron Maiden. They live quietly in Sydney, Australia, but the T.H.U.N.D.E.R. Squad raid their home and captured the family. Brown wears the <b>Dynamo</b> <b>belt</b> one last time {{in exchange for his}} daughter and the Iron Maiden's life and apparently dies during the mission. The Iron Maiden escapes T.H.U.N.D.E.R.'s custody, leaving Colleen to be raised by T.H.U.N.D.E.R. Years later, Colleen tracks down the Iron Maiden and after extracting information from her with the help of Toby Heston, leaves her to be killed by the daughter of one of her former victims.|$|E
5000|$|... "On the offside are the {{horizontal}} carburettor, the manifolds held by brass nuts, the air-cooled <b>dynamo</b> with a <b>belt</b> drive {{common to the}} combined fan and impeller and the steering box which has worm and double roller gear.|$|R
5000|$|The air-cooled, side valve, {{engine was}} a {{horizontally}} opposed twin and was originally of 998 cc capacity, with a bore of 85 mm and {{a stroke of}} 88 mm, but this was increased to 1134 cc with a 100 mm stroke in 1923. The original engine had a peak output of [...] at 2600 rpm. Although there was a conventional looking radiator it was a dummy. Cooling was supplied through air scoops {{on the side of}} the bonnet and it was rumoured that after hard driving at night the cylinder heads could be seen glowing red through them, although this was likely to be an exaggeration. Two cross-members of the frame supported at three points the assembled unit of engine and clutch and a three speed gearbox with reverse. The rear wheels were driven through a fabric joint and propellor shaft to a universal joint and an under-worm wheel type rear axle. A <b>dynamo</b> was <b>belt</b> driven from the propeller shaft. An electric starter was optional from 1923. [...] A six volt lighting set was provided.|$|R
50|$|Various petrol engines were used, an 85 hp Napier {{engine was}} the first to be installed, but these were found unsatisfactory, so were {{replaced}} in 1904 by Wolseley engines. These flat-four engines produced 92 bhp at their normal rated speed of 400rpm, and well over 100 bhp when run at 480rpm. The cylinders were 8.5 inch diameter with 10 inch stroke. The engine had a 3-foot diameter flywheel, and was coupled directly to a Westinghouse multi-polar dynamo. A small <b>dynamo</b> driven by <b>belt</b> from the flywheel provided charge for the accumulators which enabled electric starting of the engine, lighting for the carriage, and the exciting current for the field coils in the main dynamo, controlled by rheostats {{at either end of the}} railcar. The engine speed could likewise be controlled via a throttle from either end of the railcar. The output from the main dynamo was sent to two electric motors, both mounted on the bogie underneath the engine room.|$|R
