25|$|Children in {{indigenous}} communities can also {{learn from the}} underlying message of a story. For example, in a nahuatl community near Mexico City, stories about ahuaques or hostile water dwelling spirits that guard over the bodies of water, contain morals about respecting the environment. If the protagonist of a story, who has accidentally broken something that belongs to the ahuaque, <b>does</b> <b>not</b> <b>replace</b> it or give back {{in some way to}} the ahuaque, the protagonist dies. In this way, storytelling serves as a way to teach what the community values, such as valuing the environment.|$|E
25|$|As {{with the}} Test and ODI Rankings, the ICC T20I Team Rankings are an {{international}} Twenty20 ranking system {{run by the}} ICC. It is simply a ranking scheme overlaid on the regular T20I match schedule. After every T20I match, the two teams involved receive points based on a mathematical formula. The total of each team's points total is divided {{by the total number}} of matches to give a rating, and all teams are ranked on a table in order of rating. This ranking <b>does</b> <b>not</b> <b>replace</b> the ICC World Twenty20 competition.|$|E

25|$|In {{addition}} to PTCH1, mammals have another hedgehog receptor, PTCH2, whose sequence identity with PTCH1 is 54%. All three mammalian hedgehogs bind both receptors with similar affinity, so PTCH1 and PTCH2 cannot discriminate between the ligands. They do, however, {{differ in their}} expression patterns. PTCH2 is expressed at much higher levels in the testis and mediates desert hedgehog signaling there. It {{appears to have a}} distinct downstream signaling role from PTCH1. In the absence of ligand binding PTCH2 has a decreased ability to inhibit the activity of SMO. Furthermore, overexpression of PTCH2 <b>does</b> <b>not</b> <b>replace</b> mutated PTCH1 in basal cell carcinoma.|$|E
25|$|Synagogues are consecrated spaces {{used for}} the purpose of prayer, Tanakh (the entire Hebrew Scriptures {{including}} Torah) reading, study and assembly; however, a synagogue is not necessary for worship. Halakha holds that communal Jewish worship can be carried out wherever ten Jews (a minyan) assemble. Worship can also be carried out alone or with fewer than ten people assembled together. However, halakha considers certain prayers as communal prayers and therefore they may be recited only by a minyan. In terms of its specific ritual and liturgical functions, the synagogue <b>does</b> <b>not</b> <b>replace</b> the long-since destroyed Temple in Jerusalem.|$|E
25|$|The ICC ODI Team Rankings were created, and are run, by the ICC {{for reasons}} {{similar to the}} Test Rankings. The rankings are simply an {{international}} ranking scheme overlaid on the regular ODI (One Day International) match schedule. After every ODI match, the two teams involved receive points based on a mathematical formula. The total of each team's points total is divided {{by the total number}} of matches to give a rating, and all teams are ranked on a table in order of rating. The ranking <b>does</b> <b>not</b> <b>replace</b> the World Cup; the latter still carries much more significance to most cricket fans.|$|E

25|$|On {{the other}} hand, {{there is the}} order from the Signifier to His signs, from the Artisan to His works. In this branch the seeker {{experiences}} divine attraction (jadhba), {{and is able to}} enter the order with a glimpse of its endpoint, of direct apprehension of the Divine Presence towards which all spiritual striving is directed. This <b>does</b> <b>not</b> <b>replace</b> the striving to purify the heart, as in the other branch; it simply stems from a different point of entry into the path. This is the way primarily of the masters of the Naqshbandi and Shadhili orders.|$|E

500|$|Anime News Network's Casey Brienza {{stressed}} Mello's {{presence as}} a narrator {{in the light}} novel [...] "makes things a bit too breathless in places and a bit too self-conscious in others". A. E. Sparrow from IGN praised how the introduction of Mello, [...] "a man of action", [...] "spiced things up a bit" [...] as he brought [...] "actually" [...] action to the series. Manga News said Mello is [...] "an interesting character" [...] as he is [...] "unpredictable" [...] and also praised the action scenes he brings. As such, they criticized his almost total absence in volume 10 as he is [...] "one of the few to bring some new blood to the series". After Mello's death, Pepirium wrote [...] "Mello deserved more." [...] On the other hand, Mello is [...] "an unhinged character that only offers unpredictability", according to Chris Beveridge of Mania.com. AnimeLand and Manga News presented opposite opinions if whether or not Mello is charismatic character, with the former declaring he <b>does</b> <b>not</b> <b>replace</b> L as he lacks charisma.|$|E

2500|$|The {{creators of}} the Centering Prayer {{movement}} trace its roots to the contemplative prayer of the Desert Fathers of early Christian monasticism, to the Lectio Divina tradition of Benedictine monasticism, and to works like The Cloud of Unknowing and the writings of St. Teresa of Avila and St. John of the Cross.

30|$|Briefly {{summarizing}} the points so far, we can {{state that the}} digital conveyance of information undoubtedly offers immense advantages, which everybody recognizes and uses. While for many publishers this area has already grown into an important and profitable field of activity, the substitution of print products by digital products has taken place only to a very small extent so far. Again we observe the phenomenon of media complementarity, where the new medium <b>does</b> <b>not</b> supersede the old one, like the wireless <b>did</b> <b>not</b> <b>replace</b> the concert hall and television <b>did</b> <b>not</b> <b>replace</b> the cinema, but joins the old medium in an often positive and invigorating interaction.|$|R
