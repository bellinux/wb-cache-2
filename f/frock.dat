5|$|The use of wool in {{the uniform}} {{meant that the}} uniforms were not suited to the warm climates that were common in the South. This contributed to many Confederate {{soldiers}} suffering from heatstroke on long marches. However, one understanding of the heavy woolen garments is that after the marching during the day time, when the soldiers would rest at night and cool themselves down, the thermal-shock could render some men unable to function the next day. As such, the woolen garments would protect the soldiers from this, and keep them able to keep marching {{the next day to}} fulfill their duties. This was also the case with the better equipped U.S. Army. Many Confederate soldiers started the war with <b>frock</b> coats. However, cloth shortages and wartime wear insured that, by 1863, waist-length cadet gray or butternut shell jackets were generally worn by Confederates in the Eastern and Western Theater. Examples of <b>frock</b> coats being worn by enlisted men can be seen in photographs taken after the battles of Gettysburg, (1863), and Spotsylvania, (1864).|$|E
5|$|The Société des Gens des Lettres, a Parisian {{organization}} of writers, planned {{a monument to}} French novelist Honoré de Balzac immediately {{after his death in}} 1850. The society commissioned Rodin to create the memorial in 1891, and Rodin spent years developing the concept for his sculpture. Challenged in finding an appropriate representation of Balzac given the author's rotund physique, Rodin produced many studies: portraits, full-length figures in the nude, wearing a <b>frock</b> coat, or in a robe– a replica of which Rodin had requested. The realized sculpture displays Balzac cloaked in the drapery, looking forcefully into the distance with deeply gouged features. Rodin's intent had been to show Balzac at the moment of conceiving a work– to express courage, labor, and struggle.|$|E

5|$|The uniform {{used by the}} Confederate States Marine Corps resembled that {{prescribed}} for the Confederate Army. However, there is controversy {{about some of the}} exact details of the uniform, since the CSMC was not as large, and many of its records were destroyed. In 1865, right after the war's end, Lloyd J. Beall, commander of the CSMC, had a fire at his home which destroyed most of the CSMC's records. It is clear, however, that the Marines were often equipped out of the stores of whichever garrison was nearest their location. One description has the Marines dressed in <b>frock</b> coats of a particular (and undetermined) shade of gray, and dark blue or black trousers. It appears that Confederate Marines wore forage caps although it is unclear if there was any ornamentation on the cover. Much of the gear worn by the CSMC was imported from Russia, and from Great Britain and its empire, mainly Canada. This created a fairly unusual look.|$|E
5|$|Depp {{collaborated with}} costume {{designer}} Penny Rose on his character's appearance, handpicking a tricorne as Sparrow's signature leather hat; to make Sparrow's unique, {{the other characters}} did not wear leather hats. A rubber version {{was used for the}} scene in Dead Man's Chest when the hat floats on water. Depp liked to stick to one costume, wearing one lightweight silk tweed <b>frock</b> coat throughout the series, and he had to be coaxed out of wearing his boots for a version without a sole or heel in beach scenes. The official line is that none of the costumes from The Curse of the Black Pearl survived, which allowed the opportunity to create tougher linen shirts for stunts. However, one remains which has been displayed in an exhibition of screen costumes in Worcester, England. It was a nightmare for Rose to track down the same makers of Sparrow's sash in Turkey. Rose did not want to silkscreen it, as the homewoven piece had the correct worn feel. Sparrow wears an additional belt in the sequels, because Depp liked a new buckle which did not fit with the original piece.|$|E
5|$|The prince found {{fulfillment}} {{in activities}} that required physical skills, {{rather than in the}} classroom. At his father's Santa Cruz farm, Pedro trained unbroken horses, and became a fine horseman and an excellent farrier. He and his brother Miguel enjoyed mounted hunts over unfamiliar ground, through forests, and even at night or in inclement weather. He displayed a talent for drawing and handicrafts, applying himself to wood carving and furniture making. In addition, he had a taste for music, and under the guidance of Marcos Portugal the prince became an able composer. He had a good singing voice, and was proficient with several musical instruments (including piano, flute and guitar), playing popular songs and dances. Pedro was a simple man, both in habits and in dealing with others. Except on solemn occasions when he donned court dress, his daily attire consisted of white cotton trousers, striped cotton jacket and a broad-brimmed straw hat, or a <b>frock</b> coat and a top hat in more formal situations. He would frequently take time to engage in conversation with people on the street, noting their concerns.|$|E

50|$|<b>Frocking</b> {{occurs on}} rare {{occasions}} when officers are selected for promotion to a higher rank, but have yet to reach the effective date of promotion. For <b>frocking</b> {{to occur in the}} Air Force, an unusual set of circumstances must be present to justify wearing the higher rank before the promotion becomes effective. For example, in 2005, two U.S. Air Force lieutenant colonels selected for promotion to Colonel were brevetted (<b>frocked)</b> Colonel about six months ahead of their effective dates of promotion because of the high-profile nature of the duties that they were performing.|$|R
5|$|The White House's {{most famous}} alleged {{apparition}} {{is that of}} Abraham Lincoln. Eleanor Roosevelt never admitted to having seen Lincoln's ghost, but did say that she felt his presence repeatedly throughout the White House. Mrs. Roosevelt {{also said that the}} family dog, Fala, would sometimes bark for no reason at what she felt was Lincoln's ghost. President Dwight Eisenhower's press secretary, James Hagerty, and Liz Carpenter, press secretary to First Lady Lady Bird Johnson, both said they felt Lincoln's presence many times. The former president's footsteps are also said to be heard in the hall outside the Lincoln Bedroom. As reputable an eyewitness as Lillian Rogers Parks admitted in her autobiography My Thirty Years Backstairs at the White House that she had heard them. Margaret Truman, daughter of President Harry S. Truman, said she heard a specter rapping {{at the door of the}} Lincoln Bedroom when she stayed there, and believed it was Lincoln. President Truman himself was once wakened by raps at the door while spending a night in the Lincoln Bedroom. Others have actually seen an apparition of the former president. The first person reported to have actually seen Lincoln's spirit was First Lady Grace Coolidge, who said she saw the ghost of Lincoln standing at a window in the Yellow Oval Room staring out at the Potomac. Winston Churchill, Theodore Roosevelt, and Maureen Reagan and her husband have all claimed to have seen a spectral Lincoln in the White House. A number of staff members of the Franklin D. Roosevelt administration claimed to have seen Lincoln's spirit, and on one occasion Roosevelt's personal valet ran screaming from the White House claiming he had seen Lincoln's ghost. Perhaps the most famous incident was in 1942 when Queen Wilhelmina of The Netherlands heard footsteps outside her White House bedroom and answered a knock on the door, only to see Lincoln in <b>frock</b> coat and top hat standing in front of her (she promptly fainted). Several unnamed eyewitnesses have claimed to have seen the shade of Abraham Lincoln actually lying down on the bed in the Lincoln Bedroom (which was used as a meeting room at the time of his administration), and others have seen Lincoln sit on the edge of the bed and put his boots on. The most famous eyewitness to the latter was Mary Eben, Eleanor Roosevelt's secretary, who saw Lincoln pulling on his boots (after which she ran screaming from the room).|$|E
25|$|Before the <b>frock</b> coat existed, {{there was}} another garment called the <b>frock</b> in the 18th century, which was {{probably}} unrelated to the <b>frock</b> coat, sharing only a similarity in name. The earlier <b>frock</b> was originally country clothing that became increasingly common around 1730. Formal dress was then so elaborate that it was impractical for everyday wear, so the <b>frock</b> became fashionable as half dress, a less formal alternative. By the 1780s the <b>frock</b> was worn widely as town wear, and, {{towards the end of}} the 18th century, started to be made with a single-breasted cut away front and tails. It was thus the precursor to the modern dress coat worn with white tie.|$|E
25|$|Most Hasidim wear long coats called rekelekh {{during the}} week, {{which are often}} mistaken for <b>frock</b> coats but are really very long suit jackets. On Shabbat, Hasidim wear bekishes, which are usually silk or {{polyester}} {{as opposed to the}} woollen <b>frock</b> coat. The bekishe and the rekel both lack the waist seam construction of the <b>frock</b> coat. Additionally, bekishes can be distinguished from <b>frock</b> coats by the additional two buttons on front and a lack of a slit in the back.|$|E
5000|$|According {{to current}} Department of Defense policy, {{there is no}} limit {{to the number of}} two-, three-, and four-star generals (or admirals) who may be <b>frocked</b> at any one time. However, the number of <b>frocked</b> brigadier generals or rear admirals (lower half) is restricted. Three- and four-star generals are {{generally}} <b>frocked</b> if headroom is not available to promote them {{at the time of the}} assumption of their new assignment. This is due both to the close relationship between these ranks and the position held, and to the fact that these are considered [...] "positions of importance and responsibility" [...] in accordance with 10 USC § 601. For all other officers <b>frocking</b> is normally reserved for joint, international, or other high-visibility positions that require the higher rank for diplomatic, protocol, or command authority reasons.|$|R

25|$|The morning {{coat was}} {{particularly}} popular amongst fashionable younger men, and the <b>frock</b> coat increasingly {{came to be}} worn mostly by older conservative gentlemen. The morning coat gradually relegated the <b>frock</b> coat to only more formal situations, {{to the point that}} the <b>frock</b> coat eventually came to be worn only as court and diplomatic dress.|$|E
25|$|This {{suggests}} that the earlier <b>frock</b> from the 18th century is more the direct ancestor of the modern dress coat, whereas the <b>frock</b> coat in the 19th century, the subject under discussion here, is a different garment altogether with separate military origins in the 19th century, although a remote historical connection to the <b>frock</b> cannot entirely be excluded.|$|E
25|$|Dress {{coats and}} morning coats, the other main knee-length coats of the period, shared the waist seam of <b>frock</b> coats, making them all body coats, but {{differed}} {{in the cut}} of the skirt, as the <b>frock</b> coat {{does not have the}} cut away front which gives dress coats and morning coats tails at the back. As was usual with all coats in the 19th century, shoulder padding (called 'American shoulders') was rare or minimal. The formal <b>frock</b> coat only buttons down to the waist seam, which is decorated at the back with a pair of buttons. The <b>frock</b> coat that buttoned up to the neck, forming a high, stand-up collar, was worn only by clergymen.|$|E

25|$|In the Lithuanian yeshiva world, many {{prominent}} figures wear a black <b>frock</b> coat {{also known}} as a kapotteh (accompanied by either a Homburg or fedora hat) as formal wear. In recent years many Sefardi rabbis also wear a similar <b>frock</b> coat. The <b>frock</b> coat amongst Jews is usually reserved for a rosh yeshiva, (maybe also the mashgiach and other senior rabbis of the yeshiva) and other rabbis such as important communal rabbis and some chief rabbis.|$|E
25|$|The cut of a <b>frock</b> {{coat with}} a waist seam flatters a man's figure, {{as opposed to}} a sack coat, and such <b>frock</b> coats {{remained}} part of some 20th century military uniforms. They can either be single-breasted as in army uniforms, or double-breasted as in navy uniforms. The British Army currently retains the <b>frock</b> coat for ceremonial wear by senior officers of Lieutenant-General rank and above, by officers of the Household Division, by some bandmasters and by holders of certain Royal appointments.|$|E
25|$|A {{coat with}} a wide collar called a <b>frock</b> coat, derived from a {{traditional}} working-class coat, was worn for hunting and other country pursuits in both Britain and America. Although originally designed as sporting wear, <b>frock</b> coats gradually came into fashion as everyday wear. The <b>frock</b> coat was cut with a turned down collar, reduced side pleats, and small, round cuffs, sometimes cut with a slit to allow for added movement. Sober, natural colors were worn, and coats were made from woolen cloth, or a wool and silk mix.|$|E
50|$|The {{practice}} of brevetting {{disappeared from the}} (regular) U.S. military {{at the end of}} the 19th century; honors were bestowed instead with a series of medals. Brevetting was declared obsolete in 1922. However, the similar {{practice of}} <b>frocking</b> continues in four of the five branches of the U.S. armed forces. The U.S. Air Force does not allow the regular practice of <b>frocking</b> before a promotion date, except in rare circumstances, such as when an officer selected for promotion is assigned to a billet (typically a senior joint duty assignment), that requires him or her to hold/wear the higher rank to which he/she is expected to be promoted. <b>Frocking</b> typically requires special approval to be obtained from the service headquarters.|$|R

25|$|Standard fibres {{used for}} the <b>frock</b> coat {{included}} wool and vicuña. The most common weave was known as broadcloth. The standard colour of a <b>frock</b> coat was solid black, but later, in the Victorian era, charcoal grey became an acceptable but less common alternative and Midnight Blue was an even rarer alternative colour. For business and festive occasions the revers was lined with black silk facings (either satin or grosgrain). For funerals black <b>frock</b> coats without self-faced revers were worn with a matching black waistcoat.|$|E
25|$|Another {{characteristic}} of <b>frock</b> coats was {{their lack of}} any outer pockets. Only late in the Victorian and Edwardian era were they ever made with a chest pocket to sport a pocket square, a feature more typical of the modern lounge suit. Oscar Wilde, a famous dandy of his time, was often seen in portraits wearing just such a model, but this was rather rare on <b>frock</b> coats; while {{in keeping with the}} flamboyant nature of Wilde's dress, it was frowned upon by traditionalists. Side pockets were always absent from <b>frock</b> coats, but pockets were provided {{on the inside of the}} chest.|$|E
