25|$|In 2007, {{researchers}} from the Max Planck Institute for Evolutionary Anthropology succeeded in extracting DNA from two fossil hominin fragments from Okladnikov Cave: the humeral <b>diaphysis</b> of a juvenile and a separate femur fragment. mtDNA sequencing confirmed that both fragments most likely belonged the same individual, dubbed Okladnikov 2. The mtDNA sequences of the HVR I (hypervariable region I) from Okladnikov 2 confirmed that the individual was Neanderthal. On the basis of mtDNA analysis, Okladnikov 2 {{was found to be}} more related to European and western Asian Neanderthals. A 2014 re-analysis teasing out ancient DNA from contaminated sequences allowed researchers to complete the mtDNA sequence from Okladnikov 2. The completed sequence shows that the Okladnikov 2 mtDNA is basal to that sequenced from Mezmaiskaya 1 from Mezmaiskaya Cave and is even closer to western Neanderthals than previously thought.|$|E
25|$|In large studies, women taking bisphosphonates for {{osteoporosis}} {{have had}} unusual fractures ("bisphosphonate fractures") in the femur (thigh bone) in the shaft (<b>diaphysis</b> or sub-trochanteric region) of the bone, {{rather than at}} the femoral neck, which is the most common site of fracture. However, these unusual fractures are extremely rare (12 in 14,195 women) compared to the common hip fractures (272 in 14,195 women), and the overall reduction in hip fractures caused by bisphosphonate far outweighed the unusual shaft fractures. There are concerns that long-term bisphosphonate use can result in over-suppression of bone turnover. It is hypothesized that micro-cracks in the bone are unable to heal and eventually unite and propagate, resulting in atypical fractures. Such fractures tend to heal poorly and often require some form of bone stimulation, for example bone grafting as a secondary procedure. This complication is not common, and the benefit of overall fracture reduction still holds. In cases where there is concern of such fractures occurring, teriparatide is potentially a good alternative because it does not cause as much damage as a bisphosphonate does by suppressing bone turnover.|$|E
2500|$|Endochondral {{ossification}} {{begins with}} {{points in the}} cartilage called [...] "primary ossification centers." [...] They mostly appear during fetal development, though a few short bones begin their primary ossification after birth. [...] They {{are responsible for the}} formation of the diaphyses of long bones, short bones and certain parts of irregular bones. [...] Secondary ossification occurs after birth, and forms the epiphyses of long bones and the extremities of irregular and flat bones. [...] The <b>diaphysis</b> and both epiphyses of a long bone are separated by a growing zone of cartilage (the epiphyseal plate). At skeletal maturity (18 to 25 years of age), all of the cartilage is replaced by bone, fusing the <b>diaphysis</b> and both epiphyses together (epiphyseal closure). In the upper limbs, only the diaphyses of the long bones and scapula are ossified. [...] The epiphyses, carpal bones, coracoid process, medial border of the scapula, and acromion are still cartilaginous.|$|E
2500|$|Long {{bones are}} {{characterized}} by a shaft, the <b>diaphysis,</b> that is much longer than its width; and by an epiphysis, a rounded head {{at each end of}} the shaft. They are made up mostly of compact bone, with lesser amounts of marrow, located within the medullary cavity, and areas of spongy, cancellous bone at the ends of the bones. [...] Most bones of the limbs, including those of the fingers and toes, are long bones. The exceptions are the eight carpal bones of the wrist, the seven articulating tarsal bones of the ankle and the sesamoid bone of the kneecap. Long bones such as the clavicle, that have a differently shaped shaft or ends are also called modified long bones.|$|E

Sagol from high-grade hanu beef, with dense ivory and white bone cross-section are typically preferred. A sagol consists of one <b>diaphysis</b> part and two epiphysis parts. The Epiphysis parts have an outer layer of compact bone, and spongy substance inside. The <b>Diaphysis</b> part has periostea outside, and marrow inside.|$|E

5000|$|In adults, X-rays {{may reveal}} {{bilateral}} femoral pseudofractures in the lateral [...] <b>diaphysis.</b> These pseudofractures may remain for years, {{but they may}} not heal until they break completely or the patient receives intramedullary fixation.

50|$|The {{growth in}} {{diameter}} of bones around the <b>diaphysis</b> occurs by deposition of bone beneath the periosteum.

50|$|A {{patient with}} a Jones {{fracture}} may not realize that a fracture has occurred. Diagnosis includes the palpation of an intact peroneus brevis tendon, and demonstration of local tenderness distal to the tuberosity of the fifth metatarsal, and localized over the <b>diaphysis</b> of the proximal metatarsal. Bony crepitus is unusual.|$|E
50|$|Radiographs {{initially}} show {{layers of}} periosteal {{new bone formation}} with cortical thickening. Periosteal new bone may cover the <b>diaphysis</b> of the bone, causing an increase in diameter of the bone. Over time, the periosteal new bone density increases, becoming homogenous with the underlying cortex. Eventually the bone remodels and resumes a normal appearance.|$|E
50|$|During childhood, {{the growth}} plate {{contains}} the connecting cartilage enabling the bone to grow; at adulthood (between {{the ages of}} 18 to 25 years), {{the components of the}} growth plate stop growing altogether and completely ossify into solid bone.

50|$|It {{is still}} not very clear why people with Apert Syndrome have both {{craniosynostosis}} and syndactyly. There has been one study that suggests {{it has something to}} do with the expression of three isoforms of FGFR2, the gene with the point mutations that causes the syndrome in 98% of the patients.KGFR, keratinocyte growth factor receptor, is an isoform active in the metaphysis and interphalangeal joints. FGFR1 is an isoform active in the <b>diaphysis.</b> FGFR2-Bek is active in the metaphysis, as well as the <b>diaphysis,</b> but also in the interdigital mesenchyme. The point mutation increases the ligand-dependent activation of FGFR2, and thus of its isoforms. This means that FGFR2 loses its specificity, causing binding of FGFs that normally do not bind to the receptor. Since FGF suppresses apoptosis, the interdigital mesenchyme is maintained. FGF also increases replication and differentiation of osteoblasts, thus early fusion of several sutures of the skull. This may explain why both symptoms are always found in Apert Syndrome.|$|E
