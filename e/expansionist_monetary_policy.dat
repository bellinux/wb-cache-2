During his term as finance secretary, he implemented far-reaching reforms of Brazil's financial regime, instituting a vigorously <b>expansionist</b> <b>monetary</b> <b>policy.</b> The result was chaos and instability: the so-called fiat experiment resulted in the bubble of encilhamento, a dismal politic-economic failure. Due to his controversial role during it, in the following administration of Floriano Peixoto, he was forced into exile until Floriano's term ended. Years later, after his return he was elected as a Senator. He headed the Brazilian delegation to the 2nd Hague Conference and was brilliant in its deliberations. As candidate of the Civilian Party in the presidential election of 1910, Barbosa waged {{one of the most memorable}} campaigns in Brazilian politics. He was not successful and lost to Marshal Hermes da Fonseca. He ran again in the elections of 1914 and 1919, both times losing to the government candidate.|$|E

The US monetary system is broken, and the public purposes for which it is supposed to exist are being thwarted. US banks and other financial institutions blew up a vast speculative bubble of financial products leading up to the crash in 2008. The deeply undemocratic process in the US monetary system is still directly supervised by the Federal Reserve. The US system, a quasi-independent and weakly accountable central bank is supposed to be responsible for all aspects of monetary policy.

40|$|Why, at {{the onset}} of a {{downturn}} in economic activity and an upswing in unemployment (in the early 2000 ’s), did the leading trade unions in Germany decide to demand-and in some cases strike for- larger wage increases and denounce a government-led policy of wage moderation, rather than strengthen their adherence to such a policy? Two (related) explanations of this apparently nonrational behavior were offered by German unionists at an informal conference on union policy-making in Germany, Japan, and the U. S. In the first place, it was claimed that at the grass roots union members might be expected to accept wage restraint only if they are convinced that they would be punished for failure to do so (e. g. to accept subcontract wages in marginal enterprises) or if acceptance would be virtually certain to ensure reward in the form of increased job security and employment (e. g. by the adoption of more <b>expansionist</b> fiscal or <b>monetary</b> <b>policies).</b> And second, some of the union participants at the conference claimed that the failure of real wages to grow as rapidly as productivity tends to engender feelings of unfair on inequitable treatment among unionists, which, if allowed to persist, could override the requirements of rational self-interest in pursuing wage policies aimed solely at maximizing the net wealth of the membership...|$|R

The US economy and currency problems seemed to be ignored by the bond markets. The Dollar's resilience has been questioned {{at least three times}} in the post-war era - in the 1960 s as gold reserves ran short, amid Japan's rise in the 1980 s, and during the emergence of the Euro in the late 1990 s. The Dollar has always rebounded in a reflection of US economic prowess, unrivalled liquidity and stability of US financial markets and scale benefits of the Dollar in global transactions. The soaring US debt now risks undermining the Dollar and America's enjoyment of its exorbitant privilege, jeopardising the global economy. The US Federal government has taken on massive additional contingent liabilities through its bail out of the US financial system. There is little doubt that the Federal authorities will choose the inflation and currency depreciation route over the default route. China has been implementing a diversification and risk minimizing strategy by purchasing other assets such as gold and more recently further purchases of Eurozone bonds.

40|$|A {{literatura}} econômica hetorodoxa, mais precisamente a corrente kaldoriana, atribui ao setor industrial um papel estratégico no crescimento das economias. E, diante da importância da indústria para a dinâmica econômica, as discussões sobre o possível processo de desindustrialização da economia brasileira despertou a necessidade de realização de estudos a fim de se identificar os efeitos da redução de participação do setor industrial na produção do país. A apreciação da taxa real de câmbio é apontada como responsável pela redução da competitividade externa das manufaturas brasileiras e, esta apreciação cambial, estaria ocorrendo em função dos diferenciais entre as taxas de juros doméstica e internacional. Dado esse contexto, o objetivo deste estudo é avaliar os impactos de mudanças na política monetária e cambial e de alterações na composição da pauta de exportações sobre o desempenho da economia, utilizando um modelo de equilíbrio geral com fechamento kaleckiano-estruturalista. A estruturação do modelo analítico inclui a determinação do produto pelo enfoque da demanda agregada, os setores atuam abaixo da plena capacidade, com preços e quantidades endógenas e os investimentos são determinados por uma equação independente do nível de poupança. Além disso, tal abordagem permite utilizar variáveis nominais, o que viabiliza a análise da interação entre o lado real e financeiro da economia. Formalmente, seguem-se os princípios dos modelos de consistência de estoque e fluxos. Os dados foram calibrados para 2003 e o modelo tem capacidade de redizer os efeitos de políticas econômicas em um intervalo de até cinco períodos. Os resultados simulados, quando comparados com os dados observados na economia brasileira, indicam um bom ajustamento do modelo, o que permite, assim, o seu uso na análise dos cenários de política monetária (expansionista), política cambial (depreciação do câmbio real) e de alterações exógenas na pauta de exportações. Quando simulado uma política monetária expansionista observa-se uma depreciação da taxa real de câmbio, como predito pela literatura. As exportações, em especial de bens manufaturados, respondem ao aumento da competitividade, incentivando os investimentos e gerando aumento na renda. Impactos positivos sobre os agregados econômicos são observados também em um cenário de taxa de câmbio depreciada. O melhor desempenho do setor externo implica em elevação dos investimentos produtivos, em especial nos segmentos industriais, o que agrega ao país os ganhos decorrentes da diversificação da estrutura produtiva. Ressalta-se que a ampliação da produção nos setores industriais minimiza os efeitos e retardam a instauração do processo de desindustrialização na economia brasileira. Todavia, a análise de redução da participação dos bens manufaturados na pauta de exportações reforça os efeitos contracionistas obtidos em um ambiente de juros nominais elevados e consequente apreciação cambial. A perda de competitividade dos bens manufaturados no cenário internacional se reflete de forma negativa sobre o produto, a renda e os níveis de investimentos. Os resultados obtidos reforçam a importância do setor de manufaturas para o crescimento econômico, principalmente em um ambiente de taxa de câmbio competitiva. The heterodox economic literature, {{more specifically}} the kaldorian stream, attributes {{to the industrial}} sector a strategic role in the growing of economies. And, face the importance of industry to the economic dynamics, the discussions about the possible process of de- industrialization of Brazilian economy had arisen the necessity for carrying out studies to identify the effects in {{the reduction of the}} industrial sector participation in the country production. The appreciation of the real exchange rate is pointed as responsible for the reduction in the external competitiveness of Brazilian manufactures and, this exchange appreciation would be happening due to differentials between domestic and international interest rates. Within this context, the objective {{of this study is to}} assess the changing impacts in the monetary and exchange policy and the alterations in the composition of the export agenda on the economy performance, making use of a general equilibrium model with kaleckian-structuralist closure. The structuring of the analytical model includes the product determination by the focus on the aggregate demand, the sectors functioning under full capacity, with endogenous prices and quantities and the investments which are determined by an independent equation of the saving level. Besides that, this approach allows the use of nominal variables, which enables the analysis of the interaction between the economy real and financial sides. Formally, the principles of stock and flow consistency models are followed. Data were calibrated for the year 2003 and the model has the capacity of predicting the effects of economic policies in an interval of up to five periods. The simulated results when compared to data observed in Brazilian economy indicate a good adjustment of the model, which allows its use for the analysis of scenarios of monetary policy (expansionist), exchange policy (depreciation of real exchange), and exogenous alterations in the export agenda. When an <b>expansionist</b> <b>monetary</b> <b>policy</b> is simulated one can notice a depreciation of the real exchange rate as predicted in the literature. Exports, manufactured goods in special, answered to the growing of competitiveness, boosting investments and generating an income increase. Positive impacts over the economic aggregates are observed also in a depreciated exchange rate scenario. The best performance of the external sector implies the increase of productive investments, especially in the industrial segments, which aggregates gains to the country due to the diversification in the productive structure. It must be emphasized that the production growth in the industrial sectors reduces the effects and retards the beginning of the de-industrialization process in Brazilian economy. However, the analysis of the manufactured goods participation reduction in the export agenda reinforces the contractionist effects obtained in an environment of high nominal investments and resulting exchange appreciation. The loss of manufactured good competitiveness in the international scenario has negative impacts on the product, income, and investment levels. The results reinforce the importance of the manufacture sector to economic growth, mainly in a competitive exchange rate environment...|$|E

It describes a simple structural model, {{along the lines}} of those in use in a number of central banks. This workhorse model consists of an aggregate demand (or IS) curve, a price-setting (or Phillips) curve, a version of the uncovered interest parity condition, and a <b>monetary</b> <b>policy</b> reaction function. The paper discusses how to parameterize the model and use it for forecasting and policy analysis, illustrating with an application to Canada. It also introduces a set of useful software tools for conducting a model-consistent forecast.

We employ the Swiss Economic Institute’s <b>Monetary</b> <b>Policy</b> Communicator to measure the future stance of the European Central Bank’s <b>monetary</b> <b>policy.</b> Our results indicate, first, that communication has an influence on inflation (expectations) similar to that of actual target rate changes.

Consequently, future work on <b>monetary</b> <b>policy</b> transmission should incorporate both a short-term interest rate and a communication indicator. A second finding is that the <b>monetary</b> <b>policy</b> transmission mechanism changed during the financial crisis as the overall effect of <b>monetary</b> <b>policy</b> on (expected) inflation and output is weaker and of shorter duration during this period compared to the overall sample period.

40|$|In a {{first attempt}} to treat {{inflation}} targeting (IT) as a continuous variable, we construct IT subindices for 21 full-fledged ITers on three dimensions: flexibility, transparency, and explicitness. Comparing flexibility and transparency we find that (1) the impact of flexibility on both the mean and variation of inflation is more quadratic than that of transparency; (2) after adding the transparency index, the impact of flexibility is no longer significant. The significant and negative association between transparency and the level and variation of inflation is confirmed when we check for robustness by controlling for disinflation stage, subsampling, instrumental variable estimation, and principal component analysis (PCA).
