40|$|In recent years, {{healthy diet}} is gaining {{increased}} {{importance in the}} face of rampant Non-communicable diseases (NCDs) scenario India is reverberating with. Polyphenols, forming largest category of phytochemicals, are gaining unprecedented interest as ‘life span essentials’ in scientific settings. They are ubiquitous plant secondary metabolites, structurally diversified group ranging from simple phenols i. e. phenolic acids to complex phenols i. e. condensed tannins. Their antioxidant mechanisms: both direct (free radical scavenging, metal chelation) and indirect (cell signal modulation, phytochemical hormetic pathways) have been well-corroborated to attenuate oxidative stress and eventually culminates in health promotion and decreased incidence of NCDs. In this line, recommended dietary allowance has not been set precisely yet and in <b>general,</b> <b>calls</b> for increased <b>frequency</b> of their consumption from varied plant sources (fruits, vegetables, whole cereals, pulses, nuts) on a long term basis to reap its benefits...|$|R
40|$|Being able {{to infer}} one way direct {{connections}} in an oscillatory network {{such as the}} suprachiastmatic nucleus (SCN) of the mammalian brain using time series data is difficult but crucial to understanding network dynamics. Although techniques {{have been developed for}} inferring networks from time series data, there have been no attempts to adapt these techniques to infer directional connections in oscillatory time series, while accurately distinguishing between direct and indirect connections. In this paper an adaptation of Granger Causality is proposed that allows for inference of circadian networks and oscillatory networks in <b>general</b> <b>called</b> Adaptive <b>Frequency</b> Granger Causality (AFGC). Additionally, an extension of this method is proposed to infer networks with large numbers of cells called LASSO AFGC. The method was validated using simulated data from several different networks. For the smaller networks the method was able to identify all one way direct connections without identifying connections that were not present. For larger networks of up to twenty cells the method shows excellent performance in identifying true and false connections; this is quantified by an area-under-the-curve (AUC) 96. 88 %. We note that this method like other Granger Causality-based methods, is based on the detection of high frequency signals propagating between cell traces. Thus it requires a relatively high sampling rate and a network that can propagate high frequency signals...|$|R
30|$|Here, we {{conclude}} that both the Sundaic and Indochinese forms are recognized and supported by morphological and genetic data, but share similar <b>call</b> <b>frequencies</b> in provinces {{to the north of}} the Isthmus of Kra.

50|$|A {{behavioral}} {{study conducted}} by Puechmaille et. al.

In the experiment, larger males proved to have higher <b>call</b> <b>frequencies</b> that attracted females twice as often as males with lower <b>call</b> <b>frequencies.</b> In contrast, males appeared to choose females at random. This distinction suggests that females choose males based on their <b>call</b> <b>frequency</b> for the indirect benefits of having healthier and fitter offspring. The mating system is therefore comparable to a lek, making female mate choice a selection factor {{in the evolution of}} <b>call</b> <b>frequency</b> in males that may counter other selection pressures imposed by their ecological niche.|$|R

40|$|Many species possess {{multiple}} sexually dimorphic traits, which incorporate different sensory modalities (e. g., acoustic, olfactory and visual), {{although their}} relative roles in sexual selection and in determining reproductive success are still poorly understood for most taxa. We assessed {{the role of}} multiple male traits, including one acoustic (dominant <b>call</b> <b>frequency)</b> and one visual (yellow throat patch) trait, in residency advertisement, contest behavior, and breeding success in barking geckos (Ptenopus garrulus garrulus). We show that male barking geckos maintain largely exclusive home ranges, with a trend for larger males to maintain larger home ranges. We also show that larger males have a lower dominant <b>calling</b> <b>frequency.</b> When aggressive behavior was elicited in the field using a recorded <b>call</b> of average <b>frequency,</b> resident males with low <b>frequency</b> <b>calls</b> {{were more likely to}} respond aggressively and charge the speaker compared to males with high <b>frequency</b> <b>calls.</b> However, body size and small relative throat patch size, rather than <b>call</b> <b>frequency,</b> were the best predictors of overall aggressiveness.

30|$|The {{degree of}} {{morphological}} variation in R. affinis is {{highlighted by the}} morphology of the as yet undesignated form B from Nghe An province, northern Vietnam, and eastern Shan, Myanmar. No <b>call</b> <b>frequencies</b> or genetic data were available; however morphologically, this population had the smallest cranial and nose leaf morphology of all the material examined. Based on our findings relating to relationships between size and <b>call</b> <b>frequency,</b> this population possibly emits a <b>call</b> <b>frequency</b> higher than 80 kHz. By comparison, this form agrees closely with individuals from Mussoorie, northern India, albeit smaller overall. This suggests that R. a. himalayanus (or its immediate descendants) may have spread southward to northern Vietnam. In Vietnam, specimens were captured in Nghe An province where R. a. macrurus (form C) was also found. In Myanmar, the specimen was from Shan where many R. a. macrurus were also captured. Based on sympatric speciation, two morphologically different populations with sympatric distributions are considered to represent distinct species. Based on current knowledge, we suspect the clade IIIc (Figure  7) represents form B. This is likely, because (1) this population has cranial and nose leaf characteristics which produce the highest <b>call</b> <b>frequency,</b> (2) in the north, the highest <b>call</b> <b>frequency</b> populations are found in upper south China, and (3) clade IIIc comprises only sequences from the northern Vietnam and upper southern China where R. a. himalayanus was recorded.

In Ranong, both high and low frequencies were recorded. However, the high frequencies recorded from north of the Isthmus of Kra (Ranong, Prachuap Kiri Khan and Phetchaburi) were not supported by morphology and genetic data as belonging to the Indochinese subregion but grouped with material from the Sundaic subregion. This highlights the general need for examination of morphological and genetic data in tandem with echolocation call data.|$|R
50|$|There are two {{processes}} that are commonly used to achieve the conversion: second harmonic generation (SHG, also <b>called</b> <b>frequency</b> doubling), or sum frequency generation which sums two non-similar frequencies.

Agreement between self-reported and operator-derived mobile <b>call</b> <b>frequency</b> and duration for a 3 -month period was assessed using Cohen's weighted Kappa (κ). Sensitivity and specificity of both self-reported high (≥ 10 calls/day or ≥ 4 h/week) and low (≤ 6 calls/week or < 30 min/week) mobile phone use were calculated, as compared to operator data. For users of one mobile phone, agreement was fair for <b>call</b> <b>frequency</b> (κ= 0. 35, 95 % CI: 0. 35, 0. 36) and moderate for call duration (κ= 0. 50, 95 % CI: 0. 49, 0. 50). Self-reported low <b>call</b> <b>frequency</b> and duration demonstrated high sensitivity (87 % and 76 % respectively), but for high <b>call</b> <b>frequency</b> and duration sensitivity was lower (38 % and 56 % respectively), reflecting a tendency for greater underestimation than overestimation.

This study highlights the ongoing value of using self-report data to measure mobile phone use. Furthermore, compared to continuous scale estimates used by previous studies, categorical response options used in COSMOS appear to improve validity considerably, most likely by preventing unrealistically high estimates from being reported...|$|R
40|$|The {{origin and}} meaning of {{echolocation}} <b>call</b> <b>frequency</b> variation within rhinolophid bats is not well understood despite {{an increasing number of}} allopatric and sympatric examples being documented. A bimodal distribution of mean regional <b>call</b> <b>frequency</b> within the Okinawa-jima Island population of Rhinolophus cornutus pumilus (Rhinolophidae) provided a unique opportunity to investigate geographic <b>call</b> <b>frequency</b> variation early in its development. Individual resting echolocation frequencies, partial mitochondrial DNA D-loop sequences and genotypes from six microsatellite loci were obtained from 288 individuals in 11 colonies across {{the entire length of the}} island, and nearby Kume-jima Island. Acoustic differences (5 – 8 kHz) observed between the north and south regions have been maintained despite evidence of sufficient nuclear gene flow across the middle of the island. Significant subdivision of maternally inherited D-loop haplotypes suggested a limitation of movement of females between regions, but not within the regions, and was evidence of female philopatry. These results support a 'maternal transmission' hypothesis whereby the difference in the constant frequency (CF) component between the regions is maintained by mother–offspring transmission of CF, the restricted dispersal of females between regions and small effective population size. We suggest that the mean 5 – 8 kHz <b>call</b> <b>frequency</b> difference between the regions might develop through random cultural drift. Yoshino Hajime, Armstrong Kyle N.

40|$|Geographic {{variation}} can be {{an indicator}} of still poorly understood evolutionary processes such as adaptation and drift. Sensory systems used in communication {{play a key role}} in mate choice and species recognition. Habitat-mediated (i. e. adaptive) differences in communication signals may therefore lead to diversification. We investigated geographic variation in echolocation calls of African horseshoe bats, Rhinolophus simulator and R. swinnyi in the context of two adaptive hypotheses: 1) James' Rule and 2) the Sensory Drive Hypothesis. According to James' Rule body-size should vary in response to relative humidity and temperature so that divergence in <b>call</b> <b>frequency</b> may therefore be the result of climate-mediated variation in body size because of the correlation between body size and <b>call</b> <b>frequency.</b> The Sensory Drive Hypothesis proposes that <b>call</b> <b>frequency</b> is a response to climate-induced differences in atmospheric attenuation and predicts that increases in atmospheric attenuation selects for <b>calls</b> of lower <b>frequency.</b> We measured the morphology and resting <b>call</b> <b>frequency</b> (RF) of 111 R. simulator and 126 R. swinnyi individuals across their distributional range to test the above hypotheses. Contrary to the prediction of James' Rule, divergence in body size could not explain the variation in RF. Instead, acoustic divergence in RF was best predicted by latitude, geography and climate-induced differences in atmospheric attenuation, as predicted by the Sensory Drive Hypothesis. Although variation in RF was strongly influenced by temperature and humidity, other climatic variables (associated with latitude and altitude) as well as drift (as suggested by a positive correlation between call variation and geographic distance, especially in R. simulator) may also play an important role...|$|R

40|$|The {{origin and}} {{maintenance}} of intraspecific variation in vocal signals is important for population divergence and speciation. Where vocalizations are transmitted by vertical cultural inheritance, similarity will reflect co-ancestry, and thus vocal divergence should reflect genetic structure. Horseshoe bats are characterized by echolocation calls dominated by a constant frequency component that is partly determined by maternal imprinting. Although previous studies showed that constant <b>frequency</b> <b>calls</b> are also influenced by some non-genetic factors, {{it is not known}} how frequency relates to genetic structure. To test this, we related constant frequency variation to genetic and non-genetic variables in the Formosan lesser horseshoe bat (Rhinolophus monoceros).
