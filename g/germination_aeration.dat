40|$|Dried pollen {{grains of}} three date palm (male) cultivars grown in Oman were stored {{either in a}} freezer (- 18 °C), a {{refrigerator}} (4 to 5 °C), {{or at room temperature}} (23 to 25 °C) for 6 or 12 months. The three cultivars include Khori, Medjahdil, and Bahlani. Germination percentage was determined after 6 hours incubation in aerated and non- aerated liquid media. The results showed that date palm pollen was better adapted to refrigerator storage than freezing for all three cultivars, while room temperature storage significantly reduced pollen <b>germination.</b> <b>Aeration</b> was found to enhance germination of refrigerator- and freezer-stored pollen, but decreased that of pollen stored at room temperature for 6 months. The results also indicated that refrigeration might have caused the inactivation of pollen germination. The latter could either be overcome by aeration or reversed if pollen is refrigerated for a longer period. Room temperature storage directly reduced viability and did not induce temporary inactivation of pollen...|$|E
40|$|A {{study was}} carried out under {{greenhouse}} conditions to establish the role of substrate physical and chemical properties. Pine bark and coal rubble were mixed at 100, 75, 50, 25, and 0 % by volume. A farmers’ standard practice (50 % pine bark + 50 % sand) was included as a control. The experiment {{was made up of}} three blocks and six treatments arranged in a randomized complete block design. The particle density of the substrates in this study was virtually the same. The bulk density, total porosity, and aeration porosity, however, were highest with 100 % coal rubble and decreased with decreasing coal rubble proportion while water holding porosity increased with decreasing coal proportion. Germination decreased with increasing coal rubble at 14 to 28 and at 35 days after sowing (DAS). A mix of between 0 to 50 % coal rubble with pine bark seemed ideal for <b>germination.</b> <b>Aeration</b> porosity, total porosity, and bulk density were negatively correlated to germination (14 to 28 DAS) while water holding porosity was positively correlated. Overall, the best germination was for 0 to 50 % coal rubble with subsequent bulky density of 0. 46 to 0. 83, total porosity 71 to 63 %, aeration porosity 21 to 35 % and water holding porosity 49 to 31 % respectively. However, the measured total porosity and water holding porosity of the standard substrate (50 %S 0 %CR 50 %PB) used normally by farmers were below the expected range, while the aeration porosity was on the low end. This makes this mix prone to aeration problems. The pH of the float water decreased with increase in time from sowing and proportion of coal in the mix while EC was not affected...|$|E
40|$|Germination of glycerol-prepared microcysts of Myxococcus xanthus was studied. The {{sequence}} of morphological events during germination resembled that of germinating fruiting body-microcysts. The turbidity {{drop of a}} culture of germinating microcysts could be described by McCormick's formula derived for germinating Bacillus spores. The rate of uptake of labeled glycine and acetate did not change during <b>germination.</b> Temperature, <b>aeration,</b> and pH optima for germination {{were the same as}} for vegetative cell growth. Germination was induced by protein hydrolysates and the individual amino acids glycine, alanine, valine, aspartic acid, and glutamic acid. A number of organic compounds, including sugars, alcohols, aldehydes, ketones, organic acids, and chelating agents, did not induce germination. The inorganic ions HPO 42 −, Mg++, Ca++, and NH 4 + induced germination, although ionic strength was not a factor. Microcysts incubated in distilled water at concentrations greater than about 109 cells/ml germinated; supernatant fluid from such suspensions (germination factor) induced germination of less concentrated suspensions. The activity of germination factor was resistant to boiling, but was lost on charring and dialysis. Germination of microcysts and growth of vegetative cells was equally sensitive to a variety of metabolic inhibitors, including penicillin and chloramphenicol. Germination was more resistant than vegetative growth to inhibition by antibiotics of the streptomycin family and by actinomycin D...|$|R
40|$|Species which play {{particularly}} {{important roles in}} ecosystem patterns and processes are recognised as keystone species or ecosystem engineers. The conservation of these species is critical {{for the maintenance of}} the ecological role they play in ecosystem function. The aardvark, Orycteropus afer, is known {{to play a role in}} biopedturbation through digging for refuges and for prey, and as a consequence of these digging activities is expected to serve the role of an ecosystem engineer and keystone species. This study aimed to describe and quantify the ecological patterns and processes driven by the aardvark through their digging activities, within the eastern Karoo, and thereby evaluate the significance of aardvarks as ecosystem engineers and keystone species in a semi-arid environment. The landscape pattern (dig abundance and distribution) and soil displacement of aardvark forage and refuge digs in a semi-arid Karoo landscape, as well as the ecological processes (generating fertile, seed retention hotspots) driven by aardvark forage digs was measured. Refuge digs occurred in the highest densities in areas characterised by a specific suite of soil, vegetation and elevation features, while forage digs occurred in high abundance in most habitats measured, and were likely driven by prey availability. Forage digs served as litter and seed retention hotspots, with accelerated decomposition rates of litter as a function of increased soil moisture in digs. The functional processes (i. e. resource capture, shelter for plants and animals, <b>germination</b> sites, soil <b>aeration,</b> organic turnover, mineralization rates, fertile soil displacement and transport) driven by aardvark digs are not restricted to refuge digs. Forage digs occurred in most habitats measured and their functional role is unique and perhaps greater across the landscape in comparison to refuge digs. The aardvark has a disproportionate effect in ecosystems, in terms of its refuge and forage digs relative to its abundance and therefore its role as a keystone species and ecosystem engineer is confirmed. Conservation and protection of this species is therefore essential to maintain its important role in ecosystem function...|$|R
