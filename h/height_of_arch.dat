Due to the increase of the materials cost in the construction, new types of construction methods have been introduced. Permanent formwork is one of the methods that is used to reduce the wastage and construction cost. The advantage of the permanent formwork is where the formwork will {{become a part of the}} structure. This research is to determine the optimal <b>height</b> <b>of</b> <b>arch</b> pan under uniformly distributed load from the slab and to achieve the required load of 100 kg or 1 000 N of concrete arch pan without cracking. The construction process is important in order to produce the standard quality with preferable size of the arch pan formwork. Plastic meshes and plastic netting were laid inside along the length of the concrete arch pan which acts as a flexural reinforcement. Based on the arch pan design calculation, it shows that the maximum height of the arch pan is 75 mm and the required load for the concrete arch pan has successfully passed without cracking.

40|$|Nowadays, {{the methods}} and cost of {{construction}} rapidly change parallel to the current technology development. The application of the permanent formwork will reduce the time consumption {{and the number of}} workers for a certain construction project. This is due to the reduction of working load on site. The advantage of the permanent formwork is where the formwork will {{become a part of the}} structure. Other than that, the replacement of the temporary formwork will reduce the construction waste during construction. The purpose of this research is to identify the materials, to fabricate and also to determine the strength of fibre reinforced arch pan as a permanent formwork. The scopes of this research are focused on the materials and cost of producing the arch pan as permanent formwork for the slabs and also included laboratory testing for the sample to get the strength characteristic of the structure. This research is to determine the optimal strength of arch pan under uniformly distributed load from the slab and to achieve the required load of 100 kg or 1000 N of concrete arch pan without cracking.

40|$|BackgroundIt is {{important}} to determine the size and proportion of thelarynx as such information is useful in procedures such asintubation, endoscopy and surgical manipulations. Recentinterest {{in the cases of}} subglottic stenosis and postintubationalstenosis of the lower respiratory tract has ledto renewed interest in ascertaining the measurements ofthe various laryngeal cartilages. The aim of the presentstudy was to collect morphometric data of cricoid cartilagefrom a regional population. MethodFifty laryngeal preparations from adult cadavers of WesternIndia were assessed. Sections were prepared via dissectionand the removed cricoid cartilages then measured andweighed. ResultsThe mean antero-posterior diameter (19. 29 ± 2. 47) of thecricoid cartilage was greater than the average transversediameter (18. 33 ± 2. 26). The <b>height</b> <b>of</b> <b>arch</b> of cricoidcartilage was 6. 54 ± 1. 23 mm and height of lamina was 21. 45 ± 1. 97 mm. Mean weight of cricoid cartilage was 4. 53 ± 1. 27 grams. The shape of the cricoid cartilage wasovoid in 46 % of cases, oval in 38 %, pear shaped in 12 % andnarrow-oblong in 4 % of cases. ConclusionInter-subject variability in the dimensions of cricoidcartilages was observed. The large difference in almost allsizes and shapes of the cricoid cartilage makes it difficult tostandardise the rigid stents used in these organs. Endotracheal tubes of the appropriate size should thereforebe based on the measurements of individual patients. Clinicians should therefore be aware of morphologicalvariations as they are of fundamental clinical importance. Key WordsCricoid cartilage, larynx, morphometr...|$|E

40|$|Harris & Beath claimed 23 % {{of human}} kind {{population}} is indicated flatfoot. Identifying flatfoot is by using wet foot test. This footprint is not accurate {{because of the}} difficulty to make sure the patient stand upright. Another way is using x-ray to determine <b>height</b> <b>of</b> <b>arch</b> which is a distance from medial longitudinal foot arch to the ground. If the distance is less than certain level, so the foot type is included as flatfoot. Other method proposed by Kulkarni et al. using the footprint index (FPI) which is the ratio of B intercept to A intercept, where the footprint was obtained from pedobarography image. If FPI is lower than 0. 63, it is categorized as flatfoot. Another method to determine arch type which is widely used is Cavanagh’s Arch Index (AI) from division of mid foot area to entire footprint area (excluding the toes). If AI> 0. 26, then the foot type is flatfoot. This study is to learn the correlation between entire loaded and unloaded foot area with Cavanag’s AI. The entire loaded foot and footprint area for evaluating AI derived from a digital footprint modified from document scanner, while the entire unloaded foot area derived from a 3 D scanner for foot orthotic. One hundred and two healthy asked voluntarily for doing footprint. From 102 subjects found 63 participants identified as flatfoot, 31 subjects are normal feet and 8 subjects identified as high arch. A series of 3 x 3 repeated measures ANOVAs were used to determine statistical differences (α< 0. 05). A significant interaction existed between ratio of entire loaded and unloaded foot area (RFA) subject to all categories of AI (p< 0. 05) also a correlation coefficient of r= 0. 67 has found between RFA and AI on foot type of flatfoot which means that flatfoot can be indicated by RFA...|$|E

40|$|Majority of {{paediatric}} flat {{feet are}} flexible and asymptomatic; less than 0. 1 % of all flat feet are rigid. If {{these can be}} diagnosed and managed early, then various complications can be prevented and they will remain asymptomatic. This {{study was conducted to}} analyse the ankle rotational mal-alignments in the natural course of flexible flat foot in children. Seventy-six patients of flexible flat foot and one hundred controls were included in this study. The <b>height</b> <b>of</b> foot <b>arches</b> was judged clinically by inspecting the <b>height</b> <b>of</b> the medial <b>arch</b> and by measuring the arch index on weight-bearing podograms. Tibial torsion and bimalleolar angle were assessed in all subjects. Tibial torsion was assessed in the first twenty subjects (ten cases and ten controls) both by clinical methods (foot-thigh angle) and CT. As no statistical difference in the two methods was observed, tibial torsion was measured by clinical methods only in the remaining subjects. Bimalleolar angle was measured on weight-bearing podograms in all subjects. For a minimum of two years, cases were followed up regularly with a standard conservative protocol and the <b>height</b> <b>of</b> the <b>arches</b> observed. Majority <b>of</b> cases of flexible flat foot were found to have increased tibial torsion and increased foot-bimalleolar angle (high talar spin).

During the research the shape of feet (Egyptian, Greek, Roman), the frequency of its occurrence in somatic types was determined. Shriter index, which characterizes the <b>height</b> <b>of</b> the <b>arch</b> <b>of</b> the foot and Veysflog index, which characterizes the spring function of the foot, was calculated.

High arch is common for Greek foot in the brahimorphic hypotrophic somatotype; elevated arch – for Roman foot in dolihomorphic normotrophic somatotype; flattened arch – for Egyptian foot in dolihomorphic normotrophic somatotype; platypodia - for Greek foot with brahimorphic hypotrophic somatotype.

As the rise, or <b>height</b> <b>of</b> the <b>arch</b> decreases, the outward thrust increases.
