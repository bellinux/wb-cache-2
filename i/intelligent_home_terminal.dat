40|$|Purpose - This paper aims {{to review}} the extant <b>intelligent</b> <b>home</b> {{specifications}} and put forward a new dimension for the specifications of <b>intelligent</b> <b>home</b> (IHS). Design/methodology/approach - This study adopts a learning (bottom-up) algorithm which {{emphasizes the importance of}} learning and adaptability to the dynamic environmental changes in the IHS. Findings - The study finds that the <b>intelligent</b> <b>home</b> has been characterized by automation, integration of facilities and communication. However, it is contended here that an <b>intelligent</b> <b>home</b> specification in such a hard-wired (top-down) approach cannot be sustained {{in the light of the}} continuous changes of user requirements. Hence, adaptation to users' needs must be encompassed in a system of home intelligence. Research limitations/implications - This study provides a framework for all stakeholders to work for a common goal and a platform for benchmarking the performance of <b>intelligent</b> <b>home</b> in the long run. Originality/value - This is the first to adopt the learning (bottom-up) algorithm in defining home intelligence. © Emerald Group Publishing Limited. link_to_subscribed_fulltex...|$|R

40|$|Ambient Intelligence (AmI) {{research}} is {{giving birth to}} a multitude of futuristic home scenarios and applications; however a clear discrepancy between current installations and research-level designs can be easily noticed. Whether this gap {{is due to the}} natural distance between research and engineered applications or to mismatching of needs and solutions remains to be understood. This paper discusses the results of a survey about user expectations with respect to <b>intelligent</b> <b>homes.</b> Starting from a very simple and open question about what users would ask to their <b>intelligent</b> <b>homes,</b> we derived user perceptions about what <b>intelligent</b> <b>homes</b> can do, and we analyzed to what extent current research solutions, as well as commercially available systems, address these emerging needs. Interestingly, most user concerns about smart homes involve comfort and household tasks and most of them can be currently addressed by existing commercial systems, or by suitable combinations of them. A clear trend emerges from the poll findings: the technical gap between user expectations and current solutions is actually narrower and easier to bridge than it may appear, but users perceive this gap as wide and limiting, thus requiring the AmI community to establish a more effective communication with final users, with an increased attention to real-world deploymen...|$|R

Safety and security are two most important issues in the remote monitoring and control of <b>intelligent</b> <b>home</b> environments. This article takes safety and security into consideration together and proposes a phone-out-only policy for ensuring security and virtual home environments for safety. A remote monitoring and control system for a security camera is used to illustrate the new methodologies for safety and security. By using the demonstration system people are able to easily monitor and control a security camera, central heating, microwave oven and washer from anywhere by using mobile phones. Our system distinguishes from the existing DTI (Department of Trade and Industry in the UK) next wave technologies and a few of on-going EU projects in the ways of dealing with safety and security and its simplicity.
