5|$|Nan's {{experiences}} eventually reveal serious faults of {{the society}} she moves through, the primary element of a picaresque novel. For this and other reasons, Waters' books are frequently compared to stories by Charles Dickens; the reader follows Nan's movement from sheltered naif to exuberant theatre performer to rent-boy to mistress to housewife then socialist orator, showing allegiance to none of these professions or ideals. Michael Upchurch <b>in</b> <b>The</b> <b>Seattle</b> Times writes that Nan's inability or unwillingness to adhere to any profession or setting, remaining malleable {{until the end of}} the novel indicates she is her own worst enemy. Likewise, Marianne Brace in The Independent considers Nan selfish and unsympathetic.|$|E

5|$|As {{prosperity}} {{began to}} return in the 1980s, the city {{was stunned by the}} Wah Mee massacre in 1983, when 13 people were killed in an illegal gambling club <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>Seattle</b> Chinatown-International District. Beginning with Microsoft's 1979 move from Albuquerque, New Mexico, to nearby Bellevue, Washington, Seattle and its suburbs became home to a number of technology companies including Amazon.com, F5 Networks, RealNetworks, Nintendo of America, McCaw Cellular (now part of AT Mobility), VoiceStream (now T-Mobile), and biomedical corporations such as HeartStream (later purchased by Philips), Heart Technologies (later purchased by Boston Scientific), Physio-Control (later purchased by Medtronic), ZymoGenetics, ICOS (later purchased by Eli Lilly and Company) and Immunex (later purchased by Amgen). This success brought an influx of new residents with a population increase within city limits of almost 50,000 between 1990 and 2000, and saw Seattle's real estate become some of the most expensive in the country. In 1993, the movie Sleepless in Seattle brought the city further national attention. Many of the Seattle area's tech companies remained relatively strong, but the frenzied dot-com boom years ended in early 2001.|$|E
5|$|Coffee shop {{employees}} {{who witnessed the}} shooting identified Clemmons as the shooter {{from a series of}} photos. Authorities sought him in what was considered one of the biggest manhunts the Seattle-Tacoma area had ever seen, and Clemmons was considered the most wanted man in the Pacific Northwest. Authorities also surrounded the homes of Clemmons' friends and family in order to prevent him from finding shelter, and to determine who was helping him. A relative learned that Clemmons was coming to her home in the Leschi neighborhood in Seattle, informed the police and fled. Police locked down the house for 11 hours in the early morning of November 30, believing Clemmons to be holed up inside. After several attempts to coax or force him out of the house, including use of a robot and flashbang grenades, police entered and discovered Clemmons was not inside. Later that day, police searched multiple locations <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>Seattle</b> and Tacoma areas, including a park where they found a handgun carried by Clemmons and his pickup truck, which had blood stains inside.|$|E

5|$|On October 5, 1949, Douglas made a radio {{appearance}} announcing her candidacy. She attacked Downey almost continuously {{throughout the}} remainder of the year, accusing him of being a do-nothing, a tool of big business, and an agent of oil interests. She hired Harold Tipton, a newcomer to California who had managed a successful congressional campaign <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>Seattle</b> area, as her campaign manager. Douglas realized that Nixon would most likely be the Republican nominee, and felt that were she to win the primary, the wide gap between Nixon's positions and hers would cause voters to rally to her. Downey, who suffered from a severe ulcer, was initially undecided about running, but announced his candidacy in early December in a speech that included an attack on Douglas. Earl Desmond, a member of the California State Senate from Sacramento whose positions were similar to Downey's, also entered the race.|$|E
5|$|Psilocybe allenii was {{described}} as new to science in 2012 by Jan Borovička, Alan Rockefeller, and Peter G. Werner. Borovička received material collected from Seattle, Washington, which he noted was microscopically similar to Psilocybe cyanescens, but lacked the wavy cap margins characteristic of that species. In previous publications, Borovička had noted that both macro- and microscopic characters of certain Psilocybe species were highly variable, which could also account for the differences observed <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>Seattle</b> material. However, DNA sequencing revealed a 5-base pair change in the internal transcribed spacer regions (a segment of RNA often used in molecular phylogenetics to identify or distinguish fungal species) between P.cyanescens and the Seattle collections. This difference, {{in addition to the}} readily observable macroscopic differences, was deemed sufficient to warrant describing the taxon as a new species. Additional molecular studies published by Borovička and colleagues in 2015 identified P.azurescens, P.cyanescens, P.weraroa, P.cubensis, and P.serbica as closely related to P.allenii.|$|E
