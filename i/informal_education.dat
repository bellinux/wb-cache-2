5|$|Khrimian {{was born}} in the Aygestan (Aikesdan) quarter of Van. His father, a weaver, died when Mkrtich was a child and he was brought up by his uncle, Khachatur, a merchant. The root of his last name, Khrim, is the Armenian {{language}} term for Crimea, suggests a link his family had with the peninsula. He received <b>informal</b> <b>education</b> at parochial schools of Lim and Ktuts islands in Lake Van and Varagavank, where he studied classical Armenian, history, and ecclesiastical literature. Upon returning to Van in 1842, he embarked on a journey across the region and made a pilgrimage to Etchmiadzin, the center of the Armenian Church. Khrimian wished to continue his education at a European university, but this desire was never realized. He lived in Constantinople from 1844 to 1846 where he made connections with Armenian intellectuals.|$|E
5|$|Child labour in the industries, {{especially}} in match making factories, {{was at its}} peak during the 1970s and 1980s. In 1981, the child work force in the age group 4â€“16 was 30% of the total work force, 90% of whom were girls. In 1986, the National Child Labour project estimated child labour in Sivaksi match making industries to be 14,121 children. The estimates indicated 80% of the child labour belonging to Scheduled Castes (SC), who were margianlised for centuries for cheap labour. Poverty and lack of farm produce were stated as {{the main reason for}} child labour. The employers also preferred children because of ease in management, discipline and lack of labour unions. The children in these industries suffered from back ache, neck ache, tuberclosis, malnutrition, gastointestinal disorders, dermatitis, respiratory disorders, over-exhaustion, burn injuries and water borne diseases due to exposure to harmful chemicals in the work environment. The situation of the child labour came to light during an accident of a bus transporting the children in 1976. The central government appointed a one-man committee under Harbans Singh in 1978, who reported abolishing child labour would seriously impact the economy of the region. The National Policy on child labour was formulated by the central government in August 1987, aiming at the rehabilitation of children withdrawn from these factories. In 1988, the union labour ministry initiated a programme for providing <b>informal</b> <b>education,</b> free health care and free lunch for children working in the factories. The Supreme Court of India, in a judgement ruled on December 1996 indicating provisions for preventing child labour like compensation for the child employed, employment to the adult members of the family and contribution to the corpus fund by the state government. From the establishment of child labour Act in 1986 till 2011, 150,000 inspections on child labour have been conducted in the factories, 1,500 cases have been registered and few prosecutions have been made. The results indicated small amount of child labour in cottage and house hold industries.|$|E

40|$|Research {{shows that}} a high {{percentage}} of science organizations in the United States offer programs specifically designed for K- 12 students and teachers. These programs include, {{but are not limited to}} supplementary classroom experiences and science learning opportunities in the form of afterschool, summer, and weekend programs for underserved populations. Successful formal-informal collaborations allow participants to explore and understand a vast range of science topics. Successful community partnerships amongst informal educators themselves allow for improved resources for formal educators. In this study, I examined the <b>informal</b> marine <b>education</b> programs in the Texas Gulf Coast region and explored the practices they offer in STEM fields. I used a convergent parallel mixed methods design that involved both qualitative and quantitative data collection phases to determine the level and the value of the STEM opportunities provided by the <b>informal</b> marine <b>education</b> programs. I interviewed five participants from five <b>informal</b> marine <b>education</b> programs in the Texas Gulf Coast region and asked them their opinions and views of STEM education quality and accessibility of their <b>informal</b> marine <b>education</b> program. Twenty two participants completed a survey designed to explore participants? perceptions about the quality of STEM <b>education</b> in <b>informal</b> marine <b>education</b> programs serving the Texas Gulf Coast. Findings indicate that while there is success in providing meaningful STEM opportunities, barriers exist in making programs financially accessible...|$|R
