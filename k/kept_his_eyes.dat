500|$|Meeker {{had taken}} an ox team and wagon to Portland's Lewis and Clark Exposition in 1905; en route he had <b>kept</b> <b>his</b> <b>eyes</b> open for places to set up {{suitable}} monuments on the Cowlitz Trail, on which pioneers had journeyed from the Columbia River to Puget Sound. He made arrangements with locals in towns along that trail {{to raise money to}} build monuments there. He gave lectures as a fundraiser, but raised little money. He took his team and wagon for daylong shakedown trips, despite the mocking of some who remembered him as Hop King. [...] After several days camped on his lawn as practice for the trip, and then in other nearby locales, Meeker set out from Olympia on February 19, 1906.|$|E
500|$|His pleas were in vain. [...] Three days later, Digby, Robert Wintour, John Grant and Thomas Bates were hanged, {{drawn and}} {{quartered}} {{at the western}} end of St Paul's churchyard. [...] The following day, Rookwood, Thomas Wintour, Robert Keyes and Guy Fawkes were tied to wattled hurdles and dragged by horse from the Tower, to the Old Palace Yard at Westminsterâ€”a longer route than had been suffered by their fellow conspirators. [...] Rookwood had asked to be informed when he passed by his lodgings in the Strand, so that he could open his eyes and see his wife, waiting at the window. [...] He shouted [...] "Pray for me, pray for me!" [...] According to Father Gerard (who was not then present), Elizabeth answered, [...] "I will, and be of good courage. [...] Offer theyself wholly to God. [...] I, for my part, do as freely restore thee to God as He gave thee unto me." [...] For the rest of the journey he <b>kept</b> <b>his</b> <b>eyes</b> closed, in prayer. [...] Thomas Wintour was the first that day to be hanged and then killed. [...] Rookwood was next, and made a short speech to the assembled audience. [...] He was repentant, asking God to bless the king, queen, and their [...] "royal progeny", but [...] "spoil all the pottage with one filthy weed" [...] by beseeching God to make the king a Catholic. [...] Nevertheless, he seems to have been left to hang for longer than the others, before suffering the remainder of his grim sentence.|$|E

60|$|Martin Lightfoot {{heard those}} words; {{and knowing that}} envy and hatred, like all other vices in those {{rough-hewn}} times, were apt to take very startling and unmistakeable shapes, <b>kept</b> <b>his</b> <b>eye</b> accordingly on those three knights.|$|R
6000|$|... "Nor herring, nor albatross, nor flying-fish?" [...] {{continued}} Cap, who <b>kept</b> <b>his</b> <b>eye</b> fastened on the guide, {{in order}} to see how far he might venture. [...] "No such thing as a fish that can fly, I daresay?" ...|$|R
