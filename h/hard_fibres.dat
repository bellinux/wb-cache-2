40|$|Minor {{natural fibres}} such as sisal, kenaf and coir were {{important}} exports from ACP countries until low-cost synthetic polypropylene destroyed their markets almost over-night. Ij {{the last two}} decades these natural fibres have regained some of their lost markets as oil and its derivatives have increased in price and as environmental concerns have encouraged a return to 'natural' products. Despite this, production of <b>hard</b> <b>fibres</b> remains stagnant. Could these industries be revitalized and their economic potential realized? Asia dominates world markets for hard industrial fibres, and certain countries have won themselves leading positions as suppliers of coir (India and Sri Lanka), jute (India and Bangladesh) and abaca (Philippines). In Africa sisal is the major hard fibre, although smaller quantities of coir (coconut fibre) and kenaf are also produced. Until the 1960 s Tanzania, followed by Kenya, led the world market in sisal, with smaller but economically significant quantities grown in Angola, Madagascar, Mauritius and Mozambique. The development of lower-cost rot-proof twine for baling hay and straw in Europe and the US and the trend to the use of plastic sacks was a damaging blow to sisal; large acreages were abandoned. In Tanzania, the sisal production collapsed from 250, 000 tonnes to 30, 000 tonnes. Mauritius abandoned the crop completely. Coir also suffered competition from synthetics and although never a major product in Africa, it was again Kenya and Tanzania that suffered, in common with many islands with extensive coconut plantations in the Caribbean. and Pacific. Despite this damaging reversal there was a revival of interest in natural fibres in the eighties; as the price of polypropylene increased, natural fibre products were seen to be equal or better value for money Unfortunately, weakened industries were in a poor position to exploit their opportunity. The sisal industry in Tanzania was perhaps typical: nationalization of estates, lack of investment in processing machinery and poor management had eroded output, quality and buyer confidence. Skilled estate workers had drifted away to alternative employment or subsistence farming. A future, or only a past? Natural <b>hard</b> <b>fibres</b> have been used to manufacture a great variety of products from twines and ropes to woven fabrics for bags and carpet backing and for brush bristles, matting, screens and wall hangings. New possibilities include making paper from sisal, geotextiles for stabilizing ground disturbed by civil engineering, using natural fibres for soundproofing cars and developing coir dust as a plant growing medium in place of peat. The tragedy of recent policy decisions in ACP producing countries has been that not even local domestic, industrial and government buyers have supported their own industries but instead have opted for, and paid hard currency for, imported polypropylene twines, plastic bags and sheets, and nylon brush heads. Despite these damaging developments, production of <b>hard</b> <b>fibres</b> in ACP countries is remarkably stable and production is now concentrated {{in the hands of a}} relatively small but committed core of growers and processors. These could provide a foundation of expertise and production on which to expand production on which to expand national output of selected fibres, develop value-added processing, stimulate rural industries and provide much sought-after employment. World demand for industrial <b>hard</b> <b>fibres</b> currently exceeds supply and there is considerable potential for using more locally-grown and processed, fibre-based products. Fibre crops are not demanding with regard to fertilizer or pesticide inputs; they provide substantial employment opportunities at harvesting and processing and offer the benefit of substituting for imports paid for in hard currency. But, to be economically successful and sustainable, fibre-based industries require careful planning, quality control and stronger links between research and development and commercial developments. The manufacturers of oil-based competitor products invest in research to improve their products and to develop new uses and new products. They also advertise to promote their products. Natural fibre producers and processors must be prepared to compete in all these activities. There are many examples of successful producers of other commodities which have developed brand awareness and loyalty: Mauritius sugar, Ivorien, Jamaican and Kenyan coffee, Dominica's coconut oil soap and Indian jute. Some have achieved this entirely through commercial endeavour, some with a degree of government assistance; but all have benefited the respective countries in terms of employment, import substitution and export earnings. Many ACP countries could do the same with the minor fibre crops suited to their agro-ecological conditions if long-term political and commercial commitments were made.

40|$|Optical fibre sensors (OFS) {{are worthy}} of {{interest}} for measurements in nuclear reactor thanks to their unique features, particularly compact size and remote multi-point sensing for some of them. But besides non negligible constraints associated with the high temperature environment of the experiments of interest, {{it is well known}} that the performances of OFS can be severely affected by high level of radiations. The Radiation Induced Attenuation (RIA) in the fibre is probably most known effect, which can be to some extent circumvented by using rad <b>hard</b> <b>fibres</b> to limit the dynamic loss. However, when the fast neutron fluence reaches 1018 to 1019 n/cm 2, the density and index variations associated to structural changes may deteriorate drastically the performances of OFS even if they are based on rad <b>hard</b> <b>fibres,</b> by causing direct errors in the measurements of temperature and/or strain changes. The aim of the present study is to access the effect of nuclear radiations on the Fabry Perot (FP) and of Fibre Bragg Grating (FBG) sensors through the comparison of measurements made on these OFS - or part of them - before and after irradiation [1]. In the context of development of OFS for high irradiation environment and especially for Material Testing Reactors (MTRs), Sake 2 experiment consists in an irradiation campaign at high level of gamma and neutron fluxes conducted on samples of fibre optics – bare or functionalised with FBG. The irradiation was performed at two levels of fast neutron fluence: 1 and 3. 1019 n/cm 2 (E> 1 MeV), at 250 °± 25 °C, in the SCK•CEN BR 2 reactor (Mol Belgium). An irradiation capsule was designed to allow irradiation at the specified temperature without active control. The neutron fluence was measured with activation dosimeters and the results were compared with MCPN computations. Investigation of bare samples gives information on the density changes, while for the FBGs both density and refractive index perturbation are involved. Some results for bare fibres were reported recently. In this paper, we will focus on the measurements made on FBGs that have been manufactured by different laboratories on SMF 28 fibers: CEA, University of St-Etienne and University of Mons. Tested gratings have been written using various conditions (type of fibre, of laser, writing wavelength, power density, post writing thermal annealing,…), leading to various behaviours after Sake 2 irradiation. Bragg wavelength and reflectivity have been measured before and after irradiation thanks to a special mounting at the same temperature. It appears that a change in the shape after irradiation of the Bragg peak disturb the retrieval of the Bragg wavelength. The measurements show that for nearly all gratings the Bragg peak remains visible after the irradiation, and that Radiation Induced Bragg Wavelength Shifts (RI-BWSs) vary from few pm (equivalent to an error of less than 1 °C for a temperature sensor) to nearly 1 nm (equivalent to 100 °C) depending of the FBG types. High RI-BWSs could indeed be expected when considering the huge refractive index variation and compaction of the bare fibre samples that have been measured by other techniques. Post writing thermal annealing is confirmed as a key parameter in order to obtain a more radiation tolerant FBG. Our results show that specific annealing regimes allow making FGBs suitable to perform temperature measurements in a MTR experiment...|$|E

Its first goal was to measure the fiber linear compaction under high fast neutron fluence. This compaction is known to cause a noticeable measurement error of a FPS through a radiation-induced drift and an accurate quantification of this effect is required to optimize the FPS design. To achieve this, an innovative approach was used. Ad hoc samples of various fiber types have been prepared and exposed in the SCK. CEN BR 2 reactor (Mol Belgium). After 22 days of irradiation at 291 °C a total fast (E > 1 MeV) fluence of 3 to 5 × 1019 nfast/cm 2, depending on the sample location, was accumulated. A precise measurement of each fibre sample length was made before the irradiation and compared to the post irradiation measurement highlighting a decrease of the fibres' length corresponding to about 0. 25 % of linear compaction. The amplitude of the observed changes is independent of the neutron fluence, which indicates that the compaction effect may saturate below the lowest considered fluence. A second goal was to perform preliminary evaluation of the feasibility to implement distributed temperature measurement in MTR using fibre Bragg gratings (FBG). Several FBG written in radiation <b>hard</b> <b>fibres</b> using a femtosecond laser have been elaborated with a procedure allowing to enhance their radiation tolerance.

The renewable natural <b>hard</b> jute <b>fibre</b> was impregnated with phenolic resin and was used for the manufacture of plywood. Plywood of 4 mm, 6 mm, 12 mm and 18 mm thick were manufactured by using phenolic resin impregnated jute felt having thickness 16 mm of 1850 GSM (approx.) as a core in place of the natural wood veneer. From the study, it can be inferred that PF Resin impregnated Non oven jute felt as a natural fibre can suitably replace the wooden glue core veneer to manufacture ply board up to 80 % as an alternative substitute of wood. The physico-mechanical properties such as surface roughness, moisture content, density, water absorption, swelling, compressive strength, tensile strength, static bending strength, glue shear strength, of the plywood manufactured by using jute felt as core veneer with different resin dilution have been studied. Data revels that most of the physico-mechanical properties of the plywood showed satisfactory results meeting the requirement of different grades of plywood tested as per IS: 1734 - 1983. The accelerated study of the glued core after impregnation with jute felt have been carried out for three months before plywood manufacture after storing it in proper temperature and humidity. The data revealed that there is no appreciable change in bond quality and mechanical properties of the plyboard manufactured after storing the veneer up to 30 days. The study concluded that wood substituted jute composites could be an ideal solution with ever depleting forest reserves where utilization of renewable resources will be beneficiary for plywood industries to meet the challenges during scarcity of veneer by reducing the cost of imported veneer...|$|R

What is clear is that the game has deeply evolved. In order {{to take into account the}} specificities of this surface, new tactics, new techniques (such as the indian dribble) have been developed and new rules have been settled, often, in order to frame, these new techniques. Regarding the evolution of the hockey player material, the sticks have changed shape, with the bent head at the bottom, which used to be about 15 centimetres long, becoming much stubbier. The extra length was no longer necessary, as the ball travelled much straighter on the flatter synthetic fields. The shorter length made playing the ball with the [...] "backhand" [...] (playing with the head of the stick to the player's left, with the head rotated 180 degrees from its usual position) much easier, increasing the speed with which this tactic, often used for evasive manoeuvres, could be used. It also makes trapping the ball by placing the entire stick on the ground, with the point of the head resting on the ground to the player's left, possible, and this stopping technique is now universal for trapping the ball at penalty corners. The sticks also tend to become more and stiffer as to hit the ball <b>harder.</b> Fibreglass, carbon <b>fibre</b> and kevlar were first applied to the traditional wood core in early 1970s.

40|$|The social {{geometries}} {{of digital}} connectivity. At first glance a social geography of virtual connections seems an oxymoron. For many years, {{one of the}} claims behind Information and Communication Technologies (hereafter ICTs) and especially (new) media was to render geography less important. These technologies have long promised, and enabled, proximity without propinquity; they mean people in Birmingham and Bangalore can interact, exchange ideas and information as easily {{as those in the}} same city. At least in principle they might. It is clear that in practice there are a range of geographies – thus the scope of communication between Birmingham and Bangalore, even with video conferencing, may still be more restricted than face to face contacts within the cities. There is a consequent question of whether the nature of communication changes when mediated, or whether some kinds of social relations are more easily mediated than others. Secondly, Bangalore just happens to be the high tech capital of India and is globally well connected. A different empirical situation might prevail if our rhetorical example was Brazzaville in the Democratic Republic of the Congo. The infrastructures, capacities (both <b>hard,</b> like <b>fibre</b> cables, and soft, like skills) and thus the scope of possibilities are (still) geographically uneven – at all scales from global, to national, to regional, to urban, by age, by class, by ethnicity. Third, this uneven geography produces uneven social effects that may compound existing inequalities. This then is a set of geographies around the so called digital divide(s). Fourth, the use of new media may transform and refract existing spatial behaviors, creating new hybrid spaces. Finally, these new media may afford new arenas of social interaction that have their own internal geographies – where ‘online worlds’ of varying types use spatial frameworks to operate. Throughout the chapter it will become clear that much public rhetoric has focused upon technologies causing social changes. At worst this {{takes the form of a}} technological determinism, but even when less stark very often depicts society and technology as independent and opposing ontological realms that seem to clash together. Instead this chapter works through a theoretical vocabulary that see technologies and societies co-constituting each other. Instead of seeing a logic of substitution, where ICTs replace ‘real world’ things, it will focus on logics of remediation where we see a layering of socio-technical forms of life – where new media adds to older media, where social action domesticates new technologies, makes it useful and develops it. The approach will ask whether we can have social geographies that are not technosocial geographies. In other words, a great deal of our social world is now enabled by, mediated by, invested in and bound to various communication technologies. It will conclude by noting developments in technology mean we may have to decenter the human within an internet of things that produce a technological form of life...|$|R
40|$|This {{dissertation}} {{is concerned}} with the thermal behaviour of fibrous proteins encapsulated in rigid structures, among the most well-known representatives of this class being the alpha-keratins in human hair. In spite of a lot of work in the field, there is still no mechanism proposed for accounting on how thermal denaturation process occurs in hard alpha-keratins. This work aims at proposing a model for the alpha-keratin fibres and a mechanism for their thermal denaturation process. These are further used for understanding the effect of various cosmetic reagents on the thermal stability of the fibres. The use of differential scanning calorimetry, scanning electron microscopy and light microscopy revealed strong structural modifications induced by high temperature in case of heating keratin material in an opened atmosphere. The DSC in open environment was showed to supply misleading information, due to the interference of pyrolysis with the process of interest. Consequently the present work focuses mainly on using DSC of keratins in water excess. The study of the influence of pH, particularly acid values, on thermal behaviour of hard alpha-keratins, indicates limits of the two-phase model used so far to describe the fibrous proteins. We propose a three-phase model for explaining fibrous hard alpha-keratins high thermal stability and their reaction with various reagents. The approach is based on results from DSC study of keratins under various conditions, and is supported by amino-acid analysis, x-ray diffraction, Raman spectroscopy and tensile strength observations. According to the proposed model, the third phase, the interface between crystalline and matrix phases, made of nonhelical tail domains of keratin, scaffolds the intermediate filaments and controls their interaction with chemical reagents as well as their thermal properties. The differential scanning calorimetry measurements carried out in water excess and with different heating rates were used for the kinetic analysis of the endothermic process assigned to the denaturation of the helical material from human hair. We found that the kinetic mechanism is autocatalytic and that the value of the activation energy is rather close to disulphide bond scission than to protein denaturation. This allowed us proposing a multistep mechanism for the thermal denaturation of hard alpha-keratins in water excess that relies on the 3 -phase model which describes their structure. The limiting step of the thermal denaturation process is then the scission of S-S bonds between the main morphological components, namely intermediate filaments (IF) and matrix (IFAP). The theoretical proposed model shows a good agreement with the experimental recorded data. The chemical damage induced by bleaching, permanent waving and oxidative dyeing on the structure of <b>hard</b> alpha-keratin <b>fibres</b> (human hair) as revealed by modifications in their thermal behaviour was investigated by using differential scanning calorimetry. Regression analysis of the data from hair samples treated differently shows a linear correlation between the enthalpy of the denaturation peak recorded by DSC and the cystine content of the fibre. The experimental results are evaluated within the framework of a three-phase model in which the nonhelical (globular) terminal domains of keratin promote filament interactions and control the thermal properties of keratin intermediate filaments. Amino-acid analysis, x-ray diffraction and tensile strength measurements provide evidence that the attack of chemical reagents occur preponderantly in the matrix and at the interface between filament and matrix. A possible intermediate state between native and denaturated crystalline helical material is suggested to account for the increased disorder in the IFs-IFAP package induced by harsh treatments. The DSC data suggests that hair keratin IFs can modulate their organisation and thermal properties through chemical induced interactions...|$|R
40|$|Resumo: No Brasil, a agroindústria canavieira processa 318 milhões de toneladas de cana-de-açúcar por ano (UNICA, 2003). Atualmente, de 5 a 15 % desta matéria-prima é perdida no campo, quando o corte é feito manual ou mecanizado respectivamente, representando um prejuízo da ordem de US$ 450 milhões por ano. Devido a lei governamental n° 11. 241 de 19 / 09 / 2002, o corte tende a tornar-se apenas de cana crua, sem queimar, inviabilizando o corte manual. Desta forma, as perdas devem permanecer próximas do último valor. Este trabalho parte da hipótese de que é possível desenvolver alternativas tecnológicas, como o aprimoramento dos componentes e sistemas das colhedoras de cana-de-açúcar picada, para minimizar este desperdício. Pretendeu-se, inicialmente, quantificar as perdas impossíveis de serem levantadas diretamente no campo (perdas invisíveis), já que as perdas visíveis são conhecidas, e a incidência de matéria estranha na cana processada pelas colhedoras de cana picada. Mantendo-se as colhedoras sob condições controladas, os ensaios foram realizados em um galpão de manutenção de máquinas da Usina São João/Araras-SP e na oficina de protótipos agrícolas do Centro de Tecnologia da Copersucar-CTC, de janeiro/ 1997 a março/ 2000. As colhedoras, que permaneceram estacionárias, foram alimentadas por uma esteira rolante acionada pelo motor hidráulico. Nos ensaios de perdas invisíveis foram utilizadas, inicialmente, canas limpas, desfolhadas e despontadas e depois canas com folhas e pontas. Para a determinação das impurezas vegetais na carga, foram processados colmos integrais, com folhas e ponteiros, simulando a condição adversa de canavial tombado. Por meio da análise dos dados quantificados nos ensaios de cana com palha, concluiu-se que as perdas invisíveis nos sistemas das colhedoras variaram de 2 a 11 %, e são maiores na cana com maior teor de fibra e mais torta e na cana com palha em relação à cana sem palha. A eficiência de limpeza da matéria-prima ficou entre 74 % na base matéria seca, para a velocidade angular de rotação das pás do extrator primário de 1000 rpm e 89 % para a velocidade de 1200 rpm. Os resultados apontaram que o fluxo de massa de cana que alimenta a colhedora não tem influência nas {{magnitudes}} das perdas invisíveis totais de cana e na eficiência de limpeza na matéria-prima. Baseado nos resultados obtidos na primeira fase, na segunda etapa apresentou-se 4 propostas para a regulagem, ajustes e o aperfeiçoamento dos componentes das colhedoras. A primeira proposta foi verificar a possibilidade de utilização de uma mini-câmera para ser instalada junto ao disco de corte de base para auxiliar o operador da colhedora no controle da altura de corte. A segunda proposta avaliada foi a eficiência de um novo mecanismo de controle de altura do corte de base flutuante, capaz de acompanhar as ondulações do terreno. Observou-se, durante as safras 1999 / 2000, 2000 / 2001 e 2001 / 2002, que o mecanismo avaliado é eficiente, robusto e que oferece uma rápida resposta na altura requerida. Os resultados obtidos nos testes de campo, indicam que o corte de base flutuante tem um desempenho melhor que o convencional. Demonstram que o índice de impureza mineral na carga, a quantidade de soqueiras arrancadas e de perdas visíveis no campo são menores quando a colhedora trabalha em cana comercial equipada com o conjunto corte basal flutuante. O trabalho, também, avaliou a possibilidade de se utilizar um material alternativo (ferro fundido branco) para as facas dos rolos picadores em substituição ao padrão aço mola, visando, sem sucesso, aumentar a resistência ao desgaste e ao impacto destas peças. A quarta proposta foi o uso de um monitor de perdas instalado no extrator primário da colhedora. Avaliou-se o desempenho deste monitor trabalhando no campo e quantificando as perdas visíveis de cana e a eficiência de limpeza do extrator primário em relação a variação da rotação do ventilador. Utilizou-se para monitorar as perdas um sensor piezoelétrico que apresentou boa sensibilidade aos impactos contra o capuz do extrator primário. Observou-se também uma boa correlação entre os dados de eficiência de limpeza e perdas com os valores registrados pelo monitor. Assim, o presente trabalho visa reduzir os custos do processamento de cana minimizando as perdas e melhorando o desempenho das colhedoras de cana picada, aumentando a competitividade do setor. Abstract: The Brazilian {{sugar cane}} industry crashes 318 millions tones of sugarcane a year. Nowadays, from 5 to 15 % this raw material {{is lost in}} the field, when the harvesting is done by hand or mecanized respectively, given a damage about US$ 450 millions a year, since only 15 % is mechanical harvested. Due to a environmental government law green cane harvesting will be compulsory, in few years, so the losses must be keeping nearly the last number. The hipotesis for this work {{is that it is}} possible to make use of technologicals alternatives, to improve the components and internals systems to process raw material inside the sugar cane chopped harvesters, to minimize this waste. The purpose of this research was to determine the invisible losses (which are impossible to be located in the field) because the visible losses are already known, and the incidence of vegetable impurities (harvester primary extractor’s cleanliness efficiency) in the sugarcane processed by chopper harvesters. Trials carried out under controlled conditions at the maintenance workshop of São João Sugar mill (Araras-SP) and at the agricultural prototypes workshop of Centro de Tecnologia Copersucar (Piracicaba-SP), from January / 1997 till march/ 2000. The harvesters, which stayed stationary, were fed by a conveyor driven by a hydraulic motor. For the tests of invisible losses clean cane whithout leaves, straw and tops was used first, afther that, the wholestalks were processed with leaves and tops, also to determine vegetable impurities in the load, simulating adverse condition of lodged cane crop. The pneumatic cleaning systems velocity, extractors in the harvesters, affected the magnitude of invisible losses and the amount of vegetable impurities in the load. The largest invisible losses in the cane processed by the harvesters occured due to choppers and base cutter waste knives and they were higher at the primary extrator followed by the base cutter in all over the components and internals systems of the harvesters. The harvester had higher invisible losses in cane with leaves than in cane whithout leaves, and they were highest in the <b>hard</b> cane (higher <b>fibre)</b> and lodged and tangled cane. The values of invisible losses and incidence of amount of vegetable impurities (harvester primary extractor’s cleanliness efficiency) in the load, due to the different adjustments of pneumatic cleaning systems of the harvesters, are analysed and discussed in this work. Based on the first step data, it intends on the second step to show four proposals to set up, to adjust and to improve the harvester’s components. First of all, this work want to verify to use of a mini camera helping the harvesters’ operators control the base cutter’s height. At the beginning of this research a novel system for controlling base cutter cutting height was designed and manufactured in an attempt to improve the performance of commercial sugarcane chopper harvesters. The system differed from previous attempts to control base cutter height by suspending the base cutter gearbox and associated components as a discrete module incorporating a passive height control system. The advantages offered by this system include the potential for rapid response to cutting height requirements, the elimination of the secondary effects of base cutter height adjustments on topper height setting and, being fully mechanical, the system does not require additional hydraulic or mechanical control. This paper reviews the results of a testing programme undertaken on the floating base cutter system during the 1999 / 2000, 2000 / 2001 and 2001 / 2002 harvesting seasons with machines working in commercial cane fields. The results of the trial programme indicated that the mineral trash levels in loads transported from field to mill were consistently lower from machines fitted with the floating base cutter system relative to standard machines. The amounts of butts left in the field, of roots and stools removed from the field were also lower with the floating base cutter, however, under the conditions of the tests, statistical significance was not achieved. At the end, this research want to assess the chopper knives made of alternative material (white cast iron) to minimize the wearing and breaking by impacts, and it checks the Cane Loss Monitor working on primary extractor aimed to reduce raw material losses and improve the cleanliness of the cane load to the mill The proposed work aims to reduce the sugar cane processed costs minimizing the losses and improves to the chopped harvesters performance...|$|R
