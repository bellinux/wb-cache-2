They were effectively used by Allenby during his campaigns in the east, especially late in the war. Evidence exists that the Germans used horses in their experimentations with chemical and biological warfare. German agents in the US are suspected of infecting cattle and horses bound for France with <b>glanders,</b> a disease which can fatally spread to humans; similar tactics were used by the Germans against the Russians, causing breakdowns {{in their ability to}} move artillery on the Eastern Front.|$|E
5|$|Animals have {{repeatedly}} been used through {{the history of}} biomedical research. The founders, in 1831, of the Dublin Zoo {{were members of the}} medical profession, interested in studying the animals both while they were alive and when they were dead. In the 1880s, Louis Pasteur convincingly demonstrated the germ theory of medicine by inducing anthrax in sheep. In the 1880s, Robert Koch infected mice and guinea pigs with anthrax and tuberculosis. In the 1890s, Ivan Pavlov famously used dogs to describe classical conditioning. In World War I, German agents infected sheep bound for Russia with anthrax, and inoculated mules and horses of the French cavalry with the equine <b>glanders</b> disease. Between 1917 and 1918, the Germans infected mules in Argentina bound for American forces, resulting in the death of 200 mules. Insulin was first isolated from dogs in 1922, and revolutionized the treatment of diabetes. On November 3, 1957, a Soviet dog, Laika, became the first of many animals to orbit the earth. In the 1970s, antibiotic treatments and vaccines for leprosy were developed using armadillos, then given to humans. The ability of humans to change the genetics of animals took a large step forwards in 1974 when Rudolf Jaenisch was able to produce the first transgenic mammal, by integrating DNA from the SV40 virus into the genome of mice. This genetic research progressed rapidly and, in 1996, Dolly the sheep was born, the first mammal to be cloned from an adult cell.|$|E

25|$|The Confederate army {{experienced}} a persistent shortage of horses and mules, and requisitioned them with dubious promissory notes given to local farmers and breeders. Union forces paid in real money and found ready sellers in the South. Both armies needed horses for cavalry and for artillery. Mules pulled the wagons. The supply was undermined by an unprecedented epidemic of <b>glanders,</b> a fatal disease that baffled veterinarians. After 1863 the invading Union forces had {{a policy of}} shooting all the local horses and mules they did not need - {{in order to keep}} them out of Confederate hands. The Confederate armies and farmers {{experienced a}} growing shortage of horses and mules, which hurt the Southern economy and the war effort. The South lost half of its 2.5 million horses and mules; many farmers ended the war with none left. Army horses were used up by hard work, malnourishment, disease and battle wounds; they had a life expectancy of about seven months.|$|E
25|$|Creosote was {{suggested}} {{as a treatment}} for tuberculosis by Reichenbach as soon as 1833. Following Reichenbach, it was argued for by John Elliotson and Sir John Rose Cormack. Elliotson, inspired by the use of creosote to arrest vomiting during an outbreak of cholera, suggested its use for tuberculosis through inhalation. He also suggested it for epilepsy, neuralgia, diabetes and chronic <b>glanders.</b> The idea of using it for tuberculosis failed to take hold, and use of this purpose was dropped, until the idea was revived later in 1876 by the British doctor G. Anderson Imlay, who suggested it be applied locally in spray to the bronchial mucous membrane. This was followed up in 1877 when it was argued for in a clinical paper by Charles Bouchard and Henri Gimbert. Germ theory had been established by Pasteur in 1860, and Bouchard, arguing that a bacillus was responsible for the disease, sought to rehabilitate creosote for its use as an antiseptic to treat it. He began a series of trials with Gimbert to convince the scientific community, and claimed a promising cure rate. A number of publications in Germany confirmed his results in the following years.|$|E

25|$|The {{principal}} item {{of equipment}} for a cavalryman was the horse {{and one of the}} reasons both North and South initially hesitated in forming mounted units was because of financial considerations; each cavalry regiment cost $300,000 for initial organization with annual upkeep expenses tallying over $100,000. Both cavalries originally required recruits or local communities to provide horses, a policy that lasted briefly in the North, while the South maintained it throughout the war even though Richmond leaders recognized its serious drawbacks. While Confederate troopers bore the monetary cost of keeping themselves mounted, Union cavalrymen rode quartermaster issued animals obtained though public contracts (although officers had to reimburse the cost of their mounts to the government). While open to fraud early in the war, once tightened regulations and stringent inspections were enforced, the contract system yielded an estimated 650,000 horses for Union armies during the war exclusive of an additional 75,000 confiscated in Confederate territory. Union army guidelines for cavalry horse selection mandated animals be at least 15 hands high, weighing minimally 950 pounds and aged between 4 and 10 years old, and be well-broken to bridle and saddle. Animals were to be dark colors and free from defects such as shallow breathing, deformed hooves, spavin or ringbone. Geldings were preferred for cavalry horses with the purchase of mares strictly prohibited outside absolute military emergency and stallions' volatility and aggressiveness made them generally unsuitable for service. In the Confederacy, limited horse numbers did not permit such selectivity in trying to keep their armies horsed. Cavalry horse prices varied throughout the war; in 1861 the maximum government price for cavalry horses was $119. However, relentless military demand caused prices to continually increase and by 1865 prices hovered near $190 per head. In the Confederacy horse prices rapidly spiraled upward due to animal scarcity and inflation costing over $3,000 by war's end. The daily feed ration for Union cavalry horses was ten pounds of hay and fourteen pounds of grain which were ample and fulfilled the animals' nutritional needs if of good quality, however, the vagaries of the army supply system did not always insure prescribed forage amounts were delivered where most needed. On both sides volunteer officers often proved notably lax in promoting strict animal welfare, a shortcoming exacerbated by the absence of a trained and organized veterinary corps which allowed serious maladies like strangles, grease heel, farcy, and <b>glanders</b> to spread among army stock. The U.S. Congress finally created the rank of veterinary sergeant in March 1863, but the meager pay and rank held no inducement for qualified candidates to join the army. Repeated calls to establish a professional military veterinary service failed, and widespread waste, suffering, and destruction among army horses resulted; not until 1916 was an official U.S. army veterinary corps founded.|$|E

500|$|The {{guinea pig}} was most {{extensively}} implemented {{in research and}} diagnosis of infectious diseases. Common uses included identification of brucellosis, Chagas disease, cholera, diphtheria, foot-and-mouth disease, <b>glanders,</b> Q fever, Rocky Mountain spotted fever, and various strains of typhus. They are still frequently used to diagnose tuberculosis, since they are easily infected by human tuberculosis bacteria. Because guinea pigs {{are one of the}} few animals which, like humans and other primates, cannot synthesize vitamin C, but must obtain it from their diet, they are ideal for researching scurvy. From the accidental discovery in 1907 that scurvy could be induced in guinea pigs, to their use to prove the chemical structure of the [...] "ascorbutic factor" [...] in 1932, the guinea pig model proved a crucial part of vitamin C research.|$|E

2500|$|Contact with {{farm animals}} {{can lead to}} disease in farmers or others that {{come into contact with}} {{infected}} animals. [...] <b>Glanders</b> primarily affects those who work closely with horses and donkeys. Close contact with cattle can lead to cutaneous anthrax infection, whereas inhalation anthrax infection is more common for workers in slaughterhouses, tanneries and wool mills. Close contact with sheep who have recently given birth can lead to clamydiosis, or enzootic abortion, in pregnant women, as well as an increased risk of Q fever, toxoplasmosis, and listeriosis in pregnant or the otherwise immunocompromised. Echinococcosis is caused by a tapeworm which can be spread from infected sheep by food or water contaminated with feces or wool. Bird flu is common in chickens. While rare in humans, the main public health worry is that a strain of bird flu will recombine with a human flu virus and cause a pandemic like the 1918 Spanish flu.

40|$|Despite early neglect, {{recent studies}} of sexual {{selection}} have shown {{a renewed interest in}} female reproductive strategies. Clearly the traditional portrayal of female animals as passive participants in mating is incorrect, but much is still unknown about female reproductive strategies, including the extent of female mate choice. The primary goal of this dissertation was to explore the role of female mate choice in mantled howling monkeys (Alouatta palliata), a species in which males have previously been assumed to control mating. From March 2006 through February 2007, I used continuous focal-animal sampling to record the behavior of adult female mantled howlers at Hacienda La Pacifica, Guanacaste, Costa Rica. The focal animals in the study were nine adult females in a social group that has been regularly monitored since 1984. There were also three capture sessions performed by K. <b>Glander</b> to collect blood samples for genetic paternity analysis. A total of 29 individuals in the study group and eight adult males from surrounding groups were captured. The genetic paternity analyses were largely inconclusive. Of the eight microsatellite markers used previously in this species, only four were polymorphic in this sample. Additionally, nearly half (7 of 16) of the purported mothers were excluded at one locus. Assuming the mother was unknown allowed determination of genetic paternity in only one case. In terms of behavior, females were largely responsible for soliciting copulations, but female mate choice {{did not appear to be}} a major factor. Females almost never rejected copulations (3. 3 % of copulation attempts) and mated with multiple males in 77. 8 % of female cycles. The lack of conclusive genetic paternity data leaves open the possibility of post-copulatory female choice. However, explanations exist for the apparent lack of female mate choice in this species. Because males must attain alpha status to remain in a group, differences in inherent quality may be low among group males. The potential for small differences among males in a social group, combined with the fact that females disperse from their natal group, suggests that female mate choice may occur primarily in choosing a group during dispersal.
