5|$|Following {{an impromptu}} {{performance}} together in Los Angeles, <b>Hughes</b> <b>and</b> Bonamassa started the side project in November 2009, recruiting Bonham and Sherinian {{on the advice}} of Shirley to finalise the lineup of the band. The name Black Country Communion is derived from the term Black Country, which refers to the West Midlands area of England where <b>Hughes</b> <b>and</b> Bonham grew up. The group's sound is intentionally reminiscent of popular classic rock groups of the 1970s, reflecting the previous work of frontman Hughes (in bands such as Trapeze and Deep Purple) as well as the link between Bonham and his father John's band Led Zeppelin.|$|E

5|$|Glenn <b>Hughes</b> <b>and</b> Joe Bonamassa {{first met}} at the 2006 NAMM Show in Anaheim, California, after which they jammed {{together}} at Hughes's studio in Hollywood with the idea to make music together in the future.

In September 1999, he rejected a call-up from Northern Ireland in favour of joining up with Wales, managed by former Manchester United teammate Mark <b>Hughes</b> <b>and</b> coach Eric Harrison. However, he picked up an ankle injury in the lead-up to the game and missed out on the match-day squad.|$|E

5|$|Furthermore, the Prime Minister's {{own party}} was {{breaking}} down underneath him.
