5|$|The P90 is a {{selective}} fire, straight blowback-operated weapon with a cyclic {{rate of fire}} of 900 RPM (rounds per minute). The weapon is chambered for FN's 5.7×28mm ammunition. Its unusual shape is based on extensive ergonomic research. The weapon is grasped {{by means of a}} thumbhole in the frame that acts as a pistol grip, as well as an oversized trigger guard that acts as a <b>foregrip</b> for the shooter's support hand. The P90 fires from a closed bolt for maximum accuracy, and its design makes extensive use of polymers for reduced weight and cost. Overall, the weapon is relatively lightweight, weighing 2.5kg (5.6lb) empty, or 3kg (6.6lb) with a loaded 50-round magazine.|$|E
25|$|A Kydex {{hand guard}} and M68 CCO are also added as {{standard}} external accessories, {{though they are}} almost always replaced with a vertical <b>foregrip</b> and magnifying scope for better handling and {{for use in a}} designated marksman role. A Wind Talker suppressor can be mounted on the DC Vortex flash hider, though the U.S. military did not adopt one to active service.|$|E
25|$|It {{had a full}} pistol-gripped in-line {{stock to}} control recoil, a plastic upper forend to save weight, a muzzle compensator, the BAR sling, an M2 bipod, and a folding metal {{vertical}} <b>foregrip</b> mounted under the forend of the stock. Although an improvement over the M14 when in full-auto, it was still difficult to control, overheated rapidly, and the 20-round magazine limited its ability to deliver suppressive fire.|$|E
5000|$|Colt AR-15- M4A1 and Commando models utilized, usually {{equipped}} with different sights, flashlights, <b>foregrips,</b> usually more customized than usual patrol rifles.|$|R
50|$|Aftermarket {{replacement}} handguards with Picatinny rails are available. Single-rail {{models have}} a Picatinny rail {{along the bottom}} and triple-rail models have rails along the bottom and sides. They allow the mounting of accessories like flashlights, laser pointers, target designators, vertical <b>foregrips,</b> and bipods.|$|R
50|$|Colt Canada {{developed}} and in 2016 released the Modular Rail Rifle (MRR) {{that uses a}} monolithic upper receiver with the M-LOK attachment system. In 2017 several companies produce M-LOK handguards as well as accessories like Picatinny rail sections, vertical <b>foregrips,</b> bipod adapters, sling adapters, and flashlight mounts.|$|R
25|$|Firing {{tests showed}} that the M14, when {{equipped}} with the selector switch, hinged buttplate and bipod, performed {{as well as the}} M15. As a result, the M15 was dropped and the modified M14 became the squad automatic weapon. Accuracy and control problems with this variant led to the addition of a pistol grip, a folding rubber covered metal <b>foregrip</b> and a muzzle stabilizer. However, it was a poor suppressive fire weapon owing to 20-round magazines and it overheated rapidly.|$|E
25|$|G36A2: This is an {{ordnance}} designation {{allocated to}} an upgraded {{variant of the}} G36 used by the German Army. The G36A2 {{is equipped with a}} quick-detachable Zeiss RSA reflex red dot sight mounted on a Picatinny rail that replaces the original red dot sight of the dual combat sighting system. The G36A2 upgrade kit also consists of the shorter G36C stock (Designed for better handling with use of body armor and load bearing equipment), new handguard made of aluminium (provides better heat resistance during long periods of firing) with an optional 4 Picatinny rails and a vertical <b>foregrip</b> with an integrated switch for operating an Oerlikon Contraves LLM01 laser light module.|$|E
25|$|The M1928A1 variant entered mass {{production}} {{before the attack}} on Pearl Harbor, as on-hand stocks ran out. Changes included a horizontal forend, {{in place of the}} distinctive vertical <b>foregrip</b> ("pistol grip"), and a provision for a military sling. Despite new U.S. contracts for Lend-Lease shipments abroad to China, France, and the United Kingdom, as well as the needs of American armed forces, only two factories supplied M1928A1 Thompsons {{during the early years of}} World War II. Though it could use both the 50-round drum and the 20- or 30-round box magazines, active service showed the drums were more prone to jamming, rattled when moving, and were too heavy and bulky on long patrols. 562,511 were made. Wartime production variants had a fixed rear sight without the triangular sight guard wings and a non-ribbed barrel, both like those found on the M1/M1A1.|$|E
50|$|The NATO Accessory Rail (or NAR), {{defined by}} the new {{modernization}} agreement Standardization Agreement 4694, is a new standard for mounting auxiliary equipment such as telescopic sights, tactical lights, laser aiming modules, night vision devices, reflex sights, <b>foregrips,</b> bipods, and bayonets to small arms such as rifles and pistols.|$|R
50|$|The {{legality}} of vertical <b>foregrips</b> on pistols in the United States is unclear. In the United States, firearms are categorized by the National Firearms Act and firearms manufactured with specific features {{are subject to}} restrictions and controls. In {{the case of a}} vertical forward grip on a pistol, the law does not explicitly define such a feature as belonging to any category.|$|R
50|$|The NATO Accessory Rail (or NAR), {{defined by}} the new {{modernization}} agreement STANAG 4694 approved by NATO on 8 May 2009, is a new rail interface system standard for mounting auxiliary equipment such as telescopic sights, tactical lights, laser aiming modules, night vision devices, reflex sights, <b>foregrips,</b> bipods, and bayonets to small arms such as rifles and pistols. The NATO Accessory Rail is backwards-compatible with the STANAG 2324 or MIL-STD 1913 Picatinny rail.|$|R
2500|$|The CPW is {{available}} in 9mm Parabellum (9×19mm NATO) caliber for now and [...] "resembles an updated/modernized MP7A1". The main differences are the angled pistol grip of the CPW for enhanced ergonomics and natural aiming, and a transparent rear magazine so that the operator can see the rounds remaining. Other features include a skeletonised trigger, a full-length Mil-Std-1913 Picatinny top rail for mounting accessories such as optics and lasers, and a shorter bottom rail {{in front of the}} trigger guard for mounting a vertical <b>foregrip.</b>|$|E
2500|$|The Model 1921 (M1921) was {{the first}} major {{production}} model. Fifteen thousand were produced by Colt for Auto-Ordnance. In its original design, it was finished more like a sporting weapon, with an adjustable rear sight, a blued, finned barrel and vertical <b>foregrip</b> (or pistol grip) and the Blish lock. The M1921 was quite expensive to manufacture, with the original retail price around $200, because of its high-quality wood furniture and finely machined parts. The M1921 was famous throughout its career with police and criminals and in motion pictures. This model gained fame from its use by criminals during Prohibition, and was nicknamed [...] "tommy gun" [...] by the media.|$|E
2500|$|In 1970, the Policia Militar do Rio de Janeiro (PMRJ) {{asked the}} {{services}} of Jener Damau Arroyo, a Spanish-born gunsmith, to make modifications on their PASAMs {{in order to improve}} their handling. The first modification (PASAM MOD-1), of which 101 were modified, received a metal frame extension welded to the magazine housing. It was fitted with a metal forward grip well ahead of the gun under the muzzle. The original grip was left alone, making it compatible with the wooden holster/stock. The second modification (PASAM MOD-2), involving 89 pistols, featured a similar frame extension, but the forward grip had wooden panels and was of different shape. The pistol grip frame used thicker rectangular wooden grips and had a [...] "t-bar" [...] metal shoulder stock welded to it. A metal frame attached to the receiver supported a rectangular wooden <b>foregrip,</b> taking pressure off the barrel. In both models, of course, the barrel was left free so as to enable it to do its short recoil during firing. For the record, 295 PASAMs were left in the original condition. It took standard detachable 10-round box magazines, although they can also take the extended 20- and 40-round magazines.|$|E
5000|$|The Alpha Black Elite (Bravo One outside US) is a {{blowback}} design {{modeled after}} the 98 Custom, using [...] "clamshell" [...] body halves. In 2013, the Alpha Black was re-designed to use body halves {{similar to that of}} the [...] "Project Salvo", but retaining its M16 look. With the redesign, Tippmann added on their removable M16 carry handle, and re-designed the handguard to feature a Picatinny rail to allow the use of <b>foregrips.</b>|$|R
5000|$|A {{vertical}} forward grip is {{a vertical}} grip {{that is designed}} to attach to a firearm for the forward hand (or [...] "off hand"). These aid in the maneuverability of the firearm, since the natural angle of a person's outstretched hand is more oriented to grasping objects at a vertical angle, rather than a horizontal one perpendicular to the body. <b>Foregrips</b> can decrease accuracy in precision rifle shooting if the shooter tends to [...] "muscle the weapon".|$|R
50|$|The Picatinny rail was {{originally}} for mounting scopes atop the receivers of larger caliber rifles, but, once established, its use expanded to other such accessories as tactical lights, laser aiming modules, night vision devices, reflex sights, <b>foregrips,</b> bipods, and bayonets. Because of their many uses, Picatinny rails and accessories have replaced iron sights {{in the design}} of many firearms, and they are also on the undersides of semi-automatic pistol frames and grips. Their usefulness has led to their being used in paintball and airsoft.|$|R
2500|$|The MAR, or the Micro Galil, is a reduced-size {{version of}} the Galil SAR (706mm stock {{extended}} / 465mm folded), weighing 2.98kg (6.57 pounds) empty. Compared to the original carbine, the MAR has a shortened barrel (210mm), receiver, piston, gas tube and <b>foregrip.</b> The firearm is fed from a 35-round steel magazine which can be clipped together to increase reload speed. The MAR has the same rate of fire (630-750 rounds/min) as other 5.56mm Galil models. An optional magazine adapter inserted inside the magazine well allows the use of standard 20- and 30-round M16 magazines. The lever safety and fire selector (located {{on both sides of}} the receiver) has four settings: [...] "S"—weapon is safe, [...] "A"—automatic fire, [...] "B"—3-round burst, [...] "R"—semi-automatic mode. The barrel has a multifunction muzzle device. The MAR is equipped with a folding tubular aluminum stock and a flip aperture sight with two settings: 0–300m and beyond 300 m. The MAR can also be equipped with a night vision device (attached through an adapter mounted to the left side of the receiver), a daytime optical sight (mounted via a receiver cover adapter), low-light sights with tritium illuminated dots, a vertical forward grip with integrated laser pointer, silencer and a nylon sling. Upon request, the weapon can be supplied with a bolt catch, plastic magazines weighing 0.164kg or an enlarged trigger guard for use with gloves.|$|E

50|$|The Beretta Mx4 Storm is the {{military}} version of the Cx4 Storm pistol-caliber carbine. It has a barrel length of 12 inches, and is capable of automatic fire. The Mx4 can use pistol magazines, or its own 30-round magazine. There is an accessory rail {{on the top of}} the Mx4 for mounting scopes, laser aiming devices or flashlights. There is another rail underneath, forward of the trigger, for mounting vertical <b>foregrips,</b> laser aiming devices or flashlights. The Mx4, with a scope, is fairly accurate out to 100 meters, and automatic fire is accurate out to 200 meters. The Mx4 has a reputation, among the many police and security personnel who use it, of reliability, ease of use, and handling.|$|R
50|$|With the AK-47's {{long-stroke}} piston gas system, {{the piston}} is mechanically {{fixed to the}} bolt group and moves through the entire operating cycle. The primary disadvantage to this system is the disruption of the point of aim due {{to the center of}} mass changing during the action cycle and energetic and abrupt stops {{at the beginning and end}} of bolt carrier travel. However, the AK-47's heavier weight and slower rate-of-fire do a good job of mitigating any disadvantage. In addition, newer AK-47 type rifles use a muzzle brake or compensator to reduce recoil. Some AK type rifles also have vertical <b>foregrips</b> to improve handling characteristics and to counter the effects of recoil.|$|R

5000|$|The NATO Accessory Rail STANAG 4694, or Picatinny rail STANAG 2324, or a [...] "Tactical Rail" [...] is {{a bracket}} used on M16 type rifles {{to provide a}} {{standardized}} mounting platform. The rail comprises a series of ridges with a T-shaped cross-section interspersed with flat [...] "spacing slots". Scopes are mounted either by sliding them on from one end or the other; {{by means of a}} [...] "rail-grabber" [...] which is clamped to the rail with bolts, thumbscrews or levers; or onto the slots between the raised sections. The rail was originally for scopes. However, once established, the use of the system was expanded to other accessories, such as tactical lights, laser aiming modules, night vision devices, reflex sights, <b>foregrips,</b> bipods, and bayonets.|$|R
2500|$|Configurations of grips {{and stocks}} for riot {{shotguns}} vary widely, but often feature reinforced plastic [...] "furniture" [...] {{instead of the}} wood common on hunting firearms. Wood was used for riot gun stocks in the past, and sometimes still is. As compared to hunting shotguns, riot guns more often feature pistol grips, {{with or without a}} shoulder stock. Without a shoulder stock (or with a folding stock), a riot shotgun becomes more compact and thus is able to be brought to bear more rapidly in very close quarters. With the stock, the pistol grip facilitates control of the weapon and provides a more ergonomic grip when the shotgun is fired from the shoulder. <b>Foregrips,</b> or forends, also vary, often with the inclusion of a pistol-grip fore-end (further increasing control and absorbing recoil), and/or the addition of an accessory rail or other mounting point for a tactical light.|$|R
