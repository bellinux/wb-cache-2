5|$|Among other effects, the Korean War <b>galvanised</b> NATO {{to develop}} a {{military}} structure. Public opinion in countries involved, such as Great Britain, was divided for and against the war. Many feared an escalation into a general war with Communist China, and even nuclear war. The strong {{opposition to the war}} often strained Anglo-American relations. For these reasons British officials sought a speedy end to the conflict, hoping to unite Korea under United Nations auspices and withdrawal of all foreign forces.|$|E
5|$|Copper, zinc, tin, {{and lead}} are {{mechanically}} weaker metals but have useful corrosion prevention properties. While {{each of them}} will react with air, the resulting patinas of either various copper salts, zinc carbonate, tin oxide, or a mixture of lead oxide, carbonate, and sulfate, confer valuable protective properties. Copper and lead are therefore used, for example, as roofing materials; zinc acts as an anti-corrosion agent in <b>galvanised</b> steel; and tin serves a similar purpose on steel cans.|$|E
40|$|Corrosion {{in ground}} support {{elements}} remains an important area for industry focus, given the immediate concern for mine safety and operational efficiencies, {{as well as}} the hidden cost of longer term rehabilitation work. This paper discusses emerging ‘next generation’ technology within the field of corrosion protection, providing new solutions for specific application areas of ground support product design. Traditionally, anti-corrosion strategies have predominantly focussed upon Hot Dip <b>Galvanising</b> as a common industry solution. However, now complimenting this traditional solution, the more recent technology of Thermal Diffusion <b>Galvanising</b> is gaining interest within the Australian market, providing commercially viable solutions for a number of specific application areas that Hot Dip <b>Galvanising</b> cannot address. Thermal Diffusion <b>Galvanising</b> is an alternative zinc based technology, which offers equivalent cathodic protection to that of Hot Dip <b>Galvanising.</b> Thermal Diffusion <b>Galvanising</b> has a comparatively deeper metallurgical bond to the steel substrate through various zinc-iron alloy layers, offering both increased adhesion and greater surface hardness. Beyond the capabilities of Hot Dip <b>Galvanising,</b> Thermal Diffusion <b>Galvanising</b> has specific applications of interest in high tensile steel grades, coating thickness consistency for threadforms, excellent torque / tension performance and greater flexibility with deformation. Thermal Diffusion <b>Galvanising</b> also continues to provide spark reduction properties on friction contact. This paper provides a technical overview of the attributes of Thermal Diffusion <b>Galvanising</b> and its relative performance compared to that of Hot Dip <b>Galvanising.</b> Application of Thermal Diffusion <b>Galvanising</b> to ground support elements is then reviewed, relating the new technology to specific product design areas and field applications...|$|R

40|$|The master's degree thesis {{deals with}} the {{analysis}} of the quality management system in a selected organisation. The theoretical part focuses on history and quality management, quality principles and its concept. It describes the quality management system, its implementation and documentation. General standards and standards for hot-dip <b>galvanising</b> are an essential part for an easier orientation in the issues. The practical part describes a company engaged in hot-dip <b>galvanising,</b> the company's goals and the process of hot-dip <b>galvanising.</b> The next part provides {{a detailed description of the}} technological process concerning hot-dip <b>galvanising</b> to illustrate practically the quality management system. In order to follow the production process, one contract was selected and was closely observed during every step of the whole process of hot-dip <b>galvanising.</b> The last part of the chapter includes data analysis of the quality management system as well as a description of the Pareto analysis, which represents the only instrument of quality management in the organisation. The conclusion provides some improvement suggestions which should be applied by the company to enhance the quality management system and at the same time to prevent possible complications...|$|R

5|$|In February 1966, Sukarno {{promoted}} Suharto to lieutenant-general (and to full {{general in}} July 1966). The {{killing of a}} student demonstrator and Sukarno's order for the disbandment of KAMI in February 1966 further <b>galvanised</b> public opinion against the president. On 11 March 1966, the appearance of unidentified troops around Merdeka Palace during a cabinet meeting (which Suharto had not attended) forced Sukarno to flee to Bogor Palace (60km away) by helicopter. Three Suhartoist generals, Major-General Basuki Rahmat, Brigadier-General M Jusuf, and Brigadier-General Amirmachmud went to Bogor to meet Sukarno. There, they Persuaded and secured a presidential decree from Sukarno (see Supersemar) that gave Suharto authority to take any action necessary to maintain security.|$|E

Some are of modern or relatively modern origins; those on {{the south end of the}} barn are noticeably lighter in colour than the rest and are the result of the repairs made after the 1972 fire. Each side of the barn's roof holds 92 tile courses and a total of around 76,000 tiles, which were originally held in place by oak pegs. Many of the tiles have been replaced over the years and the oak pegs have been replaced by <b>galvanised</b> peg nails due to the effects of decay.|$|E

40|$|Hot zinc <b>galvanising</b> gives {{steel objects}} a {{corrosion}} resistant surface. The method demands large immersion basins for cleaning, pre-treatment and <b>galvanising.</b> Molten zinc {{has to be}} kept at a uniform temperature of 450 degrees C which requires a high consumption of energy. A Finnish company, Kuumagalvanionti Oy, has built a new hot zinc <b>galvanising</b> plant. By choosing to use electrical heating with sophisticated load control, energy consumption has been cut to 0. 15 kWh per kg of product. Average energy consumption of oil/gas fuelled zinc basins in Finland is about 0. 45 kWh/kg. The new plant also has a system for recycling the pickling fluid used in the process. This reduces cost and also minimises pollution...|$|R

5|$|The {{nature of}} the murders and of the victims drew {{attention}} to the poor living conditions in the East End and <b>galvanised</b> public opinion against the overcrowded, unsanitary slums. In the two decades after the murders, the worst of the slums were cleared and demolished, but the streets and some buildings survive and the legend of the Ripper is still promoted by guided tours of the murder sites.

5|$|The {{rebellion}} {{took place}} {{a few months}} after the founding of the Anti-Slavery Society, and had a strong impact on Britain. Although public sentiment initially favoured the colonists, it changed with revelations. The abolitionist debate which had flagged, was <b>galvanised</b> by the deaths of Smith and the 250 slaves. The Martial law in Demerara was lifted on 19 January 1824. In Demerara and Berbice, there was considerable anger towards the missionaries that resulted in their oppression. Demerara's Court of Policy passed an ordinance giving financial assistance to a church that was selected by plantation owners in each district. The Le Resouvenir chapel was seized and taken over by the Anglican Church.|$|E
5|$|Modern historians hold widely varying {{opinions}} of the Crusaders. To some, their conduct was incongruous with the stated aims and implied moral authority of the papacy, {{as evidenced by the}} fact that on occasion the Pope excommunicated Crusaders. Crusaders often pillaged as they travelled, and their leaders generally retained control of captured territory instead of returning it to the Byzantines. During the People's Crusade, thousands of Jews were murdered in what is now called the Rhineland massacres. Constantinople was sacked during the Fourth Crusade. However, the Crusades {{had a profound impact on}} Western civilisation: they reopened the Mediterranean to commerce and travel (enabling Genoa and Venice to flourish); they consolidated the collective identity of the Latin Church under papal leadership; and they constituted a wellspring for accounts of heroism, chivalry, and piety that <b>galvanised</b> medieval romance, philosophy, and literature. The Crusades also reinforced the connection between Western Christendom, feudalism, and militarism.|$|E

5|$|In February 1832 Etty began a {{campaign}} of writing to local York newspapers urging {{the preservation of the}} walls, and sending donations to various campaigns associated with their retention. Although some local newspapers were now supporting preservation in light of the damage their demolition would do to the tourist trade, many locals—whose lives were made more difficult by living in a walled city with few points of entry—remained hostile to the preservation campaigns. A proposal in 1838 by the York and North Midland Railway to cut an archway through the walls to allow access to a railway station within the walls <b>galvanised</b> Etty, and he delivered two lectures on the preservation of the walls during visits to York in 1838–39, and made four paintings of the Bars. Etty's words went unheeded and the archway was duly cut in the walls, much to his dismay, although the station was soon moved to its current location outside the walls to allow through the running of trains to both north and south. While the walls were eventually saved in 1889, many years after Etty's death, Etty is sometimes credited with their salvation. It is open to debate how significant his part was. Some authors feel that his interventions had no impact and the preservation of the walls was the result of decisions made by the Corporation and lobbying by local newspapers, while others feel that the Corporation would not have made these decisions had Etty and other like-minded dignitaries not put pressure on them to do so.|$|E
