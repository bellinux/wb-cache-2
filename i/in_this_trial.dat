5|$|Sheep {{are largely}} grazing herbivores, unlike {{browsing}} {{animals such as}} goats and deer that prefer taller foliage. With a much narrower face, sheep crop plants {{very close to the}} ground and can overgraze a pasture much faster than cattle. For this reason, many shepherds use managed intensive rotational grazing, where a flock is rotated through multiple pastures, giving plants time to recover. Paradoxically, sheep can both cause and solve the spread of invasive plant species. By disturbing the natural state of pasture, sheep and other livestock can pave the way for invasive plants. However, sheep also prefer to eat invasives such as cheatgrass, leafy spurge, kudzu and spotted knapweed over native species such as sagebrush, making grazing sheep effective for conservation grazing. Research conducted in Imperial County, California compared lamb grazing with herbicides for weed control in seedling alfalfa fields. Three trials demonstrated that grazing lambs were just as effective as herbicides in controlling winter weeds. Entomologists also compared grazing lambs to insecticides for insect control in winter alfalfa. <b>In</b> <b>this</b> <b>trial,</b> lambs provided insect control as effectively as insecticides.|$|E
5|$|During World War II, Burnet's {{research}} {{moved to}} influenza and scrub typhus. With {{the outbreak of}} war, Burnet was handed more responsibility and made acting director and had to oversee the move into a new building as Kellaway was seconded to the military in 1939. Due to Kellaway, many of the infectious disease problems afflicting the military were referred to the institute. Fearing {{a repeat of the}} massive global influenza outbreak that occurred after World War I, Burnet focused the institute in the search for a vaccine. He first tested the vaccine on a group of medical students, and after a promising test on 107 army volunteers in February 1942 following a rise in infections, a large-scale program was introduced two months later to inoculate all new recruits after an influenza A outbreak. <b>In</b> <b>this</b> <b>trial,</b> 20,000 personnel were vaccinated, without success, and the scheme was abandoned. In 1942, the investigations into scrub typhus accelerated after an exodus of researchers in that field from Malaya after the Japanese conquest of the area. However, this ended in tragedy when his collaborator Dora Lush accidentally injected herself and then died of the infection. Nevertheless, his work on immunisation had earned him international recognition by this time.|$|E

They were charged with having participated in or planned or facilitated the execution of the numerous war crimes and atrocities committed in countries occupied by the German forces during the war.|$|E
25|$|As {{part of a}} {{joint venture}} with Vattenfall, a Swedish energy company, Volvo {{converted}} two Volvo V70 to diesel-electric plug-in hybrid demonstrators that have been in field testing in Göteborg, Sweden, since December 2009.

25|$|In 1929, {{the first}} {{recorded}} attempt at immunocontraception {{was made by}} Morris Baskin, clinical director of the Denver Maternal Hygiene Committee. <b>In</b> <b>this</b> <b>trial</b> 20 women who were known {{to have at least}} 1 prior pregnancy were injected with their husband's semen, and no conception was recorded in 1 year of observation of these couples. A United States patent (number 2103240) was issued in 1937 for this approach as a contraceptive, but no product for widespread consumption ever came from this approach.|$|E

25|$|In April 2008, McDonald's {{announced}} that 11 of its Sheffield, England restaurants {{have been engaged}} in a biomass trial that had cut its waste and carbon footprint by half in the area. <b>In</b> <b>this</b> <b>trial,</b> wastes from the restaurants were collected by Veolia Environmental Services and were used to produce energy at a power plant. McDonald's plans to expand this project, although the lack of biomass power plants in the United States will prevent this plan from becoming a national standard anytime soon. In addition, in Europe, McDonald's has been recycling vegetable grease by converting it to fuel for its diesel trucks.|$|E
25|$|On 1 June 2009, Volvo {{announced}} {{the launching of}} series production diesel-electric plug-in hybrids by 2012.

25|$|Mirabeau, who {{was still}} facing {{financial}} trouble and increasing debt, could {{not keep up with}} the expensive lifestyle to which his wife was accustomed, and their extravagances forced his father to send him into semi-exile in the country, where he wrote his earliest extant work, the Essai sur le despotisme. The couple had a son who died early, mostly due to the poor living conditions they were experiencing at that time. Then his wife asked for judicial separation in 1782. She was defended by Jean-Étienne-Marie Portalis, who later became one of the editors of the Civil Code. Mirabeau defended his own cause <b>in</b> <b>this</b> <b>trial</b> but lost, holding resentment against Portalis forever.|$|E

25|$|Experiments on {{negative}} priming {{consist of}} two main components: prime and probe. Prime trial tries to mimic real life experiences of distractor stimuli in target selection {{but with more}} repetition to get quantifiable negative priming data. It comprises the initial presentation and the repetitive trials of the target and the distractor stimuli. It is set up such that a set of distractor stimuli are constantly ignored {{in the process of}} target selection. In the previous example provided, prime refers to the repeated perception of the blue pen as the distractor. Probe trial in an experiment refers to the actual testing for negative priming effects. <b>In</b> <b>this</b> <b>trial,</b> the repeated distractor of the prime trial is presented as the target. The reaction time of the response for the probe target (prime distractor) is measured to quantify the negative priming effect.|$|E
25|$|Vaginally dosed {{progesterone}} {{is being}} investigated as potentially beneficial in preventing preterm birth in women at risk for preterm birth. The initial study by Fonseca suggested that vaginal progesterone could prevent preterm birth in women {{with a history of}} preterm birth. According to a recent study, women with a short cervix that received hormonal treatment with a progesterone gel had their risk of prematurely giving birth reduced. The hormone treatment was administered vaginally every day {{during the second half of}} a pregnancy. A subsequent and larger study showed that vaginal progesterone was no better than placebo in preventing recurrent preterm birth in women with a history of a previous preterm birth, but a planned secondary analysis of the data <b>in</b> <b>this</b> <b>trial</b> showed that women with a short cervix at baseline in the trial had benefit in two ways: a reduction in births less than 32 weeks and a reduction in both the frequency and the time their babies were in intensive care.|$|E
25|$|Children are {{generally}} afforded the basic rights embodied by the Constitution, as enshrined by the Fourteenth Amendment to the United States Constitution. The Equal Protection Clause of that amendment {{is to apply}} to children, born within a marriage or not, but excludes children not yet born. This was reinforced by the landmark US Supreme Court decision of In re Gault (1967). <b>In</b> <b>this</b> <b>trial</b> 15-year-old Gerald Gault of Arizona {{was taken into custody}} by local police after being accused of making an obscene telephone call. He was detained and committed to the Arizona State Industrial School until he reached the age of 21 for making an obscene phone call to an adult neighbor. In an 8–1 decision, the Court ruled that in hearings which could result in commitment to an institution, people under the age of 18 have the right to notice and counsel, to question witnesses, and to protection against self-incrimination. The Court found that the procedures used in Gault's hearing met none of these requirements.|$|E

500|$|The {{next phase}} of the myth begins when the adult Horus {{challenges}} Set for the throne of Egypt. The contest between them is often violent but is also described as a legal judgment before the Ennead, an assembled group of Egyptian deities, to decide who should inherit the kingship. The judge <b>in</b> <b>this</b> <b>trial</b> may be Geb, who, {{as the father of}} Osiris and Set, held the throne before they did, or it may be the creator gods Ra or Atum, the originators of kingship.

500|$|Not {{long after}} the Goode case came the sensational trial of Professor John White Webster {{in the murder of}} George Parkman, a crime that took place at the Harvard Medical School in November 1849. [...] The trial {{received}} nationwide coverage, and the prosecution case was based on evidence that was either circumstantial (complicated by the fact that a complete corpse was not found), or founded on new types of evidence (forensic dentistry was used for the first time <b>in</b> <b>this</b> <b>trial).</b> [...] Furthermore, Massachusetts Supreme Judicial Court Chief Justice Lemuel Shaw was widely criticized for bias in the instructions he gave to the jury. [...] Briggs was petitioned to commute Webster's sentence by death penalty opponents, and even threatened with physical harm if he did not. [...] He refused however, stating that the evidence in the case was clear (especially after Webster gave a confession), {{and that there was no}} reason to doubt that the court had acted with due and proper diligence.|$|E
500|$|In the [...] "Inside the Episode" [...] {{featurette}} {{published by}} HBO following the airing of the episode, David Benioff {{spoke about the}} revelation in King's Landing, and Tommen's decision to abolish [...] "trial by combat," [...] stating [...] "This moment is a grievous blow for Cersei because she's been counting on trial by combat really {{since the end of}} season five. This was always her ace in the hole, the Mountain was never going to lose a trial by combat there's no one out there who could beat him. And then Tommen takes it away from her and knowing really what he's doing. He might be a weak King, but he's not an idiot, he understands that this move is going to mean that she's probably not going to fare that well <b>in</b> <b>this</b> <b>trial.</b> So it's a pretty devastating moment for Cersei, and you see that in her reaction, and partly because it just bodes so ill for this coming trial, and partly because it's her own son who's really betrayed her." ...|$|E
500|$|On 24 March 1603, ElizabethI died. JamesVI of Scotland set out {{to claim}} the English throne, taking the title James I, and the Cokes {{immediately}} began ingratiating themselves with the new monarch and his family.

Elizabeth and her husband would retain the queen's affection and trust". Coke attended divine service with the new king on 22 May, who, following the service, took a sword from his bodyguard and knighted Coke. Coke was reconfirmed as Attorney General under James, and immediately found himself dealing with [...] "a series of treasons, whether real or imaginary". The first of these was the trial of Sir Walter Raleigh; according to Cuthbert William Johnson, one of Coke's biographers, [...] "There is, perhaps, no reported case in which the proofs against the prisoner were weaker than <b>in</b> <b>this</b> <b>trial...</b> never was an accused person condemned on slighter grounds".|$|E
