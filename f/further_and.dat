5|$|Should the named storm intensify <b>further</b> <b>and</b> reach winds {{speeds of}} 48knots (89km/h, 55mph), {{then it will}} be {{classified}} as a severe tropical storm.

Should a tropical cyclone intensify <b>further</b> <b>and</b> reach wind speeds of 90knots (166km/h, 103mph), it will be classified as an intense tropical cyclone.
