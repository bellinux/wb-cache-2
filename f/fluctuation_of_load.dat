30|$|A novel optimal {{scheduling}} method considering {{demand response}} is proposed for power systems incorporating with large scale wind power. The proposed method can jointly dispatch the energy resources and demand side resources {{to mitigate the}} <b>fluctuation</b> <b>of</b> <b>load</b> and wind power output. It is noticed in practical operation that, without customer’s satisfaction being considered, customers might reject the too frequent or violent demand response all together. In this case, two indices that measure the customer satisfaction are then introduced as constraints to reduce the impact to end-users and avoid extreme demand adjustment. To make the model solvable, a proximate decoupling technique is used to dispose the concave constraint introduced by the customer satisfaction constraints. Results from the case {{studies show that the}} proposed model can significantly reduce the operation cost of power system while the demand response meets customer satisfaction. Especially, the total start-up costs of conventional thermal units decreases dramatically due to less start-up times. Moreover, compared to the consumption way satisfaction constraint, the payment satisfaction constraint has a heavier influence on the cost.|$|E

The latest technological advancements in wind energy conversion and an increased support from governmental and private institutions have led to increased wind power generation in recent years. Wind power is the fastest growing renewable source of electrical energy hence it has become necessary to address problems associated with maintaining a stable electric power system. Unlike conventional sources, wind does not provide reactive power, which is necessary to maintain acceptable voltage conditions on the network. The use of Flexible AC Transmission Systems (FACTS) in distribution network to compensate for vagaries such as production related to wind energies and to control the voltage is an optimal solution.

40|$|This thesis {{involves}} {{the area of}} virtualization. We have studied about improving load balancing in data center by using automated live migration techniques. The main idea is to migrate virtual machine(s) automatically from high loaded hosts to less loaded hosts with efficiency. The successful implementation can help administrator of data center maintain a load-balanced environment with less effort than before. For example, such a system can automatically identify hotspots and coldspots in a large data center and also decide which virtual machine to migrate, and which host should the machine be migrated to. We have implemented previously developed Push and Pull strategies on a real testbed for Xen and KVM. A new strategy, Hybrid, which is the combination of Push and Pull, has been created. All scripts applied in the experiments are Python-based for further integration to the orchestration framework OpenStack. By implementing the algorithms on a real testbed, we have solved a node failure problem in the algorithms, which was not detected previously through simulation. The results from simulation and those from testbed are similar. E. g. Push strategy has quick responses when the load is medium to high, while Pull strategy has quick responses when the load is low to medium. The Hybrid strategy behaves similar to Push strategy with high load and to Pull strategy with low load, but with greater number of migration attempts, and it responds quickly regardless to the load. The results also show that our strategies are able to handle different incidents such as burst, drain, or <b>fluctuation</b> <b>of</b> <b>load</b> over time. The comparison of results from different hypervisors, i. e., Xen and KVM, shows that both hypervisors conduct {{in the same way}} when applying same strategies in the same environment.

30|$|Short-term {{power load}} {{forecasting}} (STLF) {{is one of}} the key technologies to achieve the observability and controllability of a strong smart grid. The ever-increasing supply of distributed power, the use of renewable energy, and the establishment of new grid systems have raised an urgent need for accurate and effective load forecasting. During the past few decades, several STLF methods, including traditional and artificial intelligence methods, have been proposed [1, 2]. Traditional techniques, including linear regression, auto regressive moving average (ARMA) [3], grey model [4], Kalman filter-based methods, etc., use a mathematical model to map the features to the load consumption so as to make predictions. However, the relationship between <b>fluctuation</b> <b>of</b> <b>load</b> and exogenous factors is complex and nonlinear, which makes it extremely difficult for us to build a precise model. In recent years, artificial intelligence methods, such as fuzzy regression models [5], ensemble forecasting method [6], artificial neural network (ANN) [7, 8] and support vector machines (SVMs) [9, 10], have been widely used to forecast electricity loads. ANN is based on multilayered perceptrons and has a good performance on time series forecasting. Several different types of ANNs, including radial basis function (RBF) neural networks [11], back propagation (BP) neural network and fuzzy neural networks [12] are also used in load forecasting. However, the computational speed of ANN is not fast enough, and its solution is sometimes easily trapped into a local optimum. The SVM, which was proposed by Vapnik, is a novel powerful machine learning method based on statistical learning theory. It can effectively avoid the overfitting problem in ANN. Since the SVM problem is a convex quadratic programming problem, it can always obtain a unique and globally optimal solution. SVM was originally designed for classification problems and has achieved good performances. With the introduction of Vatnik’s insensitive loss function, a modified SVM, which is called support vector regression (SVR) was proposed. Recently, SVR has been applied to various applications, such as battery remaining useful life estimation [13], natural gas demand prediction [14], etc., and has shown excellent performance. SVR has also been widely used in load forecasting.|$|E
