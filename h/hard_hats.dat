25|$|There {{have been}} {{documented}} instances {{of the presence of}} young children at hazardous construction sites, {{due to a lack of}} child care facilities for women workers living and working in the labour camp style work sites. Furthermore, workers on the site of the main Commonwealth stadium have reportedly been issued with <b>hard</b> <b>hats,</b> yet most work in open-toed sandals and live in cramped tin tenements in which illnesses are rife. The High Court of Delhi is presently hearing a public interest petition relating to employers not paying employees for overtime and it has appointed a four-member committee to submit a report on the alleged violations of workers rights.|$|E

Thus, the session starting on 1 September was moved to the Brussels hemicycle. Parliament was expected to move back to Strasbourg for the session starting on 22 September but had to remain in Brussels for that session as well as safety inspections dragged on. The event was greeted with joy by those who oppose the Parliament's presence in Strasbourg, and mocked by eurosceptics who wore <b>hard</b> <b>hats</b> to the first plenary in Brussels after the incident (if Parliament had been sitting at the time, the collapsing ceiling would have hit members of the eurosceptic parties).|$|E

They were driven in a convoy of white limousines, led by a gold limo, to Heston Service Station where they were handed a press release and £1650 in crisp new £50 notes. The accompanying press release stated that 25 x £1600 collectively made up the £40000 K Foundation prize, and that the extra £50 was for the witness to verify its authenticity by spending it. The witnesses were dressed in fluorescent orange <b>hard</b> <b>hats</b> and safety jackets.|$|E
500|$|There were {{numerous}} plans and proposals {{to replace the}} original band shell beginning {{almost as soon as}} the Festival began. [...] Among the most prominent was a post-WWII (1946) plan to have a fifteen-thousand-seat butterfly-design retractible canopy band shell on the block immediately east of the Art Institute of Chicago that eventually came to host the second incarnation of the Petrillo Music Shell. In 1953 a referendum was almost held on the November 3 Election Day ballot for a $3 million ($) structure, but at the last minute a bond issue was denied. In 1963, a plan for a ten thousand seat music bowl was propounded. [...] By the 1970s the original bandshell had deteriorated to the point where [...] "stagehands, performers and even a grand piano had fallen through the stage floor." [...] Amid the catastrophes, the musicians joked about the need for <b>hard</b> <b>hats.</b> [...] Despite $77,000 ($) in 1977 repair expenditures by the city, the performers were considering cancelling the 1978 season.|$|E

500|$|Since 1978, Gabriel had {{composed}} all of {{his music}} at Ashcombe House, including his fourth studio album Peter Gabriel or [...] "Security" [...] (1982) and the Birdy (1984) soundtrack. An inexpensive studio existed in the house's adjacent barn, consisting of two rooms, one where Gabriel would produce his vocals and work on lyrics, and another where the music would be assembled. When preparing for So, Gabriel considered Chic's Nile Rodgers and Bill Laswell as potential producers. He eventually asked his Birdy collaborator, Daniel Lanois, to stay at Ashcombe and work with him further. Rehearsals began in May 1985 and consisted of Gabriel, Lanois and guitarist David Rhodes. Gabriel had begun work on some songs and provided Lanois and Rhodes with chord structures, around which they built their own improvised compositions. Lanois recalled they had [...] "a nice starting point [...] {{in that kind of}} scenario, it's {{not a good idea to}} have a lot of people around because you get nervous that you're wasting other people's time". Consequently, there was a relaxed atmosphere surrounding these sessions and the trio would jokingly refer to themselves as The Three Stooges, an American vaudeville act of the mid-twentieth century. This also involved the wearing of construction site <b>hard</b> <b>hats</b> as they had a [...] "turning up for work humour". As sessions grew, engineer Kevin Killen, bassist Tony Levin, and drummer Jerry Marotta became significant contributors, and were aided by percussionists Manu Katché and Stewart Copeland and violinist L. Shankar.|$|E
500|$|In 1983, {{a class-action}} lawsuit was {{filed against the}} Trump Organization, {{concerning}} unpaid labor union pension and medical obligations. Trump testified in 1990 that he was unaware that 200 undocumented Polish immigrants, some of whom lived at the site during a 1980 transit strike and worked round-the-clock shifts, {{were involved in the}} destruction of the Bonwit Teller building and the Trump Tower project. Trump said that he rarely visited the demolition site and never noticed the laborers, who were known as the [...] "Polish Brigade" [...] and who were visually distinct for their lack of <b>hard</b> <b>hats.</b> A labor consultant and FBI informant testified that Trump was aware of the illegal workers' status. In testimony, Trump stated that he and an executive used the pseudonym [...] "John Baron" [...] in some of his business dealings, although Trump said that he did not do so until years after Trump Tower was constructed. A labor lawyer testified that he was threatened over the phone with a $100 million lawsuit by a John Baron who supposedly worked for the Trump Organization. Donald Trump later told a reporter, [...] "Lots of people use pen names. Ernest Hemingway used one." [...] A judge ruled in favor of the Polish laborers in 1991, saying that the organization had to pay the workers. The case went through several appeals from both sides as well as non-jury trials, and was reassigned to different judges several times. At one point, it was compared by a presiding judge to Jarndyce and Jarndyce, the seemingly unending case that forms the backbone of Charles Dickens' Bleak House. The lawsuit was ultimately settled in 1999, with its records sealed.|$|E

On very large projects involving a number of companies, employees of the same company may wear the same color hat.|$|R

40|$|This thesis {{explains}} how the <b>Hard</b> <b>Hat</b> Riot provides {{a link between}} two of the most significant developments in postwar American history: the decline of the white working-class {{and the rise of the}} Reagan Democrat. The <b>Hard</b> <b>Hat</b> Riot was the culmination of two decades of local demographic and economic transformations as well as five years of political neglect that marginalized New York City’s white working-class. The influence of the riot, however, extended beyond the city’s five boroughs. The <b>Hard</b> <b>Hat</b> Riot prompted Richard Nixon’s administration to develop a blue-collar strategy for the 1972 election. Ronald Reagan’s presidential campaigns in 1980 and 1984 emulated Nixon’s plan to successfully court the white working-class voters who would be later called Reagan Democrats...|$|R
