5|$|At 17:00 on 24 September, as Puller's men <b>hiked</b> <b>up</b> the {{northeast}} slope of Mount Austen, they surprised {{and killed a}} bivouac of 16 Japanese soldiers. The noise from the skirmish alerted several companies of Oka's Maizuru Battalion, who were emplaced nearby. The Maizuru troops quickly attacked Puller's Marines, who took cover and returned fire. Acting on Oka's orders, the Japanese slowly disengaged while withdrawing towards the Matanikau River, and the engagement was over by nightfall. The Marines counted 30 dead Japanese and had suffered 13 dead and 25 wounded. Puller radioed headquarters and requested help to evacuate the wounded. Vandegrift replied that he would send the 2nd Battalion, 5th Marine Regiment (2/5) as reinforcements the next day.|$|E

500|$|In 1950, American {{swimsuit}} mogul Fred Cole, {{owner of}} Cole of California, told Time that bikinis {{were designed for}} [...] "diminutive Gallic women", as because [...] "French girls have short legs... swimsuits have to be <b>hiked</b> <b>up</b> at the sides to make their legs look longer." [...] In 1961, The New York Times reported the opinion that the bikini is permissible for people are not [...] "too fat or too thin". In the 1960s etiquette writer Emily Post decreed that [...] " [...] is for perfect figures only, and for the very young." [...] In The Bikini Book by Kelly Killoren Bensimon, swimwear designer Norma Kamali says, [...] "Anyone with a tummy" [...] should not wear a bikini. Since then, a number of bikini designers including Malia Mills have encouraged {{women of all ages}} and body types to take up the style. The 1970s saw the rise of the lean ideal of female body and figures like Cheryl Tiegs. Her figure remained in vogue in the 21st century.|$|E

500|$|In 1950, Time {{magazine}} interviewed American swimsuit mogul Fred Cole, {{owner of}} Cole of California, {{and reported that}} he had [...] "little but scorn for France's famed Bikinis," [...] because they were designed for [...] "diminutive Gallic women". [...] "French girls have short legs," [...] he explained, [...] "Swimsuits have to be <b>hiked</b> <b>up</b> at the sides to make their legs look longer." [...] Réard himself described it as a two-piece bathing suit which [...] "reveals everything about a girl except for her mother's maiden name." [...] Even Esther Williams commented, [...] "A bikini is a thoughtless act." [...] But, popularity of the charms of Pin-up queen and Hollywood star Williams were to vanish along with pre-bikinis with fancy names over the next few decades. Australian designer Paula Straford introduced the bikini to Gold Coast in 1952. In 1957, Das moderne Mädchen (The Modern Girl) wrote, [...] "It is unthinkable that a decent girl with tact would ever wear such a thing." [...] Eight years later a Munich student was punished to six days cleaning work at an old home because she had strolled across the central Viktualienmarkt square, Munich in a bikini.|$|E
