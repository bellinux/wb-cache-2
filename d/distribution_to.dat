In FY 2003, the largest per capita recipient of Hall income tax distributions was Belle Meade, a wealthy enclave in Metropolitan Nashville-Davidson County, which received a per capita distribution of $491.68.

5|$|Monte Testaccio has {{provided}} archaeologists {{with a rare}} insight into the ancient Roman economy. The amphorae deposited in the mound were often labelled with tituli picti, painted or stamped inscriptions which record information such as {{the weight of the}} oil contained in the vessel, the names of the people who weighed and documented the oil {{and the name of the}} district where the oil was originally bottled. This has allowed archaeologists to determine that the oil in the vessels was imported under state authority and was designated for the annona urbis (<b>distribution</b> <b>to</b> the people of Rome) or the annona militaris (<b>distribution</b> <b>to</b> the army). Indeed, some of the inscriptions found on mid-2nd century vessels at Monte Testaccio specifically record that the oil they once contained was delivered to the praefectus annonae, the official in charge of the state-run food distribution service. It is possible that Monte Testaccio was also managed by the praefectus annonae.|$|E

5|$|After {{a public}} meeting in Amlwch to gauge local support, Isle of Anglesey Railways Ltd (IoAR) was {{established}} in 1991 {{with the aim of}} restoring passenger services to the line. Special trains ran from Bangor to a temporary station at Amlwch on the Spring and August bank holidays of 1992, and the 125th anniversary of the line's opening (a total of eight return trips). Pathfinder Tours subsequently ran an excursion from York to Llandudno and Amlwch in October 1993. The project's viability was discussed with the Welsh Development Agency and Anglesey District Council, followed by negotiations in July 1993 with Railfreight <b>Distribution</b> <b>to</b> purchase the line. Octel offered a portion of its private railway for the building of a new station at Amlwch. IoAR initially hoped to start passenger services between Amlwch and Llangefni as early as 1994.|$|E
5|$|An ectomycorrhizal species, S.pungens {{forms an}} {{intimate}} mutualistic relationship between its underground mycelium {{and the young}} roots of the associated host tree. The fungus—limited in <b>distribution</b> <b>to</b> California—fruits almost exclusively with Monterey and bishop pine, two trees with small and scattered natural ranges concentrated in the West Coast of the United States. Several studies have investigated the role of S.pungens in the coastal Californian forest ecosystem it occupies. Although the species produces more fruit bodies than other competing ectomycorrhizal fungi in the same location, {{it is not a}} dominant root colonizer, and occupies {{only a small percentage of}} ectomycorrhizal root tips. The fungus's propensity to fruit prolifically despite minimal root colonization is a result of its ability to efficiently transfer nutrients from its host for its own use.|$|E
5|$|Demand {{for tickets}} by Alabama fans {{was so great}} that the Alabama ticket office accidentally {{oversold}} its allotment of tickets. The office neglected to limit purchases on the forms sent to season-ticket holders, and the office received more than 25,000 orders for its 12,500-ticket allotment. An additional 2,000 tickets were given to Alabama, but the school still had to send out more than 10,000 refunds. Alabama's athletics director was heavily criticized for overselling the ticket allotment and for limiting ticket <b>distribution</b> <b>to</b> fans who had contributed large amounts of money to the athletics department. A group of fans disgruntled at the ticket distribution process eventually levied a class-action lawsuit against the athletic director, claiming contract violations.|$|E

5|$|In 1991, {{a survey}} {{conducted}} for the Library of Congress and the Book-of-the-Month Club asked club members what the most influential book in the respondent's life was.

Rand's books continue to be widely sold and read, with over 29million copies sold as of 2013 (with about 10% of that total purchased for free <b>distribution</b> <b>to</b> schools by the Ayn Rand Institute). In 1998, Modern Library readers voted Atlas Shrugged the 20th century's finest work of fiction, followed by The Fountainhead in second place, Anthem in seventh, and We the Living eighth; none of the four appeared on the critics' list.

Lactarius pseudomucidus is another milk cap with a dark brown cap, but it has a smooth (not velvety) and slimy cap and stem. Another brown-capped eastern North American species is L.gerardii; it has distantly spaced white gills that run down the stem. L.fuliginellus, which prefers to grow near hardwoods, has close gills.|$|E

The variety R.botrytis var. aurantiiramosa, limited in <b>distribution</b> <b>to</b> Lewis County, Washington, associates with Douglas fir (Pseudotsuga menziesii) and western hemlock (Tsuga heterophylla).

5|$|Russula emetica {{is one of}} over 100 red-capped Russula species known worldwide. The related {{beechwood}} sickener (R.nobilis) {{is found}} under beech in Europe. Many, such as the bloody brittlegill (R.sanguinaria), are inedible; this species can be distinguished from R.emetica by the reddish flush in its stem. R.aurea, however, is edible. It has a yellow stem, gills and flesh under its red cap. The edible R.rugulosa—common in mixed woods in the eastern and northern United States—has a wrinkled and pimpled cap cuticle, cream spores, and mild taste. Another inedible species, R.fragilis, has notched gills, and its stem stains blue with naphthol. The uncommon European subspecies R.emetica longipes is distinguished by its longer stem and ochre gills. The paler European mushroom R.betularum, found in coniferous forests and moorland, is sometimes considered a subspecies of R.emetica. R.nana is restricted in <b>distribution</b> <b>to</b> arctic and subarctic highland meadows where dwarf willow (Salix herbacea) or alpine bearberry (Arctostaphylos alpina) are abundant.|$|E
