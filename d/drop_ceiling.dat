5|$|After World War II, North Philadelphia {{suffered}} from the failure of its industries, and the PRR reduced both local and long-distance service due to competition from private autos, further reducing {{the importance of the}} station. Escalators and a new <b>drop</b> <b>ceiling</b> were added around 1955, the former due to the insistence of the city council. The surrounding parking lots and ground were rearranged in 1968.|$|E

25|$|In 2012, Linda Atiyeh {{acquired}} the historic property and began extensive renovations, including removing a <b>drop</b> <b>ceiling</b> to uncover original skylights, un-bricking original windows, installing new electrical, heating/cooling and lighting systems, painting and restoring the exterior storefront, and uncovering and restoring the original wood floor using vintage floor planks reclaimed from a historic building in Kentucky. Gallery 30 opened for {{business in the}} newly restored building at 26-28 York Street in 2013.|$|E
50|$|Modern <b>dropped</b> <b>ceilings</b> were {{initially}} created {{to hide the}} building infrastructure, including piping, wiring, and/or ductwork, by creating a plenum space above the <b>dropped</b> <b>ceiling,</b> while allowing access for repairs and inspections. <b>Drop</b> <b>ceilings</b> may {{also be used to}} hide problems, such as structural damage. Further, <b>drop</b> out <b>ceilings</b> can also conceal the sprinkler systems while still providing full fire suppression functionality.|$|R
50|$|<b>Dropped</b> <b>ceilings</b> {{and ceiling}} tiles {{were being used}} in Japan for {{aesthetic}} reasons {{as early as the}} Muromachi Period (1337 to 1573). Blackfriars Theater in London, England, built in 1596, had <b>dropped</b> <b>ceilings</b> to aid acoustics.|$|R
50|$|The {{most common}} ceiling that {{contributes}} to fire-resistance ratings in commercial and residential construction is the <b>dropped</b> <b>ceiling.</b> In {{the case of a}} <b>dropped</b> <b>ceiling,</b> the rating is achieved by the entire system, which is both the structure above, from which the ceilings is suspended, which could be a concrete floor or a timber floor, as well as the suspension mechanism and, finally the lowest membrane or <b>dropped</b> <b>ceiling.</b> Between the structure that the <b>dropped</b> <b>ceiling</b> is suspended from and the dropped membrane, such as a T-bar ceiling or a layer of drywall, there is often some room for mechanical and electrical piping, wiring and ducting to run.|$|R
25|$|Near {{the south}} exit {{close to the}} main bar, {{opposite}} end of the building from the Cabaret Room, a wedding reception drew to a close around 8:30p.m. in the Zebra Room, near the building's main entrance; some of its guests had complained of the room being excessively warm with loud explosions from beneath the floor, and the group left the building before the end of their allotted time. The room remained vacant from their departure until a minute before 9 p.m., when an employee smelled smoke and opened the Zebra Room's door to confirm the presence of smoke. She asked another employee to call the Fire Department while she and others grabbed any available fire extinguishers and began trying to fight the flames. Though the employees were not aware of it, their opening of the Zebra Room's door allowed enough oxygen into the room to cause what had been a smoldering fire in the room's <b>drop</b> <b>ceiling</b> to flashover and begin to spread rapidly. It quickly became clear that fire extinguishers could not suppress the fast-growing fire. The Fire Department was alerted to the fire at 9:01p.m. and was on the scene by 9:05; as they approached, firefighters on the first emergency vehicles could already see smoke coming from the building.|$|E
500|$|Numerous {{concerns}} and controversies surfaced {{before and during}} the games which received media attention locally and internationally. Delays {{in the construction of the}} Games' venues were linked to corruption involving the Organising Committee. A number of infrastructural problems also occurred; these were highlighted by the collapse of a footbridge and the <b>drop</b> <b>ceiling</b> of the weightlifting venue. Less than two weeks before the opening ceremony, Commonwealth Games chief Mike Fennell wrote to the Indian Cabinet secretary, urging action in response to the Games Village being [...] "seriously compromised." [...] He said that although team officials were impressed with the international zone and main dining area, they were shocked by the state of accommodation. The BBC published photographs of the Games Village depicting the poor state of living quarters.|$|E
2500|$|... {{majority}} of the shoot divided between the twin cities of Minneapolis and St. Paul. Screenwriter Shepherd spent many years working in the Twin Cities, becoming very familiar with {{the area in the}} process. Gross reflected on the city: [...] "Minneapolis is a major player in this film, which {{can be seen in the}} cast, the background players and the locations. It was written for the city." [...] The film was shot in fifty-four days on over thirty locations. Joe Scheffer's workplace was shot at Waterford Towers in Plymouth, Minnesota. Production designer Jackson De Govia transformed the fourth floor of the New Age office building into a <b>drop</b> <b>ceiling</b> corporate environment, which serves as a community to its employees. The Club 13 scenes were filmed at the Grand Hotel Minneapolis, while the karaoke scenes were shot at Grumpy's Bar & Grill, both in Minneapolis. The scenes of Tim Allen and Patrick Warburton racing their shopping carts were shot at the Target store in North St. Paul. The scenes taking place at Scarett's gym were filmed in the city of Richfield. The final playground scene was shot at Central Lutheran School in Saint Paul. [...] Other scenes were shot in the cities of Crystal and St. Paul.|$|E

50|$|Approved Drop out (or drop-out) {{ceilings}} {{allow the}} installation of a <b>dropped</b> <b>ceiling</b> beneath existing fire sprinklers because the tiles, sometimes called melt-out ceiling tiles, are heat sensitive and designed to fall from the <b>dropped</b> <b>ceiling</b> suspension grid {{in the event of}} a fire, allowing the sprinklers to do their job.|$|R

50|$|Lighting {{fixtures}} {{and other devices}} installed in a <b>dropped</b> <b>ceiling</b> are required to be firmly secured to the <b>dropped</b> <b>ceiling</b> framework. In {{the event of a}} fire above a <b>dropped</b> <b>ceiling</b> it is often necessary for firemen to have to pull down the ceiling in a hurry to quickly gain access to the conflagration. Loose fixtures merely resting in the framework by force of gravity can become unseated and swing down on their armorflex power cables to hit the firemen below. Binding the fixtures to the framework assures that if the framework must be pulled down the fixture will come down with it and not become a pendulous swinging hazard to the firemen.|$|R

50|$|On July 10, 2006 at {{approximately}} 11 p.m. four three-ton sections of a concrete <b>drop</b> <b>ceiling</b> inside the I-90 Fort Point Channel tunnel {{leading to the}} Ted Williams Tunnel collapsed. A section of ceiling fell {{on top of a}} car traveling through the connector tunnel, killing 38-year-old passenger Milena Del Valle and slightly injuring her husband Angel Del Valle, who was driving. The cause of the collapse was later determined to be the failure of adhesives connecting a steel tieback suspending the concrete <b>drop</b> <b>ceiling</b> to the main ceiling above.|$|E
50|$|Martinez {{painted a}} mural {{on the walls}} of the Hotel Congress bar Tap Room. A <b>drop</b> <b>ceiling</b> was added to the bar in the 1960s {{covering}} the murals. The mural remain one of Tucson's great lost artworks.|$|E

50|$|Kahn {{left the}} {{carefully}} organized pipes and ducts in the ceilings of each floor fully exposed to view, partly as an architectural statement and partly {{to make it}} easier to reconfigure laboratory equipment when necessary. Several departments installed <b>dropped</b> <b>ceilings</b> anyway; the microbiology labs, which require strict dust control, were especially in need of them. The partitions and <b>dropped</b> <b>ceilings</b> together interfered with the planned air circulation patterns in the towers, a problem that was not resolved until a renovation in the 1980s.|$|R
50|$|The {{main floor}} area {{originally}} had a tiled floor, marble wainscoting, and a marble teller's counter. In the 1960s, the counter was removed, the wainscoting covered with wood paneling, and a <b>drop</b> <b>ceiling</b> installed. The paneling and ceiling was removed during renovations in 1981.|$|E
50|$|Two {{staircases}} in {{the north}} corners of the building reach {{to the third floor}} where a viewing gallery or balcony looked over the second floor courtroom. This gallery and the original courtroom ceiling have been obscured by a new <b>drop</b> <b>ceiling</b> making air conditioning possible.|$|E
50|$|The {{platform}} level {{features a}} vaulted <b>drop</b> <b>ceiling</b> of stained glass. A second {{work of art}} is entitled La Ciudad (The City), which consists of four enameled steel murals placed {{on the walls of}} the four platform stairways. Both artworks were unveiled on January 13, 1999.|$|E
50|$|Acoustic {{balance and}} control was another early {{objective}} of <b>dropped</b> <b>ceilings.</b> A noisy room can overstimulate occupants, while a too quiet interior may seem dull and uninviting.|$|R
50|$|The {{most common}} type of <b>ceiling</b> is the <b>dropped</b> <b>ceiling</b> which is {{suspended}} from structural elements above. Pipework or ducts can be run in the gap above the ceiling, and insulation and fireproofing material can be placed here. Other types of ceiling include the cathedral ceiling, the concave or barrel-shaped ceiling, the stretched ceiling and the coffered ceiling. Coving often links the ceiling to the surrounding walls. Ceilings can play a part in reducing fire hazard, and a system is available for rating the fire resistance of <b>dropped</b> <b>ceilings.</b>|$|R
5000|$|U. S. Patent No. 1,470,728 {{for modern}} <b>dropped</b> <b>ceilings</b> {{was applied for}} by E. E. Hall on May 28, 1919 and granted on October 16, 1923. Initially modern <b>dropped</b> <b>ceilings</b> were built using {{interlocking}} tiles {{and the only way}} to provide access for repair or inspection of the area above the tiles was by starting at the edge of the ceiling, or at a designated [...] "key tile", and then removing contiguous tiles one at a time until the desired place of access was reached. Once the repair or inspection was completed, the tiles had to be reinstalled. This process could be very time-consuming and expensive. On September 8, 1958 Donald A. Brown of Westlake, Ohio filed for a patent for Accessible Suspended Ceiling Construction. This invention provided suspended ceiling construction in which access may readily be obtained at any desired location. Patent Number US 2,984,946 A was granted on May 23, 1961. Brown has sometimes been credited as being the inventor of the <b>dropped</b> <b>ceiling</b> [...] even though other patents preceded his as shown in the table below.|$|R
50|$|High-voltage {{electrical}} equipment (generally regarded as being over 50 volts) is {{not permitted to}} be exposed in the plenum space above a <b>drop</b> <b>ceiling.</b> High voltage wiring must be enclosed in conduit or raceways, and must be physically isolated from low-voltage wiring. High voltage electrical devices similarly must be enclosed in a plenum space, inside a metallic container. Similarly, electrical outlets for domestic powered devices are not permitted inside the plenum space, though outlets can be installed on ceiling tiles inside electrical boxes, with the sockets exposed on the exterior bottom face of the <b>drop</b> <b>ceiling.</b> The purpose of these restrictions is to limit flame spread inside the unseen plenum space, {{in the event of}} high voltage equipment or wiring failure. Low voltage cabling is permitted because current flow is typically negligible so the risk of overheating and fire is limited.|$|E
50|$|A dropped {{ceiling is}} a {{secondary}} ceiling, hung below the main (structural) ceiling. It {{may also be}} referred to as a <b>drop</b> <b>ceiling,</b> T-bar ceiling, false ceiling, suspended ceiling, grid ceiling, drop in ceiling, drop out ceiling, or ceiling tiles and is a staple of modern construction and architecture in both residential and commercial applications.|$|E
50|$|At {{the time}} of the NRHP Application (1989), the building's {{interior}} was essentially unchanged from the original construction. There were two exceptions: (1) the original wood floor had been covered with carpet, and (2) the original plastered ceiling had been concealed by a <b>drop</b> <b>ceiling</b> with fluorescent fixtures. Both of these had been installed in the 1980s.|$|E
50|$|Shortly {{prior to}} 1992, the {{gatehouse}} underwent a significant renovation. The ceiling {{in the office}} was covered by a <b>dropped</b> <b>ceiling</b> of sound-dampening tiles, and {{the north and east}} entrances to the building were closed off.|$|R
2500|$|On 18 January 2010, an MU-2-2B-60 {{crashed in}} Ohio on {{approach}} to Lorain County Regional Airport, killing the two pilots and both passengers. [...] The passengers were 89-year-old Don Brown, inventor of a grid system for mounting <b>dropped</b> <b>ceilings,</b> and his wife.|$|R
50|$|The church {{building}} {{was added to}} the National Register of Historic Places in 2005. At the time of the listing, there were plans to remove carpet, fake pine paneling, and a <b>dropped</b> <b>ceiling</b> that had been installed in the church interior around 1970.|$|R
