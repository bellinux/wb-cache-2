5|$|In battle, {{players can}} perform {{multiple}} actions: walking or running along a <b>fixed</b> <b>axis,</b> freely {{running around the}} battlefield, jumping in any direction, guarding against attacks, and pausing the battle to select a different enemy to attack. Characters can launch various attacks, from standard strikes to strikes that can interrupt enemy attacks. The player character's attacks can be chained together to create combo attacks, which create a continual flow of attacks without giving the enemy a chance to attack. Continual strikes activate the change for a Fatal Strike, which kills normal enemies and heavily damages bosses. Landing successive Fatal Strikes grants bonuses {{at the end of}} the battle. During battle, landing successive strikes without taking hits fill an Over Limit meter. Once the meter is full, the player character can perform continual attacks and cast Artes without casting time during the Over Limit's duration. During battles, Secret Mission can be triggered by performing unspecified actions. Completing Secret Missions grants a bonus to the battle grade or acquire an item. All characters can use Artes, special physical and magical abilities which can range from standard attacks to healing magic. Learned by leveling up a character, Artes can be both specifically directed and have a general area of effect. Four Artes can be assigned to each character, and each Arte can be assigned to a hot key. Some Artes can be used outside battle to cure characters. In addition to standard Artes, each character can access Mystic Arts, extra-powerful cinematic attacks.|$|E

25|$|In {{the case}} of {{rotation}} around a <b>fixed</b> <b>axis</b> of a rigid body that is not negligibly small compared to the radius of the path, each particle of the body describes a uniform circular motion with the same angular velocity, but with velocity and acceleration varying with the position {{with respect to the}} axis.|$|E
25|$|A torque is not {{necessarily}} limited to rotation around a <b>fixed</b> <b>axis,</b> however. It may change the magnitude and/or direction of the angular momentum vector, depending on the angle between the velocity vector and the non-radial component of the force vector, as viewed in the pivot's frame of reference. A net torque on a spinning body therefore {{may result in a}} precession without necessarily causing a change in spin rate.|$|E
25|$|In physics, {{circular}} motion {{is a movement}} of an object along the circumference of a circle or rotation along a circular path. It can be uniform, with constant angular rate of rotation and constant speed, or non-uniform with a changing rate of rotation. The rotation around a <b>fixed</b> <b>axis</b> of a three-dimensional body involves {{circular motion}} of its parts. The equations of motion describe {{the movement of the}} center of mass of a body.|$|E

40|$|Abstract. General {{kinematics}} simulation is {{only for}} regular mechanism about turning in <b>fix</b> <b>axis,</b> shifting on plane {{as well as their}} compound motions. However, there is no mature technique supporting kinematic simulation for those mechanisms depending on clearance operation such as lorry couplers. Considering such irregularly mechanism, authors proposed a method based on collision kinematics simulation, and combining structure analysis as well as virtual assembly in Pro/Engineer. According to methods above, authors implemented three postures of coupler operation kinematics simulation, as well as the reliability avaluation for anti-creep of coupler function. This method supplies a practical solution for irregular machine kinematics simulation...|$|R

25|$|The {{end result}} of any {{sequence}} of rotations of any object in 3D about a fixed point is always equivalent to a rotation about an axis. However, an object may physically rotate in 3D about a fixed point {{on more than one}} axis simultaneously, in which case there is no single <b>fixed</b> <b>axis</b> of rotation - just the fixed point. However, these two descriptions can be reconciled - such a physical motion can always be re-described in terms of a single axis of rotation, provided the orientation of that axis relative to the object is allowed to change moment by moment.|$|E
25|$|One notable feature, {{related to}} the number of simple bivectors and so {{rotation}} planes, is that in odd dimensions every rotation has a <b>fixed</b> <b>axis</b> – it is misleading to call it an axis of rotation as in higher dimensions rotations are taking place in multiple planes orthogonal to it. This is related to bivectors, as bivectors in odd dimensions decompose into the same number of bivectors as the even dimension below, so have the same number of planes, but one extra dimension. As each plane generates rotations in two dimensions in odd dimensions there must be one dimension, that is an axis, that is not being rotated.|$|E
25|$|Bivectors {{are also}} related to the {{rotation}} matrix in n dimensions. As in three dimensions the characteristic equation of the matrix can be solved to find the eigenvalues. In odd dimensions this has one real root, with eigenvector the <b>fixed</b> <b>axis,</b> and in even dimensions it has no real roots, so either all or {{all but one of}} the roots are complex conjugate pairs. Each pair is associated with a simple component of the bivector associated with the rotation. In particular the log of each pair is ± the magnitude, while eigenvectors generated from the roots are parallel to and so can be used to generate the bivector. In general the eigenvalues and bivectors are unique, and the set of eigenvalues gives the full decomposition into simple bivectors; if roots are repeated then the decomposition of the bivector into simple bivectors is not unique.|$|E
40|$|AbstractIn 1947 Grioli {{discovered}} that an asymmetric heavy rigid body moving about a fixed point can perform a regular precession, {{which is the}} rotation of the body about an <b>axis</b> <b>fixed</b> in it, while that axis precesses with the same uniform angular velocity about a non-vertical <b>axis</b> <b>fixed</b> in space. In the present note, we show that a magnetized asymmetric rigid body moving about a fixed point while acted upon by uniform gravity and magnetic fields can perform a regular precession about a horizontal <b>axis</b> <b>fixed</b> in space orthogonal to the magnetic field. This motion does not contain Grioli's as a special case since the gravity and magnetic effects are coupled and can vanish only simultaneously...|$|R

25|$|The {{purpose of}} the Phenomena is to give an {{introduction}} to the constellations, with the rules for their risings and settings; and of the circles of the sphere, amongst which the Milky Way is reckoned. The positions of the constellations, north of the ecliptic, are described by reference to the principal groups surrounding the north pole (Ursa Major, Ursa Minor, Draco, and Cepheus), whilst Orion serves as a point of departure for those to the south. The immobility of the earth, and the revolution of the sky about a <b>fixed</b> <b>axis</b> are maintained; the path of the sun in the zodiac is described; but the planets are introduced merely as bodies having a motion of their own, without any attempt to define their periods; nor is anything said about the moon's orbit. The opening of the poem asserts the dependence of all things upon Zeus. From the lack of precision in the descriptions, it would seem that Aratus was neither a mathematician nor observer or, at any rate, that in this work he did not aim at scientific accuracy. He not only represents the configurations of particular groups incorrectly, but describes some phenomena which are inconsistent with any one supposed latitude of the spectator, and others which could not coexist at any one epoch. These errors are partly to be attributed to Eudoxus himself, and partly {{to the way in which}} Aratus has used the materials supplied by him. Hipparchus (about a century later), who was a scientific astronomer and observer, has left a commentary upon the Phenomenas of Eudoxus and Aratus, accompanied by the discrepancies which he had noticed between his own observations and their descriptions.|$|E

It is driven in a circular motion by a spring-loaded arm pushed back by the water stream which returns to "impact" the stream. The water stream can thus rotate around a <b>fix</b> <b>axis.</b> Analogously in our universe, the outflow or jet formed by the relativistic plasma corresponds to the water stream of a sprinkler; and the baryons in the tilted outer accretion disc or torus {{play the role of}} "impact arm". Then the jet aligning with the inner parts of a warped disc can directly "touch" the outer region of the disc. The resultant collision between such rapid leptons and slow baryons automatically accounts for the main features of broad-line region of active galactic nuclei. Moreover, it naturally provides a channel of dissipating the angular momentum of an accretion disc, which has long been a problem in theory of accretion disc.

2500|$|How then, are [...] "fictitious" [...] {{forces to}} be {{separated}} from [...] "real" [...] forces? It is hard to apply the Newtonian definition of an inertial frame without this separation. For example, consider a stationary object in an inertial frame. Being at rest, no net force is applied. But in a frame rotating about a <b>fixed</b> <b>axis,</b> the object appears to move in a circle, and is subject to centripetal force (which is made up of the Coriolis force and the centrifugal force). How can we decide that the rotating frame is a non-inertial frame? There are two approaches to this resolution: one approach is to look for the origin of the fictitious forces (the Coriolis force and the centrifugal force). We will find there are no sources for these forces, no associated force carriers, no originating bodies. A second approach is to look at a variety of frames of reference. For any inertial frame, the Coriolis force and the centrifugal force disappear, so application of the principle of special relativity would identify these frames where the forces disappear as sharing the same and the simplest physical laws, and hence rule that the rotating frame is not an inertial frame.|$|E
