The 2005 Zimbabwe parliamentary {{elections were}} held on 31 March and multiple claims of vote rigging, election fraud and <b>intimidation</b> {{were made by}} the MDC and Jonathan Moyo, calling for investigations into 32 of the 120 constituencies. Jonathan Moyo participated in the elections despite the allegations and won a seat as an independent member of Parliament.|$|E

5|$|Alternatively, Pachycephalosaurus {{and other}} pachycephalosaurid genera may {{have engaged in}} flank-butting during {{intraspecific}} combat. In this scenario, an individual may have stood roughly parallel or faced a rival directly, using <b>intimidation</b> displays to cow its rival. If <b>intimidation</b> failed, the Pachycephalosaurus would bend its head downward and to the side, striking the rival pachycephalosaur on its flank. This hypothesis {{is supported by the}} relatively broad torso of most pachycephalosaurs, which would have protected vital organs from trauma. The flank-butting theory was first proposed by Sues in 1978, and expanded upon by Ken Carpenter in 1997.|$|E

5|$|In mid-1932, Himmler {{appointed}} Heydrich {{chief of}} the renamed security service—the Sicherheitsdienst (SD). Heydrich's counterintelligence service grew into an effective machine of terror and <b>intimidation.</b> With Hitler striving for absolute power in Germany, Himmler and Heydrich wished to control the political police forces of all 17 German states. They began with Bavaria. In 1933, Heydrich gathered some of his men from the SD and together they stormed police headquarters in Munich and took over the organisation using <b>intimidation</b> tactics. Himmler became the Munich police chief and Heydrich became the commander of Department IV, the political police.|$|E

50|$|Macedonian journalists {{also face}} verbal threats and {{physical}} assoults which have increased since 2015 along with political and inter-ethnic violence. There are unsolved cases of physical attacks which are highly problematic for media freedom since such <b>intimidations</b> have {{a chilling effect}} on freedom of expression and cause self-censorship and soft censorship.|$|R

5|$|Alfhems {{success in}} evading the {{quarantine}} led to Washington escalating its <b>intimidation</b> of Guatemala through its navy. On 24 May, the U.S. launched Operation HARDROCK BAKER, a naval blockade of Guatemala. Ships and submarines patrolled the Guatemalan coasts, and all approaching ships were stopped and searched; these included ships from Britain and France, violating international law. However Britain and France did not protest very strongly, hoping that in return the U.S. would {{not interfere with}} their efforts to subdue rebellious colonies in the Middle East. The <b>intimidation</b> was not solely naval; on 26 May one of Castillo Armas' planes flew over the capital, dropping leaflets that exhorted people to struggle against communism and support Castillo Armas.|$|E

5|$|Although a {{judicial}} system still existed in Buenos Aires, Rosas removed any independence the courts might have exercised, either by controlling appointments to the judiciary, or by circumventing their authority entirely. He {{would sit in}} judgement over cases, issuing sentences which included fines, service in the army, imprisonment, or execution. The exercise of state terror {{as a tool of}} <b>intimidation</b> was restricted to Rosas himself; his subordinates had no control over it. It was used against specific targets, rather than randomly. Terrorism was orchestrated rather than a product of popular zeal, was targeted for effect rather than indiscriminate. Anarchic demonstrations, vigilantism and disorderliness were antithetical to a regime touting a law and order agenda. Foreigners were exempted from abuses, as were people too poor or inconsequential to serve as effective examples. Victims were selected for their usefulness as tools of <b>intimidation.</b>|$|E
5|$|Bell {{was elected}} as the Member of Parliament for North Durham from February to June 1874, and for The Hartlepools from 1875 to 1880. He lost {{his seat in}} North Durham in 1874 {{on the grounds that}} his agents were guilty of <b>intimidation.</b>|$|E

40|$|There are {{all sorts}} of contradictions and <b>intimidations</b> between {{urbanization}} and environment objectively. The <b>intimidations</b> of urbanization in arid area mainly come from the growth of resource consumption, the aggravation of environmental pollution and the sprawling expansion of urban land. The restrictions of environment mainly come from the resource condition, the environmental capacity and the ecological menace. The case study of He-Xi Corridor shows that the grey relational degrees between urbanization and environment of the industry-oriented cities are high, of the agriculture-oriented cities are low and of the tourism-oriented cities are relatively high. The changing trends of coupling degrees of He-Xi Corridor and the cities are not unanimous with that of urbanization or environment totally. They embody the coupling state changes of urbanization and environment. In order to realize the harmonious development with environment in arid area, urbanization should change its traditional developmental ideas and pay much attention to water resources and environment...|$|R

He took three wickets at 71.66, and opened the bowling {{in some of the}} matches due to Australia's lack of fast bowling. It {{was a far cry from}} the <b>intimidation</b> that Bodyline provided.|$|E
5|$|The Committee to Protect Journalists, Proceso magazine, {{and several}} journalists and press freedom {{organizations}} have complained about irregularities {{in the investigation}} and question {{the legitimacy of the}} whole case.

50|$|The Azerbaijani {{government}} {{has increased its}} control over the internet, harassing social media activists, bloggers and online journalists. The email and telephone communications of journalists have been denounced as under surveillance. Real-life <b>intimidations</b> are used to deter online criticism, rather than content blocking. Legal norms criminalising online defamation have deterred social media mobilisation too, together with the arrests of bloggers and activists. DDoS attacks against independent outlets such as Azadliq and RFE/RL have been reported.|$|R
5000|$|He was {{involved}} in election fraud and <b>intimidations,</b> Keng Vannsak recalled: The evil genius behind the repression was Sam Sary—a bestial man. As an investigating magistrate in the 1940s, he had beaten suspects to death with his own hands. Then he went study in France. In 1955, he joined the Sangkum and became Sihanouk's closest aide ... After Sihanouk decided to use strong-arm tactics, Sary handed out money and arms to hire ruffians to come and break our meetings.|$|R

5|$|These birds forage on {{the ground}} or in vegetation; they also fly down from a perch to capture food. While foraging, they {{frequently}} spread their wings in a peculiar two-step motion to display the white patches.

5|$|Goebbels, however, used {{not only}} <b>intimidation</b> but also cajoling and {{generosity}} {{to achieve his}} goals.

When asked to approve this amount, Goebbels did so citing the importance of the film and the need for a high-caliber cast to ensure its success.|$|E

As he wrote an even harsher letter to Ceaușescu, Goma was excluded from the Writers' Union, arrested and attacked {{in a variety of}} magazines such as Săptămâna, Luceafărul and Contemporanul. After an international appeal, he was released and in November 1977 he went into exile in France.|$|R
