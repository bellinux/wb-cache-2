5|$|In bioinformatics, microarrays {{are used}} to measure how {{strongly}} different genes are expressed <b>in</b> <b>a</b> <b>sample</b> <b>of</b> biological material. Different rates of expression of a gene are often compared by using the binary logarithm of the ratio of expression rates: the log ratio of two expression rates {{is defined as the}} binary logarithm of the ratio of the two rates. Binary logarithms allow for a convenient comparison of expression rates: a doubled expression rate can be described by a log ratio of , a halved expression rate can be described by a log ratio of , and an unchanged expression rate can be described by a log ratio of zero, for instance.|$|E

A study published in 1979 in the Journal of Consulting and Clinical Psychology analyzed the training of women in self-masturbation techniques <b>in</b> <b>a</b> <b>sample</b> <b>of</b> individuals who previously had difficulty experiencing orgasm. The researchers gave women the Magic Wand to help excite the clitoris and increase the likelihood they would experience an orgasm. They found self-administered treatment using the Magic Wand to be the most efficient option to address prior problems achieving orgasm.|$|E
5|$|Soviet chemist D. K. Dobroserdov was {{the first}} {{scientist}} to claim to have found eka-caesium, or francium. In 1925, he observed weak radioactivity <b>in</b> <b>a</b> <b>sample</b> <b>of</b> potassium, another alkali metal, and incorrectly concluded that eka-caesium was contaminating the sample (the radioactivity from the sample was from the naturally occurring potassium radioisotope, potassium-40). He then published a thesis on his predictions of the properties of eka-caesium, in which he named the element russium after his home country. Shortly thereafter, Dobroserdov {{began to focus on}} his teaching career at the Polytechnic Institute of Odessa, and he did not pursue the element further.|$|E
