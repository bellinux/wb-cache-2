In compressed air purification, {{it is used to}} condense water vapor from compressed air to reduce its moisture content. In oil refineries, chemical plants, and petrochemical plants, refrigeration is used to maintain certain processes at their needed low temperatures (for example, in alkylation of butenes and butane to produce a <b>high</b> <b>octane</b> <b>gasoline</b> component). Metal workers use refrigeration to temper steel and cutlery.

40|$|Future thrusts for {{gasoline}} engine development can be broadly summarized into two categories: (i) efficiency improvements in conventional spark ignition engines, and (ii) development of advance compression ignition (ACI) concepts. Efficiency improvements in conventional spark ignition engines requires downsizing (and turbocharging) {{which may be}} achieved by using <b>high</b> <b>octane</b> <b>gasolines,</b> whereas, low <b>octane</b> <b>gasolines</b> fuels are anticipated for ACI concepts. The current work provides the essential combustion kinetic data, targeting both thrusts, {{that is needed to}} develop high fidelity gasoline surrogate mechanisms and surrogate complexity guidelines. Ignition delay times {{of a wide range of}} certified gasolines and surrogates are reported here. These measurements were performed in shock tubes and rapid compression machines over a wide range of experimental conditions (650 – 1250 K, 10 – 40 bar) relevant to internal combustion engines. Using the measured the data and chemical kinetic analyses, the surrogate complexity requirements for these gasolines in homogeneous environments are specified. For the discussions presented here, gasolines are classified into three categories: (i) 	Low <b>octane</b> <b>gasolines</b> including Saudi Aramco’s light naphtha fuel (anti-knock index, AKI = (RON + MON) / 2 = 64; Sensitivity (S) = RON – MON = 1), certified FACE (Fuels for Advanced Combustion Engines) gasoline I and J (AKI 70, S = 0. 7 and 3 respectively), and their Primary Reference Fuels (PRF, mixtures of n-heptane and iso-octane) and multi-component surrogates. (ii) 	 Mid <b>octane</b> <b>gasolines</b> including FACE A and C (AKI 84, S 0 and 1 respectively) and their PRF surrogates. Laser absorption measurements of intermediate and product species formed during gasoline/surrogate oxidation are also reported.

To assess conditions where shock tubes may not be ideal devices for ignition delay measurements, this work also presents a detailed discussion on shock tube pre-ignition affected ignition data and the ignition regimes in homogeneous environments.

25|$|The {{octane rating}} became {{important}} as the military sought higher output for aircraft engines in the late 1930s and the 1940s.

30|$|High-severity fluid {{catalytic}} cracking (HS-FCC) is a breakthrough technology in the refining and petrochemicals industry. It allows refineries to produce petrochemicals from heavy oils by converting a low-value refinery stream into high-value products, suitable for integrated processes. The process’s main operating features are the down flow reactor system, high reaction temperature, short residence time, and high catalyst-to-oil (C/O) ratio with a modified separator system. The unique down flow reactor system in the HS-FCC process ensures plug flow without back-mixing, allowing more selectivity toward light olefins. HS-FCC produces four times more light olefins (propylene and butene) and <b>higher</b> <b>octane</b> <b>gasoline</b> than conventional FCC units. Since 1999, the HS-FCC has successfully passed several phases of testing with different types of feedstock at various feed capacities. The process has been proven in a 30 barrel per day (bpd) demonstration plant at Ras Tanura Refinery, Saudi Arabia. In 2011, a 3, 000 BPD HS-FCC semi-commercial plant started operating at JX Mizushima Refinery in Japan. The unit ran successfully, meeting all design objectives. A full-scale commercial unit study for a 30, 000 BPD HS-FCC plant was completed by JX and Chiyoda for HS-FCC commercialization.|$|R

The first chapter provides an introduction and outlines the research agenda for the dissertation. Chapter 2 analyzes the effects of the gasoline unit and ad valorem excise taxes on consumption of gasoline by grade. The results show that, while the unit excise tax can cause consumers to substitute toward <b>higher</b> quality (<b>higher</b> <b>octane)</b> <b>gasoline,</b> the opposite effect can also occur as prices rise and the income effect outweighs the substitution effect. Chapter 3 examines the effects of clean indoor air regulations on employment in restaurants.

The results explain how previous research, conducted in low smoking rate states, found no effect or even a positive effect on employment, while more recent research has suggested there could be a negative effect.
