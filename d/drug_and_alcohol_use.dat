25|$|The {{initiation}} of <b>drug</b> <b>and</b> <b>alcohol</b> <b>use</b> {{is most likely}} to occur during adolescence, and some experimentation with substances by older adolescents is common. For example, results from 2010 Monitoring the Future survey, a nationwide study on rates of substance use in the United States, show that 48.2% of 12th graders report having used an illicit drug {{at some point in their}} lives. In the 30 days prior to the survey, 41.2% of 12th graders had consumed alcohol and 19.2% of 12th graders had smoked tobacco cigarettes. In 2009 in the United States about 21% of high school students have taken prescription drugs without a prescription. And earlier in 2002, the World Health Organization estimated that around 140 million people were alcohol dependent and another 400 million with alcohol-related problems.|$|E
25|$|An {{inquiry into}} the {{accident}} by the Transport Accident Investigation Commission (TAIC) concluded that the balloon pilot made an error of judgement when contact with the power lines became imminent, trying to out-climb the power lines rather than using the rapid descent system to drop the balloon quickly to the ground below. Toxicology analysis of the balloon pilot after the accident tested positive for tetrahydrocannabinol (THC), suggesting {{he may have been}} under the influence of cannabis {{at the time of the}} crash, which ultimately led to the error of judgement. The crash was the sixth accident in ten years the TAIC had investigated (the TAIC also investigates marine and rail accidents) which involved key people testing positive for drugs or alcohol, and the commission has called for the Government to enact stricter measures in regards to <b>drug</b> <b>and</b> <b>alcohol</b> <b>use</b> in the aviation, marine and rail industries.|$|E

25|$|Homeless shelters {{can become}} grounds for {{community}} {{organization and the}} recruitment of homeless individuals into social movements for their own cause. Cooperation between the shelter and an elected representative from the homeless community at each shelter can serve as the backbone of this form of initiative. The representative presents and forwards problems, raises concerns and provides new ideas to the director and staff of the shelters. A few examples of possible problems are {{ways to deal with}} <b>drug</b> <b>and</b> <b>alcohol</b> <b>use</b> by certain shelter users and resolve interpersonal conflicts. SAND, the Danish National Organization for Homeless People, is one example of an organization that uses this empowerment approach. Issues reported at the homeless shelters are then addressed by SAND at the regional or national level. To open further dialogue, SAND organizes regional discussion forums where staff and leaders from the shelters, homeless representatives, and local authorities meet to discuss issues and good practices at the shelters.|$|E
25|$|In 1980, he {{directed}} the musical film Popeye. Produced by Robert Evans and written by Jules Feiffer, {{the film was}} based on the comic strip/cartoon of the same name and starred the comedian Robin Williams in his film debut. Designed as a vehicle to increase Altman's commercial clout following a series of critically acclaimed but commercially unsuccessful low-budget films in the late 1970s (including 3 Women, A Wedding and Quintet), the production (filmed on location in Malta) was beleaguered by heavy <b>drug</b> <b>and</b> <b>alcohol</b> <b>use</b> among most of the cast and crew, including the director; Altman reportedly clashed with Evans, Williams (who threatened to leave the film) and songwriter Harry Nilsson (who departed midway through the shoot, leaving Van Dyke Parks to finish the orchestrations). Though the film grossed $60 million worldwide on a $20 million budget and was the second highest-grossing film Altman had directed to that point, it was far from the gross the studios had expected and was considered a box office disappointment.|$|E
25|$|A low {{socioeconomic}} status in a deprived neighborhood may include exposure to “environmental stressors and risk factors.” Socioeconomic inequalities are commonly {{measured by the}} Cartairs-Morris score, Index of Multiple Deprivation, Townsend deprivation index, and the Jarman score. The Jarman score, for example, considers “unemployment, overcrowding, single parents, under-fives, elderly living alone, ethnicity, low social class and residential mobility.” In Vos’ meta-analysis these indices are used to view the effect of low SES neighborhoods on maternal health. In the meta-analysis, data from individual studies were collected from 1985 up until 2008. Vos concludes that a correlation exists between prenatal adversities and deprived neighborhoods. Other {{studies have shown that}} low SES is closely associated with the development of the fetus in utero and growth retardation. Studies also suggest that children born in low SES families are “likely to be born prematurely, at low birth weight, or with asphyxia, a birth defect, a disability, fetal alcohol syndrome, or AIDS.” Bradley and Corwyn also suggest that congenital disorders arise from the mother’s lack of nutrition, a poor lifestyle, maternal substance abuse and “living in a neighborhood that contains hazards affecting fetal development (toxic waste dumps).” In a meta-analysis that viewed how inequalities influenced maternal health, it was suggested that deprived neighborhoods often promoted behaviors such as smoking, <b>drug</b> <b>and</b> <b>alcohol</b> <b>use.</b> After controlling for socioeconomic factors and ethnicity, several individual studies demonstrated an association with outcomes such as perinatal mortality and preterm birth.|$|E

40|$|Abstract Background <b>Drug</b> <b>and</b> <b>alcohol</b> <b>using</b> women leaving {{prison or}} jail face many {{challenges}} to successful re-integration {{in the community}} and are severely hampered in their efforts by the stigma of drug or <b>alcohol</b> <b>use</b> compounded by the stigma of incarceration. Methods This qualitative study is based on individual semi-structured interviews and focus groups with 17 women who had recently left jail about the challenges they faced on reentry. Results Our analysis identified three major themes, which are related by the overarching influence of stigma: survival (jobs and housing), access to treatment services, and family and community reintegration. Conclusion Stigma based on <b>drug</b> use <b>and</b> incarceration works to increase the needs of women for health and social services and at the same time, restricts their access to these services. These specific forms of stigma may amplify gender and race-based stigma. Punitive <b>drug</b> <b>and</b> social policies related to employment, housing, education, welfare, and mental health and substance abuse treatment make it extremely difficult for women to succeed. </p...|$|R

40|$|Many Americans exhibit declining religiosity {{during early}} adulthood. There is no {{consensus}} about why this occurs, though longstanding assumptions suggest the secularizing effects of higher education, normative deviance and life course factors. We evaluate these effects on decreasingfrequency of religious practice, diminished importance of religion and disaffiliation from religion altogether. Results from analyses of theAdd Health study indicate that only religieus participation suffers substantial declines in young adulthood. Contrary to expectations, emerging adults that avoid college exhibit the most extensive patterns of religious decline, undermining conventional wisdom about the secularizing effect of higher education. Marriage curbs religious decline, while cohabitation, nonmarital sex, <b>drugs</b> <b>and</b> <b>alcohol</b> <b>use</b> each accelerate diminished religiosity — especially religious participation — during early adulthood. The young adult years of many Americans are marked by a clear decline in outward religious expression, which is popularly thought to hit bottom during — and perhaps because of — the college experience. This is not new news. In the early 1980 s, nearly 60 percent of young adults reported attending church less frequently than they did during adolescence (Willits and Crider 1989). Dropping out of organized religion altogether is also evident. Estimates of religious disaffiliation in emerging adulthood typically fall between 30 and 40 percen...|$|R
40|$|Abstract Objective: Corrected QT (QTc) {{interval}} prolongation {{is often}} associated with use of first-generation antipsychotics (FGAs). However, other factors require appropriate consideration, including age and gender, the role of other known medications associated with QTc prolongation, and severe comorbid conditions, such as co-occurring alcohol abuse/dependence. We aimed to study potential mediating roles of different, related, candidate variables on QTc. Methods: We capitalized on data from a large (N = 2366), cross-sectional, national survey, the STAR Network QTc study, using a representative sample of people taking FGAs, and recruited from mental health services across Italy. Results: About one-third of the sample was treated with FGAs, and almost one-tenth of the subjects took a different, additional, drug known to cause QTc prolongation. Our findings confirmed that there is an impact from FGAs, age, gender, <b>alcohol</b> misuse, <b>and</b> concurrent risky <b>drugs</b> on QTc. However, comorbid <b>alcohol</b> abuse/dependence <b>and</b> concurrent risky <b>drugs</b> did not mediate the effect of FGAs on QTc. Conclusions: Our findings showed that FGAs, concurrent risky <b>drugs,</b> <b>and</b> <b>alcohol</b> <b>use</b> disorders prolonged QTc. FGAs had a direct effect on QTc, confirming the need for clinicians to monitor a risk that could lead to sudden unexplained death. Copyright © 2016 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.
