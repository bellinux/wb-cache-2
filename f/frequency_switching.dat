50|$|Where a {{particular}} service {{needs to have}} wide coverage, this is usually achieved by using multiple transmitters at different locations. Usually, these transmitters will operate at different frequencies to avoid interference where coverage overlaps. Examples include national broadcasting networks and cellular networks. In the latter, <b>frequency</b> <b>switching</b> is automatically done by the receiver as necessary, in the former, manual retuning is more common (though the Radio Data System {{is an example of}} automatic <b>frequency</b> <b>switching</b> in broadcast networks). Another system for extending coverage using multiple transmitters is quasi-synchronous transmission, but this is rarely used nowadays.|$|E

50|$|A DDS {{has many}} {{advantages}} over its analog counterpart, the phase-locked loop (PLL), including much better frequency agility, improved phase noise, and precise {{control of the}} output phase across <b>frequency</b> <b>switching</b> transitions. Disadvantages include spurs due mainly to truncation effects in the NCO, crossing spurs resulting from high order (>1) Nyquist images, and a higher noise floor at large frequency offsets due mainly to the Digital-to-analog converter.|$|E

5000|$|Compact high {{frequency}} inverter-converter transformers {{developed in the}} early 1990s are used, especially when low Radio Frequency Interference (RFI) is needed, such as in locations near high-fidelity sound equipment. At the typical frequency of these solid state transformers, the plasma electron-ion recombination time is too long to extinguish and reignite the plasma at each cycle, unlike the case at power line frequency. The plasma does not broadcast high <b>frequency</b> <b>switching</b> noise and remains ionized continually, becoming radio noise free.|$|E
50|$|Next to the {{dimorphism}} and {{the first}} described high <b>frequency</b> <b>switching</b> system C. albicans undergoes another high <b>frequency</b> <b>switching</b> process called white to opaque switching, which is another phenotypic switching process in C. albicans. It was the second high-frequency switching system discovered in C. albicans. The white to opaque switching is an epigenetic switching system. Phenotypic switching {{is often used to}} refer to white-opaque switching, which consists of two phases: one that grows as round cells in smooth, white colonies (referred to as white form) and one that is rod-like and grows as flat, gray colonies (called opaque form). This switch from white cells to opaque cells is important for the virulence and the mating process of C. albicans as the opaque form is the mating competent form, being a million times more efficient in mating compared to the white type. This switching between white and opaque form is regulated by the WOR1 regulator (White to Opaque Regulator 1) which is controlled by the mating type locus (MTL) repressor (a1-α2) that inhibits the expression of WOR1. Besides the white and opaque phase there is also a third one: the gray phenotype. This phenotype shows the highest ability to cause cutaneous infections. The white, opaque and gray phenotypes form a tristable phenotypic switching system. Since {{it is often difficult to}} differentiate between white, opaque and gray cells phloxine B, a dye, can be added to the medium.|$|E
50|$|C. albicans {{exhibits}} {{a wide range}} of different morphological phenotypes due to phenotypic switching and bud to hypha transition. The yeast to hyphae transition is a rapid process and induced by environmental factors. Phenotypic switching is spontaneous, happens at lower rates and in certain strains up to seven different phenotypes are known. The best studied switching mechanism is the white to opaque switching (an epigenetic process). Other systems have been described as well. Two systems (the high <b>frequency</b> <b>switching</b> system and white to opaque switching) were discover by David R. Soll and colleagues. Switching in C. albicans is often, but not always, influenced by environmental conditions such as the level of CO2, anaerobic conditions, medium used and temperature.|$|E

40|$|The <b>switching</b> <b>frequency</b> is an {{operating}} parameter which affects nearly every performance {{characteristic of the}} supply, {{as well as the}} cost.

50|$|The gain of a {{good quality}} {{full-range}} audio amplifier will be essentially flat between 20 Hz to about 20 kHz (the range of normal human hearing). In ultra high fidelity amplifier design, the amplifier's frequency response should extend considerably beyond this (one or more octaves either side) and might have −3 dB points < 10 Hz and > 65 kHz. Professional touring amplifiers often have input and/or output filtering to sharply limit frequency response beyond 20 Hz-20 kHz; {{too much of the}} amplifier's potential output power would otherwise be wasted on infrasonic and ultrasonic frequencies, and the danger of AM radio interference would increase. Modern switching amplifiers need steep low pass filtering at the output to get rid of high <b>frequency</b> <b>switching</b> noise and harmonics.|$|E
50|$|Devices vary in {{switching}} speed. Some diodes and thyristors are {{suited for}} relatively slow speed and {{are useful for}} power <b>frequency</b> <b>switching</b> and control; certain thyristors are useful at a few kilohertz. Devices such as MOSFETS and BJTs can switch at tens of kilohertz up to a few megahertz in power applications, but with decreasing power levels. Vacuum tube devices dominate high power (hundreds of kilowatts) at very high frequency (hundreds or thousands of megahertz) applications. Faster switching devices minimize energy lost in the transitions from on to off and back, but may create problems with radiated electromagnetic interference. Gate drive (or equivalent) circuits must be designed to supply sufficient drive current to achieve the full switching speed possible with a device. A device without sufficient drive to switch rapidly may be destroyed by excess heating.|$|E
50|$|Switching {{hardware}} {{technologies that}} can handle the radio frequency currents of high power transmitters and also switch quietly at these high Morse code rates {{over long periods of}} time are difficult to design and quite expensive to manufacture. Mechanical switches or relays are the most problematic and least reliable and must be protected from arcs (sparking) usually by operating in a vacuum enclosure with elaborate timing circuitry. Not all radio transceiver equipment provides the costly high speed analog transmit/receive (T/R) radio <b>frequency</b> <b>switching</b> hardware support necessary for QSK full break-in operation. Generally full break-in is available only on more expensive radio transceivers. Radiotelegraphers who aspire to the fluency of Morse code QSK operation must ensure that their radio equipment includes the hardware capability for radio frequency antenna switching that operates rapidly enough to allow listening between signals at the appropriate Morse code sending speeds with appropriate lifetimes and reliability.|$|E

5000|$|While {{multiple}} technologies {{were transferred}} to member companies and government agencies in the final years, two very important companies were spun out of MCC that were instrumental in the dominant US economy. The first company was Teravicta Technologies - Austin's first MEMS company (MEMS=micro electro mechanical systems) whose focus was to develop microscopic switch technology for fiber optic switching and radio <b>frequency</b> <b>switching</b> in mobile phones specifically to dynamically switch between the future 3G-4G-LTE wireless communication frequencies and insure mobile phones were communicating over the strongest wireless signal and hence, fewer dropped calls. As of 2015, the Austin region benefits from a $BB MEMS & sensors industry value chain. The second company was Portelligent, a company that provided reverse engineering tear down services. At the time, Portelligent was the first company to commercialize such services that were provided by MCC to its member companies. Today, {{there are at least}} 12 companies across the globe that sell reports known as [...] "reverse engineering tear down reports." [...] Modern day tear down reports provide detailed information about technology products such as the bill of materials, microchip and printed circuit board design specifics, manufacturing details including manufacturing location details for the entire value chain responsible for making electronics, including the iPhone and Samsung Galaxy smart phones. Portelligent was acquired by United Business Media and became UBM Semiconductor Insights.|$|E
5000|$|A single-electrode {{voltage clamp}} [...] - [...] discontinuous, or SEVC-d, has some {{advantages}} over SEVC-c for whole-cell recording. In this, {{a different approach}} is taken for passing current and recording voltage. A SEVC-d amplifier operates on a [...] "time-sharing" [...] basis, so the electrode regularly and frequently switches between passing current and measuring voltage. In effect, there are two electrodes, but each is in operation for {{only half of the}} time it is on. The oscillation between the two functions of the single electrode is termed a duty cycle. During each cycle, the amplifier measures the membrane potential and compares it with the holding potential. An operational amplifier measures the difference, and generates an error signal. This current is a mirror image of the current generated by the cell. The amplifier outputs feature sample and hold circuits, so each briefly sampled voltage is then held on the output until the next measurement in the next cycle. To be specific, the amplifier measures voltage in the first few microseconds of the cycle, generates the error signal, and spends the rest of the cycle passing current to reduce that error. At the start of the next cycle, voltage is measured again, a new error signal generated, current passed etc. The experimenter sets the cycle length, and it is possible to sample with periods as low as about 15 microseconds, corresponding to a 67 kHz switching <b>frequency.</b> <b>Switching</b> frequencies lower than about 10 kHz are not sufficient when working with action potentials that are less than 1 millisecond wide. Note that not all discontinuous voltage-clamp amplifier support switching frequencies higher than 10 kHz.|$|E
