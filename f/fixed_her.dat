500|$|Jim Shelley again {{commented on}} the outlandishness of the character's storylines {{following}} Abra's next return to the show, in 2007. [...] He wrote: [...] "Ric and Ade Edmondson had been conducting secret operations on orphans smuggled in from Africa (as you do). [...] It's TV crackinstant, mind-altering, utterly addictive." [...] He also dubbed the line [...] "I don't know why people complain about the NHS." [...] his 'Naive statement of the week', with the explanation: [...] "Hmmmm let's see. Abra covering up that he was operating on his arms-dealer father. Maddy hiding the fact she killed her junkie sister's daughter. And secret cokehead Jesus Of Nazareth (Robert Powell) keeping quiet about counselling Elliot's son for heroin addiction. Oh yeah, and in Casualty, in Holby's A department, nurse Ruth Winters secretly <b>fixed</b> <b>her</b> dad's breathalyser test. Anyone detect a theme emerging?" ...|$|E

500|$|The series 10 episode [...] "Love Will Tear Us Apart", {{which saw}} Maddy stood up by Dan on a return visit from France, was {{selected}} as a televisual pick of the day by The Guardian, the Daily Mirror, and the Birmingham Mail. The Guardian critic Gareth McLean was critical of the episode, writing: [...] "Now here's an idea for another Holby spin-off - one set in the hospital's STD clinic. Of course, given the ceaseless intra-departmental shagging {{that goes on in}} that hospital, there might be too much crossover with existing shows, with not a look-in for characters who aren't actually on staff. Here, sexist surgeon Clifford returns to complicate Maddy's life, though since she's been sleeping with Sam, who's slept with Connie, Chrissie and Faye, she appears to need no help in that area.She's going to die." [...] The Sun journalist Anita Baig has also commented critically on the character, noting {{that when it comes to}} medicine, Maddy [...] "always seems to be having difficulties." [...] Daily Mirror [...] critic Jim Shelley has discussed the outlandish nature of the character's storylines, dubbing the line [...] "I don't know why people complain about the NHS" [...] from a 2007 episode his 'Naive statement of the week', explaining: [...] "Hmmmm let's see. Abra covering up that he was operating on his arms-dealer father. Maddy hiding the fact she killed her junkie sister's daughter. And secret cokehead Jesus Of Nazareth (Robert Powell) keeping quiet about counselling Elliot's son for heroin addiction. Oh yeah, and in Casualty, in Holby's A department, nurse Ruth Winters secretly <b>fixed</b> <b>her</b> dad's breathalyser test. Anyone detect a theme emerging?" [...] Shelley has, however, also deemed Maddy to be one of Holby Citys [...] "few really good, realistic, characters".|$|E
2500|$|In Germany, Italy and France many clergyman and {{university}} professors gave speeches saying all of Europe owed a huge debt to ancient Greece, {{that the modern}} Greeks were entitled to call upon the classical heritage {{as a reason for}} support and Greece only achieve progress with freedom from the Ottoman Empire. A young medical student in Mannheim wrote that hearing his professor lecture on the need for Greek freedom went through him like an electric shock, inspiring to drop his studies and head to Greece while a Danish student wrote: [...] "How could a man inclined to fight for freedom and justice find a better place than next to the oppressed Greeks?". In France, the United Kingdom, Spain, Russia, the United States and many other places [...] "Greek committees" [...] were established to raise funds and supplies for the revolution. The classicist Edward Everett, professor of Greek at Harvard, was active in championing the Greek cause in the United States and in November 1821 published an appeal from Adhamantios Korais reading [...] "To the Citizens of the United States, it is your land that Liberty has <b>fixed</b> <b>her</b> abode, so you will not assuredly imitate the culpable indifference or rather the long ingratitude of the Europeans", going on to call for American intervention, in several American newspapers. In 1821, the Greek committee in Charleston, South Carolina sent the Greeks 50 barrels of salted meat while the Greek Committee in Springfield, Massachusetts sent supplies of salted meat, sugar, fish and flour. Newspapers in the United States gave the war much coverage and were overwhelmingly pro-Greek in their stance, which explains why American public opinion was so supportive. In New York City, one ball put on by the Greek committee raised $8, 000 dollars. In Russia, the St. Petersburg Greek committee under Prince Alexander Golitsyn had raised 973, 500 roubles by August 1822. By the end of the war, millions of roubles had been fund-raised in Russia for the relief of refugees and to buy Greeks enslaved freedom (through the government forbade buying arms for the Greeks), but no Russian is known to have gone to fight with the Greeks.|$|E
2500|$|On August 8, 1996, the Los Angeles Daily News {{announced}} that Jon Seda and Edward James Olmos {{had joined the}} cast as Chris Perez and Abraham Quintanilla, respectively. After Lopez received the role, she decided to stay with Suzette at her home to study her character in the recordings and footage the family shared with her. Lopez felt that her [...] "spirit and [...] spirit were so similar" [...] which was echoed by the singer's family who found that Lopez mimicked similar personality traits of Selena. They believed that Lopez' body language, laugh, and how she talked were identical to that of Selena's. Lopez had constant dance rehearsals for the film and said how she would arrive at the studio {{late in the day}} after finishing filming for another role. The family often had the entire main cast of the film over for dinner and would notice how they would watch them in their interactions with each other and the way they ate. Edward James Olmos, who took the role as Abraham, was asked to gain [...] for the film. The cast found Olmos to be a father figure for them and often gave advice to the cast during filming. A.B., found Olmos' portrayal of his father to be convincing especially in the scene where Abraham was angered after finding out about Selena and Perez' relationship. Suzette discovered that Jackie Guerra, who played her in the film, constantly <b>fixed</b> <b>her</b> fitted and asked her family if she had done that before in which the family replied that she unknowingly does so. Band member Pete Astudillo, had to do a screen test of himself for the film and said how he had to improvised in several of his scenes since he had little dialogue in the film. American actor Jon Seda portrayed Chris Perez in the film and often spent time with Perez for character development. Seda said how he had spent time with Perez at the home he shared with Selena and found a price sticker in the bathroom with a scribbled letter that read [...] "Selena and Chris, I Love You" [...] and expressed on how that further inspired him to [...] "show the love they [...] had" [...] in the film. The biographical film focused on Selena's life rather than her death. Nava said, [...] "I don't want to attend to [...] ", while her death is treated [...] "at a distance".|$|E
