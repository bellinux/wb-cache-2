5|$|Wilfrid went to Rome {{after his}} {{expulsion}} to appeal against Theodore and Ecgfrith's decisions, the first Englishman to challenge a royal or ecclesiastical decision by petitioning the papacy. On the way <b>he</b> <b>stopped</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> court of Aldgisl, the Frisian king in Utrecht {{for most of}} 678. Wilfrid had been blown off course on his trip from England to the continent, {{and ended up in}} Frisia according to some historians. Others state that he intended to journey via Frisia to avoid Neustria, whose Mayor of the Palace, Ebroin, disliked Wilfrid. He wintered in Frisia, avoiding the diplomatic efforts of Ebroin, who according to Stephen attempted to have Wilfrid killed. During his stay, Wilfrid attempted to convert the Frisians, who were still pagan at that time. Wilfrid's biographer says that most of the nobles converted, but the success was short-lived. After Frisia, <b>he</b> <b>stopped</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> court of Dagobert II in Austrasia, where the king offered Wilfrid the Bishopric of Strasbourg, which Wilfrid refused. Once in Italy, Wilfrid was received by Perctarit, a Lombard king, who gave him a place at his court.|$|E
5|$|At that point, Garin was leading, with Émile Georget {{almost two}} hours behind. In the fifth stage, Georget had two flat tires, {{and fell asleep}} when <b>he</b> <b>stopped</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> {{side of the road}} to rest; he failed to finish. Thus Garin {{extended}} his lead by winning this stage, carrying nearly three hours' advantage into the final day's racing. Garin had requested other cyclists in the leading group to let him win the stage, but Fernand Augereau refused to do this. Garin then had Lucien Pothier throw down his bicycle in front of Augereau, who fell, and Garin then bent Augereau's rear wheel. Augereau quickly obtained a spare bike and continued to the finish, however Garin easily won the sprint. Augereau still received a prize of 100 francs from Velo-Sport Nantes for the fastest final kilometer of the stage in the Nantes velodrome.|$|E

25|$|Bryant {{travelled}} to Forcett Village, arriving {{some time}} around 11:00a.m. He continued down to Port Arthur and was seen driving into Seascape down the Arthur Highway around 11:45a.m. <b>He</b> <b>stopped</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> Seascape guest accommodation site {{that his father}} had wanted to purchase, owned by David and Noelene Martin. Bryant went inside and fired several shots, then gagged David Martin and stabbed him. Witnesses testified to different numbers of shots fired at this time. It was stated in court that it was believed that this was the time that Bryant killed the Martins, his first two victims.|$|E
25|$|During {{the winter}} of 1819–20, Pratt and three of his neighbors went on a trading {{expedition}} to Canada to sell their leather and other goods. They were successful, and traded their leather for gold and furs from Canadian settlers, and from Native Americans at Rice Lake. On his return, <b>he</b> <b>stopped</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> bank in Catskill, New York, where he learned that his tannery had burned down in his absence The building was uninsured, and was a loss of $1000; the cause was never determined. However, he resolved to rebuild it. Friends of Pratt's and his brothers donated money for the rebuilding, and it was quickly built.|$|E
25|$|As April 1586 passed, {{there was}} no sign of Grenville's relief fleet. Meanwhile, in June, bad blood {{resulted}} from the destruction of the village, and this spurred an attack on the fort by the local Native Americans, which the colonists were able to repel. Soon after the attack, Sir Francis Drake was on his way home from a successful raid in the Caribbean, and <b>he</b> <b>stopped</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> colony and offered to take the colonists back to England. Several accepted, including metallurgist Joachim Gans. On this return voyage, the Roanoke colonists introduced tobacco, maize, and potatoes to England. The relief fleet arrived shortly after Drake's departure with the colonists. Finding the colony abandoned, Grenville returned to England with the bulk of his force, leaving behind a small detachment of fifteen men both to maintain an English presence and to protect Raleigh's claim to Roanoke Island.|$|E

25|$|Three {{practice}} sessions—two on Friday and a {{third on}} Saturday—were held before the Sunday race. The Friday morning and afternoon sessions lasted ninety minutes each; the third, one-hour session was held on Saturday morning. Rosberg was fastest in the first practice session, {{which took place in}} dry and warm weather conditions, with a lap of one minute and 12.764 seconds, two-tenths of a second faster than teammate Hamilton in second and Daniil Kvyat in third. Alonso was fourth-fastest, and Massa placed fifth. Verstappen, Pastor Maldonado, Kimi Räikkönen, Magnussen and Ricciardo rounded out the session's top ten drivers. During the session, where drivers struggled with grip on the resurfaced track, Juncadella spun at turn six, and later lost control of his car's rear-end, crashing heavily into the turn eight barrier, damaging his car's nose cone and suspension, and the session was red flagged. The crash resulted in Force India replacing several engine hydraulic components following a heat soak and Pérez missed the second session. Button was unable to take part when <b>he</b> <b>stopped</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> pit lane entry with an energy recovery system failure. Esteban Gutiérrez was also not able to record a lap time upon suffering engine electrical issues.|$|E
500|$|Upon Leno's {{release from}} the {{institution}} in October 1903, the press offered much welcoming commentary and speculated {{as to whether he}} would appear that year in the Drury Lane pantomime, scheduled to be Humpty Dumpty. Concerned that Leno might suffer a relapse, Arthur Collins employed Marie Lloyd to take his place. By the time of rehearsals, however, Leno persuaded Collins that he was well enough to take part, and the cast was reshuffled to accommodate him. Leno appeared with success. Upon hearing his signature song, the audience reportedly gave him a standing ovation that lasted five minutes. He received a telegram from the King congratulating him on his performance. Leno's stage partner Herbert Campbell died in July 1904, shortly after the pantomime, following an accident at the age of fifty-seven. The death affected Leno deeply, and he went into a decline. At that time, he was appearing at the London Pavilion, but the show had to be cancelled owing to his inability to remember his lines. So harsh were the critics that Leno wrote a statement, published in The Era, to defend the show's originality. On 20 October 1904, Leno gave his last performance in the show. [...] Afterwards, <b>he</b> <b>stopped</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> Belgrave Hospital for Children in Kennington to leave a donation of £625 (£ in [...] adjusted for inflation).|$|E
500|$|Before the {{formation}} lap, Rosberg {{appeared to have}} an issue with his car, when <b>he</b> <b>stopped</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> end of pit lane {{on the way to}} the start grid. However, his mechanics were able to rectify the problem, described by Niki Lauda as [...] "a glitch", and he made it to the grid. With everyone starting on the super-soft tyre compound, a race with two pit stops was expected for most drivers. At the start, all drivers at the front of the field held their positions, while further back, Nico Hülkenberg, who had a good start, and Sergio Pérez nearly collided while fighting for position. Max Verstappen's Toro Rosso STR10 stalled on the grid and was pushed back to the pit lane, only to start his race shortly after, more than one lap down on the leaders. Vettel was able to build a gap to Ricciardo behind him quickly, leading the Red Bull by three seconds after the first lap. Fernando Alonso, who had enjoyed a decent start to move up into eleventh, came under pressure from Sainz by lap four, followed by Grosjean, who lost places at the start because he had to move around the stationary Verstappen. While Vettel's lead was about five seconds on lap five, Verstappen unlapped himself by lap six and posted fast lap times. Meanwhile, Nico Rosberg held off the two Williams cars of Bottas and Massa, while Lewis Hamilton in front was able to move clear of the pack fighting for sixth place. Kimi Räikkönen in third place was held at a distance by Ricciardo, trailing him by 1.6 seconds on lap nine. A lap later, Grosjean became the first driver to pit. More cars came in on lap eleven, leading to heavy traffic that prevented Sainz and Alonso from leaving their pit boxes, costing time. Alonso emerged from pit lane ahead of Grosjean, who moved past him into thirteenth. Felipe Massa had a slow stop of 4.8 seconds when he made a pit stop at the end of lap 13. When he emerged from pit lane, Nico Hülkenberg was approaching on the racing line. Both drivers collided, with Hülkenberg being catapulted off Massa's front right tyre, causing him to retire from the race. A Virtual Safety Car period ensued, that saw all drivers pit that had not done so before. Since Kvyat had made a pit stop shortly before the safety car was deployed, both Mercedes cars were able to move in front of him, leaving Kvyat in sixth place. Jenson Button's stop took a long time, dropping him to 16th place. By lap 16, the virtual was replaced by the actual safety car, which stayed out until the end of lap 18.|$|E

2500|$|The Crozet Islands were {{discovered}} on 24 January 1772 by the expedition of French explorer Marc-Joseph Marion du Fresne, aboard Le Mascarin. His second-in-command Jules (Julien-Marie) Crozet landed on Île de la Possession, claiming the archipelago for France. The expedition continued east and landed at New Zealand, where Captain Marion {{and much of}} his crew were killed and cannibalized by Maori. Crozet survived the disaster, and successfully led the survivors back to their base at Mauritius. In 1776 Crozet met James Cook at Cape Town, {{at the onset of}} Cook's third voyage. Crozet shared the charts of his ill-fated expedition, and as Cook sailed eastward <b>he</b> <b>stopped</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> islands, naming the western group Marion and the eastern group Crozet. In the following years, sealers visiting the islands referred to both the eastern and western groups as the Crozet Islands, and Marion Island became the name of the larger of the two Prince Edward Islands, which {{were discovered}} by Captain Marion on the same expedition.|$|E

[...] In August 1859, he succeeded in moving the Indians without loss of life to a new reservation in Indian Territory. [...] Forced to return to Texas on business, <b>he</b> <b>stopped</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> village near Fort Belknap. [...] On September 14, 1859, while he was speaking with one settler, a man named Edward Cornett shot him in the back while he was talking to the first man, and killed him.
