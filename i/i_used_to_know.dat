500|$|... {{that would}} be all right. She is {{supposed}} to be exorcising spots and iron stains, same as Lady MacBeth(!). The verb is imperative, and apparently it is not reasonable to use [...] "no" [...] with a vocative noun. It is a contradiction to address [...] "no spot!" [...] I am afraid this is rather muddled; <b>I</b> <b>used</b> <b>to</b> <b>know</b> my Latin grammar but it has faded ... I wish another book could be planned out before the summer, if we are going on with them, I always feel very much lost when they are finished.|$|E

500|$|At age 17 in 1902, Roosevelt {{completed}} her formal education {{and returned to}} the United States; she was presented at a debutante ball at the Waldorf-Astoria hotel on December 14. She was later given her own [...] "coming out party". She said of her debut in a public discussion once (as later recounted in her New York Times obituary), [...] "It was simply awful. It was a beautiful party, of course, but I was so unhappy, because a girl who comes out is so utterly miserable if she does not know all the young people. Of course I had been so long abroad that I had lost touch with all the girls <b>I</b> <b>used</b> <b>to</b> <b>know</b> in New York. I was miserable through all that." ...|$|E
500|$|Biden's {{vice presidential}} campaigning gained little media visibility, as far greater press {{attention}} {{was focused on}} the Republican running mate, Alaskan Governor Sarah Palin. [...] During one week in September 2008, for instance, the Pew Research Center's Project for Excellence in Journalism found that Biden was included in only five percent of the news coverage of the race, far less than for the other three candidates on the tickets. [...] Biden nevertheless focused on campaigning in economically challenged areas of swing states and trying to win over blue-collar Democrats, especially those who had supported Hillary Clinton. [...] Biden attacked McCain heavily, despite a long-standing personal friendship; he would say, [...] "That guy <b>I</b> <b>used</b> <b>to</b> <b>know,</b> he's gone. It literally saddens me." [...] As the financial crisis of 2007–2010 reached a peak with the liquidity crisis of September 2008 and the proposed bailout of United States financial system became {{a major factor in the}} campaign, Biden voted in favor of the $700billion Emergency Economic Stabilization Act of 2008, which passed the Senate 74–25.|$|E

At first it was more free than lance, then I started getting money for my words (Rez Road Follies, p. 2) ...|$|R

2500|$|On August 24, 1997, at {{a concert}} at Wolf Trap, Vienna, Virginia, Bob Dylan {{had this to say}} about Lomax, who had helped {{introduce}} him to folk music and whom he had known as a young man in Greenwich Village:There is a distinguished gentlemen here who came … I want to introduce him – named Alan Lomax. I don’t know if many of you have heard of him [...] Yes, he’s here, he’s made a trip out to see me. <b>I</b> <b>used</b> <b>to</b> <b>know</b> him years ago.

2500|$|After an {{obituary}} for Franz Ferdinand, who {{had been}} assassinated in Sarajevo on 28 June 1914, Die Fackel was not published for many months. In December 1914, it appeared again with an essay [...] "In dieser großen Zeit" [...] ("In this grand time"): [...] "In dieser großen Zeit, die ich noch gekannt habe, wie sie so klein war; die wieder klein werden wird, wenn ihr dazu noch Zeit bleibt; … in dieser lauten Zeit, die da dröhnt von der schauerlichen Symphonie der Taten, die Berichte hervorbringen, und der Berichte, welche Taten verschulden: in dieser da mögen Sie von mir kein eigenes Wort erwarten." [...] ("In this grand time, which <b>I</b> <b>used</b> <b>to</b> <b>know</b> when it was this small; which will become small again if there is time; … in this loud time that resounds from the ghastly symphony of deeds that spawn reports, and of reports that cause deeds: in this one, you may not expect a word of my own.") In the subsequent time, Kraus wrote against the World War, and censors repeatedly confiscated or obstructed editions of Die Fackel.|$|E
2500|$|... "Happy Anniversary" [...] {{is written}} {{from the point}} of view of a dying loved one, which Pierre based on his grandmother, who died several years prior of cancer. [...] " [...] is {{basically}} [...] from the person's point of view who is dying, and all of the things that they can't necessarily say to the person that they're leaving behind," [...] remarked Pierre. The event occurred in late 2009, shortly after the band had learned of a [...] "big break, this big opportunity," [...] which Pierre skipped out on to go see his ailing grandmother. [...] "It was a weird experience being with this shell of a woman that <b>I</b> <b>used</b> <b>to</b> <b>know.</b> She couldn't move or communicate," [...] he later said; she passed the next morning. He noted that had he not gone, he would not have had another experience with her, which factored into the song’s lyrics to live in the moment. The band considered it the darkest on the album. The song was so personal, it affected the group recording the song. [...] "The song gives me shivers. I couldn't sing the song [...] I kept breaking down every time I tried to sing it. It was really weird," [...] said Pierre. Pierre interpreted the final song on the album, [...] "Floating Down the River", as a celebration of his newfound excitement for life.|$|E
60|$|I {{learned of}} it just by chance {{one night at}} the club. There is one old man there, {{extremely}} rich, {{with one of the}} best faces of the lot, just like a hyena. <b>I</b> never <b>used</b> <b>to</b> <b>know</b> how he had got so rich. So one evening I asked one of the millionaires how old Bloggs had made all his money.|$|R

5000|$|King {{was buried}} in the St. Joseph City, Michigan Cemetery. A {{monument}} later erected in Lake Bluff Park, Berrien County, Michigan in 1924 features a bronze bust of King created by Chicago sculptor Leonard Crunelle. On the granite monument base are lines from his poem [...] "The River St. Joe":Where the bumblebee sips and the clover's in bloom, [...] and the zephyr's come laden with peachblow perfume. Where the thistle-down pauses in search of the rose and the myrtle and woodbine and wild ivy grows;Oh, give me the spot that <b>I</b> once <b>used</b> <b>to</b> <b>know</b> {{by the side of the}} placid old River St. Joe! ...|$|R
6000|$|Yes, {{it was an}} {{astonishing}} thing to see the Mississippi rolling between unpeopled shores and straight over the spot where <b>I</b> <b>used</b> <b>to</b> see a good big self-complacent town twenty years ago.

5000|$|Despite what is {{commonly}} believed, the song does {{not refer to}} Castle Park in Colchester, the town where the band hail from. According to Damon Albarn when introducing the song during their July 2009 Hyde Park performance, [...] "I {{came up with the}} idea for this song in this park. I was living on Kensington Church Street, and <b>I</b> <b>used</b> <b>to</b> come into the park at the other end, and <b>I</b> <b>used</b> <b>to,</b> you <b>know,</b> watch people, and pigeons...", at which moment Phil Daniels appears onstage. Phil also performed a rendition of the song at the band's headline slot at Glastonbury Festival 2009 and at the band's second Hyde Park concert in August 2012, and at the 2012 Brit awards.|$|R
