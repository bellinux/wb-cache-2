40|$|The {{development}} of the PILAPT computer-based system {{grew out of the}} meta-analysis reported by Hunter and Burke, and the design principles have been described by Burke, Kitching and Valsler (1994). In summary, these design principles were as follows: • that the test designs be based on clearly understood measures of individual differences that research has shown are relevant to pilot performance, either in training or in operations. As such, PILAPT had to cover both handling skills (as required in ab initio training) and CRM competencies (such as situational awareness and capacity). • that the test designs should assume no prior knowledge of flying, but should have links to <b>key</b> <b>pilot</b> performance factors that are intuitive to both candidates and users. • that the test designs should allow for practice to avoid the influence of prior experience of video games and give all candidates a level playing field to demonstrate their potential. • that the overall battery should be efficient and avoid redundancy and nugatory assessments. Design work on PILAPT began in 1994 and has continued with new tests and new scoring algorithms over the nine years since.

Pp 200 – 205 The {{success of}} {{participatory}} conservation projects depends greatly on the interest {{shown by the}} local population and on the strategies used to incorporate all stakeholders from the initial stages. In the highly diverse region of the tropical Andean páramos, threats to ecosystem integrity come mainly from agriculture and cattle grazing. Approaches to biodiversity conservation have often been based on top-down regulations imposed by government agencies. The implementation of an alternative approach, incorporating local communities {{in the design of}} action plans for conservation, was the central objective during the design phase of the Andean Páramo Project. These plans will be executed in a network of <b>key</b> <b>pilot</b> sites along the South American páramos. Here we report on experience at the two Venezuelan sites, where the design process involved a series of participatory workshops. The multidisciplinary nature of the facilitation team was essential in addressing the complex links between biodiversity conservation, land use strategies, and human welfare. The success of the approach was associated with the local population's great interest in and detailed knowledge of the ecosystem, as well as with our emphasis on empowerment through incorporating local knowledge and views as the basis for planning. 200 – 205 llambi@ula. vejulia@ula. venorypc@ula. vemaximina@ula. v...|$|R
5000|$|As {{part of the}} Airship Development Programme, from 9 October 1925 a hook-equipped de Havilland Humming Bird (Registration G-EBQP) {{was used}} in a short series of {{experiments}} with [...] "an obsolete underpowered type of airship", HMA R33 (known colloquially as the [...] "Pulham Pig") {{in an attempt to}} develop an airborne aircraft carrier. On 15 October 1925 the Humming Bird flown by Squadron Leader Rollo Haig, was released from the R33, and became the first to reattach an aircraft to a rigid airship, although the propeller was damaged as he reattached and he detached again to glide to a separate landing at the aerodrome. On 4 December 1925 Flight Lieutenant Janor, flying a Humming Bird was the first to successfully hook an aeroplane onto a rigid airship and remain attached until the airship landed. Previously the Royal Air Force had modified two F.1 Sopwith Camels (serials N6622 and N6814) for trials by No. 212 Squadron RAF with airship HMA 23r, which culminated in Lt.

40|$|Purpose – This {{research}} {{investigates the}} context, development and outcomes of a cross-European in-service training programme, developing mobile learning practices in school classrooms – MLEARN - in the Netherlands, England, Greece and Italy. The research focused on: contextual backgrounds; a training needs analysis; and initial, mid-term and final outcomes from teachers and learners. Design/methodology/approach – Evidence was gathered about: contextual backgrounds through literature reviews and key informant responses; a training needs analysis through online survey responses from teachers and trainers; and outcomes of uses from five surveys, largely completed online {{by teachers and}} learners, after some 2, 3, 5, 9 and 13 months of use. Findings – Findings from survey periods were compared, to identify shifts and gaps. The training programme led to successful outcomes; there was rapid uptake {{and use of the}} mobile devices, as well as shifts in emphasis across the period of the pilot, dependent on contextual factors. But long-term integration requires focus on specific learning activities, as well as on integration beyond a one-year period. Social implications – Uses of mobile devices are increasing, across countries, and age ranges. How devices can be used to support learning and teaching in contemporary contexts is not temporally independent. Country curricula, legislation, training programme access, and teacher and learner awareness and perceptions, all influence practice. Originality/value – Teachers have limited access to training programmes in this field. This study investigated a <b>key</b> <b>pilot</b> in this under-developed research area.

40|$|Two {{mechanisms}} internal to {{the pilot}} that affect performance during a tracking task are: 1) Pilot equalization (i. e. lead/lag); and 2) Pilot gain (i. e. sensitivity to the error signal). For some applications McRuer's Crossover Model {{can be used to}} anticipate what equalization will be employed to control a vehicle's dynamics. McRuer also established approximate time delays associated with different types of equalization - the more cognitive processing that is required due to equalization difficulty, the larger the time delay. However, the Crossover Model does not predict what the pilot gain will be. A nonlinear pilot control technique, observed and coined by the authors as 'amplitude clipping', is shown to improve stability, performance, and reduce workload when employed with vehicle dynamics that require high lead compensation by the pilot. Combining linear and nonlinear methods a novel approach is used to measure the pilot control parameters when amplitude clipping is present, allowing precise measurement in real time of <b>key</b> <b>pilot</b> control parameters. Based on the results of an experiment which was designed to probe workload primary drivers, a method is developed that estimates pilot spare capacity from readily observable measures and is tested for generality using multi-axis flight data. This paper documents the initial steps to developing a novel, simple objective metric for assessing pilot workload and its variation over time across a wide variety of tasks. Additionally, it offers a tangible, easily implementable methodology for anticipating a pilot's operating parameters and workload, and an effective design tool. The model shows promise in being able to precisely predict the actual pilot settings and workload, and observed tolerance of pilot parameter variation over the course of operation. Finally, an approach is proposed for generating Cooper-Harper ratings based on the workload and parameter estimation methodology...|$|R
40|$|Technology {{is being}} {{developed}} for a hydrocarbon-fueled engine operating as a scramjet over the flight Mach number range from 5. 6 to 7. A series of connected-pipe tests were performed to define scramjet combustor design criteria applicable to the United Technologies Research Center (UTRC) engine concept which comprises a pair of modular axisymmetric combustor underslung on a supersonic/hypersonic missile. The development of <b>key</b> <b>pilot</b> and fuel injector components of the combustor is pursued in a variable-geometry two-dimensional test section over a range of combustor entrance conditions simulating the intended flight regime. The applicability of the two-dimensional test results to the axisymmetric engine is ensured by maintaining a proper simulation of combustor entrance conditions and preserving the actual length scale in the two-dimensional test configuration. An air-breathing pilot was developed and tested to evaluate flame stabilization and flame propagation characteristics. A pilot configuration was developed that operated stably, with minimal flow spillage, at exhaust stagnation temperatures as high as 4500 R with ethylene fuel. It was demonstrated that the pilot promotes efficient combustion of either gaseous ethylene or preheated liquid Jet-A (JP- 5) when they are injected into the supersonic mainstream flow as primary fuels. For the tests with Jet-A fuel, the fuel was heated {{in an array of}} internal cooling passages within the pilot walls to a thermodynamic condition such that it would flash-vaporize upon injection into the mainstream flow. The idea of using the air-breathing pilot and distributed primary and secondary fuel injectors to achieve efficient supersonic combustion over a wide range of equivalence ratios was also experimentally demonstrated during the program. During staged fuel injection tests with gaseous ethylene fuel, high secondary fuel combustion efficiencies were achieved and smooth transitions from fully supersonic to dual mode (supersonic/subsonic) operation were demonstrated at high overall equivalence ratios...|$|R
40|$|Project overview: The FC {{approach}} is gaining momentum and being adopted in higher education. The FC {{is designed to}} engage student’s in foundation course content traditionally covered in the didactic environment prior to class time via small independent but engaging learning activities. Foundation learning is then further explored and applied in class through higher order and interactive group based learning activities. Over 2014 a team {{of public health and}} paramedic science academics at the University of the Sunshine Coast (USC) working together to flip some of their classes received a $ 10, 000 Exploratory Learning and Teaching Grant through the Centre for Support and Advancement of Learning and Teaching (C-SALT) USC to progress and evaluate this work. FC evaluation framework: The FC evaluation framework comprised process and impact evaluation dimensions. Process evaluation collected in-class qualitative feedback from students’ on specific aspects of the FC process early and late in the semester. Impact evaluation collected quantitative data on student course level engagement constructs (motivation, active participation, performance, independent inquiry, and peer collaboration) via the FCSEQ and selected relevant items from the USC Student Evaluation of Teaching instruments. <b>Key</b> <b>pilot</b> evaluation findings: The pilot evaluation was conducted in 8 Public Health, and 1 Paramedic Science and Occupational Therapy courses over 2014 (260 undergraduate and 40 post graduate students). Overall findings indicated that the majority of students (55. 7 % response rate) were engaged or very engaged in the FC. When compared with traditionally-delivered courses, about 1 / 3 reported being more or a lot more engaged. Student engagement was higher for structured workshop learning activities, than activities outside of class time. There was evidence that the FC may not appeal to all students hence consideration needs to be given to ensuring diverse student learning styles are catered for...|$|R
