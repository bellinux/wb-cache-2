500|$|Appearing {{in series}} two, Ianto assists {{the team in}} field {{missions}} and {{is used by the}} writers as a vehicle for one-liner jokes. Commenting on this, portrayer Gareth David-Lloyd notes that [...] "This season it's much more relaxed and he's not all about keeping secrets, he's about Torchwood and Jack— he's found his meaning and his place so his dry humour comes out a lot more and he's happier." [...] The developments in Ianto's character were also reflected in the wardrobe choice. [...] "For series two," [...] comments Ray Holman, [...] "we evolved the look quite a lot, and now his suits {{come from all over the}} place. It's just a question of where <b>I</b> <b>see</b> <b>something</b> that looks right for Gareth, so I've brought him a suit from Savile Row and suits from Zara and Next. We realised we could be a bit more flash with Ianto now he's come out of the background and started to assert himself a bit more. So we moved him into coloured shirts and snazzier ties. He started off in white and grey shirts but we realised his skin tones can take the extra colour and now he's evolving into something much sharper, which looks really good filmed in high definition." ...|$|E
500|$|When {{asked about}} how he comes up with song titles, McKinnon said: [...] "I've got my iPhone, and I go on my notes and every time <b>I</b> <b>see</b> <b>{{something}}</b> I like I write it down, {{so a lot of}} the time titles are something that mean something to us only, or to someone I know only." [...] He called What Separates Me from You [...] "the slowest for stuff like that", when referring to song titles. Westfall said that the album's title and the songs' subjects were about [...] "Separating your self from your peers and really coming into your own." [...] McKinnon said What Separates Me from You was [...] "a lot more personal and darker" [...] than Homesick, and that it was [...] "a natural progression of what we were doing" [...] with [...] "the same core" [...] as the band's preceding albums. Asked whether the album reached new heights, he said it [...] "was definitely the next step" [...] for the band. However, the band originally had no idea on how the album would turn out: [...] "It was a little bit all over the place, because of me coming in, Tom [...] leaving and all this new stuff that was going on", as stated by guitarist Kevin Skaff. Skaff said that McKinnon originally really wanted to name the album Always the Hard Way, but later realized that the hardcore band Terror had already used that title for an album.|$|E
2500|$|Afterwards, Philippousis said: [...] "It {{was just}} about playing one event. There’s no talk about a comeback. Down the line if <b>I</b> <b>see</b> <b>something,</b> maybe close to California, I might do that. It’s one event and that’s it." ...|$|E
60|$|He {{goes up to}} her, all jaw, and <b>I</b> <b>seen</b> <b>something</b> {{that wanted}} dusting {{on the table next}} to 'em, so I went up and began dusting it, so by good luck I {{happened}} to hear the whole thing.|$|R

2500|$|Navratilova responded, [...] "And I'm {{giving it}} back. This is why I speak out. When <b>I</b> <b>see</b> <b>something</b> that I don't like, I'm {{going to speak}} out because {{you can do that}} here. And again, I feel there are too many things {{happening}} that are taking our rights away." ...|$|E
2500|$|Parton has {{repeatedly}} joked about her physical image and surgeries, saying, [...] "It {{takes a lot}} of money to look this cheap." [...] Her breasts have garnered mention of her in several songs including: [...] "Dolly Parton's Hits," [...] by Bobby Braddock, [...] "Marty Feldman Eyes" [...] by Bruce Baum (a parody of [...] "Bette Davis Eyes"), [...] "No Show Jones," [...] by George Jones, and Merle Haggard and [...] "Make Me Proud" [...] by Drake ft. Nicki Minaj. When asked about future plastic surgeries, she famously said, [...] "If <b>I</b> <b>see</b> <b>something</b> sagging, bagging or dragging, I'll get it nipped, tucked or sucked." ...|$|E
2500|$|Over the years, The Exorcists {{critical}} reputation {{has grown}} considerably. The film currently has an 87% [...] "Certified Fresh" [...] approval rating on the Rotten Tomatoes website, based on 67 reviews the website collected. Chicago Tribune film critic Gene Siskel {{placed it in}} the top five films released that year. BBC film critic Mark Kermode believes the film to be the best film ever made saying [...] "There's a theory that great films give back to you whatever it is you bring to them. It's absolutely true with The Exorcist—it reflects the anxieties of the audience. Some people think it's an outright horror-fest, but I don't. It was written by a devout Catholic who hoped it would make people think positively about the existence of God. William Peter Blatty, who wrote the book, thought that if there are demons then there are also angels and life after death. He couldn't see why people thought it was scary. I've seen it about 200 times and every time <b>I</b> <b>see</b> <b>something</b> I haven't seen before." ...|$|E

6000|$|... 'There is {{something}} in that boy's face,' said the old gentleman {{to himself as he}} walked slowly away, tapping his chin with the cover of the book, in a thoughtful manner; 'something that touches and interests me. Can he be innocent? He looked like--Bye the bye,' exclaimed the old gentleman, halting very abruptly, and staring up into the sky, 'Bless my soul!--where have <b>I</b> <b>seen</b> <b>something</b> like that look before?' ...|$|R
6000|$|... "An {{excellent}} end--full of grace, and hope, and Christian faith. <b>I</b> <b>see</b> here, <b>something</b> {{that looks}} like a clergyman's gown--white sleeves--book under the arm--" ...|$|R
60|$|Vio. Hark, I hear footsteps; and now, methinks, <b>I</b> <b>see</b> <b>something</b> {{approaching}} us.|$|E

6000|$|... "It's awfully interesting. I do so want to {{hear about}} 'the Land.' I only know a little about sweated workers, because <b>I</b> <b>see</b> <b>something</b> of them." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "It's quite {{possible}} I may be mistaken, Sydney. But I {{have more than}} once, as <b>I</b> think, <b>seen</b> <b>something</b> in your manner which suggests that you distrust me." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I <b>see</b> <b>something</b> now--or rather <b>I</b> don't <b>see</b> <b>something</b> {{now that}} <b>I</b> {{should like to}} see," [...] Bertie laughed. [...] "I thought you would have got a good dinner ready for me, but <b>I</b> do not <b>see</b> any signs of its being even begun." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Let us go," [...] said Oro. [...] "I do not {{understand}} these rites, but at last in your great and wonderful city <b>I</b> have <b>seen</b> <b>something</b> that is pure and noble." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I {{read the}} daily papers," [...] he remarked. [...] "Didn't <b>I</b> <b>see</b> <b>something</b> {{yesterday}} about Lady Elisabeth Landon having won the scratch prize at Ranelagh at a ladies' golf meeting?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Perhaps {{the tide}} is falling," [...] {{suggested}} Glynn, in an encouraging voice, [...] "and I think <b>I</b> <b>see</b> <b>something</b> like a shore ahead. It will be daylight in half-an-hour or less." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I'm {{sure she}} has talent {{and a very}} refined inspiration. <b>I</b> <b>see</b> <b>something</b> in that corner, covered with a mysterious veil," [...] Mrs. Rooth insinuated; which led Miriam to go on immediately: ...|$|E
6000|$|... "There {{has been}} no need. But now the time has come. Tell them now--send them my message--to put it upon the guides. <b>I</b> <b>see</b> now <b>something</b> to do. <b>I</b> <b>see</b> now why <b>I</b> am here!" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Of fog <b>I</b> have <b>seen</b> <b>something</b> lately, Shepherdess," [...] {{answered}} the dwarf; [...] "and yet I was {{happy in the}} fog, because I was near the Baas. Of hard living <b>I</b> have <b>seen</b> <b>something</b> also, and still I was happy, because I was near the Baas. Once I had a wife and beer in plenty, more than a man could want, and then I was unhappy, because they estranged me from the Baas, {{and he knew that}} I had ceased to be Otter, his servant whom he trusted, and had become a beast. Therefore, Shepherdess, <b>I</b> would <b>see</b> no more of wives and beer." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Selingman is down-stairs," [...] he announced. [...] "I rather {{expected}} <b>I</b> should <b>see</b> <b>something</b> {{of him as}} I didn't go to {{the club}} this afternoon. You won't mind if he comes up?" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Surely {{there is}} another dress left?" [...] said Mrs. Lecount, {{pointing}} to the wardrobe, but touching nothing in it. [...] "Surely <b>I</b> <b>see</b> <b>something</b> hanging in the corner behind that dark shawl?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Like enough, lad. Mayhap it's the pilot's, only it's {{too soon}} {{for him to be}} off again with letters. Maybe it's {{visitors}} to the rock, for <b>I</b> <b>see</b> <b>something</b> like a woman's bonnet." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Yes, I {{can hear}} the old man's voice," [...] said Clym. [...] "So there's to be no dancing, I suppose. And is Thomasin in the room? <b>I</b> <b>see</b> <b>something</b> moving {{in front of the}} candles that resembles her shape, I think." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I dunno. I was poking about {{under them}} lilacs {{in the old}} garden, {{trying to see if}} there was any lilies-of-the-valley out yet. It was dark as a pocket there--and all at once <b>I</b> <b>seen</b> <b>something</b> {{stirring}} and rustling round at the other side of the garden, in those cherry bushes. It was WHITE. I tell you I didn't stop for a second look. I flew over the dyke quicker than quick. I was sure it was Henry Warren's ghost." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I thought <b>I</b> <b>seen</b> <b>something</b> move there," [...] replied Wison. [...] "Fer Gawd's sake let's get outen this," [...] {{and without}} waiting for a word of assent from his {{companion}} the sailor turned and ran at breakneck speed along the little path toward the spot where Divine, Blanco, and Bony Sawyer were stationed. When they arrived Bony was just {{on the point of}} setting out for the spring to fetch water, but at sight of the frightened, breathless men he returned to hear their story.|$|R
6000|$|... "It {{looks as}} though all the moles in England had been let loose in it. <b>I</b> have <b>seen</b> <b>something</b> of the sort {{on the side of}} a hill near Ballarat, where the prospectors had been at work." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Nay, David," [...] {{said the}} leader, [...] "if I mind me rightly, the Lady Elftrud of Boyatt wedded a brave Norman of that name. Art thou her son? <b>I</b> <b>see</b> <b>something</b> of her face, and thou hast an English tongue." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Forgive me if I am not {{justified}} in what I ask," [...] said Scrooge, looking intently at the Spirit's robe, [...] "but <b>I</b> <b>see</b> <b>something</b> strange, and not belonging to yourself, protruding from your skirts. Is it {{a foot or}} a claw?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... “What cat?” said Byrne uneasily. “Oh, <b>I</b> <b>see.</b> <b>Something</b> suspicious. No, señor. I guessed nothing. My {{nation are}} not good guessers at that sort of thing; and, therefore, I ask you plainly whether that wine-seller has spoken the truth in other particulars?” ...|$|E
60|$|When I {{heard the}} united sound {{of all the}} voices, giving force to these simple and pathetic words, I thought <b>I</b> could <b>see</b> <b>something</b> {{of the reason why}} that rude old {{translation}} still holds its place in Scotland.|$|R
6000|$|... "I think not, for <b>I</b> might <b>see</b> <b>something</b> sad, and {{everyone}} looks so happy now, I don't believe {{they could be}} much improved." [...] And Jo's eyes went slowly round the room, brightening as they looked, for the prospect was a pleasant one.|$|R
6000|$|... "No, no, dear. I {{know that}} you mean what you say, but <b>I</b> have <b>seen</b> <b>something</b> of the world, and I know that such {{arrangements}} never answer. There cannot be two masters in a house, and yet at my age my freedom is very necessary to me." ...|$|R
