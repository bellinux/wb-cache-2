Between 1991 and 2000, the pair competed in multiple {{national and international}} championships, including three Olympic Games and two World Equestrian Games. They won one gold medal and four silver medals at the Olympics and one gold and three silvers at the World Equestrian Games. Although known for having a hot temperament, Bonfire mellowed as he aged, becoming one of Van Grunsven's best horses – until she found his replacement, Salinero, {{she did not think}} she would ever find a horse to match Bonfire's talent.

The tropical storm watch was quickly upgraded to a tropical storm warning. In the Dominican Republic, authorities ordered the evacuation of at least 30,000people living in areas where flooding was possible. On October22 and 23, the Haitian government ordered level 1 and then level 2 alerts for the county in anticipation of Tropical Storm Alpha's rainfall. Haiti was already experiencing flooding from Hurricane Wilma's passage between October8 and 19, so the threat of more rainfall was particularly dire. The country's Centre National de Meteorologie issued weather bulletins through existing media distribution channels with clear instructions on how residences should prepare for floods and landslides. The local government of Sud-Est ordered the evacuation of its capital city, Jacmel. The national government mobilized personnel and resources of the Direction of Civil Protection, the Secrétariat Permanent de <b>Gestion</b> des Risques et des Désastres (SPGRD), and the National Police to pre-arranged Emergency Operation Centres.|$|E

40|$|Children {{represent}} an increasing part of web users. One {{of the key}} problems that hamper their search experience is their limited vocabulary, their difficulty to use the right keywords, and the inappropriateness of general- purpose query suggestions. In this work, we propose a method that uses tags from social media to suggest queries related to children’s topics. Concretely, we propose a simple, yet effective approach to bias a random walk defined on a bipartite graph of web resources and tags through keywords that are more commonly used to describe resources for children. We evaluate our method using a large query log sample of queries submitted by children. We show that our method outperforms by a large margin the query suggestions of modern search engines and state-of-the art query sug- <b>gestions</b> based on random walks. We improve further {{the quality of the}} ranking by combining the score of the random walk with topical and language modeling fea- tures to emphasize even more the child-related aspects of the query suggestions...|$|R
40|$|Among the handicraft, art {{of being}} a {{coppersmith}} has been occurred intensively in the past. The fast developing socio - economic structure diminished the value and {{the place of the}} copper vessels. Heavy and beautiful vessels made by beating left their places to thin, light aluminum, pl astic, glass and steel vessels made by machinery. The demand for copper is diminished. Therefore being a coppersmith has become less and less important every day. However, in the last few years, copper vessels becoming a touristic souvenir became a source of hope for the traditional coppersmith art to live on. Copperworking is applied in our country in some regions and there are people who live off it.

These sug- <b>gestions</b> can help users make better decisions on choosing products or services, such as which film to watch, what music to listen to or which travel insurance to buy. When making suggestions, many recommender systems do not consider contextual information, such as location or time [5]. Recommender systems that make use of contextual information are called context-aware recommender systems. Many context-aware recommender systems can not generate reliable rec- ommendations on sparse data. Besides, in most context-aware recommender systems, the contexts are pre-defined and not personalised. These limitations of existing methods usually lead to inaccurate recommendations. In this thesis, new context-aware recommendation methods are presented. In these methods, personalised contexts are defined based on users’ activity patterns. The underlying associations between contexts are analysed, and similar contexts are combined so that the system can make use of existing data collected in similar contexts. Experimental results from two datasets show that the proposed methods can achieve significantly higher recommendation accuracy than existing context-aware recommendation methods...|$|R
40|$|The {{purpose of}} this thesis is to {{contribute}} to the virtual univer- sity initiative at NTNU with some initial recommendations for the early design and development of a virtual university hospital. The findings in this thesis are based on a preliminary study and two ex- ploratory studies using a virtual operating room (designed to recreate a real one at St. Olavs hospital) with both medical and non-medical participants. The goal of the studies has been to explore how to sup- port educational activities at a virtual university hospital. The first participant category was represented by surgical and anesthesia post graduate nursing students who conducted role play of realistic and relevant scenarios in the virtual operating room. The non-medical participants got a virtual guided tour around in the same operating room. Both participant groups provided suggestions for further devel- opment of the virtual hospital.

40|$|This work {{presents}} {{a new perspective}} on characterizing the similarity between elements of a database or, more generally, nodes of a weighted and undirected graph. It is based on a Markov-chain model of random walk through the database. More precisely, we compute quantities (the average commute time, the pseudoinverse of the Laplacian matrix of the graph, etc) that provide similarities between any pair of nodes, having the nice property of increasing when the number of paths connect- ing those elements increases and when the “length” of paths decreases. It turns out that the square root of the average commute time is a Eu- clidean distance and that the pseudoinverse of the Laplacian matrix is a kernel (its elements are inner products closely related to commute times). A procedure for computing the subspace projection of the node vectors of the graph that preserves as much variance as possible in terms of the commute-time distance – a principal component analysis (PCA) of the graph – is also introduced. This graph PCA provides a nice interpreta- tion to the “Fiedler vector”, widely used for graph partitioning. The model is evaluated on a collaborative-recommendation task where sug- <b>gestions</b> are made about which movies people should watch based upon what they watched in the past. Experimental results on the MovieLens database show that the Laplacian-based similarities (the pseudoinverse of the Laplacian matrix and the “random-forest matrix”) perform well in comparison with other methods. The model, which nicely fits into the so-called “statistical relational learning” framework, could also be usedto compute document or word similarities, and, more generally, it could be applied to machine-learning and pattern-recognition tasks involving a database...|$|R
40|$|This study {{looks at}} the {{functions}} of watching sports for an expatriate living in Taipei, Taiwan - specifically rugby fans because {{during the time of}} study Super Rugby was taking place. With the emergence of online streaming, watching live sports games that take place {{in other parts of the}} world, is made possible and more convenient. Previous studies came up with different theories as to why people watched sports and this pa- per researched whether those theories applies to the expatriate community or if there is a unique difference. In order to find data, field observations were done at both pub- lic and private settings. There are two sports pubs in Taipei, The Brass Monkey and On Tap, that have a large expat audience and therefore, were chosen for public field observations. The private field observations were made at the home of a rugby fan who watched games on a weekly basis with three other participants. This study looked at what social behaviors (such as high-fiving each other) and interactions took place while watching sports in the bars and private home. Prior to the field observa- tions were interviews done on the group of sports fans to direct what to look for in field observations. The paper classifies motivations for watching sports as an expat, using Gantz’s 1981 study with additional motivations that was more appropriate for recent studies. Results found that while there were similarities with previous theories on how watching sports with others enhance some behaviors, the notion of patriotism was not exemplified as other studies may imply. Discussions focuses on how sport watching is not just about the act of supporting specific teams, but instead building a social community. Lastly, after completing the field observations and interviews, sug- <b>gestions</b> for future studies is discussed. ...|$|R

40|$|The {{theory of}} a {{catalyst}} of growth, {{as proposed by}} Robertson, has been the stimulus {{for a number of}} investigations to determine the pres ence or absence of an autocatalyst in protozoan cultures. The earlier investigations have been reviewed previously (Jahn, 1929), and it was shown experimentally at this time that the growth rate of Euglena in mass cultures of high concentrations of organisms was not higher than in cultures of relatively low concentrations, but that in most cases the reverse was true. It is {{the purpose of the present}} paper to reanalyze the experimental data previously obtained (Jahn, 1929) from the point of view of rela tive rate of division at various times during the period of observation. It will be shown, first, that the division rate, as calculated from the autocatalytic formula used by Robertson in his work on ciliates, is a progressively decreasing quantity, and hence that this autocatalytic equation can not be interpreted to involve an autocatalyst which effects an increase in division rate; and second, that, on the basis of experi mental evidence, the autocatalytic equation may fit the growth curve of Euglena cultures. On the basis of the experimental evidence, it is believed that Robertson's theory of an autocatalyst of growth is un necessary to an interpretation of the experimental data obtained in the case of Euglena. The writer is deeply indebted to Professor R. P. Hall for sug <b>gestions</b> offered during the preparation of this paper.

This information is complementary to a review on shallow-water work along the Scotia Arc (Barnes, 2005) and recent work done in the deep sea (Brandt and Hilbig, 2004). While principally referring to shipboard work in deeper water, above all during the recent international EASIZ and LAMPOS campaigns, relevant work from shore stations is also included. Six years after the first IBMANT symposium, significant progress has been made along the latitudinal gradient from the Magellan region to the high Antarctic in the fields of biodiversity, biogeography and community structure, life strategies and adaptations, the role of disturbance and its significance for biodiversity, and trophic coupling of the benthic realm with the water column and sea ice. A better understanding has developed of the role of evolutionary and ecological factors in shaping past and present-day environmental conditions, species composition and distribution, and ecosystem functioning. Furthermore, the science community engaged in unravelling Antarctic-Magellan interactions has advanced in methodological aspects such as new analytical approaches for comparing biodiversity derived from visual methods, growth and age determination, trophic modelling using stable isotope ratios, and molecular approaches for taxonomic and phylogenetic purposes.

40|$|Over the ages, Wielkopolska {{had been}} a uniform entity from the cultural, {{immigration}} and legal points of view. This structure was destroyed only by the 1815 partition of Poland, when Wielkopolska was divided between Prussia and Russia. In common understanding, the territory of Wielkopolska {{is limited to the}} former Prussian dominion, with Northern border along the Noteć river and Eastern border along t h e Prosną river. However, hardly anybody remembers that Northern territories (Wałcz and Nakło regions) and Southern territories (Wschowa region) for many ages were the integral parts of Wielkopolska. The area of Wielkopolska changed with the changes in political situation of the state. Wielkopolska occupied t h e largest area after 1945, when it comprised ca. 40. 000 km and included a part of regamed Territories, inhabited both by immigrants from Eastern temtories of Poland as well as the immigrants from the Poznań province. In 1950 Zielona Góra province was created; in consequence for the first part in the Polish history Western border of Wielkopolska was not the border of t h e state. The unfortunate administrative reform of 1975, which divided Poland into 49 provinces, introduced the widest changes into a historically shaped area of Wielkopolska. Former Wielkopolska was divided into 5 provinces. However, the memories about belonging to Wielkopolska are still vivid. It was proved by questionnaire research carried out by the author in 1992 in 384 communes from the area of 8 provinces which formerly belonged, partly or wholly, to Wielkopolska. One of t h e <b>gestions</b> pertained to the choice of the territory to which a given commune would like to belong fi new administrative division of the state were introduced. From among 319 answers (84 %), 213 communes indicated Wielkopolska, and 5 answered that Wielkopolska is their likely choice. In this way a former Wielkopolska region in its pre- 1975 borders was reconstructed; moreover, included the area which belonged to Wielkopolska between 1945 and 1950, as well as the area of southern and central parts of former Bydgoszcz Regency from the period 1815 - 1938.

Radioactive waste from reprocessing French spent fuel is expected to be disposed of in a geological repository, pursuant to legislation enacted in 1991 that established a 15-year period for conducting radioactive waste management research. Under this legislation, partition and transmutation of long-lived elements, immobilization and conditioning processes, and long-term near surface storage are being investigated by [...] the Commissariat à l’Energie Atomique (CEA). Disposal in deep geological formations is being studied by the French agency for radioactive waste management, L'Agence Nationale pour la <b>Gestion</b> des Déchets Radioactifs, in underground research labs.|$|E
