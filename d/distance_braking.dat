40|$|Rear-end {{collision}} {{is one of}} {{the most}} frequent accidents occurring on roadways. This chapter investigates how vehicle’s local parameters in a platoon of cars (i. e., perception and information collection, vehicle speed, safe <b>distance,</b> <b>braking</b> parameters) affect the global behavior of the traffic system in terms of rear-end collision avoidance (CA). In fact, microscopic car following models capture the tactical maneuvering decisions of drivers, in order to maintain a safe distance and avoid collision with the lead vehicles. Furthermore, the chapter describes how vehicle-to-vehicle (V 2 V) wireless communication networks can be used in preventing rear-end collisions. Finally, as an example, the design and evaluation of an adaptive inter-vehicle CA communication protocol is provided. This protocol is capable of maintaining high reliability and efficiency in the face of large variations in vehicular traffic and wireless network conditions...|$|E
40|$|Report covers period: 2 / 95 - 8 / 96 To {{demonstrate}} {{the usefulness of}} an enhanced driving simulator capable of displaying traffic, 24 drivers participated in an experiment evaluating alternative formats for collision warnings that might appear on a head-up display. During a 15 minute drive (at 35 mi/hr), subjects passed 17 parked cars and 8 oncoming cars, and briefly followed 2 cars (that separately pulled out {{from the side of}} the road and then sped off). Subsequently, subjects encountered a car that pulled out from the roadside unexpectedly, requiring subjects to brake and/or swerve to avoid a collision. Each of the 3 warning conditions was responded to by 8 drivers. There were 3 collisions (out of a maximum of 8, 1 per driver) when an icon warning (showing the path to take) was presented, 5 collisions in response to a "swerve left" text warning, and 7 when no warning was presented. Additional data were collected for a second encounter (after another 13 minutes of driving); however, the crash rates were very low (the car pulling out was not a complete surprise), calling into question the value of exposing a subject to multiple scenarios for collision avoidance experiments. Also explored were alternative measures of collision avoidance: subjective ratings of helpfulness, lateral clearance, impact speed, lane crossing position, throttle release <b>distance,</b> <b>braking</b> onset distance, and peak lateral acceleration. These measures, all ratio scale values, were thought to be more sensitive than collision counts to warning design differences. They were not. There were no significant differences in them due to warning format, suggesting that the number of crashes should be the primary performance measure...|$|E

The basic theory for the <b>braking</b> <b>distance</b> was derived using {{the law of}} the energy conservation. In this basic theory, the <b>braking</b> <b>distance</b> was compared with difference collision speed and arm angles of enforcement device. And also, the collision experiment was carried out by simple model of the enforcement device and the car. The behavior of the enforcement device was examined by the simple model with 3 kinds of different arm angles. The <b>braking</b> <b>distance</b> by the experiment was well agreement with theoretical result.

40|$|The {{emergency}} <b>braking</b> <b>distance</b> of {{the present}} Shinkansen is just under 4, 000 m (E 2 series at 275 km/h). If increasing initial braking speed to 360 km/h while leaving the braking performance as-is, the emergency <b>braking</b> <b>distance</b> will extend to as long as approx. 7, 000 m. But {{the analysis of the}} risk increase in case of earthquake due to Shinkansen speed increases indicates that {{the most effective way to}} control that risk is to keep the emergency <b>braking</b> <b>distance</b> from becoming longer as much as possible. Accordingly, we decided to develop a brake system to deal with speed increase in the FASTECH project, aiming for an approx. 4, 000 m emergency <b>braking</b> <b>distance</b> at 360 km/h.

40|$|Purpose. As {{part of the}} {{scientific}} paper {{it is necessary to}} study the waveform impact of the braking cylinders filling on longitudinal train dynamics at different modes of braking. At this one should estimate the level of maximum longitudinal forces and <b>braking</b> <b>distance</b> size in freight cars of various lengths. Methodology. In this paper we attempt to approximate the actual diagram of braking cylinders filling with rational functions of varying degrees. In selection of coefficients in the required functions the highest values of the longitudinal forces and <b>braking</b> <b>distances</b> were used as controlled parameters. They were compared with similar values obtained as a result of experimental rides. The level of longitudinal forces and <b>braking</b> <b>distances</b> amount were evaluated by means of mathematical modeling of train longitudinal vibrations, caused by different braking modes. Findings. At mathematical modeling was assumed that the train consists of 60 uniform four-axle gondola cars, weight of 80 tons, equipped with air dispenser No. 483 included in the median operation, composite braking blocks, and one locomotive VL- 8. Train before braking has been pre-stretched. Various types of pneumatic braking (emergency, full service and adjusting braking) of the freight train on the horizontal section of the track were simulated. As the calculation results were obtained values of the longitudinal forces, <b>braking</b> <b>distances</b> amounts and reduction time in speed at various braking modes. Originality. Waveform impact of the braking cylinders filling on the longitudinal forces level and <b>braking</b> <b>distances</b> amount in freight trains were investigated. Also the longitudinal loading of freight trains at various pneumatic braking was investigated. Practical value. Obtained results can be used to assess the level of largest longitudinal forces and <b>braking</b> <b>distances</b> in the freight trains of different lengths by mathematical modeling of different braking modes...|$|R

40|$|This paper {{presents}} a novel piezoactuator-based valve for vehicle ABS. The piezoactuator located in {{one side of}} a rigid beam makes a displacement required to control the pressure at a flapper-nozzle of the pneumatic valve. In order to obtain the wide control range of the pressure, a pressure modulator comprised of dual-type cylinder and piston is proposed. The governing equation of the piezovalve system which consists of the proposed piezoactuator-based valve and the pressure modulator is obtained. The longitudinal vehicle dynamics and the wheel slip condition are then formulated. In order to evaluate the performance of the proposed piezovalve system from the viewpoint of the vehicle ABS, a sliding mode controller is designed for wheel slip control. The tracking control performances for the desired wheel slip rate are evaluated and the braking performances in terms of <b>braking</b> <b>distance</b> are then presented on different road conditions (dry asphalt, wet asphalt, and wet jennite). It is clearly shown that the desired wheel slip rate is well achieved and the <b>braking</b> <b>distance</b> and <b>braking</b> time can be significantly reduced by using the proposed piezovalve system associated with the slip rate controller...|$|R
