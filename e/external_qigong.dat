50|$|Qigong {{comprises}} {{a diverse}} set of practices that coordinate body (調身), breath (調息), and mind (調心) based on Chinese philosophy. Practices include moving and still meditation, massage, chanting, sound meditation, and non-contact treatments, {{performed in a}} broad array of body postures. Qigong is commonly classified into two foundational categories: 1) dynamic or active qigong (dong gong), with slow flowing movement; and 2) meditative or passive qigong (jing gong), with still positions and inner movement of the breath. From a therapeutic perspective, qigong can be classified into two systems:1) internal qigong, which focuses on self-care and self-cultivation, and;2) <b>external</b> <b>qigong,</b> which involves treatment by a therapist who directs or transmits qi.|$|E
40|$|Lin Zixin et al's {{new book}} "Qigong: Chinese Medicine or Pseudoscience? " (Prometheus Books, NY, 2000) {{is among the}} few Qigong books that tried to conduct some {{scientific}} explora-tion of the Qigong essence. If you are seriously looking for Qigong's scientific background, or planning to conduct some scientific research on Qigong and its applications, this book will defi-nitely be helpful to avoid you from taking all Qigong as granted truth, and from simplifying the research design. The book consists of five chapters: 1. Traditional Chinese Medicine and Qigong, started with the glorious history of Qigong, it reveals the ancient origin of Qigong, some important methods, facts about Qigong {{and the benefits of}} Qigong practice. 2. <b>External</b> <b>Qigong,</b> it basi-cally denies the very existence of <b>external</b> <b>Qigong</b> and criticizes some famous research on exter-nal Qigong done in the 1980 s. Authors claimed that the essence of Qigong is mind activities or psychological effects. 3. Itinerant Quackery, completely denied the possibility that Qigong may be used to diagnose diseases, and revealed how some street quackery used the name of "Qigong super abilities " to cheat patients. 4. The Debate on Human Extraordinary Ability vs. Qigong (Inner Kung Fu), it discloses some fake Qigong demonstrations and the reality of unsuccessfu...|$|E
40|$|Abstract Background Practitioners of the {{alternative}} medical practice 'external Qigong' generally claim the ability to emit or direct "healing energy" to treat patients. We investigated the ability of experienced Qigong practitioners to enhance the healthy growth of cultured human cells {{in a series of}} studies, each following a rigorously designed protocol with randomization, blinding and controls for variability. Methods Qigong practitioners directed healing intentionality toward normal brain cell cultures in a basic science laboratory. Qigong treatments were delivered for 20 minutes from a minimum distance of 10 centimeters. Cell proliferation was measured by a standard colony-forming efficiency (CFE) assay and a CFE ratio (CFE for treated samples/CFE for sham samples) was the dependent measure for each experiment. Results During a pilot study (8 experiments), a trend of increased cell proliferation in Qigong-treated samples (CFE Qigong/sham ratios > 1. 0) was observed (P = 0. 162). In a formal study (28 experiments), a similar trend was observed, with Qigong-treated samples showing on average more colony formation than sham samples (P = 0. 036). In a replication study (60 experiments), no significant difference between Qigong-treated samples and sham samples was observed (P = 0. 465). Conclusion We observed an apparent increase in the proliferation of cultured cells following <b>external</b> <b>Qigong</b> treatment by practitioners under strictly controlled conditions, but we did not observe this effect in a replication study. These results suggest the need for more controlled and thorough investigation of <b>external</b> <b>Qigong</b> before scientific validation is claimed. </p...|$|E
40|$|OBJECTIVES: This {{pilot study}} {{examined}} the feasibility, preliminary efficacy, and determined the effect sizes of <b>external</b> <b>qigong</b> therapy (EQT) in reducing cue-elicited cocaine craving and associated symptoms among recently abstinent cocaine-dependent (CD) individuals. METHODS: This study randomized 101 CD subjects to either a real EQT (n= 51) or sham EQT control (n= 50) group. Subjects underwent a baseline assessment and a weekly cue-exposure session for 2 weeks. Total EQT or sham treatments ranged from 4 to 6 sessions in 2 weeks. RESULTS: EQT-treated subjects displayed a greater reduction in cue-elicited craving (p= 0. 06) and symptoms of depression (p 3 ̆c 0. 05) with medium effect sizes. CONCLUSIONS: This study demonstrated the feasibility of delivering EQT among CD individuals early in residential treatment. Future research should include a larger sample and examine the mechanisms and potential longitudinal benefits of EQT...|$|E
40|$|Objectives: Although qigong is an {{important}} part of Traditional Chinese medicine (TCM) based on a phi-losophy similar to acupuncture, few studies of qigong exist in the Western medicine literature. To evaluate qigong therapy as a modality in treating chronic pain conditions such as fibromyalgia syndrome (FMS), we re-port a pilot trial of 10 women with severe FMS who experienced significant improvement after <b>external</b> <b>qigong</b> therapy (EQT). Design: Ten patients with FMS completed five to seven sessions of EQT over 3 weeks with pre- and post-treatment assessment and a 3 -month follow-up. Each treatment lasted approximately 40 minutes. Outcome measures: Tender point count (TPC) and Fibromyalgia Impact Questionnaire (FIQ) were the pri-mary measures. McGill Pain Questionnaire (MPQ), Beck Depression Inventory (BDI), anxiety, and self-effi-cacy were the secondary outcomes. Results: Subjects demonstrated improvement in functioning, pain, and other symptoms. The mean TPC was reduced from 136. 6 to 59. 5 after EQT treatment; mean MPQ decreased from 27. 0 to 7. 2; mean FIQ from 70. 1 to 37. 3; and mean BDI from 24. 3 to 8. 3 (all p 0. 01). Many subjects reported reductions in other FMS symp-toms, and two reported they were completely symptom-free. Results from the 3 -month follow-up indicated some slight rebound from the post-treatment measures, but still much better than those observed at baseline. Conclusions: Treatment with EQT resulting in complete recovery for some FMS patients suggests that TCM may be very effective for treating pain and the multiplicity of symptoms associated with FMS. Larger con-trolled trials of this promising intervention are urgently needed. 85...|$|E
