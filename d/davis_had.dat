5|$|After this {{successful}} {{series of}} patrols, Davis {{was ordered to}} conduct only one patrol a day {{in order to minimize}} the risk to him. The order had previously been sent on December 1, but <b>Davis</b> <b>had</b> apparently ignored it. Both the Air Force and Davis' family had growing concerns that Chinese and Soviet pilots would be gunning for Davis, given his success and fame. By this point, <b>Davis</b> <b>had</b> 12 victories, and the second-highest scoring aces each had 6 victories. Davis was averaging one victory for three missions.|$|E
5|$|The {{subsequent}} events {{remain in}} dispute. Henry Davis, a teenage black employee of Oscar Davis, maintained that Odell Waller had fired at Oscar Davis without provocation or warning, hitting him four times. Oscar Davis's sons testified {{that their father}} had stated before he died that Waller had shot him without cause. One son added that <b>Davis</b> <b>had</b> said Waller had continued to shoot after <b>Davis</b> <b>had</b> already fallen to the ground. The testimony of other witnesses, including Waller's relatives, was inconclusive, as they were too distant to hear the conversation between Waller and Davis. Waller stated that <b>Davis</b> <b>had</b> refused to let him take the Waller family share of the wheat, and had reached for his pocket as if to draw a gun; Waller then fired on Davis.|$|E
5|$|In 1831, {{construction}} on the third state capitol building began.

5|$|On December 13, {{another group}} of MiG-15s {{attacked}} Davis during a morning patrol near Yongwon. Davis destroyed one MiG, and as a second MiG attempted to target his wingman, Davis outmaneuvered it and shot it down. At {{the end of the}} patrol, <b>Davis</b> <b>had</b> amassed 10 victories, making him the first double ace of the war. During an afternoon patrol commanding twenty-two F-86's, Davis spotted fifty MiGs in the Sunchun, South Korea area heading further south towards the Taechon area.
