5|$|I was at {{the command}} post and {{listening}} to the radio communication between the pilots. I realised immediately something serious had happened; <b>I</b> <b>knew</b> <b>they</b> <b>were</b> still in flight and that they were trying to bring Marseille over the lines into our territory and that his aircraft was emitting a lot of smoke.|$|E
500|$|In an {{interview}} with Entertainment Weekly, Fey said when the writing staff is developing a script, [...] "We'll have an actor in mind and we'll keep referring to them. Like for this we said, 'Then Hamm comes in, blah blah blah.'" [...] She believed {{that there was no}} possibility of getting Hamm, but [...] "we were lucky with the timing because Mad Men was on hiatus and he was hosting SNL. So I called over there and asked them , 'Hey, is that guy funny? Tell me the truth.' And they were like, 'Yes, he's really funny.' By Saturday <b>I</b> <b>knew</b> <b>they</b> <b>were</b> right." ...|$|E

2500|$|On January 2, 2006, an {{explosion}} at Sago mine in West Virginia trapped several miners underground. The following day, Browne {{was a guest}} on the radio program Coast to Coast AM with George Noory. At {{the start of the}} broadcast, it was believed that 12 of 13 miners trapped by the disaster had been found alive and, when Noory asked Browne if the reported lack of noise from inside the mine might have led her to think the men had died, she replied, [...] "No; <b>I</b> <b>knew</b> <b>they</b> <b>were</b> going to be found." [...] Later in the program, it was discovered that the earlier news reports had been in error; Browne said, [...] "I don't think there's anybody alive, maybe one... I just don't think they are alive", adding, subsequently, that she [...] "didn't believe that they were alive... I did believe that they were gone." ...|$|E

6000|$|... "How should <b>I</b> <b>know</b> <b>they</b> <b>were</b> great {{fighters and}} unafraid?" [...] Tyee demanded, spurred to defence by {{recollection}} of the dark looks and vague complaints.|$|R
6000|$|... "They won't harm us, mother," [...] {{said the}} younger woman huskily. [...] "They <b>are</b> friends. <b>I</b> <b>know</b> <b>they</b> <b>are</b> friends. Come, sit by me, mother." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Had <b>I</b> <b>known</b> <b>they</b> <b>were</b> so lively," [...] remarked the giantess, as she crawled {{from beneath}} the table, [...] "we should have eaten them before this." ...|$|R
6000|$|... 'Have {{you nothing}} to say?' she continued. 'Your {{footsteps}} were audible {{to me from}} the very bottom, and <b>I</b> <b>knew</b> <b>they</b> <b>were</b> yours. You look almost restored.' ...|$|E
6000|$|... "It’s no use finding {{fault with}} me," [...] said Fraser, quickly, {{as he stepped}} along beside him, [...] "so don’t try it. They came down into the cabin before <b>I</b> <b>knew</b> <b>they</b> <b>were</b> aboard, even." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "My dears," [...] said Aunt Viney placidly, [...] "Mrs. Amador and I {{have always}} nodded to each other, and <b>I</b> <b>knew</b> <b>they</b> <b>were</b> only {{waiting for the}} {{slightest}} encouragement. I gave it, and they're coming." ...|$|E

6000|$|... "Maybe the {{two things}} go together. Anyhow, I couldn't let her go. Besides, with this crowd about, it was well {{that she should have}} someone near to look after her. Then, when the cable came, <b>I</b> <b>knew</b> <b>they</b> <b>were</b> bound to make a move." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "An {{invitation}} to dinner for this evening," [...] said Marian opening it; [...] "ah! <b>I</b> <b>knew</b> <b>they</b> <b>were</b> {{to have a}} party; 'just recollected that Lady Julia Faulkner used to know Fern Torr, and I must have you to meet her, {{if it is not}} a great bore.'" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Yes, I saw him--up to the ranch. He {{came with}} a letter, and that spoilt about everything, for it was a warning. They found out who he was through that Baxter and made him a prisoner. Then I had to sneak away, for <b>I</b> <b>knew</b> <b>they</b> <b>were</b> after me, too." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I'm {{not worried}} about them, but <b>I</b> <b>know</b> <b>they</b> <b>are</b> {{worrying}} about us. They'll surely start back this morning; but <b>they</b> may not <b>be</b> able to reach us till night." ...|$|R

6000|$|His merriness gladdened her. [...] "They {{are only}} little things," [...] she said, [...] "and I {{have grown to}} love them. <b>I</b> <b>know</b> <b>they</b> <b>are</b> flaws; but <b>I</b> love them because----" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "You {{will never}} see them again--they are destroyed. They came from Satan. I saw the hell-brand on them, and <b>I</b> <b>knew</b> <b>they</b> <b>were</b> sent to betray me to sin." [...] Then he fell to gabbling strange and dreadful things which were not clearly understandable, and which the doctor admonished them to keep to themselves.|$|E
60|$|Oh that Juvenal or Johnson {{could rise}} from the dead! Expende--quot libras in duce summo invenies? [3] <b>I</b> <b>knew</b> <b>they</b> <b>were</b> light {{in the balance of}} mortality; but I thought their living dust weighed more carats. [4] Alas! this {{imperial}} diamond hath a flaw in it, and is now hardly fit to stick in a glazier's pencil:--the pen of the historian won't rate it worth a ducat.|$|E
6000|$|... "About {{ten o'clock}} the silver dollars {{dropping}} {{on the bar}} slowed down to playing two-steps and marches instead of jigs. But I {{looked out the window}} and saw a hundred or two of our customers standing in line at Bird City Savings and Loan Co., and <b>I</b> <b>knew</b> <b>they</b> <b>were</b> borrowing more money to be sucked in by the clammy tendrils of the octopus.|$|E
6000|$|... "I'll take my chances!" [...] {{returned}} Uncle Barney. [...] "I've {{got those}} deeds, and <b>I</b> <b>know</b> <b>they</b> <b>are</b> all O. K. Now, you clear out--and don't you dare {{to come here}} again!" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I guess so--anyway <b>they</b> <b>was</b> prowlin' {{around the}} hen house an' the barn. I called an' asked 'em {{what they wanted}} and they ran for dear life--so <b>I</b> <b>knew</b> <b>they</b> <b>was</b> up to no good." ...|$|R
6000|$|... 'The rascals!' said Latimer, getting {{now into}} a rage, {{though he had}} seemed quite meek when Stockdale first came up. ''Tis {{the same set of}} fellows. <b>I</b> <b>know</b> <b>they</b> <b>were</b> Moynton chaps to a man.' ...|$|R
6000|$|<b>I</b> <b>knew</b> <b>they</b> <b>were</b> {{the evil}} geniuses of Dermot's life. Lord Malvoisin {{had been his}} first tempter as boys at their tutor's, {{and again in the}} Guards; and Ernest, or Nessy, Horsman was the mauvais sujet of the family, who never was heard of without some disgraceful story. [...] And Dermot had led my boys among these. All that had brightened life so much to me had {{suddenly}} vanished.|$|E
6000|$|... "But {{what can}} I do now? I {{am in the}} stream, and I must go with it. I know not what I wish or what I would do. Six months ago I felt certain. Now I doubt. It {{seemed to me that}} in a day the English Raj would be swept away. How could it be {{otherwise}} when the whole army that had conquered India for them were against them? <b>I</b> <b>knew</b> <b>they</b> <b>were</b> brave, but we have never lacked bravery.

60|$|It was {{a curious}} debate in that intense gloom which, close as our faces were together, {{prevented}} us from seeing anything of each other, except once when a sudden flare of summer lightning revealed them, white and unnatural {{as those of}} ghosts. On our present dangers I did not dwell, putting them aside lightly, though <b>I</b> <b>knew</b> <b>they</b> <b>were</b> not light. But of the alternative as to whether {{we should try to}} escape to Lydenburg and civilization, or to Zululand and savagery, I felt it to be my duty to speak.|$|E
6000|$|... "Yes, <b>I</b> <b>know</b> <b>they</b> <b>are</b> in force; but, {{what are}} the red-skins about? Is the hatchet buried, among the Six Nations, that you are {{satisfied}} with being a runner, when scalps may be had near Ticonderoga?" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "It's all the same. <b>I</b> <b>knowed</b> <b>they</b> <b>was</b> {{something}} funny about 'em. Had the allwise steer to the yellow. That Laura Sibley was goin' to take 'em {{right to the}} spot where they'd all be millionaires." ...|$|R
6000|$|... 'And {{you don't}} like strangers?' laughed Birkin. 'I myself can never see why one should {{take account of}} people, just because <b>they</b> happen to <b>be</b> {{in the room with}} one: why SHOULD <b>I</b> <b>know</b> <b>they</b> <b>are</b> there?' ...|$|R
