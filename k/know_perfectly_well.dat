2500|$|I watch none. He [...] {{sits and}} listens and I read books, because I <b>know</b> <b>perfectly</b> <b>well</b> that, don't take offense, that 90 {{percent of what}} I hear on {{television}} is supposition, when we're talking about the news. And he's not, not as understanding of my pettiness about that. But why should we hear about body bags and deaths, and how many, what day it's gonna happen, and how many this or that or what do you suppose? Or, I mean, it's not relevant. So, why should I waste my beautiful mind on something like that, and watch him suffer.|$|E
2500|$|The music {{industry}} suggested that iPods {{have a substantial}} and legitimate commercial use in contrast to Grokster, to which Souter replied, [...] "I <b>know</b> <b>perfectly</b> <b>well</b> that I can buy a CD {{and put it on}} my iPod. But I also know if I can get music without buying it, I'm going to do so." [...] On the other hand, the justices seemed troubled at the prospect of ruling that Grokster's alleged business model of actively inducing infringement and then reaping the commercial benefits was shielded from liability. Grokster argued that affirming the Ninth Circuit would only prevent an injunction against future use of the P2P software, while the plaintiffs would still be free to pursue damages in the district court for alleged past wrongful acts. Much of the Court, however, expressed skepticism that Grokster's continuing enterprise could be severable from the consequences of those prior acts.|$|E
