5|$|Another concern <b>is</b> <b>the</b> <b>risk</b> of {{clearing}} rain forests and other environmentally valuable land for sugarcane production, {{such as the}} Amazon rainforest, the Pantanal or the Cerrado. Embrapa has rebutted this concern explaining that 99.7% of sugarcane plantations are located at least 2,000km from the Amazon, and expansion during the last 25 years {{took place in the}} Center-South region, also far away from the Amazon rainforest, the Pantanal or the Atlantic forest. In São Paulo state growth took place in abandoned pasture lands. The impact assessment commissioned by the Dutch government supported this argument.|$|E

Methods Allele-specific and a multiplex PCR were employed to identify the genotypes {{of them in a}} case-control study of 210 lung cancer patients and 210 matched controls. Results The CYP 1 A 1 (Val/Val) and GSTM 1 (-) <b>were</b> <b>the</b> <b>risk</b> factor of lung cancer, <b>the</b> OR <b>was</b> 2. 56 and 1. 89 respectively. <b>The</b> relative <b>risk</b> increased to 2. 6 – fold when the patients carried with two valine alleles in cases of SCC. GSTM 1 (-) <b>was</b> <b>the</b> <b>risk</b> factor of SCC (OR= 2. 39) and AC(OR= 2. 16). <b>The</b> light smokers <b>were</b> <b>the</b> <b>risk</b> factor for lung cancer. Conclusion The valine allele of CYP 1 A 1 <b>was</b> <b>the</b> <b>risk</b> factor of lung cancer especially for SCC and GSTM 1 (-) <b>was</b> <b>the</b> <b>risk</b> factor of lung cancer and especially for SCC and AC of Mongolian, China.

5|$|Evolutionary {{theory can}} argue against the {{selection}} of the deferred gratification trait since there are both costs and risks associated with delaying gratification behavior. One such cost is the basic opportunity cost associated with time spent waiting. While waiting, individuals lose time {{that could be used to}} find other food. Seeking high calorie food conveys a clear evolutionary advantage. There are also two risks associated with being patient. First, there is a risk that another animal might get to the food first, also known as an interruption risk. Second, there <b>is</b> <b>the</b> <b>risk</b> that the chance to get the reward will be cut short, perhaps by a predator, also known as a termination risk. These costs and risks create situations in which the fitness of the individual is threatened. There are several examples that show how reward delay occurs in the real world. For example, animals that eat fruit have the option of eating unripe fruit right away, or waiting, delaying gratification, until it becomes ripe. The interruption risk plays a part here, because if the individual forgoes the unripe fruit, there is a chance that another individual may come along and get to it first. Also, in extractive foraging, such as with nuts and shellfish, the outer shell creates a delay. However, animals that can store food and defer eating are more likely to survive during harsh conditions, and thus delaying gratification may also incur an evolutionary advantage.|$|E

25|$|The Type B2 cabinet (also {{known as}} a Total Exhaust BSC) is {{expensive}} to operate because no air is recirculated within. Therefore, this type is mainly found in such applications as toxicology laboratories, where the ability to safely use hazardous chemistry is important. Additionally, there <b>is</b> <b>the</b> <b>risk</b> that contaminated air would flow into the laboratory if the exhaust system for a Type B1 or B2 cabinet were to fail. To mitigate this risk, cabinets of these types generally monitor the exhaust flow, shutting off the supply blower and sounding an alarm if the exhaust flow is insufficient.|$|E

25|$|Winnicott {{thought that}} one of the {{developmental}} hurdles for an infant to get past <b>is</b> <b>the</b> <b>risk</b> of being traumatised by having to be too aware too soon of how small and helpless she really is. A baby who is too aware of real-world dangers will be too anxious to learn optimally. A good-enough parent is well enough attuned and responsive to protect the baby with an illusion of omnipotence, or being all-powerful. For example, a well-cared-for baby usually doesn't feel hungry for very long before being fed. Winnicott thought the parents' quick response of feeding the baby gives the baby a sense that whenever she's hungry, food appears as if by magic, as if the baby herself makes food appear just by being hungry. To feel this powerful, Winnicott thought, allowed a baby to feel confident, calm and curious, and able to learn without having to invest a lot of energy into defences.|$|E
25|$|A core skill within VC is {{the ability}} to {{identify}} novel or disruptive technologies that have the potential to generate high commercial returns at an early stage. By definition, VCs also take a role in managing entrepreneurial companies at an early stage, thus adding skills as well as capital, thereby differentiating VC from buy-out private equity, which typically invest in companies with proven revenue, and thereby potentially realizing much higher rates of returns. Inherent in realizing abnormally high rates of returns <b>is</b> <b>the</b> <b>risk</b> of losing all of one's investment in a given startup company. As a consequence, most venture capital investments are done in a pool format, where several investors combine their investments into one large fund that invests in many different startup companies. By investing in the pool format, the investors are spreading out their risk to many different investments instead of taking the chance of putting all of their money in one start up firm.|$|E
