25|$|However, the {{elimination}} of diluent gases substantially increases fire risks, especially in ground operations when for structural reasons the total cabin pressure must exceed the external atmospheric pressure; see Apollo 1. Furthermore, oxygen toxicity becomes a factor at high oxygen concentrations. For this reason, most modern crewed spacecraft use conventional air (nitrogen/oxygen) atmospheres and use pure oxygen only in pressure suits during extravehicular activity where acceptable suit flexibility mandates the lowest <b>inflation</b> <b>pressure</b> possible.|$|E
500|$|The {{bicycles}} are utility bicycles with a unisex step-through frame, which weigh about [...] each. Their one-piece {{aluminum frame}} and handlebars conceal cables and fasteners {{in an effort}} to protect them from vandalism and bad weather; the handlebars are located above the seat, allowing riders to sit upright and thereby maintain balance. They are equipped with a Shimano Nexus three-speed, twist-shifter-operated internal geared hub, full mudguards/fenders and chainguard. The heavy-duty tires are puncture-resistant and filled with nitrogen to maintain proper <b>inflation</b> <b>pressure</b> longer. The tires are also wider, leading to increased stability. Twin LED rear lights of a pre-2015 design are integrated into the frame, whose bright-blue color increases the bikes' visibility. The bikes are designed by industrial designer Michel Dallaire and built in the Saguenay, Quebec, region by Cycles Devinci, with aluminum provided by Rio Tinto Alcan. Citi Bikes are slower than most utility bicycles, averaging only [...] as opposed to regular bicycles' average speed of , which increases safety due to a lowered risk of a high-speed collision. The bikes are assembled in Detroit.|$|E

40|$|Maximum weight bearing observed, using {{a static}} {{weighing}} scale, in above-knee amputees wearing an airsplint, {{with a foot}}, was 10 kg and in below-knee amputees 11 kg with <b>inflation</b> <b>pressures</b> of 40 mmHg. While airsplints with a foot permitted greater weight bearing before deformation occurred, the increase is judged to be of little clinical advantage. Use of an airsplint without a foot would be'more efficient for immediate post-operative dressing and for early ambulation in the parallel bars as it is less cumbersome and not subject to toe drag in the swing phase of gait. With the type of airsplints studied <b>inflation</b> <b>pressures</b> above 45 mmHg offered no advantage in terms of weight bearing in the below-knee amputee.

2500|$|In May 2011, the IMF country report {{assessment}} of the economy of Kiribati is that “After two years of contraction, the economy recovered {{in the second half}} of 2010 and <b>inflation</b> <b>pressure</b> dissipated.

Tourist arrivals rebounded by 20% compared to 2009, although from a very low base. Despite the rise in world food and fuel prices, inflation has bounced from 2008 crisis-highs into negative territory, reflecting the strong appreciation of the Australian dollar, which is used as the domestic currency, and a decline in the world price of rice. Credit growth in the overall economy declined in 2009 as economic activity stalled. But it started to pick up {{in the second half of}} 2010 as the recovery gained traction.” ...|$|E

40|$|Introduction: To {{explore the}} {{hypothesis}} that early ventilation strategies influence clinical outcomes in lung transplantation, we have examined our routine ventilation practices in terms of tidal volumes (Vt) and <b>inflation</b> <b>pressures.</b> Methods: A total of 124 bilateral lung transplants between 2010 and 2013 were retrospectively assigned to low (b 6 mL/kg), medium (6 - 8 mL/kg), and high (N 8 mL/kg) Vt groups based on ventilation characteristics during the first 6 hours after surgery. Those same 124 patients were also stratified to low-pressure (b 25 cm H 2 O) and high-pressure (≥ 25 cm H 2 O) groups. Results: Eighty percent of patients were ventilated using pressure control mode. Low, medium, and high Vt were applied to 10 %, 43 %, and 47 % of patients, respectively. After correcting for patients requiring extracorporeal support, {{there was no difference}} in short-term to midterm outcomes among the different Vt groups. Low <b>inflation</b> <b>pressures</b> were applied to 61 % of patients, who had a shorter length of intensive care unit stay (5 vs 12 days; P =. 012), higher forced expiratory volume in 1 second at 3 months (77. 8 % vs 60. 3 %; P b. 001), and increased 6 -month survival rate (95 % vs 77 %; P =. 008). Conclusion: Low Vt ventilation has not been fully adopted in our practice. Ventilation with higher <b>inflation</b> <b>pressures,</b> but not Vt, was significantly associated with poorer outcomes after lung transplantation...|$|R
5000|$|The {{larger the}} <b>inflation</b> <b>pressure,</b> {{the smaller the}} contact patch.|$|E
5000|$|Unfortunately, {{these two}} {{properties}} are not linearly {{proportional to the}} area of the contact. For example, a 10% change in load or <b>inflation</b> <b>pressure</b> usually does not result in a 10% change in the contact patch area. because the load or pressure on a tire can be altered freely, and the contact patch area is limited by the tire geometry. Further, the size of the contact patch cannot be simply calculated as load divided by <b>inflation</b> <b>pressure,</b> and the average contact pressure a tire has with the road surface is not equal to the <b>inflation</b> <b>pressure.</b>|$|E
50|$|Cold <b>inflation</b> <b>pressure</b> is the <b>inflation</b> <b>pressure</b> {{of tires}} before {{the car is}} driven and the tires warmed up.

Drivers are encouraged {{to make sure their}} tires are adequately inflated, as suboptimal tire pressure can greatly reduce fuel economy, increase emissions, increased wear on the edges of the tire surface, and can lead to premature failure of the tire. Excessive pressure, on the other hand, may lead to impact-breaks, decrease braking performance, and cause uneven wear (i.e. greater wear on the center part of the tire surface).|$|E

In addition, the influence of parameter variations on transfer functions as a fault detection of suspension has been introduced. This approach has been used when detecting faults of vehicle tyres being under-inflated 35 % and also to detect other suspension faults in the future. 1...|$|R
