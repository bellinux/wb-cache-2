2500|$|William Shatner {{directed}} [...] and [...] {{the film}} introduced Spock's previously unmentioned half-brother, Sybok. Nimoy had issues with {{some parts of}} the early scripts, as they called for Spock to betray Kirk because Sybok helps him to understand his human side. It was changed at Nimoy's suggestion to the revelation that Spock had already {{come to terms with the}} human side of his nature, and Sybok had admiration for that. Production was delayed by several months as Nimoy was away directing The Good Mother. In response, Shatner threatened to shoot the film without Nimoy, but it was accepted to be an <b>empty</b> <b>threat.</b>|$|E
2500|$|At {{the height}} of the Four Eights Uprising against the BSPP, Ne Win {{resigned}} as party chairman on 23 July 1988. In a truculent farewell speech to the BSPP Party Congress, he warned that if the [...] "disturbances" [...] continued the [...] "army would have to be called and I would like to declare from here that if the army shoots it has no tradition of shooting into the air. It would shoot straight to hit." [...] The Tatmadaw troops shot, killed and maimed hundreds if not up to 3,000 or more demonstrators in various places throughout Burma from the period of 8 to 12 August 1988 and again on 18 September 1988, proving that Ne Win's farewell speech was not an <b>empty</b> <b>threat.</b>|$|E

He added 600 men to the police force and hired 2,400 special deputies, students from the University of Washington for the most part. On February 7, Mayor Hansen threatened to use 1,500 police and 1,500 troops to replace striking workers the next day, but the strikers assumed this was an <b>empty</b> <b>threat</b> and were proved correct. The Mayor continued his rhetorical attack on February 9, saying that the [...] "sympathetic strike was called in the exact manner as was the revolution in Petrograd."

2500|$|They {{added an}} <b>empty</b> <b>threat</b> that anyone {{found guilty of}} profiteering would be barred from {{taking part in the}} Gentlemen v Players match at Lord's. In fact, many leading amateurs were paid for playing and it is widely {{believed}} that the most famous amateur cricketer, W. G. Grace, made more money out of cricket than any genuine professional. In Charles Williams' view, the dictum was very subtly worded because it did not forbid amateurs from making money from cricket [...] "off the field of play". In fairness to Grace, he was a general practitioner who had to pay for a locum tenens to run his medical practice while he was playing cricket and he had a reputation for treating his poorer patients without charging a fee. C. B. Fry commented that Grace was the only man who became a doctor of medicine [...] "on account of successful operations on the cricket field".|$|E

60|$|And {{that this}} last was no <b>empty</b> <b>threat</b> is proved by the plain facts of their sacred history. For they DID forget God, and worshipped Baalim, the sun, moon, and stars; and ruin {{of every kind}} DID come upon them, till they were carried away captive to Babylon. And this we must think of when we read the book of Deuteronomy, and nothing else. If they wished to prosper, they were to know and {{consider}} in their hearts that Jehovah was God, and there was none else. Yes-- this was the continual thought which a true Jew was to have. The thought of a God who was HIS God; the God of his fathers before him, and the God of his children after him; the God of the whole nation of the Jews, throughout all their generations.|$|E

He had known from the first that Mr. Parker's concluding words were not an <b>empty</b> <b>threat.</b> His experience as a reporter {{had given him the}} knowledge that is only given in its entirety to police and newspaper men: that there are two New Yorks--one, a modern, well-policed city, through which one may walk from end to end without encountering adventure; the other, a city as full of sinister intrigue, of whisperings and conspiracies, of battle, murder, and sudden death in dark byways, as any town of mediaeval Italy. Given certain conditions, anything may happen in New York. And Smith realized that these conditions now prevailed in his own case. He had come into conflict with New York's underworld. Circumstances had placed him below the surface, where only his wits could help him.|$|E

5000|$|The {{earliest}} surviving {{version of}} the tale is {{in the first two}} and a half lines of a four-line Latin poem by Phaedrus. 'A mountain had gone into labour and was groaning terribly. Such rumours excited great expectations all over the country. In the end, however, the mountain gave birth to a mouse.' Phaedrus then {{goes on to say that}} this applies to those who make serious but <b>empty</b> <b>threats.</b> Walter of England and William Caxton were eventually to follow him in this, but that such an interpretation is too narrowly focused is suggested by the many other Classical allusions to what was clearly a popular proverb.|$|R

He had been of very little use to Edmund; his rash interference had only done harm, and added to his mother's distress; he had been nothing but a boy throughout, and instead of being a brave champion, he had been in such an agony of terror at an <b>empty</b> <b>threat,</b> that if the rebel captain had been in the room, he might almost, at one moment, have betrayed his brother. Poor Walter! how he felt what it was never to have learnt self-control! ...|$|E
60|$|At {{the first}} reading this letter {{filled him with}} anger. To be wooed by a very pretty woman is {{pleasant}} even to the most austere of married men (and never again trust the one who denies it), but to be wooed with a very dangerous threat mixed up with the wooing is no such pleasant experience. And it was no <b>empty</b> <b>threat.</b> Violet {{was a woman who}} prided herself upon being as good as her word. She had laughingly said with her accustomed frankness upon one occasion that it was her sole remaining virtue. If he did not go to Mariani's, she would certainly come to Woking. He shuddered to think of Maude being annoyed by her. It was one thing to speak in a general way to his wife of prematrimonial experiences, and it was another to have this woman forcing herself upon her and making a scene. The idea was so vulgar. The sweet, pure atmosphere of The Lindens {{would never be the same}} again.|$|E
60|$|We {{found that}} his parting words were no <b>empty</b> <b>threat.</b> Hardly had the crowd begun to {{assemble}} next night before he appeared once more upon the barrel {{and began to read}} with the same monotonous vigour, tripping over words! muddling up sentences, but still boring along through chapter after chapter. Laughter, threats, chaff--every weapon short of actual violence--was used to deter him, but all with the same want of success. Soon it was found that there was a method in his proceedings. When silence reigned, or when the conversation was of an innocent nature, the reading ceased. A single word of blasphemy, however, set it going again, and it would ramble on for {{a quarter of an hour}} or so, when it stopped, only to be renewed upon similar provocation. The reading was pretty continuous during that second night, for the language of the opposition was still considerably free. At least it was an improvement upon the night before.|$|E
50|$|The playful form of teasing is a {{parenting}} {{method used}} in some Indigenous American communities to keep children out of danger and guide their behavior. This form of teasing utilizes stories, fabrications, or <b>empty</b> <b>threats</b> to guide children in making safe, intelligent decisions. It can teach children values by establishing expectations and encouraging the child to meet them via playful jokes and/or idle threats. For example, a parent may tell a child {{that there is a}} monster that jumps on children's backs if they walk alone at night. This explanation can help keep the child safe because instilling that alarm creates greater awareness and lessens the likelihood that they will wander alone into trouble.|$|R

60|$|Peter, {{who never}} could endure the least {{opposition}} or contradiction {{to any of}} his ideas or plans, became quite angry with Mazeppa {{on account of the}} objections which he made to his proposals, and, as was usual with him in such cases, he broke out in the most rude and violent language imaginable. He called Mazeppa an enemy and a traitor, and threatened to have him impaled alive. It is true he did not really mean what he said, his words being only <b>empty</b> <b>threats</b> dictated by the brutal violence of his anger. Still, Mazeppa was very much offended.

60|$|Against him the {{governor}} of Havana sent out a great war vessel, and with it a negro executioner, so {{that there might be}} no inconvenient delays of law after the pirates had been captured. But l'Olonoise did not wait for the coming of the war vessel; he went out to meet it, and he found it where it lay riding at anchor in the mouth of the river Estra. At the dawn of the morning he made his attack--sharp, unexpected, decisive. In a little while the Spaniards were forced below the hatches, and the vessel was taken. Then came the end. One by one the poor shrieking wretches were dragged up from below, and one by one they were butchered in cold blood, while l'Olonoise stood upon the poop deck and looked coldly down upon what was being done. Among the rest the negro was dragged upon the deck. He begged and implored that his life might be spared, promising to tell all that might be asked of him. L'Olonoise questioned him, and when he had squeezed him dry, waved his hand coldly, and the poor black went with the rest. Only one man was spared; him he sent to {{the governor}} of Havana with a message that henceforth he would give no quarter to any Spaniard whom he might meet in arms--a message which was not an <b>empty</b> <b>threat.</b>|$|E
6000|$|Charlie knows {{very well}} {{that this is an}} <b>empty</b> <b>threat.</b> Still, the {{utterance}} of it, and the scolding that accompanies it, irritate him a little, and the only possible good effect that can be expected to result from it is to make him try, the next time he comes in, to see how small an abatement of the noise he usually makes will do, as a kind of make-believe obedience to his mother's command. He might, indeed, honestly answer his mother's angry question by saying that he does not know better than to make such a noise. He does not know why the noise of the door should be disagreeable to his mother. It is not disagreeable to him. On the contrary, it is agreeable. Children always like noise, especially if they make it themselves. And although Charlie has often been told that he must not make any noise, the reason for this--namely, that though noise is a source of pleasure, generally, to children, especially when they make it themselves, it is almost always a source of annoyance and pain to grown persons--has never really entered his mind so as to be actually comprehended us a practical reality. His ideas in respect to the philosophy of the transaction are, of course, exceedingly vague; but so far as he forms any idea, it is that his mother's words are the expression of some mysterious but unreasonable sensitiveness on her part, which awakens in her a spirit of fault-finding and ill-humor that vents itself upon him in blaming him for nothing at all; or, as he would express it more tersely, if not so elegantly, that she is [...] "very cross." [...] In other words, the impression made by the transaction upon his moral sense is that of wrong-doing on his mother's part, and not at all on his own.|$|E
6000|$|All was mirth till Sunday, {{when the}} Queen's French priest celebrated Mass {{in her own}} chapel before herself, her three uncles, and Montrose.

Arran alone made a protest, probably written by Knox. Who but Knox could have written that the Mass is [...] "much more abominable and odious in the sight of God" [...] than murder! Many an honest brother was conspicuously of the opinion which Arran's protest assigned to Omnipotence. Next Sunday Knox [...] "thundered," [...] and later regretted that [...] "I did not that I might have done" [...] (caused an armed struggle?), [...] "for God had given unto me credit with many, who would have put into execution God's judgments if I would only have consented thereto."

In fact, he rather worked [...] "to slokin that fervency." [...] {195} Let us hope that he is forgiven, especially as Randolph reports him extremely vehement in the pulpit. His repentance was publicly expressed shortly before the murder of Riccio. (In December 1565, probably, when the Kirk ordered the week's fast that, as it chanced, heralded Riccio's doom.) Privately to Cecil, on October 7, 1561, he uttered his regret that he had been so deficient in zeal. Cecil had been recommending moderation. {196} ...|$|E
