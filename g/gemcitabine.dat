5|$|In {{cases where}} surgery is not indicated, palliative {{chemotherapy}} is an option; higher-dose chemotherapy {{is associated with}} longer survival. Palliative chemotherapy, particularly using capecitabine and <b>gemcitabine,</b> is also often used to treat recurrent endometrial cancer.|$|E
5|$|The {{chemotherapy}} regimen {{depends on}} the tumor type. Small-cell lung carcinoma (SCLC), even relatively early stage disease, is treated primarily with chemotherapy and radiation. In SCLC, cisplatin and etoposide are most commonly used. Combinations with carboplatin, <b>gemcitabine,</b> paclitaxel, vinorelbine, topotecan, and irinotecan are also used. In advanced non-small cell lung carcinoma (NSCLC), chemotherapy improves survival and is used as first-line treatment, provided the person is well enough for the treatment. Typically, two drugs are used, of which one is often platinum-based (either cisplatin or carboplatin). Other commonly used drugs are <b>gemcitabine,</b> paclitaxel, docetaxel, pemetrexed, etoposide or vinorelbine.|$|E
5|$|The {{majority}} of cases of cholangiocarcinoma present as inoperable (unresectable) disease in which case patients are generally treated with palliative chemotherapy, with or without radiotherapy. Chemotherapy {{has been shown in}} a randomized controlled trial to improve quality of life and extend survival in patients with inoperable cholangiocarcinoma. There is no single chemotherapy regimen which is universally used, and enrollment in clinical trials is often recommended when possible. Chemotherapy agents used to treat cholangiocarcinoma include 5-fluorouracil with leucovorin, <b>gemcitabine</b> as a single agent, or <b>gemcitabine</b> plus cisplatin, irinotecan, or capecitabine. A small pilot study suggested possible benefit from the tyrosine kinase inhibitor erlotinib in patients with advanced cholangiocarcinoma.|$|E
25|$|In November 2005, the FDA {{approved}} erlotinib {{in combination}} with <b>gemcitabine</b> for treatment of locally advanced, unresectable, or metastatic pancreatic cancer.|$|E
25|$|If {{the tumor}} is {{determined}} to be platinum-resistant, vincristine, dactinomycin, and cyclophosphamide (VAC) {{or some combination of}} paclitaxel, <b>gemcitabine,</b> and oxaliplatin may be used as a second-line therapy.|$|E
25|$|Anti-TNF {{therapy has}} shown only modest effects in cancer therapy. Treatment of renal cell {{carcinoma}} with infliximab resulted in prolonged disease stabilization in certain patients. Etanercept was tested for treating patients with breast cancer and ovarian cancer showing prolonged disease stabilization in certain patients via downregulation of IL-6 and CCL2. On the other hand, adding infliximab or etanercept to <b>gemcitabine</b> for treating patients with advanced pancreatic cancer {{was not associated with}} differences in efficacy when compared with placebo.|$|E
25|$|For platinum-sensitive tumors, platins are {{the drugs}} {{of choice for}} second-line chemotherapy, in {{combination}} with other cytotoxic agents. Regimens include carboplatin combined with pegylated liposomal doxorubicin, <b>gemcitabine,</b> or paclitaxel. Carboplatin-doublet therapy can be combined with paclitaxel for increased efficacy in some cases. Another potential adjuvant therapy for platinum-sensitive recurrences is olaparib, which may improve progression-free survival but has not been shown to improve overall survival. (Olaparib, a PARP inhibitor, was approved by the US FDA for use in BRCA-associated ovarian cancer that had previously been treated with chemotherapy.) For recurrent germ cell tumors, an additional 4 cycles of BEP chemotherapy is the first-line treatment for those tho have been treated with surgery or platins.|$|E
25|$|The anti-folates include {{methotrexate}} and pemetrexed. Methotrexate inhibits {{dihydrofolate reductase}} (DHFR), an enzyme that regenerates tetrahydrofolate from dihydrofolate. When the enzyme is inhibited by methotrexate, the cellular levels of folate coenzymes diminish. These {{are required for}} thymidylate and purine production, which are both essential for DNA synthesis and cell division. Pemetrexed is another anti-metabolite that affects purine and pyrimidine production, and therefore also inhibits DNA synthesis. It primarily inhibits the enzyme thymidylate synthase, but also has effects on DHFR, aminoimidazole carboxamide ribonucleotide formyltransferase and glycinamide ribonucleotide formyltransferase. The fluoropyrimidines include fluorouracil and capecitabine. Fluorouracil is a nucleobase analogue that is metabolised in cells to form at least two active products; 5-fluourouridine monophosphate (FUMP) and 5-fluoro-2'-deoxyuridine 5'-phosphate (fdUMP). FUMP becomes incorporated into RNA and fdUMP inhibits the enzyme thymidylate synthase; both of which lead to cell death. Capecitabine is a prodrug of 5-fluorouracil that is broken down in cells to produce the active drug. The deoxynucleoside analogues include cytarabine, <b>gemcitabine,</b> decitabine, azacitidine, fludarabine, nelarabine, cladribine, clofarabine, and pentostatin. The thiopurines include thioguanine and mercaptopurine.|$|E
25|$|Chemotherapy in {{ovarian cancer}} {{typically}} consists of platins, {{a group of}} platinum-based drugs, combined with non-platins. Common therapies can include paclitaxel, cisplatin, topotecan, doxorubicin, epirubicin, and <b>gemcitabine.</b> Carboplatin is typically given in combination with either paclitaxel or docetaxel; the typical combination is carboplatin with paclitaxel. Carboplatin is superior to cisplatin {{in that it is}} less toxic and has fewer side effects, generally allowing for an improved quality of life in comparison, though both are similarly effective. Three-drug regimens have not been found to be more effective, and platins alone or nonplatins alone are less effective than platins and nonplatins in combination. Chemotherapy can be given intravenously or in the peritoneal cavity. Though intraperitoneal chemotherapy is associated with longer progression-free survival and overall survival, it also causes more adverse side effects than intravenous chemotherapy. It is mainly used when the cancer has been optimally debulked. Intraperitoneal chemotherapy can be highly effective because ovarian cancer mainly spreads inside the peritoneal cavity, and higher doses of the drugs can reach the tumors this way.|$|E
500|$|The FOLFIRINOX {{chemotherapy}} regimen using four drugs {{was found}} {{more effective than}} <b>gemcitabine,</b> but with substantial side effects, and is thus only suitable for people with good performance status. [...] This is also true of protein-bound paclitaxel (nab-paclitaxel), which was licensed by the FDA in 2013 for use with <b>gemcitabine</b> in pancreas cancer. By the end of 2013, both FOLFIRINOX and nab-paclitaxel with <b>gemcitabine</b> were regarded as good choices for those able to tolerate the side-effects, and <b>gemcitabine</b> remained an effective option {{for those who were}} not. [...] A head-to-head trial between the two new options is awaited, and trials investigating other variations continue. [...] However, the changes of the last few years have only increased survival times by a few months. [...] Clinical trials are often conducted for novel adjuvant therapies.|$|E
500|$|<b>Gemcitabine</b> was {{approved}} by the United States Food and Drug Administration (FDA) in 1997, after a clinical trial reported improvements in quality of life and a 5-week improvement in median survival duration in people with advanced pancreatic cancer. This was the first chemotherapy drug approved by the FDA primarily for a nonsurvival clinical trial endpoint. [...] Chemotherapy using <b>gemcitabine</b> alone was the standard for about a decade, as a number of trials testing it in combination with other drugs failed to demonstrate significantly better outcomes. However, the combination of <b>gemcitabine</b> with erlotinib was found to increase survival modestly, and erlotinib was licensed by the FDA for use in pancreatic cancer in 2005.|$|E
500|$|After surgery, {{adjuvant}} chemotherapy with <b>gemcitabine</b> or 5-FU can {{be offered}} {{if the person}} is sufficiently fit, after a recovery period of one to two months. [...] In people not suitable for curative surgery, chemotherapy may be used to extend life or improve its quality. Before surgery, neoadjuvant chemotherapy or chemoradiotherapy [...] may be used in cases that are considered to be [...] "borderline resectable" [...] (see Staging) {{in order to reduce the}} cancer to a level where surgery could be beneficial. In other cases neoadjuvant therapy remains controversial, because it delays surgery.|$|E
2500|$|For platinum-resistant tumors, {{there are}} no high-efficacy {{chemotherapy}} options. Single-drug regimens (doxorubicin or topotecan) do not have high response rates, but single-drug regimens of topotecan, pegylated liposomal doxorubicin, or <b>gemcitabine</b> are used in some cases. Topotecan cannot be used in people with an intestinal blockage. Paclitaxel used alone is another possible regimen, {{or it may be}} combined with liposomal doxorubicin, <b>gemcitabine,</b> cisplatin, topotecan, etoposide, or cyclophosphamide. ( [...] See also Palliative care below.) ...|$|E
5000|$|Both, evofosfamide and [...] protein-bound {{paclitaxel}} (nab-paclitaxel) {{have been}} investigated in combination with <b>gemcitabine</b> in patients with metastatic pancreatic cancer. The study TH-CR-404 compares <b>gemcitabine</b> with <b>gemcitabine</b> plus evofosfamide. The study CA046 compares <b>gemcitabine</b> with <b>gemcitabine</b> plus nab-paclitaxel. <b>Gemcitabine</b> is a generic product sold by many manufacturers.|$|E
5000|$|<b>Gemcitabine</b> is {{hydrophilic}} {{and must}} be transported into cells via molecular transporters for nucleosides (the most common transporters for <b>gemcitabine</b> are SLC29A1 SLC28A1, and SLC28A3). After entering the cell, <b>gemcitabine</b> is first modified by attaching a phosphate to it, and so it becomes <b>gemcitabine</b> monophosphate (dFdCMP). [...] This is the rate-determining step that is catalyzed by the enzyme deoxycytidine kinase (DCK). [...] Two more phosphates are added by other enzymes. After the attachment of the three phosphates <b>gemcitabine</b> is finally pharmacologically active as <b>gemcitabine</b> triphosphate (dFdCTP).|$|E
50|$|A Phase II {{clinical}} trial showed good response in combination chemotherapy with <b>gemcitabine</b> for advanced pancreatic cancer. However, Pfizer reported on January 30, 2009 that Phase III {{clinical trial}}s of the drug when used in combination with <b>gemcitabine</b> showed no evidence of improved survival rates over treatments using <b>gemcitabine</b> alone for advanced pancreatic cancer and halted the trial.|$|E
50|$|Increased {{expression}} of RRM2B has been correlated with <b>gemcitabine</b> resistance in human cholangiocarcinoma cells {{and may be}} predictive of lack of clinical benefit from <b>gemcitabine</b> for human cancers.|$|E
50|$|During {{the early}} 1990s <b>gemcitabine</b> was studied in {{clinical}} trials. The pancreatic cancer trials found that <b>gemcitabine</b> increased one-year survival time significantly, {{and it was}} approved in the UK in 1995 {{and approved by the}} FDA in 1996 for pancreatic cancers. In 1998, <b>gemcitabine</b> received FDA approval for treating non-small cell lung cancer and in 2004, it was approved from metastatic breast cancer.|$|E
50|$|Taking <b>gemcitabine</b> {{can also}} affect {{fertility}} {{in men and}} women, sex life, and menstruation. Women taking <b>gemcitabine</b> should not become pregnant, and pregnant and breastfeeding women should not take it.|$|E
50|$|For example, <b>gemcitabine</b> is a FDA-approved {{pyrimidine}} nucleoside analogue and a dCK activity based prodrug {{that has been}} used to treat pancreatic, breast, bladder and non-small cell lung cancer. Mechanistically, dCK, which uptakes preformed nucleosides, adds the first phosphoryl group on dFdC (gemcitabine's original form as a deoxycytidine analog) to convert it into dFdCMP, its monophosphate form. Cytidylate kinase or UMP-CMP kinase then adds the second phosphoryl group to form dFdCDP (<b>gemcitabine</b> diphosphate form), which can inhibit ribonucleotide reductase. Nucleoside-diphosphate kinase or nucleoside kinase A adds the third phosphoryl group to form dFdCTP (<b>gemcitabine</b> triphosphate form) which is gemcitabine's active form which inhibits both deoxycytidylate deaminase and DNA polymerase. Although <b>gemcitabine</b> has widely used to treat solid tumors for over a decade, patients taking <b>gemcitabine</b> alone (monotherapy) have been observed to develop chemoresistance to the drug.|$|E
50|$|When <b>gemcitabine</b> is {{incorporated}} into DNA it allows a native, or normal, nucleoside base {{to be added}} next to it. This leads to “masked chain termination” as <b>gemcitabine</b> is a “faulty” base, but due to its neighboring native nucleoside it eludes the cell's normal repair system (base-excision repair). Thus, incorporation of <b>gemcitabine</b> into the cell's DNA creates an irreparable error that leads to inhibition of further DNA synthesis, and thereby leading to cell death.|$|E

50|$|<b>Gemcitabine</b> is a {{chemotherapy}} {{drug that}} works by killing any {{cells that are}} dividing. Cancer cells divide rapidly and so are targeted at higher rates by <b>gemcitabine,</b> but many essential cells divide rapidly as well, including cells in skin, the scalp, {{the lining of the}} stomach, and bone marrow, resulting in adverse effects.|$|E
50|$|In the Phase 3 MAESTRO study, {{patients}} with previously untreated, locally advanced unresectable or metastatic pancreatic adenocarcinoma treated with evofosfamide {{in combination with}} <b>gemcitabine</b> did not demonstrate a statistically significant improvement in overall survival (OS) compared with <b>gemcitabine</b> plus placebo (hazard ratio HR: 0.84; 95% confidence interval CI: 0.71 - 1.01; p=0.0589).|$|E
50|$|The form of <b>gemcitabine</b> {{with two}} {{phosphates}} attached (dFdCDP) also has activity; it inhibits the enzyme ribonucleotide reductase (RNR), which {{is needed to}} create new nucleotides. The lack of nucleotides drives the cell to uptake more of the components it needs to make nucleotides from outside the cell, which increases uptake of <b>gemcitabine</b> as well.|$|E

5000|$|Research into {{pharmacogenomics}} and pharmacogenetics {{has been}} ongoing. As of 2014, {{it was not}} clear whether or not genetic tests could be useful in guiding dosing and which people respond best to <b>gemcitabine.</b> [...] However, it appears that variation in the expression of proteins (SLC29A1, SLC29A2, SLC28A1, and SLC28A3) used for transport of <b>gemcitabine</b> into the cell lead to variations in its potency. Similarly, the genes that express proteins that lead to its inactivation (deoxycytidine deaminase, cytidine deaminase, and NT5C) and that express its other intracellular targets (RRM1, RRM2, and RRM2B) lead to variations in response to the drug.
