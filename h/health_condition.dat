PURPOSE: This dissertation examined whether children and adolescents with chronic <b>health</b> <b>conditions</b> {{were more likely to}} have poor educational attainment compared to youth without chronic <b>health</b> <b>conditions.</b> It examined the impact of type and onset of chronic <b>health</b> <b>conditions</b> as well as youth limited by chronic <b>health</b> <b>conditions</b> on educational attainment. The potential influences of mediating and moderating factors were also investigated.

Methods: To depict <b>health</b> <b>conditions</b> in the EU regions, two classification methods are used: (i) hierarchical clustering with Ward’s method and squared Euclidean distance and (ii) k-mean clustering. To illustrate the intra-country variability of <b>health</b> <b>conditions,</b> the coefficients of variation are computed. Results: <b>Health</b> <b>conditions</b> are considerably better in the western regions of the EU. Objective and subjective health measures mostly do not always coincide.

The aim {{of this study was to}} identify the most common problems in functioning across the wide range of <b>health</b> <b>conditions</b> using the International Classification of Functioning (ICF). Existing databases created for the 21 ICF Core Sets studies were descriptively analyzed. These included data collected in 44 countries on 9978 patients with one of 21 <b>health</b> <b>conditions</b> as the main diagnosis. A frequency cutoff of 50 % was used to identify the most common problems in functioning when looking at single <b>health</b> <b>conditions</b> and across them.

40|$|The thesis {{consists}} of three chapters that study the interplay between skills and health in shaping labour market outcomes. I focus on two distinct but related issues: i) the wage losses among older workers due to work-limiting <b>health</b> <b>conditions,</b> and ii) the long lasting effects of childhood <b>health</b> <b>conditions</b> on human capital formation. Chapter two studies how <b>health</b> <b>conditions</b> among older workers affect their wages depending {{on the characteristics of}} their occupations. The U. S. Social Security Act defines disability as the inability due to <b>health</b> <b>conditions</b> to perform physically or mentally demanding tasks. To examine the potentially task-specific nature of work-limiting <b>health</b> <b>conditions,</b> I estimate a wage equation that allows <b>health</b> <b>conditions</b> to have heterogeneous wage returns depending on what kinds of tasks the workers conduct within their occupations. The estimation results, based on a panel dataset of older workers in the U. S., indicate that the magnitude of health-induced wage losses differs substantially across occupations depending on their task characteristics, contrary to the commonly used assumption that health is uniformly valued across occupations. I also show that about 60 % of the health-related wage gaps {{can be explained by the}} correlations between health and skills. This chapter further demonstrates that work-limiting <b>health</b> <b>conditions</b> are correlated with the time-varying components of multiple skills. This suggests that econometric models with single-dimensional, time-invariant unobserved heterogeneity may not be fully successful in isolating the influences of the correlations between health and skills. The third chapter investigates the link between childhood <b>health</b> <b>conditions</b> and skill formation. While existing evidence suggests that certain childhood <b>health</b> <b>conditions</b> affect schooling outcomes, little is known as to whether and how such influences persist into labour market skills beyond academic outcomes. By adopting a multidimensional skills/tasks approach, this chapter provides a set of new evidence regarding how childhood <b>health</b> <b>conditions</b> affect skills used in the labour market. To obtain objective measures of childhood <b>health</b> <b>conditions,</b> I exploit medical examinations conducted in the 1958 British National Child Development Study (NCDS). The results point to the importance of childhood <b>health</b> <b>conditions</b> in determining what kinds of occupations individuals pursue in the labour market. In particular, I find that those who had mental <b>health</b> <b>conditions</b> before age 16 tend to select into less cognitive skill demanding jobs while those who had physical <b>health</b> <b>conditions</b> sort into less manual skill demanding jobs. The observed variation in job selections are found as important predictors of the health-related earnings gaps. An important question is whether poor health during childhood influences later outcomes by restricting skill formation, or by mainly affecting future health. To further examine the sources of the earnings gaps associated with childhood <b>health</b> <b>conditions,</b> the fourth chapter develops and estimates a lifecycle model where childhood <b>health</b> <b>conditions</b> can affect formation of skills and health over the life course. The estimated model is used to quantify the relative importance of the multiple channels through which childhood <b>health</b> <b>conditions</b> may affect labour earnings. The results indicate that the most important channel accounting for mental health-related earnings gaps is the skill channel. About 60 - 65 % of the earnings gaps can be explained by the effects of childhood <b>health</b> <b>conditions</b> on skill formation. The effects of childhood health status on health formation are also found to play important roles...|$|R

Blue feet also indicate the current <b>health</b> <b>condition</b> of a booby.

40|$|OBJECTIVES: To {{describe}} {{the prevalence of}} secondary <b>health</b> <b>conditions</b> among persons with long-term spinal cord injury, {{and the relationship between}} these secondary <b>health</b> <b>conditions</b> and quality of life. DESIGN: Multicentre, cross-sectional study. SUBJECTS: Individuals (n[*]=[*] 282) with traumatic or non-traumatic spinal cord injury for ≥[*] 10 years, age at injury 18 - 35 years, current age 28 - 65 years, and using a wheelchair. METHODS: Occurrence of 13 secondary <b>health</b> <b>conditions</b> was assessed during a consultation with a rehabilitation physician. Quality of life was measured with the International Spinal Cord Injury Quality of Life Basic Data Set. RESULTS: Median time since injury was 22. 0 years. Median number of secondary <b>health</b> <b>conditions</b> was 4. The most prevalent secondary <b>health</b> <b>conditions</b> were: musculoskeletal pain (63. 5 %), oedema (38. 7 %), neuropathic pain (34. 1 %) and urinary tract infections (33. 3 %). Only oedema showed a significant association with increasing time since injury. Median Total Quality of Life Basic Data Set score was 7.
