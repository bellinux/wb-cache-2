40|$|A <b>Dispersion</b> <b>Index</b> for the {{measurement}} of geographical inequality {{in the distribution of}} health status indicators across space and time is proposed. The <b>Dispersion</b> <b>Index</b> is computed independently of the mean and is robust to changes in distributional shape over time. Therefore, the <b>Dispersion</b> <b>Index</b> is shown to possess more desirable statistical properties as compared to the coefficient of variation for assessing trends in the geographical distribution of health status indicators. Application of the <b>Dispersion</b> <b>Index</b> to the 1994 under-five mortality data from the Middle East/North African region shows that regional inequality in the distribution of under-five mortality was reduced by 47 % as compared to 1980. Curve-fitting illustrated that the trend in the <b>Dispersion</b> <b>Index</b> values was non-monotonic from 1980 through 1994. We suggest that apart from the World Summit for Children's under-five mortality target for the year 2000, intraregional targets to reduce geographical inequalities in under-five mortality should be specified. We also suggest that changes in the magnitude of the <b>Dispersion</b> <b>Index</b> be used for the assessment of progress made by a region or nation in achieving the specified numerical targets.

40|$|This paper {{investigates the}} time series {{behaviour}} {{of the relative}} benefits of sector and regional diversification strategies, using the notion of cross-sectional dispersion introduced by Solnik and Roulet (2000). Using monthly data over the period 1987 : 1 to 2002 : 12, four sector and four regional classifications are examined in the UK. The results indicate that sector and regional <b>dispersion</b> <b>indices</b> are highly time varying and so dwarf any lower frequency cyclical components that may be present. Nonetheless, periods of high dispersion are closely followed by periods of low dispersion, suggestive of cyclical behaviour of sector and regional diversification benefits. Then, using the HP-filter we isolated the cyclical component of the various <b>dispersion</b> <b>indices</b> {{and found that the}} sector <b>dispersion</b> <b>indices</b> are generally above the regional <b>dispersion</b> <b>indices.</b> This implies that a sector diversification strategy is likely to offer greater risk reduction benefits than a regional diversification approach. Nonetheless, we find that in some periods, certain regional diversification strategies are of equal or greater benefit than certain sector approaches. The results also appear to be quite sensitive to the classifications of sectors and regions. Hence, the appropriate definition of sectors and regions can have important implications for sector and regional diversification strategies...|$|R

Better results in terms of PSC selection can be achieved using two strategies, namely, coherence and <b>dispersion</b> <b>index</b> (see Eq.  4).

40|$|This {{study was}} {{designed}} to explore two possible causes of and solutions to poor dispersion prediction model performance in polytomous items. First, the impact of the correlation between the ‘level’ (e. g., the average score of the distribution) and the ‘strength’ (the dispersion among the data points in a distribution) on the dispersion effect was explored. Second, the extent to which non-linearity and heteroscedasticity influenced the dispersion effect was also explored. In order to explore these two factors, Monte Carlo studies were performed in which the <b>dispersion</b> <b>index,</b> the number of aggregated observations, the number of nested data points, the number of items from which the <b>dispersion</b> <b>index</b> was derived, the shape of the distribution, and the ‘level’ covariate in the multiple regression model were varied. The studies used a 5 point response polytomous item context. The evaluation criteria included power/Type I error rates, model R 2, sr 2 for the <b>dispersion</b> <b>index,</b> the VIF of the <b>dispersion</b> <b>index,</b> linearity of the <b>dispersion</b> <b>index,</b> and homoscedasticity of the errors in the dispersion prediction model. The results suggest that none of the dispersion indexes systematically violate the multiple regression assumptions of linearity or homoscedasticity. They also suggest that the choice of the <b>dispersion</b> <b>index,</b> the number of items used, and the central tendency covariate used in the dispersion prediction model are the prominent determinants of good performance in a 5 point response scale polytomous item context. The sample standard deviation (SD) and average deviation indexes (ADm and ADmd) performed equally well and substantially better than the MAD, CV, and awg in terms of the evaluation criteria across the conditions of the study. The performance of the SD, ADm, and ADmd improved substantially when computed from 5 different polytomous items as opposed to a single polytomous item. Finally, the results suggest that in skewed distributions the performance of the SD, ADm, and ADmd decreases due to an increased correlation with the level covariate. This decrease in performance can be counteracted in skewed distribution by controlling for the median as the level covariate as opposed to the mean...|$|E

40|$|The widths, <b>dispersion</b> measures, <b>dispersion</b> <b>indices</b> and fluences of Fast Radio Bursts (FRB) impose coupled {{constraints}} that all models must satisfy. Observation of <b>dispersion</b> <b>indices</b> {{close to their}} low density limit of - 2 sets a model-independent upper bound on the electron density and a lower bound {{on the size of}} any dispersive plasma cloud. The non-monotonic dependence of burst widths (after deconvolution of instrumental effects) on dispersion measure excludes the intergalactic medium as the location of scattering that broadens the FRB in time. Temporal broadening far greater than that of pulsars at similar high Galactic latitudes implies that scattering occurs close to the sources, where high densities and strong turbulence are plausible. FRB energetics are consistent with supergiant pulses from young, fast, high-field pulsars at cosmological distances. The distribution of FRB dispersion measures is inconsistent with expanding clouds (such as SNR). It excludes space-limited distributions (such as the local supercluster), but agrees with a homogeneous cosmological distribution with intergalactic dispersion. The FRB N [...] S relation also indicates a cosmological distribution, aside from the anomalously bright Lorimer burst. Comment: 21 pp, 4 fig...|$|R

In order to achieve timely control of product quality, a technique capable of providing real-time information on filler dispersion is highly desirable. In this work, ultrasound, temperature, and pressure sensors as well as an amperemeter of the extruder motor drive were used to monitor the extrusion of mineral-filled polymers under various experimental conditions in terms of filler type, filler concentration, feeding rate, screw rotation speed, and barrel temperature. Then, neural network relationships were established among the filler <b>dispersion</b> <b>index</b> and three categories of variables, namely, control variables of the extruder, extruder-dependent measured variables, and extruder-independent measured variables (based on ultrasonic measurement). Of the three categories of variables, the process control variables and extruder-independent ultrasonically measured variables performed best in inferring the <b>dispersion</b> <b>index</b> through a neural network model.

In this paper, we propose a technique for comparing probability distributions {{from the point of}} view of their relative dispersion without resorting to a numerical index.

There is also a close connection between this ordering on probability distributions and the standard specificity ordering on possibility distributions that can be derived by means of a known probability–possibility transformation. The paper proposes a direct proof showing that the (total) preordering on probability measures defined by probabilistic entropy refines the (partial) ordering defined by possibilistic specificity.

Previous {{studies have indicated that}} by obtaining the NII of each industry, which are caused by any kind of monetary or financial policy, it is possible to link the I–O table and NII from the FOF accounts. In this study, we will adopt the I–O analysis method, which is applied to the FOF accounts devised by Tsujimura and Mizoshita (2002 a, b). Applying the I–O analysis method to the ALM derived from the FOF accounts, Y and Y* matrices (ALM of institutional sector-by-institutional sector) are obtained. Using the Leontief inverse matrix, four kinds of indices (power of <b>dispersion</b> <b>index</b> in the liability-oriented system, power of <b>dispersion</b> <b>index</b> in the asset-oriented system, sensitivity of <b>dispersion</b> <b>index</b> in the liability-oriented system, and sensitivity of <b>dispersion</b> <b>index</b> in the asset-oriented system) are estimated. Furthermore, by employing ALM, it is possible {{to evaluate the effectiveness of}} a monetary policy by applying the Leontief inverse. In summary, if the expanded FOF accounts, which are separated into various inter-industries, are obtained, (1) a financial transaction table of each inter-industry by inter-industry, which are deeply related to the I–O table, is created; (2) the power index and sensitivity index of each industry are computed; and (3) an analysis method connected to the I–O table and the FOF accounts can be applicable. To subdivide the nonfinancial corporation sector of the FOF accounts into different types of industries, we adopt the Financial Statement Analysis (FSA) data compiled by the Bank of Korea (BOK). Since the FSA data announce annual balance sheets and income statements for each industry, it is possible to create expanded FOF accounts whose institutional sectors are divided into about 100 types of industry. This study aims to (1) analyze various inter-industries from the viewpoint of the FOF accounts, (2) examine policy evaluation methods and suggest monetary market operations, and (3) derive a new analysis tool to link the I–O table and FOF accounts for future works.|$|E

The present study is aimed at comparing the values of four <b>dispersion</b> <b>indices</b> in four clinical groups: normal subjects (n = 23), patients with intraventricular conduction defects (QRS > 0. 12 s) without underlying cardiac disease (n = 30), patients with dilated cardiomyopathy (n = 36), and patients with both dilated cardiomyopathy and ventricular conduction defects (n = 18). METHODS: On an averaged cycle from a 10 s record of 15 simultaneous leads (12 -lead ECG and XYZ leads), and after interactive editing, four intervals were computed: JTapex, JTend, QTapex and QTend. For each interval, the dispersion is defined as the difference between the maximal and minimal values across the 15 leads. RESULTS: The mean values of all four <b>dispersion</b> <b>indices</b> were significantly smaller in the normal group than in the three other groups (P < 0. 001). Among patients with dilated cardiomyopathy, those with intraventricular conduction defects had significantly higher dispersion values than those without, even disregarding the QRS duration (P < 0. 01). Thus, patients with both dilated cardiomyopathy and ventricular conduction defects have larger dispersion values than patients with ventricular conduction defects alone (P < 0. 01) and than those with dilated cardiomyopathy without intraventricular conduction defects. CONCLUSION: Dispersion of ventricular repolarization is increased in patients with dilated cardiomyopathy, especially in those with ventricular conduction defects, suggesting that they are at higher risk of arrhythmic events...|$|R

This problem is resolved if the radiation scattered close to its source, where high densities are possible. Observation of <b>dispersion</b> <b>indices</b> close to their low density limit of - 2 sets a model-independent upper bound on the electron density and a lower bound {{on the size of}} the dispersive plasma cloud, excluding terrestrial or Solar System origin. The scattering and much of the dispersion measures may be attributed to scattering regions about 1 AU from the sources, with electron densities ∼ 3 × 10 ^ 8 /cm^ 3. The inferred parameters are only marginally consistent; re-examination of the assumed relation between dispersion measure and distance is warranted. Origin in an ionized starburst or protogalaxy is suggested, but statistical arguments exclude compact young SNR in the Galactic neighborhood.
