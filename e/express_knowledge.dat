25|$|Multimodality in {{classrooms}} {{has brought about}} the need for a new definition of literacy. According to Gunther Kress, a popular theorist of multimodality, literacy, when defined, usually refers to the combination of letters and words to make messages and meaning and can often be attached to other words in order to <b>express</b> <b>knowledge</b> of the separate fields, such as visual- or computer-literacy. However, as multimodality becomes more common, not only {{in classrooms}}, but in work and social environments, the definition of literacy extends. Instead of referring only to reading and alphabetic writing, or being extended to other fields, literacy and its definition now encompass multiple modes. It has become more than just reading and writing, and now includes visual, technological, and social uses among others.|$|E

This includes also the knowledge and requirements that are available about the supertypes of that concepts, because such knowledge and requirements are inherited by the subtype of those supertype concepts, conforming to the subtype-supertype hierarchy (the taxonomy).|$|E
