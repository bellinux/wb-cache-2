There is also a shift in audit fees charged to other same-industry clients when a major client loss (gain) results in an audit office losing (gaining) city-level industry leadership. A major client loss or gain also creates a short-term capacity shock to an audit office’s ability to supply high-quality audits.

40|$|The {{purpose of}} this {{dissertation}} {{is to examine the}} role auditor reputation plays in the demand and supply of audits and to examine the process by which an auditor builds a reputation for audit quality. The goal is to begin to develop a comprehensive theory of the demand for auditing and the incentives this demand creates for the supply of audits. Scott (1984) cites a lack of theory capturing the precise nature of the auditor's contribution to a production and exchange economy. This paper uses an experimental economy and related model to examine the role of an auditor's reputation for delivering high quality audits in such a multiple period economy. A theory of the demand and supply of audits is necessary to help assess the need for regulation of the audit market. The need for regulation in existing audit markets has been questioned by some members of the auditing profession (Arthur Andersen, et. al. 1992). In response, experimental economic markets (EEM) research has examined different regulatory regimes (Dopuch and King 1992, Dopuch et. al., 1994). However, this research has not examined whether reputation can serve as a substitute for regulation in motivating the supply of high quality audits. Existing EEM research has provided some <b>evidence</b> <b>of</b> <b>reputation</b> effects in general (DeJong, et. al., 1985, Dopuch and King 1991) but has produced limited evidence of auditor reputation. Unlike prior EEM research, this paper explicitly examines auditor reputation. Three different experimental treatments were used to test the derived model: one treatment with robot investors and two treatments with human investors. The robot investor replications produced strong support for an auditor reputation model. Two of six human investor replications supported an auditor reputation model while the other four collapsed into markets for lemons. The markets suggest that the managers' demand for audit quality drove the level of audit quality supplied by auditors. When the managers did not demand and auditors did not supply high quality audits, the markets collapsed...|$|E

The high profile nature of the site means that the RG score {{may be used for}} recruitment, promotion and other tasks for which researchers are evaluated. In response, this study investigates whether it is reasonable to employ the RG Score as <b>evidence</b> <b>of</b> scholarly <b>reputation.</b> For this, three different author samples were investigated. An outlier sample includes 104 authors with high values. A Nobel sample comprises 73 Nobel winners from Medicine & Physiology, Chemistry, Physics and Economics (from 1975 to 2015). A longitudinal sample includes weekly data on 4 authors with different RG Scores. The results suggest that high RG Scores are built primarily from activity related to asking and answering questions in the site. In particular, it seems impossible to get a high RG Score solely through publications. Within RG it is possible to distinguish between (passive) academics that interact little in the site and active platform users, who can get high RG Scores through engaging with others inside the site (questions, answers, social networks with influential researchers). Thus, RG Scores should not be mistaken for academic reputation indicators. Comment: 19 pages, 7 tables, 4 figure...|$|R

The tablets show grieving for a dead Athenian woman as well as her lying in state and being transported to a gravesite. Exekias conveys both the grief and the dignity of the figures. One special feature, for example, is that the leader of the funeral procession turns his face to look at the viewer directly, so to speak. The depiction of the horses is also unique; they have individual temperaments and are not reduced to their function as noble animals, as is otherwise customary on vases.|$|R

Long-term systemic memory plays a role in the emergence <b>of</b> researcher <b>reputation,</b> and likely plays a strong role in social stratification [31]–[33].

40|$|Globalizing {{knowledge}} economies foster {{conditions that}} intensify {{the role and}} value <b>of</b> organizational <b>reputation</b> risk. In an enterprise-focused era, reputation is a key strategic construct that {{can act as a}} boundary object linking communities within and between organizations. Yet approaches to its management tend to be reactive and remain under the hold of industrial society principles. Definitions <b>of</b> <b>reputation</b> risk in the existing literature and the business community have a tendency to be static and asset oriented. We suggest that this contrasts sharply with insights on the social construction of knowledge that inform recent risk studies. Drawing on this critique, we argue that the ambivalence engendered by on-going processes of definition (responsibilities, boundaries, fact construction) characterizing the knowledge society demands a reconceptualization <b>of</b> <b>reputation</b> risk. We propose a reconceptualization <b>of</b> <b>reputation</b> risk that not only incorporates a more sophisticated view <b>of</b> <b>reputation,</b> but also acknowledges the role that risk and trust relations can play in its constitution.

We rebuff such narrow representations <b>of</b> <b>reputation</b> by showing the multiplicity <b>of</b> <b>reputation</b> {{in the case of a}} global management consulting firm and demonstrate how it has sustained such reputations.

Findings: We find significant differences in perceptions <b>of</b> <b>reputation</b> between and within stakeholder groups, with perceptions changing across dimensions and geographies.
