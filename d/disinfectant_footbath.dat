40|$|On-farm {{biosecurity}} {{practices have}} been promoted in many animal industries to protect animal populations from infections. Current approaches based on regression modelling techniques for assessing biosecurity perceptions and practices are limited {{for analysis of}} the interrelationships between multivariate data. A suitable approach, which does not require background knowledge of relationships, is provided by Bayesian network modelling. Here we apply such an approach to explore the complex interrelationships between the variables representing horse managers' perceptions of effectiveness of on-farm biosecurity practices. The dataset was derived from interviews conducted with 200 horse managers in Australia after the 2007 equine influenza outbreak. Using established computationally intensive techniques, an optimal graphical statistical model was identified whose structure was objectively determined, directly from the observed data. This methodology is directly analogous to multivariate regression (i. e. multiple response variables). First, an optimal model structure was identified using an exact (exhaustive) search algorithm, followed by pruning the selected model for over-fitting by the parametric bootstrapping approach. Perceptions about effectiveness of movement restrictions and access control were linked but were generally segregated from the perceptions about effectiveness of personal and equipment hygiene. Horse managers believing in the effectiveness of complying with movement restrictions in stopping equine influenza spread onto their premises {{were also more likely}} to believe in the effectiveness of reducing their own contact with other horses and curtailing professional visits. Similarly, the variables representing the effectiveness of disinfecting vehicles, using a <b>disinfectant</b> <b>footbath,</b> changing into clean clothes on arrival at the premises and washing hands before contact with managed horses were clustered together. In contrast, horse managers believing in the effectiveness of disinfecting vehicles (hygiene measure) were less likely to believe in the effectiveness of controlling who has access to managed horses (access control). The findings of this analysis provide new insights into the relationships between perceptions of effectiveness of different biosecurity measures. Different extension education strategies might be required for horse managers believing more strongly in the effectiveness of access control or hygiene measures. 8 page(s...|$|E
40|$|In October 2005 {{a devastating}} {{earthquake}} caused extensive damage among populations in Pakistan administered Kashmiri Region {{and parts of}} North Western Frontier. In addition {{to the loss of}} more than 87 ` 000 human lives and 70 ` 000 injured, many livestock namely buffaloes, cattle and goats were lost. This eroded the livelihoods of families that solely relied on livestock and agriculture for their economic survival. &# 13; The International Committee of the Red Cross together with the German Red Cross (ICRC/ GRC) and the Kashmiri authorities formulated a project that sought to restore the livelihoods of the most vulnerable households to a level comparable to before the earthquake. The project adapted an agro-vet and micro-economic approach, part of which included the provision of a milking cow and calf. &# 13; This report indicates that antibiotics and homoeopathic medicines provide similar levels of protection against mastitis (Spranger, 2000). Preventive measures like vaccinations, <b>disinfectant</b> <b>footbaths</b> and reducing stress during the critical time of calving goes a long way towards improving the overall health of the dairy cows (Dettloff, 2005). Although milking is in many cases still done by hand, pre-milking and post-milking hygienic procedures, such as udder washing and drying greatly decrease prevalence of mastitis...|$|R
