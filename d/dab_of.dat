2500|$|The critic James Wolcott, in {{a review}} of Updike's last novel, The Widows of Eastwick (2008), noted that Updike's penchant for observing America's decline is coupled with an {{affirmation}} of America's ultimate merits: [...] "Updike elegises entropy American-style with a resigned, paternal, disappointed affection that distinguishes his fiction from that of grimmer declinists: Don DeLillo, Gore Vidal, Philip Roth. America may have lost its looks and stature, but it was a beauty once, and worth every golden <b>dab</b> <b>of</b> sperm." ...|$|E
2500|$|Coated with thickly layered vocal harmonies, [...] "Shadows" [...] was co-written and {{produced}} by Propellerheads' Alex Gifford.

Again Dullin showed his talent for character creation and Copeau too took a major role bringing to the text an inspired interpretation. A popular revival of the Copeau-Croué adaptation of The Brothers Karamazov saw Dullin once again as Smerdiakov, Jouvet as Feodor, and Copeau as Ivan. In May, the troupe, exhausted but buoyed by its artistic and sometimes critical successes, staged an adaptation of Shakespeare's Twelfth Night or Nuit des rois to close the season. Both in its preparation and mise-en-scène, Nuit de rois has entered into legend. Stories abound of Copeau and Jouvet working forty-eight hours non-stop to set the lighting and of Duncan Grant, the English artist who created the costumes, chasing after actors to apply one last <b>dab</b> <b>of</b> color just before the curtain was to come up. The play garnered both critical and public acclaim. With Jouvet as Sir Andrew Aguecheek, Suzanne Bing as Viola, Blanche Albane as Olivia, and Romain Bouquet as Sir Toby Belch, in a startling simple stage setting, the play called upon the audience's imagination in a way that had not been seen on a Paris stage since Paul Fort, an earlier reformer who had worked in the theatre in the 1890s. Enthusiastic crowds finally queued up to see this rendition of [...] "real Shakespeare" [...] (Kurtz, pg. 31), but the run closed as scheduled for the troupe was off to Alsace on tour.|$|E

2500|$|The {{earliest}} structures had {{roofs of}} thatch or earth supported by flat poles. Tejas (roof tiles) were utilized in later construction (beginning around 1790) {{to replace the}} flammable thatch. The semicircular tiles consisted of clay molded over a section of a log was which well-sanded to prevent the clay from sticking. According to the accounts of Father Estévan Tapís of Mission Santa Barbara, some thirty-two Native American males were required to make 500 tiles each day, while the women carried sand and straw to the pits. The mixture was first worked in pits under the hoofs of animals, then placed on a flat board and fashioned to the correct thickness. Sheets of clay were then placed over the logs and cut the desired to size: they ranged in length from , and tapered from [...] in width. After trimming, the tiles were dried in the sun, then placed in ovens and burned until they took on a reddish-brown coloring. The quality of the tiles varied greatly among the missions {{due to differences in}} soil types from one site to another. Legend has it that the first tiles were made at Mission San Luis Obispo, but Father Maynard Geiger (the Franciscan historian and biographer of Junípero Serra) claims that Mission San Antonio de Padua was actually the first to use them. Aside from their obvious advantage over straw roofs in terms of fire retardance, the impermeable surface also protected the adobe walls below from the damaging effects of rain. The original tiles [...] were secured with a <b>dab</b> <b>of</b> adobe and were held in place because of their shape, being tapered at the upper end so they could not slide off one another.|$|E

40|$|Abstract Background Human Disabled- 2 (DAB 2), is a {{multi-function}} signalling molecule that it {{is frequently}} down-regulated in human cancers. We aimed to investigate the possible tumour suppressor effect <b>of</b> <b>DAB</b> 2 in nasopharyngeal carcinoma (NPC). Methods We studied the expression <b>of</b> <b>DAB</b> 2 in NPC cell lines, xenografts and primary tumour samples. The status of promoter methylation was assessed by methylation specific PCR and bisulfite sequencing. The functional role <b>of</b> <b>DAB</b> 2 in NPC was investigated by re-introducing DAB 2 expression into NPC cell line C 666 - 1. Results Decrease or absent <b>of</b> <b>DAB</b> 2 transcript was observed in NPC cell lines and xenografts. Loss <b>of</b> <b>DAB</b> 2 protein expression was seen in 72 % (33 / 46) of primary NPC as demonstrated by immunohistochemistry. Aberrant DAB 2 promoter methylation was detected in 65. 2 % (30 / 46) of primary NPC samples by methylation specific PCR. Treatment <b>of</b> the <b>DAB</b> 2 negative NPC cell line C 666 - 1 with 5 -aza- 2 '-deoxycytidine resulted in restoration <b>of</b> <b>DAB</b> 2 expression in a dose-dependent manner. Overexpression <b>of</b> <b>DAB</b> 2 in NPC cell line C 666 - 1 resulted in reduced growth rate and 35 % reduction in anchorage-dependent colony formation, and inhibition of serum-induced c-Fos expression compared to vector-transfected controls. Over expression <b>of</b> <b>DAB</b> 2 resulted in alterations of multiple pathways as demonstrated by expression profiling and functional network analysis, which confirmed the role <b>of</b> <b>DAB</b> 2 as an adaptor molecule involved in multiple receptor-mediated signalling pathways. Conclusions We report the frequent down regulation <b>of</b> <b>DAB</b> 2 in NPC and the promoter hypermethylation contributes to the loss <b>of</b> expression <b>of</b> <b>DAB</b> 2. This is the first study demonstrating frequent DAB 2 promoter hypermethylation in human cancer. Our functional studies support the putative tumour suppressor effect <b>of</b> <b>DAB</b> 2 in NPC cells. </p...|$|R
