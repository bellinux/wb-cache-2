25|$|Walter Lowrie reminds {{the reader}} that Kierkegaard has said, 'With my right hand <b>I</b> <b>held</b> <b>out</b> the Edifying Discourses, with my left the {{aesthetic}} works-and all grasped with the right hand what I held in my left.’ This would pair right and left as Three Discourses on Imagined Occasions and Stages on Life’s Way, then Three Discourses in Various Spirits with A Literary Review; and The Lilies of the Field and the Birds of the Air with Either/Or, 2nd edition. He indicates a plan to Kierkegaard's writing.|$|E
60|$|<b>I</b> <b>held</b> <b>out</b> my hands. The grey {{creature}} {{in the corner}} leant forward.|$|E
60|$|<b>I</b> <b>held</b> <b>out</b> my hand mechanically, and {{he pressed}} it, {{and went with}} me to the door.|$|E
6000|$|<b>I</b> still <b>held</b> <b>out</b> for CITY MERCHANDIZE, {{which had}} taken my fancy. [...] "Some of the chaps' people won't like it," [...] said Naylor, [...] "certain not to. And it sounds Rum." ...|$|R
60|$|His eyes gleamed with excitement. He almost {{snatched}} at the papers, but <b>I</b> <b>held</b> them <b>out</b> of his reach. Then {{with a sharp}} little cry {{the woman}} stood suddenly between us. There was a look almost of horror on her pale strained face, as she <b>held</b> <b>out</b> her hand as though to push me away.|$|R
60|$|<b>I</b> {{rose and}} <b>held</b> <b>out</b> my hand. He held {{it between his}} for a moment, and his eyes sought mine.|$|R
60|$|<b>I</b> <b>held</b> <b>out</b> {{my hand to}} {{the tall}} man, who look it in a hesitating, half-reluctant fashion.|$|E
60|$|He {{looked so}} sad, and yet withal so comical, that <b>I</b> <b>held</b> <b>out</b> {{my hand to}} him, laughing.|$|E
60|$|<b>I</b> <b>held</b> <b>out</b> {{my hand to}} {{help her}} to the ground, but she paused on the second step.|$|E
60|$|For a {{few moments}} she was silent. She looked at me however; and as I watched her eyes grow softer <b>I</b> {{suddenly}} <b>held</b> <b>out</b> my hand, {{and for a moment}} she suffered hers to rest in it. Then she drew away a little.|$|R
60|$|This was {{the prettiest}} {{of all his}} exploits. It was so pretty that, {{contrary}} to his rule, he repeated it. <b>I</b> had <b>held</b> <b>out</b> my arms to him, and first he shook his head, and then {{after a long pause}} (to frighten me), he nodded it.|$|R
6000|$|... "I'm {{grateful}} to her, anyway," [...] the latter resumed. [...] "I believe <b>I</b> could have <b>held</b> <b>out</b> another day or two, but it wouldn't have been pleasant." ...|$|R
60|$|My answer may, at first, {{have seemed}} hardly to the point. <b>I</b> <b>held</b> <b>out</b> the brief to him.|$|E
60|$|There {{was a deep}} silence. Then <b>I</b> <b>held</b> <b>out</b> my hand to {{my father}} and he clasped it.|$|E
60|$|He {{started at}} the sound of my voice, and took a quick step towards me. <b>I</b> <b>held</b> <b>out</b> my hand.|$|E
60|$|I did {{not look}} at her, but I could feel her standing, {{watching}} me. If I had looked up, she would, <b>I</b> knew, have <b>held</b> <b>out</b> her arms to me....|$|R
60|$|I {{said not}} a word, {{hoping that the}} unlooked-for sight of Owen would break down her resolution. <b>I</b> just <b>held</b> <b>out</b> my hand to her, and led her downstairs. She clung to me and her hands were as cold as snow. When I opened the parlor door I stood back, and pushed her in before me.|$|R
6000|$|... "I {{should have}} thought {{that we might have}} {{understood}} each other at first," [...] said the squire. [...] "Did I ever make you any promise, or give you any hint that I intended to provide for my niece? Have <b>I</b> ever <b>held</b> <b>out</b> to you any such hope? I don't know what you mean by that word 'at last'--unless it be to give offence." ...|$|R
60|$|<b>I</b> <b>held</b> <b>out</b> the telegram. It {{was from}} Aunt Cynthia. She had wired us to send Fatima to Halifax by express immediately.|$|E
60|$|Just what my {{mother-in-law}} had said! just what Benjamin and Major Fitz-David had said! They were all against me. And still <b>I</b> <b>held</b> <b>out.</b>|$|E
6000|$|... 'I {{have cut}} myself,' I said, 'and rather badly. See!' And <b>I</b> <b>held</b> <b>out</b> my two hands {{from which the}} blood was oozing and dripping.|$|E
60|$|As I {{turned the}} corner of the gable, the mastiff bounded towards me in stern silence, but with the eye and the whole air of a tiger. <b>I</b> <b>held</b> him <b>out</b> my hand, however, in token of amity--and I never yet knew the dog who was proof against such an appeal to his courtesy. He not only shut his mouth and wagged his tail, but {{absolutely}} offered me his paw-afterward extending his civilities to Ponto.|$|R
6000|$|... "No," [...] he said reflectively, [...] "I don't quite think you're right. It wasn't thirst {{that brought}} Grenfell to his end. He had more water {{than either of}} us--you saw to that--and, though it wouldn't have been pleasant, you and <b>I</b> could have <b>held</b> <b>out</b> another day." ...|$|R
60|$|The {{fifteen years}} that have passed since I spoke these words must, I think, have {{convinced}} some of my immediate hearers {{that the need for}} such an appeal was more pressing than they then imagined;--while they have also more and more convinced me myself that the ground I took for it was secure, and that the youths and girls now entering on the duties of active life are able to accept and fulfil the hope <b>I</b> then <b>held</b> <b>out</b> to them.|$|R
60|$|Did I {{not know}} it? I never waited to answer him, but, striding across the room, <b>I</b> <b>held</b> <b>out</b> {{my hand over}} the table--to Chatellerault.|$|E
60|$|As <b>I</b> <b>held</b> <b>out</b> my hand, as Miss Halcombe, who was nearest to me, took it, Miss Fairlie {{turned away}} {{suddenly}} and hurried from the room.|$|E
6000|$|I have {{suffered}} at times from speaking too frankly, but I had full trust in Harry, {{and told him}} all, adding as <b>I</b> <b>held</b> <b>out</b> the letter: ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I am glad <b>I</b> have <b>held</b> <b>out</b> until <b>I</b> got back," [...] {{his father}} said, {{in a low}} voice. [...] "It is all up with me, my boy, and I {{have only a few}} hours to live, at most. I am sorry, now, that you did not start for England before this happened; but I have no doubt that it is all for the best. I shall die, as I should wish to die, doing my duty and, except for leaving you, I shall feel small regret." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I ask pardon for intruding, Mistress Thankful Blossom," [...] he said gravely; [...] "but <b>I</b> have here"--he <b>held</b> <b>out</b> a pretentious document--"a {{letter for}} you from headquarters. May I hope that it {{contains}} good news,--the release of your father.--and that it relieves you from my presence, and an espionage which I assure you cannot be more unpleasant to you {{than it has been}} to myself." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Well, {{there was}} a scene, I can't deny that. We had a regular family conclave--father, mother, Aunt Hitty, and all the folks--and we kept it up pretty much all night. The princess wasn't there, of course, and I could {{convince}} them that I was right. If she had been, I don't believe <b>I</b> could have <b>held</b> <b>out.</b> But they {{had to listen to}} reason, and I got away between two days." ...|$|R
6000|$|... 'Lizzie Hexam, Lizzie Hexam,' {{then began}} Miss Potterson, 'how often have <b>I</b> <b>held</b> <b>out</b> {{to you the}} {{opportunity}} of getting clear of your father, and doing well?' ...|$|E
60|$|I half {{rose and}} threw down my napkin, though with some reluctance. <b>I</b> <b>held</b> <b>out</b> my hand regretfully to Mr. Marx, {{but he refused}} to take it.|$|E
6000|$|<b>I</b> <b>held</b> <b>out</b> my hand {{to check}} her. [...] "Let him alone!" [...] I whispered hoarsely. [...] "I will go away. Don't you see that he is resting." ...|$|E
60|$|Now, if he {{had handed}} me the rod, and then taken another boat and gone home, perhaps I might have known {{what to do with}} the thing after a while, but I must say that at that minute <b>I</b> didn't. <b>I</b> <b>held</b> the rod <b>out</b> over the water and let the flies dangle down into it, but do what I would, they wouldn't sink; there wasn't weight enough on them.|$|R
6000|$|... 'Perhaps so; but I {{have always}} looked on Clement {{as my own}} substitute. Indeed, <b>I</b> <b>held</b> that hope <b>out</b> to my father, when it distressed him that I should give it up. So Clem is pretty well settled, thank you. Besides I am not afraid of his not going on well here; but I do believe Fulbert will do the better for being more independent, only {{it seems to me}} too much to let you {{undertake}} for us.' ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Then Wakem knows on't!" [...] said Mr. Tulliver, his eye {{kindling}} with triumphant fire. [...] "Ah!" [...] he went on, with a long-drawn guttural enunciation, {{taking out}} his snuff-box, the only luxury {{he had left}} himself, and tapping it with something of his old air of defiance. [...] "I'll get from under his thumb now, though I must leave the old mill. I thought <b>I</b> could ha' <b>held</b> <b>out</b> to die here--but I can't----we've got a glass o' nothing in the house, have we, Bessy?" ...|$|R
