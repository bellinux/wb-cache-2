40|$|The {{nexus of}} {{advanced}} manufacturing methods, computer-aided design tools, and modern structural-analysis software has enabled {{the design and}} fabrication of structurally complex wing structures with unique features. This is particularly true for small unmanned aircraft, in which discrete <b>structural</b> <b>hinges</b> can easily {{be integrated into the}} overall vehicle design. This paper examines the use of discrete <b>structural</b> <b>hinges</b> for tailoring the low-frequency flight dynamics of the vehicle. For sufficiently soft discrete <b>structural</b> <b>hinges,</b> substantial couplingbetween flexible and rigid modes occurs, leading to the potential to modify the flight dynamic behavior through structural flexibility. Using a multibody flight dynamics simulation tool with a nonlinear lifting-line aerodynamic representation, different structural-hinge elastic properties, orientation, and location on the aircraft are examined. The results for a small unmanned aircraft indicate that flexibility mostly affects the longitudinal modes and associated handling qualities of the vehicle. Changes in the short-period and phugoid modes due to flexibility caused by a set of discrete <b>structural</b> <b>hinges</b> are often antagonistic. A structural-hinge stiffness above a certain critical value tends to improve short-period flying qualities; below this value, the short-period flying qualities degrade. In addition to the stiffness characteristics of the discrete <b>structural</b> <b>hinge,</b> orientation of the hinge has a significant effect on flight dynamics. Orienting the <b>structural</b> <b>hinge</b> to produce pitch–flap coupling can triple the short-period-mode damping, which could improve a nominally Level 3 rated aircraft to a Level 1 rated aircraft...|$|R

30|$|Uplifts and slopes are {{favorable}} {{places for}} oil and gas accumulation in old Proterozoic–Paleozoic layers. Over geological history, sedimentary depressions, slopes, and uplifts may have migrated or converted between depression and uplift in a “seesaw” movement, where the fulcrums are linearly distributed in the plane, forming a hinge zone for tectonic activity. For the migration and the preservation of oil and gas, or the formation and reformation of the high-quality carbonate reservoirs, the hinge structure is highly favorable (Jin 2012). At present, the spatial distribution of a hinge zone is estimated mainly through the calculation of denudation quantity and reconstruction of the paleo-structure, and qualitatively used to define its relationship with oil and gas accumulation (Li et al. 2009; Wang et al. 2011; 2012; Jin 2012). In the future, more studies are required to classify tectonic hinge zones and recognize and characterize them quantitatively. This would require investigating the formation, evolution, and spatial distribution of different <b>structural</b> <b>hinge</b> belts. Furthermore, the control of <b>structural</b> <b>hinge</b> belts on various reservoir-formation factors, such as hydrocarbon sources, reservoirs, migration systems, traps, migration, accumulation, and preservation should be investigated against the backdrop of multistage tectonic change and multistage oil and gas accumulation.|$|R

The element can be of arbitrary cross section and is capable of including inelastic behaviour close to <b>structural</b> <b>hinges.</b> The element formulation can accommodate elasto-plastic strain hardening material behaviour. The solution procedure involves the analysis of elastic and inelastic deformations separately facilitated by splitting of the element length into elastic and inelastic zones. Deformation is calculated by considering inelastic behaviour in the element volume close to both ends of the structural member using an optimum number of integration points in order to achieve good accuracy while maintaining computational efficiency. The predictions of both conventional- and quasi-hinge elements are compared against predictions from Abaqus™. Predictions of the quasi-hinge element show significant improvements over the conventional-hinge method and are shown to converge on the Abaqus™ prediction as the number of monitoring sections in the element is increased...|$|R
40|$|Findings from {{previous}} {{studies have indicated that}} a reinforced concrete wall with a <b>structural</b> <b>hinge</b> at the base, used to reduce the strength requirement for the foundation, can be effective for limiting the drift demand for frames subjected to strong ground motions. The goal {{of this study was to}} investigate whether the development of a hinge at the foundation, rather than at the wall, would affect the behavior of the building negatively. A series of 17 of small-scale foundation models supported on sand was conducted in order to calibrate a numerical model proposed in this study and to formulate simplified relations for the response of foundations in buildings subjected to ground motions. Drift responses for two structures representative of medium and high-rise residential buildings in Turkey, were calculated with and without foundation yielding assuming that the supporting soil consisted of the sand used in the experimental program of this study. It was found that foundation yielding did not negatively affect the drift responses of the structures because the supporting soil provided sufficient energy dissipation/deformation capacity. ...|$|R

We have adopted a multifaceted approach to understanding the pathogenically important structure of P-pili, the class I adhesion pili from pyelonephritic Escherichia coli. Our approach combines electron cryomicroscopy, site-directed mutagenesis, homology modeling, and energy calculations, resulting in a high-resolution model of PapA, the major structural element of these pili. Fitting of the modeled PapA subunit into the electron cryomicroscopy data provides a detailed view of these pilins within the supramolecular architecture of the pilus filament. A <b>structural</b> <b>hinge</b> in the N-terminal region of the subunit {{is located at the}} site of a newly resolved electron density that protrudes from the P-pilus surface. The structural flexibility provided by this hinge is necessary for assembly of P-pili, illustrating one solution to construction of large macromolecular complexes from small repeating units. These data support our hypothesis that domain-swapped pilin subunits transit the outer cell membrane vertically and rotate about the hinge for final positioning into the pilus filament. Our data confirm and supply a structural basis for much previous genetic, biochemical, and structural data.

The release of tRNA in cytoplasm involves RanGTP hydrolysis. Despite the availability of crystal structures of nuclear and cytosolic forms of Xpot, the molecular details regarding the sequential events leading to tRNA release and subsequent conformational changes occurring in Xpot remain unknown. We have performed a combination of classical all-atom and accelerated molecular dynamics simulations {{on a set of}} complexes involving Xpot to study a range of features including conformational flexibility of free and cargo-bound Xpot and functionally critical contacts between Xpot and its cargo. The systems investigated include free Xpot and its different complexes, bound either to Ran (GTP/GDP) or tRNA or both. This approach provided a statistically reliable estimate of structural dynamics of Xpot after cargo release. The mechanistic basis for Xpot opening after cargo release has been explained in terms of dynamic <b>structural</b> <b>hinges,</b> about which neighboring region could be displaced to facilitate the nuclear to cytosolic state transition. Post-RanGTP hydrolysis, a cascade of events including local conformational change in RanGTP and loss of critical contacts at Xpot/tRNA interface suggest factors responsible for eventual release of tRNA.

40|$|Abstract Background Relating {{features}} of protein sequences to <b>structural</b> <b>hinges</b> {{is important for}} identifying domain boundaries, understanding structure-function relationships, and designing flexibility into proteins. Efforts in this field have been hampered {{by the lack of}} a proper dataset for studying characteristics of hinges. Results Using the Molecular Motions Database we have created a Hinge Atlas of manually annotated hinges and a statistical formalism for calculating the enrichment of various types of residues in these hinges. Conclusion We found various correlations between hinges and sequence features. Some of these are expected; for instance, we found that hinges tend to occur on the surface and in coils and turns and to be enriched with small and hydrophilic residues. Others are less obvious and intuitive. In particular, we found that hinges tend to coincide with active sites, but unlike the latter they are not at all conserved in evolution. We evaluate the potential for hinge prediction based on sequence. Motions {{play an important role in}} catalysis and protein-ligand interactions. Hinge bending motions comprise the largest class of known motions. Therefore it is important to relate the hinge location to sequence features such as residue type, physicochemical class, secondary structure, solvent exposure, evolutionary conservation, and proximity to active sites. To do this, we first generated the Hinge Atlas, a set of protein motions with the hinge locations manually annotated, and then studied the coincidence of these features with the hinge location. We found that all of the features have bearing on the hinge location. Most interestingly, we found that hinges tend to occur at or near active sites and yet unlike the latter are not conserved. Less surprisingly, we found that hinge residues tend to be small, not hydrophobic or aliphatic, and occur in turns and random coils on the surface. A functional sequence based hinge predictor was made which uses some of the data generated in this study. The Hinge Atlas is made available to the community for further flexibility studies. </p...|$|R
40|$|Thyroid hormones (THs) play {{essential}} {{roles in}} numerous critical physiological processes. The crucial functions of TH are exerted through binding to the thyroid hormone receptor (TR). TRs can specifically regulate gene transcription {{in response to}} TH binding. The two major functional domains, the DNA binding domain and the ligand binding domain, in the TRs are the key player working in collaboration to exert TR function. Although the overall procedures of TR actions have been revealed, the molecular mechanisms managing the fine-tuning of different aspects {{in the course of}} the transactivation have yet to be defined. The DNA binding domain (DBD) of TR is responsible for recognizing and binding to different classes of the DNA response elements in the promoter regions of target genes. We report here the first crystal structure of a homodimer TR DBD in complex with a inverted repeat type of thyroid response element (F 2 TRE). The structure reveals a nearly symmetric structure of the TR DBD assembled on the F 2 TRE. The T-box regions of the DBDs in the structure exhibit their function as a <b>structural</b> <b>hinge</b> that enables a large degree of flexibility in positioning of the C-terminal extension, which connects the DBD to the ligand binding domain (LBD). The C-terminal tail regions have also been shown to assist the cooperative homodimeric assembly of the TR DBD on the F 2 TRE. The TR LBD is responsible for the ligand-dependent coregulator recruiting and transcription activation. In contrary to the common assumption that ligand binding induces a dramatic conformation change in the C-terminal helix of the TR LBD, our data from computational homology modeling and molecular dynamic simulations support that the PPAR-based apo TR LBD model in which the helix 12 adopts a relatively stable conformation mimicking the active holo TR LBD structure. Thus the corepressor binding to the apo TR LBD is an induced fit process. From in silicon studies on the TR LBDs with the corepressor peptides, we have further identified the crucial components determining the TR preference on the nuclear receptor corepressor (NCoR) ...|$|R

All seven test specimens initially experienced minor-axis overall buckling followed by formation of a plastic hinge at the mid-height region, leading to local buckling of the flanges on the compression side of the plastic hinge, and eventual folding of the compression flanges. The experimental energy absorption, based on load-displacement relations, was compared to the energy estimates based on section plastic moment resistance based on measured yield stress and based on measured hinge rotations. It was found that the theoretical plastic hinge model underestimates a column’s actual ability to absorb energy by a factor in the range of 3 to 4 below that obtained from tests. It was also noted that the realizable hinge rotation is less than 180 °. The above observations are based, of course, on actual columns being able to sustain high tensile strains at hinge locations without fracturing...|$|R

40|$|The Cretaceous-Tertiary northwest-trending Sirt Basin system, Libya is a rift/sag basin {{formed on}} Pan-African to Paleozoic-aged {{basement}} of North Africa. This study is {{an investigation of}} the rift-basin architecture and tectonic framework of the western Sirt Basin. A combination of several geological and geophysical methods (remote sensing interpretation supported by surface geologic maps, borehole data analysis, from about 300 deep wells, extensive seismic reflection profiles and maps, and paleostress analysis), have been used to construct geological cross sections, and surface and subsurface geology maps that have proved particularly useful in identifying various regional and local structures in the study area. Indication of the relative timing of structures and movement along faults has been determined where possible. We recognize six lithostratigraphic sequences (phases) in the area's stratigraphic framework. A Pre-graben (Pre-rift) initiation stage involved the Pre-Cretaceous sediments formed before the main Sirt Basin subsidence. Then followed a Cretaceous to Eocene graben-fill stage that can divided into four structurally-active and structurally-inactive periods, and finally a terminal continental siliciclastics-rich package representing the Eocene post-rift stage. Late Eocene rocks exposed {{in the western part of}} the basin exhibit a complex network of branching segmented normal and strike-slip faults, generally with a NNW-SSE structural grain. Many surface structural features have been interpreted from satellite images which confirm sinistral strike-slip kinematics. Relay ramp structures, numerous elongate asymmetric synclines associated with shallow west limbs and steeper dipping east limbs are developed in the hangingwalls adjacent to west downthrowing normal faults. These structural patterns reflect Cretaceous/Tertiary extensional tectonics with additional control by underlying pre-existing Pan-African basement fabrics and ENE-WSW trending Hercynian structures. The interpretation of a large volume of two-way time seismic data has allowed the construction of long regional seismic cross sections and resultant time structure contour and thickness maps, thus enabling an understanding of the structural and stratigraphic relationships on a regional scale. Six major fault systems were identified initially from the remote sensing study and was subsequently expanded to seven on the basis of interpretation of 2 D seismic data. These fault systems dissect the study area into geomorphological elevated blocks and depressions. Most of the oil fields present in the study area are associated with <b>structural</b> <b>hinge</b> zones and adjoining highs. A new kinematic and structural conceptual model is proposed here for the evolution of NW Libya (Jifarah Basin and the Nafusah Uplift) and Hun Graben during Late Eocene times. The multidisciplinary approach used in this study has resulted in good surface and sub-surface structure correlation and future petroleum prospectivity has been identified in this study. We relate the Sirt Basin rift development as exemplified in our study area to the break-up of Gondwana represented by the structural evolution of the West-Central African rift system and the South and Central Atlantic, the Tethys and the Indian Oceans. ...|$|R

Recently determined crystal structures of topoisomerase fragments, representing nearly all the known subclasses, have been solved. The type IB enzymes are structurally distinct from other known topoisomerases but are similar to a class of enzymes referred to as tyrosine recombinases. A putative topoisomerase I open reading frame from the kinetoplastid Leishmania donovani was reported which shared a substantial degree of homology with type IB topoisomerases but having a variable C-terminus.

Separate time analysis and frequency analysis by themselves do not fully describe the nature of these nonstationary dynamic loads. In the past few years, significant effort has been devoted to wavelets and time-frequency analysis. The appropriateness of emerging joint-time frequency analysis techniques for structural engineering problems is evaluated. Emphasis is focused on adaptive methods and the wavelet transform is also considered for validation purposes. In particular, the adaptive chirplet decomposition method and the empirical mode decomposition method are investigated. The required level of sophistication of the adaptive analysis is assessed. Mathematical expressions pertaining to time-frequency estimators are derived. Specifically, a transition from individual spectrograms to evolutionary power spectrum is attempted and function-specific decompositions are used for the estimation of the mean instantaneous frequency. Further, the Bootstrap method is employed for the assessment of the accuracy of the statistical estimators for the cases where limited data is available. An alternative approach utilizing function-specific decompositions for the derivation of well defined Hilbert spectra is suggested.

40|$|The {{principal}} claim of this dissertation {{is that there}} is a unique structural core shared by Double Object, Dative Experiencer and Existential/Presentational constructions. This core is argued to take the form of a Cipient Predication structure, `cipient covering traditional notions like (affected) source/goal, recipient, indirect object or dative experiencer. Central questions arising in defining Cipient Predication are: How are cipients thematically licensed, and what is the role of there in argument-structural terms? What is the structural locus of cipients/there? What is the role and nature of dative case? How can the possessive interpretation, the blocking and definiteness effects associated with the above-mentioned constructions be explained? Cipients are presented as external arguments and logical subjects (location individuals) of predicates derived from a propositional meaning embedded in the VP, the predicate formed by a lower tense head `little t that is overtly realized as there. Little t is argued to encode a distinction at the reference time level, <b>structural</b> dative <b>hinging</b> on a tense property like structural nominative. The cipient relates as a whole to a part to a VP-internal location argument that together with the theme furnishes the propositional meaning (`possession). As logical subjects, cipients anchor the predicate to the utterance context, forcing its interpretation in extralinguistic terms (`blocking effects). It is proposed that lacking structurally encoded subjects, Existential/Presentational constructions are not saturated expressions in syntax, precluding the interpretation of certain quantifiers (most/every, vide `definiteness effects). Cipient Predication, couched in terms of the Minimalist Program (in particular, Chomsky 1999) and a semantics relying on tense and the ontological distinction of locations as well as scalar and part-whole structure, should be of interest to scholars working on datives, argument structure, and the syntax/semantics/pragmatics interface more generally...|$|R

This publication uses a photographic method to analyse the curvature assumptions of two dimensional tape spring folds and to define the curvature trends for three dimensional tape spring folds as a basis for calculating the opening moment.

This mechanism grasped interest of many researchers due to its association with neurodegenerative diseases like Alzheimer’s disease, spongiform encephalopathy etc. Despite the biomedical relevance, very {{little is known about}} understanding this mechanism. The quest for ruling principles behind this curious phenomenon that could enable early prediction provided an impetus for our bioinformatics studies. Methodology: A novel method, HIDE, has been developed to find non-domain-swapped homologues and to identify hinge from domain-swapped oligomers. Non-domain-swapped homologues were identified from the protein structural databank for majority of the domain-swapped entries and hinge boundaries could be recognised automatically by means of successive superposition techniques. Different sequence and structural features in domain-swapped proteins and related proteins have also been analysed. Conclusions: The HIDE algorithm was able to identify hinge region in 83 % cases.

Plastic <b>hinge</b> formation in fasteners frequently occurs in timber connections when the yield capacity is exceeded. An innovative pulse echo testing technique was developed for detecting {{the formation of a}} plastic hinge in bolted timber connections and estimating the associated magnitude of connection displacement. A shift in overall signal centroid proved to be the best flTedictor of plastic hinge formation, with a coefficient of determination (R 2) of 0. 9. As the plastic hinge angle increased, the signal centroid shifted to the right since a higher proportion of pulse energy was forced to undergo multiple transverse wave reflections caused by the deformed geometry of the bolt. Because the determination of a shift in signal centroid requires the availability of prior test information for the initially undeformed fastener, an alternate linear relationship between echo amplitude ratios and plastic hinge formation was also proposed with an adjusted R 2 of 0. 87. This three parameter regression equation had the advantages of requiring no prior testing information and eliminating ambiguity in signal analysis associated with selection of echo start and end points. Plastic hinge formation was correlated with connection ductility, magnitude of connection overload and energy based measures of connection damage to assess residual connection capacity...|$|R

A terminal Gly-Cys-Gly was added to allow "dimerization" through disulfide bond formation. Simulations indicate that differences in LacI and PurR hinge primary sequence affect the quaternary structure of the hinge•hinge` interface. However, these alternate hinge orientations would be sterically restricted by the core domain. These results prompted detailed comparison of recently available DNA-bound structures for LacI and truncated LacI(1 – 62) with the PurR structure. Examination revealed that different N-linker and hinge contacts to the core domain of the partner monomer (which binds effector molecule) affect the juxtapositions of the HTH, N-linker, and hinge regions in the DNA binding domain. In addition, the two full-length repressors exhibit {{significant differences in the}} interactions between the core and the C-linker connection to the DNA binding domain. Both linkers and the hinge have been implicated in the allosteric response of these repressors. Intriguingly, one functional difference between these two proteins is that they exhibit opposite allosteric response to effector. Simulations and observed structural distinctions are correlated with mutational analysis and sequence information from the LacI/GalR family to formulate a mechanism for fine-tuning individual repressor function...|$|R
40|$|International audienceChandipura virus (CHAV), {{a member}} of the {{vesiculovirus}} genus, is an emerging human pathogen. As for other rhabdoviruses, CHAV entry into susceptible cells is mediated by its single envelope glycoprotein G which is both involved in receptor recognition and fusion of viral and cellular membranes. Here, we have characterized the fusion properties of CHAV-G. As for vesicular stomatitis virus (VSV, the prototype of the genus) G, fusion is triggered at low pH below 6. 5. We have also analyzed the biochemical properties of a soluble form of CHAV-G ectodomain (CHAV-Gth, generated by thermolysin limited-proteolysis of recombinant VSV particles in which the G gene was replaced by that of CHAV). The overall behavior of CHAV-Gth is similar to that previously reported for VSV-Gth. Particularly, CHAV-Gth pre-fusion trimer is not stable in solution and low-pH-induced membrane association of CHAV-Gth is reversible. Furthermore, CHAV-Gth was crystallized in its low pH post-fusion conformation and its structure was determined at 3. 6 Å resolution. An overall comparison of this structure with the previously reported VSV-Gth post-fusion conformation, shows a high structural similarity as expected from the comparison of primary structure. Among the three domains of G, the pleckstrin homology domain (PHD) appears to be the most divergent and the largest differences are confined to the secondary structure of the major antigenic site of rhabdoviruses. Finally, local differences indicate that CHAV has evolved alternate <b>structural</b> solutions in <b>hinge</b> regions between PH and fusion domains but also distinct pH sensitive switches. Globally the comparison between the post fusion conformation of CHAV and VSV-G highlights several features essential for the protein's function. It also reveals the remarkable plasticity of G in terms of local structures...|$|R
40|$|Deployable {{structures}} {{are required for}} many satellite operations, to deploy booms for communications or area deployment for power generation, and many sophisticated mechanisms {{have been developed for}} these types of structures. However, tape springs, defined as thin metallic strips with an initially curved cross-section, are an attractive <b>structural</b> solution and <b>hinge</b> mechanism for satellite deployable structures because of their low mass, low cost and general simplicity. They have previously been used to deploy booms and array panels in various configurations that incorporate small two-dimensional tape hinges, but they also have the potential to be used in greater numbers to create larger, more geometrically complicated deployable structures. This publication investigates the applicability of using a simplified modelling approach to predict the deployment dynamics of a three dimensional deployable structure that uses a significant quantity of tape springs. This work builds on previous studies which have focused on the analysis of two dimensional tape spring based structures. The configuration being investigated consists of four walls mounted as a square. Each wall has three fold lines allowing the structure to fold down in a concertina style and each fold line is populated by a series of tape spring hinges mounted in pairs. A total number of around 600 individual tape springs elements are used across the 12 fold lines. A computationally efficient method of simulating the three dimensional deployable structure was studied based on a finite element explicit analysis. Equivalent static and dynamic experimental testing on a breadboard structure is presented allowing a direct comparison of the theoretical and experimental data. It was concluded that this simplified analysis approach is capable of modelling the structural dynamics in the deployment direction for three dimensional structural deployments. As a result, the use of this approach could significantly reduce computation time when performing initial design trade-offs...|$|R

[...] İstanbul Technical University, Instıtute of Science and Technology, 2014 Bu tez çalışması kapsamında literatürde son yıllarda yer almış çift yönlü, çok modlu, doğrusal olmayan itme analizinin, tek yönlü uygulamalara göre yapısal davranışı ne ölçüde temsil ettiği araştırılmıştır. Bu amaçla ele alınan betonarme çok katlı bir bina, ilk aşamada tek yönlü ve çok modlu itme analizine tabi tutularak her iki bina doğrultusu için ayrı ayrı incelenmiştir. Daha sonra aynı binada, aynı sayıda mod bileşeni dikkate alınmak suretiyle iki yönlü modal itme analizi uygulanmıştır. Sonuçlar gerçek çözüm olarak kabul edilen doğrusal olmayan dinamik analiz bulgularıyla karşılaştırılmış ve tartışmaya açılmıştır. Dört bölümden oluşan bu çalışmanın birinci bölümünde; konuya giriş yapılmış ve binaların deprem performansının değerlendirilmesi konusunun hangi koşullardan ötürü ortaya çıktığı açıklanmıştır. Çalışmanın ikinci bölümünde; betonarme yapı sistemlerinin deprem performansına göre belirlenmesinde betonarmeyi oluşturan malzeme özellikleri, tasarım ve modelleri, plastik mafsal hipotezi ve süneklik kavramları irdelenmiştir. Günümüzde yürürlükte olan “ 2007 Deprem Bölgelerinde Yapılacak Binalar Hakkında Yönetmelik” içeriğinde olan mevcut binaların değerlendirilmesi ile ilgili genel kurallar da bu bölümde özetlenmiştir. Üçüncü bölümde; 20 katlı betonarme bir binaya ait tasarım boyutları üzerinden tek ve çift yönlü olmak üzere çok modlu itme analizi uygulamaları yapılmıştır. Doğrusal olmayan bu çok modlu sistem yapının deprem yükleri altındaki iç kuvvet ve şekildeğiştirme isteminin ve dolayısıyla kesit hasarlarının bulunmasında kullanılabilir.

Bulgular tezin dördüncü bölümünü oluşturan sonuçlar kısmında tartışılmıştır. In this investigation; {{structural}} {{responses of}} bi-directional, multi-modal, non-linear pushover analysis procedure which {{has taken place}} in the literature in the recent years are compared with the structural responses of uni-directional ones. For this purpose, a reinforced concrete multi-storey building is subjected to uni-directional and multi-modal non-linear pushover analysis in first phase and examined separately for each direction of the building. Later, considering the same number of mode components is performed bi-directional non-linear modal pushover analysis for the same building. Results are comparatively evaluated with the non-linear dynamic analysis findings, which is accepted as exact solution and discussions are carried out. Nonlinear behaviours of the structural materials in the buildings, which are designed with the current force-based code method are specifically described in the current seismic codes. Structures that are designed with the linear “Capacity Design” methods can also demonstrate the expected nonlinear behaviours. In general; in these methods which are used in structures that exhibit linear-elastic characteristics under seismic effects, seismic load reduction factor is used in order {{to take into account the}} structural material behaviours beyond the elastic limits. Elastic earthquake forces are decreased with this reduction factor. Therefore, the behaviour of the structure depends on that coefficient which is calculated during the linear elastic analysis. In the nonlinear analysis methods, different behaviour factors are concerned for each element represent inelastic attitude rather than a single coefficient. Performance based evaluation methods are especially needed in the evaluation of existing structures. Performance based evaluation studies have been accelerated with Vision 2000 (1995), ATC- 40 (1996) and FEMA 273, 274 (1997). The objective of Vision 2000 has been defined as creating the necessary procedures for the determination of predictive seismic performance of structures. FEMA 273 and FEMA 274 documents that were published by Building Seismic Safety Council were followed by the publishing of ATC- 40 in 1996 by Applied Technology Council. In Turkey, seismic performance of structures can be determined with two different approaches described in the “Specification For Buildings To Be Built In Seismic Zones” (2007) (Turkish Seismic Code). The first approach is determining the seismic performance of building with linear elastic analysis methods. Equivalent seismic load or mode superposition methods can be used for calculating the earthquake loads. The second approach is determining the seismic performance of building with deformation-based nonlinear analysis methods. Defined in Turkish Seismic Code; any of the incremental pushover analysis, modal pushover analysis or nonlinear dynamic time history analysis methods can be used for performance evaluation with certain conditions. Nonlinear behaviour of the structure must be determined in performance-based design and evaluation of the structure under the seismic loads. The methods used for this purpose; nonlinear static pushover analysis and nonlinear dynamic analysis are specified in two classification of the methods. Nonlinear behaviour of structure under the seismic loads can be obtained in a manner very close to actual values with the nonlinear dynamic analysis methods. This dynamic analysis method which is also described as time history analysis, has several disadvantages in practical usage about being highly complex and time-consuming. Because of this case, the nonlinear static pushover analysis methods become even more important. In this method; lateral loads which represent the strength of the structure under seismic loads act on the structure at floor levels. Lateral loads are increased with a certain rate and the base shear force and the top displacement relationship is determined until it reaches a certain displacement or collapsing status. In general, nonlinear pushover analysis methods are simplier than the other ones about acquisition and evaluation of the base shear and displacement relationship. This method also creates an intermediate section between deficiencies of linear elastic analysis methods and complexities of the nonlinear dynamic analysis methods. In this thesis, both of the methods are investigated and comparatively evaluated. Based on structural dynamics theory, the modal pushover analysis procedure (MPA) retains the conceptual simplicity of current procedures with invariant force distribution, now common in structural engineering practice. The MPA procedure for estimating seismic demands is extended to unsymmetric-plan buildings. In the MPA procedure, the seismic demand due to individual terms in the modal expansion of the effective earthquake forces is determined by nonlinear static analysis using the inertia force distribution for each mode, which for unsymmetric buildings includes two lateral forces and torque at each floor level. These “modal” demands due to the first few terms of the modal expansion are then combined by the CQC rule to obtain an estimate of the total seismic demand for inelastic systems. In the first section of this four chaptered thesis; the topic has been started with the introduction and proceeded with the explanation for what purpose the idea of assessment of the buildings’ earthquake performance has emerged. In the second part of this study; characteristics, design and models of the <b>structural</b> materials, plastic <b>hinge</b> hypothesis and ductility concept subjects have been investigated in the evaluation of reinforced concrete building systems according to their expected earthquake performances. General rules and code conditions related to the consideration of existing structures, which take place in the operative code “Specification For Buildings To Be Built In Seismic Zones” (2007) also has been summarized in the second section. At the third chapter; uni-directional and bi-directional multi-mode non-linear pushover analysis have been applied to the 20 -storey building which has been designed according to the 2007 Turkish Seismic Code. This multi-modal non-linear system can be used in the determination of the internal forces, deformation demands and damage in the structure under the earthquake loads. In order to compare these datas, an earthquake record has been used for the nonlinear dynamic analysis in terms of obtaining the internal forces which are assumed to be the ‘exact’ responses of the structure. The numerical findings obtained by nonlinear static and dynamic analysis are comparatively discussed in the fourth chapter. It is shown in this chapter that results of nonlinear modal pushover analysis and nonlinear dynamic analysis are approximately the same. However, with the usage of the combination rules, final numerical values are diverging. Therefore, modal pushover analysis method results does not coincide with exact values completely.

Deprem bölgelerinde bulunmaktadır. Bu nedenle can ve mal kayıplarının fazlalığı açısından deprem, doğal afetler içerisinde ayrı bir öneme sahiptir. İmar afları ve siyasi politikalar sonucu mühendislik hizmeti almamış yapıların günden güne artması deprem bilincinin kaybolmasına neden olmuştur. Mühendislerin depreme karşı perde önlemi ilk olarak 13 Mart 1992 Erzincan depremi sonrası gündeme gelmiştir. Son yayınlanan DBYBHY- 2007 ’de ise daha ayrıntılı ele alınmıştır. Perdeler statik anlamda yapıların yanal ötelenmelerini sınırlandırdığı gibi uygulamadaki hataları da çerçeve sistemlere nazaran daha iyi tölere edebilmektedirler. Günümüz müteahitleri arasındaki genel kanının tersine perdeler inşaat maliyetine olumlu yönde katkı yapmaktadır. Kaba İnşaat malzeme maliyetleri içinde en maliyetli kalem inşaat demiridir. Perdeli sistemlerde rijitlik, dayanım ve süneklilik çerçeve sistemlere göre daha verimli bir şekilde sağlanabilmektedir. Yüksek sünek tasarlanan perdeler demir metrajını azaltmakta, kiriş boyutlarının küçülmesine izin vermekte ve böylece beton metrajınıda etkilemektedir. Çalışmada genel hatlarıyla perdelere gereksinim nedenleri, depreme karşı dayanıklı yapı tasarımındaki önemi, inşaat maliyetine olumlu etkileri vurgulanmaktadır. Ayrıca perdelerin DBYBHY- 2007 ’ye göre konstrüktif kuralları açıklanmaktadır. Bu kuralların kullanılan paket programlarından STA 4 CAD’e opsiyon yardımı ile nasıl etki ettirilecekleri, opsiyon ayarları gösterilerek anlatılmaktadır. ETABS ve STA 4 CAD programları ile çift çözüm yapılmış ve toplam yapı kütlesi, periyod gibi dinamik kuvvet unsurları karşılaştırılmıştır.

According {{to current}} regulations, Specifications for Buildings to be build in Seismic Zones, % 66 of our country, % 71 of our population, % 68 of the {{municipalities}} {{are in the}} first or second seismic zone. Therefore, earthquake is essential because of loss of life and property. Because of the remission of development and political strategies, {{there are a lot of}} structures without engineering services therefore, earthquake consciousness disappeared. Engineers have made the wall provision for earthquake at first time after 1992 Erzincan earthquake. More details and information about the walls are given in Specifications for Buildings to be build in Seismic Zones. Walls can not only limit the horizontal displacements of structures but also tolerate the faults which make during construction period, better than the column-beam systems. Walls have benefits to coast of the construction. Rebars have the highest coast of the rough construction. About the rigidity, durability and strength, The walls are better than the column-beam systems. The wall, designed high ductility, can reduce the rebar amount and let the smaller beam dimmensions therefore coast of the concrete will be more affordable. In this study, the requirements of using walls, its importance for Earthquake Resistant Structures benefit to the coast of construction are emphasized. According to Specifications for Buildings to be build in Seismic Zones the construction rules of walls are explained. Structural informations are defined according to Specifications for Buildings to be build in Seismic Zones. Seismic Zone class is determined as Zone 1 therefore Effective Ground Acceleration Coefficient is 0. 4 g. Local Site Class is Z 2 therefore Spectrum Characteristic Periods are between Ta = 0. 15 s. and Tb= 0. 40 s. The structures were analyzed by 2 different softwares, STA 4 CAD and ETABS. STA 4 CAD is a software developed for structural engineering to determine the safety and design of a building under dead load, seismic, temperature, wind and lateral soil effects. The software can run static and RC analysis with taking into account several Turkish and international codes. The program applies matrix-displacement method with 6 unknowns for each node in 3 D space. It applies rigid flooor diapghrams also. ETABS is a software that allows model creation, modification, execution of analysis, design optimization, and results review from within a single interface. Section designer allows definations of complex sections. Intended purpose of building is determined as residential therefore Importance factor of structure is taken into account as 1. Structural Behaviour Factors can change according to ductility level of structure. There are 3 types of building structural system. These are Cast-In-Situ Reinforced Concrete Buildings, Prefabricated Reinforced Concrete Buildings, Structural Steel Buildings. Structural Behaviour Factors can be classified as 2 different groups according to its ductility level. These are Systems of Nominal Ductulity Level and Systems of High Ductulity Level. Every building structural system has 4 groups and each group has 2 different structural behaviour factors. For Cast-In-Situ Reinforced Concrete Buildings, first group is Buildings in which seismic loads are fully resisted by frames, second group is buildings in which seismic loads are fully resisted by coupled structural walls, third group is buildings in which seismic loads are fully resisted by solid structural walls, fourth group is buildings in which seismic loads are fully resisted by frames and solid and/or coupled structural walls. For these groups, Systems of nominal ductulity level is 4. For second and fourth group, Systems of High Ductulity Level is 7. For first group, Systems of High Ductulity Level is 8. For third group, Systems of High Ductulity Level is 6. For Prefabricated Reinforced Concrete Buildings, first group is Buildings in which seismic loads are fully resisted by frames with connections capable of cylic moment transfer, second group is Buildings in which seismic loads are fully resisted by single storey frames with columns hinged at top. Third group is Prefabricated buildings in which seismic loads are fully resisted by prefabricated or cast-in-situ solid and/or coupled <b>structural</b> walls with <b>hinged</b> frame connections. Fourth group is Buildings in which seismic loads are jointly resisted by frames with connections capable of cylic moment transfer and cast-in-stu solid and/or coupled structural walls. For first and fourth group, Systems of nominal ductulity level is 3. For first group, Systems of High Ductulity Level is 7. For second group, Systems of High Ductulity Level is 3. For third group, Systems of High Ductulity Level is 5. For fourth group, Systems of High Ductulity Level is 6. Models are determined as High Ductulity Level, 7. 10 different models were analysed with structural informations which are explained above. Therefore the wall effect to the coast can be seen easily. After rebar and concrete quantities have been calculated, for site class Z 2, rebar cost decreases % 18. 2 and concrete cost increases % 7. 3. For site class Z 3, rebar cost decreases % 21. 5 and concrete cost decreases % 8. 76. As it is understood, If the number of walls increases, the rebar quantities can be reduced. Concrete coast does not change dramatically. Local site class change to Z 3 from Z 2 therefore, site effect can be seen. As we understood, walls benefit to coast of rough construction. These structural elements improve rigidity and strength too. When model 1 and model 10 were designed with ETABS, there are a difference about total weight of building calculated by considering Live Load Participation Factor. If all properities are same, why is there a difference between STA 4 ACD and ETABS? STA 4 CAD is a fully integrated software that can detect depth and width. Beams and columns are defined as frame elements with ETABS therefore, intersection with columns-slabs, beams-slabs calculate twice on ETABS. This is the main reason of the difference. Finally, structures always should analyse with 2 software. Results should be checked. Walls are essential to design earthquake resistant structures. Yüksek LisansM. Sc...|$|R
