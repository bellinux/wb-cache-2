5|$|The white-winged fairywren mainly eats insects, supplementing {{this with}} small fruits and leaf buds. It occurs in {{heathland}} and arid scrubland, where low shrubs provide cover. Like other fairywrens, it is a cooperative breeding species, and {{small groups of}} birds maintain and defend territories year-round. Groups consist of a socially monogamous pair with several helper birds who assist in raising the young. These helpers are progeny that <b>have</b> <b>attained</b> sexual maturity but remain with the family group for one or more years after fledging. Although not yet confirmed genetically, the white-winged fairywren may be promiscuous and assist in raising the young from other pairings. As part of a courtship display, the male wren plucks petals from flowers and displays them to female birds.|$|E
