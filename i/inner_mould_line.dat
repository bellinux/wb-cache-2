40|$|Abstract. Traditional tire {{vulcanization}} {{technology has}} notable drawbacks,for example,the heat transfer is uneven and uniformity of a tire is low. A {{new type of}} <b>inner</b> <b>mould</b> direct-pressure tire vulcanization technology is introduced. The new technology method can solve probloms in traditional tire vulcanization by utilizing the building drum to replace the curing bladder of the central mechanism and using electromagnetic-induction heating method to heat green tire cavity. This paper mainly illustrates the development process of the <b>inner</b> <b>mould</b> direct-pressure tire vulcanization technology equipment based on the current tire shaping press vulcanizer...|$|R
50|$|Instead {{of using}} a steel mantle and cement, both the <b>inner</b> and outer <b>moulds</b> can also be made {{completely}} out of loam. In that case, the moulds are usually constructed inside out - first the <b>inner</b> <b>mould</b> {{on top of a}} coke, stone or brick core, then the false bell including wax decorations as above and finally the outer mould with added iron ring and fiber (e.g. hemp) reinforcements. Separating agents are used to prevent the false bell from sticking too closely to both of the moulds. Finally, after lifting up the outer mould, the false bell can be destroyed and the outer mould lowered back down onto the <b>inner</b> <b>mould,</b> ready for casting.|$|R
50|$|Mouldmaking. A mould {{is made of}} the {{original}} model or sculpture. The rigid outer moulds contain the softer <b>inner</b> <b>mould,</b> which is the exact negative of {{the original}} model. <b>Inner</b> <b>moulds</b> are usually made of latex, polyurethane rubber or silicone, which {{is supported by the}} outer mould. The outer mould can be made from plaster, but can also be made of fiberglass or other materials. Most moulds are made of at least two pieces, and a shim with keys is placed between the parts during construction so that the mould can be put back together accurately. If there are long, thin pieces extending out of the model, they are often cut off of the original and moulded separately. Sometimes many moulds are needed to recreate the original model, especially for large models.|$|R

40|$|In current casting {{technology}} of cored, thin walled castings, the modifying coating is applied {{on the surface}} of wax pattern and, after the removal of the wax, is transferred to <b>inner</b> <b>mould</b> surface. This way the modification leading to grain refinement occur {{on the surface of}} the casting. In thin walled castings the modification effect can also be seen on the other (external) side of the casting. Proper reproduction of details in thin walled castings require high pouring temperature which intensify the chemical reactions on the mould – molten metal interface. This may lead to degradation of the surface of the castings. The core modification process is thought to circumvent this problem. The modifying coating is applied to the surface of the core. The degradation of internal surface of the casting is less relevant. The most important factor in this technology is “trough” modification – obtaining fine grained structure on the surface opposite to the surface reproduced by the core...|$|R

40|$|The oolitic {{ironstone}} level {{occurring at}} the Callovian-Oxfordian boundary across wide {{areas in the}} central Iberian Range (Eastern Spain) is interpreted here as formed on an extended, very shallow to temporarily emerged, uniform carbonate platform. Main evidence to support this interpretation comes from both sedimentological analysis of facies and taphonomic analysis of the ammonites. The sedimentological analysis gives support {{to the idea of}} iron oolites being formed on, or in the surroundings of, emerged areas. On the other hand, the taphonomic analysis shows that some <b>inner</b> <b>moulds</b> of ammonites from this level display evidence of taphonomic reworking, such as the presence of ellipsoidal abrasion facets on the final part of the last preserved whorl, or annular abrasion furrows carved on the external region.

50|$|The 1998 {{redesign}} of the KV6 by Rover Group under BMW included replacing the original metal inlet-manifolds and butterfly valves, with plastic units manufactured in Germany. The redesign also involved replacing the metal thermostat housing {{with a plastic}} unit. A costly but uncommon side-effect to using plastic components are breakages in the VIS (Variable Inlet System) butterfly valves that are mounted inside the non-serviceable inlet manifold. The second common fault is failure of the thermostat housing (often failing along the <b>mould</b> <b>line),</b> {{that will lead to}} gradual but rarely complete loss of coolant. A third common fault is oil contamination in the VIS motors that are mounted {{on the sides of the}} inlet manifold and control air intake.

50|$|CD {{moulding}} {{machines are}} specifically designed high temperature polycarbonate injection moulders. They have an average throughput of 550-900 discs per hour, per <b>moulding</b> <b>line.</b> Clear polycarbonate pellets are first dried at around 130 degrees Celsius for three hours (nominal; this depends on which optical grade resin is in use) and are fed via vacuum transport into {{one end of the}} injection moulder's barrel (i.e., the feed throat) and are moved to the injection chamber via a large screw inside the barrel. The barrel, wrapped with heater bands ranging in temperature from ca 210 to 320 degrees Celsius melts the polycarbonate. When the mould is closed the screw moves forward to inject molten plastic into the mould cavity. When the mould is full, cool water running through mould halves, outside the cavity, cools the plastic so it somewhat solidifies. The entire process from the mould closing, injection and opening again takes approximately 3 to 5 seconds.|$|R
40|$|Adhesively bonded scarf repairs are the {{preferred}} method for repairing composite structures, limited mainly {{by the amount}} of material removal associated with scarfing. In addition to the high strength restoration, scarf repairs also enable recovery of the original external surface as required by aerodynamic and/or external <b>mould</b> <b>line</b> considerations. However, scarf repairs almost inevitably result in the removal of undamaged material {{to make way for the}} scarf insert. This can be a particularly significant issue for thick structures, because the scarf length can vary between 20 and 100 times the thicknesses of the parent structure. In this investigation, an optimisation method has been developed for determining the optimum repair shapes for a given biaxial loading condition. The optimum scarf shape is determined by numerically solving the resulting non-linear differential equation governing the scarf angle. The optimum and near-optimum shapes are presented and discussed with respect to computational modelling using the finite element method...|$|R

5000|$|The iron lion {{was cast}} using a piece-moulding {{technique}} {{in a single}} mould. In this technique, which has also been used in ancient Chinese bronze-casting, a clay model of the sculpture is made {{and covered with a}} new layer of clay after drying. This outer layer of clay is then cut into pieces and removed before it dries completely. In the next step, material is taken off the surface of the inner clay model in order to provide room for pouring the iron between the outer and <b>inner</b> <b>mould.</b> Hence, [...] "seams" [...] visible on the cast do not represent boundaries between separate iron pieces, but are impressions of the seams between the pieces of the outer mould. Casting did proceed in several stages between which the iron already poured into the mould did cool down. As a result, fault lines were introduced into the cast at regular intervals which mark the filling height of the mould at successive casting stages. These fault lines were bridged by the craftsmen carrying out the cast with pieces of wrought iron which were plunged into the solidifying surface of the iron from the previous pour and then covered in the next pour. Traces of these bridging pegs {{as well as those of}} wrought iron spacers used to separate the outer mould from the core can still be found in the sculpture.|$|R
40|$|Fully Controlled Production Environment for Autoclave Injection Processes Ensuring a reproducible, high {{product quality}} {{is a major}} goal for all {{production}} scenarios. In case of the ribs for the LOCOMACHS Lean Assembly Wing Box, geometrical accuracy was {{as important as the}} laminate quality itself and therefore a variety of measures has been investigated to actively measure and tune all quality relevant production parameters. The process that has been chosen to produce the ribs is a combination of resin infusion and autoclave technology because this combination offers a wide bandwidth of process parameter variation. The rib design with one integrated rib foot and one integrated rib post has been offered a good combination of simplicity and degree of structural integration. Since the <b>mould</b> <b>line</b> is not critical from a CTE point of view it was possible to use a cost efficient aluminium male tooling which has been designed to produce two different ribs in one cycle. Flange angle of the rib foot and rib post have been designed to compensate “Spring-In” deformations in a formally defined production window. Process-induced distortions (PID) of the ribs have been predicted with a novel pheno-numerical simulation approach that has been introduced within the LOCOMACHS project. The methodology provides efficient PID predictions due to shell-element modeling and a significant reduction of corresponding simulation parameters. To ensure that all quality relevant production parameters are in the specified production window a network of ultrasonic sensors has been installed in a special pattern. A crucial advantage of the ultrasonic sensors is that they are installed on the accessible backside of the mould and do not affect the <b>mould</b> <b>line</b> side. By measuring and analyzing sound amplitudes and propagation times it was possible to monitor flow front propagation, laminate thickness and also the cure progress in the running process. To manipulate the process conditions {{on the basis of the}} gained information, the injection pressure of the two injection lines could be used to tune resin flow, the pressure difference between autoclave and injection system could be used to control laminate thickness and the temperature profile can be manipulated in function of the cure progress. The ability to compensate most of the typical production scatter problems is major step towards the formally defined target of reproducible, high product quality. Furthermore the overall process time is no longer restricted to predefined, highly conservative cure times since the degree of cure is directly measured...|$|R
50|$|After {{the outer}} steel mantle has been cleaned, {{it is again}} lowered over the outer bell model. The mantle and the outer bell mould are then lowered over the <b>inner</b> <b>mould</b> and the outer and inner {{sections}} are clamped together, leaving a space between them. The clamped mould is supported, by being buried in a casting pit which bears the weight of metal and allows even cooling. Ingots of either ready-made bronze or its component metals are melted in a melting furnace and heated until liquid at a temperature of approximately 1100 C. The liquid metal is then skimmed to remove impurities {{before the start of}} the casting process. When everything is ready, the molten bronze is transferred to the moulds using either ladles or a system of brick channels specially constructed in the casting pit, through which the hot metal can then flow from the melting furnace into the space between the two moulds. Holes in the top of the mantle ensure that gases are able to escape. If gas remained in the metal, the bell would be porous and susceptible to cracking. Porousness can also develop if the mould is damp, is not at the proper temperature, or if the metal, when poured, is not hot enough. The bell is allowed to cool for several days. Large bells can take over a week to cool completely. Small bells, those under 500 lb, can be removed from the moulding pit the following day.|$|R
40|$|International audienceThe {{exceptional}} {{record of}} well-preserved wood remains from the Middle Jurassic of Svalbard is studied from the taphonomic point of view. These remains were {{recovered from the}} Brentskardhaugen Bed, a conglomerate with phosphatic nodules, which constitutes {{the record of the}} eroded deposits corresponding to the Toarcian-Early Bathonian gap. The wood remains occur in the cores of these nodules. These wood fragments are preserved as phosphate (francolite) and as charcoals. The well preservation allows us to identify xenoxyloid cross-field pits and xenoxylean pitting on the radial wall of tracheid, characterizing the species Xenoxylon phyllocladoides. Phosphatic nodules originated as the result of early phosphate precipitation filling the inter-particle pore space of the sandy quartz sediment around the wood fragments (and other organic-rich nucleation centers) below the sediment-water interface. This phosphatization involved a sudden burial of the wood remains in the sea-bottom, the subsequent decay of the lignin, and a fast growth of carbonate fluorapatite forming phosphatic <b>inner</b> <b>moulds.</b> Fossil microbial biofilms induced the phosphatization. The dissolution/decay of the lignin is not possible in charcoal, and phosphatic casts did not develop in charcoalified parts. Some remains were not totally charred, with the lignin preserved only in reduced relicts that were later replaced by phosphate. The phosphate precipitation occurred in recurrent episodes during the Toarcian-Callovian as a result of distinct sea-level rises and the associated nutrification of the shelf. The phosphatic nodules were developed and reworked during the transgressive-regressive cycle of the Toarcian-Early Bathonian, as well as during the final transgression of the Late Bathonian-Earliest Callovian, which resulted in the Brentskardhaugen Be...|$|R

50|$|In making Cheddar (or {{many other}} hard cheeses) the curd is {{cut into small}} cubes and the {{temperature}} is raised to approximately.39 C to 'scald' the curd particles. Syneresis occurs and cheese whey is expressed from the particles. The Cheddar curds and whey are often transferred from the cheese vat to a cooling table which contains screens that allow the whey to drain, but which trap the curd. The curd is cut using long, blunt knives and 'blocked' (stacked, cut and turned) by the cheesemaker to promote the release of cheese whey in {{a process known as}} 'cheddaring'. During this process the acidity of the curd increases and when the cheesemaker is satisfied it has reached the required level, around 0.65%, the curd is milled into ribbon shaped pieces and salt is mixed into it to arrest acid development. The salted green cheese curd is put into cheese <b>moulds</b> <b>lined</b> with cheesecloths and pressed overnight to allow the curd particles to bind together. The pressed blocks of cheese are then removed from the cheese moulds and are either bound with muslin-like cloth, or waxed or vacuum packed in plastic bags to be stored for maturation. Vacuum packing removes oxygen and prevents mould (fungal) growth during maturation, which depending on the wanted final product may be a desirable characteristic or not.|$|R
