The main aim was to map and specify the pupils' knowledge and skills in 8 th and 9 th class {{in the area of}} marriage and parenthood in Czech and Slovak Republic and to map their teachers' knowledge and attitudes in the same area of education. The another aim was {{to find out if the}} state, where pupils live, their age, gender and their family background can have the influence to their answers. We also find out, if there is any differences between teachers' answers from different states. Our thesis consists of four chapters. In first we allocated elementary characteristics of terms mental <b>handicap,</b> <b>mental</b> retardation, pupil with mild mental handicap and it's unbringing and education in Czech and Slovak republic. In second chapter we introduced basic characteristics of terms sex, sex of pupils with mild mental handicap and the history of sex education.

The main objective {{of this study was}} to examine the potential role of calcineurin in idiopathic <b>mental</b> <b>handicap.</b> Calcineurin levels were estimated in 20 children in the age group of 5 - 16 years with idiopathic <b>mental</b> <b>handicap</b> attending the Special Education Centre for the Mentally Handicapped in Hyderabad. The results of the present study showed decreased activity of serum calcineurin in children with idiopathic <b>mental</b> <b>handicap</b> compared to those of normal subjects in the same age group. The observations thus suggest impaired calcineurin activity in children with <b>mental</b> <b>handicap.</b> Calcineurin that is involved in biosynthesis and release of neurotransmitters at the synaptic terminal brain is affected thereby causing brain damage and leading to <b>mental</b> <b>handicap.</b> Impaired calcineurin activity was already indicated in many human diseases such as Down’s syndrome, Alzheimers, Brain ischemia, cardiac hypertrophy etc. It is therefore necessary to check the calcineurin levels in children with <b>mental</b> <b>handicap</b> to understand the role of calcineurin in the causation of <b>Mental</b> <b>handicap...</b>|$|R

40|$|Qualitative {{research}} {{is based on}} longitudinal studies relying on the essential values of the humanist psychology and more precisely the person-centered approach (PCA). The fieldwork of this thesis is carried out with mentally disabled children. The concept of person takes a crucial place in our working plan which focuses on the subjective experience of children and their mental health. In order to operationalize the PCA, we chose to work with two tools, i. e. the "Three Trees" test (TTT) and the "Notebook of the Tree". Afterwards, we analyzed the positive impact of the psychological mechanisms implied in these tests. The child's resources are indeed mobilized thanks to them, and this mobilization consequently reduces personality disorders (and can even suppress them) and increases the activation of the cognitive processes. The psychological accompaniment that we used in our work promotes a theory which respects and acknowledges the subject. It also makes the person respectable and recognizes {{his or her ability}} to change. La recherche qualitative repose sur une étude longitudinale portée par les valeurs fondamentales de la psychologie humaniste et plus précisément, celles de l'approche centrée sur la personne (l'ACP). L'expérience du terrain s'effectue auprès d'enfants en situation de <b>handicap</b> <b>mental.</b> Le concept de personne prend une place prépondérante dans le dispositif axé sur l'expérience subjective de l'enfant et sur sa santé mentale. Afin d'opérationnaliser l'ACP, nous utilisons deux outils : l'épreuve des trois arbres (l'ETA) et le cahier de l'arbre, nous analyserons l'impact positif des mécanismes psychologiques sollicités qui mobilisent les ressources de l'enfant facilitant ainsi, une diminution de certains troubles de la personnalité (voire leur suppression) et l'activation des processus cognitifs.

40|$|The {{clinical}} experience concerning the mentally handicapped {{child is a}} very complex one. The defences that the families, and in particular the mothers, set up in order to cope with the suffering created by the handicap make the transferential relationships really hard to establish. The principal observations highlight clinical facts that appear with a certain frequency in most of the families: the omnipresence of the mother concerning the child’s care and the symbolic father’s disappearance in the family system. The lack of the paternal third-party, who is supposed to symbolize the oedipal metaphor, generates an ambivalent attitude of the mother which leads to a situation where the child becomes an enjoyment object such as the idol for the pervert. Without otherness, without a third-party, dealing with the diagnosis is frequently impossible and leads to a denial of the handicap along with a speech tinged with persecution and rivalry between the different persons being part of the child’s and the mother’s environment. Like the only child who, on the occasion of a baby brother’s birth, can psycho-affectively regress (i. e. : he was house-trained until the baby brother’s was born), the mother, subsequently to the trauma created by the announcement of the diagnosis, would know a psychic regression caused by the collapse of the ideal, collapse which is induced by giving birth to a handicapped child. This thesis intends to demonstrate that these attitudes are, according to us, the result of a mostly superego’s distress. The approach we chose for this work is the superego’s perspective because we believe that there is no {{clinical experience}} that better illustrates this notion of criticism, censorship and judgment to decide between normal and pathologic than the one of the handicapped child. We assumed hypothetically that after the announcement of the handicap, the mother, normally pacified by the oedipal paternal superego (the superego as it was conceived by S. Freud), would all of a sudden find herself in a pre-oedipal superego’s position (the superego as it was conceived by J. Lacan and M. Klein). Through a conceptual study of the superego and the interlinking with the feminine, we suggest, by means of this thesis, to connect the clinical experience and the theory. Several clinical case vignettes will support our assumptions and, in fine, we will describe our therapeutic clinical approach which aims at re-introducing the symbolic paternal third-party and help the mother take the reverse course. La clinique de l'enfant en situation de handicap est une clinique très complexe. Les défenses psychiques mises en place par les familles et plus particulièrement par les mères pour faire face à la souffrance engendrée par le handicap rendent les relations transférentielles très difficiles à mettre en place. Les principales observations mettent en évidence des faits cliniques qui apparaissent avec une certaine fréquence dans la plupart des familles : omniprésence de la mère autour de la prise en charge de l'enfant et disparition du père symbolique du dispositif familial. L'absence de tiers paternel quiest sensé symboliser la métaphore oedipienne, entraîne une attitude de la mère ambivalente à la suite de laquelle l'enfant devient une sorte d'objet de jouissance à l'instar du fétiche pour le pervers. Sans altérité, sans tiers, faire le deuil du diagnostic devient bien souvent impossible et cela entraîne souvent un déni du handicap accompagné de l'apparition d'un discours teinté de persécution et d'une rivalité entre les différentes personnes qui gravitent autour de l'enfant et les mères. À l'instar de l'enfant unique qui, à la naissance d'un petit frère, peut régresser psycho-affectivement (ex : il était propre, il redevient sale) la mère à la suite du traumatisme engendré par l'annonce du handicap subirait une régression psychique causée par l’effondrement de l’idéal que l'enfant en situation <b>handicap</b> <b>mental</b> produit chez la mère. Cette thèse veut démontrer que ces attitudes sont, selon nous, le fruit d'un bouleversement principalement surmoïque. Nous avons voulu aborder cette thèse sous l'angle du Surmoi car nous pensons qu'aucune clinique comme celle de l'enfant en situation de handicap ne nous confronte autant à cette notion de critique, censure et jugement pour départager le normal du pathologique. Nous avons émis l’hypothèse que suite à l'annonce du handicap, la mère normalement pacifiée par le Surmoi paternel oedipien (le Surmoi Freudien), basculerait dans un positionnement surmoïque pré-oedipien (le Surmoi Lacanien etKleinien). À travers une étude du concept de Surmoi et la mise en lien avec le féminin nous nous proposons, par le biais de cette thèse, de faire des liens entre la clinique et la théorie. Plusieurs vignettes cliniques viendront étayer nos propos et in fine, nous décrirons notre démarche clinique thérapeutique qui vise à la ré-introduction du tiers paternel symbolique et de permettre à la mère de faire le chemin inverse...|$|E

In the thesis, I have tried to compare the outcomes of their work with the outcomes of their mates with no special needs. The outcomes have been evaluated through the Mathematics curriculum. The theoretical part of the thesis deals with the presentation of the children with a slight form of <b>mental</b> <b>handicap</b> who are given some extra professional help during their stay at the pre-school special needs programme. I was particularly interested in the temporal and spatial adaptations as well as the adaptations of activities that these children are involved into.

Additionally, the results achieved by the child with the slight form of <b>mental</b> <b>handicap</b> have been analyzed separately and compared with the results of his mates with no special needs.

40|$|Recently {{professionals}} and service planners {{have become increasingly}} aware {{of the consequences of}} stigma and of limited social experience for the self-concepts of people with a <b>mental</b> <b>handicap.</b> These issues have been central to the debate concerning the mainstreaming of children with special needs in ordinary schools and have become of major importance for those promoting the social integration of people with a <b>mental</b> <b>handicap.</b> However, there is little understanding {{of the relationship between the}} person's experience of stigma and his or her self-concept. Researchers have studied the self-concepts of people with a <b>mental</b> <b>handicap</b> using normative or standardised tests which produce quantitative scores. I argue that such studies provide little insight into 'handicapped' treatment and the participants' views of themselves. In contrast to these studies, the present research has followed the work of Edgerton (1967), who used intensive methods to study the relationship between the self-concepts of adult people with a <b>mental</b> <b>handicap</b> and their social circumstances. Three groups of adult people with a mild <b>mental</b> <b>handicap</b> took part in this research. The first group lived in their family home, the second group moved from their family home to liye more independently, and the third group came from a long-stay hospital. The instruments used in the research were open-ended interviews. In total 48 participants with a mild <b>mental</b> <b>handicap</b> were interviewed, and where possible, their mothers and staff were also involved. The interviews concerned the participants' experience of stigma and their views of themselves in relation to handicap and stigma. A longitudinal investigation with a sub-sample of the participants was also carried out to explore their pattern of social lives and networks. It was found that participants led socially rather segregated lives, had considerable experience of stigma and were often regarded by significant others in their lives as 'handicapped' as persons. Despite this, most of the participants in each of the three groups rejected a 'handicapped' identity. These findings are discussed with reference to several social theories of the self and previous research.
