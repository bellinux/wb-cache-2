5|$|Harvey {{also noted}} that the <b>fatwa</b> covered a wide range of Islamic {{religious}} duties, while usually a responsum <b>fatwa</b> only addresses a specific enquiry on a difficult point of detail. The <b>fatwa</b> also went into specific practical challenges faced by Muslims in Spain, such as the pressure to curse Muhammad, eat pork, drink wine, and intermarry with the Christians. This suggests that the author had some knowledge of what life under Christian rule was like.|$|E
5|$|The Oran <b>fatwa</b> was a responsum <b>fatwa,</b> or an Islamic legal opinion, {{issued in}} 1504 {{to address the}} crisis that {{occurred}} when Muslims in the Crown of Castile (now part of Spain) were forced to convert to Christianity in 15001502. The <b>fatwa</b> sets out detailed relaxations of the sharia (Islamic law) requirements, allowing the Muslims to conform outwardly to Christianity and perform acts that are ordinarily forbidden in Islamic law, when necessary to survive. It includes relaxed instructions for fulfilling the ritual prayers, the ritual charity, and the ritual ablution, and recommendations when obliged to violate Islamic law, such as worshipping as Christians, committing blasphemy, and consuming pork and wine.|$|E
5|$|The {{opening of}} the <b>fatwa</b> {{displayed}} sympathy to the Muslims of Spain, who kept their religious faith despite the suffering and risk that this posed them.

5|$|The <b>fatwa</b> {{appeared}} to enjoy wide currency within the Muslim and Morisco community in various kingdoms of Spain, {{for it was}} translated and copied as late as 1563 and 1609. The full geographical reach of the text is unknown, but it {{appeared to}} be originally addressed to the Muslims (or Moriscos) of Castile as a response to their forced conversions in 1500–1502. After the forced conversion was extended to the Crown of Aragon in the 1520s, the <b>fatwa</b> likely circulated there, too.|$|E

The primary difference between common-law opinions and <b>fatwās,</b> however, is that <b>fatwās</b> are not universally binding; as Sharia is not universally consistent and Islam is very non-hierarchical in structure, <b>fatwās</b> do not carry the sort of weight as that of secular common-law opinion.|$|R

5|$|The <b>fatwa</b> {{reaffirmed the}} {{obligation}} of Spanish Muslims to perform the ritual prayers (salat), the ritual charity (zakat), and the ritual ablution (ghusl), {{even if they could}} not be performed in the correct form. It described {{the obligation of}} the ritual prayersnormally performed by standing, bowing, prostrating, and sitting in a prescribed sequenceeven if done only by making slight movements. The <b>fatwa</b> also allowed the omission of the prayersnormally performed an obligatory five times a day at prescribed timeswhen they were prevented from doing so, and instructed them to make up the missed prayers at night instead. It also provided instructions for performing the ritual dry ablution (tayammum) when ritually pure water was not available, to replace the ritual ablution (wudu) that is ordinarily required before performing the salat. When tayammum was not possible, even making slight pointing motions with hands or face toward clean earth, stone, or tree was acceptable.|$|E

The <b>fatwas</b> under the discussion are those issued by Nahdlatul Ulama (NU) and Majelis Ulama Indonesia (MUI) in post-Independence Indonesia. Those <b>fatwas</b> are of special significance, both in terms of Islamic legal discourses and -perhaps more importantly- Muslims' perceptions and attitudes towards other religious communities in Indonesia. Issued by authoritative bodies of Indonesian Islam, more in particular the NU, the <b>fatwas</b> could be said as presenting the voices of Indonesian Muslims in their encounters with the issues of religious tolerance and plurality.

5|$|According to Shia scholar Mohammad Jafar Tabasi, {{the graves}} of Shia Imams buried in al-Baqi had been revered and since {{hundreds}} of years ago and none of the Sunni scholars ulamas regarded the shrines as innovation.

5|$|Darwaza was {{convinced}} that interpretations of the Quran were the only possible basis for any renewal and development of Islamic religious, political and social thought, and that the Quran was the only resource for Muslim reinterpretation of traditional norms in Islam and Islamic thinking. Since it was quite uncommon to follow a chronological order for a whole tafsir—which Darwaza did—he had to justify his position by seeking a <b>fatwa</b> from the muftis of Aleppo and Damascus.|$|E

40|$|From a {{historical}} perspective, {{one of the}} primary reasons for issuing Islamic religious edicts, commonly known as <b>fatwas,</b> was to incite terrorism, and many have been successful in achieving their aims. In response, <b>fatwas</b> that challenge terrorism and counter terrorist organization actions have also been issued, however, they have been rarely followed. The literature and discourse on the subject are sparse and problematic, and have provided unconvincing explanations; devoid of a systematic approach to the question, they do not provide the context necessary to understand why counter-terror <b>fatwas</b> have been ineffective against Islamist terrorism, and none investigated whether the <b>fatwas</b> interacted directly with the Islamist core narrative. In this thesis, I argue that counter-terror <b>fatwas</b> have been ineffective because they have not discussed or challenged the Qur’anic verses that endorse violence and justify Islamist terrorism, and they received no digital news coverage. Using a systematic approach, I employ a four-way typology to measure these two variables—content sophistication and online news coverage—to provide an answer to the thesis question, and I use supplementary interviews to support and explain these findings. As addressed in my thesis, most counter-terror <b>fatwas</b> did not challenge or target the Qur’anic verses that specifically condone violence, yet they all received digital media coverage. The most plausible interview data suggests that, unlike a conservative line of reasoning, a moderate one is required to challenge the Qur’anic verses, but such a line of reasoning may not be appreciated by the public. Overall, I use my findings to suggest that, when given specific modifications, counter-terror <b>fatwas</b> can become much more effective in deterring Islamist terrorism, especially when paired with other counter-narrative initiatives...|$|R
