5|$|I {{was just}} trying to make a point. I wanted to show people {{how easy it is to}} {{manipulate}} someone's voice. If I can do it with a clip I pulled off of TV, imagine what they are doing on records and during live performances. The entire industry has been so manipulated, because there's such an emphasis on perfection, so when something like this happens, it causes such a stir. I knew something had to have happened to make it jump so fast. It's wild how much the story's been twisted. It's just always been fun for me to manipulate artists, and make it sound crazy. It was just for a good laugh. It was a goof, just for fun. <b>I</b> <b>do</b> <b>a</b> <b>lot</b> of parodies on my YouTube channel, and it just so happens this one got a little out of hand. It was just what I've learned in school, and it's fun I could fool so many people and get away with it. A lot of people had a lot of laughs because of it, so why should I apologize? If you can't poke fun at yourself, I don't know what kind of person you are.|$|E
500|$|Nolan has {{described}} his filmmaking {{process as a}} combination of intuition and geometry. [...] "I draw a lot of diagrams when I work. <b>I</b> <b>do</b> <b>a</b> <b>lot</b> of thinking about etchings by Escher, for instance. That frees me, finding a mathematical model or a scientific model. I'll draw pictures and diagrams that illustrate the movement or the rhythm that I'm after." [...] Caltech physicist and Nobel Laureate Kip Thorne compared Nolan's [...] "deep" [...] intuition to scientists such as Albert Einstein, noting that the director intuitively grasped things non-scientists rarely understand. Upon his own decision-making {{of whether or not}} to start work on a project, the filmmaker has proclaimed a belief in the sincerity of his passion for something within the particular project in question as a basis for his selective thought.|$|E
500|$|Disney's {{public persona}} was very {{different}} from his actual personality. Playwright Robert E. Sherwood described him as [...] "almost painfully shy... diffident" [...] and self-deprecating. According to his biographer Richard Schickel, Disney hid his shy and insecure personality behind his public identity. Kimball argues that Disney [...] "played the role of a bashful tycoon who was embarrassed in public" [...] and knew that he was doing so. Disney acknowledged the façade, and told a friend that [...] "I'm not Walt Disney. <b>I</b> <b>do</b> <b>a</b> <b>lot</b> of things Walt Disney would not do. Walt Disney does not smoke. I smoke. Walt Disney does not drink. I drink." [...] Critic Otis Ferguson, in The New Republic, called the private Disney: [...] "common and everyday, not inaccessible, not in a foreign language, not suppressed or sponsored or anything. Just Disney." [...] Many of those with whom Disney worked commented that he gave his staff little encouragement due to his exceptionally high expectations. Norman recalls that when Disney said [...] "That'll work", it was an indication of high praise. Instead of direct approval, Disney gave high-performing staff financial bonuses, or recommended certain individuals to others, expecting that his praise would be passed on.|$|E
2500|$|For years, {{the black}} {{community}} had complained that the situation was unfair. Parks said, [...] "My resisting being mistreated on the bus did not begin with that particular arrest. <b>I</b> <b>did</b> <b>a</b> <b>lot</b> of walking in Montgomery." ...|$|R

5000|$|Cattrall later recalled, [...] "There's {{no way to}} play a {{mannequin}} except {{if you want to}} sit there as <b>a</b> dummy... <b>I</b> <b>did</b> <b>a</b> <b>lot</b> of body-building because I wanted to be as streamlined as possible. I wanted to match the mannequins as closely as I could." ...|$|R
2500|$|Mahal leads {{with his}} thumb and middle finger when fingerpicking, rather than with his index finger as the {{majority}} of guitar players do. [...] "I play with a flatpick," [...] he says, [...] "when <b>I</b> <b>do</b> <b>a</b> <b>lot</b> of blues leads." [...] Early in his musical career Mahal studied the various styles of his favorite blues singers, including musicians like Jimmy Reed, Son House, Sleepy John Estes, Big Mama Thornton, Howlin' Wolf, Mississippi John Hurt, and Sonny Terry. He describes his hanging out at clubs like Club 47 in Massachusetts and Ash Grove in Los Angeles as [...] "basic building blocks {{in the development of}} his music." [...] Considered to be a scholar of blues music, his studies of ethnomusicology at the University of Massachusetts Amherst would come to introduce him further to the folk music of the Caribbean and West Africa. Over time he incorporated more and more African roots music into his musical palette, embracing elements of reggae, calypso, jazz, zydeco, R, gospel music, and the country blues—each of which having [...] "served as the foundation of his unique sound." [...] According to The Rough Guide to Rock, [...] "It has been said that Taj Mahal {{was one of the first}} major artists, if not the very first one, to pursue the possibilities of world music. Even the blues he was playing in the early 70s – Recycling The Blues & Other Related Stuff (1972), Mo' Roots (1974) – showed an aptitude for spicing the mix with flavours that always kept him a yard or so distant from being an out-and-out blues performer." [...] Concerning his voice, author David Evans writes that Mahal has [...] "an extraordinary voice that ranges from gruff and gritty to smooth and sultry." ...|$|E
6000|$|Killy laughed. It was {{a shrill}} laugh. [...] "I should say not," [...] said he. [...] "I eat spiders and worms {{and all sorts}} of insects big enough to give a fellow a decent bite. But for real good eating give me a fat Meadow Mouse. I don't object to a Sparrow or some other small bird now and then, {{especially}} when I have a family of hungry youngsters to feed. But take it the season through, I live mostly on grasshoppers and insects and Meadow Mice. <b>I</b> <b>do</b> <b>a</b> <b>lot</b> of good in this world, I'd have you know." ...|$|E
5000|$|Rezaï {{told the}} Islamic Republic of Iran Broadcasting that she {{supported}} Iranian President Mahmoud Ahmadinejad. When the reporter asked her [...] "Do you like Mr. Ahmadinejad?"

2500|$|Haddon added, in the {{conversation}} with Terry Gross, [...] "I have to say honestly that <b>I</b> <b>did</b> more research about the London Underground and the inside of Swindon Railway Station, {{where some of the}} novel takes place, than <b>I</b> <b>did</b> about Asperger's syndrome. I gave him kind of nine or 10 rules that he would live his life by, and then I didn't read any more about Asperger's because I think there is no typical person who has Asperger's syndrome, and they're as large and diverse a group of people as any other group in society. And {{the important thing is that}} <b>I</b> <b>did</b> <b>a</b> <b>lot</b> of imagining, that <b>I</b> <b>did</b> <b>a</b> <b>lot</b> of putting myself into his shoes in trying to make him come alive as a human being rather than getting him right, whatever that might mean." ...|$|R

In the September 2008 issue of Fashion Magazine she {{was quoted as}} saying: [...] "Ive {{had a lot of}} mixed feelings about what <b>I</b> <b>do</b> ... <b>A</b> <b>lot</b> of the time, I feel like Im part of the problem when it comes to all the superficiality and vanity that impacts the way girls grow up".|$|E
5000|$|Wright {{has become}} a popular figure in the Fresno {{community}} and {{was inducted into the}} Fresno County Athletic Hall of Fame in 2008.

5000|$|When {{asked about}} the title for the record, Lopez also {{said that she would}} wait [...] "until the last minute" [...] to decide. Finally, on April 29, 2014, Lopez {{revealed}} that she was considering two titles for the album, Same Girl and AKA. Speaking of the titles, she said [...] "I feel like I've been given so many monikers, and <b>I</b> <b>do</b> <b>a</b> <b>lot</b> of different things."

5000|$|After the 1935 season, Newman {{credited}} his disappointing {{performance in}} 1935 to skating: [...] "Skating {{is the best}} thing I know of to develop hip-swinging, judgment of distance, suppleness, dexterity, pivot and angle terms. I was off form in 1935 and the main reason was because <b>I</b> <b>did</b> no skating last winter. <b>I</b> <b>did</b> <b>a</b> <b>lot</b> in 1932-33 and followed it up with a great season on the gridiron." ...|$|R

5000|$|The {{album was}} {{recorded}} at The Jazz Workshop in San Francisco before an appreciative standing room only crowd. The album broke new ground as a live recording taped in noisy club environments, creating a formula {{which not only}} the Cannonball Quintet but other jazz ensembles would follow. Producer Keepnews reflected that it [...] "was such a phenomenal success {{that not only did}} <b>I</b> <b>do</b> <b>a</b> <b>lot</b> of such recordings afterwards, but I think that virtually all jazz producers felt {{that it was a good}} thing to do". Also unusual for the time was Keepnews' decision to retain Adderley's comments to the crowd.|$|E

5000|$|With {{her career}} winding down, Zurich {{maintained}} {{that she made}} the right choice coming to Rutgers. She may have played more minutes elsewhere (she averaged 22 minutes over her career), but she wouldn't have enjoyed the same amount of success.

5000|$|Receiving a {{nomination}} for Best Recording Package at the 2017 Grammy Awards, the album's artwork is by co-lead vocalist and guitarist A. Savage. Regarding its cover art, Savage noted: [...] "I painted {{that in my}} own separate state of mind. <b>I</b> <b>do</b> <b>a</b> <b>lot</b> of artwork {{that has nothing to}} do with Parquet Courts, but it was around the same time that I started working on the Human Performance art, and it kind of just started screaming at me from the corner. It became apparent that it needed to be included, because so many of the same emotions were embedded within that painting were also within the lyrics of the record." ...|$|E
