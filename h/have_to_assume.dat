As per the rule, in the 13th year, Pandavas and their wife Draupadi <b>have</b> <b>to</b> <b>assume</b> different identities and live incognito until the upcoming Vijayadashami. In case their real identity is unveiled, they have to repeat their 12-year exile again. That would give a chance to the Kauravas to prohibit Pandavas from attacking and gaining the reigns of the Kuru Kingdom for a longer period, and possibly forever. Pandavas choose the Matsya Kingdom ruled by Virata, a kind hearted but weak spirited king. They hope to find employment in the king's palace.|$|E
25|$|At a time—the late 1920s and '30s—when rising Nazi leader Adolf Hitler {{was using}} {{propaganda}} to spread his virulently anti-Jewish philosophy, Ross {{was seen by}} American Jews {{as one of their}} greatest advocates. He represented the concept of Jews finally fighting back. Idolized and respected by all Americans, Ross showed that Jews could thrive in their new country. He made his stand against Hitler and Nazi Germany a public one. He knew that by winning boxing matches, he was displaying a new kind of strength for Jews. He also understood that Americans loved their sports heroes and if Jews wanted to be embraced in the U.S. they would <b>have</b> <b>to</b> <b>assume</b> such places in society. Though Ross had lost faith in religion, he openly embraced his role as a leader of his people.|$|E
500|$|Evans was {{promoted}} to group captain in January 1969 and appointed Director of Air Force Plans. In this position he proposed and organised the gift of 23 of the RAAF's old CAC Sabres to the Indonesian Air Force, following an earlier presentation of 10Sabres to the Royal Malaysian Air Force. He completed studies at the Royal College of Defence Studies, London, in 1972. [...] Returning to Australia, he {{was promoted}} to air commodore and appointed Director-General Plans and Policy, Air Force, in January 1973. He served as Officer Commanding RAAF Base Amberley from February 1975 until April 1977. In this role he qualified as a pilot on the recently delivered F-111C swing-wing bomber, as well as the UH-1 Iroquois helicopter. Following his tour as Amberley base commander, Evans {{was promoted to}} air vice marshal and became Chief of Air Force Operations (CAFOPS). He held this newly created position for the next two years, broken by a temporary posting as Deputy Chief of the Air Staff between January and August 1978. As CAFOPS, Evans played a major part in developing the RAAF's plans for the defence of Australia. Following America's announcement in the 1969 Guam Doctrine that its allies would <b>have</b> <b>to</b> <b>assume</b> greater self-reliance in their military affairs, Australia's strategic thought underwent a change from its earlier policy of [...] "forward defence" [...] to a more localised defensive posture. While the consensus among RAAF planning staff was to adopt a [...] "repulsion" [...] concept of attacking an enemy force along the air and sea approaches to northern Australia, Evans considered that this did not go far enough in exploiting the long-range offensive capabilities of such aircraft as the F-111. Convinced that Australia's numerically small forces would be hard-pressed to dislodge an invader that had gained a foothold on the continent, he refined the [...] "repulsion" [...] stance into what he termed an [...] "anti-lodgement" [...] strategy, focussing on defeating the enemy at its potential staging bases north of Australia and then, as a last resort, on the approaches closer to home. The Air Force's role in shaping an overall strategy that took advantage of the [...] "air-sea gap" [...] was later acknowledged in the Federal government paper The Defence of Australia 1987. Evans was appointed an Officer of the Order of Australia on 26January 1981 for his achievements as CAFOPS.|$|E

I will, therefore detain the reader while I point out one of the absurd consequences flowing from the supposition that definitions, as such, are the premises in any of our reasonings, except such as relate to words only. If this supposition were true, we might argue correctly from true premises, and arrive at a false conclusion.

60|$|The {{theory of}} warning colours is an {{excellent}} one, {{but it has been}} pushed too far.

Raptorial insects, as I have said, feed freely on fireflies, so that the supposed warning is not for them, and it would be hard to believe that the magnificent display made by luminous insects is useful only in preventing accidental injuries to them from a few crepuscular bats and goatsuckers. And to believe even this we should first <b>have</b> <b>to</b> <b>assume</b> that bats and goatsuckers are differently constituted from all other creatures; for in other animals--insects, birds, and mammalians--the appearance of fire by night seems to confuse and frighten, but it certainly cannot be said to warn, in the sense in which that word is used when we speak of the brilliant colours of some butterflies, or even of the gestures of some venomous snakes, and of the sounds they emit.|$|E
