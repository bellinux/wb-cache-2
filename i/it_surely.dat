25|$|By 1936 he {{was almost}} entirely {{painting}} on wood such a flat application of oil paint that even artists {{asked him if he}} painted in tempera. He had painted on canvas but with the painting of his plant subjects he felt closer to the earth if he worked on wood. One medium that he used and was very skilled was painting in oil on rice pith. This is very thin, like tissue paper although not paper at all but rather the pith of the rice plant cut under water by the Japanese. So deft was his use of oil on this transparent, lighter than air substance that there were often accusations that <b>it</b> <b>surely</b> could not be done with oil. The Japanese frequently used tempera on rice pith so everyone assumed he was using it as well.|$|E

Pratt's son, Charles Millard Pratt, became Secretary of Standard Oil. For many of his competitors, Rockefeller had merely to show them his books so they could see what they were up against and make them a decent offer. If they refused his offer, he told them he would run them into bankruptcy and then cheaply buy up their assets at auction. But this was not intended to eliminate competition entirely. In fact, his partner Pratt said of that accusation [...] "Competitors we must have...if we absorb them, <b>it</b> <b>surely</b> will bring up another." ...|$|E
500|$|Provisionally {{known as}} the Thunderbolt, the Shelby {{prototype}} was more polished than the Miles version, and used a Ford 4-speed manual transmission. The Ford V8 was only 3.5 inches longer than the Alpine's 4-cylinder engine it replaced, so the primary concern was the engine's width. Like Miles, Shelby found that the Ford V8 would only just fit into the Alpine engine bay: [...] "I {{think that if the}} figure of speech about the shoehorn ever applied to anything, <b>it</b> <b>surely</b> did to the tight squeak in getting that 260 Ford mill into the Sunbeam engine compartment.

2500|$|To a {{reasonable}} mind the Divine attributes must appear, not diminished or reduced in some way, by supposing a creation by law, but infinitely exalted. It is the narrowest of all {{views of the}} Deity, and characteristic of a humble class of intellects, to suppose him acting constantly in particular ways for particular occasions. It, for one thing, greatly detracts from his foresight, the most undeniable of all the attributes of Omnipotence. It lowers him towards the level of our own humble intellects. Much more worthy of him <b>it</b> <b>surely</b> is, to suppose that all things have been commissioned by him from the first, though neither is he absent from a particle of the current of natural affairs in one sense, seeing that the whole system is continually supported by his providence.

2500|$|It {{is beyond}} {{question}} that Good News intends {{to use the}} public school premises not for the mere discussion of a subject from a particular, Christian point of view, but for an evangelical service of worship calling children to commit themselves {{in an act of}} Christian conversion. [...] The majority avoids this reality only by resorting to the bland and general characterization of Good News's activity as 'teaching of morals and character, from a religious standpoint'. [...] If the majority's statement ignores reality, as <b>it</b> <b>surely</b> does, then today's holding may be understood only in equally generic terms. [...] Otherwise, indeed, this case would stand for the remarkable proposition that any public school opened for civic meetings must be opened for use as a church, synagogue, or mosque. [...] Souter also disputed that it was proper for the Court to reach the Establishment Clause claim. [...] Neither the district court nor the Second Circuit had based their rulings on the Establishment Clause, because they had found no First Amendment violation stemming from Milford's actions. [...] Consequently, the facts relating to the Establishment Clause claim were not as well developed as they otherwise might have been. [...] Furthermore, Souter disagreed that this case was so similar to Widmar and Lamb's Chapel as the majority claimed. [...] Widmar involved a university student group, one of over a hundred on campus, that used university space for religious worship. [...] In that case, Souter pointed out, the risk of the university being seen as endorsing the worship was low in light of the number of student groups on campus and the level of maturity of the students. [...] The film in Lamb's Chapel was open to the general public and aimed at adults, not children, and the school facilities had been used by a wide variety of private organizations, just as there were a large number of student groups in Widmar. [...] The Good News Club, by contrast, began setting up its meetings almost half an hour before the school day ended and in a classroom adjacent to the third- and fourth-grade classroom, so that those students, at least, would see the Club every time it came to campus. [...] In view {{of the state of the}} recorde, the [...] "facts we know (or think we know) point away from the majority's conclusion, and while the consolation may be that nothing really gets resolved when the judicial process is so truncated, that is not much to recommend today's result." ...|$|E
