Our results suggest that spatial structure affects CO 2 emissions from private transport and PMs from housing emissions. There is no evidence for polycentricity to reduce emissions...|$|R

30|$|The {{weight balance}} and thermal {{analysis}} showed that the silver retention on kaolinite surface is driven by salt-catalyzed dehydroxylation phenomena. The XRD pattern of AgK specimen indicated that the silver present in AgK specimen does not occur as Ag metal or AgNO 3 molecule. The relatively high FWHM (Full Width Half Maximum) observed in the X-ray photon <b>emission</b> <b>survey</b> spectrum of AgK specimen suggested the existence {{of more than one}} silver oxide–AgO, and Ag 2 O in the specimen. As the photoemission is a surface phenomenon (approximate depth of penetration is 1 – 5  nm), it is inferred that the silver oxides in AgK apparently occur on kaolinite surface as silver oxide coatings. The electron probe micro analysis (EPMA) showed uniform distribution of silver on the surface of AgK specimen. The mass-balance calculations, XRD analysis, X-ray photon <b>emission</b> <b>survey</b> spectrum and EPMA tests with kaolinite–silver nitrate mix/AgK/Kaolinite specimen aided the formulation of chemical reaction for occurrence of uniform coatings of AgO/Ag 2 O on kaolinite surface of the AgK specimen.

30|$|Diffuse CO 2 <b>emission</b> <b>surveys</b> {{were carried}} out at São Vicente, Brava, and Fogo islands, Cape Verde, {{archipelago}} to investigate the relationship between diffuse CO 2 degassing and volcanic activity. Total amounts of diffuse CO 2 discharged through the surface environment of the islands of São Vicente, Brava, and Fogo were estimated in 226, 50, and 828  t d− 1, respectively. The highest CO 2 efflux values of the three volcanic islands systems were observed at the summit crater of Pico do Fogo (up to 15.7  kg m− 2 d− 1). Statistical graphical {{analysis of the data}} suggests two geochemical populations for the diffuse CO 2 <b>emission</b> <b>surveys.</b> The geometric mean of the peak population, expressed as a multiple of the geometric mean of the background population, seems to be the best diffuse CO 2 emission geochemical parameter to correlate with the volcanic activity (age of the volcanism) for these three island volcanic systems at Cape Verde. This observation is also supported by helium isotopic signature observed in the Cape Verde’s fluids, fumaroles, and ground waters. This study provides useful information about the relationship between diffuse CO 2 degassing and volcanic activity at Cape Verde enhancing the use of diffuse CO 2 emission as a good geochemical tool, for volcanic monitoring at Cape Verde as well as other similar volcanic systems.|$|R
40|$|Two {{optically}} accessible experimental {{test rigs}} were designed and constructed {{to investigate a}} staged or distributed combustion system for stationary gas turbine applications. The test rigs were fuelled with natural gas and featured two combustion zones: the main combustion zone (MCZ) and the secondary combustion zone (SCZ). The MCZ is a swirl stabilized dump combustor and the SCZ, which is axially downstream from the MCZ, is formed by a transverse jet injecting a premixed fuel/air mixture into the vitiated stream. After installing and commissioning the test rig, an <b>emission</b> <b>survey</b> was conducted to investigate the SCZ conditions, equivalence ratio and momentum ratio, that produce low NOx emissions and give a higher temperature rise before a simulated high pressure turbine than firing only the MCZ. The <b>emission</b> <b>survey</b> found several operating conditions that show the benefit of combustion staging. These beneficial conditions had an SCZ equivalence ratio between 0. 41 and 1. 12. The data from the <b>emission</b> <b>survey</b> was then used to create an artificial neural network (ANN). The ANN used a multi-layer feed-forward network architecture and was trained with experimental data using the backpropagation training algorithm. The ANN was then used to create performance maps and optimum operational regions were sought. Lastly, optical diagnostics were used to obtain information {{on the nature of}} the SCZ reactive jet. The diagnostics included high speed CH* chemiluminescence, OH planar laser induced fluorescence (PLIF) and dual-pump coherent anti-Stokes Raman scattering (CARS). The chemiluminescence and PLIF were used to qualitatively determine the size and shape of the transverse jet reaction zone. Dual-pump CARS was used to quantitatively determine the temperature and H 2 /N 2 concentration ratio profile at the mid-plane of the transverse jet. Dual-pump CARS data was collected for four operating conditions but only one is presented in this dissertation. For the condition presented, the temperature ranged from 1200 K to 2500 K, and regions with the highest temperature also corresponded to regions with the most temperature fluctuation, indicating the presence of a reactive shear layer. The concentration ratio of H 2 /N 2 ranged from 6. 4 ×- 3 to 4. 8 × 10 - 2. Regions of high temperature also correspond to high H 2 /N 2 concentration ratios indicating the location of the primary reaction zone. ...|$|E

The combustor was designed for a large augmented turbofan engine capable of sustained flight speeds up to Mach 3. 0.

At an overall combustor fuel/air ratio of 0. 007, fuel zoning reduced THC emissions by a factor of 5 to 1.
