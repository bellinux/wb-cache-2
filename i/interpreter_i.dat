40|$|Languages with programmer-visible stacks (stack-based languages) {{are used}} widely, as {{intermediate}} languages (e. g., JavaVM, FCode), and as languages for human programmers (e. g., Forth, PostScript). However, the prevalent computer architecture is the register machine. This poses {{the problem of}} efficiently implementing stack-based languages on register machines. A straight-forward implementation of the stack consists of a memory area that contains the stack items, and a pointer to the top-of-stack item. The basic optimizations explored in this thesis are: Caching the frequentlyaccessed top-of-stack items in registers reduces stack access overhead, and combining stack-pointer updates eliminates most of them. This thesis examines these optimizations {{in the context of}} three basic implementation techniques: [...] For (virtual machine) <b>interpreters,</b> <b>I</b> regard the stack cache in the registers as finite state machine, where the execution of a virtual machine instruction performs a state transition [...] ...|$|R
40|$|The {{interpretations of}} the Waterloo {{campaign}} are numerous, diverse and constantly reworked, so {{they are part of}} history no less than the event itself. This article briefly reviews them before considering more carefully two selected <b>interpreters,</b> <b>i.</b> e., Clausewitz and Stendhal. It likens the former to a rational choice theorist who makes a step away from intelligible narrative in the direction of modelling, and it represents the latter, who expresses himself through his character Fabrice, as a theoretically informed critique of the inert categories of the historical discourse. Despite their opposing trends towards unification and dissolution, both examples testify to general features, which the end of this essay tries to bring out, of the concepts of interpretation and plurality of interpretations.

60|$|All {{the company}} of Boers who stood around began to laugh also, uproariously, for this {{primitive}} joke appealed to them.

60|$|Our {{companion}} (Steerage No. 2 and 3) was a favourite resort. Down one {{flight of}} stairs there was a comparatively large open space, the centre occupied by a hatchway, which made a convenient seat for about twenty persons, while barrels, coils of rope, and the carpenter's bench afforded perches for perhaps as many more. The canteen, or steerage bar, was {{on one side of}} the stair; on the other a no less attractive spot, the cabin of the indefatigable <b>interpreter.</b> <b>I</b> have seen people packed into this space like herrings in a barrel, and many merry evenings prolonged there until five bells, when the lights were ruthlessly extinguished and all must go to roost.|$|E

He spoke in Italian, and we none of us understood him, but I gathered that he was declining to do anything further. The box, he was certain, had never come out of the steamer.

60|$|The {{boat had}} the double advantage, in {{navigating}} the Zuyder Zee, of being large, and of drawing very little water; the captain's cabin {{was at the}} stern; and {{the two or three}} men who formed his crew were berthed forward, in the bows. The whole middle of the boat, partitioned off on the one side and on the other from the captain and the crew, was assigned to me for my cabin. Under these circumstances, I had no reason to complain of want of space; the vessel measuring between fifty and sixty tons. I had a comfortable bed, a table, and chairs. The kitchen was well away from me, in the forward part of the boat. At my own request, I set forth on the voyage without servant or <b>interpreter.</b> <b>I</b> preferred being alone.

60|$|It will be {{observed}} that this clause gives the Minister of Education absolute {{power over the}} doings of the School Boards.

But I am led to believe that the Legislature has, in the present instance, deliberately taken this power {{out of the hands of}} the judges and lodged it in those of the Minister of Education, who, in accordance with our method of making Ministers, will necessarily be a political partisan, and who may be a strong theological sectary into the bargain. And I am informed by members of Parliament who watched the progress of the Act, that the responsibility for this unusual state of things rests, not with the Government, but with the Legislature, which exhibited a singular disposition to accumulate power in the hands of the future Minister of Education, and to evade the more troublesome difficulties of the education question by leaving them to be settled between that Minister and the School Boards.|$|E

40|$|The main {{objective}} {{of this study is}} to determine the impact of immigration interpreters on the testimony of Spanish-English bilingually conducted hearings in one U. S. immigration court. Specifically, I analyze the performance of nine immigration <b>interpreters.</b> <b>I</b> identify the precise linguistic strategies they employ when interpreting and, using conversational and other discourse analytical approaches, determine how they become active members of the proceedings. The immigration hearings I observed took place in one Federal immigration courtroom located in a large northeastern city. This research shows the extent to which interpreters play a pivotal role in controlling courtroom discourse—constructing courtroom reality and either mitigating or magnifying the culpability of defendants through a variety of linguistic mechanisms: a) inaccurate lexical choice, b) the use of source language rather than target language words and phrases, c) the use of definitions and calques, d) the improper addition or deletion of repair mechanisms and of hesitation forms such as pauses and fillers, and e) the addition of polite forms of address to convey solidarity, to adhere to Hispanic cultural norms, and to avoid face threatening acts. This study shows that the linguistic power interpreters wield exerts a coercive force, particularly on witnesses and defendants, and that such linguistic coerciveness on the part of interpreters influences other participants in the judicial proceeding. In this study, both judges and attorneys are shown to have been influenced by the lexical choices of <b>interpreters.</b> Finally, <b>I</b> show that the intrusiveness of interpreters changes the pragmatic force intended by the speakers, which constitutes a violation of the ethical standards set for interpreters in the United States by such authorities as the Federal Judicial Center...|$|R

6000|$|I went {{myself to}} visit the native village on the hill behind Dorey, and took with me a small present of cloth, knives, and beads, to secure the good-will of the chief, and get him to send some men to catch or shoot birds for me. The houses were {{scattered}} about among rudely cultivated clearings. Two which I visited consisted of a central passage, {{on each side of}} which opened short passages, admitting to two rooms, each of which was a house accommodating a separate family. They were elevated at least fifteen feet above the ground, on a complete forest of poles, and were so rude and dilapidated that some of the small passages had openings in the floor of loose sticks, through which a child might fall. The inhabitants seemed rather uglier than those at Dorey village. They are, no doubt, the true indigenes of this part of New Guinea, living in the interior, and subsisting by cultivation and hunting. The Dorey men, on the other hand, are shore-dwellers, fishers and traders in a small way, and have thus the character of a colony who have migrated from another district. These hillmen or [...] "Arfaks" [...] differed much in physical features. They were generally black, but some were brown like Malays. Their hair, though always more or less frizzly, was sometimes short and matted, instead of being long, loose, and woolly; and this seemed to be a constitutional difference, not the effect of care and cultivation. Nearly half of them were afflicted with the scurfy skin-disease. The old chief seemed much pleased with his present, and promised (through an <b>interpreter</b> <b>I</b> brought with me) to protect my men when they came there shooting, and also to procure me some birds and animals. While conversing, they smoked tobacco of their own growing, in pipes cut from a single piece of wood with a long upright handle.|$|E
60|$|After a {{while the}} Colonel called me in, and sent me {{speeding}} across the little river with a note to a certain Mr. Brady, whose house was not far away. Like many another citizen of Cahokia, Mr. Brady was terror-ridden. A party of young Puan bucks had decreed it to be their pleasure to encamp in Mr. Brady's yard, to peer through the shutters into Mr. Brady's house, to enjoy themselves by annoying Mr. Brady's family and others as much as possible. During the Indian occupation of Cahokia this band had gained a well-deserved reputation for mischief; and chief among them was the North Wind himself, whom I had done the honor to kick in the stomach. To-night they had made a fire in this Mr. Brady's flower-garden, over which they were cooking venison steaks. And, as I reached the door, the North Wind spied me, grinned, rubbed his stomach, made a false dash at me that frightened {{me out of my}} wits, and finally went through the pantomime of scalping me. I stood looking at him with my legs apart, for the son of the Great Chief must not run away. And I marked that the North Wind had two great ornamental daubs like shutter-fastenings painted on his cheeks. I sniffed preparation, too, on his followers, and I was sure they were getting ready for some new deviltry. I handed the note to Mr. Brady through the crack of the door that he vouchsafed to me, and when he had slammed and bolted me out, I ran into the street and stood for some time behind the trunk of a big hickory, watching the followers of the North Wind. Some were painting themselves, others cleaning their rifles and sharpening their scalping knives. All jabbered unceasingly. Now and again a silent brave passed, paused a moment to survey them gravely, grunted an answer to something they would fling at him, and went on. At length arrived three chiefs whom I knew to be high in the councils. The North Wind came out to them, and the four blanketed forms stood silhouetted between me and the fire for a quarter of an hour. By this time I was sure of a plot, and fled away to another tree for fear of detection. At length stalked through the street the Hungry Wolf, the <b>interpreter.</b> <b>I</b> knew this man to be friendly to Clark, and I acted on impulse.

40|$|I {{defend the}} claim that Avicenna {{explains}} {{the creation of the}} universe in terms of emanation modeled on Neoplatonic emanation by exploring Avicenna’s account of creation by emanation in detail. I address what appears to be an obvious problem for the application of this model to creation—namely, that creation as emanation seems to be non-voluntary and has been understood to be non-voluntary by several prominent <b>interpreters.</b> <b>I</b> explore how Avicenna contends that God emanates voluntarily and non-necessarily (that is, God’s action is subject to no internal or external constraints). Avicenna is able to make this claim because of his distinction between an action done of natural necessity, done voluntarily, and done with an intention. I then address whether this means that God creates freely—without any constraint whatsoever—and I conclude that God is not free not to create because God (a) has an immutable will and (b) has already acted to create.

In this process the ulama played key role by commenting Islam accordance with the need of the age or of the Ottoman Empire. The reformers, chiefly the Sultan and his close friends needed the support of the ulama to legitimate their reform programmes In this crucial stage the head of the ulama the Shaykhulislam, used his own religious knowledge and influence, derived from his office by writing a treatise to persuade the masses to accept the reforms. Applying the traditional virtue literature on the Ottoman dynasty he presented in this pamphlet one of the Western-minded Ottoman sultans as an ideal caliph-sultan. This attitude helped to transform the middle-aged Ottoman political structure and society into modern ages in Western line...|$|R
