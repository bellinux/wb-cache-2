40|$|International {{agreements}} for the International Commission for the Conservation of Atlantic Tunas (<b>ICCAT)</b> <b>convention</b> <b>area</b> {{imply that}} Atlantic tuna stocks should {{be managed by}} strategies based on maximum sustainable yield (MSY); however, there is concern whether this will actually ensure sustainability with sufficiently high probability consistent with the principals of the precautionary approach. Therefore, the performance of MSY management strategies based on current assessment procedures was evaluated using a computer simulation framework. The framework includes the data collection, assessment, prediction, and management processes, {{as well as the}} implementation of management regulations. It therefore provides an integrated way to evaluate the relative importance of and the interactions between each component of the system with regard to the overall success of the management strategy. The study elucidates guidelines about assessment and management that are general enough to be applied to all tunas in the Atlantic Ocean. It does so by comparing different hypotheses about management and assessment for three stocks (North Atlantic albacore, Atlantic bigeye and East Atlantic skipjack), which are representative of the variety encountered (i. e. from data rich to poor and tropical to temperate waters) in ICCAT stocks. Management performance was especially sensitive to the carrying capacity of the stock. The type of proxy used for MSY was more important {{to the success of the}} procedure than the frequency of assessment or the number of indices used in the assessment. Whilst the procedure was successful at achieving the management objectives for albacore, it was only partially successful for bigeye and was too conservative for skipjack...|$|E

40|$|The {{alpine region}} is of crucial {{importance}} for the European Union; as a result, the Carpathian Convention aims at its sustainable development. Since sustainability implies also conservation through natural protected areas, aimed at including regions representative for the national biogeographical space, this article aims at assessing the efficiency of conservation. The methodology consisted of using spatial metrics applied to Romanian and European data on the natural protected areas, land cover and use and their transitional dynamics. The findings show a very good coverage of the Alpine biogeographical region (98 % included in the <b>Convention</b> <b>area,</b> and 43 % of it protected within the <b>Convention</b> <b>area)</b> and of the ecological region of Carpathian montane coniferous forests (88 % included in the <b>Convention</b> <b>area,</b> and 42 % of it protected within the <b>Convention</b> <b>area).</b> The dominant land cover is represented by forests (63 % within the <b>Convention</b> <b>area,</b> and 70 % of the total protected area). The main transitional dynamics are deforestation (covering 50 % of all changes <b>area</b> within the <b>Convention</b> <b>area</b> and 46 % from the changed area within its protected area) and forestations – including afforestation, reforestation and colonization of abandoned agricultural areas by forest vegetation (covering 44 % of all changes <b>area</b> within the <b>Convention</b> <b>area</b> and 51 % from the changed area within its protected area) during 1990 - 2000 and deforestation (covering 97 % of all changes <b>area</b> within the <b>Convention</b> <b>area</b> and 99 % from the changed area within its protected area) during 1990 - 2000.

40|$|The International Commission for the Conservation of Atlantic Tunas (ICCAT) is a {{regional}} fisheries management organization (RFMO) comprised of over fifty cooperating states and fishing entities. It manages Northern Atlantic bluefin tuna (Thunnus thynnus) in the Atlantic Ocean and Mediterranean Sea. Due to overfishing and ineffective management, the stock abundance {{of this species}} has declined to about thirty percent of its unfished biomass in the Atlantic Ocean and Mediterranean Sea. Many publications point to this poor stock status as evidence of failed fisheries management. To maintain bluefin tuna stocks {{at a level that}} can support maximum sustainable yield (MSY), ICCAT has implemented unique tools to manage this important fishery, {{which is one of the}} oldest-recorded in the world. ^ In this thesis research, I examine the factors that contribute to the tools utilized to manage the fishery in the <b>ICCAT</b> <b>Convention</b> <b>Area</b> to shed light on why they are managed differently than other ICCAT stocks. To do this, I conducted a literature review on publicly available ICCAT reports, governmental and non-governmental documents, peer reviewed scientific literature, and other sources to understand and explain the relevant importance of each contributing factor to the management of the species. I utilized key informant interview methodology to obtain insights from twelve bluefin tuna experts representing a variety of interests that attend ICCAT official meetings. I transcribed and collected insights from semi-structured interviews, which I used to ground-truth the findings of the literature review. ^ No single factor is responsible for the unique management in place to govern ICCAT 2 ̆ 7 s bluefin tuna fishery. Rather, a nuanced interaction of many important factors contributes to the species 2 ̆ 7 poor stock status and unique management. The history and complex nature of the fishery, unique biology of the species, strong demand in the world sushi market, impact of Illegal, Unreported, and Unregulated (IUU) fishing, and political will of ICCAT member countries to enforce Recommendations and Resolutions influence which measures are adopted and implemented. This finding contrasts peer reviewed literature and other information to the contrary that attribute the unique management and poor stock status of bluefin tuna to such factors as high market value of the species 2 ̆ 7 meat, ineffective ICCAT management, Hardin 2 ̆ 7 s 2 ̆ 2 Tragedy of the Commons, 2 ̆ 2 or the 2 ̆ 2 free riding 2 ̆ 2 of non-cooperating fishing entities fully. ^ Based on key informant interviews, expert respondents share a high level of agreement that the special, 2 ̆ 2 iconic 2 ̆ 2 status that bluefin tuna have attained in popular media, scientific publications, and in general public opinion are important factors that contribute to their management. Further, experts mostly agree that more scientific research on the biology and life history of the species needs to be conducted to inform more effective and appropriate management such as updating the current two-stock management framework. Experts recommend that ICCAT prioritize setting Total Allowable Catch (TAC) Recommendations based on the advice of their Standing Committee on Research and Statistics (SCRS) to sustain healthy stocks. This thesis research provides analyses of these various forces and the management context of the species, and shares recommendations for improving bluefin tuna management. ...|$|E

The WCPFC <b>Convention</b> <b>Area</b> overlaps with the distribution of 18 of the 22 species of albatross, and the Global Procellariiform Tracking Database holds relevant remote tracking data for 14 of these. This analysis highlights the high importance of WCPFC for global albatross distribution, with at 11 of these species having over 50 % of their distribution in the WCPFC <b>Convention</b> <b>Area</b> in one or more seasons of the year, and 9 of these having over 40 % of their distribution in one or more seasons in areas in which WCPFC longline fishing effort occurs. Fewer data are available for petrel and shearwater species, but at least Sooty Shearwater and Westland Petrel also have high overlap with WCPFC longline effort. Seasonally, the three North Pacific albatross species (Laysan, Black-foot and Short-tailed) have a high overlap with the WCPFC <b>Convention</b> <b>Area</b> throughout the year.
