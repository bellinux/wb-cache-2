30|$|Normal epiploic {{appendages}} {{are covered}} by visceral peritoneum and typically measure 1 – 2  cm in thickness and 2 – 5  cm in length, {{but they have been}} reported to be up to 10  cm in length [4, 5]. For unclear reasons, these structures tend to be larger in obese patients and in those who have recently lost weight [5]. The vascular supply of epiploic appendage relies on one or two small feeding arteries originating from the vasa recta longa of colon, while the venous drainage is guaranteed by a tortuous vein passing through a narrow pedicle [1, 5]. The limited vascular perfusion, associated with their pedunculated shape and increased mobility, exposes epiploic appendages to high risk of torsion with subsequent <b>ischemia</b> <b>or</b> <b>hemorrhage</b> [2 – 5]. Although the exact role of epiploic appendages is not well understood, it is assumed that these structures act as protective fat pad during intestinal peristalsis, similarly to the greater omentum. They may also play a role in fat storage and intestinal immunity [5].|$|R
40|$|Aversion to food is {{observed}} at children {{at different stages}} of their development since the neonatality period. This state can be caused by several reasons. First, by coexisting diseases among which there are pathology of a gastrointestinal path (gastroesophageal reflux disease, malabsorption syndrome), neurologic (damage at <b>ischemia</b> <b>or</b> <b>hemorrhage</b> of a brain axis and cervical cord, neuromuscular diseases) and logopedic pathology (ankyloglossia), metabolic diseases (organic aciduria) and food intolerance. Secondly, disorder of eating behaviour can be connected with organic pathology, for example with gullet and stomach developmental malformations (esophageal achalasi, short gullet, pyloristenosis), congenital pathology of cardiovascular system, respiratory organs, liver. Thirdly, aversion to food can take place against complete health without visible objective reasons and, as a rule, is interfaced to the wrong feeding. For this reason the determination of possible reasons of eating disorder is fundamental for the achievement of clinical effect. However, besides treatment of the main disease the complex behavioural and nutritional correction which is considered in this article is justified for all patients with aversion to food. </p...|$|R

40|$|Cerebellar hypermetria, a {{classical}} sign designating the overshoot {{when the patient}} attempts to reach rapidly an aimed target, is associated with an imbalance between timing and/or intensity of agonist and antagonist EMG activities. Recovery of hypermetria following a cerebellar <b>ischemia</b> <b>or</b> <b>hemorrhage</b> has been demonstrated {{to take place in}} a multistage process, but aberrant recovery following a cerebellar stroke has not been described previously. We report an 85 -year-old woman presenting an abnormal recovery following a cerebellar infarction. We identified three successive stages. At stage 1, fast wrist flexion movements were severely hypermetric and associated with three EMG defects: a delayed onset latency of antagonist EMG activity, a reduction of intensity of the agonist EMG activity and a depression of intensity of antagonist EMG activity. At stage 2, movements were characterized by terminal oscillations around the target and the onset latency of the antagonist activity had returned to normal. At stage 3, movements were markedly hypometric, the intensity of the antagonist EMG activity had returned to normal, while the intensity of the agonist EMG activity remained abnormally low. This case illustrates an abnormal reprogramming of the EMG triphasic pattern, resulting in the shift from severe hypermetria to severe hypometria. SCOPUS: ar. jinfo:eu-repo/semantics/publishe...|$|R
40|$|Cerebral Autoregulation (CA) {{refers to}} the {{capability}} of the brain to maintain {{a more or less}} stable cerebral blood flow (CBF), despite the changes in blood perfusion. Monitoring this mechanism is of vital importance, especially in neonates, in order to prevent damage due to <b>ischemia</b> <b>or</b> <b>hemorrhage.</b> In clinical practice near-infrared spectroscopy (NIRS) measurements are used as a surrogate measurement for CBF. However, NIRS signals are highly dependent on the variations in arterial oxygen saturation (SaO 2). Therefore, only segments with relatively constant SaO 2 are used for CA assessment; which limits the possibilities of the use of NIRS for online monitoring. In this paper we propose the use of subspace projections to subtract the influence of SaO 2 from NIRS measurements. Since this approach will be used in an online monitoring system, this preprocessing is carried out in a window-by-window framework. However, the use of subspace projections in consecutive segments produces discontinuities; we propose a methodology to reduce these effects. Obtained results indicate that the proposed method reduces the effect of discontinuities between consecutive segments. In addition, this methodology is able to subtract the influence of SaO 2 from NIRS measurements. This approach facilitates the introduction of NIRS for online CA assessment. status: publishe...|$|R
40|$|Stroke is the {{culmination}} of a heterogeneous group of cerebrovascular diseases that is manifested as <b>ischemia</b> <b>or</b> <b>hemorrhage</b> of one <b>or</b> more blood vessels of the brain. The occurrence of many acute cardiovascular events [...] such as myocardial infarction, sudden cardiac death, pulmonary embolism, critical limb ischemia, and aortic aneurysm rupture [...] exhibits prominent 24 h patterning, with a major morning peak and secondary early evening peak. The incidence of stroke exhibits the same 24 h pattern. Although ischemic and hemorrhagic strokes are different entities and are characterized by different pathophysiological mechanisms, they share an identical double-peak 24 h pattern. A constellation of endogenous circadian rhythms and exogenous cyclic factors are involved. The staging of the circadian rhythms in vascular tone, coagulative balance, and blood pressure plus temporal patterns in posture, physical activity, emotional stress, and medication effects play central and/or triggering roles. Features of the circadian rhythm of blood pressure, in terms of their chronic and acute effects on cerebral vessels, and of coagulation are especially important. Clinical medicine has been most concerned with the prevention of stroke in the morning, when population-based studies show it is of greatest risk during the 24 h; however, improved protection of at-risk patients against stroke in the early evening, the second most vulnerable time of cerebrovascular accidents, has received relatively little attention thus far...|$|R

40|$|Protease {{activated}} receptor- 1 (PAR 1) {{is expressed}} in multiple cell types in the CNS, with the most prominent expression in glial cells. PAR 1 activation enhances excitatory synaptic transmission secondary {{to the release of}} glutamate from astrocytes following activation of astrocytically-expressed PAR 1. In addition, PAR 1 activation exacerbates neuronal damage in multiple in vivo models of brain injury {{in a manner that is}} dependent on NMDA receptors. In the hippocampal formation, PAR 1 mRNA appears to be expressed by a subset of neurons, including granule cells in the dentate gyrus. In this study we investigate the role of PAR activation in controlling neuronal excitability of dentate granule cells. We confirm that PAR 1 protein {{is expressed in}} neurons of the dentate cell body layer as well as in astrocytes throughout the dentate. Activation of PAR 1 receptors by the selective peptide agonist TFLLR increased the intracellular Ca 2 + concentration in a subset of acutely dissociated dentate neurons as well as non-neuronal cells. Bath application of TFLLR in acute hippocampal slices depolarized the dentate gyrus, including the hilar region in wild type but not in the PAR 1 -/- mice. PAR 1 activation increased the frequency of action potential generation in a subset of dentate granule neurons; cells in which PAR 1 activation triggered action potentials showed a significant depolarization. The activation of PAR 1 by thrombin increased the amplitude of NMDA receptor-mediated component of EPSPs.

Therefore, a meta-analysis was performed to assess the efficacy of vitamin B supplementation in the treatment of stroke patients. Medline, Embase, Scopus, and Cochrane Library databases were searched (from 1960 to June 2015) and forest plots were generated to illustrate the treatment effects. A systemic review of the electronic databases yielded 12 eligible studies consisting of 7474 patients. Forest plots from the meta-analyses of the included studies illustrated that vitamin B supplementation significantly lowered the plasma concentration of total homocysteine (SMD = - 0. 82; 95 % CI: - 0. 77; Z = - 29. 06, p < 0. 0001) and resulted in significant reduction in stroke recurrence (OR = 0. 86 %; 95 % CI: 0. 76, 0. 97; Z = - 2. 41; p = 0. 016) as well as a combined incidence of vascular events, including recurrent strokes, myocardial infarctions and vascular deaths (OR = 0. 87 %; 95 % CI: 0. 79, 0. 96; Z= - 2. 73; p = 0. 0063). Additionally, the nearly-symmetrical funnel plot (Egger’s test, t = − 1. 705, p = 0. 1224) indicated the absence of publication bias regarding the meta-analysis that examined the effect of vitamin B supplementation on the plasma levels of homocysteine in acute stroke patients.

40|$|OBJECTIVE: We {{investigated}} whether serum {{levels of}} neuron-specific enolase (NSE) and S- 100 β protein {{could be used}} to evaluate cerebral injury and to predict outcome in severe sepsis and severe septic shock. DESIGN: Prospective study. SETTING: University hospital. PATIENTS AND MEASUREMENTS: In 170 consecutively enrolled patients with severe sepsis and septic shock, serum S- 100 β and NSE were measured daily during four consecutive days after intensive care unit admission. Admission Glasgow Coma Scale before sedation and daily Sequential Organ Failure Assessment scores were recorded in all patients. Acute encephalopathy was defined as either a state of agitation, confusion, irritability, and convulsions (type A) or characterized by somnolence, stupor, and coma (type B) and persistently observed during 72 hrs after withdrawing sedation. When clinically indicated, contrast computed tomography or magnetic resonance imaging were performed to evaluate brain injury. MAIN RESULTS: S- 100 β and NSE increased in, respectively, 72 (42 %) and 90 (53 %) patients. High biomarker levels were associated with the maximum Sequential Organ Failure Assessment scores (p =. 001), and the highest values were found in patients who died early, within 4 days of inclusion (p =. 005). Low consciousness encephalopathy type B was more frequently observed in patients with elevated S- 100 β (p =. 004). S- 100 β levels of ≥ 4 μg/L were associated with severe brain <b>ischemia</b> <b>or</b> <b>hemorrhage,</b> and values of < 2 μg/L were found in patients with diffuse cerebral embolic infarction lesions. High S- 100 β levels were associated with higher intensive care unit mortality (p =. 04) and represented the strongest independent predictor of intensive care unit survival, whereas NSE and the Glasgow Coma Scale failed to predict fatal outcome. CONCLUSIONS: S- 100 β and NSE are frequently increased and associated with brain injury in patients with severe sepsis and septic shock. S- 100 β levels more closely reflected severe encephalopathy and type of brain lesions than NSE and the Glasgow Coma Scale.

50|$|Raised {{intracranial}} pressure can ultimately {{result in the}} shifting or crushing of brain tissue, which is detrimental to the physiological well being of patients. As a result, the Cushing reflex is a last-ditch effort by the body to maintain homeostasis in the brain. It is widely accepted that the Cushing reflex acts as a baroreflex, or homeostatic mechanism {{for the maintenance of}} blood pressure, in the cranial region. Specifically, the reflex mechanism can maintain normal cerebral blood flow and pressure under stressful situations such as <b>ischemia</b> <b>or</b> subarachnoid <b>hemorrhages.</b> A case report of a patient who underwent a spontaneous subarachnoid hemorrhage demonstrated that the Cushing reflex played a part in maintaining cerebral perfusion pressure (CPP) and cerebral blood flow. Eventually, the ICP drops to a level range where a state of induced hypertension {{in the form of the}} Cushing reflex is no longer required. The Cushing reflex was then aborted, and CPP was maintained. It has also been shown that an increase in mean arterial pressure due to hypertension, characteristic of the reflex, can cause the normalization of CPP. This effect is protective, especially during increased {{intracranial pressure}}, which creates a drop in CPP.|$|R
40|$|Stroke is a {{cardiovascular}} disease {{that results in}} the abnormal blood supply to the brain either by the lack thereof (i. e., <b>ischemia),</b> <b>or</b> <b>hemorrhage,</b> both causing a rapidly developing loss of brain function. It affects millions of people worldwide, resulting in long-term disability and death. This work {{is an effort to}} reduce the morbidity and mortality rates associated with stroke through the implementation of shape memory materials in the design of medical devices used in its treatment and prevention. Shape memory materials have the ability to recover predetermined deformation upon exposure to stimuli such as heat. These volume changing capabilities make them excellent candidate materials for stroke interventions. Such interventions require the accessing of blood vessels in the brain, which over the past fifty years has shifted from a direct surgical approach, to less invasive endovascular procedures. The majority of this work is devoted to developing an endovascular thrombectomy device for the treatment of acute ischemic stroke. This device evolves from a SMP-based device into a hybrid device made of a combination of SMP foam and nitinol. The respective increase in success rate of thrombus removal in a bench-top model was from 67 % to 100 %. This hybrid device is then tested in a porcine model, in which it is able to restore blood flow in an artery occluded with a thrombus nearly 3 times its working length. In addition to being utilized as a component of the hybrid thrombectomy device, SMP foam is being investigated as an embolic aneurysm filler for the prevention of hemorrhagic stroke because of its flow arresting properties. The rest of this dissertation deals with the characterization of such properties through the implementation of porous media theory. A system is constructed for the measurement of the porous media properties of SMP foam as well as coils mimicking the geometry of embolic coils, which are the state-of-the-art treatment of aneurysms. Results show that SMP foams impose a higher resistance to fluid flow compared to mock embolic coils, suggesting that aneurysms treated with SMP foams will have flow conditions more favorable for blood stasis than those treated with embolic coils...|$|R
40|$|Disturbances in {{cerebral}} hemodynamics {{are one of}} {{the principal}} causes of cerebral damage in premature infants. Specifically, changes in cerebral blood flow might cause <b>ischemia</b> <b>or</b> <b>hemorrhage</b> that can lead to motor and developmental disabilities. Under normal circumstances, there are several mechanisms that act jointly to preserve cerebral hemodynamics homeostasis. However, in case that one of these mechanisms is disrupted the brain is exposed to damage. Premature infants are susceptible to variations in cerebral circulation due to their fragility. Therefore, monitoring cerebral hemodynamics is of vital importance in order to prevent brain damage in this population and avoid subsequent sequelae. This thesis is oriented to the development of signal processing techniques that can be of help in monitoring cerebral hemodynamics in neonates. There are several problems that hinder the use in clinical practice of monitoring cerebral hemodynamics. On one hand, continuous measurements of cerebral blood flow, or hemodynamical variables, are difficult to obtain in premature infants. In this context, Near Infrared Spectroscopy (NIRS) {{is one of the few}} technologies that is available for the measurement of hemodynamical variables in this population. NIRS is a noninvasive and safe technology that is based on light radiation. NIRS allows the continuous measurement of cerebral oxygenation that under certain considerations reflects changes in cerebral blood flow. On the other hand, cerebral hemodynamics assessment is performed by evaluating the strength of the relationship between some systemic variables, e. g. mean arterial blood pressure and concentration of CO 2, and the cerebral hemodynamics variables. Under normal conditions cerebral hemodynamics variables should be independent of systemic variations. Coupled dynamic between systemic and cerebral hemodynamics variables represents a high risk situation for the patient. Among the techniques available for the monitoring of cerebral hemodynamics, most of them assume that the mechanisms responsible for its control are linear and univariate. In reality, these mechanisms are nonlinear, multivariate, nonstationary and highly coupled. This thesis, on one hand, introduces the use of more sophisticated signal processing techniques for monitoring cerebral hemodynamics, which can address the multivariate and/or the nonlinear nature of the mechanisms involved in its control. Linear techniques such as canonical correlation analysis, subspace projections and wavelet based transfer function; and nonlinear techniques such as least squares support vector machines and kernel principal component regression, have been introduced for the NIRS-based monitoring of cerebral hemodynamics. On the other hand, kernel principal component regression is a nonlinear methodology that produces as result a black box model, which lacks clinical interpretability. Therefore, in this thesis attention has been given to the development of methodologies that allow to interpret the results produced by this nonlinear model in a clinical framework. For this purpose a method based on subspace projections is proposed. In addition, in this thesis, results from several clinical studies related to monitoring cerebral hemodynamics are presented. status: publishe...|$|R

It {{frequently}} causes a considerable social burden because of its high incidence of death and long-term disability, {{especially in the case}} of severe TBI. Recent studies revealed that the spleen might contribute to secondary brain injury after <b>ischemia</b> <b>or</b> intracerebral <b>hemorrhage.</b> The purpose of this study was to evaluate the significance of the spleen in traumatic brain edema after severe TBI. METHODS: We established a severe TBI model with rats and performed splenectomy to observe the mortality, brain water content, cognitive function (water maze), and cytokines levels, including interleukin (IL) - 1 β, tumor necrosis factor-α (TNF-α), IL- 6, and IL- 10, in the blood plasma (enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay) and their mRNA expression levels in injured brain tissue (quantitative reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction). RESULTS: The immediate splenectomy after TBI significantly decreased the death rate from 35. 42 % to 14. 89 % and eliminated the brain water content of the injured brain, especially at days 2 and 3. The Morris water maze assessment showed an improved spatial reference memory in rats that underwent both TBI and splenectomy when compared with those in the TBI group, 4 weeks later. Splenectomy reduced the IL- 1 β, TNF-α, and IL- 6 contents in the blood serum after TBI, and the mRNA expression levels of IL- 1 β, TNF-α, and IL- 6 in the ipsilateral brain tissue also decreased. CONCLUSIONS: Our study demonstrates that splenectomy has a protective effect on rats with severe TBI by inhibiting proinflammatory cytokines, including IL- 1 β, TNF-α, and IL- 6, both systematically and locally in the injured brain, hence leading to a decreased mortality and improved cognitive function.

Interrupting the {{progression}} of negative remodeling after a myocardial infarction (MI) could mitigate the damage caused by a heart attack and preventing the onset of heart failure. Extracellular matrix (ECM) hydrogels have emerged as potential scaffolds for cardiac repair; however, all ECM hydrogels previously explored have been derived from xenogeneic sources, raising concerns regarding immunogenicity, disease transfer, and increased regulation by the FDA. In this dissertation work, a potentially autologous pericardial matrix hydrogel is developed, characterized, and tested. The presence of sulfated sugars in the material led to the hypothesis that heparin-binding growth factors could be sequestered for prolonged delivery and increased effect in vivo. The positive results of this work prompted the exploration of delivering a novel growth factor candidate with the pericardial matrix to evaluate the potential effect on cardiac function post-MI, demonstrating the potential value of this growth factor delivery system in vivo. Though concerns regarding using a xenogeniec material provided the basis for first investigating an autologous option, understanding the effect on the host response is important, prompting evaluation of the inflammatory response to rat myocardial matrix compared to porcine myocardial matrix. Using a non- decellularized myocardial matrix and saline as controls, we sought to understand the inflammatory response to allogeneic and xenogeneic materials in healthy animals. The only signs of chronic inflammation were seen in the non-decellularized positive controls; little difference was noted between the porcine and rat ECM hydrogels, supporting the conclusion that there may be no added value to allogeneic over xenogeneic materials. Exposure to myocardial matrix had no effect on clotting times or platelet activation in human blood and platelet-rich- plasma samples. Direct injection of the ECM hydrogel into the lumen of the left ventricle did not cause notable <b>ischemia,</b> edema, <b>or</b> <b>hemorrhage</b> in peripheral organs.

The aim of this study was to investigate if markers of insulin resistance were associated with risk of stroke in the general elderly population. This study was part of the large population-based Rotterdam Study and included 5, 234 participants who were aged 55 years or older and stroke free and diabetes free at baseline (1997 - 2001). Fasting insulin levels and homeostasis model assessment for insulin resistance were used as markers for insulin resistance. Cox regression was used to determine associations between insulin resistance markers and stroke risk, adjusted for age, sex, and potential confounders. During 42, 806 person-years of follow-up (median: 8. 6 years), 366 first-ever strokes occurred, of which 225 were cerebral infarctions, 42 were intracerebral hemorrhages, and 99 were unspecified strokes. Fasting insulin levels were not associated with risk of any stroke, cerebral infarction, <b>or</b> intracerebral <b>hemorrhage.</b> Homeostasis <b>model</b> assessment for insulin resistance, which almost perfectly correlated with fasting insulin levels, was also not associated with risk of stroke or stroke subtypes. In conclusion, in this population-based cohort study among nondiabetic elderly, insulin resistance markers were not associated with risk of stroke or any of its subtypes...|$|R

40|$|Purpose: To {{investigate}} {{the efficacy of}} normobaric oxygen (NBO) therapy for treatment of scleral <b>ischemia</b> <b>or</b> melt. Methods: This prospective interventional case series includes 9 eyes of 8 patients with scleral <b>ischemia</b> <b>or</b> melt of diverse etiologies. Following the failure of conventional medical and/or surgical therapy to improve <b>ischemia</b> <b>or</b> upon clinical deterioration, NBO was initiated. All patients received 100 % NBO at flow rate of 10 liters/minute by face mask for 1 hour, twice daily until complete vascularization of ischemic areas. Main outcome measures were improvement of scleral ischemia and healing of conjunctival epithelial defects. Results: NBO therapy led to epithelialization and vascularization of the ischemic sclera in all eyes; the repair process began 3 - 4 days after NBO had been initiated and was completed in 18. 1 ± 4. 7 (range, 10 - 25) days. All patients remained stable over a 9 -month follow-up period. Conclusion: NBO therapy seems effective for treatment of scleral <b>ischemia</b> <b>or</b> melt, and hence {{can be considered as}} a non-invasive alternative to surgical intervention in these conditions...|$|R
