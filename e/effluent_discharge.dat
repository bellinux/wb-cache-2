5|$|No rivers or streams {{ran into}} the sound but note that early maps {{conflict}} and show that the River Cadoxton, originating from feeder brooks meeting at Michaelston-le-pit between Ely, Leckwith and Wenvoe to the north-east, passed through Dinas Powys and Sully Moors and bypassed the Barry shoreline to meet the sea near Cold Knap Point before decades later, Cold Knap promenade and Watchtower Bay was developed. With {{the coming of the}} docks, the River Cadoxton was re-routed from Sully moors through what was later to become the Supplies Reserve Depôt (SRD) and later still, the chemical complexes in the area, to discharge south-east of the dock's south-east breakwater at the Bendricks. For many years after the last war, with the dissolution of the SRD and coming of the chemical works, <b>effluent</b> <b>discharge</b> from some of them, was carried along the river to the sea and turned the water white in colour and it gave off a pungent effervescent odour until bylaws brought this pollution to an end and gradually the hitherto white shoreline at that area, returned to its normal sandstone colour.|$|E

The 2000 census {{indicated}} that 55% of Mexican households with access to piped water received services on an intermittent basis, in particular in smaller municipalities and poor areas.

The new integrated sewage and storm-water system intercepts 38 former sewage and industrial <b>effluent</b> <b>discharge</b> points and route it to sewage treatment plants south of Vasna Barrage. Thus it reduced the water pollution in the river. The water level in the river is retained through Vasna Barrage and the losing water is replenished by the Narmada Canal. It enabled the groundwater recharge and the recreational facilities like boating in the river. There are also plans to replenish river by treated sewage water.|$|E

Our project is an effort to reduce the toxicity of the <b>effluent</b> <b>discharged</b> from an electroplating unit. The project aims to reduce heavy metalion concentrations in the <b>effluent</b> <b>discharged</b> by employing a combined effect of precipitation and adsorption. These methods have been successfully applied and tested by us on a laboratory level and can be easily adapted at an industrial level economically. The project suggests other more sophisticated and new methods of treating effluent from an electroplating unit. We have analyzed our method of treatment from all angles and also recommended solutions to rectify its minor short comings. The report includes an adsorption bed prototype which can be used on a bigger or industrial scale. This method of treatment is simple, effective, practical and most importantly cost effective...|$|R
