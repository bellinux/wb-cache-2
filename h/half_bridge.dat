2500|$|Another {{alternative}} {{replaces the}} <b>half</b> <b>bridge</b> MMC submodule described above, {{with a full}} bridge submodule containing four IGBTs in an H bridge arrangement, instead of two. [...] The full-bridge variant of MMC allows the submodule capacitor to be inserted into the circuit in either polarity. [...] This confers additional flexibility in controlling the converter and allows the converter to block the fault current which arises from a short-circuit between {{the positive and negative}} DC terminals (something which is impossible with any of the preceding types of VSC). [...] Furthermore it allows the DC voltage to be of either polarity (like a LCC HVDC scheme), giving rise to the possibility of hybrid LCC and VSC HVDC systems. However, the full-bridge arrangement requires twice as many IGBTs and has higher power losses than the equivalent half-bridge arrangement.|$|E

5000|$|A common {{variation}} of this circuit uses {{just the two}} transistors {{on one side of}} the load, similar to a class AB amplifier. Such a configuration is called a [...] "half bridge". The <b>half</b> <b>bridge</b> is used in some switched-mode power supplies that use synchronous rectifiers and in switching amplifiers. The half-H bridge type is commonly abbreviated to [...] "Half-H" [...] to distinguish it from full ("Full-H") H bridges. Another common variation, adding a third 'leg' to the bridge, creates a three-phase inverter. The three-phase inverter is the core of any AC motor drive.|$|E
5000|$|Through a {{mechanical}} construction, the force being sensed deforms a strain gauge. The strain gauge measures the deformation (strain) as {{a change in}} electrical resistance, which {{is a measure of}} the strain and hence the applied forces. A load cell usually consists of four strain gauges in a Wheatstone bridge configuration. Load cells of one strain gauge (quarter bridge) or two strain gauges (<b>half</b> <b>bridge)</b> are also available. [...] The electrical signal output is typically in the order of a few millivolts and requires amplification by an instrumentation amplifier before it can be used. The output of the transducer can be scaled to calculate the force applied to the transducer. Sometimes a high resolution ADC, typically 24-bit, can be used directly.|$|E
50|$|Charge {{pumps are}} often used in H-Bridges in high side drivers for gate driving the high side {{n-channel}} power MOSFETs and IGBTs. These devices are used because of their good performance, but require a gate drive voltage a few volts above the power rail. When the centre of a <b>half</b> <b>bridge</b> goes low the capacitor is charged via a diode, and this charge is used to later drive {{the gate of the}} high side FET gate a few volts above the source or emitter pin's voltage so as to switch it on. This strategy works well provided the bridge is regularly switched and avoids the complexity of having to run a separate power supply and permits the more efficient n-channel devices to be used for both high and low switches.|$|E

50|$|Drivers {{for this}} type of {{electric}} load are power HF-generators that in many cases contain a transformer for high voltage generation. They resemble the control gear used to operate compact fluorescent lamps or cold cathode fluorescent lamps. The operation mode and the topologies of circuits to operate DBD lamps with continuous sine or square waves are similar to those standard drivers. In these cases, the energy that is stored in the DBD's capacitance {{does not have to be}} recovered to the intermediate supply after each ignition. Instead, it stays within the circuit (oscillates between the DBD's capacitance and at least one inductive component of the circuit) and only the real power, that is consumed by the lamp, has to be provided by the power supply. Differently, drivers for pulsed operation suffer from rather low power factor and in many cases must fully recover the DBD's energy. Since pulsed operation of DBD lamps can lead to increased lamp efficiency, international research led to suiting circuit concepts. Basic topologies are resonant flyback and resonant <b>half</b> <b>bridge.</b> A flexible circuit, that combines the two topologies is given in and and may be used to adaptively drive DBDs with varying capacitance.|$|E
5000|$|A {{variant of}} the MMC, {{proposed}} by one manufacturer, involves connecting multiple IGBTs in series {{in each of the}} two switches that make up the submodule. This gives an output voltage waveform with fewer, larger, steps than the conventional MMC arrangement. This arrangement {{is referred to as the}} Cascaded Two Level (CTL) converter. Functionally it is exactly equivalent to the conventional half-bridge MMC in every respect except for the harmonic performance, which is slightly inferior - although still claimed to be good enough to avoid the need for filtering in most instances.Another alternative replaces the <b>half</b> <b>bridge</b> MMC submodule described above, with a full bridge submodule containing four IGBTs in an H bridge arrangement, instead of two.

40|$|Overview: This design note {{describes}} how to incorporate an external circuit to provide dedicated output {{short circuit protection}} of the NCL 30051. Referring to Figure 1, In {{the event that the}} output is accidentally shorted to ground, the leakage inductance of the resonant <b>half</b> <b>bridge</b> transformer limits the current through the <b>half</b> <b>bridge</b> MOSFETS. Therefore, the higher the leakage inductance, the higher the impedance of the resonant tank circuit resulting in lower peak current in the MOSFET switches when the output is shorted. Since this is transformer dependent, it can be highly desirable to add protection that is not dependent on the transformer design and manufacturing variation. The described circuit has been validated on the existing NCL 30051 LED Demo Board to illustrate actual performance. Background: The NCL 30051 implements LED current regulation by controlling the bulk voltage provided by the PFC converter. The resonant <b>half</b> <b>bridge</b> provides voltage transformation as well as primary to secondary isolation. A minimum operating LED voltage is imposed by the minimum PFC voltage. This level can be no lower than the peak of the applied ac input voltage. If the LED voltage falls below this minimum operating voltage, the current in the LEDs and therefore the <b>half</b> <b>bridge</b> stage increases being limited only by the leakage inductance of the transformer. This <b>half</b> <b>bridge</b> converter uses series-connected capacitors to maintain transformer core volt-second balance by introducing an offset voltage at the midpoint as needed. During normal operation, there is also a small ac component at the <b>half</b> <b>bridge</b> frequency present on the midpoint between these ‘balancing ’ capacitors...|$|E
40|$|The {{three most}} {{commonly}} used switching circuits are the full bridge converter, the <b>half</b> <b>bridge</b> converter, and the forward converter. All three circuits use the same pulse width concept for regulation with the major difference being how many transistors are used for power handling. The full bridge uses four transistors, the <b>half</b> <b>bridge</b> uses two, and the forward converter uses one. In practical design, forward converters are used at 300 watts and below, half bridges at 300 to 600 watts, and full bridges above 600 watts. Regulation is achieved by alternately saturating diagonal pairs of transistors in the full bridge, alternately saturating transistors in the <b>half</b> <b>bridge,</b> and simply pulse modulating one transistor in the forward converter...|$|E
40|$|Abstract—In this paper, <b>half</b> <b>bridge</b> DC-DC {{converters}} {{with transformer}} isolation {{presented in the}} literature are analyzed for high-current and low-voltage applications under the same operation conditions, and compared in terms of losses and efficiency. The conventional and improved half-bridge DC-DC converters are simulated, and current and voltage waveforms are obtained for input voltage Vdc= 500 V, output current IO= 450 A, output voltage VO= 38 V and switching frequency fS= 20 kHz. IGBTs are used as power semiconductor switches. The power losses of the semiconductor devices are calculated from current and voltage waveforms.
