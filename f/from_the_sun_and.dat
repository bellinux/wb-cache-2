5|$|Although {{the closest}} scattered-disc objects {{approach}} the Sun at about 30–35AU, their orbits can extend well beyond 100AU. This makes scattered objects {{among the most}} distant and coldest objects in the Solar System. The innermost portion of the scattered disc overlaps with a torus-shaped region of orbiting objects traditionally called the Kuiper belt, but its outer limits reach much further away <b>from</b> <b>the</b> <b>Sun</b> <b>and</b> further {{above and below the}} ecliptic than the Kuiper belt proper.|$|E
5|$|As {{the comet}} {{approached}} the Sun, {{it continued to}} brighten, shining at 2ndmagnitude in February, and showing a growing pair of tails, the blue gas tail pointing straight away <b>from</b> <b>the</b> <b>Sun</b> <b>and</b> the yellowish dust tail curving away along its orbit. On March 9, a solar eclipse in China, Mongolia and eastern Siberia allowed observers there to see the comet in the daytime. Hale–Bopp had its closest approach to Earth on March 22, 1997 {{at a distance of}} 1.315AU.|$|E
5|$|Clouds {{intercept}} both heat <b>from</b> <b>the</b> <b>sun</b> <b>and</b> heat radiated {{from the}} Earth. Their effects {{are complex and}} vary in time, location, and altitude. Usually during the daytime the interception of sunlight predominates, giving a cooling effect; however, at night the re-radiation of heat to the Earth slows the Earth's heat loss, this causes storms and subsequent flood rains and flooding.|$|E

5|$|Earth is {{the third}} planet <b>from</b> <b>the</b> <b>Sun</b> <b>and</b> the only object in the Universe known to harbor life. According to radiometric dating and other sources of evidence, Earth formed over 4 billion years ago. Earth's gravity interacts with other objects in space, {{especially}} the Sun and the Moon, Earth's only natural satellite. Earth revolves around the Sun in 365.26 days, a period known as an Earth year. During this time, Earth rotates about its axis about 366.26 times.|$|E
5|$|Eris (68AU average) is {{the largest}} known {{scattered}} disc object, and caused a debate about what constitutes a planet, because it is 25% more massive than Pluto and about the same diameter. It is the most massive of the known dwarf planets. It has one known moon, Dysnomia. Like Pluto, its orbit is highly eccentric, with a perihelion of 38.2 AU (roughly Pluto's distance <b>from</b> <b>the</b> <b>Sun)</b> <b>and</b> an aphelion of 97.6 AU, and steeply inclined to the ecliptic plane.|$|E
5|$|Saturn is {{the sixth}} planet <b>from</b> <b>the</b> <b>Sun</b> <b>and</b> the second-largest in the Solar System, after Jupiter.

Saturn is named after the Roman god of agriculture; its astronomical symbol (♄) {{represents}} the god's sickle.|$|E

5|$|The {{motion of}} a star {{relative}} to the Sun can provide useful information about the origin and age {{of a star}}, {{as well as the}} structure and evolution of the surrounding galaxy. The components of motion of a star consist of the radial velocity toward or away <b>from</b> <b>the</b> <b>Sun,</b> <b>and</b> the traverse angular movement, which is called its proper motion.|$|E
5|$|Vega, also {{designated}} Alpha Lyrae (α Lyrae, abbreviated Alpha Lyr or α Lyr), is {{the brightest}} star in the constellation of Lyra, the fifth-brightest star in the night sky, and the second-brightest star in the northern celestial hemisphere, after Arcturus. It is relatively close at only 25 light-years <b>from</b> <b>the</b> <b>Sun,</b> <b>and,</b> together with Arcturus and Sirius, one of the most luminous stars in the Sun's neighborhood.|$|E
5|$|Also, {{there have}} been a few unorthodox (unusual) causes of solar urticaria. For those {{susceptible}} to visible light, white T-shirts may increase the chances of experiencing an outbreak.

Another patient was being treated with the antibiotic tetracycline for a separate dermatological disorder and broke out in hives when exposed to the sun, the first case to implicate tetracycline as a solar urticaria inducing agent.|$|E

5|$|Because the {{fireball}} {{was recorded}} by two cameras of the European Fireball Network, {{it was possible}} to calculate the trajectory of its flight through the atmosphere, and afterward also the characteristics of both its pre- and post-encounter orbit in the Solar System. The calculations were published by Czech astronomers Pavel Spurný, Zdeněk Ceplecha, and Jiří Borovička of the Ondřejov Observatory, who specialize in meteor observations. They demonstrated that the swing by the earth significantly altered the meteoroid's orbit. Its aphelion (the farthest it travels <b>from</b> <b>the</b> <b>Sun)</b> <b>and</b> orbital period were lowered to almost half of their original values. The object was initially in a highly inclined orbit (71°) and ended in an orbit with a slightly higher inclination (74°).|$|E
5|$|Deep Impact {{observed}} Comet Garradd (C/2009 P1) from February 20 to April 8, 2012, {{using its}} Medium Resolution Instrument, {{through a variety}} of filters. The comet was 1.75–2.11 astronomical units (AU) (2.62–3.16×108 km) <b>from</b> <b>the</b> <b>Sun</b> <b>and</b> 1.87–1.30 AU from the spacecraft. It was found that the outgassing from the comet varies with a period of 10.4 hours, which is presumed to be due to the rotation of its nucleus. The dry ice content of the comet was measured and found to be about ten percent of its water ice content by number of molecules.|$|E
5|$|Geography affects {{solar energy}} {{potential}} because {{areas that are}} closer to the equator have a greater amount of solar radiation. However, the use of photovoltaics that can follow {{the position of the}} sun can significantly increase the solar energy potential in areas that are farther from the equator. Time variation effects the potential of solar energy because during the nighttime there is little solar radiation {{on the surface of the}} Earth for solar panels to absorb. This limits the amount of energy that solar panels can absorb in one day. Cloud cover can affect the potential of solar panels because clouds block incoming light <b>from</b> <b>the</b> <b>sun</b> <b>and</b> reduce the light available for solar cells.|$|E

5|$|Jupiter is {{the fifth}} planet <b>from</b> <b>the</b> <b>Sun</b> <b>and</b> {{the largest in the}} Solar System. It is a giant planet with a mass one-thousandth that of the Sun, but {{two and a half times}} that of all the other planets in the Solar System combined. Jupiter and Saturn are gas giants; the other two giant planets, Uranus and Neptune are ice giants. Jupiter has been known to astronomers since antiquity. The Romans named it after their god Jupiter. When viewed from Earth, Jupiter can reach an {{apparent}} magnitude of −2.94, bright enough for its reflected light to cast shadows, and making it on average the third-brightest object in the night sky after the Moon and Venus.|$|E

5|$|The comet {{continued}} to fade as it receded, {{but is still}} being tracked by astronomers. In October 2007, 10 years after the perihelion and at distance of 25.7 AU from Sun, the comet was still active {{as indicated by the}} detection of the CO-driven coma. Herschel Space Observatory images taken in 2010 suggest comet Hale–Bopp is covered in a fresh frost layer. Hale–Bopp was again detected in December 2010 when it was 30.7 AU away <b>from</b> <b>the</b> <b>Sun,</b> <b>and</b> on August 7, 2012 at a 33.2 AU distance from the Sun. Astronomers expect that the comet will remain observable with large telescopes until perhaps 2020, by which time it will be nearing 30thmagnitude. By this time it will become very difficult to distinguish the comet from the large numbers of distant galaxies of similar brightness.|$|E
