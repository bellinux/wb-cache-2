50|$|Inserting {{elements}} can be {{done through}} oXygen's XML refactoring commands to insert an element at the current cursor location. Even if XML tags are set to be non-visible, an indication for an <b>empty</b> <b>element</b> is always displayed using that element's name.|$|E
5000|$|In {{web page}} design, and {{generally}} for all markup languages such as [...] SGML, HTML, and XML, a well-formed element {{is one that}} is either a) opened and subsequently closed, or b) an <b>empty</b> <b>element,</b> which in that case must be terminated; and in either case which is properly nested so that it does not overlap with other elements.|$|E
5000|$|The general {{form of an}} HTML {{element is}} therefore: [...] Some HTML {{elements}} are defined as <b>empty</b> <b>elements</b> and take the form [...] <b>Empty</b> <b>elements</b> may enclose no content, for instance, the [...] tag or the inline [...] tag.The name of an HTML element is the name used in the tags.Note that the end tag's name is preceded by a slash character, [...] "/", and that in <b>empty</b> <b>elements</b> the end tag is neither required nor allowed.If attributes are not mentioned, default values are used in each case.|$|R

30|$|Among various constructions in Chinese and English we have {{examined}} so far, the internal conjunct contains some <b>empty</b> <b>elements.</b> Some {{of them may}} be derived by deletion, for instance, VP-ellipsis, and some may be base-generated silent elements, {{in the sense of}} Kayne (2015). Although the functional category F plays a crucial role in conjunction, the relation between the two conjuncts can also be brought together by co-reference between the <b>empty</b> <b>elements</b> in the internal conjunct and their antecedent in the external conjunct in some cases.|$|R
5000|$|Hypertext markup makes {{parts of}} a {{document}} into links to other documents: An anchor element creates a hyperlink in the document and its [...] attribute sets the link's target URL. For example, the HTML markup, , will render the word [...] "Wikipedia" [...] as a hyperlink. To render an image as a hyperlink, an [...] "img" [...] element is inserted as content into the [...] "a" [...] element. Like [...] "br", [...] "img" [...] is an <b>empty</b> <b>element</b> with attributes but no content or closing tag[...]|$|E
5000|$|The {{role of the}} cleft pronoun (it in {{the case}} of English) is controversial, and some believe it to be referential, while others treat it as a dummy pronoun or <b>empty</b> <b>element.</b> The former {{analysis}} has come to be termed the [...] "expletive" [...] view, whereas the latter {{is referred to as the}} [...] "extraposition" [...] approach. Hedberg (2002) proposes a hybrid approach, combining ideas from both takes on the status of the cleft pronoun. She shows that it can have a range of scopes (from semantically void to full reference) depending on the context in which it is used.|$|E
5000|$|Paragraphs:Paragraph 1 [...] Paragraph 2Line breaks:. The {{difference}} between [...] and [...] is that [...] "br" [...] breaks a line without altering the semantic {{structure of the}} page, whereas [...] "p" [...] sections the page into paragraphs. Note also that [...] "br" [...] is an <b>empty</b> <b>element</b> in that, although it may have attributes, it can take no content {{and it may not}} have an end tag.This is a paragraph with line breaksThis is a link in HTML. To create a link the [...] tag is used.

Correspondences between abstract and document sentences {{are marked by}} a double link: attribute DOCUMENTC in abstract sentences, and attribute ABSTRACTC in document sentences. This correspondence is determined by a similarity finding algorithm and manual checking (cf. section 4. 1. 2. 2). Images: Images are removed and the place is marked by an <b>empty</b> <b>element.</b> In cases where the L A T E X verbatim environment was used, it was manually decided whether or not such material counts as an image or as text.

5000|$|In XHTML, and XML, <b>empty</b> <b>elements</b> (elements that {{inherently}} have no content) are terminated {{by putting}} a slash {{at the end of}} the [...] "opening" [...] (only) tag, e.g. , , , etc. In HTML 4.01 and earlier, no slash is added to terminate the element. HTML5 does not require one, but it is often added for compatibility with XHTML and XML processing.|$|R
40|$|International audienceThe aim of {{this paper}} is to analyze the {{so-called}} " absolute inversion " construction 'V S' (verb + nominal inverted subject) in French, where no initial constituent is present in the kernel. My claim is that there are two types of absolute inversion: the absent initial constituent turns out to be either a zero constituent (as in Surgit alors un loup) or a void place (as in Est déclaré gagnant le numéro 1234). The article addresses the issue of the syntactic, semantic and pragmatic differences between these two types of absolute inversion, which correspond respectively to an " unaccusative " and to an " elaborative " inversion. In the former case, the zero constituent functions as an <b>empty</b> <b>element</b> that locates the process beyond the situation described in the preceding utterance. In the latter case, the void place of the first argument of the predicate is identified with the inverted subject...|$|E
40|$|A {{number of}} studies {{investigating}} second language acquisition (SLA) {{from the perspective of}} Principles and Parameters Theory (P&P, Chomsky, 1981, 1995) have focused on the pro-drop parameter, and have argued that older second language learners are sensitive to the different properties it purportedly covers (e. g., Al-Kasey & P??rez-Leroux, 1998; Liceras, 1989; Phinney, 1987; White, 1986). In this paper we extend this work by investigating two of its syntactic corollaries, namely, referential pronominal subjects (ProS) and expletive pronominal subjects (ExpS). In so-called [+pro-drop] languages both may be realised as an <b>empty</b> <b>element</b> (pro). While on the surface these forms are identical, referential subject pro is different from expletive subject pro both syntactically and semantically; syntactically because referential pro co-exists with a set of overt subject pronouns (yo ???I???, t?? ???you???, etc), whereas there are no overt expletive pronouns; semantically because referential pro is distinguished for 3 persons, number and gender features, whereas expletive pro would appear to be a third person, singular, gender-neutral pronoun. We will examine whether older L 2 learners are sensitive to these differences by using paired grammaticality judgement tests (PGJT). Results are consistent with the claim that learners have different mental representations for ProS and ExpS...|$|E

5000|$|HTML markup {{consists}} of several key components, including those called tags (and their attributes), character-based data types, character references and entity references. HTML tags most commonly come in pairs like [...] and , although some represent <b>empty</b> <b>elements</b> {{and so are}} unpaired, for example [...] The first tag in such a pair is the start tag, {{and the second is}} the end tag (they are also called opening tags and closing tags).|$|R
40|$|We examine {{effects that}} empty {{categories}} have on machine translation. <b>Empty</b> categories are <b>elements</b> in parse trees that lack corresponding overt surface forms (words) such as dropped pronouns and markers for control constructions. We start by training machine translation systems with manually inserted <b>empty</b> <b>elements.</b> We find that inclusion of some empty categories in training data improves the translation result. We expand the experiment by automatically inserting these elements {{into a larger}} data set using various methods and training on the modified corpus. We show that even when automatic prediction of null elements is not highly accurate, it nevertheless improves the end translation result. ...|$|R
5000|$|Milestones are <b>empty</b> <b>elements</b> {{that mark}} the {{beginning}} and end of a component. These can be used to embed a non-privileged structure within a hierarchical language, and can only represent contiguous overlap. Existing tools will also not understand the meaning of the milestone elements and so cannot easily process or validate the non-privileged structure. The markup being near the content is an advantage for maintainability and readability. CLIX [...] is an example of such an approach.|$|R

50|$|In {{the late}} 1990s the first {{reasonably}} powerful WYSIWYG editors {{arrived on the}} market, which meant Web designers no longer needed a technical understanding of HTML to build web pages. Such editors indirectly encourage extensive use of nested tables to position design elements. As designers edit their documents in these editors, unnecessary code and <b>empty</b> <b>elements</b> {{can be added to}} the document. Furthermore, unskilled designers may use tables more than required when using a WYSIWYG editor. This practice can lead to many tables nested within tables as well as tables with unnecessary rows and columns.|$|R
40|$|The {{interpretation}} of <b>empty</b> <b>elements,</b> i. e. signs {{that have no}} phonetic realization, constitutes a "classical" problem in modern linguistics. Null elements have been postulated on various levels of the linguistic system and its pragmatic use, in particular, in morphology and syntax. An adequate theory of discourse comprehension also requires an account of what is not said but only conversationally implicated. In {{the last thirty years}} the {{interpretation of}} empty subjects in non-finite clauses, which is known as the "control problem", has attracted the attention of many formal syntacticians. It has however become increasingly clear that the interpretation of such <b>empty</b> <b>elements</b> is only minimally guided by syntactic principles; in addition, a number of semantic and pragmatic factors have to be taken into consideration. The aim of our contribution is to sketch a cognitively based theory of "obligatory" control that explains how general control principles interact with language-specific coding devices. We focus on German data; we surmise, however, that they also hold for other languages. In particular, we aim at elucidating the interplay of syntactic, semantic and pragmatic information in the comprehension of empty subjects in non-finite complement clauses. Using German and, to a lesser extent, English examples, we will demonstrate that the control principles we postulate account for numerous control verbs and control verb classes...|$|R

30|$|We should {{therefore}} start by recognising the different sounds that exist and compose {{and create a}} new fabric in which the old cities, the built nodes, can become {{in a certain sense}} the components of a wider system. A system in which it is precisely the alternation and juxtaposition of different qualities that produces the rhythmic movement of the shape of a more complex kind of urbanity. A kind of authentic musical score in which there is space for sonorous moments to exist simultaneously, for full and <b>empty</b> <b>elements</b> to be brought together, swelling and pauses, slow and quick parts, deserted places and high density nodes.|$|R
30|$|By taking {{inspiration}} from the concept of polyphony, borrowed from music, it invites us not to standardise these diversities in a single time or on a single plane, but {{to use them to}} give life, through “weaving” and “mending” tasks, to an original composition: a polyphonic composition, in which the different qualities of the parts, though developing autonomously, can play simultaneously, so as to produce an unprecedented urban sound. A sound in which it is the contraction and expansion of spaces, the alternation of full and <b>empty</b> <b>elements,</b> the flights and refrains, deserted places and high intensity nodes that will determine the rhythmic course of the form.|$|R

We applied them to a verb movement analysis of the German main clause with right sentence bracket and to complement extra-position. To reduce the number of unnecessary hypotheses, we extended the licenser rule concept with a licenser binding technique.
