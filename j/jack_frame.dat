50|$|Microtunnel boring {{machines}} {{are very similar}} to tunnel {{boring machines}} (TBM) but on a smaller scale. These machines generally vary from 0.61 to 1.5 m but smaller and larger machines have existed. Usually the operator controls the machine from a control room {{on the surface of the}} ground. The Microtunneling machine and <b>jacking</b> <b>frame</b> are set up in a shaft at the required depth. The operator is given constant feedback about the machine’s location, orientation and hydraulic devices via a computer console or CCTV camera. Most machines also have video cameras set up to enable the operator to monitor activities in the jacking shaft and at the separation plant. The operator controls the MTBM and the <b>jacking</b> <b>frame</b> from the safety of the control room which is usually situated on the surface, next to the jacking shaft.|$|R
5000|$|In {{addition}} to the <b>jacking</b> <b>frame,</b> smaller <b>jacks,</b> called “interjacks”, may be inserted between sections of tunnel liner. These push the two sections of liner apart. Friction on the liner sections between the interjack and the tunnel entrance helps to prevent the liner from sliding out backwards. So while the liner behind the interjack does not move, those sections {{in front of it}} receive additional pushing force.|$|R
60|$|Wade {{watched this}} {{meeting of the}} rivals and enemies with an {{attention}} powerfully stimulated by the penetrating scrutiny Burley laid upon them. Jack did not speak quickly. He looked hard into the tense face of Moore. Wade detected a vibration of <b>Jack's</b> <b>frame</b> and a gleam of eye that showed him not wholly in control of exultation and revenge. Fear had not struck him yet.|$|R
5000|$|In most microtunneling {{operations}} {{the machine}} is launched through an entry eye and pipes are pushed behind the machine. This is a process often called pipe jacking and is repeated until the Microtunneling machine reaches the reception shaft. As the machine advances, more tunnel liner or pipe is pushed from the starting shaft, through the entry eye. Thus, {{the speed of the}} advancing machine is controlled by the speed at which the pipe is inserted into the entry eye via the extension of the hydraulic rams in the <b>jacking</b> <b>frame.</b>|$|R

2500|$|From late 2005, Friends of the Cerberus {{began to}} {{campaign}} for A$5.5 million in funding to stabilise the wreck site, first by installing additional supports for the deck and turrets (the latter weighing 200 tons each), then raising the ship off the seabed and placing her in an underwater cradle. To help attract funds from the Federal and Victorian governments, the wreck was nominated by Friends of the Cerberus and the National Trust for heritage listing, which was achieved on 14 December 2005; Cerberus was also listed on the Victorian Heritage Register and is included on the local Heritage Overlay. In July 2008, an application by Friends of the Cerberus for a grant of A$500,000 of federal funding was successful, with the National Trust of Victoria holding the funds on behalf of Friends of the Cerberus. The money was originally intended {{for the construction of}} a <b>jacking</b> <b>frame</b> and support cradle, but in late 2010, it was instead earmarked for structural preservation work on the monitor's gun turrets. By April 2012, the target of the funding had changed again, with plans to spend the grant on corrosion control of the wreck, along with [...] "interpretive devices" [...] on the nearby shore.|$|R
