Using income at the age of 28 to 30, we analyze if high-achievers have larger income premiums from entering university than low-achievers in a sample of Swedish upper secondary school students. We find that income differences generally are positive, albeit larger for females than for males. It is also found that the <b>income</b> <b>premium</b> is larger for high-achievers than for low-achievers.

40|$|Mobility {{serves as}} an {{indicator}} of the relationship between short and long run inequality. Understanding mobility is crucial for deriving policies that affect household’s incomes. Since long run income is more equally distributed than short run income {{it is important to understand}} the mechanics of income mobility. In this paper we have used a unique household dataset spanning more than 3 decades from rural India to derive what may be broadly classified as the triggers of income mobility. We believe and wish to show that location and outcome of location place a crucial role in determining the magnitude of income mobility. Given that in low income countries migration is a significant cause for income mobility, we show that its magnitude is influenced by the relationship between <b>income</b> <b>premium</b> (benefits accruing to the household due to location) and migration. There is thus a three way relationship between <b>income</b> <b>premium,</b> migration and income mobility. We find that increases in household <b>income</b> <b>premium</b> will reduce the likely hood of a given household (members of that household migrating). Consequently we are more likely to observe a reduction in overall income mobility. A policy implication of this finding is that if development is not uniform across the economic space. Income mobility will decline in the long run...|$|E

Frequently, the return to an additional year of schooling is larger for females than for males. For Serbia, for example, the return to an additional year of education is 8 % for females but only 5.5 % for males—which is consistent with previous evidence (Blunch and Sulla 2010; Staneva et al. 2010). 21 The evidence on returns to ownership is mixed across countries, though frequently there is not much of an association. For Kazakhstan and Serbia, for example, there is no statistical difference across ownership status. Having no written contract (reference: written contract) is associated with an income penalty, though not always statistically significantly so. The “Don’t know”/“Refuse” category again experiences a negative return in several cases—and both substantively and statistically significantly so for the cases of Serbian and Moldovan males.

30|$|From {{the results}} from these {{augmented}} Mincer (OLS) regressions, {{it can be seen}} that the estimated coefficients are indeed frequently statistically insignificant due to the frequently quite small cell sizes (Table  10 in Appendix 2). Additionally, however, the results also reveal that men receive an <b>income</b> <b>premium</b> in traditional male-dominated industries such as mining, manufacturing, and construction—whereas there does not seem to be any such patterns for women. For occupation, the dummies are largely statistically insignificant. These results thus provides some, though arguably limited, evidence on selection and sorting into industry—if not occupation—in these countries. Given the small cell sizes and therefore frequently statistically insignificant results, it again seems prudent to continue with the more parsimonious specification estimated previously for the remainder of this analysis.|$|E

The counterargument is based on game-theoretical model developed in Bowles 2004. The inevitable incompleteness of contracts results in allocation inefficiency: agents with above average wealth endowment are able to finance larger projects, and/or projects of worse than average quality, while agents with insufficient initial wealth endowment are excluded from the financial market. This inefficiency can be attenuated only by redistribution enforced by the government.

40|$|In Zimbabwe {{due to the}} skewed {{distribution}} of land in favour of the large-scale commercial farmers the topic on land redistribution has always been high on agenda since the country gained its Independence. The major arguments {{in support of the}} land reforms are the historical grievance that the native population was disposed off their ancestral land. This argument has been the major issue in almost all political circles. Other arguments that have been raised for land reforms in Zimbabwe include the need to reduce population pressure in the communal areas and the need to economically empower the indigenous population. Recent developments in Zimbabwe s land question has also shown that the land reforms {{can be used as a}} survival strategy by serving governments during critical election times. All these issues point to the idea that the land reform in Zimbabwe is of paramount importance given its various political dimensions. Since 1980 the Government of Zimbabwe has attempted to deal with the land inequality. The main land reform policy the Government has relied on is trans-location resettlement of the communal farmers. This policy is broadly divided into two parts the land acquisition stage, which is followed by the land allocation process. In both stages the government s efforts has yielded poor results given that set targets. Much of poor progress of the resettlement programmes has been attributed to the legal framework governing the land acquisition stage. The Government s capacity to acquire land from the large-scale commercial farmers has limited by legal framework that provides that any land acquisition is supposed to be on a willing-buy-willing-seller basis. This has seen several constitutional amendments to enable the Government to achieve its goals. The poor performance of Zimbabwe s land reform has also been attributed to the fact that the Government has been caught up in a situation where it has to satisfy different economic groups with diverging interest. While the Government realises the need to redistribute the land from the large-scale commercial farmers this is compromised by the idea that it strongly doubts the ability of the beneficiaries of the land reform to efficiently utilise the land. Proceeding with land reform on this note would adversely affect the agricultural sector, and would dent the confidence the large-scale farmers have in the government. While there are several reasons that could explain the poor performance of the land reform this study tries to identify the problems that would arise if the land reforms were pursued on purely market basis. It gives a theoretical perspective of trying to implement the land reforms on the willing-buyer-willing-seller basis. The main result is that the two farming sectors, the large-scale commercial farmers and the communal farmers have different values for the same piece of land. The value of agriculture land to communal farmers is below the reservation price for the large-scale commercial farmers and the study looks at the possible economic justification of this phenomenon. The argument central in this study are that the large-scale commercial farmers receive some benefits from the land use and ownership that do not accrue to the communal farmers. Firstly, the large-scale commercial farmers because they have title of ownership over their agriculture land they can use the land to secure the granting of credit on the financial market. This feature is not observable on communal agriculture. As a result the large-scale commercial farmers have preferential access to productivity enhancing inputs compared to the communal farmers. The result is that the large-scale commercial farmers are more productive, and receive more income from agriculture land compared to the communal farmers. The extra income the communal farmers derive due to their exclusive access to credit is referred to in the study as the collateral <b>income</b> <b>premium.</b> Secondly, the large land holdings of large-scale commercial agriculture enables the commercial farmers to use some technology that is not applicable on communal farming land. This is because there either spatial limitations to using the technology, or it would not be profitable for the communal farmer to invest in such technology due to the small land size. This suggests the large-scale commercial farmers receive some economies of farm size <b>income</b> <b>premium</b> since they are more productive because of this technological advantage. The economies farm size <b>income</b> <b>premium</b> is also explained by the idea that large-scale commercial farmers have some monopsony power in the agriculture labour market through their affiliation as the Commercial Farmers Union. The monopsony power enables them to collect some economic rent, and this adds to the economies of farm size <b>income</b> <b>premium.</b> Lastly, the large scale commercial farmers receives some non-pecuniary benefits from the their land ownership. Being an important sector in the economy they tend to have some economic power, which is a source of political power from which they derive some political rent. Also being in the class of landowners should give them some class status and privileges that yield some utility and they place some value on this utility. Thus the large-scale commercial farmers have some non-pecuniary <b>income</b> <b>premium</b> that do not accrue to the communal farmers due to the size of their land holdings and nature of tenure modelling. Given the three issues raised, it is evident that the large-scale commercial farmers get more income from agriculture land compared to the communal farmers. Assuming that the two farming sectors formulate their land values using on basis of the income capitalised in the land, the large farmers will value the land more than the communal farmers will. On this note it will not be possible for the communal farmers to purchase land from the large-scale commercial farmers. If the market system can not redistribute land due to the disparities in land values for the two farming systems, the study proposes a solution in which there could be some intervention by subsidising the communal farmers. What is important is that the amount of subsidy negatively depends on the size of the small farming units that result from the petitioning of the large-scale farms. There is also need to reconsider the laws that govern sub-division of farms as these prevent the large scale commercial farms from selling off the less intensively used portions of their farms if these command a higher price to the smaller farmers...|$|E

The aim of this policy was to attract high quality workers to the public sector, and to counteract the problem of "brain drain", the loss of high-skilled workers to abroad. To study the effects on the public-private income gap - and on high-skilled workers in particular - we employ empirical methods that allow us to take differences in the entire wage distribution (quantile regressions), workforce and firm composition (decomposition), as well as various potential biases into account. Our results indicate that there is a large <b>income</b> <b>premium</b> in favor of the private sector at the higher end of the income distribution, especially once we account for worker and firm characteristics, which suggests that the same person earns substantially less in the public sector.

40|$|Motivated by a novel stylized fact - {{countries}} with isolated capital cities display worse quality of governance - we {{provide a framework}} of endogenous institutional choice {{based on the idea}} that elites are constrained by the threat of rebellion, and that this threat is rendered less effective by distance from the seat of political power. In established democracies, the threat of insurgencies is not a binding constraint, and the model predicts no correlation between isolated capitals and misgovernance. In contrast, a correlation emerges in equilibrium in the case of autocracies. Causality runs both ways: broader power sharing (associated with better governance) means that any rents have to be shared more broadly, hence the elite has less of an incentive to protect its position by isolating the capital city; conversely, a more isolated capital city allows the elite to appropriate a larger share of output, so the costs of better governance for the elite, in terms of rents that would have to be shared, are larger. We show evidence that this pattern holds true robustly in the data. We also show that isolated capitals are associated with less power sharing, a larger <b>income</b> <b>premium</b> enjoyed by capital city inhabitants, and lower levels of military spending by ruling elites, as predicted by the theory...|$|E
