60|$|This {{no doubt}} is a {{caricature}} of the case, but <b>it</b> <b>will</b> <b>serve</b> <b>to</b> illustrate my contention that until we possess a far more subtle and thorough analysis of the drunkard's physique and mind--if {{it really is a}} distinctive type of mind and physique--than we have at present, we have no justification whatever in artificial intervention to increase whatever eliminatory process may at present be going on in this respect. Even {{if there is such a}} specific weakness, it is possible it has a period of maximum intensity, and if that should be only a brief phase in development--let us say at adolescence--it might turn out to be much more to the advantage of humanity to contrive protective legislation over the dangerous years.
