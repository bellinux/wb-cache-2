After her death, the Homer {{city council}} passed a new resolution banning the feeding of eagles, crows, ravens and other predatory and scavenger birds by any person, effective March 19, 2009. The resolution's effective date was delayed until spring out of concern that the birds would either die of starvation or become highly aggressive if the feeding ended {{in the middle of}} winter.

40|$|An {{exploratory}} study of ninety-five <b>hotels</b> <b>that</b> rebranded or rescaled their operations revealed {{the possibility of}} long-term financial benefit after the change. In many cases the hotels saw an initial decline in financial results, but {{that was followed by}} a gradual recovery. <b>Hotels</b> <b>that</b> moved upscale generally saw increases in average daily rates. <b>Hotels</b> <b>that</b> merely changed brands without also changing their scale reported no significant change in financial results...|$|R
40|$|As many as {{one-third of}} U.

Using data collected between 1994 and 2012 from PKF Hospitality Research, an analysis of brand conversions by 260 <b>hotels</b> shows <b>that</b> <b>hotels</b> moving downscale generally improved their occupancy, and thus their top-line revenue and profit ratios, compared to a control group of 2, 750 <b>hotels</b> <b>that</b> did not change brands. However, <b>hotels</b> <b>that</b> moved upscale did not see notable changes in revenue or profit, nor did <b>hotels</b> <b>that</b> moved across their tier, especially when they stayed within their brand family. Two factors seem to drive the financial results for converted hotels—the relative strength of the brand and the fit between the brand and the property...|$|R

During this they broke windows in a local <b>hotel</b> <b>that</b> was accused of serving alcohol. To punish Gaddafi, the authorities expelled {{him and his family}} from Sabha. Gaddafi moved to Misrata, there attending Misrata Secondary School. Maintaining his interest in Arab nationalist activism, he refused to join any of the banned political parties active in the city—including the Arab Nationalist Movement, the Arab Socialist Ba'ath Party, and the Muslim Brotherhood—claiming that he rejected factionalism. He read voraciously on the subjects of Nasser and the French Revolution of 1789, as well as the works of Syrian political theorist Michel Aflaq and biographies of Abraham Lincoln, Sun Yat-sen, and Mustafa Kemal Atatürk.|$|E
5|$|In 1940, Cluj, {{along with}} the rest of Northern Transylvania, became part of Miklós Horthy's Hungary through the Second Vienna Award arbitrated by Nazi Germany and Fascist Italy. After the Germans {{occupied}} Hungary in March 1944 and installed a puppet government under Döme Sztójay, they forced large-scale antisemitic measures in the city. The headquarters of the local Gestapo were located in the New York <b>Hotel.</b> <b>That</b> May, the authorities began the relocation of the Jews to the Iris ghetto. Liquidation of the 16,148 captured Jews occurred through six deportations to Auschwitz in May–June 1944. Despite facing severe sanctions from the Hungarian administration, some Jews escaped across the border to Romania, with the assistance of intellectuals such as Emil Hațieganu, Raoul Șorban, Aurel Socol and Dezső Miskolczy, as well as various peasants from Mănăștur.|$|E
40|$|This paper {{examines}} small <b>hotels</b> <b>that</b> {{have some}} type of environmental certification. A survey of 210 small (less than 50 employees) Catalonian hotels was conducted to investigate whether there are significant differences in the results of the implementation practices between <b>hotels</b> <b>that</b> adopt these certifications due to environmental pressure (from the government, customers, suppliers and other stakeholders) and <b>hotels</b> <b>that</b> voluntarily commit to green policies. Significant differences were identified in the results on the hotels when structural equation modelling (SEM) was undertaken. This investigation suggests <b>that</b> <b>hotels</b> <b>that</b> voluntarily commit to green policies obtain better results than other hotels. The conclusion is that governments must not only regulate, but also promote awareness actions in small and medium-sized (SME) tourism companies to improve the environment. SME tourism companies must understand that both the environment and they themselves will benefit...|$|R

When Olivia and Charlie discuss the victims with Dr. Levin, he is able to identify their culprit as Milo (Michael Eklund), a patient taking an experimental drug to boost his IQ exponentially. Though released to care of his sole remaining family member Madeline (Kacey Rohl), he was scheduled to return to reverse the process for his own health and safety. Dr. Levin identifies all three victims as those charged to return Milo to the center, the last victim only having been selected the day before. They visit Madeline, who worries for the safety of her brother. She explains that Milo is able to predict the outcome of numerous events to the smallest detail, and only by showing him a toy horse, a connection to their deceased parents, can she break Milo's concentration. She provides Olivia and Charlie the location of the <b>hotel</b> <b>that</b> Milo is staying at.|$|E
