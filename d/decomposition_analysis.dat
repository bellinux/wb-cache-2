To examine whether the results are robust to the age specification, the analysis is therefore also carried out restricted to only males 25 – 64 years of age. The results again are quite similar, again most notably leading to very similar estimated coefficients in the Mincer regressions and, therefore, also very similar to results in the <b>decompositions</b> <b>analysis.</b>|$|R

5000|$|Some {{articles}} have brought evidence that wages differ across areas {{in different countries}} using a <b>decomposition</b> <b>analysis</b> of the mean wage. [...] In 1992, Reilly used this decomposition technique to decompose wage differentials between 6 local labour markets in the UK. The decomposition allows to decompose mean wage differences into two parts, one which is the consequence of individual characteristics in those 6 labour markets {{and the other one}} which is due to unexplained differences. The author finds that the differences in wages between labour markets is at around 20%, and that between Aberdeen and Rochdale, 50% of this difference is explained by workers' characteristics, the other part is not explained. The unexplained differences can be thought of being consequences of differences in local areas attractiveness. Though this author does not give any evidence that this is the case. Similar results are obtained by García and Molina for Spain with data from 1994Pereira and Galego analysed wage differentials in Portugal using dynamics.

One of the primary issues is their generation of sector-biased income transfers and expenditures on health, housing and education, which [...] "not only distort economic incentives of the workers in the sectors, but will also affect the human-capital attainments of their children, which may further widen the rural-urban income gap." [...] In other words, inland and rural inequality can help create a vicious cycle by funneling money towards the coastal cities and away from investments in human capital elsewhere. Like in the United States, education funding is primarily the responsibility of local governments in China. As poor localities are less able to fund these services and poor households are less able to afford the high private cost of basic education, China has seen an increase in the inequality of education outcomes. “For example, in 1998, per pupil expenditure in Beijing was 12 times that in Guizhou, and the difference jumped to 15 times in 2001.” ...|$|E

The main policy implication contained in these results implies that foreign money should not be included in transactions oriented measures of money supply that are used as targets when implementing a monetary policy.
