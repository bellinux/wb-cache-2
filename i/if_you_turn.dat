Mack Flenniken also followed coach McMillin, {{as well as}} Cal Hubbard, {{the only}} person inducted into the Pro Football and Baseball Halls of Fame and Centenary's first All-American, at both schools. Georgia Tech coach Bill Alexander once watched Centenary when it was in Atlanta to play Oglethorpe.

500|$|In May 2011, Gaga {{said her}} [...] "emotional connection" [...] {{with the song}} was difficult. When she was {{asked if it was}} because the song was {{originally}} written for Britney Spears, she answered: [...] "Well that’s not exactly what happened, but I don’t want to delve into that. I could delve into it <b>if</b> <b>you</b> <b>turn</b> that (motions to recorder) off... But ultimately the mix and the process of getting the production finished was very stressful for me. So when I say it’s my worst song {{it has nothing to do}} with the song, just my emotional connection to it." ...|$|E
500|$|A {{week before}} the final Cardiff played Ipswich Town in the 2011–12 Football League Championship – it was their last match before the final, which they lost 3–0. Cardiff had a few injury {{concerns}} ahead of the final. Captain Mark Hudson had a calf problem, while midfielder Stephen McPhail had missed Cardiff's last four matches as {{he was suffering from}} Sjögren's syndrome, an immune system disorder. Goalkeeper Heaton was also a doubt with a knock on his ankle, but he was considered likely to start the match. Cardiff manager Malky Mackay acknowledged that Liverpool went into the match as favourites, but he was confident his team could provide a shock: [...] "Obviously we are underdogs but we have a chance in the final, Maybe only a one in 10 chance but that's still a chance <b>if</b> <b>you</b> <b>turn</b> up motivated, fit and organised and I think I can promise that." ...|$|E

500|$|A stained smiley {{face is a}} {{recurring}} image in the story, appearing in many forms. In The System of Comics, Thierry Groensteen described the symbol as {{a recurring}} motif that produces [...] "rhyme and remarkable configurations" [...] by appearing in key segments of Watchmen, notably {{the first and last}} pages of the series—spattered with blood on the first, and sauce from a hamburger on the last. Groensteen cites it as one form of the circle shape that appears throughout the story, as a [...] "recurrent geometric motif" [...] and due to its symbolic connotations. Gibbons created a smiley face badge as an element of The Comedian's costume in order to [...] "lighten" [...] the overall design, later adding a splash of blood to the badge to imply his murder. Gibbons said the creators came to regard the blood-stained smiley face as [...] "a symbol for the whole series", noting its resemblance to the Doomsday Clock ticking up to midnight. Moore drew inspiration from psychological tests of behaviorism, explaining that the tests had presented the face as [...] "a symbol of complete innocence". With the addition of a blood splash over the eye, the face's meaning was altered to become simultaneously radical and simple enough for the first issue's cover to avoid human detail. Although most evocations of the central image were created on purpose, others were coincidental. Moore mentioned in particular that [...] "the little plugs on the spark hydrants, <b>if</b> <b>you</b> <b>turn</b> them upside down, you discover a little smiley face".|$|E
500|$|Back home, Kennedy {{played with}} the Port Colborne Sailors of the OHA Sr. league for the 1942–43 hockey season. The Port Colborne coach was former NHL star and Hall of Fame inductee Nels Stewart who had been hired in November. Stewart became a mentor to Kennedy, working on his playmaking skills. Kennedy credits Stewart with {{teaching}} him how to [...] "operate {{in front of the}} net". Kennedy finished the season second in the league, only one point behind scoring champion, Dillon Brady of Hamilton. It was during this time that Kennedy debuted as a player at Maple Leaf Gardens. OHA senior teams played at the Gardens on Friday evenings and this included Kennedy and the Port Colborne Sailors. At the end of the season, in early February 1943, in spite of his having abandoned the Royals, Montreal scout Gus Ogilvie was sent to induce Kennedy to sign a contract with the promise that if he signed, he would finish the season with the Canadiens in the NHL. Concerned about his treatment in Montreal, he declined, despite being warned by Ogilvie, [...] "Well, you know, Ted, <b>if</b> <b>you</b> <b>turn</b> pro, {{it will have to be}} with the Canadiens." [...] Kennedy now thought his dreams of playing in the NHL were over. However, Nels Stewart believed in Kennedy, considering him [...] "a coming great", and recommended him to the Toronto Maple Leafs. Shortly thereafter, Kennedy was called out of his grade 11 Latin class to the Principal's office. Kennedy, the high school student, was at first worried about what he may have done wrong, but it turned out to be a phone call from Nels Stewart. Stewart had arranged a meeting with General Manager of the Leafs Frank Selke and Kennedy had to travel immediately to Toronto. Unlike Montreal, the Maple Leafs had someone there to meet Kennedy when he got off the train. Kennedy signed a contract that evening.|$|E
2500|$|After sailing {{far enough}} for safety, Every gave the non-conspirators {{a chance to}} go ashore, even deferentially {{offering}} to let Captain Gibson command the ship if he would join their cause. According to Charles Ellms, Every's words to Gibson were, [...] "if you have a mind to make one of us, we will receive you; and <b>if</b> <b>you</b> <b>turn</b> sober, and attend to business, perhaps in time I may make you up of my lieutenants; if not, here's a boat, and you shall be set on shore." [...] The captain declined and was set ashore with several other sailors. The only man who was prevented from voluntarily leaving was the ship's surgeon, whose services were deemed too important to forgo. All of the men left on board the Charles II unanimously elected Every captain of the ship. Some reports say that Every was much ruder in his dealings with Captain Gibson, but agree that he at least offered him the position of second mate. In either case, Every exhibited an amount of gentility and generosity in his operation of the mutiny that indicates his motives were not mere adventure.|$|E

2500|$|Later in 2010, for the Neuberger Museum of Art in Purchase, New York, {{she created}} a {{retrospective}} exhibition [...] "Spine, Chapter 20", of new pieces. Unlike all previous Chapters, this exhibit did not incorporate {{the specifics of}} the venue, instead reflecting upon all of her work to date. Together the Chapters form a figurative book – an overarching structure for all the paintings. [...] "The installation itself has a 'spine': an 80-foot wall extending from one corner of the room, on which most of the roughly 30 paintings are hung, creating a sense of space — even emptiness, <b>if</b> <b>you</b> <b>turn</b> your attention toward the walls where paintings are customarily hung in the Neuberger." [...] according to the New York Times critic Martha Schwendener. Pieces in this chapter pull elements from all her previous chapters, such as [...] "Distracting Distance / Hardy", in which a nude woman {{stands in front of the}} Marcel Breuer window at the Whitney. [...] "Spine, Chapter 20" [...] also provided the final chapter of an impressive physical book - the retrospective she published in 2011, Spine, with 380 color illustrations.|$|E
