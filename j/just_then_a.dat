5|$|Finn and Jake {{awake in}} a prison cell full of bananas, {{confused}} and unaware of how they arrived at their location. A demonic prison guard tells {{them that they are}} in the Nightosphere, the hellish realm ruled by Marceline's (voiced by Olivia Olson) father, Hunson Abadeer (voiced by Martin Olson). The two set off to locate Marceline's father and navigate back to their home dimension. Traversing the Nightosphere, Finn and Jake learn that they need to seek an audience with Hunson Abadeer if they want to leave. Eventually, they reach a line composed of demons who seek petitions from their demonic overlord. <b>Just</b> <b>then,</b> <b>a</b> storm cloud appears in a mist, slaying all the demons present; Finn and Jake barely escape death.|$|E
25|$|Śrībhārgavamithilāgamanam (Sanskrit: श्रीभार्गवमिथिलागमनम्) In {{only her}} sixth year, Sītā's {{appearance}} {{is like that}} of a sixteen-year-old. Her beauty is described by the poet in 12 verses (13.9–13.20). Janaka realizes that his daughter is the Ādi Śakti of Rāma and no ordinary girl, as she can drag the onerous bow of Śiva as a child. He is concerned about Sītā getting a deserving husband. He thinks about the doctrine of Avatāra, having heard verses about it in the Vedas, but his intellect and rationalism make him not believe it. After much contemplation, he concludes that the doctrine must be true. <b>Just</b> <b>then,</b> <b>a</b> doorkeeper announces the arrival of Paraśurāma in Mithilā. Janaka bows down to Paraśurāma. Knowing Janaka to be a noble king, Paraśurāma does not consider him to be his enemy, unlike the despotic Kṣatriyas. Paraśurāma expresses his wish to see Sītā. Janaka leads him to the sacrificial assembly (Yajñaśālā), where Paraśurāma sees Sītā playing with the bow of Śiva by dragging it like a play-horse. Paraśurāma asks Janaka to hold a Svayaṃvara for Sītā in which the prince who breaks the bow of Śiva will have the right to marry Sītā. Paraśurāma further predicts that Rāma, the descendant of Raghu, will break the bow. Paraśurāma tells Janaka that he will arrive again in Mithilā, pretending to be angry, so that he can have an excuse of seeing both Sītā and Rāma. At the end of the canto Paraśurāma bows to the child Sītā and starts to praise her.|$|E
500|$|Holly {{possesses}} {{a piece of}} paper with [...] "ARPANET/WHTCORPS" [...] written on it. Byers realizes that the words refer to the Defense Department's computer network, which she requests he hack into. Byers, at the time an unquestioningly loyal government employee, complies after great reluctance. He finds an encrypted file on her daughter, named Susanne Modeski. <b>Just</b> <b>then,</b> <b>a</b> man whom Holly claims to be her boyfriend passes by Byers' booth—Mulder.|$|E
60|$|<b>Just</b> <b>then</b> <b>an</b> exclamation of {{surprise}} escaped from his comrade.|$|R
60|$|She looked round. <b>Just</b> <b>then</b> <b>an</b> English voice spoke {{behind her}} and me.|$|R

500|$|Yeul {{explains}} {{that every time}} the timeline is changed, the resulting shock kills her; Caius has been driven mad by watching her die repeatedly and seeks to end the process by unleashing the Chaos trapped in Valhalla to destroy all time. Serah, it is revealed, has the same power, and risks death every time she changes the future. Resolving to go on, Serah breaks free of her dream-world and frees Noel from his, {{in which he is}} the last living human after his Yeul dies and Caius leaves for Valhalla. After briefly encountering Lightning, the pair fight Caius, first in 500 AF Academia and then in Valhalla. As they defeat him, he claims to have killed Lightning, then impales himself through the heart on Noel's blade, killing the weakened Etro. When the pair return to Academia in 500 AF, where Vanille and Fang have been rescued from the collapsing pillar and the new Cocoon, named [...] "Bhunivelze", has risen, Serah dies in front of Noel and Hope from the shock of the future changing. <b>Just</b> <b>then,</b> <b>a</b> black cloud erupts from the sky as the Chaos that Etro was keeping trapped breaks free. Lightning is then shown in crystal stasis on the throne of Etro's temple. If the player completes all [...] optional parts of the game, they are shown an additional scene in which Caius is on the throne, declaring that the goddess is gone for good, and that Yeul and he can begin a new life freed from their 'curses'.|$|E
2500|$|<b>Just</b> <b>then,</b> <b>a</b> shot {{is heard}} from the wharf and {{everyone}} enters. [...] Wilfred, with the jester's corroboration, declares that he struggled with someone creeping about, discovered it was Colonel Fairfax, who dove into the river, and seizing an arquebus, Wilfred shot him dead. The Lieutenant orders the Yeomen {{to search for the}} body, and Wilfred is celebrated as a hero. Elsie, Fairfax, Phoebe and Point are left alone, and Point asks Elsie, as she is now free, to marry him. [...] Fairfax, still disguised as [...] "Leonard", tells Point that he doesn't know how to woo (it is not {{to be done in the}} manner of a jester!), and he undertakes to instruct Point in this art, following this up with a most effective demonstration on Elsie. [...] Point, slow to see that Fairfax is wooing the girl for himself (and that Elsie has fallen for the heroic [...] "Leonard"), finally protests. [...] Fairfax tells Point that he has shown him how to woo and that he should apply the teachings [...] "elsewhere". Phoebe, seeing her adored Fairfax pledged to another, bursts into tears, while Point, shocked by the turn of events, wishes he was dead.|$|E
60|$|<b>Just</b> <b>then</b> <b>a</b> lady {{entered the}} shop, and {{approached}} the counter hurriedly.|$|E
6000|$|<b>Just</b> <b>then</b> <b>an</b> {{important}} message came for Mr. Winslow, {{and he had}} to hurry away, but Mr. Castleford still remained, and presently said, ...|$|R
6000|$|<b>Just</b> <b>then</b> <b>an</b> exulting shout rang {{through the}} house, many feet scuttled upstairs, knocks hailed upon the door, and many voices shouted, 'Mr Audley! Felix, Clem, Mr. Audley!' ...|$|R
60|$|<b>Just</b> <b>then</b> <b>an</b> officer {{emerged from}} the tiny cabin. He reprimanded the warrior for conversing with the prisoner, nor would he himself reply to any of her inquiries.|$|R
60|$|<b>Just</b> <b>then</b> <b>a</b> negro boy entered, and {{announced}} that Mas'r's room was ready.|$|E
60|$|<b>Just</b> <b>then</b> <b>a</b> burly {{policeman}} came lounging along. Richard {{touched him}} on the arm.|$|E
60|$|<b>Just</b> <b>then</b> <b>a</b> {{little black}} terrier came {{bounding}} forward and frisked round the Captain.|$|E
60|$|<b>Just</b> <b>then</b> <b>an</b> {{officer of}} the ship, in his {{walk up and down}} the deck, passed near to where Rollo was sitting, and Rollo instinctively {{determined}} to ask him.|$|R
60|$|<b>Just</b> <b>then</b> <b>an</b> unwonted {{swimming}} sensation {{came over}} Ian; his great strength seemed suddenly to dissipate, and the bear, the claw collar, even Elsie, faded utterly from his mind.|$|R
60|$|<b>Just</b> <b>then</b> <b>an</b> {{exclamation from}} Anteek {{attracted}} general attention. He {{pointed to a}} mound {{of snow on the}} ice a short way {{to the left of the}} track which had a peculiar shape.|$|R
60|$|<b>Just</b> <b>then</b> <b>a</b> man {{further back}} along the line flung out a {{pointing}} hand.|$|E
60|$|<b>Just</b> <b>then</b> <b>a</b> bell sounded; {{people began}} hurrying away. The girl {{came up to}} Rosek.|$|E
60|$|<b>Just</b> <b>then</b> <b>a</b> bell {{above the}} throne rang briskly, and the King gave another nervous jump.|$|E
60|$|She sighed. Pamela <b>just</b> <b>then</b> was <b>a</b> {{picture of}} {{engaging}} humility.|$|R
60|$|<b>Just</b> <b>then</b> <b>an</b> exclamation {{was heard}} {{at the door}} of the hovel. Long Orrick {{released}} his hold hastily, and turning round, observed a round ruddy visage scowling at him, and the glittering barrel of a pistol levelled at his head.|$|R
60|$|<b>Just</b> <b>then</b> <b>an</b> object {{among the}} grass {{at his feet}} {{attracted}} his attention. Stooping, {{he picked it up}} and found it to be a scalping-knife!-- dropped, probably, long before by some passing Indians or voyageurs, for it was very rusty.|$|R
60|$|<b>Just</b> <b>then</b> <b>a</b> fusillade {{broke from}} the thickets, nipping the {{branches}} from the cottonwoods about them.|$|E
60|$|<b>Just</b> <b>then</b> <b>a</b> savage rose in {{the stern}} of the canoe and poised a short spear.|$|E
60|$|<b>Just</b> <b>then</b> <b>a</b> man {{passed in}} a buggy, and looked sourly at my friend the Liberal worker.|$|E
60|$|Tom Gallwey, {{somewhat}} lightly dressed, {{drove up}} <b>just</b> <b>then</b> in <b>a</b> waggon piled with grain bags.|$|R
60|$|The {{girl did}} not finish, for <b>just</b> <b>then</b> <b>an</b> {{automobile}} swung {{around the corner}} and came to a halt in front of a store near which the young people had halted. The automobile contained Merwell, Jasniff, and two other students of the Academy, all attired in the cadet uniforms of that institution.|$|R
5|$|The trio {{arrives in}} Buenos Aires, where Governor Don Fernando d'Ibarra y Figueroa y Mascarenes y Lampourdos y Souza asks to marry Cunégonde. <b>Just</b> <b>then,</b> <b>an</b> alcalde (a Spanish {{fortress}} commander) arrives, pursuing Candide for killing the Grand Inquisitor.

60|$|<b>Just</b> <b>then</b> <b>a</b> {{man came}} {{running into the}} hall and {{addressed}} the Prince after making a low bow.|$|E
60|$|She made no reply, for, {{despite the}} warm woollen shawl round her shoulders, she had {{suddenly}} felt cold, and a curious shiver had gone right through her body, even whilst her future lord did kiss her. But {{no doubt it}} was because <b>just</b> <b>then</b> <b>an</b> owl had hooted in the poplar trees far away.|$|R
60|$|<b>Just</b> <b>then</b> arrived <b>a</b> sister, {{sent by the}} Mother Prioress, {{to invite}} the ladies to supper in her own apartments.|$|R
