40|$|We have {{designed}} <b>DNA</b> <b>fusion</b> vaccines able to induce {{high levels of}} epitope-specific CD 8 + T cells, using linked CD 4 + T cell help. Such vaccines can activate effective immunity against tumor Ags. To model performance against minor histocompatibility (H) Ags important in allogeneic hemopoietic stem cell transplantation, responses against the H 2 Db-restricted Uty and Smcy male HY epitopes have been investigated. Vaccination of females induced high levels of tetramer-specific, IFN-{gamma}-producing CD 8 + T cells against each epitope. Vaccines incorporating a single epitope primed effector CTL able to kill male splenocytes in vitro and in vivo, and HYDbUty-specific vaccination accelerated rejection of syngeneic male skin grafts. Priming against either epitope established long-term memory, expandable by injection of male cells. Expanded CD 8 + T cells remained specific for the priming HY epitope, with responses to the second suppressed. To investigate vaccine performance in a tolerized repertoire, male mice were vaccinated with the fusion constructs. Strikingly, this also generated epitope-specific IFN-{gamma}-producing CD 8 + T cells with cytotoxic function. However, numbers and avidity were lower than in vaccinated females, and vaccinated males failed to reject CFSE-labeled male splenocytes in vivo. Nevertheless, these findings indicate that <b>DNA</b> <b>fusion</b> vaccines can mobilize CD 8 + T cells against endogenous minor H Ags, even from a profoundly tolerized repertoire. In the transplantation setting, vaccination of donors could prime and expand specific T cells for in vivo transfer.

40|$|We have {{developed}} novel <b>DNA</b> <b>fusion</b> vaccines encoding tumor Ags fused to pathogen-derived sequences. This strategy activates linked T cell help and, using fragment C of tetnus toxin, amplification of anti-tumor Ab, CD 4 +, and CD 8 + T cell responses is achievable in mice. However, {{there is concern}} that simple DNA vaccine injection may produce inadequate responses in larger humans. To overcome this, we tested electroporation as a method to increase the transfection efficiency and immune responses by these tumor vaccines in vivo in mice. Using a DNA vaccine expressing the CTL epitope AH 1 from colon carcinoma CT 26, we confirmed that effective priming and tumor protection in mice are highly dependent on vaccine dose and volume. However, suboptimal vaccination was rendered effective by electroporation, priming higher levels of AH 1 -specific CD 8 + T cells able to protect mice from tumor growth. Electroporation during priming with our optimal vaccination protocol did not improve CD 8 + T cell responses. In contrast, electroporation during boosting strikingly improved vaccine performance. The prime/boost strategy was also effective if electroporation was used at both priming and boosting. For Ab induction, DNA vaccination is generally less effective than protein. However, prime/boost with naked DNA followed by electroporation dramatically increased Ab levels. Thus, the priming qualities of <b>DNA</b> <b>fusion</b> vaccines, integrated with the improved Ag expression offered by electroporation, can be combined in a novel homologous prime/boost approach, to generate superior antitumor immune responses. Therefore, boosting may not require viral vectors, but simply a physical change in delivery, facilitating application to the cancer clinic...|$|E

40|$|To date, {{the success}} of cancer {{vaccines}} in human clinical trials has been limited. One {{of the reasons for}} this is the immunological tolerance to tumour antigens found in cancer patients. A novel <b>DNA</b> <b>fusion</b> vaccine design which links a pathogen-derived domain (DOM) of fragment C from tetanus toxin to a peptide epitope from a tumour antigen has been developed in our laboratory. The microbial sequence is able to activate a non-tolerised pool of helper T cells, providing T-cell help for immune induction against the linked tumour-specific sequence. The main aim of this project was to produce a therapeutic DNA vaccine against human papillomavirus (HPV) -associated cancers. A number of <b>DNA</b> <b>fusion</b> vaccines against the E 7 antigen from HPV 16 were constructed, including pDOM. E 749 - 57, which encodes a well described H- 2 Db-binding epitope from E 7 fused to the DOM sequence. CD 8 + T-cell responses to the vaccines were demonstrated using flow cytometry and functional assays. Importantly, these responses were stronger than those induced by a published synthetic long peptide strategy. In vivo tumour challenge experiments showed that DNA vaccines had a protective and therapeutic effect. The vaccines were then tested in transgenic mice which develop spontaneous E 7 -expressing tumours in a setting of tolerance. DNA vaccine-mediated E 7 -specific CD 8 + T-cell responses were successfully induced in these mice, together with a reduction in the mass of spontaneous tumours. This is the first demonstration of pDOM-epitope DNA vaccine-mediated therapy for spontaneous tumours and bodes well for translation into the clinic. One limiting factor for DNA vaccination in humans may be the delivery system. Electroporation (EP) is one approach which may overcome this. Therefore, a secondary aim of this project was to investigate the impact of EP on immune responses to DNA vaccination in more detail.

In the expressed chimeric proteins, the IL 2 and RA moieties were joined by a peptide sequence containing a proteolytic cleavage site.

In an in vitro cell free system the RA component was biologically active in all chimeric proteins produced since it specifically depurinated 28 S ribosomal RNA. Proteolytic cleavage of the chimeras with either trypsin or factor Xa as appropriate separated the IL 2 and RA moieties, {{but they did not}} remain covalently linked by a disulfide bond. Because of this, the cytotoxicity of protease-treated chimeras could not be assessed.

High yields of inclusion bodies were produced in E. coli and these could be refolded to form soluble proteins, using a range of buffers and non-detergent sulfobetaines. A purification protocol was developed, which afforded a one-step on-column refolding and simultaneous purification of the recombinant 6 xHis-tagged SUMO_cm-CrdS protein. The latter protein was digested by a specific protease to yield intact cm-CrdS in high yields.

40|$|PURPOSE: We have {{clinically}} evaluated a <b>DNA</b> <b>fusion</b> {{vaccine to}} target the HLA-A* 0201 binding peptide CAP- 1 from carcinoembryonic antigen (CEA 605 - 613 ) linked to an immunostimulatory domain (DOM) from fragment C of tetanus toxin Experimental Design: Twenty-seven patients with CEA-expressing carcinomas were recruited: 15 patients with measurable disease (Arm-I) and 12 patients without radiological evidence of disease (Arm-II). Six intramuscular vaccinations of naked DNA (1 mg/dose) were administered up to week 12. Clinical and immunological follow-up was to week 64 or clinical/radiological disease. RESULTS: DOM-specific immune responses demonstrated successful vaccine delivery. All patients without measurable disease compared to 60 % with advanced disease responded immunologically, while 58 % and 20 % expanded anti-CAP- 1 CD 8 + T-cells, respectively. CAP- 1 -specific T-cells were only detectable in the blood post-vaccination, but could also be identified in previously resected cancer tissue. The gastrointestinal adverse event diarrhea was reported by 48 % of patients and linked to more frequent decreases in CEA (p+ T-cell attack. CONCLUSIONS: Our data suggest that DNA vaccination is able to overcome peripheral tolerance in normal and tumor tissue and warrants testing in combination studies, for example, by vaccinating in parallel to treatment with an anti-PD 1 antibody...|$|E

This study observed the immune response induced by a HSP 65 DNA vaccine fused with UbGR against Mycobacterium tuberculosis. BALB/c mice were inoculated with HSP 65 DNA vaccine, UbGR-fused HSP 65 DNA vaccine (Ub-GR-HSP 65) and blank vector respectively. HSP 65 DNA vaccine elicited a Thl-polarized immune response. The Thl-type cytokine (IFN-γ) and proliferative T cell responses from spleen were improved significantly in UbGR-HSP 65 group, compared with those in HSP 65 DNA vaccine group. Furthermore, this <b>fusion</b> <b>DNA</b> vaccine also led to an in-creased ratio of IgG 2 a to IgGl and the cytotoxicity of T cells. IFN-γ intracellular staining of splenocytes indicated that UbGR-HSP 65 <b>fusion</b> <b>DNA</b> vaccine could activate CD 4 + and CD 8 + T cells, with much higher CD 8 + T cells. Thus, this study demonstrated that the UbGR fusion could improve HSP 65 -specific cellular immune responses, which is helpful to protect against TB infection...|$|R
40|$|G-quadruplexes are higher-order {{nucleic acid}} {{structures}} that can form in G-rich telomeres and promoter regions of oncogenes. Telomeric quadruplex stabilization by small molecules {{can lead to}} telomere uncapping, followed by DNA damage response and senescence, as well as chromosomal fusions leading to de-regulation of mitosis, followed by apoptosis and downregulation of oncogene expression. We report here on investigations into the mechanism of action of tetra-substituted naphthalene diimide ligands {{on the basis of}} cell biologic data together with a National Cancer Institute COMPARE study. We conclude that four principal mechanisms of action are implicated for these compounds: 1) telomere uncapping with subsequent DNA damage response and senescence; 2) inhibition of transcription/translation of onco-genes; 3) genomic instability through telomeric <b>DNA</b> end <b>fusions,</b> resulting in mitotic catastrophe and apoptosis; and 4) induction of chromosomal instability by telomere aggregate formation...|$|R
40|$|The {{heat shock}} genes of Bacillus subtilis are {{assigned}} to four classes {{on the basis of}} their regulation mechanisms. While classes I and III are negatively controlled by two different transcriptional repressors, class II is regulated by the alternative sigma factor σB. All heat shock genes with unidentified regulatory mechanisms, among them htpG, constitute class IV. Here, we show that expression of htpG is under positive control. We identified a DNA sequence (GAAAAGG) located downstream of the σA-dependent promoter of htpG. The heat inducibility of the promoter could be destroyed by inversion, nucleotide replacements, or removal of this <b>DNA</b> sequence. <b>Fusion</b> of this sequence to the vegetative lepA promoter conferred heat inducibility. Furthermore, we were able to show that the heat induction factor is dependent on the absolute temperature rather than the temperature increment and that nonnative proteins within the cytoplasm fail to induce htpG...|$|R
