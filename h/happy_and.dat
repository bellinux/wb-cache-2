5|$|A Slight Specimen of Moral Songs, such as I wish some <b>happy</b> <b>and</b> condescending genius would {{undertake}} {{for the use}} of children, {{and perform}} much better... The sense and subjects might be borrow'd plentifully from the Proverbs of Solomon, from all the common appearances of nature, from all the occurrences in the civil life, both in city and country: (which would also afford matter for other Divine Songs.) Here the language and measures should be easy and flowing with chearfulness, and without the solemnities of religion, or the sacred names of God and holy things; that children might find delight and profit together.|$|E
5|$|Bizet's {{marriage}} to Geneviève Halévy was intermittently <b>happy</b> <b>and</b> produced one son. After his death, his work, apart from Carmen, was generally neglected. Manuscripts were given away or lost, and published versions {{of his works}} were frequently revised and adapted by other hands. He founded no school and had no obvious disciples or successors. After years of neglect, his works began to be performed more frequently in the 20th century. Later commentators have acclaimed him as a composer of brilliance and originality whose premature death was a significant loss to French musical theatre.|$|E

5|$|Despite being {{currently}} {{portrayed as}} an underachiever, Bart was actually very <b>happy</b> <b>and</b> looking forward {{about going to}} school.

5|$|Poverty {{may have}} pushed Sien back into prostitution; the home became less <b>happy</b> <b>and</b> Van Gogh {{may have felt}} family life was irreconcilable with his artistic development. Sien gave her {{daughter}} to her mother, and baby Willem to her brother. Willem remembered visiting Rotterdam {{when he was about}} 12, when an uncle tried to persuade Sien to marry to legitimise the child. He believed Van Gogh was his father, but the timing of his birth makes this unlikely. Sien drowned herself in the River Scheldt in 1904.|$|E

5|$|Priestley {{wrote his}} most {{important}} philosophical works during his years with Lord Shelburne. In a series of major metaphysical texts published between 1774 and 1780—An Examination of Dr. Reid's Inquiry into the Human Mind (1774), Hartley's Theory of the Human Mind on the Principle of the Association of Ideas (1775), Disquisitions relating to Matter and Spirit (1777), The Doctrine of Philosophical Necessity Illustrated (1777), and Letters to a Philosophical Unbeliever (1780)—he argues for a philosophy that incorporates four concepts: determinism, materialism, causation, and necessitarianism. By studying the natural world, he argued, people would learn how to become more compassionate, <b>happy,</b> <b>and</b> prosperous.|$|E
5|$|Published {{commentators}} on the Roseberys {{claim their}} marriage was <b>happy,</b> <b>and</b> {{there is no}} known evidence that Hannah was anything other than happy in her marriage, and quite a lot to suggest she was indeed blissfully happy.

5|$|The {{film was}} adapted by the writer Nick Dear, who {{considered}} the story more mature than Austen's other novels. He characterised {{it as one}} of realism and truthfulness, particularly in telling the story of two people separated and then reunited. As Austen's narrative style conveys Anne's thoughts internally, Dear and Root felt compelled to express the character's emotions using comparatively little dialogue. Persuasion was shot in chronological order, allowing the actress to portray Anne's development from being downtrodden to <b>happy</b> <b>and</b> blossoming.|$|E

5|$|Despite the {{stresses}} that SCI places on people and relationships, {{studies have shown}} that people with SCI are able to have <b>happy</b> <b>and</b> fulfilling romantic relationships and marriages, and to raise well-adjusted children. People with SCI who wish to be parents may question their ability to raise children and opt not to have them, but studies have shown no difference in parenting outcomes between injured and uninjured groups. Children of women with SCI do not have worse self-esteem, adjustment, or attitudes toward their parents. Women who have children post-SCI have a higher quality of life, even though parenting adds demands and challenges to their lives.|$|E
5|$|His {{capital is}} {{believed}} to be somewhere in modern-day Haryana. Prithu used his Kshatriya power to make the earth yield its riches. Hence the earth is called Prithvi, daughter of Prithu. Prithu, by mere fiat of will, created millions of men, elephants, chariots and horses. During his reign, there was no decreptitude, no calamity, no famine, no disease, no agriculture and no mining. Prithu enjoyed popularity amongst his subjects, hence all kings are called Rajas. Cows yielded buckets of rich milk when they were touched. Trees and lotuses always had honey in them. People were healthy and <b>happy</b> <b>and</b> had no fear of thieves or wild animals. Nobody died of accidents. Kusha grass was golden in colour. Fruits were always sweet and ripe and nobody went hungry. People lived in houses or caves or trees or wherever they liked. For the first time, civilization and commerce came into existence.|$|E

As a nervous Homer watches the game at Moe's Tavern, Washington scores {{at the last second}} to win the game. Homer becomes <b>happy</b> <b>and</b> Bart tells Lisa that she still loves Homer, in which she agrees.
