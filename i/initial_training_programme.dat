50|$|Initial {{training}} {{to become a}} marine officer in the Netherlands lasts a total of 18 months, starting with an intensive 11 months of practical marine officer's training, regarded as the most demanding initial military training within the Dutch armed forces (POTOM - Praktische Opleiding tot Officier der Mariniers). This part of the <b>initial</b> <b>training</b> <b>programme</b> is modular, which means that it {{is made up of}} 3 phases. First, the prospective officers will learn the basic skills of every enlisted marine, which takes about 10 weeks. After phase one comes the second phase, commanding a squad of 8 marines. This module lasts for 8 weeks, and emphasizes nightly operations. After successfully completing the second phase comes the final phase of commanding a Troop of marines. This last module is the longest, and cross-training is given by both the Dutch Marine training cadre and that of the British Royal Marines. When successfully completed the 'POTOM', it is followed by a half-year general officer's training at the Koninklijk Instituut voor de Marine (Royal Dutch Naval Academy). If this is finished, the (now) marine officer will be assigned to the operational units of the Mariniers Training Command (MTC).|$|E

40|$|Background: There is {{a general}} outcry that too many South African Foundation Phase (Grades 1 – 3) {{teachers}} {{do not know how}} to teach reading and are currently teaching reading in an  ad hoc, unsystematic way. Objectives: In response to this, this study explored the Foundation Phase teachers’ perceptions of their role in teaching reading. The focus was on the relevance of the initial training, awareness of reading strategies and how these strategies were reflected in their classroom practice. Method: The study was qualitative in nature and a case study design was followed. Semi-structured interviews were conducted with nine teachers who were purposively selected from three public schools. Content analysis was used to analyse the data. Results: Regarding the <b>initial</b> <b>training</b> <b>programme,</b> teachers received at tertiary institutions, the findings of the study showed that the majority of teachers were not adequately prepared to teach reading and to deal with learners who experience problems in reading. Some teachers indicated that they were not even trained to teach in the Foundation Phase. The findings also showed that the majority of respondents doubted if their classroom practice would yield positive results as far as reading instruction is concerned. The findings further indicated that the majority of respondents only paid attention to oral reading (observing punctuation marks and pronunciation), without attending to reading comprehension. There was a general consensus that the new ways of teaching reading were necessary in order to improve the reading ability of learners. Conclusion: Recommendations based on the findings are that institutions of higher learning that train Foundation Phase teachers should do so in ways that adequately equip them to produce student teachers who are knowledgeable about research and theory regarding how individuals learn to read. Workshops on appropriate instruction of reading strategies are recommended for in-service teachers. </p...|$|E

Unlike {{in the past when}} pastors could lead churches without proper formal training based on their spirituality as viewed by the IAG and them professing to be called as ministers, today in this church tradition the need for the formal educational formation of pastors is taken for granted. This stance raises questions about the quality of graduates as well as matters of curriculum development, as the world is continually in a state of flux with far- reaching consequences for training institutions. It is generally accepted that churches {{play an important role in}} the lives of citizens in a predominantly Christian country like South Africa. On the other hand there is a continuing contestation and debate regarding the role pastors play in their churches in management and administrative issues. This also relates to the preparedness or unpreparedness of graduate pastors for their job. The day to day performance of duties by serving pastors in their organisations is generally viewed as below expectation compared to their counterparts in other occupations. A qualitative research approach was followed to elicit the necessary information to answer the research questions. Participants who were regarded as information rich cases on the training of pastors of the IAG were selected to shed more light on this particular aspect. Two focus group interviews and seven individual interviews were conducted. The interviews included members of the national and provincial executive committees, serving pastors, directors of the training colleges, pastor trainees in their final year of study and a newly graduated student.

40|$|This paper {{considers}} whether {{listed companies}} with dispersed ownership invest less in training than do other firms, {{as part of}} a short-termist stance caused by pressure from the stock market. An analytical framework that supports the proposition involves three factors: high agency costs between the shareholders and managers of listed firms that have dispersed ownership; the use of highly geared performance-related pay to reward top managers; and accounting conventions that distort performance measures by requiring that spending on intangible assets be expensed not amortised. Managers then have the incentive and ability to restrict spending on training in order to increase their remuneration. Countervailing factors, including institutions of corporate governance, may however weaken or destroy such effects. Evidence is presented concerning the <b>initial</b> <b>training</b> <b>programmes</b> of 56 companies in engineering and retailing in Britain, Germany and Switzerland.

40|$|This paper {{reports on}} {{research}} undertaken into the processes through which student teachers begin to formulate an {{identity as a}} professional teacher. Using Fuller’s investigations into the attitudes of trainee teachers towards their courses (1969) as a baseline, a discussion is established on {{the place of the}} student voice in contemporary <b>initial</b> teacher <b>training</b> <b>programmes.</b> In order to further investigate the potential importance of affording student teachers the opportunity to reflect on and express their thinking and feeling as they embark on their chosen career path, the concerns of a group of student drama teachers were recorded and interpreted.

This paper illustrates how the methodology revealed distinct yet generally harmonious voices at work in the group in the first few weeks of their training year. Subsequent analysis suggests a model for the initial formation of a teaching identity built on aspects of self, role and character.

40|$|This study {{relies on}} the {{theoretical}} premises concerning the development of professional competencies of the beginning teachers. The starting point is the operational model that integrates seven categories of competencies: cognitive and meta-cognitive, methodological, communicational and relational, evaluative, psychosocial, career management, as well as ICT competencies. The goal {{of this study is}} to propose and validate a programme meant to improve the cognitive and meta-cognitive competencies of the beginning teachers. In order to run the research we have established the following objectives: development and pre-testing of the tools for the experimental model; initial evaluation of the cognitive and meta-cognitive competencies, design and course of a programme of formative activities that lead to the improvement of the cognitive and meta-cognitive competencies; final evaluation of the cognitive and meta-cognitive competencies. As research methods we used: the formative psycho-pedagogical experiment with repeated measurements (test – post test), analysis of the products of teachers’ activities (projects, competencies portfolios), psycho-pedagogical observation, and statistical methods. Statistical facts obtained during the research show significant differences with respect to the results obtained by the beginning teachers at the evaluation applied at the end of the formative stage, compared to those obtained at the initial evaluation.
