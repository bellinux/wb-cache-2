5|$|Hydrogen is not {{an energy}} resource, except in the {{hypothetical}} context of commercial nuclear fusion power plants using deuterium or tritium, a technology presently far from development. The Sun's energy comes from nuclear fusion of hydrogen, but this process is difficult to achieve controllably on Earth. Elemental hydrogen from solar, biological, or electrical sources requires more energy to make than is obtained by burning it, so in these cases hydrogen functions as an <b>energy</b> <b>carrier,</b> like a battery. Hydrogen may be obtained from fossil sources (such as methane), but these sources are unsustainable.|$|E

25|$|Exergy {{in a sense}} can be {{understood}} as a measure of value of energy. Since high-exergy <b>energy</b> <b>carriers</b> can be used in for more versatile purposes, due to their ability to do more work, they can be postulated to hold more economic value. This can be seen in prices of <b>energy</b> <b>carriers,</b> i.e. high-exergy <b>energy</b> <b>carriers</b> such as electricity tend to be more valuable than low-exergy ones such as various fuels or heat. This has led to substitution of more valuable high-exergy <b>energy</b> <b>carriers</b> with low-exergy <b>energy</b> <b>carriers,</b> when possible. An example is heating systems, where higher investment to heating systems allows using low-exergy energy sources. Thus high-exergy content is being substituted with capital investments.|$|R
40|$|The {{value of}} <b>energy</b> <b>carriers</b> can be {{described}} thermodynamically {{by the amount of}} heat (enthalpy method) or work (exergy or availability method) that can be obtained from the <b>carriers.</b> Prices for <b>energy</b> <b>carriers</b> are used in economics to express their values. The prices for <b>energy</b> <b>carriers</b> are often related to their enthalpies when other properties and conditions are equivalent. However, {{it has been suggested that}} the exergy of the <b>energy</b> <b>carriers</b> is the proper quantity to establish their values, i. e. prices should be based on these exergies. In this paper, the structure of the energy demand is included in the analysis of the value concepts. The aggregated energy demands of the industries in The Netherlands and West Germany (F. R. G.) are used as examples. Optimization of the total system is the proper way to establish the performance of <b>energy</b> <b>carriers.</b> In this optimization, several assumptions must be made about availability and applicability of technical options, such as heat cascading, cogeneration and heat pumps. The structure of the demand influences the importance of <b>energy</b> <b>carriers</b> and thus their value in a given system. Neither the enthalpy nor the exergy of the <b>energy</b> <b>carriers</b> is an adequate base for price setting...|$|R

The classical Economic Dispatch method is modied {{in order to}} account for certain system properties, such as the possibility of conversion be-tween the different <b>energy</b> <b>carriers,</b> or local overproduction and power feedback to the grid. In this work both a sys-tem model {{as well as an}} optimization approach are developed which are suitable for the integration of an arbitrary number of <b>energy</b> <b>carriers.</b> Analytical results show how the optimal conversion of power affects the marginal prices related to the different <b>energy</b> <b>carriers.</b> Finally the proposed optimization procedure is demonstrated in numerical examples...|$|R
25|$|An {{alternative}} to gaseous hydrogen as an <b>energy</b> <b>carrier</b> is to bond it with nitrogen {{from the air}} to produce ammonia, which can be easily liquefied, transported, and used (directly or indirectly) as a clean and renewable fuel.|$|E
25|$|As {{a result}} of not {{containing}} mitochondria, red blood cells use none of the oxygen they transport; instead they produce the <b>energy</b> <b>carrier</b> ATP by the glycolysis of glucose and lactic acid fermentation on the resulting pyruvate.|$|E
25|$|Just like natural gas, the stored ammonia {{can be used}} as {{a thermal}} fuel for {{transportation}} and electricity generation or used in a fuel cell. A standard 60,000 m3 tank of liquid ammonia contains about 211 GWh of energy, equivalent to the annual production of roughly 30 wind turbines. Ammonia can be burned cleanly: water and nitrogen are released, but no CO2 and little or no nitrogen oxides. Ammonia has multiple uses besides being an <b>energy</b> <b>carrier,</b> it is the basis for the production of many chemicals, the most common use is for fertilizer. Given this flexibility of usage, and given that the infrastructure for the safe transport, distribution and usage of ammonia is already in place, it makes ammonia a good candidate to be a large-scale, non-carbon, <b>energy</b> <b>carrier</b> of the future.|$|E

This is an area of current research, and new developments and technologies are causing this field to evolve rapidly.|$|E
25|$|The {{universality}} of {{many aspects of}} cellular life is often pointed to as supportive evidence to the more compelling evidence listed above. These similarities include the <b>energy</b> <b>carrier</b> adenosine triphosphate (ATP), {{and the fact that}} all amino acids found in proteins are left-handed. It is, however, possible that these similarities resulted because of the laws of physics and chemistry, rather than universal common descent and therefore resulted in convergent evolution. In contrast, there is evidence for homology of the central subunits of Transmembrane ATPases throughout all living organisms, especially how the rotating elements are bound to the membrane. This supports the assumption of a LUCA as a cellular organism, although primordial membranes may have been semipermeamble and evolved later to the membranes of modern bacteria, and on a second path to those of modern archaea also.|$|E
25|$|There are {{synthetic}} pathways {{for using}} electricity to reduce {{carbon dioxide and}} water to liquid hydrocarbon or alcohol fuels. These pathways begin with electrolysis of water to generate hydrogen, and then reducing carbon dioxide with excess hydrogen in variations of the reverse water gas shift reaction. Non-fossil sources of carbon dioxide include fermentation plants and sewage treatment plants. Converting electrical energy to carbon-based liquid fuel has potential to provide portable energy storage usable by the large existing stock of motor vehicles and other engine-driven equipment, without the difficulties of dealing with hydrogen or another exotic <b>energy</b> <b>carrier.</b> These synthetic pathways may attract attention in connection with attempts to improve energy security in nations that rely on imported petroleum, but have or can develop large sources of renewable or nuclear electricity, {{as well as to}} deal with possible future declines in the amount of petroleum available to import.|$|E
