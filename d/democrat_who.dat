5|$|Franklin Pierce (November 23, 1804October 8, 1869) was the 14th President of the United States (1853–57). Pierce was a {{northern}} <b>Democrat</b> <b>who</b> saw the abolitionist {{movement as a}} fundamental threat to {{the unity of the}} nation. His polarizing actions in championing and signing the Kansas–Nebraska Act and enforcing the Fugitive Slave Act alienated anti-slavery groups while failing to stem conflict between North and South setting the stage for Southern secession and the American Civil War. Historians and other scholars generally rank Pierce among the worst of U.S. Presidents.|$|E

Campbell, a <b>Democrat,</b> <b>who</b> had defeated Foraker in 1889, was to seek re-election in 1891. The Ohio Republican party remained divided, but McKinley quietly arranged for Foraker to nominate him at the 1891 state Republican convention, which chose McKinley by acclamation. The former congressman {{spent much of the}} second half of 1891 campaigning against Campbell, beginning in his birthplace of Niles. Hanna, however, was little seen in the campaign; he spent much of his time raising funds for the election of legislators pledged to vote for Sherman in the 1892 senatorial election. McKinley won the 1891 election by some 20,000 votes; the following January, Sherman, with considerable assistance from Hanna, turned back a challenge by Foraker to win the legislature's vote for another term in the Senate.|$|E

Her major Democratic opponent in the jungle primary was African American State Senator Don Cravins, Sr., the father of another lawmaker, Don Cravins, Jr., of Opelousas. Her major Republican opponent was Charles Boustany, a retired heart surgeon from Lafayette, who ran {{on a platform of}} preventing tax increases and passing a new energy bill. The Louisiana Democratic Party was supporting Mount, as Cravins was believed to be a weaker contestant in a run-off. Polls taken in late October had shown Boustany, Cravins and Mount statistically tied, and the election was hotly contested.|$|E

Capitalizing on Kennedy's legacy, President Lyndon Johnson kept continuity with the Apollo program by keeping Webb on when he succeeded Kennedy in November 1963. But Webb resigned in October 1968 before Apollo achieved its goal, and Republican President Richard M. Nixon replaced Webb with Republican Thomas O. Paine.|$|E

5|$|Beckham {{attempted}} {{to return to}} the Senate in 1936. The head of the Jockey Club, James B. Brown, had lost his fortune and influence when his banking empire crashed in 1930. In 1933 Beckham's ally, Robert Bingham, had been appointed ambassador to the Court of St. James's, increasing his prominence and influence. Beckham also enjoyed the support of the United Mine Workers and Louisville mayor Neville Miller. The race was complicated, though, by the entry of John Y. Brown, a <b>Democrat</b> <b>who</b> was a U.S. Representative and former Speaker of the Kentucky House of Representatives. He had agreed to support Chandler's bid for the governorship in exchange for Chandler's support in his run for the Senate. However, Chandler threw his support to Beckham, and while Brown was not able to win the seat without the support of Bingham and Chandler, he did garner 85,000 votes, most of them at Beckham's expense. Democratic incumbent M. M. Logan retained the seat by 2,385 votes.|$|E
