500|$|The {{death of}} Sophia Peletier {{is a major}} {{incident}} in [...] "Pretty Much Dead Already", largely affecting the themes of the episode. After the group has shot the walkers housed in Hershel Greene's barn, Sophia appears from the barn as a walker, much to the groups' dismay. A disturbed and distraught Rick Grimes pulls out his weapon and makes the decision to shoot her. Despite being initially surprised about her character's being killed off, Madison Lintz concluded that she understood its aftermath for the show. Lintz affirmed that portraying a walker was a welcoming experience for her, and stated that she was [...] "going {{to look back on}} and say that was amazing." [...] Robert Kirkman felt that killing Sophia would add more dimension to the show, as well as add more flexibility to its storyline progression. [...] "When a good idea comes up, you have to go with it," [...] he articulated. [...] "Sophia is a character who is still alive in the comic book series and who has contributed quite a bit to the overall narrative and informed a lot of story lines for a lot of different characters. Having Carol [...] survive her daughter as opposed to the other way around {{as it is in the}} comics is <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>lead</b> <b>to</b> interesting but different stories." [...] Although Kirkman was not on set during production of the sequence, Gimple retrieved shell casings from the blanks that were fired on set. Referred to as [...] "Barnageddon" [...] by the writers, Kirkman asserted that he emphasized unpredictability while creating the scene.|$|E

30|$|This {{approach}} to life in all the forms of activities is visible when Buddhist University campuses are explored. As soon as one begins to walk, {{there is a sense}} of having stepped into an environment which is different from that of most colleges and universities. Not only are the environs clean, beautiful, and harmoniously organized, but one finds oneself surrounded by an unusual silence and sounds of peace. One can actually hear nature, such as birds, waterfalls, and the rustling of leaves because they appear against the background of an ever present, soothing silence. The sounds of human activities are gentle and conducted with awareness of the presence of others. In the dining halls and lounges, loud sounds of television are absent. There are no disruptive noises from leaf blowers. Nor will we hear people speaking in loud and angry voices on their mobile phones. People on Buddhist campuses are polite, and they immediately attend to the needs of a stranger. Students or faculty members will immediately change the direction they are <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>lead</b> visitors <b>to</b> the building they are looking for.|$|R
