40|$|Antimicrobial {{ingredients}} [2 % {{sodium lactate}} (SL), 0. 1 % sodium diacetate (SDA), 0. 1 % potassium benzoate (PB) ] and low-dose irradiation were combined and tested for {{their effects on}} the growth of L. monocytogenes and meat quality. The log 10 reductions of L. monocytogenes in hams following 1. 0 to 2. 5 kGy irradiation ranged from 2. 0 to 5. 0. The D 10 values were 0. 52 kGy for control <b>ham,</b> <b>ham</b> <b>with</b> PB, SL or PB+SL, 0. 49 kGy for <b>ham</b> <b>with</b> SL+SDA, and 0. 48 kGy for <b>ham</b> <b>with</b> PB+SL+SDA (PSS). Addition of SL+SDA or PB+SL in combination with 1. 0 kGy irradiation was effective in suppressing the growth of L. monocytogenes for about six weeks when stored at 4 °C, while 2. 0 -kGy-irradiation was listeriostatic. One kGy irradiated <b>ham</b> <b>with</b> PSS was listeriostatic throughout storage. SL increased firmness of turkey hams and sensory panelists noted that the saltiness was a little higher in products containing SL, but its overall impact on quality was minimal. Amounts of benzene were detected in irradiated <b>hams</b> <b>with</b> PB, showing PB was not fit as an antimicrobial ingredient for irradiated foods. In conclusion, 2 % sodium lactate and 0. 1 % sodium diacetate in combination with low dose irradiation were effective in ensuring the safety of RTE meat products against L. monocytogenes...|$|R

40|$|OBJECTIVE: Assessment of the {{quantity}} and chemical type of phosphorus (P) content in cooked <b>ham</b> products <b>with</b> or without preservatives using a novel biochemical procedure. METHODS: We examined {{the quantity}} and types of P in 40 samples of cooked ham, including 20 without and 20 with P-containing preservatives, which were purchased randomly from a grocery store in Italy. Food samples were analyzed for dry matter, nitrogen, fat, and P content. Novel spectrophotometric methods were used to measure total P and 3 different P subtypes, that is, water-soluble (inorganic) P including added preservatives and natural P derived from phospholipids and phosphoproteins, separately. RESULTS: Compared <b>with</b> <b>hams</b> without preservatives, <b>hams</b> <b>with</b> P-containing preservatives had significantly lower dry matter and protein and fat contents. There was 66 % more inorganic P (IP) in <b>ham</b> <b>with</b> preservatives than in samples without preservatives (169 ± 36 vs. 102 ± 16 mg/ 100 g, P <. 001, respectively). There {{were no significant differences}} in P contents derived from proteins or lipids. The P-to-protein ratio was higher in <b>ham</b> samples <b>with</b> preservatives than in those without preservatives (16. 1 ± 4. 0 and 9. 8 ± 0. 8 mg/g, P <. 001). The sum of measured IP and P from phospholipids and phosphoproteins was 91 % ± 4 % of measured total P (207. 1 ± 50. 7 vs. 227. 2 ± 54. 4 mg/ 100 g), indicating a small portion of unspecified P and/or under measurement. CONCLUSIONS: Novel differential dietary P measurement detects added P-containing preservatives. Cooked <b>ham</b> <b>with</b> preservatives has 66 % more measurable IP and 64 % higher P-to-protein ratio than ham without preservatives. The contribution of food added with P-containing preservatives to global dietary P burden can negatively influence chronic kidney disease outcome and counteract the efficacy of P-binder medications: this is an important topic that warrants additional investigations...|$|R

40|$|Consumer’s {{preferences}} for cured <b>ham</b> are investigated <b>with</b> conjoint analysis.

In particular, we analyse to what extent consumers’ socio-demographic traits affect their price-sensitiveness and whether consumer’s sensory (hedonic) valuations and attitudes towards <b>ham</b> <b>with</b> a Protected Designation of Origin (PDO) affect the {{preferences for}} specific attributes. The results show that consumers with a low-medium age and income are more price sensitive. Consumers more leaned sensorially towards the own regional product (with or without PDO), {{are more inclined to}} purchase this product, and consumers with a more favourable attitude towards PDO ham, are also more prone to purchase cured <b>ham</b> <b>with</b> quality certification in comparison with a product without PDO. Accordingly, the PDO scheme attracts a segment of consumers, but still the origin by itself is a more powerful signal of quality.
