Alternating current systems that started appearing mid decade used a high distribution voltage but stepped that down via transformers to the same 110 volt customer utilization voltage that Edison used. In 1883 Edison patented a three wire distribution system to allow <b>DC</b> <b>generation</b> plants to serve a wider radius of customers to save on copper costs. By connecting two groups of 110 volt lamps in series, more load could be served by the same size conductors run with 220 volts between them; a neutral conductor carried any imbalance of current between the two sub-circuits. AC circuits adopted the same form, allowing lamps to be run at around 120 volts and major appliances to be connected to 240 volts. Today, virtually all American homes and businesses have access to 120 and 240 volts at 60 hertz. Both voltages are available on the three wires (two [...] "hot" [...] legs and one [...] "neutral" [...] leg).|$|E

40|$|The {{ability to}} store {{information}} electronically in small tags {{that can be}} read wirelesslyhas great potential. Radio frequency identification (RFID) technology is used today in anumber of different areas, such as logistics, supply chain management, access control andenvironmental monitoring. Recently, research on RFID technology has focused on sensortags, localization techniques, antennas and propagation, data security, communicationprotocols and circuit design for the tags and the readers. In a typical RFID system, a passive tag is powered up remotely by a radio frequencysignal sent from a reader unit. The RF signal received by the tag antenna is convertedto a DC-supply voltage by the rectifier in the analog front-end of the tag. To avoidpower loss in the rectifying operation, low-voltage Schottky diodes are often used in amulti-stage rectifier. However, the use of Schottky diodes is not cost efficient becausethese diodes must be designed in advanced semiconductor processes. Because one of thedemands on future RFID technology {{is to reduce the}} cost, efficient rectifiers that canbe integrated in a low cost semiconductor process is highly desirable. For this reason,different rectifiers in standard CMOS have been proposed. This thesis discuss recent work and present new ideas on rectifiers in CMOS that havethe potential to replace Schottky diodes in rectifiers for low-power RFID applications. The design and modelling of multi-stage rectifiers for maximized <b>DC</b> <b>generation</b> in aninductive RFID system are also included. Furthermore this thesis presents techniquesfor inductive transponders that allow improved <b>DC</b> <b>generation</b> and reduced orientationsensitivity for transponders that trace moving objects. Part I of the thesis presents a theoretical analysis of the RF to <b>DC</b> <b>generation</b> usingsingle diode rectifiers. This analysis illustrates how different properties, such as the voltageand power conversion efficiency of the rectifier, the Q-factor of the resonance circuitand the coupling coefficient between coil antennas, affect the tag <b>DC</b> <b>generation.</b> Furthermore,Part I also discusses <b>DC</b> <b>generation</b> for inductive transponders using multiple coilantennas. In Part II, Paper A discusses the limitations with the CMOS cross-connectedbridge rectifier and proposes a modified bridge with active diodes to improve rectifierperformance. Paper B presents a theoretical model for diode-connected MOS transistorswith internal threshold cancellation (ITC), as well as a design procedure that describeshow to optimize a rectifier based on MOS ITC diodes. In Paper C a highly efficient activeMOS diode is presented {{that can be used in}} multi-stage low-power rectifiers. In addition,this study shows that active diodes in CMOS can be designed to have a diode voltagedrop of less than 100 mV and have a power consumption of a few μW. Paper D presentsa model for the DC charge-up phase in a rectifier driven by a coil antenna. This model was used to determine the available chip current in a typical pulsed RFID system. InPaper E, the modeling and design of multi-stage rectifiers for inductively coupled RFIDtags is presented. Finally, Paper F presents front-end circuit solutions for transpondersusing multiple coil antennas. The work presented in this thesis demonstrates that highly efficient RF to DC conversioncan be achieved using CMOS rectifiers for low-power applications. New techniquesin CMOS with the potential to replace Schottky diodes in RFID rectifiers are demonstrated. Furthermore, new design criteria for voltage multipliers to achieve maximizedDC generation in inductively coupled RFID tags and techniques for reduced orientationsensitivity are presented. These results are promising for improving and reducing cost ofinductively coupled RFID systems.

40|$|Generation of an {{effective}} immune response requires that antigens be processed and presented to T lymphocytes by antigen-presenting cells, the most efficient of which are dendritic cells (DC). Because of their influence on both the innate and the acquired arms of immunity, a defect in DC {{would be expected to}} result in a broad impairment of immune function, not unlike that observed in astronauts during or after space flight. In the study reported here, we investigated whether <b>DC</b> <b>generation</b> and function are altered in a culture environment that models microgravity, i. e., the rotary-cell culture system (RCCS). We observed that RCCS supported the generation of DC identified by morphology, phenotype (HLA-DR+ and lacking lineage-associated markers), and function (high allostimulatory activity). However, the yield of DC from RCCS was significantly lower than that from static cultures. RCCS-generated DC were less able to phagocytose Aspergillus fumigatus conidia and expressed a lower density of surface HLA-DR. The proportion of DC expressing CD 80 was also significantly reduced in RCCS compared to static cultures. When exposed to fungal antigens, RCCS-generated DC produced lower levels of interleukin- 12 and failed to upregulate some costimulatory/adhesion molecules involved in antigen presentation. These data suggest that <b>DC</b> <b>generation,</b> and some functions needed to mount {{an effective}} immune response to pathogens, may be disturbed in the microgravity environment of space...|$|E

40|$|Blocking {{antibodies}} {{are valuable}} tools for inhibiting the specific receptor- ligand interactions. The interaction of co-stimulatory molecules on the antigen presenting cells with their ligands on T cells {{is an essential}} step for T cell activation. In the present study, the effect of blocking antibody against CD 40 on its T cell stimulatory potential is investigated. The DCs (dendritic cells) were collected from the mice spleens and then cultured in vitro. We used purified rat anti-mice CD 40 (Clone HM 40 - 3) (BD USA) as a blocking antibody and the appropriate titer of the blocking antibody was determined by flow cytometry. The DCs were then treated by antibody and used in MLR assay. The results of these experiments showed that CD 40 blockade {{were associated with the}} increase in the of IL- 4 secretion, shifting the DCs to stimulate Th 2 cytokine production by the allogenic T cells, while the secretion of IL- 12 by DCs decreased. Similarly, the DCs with reduced CD 40 expression poorly responded to alloantigen stimulation in the MLR. Collectively, these results emphasize the importance of CD 40 pathway in tolerogenic <b>DCs</b> <b>generation</b> and also support the idea that downregulation of CD 40 is effective in inhibiting the allostimulatory function. </p...|$|R

40|$|As the {{application}} of Light weight Electric Vehicles (LEVs) increase in communities, Dublin Institute of Technology (DIT) uses these small vehicles for short distance journeys around its 78 acre campus of “Grangegorman” located in inner Dublin city, Ireland. This paper presents {{an introduction to the}} campus Photovoltaic Charging Station (PV-CS) that generates clean electricity from the sun and charges the LEVs batteries which can lead to reduction of CO 2 emissions, along with fulfillment of national and international green sustainability targets. Based on the evaluation of possible options for PV-CS design, the optimal design configuration was chosen as a "Battery Energy Storage System (BESS) ”. The PV generated electricity that is stored in battery banks will serve as the primary source for charging the campus vehicles, with any surplus demand being met by the utility grid. Batteries have been included in the design due to intermittent nature of Irish sunshine and the charge time requirements of campus load. This paper concentrates on the detailed sizing of the BESS via two approaches: BESS with <b>DC</b> <b>generation</b> and BESS with LEV load demand.

40|$|The {{functional}} properties of myeloid dendritic cells (DCs) differ, depending on microenvironmental factors {{as well as}} on their stage of maturation. The main approaches for the selective enhancement of the tolerogenic properties of DCs include the induction of a pharmacological arrest of the DCs maturation and the genetical engineering of DCs expressing immunosuppressive molecules. Several immunosuppressive/anti-inflammatory agents have been discovered that potentially inhibit DC maturation and immunogenicity. Photopheresis (ECP) is an immunomodulatory therapy in which leucocytes are exposed to 8 -methoxypsoralen (8 -MOP) and ultraviolet (UV) A radiation (PUVA). The combination of ECP with immunosuppressive agents has demonstrated efficacy in the management of transplanted patients by reducing either the incidence of organ rejection or the pharmacological toxicity. In particular, we have observed in hepatitis C virus (HCV) -positive patients that the same combination has reduced the immunosuppressive burden and improved sustainability and efficacy of pre-emptive antiviral therapy after liver transplantation. Therefore, in our work we investigated the in vitro effects of PUVA, combined with immunosuppressive drugs (IDs), on both in vitro human <b>DC</b> <b>generation</b> and maturation, in order to contribute to understanding the immunological mechanisms underlying this pharmacological combination. Monocyte PUVA-treatment was performed by using an in vitro experimental protocol that we previously described. PUVA-treated or -untreated highly purified CD 14 + cells were incubated with the association of the immunosuppressive drugs, used in the management of liver transplantation, at two different concentrations, in the presence of IL- 4 and GM-CSF. The treatment with IDs at the highest concentration (corresponding to that used in clinical practice), alone or in association with PUVA, induced an immunosuppressive effect, by impairing both <b>DC</b> <b>generation</b> and maturation. Neither immunosuppressive drugs at the lowest concentration nor their combination with PUVA affected myeloid <b>DC</b> <b>generation,</b> but modified DC functions, strengthening the induction of a tolerogenic pattern. As this ID concentration was arbitrarily chosen, further experiments could highlight whether lower concentrations than those used in clinical practice would elicit the same effect on DCs and potentially improve their {{functional properties}}. This work describes an original experimental approach exploring the in vitro mechanism of action of the combined procedure of PUVA with immunosuppressive drugs, used in liver transplantation, on DCs generation and function. Our results contribute to the knowledge of the mechanisms of action of this combined procedure on DCs, suggesting useful therapeutic implications for the in vivo therapy...|$|E
40|$|While {{vaccination}} with antigen-pulsed dendritic cells (DCs) {{represents a}} promising therapeutic strategy in multiple myeloma (MM), clinical benefit, so far, {{has been limited}} to individual patients. To identify potential problems with this approach, we have analyzed the influence of treatment parameters, in particular high-dose chemotherapy (HD-CTX) and thalidomide, on in vitro <b>DC</b> <b>generation</b> and peripheral blood lymphocyte subsets in MM patients. From a total of 25 MM patients, including 14 patients on thalidomide treatment and 11 after HD-CTX, in vitro <b>DC</b> <b>generation</b> from peripheral blood monocytes under serum-free condition was investigated. In addition, peripheral blood lymphocyte subsets were assessed in 17 patients including 10 patients on thalidomide treatment and 9 patients after HD-CTX. Efficient in vitro generation of DCs (median 7. 1 x 10 (6) / 100 ml peripheral blood; range 0. 1 - 42. 5 x 10 (6) / 100 ml peripheral blood) expressing DC-typical surface markers was observed in 23 MM patients (92 %), although reduced expression of CD 1 a, CD 40, CD 83, and HLA-DR was observed in patients treated with thalidomide. With respect to lymphocyte subsets, MM patients showed significantly (p< 0. 05) reduced B and CD 4 + lymphocytes in the peripheral blood. This effect was most prominent within 6 months of HD-CTX and in patients receiving thalidomide (usually in combination with CTX). CD 8 + lymphocytes were significantly increased in MM patients. Thus, despite the well-known deficiencies in their immune system, adequate numbers of DCs can be generated in most myeloma patients. In patients treated with thalidomide, however, {{it remains to be}} seen whether the reduced expression of co-stimulatory molecules has functional relevance...|$|E

Addition of IL- 4 favoured the outgrowth of CD 1 a+, HLA-DR+, CD 4 +, CD 40 +, CD 80 + but CD 14 - cells with dendritic morphology and strong antigen-presenting capacity. Addition of IFN-gamma selectively induced HLA-DR and CD 86 but did not up-regulate CD 1 a expression or antigen-presenting capacity of the differentiated cells. An antagonism between IL- 4 and IFN-gamma could further be confirmed in that, as compared with IL- 4 alone, the simultaneous addition of IL- 4 and IFN-gamma to GM-CSF plus TNF-alpha during maturation reduced both the phenotypical (CD 1 a, CD 4, CD 40) and functional characteristics of DC. Using receptor-specific TNF-alpha mutants, we investigated the relative involvement of TNF-alpha receptors R 1 and R 2 in {{the generation of}} DC. The induction of CD 1 a and HLA-DR, {{as well as the}} increase in allostimulatory capacity were dependent on TNF-R 1 triggering, whereas triggering through TNF-R 2 had no measurable effect.

Results Cell culture in CellGro resulted in a higher yield of immature DCs resulting from increased number of adherent monocytes. DCs that were generated in CellGro and activated using Poly I:C were the most efficient in expanding antigen-specific T cells compared to the DCs that were generated in other media and activated using LPS or the cocktail of proinflammatory cytokines. A comparison of all tested combinations revealed that DCs that were generated in CellGro and activated using Poly I:C induced low numbers of regulatory T cells. Conclusion In this study, we identified monocyte-derived DCs that were generated in CellGro and activated using Poly I:C as the most potent clinical-grade DCs for the induction of antigen-specific T cells. </p...|$|R
40|$|A fully {{dedicated}} nuclear-electrolytic hydrogen-production facility, {{based on}} advanced (1985) technology, has been synthesized and assessed at the conceptual level. The facility integrates an HTGR operating a binary shaftpower-extraction cycle at 980 C top temperature, direct <b>dc</b> electricity <b>generation</b> via acyclic generators, and high-current density high-pressure electrolyzers {{based on the}} solid polymer electrolyte approach. All subsystems are close-coupled and optimally interfaced. Pipeline-pressure hydrogen and coproduct oxygen are produced at 6900 kPa. On consistent costing bases, the advanced facility concept was found to provide hydrogen costs that were approximately half those associated with conventional, contemporary-technology nuclear electrolysis. The nuclear heat-to-hydrogen energy conversion efficiency for the advanced system was estimated as 43 %, against 25 % for the baseline present-day approach...|$|R
