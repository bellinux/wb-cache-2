5|$|With the {{creation}} of a national Sejm in 1493, which took over the powers of taxation and the pospolite ruszenie previously granted to sejmiks at Nieszawa, the importance of regional governance somewhat diminished. Still, the sejmikis continued {{to play an important role}} in the governance of Poland as the most direct <b>form</b> <b>of</b> <b>political</b> enfranchisement of the nobility.|$|E
5|$|Kingship was {{the major}} <b>form</b> <b>of</b> <b>political</b> {{organisation}} in the Early Middle Ages, with competing minor kingdoms and fluid relationships of over and under kingdoms. The primary function of these kings was as war leaders, {{but there were also}} ritual elements to kingship, evident in ceremonies of coronation.The unification of the Scots and Picts from the tenth century that produced the Kingdom of Alba, retained some of these ritual aspects in the coronation at Scone. While the Scottish monarchy remained a largely itinerant institution, Scone remained one of its most important locations, with Royal castles at Stirling and Perth becoming significant in the later Middle Ages before Edinburgh developed as a capital {{in the second half of}} the fifteenth century. The Scottish crown grew in prestige throughout the era and adopted the conventional offices of Western European courts and later elements of their ritual and grandeur.|$|E
25|$|One {{study found}} that support for {{independence}} {{is a function of}} grievances rooted in the desire for Catalonia to assume responsibility for taxation and spending policy. This suggests that Spain might be able to stave off Catalonia's separatist bid through some <b>form</b> <b>of</b> <b>political</b> and taxation policy reconfiguration.|$|E

25|$|The {{animated}} {{science fiction}} show Futurama presents a satirical look at politics and current affairs {{in a number}} of its episodes. Series creator Matt Groening intended from the outset that Futurama would lampoon not only the conventions of science fiction, but elements of present-day life, serving as a <b>form</b> <b>of</b> <b>political</b> and social satire.|$|E

25|$|Unionism in Ireland is a {{political}} ideology that favours the continuation of some <b>form</b> <b>of</b> <b>political</b> union between the islands of Ireland and Great Britain. Since the partition of Ireland, unionism in Ireland has focused on maintaining and preserving the place of Northern Ireland within the United Kingdom. In this context, a distinction may be made between the unionism {{in the province of}} Ulster and unionism elsewhere in Ireland.|$|E
25|$|The 1928 {{campaign}} {{was the first}} of Thomas's six consecutive campaigns as the presidential nominee of the Socialist Party. As an articulate and engaging spokesman for democratic socialism, Thomas had considerably greater influence than the typical perennial candidate. Although most upper and middle class Americans viewed socialism as an unsavory <b>form</b> <b>of</b> <b>political</b> thought, the well-educated Thomas—who often wore three-piece suits and looked and talked like a president—gained grudging admiration.|$|E
25|$|It {{has also}} been {{suggested}} that a basic feature of democracy is the capacity of all voters to participate freely and fully {{in the life of}} their society. With its emphasis on notions of social contract and the collective will of all the voters, democracy can also be characterised as a <b>form</b> <b>of</b> <b>political</b> collectivism because it is defined as a form of government in which all eligible citizens have an equal say in lawmaking.|$|E
50|$|The {{mechanisms}} of popular participation {{established in the}} Constitution (Article 103) are voting, referendums, plebiscites, popular consultations (consulta popular), open council meetings (cabildo abierto), popular legislative initiative and recall (revocatoria del mandato, lit. revocation of mandate). The various other <b>forms</b> <b>of</b> <b>political</b> participation allowed by the Constitution besides regular elections give the 1991 Constitution its participative character. These <b>forms</b> <b>of</b> <b>political</b> participation are regulated by Law 134 of 1994 and Law 1757 of 2015, although articles 104 through 106 further specify that the President {{with the approval of}} all ministers and the Senate may consult the people on matters of national importance (article 104), that governors and mayors may likewise consult voters on issues falling under their jurisdiction (article 105) and detail the different <b>forms</b> <b>of</b> <b>political</b> participation at a local level (article 106).|$|R

25|$|Devolving {{power to}} consumers. Some proponents have {{suggested}} that ethical food markets – and the PGS framework directly – has furthered a 'cash till' <b>form</b> <b>of</b> <b>political</b> democracy, whereby consumer spending power can masquerade as a legitimate governance structure and mechanism (i.e. democratically voted, representative, and therefore accountable). This {{is part of a}} broader shift from forms of 'government' to 'governance' seen in a neoliberalizing world, where a raft of non-state actors, arguably, make informed decisions about where and what to purchase.|$|E
25|$|Abuse of authority, in the <b>form</b> <b>of</b> <b>political</b> corruption, {{is the use}} of legislated or {{otherwise}} authorised powers by government officials for illegitimate private gain. Misuse of government power for other purposes, such as repression of political opponents and general police brutality, is not considered political corruption. Neither are illegal acts by private persons or corporations not directly involved with the government. An illegal act by an officeholder constitutes political corruption only if the act is directly related to their official duties.|$|E
25|$|Roman {{women had}} a limited form of citizenship. Though held in high regard {{they were not}} allowed to vote or stand for civil or public office. The rich might {{participate}} in public life by funding building projects or sponsoring religious ceremonies and other events. Women had the right to own property, to engage in business, and to obtain a divorce, but their legal rights varied over time. Marriages were an important <b>form</b> <b>of</b> <b>political</b> alliance during the Republic.|$|E

The defeat showed MIC that it stood a better chance by joining the ‘Alliance’ as it was the most workable and effective <b>form</b> <b>of</b> <b>political</b> technique in the Malayan context. Thus, in 1954, MIC became the third member of the Alliance Party.|$|E
25|$|Scholars claim {{politics}} also drives {{rural-urban migration}} and subsequent settlement patterns. Pre-existing patronage networks, {{sometimes in the}} form of gangs and other times in the <b>form</b> <b>of</b> <b>political</b> parties or social activists, inside slums seek to maintain their economic, social and political power. These social and political groups have vested interests to encourage migration by ethnic groups that will help maintain the slums, and reject alternate housing options even if the alternate options are better in every aspect than the slums they seek to replace.|$|E
25|$|While {{blogging}} {{remains a}} key <b>form</b> <b>of</b> <b>political</b> protest, in the 2009 uprisings, Facebook {{began to take}} a more central role. The physical, rather than virtual protests spread through word-of-mouth rather than blogs. When possible, instances of police abuse were captured on mobile phone videos and then uploaded to YouTube, most famously the video of Neda Agha Soltan being shot to death in the streets of Teheran. These videos were shared on Facebook, fueling the protests. Originally blocked by the government in 2006, it had been unblocked in 2009, just months before the protests.|$|E
40|$|Attention {{is given}} in this article to recent action by many liberal states to {{regulate}} and criminalize certain <b>forms</b> <b>of</b> <b>political</b> dissent reliant on new media. I ask how those {{working in the fields}} of youth studies and social science more generally might understand such processes <b>of</b> criminalizing <b>political</b> dissent involving young people digital media. I do this mindful of the prevailing concern about a &# 039;crisis in democracy&# 039; said to be evident in the withdrawal by many young people from traditional <b>forms</b> <b>of</b> <b>political</b> engagement, and the need to encourage greater youth participation in democratic practices. A heuristic or guiding frame is developed to analyse how new laws, amendments to existing laws and other regulatory practices are being implemented to contain certain <b>forms</b> <b>of</b> <b>political</b> participation, performed in large part by young people. A case study of &# 039;Distributed Denial of Service action&# 039; is offered to examine government responses to political practices which I argue constitute legitimate <b>forms</b> <b>of</b> protest and civil disobedience...|$|R
40|$|Recent trends {{suggest that}} young people in Britain are refraining from {{engaging}} in formal political processes. At the same time, they are increasingly expressing support for, and turning toward, a new and diverse range <b>of</b> non-institutionalised <b>forms</b> <b>of</b> <b>political</b> action in order to actualise their interests. Using Inglehart's ideas on postmaterialism, we consider whether this apparent rejection of mainstream politics in favour of less conventional - and sometimes radical - <b>forms</b> <b>of</b> <b>political</b> action is changing over time in Britain, reflecting fluctuating economic conditions witnessed {{over the last two}} decades. We do this by comparing results from surveys of British 18 year olds conducted in 2002 during an era of relative global prosperity, and then in 2011 {{at the height of the}} current global crisis. The findings suggest that British young postmaterialists are considerably more likely than materialists to participate in and support both institutionalised and non-institutionalised <b>forms</b> <b>of</b> <b>political</b> action...|$|R

25|$|In {{spite of}} their {{decreased}} political power and autonomy, the Greek city state or polis continued to be the basic <b>form</b> <b>of</b> <b>political</b> and social organization in Greece. Classical city states such as Athens and Ephesus grew and even thrived in this period. While warfare between Greek cities continued, the cities responded {{to the threat of}} the post Alexandrian Hellenistic states by banding together into alliances or becoming allies of a strong Hellenistic state which could come to its defense therefore making it asylos or inviolate to attack by other cities.|$|E
25|$|The {{tensions}} grew as rioters looted {{and burned}} down an abbey in Oliwa.

The Sejm (parliament) of the Commonwealth did not approve higher taxes for the war. It did however approve a banicja (<b>form</b> <b>of</b> <b>political</b> exile and excommunication), confiscation of the city's property, arrest of its citizens, commercial blockade and rerouting of the important trade via the port of Elbląg (which however was immediately blockaded by Denmark's navy).|$|E

40|$|Attention {{to extreme}} <b>forms</b> <b>of</b> <b>political</b> {{violence}} {{in the social sciences}} has been episodic, and studies <b>of</b> different <b>forms</b> <b>of</b> <b>political</b> violence have followed different approaches, with breakdown theories mostly used for the analysis of right-wing radicalism, social movement theories sometimes adapted to research on left-wing radical groups, and area study specialists focusing on ethnic and religious <b>forms.</b> Some <b>of</b> the studies on extreme <b>forms</b> <b>of</b> <b>political</b> violence that have emerged within the social movement tradition have nevertheless been able to trace processes of conflict escalation through the detailed examination of historical cases. This article assesses some of the knowledge acquired in previous research approaching issues <b>of</b> <b>political</b> violence from the social movement perspective, as well as the challenges coming from new waves of debate on terrorist and counterterrorist action and discourses. In doing this, the article reviews contributions coming from research looking at violence as escalation of action repertoires within protest cycles; political opportunity and the state in escalation processes; resource mobilization and violent organizations; narratives of violence; and militant constructions of external reality...|$|R
