We therefore combine the WWS Household Survey data with quintile cut-offs from the 2009 Household Budget Survey (HBS). Because the HBS {{is representative of the}} entire Latvian population, the quintile cut-offs generated from that household welfare distribution can be used to determine the quintile to which the WWS Household Survey respondents belong.

40|$|INTRODUCTION: Medicare Part D {{provides}} {{prescription drug}} coverage to seniors through a benefit plan with a major deductible inserted in the middle. It is important to study {{the extent to which}} this structure affects seniors’ adherence to prescription medications. Therefore, this study had the following objectives: (1) To <b>identify</b> characteristics <b>of</b> <b>beneficiaries</b> reaching and not reaching the coverage gap, (2) To study the entry and exit times from the coverage gap, (3) To study the impact of a complete gap in coverage on beneficiaries’ adherence to prescription medications, (4) To study the impact of a partial gap in coverage on beneficiaries’ adherence to prescription medications METHODS: This was a retrospective quasi-experimental analysis with matched control groups using a nationally representative sample of Part D enrollees from 2008 Centers for Medicare and Medicaid (CMS) datasets. Adherence to each oral medication taken for {{one or more of the}} seven pre-defined therapeutic classes before and after reaching the coverage gap was measured using the Medication Possession Ratio (MPR). Appropriate statistical tests for significance were performed for each analysis RESULTS: A quarter of our sample (24. 42 %) reached the coverage gap in 2008. Most <b>of</b> the <b>beneficiaries</b> reaching the coverage gap did so by end of September. Those reaching the coverage gap and losing all coverage experienced significantly greater reductions in adherence (3 % more for beta-blockers to 9 % more for oral anti-diabetic agents), compared to those not reaching the coverage gap. A considerable proportion <b>of</b> <b>beneficiaries</b> stopped taking medications in both the groups and the proportion <b>of</b> <b>beneficiaries</b> considered adherent also dropped in both the groups during the coverage gap period. CONCLUSIONS: Medicare Part D beneficiaries face significant barriers to adherence and this is especially highlighted among those reaching the coverage gap.

40|$|The Argentine {{electricity}} {{reform of}} 1992 offers an interesting example of decentralized transmission pricing arrangements within a competitive system. This paper is a shortened {{version of an}} original analysis made in 1994 of the regulation of the Argentine transmission system, with emphasis on investment cost allocation rules. To {{make up for the}} limitation of short-run marginal cost (SRMC) pricing, incentives on service quality were put in place, including penalties for lack of line availability. The mechanism for capacity expansion, based on ad-hoc rules for allocations of investment costs, had the potential to produce non-optimal investment outcomes, as such rules ignored beneficiaries on the demand side. For fine tuning of this system, I proposed an alternative rule based on traditional welfare analysis that broadens the universe <b>of</b> <b>identified</b> <b>beneficiaries,</b> and thus can be expected to produce a fairer outcome on investment cost allocation, reducing the potential risks of non-optimal investment.

2500|$|There {{are several}} ways to evade the rules against purpose trusts. In Re Denley, land was given in trust to provide a sports ground [...] "primarily {{for the benefit of the}} {{employees}} of [...] company and secondarily for the benefit of such other persons as the trustees shall allow to use the same". Although for the benefit of a purpose, the wording <b>identified</b> a class <b>of</b> <b>beneficiaries,</b> which allowed the courts to find it valid. One way to evade the rule, therefore, is to create a trust that benefits a group of people but is confined to a purpose. The judgment of Lloyd LJ, given in R v District Auditor, ex parte West Yorkshire Metropolitan County Council, seems to indicate that the test of certainty for Denley trusts is the same as for discretionary trusts. A second way of evading the rules is found in Re Tyler, where money was donated to a charity, with a request to maintain the donor's family vault; if this vault was not maintained, the money would go elsewhere. Because there was no obligation to maintain the vault, it was not considered a purpose trust. The existence of the Denley exception has enabled the purpose trust to be proposed as one way of holding rights associated with an unincorporated association.|$|R

The SPSS data file (RES- 062 - 23 - 1831 FBS data for ESRC archive. sav) contains 215 variables entered either directly from Farm Management Survey (FMS) Field Books or derived from calculations using field book data and supplementary information (such as price indices). The file ‘RES- 062 - 23 - 1831 SPSS data handbook. xlsx’ lists {{all of the}} variables (both in alphabetical order and the order they appear in in the SPSS file) and includes additional explanatory notes for each variable. Data cleaning was undertaken by looking for logically inconsistent relationships between various variables, querying and checking of anomalous results during data analysis and double checking a number of entries with the original field books. The data file contains information on 168 farm holdings in Devon, Dorset and Cornwall from 1939 to 1984. The file contains 4, 987 cases. Each case in the SPSS file relates to a specific field book for a specific year for a particular farm. The 168 farms selected {{for inclusion in the}} SPSS dataset represent a proportion of all of the farms in the University of Exeter FMS archive. Farms were purposively selected, initially on grounds of longevity in the FMS sample and then to achieve coverage of a cross-section of farming situations in the counties of Devon, Dorset and Cornwall. For further information on the annual FMS (now the Farm Business Survey – FBS), the aims and objectives of this research please refer to the project’s outputs available from [URL] Project description: The objectives of this project were to produce a detailed survey of agricultural change, and technical change in particular, over the period 1935 – 1985, and to shed light on how and when changes on individual farms were brought about.

The Wheatstone network is used to illustrate some problems with this approach.
