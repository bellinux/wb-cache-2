40|$|Working {{memory has}} {{traditionally}} been viewed as independent of the hippocampus and related medial temporal <b>lobe</b> <b>structures.</b> Yet memory-impaired patients with medial temporal lobe damage are sometimes impaired at remembering relational information (e. g., an object and its location) across delays as short as a few seconds. This observation has raised the possibility that medial temporal <b>lobe</b> <b>structures</b> are sometimes critical for maintaining relational information, {{regardless of whether the}} task depends on working or long-term memory.

In two experiments, we assessed the ability of four patients with medial temporal lobe lesions to maintain varying numbers of object–location associations acrossa 1 sretention interval. In both experiments, the patients exhibited a similar pattern of performance. They performed similarly to controls when {{only a small number of}} object–location associations needed to be maintained, and they exhibited an abrupt discontinuity in performance with larger set sizes. This pattern of results supports the idea that maintenance of relational information in working memory is intact after damage to the hippocampus and related medial temporal <b>lobe</b> <b>structures</b> and that damage to these structures impairs performance only when the task depends on long-term memory...|$|R
40|$|Ruminations are {{repetitive}} thoughts {{associated with}} symptoms, causes, {{and consequences of}} one’s negative feelings. The objective {{of this study was}} to explore the neuronal basis of depressive rumination in a non-clinical population within the context of emotional control. Participants scoring high or low on the tendency to ruminate scale took part in the EEG experiment. Their EEG data were collected during a state of induced depressive ruminations and compared with positive and neutral conditions. We hypothesized that both groups would differ according to the level of activation and effective connectivity among the structures involved in the emotional control circuit. Clustering of independent components, together with effective connectivity (Directed Transfer Function), was performed using the EEG signal. The main findings involved decreased activation of the left dorsolateral prefrontal cortex (DLPFC) and increased activation of the left temporal <b>lobe</b> <b>structures</b> in the highly ruminating group. The latter result was most pronounced during the ruminative condition. Decreased information from the left DLPFC to the left temporal <b>lobe</b> <b>structures</b> was also found, leading to the conclusion that hypoactivation of the left DLPFC and its inability to modulate the activation of the left temporal <b>lobe</b> <b>structures</b> is crucial for the ruminative tendencies...|$|R

40|$|Volumetric {{magnetic}} resonance imaging analyses of 30 subjects were undertaken to quantify the global and temporal lobe atrophy in semantic dementia and Alzheimer’s disease. Three groups of 10 subjects were studied: semantic dementia patients, Alzheimer’s disease patients, and control subjects. The temporal <b>lobe</b> <b>structures</b> measured were the amygdala, hippocampus, entorhinal cortex, parahippocampal gyrus, fusiform gyrus, and superior, middle, and inferior temporal gyri. Semantic dementia and Alzheimer’s disease {{groups did not differ}} significantly on global atrophy measures. In semantic dementia, there was asymmetrical temporal lobe atrophy, with greater left-sided damage. There was an antero-posterior gradient in the distribution of temporal lobe atrophy, with more marked atrophy anteriorly. All left anterior temporal <b>lobe</b> <b>structures</b> were affected in semantic dementia, with the entorhinal cortex, amygdala, middle and inferior temporal gyri, and fusiform gyrus the most severely damaged. Asymmetrical, predominantly anterior hippocampal atro-phy was also present. In Alzheimer’s disease, there was symmetrical atrophy of the entorhinal cortex, hippocampus, and amygdala, with no evidence of an anteroposterior gradient in the distribution of temporal lobe or hippocampal atrophy. These data demonstrate that there is a marked difference in the distribution of temporal lobe atrophy in semantic dementia and Alzheimer’s disease. In addition, the pattern of atrophy in semantic dementia suggests that semantic memory is subserved by anterior temporal <b>lobe</b> <b>structures,</b> within which the middle and inferior temporal gyri may play a key role...|$|R
40|$|Since early neuropathological findings, {{temporal}} lobe has {{been related to}} the pathophysiology of some disorders with psychotic features. The {{aim of this study}} was to compare {{temporal lobe}} volumes and asymmetry differences in patients with schizophrenia, schizoaffective and bipolar disorders, disorders that cover the whole psychotic spectrum. Temporal lobe volumes were estimated using high resolution magnetic resonance imaging in 60 subjects, 15 subjects in each patient and one healthy volunteer (control) group. There are no statistically significant differences in temporal lobe volumes among patient and control groups. Comparison of left and right temporal lobes shows that left temporal lobes are smaller than right temporal lobes, however this difference reaches statistical significance only in groups of patients with schizoaffective and bipolar disorders.

40|$|Classical fear {{conditioning}} {{was used}} in the present study as a model for investigating emotional learning and memory in human subjects with lesions to the medial temporal lobe. Animal studies have revealed a critical role for medial temporal <b>lobe</b> <b>structures,</b> particularly the amygdala, in simple and complex associative emotional responding. Whether these structures perform similar functions in humans is unknown. On both simple and conditional discrimination tasks, unilateral temporal lobectomy subjects showed impaired conditioned response acquisition relative to control subjects. This impairment could not be accounted for by deficits in nonassociative sensory or autonomic performance factors, or by differences in declarative memory for the experimental parameters. These results show that medial temporal <b>lobe</b> <b>structures</b> in humans, as in other mammals, are important components in an emotional memory network. [Key words: amygdala, classical conditioning, discrimination learning, emotion, fear, skin conductance response] The neural substrate of emotional learning and memory in animals has been extensively studied using classical fear conditioning paradigms as a model approach (for reviews, see Kapp et al., 1990; Davis, 1992; Fanselow, 1994; LeDoux, 1995). The emerging view from this research suggests that the amygdala is an essential component in a distributed neural network through which emotional reactions are coupled to novel stimuli. Although the role of other temporal <b>lobe</b> <b>structures</b> is less clear, recent lesion studies indicate that the hippocampus is not essential for simple conditioned fear associations but is important for more complex aspects of fear conditioning, such as contextua...|$|R

The aim {{of the present study}} was to determine the volume of temporal <b>lobe</b> <b>structures</b> in patients with panic disorder, measured by magnetic resonance imaging. Eleven panic patients and eleven controls matched for age, sex, handedness, socioeconomic status and years of education participated in the study. The mean volume of the left temporal lobe of panic patients was 9 % smaller than that of controls (t 21 = 2. 37, P = 0. 028). In addition, there was a trend (P values between 0. 05 and 0. 10) to smaller volumes of the right temporal lobe (7 %, t 21 = 1. 99, P = 0. 06), right amygdala (8 %, t 21 = 1. 83, P = 0. 08), left amygdala (5 %, t 21 = 1. 78, P = 0. 09) and left hippocampus (9 %, t 21 = 1. 93, P = 0. 07) in panic patients compared to controls. There was a positive correlation between left hippocampal volume and duration of panic disorder (r = 0. 67, P = 0. 025), with recent cases showing more reduction than older cases. The present results show that panic patients have a decreased volume of the left temporal lobe and indicate the presence of volumetric abnormalities of temporal <b>lobe</b> <b>structures...</b>|$|R

40|$|Background: Congenital adrenal {{hyperplasia}} (CAH) is {{an inherited}} recessive disorder of adrenal steroidogenesis. The enzymes most commonly affected are 21 -hydroxylase. Past reports suggested brain {{magnetic resonance imaging}} (MRI) abnormalities in CAH patients, affecting white matter signal, temporal <b>lobe</b> and amygdala <b>structure</b> and function. Aims: In the present study, we aimed to investigate the frequency of white matter changes and temporal <b>lobes</b> <b>structures</b> dysgenesis in a population of patients having CAH due to 21 -hydroxylase deficiency. Materials and Methods: Neurological examination and brain MRI were performed in 26 patients. Results: Neurological examination revealed mental retardation in three patients, tremor in two patients, tendon reflexes asymmetry in one patient, and cerebellar syndrome in one patient. Eleven patients (42. 3 %) showed MRI abnormalities: Eight of them had white matter hyperintensities, one patient had moderate atrophy in the right temporal, and hippocampal dysgenesis {{was found in the}} remaining two patients. Conclusions: Brain MRI abnormalities in CAH patients include white matter hyperintensities and temporal <b>lobe</b> <b>structures</b> dysgenesis. The mechanisms involved seem related to hormonal imbalances during brain development and exposure to excess exogenous glucocorticoids. Clinical implications of such lesions remain unclear. More extensive studies are required to define better the relationships between brain involvement and different CAH phenotypes and treatment regimens...|$|R

40|$|Patients with {{temporal}} lobe epilepsy secrete ACTH {{at higher rates}} and in greater amounts than normal subjects. Temporal lobectomy restores ACTH secretion to normal amounts and rates.

40|$|Using {{magnetic}} resonance (MR) imaging and morphometric techniques, groups {{of patients with}} Alzheimer's disease (AD) and Huntington's disease (HD) were compared with {{a large group of}} normal control subjects. Measures of volume loss in specific subcortical nuclei and eight cortical regions as well as an index of white matter abnormality were obtained. Results indicated expected widespread cortical volume reductions in AD, which were especially severe in mesial cortices; but comparable reductions were present in subcortical structures, particularly the thalamus. In HD, the greatest reductions were present in striatal structures, but significant abnormalities were also detected in the thalamus and inferior cortical areas, especially in mesial temporal <b>lobe</b> <b>structures.</b> Significant degeneration in white matter was present in both groups, but was more dramatic in the HD patients. The significant diencephalic reduction in AD may make an important contribution to early memory deficits in the disorder, which are usually attributed to hippocampal damage.

40|$|Objectives - A highly {{adaptive}} {{aspect of}} human memory is {{the enhancement of}} explicit, consciously accessible memory by emotional stimuli. We studied the performance of Alzheimer`s disease (AD) patients and elderly controls using a memory battery with emotional content, and we correlated these results with the amygdala and hippocampus volume. Methods - Twenty controls and 20 early AD patients were subjected to the International Affective Picture System (IAPS) and to magnetic resonance imaging-based volumetric measurements of the medial temporal <b>lobe</b> <b>structures.</b> Results - The results show that excluding control group subjects with 5 {{or more years of}} schooling, both groups showed improvement with pleasant or unpleasant figures for the IAPS in an immediate free recall test. Likewise, in a delayed free recall test, both the controls and the AD group showed improvement for pleasant pictures, when education factor was not controlled. The AD group showed improvement in the immediate and delayed free recall test proportional to the medial temporal <b>lobe</b> <b>structures,</b> with no significant clinical correlation between affective valence and amygdala volume.

40|$|PURPOSE: To {{investigate}} {{the phenomenon of}} reversible increased signal intensity of medial temporal <b>lobe</b> <b>structures</b> and cerebral neocortex seen on MR images of six patients with recent prolonged seizure activity. METHODS: After excluding patients with known causes of reversible signal abnormalities (such as hypertensive encephalopathy), we retrospectively reviewed the clinical findings and MR studies of six patients whose MR studies showed reversible signal abnormalities. MR pulse sequences included T 2 -weighted spin-echo coronal views or conventional short-tau inversion-recovery coronal images of the temporal lobes. RESULTS: All six MR studies showed increased signal intensity within the medial temporal lobe, including the hippocampus in five studies. All follow-up MR examinations showed partial or complete resolution of the hyperintensity within the medial temporal lobe and the neocortex. In one patient, results of a brain biopsy revealed severe cerebral cortical gliosis. Temporal lobectomy performed 4 years later showed moderate cortical gliosis and nonspecific hippocampal cell loss and gliosis. CONCLUSION: Significant hyperintensity within the temporal lobe is demonstrable on MR images after prolonged seizure activity, suggestive of seizure-induced edema or gliosis. Damage to medial temporal <b>lobe</b> <b>structures</b> by prolonged seizure activity indicates a possible mechanism of epileptogenic disorders...|$|R
40|$|<b>Lobe</b> <b>structures</b> {{due to the}} {{application}} of resonant magnetic perturbations (RMPs) have been observed using wide-angle imaging of light from He 1 + ions {{in the vicinity of}} the lower X-point in MAST. The data presented are from lower single-null discharges where RMPs of toroidal mode number, n, of 4 and 6 were applied. It has been found that, above a threshold value, the <b>lobe</b> <b>structures</b> extend radially, linearly with the coil current, both in L-mode and H-mode. It is observed that after {{the application}} of the RMP, as the toroidal rotation in the confined plasma decreases, the lobes extend radially, suggesting the plasma is less effectively screening the RMP field. Comparing the imaging data with results from vacuum modelling shows that this technique can accurately predict the number and poloidal location of the lobes, but over-estimates their radial extent. More accurate estimates of the extent of the lobes can be made by accounting for plasma screening of the RMP field. Qualitative agreement between simulation and experiment is found if it is assumed that the RMP penetrates 2 % in normalised radius from the last closed flux surface.

Using the path integral approach, we provide a pedagogical derivation of the equation for the phase boundary line between the insulating and the superconducting phase within the mean-field theory approximation.

We review our analysis of the physically relevant situation where a Josephson network feels the effect of random offset charges. We observe that the Mott-insulating <b>lobe</b> <b>structure</b> of the phase diagram disappears for large variance (σ > e) of the offset charges probability distribution; with nearest-neighbor interactions, the insulating lobe around q=e is destroyed even for small values of σ.
