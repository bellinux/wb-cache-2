40|$|Performed for the University of Michigan Industry Affiliation Program for Human Factors in Transportation Safety"February 2003. "Includes bibliographical {{references}} (leaf 28) Four otherwise identical sedans had an infrared-reflective (IRR) film {{applied to}} differing {{sections of the}} vehicles’ glazing. An experiment was performed using two independent variables: air conditioning output (two different settings) and IRR film placement (windshield and <b>front</b> <b>side</b> <b>windows,</b> windshield only, <b>front</b> <b>side</b> <b>windows</b> only, and no IRR film applied). Dependent variables included subjective assessments of thermal comfort as well as objective measures of skin temperature and cabin air temperature. Presence of the film significantly decreased skin temperature and cabin air temperature. Not surprisingly, {{the magnitude of this}} effect was larger in those conditions where larger surface areas of film were applied. Presence of the film was also associated with a significant increase in subjective assessments of thermal comfort, an increase that appeared to be at least partly independent of the air temperature inside the vehicle. That is, for any given air temperature subjective ratings of thermal comfort were better in those conditions in which the IRR film was applied. The data from this study support the conclusion that IRR treatment can reduce the time required to reach comfort during vehicle cool-down. Further research should examine the relationship between subjective ratings of thermal comfort and the reduction in radiant heat that is associated with IRR treatment...|$|E
40|$|This {{study was}} {{designed}} to test the implications for night driving of a proposal put forward by a window tinting lobby group to reduce the required minimum visible light transmittance (VLT) of <b>front</b> <b>side</b> <b>windows</b> of cars from 70 % to 35 %. A sample of 24 young (aged under 30 years) and 24 elderly (aged 59 or over) subjects were required to complete target detection and reaction time tasks using peripheral vision. These tasks were performed both through a clear or tinted front side window and both in the presence and absence of a concurrent visual tracking task performed on a computer screen {{directly in front of the}} subject. The contrast value of the targets to be detected also took two different values. It was found that the elderly performed worse on the task overall, producing 178 of the 179 target detection failures in the study and also registering longer reaction times than the young group. Reaction times recorded for the elderly group were also found to be longer when they were required to view the targets through the tinted window. Similar effects were found for the elderly resulting from the dual task manipulation (longer reaction times when performing the concurrent task) and from the target contrast manipulation (longer reaction times when reacting to the low contrast target). As this study was very conservative in nature, it is concluded on the basis of significantly longer reaction times for the elderly subjects when looking through the tinted window that industry pressure to lower the minimum VLT of <b>front</b> <b>side</b> <b>windows</b> should be resisted and that these windows should be required to allow 70 % of incident visual light to pass through to the eyes of the driver.

40|$|A {{consortium}} of German automotive manufacturers investigated the noise {{generated by the}} air flow around the A-pillar and the side mirror of a generic vehicle model and the noise transmission through the <b>front</b> <b>side</b> <b>window.</b> The DLR {{was responsible for the}} optimization of the microphone distribution on the <b>side</b> <b>window</b> and the post processing to distinguish between acoustic and hydrodynamic pressure fluctuations. The distribution of the microphones within the <b>side</b> <b>window</b> was optimized to increase ratio of the main lobe to side lobes with the limited number of microphones and space at hand.

Wavenumber space was chosen for display as it reveals different characteristics of the pressure fluctuations: acoustic components of the pressure propagate at the speed of sound. They appear inside the acoustic Mach-ellipse. Pressure fluctuations outside this ellipse are regarded as hydrodynamic fluctuations. Their energy is mainly concentrated in the “convective” ridge. Its position represents the convective flow speed...|$|R

40|$|The surface {{pressure}} fluctuations {{due to the}} flow separation in the A-pillar region on the <b>front</b> <b>side</b> <b>windows</b> of a passenger car is a dominant source of aerodynamic noise. Aerodynamically generated noise adversely affects vehicle occupant&# 039;s comfort and safety (due to fatigue caused by long time noise exposure). The size and magnitude of the A-pillar flow separation mainly depend on the local A-pillar and windshield geometry and yaw angles. The primary objective of this {{was to develop a}} computational fluid dynamic (CFD) and computational aero-acoustics (CAA) model to simulate aerodynamic flow and noise generation in the A-pillar region of a simplified 40 % scale vehicle with elliptical windshield radius at &plusmn; 15 &deg; yaw angles. Observations made from the CFD and CAA results showed trailing edge and boundary layer noise were generated, caused by turbulent airflow separation behind the A-pillar region. The trailing edge noise was dominant in the leeward region while boundary layer noise was seemed to dominate in the windward region. High sound pressure levels were observed on the vehicle body, close to the noise source, which gradually decreased as the aerodynamic noise propagated further from the vehicle body...|$|E
40|$|Problem statement: When {{a vehicle}} is parked under the direct sun, the {{accumulated}} heat is affecting many interiors inside the vehicle cabin, {{such as the}} vinyl materials of the dashboard, the leather covers and the electronic components. Also, it represents an uncomfortable operating period for the passengers. The studies under this topic are entitled by the vehicle manufacturers as "Vehicle Cabin Comfort". Approach: In the present study, experimental and numerical analyses were conducted. The experimental results were obtained from measurements on a salon car parked in un-shaded area. Six different cases had been investigated consisting of full windows closing case, four different windows opening settings and sun shade usage case. The temperature at 12 different locations inside the car had been recorded for many days and the mean values are used as initial and boundary conditions to run the 3 -D computational simulation. The CFD simulation {{was carried out by}} FLUENT software. Results: Both experimental and CFD simulation results revealed that the most hot air was accumulated in the top part of the cabin and natural circulation take place with large scale cavity due to natural heat transfer from the dashboard and the rear windshield. The drop down of the <b>front</b> <b>side</b> <b>windows</b> by 20 mm caused reduction in the front air gap by 20 %. The sunshade on the front had considerably reduced the heat accumulation inside the cabin, where the dashboard surface temperature dropped by 26 % and the maximum air temperature was found to be 27 % lower. Conclusion: The use of the sunshade and/or dropdown windows on both sides reduced the heat accumulation due to fresh air exchange with the exterior environment...|$|E

40|$|The {{research}} focusses on computational {{analysis of}} vortex generation behind A-Pillar of simplified model derived from Jaguar XF that excludes {{air from the}} underside of vehicle. This vortex formation contributes in generating wall pressure fluctuations especially at speeds higher than 100 km/hr. It is a collaborative work between Cranfield University and Jaguar Land Rover. Three dimensional pressure based incompressible flow using Large Eddy Simulation turbulence model is selected for computational analysis in FLUENT v 14. This used high parallel computing systems available in Cranfield University. In the initial phase, three grid resolutions (coarse, medium and fine) were prepared in ICEM CFD with fine case consisting of 10 million cells. Qualitative analysis includes extraction of slices, 3 -D and surface streamlines and pressure and velocity contours for capturing the unsteadiness due to the vortex formation over the <b>front</b> <b>side</b> glass surface. The iso-surface of Q captures the unsteadiness at the A-Pillar wake and side mirror wake over <b>front</b> <b>side</b> glass surface. It also reveals that the range of length scales captured were limited even at the finest grid resolution. Quantitative analysis compares the mean pressure (Cp) data with JLR results. Probes were located at 51 locations over the <b>front</b> <b>side</b> glass <b>window</b> that showed a good comparison; specifically for the fine grid; with maximum variation incurred at probes located in separation areas. For predicting the wall pressure fluctuations, a total of ten probes were located over the <b>front</b> <b>side</b> glass <b>window</b> surface.
