50|$|Founded in 1996, PEER {{operates}} {{primarily by}} investigating claims from public employees about government <b>environmental</b> <b>misconduct.</b> Because whistleblowers often face direct retaliation from the offending agencies, PEER encourages employees to act through {{the organization to}} reveal government environmental misdeeds. Once a claim is made, PEER investigates it, often using Freedom of Information Act requests. The organization then can choose to take a number of actions, including press releases or lawsuits. PEER also serves to provide legal services to whistleblowers who find themselves the target of agency retaliation. As of January 2011, PEER is formally affiliated with Climate Science Legal Defense Fund. not-for-profit organization established in 2011 to protect scientific research and researchers of climate science from think tanks and legal foundations that have taken legal action against scientific institutions and individual scientists.|$|E
40|$|This Article {{seeks to}} {{illuminate}} the lack of adequate legal remedies that are available for low-income, predominantly minority communities that have suffered historic environmental injustices. The Article not only discusses the lack of adequate legal remedies, but also proposes the use of local, state, and federal reparations programs for communities that have previously suffered environmental injustices; are still living {{with the effects of}} environmental injustices, by way of disease, air, soil, and water pollution; or are suffering current and ongoing environmental injustices. As has been recently illustrated by Michigan’s state action of providing lead-contaminated water for over a year to residents of Flint, Michigan, environmental injustices at the hands of local, state, and federal governments are, unfortunately, all too common. Certainly, governments are not the only entities perpetrating environmental injustices; however, because governments are charged with enforcing environmental and civil rights laws, their own perpetration of environmental injustice is sometimes even more egregious than <b>environmental</b> <b>misconduct</b> by private entities. This Article stems from the work of the University of Miami School of Law Center for Ethics 2 ̆ 6 Public Service Environmental Justice Clinic. The Environmental Justice Clinic began as a community-based project working with historic black churches in the West Coconut Grove neighborhood of Miami. The Environmental Justice Clinic, in partnership with these historic black churches, community stakeholders, and local nonprofits, has been researching the environmental injustice of “Old Smokey”—the aptly nicknamed City of Miami Municipal Trash Incinerator...|$|E
40|$|Organizational {{researchers}} have recently taken {{an interest in}} the ways in which social movements, non-governmental organizations (NGOs), and other secondary stakeholders attempt to influence corporate behavior. Scholars, however, have yet to carefully probe the link between secondary stakeholder legal action and target firm stock market performance. This is puzzling given the sharp rise in NGO-initiated civil lawsuits against corporations in recent years for alleged overseas human rights abuses and <b>environmental</b> <b>misconduct.</b> Furthermore, few studies have considered how such lawsuits impact a target firm’s intangible assets, namely its image and reputation. Structured in the form of three essays, this dissertation examined the antecedents and consequences of secondary stakeholder legal activism in both conceptual and empirical settings. ^ Essay One argued that conventional approaches to understanding political risk fail to account for the reputational risks to multinational enterprises (MNEs) posed by transnational networks of human rights NGOs employing litigation-based strategies. It offered a new framework for understanding this emerging challenge to multinational corporate activity. Essay Two empirically tested the relationship between the filing of human rights-related civil lawsuits and corporate stock market performance using an event study methodology and regression analysis. The statistical analysis performed showed that target firms experience a significant decline in share price upon filing and that both industry and nature of the lawsuit are significantly and negatively related to shareholder wealth. Essay Three drew upon social movement and social identity theories to develop and test a set of hypotheses on how secondary stakeholder groups select their targets for human rights-related civil lawsuits. The results of a logistic regression model offered support for the proposition that MNE targets are chosen based on both interest and identity factors. The results of these essays suggest that legal action initiated by secondary stakeholder groups is a new and salient threat to multinational business and that firms doing business in countries with weak political institutions should factor this into corporate planning and take steps to mitigate their exposure to such risks. ...|$|E
40|$|Organizations face {{increased}} pressure from stakeholders to incorporate {{a plethora of}} corporate responsibility (CR) and sustainability aspects in their business practices. Legal and extra-legal demands are dynamically changing; almost no organizational function is unaffected. Owing to the outsourcing wave of the last decade, in particular purchasing and supply management (PSM) plays an ever more important role in assuring sustainable production of the firm's products offered in the marketplace. The supply base of many Western firms has become increasingly global and spend volumes have shifted towards emerging countries. In {{order to avoid the}} risk of reputational damage to the buying company, the PSM department must ensure that their international suppliers comply with their corporate codes of conduct and that <b>environmental</b> and social <b>misconduct</b> at supplier premises does not occur. In this paper, "sustainability" refers to the pursuit of the tripartite of economic, environmental, and social performance. We contribute to prior research in the fields of sustainability and CR by extending insights of the dynamic capabilities view to analyze how the PSM function integrates sustainability aspects in its global supplier management processes. Based on four case studies in the chemical industry, we propose that profound sustainable global supplier management (SGSM) capabilities are a source of competitive advantage. These capabilities are path dependent and particularly valuable when organizations are receptive to external stakeholder pressure. Early movers in the field of SGSM reap competitive benefits to a notable extent as a result of resource accumulation and learning processes over time...|$|R
