25|$|Despite {{being made}} from the same grape and {{produced}} in neighboring areas less than 10 miles from each other, the wines of Barbaresco and Barolo do have some distinct differences. Located south of the river Tanaro, the Barbaresco zone receives a slight maritime influence which allows Nebbiolo to ripen <b>here</b> <b>a</b> <b>little</b> earlier than {{it does in the}} Barolo zone. This allows the grape to get to fermentation earlier with a shorter maceration time. The early tannins in a young Barbaresco are not quite as harsh as Barolo and under DOCG rules it is allowed to age for a year less than Barolo. The Barolo wines that tend to be closer in body, fruitiness, and perfume to Barbaresco wines are generally the ones produced near the villages of La Morra and Barolo. The most pronounced difference between the two wines is that the tannins of Barbaresco tend to soften quicker, which can make the wines more approachable to drink at an earlier age but won't allow it to age for as long as a traditionally made Barolo could. The smaller vineyard areas mean that annual production of Barbaresco is around 35% the production of Barolo and therefore the wines are not as widely available out on the market. However, the smaller area does generally produce more consistent profiles among the Barbarescos than across the more expansive Barolo zone.|$|E

Scott of The New York Times gave it a score of four out of five: [...] "If you're tired of... bluster and swagger, SpongeBob is your man." [...] Tom Maurstad of The Dallas Morning News also gave the film a B-minus grade: [...] "Being so good is what led to making the movie, and it's also the reason that many small-screen episodes are better than this big-screen venture." ...|$|E

Michael Atkinson of Village Voice wrote [...] "It's easily the most disarming and inventive movie made for genre geeks in years." [...] Harry Knowles of Ain't It Cool News wrote that this film is [...] "exciting, alluring and thrilling". whereas Empire gave the film a three star rating out of five stating that [...] "An undeniably handsome creation, but its excessive length and surplus of directorial flourishes merely exacerbate the emptiness of an initially promising plot". Lisa from Variety gave a positive review mentioning that [...] "a little Sergio Leone <b>here,</b> <b>a</b> <b>little</b> [...] "Sleepy Hollow" [...] there and, uh, martial arts-style confrontations are all deftly melded in [...] "Brotherhood of the Wolf," [...] an attempt to elucidate the French urban legend of the Beast of Gevaudan. This is a home-grown French actioner that wears its sincere desire to entertain on its flamboyantly tailored sleeve".|$|E
