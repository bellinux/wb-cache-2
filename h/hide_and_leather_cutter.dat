40|$|Traditional <b>hide</b> <b>and</b> <b>leather</b> {{handicrafts}} of Djennè (Mali) {{are in the}} abandon. Markets are shrinking just as {{the number}} of artisans is diminishing. The few artisans, who are struggling to make it their daily vocation, limit themselves to activities of repairing <b>and</b> creating small <b>leather</b> products that are sold for a minimal amount. The income from these activities is insufficient to even cover the daily expenses of their families, all the more since they use up their savings. Therefore, this text titled “traditional <b>hide</b> <b>and</b> <b>leather</b> handicrafts of the city of Djennè “aims, on the one hand, at establishing a relation between this handicraft and the administrative, environmental, historical and socio-professional contexts and on the other hand, analyses its technical complexities. And finally, after shedding light on {{the strengths and weaknesses of}} the <b>hide</b> <b>and</b> <b>leather</b> handicrafts of Djennè, some of the values that contribute to its heritage characteristics will be explained before suggesting strategies of enhancement of this heritage in order to make it a valuable element of local sustainable developmen...|$|R

40|$|Leather {{industry}} {{generates a}} large quantity of solid wastes based on proteins, fatty matters and salts which {{are difficult to}} process due to the high content of water (50 - 80 %). At international level there are few industrial plants for <b>hide</b> <b>and</b> <b>leather</b> reclaiming 1 - 6, obtaining of leather fibre boards, organic fertilisers and separation of fatty matters for direct use as boiling installation fuel. The European reglementations regarding organic waste disposal {{are more and more}} restricted and create a demand for research on new technology development for <b>hide</b> <b>and</b> <b>leather</b> wastes reclaiming. In our paper we present a new route for bovine fatty matter separation, extraction and catalytic transesterification for obtaining of biofuel for plant heat and biodiesel. The kinetic study of bovine fatty acids methanolyse has revealed the appropriate conditions for the reaction. Another direction of our researches was the separation of protein from chromium tanning salts by alkaline hydrolyse of leather wastes under atmospheric pressure conditions. A well defined collagen hydrolysate with average molecular weight of 10000 Da and amino acids content was obtained through the mathematical modeling of leather waste hydrolyse. The protein additive was used for designing of a new range of foliar fertilisers and was experimented with good results on horticol...|$|R

NPS is based in Wollaston, Northamptonshire, an area known for its shoe industry. NPS shoes {{are known for their}} Goodyear welt technology and use it in all their shoe production, this particular technique is needed to fix the Solovair sole onto [...] "Soft Sole Suspension" [...] boots and shoes. Shoe manufacturer R. Griggs Group Ltd. had the patent to produce Dr. Martens boots but not the technology so in 1960 Griggs and NPS collaborated to create a boot using a Solovair sole and a Griggs boot, the result was the now iconic Dr. Martens boot. The first pair left the NPS factory in 1960. NPS Shoes continued to make Dr. Martens boots and shoes under licence until the mid 1990s.

40|$|Although chrome is {{considered}} {{as the major}} tanning agent {{in the production of}} all types of <b>hides</b> <b>and</b> <b>leather</b> worldwide, it represents a serious source of environmental pollution. Therefore, polyamidoamine hyperbranched polymer (HPAM) was involved in pretanning of the depickled hides to enhance the chromium uptake during the tanning process. The key parameters which affect the exhaustion and fixation of chrome tan including shrinkage temperature of the tanned leather were studied. The results showed a significant improvement in the chrome exhaustion, the shrinkage temperature, and the texture and softness of the leather treated by HPAM...|$|R

50|$|Paraguay's {{earliest}} manufacturing industries processed <b>hides</b> <b>and</b> <b>leather</b> {{from its}} abundant cattle and tannin from quebracho trees. Small-scale manufacturing, especially textiles, flourished under the Francia dictatorship, when the nation's borders were closed.

Land sales to foreigners stimulated increased agricultural processing {{in the early twentieth}} century, including meat packing and the processing of flour, oilseeds, sugar, beer, and pectin extract. After the early 1900s, small-scale manufacturing in all subsectors grew at a slow, but steady pace, with some of the fastest growth occurring because of the shortages during World War II.|$|R

The first time, in the year 1569 by Juan de Tejo, but due to constant attacks from the indigenous population, it was abandoned, only to be refounded three years later (1572) by Juan de Salmanca. Carora flourished in colonial times having a population of nearly 10,000. As of 1911, the neighboring country was devoted principally to raising horses, mules and cattle; in addition to <b>hides</b> <b>and</b> <b>leather,</b> it exported rubber and other forest products. As of 2005 the main economic activity of the area is still cattle ranching, but on milk production and milk products. In the 1990s grapes and wine making became important.|$|R
