40|$|In {{this paper}} we generalize the {{classical}} theorem of Thue about the optimal circular <b>disc</b> <b>packing</b> in the plane. We {{are given a}} family of circular discs, not necessarily of equal radii, with the property that the inflation of every disc {{by a factor of}} 2 around its center does not contain any center of another disc in the family (notice that this implies that the family of <b>discs</b> is a <b>packing).</b> We show that in this case the density of the given packing is at most π/ 2 √(3), which is the density of the optimal unit <b>disc</b> <b>packing.</b> This result is used to obtain a discrete approximation to the Entropy functional in two dimensional domain...|$|R

40|$|For {{the binary}} <b>discs</b> <b>packed</b> in two dimensions, the <b>packing</b> {{fraction}} of <b>disc</b> assembly becomes {{lower than that}} of the monodisperse system when the size ratio is close to unity. We show that the suppressed packing fraction is caused by an increase of the adjacent neighbours with long bonds where the adjacent neighbours is defined {{on the basis of the}} Laguerre (radical) tessellation. For the poly-disperse systems in two and three dimensions, the packing fraction is shown to have a minimuma as a function of the poly-dispersity. Percolation process in the densely <b>packed</b> <b>discs</b> and spheres is also studied. The critical area (volume) fraction in two (three) dimensions is shown to be a monotonically increasing (decreasing) function of the poly-dispersity. Comment: 9 pages with 8 figure...|$|R

5000|$|The Model 655 {{removable}} disc drives {{were the}} first to employ floating or flying heads. Early marketing material made a big deal of this, but {{there were a number of}} problems that plagued all of the Century Series systems. Head crashes were common, because the head flew less than a human hair's width above the disc surface. (Unless a drive unit was repaired and carefully cleaned after a crash, the next <b>disc</b> <b>pack</b> loaded in that drive would also crash. And, if a crashed <b>disc</b> <b>pack</b> was loaded on an operational drive, it would destroy the head on that drive unit. Contributing to this was the fact that disc packs were hand-loaded: spun tight onto a spindle, then uncovered by hand, in open air, before the drive cover was closed. A head crash could be caused merely by repeatedly bumping the smoked polycarbonate pack cover against the edge of a disc platter while lifting it off. Although the typical head crash ruined heads and the pack, the worst kind of head crash was caused by an entire pack coming loose from its spindle and rising freely inside the machine while spinning at high speeds!) ...|$|E

40|$|Anchorages are {{important}} resources for certain hub ports, {{and they are}} increasingly in demand during peak periods. We evaluate the capacity of multiple anchorages by reproducing realistic mix of arriving vessels, dwelling time and the current practices in choosing anchoring spots within an anchorage. The model is validated by using historical data. We also propose methods for improving space utilization of anchorages. Our experiments with four real anchorages show that the space utilization is improved by 6 - 10 % with MHDF and WALLPACK_MHDF algorithms. This finding opens up possibilities of designating vessel anchoring spots for improved utilizations in the future.

40|$|Dependence of {{structural}} self-organization of granular materials on preparation and grain parameters {{is key to}} predictive modelling. We study 60 different mechanically equilibrated polydisperse <b>disc</b> <b>packs,</b> generated numerically by two protocols. We show that, for same-variance disc size distributions (DSDs) : 1. the mean coordination number of rattler-free packs vs. the packing fraction is a function independent of initial conditions, friction and the DSD: 2. all quadron volume and cell order distributions collapse to universal forms, also independent of the above. We conclude that, contrary to common wisdom, equilibrated granular structures are determined mainly by the packing protocol and higher moments of the DSD. Comment: 4 pages, 7 figure...|$|R
50|$|The A500, later renamed 40RH and 42RH (hydraulic {{controlled}} governor pressure) and 40RE, 42RE, 44RE (electronic controlled governor pressure, 1993-up), was an A904 derivative used in {{trucks and}} vans. Introduced in the 1989 model {{year on a}} limited basis, {{it was the first}} light-duty Chrysler four-speed automatic and was placed behind the 3.9 L and 5.2 L engines for light-duty purposes. Forward direct clutch drum (same as the A998) usually has a 4 friction <b>disc</b> <b>pack</b> - an A999 forward direct clutch drum with the 5 friction <b>disc</b> <b>pack</b> does interchange. Much like the later production A904 with a wide ratio gear a double wrap low-reverse band is used. An extension housing mounted (New Process built) overdrive unit was bolted {{to the rear of the}} case to provide a total of four forward speeds; the extension housing and its internals interchange with the 46-48RH/RE (A518/618) - when overhauling the overdrive unit transmission rebuilders usually would use replacement parts from the A518/618 overdrive section since the A500 internals are light duty e.g. number of friction discs and thick pressure plates. The overdrive housing (RWD/2WD) uses an output shaft yoke commonly shared with the A727 and its later derivatives except the A618/48RE. Electronic governor pressure was phased in during the middle of the 1993 model year where it was renamed as the A500SE - Jeep Grand Cherokees equipped with the 4.0L used the A500SE/42RE since the middle of the 1993 model year replacing the AW4. This transmission was replaced by the 42RLE in 2004.|$|E

We show that such packings cannot contain certain subpackings of Apollonian packings, namely those belonging to a family of Arbelos subpackings. We do this by showing that the unit complex numbers giving the directions of tangency within such an isometric-generated packing lie in a finitely generated subgroup of the circle group, whereas {{this is not the}} case for the Arbelos subpackings.

40|$|Panel SessionPg. 193 - 198 Special purpose {{machinery}} {{applications of}} flexible disc couplings with multiple convoluted diaphragms or disc packs {{at each end}} of the spacer are discussed. Couplings in this category were retrofitted on two compressor trains at a large ethylene plant. The couplings were a 44, 000 hp multiple convolution flexible disc coupling and a 25, 000 hp bolted <b>disc</b> <b>pack</b> flexible disc coupling. The installations were retrofits, as part of a program to uprate the compressor trains beyond the original mechanical ratings, at a minimum cost and with limited machine downtime. The user had overall engineering responsibility for selection of the type of coupling, and performance of the total installation. Selection of the coupling type, coordination meetings, design audits, quality control and installation procedures, and contingency plans were done with the full cooperation of the coupling, compressor, and turbine vendors. This resulted in uprating the trains with a high degree of reliability made possible by the careful application of these types of couplings. Based on experience gained from these installations, the following are problem areas: ? Multi-convolution coupling application ? <b>Disc</b> <b>pack</b> coupling application ? Quality control and installation procedures These comments are meant to convey experience with specific flexible membrane couplings, and to suggest considerations that may be applicable to them, and not to exclude other vendors, designs or circumstances that may be available or may result in different decisions or selections...|$|E
