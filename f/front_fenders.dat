5|$|Vehicles {{built in}} 1940 (only) were fitted with {{removable}} loading ramps, cable rollers {{to act as}} pulleys, and a reinforced tail gate to allow a Flak 30, mounted on a Sd.Ah. 51 trailer, to be quickly dismounted. From 1940 they were fitted with rifle racks over the <b>front</b> <b>fenders</b> and from 1942 these were given sheet metal covers as protection from the weather. Flak 38s were mounted on 10/4s beginning in 1941 although the platform wasn't widened until later. As the war progressed the guns were more often fitted with gun shields.|$|E

40|$|The {{existing}} {{designs of}} the car panel need to be studied by digitizing {{the surface of the}} panel of various car models. This research focuses on the static simulation analysis especially to strain, stress and displacement analysis of a <b>front</b> <b>fender</b> panel {{of the car}}. The main objectives of this research are to study the design of the existing exterior car body part, analyze and proposed the mechanism to improve the design using Finite Element Method software. To achieve that, three different designs of <b>front</b> <b>fender</b> panel were used, there are Proton Iswara, Honda EG and Proton Saga <b>front</b> <b>fender</b> panel. A 3 D Scanner machine used to scan the actual model of <b>front</b> <b>fender</b> panel and to convert the model into the simulation analysis format by using POLYWORK software. SOLIDWORKS software was used to create corner radius and surface of the <b>front</b> <b>fender</b> panel of the car. After that, analysis was carried out by using commercial Finite Elements software (ALGOR) to evaluate and analyze the behavior and surface of a <b>front</b> <b>fender</b> panel of the car. It is considered the function, design, strength and the rigidity of the stamping parts of the <b>front</b> <b>fender</b> panel. In this research, this <b>front</b> <b>fender</b> panel analyzed using the static simulation analysis for components with linear materials. For this simulation, two types of load will be applied {{on the surface of the}} <b>front</b> <b>fender</b> panel which are at all surface area and at selected surface area. The result will be analyzed based on the strain, stress and the displacement of the surface of the <b>front</b> <b>fender</b> panel. The comparison of strain, stress and displacement data of each car <b>front</b> <b>fender</b> model were done using graphs. With this, the process of digitizing the surface of the <b>front</b> <b>fender</b> model can be done easily. After that, a related study was carried out to know the properties of the <b>front</b> <b>fender</b> panel during the impact of the applied load. At the end of this research, the comparison data of various car <b>front</b> <b>fender</b> panels will be known and could be the basis for the future design. Besides that, the area between the optimum line and the minimum line for each graph analysis can be used as a guideline and a mechanism to improve the design of <b>front</b> <b>fender</b> panel in the future...|$|R

25|$|In 1960 the {{production}} of the 375 cc engine ended. In the <b>front</b> <b>fenders</b> round turn signals were integrated. The corrugated metal bonnet was replaced by a five-rib glossy cover. Simultaneously, the grille was slightly modified (flatter shape with a curved top edge).|$|E

25|$|The Charger Daytona {{introduced}} to the public had a fiberglass nose without real headlamps and a wing without streamlined fairings. The media and public loved the car, but were mystified by the reverse scoops on the <b>front</b> <b>fenders.</b> The PR representatives claimed it was for tire clearance. Actually, they reduced drag 3%.|$|E
25|$|Developed from mid-2005 to November 2005, it was {{a concept}} vehicle that previewed {{the design of the}} V36-based G coupe.

2500|$|Early 1960 models, {{particularly}} the V200 high-trim cars, featured extensive brightwork and ornamentation. An [...] chrome spear atop each <b>front</b> <b>fender,</b> an inner reveal {{ring on the}} deck lid's spare tire stamping, a [...] "V200" [...] nameplate on the dashboard, and stainless steel windshield and backlight reveal moldings, which were deleted from production, replaced with less costly flexible mylar-faced plastic locking strips—in approximately January, 1960. Early and late V200s had a continuous stainless steel molding following the tailfin crease as it swept {{down in front of}} the rear wheel, then continuing forward along the lower break line in both doors and the <b>front</b> <b>fender.</b> The radiator grille was brite-dipped stamped aluminum, and a central grille badge doubled as the hood release. Script [...] "Valiant" [...] callouts were placed in the center of the deck lid's spare-tire stamping and on each <b>front</b> <b>fender.</b>|$|R
25|$|<b>Front</b> <b>fenders,</b> hood, {{as well as}} {{front and}} rear bumpers are {{interchangeable}} with the 1965 and 1966 Classic. The rear bumper from 1965 and 1966 Ambassadors will interchange, {{as well as the}} dashboard, seats, and other inside trim pieces. Windshields and the doors with their side glass are interchangeable with all two-door Classic and Ambassador models.|$|E
25|$|V200 {{side trim}} reverted to the 1960 concept, {{following}} the tailfin crease and lower body break crease. However, the 1962 trim was more massive and contained an oblong triple-window effect {{at the rear}} of the body break crease. On Signets, the <b>front</b> <b>fenders</b> had an open-centred double spear, connected at the front and back, within which was contained a secondary body paint colour.|$|E
25|$|Hidden {{headlamps}} (also {{known as}} pop-up lights) {{were introduced in}} 1936, on the Cord 810/812. They were mounted in the <b>front</b> <b>fenders,</b> which were smooth until the lights were cranked out - {{each with its own}} small dash-mounted crank - by the operator. They aided aerodynamics when the headlamps were not in use, and were among the Cord's signature design features.|$|E

25|$|The KR200 {{replaced}} the KR175 in 1955. While {{using the same}} basic frame as the KR175 with changes to the bodywork (notably including wheel cutouts in the <b>front</b> <b>fenders)</b> and an improved canopy design, the KR200 was otherwise an almost total redesign. The rear suspension and engine mounting were reworked, and hydraulic shock absorbers were installed at all three wheels. Tire sizes were enlarged to 4.00×8.|$|E
25|$|In 1990 the Premier was {{substantially}} re-engineered. Standard were 4-wheel {{disc brakes}} and {{a stainless steel}} exhaust system. The electrical system was replaced with standard Chrysler parts {{that proved to be}} more reliable than the original Renix system. The exterior was changed slightly, the Design Giugiaro badges being removed from the <b>front</b> <b>fenders</b> as a result. The (unpopular) four-cylinder engine was officially dropped from the lineup, with the V6 remaining as the sole engine.|$|E
25|$|Starting with a Frost White 1968 AMX coupe as the {{development}} mule, Teague updated its front {{end to the}} grille and swooping <b>front</b> <b>fenders</b> of what was incorporated into the production 1971 Javelin. The concept car also featured the interior to {{what was to become}} AMC’s characteristic high-backed bucket seats and corduroy upholstery introduced in 1970. The concept car was repainted light metallic blue with red striping to match the interior. A short-wheelbase, two-seat 1971 AMX was not approved for production by the automaker, but Teague used this car as his daily driver.|$|E
