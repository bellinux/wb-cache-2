Lucas surprises her by coming, and the two get to hear their baby's heartbeat for the first time. Later, Lucas and Peyton learn that Peyton has placenta praevia and that having this baby could mean the end of Peyton's life. Lucas, afraid of losing her and raising a child that has to go through the same motherless state Peyton did, tries to guilt her into an abortion. They get past this and decide to <b>have</b> <b>the</b> <b>baby.</b> Lucas tells her that he wants to get married to her sooner, not because she might die beforehand, but because he loves her, and wants her to be his wife.

2500|$|Jobs's {{biological}} mother Schieble became pregnant {{with him in}} 1954 when she and Jandali spent the summer {{with his family in}} Homs, Syria. Jandali has stated that he [...] "was very much in love with Joanne ... but sadly, her father was a tyrant, and forbade her to marry me, as I was from Syria. And so she told me she wanted to give the baby up for adoption." [...] Jobs told his official biographer that Schieble's father was dying at the time, Schieble did not want to aggravate him, and both felt that at 23 they were too young to marry. In addition, as there was a strong stigma against bearing a child out of wedlock and raising it as a single mother, and as abortions were illegal and dangerous, adoption was the only option women had in the United States in 1954. According to Jandali, Schieble deliberately did not involve him in the process: [...] "without telling me, Joanne upped and left to move to San Francisco to <b>have</b> <b>the</b> <b>baby</b> without anyone knowing, including me ... {{she did not want to}} bring shame onto the family and thought this was the best for everyone." [...] Schieble put herself in the care of a [...] "doctor who sheltered unwed mothers, delivered their babies, and quietly arranged closed adoptions." ...|$|E

2500|$|The {{second part}} of the book is written from the {{perspective}} of Jacob Black, a werewolf who had also fallen in love with Bella. A month after the wedding, Bella calls her father, Charlie Swan, and says that she is sick. Charlie relays this to Billy Black, Jacob's father, and Billy relays it to the pack. Jacob thinks that Bella is now a vampire and attempts to lead an assault on the Cullens for breaking the treaty. When he arrives, he discovers that Bella is sick, but it is from her pregnancy, not a disease. Jacob begs Bella to abort the fetus and save her life, but Bella is determined that she will live long enough to <b>have</b> <b>the</b> <b>baby</b> and be transformed into a vampire. Jacob runs off in his werewolf form and keeps thinking of what Bella had said. This accidentally reveals Bella's condition to the pack, and because they think the baby will become a monster, the pack decides to kill the baby and Bella immediately. Jacob refuses, and when Sam uses an alpha command to force Jacob, Jacob accepts his bloodline as the true leader of the pack and breaks free of Sam's control. He runs off to warn the Cullens of the pack's plan to kill Bella. However, while en route, Seth Clearwater, one of the younger pack members, joins Jacob and makes note of the fact that neither of them can hear the others' thoughts and that they had formed their own pack. They warn the Cullens and take up patrol around the Cullens' property. Leah, Seth's older sister, joins them shortly afterward. After a chance remark by Jacob, they discover that the baby simply craves blood, and Bella has to drink it out of a cup for the greatest effectiveness. Bella gets better, but the fetus grows swiftly and the timing of birth is unknown {{due to the lack of}} any related medical knowledge on human-vampire births. Carlisle, the experienced doctor, is out of the house to replenish blood supplies from a hospital blood bank when Bella falls, detaching the placenta and inducing labor. The baby breaks many of her bones, including her spine, and she loses massive amounts of blood. In order to save her life, Edward changes her into a vampire by injecting his venom into her heart. Jacob, thinking that Bella is dead, and blaming Bella's daughter Renesmee as the cause, tries to kill Renesmee. Instead, he [...] "imprints"—an involuntary response in which a shape-shifter finds his soul mate—on her.|$|E
