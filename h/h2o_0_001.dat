40|$|Introduction: Preanalytical {{specifications}} for urinalysis must be strictly adhered to avoid false interpretations. Aim {{of the present}} study is to examine whether the preanalytical factor ‘time point of analysis’ significantly influences stability of urine samples for urine particle and dipstick analysis. Materials and methods: In 321 pathological spontaneous urine samples, urine dipstick (Urisys™ 2400, Combur- 10 -Test™strips, Roche Diagnostics, Mannheim, Germany) and particle analysis (UF- 1000 i™, Sysmex, Norderstedt, Germany) were performed within 90 min, 120 min and 240 min after urine collection. Results: For urine particle analysis, a significant increase in conductivity (120 vs. 90 min: P < <b>0.</b> <b>001,</b> 240 vs. 90 min: P < <b>0.</b> <b>001)</b> and a significant decrease in WBC (120 vs. 90 min P < <b>0.</b> <b>001,</b> 240 vs. 90 min P < <b>0.</b> <b>001),</b> RBC (120 vs. 90 min P < <b>0.</b> <b>001,</b> 240 vs. 90 min P < <b>0.</b> <b>001),</b> casts (120 vs. 90 min P < <b>0.</b> <b>001,</b> 240 vs. 90 min P < <b>0.</b> <b>001)</b> and epithelial cells (120 vs. 90 min P = 0. 610, 240 vs. 90 min P = 0. 041) were found. There were no significant changes for bacteria. Regarding urine dipstick analysis, misclassification rates between measurements were significant for pH (120 vs. 90 min P < <b>0.</b> <b>001,</b> 240 vs. 90 min P < <b>0.</b> <b>001),</b> leukocytes (120 vs. 90 min P < <b>0.</b> <b>001,</b> 240 vs. 90 min P < <b>0.</b> <b>001),</b> nitrite (120 vs. 90 min P < <b>0.</b> <b>001,</b> 240 vs. 90 min P < <b>0.</b> <b>001),</b> protein (120 vs. 90 min P < <b>0.</b> <b>001,</b> 240 vs. 90 min P< <b>0.</b> <b>001),</b> ketone (120 vs. 90 min P < <b>0.</b> <b>001,</b> 240 vs. 90 min P < <b>0.</b> <b>001),</b> blood (120 vs. 90 min P < <b>0.</b> <b>001,</b> 240 vs. 90 min P < <b>0.</b> <b>001),</b> specific gravity (120 vs. 90 min P < <b>0.</b> <b>001,</b> 240 vs. 90 min P < <b>0.</b> <b>001)</b> and urobilinogen (120 vs. 90 min, P = 0. 031). Misclassification rates were not significant for glucose and bilirubin. Conclusion: Most parameters critically depend on the time window between sampling and analysis.

40|$|The {{coagulation}} abnormalities in non-cirrhotic Budd-Chiari syndrome (NC-BCS) and non-cirrhotic {{portal vein}} thrombosis (NC-PVT) are unclear. We conducted this case-control study {{to investigate the}} coagulation profile of NC-BCS and NC-PVT in Chinese patients. We measured the levels of factors II, V, VII, VIII, IX, X, XI, XII, protein C (PC), protein S (PS) and antithrombin (AT) in blood samples from 37 NC-BCS patients, 74 NC-PVT patients, and 100 healthy controls. The levels and ratios of pro- and anti-coagulation factors were compared between patients with NC-BCS and healthy controls, between different types of NC-BCS and between NC-PVT and healthy controls. In patients with NC-BCS, factor VIII (P< <b>0.</b> <b>001)</b> was significantly elevated; factor V (P< <b>0.</b> <b>001),</b> VII (P< <b>0.</b> <b>001),</b> IX (P = 0. 003), X (P< <b>0.</b> <b>001),</b> XI (P< <b>0.</b> <b>001),</b> XII (P< <b>0.</b> <b>001),</b> PC (P< <b>0.</b> <b>001)</b> and AT (P< <b>0.</b> <b>001)</b> were significantly decreased; and no difference was observed for factor II (P = 0. 088) and PS (P = 0. 199) compared with healthy controls. Factor VIII-to-PC (P = 0. 008), factor VIII-to-PS (P = 0. 037) and factor VIII-to-AT (P = <b>0.</b> <b>001)</b> were significantly increased; other ratios were significantly reduced or did not show any difference. No differences were observed between different types of NC-BCS for individual pro- and anti-coagulation factors or the ratios between them.

40|$|Introduction: It is {{apparent}} that having a good inflammation in hemodialysis indications, methods of the procedure, recognition of the complications are common mistakes in emergency and internal medicine and they are life saving for patients most of the times. It is clear that our medical students have many problems in this field (hidden curriculum). Therefore, {{we decided to do}} a study on the subject. Methods: During 2011, forty interns of nephrology ward enrolled in this study. They filled a questionnaire containing questions about their general hemodialysis knowledge before passing the classes. After having six one -hour classes on HD essentials, complications and emergencies, they filled the questionnaire again. The data analyzed using paired t-test and the reported Mean ± SD P< 0. 05 considered significant. Results: The interns were satisfied in all the trained aspects like general hemodialysis knowledge (P< <b>0.</b> <b>001),</b> dialysis essentials (P< <b>0.</b> <b>001),</b> physical examination (P< <b>0.</b> <b>001),</b> AVF examination (P< <b>0.</b> <b>001),</b> volume reduction (P< <b>0.</b> <b>001),</b> anticoagulation (P< <b>0.</b> <b>001),</b> AVF failure management (P< <b>0.</b> <b>001),</b> HD complications (P< <b>0.</b> <b>001),</b> device setting (P< <b>0.</b> <b>001),</b> cannulation (P< < <b>0.</b> <b>001),</b> dialysis efficacy (P< <b>0.</b> <b>001)</b> and capability of patients education(P< <b>0.</b> <b>001).</b> Conclusion: Medical students had many problems with HD so that teaching of most essential aspects of hemodialysis can improve their knowledge which can be life saving in emergency situations...|$|R

METHODS: Age at menarche data were collected retrospectively by questionnaire from 81 606 women aged 16 – 98, resident in the UK and participating in the Breakthrough Generations Study. RESULTS: Menarche occurred earlier in women who had a low birthweight (Ptrendo <b>0.</b> <b>001),</b> were singletons (Po <b>0.</b> <b>001),</b> had prenatal exposure to pre-eclampsia (Po <b>0.</b> <b>001)</b> or maternal smoking (P 0. 01), were not breastfed (Ptrend 0. 03), were non-white (Po <b>0.</b> <b>001),</b> were heavy (Ptrendo <b>0.</b> <b>001)</b> or tall (Ptrendo <b>0.</b> <b>001)</b> compared with their peers at age 7 and exercised little as a child (Ptrendo <b>0.</b> <b>001).</b> Menarcheal age increased with number of siblings (Po <b>0.</b> <b>001)</b> independently of birth order, and had an inverse association with birth order after adjustment for sibship size (Po <b>0.</b> <b>001).</b> In a multivariate model, birthweight, ethnicity, weight, height, exercise, sibship size and birth order remained significant, and maternal age at birth became significant (positive association, Po <b>0.</b> <b>001).</b> CONCLUSION: Age at menarche was influenced by both pre- and post-natal factors, and these factors may affect {{breast cancer risk}} through this route...|$|R

40|$|Concentrations of {{persistent}} organic pollutants (POPs) are high in Inuit living predominately on the traditional marine diet. Adverse effects of POPs include disruption {{of the immune system}} and cardiovascular diseases that are frequent in Greenland Inuit. We aimed to assess the association between exposure to POPs from the marine diet and inflammation, taking into account other factors such as vitamin D. We invited Inuit and non-Inuit living in settlements or the town in rural East Greenland or in the capital city Nuuk. Participants completed a food frequency questionnaire and donated a blood sample for measurement of the two markers of inflammation YKL- 40 and hsCRP, 25 -hydroxy-vitamin D, eleven organochlorine pesticides (OCPs), fourteen polychlorinated biphenyls (PCBs), one polybrominated biphenyl, and nine polybrominated diphenyl ethers (PBDEs) adjusted to the serum lipid content. Participants were 50 through 69 years old, living in settlements, town or city (n = 151 / 173 / 211; 95 % participation rate). ΣOCP, ΣPCB and ΣPBDE serum levels were higher in Inuit than in non-Inuit (p< <b>0.</b> <b>001</b> / p< <b>0.</b> <b>001</b> / p< <b>0.</b> <b>001),</b> in older individuals (p< <b>0.</b> <b>001</b> /p< <b>0.</b> <b>001</b> /p = <b>0.</b> 002) and in participants with the highest intake of Greenlandic food items (p< <b>0.</b> <b>001</b> /p< <b>0.</b> <b>001</b> /p< <b>0.</b> <b>001).</b> Both YKL- 40 and hsCRP serum levels were higher in Inuit compared to non-Inuit (p< <b>0.</b> <b>001</b> /p = <b>0.</b> <b>001),</b> and increased with age (p< <b>0.</b> <b>001</b> /p = <b>0.</b> <b>001)</b> and with the intake of Greenlandic food items (p< <b>0.</b> <b>001</b> /p = <b>0.</b> 002).

40|$|Abstract Apoptotic protease-activating factor 1 (APAF- 1) is {{a central}} {{component}} of the intrinsic pathway of apoptosis. Our study aims at searching the role of APAF- 1 in iron overload myelodysplastic syndrome (MDS). Erythroid apoptosis rate, mRNA expression levels of APAF- 1, and caspase- 9 activity were determined by flow cytometry, quantitative real-time PCR, and colorimetric assay in MDS patients, respectively. In addition, K 562 and MDS-L cell lines were incubated with different concentrations of ferric ammonium citrate (FAC) or ferric ammonium citrate+desferrioxamine (FAC+DFO) in vitro to observe the alteration in erythrocyte apoptosis rate, APAF- 1 mRNA, and protein expression levels. More-over, as control, erythroid apoptosis rate and APAF- 1 mRNA expression were detected after silencing APAF- 1 expression by endoribonuclease-prepared small interfering RNAs (esiRNAs) in K 562 and MDS-L cell lines. Both erythroid apoptosis rate and APAF- 1 mRNA expression of the iron overload (IO) group {{were significantly higher than}} those of the non-IO group (P < <b>0.</b> <b>001</b> and P < <b>0.</b> <b>001).</b> There is a significant difference of caspase- 9 activity between the IO group and the non-IO group (P < <b>0.</b> <b>001).</b> Erythroid apoptosis rate and APAF- 1 mRNA expression of K 562 and MDS-L cell lines significantly elevated after FAC incubation in different concentrations (P < <b>0.</b> <b>001</b> and P < <b>0.</b> <b>001</b> for K 562; P < <b>0.</b> <b>001</b> and P < <b>0.</b> <b>001</b> for MDS-L), while erythroid apopto-sis rate and APAF- 1 mRNA expression in the FAC+DFO group declined (P < <b>0.</b> <b>001</b> and P < <b>0.</b> <b>001</b> for K 562; P < <b>0.</b> <b>001</b> and P < <b>0.</b> <b>001</b> for MDS-L).

Further examination of the data revealed more specific differences within separate subcategories. The MRLR was significantly different (p< <b>0.</b> <b>001)</b> between males and females with both right and left hands. With respect to sex and individual finger differences, the thumb (p< <b>0.</b> <b>001),</b> index finger (p< <b>0.</b> <b>001),</b> and middle finger (p= 0. 015) were statistically significant. For ridge pattern, whorls (p< <b>0.</b> <b>001)</b> and ulnar loops (p< <b>0.</b> <b>001)</b> had significant differences between the sexes. Racially, males and females had statistically significant differences from one another within the Caucasian (p< <b>0.</b> <b>001)</b> and African American (p< <b>0.</b> <b>001)</b> racial groups. Further investigation of variables independent of sex highlighted other statistically significant MRLR relationships.

40|$|The {{current study}} had two aims. The primary {{purpose was to}} examine the {{association}} between serum vitamin D levels and the ergometric evaluation of muscle strength, aerobic capacity, and speed in professional soccer players. The secondary aim was to evaluate the effects of the soccer off-season period on serum vitamin D levels. Sixty-seven Caucasian male soccer players (age 25. 6 ± 6. 2 and height 1. 81 ± 0. 08 m), members of two Greek Superleague Soccer teams and one Football-league championship team participated in this study. Exercise performance testing for the determination of squat jump (SJ), countermovement jump (CMJ), 10 (10 m) and 20 meters (20 m) sprint performance, maximal oxygen consumption (VO 2 max), anthropometry, and blood sampling were performed before (pre) and after (post) the six-week off-season period. Analysis of our results showed the following: (a) a significant correlations between serum vitamin D levels and performance parameters in both pre (SJ; P < <b>0.</b> <b>001,</b> CMJ; P < <b>0.</b> <b>001,</b> VO 2 max; P < <b>0.</b> <b>001,</b> 10 m; P < <b>0.</b> <b>001,</b> and 20 m; P < <b>0.</b> <b>001)</b> and post (SJ; P < <b>0.</b> <b>001,</b> CMJ; P< <b>0.</b> <b>001,</b> VO 2 max; P = 0. 006, 10 m; P < <b>0.</b> <b>001,</b> and 20 m; P < <b>0.</b> <b>001)</b> experimental sessions. (b) Vitamin D concentration increased significantly (P < <b>0.</b> <b>001)</b> following the six-week off-season period compared to baseline, {{while at the same time}} all measured performance parameters decreased (SJ; P < <b>0.</b> <b>001,</b> CMJ; P < <b>0.</b> <b>001,</b> 10 m; P < <b>0.</b> <b>001,</b> 20 m; P < <b>0.</b> <b>001,</b> VO 2 max; P< <b>0.</b> <b>001).</b> Our findings suggest that vitamin D levels are associated with the ergometric evaluation of muscle strength, as expressed by SJ and CMJ, sprinting capacity, and VO 2 max in professional soccer players, irrespective the levels of performance. Furthermore, our data reaffirm the importance of UVB on serum vitamin D levels. Moreover, reductions in exercise training stress may also have beneficial effects on vitamin D levels, suggesting a possible association of its levels and the training-induced stress.

All patients were divided into three groups: Group I included 20 patients with stage II AH and normal myocardial electrical stability; Group II included 20 patients with stage II AH and long QT syndrome (LQTS); Group III comprised 20 patients with stage II AH and heart rate turbulence (HRT). The control group included 20 practically healthy persons. The parameters of heart rate turbulence, QT-interval duration, potassium, magnesium, calcium, lactate and pyruvate levels were determined. Results. A total calcium level in patients of Groups II and III increased by 27. 14 % (p< <b>0.</b> <b>001)</b> and 29. 41 % (p< <b>0.</b> <b>001)</b> compared to Group I, and ionized calcium level increased by 27. 14 % (p< <b>0.</b> <b>001)</b> and 27. 65 % (p< <b>0.</b> <b>001),</b> respectively. The level of potassium in Groups II and III was 20. 63 % (p< <b>0.</b> <b>001)</b> and 19. 59 % (p< <b>0.</b> <b>001)</b> lower than in Group I, and magnesium level was 14. 51 % (p< <b>0.</b> <b>001)</b> and 12. 69 % (p< <b>0.</b> <b>001)</b> lower compared to Group I. The level of pyruvate in Group II decreased by 60. 53 % (p< <b>0.</b> <b>001),</b> and in Group III it decreased by 54. 84 % (p< <b>0.</b> <b>001).</b> The level of lactate increased by 27. 01 % (p< <b>0.</b> <b>001)</b> and 25. 24 % (p< <b>0.</b> <b>001),</b> respectively.

40|$|Background Improving {{the quality}} of care {{provided}} to patients by increased staff motivation, will increase patients’ satisfaction and leads to improved health. Method An interventional study was carried out among ENT ward patients at NHSL over a period of 2 years. Satisfaction regarding different components of patient needs was assessed in an interviewer administered questionnaire prepared in Sinhala, English and Tamil. This contained statements about initial management of patients, time factors, treatment and attitudes of the staff members, tidiness and orderliness of the ward, information delivery, discharge and the clinic appointment system. Pre and post interventional patients were selected by systematic sampling, each group consisting of 200 patients. Results The demographic distribution of the pre and post intervention categories was not significant. The mean score of satisfaction at base line was 3. 68 (73. 6 %). The mean score, 4. 81 (96. 2 %) following the intervention was significantly high. Also a statistically significant increase in the patient satisfaction was observed in initial management of the patients (P< <b>0.</b> <b>001),</b> time factors (P< <b>0.</b> <b>001),</b> treatment (P< <b>0.</b> <b>001)</b> and attitudes (P< <b>0.</b> <b>001)</b> of the staff members, tidiness (P< <b>0.</b> <b>001)</b> and basic physical facilities (P< <b>0.</b> <b>001)</b> of the ward, information factors (P< <b>0.</b> <b>001),</b> discharge (P< <b>0.</b> <b>001)</b> and the clinic appointment system (P< <b>0.</b> <b>001).</b> Conclusion The staff motivation program has resulted in a statistically significant improvement in patient satisfaction (P< <b>0.</b> <b>001)</b> compared to the pre intervention group...|$|R
40|$|Resistance {{training}} (RT) {{can provide}} several benefits {{for individuals with}} Type 2 diabetes. The {{aim of this study}} was to investigate the effects of resistance training on the strength levels and uric acid (UA) concentration in individuals with Type 2 diabetes. The study included 68 patients (57. 7 ± 9. 0 years) that participated in an organized program of RT for 12 weeks. The volunteers were divided into two groups: an experimental group (EG; n= 34) that performed the resistance training program consisting of seven exercises executed in an alternating order based on segments; and a control group (CG; n= 34) that maintained their normal daily life activities. Muscle strength and uric acid were measured both pre- and post-experiment. The results showed a significant increase in strength of the subjects in the EG for all exercises included in the study (p< <b>0.</b> <b>001).</b> Comparing the strength levels of the post-test, intergroup differences were found in supine sitting (p< <b>0.</b> <b>001),</b> leg extension (p< <b>0.</b> <b>001),</b> shoulder press (p< <b>0.</b> <b>001),</b> leg curl (p= <b>0.</b> <b>001),</b> seated row (p< <b>0.</b> <b>001),</b> leg press (p= <b>0.</b> <b>001)</b> and high pulley (p< <b>0.</b> <b>001).</b> The measured uric acid was significantly increased in both experimental and control groups (p< <b>0.</b> <b>001</b> and p= <b>0.</b> <b>001,</b> respectively).

40|$|Currently {{there is}} limited {{research}} documenting the changes in blood parameters, following Flexible Ureterorenoscopy. This study aims {{to determine whether there}} are any changes in haematology and biochemistry parameters, following Flexible Ureterorenoscopy for the treatment of kidney stones. 40 consecutive patients aged between 27 - 87 years (median 49 years) undergoing Flexible Ureterorenoscopy for the treatment of kidney stones were recruited (26 male, 14 female). Blood samples were collected from each patient at four time points: baseline (pre-operatively) followed by 30 minutes, 120 minutes and 240 minutes post-operatively. On these samples, routine haematological and biochemistry tests were carried out. In addition to the assessment of clinical parameters prospectively from the medical notes. There was a significant decrease observed following Flexible Ureterorenoscopy in the following parameters: lymphocytes (p = 0. 007), eosinophils (p = <b>0.</b> <b>001),</b> basophils (p = <b>0.</b> <b>001),</b> haemoglobin (p = 0. 002), red blood cells (p = <b>0.</b> <b>001),</b> platelet count (p = <b>0.</b> <b>001),</b> fibrinogen concentration (p = <b>0.</b> <b>001),</b> von Willebrand factor (p = 0. 046), C reactive protein (p = 0. 01), total protein (p = <b>0.</b> <b>001),</b> albumin (p = <b>0.</b> <b>001),</b> globulin (p = <b>0.</b> <b>001)</b> and alkaline phosphatase (p = <b>0.</b> <b>001).</b> In addition, there was a significant increase observed in the following parameters: white blood cells (p = <b>0.</b> <b>001),</b> neutrophils (p = <b>0.</b> <b>001),</b> activated partial thromboplastin time (p = <b>0.</b> <b>001),</b> total bilirubin (p = 0. 012), creatinine (p = 0. 008), sodium (p = 0. 002) and potassium (p = <b>0.</b> <b>001).</b> Limiting factors for this study were the sample size, and restriction on the recruitment time points. Significant changes were noted to occur in haematology and biochemistry parameters following Flexible Ureterorenoscopy. Some of the data presented in this study may represent the 'normal' post-operative response following FURS, as no major complications occurred, in the majority of our patients. This data on the 'normal response' will need to be validated but may ultimately aid clinicians in distinguishing patients at risk of complications, if reproduced in larger multi-centre studies...|$|R
40|$|Purpose: Inflammation with {{leukocytic}} infiltration, {{degradation of}} extracellular matrix (ECM), and depletion of vascular smooth muscle cells (VSMC) are pathological hallmarks of abdominal aortic aneurysm (AAA). The {{aim of this}} study was to further evaluate relationships betweenAAAand inflammatory biomarkers, interleukin- 6 (IL- 6), tumour necrosis factor-α (TNF-α), endothelin- 1 (ET- 1) and soluble urokinase-type plasminogen activator receptor (suPAR), by comparing levels in 65 -year-old men with and without AAA at ultrasound screening. We also evaluated whether any biomarker can independently predict AAA at screening, and clarified potential correlations between aortic diameter and blood levels of these biomarkers. Results: There were significant (p ≤ 0. 05) differences between subjects with and without AAA for the following variables: p-leukocyte count (TLC) (p< <b>0.</b> <b>001),</b> p-homocysteine (p< <b>0.</b> <b>001),</b> p-TNF-α (p = 0. 023), p-IL- 6 (p< <b>0.</b> <b>001),</b> p-ET- 1 (p = 0. 002), p-suPAR (p< <b>0.</b> <b>001),</b> ankle brachial index (ABI) (p< <b>0.</b> <b>001),</b> plasma (p) -creatinine (p = 0. 049), p-total cholesterol (p< <b>0.</b> <b>001),</b> p-high density lipoprotein (HDL) (p< <b>0.</b> <b>001)</b> and low density lipoprotein (LDL) cholesterol (p = <b>0.</b> <b>001),</b> smoking habits (p< <b>0.</b> <b>001),</b> and use of antihypertensive (p< <b>0.</b> <b>001)</b> and lipid-lowering (p = <b>0.</b> <b>001)</b> drugs. When the above variables were stepwise excluded in a logistic regression model, only p-IL- 6 (p = 0. 002), p-homocysteine (p = 0. 015), p-HDL (p = 0. 004), ABI in the right (p = 0. 005) and left (p = 0. 094) leg, smoking habits (p = 0. 003), and antihypertensive drug use (p = 0. 045), differed between groups. Significant correlations with aortic diameter existed for p-TNF-α (p = 0. 028), p-IL- 6 (p< <b>0.</b> <b>001),</b> p-ET- 1 (p = 0. 002) and p-suPAR (p< <b>0.</b> <b>001)</b> in the entire study population, and for p-TNF-α (p = 0. 023), p-ET- 1 (p = 0. 009) and p-suPAR (p = <b>0.</b> <b>001)</b> among men with AAA. Conclusions: Several inflammatory biomarkers were significantly elevated and correlated with aortic diameter among 65 -year old men with AAA at ultrasound screening. IL- 6, homocysteine and use of antihypertensive medication remained elevated in the logistic regression model, together with known risk markers for AAA such as smoking and signs of atherosclerosis...|$|R
40|$|To {{describe}} the {{ethnic differences in}} central corneal thickness (CCT) in population-based samples of ethnic Bai, Yi and Han people living in rural China. 6504 adults (2119 ethnic Bai, 2202 ethnic Yi and 2183 ethnic Han) aged 50 years or older participated in the study. Each subject underwent standardized ocular examinations and interviewer-administered questionnaires for risk factor assessment. CCT was measured for both eyes using an ultrasound pachymeter. Regression and principal component analysis were performed {{to examine the relationship}} of ethnicity and other factors with CCT. The mean CCT readings were 536. 4 ± 34. 2 μm in ethnic Bai, 532. 1 ± 32. 1 μm in ethnic Yi and 529. 6 ± 32. 7 μm in ethnic Han adults (P< <b>0.</b> <b>001),</b> respectively. There was a decreasing trend of mean CCT with increasing age across all ethnic groups. In multivariate linear regression models, increasing CCT was associated with younger age (P< <b>0.</b> <b>001),</b> male gender (P< <b>0.</b> <b>001),</b> Bai (P< <b>0.</b> <b>001)</b> or Yi (P< <b>0.</b> <b>001)</b> ethnicity, greater body mass index (P< <b>0.</b> <b>001),</b> higher systolic blood pressure (P< <b>0.</b> <b>001),</b> greater corneal curvature (P< <b>0.</b> <b>001),</b> deeper anterior chamber (P < <b>0.</b> <b>001),</b> and thicker lens (P< <b>0.</b> <b>001).</b> Ethnicity contributed significantly to presence of thin cornea (60 %; P< <b>0.</b> <b>001)</b> compared with other factors.
