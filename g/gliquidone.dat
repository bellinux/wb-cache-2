40|$|Background: Sulfonylurea {{primarily}} stimulates insulin secretion by binding to its receptor on the pancreatic β-cells. Recent {{studies have}} suggested that sulfonylureas induce insulin sensitivity through peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor γ (PPARγ), one of the nuclear receptors. In this study, we investigated the effects of sulfonylurea on PPARγ transcriptional activity and on the glucose uptake via PPARγ. Methods: Transcription reporter assays using Cos 7 cells were performed to determine if specific sulfonylureas stimulate PPARγ transactivation. Glimepiride, <b>gliquidone,</b> and glipizide (1 to 500 µM) were used as treatment, and rosiglitazone at 1 and 10 µM was used as a control. The effects of sulfonylurea and rosiglitazone treatments on the transcriptional activity of endogenous PPARγ were observed. In addition, 3 T 3 -L 1 adipocytes were treated with rosiglitazone (10 µM), glimepiride (100 µM) or both to verify the effect of glimepiride on rosiglitazone-induced glucose uptake. Results: Sulfonylureas, including glimepiride, <b>gliquidone</b> and glipizide, increased PPARγ transcriptional activity, <b>gliquidone</b> being the most potent PPARγ agonist. However, no additive effects were observed in the presence of rosiglitazone. When rosiglitazone was co-treated with glimepiride, PPARγ transcriptional activity and glucose uptake were reduced compared to those after treatment with rosiglitazone alone. This competitive effect of glimepiride was observed only at high concentrations that are not achieved with clinical doses.

Ischaemia was mimicked by incubating slices in a glucose free medium equilibrated with 95 % N 2 / 5 % CO 2. These conditions evoked a release of glutamate which was insensitive to tetrodotoxin and Ca 2 + indicating a non-vesicular origin. The release of glutamate evoked by a 6 - or 8 -min period of ischaemia was reduced by 25 - 40 % in the presence of lemakalim (10 microM), RP 52891 (10 microM) or galanin (0. 3 microM), whereas it was enhanced by 60 to 100 % in the presence of glibenclamide (1 microM) and <b>gliquidone</b> (2 microM).

Repeated administration of an antisense oligonucleotide (aODN) to the mKv 1. 1 gene (1 and 3 [*]nmol per single i. c. v. injection) produced a dose-dependent increase in immobility time of mice 72 [*]h after the last injection.

40|$|Aim.

Materials and methods. Based {{on the results of}} a retrospective open cohort study, the 5 -year risk of overall and cardiovascular mortality, myocardial infarction and stroke was estimated in patients with type 2 diabetes diagnosed in 2004 and treated by various oral hypoglycemic agents. Cox regression analysis was used to assess the risk of death from any course, death from cardiovascular disease, myocardial infarction and stroke. Results. Patients with type 2 diabetes treated with sulfonylurea drugs showed a significant 2 -fold increase of overall and cardiovascular mortality risk (p< 0, 01), 4, 6 -fold increase of myocardial infarction risk (p< 0, 01), 3 -fold increase of stroke risk (p< 0, 01), and 5 -fold increase of death risk compared with the metformin group (after stratification by age). The risk of total mortality, myocardial infarction, and stroke was higher in patients treated with glibenclamide, gliclazide, and <b>gliquidone</b> than in the metformin group. Patients treated with gliclazide had a significantly lower risk of overall and cardiovascular mortality in comparison with the glibenclamide group. Conclusion.

40|$|Post-transplant {{diabetes}} mellitus {{is a frequent}} complication of solid organ transplantation that generally requires treatment with lifestyle interventions and antidiabetic medication. A number of demonstrated and potential pharmacokinetic drug-drug interactions (DDIs) exist between commonly used immunosuppressants and antidiabetic drugs, which are comprehensively summarized in this review. Cyclosporine (CsA) itself inhibits the cytochrome P 450 (CYP) 3 A 4 enzyme {{and a variety of}} drug transporters. As a result, it increases exposure to repaglinide and sitagliptin, will likely increase the exposure to nateglinide, glyburide, saxagliptin, vildagliptin and alogliptin, and could theoretically increase the exposure to <b>gliquidone</b> and several sodium-glucose transporter (SGLT) - 2 inhibitors. Currently available data, although limited, suggest that these increases are modest and, particularly with regard to gliptins and SGLT- 2 inhibitors, unlikely to result in hypoglycemia. The interaction with repaglinide is more pronounced but does not preclude concomitant use if repaglinide dose is gradually titrated. Mycophenolate mofetil and azathioprine do not engage in DDIs with any antidiabetic drug. Although calcineurin inhibitors (CNIs) and mammalian target of rapamycin inhibitors (mTORi) are intrinsically prone to DDIs, their disposition is not influenced by metformin, pioglitazone, sulfonylureas (except possibly glyburide) or insulin. An effect of gliptins on the disposition of CNIs and mTORi is unlikely, but has not been definitively ruled out. Based on their disposition profiles, glyburide and canagliflozin could affect CNI and mTORi disposition although this requires further study. Finally, delayed gastric emptying as a result of glucagon-like peptide- 1 agonists seems to have a limited, but not necessarily negligible effect on CNI disposition. status: publishe...|$|E
40|$|In starved mice, the {{anorectic}} {{activity of}} methylamine (MET) and benzylamine (BZ), both substrates of semicarbazide-sensitive benzylamine oxidases (Bz-SSAO), was {{compared with that}} of the potassium channel blocking agents charybdotoxin (ChTX), tetraethylammonium (TEA), <b>gliquidone</b> (GLI), ammonium chloride (NH 4 +) and of the anoressants amphetamine (AMPH) and nicotine (NIC). After i. c. v. administration, an approximate ranking order of potency was: ChTX⩾AMPH>NIC=TEA⩾GLI⩾MET>BZ>NH 4 +. Clorgyline (2. 5 [*]mg[*]kg− 1 i. p.) or deprenyl (10 [*]mg[*]kg− 1 i. p.) potentiated the anorectic effect of i. c. v. -administered BZ, NIC and AMPH. The effect of TEA was increased only by deprenyl, while MET, NH 4 +, ChTX and GLI were not affected by either of the inhibitors. The Bz-SSAO inhibitors α-aminoguanidine (50 [*]mg[*]kg− 1 i. p.), B 24 (100 [*]mg[*]kg− 1 i. p.) and MDL 72274 (2. 5 [*]mg[*]kg− 1 i. p.) potentiated the effect of i. p., but not of i. c. v. -administered MET. Antisense oligodeoxyribonucleotides (aODN) to Kv 1. 1 potassium channels abolished the effect of BZ and TEA, but was ineffective in reducing the activity of MET and other compounds. These results suggest that MET is endowed with peculiar hypophagic effects at dosage levels that are not able to affect gross behaviour in mice. The effect of MET, differently from BZ, seems unrelated to an increase in the central release of monoaminergic mediators, as well as to a Kv 1. 1 blocking activity.

40|$|This {{study was}} carried out with the aim to {{optimize}} the pharmacological profile of <b>gliquidone</b> (GLI) [...] a poorly bioavailable hypoglycaemic agent sparingly soluble in water [...] through complexation with cyclodextrins. In order to increase the apparent solubility of GLI, two cyclodextrins, namely beta-cyclodextrin (betaCD) and hydroxypropyl-beta-cyclodextrin (HPbetaCD), were tested. The effect of cyclodextrin addition on the aqueous solubility of GLI was evaluated by the phase solubility method at different pH values. The amount of GLI in solution increased upon CD addition according to A type plots. The aqueous solubility of GLI was enhanced more at higher pH values and using HPbetaCD. On {{the basis of its}} performance, HPbetaCD was selected as host to prepare GLI oral formulations. GLI/HPbetaCD solid systems were prepared at 1 : 2 molar ratio by co-grinding, spray-drying and freeze-drying and characterized by DSC, FTIR and X-ray powder diffractometry. Powders were amorphous and showed an improved dissolution rate in comparison with GLI. GLI/HPbetaCD co-ground and freeze-dried products were the most interesting systems, since they dissolved 62 and 94 % of total drug after 15 min, respectively. The hypoglycaemic effect of the most rapidly dissolving binary systems was evaluated after oral administration in fasted rats by measuring plasma glucose level in the time interval 0. 5 - 36 h and compared to free GLI. Our findings indicate that cyclodextrin-containing formulations not only provide an onset of hypoglycaemic effect faster than GLI, but also enhance significantly the pharmacological effect due to improved biopharmaceutics. The association GLI/HPbetaCD allows a reduction of the oral dose and is expected to provide a better control over drug side effects, contributing to improve safety and efficacy of GLI...|$|E
