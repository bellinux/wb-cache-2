500|$|In {{military}} intelligence, the Russian doctrine roughly {{corresponds to}} Western notions of denial and deception. The United States Army's Glossary of Soviet Military Terminology from 1955 defined maskirovka as [...] "camouflage; concealment; disguise." [...] The International Dictionary of Intelligence from 1990 defined {{it as the}} Russian military intelligence (GRU) term for deception. Robert Pringle's 2006 Historical Dictionary of Russian and Soviet Intelligence defined it as strategic deception. Scott Gerwehr's The Art of Darkness summarized it as deception and operational security. The historian Tom Cubbage commented that military deception was enormously successful for the Soviets, and whatever the United States might think, for the Soviet Union <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>something</b> <b>to</b> make use of both in war and in peacetime. An article in The Moscow Times explained: [...] "But маскировка has a broader military meaning: strategic, operational, physical and tactical deception. Apparently in U.S. military terminology, this is called either CC (camouflage, concealment and deception) or more recently D (denial and deception). It is the whole shebang—from guys in ski masks or uniforms with no insignia, to undercover activities, to hidden weapons transfers, to—well, starting a civil war but pretending that you've done nothing of the sort." ...|$|E
500|$|Nash was {{slower and}} more portly {{than he was}} in the 1930s, short of match {{practice}} and forced to spend most Sundays in hospital having fluid drained from his injured knees swollen from the exertions of the day before, forcing South Melbourne coach Bull Adams to nurse Nash through the season. Additionally, in the Round 5 match against Footscray, he tore the webbing between his fingers which later became infected, causing him to miss the Round 6 match against North Melbourne and although Nash wore a special leather glove to protect his hand, the injury would trouble him {{for the rest of the}} season. Despite these setbacks, Nash could still be a match winner and many opposition players saw him as the key player for South Melbourne. Nash's best return for the year was seven goals against St Kilda in Round 12 and he twice kicked six goals in a match; against Geelong in Round 15 and Fitzroy in Round 18. When an opposition player did well against Nash, <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>something</b> <b>to</b> savour; years later leading Richmond player Don [...] "Mopsy" [...] Fraser wrote [...] "Trouncing Nash does a lot for your confidence, even an ageing Nash." ...|$|E
500|$|Lofton {{was again}} on the move when on December 23, 2003, the New York Yankees signed him to a two-year, $6.2 million contract. During a Yankees' road game at Cleveland, Lofton {{recorded}} his 2,000th career hit. After Lofton's single, Indians fans began an ovation in honor of Lofton. [...] "I didn't know what to expect. I figured I'd get a few claps. It was touching. I tipped my hat, but they just kept going. If there was a storybook {{way for me to}} get it, to get it in Cleveland, <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>something</b> <b>to</b> remember." [...] New York finished the regular season with an AL-best record, 10161. To begin the post-season, the Yankees defeated the Minnesota Twins, three games to one, in the 2004 ALDS. In the 2004 ALCS against the Boston Red Sox, the Yankees had built a 20 series lead when Lofton stated, [...] "My ultimate goal is for me to try to win a championship. I'm at a point in my career [...] I've been here for 13 years, and gotten close. This is an opportunity for me to have a chance at it again." [...] Then Yankees would go up in the series three games to none before becoming the first team in MLB history to lose a series after holding a 30 series.|$|E

2500|$|Friedrich Nietzsche {{characterized}} nihilism as emptying the world, {{and especially}} human existence, of meaning, purpose, comprehensible truth, and essential value; succinctly, nihilism {{is the process}} of [...] "the devaluing of the highest values". Seeing the nihilist as a natural result of the idea that God is dead, and insisting <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>something</b> <b>to</b> overcome, his questioning of the nihilist's life-negating values returned meaning to the Earth.|$|E
2500|$|EastEnders writer Sarah Phelps has {{described}} the character as sharp, smart with elements of her mother in her. Phelps adds [...] "she had a sharp tongue and a quick mind...you could see her looking at her family and looking at Walford...and thinking 'this ain't for me'." [...] Sophie Lawrence has said, [...] "Diane {{was a bit of}} a wild child...she was a bit naughty, she was always in trouble. I think <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>something</b> <b>to</b> do with losing her mother at an early age...She ran away [...] to make a statement. I think it was a 'notice me' kind of thing. It worked." ...|$|E
2500|$|Park advocates {{defined the}} Bow River within Calgary as the city's nature: <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>something</b> <b>to</b> be {{protected}} for and {{enjoyed by the}} public. However, as progress {{was made in the}} parks' creation, this [...] "environmental" [...] view of the Bow's nature proved selective. For example, trees were not to be cut down, but landscaping to accommodate cyclists was endorsed. In short, the river was valued above all when it suited human goals. Calgary eventually developed an extensive plan for the Bow River's park system, and it is considered an important element of Calgary's self-image today.|$|E

2500|$|Laurie's parents, {{who were}} of Scottish descent, {{attended}} St. Columba's Presbyterian Church of England (now United Reformed Church) in Oxford. He notes that [...] "belief in God didn't play {{a large role}} in my home, but a certain attitude to life and the living of it did". He followed this by stating, [...] "Pleasure was something that was treated with great suspicion, pleasure was something that... I was going to say it had to be earned but even the earning of it didn't really work. <b>It</b> <b>was</b> <b>something</b> <b>to</b> this day, I mean, I carry that with me. I find pleasure a difficult thing; I don't know what you do with it, I don't know where to put it." [...] He later stated, [...] "I don't believe in God, but I have this idea that if there were a God, or destiny of some kind looking down on us, that if he saw you taking anything for granted he'd take it away." ...|$|E
