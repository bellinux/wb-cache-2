5000|$|The Peugeot Type 181, {{also known}} {{at the time and}} {{normally}} advertised simply according to its <b>fiscal</b> <b>horse</b> power as the Peugeot 11HP, was a mid-range car produced between 1925 and 1928 by the French auto-maker Peugeot at their Audincourt plant.|$|E
50|$|The cars {{also became}} known as Lion-Peugeot 10 hp models. This was a {{reference}} to their <b>fiscal</b> <b>horse</b> power, applying a system of car classification for taxation purposes recently established in France. Tax horsepower then, and for several decades to come, was defined purely {{as a function of}} the combined surface area of the engine’s cylinders, this being far easier to assess consistently and accurately than the actual power produced by an engine. In 1913 fiscal horse-power still tended to equate approximately to actual horse-power, although the two would diverge subsequently, as engines became more efficient at extracting power from a given sum of cylinder diameters. Eventually, in the second half of the twentieth century, more complex (and less internationally consistent) definitions of <b>fiscal</b> <b>horse</b> power would replace those defined only by cylinder diameters.|$|E
50|$|The car was {{the first}} of several Lion-Peugeot models that became known as a Lion-Peugeot 10 hp. This was a {{reference}} to the car’s <b>fiscal</b> <b>horse</b> power, applying a system of car classification for taxation purposes then being established in France. Tax horsepower then, and for several decades to come, was defined purely {{as a function of the}} combined surface area of the engine’s cylinders, this being far easier to assess consistently and accurately than the actual power produced by an engine. At this stage fiscal horse-power tended to equate approximately to actual horse-power, although the two would diverge subsequently, as engines became more efficient at extracting power from a given sum of cylinder diameters.

5000|$|The model's {{name was}} derived from [...] "PL" [...] for [...] "Panhard et Levassor" [...] (the {{original}} full name of the company), with the [...] "17" [...] coming from the sum of 5+6+6, being 5 CV (<b>fiscal</b> <b>horses,</b> in the French power rating system) plus 6 for the car's six seats, plus 6 for the car's economy of [...]|$|R
50|$|The Peugeot Type 174, {{also known}} {{at the time and}} {{normally}} advertised simply according to its <b>fiscal</b> <b>horse</b> power as the Peugeot 18HP, was a large, powerful sedan made by Peugeot from 1923 to 1926. The Type 174 S was made until 1926. The engine displaced 3828 cc, large and low-revving for a four-cylinder engine, and produced a not inconsiderable 85 horsepower. The sport version sold 208 examples compared to 810 for the standard version.|$|E
50|$|It was {{powered by}} a single {{cylinder}} 260 cc air cooled four stroke engine. The engine's small size placed {{the car in the}} 2CV <b>fiscal</b> <b>horse</b> power category, and actual claimed power was only 6.5 hp. Supported by a three speed gear box, this permitted the manufacturer to claim a top speed of 70 km/h (44 mph). There were no doors, and the focus of sloping front of the car was a single headlight.|$|E
5000|$|It is {{not clear}} whether the D1 was ever sold in {{significant}} numbers, but production of the Rovin D2 started in 1947 at the company's newly acquired plant at Saint-Denis. The car still qualified (just) for the 2CV <b>fiscal</b> <b>horse</b> power category, but the engine was now a flat twin 423 cc four stroke water cooled unit. Claimed power output was now 10 hp and the car still featured a three speed gear box. Top speed was [...] "between 70 and 80 km/h (44- 50 mph).|$|E
5000|$|The Fiat Zero, known also as the Fiat 12/15 hp, {{was a car}} {{produced}} by FIAT from 1912 to 1915. (The letters 'hp' defined its <b>fiscal</b> <b>horse</b> power rather than its bhp.) At launch it sold for 8,000 lire, which later was reduced to 6,900 lire, the equivalent of 23,250 € in 2003. It was equipped with a 1.8-liter, [...] engine that achieved about 19.6 miles per gallon and could reach about 50 mi/h km/h. It was the first Fiat to sell more than 2,000 similarly bodied units {{and most of these}} were four seater bodies. In 1915 production came to an end when the factory was converted for war production.|$|E
50|$|The Austin Twelve is a {{motor car}} {{introduced}} by Austin in 1921. It {{was the second}} of Herbert Austin's post World War I models and {{was in many ways}} a scaled-down version of his Austin Twenty, introduced in 1919. The slower than expected sales of the Twenty brought about this divergence from his intended one-model policy. The Twelve was announced at the beginning of November 1921 after Austin's company had been in receivership for six months. The number twelve refers to its <b>fiscal</b> <b>horse</b> power (12.8) rather than its bhp which was 20 and later 27. The long-stroke engines encouraged by the tax regime, 72 x 102 later 72 x 114.5, had much greater low-speed torque than the bhp rating suggests.|$|E
5000|$|In 1935 a {{range of}} V-8 engined Matfords {{was put on the}} market which were very similar to the American Ford Model 48s with their V-8 3622cc engines. A French version {{appeared}} in 1936 as the model that {{has come to be known}} as the Matford Alsace, with a choice of a 2,225 or 3,621 cc V-8 engine: a cabriolet was also listed. The 1937 models were generally known at the time simply as the Matford 13CV and the Matford 21CV which followed the convention of the time by using the cars' <b>fiscal</b> <b>horse</b> power ratings as model names. [...] Both featured a V-shaped windscreen and in 1938 a US style timber bodied estate car joined the range. The steel car bodies were purchased from the coachbuilders Chausson rather than being built inhouse.|$|E
