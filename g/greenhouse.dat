50|$|The {{vegetable}} sorts being presently {{grown in}} <b>greenhouses</b> are lettuce, spring onion and spinach, aimed {{for the local}} market. As the production of vegetables in <b>greenhouses</b> is in the initial phase, the farmers confront many problems. One of the basic problems is purchase of seeds and seedlings for <b>greenhouses,</b> and special pesticides for <b>greenhouses.</b> Another problem is the impracticalityof installing heating in <b>greenhouses,</b> which makes the use of <b>greenhouses</b> throughout the year unviable.|$|R

The {{historic}} complex contains tropical, sub tropical and cold <b>greenhouses.</b> These <b>greenhouses</b> are world famous, but not a tourist attraction. The <b>greenhouses</b> are part of the Royal Park, and the royal private gardens and usually not open for visitors.|$|R
50|$|After the {{pumping station}} at the shore was {{finished}} in 1838 Persius designed and built up-to-date <b>greenhouses</b> and an orangery in 1839. The buildings were erected {{to the west of}} the coach house at the edge of the pleasure ground where three little <b>greenhouses</b> stood previously. The arcade of the orangery referred to the adjacent coach house. The <b>greenhouses,</b> flanked by little water towers, were aligned to the south at the southern gable end of the orangery. Figs, peaches, pineapple, prunes and strawberries were grown in the <b>greenhouses.</b> The area in front of the <b>greenhouses</b> was used for extensive seedbeds. Orangery and one part of the <b>greenhouses</b> were demolished in 1940 and reconstructed in 1981.|$|R

5|$|For potted flowers a lower {{temperature}} {{is used for}} precooling (5°C for 15 weeks), followed by 16°C–18°C in a <b>greenhouse.</b> For later blooming (mid- and late-forcing), bulbs are harvested in July to August and the higher temperatures are omitted, being stored a 17–20°C after harvesting and placed in cold storage at 9°C in September for 17–18 (cut flowers) or 14–16 (potted flowers) weeks. The bulbs can then be planted in cold frames, and then forced in a <b>greenhouse</b> according to requirements.|$|E
5|$|In 1995, GCC {{assembled}} {{an advisory}} committee of scientific and technical experts to compile an internal-only, 17-page report on climate science entitled Predicting Future Climate Change: A Primer, which said: “The scientific basis for the <b>Greenhouse</b> Effect and {{the potential impact of}} human emissions of <b>greenhouse</b> gases such as CO2 on climate is well established and cannot be denied.” In early 1996, GCC's operating committee asked the advisory committee to redact the sections that rebutted contrarian arguments, and accepted the report and distributed it to members.

5000|$|At Passy, {{close to}} the Parc de la Muette, he built another complex of <b>greenhouses,</b> called the Fleuriste de la Muette, {{especially}} for flowers and exotic plants. This complex was composed of thirty <b>greenhouses,</b> lit with gas lights, {{each with its own}} conditions devoted to different varieties of plants. One group of <b>greenhouses</b> was filled entirely with thousands of fuchsia, chrysanthemum, canna, pelagorium, verveine, calceolaire, and ageratum plants. Individual <b>greenhouses</b> were built to grow palm trees, ficus, camellias, solanum, Caladium, and begonias; and others for banana trees, hibiscus, ferns and other highly specialized plants. There were nearly three million plants in the <b>greenhouses</b> of the Fleuriste de la Muette, tended by about one hundred gardeners.|$|R

50|$|Gouda was a {{separate}} refugee camp. In Gouda, refugees were first housed in private homes, {{but at the}} end of October 1914 they were concentrated in vacant <b>greenhouses</b> at the Steensma nursery. As the <b>greenhouses</b> offered insufficient comfort for so many people, a temporary village was built on the front of the <b>greenhouses,</b> including a church, a school and a hospital. Behind the <b>greenhouses</b> was a village of 64 wooden houses in which approximately 350 people were accommodated. Other camps consisted of tents or barracks with living and sleeping areas.|$|R

40|$|Many <b>greenhouses</b> use {{artificial}} light to grow plants, causing visible sky glow. Initially, low density growth lights were used. With {{the introduction of}} high density grow lights, the sky glow luminance of <b>greenhouses</b> has considerably risen. In the urbanized western parts of Holland, old warehouses are pulled down for urban extension, and warehouses are concentrated in less urbanized areas. Typically, new built warehouses are equipped with high density grow lights and the scale of these warehouses considerably increased compared to traditional <b>greenhouses.</b> Consequently, residents in the vicinity complain about absence of darkness and light annoyance. In this study, 750 face-to-face interviews were conducted to assess light annoyance, along with other determinants of light annoyance. The results showed that at similar light output, light annoyance was higher in residents of areas unfamiliar with <b>greenhouses</b> than in residents of regions familiar to <b>greenhouses</b> (OR= 2. 26, 95 % CI 1. 20; 4. 27). Light annoyance in residents was further associated with higher luminance of the sky glow (OR= 1. 26, 95 %CI 1. 06; 1. 49). Remarkably, there was nearly no relationship of annoyance with residential distance to the <b>greenhouses.</b> Personal factors, including education, gender and attitude {{were found to be}} important in explaining light annoyance of <b>greenhouses.</b> The results of the study might be explained in two ways. First, the local community is not used to <b>greenhouses</b> and increased annoyance might be related to the sudden disturbance of darkness. Second, the <b>greenhouses</b> we investigated were situated in a rural area close to a highly urbanized area. It might well be that new residents mix with local farmers. According to Smith and Sharp (2005), these new residents may bring along a different set of attitudes which might translate into greater support for farmland preservation and growth management efforts. As a result, light annoyance of <b>greenhouses</b> might be increased in this area...|$|R
