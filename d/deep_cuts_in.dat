If energy use grows too fast, renewable energy development will chase a receding target. Likewise, unless clean energy supplies come online rapidly, slowing demand growth will only begin to reduce total emissions; reducing the carbon content of energy sources is also needed.|$|E
5|$|By 1950, the {{occupation}} of Japan was winding down, but MacArthur remained in the country as Commander-in-Chief Far East (CINCFE), a post {{to which he had}} been appointed by Truman in 1945. MacArthur had to deal with <b>deep</b> <b>cuts</b> <b>in</b> the defense budget that saw his troop numbers decline from 300,000 in 1947 to 142,000 in 1948. Despite his protests, further reductions had followed and, by June 1950, there were only 108,000 troops in his Far East Command. Cuts in funds and personnel produced shortages of serviceable equipment. Of the Far East Command's 18,000 jeeps, 10,000 were unserviceable; of its 113,870 2½-ton 6x6 trucks, only 4,441 were serviceable. On the positive side, the Far East Command initiated a program of reclaiming and refurbishing war materiel from abandoned stocks throughout the Pacific. This had not only recovered a great deal of valuable stores and equipment, it had also generated a useful repair and rebuilding industry in Japan. Meanwhile, the shift away from occupation duties had permitted a greater focus on training for combat.|$|E

[...] Reid impressed on the cabinet the need for drastic economy in all departments and, by 1925 (the last year of Greenfield's Premiership), the government at last showed a surplus, a state that would persist until the beginning of the Great Depression, {{with the exception of a}} small deficit in 1927.|$|E

2500|$|After his losing mayoral campaign, Chavous became what The Washington Post {{called a}} [...] "frequent critic" [...] {{of the new}} mayor, Anthony A. Williams, and had [...] "the chilliest {{relationship}} with the mayor" [...] of any Council member. Chavous was an early supporter of Councilmember Carol Schwartz's tax cut package in March 1999, which became law in May. Chavous also led a nine-month effort to reconstitute and reform the D.C. Board of Education. [...] After a long battle with Mayor Williams and other Council members, the Council approved a plan {{to reduce the size}} of the board, and make four of the nine members subject to mayoral appointment (with Council confirmation). Voters were asked to approve the [...] "hybrid" [...] board, which they did so in a close vote in June 2000. According to The Washington Post, the bruising school board battle helped and hindered Chavous politically. While his allies said it showed he could tackle tough problems, dissenters argued that Chavous avoided the real issues (lack of money for schools and crumbling infrastructure). Chavous blamed the lengthy legislative process on unnamed individuals who he said did not engage in good faith in the process, but critics argued that Chavous never engaged in the kind of political hardball that was needed to move the reform bill along faster. Larry Gray, legislative chairman of the D.C. Congress of PTAs, blamed Chavous for <b>deep</b> <b>cuts</b> <b>in</b> the school budget during the past four years, failures in the teacher certification program, and significant delays in getting technology into the classroom.|$|E

I gave him a dose of laudanum to send him to sleep and dressed these hurts as best I could. For three days he went on quite well.
