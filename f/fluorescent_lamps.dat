5|$|Acute {{beryllium}} {{disease in the}} form of chemical pneumonitis was first reported in Europe in 1933 and in the United States in 1943. A survey found that about 5% of workers in plants manufacturing <b>fluorescent</b> <b>lamps</b> in 1949 in the United States had beryllium-related lung diseases. Chronic berylliosis resembles sarcoidosis in many respects, and the differential diagnosis is often difficult. It killed some early workers in nuclear weapons design, such as Herbert L. Anderson.|$|E
5|$|Beryllium {{production}} saw a {{rapid increase}} during World War II, {{due to the}} rising demand for hard beryllium-copper alloys and phosphors for fluorescent lights. Most early <b>fluorescent</b> <b>lamps</b> used zinc orthosilicate with varying content of beryllium to emit greenish light. Small additions of magnesium tungstate improved the blue part of the spectrum to yield an acceptable white light. Halophosphate-based phosphors replaced beryllium-based phosphors after beryllium {{was found to be}} toxic.|$|E

5|$|The {{photostability}} of pigments can {{be enhanced}} {{by the addition of}} cerium. It provides pigments with light fastness and prevents clear polymers from darkening in sunlight. Television glass plates are subject to electron bombardment, which tends to darken them by creation of F-center color centers. This effect is suppressed by addition of cerium oxide. Cerium is also an essential component of phosphors used in TV screens and <b>fluorescent</b> <b>lamps.</b> Cerium sulfide forms a red pigment that stays stable up to 350°C. The pigment is a nontoxic alternative to cadmium sulfide pigments.|$|E

In 1934, he returned to England as Eastman visiting professor at Oxford University. While there General Electric asked him to report on activities at General Electric Company plc's research laboratory at Wembley. Compton was intrigued by the possibilities of the research there into <b>fluorescent</b> <b>lamps.</b> His report prompted a research program in America that developed it.|$|E

The station also uses acoustic ceiling tiles to reduce noise, in addition to using indirect lighting.

5|$|Aerial {{dispersion}} {{is important}} in this species, despite its restricted distribution. Queens never forage outside or leave the nest, unless under severe deprivation. Before nuptial flight, fully developed females start to occur during summer. Between 9 and 10 pm in January, queens and males start to emerge from their host nest and begin to mate. Observations show that the alates will climb up onto objects such as lighted <b>fluorescent</b> <b>lamps</b> and begin to fly {{after half an hour}} of endless running. When queens are looking for a host nest or wandering openly, M. vindex foragers may identify a queen and seize her; such behaviour suggests that workers actively recruit fertilised queens for their nest. Host colonies tend to be smaller and depauperated when compared to other colonies without any inquiline queens, but host colonies can still produce alate offspring.|$|E

5|$|The Tunnel of Light is {{an artistic}} display {{of color and}} sound {{surrounding}} the escalator at the station. 1800 <b>fluorescent</b> <b>lamps</b> and 44 speakers are installed behind a layer of glass along the corridor, steadily changing color and mood. The theme is based on different experiences of travel in time and place. There are light and sound combinations for all seasons and all phases of life. The project was initiated by Kristin Jarmund. The light system was developed by Per Åge Lyså at Intravision System, and the software that mixes sound and color was developed by Yngve Sandboe. The music was composed by Bjarne Kvinnsland, mainly based on recorded samples. Among these are text written and performed by Beate Grimsrud.|$|E
5|$|The trams were {{unidirectional}} and had {{a single}} door at the front and a double door in the middle, both on the right side. Class E also had a single door at the rear. The trams were originally delivered with two apartments, with a wall and inside door {{in front of the}} centre door. This was removed after the trams became smoke-free. They had a partial wooden interior, with linoleum floors. Various renovations changed the panelling, usually variations of brown and yellow. The trams originally had incandescent light bulbs, but these were replaced with <b>fluorescent</b> <b>lamps</b> after 1955. From 1970 to 1974, the trams were rebuilt to remove the conductor, and the driver was given space for a purse and ticket machine, as well as an announcement system. The E-series eventually had the rear door taken out of use and blocked with an extra seat.|$|E

40|$|Proper {{amount of}} light in a {{business}} office is important for health and productivity of the employees. On a sunny day, {{there may be more}} than enough light entering the office from outside to carry out the necessary tasks. Presently, the main source of light in most offices is the <b>fluorescent</b> <b>lamp.</b> Thus, It is possible to save energy by dimming the <b>fluorescent</b> <b>lamp.</b> Dimming of the <b>fluorescent</b> <b>lamp</b> is possible by changing the frequency of the sinusoidal voltage or current. Hence, there is a need of a control system to adjust the light from the fixtures based on the light entering the office from outside. The design of a light control system is possible if the simulation of <b>fluorescent</b> <b>lamp,</b> the electronic ballast and the light sensor is available. Presently, the number of light fixtures in a commercial office is based entirely on the activities performed in that office. No attention is paid to the outside light entering the office from windows. In this thesis, a fuzzy logic controller to dim the <b>fluorescent</b> <b>lamp</b> based on the availability of the outside light is presented. To carry out the design of a fuzzy controller, a Matlab-Simulink model based on the simulation of the complete light system is developed. The light system consists of an electronic ballast and a <b>fluorescent</b> <b>lamp.</b> The outside light is obtained from a light sensor installed on the frame of the window. The fuzzy controller has two inputs: one is the output of the light sensor and the other is a reference frequency equivalent to maximum light level of the <b>fluorescent</b> <b>lamp.</b> The controller output controls the frequency of the electronic ballast. The rule-base of the fuzzy logic controller is developed based on the operation of the electronic ballast, the <b>fluorescent</b> <b>lamp</b> and the light sensor. Simulation was carried out with equally spaced five and seven fuzzy sets for the input and output. The fuzzy sets were then tweaked {{to take advantage of the}} piecewise linear control surface provided by the fuzzy logic controller. The simulation results show that dimming the <b>fluorescent</b> <b>lamp</b> can result in a substantial amount of energy saving and thus reduced the cost of utilities...|$|R

To prevent this, <b>fluorescent</b> <b>lamps</b> must use an auxiliary device, a ballast, to regulate the current flow through the lamp.|$|E
