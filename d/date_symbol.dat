We also propose modifications to the code construction that alleviate this asymmetry. Simulation results show that these codes have an improved performance with no penalty...|$|E

"In {{the late}} eighteenth and early nineteenth centuries, tattoos were as much about {{self-expression}} as they were about having a unique way to identify a sailor's body should he be lost at sea or impressed by the British navy. The best source for early American tattoos is the protection papers issued following a 1796 congressional act to safeguard American seamen from impressment. These proto-passports catalogued tattoos alongside birthmarks, scars, race, and height. Using simple techniques and tools, tattoo artists in the early republic typically worked on board ships using anything available as pigments, even gunpowder and urine. Men marked their arms and hands with initials of themselves and loved ones, significant <b>dates,</b> <b>symbols</b> of the seafaring life, liberty poles, crucifixes, and other symbols." ...|$|R

There are two main versions of this novel in existence. The original one had 80 chapters. There was an illustrated edition of this version published in 1912. The other version also had 80 chapters and was published during the reign of the Tongzhi Emperor (1861–1875). Starting in 1964 and finishing in 1995, Sir Yang Ti-liang, former Chief Justice of Hong Kong, current Chairman of the Hong Kong Red Cross, combined the first chapters of these works (in an attempt to weed out the overabundance of supernatural elements) to create a 79 chapter version with 961 pages, which he translated into English.

5000|$|Like European beech bark, the American beech bark {{is smooth}} and uniform, making it an {{attraction}} for vandals to carve names, <b>dates,</b> gang <b>symbols,</b> and other material into its surface.

This carving was first reported in the 19th century, but is believed to have not been produced by Boone since he was an educated man who would not have written something so semi-literate. The beech finally fell over in 1916 during a storm; its age was estimated at around 325 years. Its trunk is now on display at The Filson Historical Society.|$|R

50|$|The Zapotec emerged around 1500 years BC. They {{left behind}} the great city Monte Alban.
