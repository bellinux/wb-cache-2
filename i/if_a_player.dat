5|$|<b>If</b> <b>a</b> <b>player</b> who {{has never}} played in an IIHF {{competition}} changes their citizenship, they must participate in national competitions in their new country {{for at least two}} consecutive years and have an international transfer card (ITC). <b>If</b> <b>a</b> <b>player</b> who has previously played in an IIHF tournament wishes to change their national team, they must have played in their new country for four years. A player can only do this once.|$|E
5|$|Among {{the other}} races {{developed}} were Grunts, or Unggoy (from the planet Balaho), viewed in game's fiction as cannon fodder. Depicted as squat and cowardly fighters, Grunts panic and run <b>if</b> <b>a</b> <b>player</b> or an NPC kills their leaders.|$|E
5|$|Draw on time: In {{games with}} a time control, the game is drawn <b>if</b> <b>a</b> <b>player</b> is out {{of time and the}} {{opponent}} has no theoretical possibility to checkmate the player.|$|E
50|$|<b>If</b> <b>a</b> <b>player's</b> fuse is unlit {{and they}} answer a {{question}} wrong, their fuse starts burning.|$|R
50|$|<b>If</b> <b>a</b> <b>player's</b> fuse is lit {{and they}} answer a {{question}} wrong, they lose ten seconds from their fuse.|$|R
50|$|A poker {{advantage}} calculator calculates <b>a</b> <b>player's</b> winning {{ratio and}} normalizes (see Normalization (statistics)) the winning ratio {{relative to the}} number of players. An advantage calculator, provides a normalized value between -100% and +100% describing <b>a</b> <b>player's</b> winning change in a locked domain. That is, <b>if</b> <b>a</b> <b>player's</b> result is -100%, regardless of the number of players in the game, the player will certainly lose the game. <b>If</b> <b>a</b> <b>player's</b> advantage is +100%, regardless of the number of players, the player will certainly win the game.|$|R
5|$|<b>If</b> <b>a</b> <b>player</b> {{catches a}} ball and falls into the dugout the batter is ruled out and the base runner is allowed one base.|$|E
5|$|<b>If</b> <b>a</b> <b>player</b> {{delivers}} a checkmate, {{the game is}} over and that player wins, no matter what is subsequently noticed about {{the time on the}} clock.|$|E
5|$|<b>If</b> <b>a</b> <b>player</b> moves a pawn to its eighth rank, it {{cannot be}} {{substituted}} for a different move of the pawn when the player has stopped touching it. However, the move is not complete until the promoted piece is released on that square.|$|E
50|$|Differing {{numbers of}} players result in {{different}} starting layouts, in turn imposing different best-game strategies. For example, <b>if</b> <b>a</b> <b>player's</b> home destination corner starts empty (i.e. {{is not an}} opponent's starting corner), the player can freely build a 'ladder' or 'bridge' with their pieces between the two opposite ends. But <b>if</b> <b>a</b> <b>player's</b> opponent occupies the home corner, the player may need to wait for opponent pieces to clear before filling the home vacancies.|$|R
50|$|<b>If</b> <b>a</b> <b>player's</b> fuse is unlit {{and they}} answer a {{question}} right, their fuse stays unlit while the others keep burning.|$|R
50|$|<b>If</b> <b>a</b> <b>players</b> creeps get {{to their}} exit, they lose a life. Once losing all their lives, <b>a</b> <b>player</b> {{is removed from the}} board along with all their towers.|$|R
5|$|<b>If</b> <b>a</b> <b>player</b> who {{has never}} played in an IIHF {{competition}} changes their citizenship, they must participate in national competitions in their new country {{for at least two}} consecutive years and have an international transfer card (ITC). <b>If</b> <b>a</b> <b>player</b> who has previously played in an IIHF tournament wishes to change their national team, they must have played in their new country for four years. A player can only do this once. The original IOC rules stated that an athlete that had already played for one nation could not later change nations under any circumstances.|$|E
5|$|Nationality – <b>If</b> <b>a</b> <b>player</b> played {{international}} football, {{the country}} {{he played for}} is shown. Otherwise, the player's nationality is given as their country of birth.|$|E
5|$|The RA {{does not}} extend from below the {{backboard}} to the baseline. Therefore, <b>if</b> <b>a</b> <b>player</b> drives the baseline and is not attempting to {{go directly to the}} rim, the RA does not apply.|$|E
50|$|<b>If</b> <b>a</b> <b>player's</b> piece {{lands on}} a square with an opponent's piece, then, as in Ludo, that piece is {{sent back to}} the opponent's base.|$|R
5000|$|<b>If</b> <b>a</b> <b>player's</b> fuse is lit {{and they}} answer a {{question}} right, their fuse stops burning and the player's fuse that isn't lit starts burning.|$|R
5000|$|... 14-4 - <b>If</b> <b>a</b> <b>player's</b> club {{strikes the}} ball {{more than once}} while making a stroke, the stroke counts and a penalty stroke is added.|$|R
5|$|Each time a {{successful}} attack is performed on a player, their health meter depletes. Players with low health stay stunned for longer when knocked down. A player can increase their health {{by picking up}} food items that randomly appear in the ring. Running and attacks drain stamina. <b>If</b> <b>a</b> <b>player</b> {{does not have enough}} stamina to perform a certain move, it becomes unavailable until they recover. Stamina is regained through not pressing the actions buttons or picking up certain items. Attacks which require more stamina are generally more effective. The stun meter only appears when the opponent is knocked down. It depletes gradually, but the stunned player cannot move until the Stun meter is completely drained. A player can reduce the stun meter faster by pressing the action buttons, or by receiving certain attacks. <b>If</b> <b>a</b> <b>player</b> is low on health, the stun meter will normally be higher, making pin attempts harder to resist. Once a player's health is completely depleted, it will only take one hit to stun them. Certain attacks to a stunned opponent will actually reset the stun meter.|$|E
5|$|Like {{previous}} games, Sonic collects golden rings, which {{protect him}} from a single hit by an enemy or obstacle, though they will scatter and blink before disappearing. Sonic starts {{the game with a}} limited number of lives; if he is hit with no rings in his possession, he will lose a life. <b>If</b> <b>a</b> <b>player</b> exhausts their lives, they will receive a game over.|$|E
5|$|Compared {{to other}} {{shooters}} where melee {{is usually a}} last resort, F.E.A.R.'s melee is a viable instant-kill alternative for taking down enemies. The stocks of all firearms {{can be used in}} close combat. Lighter weapons, while being less powerful, allow the player to move around more quickly, increasing their chances of melee. Movement speed is maximized <b>if</b> <b>a</b> <b>player</b> holsters their weapon, which also allows them to engage in hand-to-hand attacks with maneuvers including punches, kicks, and slides.|$|E
50|$|Note 1: <b>If</b> <b>a</b> <b>player’s</b> Playing Handicap is {{negative}} (a so-called “Plus” Playing Handicap) he gives Handicap Strokes to the course, commencing at stroke index 18.|$|R
30|$|Yuan et al. [49] {{recommend}} two {{procedures for}} deciding the next arrest. We apply these recommendations using social network centrality measures in two ways. First, <b>if</b> <b>a</b> <b>player’s</b> eigenvector centrality (Table  2) is increasing through time, law enforcement should arrest this player first because the player {{may be the}} next rising star. Second, <b>if</b> <b>a</b> <b>player’s</b> betweenness centrality (Table  2) is increasing through time, law enforcement should arrest the player last if {{it is important for}} investigators to not alert other players in the network.|$|R
50|$|<b>If</b> <b>a</b> <b>player's</b> {{starting}} {{building is}} built over, they may {{place it in}} any vacant spot on the board, or removed from play if no such space exists.|$|R
5|$|Firearms combat is first-person, with {{character}} points {{assigned to}} the firearms skill determining the shot's accuracy {{and how long it}} takes to target an opponent. Melee combat is third-person, with access to weapons such as katanas and sledgehammers for melee combat, or pistols, crossbows and flamethrowers for firearm combat. <b>If</b> <b>a</b> <b>player</b> sneaks up on an opponent, they can perform an instant kill; weapons provide unique instant kill animations. The player can block attacks manually or automatically, by leaving their character idle. They can use stealth in missions by sneaking past guards and security cameras, picking locks, and hacking computers to locate alternative routes.|$|E
5|$|<b>If</b> <b>a</b> <b>player</b> is dealt {{a pair of}} eights, {{the total}} of 16 is {{considered}} a troublesome hand. In fact, the value 16 {{is said to be}} the worst hand one can have in blackjack. Since sixteen of the other fifty cards have a value of 10 and four have a value of 11, there is a strong chance of getting at least an 18 with either or both split cards. A hand totaling 18 or 19 is much stronger than having a 16. Splitting eights limits one's losses and improves one's hand. Probabilistic research of expected value scenarios shows that by splitting eights one can convert a hand that presents an expected loss to two hands that may present an expected profit or a reduced loss, depending on what the dealer is showing. A split pair of eights is expected to win against dealer upcards of 2 through 7 and to lose less against dealer upcards of 8 through ace. <b>If</b> <b>a</b> <b>player</b> hits on a pair of eights, he is expected to lose $52 for a $100 bet. If the player splits the eights, he is expected to lose only $43 for a $100 bet.|$|E
5|$|In Division I and Division III National Collegiate Athletic Association (NCAA) hockey, {{the fighters}} {{are given a}} Game Disqualification, which is an {{ejection}} from the game and a suspension for as many games as the player has accrued Game Disqualifications {{during the course of}} a season. For example, <b>if</b> <b>a</b> <b>player</b> engages in a fight having already received a Game Disqualification earlier in the season, he is ejected from that game and suspended for his team's next two games. This automatic suspension has made fighting in college hockey relatively rare.|$|E
50|$|In {{order to}} win the players need to attack their opponents' {{authority}} using combat. <b>If</b> <b>a</b> <b>player's</b> authority is reduced to zero {{they are out of}} the game.|$|R
5000|$|<b>A</b> <b>player</b> with no valid move {{remaining}} loses. This is {{the case}} if the player either has no pieces left or <b>if</b> <b>a</b> <b>player's</b> pieces are obstructed from making a legal move by {{the pieces of the}} opponent.|$|R
50|$|<b>If</b> <b>a</b> <b>player's</b> {{character}} was {{revealed in the}} previous turn, or if there {{have not yet been}} four turns played, then the player must do the swap (or not) action.|$|R
5|$|In {{response}} to concerns that clubs were increasingly passing over young English players {{in favour of}} foreign players, in 1999, the Home Office tightened its rules for granting work permits to players from countries outside of the European Union. A non-EU player applying for the permit must have played for his country in at least 75percent of its competitive 'A' team matches {{for which he was}} available for selection during the previous two years, and his country must have averaged at least 70th place in the official FIFA world rankings over the previous two years. <b>If</b> <b>a</b> <b>player</b> does not meet those criteria, the club wishing to sign him may appeal.|$|E
5|$|In {{the novels}} Halo: Fall of Reach and Halo: The Flood, it is {{told that the}} Grunts are methane {{breathers}} and described as dog-like. They have methane suits {{that allow them to}} remove the breathing apparatuses they usually wear to sustain them in a non-methane atmosphere. In Halo Reach, <b>if</b> <b>a</b> <b>player</b> kills a Grunt in a particular way, their methane tank will ignite causing them to fly and bounce around the area out of control, causing damage if they hit the player.|$|E
5|$|Micro Machines is a {{top-down}} racing game: players observe races from above. Players race in environments such as {{breakfast and}} pool tables, work desks, and treehouses, driving toy vehicles such as powerboats, helicopters, formula one cars, and tanks that can shoot other racers. Courses have a predefined path that racers must follow: <b>if</b> <b>a</b> <b>player</b> leaves the defined route {{for too long}} they are {{sent back to the}} track. Many have obstacles such as cereal boxes on breakfast tables, and pencil sharpeners on desks.|$|E
50|$|The {{intended}} receiver {{may find}} himself <b>a</b> defender <b>if</b> <b>a</b> defensive <b>player</b> has <b>a</b> {{better chance to}} catch <b>a</b> forward pass. <b>If</b> <b>an</b> offensive <b>player</b> commits pass interference against <b>a</b> defensive <b>player</b> attempting to intercept a forward pass it is offensive pass interference.|$|R
50|$|On <b>a</b> <b>player’s</b> turn, {{they may}} make either a motion move or <b>a</b> {{directional}} move. <b>If</b> <b>a</b> <b>player’s</b> Commander is captured, their remaining pieces {{fall under the}} command of the capturing <b>player.</b> <b>If</b> all of <b>a</b> <b>player’s</b> pieces except for the Commander have been captured, the Commander is removed from play and the player is out of the game. Play continues clockwise until one player remains.|$|R
5000|$|Winning. <b>A</b> <b>player</b> with no valid move {{remaining}} win. This is {{the case}} if the player either has no pieces left or <b>if</b> <b>a</b> <b>player's</b> pieces are obstructed from making a legal move by {{the pieces of the}} opponent.|$|R
