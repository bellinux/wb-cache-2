5|$|Cordon area {{congestion}} pricing is a fee or tax paid by users {{to enter a}} restricted area, usually within a city center, {{as part of a}} demand management strategy to relieve traffic congestion within that area. The economic rationale for this pricing scheme is based on the <b>externalities</b> or social costs of road transport, such as air pollution, noise, traffic accidents, environmental and urban deterioration, and the extra costs and delays imposed by traffic congestion upon other drivers when additional users enter a congested road.|$|E

Wind projects provide local taxes, or payments in lieu of taxes and strengthen the economy of rural communities by providing income to farmers with wind turbines on their land. Wind energy in many jurisdictions receives financial or other support to encourage its development. Wind energy benefits from subsidies in many jurisdictions, either to increase its attractiveness, or to compensate for subsidies received by other forms of production which have significant negative <b>externalities.</b>|$|E

Actions with positive <b>externality</b> are usually in shortage, while those with negative <b>externality</b> are often excessive. With {{the aid of the}} <b>externality</b> theory, we can deepen our understanding of the problem of excessive paperwork and meetings and can find out some possible solutions.

40|$|In this work, {{we focus}} on the {{development}} of mathematical modeling of network <b>externality</b> processes. The introduction of the generalized network <b>externality</b> function provides a unified source of a tool for developing and analyzing the planning, policy and performance of the network <b>externality</b> process and network goods/services in a systematic way. This leads to fulfill all existing network <b>externality</b> assumptions as special cases. We study its properties and applications. This study provides quantitative descriptions, parametric representations of attributes and sensitivity analysis of network <b>externality</b> processes. In particular, parametric variations characterize planning, policy and performance for network goods. Furthermore, by using the US banking asset and deposit time series data sets and statistical methods, the dynamic model of network <b>externality</b> of the US banking asset with respect to the normalized US banking deposit as the financial market share is developed to illustrate the concept of generalized network <b>externality</b> process...|$|R

Assuming utility functions parameterized by the incidence of the <b>externality</b> and taking into account the resource constraints when deriving agents' indifference curves for consumption distributions renders possible to depict contract curves with and without the <b>externality</b> in the same box. The introduction of a market for the right to generate the <b>externality</b> extends the Second Welfare Theorem to hold in the presence of an <b>externality,</b> too.

5|$|The {{economic}} {{importance of}} nature {{is indicated by}} the use of the expression ecosystem services to highlight the market relevance of an increasingly scarce natural world that can no longer be regarded as both unlimited and free. In general, as a commodity or service becomes more scarce the price increases and this acts as a restraint that encourages frugality, technical innovation and alternative products. However, this only applies when the product or service falls within the market system. As ecosystem services are generally treated as economic <b>externalities</b> they are unpriced and therefore overused and degraded, a situation sometimes referred to as the Tragedy of the Commons.|$|E
5|$|While many of {{the costs}} of fossil fuels are well known, others (pollution related health problems, {{environmental}} degradation, the impact on national security from relying on foreign energy sources) are indirect and difficult to calculate. These are traditionally external to the pricing system, and are thus often referred to as <b>externalities.</b> A corrective pricing mechanism, such as a carbon tax, could lead to renewable energy, such as solar thermal power, becoming cheaper to the consumer than fossil fuel based energy.|$|E
5|$|Congestion pricing is {{a concept}} from market {{economics}} {{regarding the use of}} pricing mechanisms to charge the users of public goods for the negative <b>externalities</b> generated by the peak demand in excess of available supply. Its economic rationale is that, at a price of zero, demand exceeds supply, causing a shortage, and that the shortage should be corrected by charging the equilibrium price rather than shifting it down by increasing the supply. Usually this means increasing prices during certain periods of time or at the places where congestion occurs; or introducing a new usage tax or charge when peak demand exceeds available supply {{in the case of a}} tax-funded public good provided free at the point of usage.|$|E

Then, our paper investigates the spillover effect of training <b>externality</b> on earning’s dispersion. Firstly, our paper evaluates how training <b>externality</b> affects wage inequalities between and within workers who receive or do not received training. Secondly, the article proposes to test the idea that training <b>externality</b> might be a criterion of labor market segmentation. The results emphasize that training <b>externality</b> is {{a major determinant of}} wage inequalities between trainees and non-trainees. In particular, the training <b>externality</b> explains wage dispersion among trainees because employer can extract a rent from it to finance part of the training costs. Lastly, wage inequalities are better explained by the training investment of their firm than by their participation to a training program...|$|R
5|$|Congestion pricing or {{congestion}} charges is {{a system}} of surcharging users of public goods that are subject to congestion through excess demand such as higher peak charges for use of bus services, electricity, metros, railways, telephones, and road pricing to reduce traffic congestion; airlines and shipping companies may be charged higher fees for slots at airports and through canals at busy times. This pricing strategy regulates demand, {{making it possible to}} manage congestion without increasing supply. Market economics theory, which encompasses the congestion pricing concept, postulates that users will be forced to pay for the negative <b>externalities</b> they create, making them conscious of the costs they impose upon each other when consuming during the peak demand, and more aware of their impact on the environment.|$|E
25|$|Negative network <b>externalities,</b> in the {{mathematical}} sense, {{are those that}} {{have a negative effect}} compared to normal (positive) network effects. Just as positive network <b>externalities</b> (network effects) cause positive feedback loops and exponential growth, negative network <b>externalities</b> create negative feedback and exponential decay. In nature, negative network <b>externalities</b> are the forces that pull towards equilibrium, are responsible for stability, and are the physical limitations preventing states from reaching infinity.|$|E
25|$|<b>Externalities</b> occur {{where there}} are {{significant}} social costs or benefits from production or consumption that are not reflected in market prices. For example, air pollution may generate a negative externality, and education may generate a positive externality (less crime, etc.). Governments often tax and otherwise restrict the sale of goods that have negative <b>externalities</b> and subsidize or otherwise promote the purchase of goods that have positive <b>externalities</b> {{in an effort to}} correct the price distortions caused by these <b>externalities.</b> Elementary demand-and-supply theory predicts equilibrium but not the speed of adjustment for changes of equilibrium due to a shift in demand or supply.|$|E

It is shown that (i) the choice of the timing by managers entails the same profit that owners would have achieved by specifying the timing in the delegation contract; and (ii) firms move simultaneously if the degree of unilateral <b>externality</b> is small, while sequentially if the degree of unilateral <b>externality</b> is large, with the firm generating unilateral <b>externality</b> as a follower; the owner of the follower firm delegates to restrict output, while his/her counterpart does not delegate it.

40|$|The Neo-Classical {{economists have}} been {{recognized}} environmental problems {{as one of the}} typical examples of <b>externality</b> problems.

However, the fact that environmental problems are full of variety, from neighborhood noise to global warming, suggests us that it is inappropriate to treat them as a mere <b>externality.</b> In the part 1 of this article, the nature of environmental <b>externality</b> is identified as physical relationships between human acts and the environment, which contains uncontrollable aspects in the nature.

25|$|Markets where price {{negotiations}} meet equilibrium, but {{the equilibrium}} is not efficient {{are said to}} experience market failure. Market failures are often associated with time-inconsistent preferences, information asymmetries, non-perfectly competitive markets, principal–agent problems, <b>externalities,</b> or public goods. Among the major negative <b>externalities</b> which can occur as {{a side effect of}} production and market exchange, are air pollution (side-effect of manufacturing and logistics) and environmental degradation (side-effect of farming and urbanization).|$|E

25|$|Coordination {{games are}} {{closely linked to}} the {{economic}} concept of <b>externalities,</b> and in particular positive network <b>externalities,</b> the benefit reaped from being in the same network as other agents. Conversely, game theorists have modeled behavior under negative <b>externalities</b> where choosing the same action creates a cost rather than a benefit. The generic term for this class of game is anti-coordination game. The best-known example of a 2-player anti-coordination game is the game of Chicken (also known as Hawk-Dove game). Using the payoff matrix in Figure 1, a game is an anti-coordination game if Bnbsp&>nbsp&A and Cnbsp&>nbsp&D for row-player 1 (with lowercase analogues b > d and c > a for column-player 2). {Down, Left} and {Up, Right} are the two pure Nash equilibria. Chicken also requires that Anbsp&>nbsp&C, so a change from {Up, Left} to {Up, Right} improves player 2's payoff but reduces player 1's payoff, introducing conflict. This counters the standard coordination game setup, where all unilateral changes in a strategy lead to either mutual gain or mutual loss.|$|E

25|$|Comparing {{the market}} cost of {{recyclable}} material {{with the cost}} of new raw materials ignores economic externalities—the costs that are currently not counted by the market. Creating a new piece of plastic, for instance, may cause more pollution and be less sustainable than recycling a similar piece of plastic, but these factors will not be counted in market cost. A life cycle assessment can be used to determine the levels of <b>externalities</b> and decide whether the recycling may be worthwhile despite unfavorable market costs. Alternatively, legal means (such as a carbon tax) can be used to bring <b>externalities</b> into the market, so that the market cost of the material becomes close to the true cost.|$|E

Internalizing the <b>externalities,</b> in other words ensuring that the users of resource pay for all of the consequences of its use, can provide an alternate solution between privatization and regulation. One example is gasoline taxes which are intended to include both the cost of road maintenance and of air pollution.

One such strategic alternative in a two-product case would be a so-called mixed bundling- 1 under which the bundle and product 1 are offered, but the other product can only be purchased in a bundled form. The purpose of this study is to compare and contrast the impact of such asymmetry or symmetry in (direct) network <b>externality</b> and cost on the choice of bundling strategies. We model a monopolist firm that has a product in each of two categories and faces heterogeneous consumers.
