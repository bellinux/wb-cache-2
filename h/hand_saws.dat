50|$|Before {{the advent}} of the radial arm saw, table saws and <b>hand</b> <b>saws</b> were most {{commonly}} used for crosscutting lumber. Table saws can easily rip stock, but it is awkward to push a long piece of stock widthwise through a table saw blade.

50|$|Very early {{chainsaws}} used tooth configurations {{very similar}} to conventional <b>hand</b> <b>saws.</b> These were very simple saw teeth following a wave pattern (left, centre, right, centre) with no depth gauges as such, relying purely on bar pressure to limit the cutting rate. They were inefficient and slow in use, and were soon superseded by chipper chain. They required great skill {{and a lot of}} time to sharpen in the field leading to extended downtime between sessions.|$|E
5000|$|In {{woodworking}} and carpentry, <b>hand</b> <b>saws,</b> {{also known}} as [...] "panel saws", [...] "fish saws", are used to cut pieces of wood into different shapes. This is usually done in order to join the pieces together and carve a wooden object. They usually operate by having a series of sharp points of some substance that is harder than the wood being cut. The hand saw {{is a bit like}} a tenon saw, but with one flat, sharp edge.|$|E

50|$|The 4-masted replica Niña {{was built}} 1988-1991 by {{engineer}} and naval researcher John Patrick Sarsfield, British naval historian Jonathan Morton Nance, {{and a group}} of master shipbuilders in Bahia, Brazil who were still using design and construction techniques dating back to the 15th century. They built it from heavy, teredo-resistant Brazilian hardwoods using only adzes, axes, <b>hand</b> <b>saws,</b> and chisels. The sails were designed by Nance using square main sails and two aft lateen sails as were used by ships of this size {{at the end of the}} 15th century. The crew of Niña say that it can make about 5 - 7 kn, which is quicker than older designs of the era. The replica weighs 75 tons.|$|E

5000|$|Saw blade [...] "grabbing" [...] occurs more {{frequently}} during ripping than cross-cutting, and may manifest with both <b>hand</b> <b>saws</b> and bandsaws. It is more dangerous with a circular saw as {{areas of the}} blade close to the cutting area are moving in different directions. If a bandsaw grabs, the wood is pressed safely down into the machine table, as normal, and the saw may either jam, stall or at worst break the blade. If a table saw grabs, {{this is likely to}} be {{at the rear of the}} blade, where the teeth are rising up from the table and so may lift the wood upwards, out of control. The wood is then likely to catch the teeth on top of the blade and be thrown forwards, towards the operator. This accident is termed a [...] "kickback".|$|E
50|$|These saws are {{available}} {{in a number of}} configurations, including table top, free hand, and walk behind models. In the table top models, which are commonly used to cut tile and metal, the cutting wheel and motor are mounted on a pivoting arm attached to a fixed base plate. Table top saws are often electrically powered and generally have a built-in vise or other clamping arrangement. The free hand designs are typically used to cut concrete, asphalt, and pipe on construction sites. They are designed with the handles and motor near the operator, with the blade {{at the far end of}} the saw. Free <b>hand</b> <b>saws</b> do not feature a vise, because the materials being cut are larger and heavier. Walk-behind models, sometimes called flat saws are larger saws which use a stand or cart to cut into concrete floors as well as asphalt and concrete paving materials.|$|E

He worked at BHP steel works, in the coke ovens as part of the immigration program at the time, which required people to work for two years in an industry chosen by the Australian Government. A year after arriving in Australia, he built his own home on Warners Bay Road, Charlestown. It was hard work, as the acre block he selected, was dense Australian bush land. To clear the block he used <b>hand</b> <b>saws</b> and an axe. He built the home with a small loan from the Commonwealth Bank, coming home after his shift at BHP to cut timbers and paint. The house has remained relatively unchanged to this day.|$|E

50|$|Goombay music {{which is}} the {{original}} term used for Rake and Scrape in the Bahamas {{dates back to the}} 19th century where you had many bands playing many instruments together creating various sounds of early Goombay music. These instruments included the Banjo, Drums, Fife, Tambourines, Guitar, Wash Tubs, and Harmonicas and possibly even the <b>Hand</b> <b>saw</b> in certain settlements. It wasn't until the mid 20th century that the use of the Accordion, Goombay Drums, and the <b>hand</b> <b>saw</b> became a constant playing style that is known as traditional Rake and Scrape, and the combination of these instruments used to produce this sound has without any doubt originated in the Bahamas.|$|R
