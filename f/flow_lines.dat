The manufacturing system of interest is a three machine multi-product <b>flow</b> <b>line</b> with stochastic process times, producing eight different product types in large quantities. The performance of the feedback controlled <b>flow</b> <b>line</b> is compared to the performance of the <b>flow</b> <b>line</b> controlled by several common control methods: push, pull, conwip, and POLCA control.

40|$|Abstract — This paper {{proposes to}} analyze two <b>flow</b> <b>line</b> systems {{in which we}} include {{possibilistic}} data-the priority-discipline is possibilistic instead of probabilistic- and measure the performances of the systems with the effectiveness measure “waiting time in queue”. In a previous work we have analyzed and developed a queuing model with uncertain priority-discipline, using Zadeh’s extension principle. Because of it in this paper {{the analysis of the}} model takes the work realized by Prade as a starting point to incorporate an uncertain priority-discipline in a <b>flow</b> <b>line</b> system by means of a possibilistic distribution. To verify the validity of the proposed method, we calculate the possibility distribution of the priority-discipline and the possibility distribution of the performance measure “waiting time in queue”, in two <b>flow</b> <b>line</b> systems with different waiting lines: the determinist <b>flow</b> <b>line</b> system D / D/ 1 and the classic <b>flow</b> <b>line</b> system M / M / 1 / N with finite capacity. Since the performance measure is expressed by membership function rather than by crisp value, the fuzziness of input information is conserved completely, and more information is provided for capacity planning in <b>flow</b> <b>line</b> systems...|$|R

Glass and plastic will have a much greater translucency, with bubbles or <b>flow</b> <b>lines</b> often visible just below the surface. Staining between grain boundaries may be visible in dyed imitations.|$|E
25|$|The {{formulation}} of glasses using lead, alumina, and thallium to increase RI and dispersion {{began in the}} late Baroque period. These glasses are fashioned into brilliants, and when freshly cut they can be surprisingly effective diamond simulants. Known as rhinestones, pastes, or strass, glass simulants are a common feature of antique jewelry; in such cases, rhinestones can be valuable historical artifacts in their own right. The great softness (below hardness 6) imparted by the lead means a rhinestone's facet edges and faces will quickly become rounded and scratched. Together with conchoidal fractures, and air bubbles or <b>flow</b> <b>lines</b> within the stone, these features make glass imitations easy to spot under only moderate magnification. In contemporary production it is more common for glass to be molded rather than cut into shape: in these stones the facets will be concave and facet edges rounded, and mold marks or seams may also be present. Glass has also been combined with other materials to produce composites.|$|E
40|$|We {{propose a}} model in which between-individual {{differences}} in performance (heterogeneity) and within-individual differences in performance over time (variability) affect <b>flow</b> <b>line</b> performance. The impact of heterogeneity and variability is contingent upon the <b>flow</b> <b>line</b> context, particularly the rules of governing the way work moves between employees (work flow policy). We show how subtle changes in this policy can have a motivational effect on heterogeneity and variability and how these, in turn, and impact the relationship between work flow policy and <b>flow</b> <b>line</b> performance...|$|R

This paper discusses using Mathematica, a mathematical programming language, for randomly generating the specifications for manufacturing <b>flow</b> <b>line</b> models. Important issues include determining an arrival rate to a <b>flow</b> <b>line,</b> the number of <b>flow</b> <b>line</b> stations, the number of parallel servers for each production station, and specifying the service time distributions and their associated parameters.

The effect of an anisotropic ice fabric on ice flow is incorporated into the steady state <b>flow</b> <b>line</b> model. The stress-strain rate relationship for anisotropic ice is characterized by an enhancement factor based on the laboratory observations of ice deformation under combined compression and shear stresses. By using present-day data of accumulation rate, surface temperature, surface elevation and ice thickness along the <b>flow</b> <b>line</b> as model inputs, a very close agreement is found between the isochrones generated from the model and the observed internal layers with confirmed dates. The results indicate that this part of Greenland ice sheet is primarily in steady state...|$|R

[...] The specimens, collected in November 1994 from the area of East Brunswick, New Jersey, by G.R. Case, P.D. Borodin, and J.J.

The specimen was found above the South Amboy Fire Clay, part of the Raritan Formation, suggesting that it is Turonian in age (Upper Cretaceous, about 90 to 94 million years ago).

2500|$|Floer {{homology}} {{is typically}} defined by associating {{to the object}} of interest an infinite-dimensional manifold and a real valued function on it.

For the (instanton) version for three-manifolds, it is the space of SU(2)-connections on a three-dimensional manifold with the Chern–Simons functional. [...] Loosely speaking, Floer homology is the Morse homology of the function on the infinite-dimensional manifold. [...] A Floer chain complex is formed from the abelian group spanned by the critical points of the function (or possibly certain collections of critical points).

The planchet is therefore struck at room temperature, {{and the only thing}} which makes the coin form is the tremendous pressure used to strike it. With a metal such as nickel, which is harder than a normal coin metal like silver, gold or copper, the pressure must be greater. When a nickel coin, or any coin, is struck, the metal must [...] "flow" [...] into the contours of the front and back dies. It is through the atoms of the metal flowing into the dies that <b>flow</b> <b>lines</b> are created. However, when metal flows over a sharp corner in the die, like the edges of a mintmark or words, it tends to roll the detail out. It wears on the die, and a little detail is lost with every strike. Die Deterioration Doubling is most prevalent on the date and mintmark because these fine details are alone {{in the middle of the}} field, and the metal must flow into these without the help of other valleys nearby. When the metal rolls into the mintmark or date, it wears away the corner of the die, and after long enough will appear on the coin as Die Deterioration Doubling.|$|E

2500|$|The {{solution}} {{present in}} fracture-filled diamonds {{can usually be}} detected by a trained gemologist under the microscope: while each diamond gets a treatment that fits its unique shape, state and fracture status, there may be traces of surface-reaching bore holes and fractures associated with drilled diamonds, air bubbles and <b>flow</b> <b>lines</b> within the glass, which are features never seen in untreated diamond. More dramatic is the so-called [...] "flash effect", which refers to the bright flashes of color seen when a fracture-filled diamond is rotated; the color of these flashes ranges from an electric blue or purple to an orange or yellow, depending on lighting conditions (light field and dark field, respectively). The flashes are best seen with {{the field of view}} nearly parallel to the filled fracture's plane (although specific fractures in untreated diamonds may cause similar [...] "flash effect"). In strongly colored diamonds the flash effect may be missed if examination is less than thorough, as the stone's body color will conceal {{one or more of the}} flash colors. For example, in brown-tinted [...] "champagne" [...] diamonds, the orange-yellow flashes are concealed, leaving only the blue-purple flashes to be seen. One last but important feature of fracture-filled diamonds is the color of the solution itself: it is sometimes a yellowish to brownish, and along with being visible in transmitted light, it can affect the overall color of the diamond, making the diamond fall an entire color grade after fracture-filling. For this reason fracture-filling is normally only applied to stones whose size is large enough to justify the treatment: however, stones as small as 0.02 carats (4mg) have been fracture-filled.|$|E
