5|$|N.J. Higham {{argues that}} Bede {{designed}} <b>his</b> <b>work</b> <b>to</b> promote his reform agenda to Ceolwulf, the Northumbrian king. Bede painted a highly optimistic {{picture of the}} current situation in the Church, {{as opposed to the}} more pessimistic picture found in his private letters.|$|E

5|$|The {{success of}} Cleopatra notwithstanding, Etty {{remained}} {{a student at}} the RA and continued with a rigorous programme of study. Now in his mid 30s, he felt that for <b>his</b> <b>work</b> <b>to</b> progress beyond mere competence he needed a chance to study those European masters whose styles he most admired, despite his unpleasant experiences the last time he left England.|$|E
5|$|Blinded in {{both eyes}} {{as a result}} of an early {{childhood}} accident, Braille mastered his disability while still a boy. He excelled in his education and received scholarship to France's Royal Institute for Blind Youth. While still a student there, he began developing a system of tactile code that could allow blind people to read and write quickly and efficiently. Inspired by the military cryptography of Charles Barbier, Braille constructed a new method built specifically for the needs of the blind. He presented <b>his</b> <b>work</b> <b>to</b> his peers for the first time in 1824.|$|E
5|$|Garner {{has also}} criticised Cochrane's {{rejection}} of liberty rights for animals; others to challenge this include Hadley and the philosophers Andreas T. Schmidt, Valéry Giroux, and Jason Wyckoff. Cochrane has developed his account in subsequent work, tying <b>his</b> <b>work</b> <b>to</b> cosmopolitan theory in a 2013 paper and developing {{an account of}} labour rights for animals in a 2016 paper. As of 2016, Cochrane {{is working on a}} book on the topic of animal rights and global justice, covering questions of cross-border obligations to nonhuman animals and the idea of international politics taking the rights of all sentient beings seriously. The book is intended for 2017 or 2018 release.|$|E

5|$|Goldschmidt {{became the}} sixth U.S. Secretary of Transportation in 1979. His recess {{appointment}} by President Jimmy Carter came on July 27 of that year, {{as part of}} a midterm restructuring of the Carter administration's cabinet positions. The United States Senate confirmed his appointment on September 21, and he was sworn in on September 24. In this position, Goldschmidt was known for <b>his</b> <b>work</b> <b>to</b> revive the auto industry, and efforts to deregulate the airline, trucking and railroad industries.|$|E
5|$|Having graduated, McLachlan and Michael Chechik {{founded the}} {{production}} company Omni Film Productions in 1979, {{and began to}} work with Greenpeace, filming documentary footage {{on a range of}} subjects. McLachlan narrowly avoided trouble on several of these shoots, finding himself arrested for filming too close to an Exxon oil tanker and scarcely missing being assaulted by trophy hunters in British Columbia. McLachlan would later sell his stake in Omni, but remains proud of their documentary work. At the time, McLachlan was unsuccessful in joining an industry union, relegating <b>his</b> <b>work</b> <b>to</b> advertising and small-scale productions; his first union-backed project was on the revival of the television series Sea Hunt.|$|E
5|$|Hergé took up {{painting}} as a hobby, producing abstract art works which {{were influenced by}} the styles of Joan Miró and Serge Poliakoff. He showed <b>his</b> <b>work</b> <b>to</b> the art historian Léo Van Puyvelde, who was the chief conservator of the Musées des Beaux-Arts, who believed that they showed promise but that Hergé's real talent lay with cartoon drawing. Hergé abandoned painting shortly after, having produced 37 paintings in all.|$|E

5|$|In 2003, Webb left Caedmon's Call {{to pursue}} a solo career. Since his departure, he has {{released}} seven studio albums (including one instrumental), a live album, two compilation albums, two covers projects, two DVDs, and two EPs (with his then-wife, Sandra McCracken). While these have been less commercially successful than his work with Caedmon's Call, Webb has had more of a free hand to shape <b>his</b> <b>work</b> <b>to</b> his vision.|$|E
5|$|In an {{era when}} defencemen were {{expected}} to stay behind during the play, Stuart became known {{for his ability to}} score goals while playing a defensive role, and for his ability to remain calm during matches that often turned violent. He also became known for <b>his</b> <b>work</b> <b>to</b> reduce that violence and to increase the salaries of hockey players. His efforts were acknowledged when the Hockey Hall of Fame was created in 1945 and {{he became one of the}} first nine players to be inducted. He was joined there by his brother Bruce in 1961.|$|E
5|$|Kan'ami Kiyotsugu {{and his son}} Zeami Motokiyo brought Noh to what is {{essentially}} its present-day form during the Muromachi period (1336 to 1573). Kan'ami was a renowned actor with great versatility fulfilling roles from graceful women and 12-year-old boys to strong adult males. When Kan'ami first presented <b>his</b> <b>work</b> <b>to</b> 17-year-old Ashikaga Yoshimitsu, Zeami was a child actor in his play, around age 12. Yoshimitsu {{fell in love with}} Zeami and his position of favor at court caused Noh to be performed frequently for Yoshimitsu thereafter.|$|E

5|$|Keynesian {{economics}} were officially discarded by the British Government in 1979, but {{forces had}} begun to gather against Keynes's ideas over 30 years earlier. Friedrich Hayek had formed the Mont Pelerin Society in 1947, with the explicit intention of nurturing intellectual currents to one day displace Keynesianism and other similar influences. Its members included the Austrian School economist Ludwig von Mises along with the then young Milton Friedman. Initially the society had little impact on the wider world – according to Hayek {{it was as if}} Keynes had been raised to sainthood after his death and that people refused to allow <b>his</b> <b>work</b> <b>to</b> be questioned.|$|E
5|$|Prescott's main {{secondary}} {{source for}} the history was Leopold von Ranke's Fürste und Völker von Süd-Europa im sechzehnten und siebzehnten Jahrhundert, a comprehensive work which included a detailed history of the papacy. Prescott admired Ranke's empirical historical method, and considered <b>his</b> <b>work</b> <b>to</b> be {{the best of his}} predecessors on the subject. He had four copies of the relevant sections of the work reprinted in a large typeface so he could read it without assistance. He had made a broad plan of the work by February 1849. Prescott started writing the draft on July 26. At this time, Prescott was a creditor of John White Webster, the chemist and murderer, and he was subsequently involved in his trial.|$|E
5|$|Production of Anderson's {{adaptation}} of Thomas Pynchon's 2009 novel Inherent Vice began in May 2013 {{and ended in}} August of the same year. The film {{marked the first time}} that Pynchon allowed <b>his</b> <b>work</b> <b>to</b> be adapted for the screen and saw Anderson work with Phoenix for a second time. The supporting cast includes Owen Wilson, Reese Witherspoon, Jena Malone, Martin Short, Benicio Del Toro, Katherine Waterston, Josh Brolin, Peter McRobbie, Michael K. Williams and Eric Roberts. Following its year-end release in December 2014, the film received two nominations at the 87th Academy Awards: Anderson for Best Adapted Screenplay and Mark Bridges for Best Costume Design.|$|E

5|$|The Bellman Society (Bellmansällskapet), {{founded in}} Stockholm {{on the anniversary}} of Bellman's birth in 1919, fosters {{interest}} in Bellman and supports research into the man and <b>his</b> <b>work.</b> <b>To</b> these ends it organises concerts, lectures and excursions. It produces the series of Bellmanstudier, starting in 1924, so far running to 24 volumes, as well as facsimile prints of Bellman documents, essay collections, and 's Bellman porcelain. It has published recordings including Alla Fredmans Epistlar (All Fredman's Epistles) and Alla Fredmans Sånger (All Fredman's Songs). The Society's newsletter is called Hwad behagas?.|$|E
5|$|The {{consequences}} of the decree for composers were harsh. Shostakovich {{was among those who}} were dismissed from the Conservatory altogether. For Shostakovich, the loss of money was perhaps the largest blow. Others still in the Conservatory experienced an atmosphere that was thick with suspicion. No one wanted <b>his</b> <b>work</b> <b>to</b> be understood as formalist, so many resorted to accusing their colleagues of writing or performing anti-proletarian music.|$|E
5|$|The {{interval}} between the award and the accomplishment it recognises varies from discipline to discipline. The Literature Prize is typically awarded to recognise a cumulative lifetime {{body of work}} rather than a single achievement. The Peace Prize can also be awarded for a lifetime body of work. For example, 2008 laureate Martti Ahtisaari was awarded for <b>his</b> <b>work</b> <b>to</b> resolve international conflicts. However, {{they can also be}} awarded for specific recent events. For instance, Kofi Annan was awarded the 2001 Peace Prize just four years after becoming the Secretary-General of the United Nations. Similarly Yasser Arafat, Yitzhak Rabin, and Shimon Peres received the 1994 award, about a year after they successfully concluded the Oslo Accords.|$|E

He wanted <b>to</b> give all <b>his</b> <b>works</b> <b>to</b> the Russian Museum {{as a gift}} so as to start a Museum of Analytical Realism. He died of starvation on December 3, 1941 during the Nazi Siege of Leningrad.|$|R
