40|$|Based on {{a robust}} {{literature}} indicating that happy couples {{tend to think}} and behave more positively in their relationships than less happy couples do, most interventions designed to treat and prevent marital distress tend to encourage couples to engage in more-positive cognitive and behavioral processes and avoid more-negative ones. Consistent with the limited effectiveness of such inter-ventions, however, findings from four independent longitudinal studies of newlyweds indicate that positive processes may not only fail to help distressed couples, they may hurt them. Specifically, although more-positive expectations, more-positive attributions, less-negative behavior, and more forgiveness most effectively maintained satisfaction among spouses facing infrequent and minor problems, less-positive expectations, less-positive attributions, more-negative behavior, and less forgiveness most effectively main-tained satisfaction among spouses facing more-frequent and more-severe problems, partly because those processes <b>helped</b> <b>spouses</b> acknowledge, address, and resolve those problems.

This study carried out to determine the knowledge level and beliefs of couples attending marriage counseling centers toward correct sexual relationships. Methods &amp; Materials: This is a cross-sectional study. A total of 300 individuals (150 couples), attending marriage counseling centers in the north and east of Tehran recruited for the study using random selection method.

A six session intervention program, which included support, problem-solving and coping skills, was designed to <b>help</b> <b>spouses</b> {{to cope with the}} stress of caring for their partner. Forty male and forty female spouses of cancer patients of a regional oncology center were randomly assigned to intervention or usual treatment conditions. Spouses and patients were interviewed prior to intervention, and within two weeks after intervention on a battery of assessment instruments including: (1) demographic variables; (2) psychological variables; (3) health status; (4) social supports; (5) assessment of pressing problems; (6) coping skills; (7) burden levels; and (8) marital satisfaction. Participants were found to be more psychologically distressed than the general population but were not as distressed as psychiatric outpatients. Differences were also found in marital satisfaction and coping activities, when compared to the general population. No significant differences between the conditions were found on any of the measures. Caregivers' level of caregiving activities proved to be low.

40|$|Christian couples today attest {{that their}} marital lives {{enable them to}} answer their call to holiness and also to {{participate}} in Christ’s redemptive work {{by means of the}} services expected of them as husbands and wives in their families, society and church. This experience can thus be referred to as spirituality, in that the sense of calling is linked to an awareness of someone or something greater than oneself. Thus, to speak of marital spirituality is to speak of a couple’s awareness of their marital life within the context of transcendence. Conjugal spirituality does not just happen; it has to be nurtured by moral virtues such as honesty, trust, forgiveness, respect, and friendship. It also requires disciplines like availability and communication between <b>spouses.</b> Conjugal spirituality <b>helps</b> <b>spouses</b> to go beyond themselves, to survive inevitable tests, obstacles, and challenges in their marital union and to move from inauthentic to authentic life, finding meaning and satisfaction beyond what each of the partners is able to contribute. Furthermore, successful marriage is future-oriented; any marriage not motivated towards the future may be stuck in the present or ruled by past events. As experience shows, when couples no longer find meaning in their relationship beyond sexual life, emotional intimacy, and personal fulfillment, such relationships often turn sour or even end up in divorce. This article proposes the hope of seeing God as the quintessential and animating factor of the marital union. The author argues that with God as its foundation and goal, a marital relationship will find a living, inspiring, enriching and inexhaustible source to keep the spouses together. status: publishe...|$|R
40|$|The aim of {{this study}} was to explore the {{experiences}} of the spouses of South African diplomats on a posting in a foreign country. The study focused on the factors that enabled or hindered effective adjustment during posting. Research conducted showed that one of the greatest challenges facing international assignments is that organisations do not only deal with an employee but the whole family, their needs and expectations in the relocation process. The adjustment constraints in this study referred to pre-departure preparation, support provided by the Department, religion and cultural differences or similarities, foreign language, environmental factors and personal health. A qualitative research approach was applied. Data was collected through a semi-structured interview schedule. The study was conducted among nine (9) spouses who returned from posting between 2009 and 2011. Some of the spouses completed the posting whilst others returned prematurely due to adjustment problems. The findings indicated inconsistencies on how the Department prepares and supports spouses before and during posting; and that cultural and religious differences, foreign language competence and environmental factors have a considerable impact on the adjustment of spouses in a foreign country. Social support network, particularly the Embassy staff and diplomatic spouses’ associations play a crucial role in <b>helping</b> <b>spouses</b> to adjust. The study also found that spouses’ inability to adjust can result in early termination of posting. The recommendations are that the Department should review the training curriculum and provide support to spouses during the posting. The study will benefit the department, the diplomats and spouses in future postings. Dissertation (MSW) [...] University of Pretoria, 2015. tm 2015 Social Work and CriminologyMSWUnrestricte...|$|R

As undergraduate students involved in the workshop we have uncovered that equipping couples with tools to strengthen their marriage is the best superpower you can give to a family. The Marriage Enrichment Workshop (MEW) is a capstone of the FHCD 5540 : Family Life Education Methods class teaches students how to design a workshop through hands-on facilitation of a workshop offered to rural couples. The materials for the class and workshop are based on the highly effective methods of Dr. John Gottman’s The Seven Principles for Making Marriage Work, Dr. Willard Harley’s His Needs, Her Needs, Lane H. Powell’s Family Life Education: Working with Families across the Life Span, and Love, Limits, and Latitude: A Thousand Small Moments of Parenting by M. Gawain Wells, David Law, and Jennifer E.

The last six weeks of the course is the workshop. The workshop is designed to increase marital satisfaction by <b>helping</b> <b>spouses</b> learn to meet each other’s needs and practice effective communication.

We define resilience as ‘the process of negotiating, managing and adapting to significant sources of stress or trauma’. We aimed to assess whether spousal dementia carers can achieve resilience and to highlight which assets and resources they draw on to facilitate or hinder resilience, using an ecological framework. Method:Twenty in-depth qualitative interviews with spousal carers from two carer support groups and a care home in North West England. Results: Eight participants were resilient and 12 were not. A resilient carer was characterised as someone who stays positive and actively maintained their relationship and loved one’s former self. Resilient carers were knowledgeable and well supported by family but especially friends, with whom they shared this knowledge. They were more actively engaged with services such as respite care. Conclusion: There is a need to move towards more ecological models of resilience. We propose that access to assets and resources is not always sufficient to facilitate resilience.

40|$|PURPOSE: To manage {{social roles}} is a {{challenging}} part of self-management post-stroke. This study explored how stroke survivors act as role managers with their spouses {{in the context}} of everyday activities. METHOD: Two stroke survivors with a first time stroke living at home with a spouse were included. Data were generated through participant observations at their own environment at 3, 6, 9, 15 and 21 months post-discharge. The narrative analysis focused on the actions of participants. RESULTS: Daily activities can be understood as an arena where role management and a meaningful live is negotiated and co-constructed with others. Everyday activities gave stroke survivors and their spouses insight into stroke survivors' capacities in daily situations. This was sometimes empowering, and other times conflicting when a spouse had negative perceptions of the abilities of the stroke survivors.
