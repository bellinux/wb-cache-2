Hence, in order to calculate the expected variance for the learning model, where the underlying assumption is that ex ante job quality is not observable, we need to infer the true <b>job</b> <b>offer</b> distribution (i.e. including those offers which were worse than the offer that was accepted) that underlies the observed accepted <b>job</b> <b>offer</b> distribution among labor market entrants. This can easily be done using an optimization program (e.g. in MATLAB) that simulates the true <b>job</b> <b>offer</b> distribution and the true number of <b>job</b> <b>offers</b> that people receive in a certain period such that the combination of both - given the assumption that people can pick the best available offer - would lead to a simulated accepted <b>job</b> <b>offer</b> distribution, which best approximates the observed accepted <b>job</b> <b>offer</b> distribution in Figure  220. As can be seen in Figure  2 the simulated accepted <b>job</b> <b>offer</b> distribution, which has a mean of 4.67 and a standard deviation of 2.37, makes a rather good fit to the observed distribution of accepted <b>job</b> <b>offers.</b> This is based on the simulated number of offers each person receives in a period being equal to two. Now, the simulated true <b>job</b> <b>offer</b> distribution is used to calculate the expected variance following the learning model, which is presented in Figure  3. Since the stepping stone model and the learning model represent both ends of a continuum, it is not surprising to find the actual variance in Figure  3 to be in between both extreme variance predictions.|$|R
30|$|The ‘student-ness’ of <b>job</b> <b>offers</b> declines {{with rising}} minimum {{educational}} requirements {{attached to a}} given <b>job</b> <b>offer</b> and rises with maximum educational requirements, and this effect is similar for flexible jobs.

Relative to the requirement of no skills, the probability of a flexible offer declines significantly and substantively if any type of skill is required. On the other hand, we find no effect of administrative and language skills in predicting student <b>job</b> <b>offers,</b> while the requirement of computer skills increases the odds by 3 pp.|$|R

30|$|Ideally, all {{the real}} estate agent <b>job</b> <b>offers</b> posted in the Paris area should have the same {{probability}} of being tested. However, this requirement is physically impossible to meet. In this study, we focus only on <b>job</b> <b>offers</b> available in the website of Pole Emploi 16. This website centralizes most of the <b>job</b> <b>offers</b> for real estate agents. By taking this step, we introduce a possible bias into our results. Indeed, we cannot be sure that recruiters using the Pole Emploi website behave {{in the same way as}} recruiters prospecting on others channels for job search 17. More broadly, our results are biased in view of the fact that we test only one channel for job search. From this perspective, our study probably tends to underestimate hiring discrimination. However, the Pole Emploi website is still one of the most frequently used websites for job search, and it has the advantage of providing <b>job</b> <b>offers</b> with very detailed characteristics (wage offered, work experience required, etc.), which is not the case with others websites 18. Thus, we privileged the testing of <b>job</b> <b>offers</b> whose characteristics are identified (in particular the work experience requirement) rather than testing <b>job</b> <b>offers</b> whose characteristics are unknown and for which we are not sure that at least one of our applicants has the opportunity of being called back.|$|R

30|$|Because we are {{addressing}} <b>job</b> <b>offer</b> {{acceptance in}} an interregional mobility context, {{it is not}} surprising to discover a substantial number of individuals who display no inclination to accept certain <b>job</b> <b>offers.</b> In our study, we found that 40.5  % of responses to the 11 -point scale of <b>job</b> <b>offer</b> acceptance were zero, which indicated an absolute unwillingness to accept the respective <b>job</b> <b>offer.</b> <b>Job</b> <b>offer</b> acceptance {{is the result of a}} principal decision to participate in the labour market and a (separate) decision regarding how many hours to work (see, e.g., Borjas 2010 or Franz 2009 :  22). In our study, the participation choice is often linked to the necessity of relocation. Migration research literature has long recognised migration as a multistage process (see Kalter 1997 : 66; Rossi 1980 :  149  et seq.), from the formulation of a mobility desire to concrete mobility intentions to the actual relocation. This multistage nature implies that there may be factors situated on the level of the respondent such as property ownership or school-age children that cause individuals to refuse any migration, independently of the traits of the <b>jobs</b> on <b>offer.</b> Our sample includes not only unemployed persons and individuals who are currently searching for jobs but also employed persons who are content with their current jobs. Therefore, we examine the mobility decision of respondents with different frames of reference.

40|$|For decades researchers, analysts, and {{organizational}} professionals have utilized correction equations {{to adjust for}} the effects of various statistical artifacts. However, every correction method has certain assumptions that must be satisfied to work properly. These assumptions are likely rarely satisfied for range restriction corrections. As a result, these correction methods are used in a manner that can lead to incorrect results. The current study employed a Monte Carlo design to examine the direct range restriction correction. Analyses were conducted to examine the accuracy of adjustments made with the direct range restriction correction when its assumption of perfect top-down selection was violated to varying degrees. Analyses were conducted on two datasets, each representing a population of 1, 000, 000 cases. The following variables were manipulated: the population correlation, the selection ratio, and the probability that the hypothetical applicant would accept the <b>job</b> if <b>offered.</b> Results of the accuracy of the direct range restriction correction equation for the optimal (all <b>job</b> <b>offers</b> accepted) versus realistic (<b>job</b> <b>offers</b> refused at various rates) conditions demonstrated small differences in bias for all conditions. In addition, small differences in squared bias were observed for most of these conditions, with the exception of conditions with both low selection ratios and low probabilities of <b>job</b> <b>offer</b> acceptance. In a surprising finding, the direct range restriction correction equation exhibited greater accuracy for realistic <b>job</b> <b>offer</b> acceptance (some <b>job</b> <b>offers</b> refused) than for optimal <b>job</b> <b>offer</b> acceptance (all offers accepted).

30|$|The aim of {{this study}} is to {{evaluate}} if unemployed and employed individuals differ in their willingness to accept <b>job</b> <b>offers.</b> Standard economic theory in general and search and matching theories in particular expect that unemployed individuals can increase their chances of finding employment quicker by a higher willingness to relocate for a new job. However, strong regional differences in both unemployment rates and vacancies at the same time point to a fundamental problem in the labour market, namely matching individuals to jobs. This motivates our research, because up to now it is still not clear, whether this matching problem is the result of a lack of access to vacancies or of lacking willingness to accept (interregional) <b>job</b> <b>offers</b> on the side of unemployed individuals. On the one hand, <b>job</b> <b>offers</b> might be declined because of high mobility costs or a low willingness to work on the part of the unemployed (supply-side factors). On the other hand, unemployed individuals might be denied attractive <b>job</b> <b>offers</b> (the demand-side explanation) and therefore display comparatively low levels of mobility despite their general willingness to accept interregional <b>job</b> <b>offers.</b>|$|R

30|$|In this study, {{we take a}} {{step forward}} in {{investigating}} these questions by analysing the willingness to accept <b>job</b> <b>offers</b> in circumstance in which all individuals {{have access to the}} same <b>job</b> <b>offers.</b> Our approach is based on an experimental factorial survey module (FSM) that was incorporated into the Panel Study Labour Market and Social Security (PASS), a large-scale population survey with an over-representation of unemployed persons that is annually conducted by the German Institute for Employment Research (IAB) (see Trappmann et al. 2010 for an overview). Approximately 4, 200 employed or unemployed respondents available to the labour market evaluated their willingness to accept hypothetical <b>job</b> <b>offers</b> (vignettes) that differed in experimentally varied characteristics, such as expected income, working hours, and regional distance from the respondent’s home. Analyses of these evaluations make it possible to identify the dimensions that affect the willingness to accept <b>job</b> <b>offers</b> or to relocate. 1 Moreover, {{as a result of the}} experimental design, all of the respondents received <b>job</b> <b>offers</b> of the same quality, on average. Important demand-side characteristics are thereby standardised—in contrast to the real labour market. Thus, it is possible to focus solely on labour supply-side effects in the analysis. The PASS survey provides a sufficient number of cases for a comparison of unemployed and employed persons. These data facilitate an investigation of the dynamics of the decision-making process regarding <b>job</b> <b>offers</b> and testing of the assumptions derived from labour market and migration theories.|$|R
