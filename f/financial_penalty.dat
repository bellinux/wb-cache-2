5|$|In {{the first}} month of the 2011–12 season, Hansen was hit from behind by defenceman Shea Weber in a game against the Nashville Predators on 20 October 2011. While he was uninjured on the play, Weber was fined $2,500 — the maximum {{allowable}} <b>financial</b> <b>penalty</b> — by the League the following day. The following month, Hansen earned a brief stint playing on the Canucks' first line with Daniel and Henrik Sedin, replacing Alexandre Burrows. Enjoying a career season, he surpassed his previous personal best of nine goals in the NHL by December 2011. He continued to play the majority of the campaign on the Canucks' checking line and finished with 16 goals and 39 points over 82 games. Although Vancouver won their second consecutive Presidents' Trophy in 2011–12, they lost {{in the first round of}} the playoffs to the Los Angeles Kings.

25|$|Márquez {{moved up}} to the welterweight {{division}} and fought undefeated pound for pound champion Floyd Mayweather Jr.. The fight was scheduled to take place at 144-pound catch weight on July 18, 2009 at the MGM Grand Garden Arena; but was postponed due to a rib injury sustained by Mayweather. The bout was rescheduled and held on September 19, 2009. During the official weigh in, Márquez weighed in at 142lbs and Mayweather weighed in at 146lbs, thereby incurring a <b>financial</b> <b>penalty</b> as he was 2 pounds over the catchweight. It was later discovered that both parties had agreed just before the weigh-in to allow Mayweather fight over the catchweight with Mayweather paying additional $600,000 due to arriving two pounds over the 144lbs weight limit. Mayweather controlled the action in the fight. Márquez struggled to conquer Mayweather's defense and could {{not get out of}} the way of his counter punches. Márquez landed only 19% of his punches according to Compubox punch stats. Mayweather knocked Márquez down in the 2nd round. Mayweather won the fight by unanimous decision.|$|E

Following the May 2012 legislative elections, women constitute 31.6% of Algerian MPs. In Senegal, 50% of local and national electoral lists have to be female as of 2012. Kosovo has had a female quota for its assembly as far back as 2001, when it was de jure part of the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia; the Muslim-majority (95.6%) Balkan republic guarantees women 30% of parliamentary seats as of 2016.|$|E

40|$|In its {{recently}} completed review of Commonwealth fisheries policy the Australian Government, following submissions from the commercial fishing industry, agreed {{to examine the}} implications of replacing the power in the Fisheries Management Act 1991 (FM Act) to cancel fishing concessions for non-compliance with management measures that increased <b>financial</b> <b>penalties.</b> Industry argued that the cancellation provisions undermine the security of access rights and the Australian Government had accepted that the current provisions may be an impediment to investment in Commonwealth-managed fisheries. This paper reviews these concerns in light of property rights and compliance issues and concludes {{that there are no}} compelling reasons for removing cancellation provisions from the FM Act. On the contrary, these provisions provide a powerful deterrent to non-compliance, which is unlikely to be matched by <b>financial</b> <b>penalties</b> alone. Nevertheless, it is suggested that a review of the way fisheries offences are dealt with under the Act is undertaken and that the level of current <b>financial</b> <b>penalties</b> be reviewed.

500|$|During May's Giro d'Italia, Sylvain Georges tested {{positive}} for the vasodilator heptaminol, after the seventh stage; his positive test was the second by a rider from the [...] squad {{in the space of a}} year, after Steve Houanard {{tested positive}} for the glycoprotein hormone erythropoietin (EPO) in an out-of-competition test in September 2012. Since the team was a member of the Mouvement pour un cyclisme crédible union, a second positive test meant that, according to the union's regulations, they had to stop racing for eight days. The team voluntarily withdrew from the Dauphiné, avoiding a <b>financial</b> <b>penalty</b> which could have been incurred by the team for failing to compete in a World Tour event, against UCI regulations. As a result, the peloton was reduced to the following twenty-two teams.|$|E
500|$|Before inauguration, GMPTE's {{original}} {{concept was}} for Metrolink's operator {{to provide a}} service every ten minutes from Bury-to-Piccadilly and Altrincham-to-Piccadilly , Monday to Saturday. Greater Manchester Metro Limited, the system's original operator, argued for adjustments, citing {{the need to provide}} an efficient and commercially viable operation in line with vehicle running times and passenger demand. Due to power limitations, this pattern was modified to a twelve-minute service throughout the day, doubling to a six-minute service in peak periods, resulting in a [...] "ten trams per hour" [...] service pattern on routes running from Altrincham and Bury to Manchester every six minutes. Operators are required to provide this level of service at least 98% of the time, or incur a <b>financial</b> <b>penalty</b> charge. This six-minute service pattern has been adopted {{on the rest of the}} network as the system has grown. Heavy snowfall during the winter of 2009/10 impaired Metrolink services and the operator was criticised for failing to have cold weather procedures. This prompted a programme to improve reliability and performance of the system in freezing conditions. Metrolink operated icebreaker-style vehicles at night during snowfall in January 2013 to provide normal services.|$|E

Ratzinger returned to the Gymnasium in Traunstein. During this period in the seminary, following his 14th birthday in 1941, Ratzinger was enrolled in the Hitler Youth, as membership was legally required in effect beginning 25 March 1939. Following the seminary closure he continued required attendance with the Hitler Youth to avoid financial penalties in the Gymnasium tuition fees. The <b>financial</b> <b>penalty</b> (which theoretically required documentation of attendance at Hitler Youth activities) was overlooked when a sympathetic mathematics professor allowed him not to attend any meetings.

40|$|The Government {{relies on}} tax revenue {{as a major}} source of {{development}} funds so that taxpayers are expected to have a high tax compliance. However, the reality reveals that most of taxpayers have no compliance. It is indicated by paying taxes late and try to do the tax evasion. This study aims to test empirically and analyze the effect of tax consciousness, rational attitude, environment, <b>financial</b> <b>penalties,</b> and tax authorities attitude towards tax compliance. The hypothesis proposed tax consciousness, rational attitude, environment, <b>financial</b> <b>penalties,</b> and tax authorities have a positive influence towards tax compliance. The research was conducted by survey method to individual tax payers in the city, which is obtained in incidental sampling. Data collection method used questionnaires, and further data were analyzed using multiple regression analysis. The results of this study prove that the tax consciousness, rational attitude, environment, <b>financial</b> <b>penalties,</b> and the attitude of tax authorities have a positive and significant impact on tax compliance, both partial and simultaneous. Variable tax authorities attitude provides the greatest influence on tax compliance because it has a beta value of 0, 284 while the tax consciousness variable provides the smallest influence of the tax compliance because it has a beta value of 0. 162. The tax consciousness, rational attitude, environment, <b>financial</b> <b>penalties</b> and the attitude of tax authorities variables can be used to describe the tax compliance of 57. 2...|$|R
