40|$|Coccidiosis {{continues}} to be a great challenge to the poultry industry {{all over the world and}} in broiler breeders vaccination with live oocysts of Eimeria has been widely adopted as a control measure. Broiler breeders are usually subjected to feed restriction during their early growth however no studies have been undertaken on the effects of vaccination in birds whose feed has been restricted in this manner. The objective of this study was to assess the level of protection acquired by broiler breeder chickens when immunized at day-old with live eimerian oocysts and given a restricted diet. Effects upon growth and development were measured. In the first experiment, 220 vaccinated and unvaccinated broiler breeder chickens were raised in separate pens on new litter. At 4 weeks of age, and every week thereafter until 8 weeks of age, 40 of the vaccinated and unvaccinated birds were assigned to 4 treatment groups in cages and challenged with 100, 000 oocysts of Eimeria tenella. The 4 groups were 1) vaccinated and challenged (VC), 2) unvaccinated and challenged (UC), 3) vaccinated and unchallenged (VU), and 4) unvaccinated and unchallenged (UU). The level of protection acquired was assessed by the presence of lesions in the ceca and <b>dropping</b> <b>pan</b> scores 6 days after challenge. In the second experiment one group of birds was infected orally with 500 oocysts each of E. acervulina, E. maxima and E. tenella at day old and a second group was kept as uninfected controls. Doses were intended to simulate those provided in commercial coccidiosis vaccines. Body weight, chest girth, shank length, and keel length were used as criteria to judge the effect of infection on growth and development. In the first experiment, lesions and <b>dropping</b> <b>pan</b> scores were significantly reduced in the VC (P 3 ̆c 0. 05) birds compared to UC birds at 4, 5, 6, 7, and 8 weeks of age indicating that birds have developed sufficient immunity to protect them from the pathology caused by E. tenella. In the second experiment, infected birds showed significantly reduced (P 3 ̆c 0. 05) body weights and chest girths compared to the control birds. This indicates that infection affects body growth and development of these birds. Results were inconclusive with shank length and keel length measurements...|$|R

Non-invasive examination of the vessels revealed severe arterial disease with considerable lowering of the ankle-brachial blood pressure index, the arterial pressure in the A. peronea and low partial pressure of oxygen in the forefoot. The patency of both the A. poplitea and the outflow to the A. peronea and the A. tibialis posterior was restored by means of percutaneous subintimal angioplasty, and the wound healed rapidly after this. Critical ischemia of the lower extremity in elderly patients is often a difficult problem, especially in combination with a non-healing arterial ulcer. Surgical options are often absent or undesirable due to extensive pathology or vascular comorbidity. The main advantages ofpercutaneous treatment are local anaesthesia, short hospitalization and low risk. Short hospitalization is often a major advantage in the elderly. Although {{we know that the}} long-term patency after bypass surgery is better than after a percutaneous treatment, the clinical outcome is not different. Broader application of percutaneous subintimal vascular treatment can prevent risky vascular reconstruction operations and amputations in this patient group.

40|$|International audienceActions {{that produce}} sounds infuse our daily lives. Some of these sounds are a natural {{consequence}} of physical interactions (such as a clang resulting from <b>dropping</b> a <b>pan),</b> {{but others are}} artificially designed (such as a beep resulting from a keypress). Although the relationship between actions and sounds has previously been examined, the frame of reference of these associations is still unknown, despite it being a fundamental property of a psychological representation. For example, when an association is created between a keypress and a tone, {{it is unclear whether}} the frame of reference is egocentric (gesture-sound association) or exocentric (key-sound association). This question is especially important for artificially created associations, which occur in technology that pairs sounds with actions, such as gestural interfaces, virtual or augmented reality, and simple buttons that produce tones. The frame of reference could directly influence the learnability, the ease of use, the extent of immersion, and many other factors of the interaction. To explore whether action-sound associations are egocentric or exocentric, an experiment was implemented using a computer keyboard's number pad wherein moving a finger from one key to another produced a sound, thus creating an action-sound association. Half of the participants received egocentric instructions to move their finger with a particular gesture. The other half of the participants received exocentric instructions to move their finger to a particular number on the keypad. All participants were performing the same actions, and only the framing of the action varied between conditions by altering task instructions. Participants in the egocentric condition learned the gesture-sound association, as revealed by a priming paradigm. However, the exocentric condition showed no priming effects. This finding suggests that action-sound associations are egocentric in nature. A second part of the same session further confirmed the egocentric nature of these associations by showing no change in the priming effect after moving to a different starting location. Our findings are consistent with an egocentric representation of action-sound associations, which could have implications for applications that utilize these associations...|$|R

40|$|We {{describe}} an electrospray technique for in situ preparation, for {{differential scanning calorimetry}} study, of samples of molecular liquids quenched into the glassy state on extremely short time scales (hyperquenched). We study the case of propylene glycol PG in some detail. Using a fictive temperature method of obtaining the temperature dependence of enthalpy relaxation, we show that the electrospray method yields quenching rates of ~ 105 K/s, while the more common method, <b>dropping</b> a sealed <b>pan</b> of sample into liquid nitrogen, yields only 120 K/s. Hyperquenched samples start to relax exothermically far below the glass temperature, at a temperature where the thermal energy permits escape from the shallow traps in which the system becomes localized during hyperquenching. This permits estimation of the trap depths, which are then compared with the activation energy estimated from the fictive temperature of the glass and the relaxation time at the fictive temperature. The trap depth in molar energy units is compared with the "height of the landscape" for PG, the quasi-lattice energy of the liquid based on the enthalpy of vaporization, and the single molecule activation energy for diffusion in hydrogen bonded crystals. The implications for the topography of the energy landscape and the mechanism of its exploration, are considered. Comment: 19 pages, 6 figure...|$|R

Her actions also bring Mother Superior, whose shadow was taken by Pan's Shadow, back to life. She restores Tinker Bell as a real fairy and gives them the Black Fairy's wand.|$|R
5000|$|When a pin rolls back, {{the smaller}} {{diameter}} of the pin allows it to fall rearwards through the ball return wheel. As the pins are still moving from the shaking by the board, a pin will bounce around until it lands in a pocket in the pinwheel. It may be seated in the pinwheel head-first or base-first. The wheel brings the pin {{to the top and}} drops it into a metal tray, called a [...] "turnaround pan", similar to what exists on the rear end of the AMF 82-30 unit's pin distributor arm. It's shaped somewhat like a scoop, with the lip of the scoop facing the bowler. The weight of the pin's body makes it <b>drop</b> into the <b>pan</b> base-first, so that the pin's base is facing the bowler. From there a conveyor belt lifts the pin up, letting it slide into one of ten spots - nine around the periphery in groups of three spots each, and one in the center for the number-5 pin - in a rotating metal basket called the [...] "turret" [...] (located just above the deck) with only the deck itself, protected with the attached sheet metal [...] "deck shield", visible to the bowler as it descends to handle the pins. When a pin lands in an empty location in the turret, the turret rotates (or [...] "indexes") so that the next pin will land in the next empty location, with the 5-pin chute {{in the center of the}} turret being filled last. Once the turret is full, and the empty deck reaches the top of its travel, all ten pins are simultaneously dropped from the turret into the spotting chutes of the table, which lowers them onto the lane to set the new rack of pins on the pin deck.|$|R
