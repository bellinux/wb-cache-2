After its UK appearance, the P-1s proceeded to the Japan Self-Defense Force Base Djibouti at Ambouli International Airport, Djibouti, to continue with operational trials within tropical and desert climates.|$|E
25|$|A third update was {{published}} on 10 March 2016. This Special Bulletin covered the organisation of the airshow at Shoreham, and airshows in the United Kingdom in general, with {{particular attention to}} risk management. Comparison was made with how airshows are organised in Australia, Canada and the United States. British civil and military rules were examined separately. It was reported that at the 2014 Shoreham Airshow, G-BXFI had overflown Lancing with a bank angle in excess of 90Â°. The pilot had not been instructed to stop his display. The AAIB did not name the pilot of G-BXFI who flew the 2014 display. It was also reported that the <b>Flying</b> <b>Display</b> Director at both displays did not have prior knowledge of the display intended to be flown. The issue of low flying during air displays was investigated. A previous accident involving glider BGA 4665 at an air race in Leicestershire in August 2005 had resulted in a recommendation to the CAA to change a rule. This had not been done and new rules subsequently introduced {{had the effect of}} leaving that rule unchanged, despite the CAA agreeing with the recommendation to change it. It was noted that the police had no powers to prevent people from watching an airshow from outside the boundaries of the venue where it was taking place. In the case of Shoreham, neither Sussex Constabulary nor the organisers had asked for such powers. Signs had been put out stating that viewing was prohibited and that offenders may be prosecuted. Another issue considered was how often CAA Flight Standards Officers attended airshows: only 1.4% of airshows in 2014 and 7.1% of airshows in 2015 had been attended. Fourteen recommendations were made. In January 2017, the CAA stated that it accepted all the recommendations made by the AAIB.|$|E

2500|$|The {{first public}} <b>flying</b> <b>display</b> at Brooklands, already {{established}} as a motor-racing circuit, was made {{at the end of}} October 1909 by Louis Paulhan: around 2,000 spectators watched him fly to a height of 720 feet. [...] Brooklands soon became one of Britain's major centres of aviation activity, with several flying schools. [...] In 1910 Louis Paulhan and Claude Grahame-White competed to win the Daily Mail prize for a flight between London and Manchester, attracting [...] Major long-distance aeroplane races, such as the Circuit of Europe and the Aerial Derby began in 1911 and also attracted enormous crowds.|$|E
2500|$|Sussex Police {{opened a}} {{separate}} {{investigation into the}} accident. [...] The pilot was released from hospital in early September 2015. He was interviewed by police in December. In February 2016, {{it was announced that}} the police investigation was being extended to cover an incident at an airshow in Southport, Merseyside, in August 2014. That incident involved a BAC Jet Provost aircraft which had descended too low and got too close to the crowd line whilst being displayed by Hill. He was ordered to cease flying the display by the airshow's <b>Flying</b> <b>Display</b> Director. A CAA Flight Standards Officer did not attend that airshow.|$|E
2500|$|Brooklands {{was also}} one of Britain's first airfields. In 1908 Alliott Verdon-Roe was based at Brooklands and carried out the first taxiing and towed flight trials of a British {{full-size}} powered aircraft by a British pilot. On Friday, 29 October 1909 the first official powered flight at Brooklands was made by Frenchman Louis Paulhan and his Farman biplane: this special event attracted 20,000 people and was the first public <b>flying</b> <b>display</b> at Brooklands. Operating from specially prepared land inside the Race Track and given his own aeroplane shed, Paulhan made a series of flights on the following days, flying to a height of some [...] on the Saturday and setting a new British endurance record of 2hr 49min 20s on the Monday.|$|E
