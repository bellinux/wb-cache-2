50|$|The {{autoignition}} temperature or <b>kindling</b> <b>point</b> of a substance {{is the lowest}} temperature at which it spontaneously ignites in normal atmosphere without an external source of ignition, such as a flame or spark. This temperature is required to supply the activation energy needed for combustion. The temperature at which a chemical ignites decreases as the pressure or oxygen concentration increases. It is usually applied to a combustible fuel mixture.|$|E
5000|$|Cooking off is a {{characteristic}} of certain air-cooled machine guns firing from a closed bolt. In such a design, when the trigger is released the weapon feed leaves a final round in the chamber. Residual heat conducts through the cartridge case. If the <b>kindling</b> <b>point</b> of the propellant is eventually reached it will burn even though the primer has not been struck, thus firing the chambered round. Contrary to popular myth, this will not cause the machine gun to [...] "runaway" [...] at cyclic rate of fire (as compared to a slamfire) because each chambered round has to first be brought up to temperature. The time this takes depends on {{the temperature of the}} chamber and of the environment, but is usually several seconds, although if caused deliberately may be very fast. During this time the barrel is cooling.|$|E

6000|$|The shout was hushed on {{lake and}} fell, [...] The Monk resumed his muttered spell: [...] Dismal and low its accents came, [...] The while he scathed the Cross with flame; [...] And the few words that reached the air, [...] Although the holiest name was there, [...] Had more of blasphemy than prayer. [...] But when he shook above the crowd [...] Its <b>kindled</b> <b>points,</b> he spoke aloud:-- [...] 'Woe to the wretch who fails to rear [...] At this dread sign the ready spear! [...] For, as the flames this symbol sear, [...] His home, the refuge of his fear, [...] A kindred fate shall know; [...] Far o'er its roof the volumed flame [...] Clan-Alpine's vengeance shall proclaim, [...] While maids and matrons on his name [...] Shall call down wretchedness and shame, [...] And infamy and woe.' [...] Then rose {{the cry of}} females, shrill [...] As goshawk's whistle on the hill, [...] Denouncing misery and ill, [...] Mingled with childhood's {{babbling}} trill [...] Of curses stammered slow; [...] Answering with imprecation dread, [...] 'Sunk be his home in embers red! [...] And cursed be the meanest shed [...] That o'er shall hide the houseless head [...] We doom to want and woe!' [...] A sharp and shrieking echo gave, [...] Coir-Uriskin, thy goblin cave! [...] And the gray pass where birches wave [...] On Beala-nam-bo.|$|R

50|$|In 1993 Frilot and Karim Ainouz {{were the}} co-directors, and {{introduced}} many changes, including the name MIX, {{the production of}} a catalog (instead of handing our program notes), a new venue (The Kitchen instead of Anthology Film Archives) and a commitment to multicultural presentations and installation work. A stunning program that year was called The 1000 Dreams of Desire, curated by Jim Lyons. It was a special show featuring Teri Rice's The <b>Kindling</b> <b>Point</b> and Les Affaires, at the Ann Street Bookstore in Lower Manhattan, where the peep booths were reprogrammed with experimental video, and 16mm film was projected in a separate room. MIX returned to Anthology in 1994, and combined with DCTV's Lookout Lesbian & Gay Video Festival because DCTV's building was under renovation. Ainouz scaled back his involvement, and Frilot became the definitive voice of MIX, making the organization a home for emerging filmmakers and makers of color. This was signaled by 1994's opening feature, Brincando El Charco, and even more powerfully when 1995's opening and closing events were films by makers of color These films, Vintage: Families of Value by Thomas Allen Harris, and Frilot's own documentary Black Nations/Queer Nations, brought new audiences to MIX. They started satellite festivals such as MIX Brasil (1993) and MIX Mexico (1996).|$|E
40|$|Abstract. Treated coal powder is {{prepared}} by dipping dyeing-printing wastewater into coal powder from DaTong, China. Effects {{of the amount}} of wastewater on heat value, combustion efficiency and activation energy of these samples were investigated. The results showed that the addition of dyeing-printing wastewater improved the combustion performances, which reached the best when the ratio of wastewater to sample was 4 %. That is, the heat value increased by 2. 3 % and <b>kindling</b> <b>point,</b> activation energy and CO content in the smoke decreased by 6 °C, 22. 2 % and 20 %, respectively. At the same time, the recycling of wastewater was also achieved. ...|$|E
40|$|AbstractIn {{order to}} {{research}} the spread of a fire {{and the distribution of}} temperature and gas in high-rise building fires, setting the CCTV North Building Fire as the background, the fire was simulated and analyzed by FDS. The experiment indicates that the basic spread law of fire that mainly spreads on one hand through combustible material on the surface of buildings and then comes to inside, on the other hand spreads from the <b>kindling</b> <b>point</b> to the interior of building and then through lift and corridor from downstairs and finally inside out. The air temperature and gas concentration firstly increase with increasing distance from the fire surface, and then decrease. By changing the maximum combustion temperature and transmit power of the surface decoration materials, it can reduce the influence of surrounding buildings which comes from thermal radiation...|$|E
40|$|Abstract: Slavoj Žižek {{shows in}} his book Absolute Recoil (and {{previous}} Hegelian works such as Less than Nothing) the importance of repeating Hegel’s dialectical philosophy in contemporary capitalism. Žižek contributes especially to a reconceptualisation of dialectical logic and based on it the dialectic of history. The reflections in this paper stress that the dialectic is only the absolute recoil, a sublation that posits its own presuppositions, by working as a living fire that extinguishes and <b>kindles</b> itself. I <b>point</b> out that a new foundation of dialectical materialism needs a proper Heraclitusian foundation. I discuss Žižek’s version of the dialectic that stresses the absolute recoil and the logic of retroactivity and point out its implications for the concept of history as well as Žižek’s own theoretical ambiguities that oscil-late between postmodern relativism and mechanical materialism. I argue that Žižek’s version of the dialectic should be brought into {{a dialogue with the}} dialectical philosophies of the German Marxists Hans Heinz Holz and Herbert Hörz. Žižek’s achievement is that he helps keeping alive the fire of dia-lectical materialism in the 21 st century. Such a dialectical fire is needed for a proper revolutionary theo-ry...|$|R
5000|$|On 21 August 2011, at {{the height}} of Anna Hazare's anti-corruption campaign, Arundhati Roy criticised Hazare and his {{movement}} in an opinion piece published in The Hindu. In the course of the article, she questioned Hazare's secular credentials, pointing out the campaign's corporate backing, its suspicious timing, Hazare's silence on private-sector corruption and other critical issues of the day, expressing her fear that the Lokpal will only end up creating [...] "two oligarchies, instead of just one". She states that while [...] "his means may be Gandhian, his demands are certainly not", and alleges that by [...] "demonising only the Government they" [...] are preparing to call for [...] "more privatisation, more access to public infrastructure and India's natural resources", satirically adding that it [...] "may not be long before Corporate Corruption is made legal and renamed a Lobbying Fee". Roy also accuses the electronic media of blowing the campaign out of proportion. In an interview with <b>Kindle</b> Magazine, Roy <b>pointed</b> out the role of media hype and target audience in determining how well hunger strikes “work as a tool of political mobilization” by noting the disparity in the attention Hazare’s fast has received in contrast to the decade-long fast of Irom Sharmila “to demand the repealing of a law that allows non-commissioned officers to kill on suspicion—a law that has led to so much suffering.” [...] Roy's comparison of the Jan Lokpal Bill with the Maoists: claiming both sought [...] "the overthrow of the Indian State" [...] met with resentment from members of Team Anna. Medha Patkar reacted sharply calling Roy's comments [...] "highly misplaced" [...] and chose to emphasise the [...] "peaceful, non-violent" [...] nature of the movement. [...] Roy has also stated that “an ‘anti-corruption’ campaign is a catch-all campaign. It includes everybody from the extreme left to the extreme right and also the extremely corrupt. No one’s going to say they are for corruption after all…I’m not against a strong anti-corruption bill, but corruption is just a manifestation of a problem, not the problem itself.” ...|$|R
40|$|An undelivered {{promise is}} not failed but unkept: a lie. The flame of liberal {{politics}} - heat both necessary and dangerous {{for such an}} order - is <b>kindled</b> at this <b>point.</b> More than its rivals, liberalism is grounded upon man’s capacity to promise, for liberal democracy advocates {{a world in which}} social order rests crucially upon the citizenry’s faith in the good consciences of those who govern. That liberalism rests upon this capacity to promise, and on the related notion of a conscience, is the locus between liberalism’s present and its future - its vision - creating its sense of causality and temporality. More broadly, this vision entails a general promise, a promise of happiness to the citizen who partakes in his own freedom. According to Adorno and Horkheimer, liberalism’s promise of happiness to those without power cheated and mocked the masses; the repeated suppression of their longing encrypts a destructive lust for a civilisation as yet unachieved, a lust in danger of becoming fascistic. Liberalism is fueled, then, both by its general promise and by the specific promises of those entrusted with power. It requires a sense of calculability about the world and its inhabitants that enables such promises to be made and believed. Any moment of disbelief, any lack of faith in another’s promise, is a moment that liberalism can contain - indeed, that it invites - but it is also the most fearful moment for the liberal machinery, the moment at which the general vision is doubted and alternative paths left and right are dreamt and drawn. Thus liberalism contains a necessary but potentially destabilising point at which the ability to make promises joins the ability to hesitate and, by the tracing of lines of causality, to imagine the future differently. The possibility of beginning anew, the possible moment at which promises are exchanged and plans laid down, is a profoundly political moment, one that Hannah Arendt valued as having the potential to enable political communication and community - the move from the ‘I will’ to the ‘we can’. But truly beginning anew - the true performance of freedom - is arguably incompatible with the notion of calculable man upon which the ability to promise rests, and clashes with the supposition of a clarity of thought and will that is represented by the ‘many-headed one’ of liberalism constituted by, or standing in for, individual wills. The freedom offered and defended by liberal rhetoric is a freedom that is entwined with these images of a subject whose integrity is an impossible perfection, a subject who can be calculated and predicted into the future {{at the same time as}} s/he has a clarity of thought and will that directs these very promises and predictions. 	Foucault’s distance from liberalism takes a cue from Nietzsche, in the sense that the two share the suspicion of the liberal citizen as a package for freedom. [...] .
