The Global Action Plan for <b>Influenza</b> <b>Vaccines</b> (GAP) was launched in 2006 to increase global capacity for <b>influenza</b> <b>vaccine</b> production to address these concerns. It is widely recognized that well-developed infrastructure to produce seasonal <b>influenza</b> <b>vaccines</b> leads to increased capacity to produce pandemic <b>influenza</b> <b>vaccines.</b> This article summarizes the results of a survey administered to 44 manufacturers to assess their production capacity for seasonal influenza and pandemic <b>influenza</b> <b>vaccine</b> production. When the GAP was launched in 2006, global production capacity for seasonal and pandemic vaccines was estimated to be 500 million and 1. 5 billion doses respectively. Since 2006 there has been a significant increase in capacity, with the 2013 survey estimating global capacity at 1. 5 billion seasonal and 6. 2 billion pandemic doses. Results of the current survey showed that global seasonal <b>influenza</b> <b>vaccine</b> production capacity has decreased since 2013 from 1. 504 billion doses to 1. 467 billion doses. However, notwithstanding the overall global decrease in seasonal vaccine capacity there were notable positive changes in the distribution of production capacity with increases noted in South East Asia (SEAR) and the Western Pacific (WPR) regions, albeit on a small scale. Despite a decrease in seasonal capacity, there has been a global increase of pandemic <b>influenza</b> <b>vaccine</b> production capacity from 6. 2 billion doses in 2013 to 6. 4 billion doses in 2015. This growth can be attributed to a shift towards more quadrivalent vaccine production and also to increased use of adjuvants.

Despite the enactment of a Global Action Plan for <b>Influenza</b> <b>Vaccines</b> and a multi-fold increase in production capabilities over the past 10 years, worldwide capacity for pandemic <b>influenza</b> <b>vaccine</b> production is still limited. In developing countries, where routine influenza vaccination is not fully established, additional measures are needed to ensure adequate supply of pandemic <b>influenza</b> <b>vaccines</b> without dependence on the shipment of aid from other, potentially impacted first-world countries. Adaptation of <b>influenza</b> <b>vaccine</b> and adjuvant technologies by developing country <b>influenza</b> <b>vaccine</b> manufacturers may enable antigen sparing and corresponding increases in global <b>influenza</b> <b>vaccine</b> coverage capacity. Following on previously described work involving the technology transfer of oil-in-water emulsion adjuvant manufacturing to a Romanian vaccine manufacturing institute, we herein describe the preclinical evaluation of inactivated split virion H 5 N 1 <b>influenza</b> <b>vaccine</b> with emulsion adjuvant, including immunogenicity, protection from virus challenge, antigen sparing capacity, and safety. In parallel with the evaluation of the bioactivity of the tech-transferred adjuvant, we also describe the impact of concurrent antigen manufacturing optimization activities. Depending on the vaccine antigen source and manufacturing process, inclusion of adjuvant was shown to enhance and broaden functional antibody titers in mouse and rabbit models, promote protection from homologous virus challenge in ferrets, and facilitate antigen sparing. Besides scientific findings, the operational lessons learned are delineated in order to facilitate adaptation of adjuvant technologies by other developing country institutes to enhance global pandemic influenza preparedness...|$|R
40|$|Despite {{the fact}} that <b>influenza</b> <b>vaccine</b> is an importanthealth resource, the {{structure}} and organization of the USvaccine manufacturing system has produced <b>influenza</b> <b>vaccine</b> shortages or distribution delays in five {{out of the last}} six influenza seasons. These shortages have produced the need for local public health officials to develop protocols for rationing and redistributing <b>influenza</b> <b>vaccine</b> at the local community level. In so doing, local health officials are confronted with significant practical and legal constraints associated with allocating a resource that is largely not under direct government control. In the face of an impending <b>influenza</b> <b>vaccine</b> shortage, local public health departments endeavor to do three things: (1) assess the local supply of vaccine, (2) assess the local demand from high-risk community members, and (3) ensure that to the greatest extent, the limited local supply of vaccine is used exclusively by those at highest risk within the local jurisdiction. There are a number of legal tools and strategies that local health officials have at their disposal to carry out these functions. This article will attempt to outline some of the significant legal impediments and practical constraints that local public health officials face in managing <b>influenza</b> <b>vaccine</b> supply-demand issues and will offer some suggestions for strengthening their ability to effectively manage these increasingly common situations.

40|$|In 2014, the European Committee for Medicinal Products for Human Use (CHMP) {{published}} a draft regulatory guideline {{for the evaluation}} of <b>influenza</b> <b>vaccines.</b> Following a public consultation round, the final guidance will be published in the near future. Here, we highlight the main changes in the clinical section in this guideline and discuss the background to these changes and whether the new consolidated guidance document can be expected to achieve {{a better understanding of the}} performance of seasonal, zoonotic and pandemic <b>influenza</b> <b>vaccines</b> during the regulatory licensing process. The new influenza guideline reflects a changed approach to the regulatory assessment of <b>influenza</b> <b>vaccines,</b> resulting in the abolition of serological criteria, known as the CHMP criteria, which have been the mainstay for evaluating the <b>influenza</b> <b>vaccine</b> immunogenicity for several decades. The new guideline adopts a more diversified approach to the measurement and reporting of the immune response to <b>influenza</b> <b>vaccines</b> and sets a requirement to conduct clinical outcome trials in young children. Importantly, more emphasis is placed on the post-licensure monitoring of the benefit risk of <b>influenza</b> <b>vaccines,</b> including a request for continuous monitoring of efficacy and enhanced safety surveillance. Despite the improvements these new requirements will expectedly bring to the regulatory assessment of <b>influenza</b> <b>vaccines,</b> major challenges remain which cannot be overcome by new guidance alone. Ongoing initiatives in which academia, manufacturers, public health institutes and regulators work together to address these challenges are central to the development of robust tools to evaluate and monitor performance of <b>influenza</b> <b>vaccines</b> in the future...|$|R
40|$|Cold-chain requirements, limited {{stockpiling}} {{potential and}} the lack of potent immune responses are major challenges of parenterally formulated <b>influenza</b> <b>vaccines.</b> Decreased cold chain dependence and stockpiling can be achieved if vaccines are formulated in a dry state using suitable excipients and drying technologies. Furthermore, having the vaccine in a dry state enables the development of non-parenteral patient friendly dosage forms: microneedles for transdermal administration, tablets for oral administration, and powders for epidermal, nasal or pulmonary administration. Moreover, these administration routes have the potential to elicit an improved immune response. This review highlights the rationale for the development of dried <b>influenza</b> <b>vaccines,</b> as well as processes used for the drying and stabilization of influenza vaccines; it also compares the immunogenicity of dried <b>influenza</b> <b>vaccines</b> administered via non-invasive routes with that of parenterally administered <b>influenza</b> <b>vaccines.</b> Finally, it discusses unmet needs, challenges and future developments in the field of dried <b>influenza</b> <b>vaccines...</b>|$|R
