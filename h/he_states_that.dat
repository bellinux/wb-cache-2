5|$|Officers in {{the field}} {{were well aware of}} the killing {{operations}} being conducted by the Einsatzgruppen.

5|$|Pliny {{addresses}} {{magic in}} Book XXX. He {{is critical of}} the Magi, attacking astrology, and suggesting that magic originated in medicine, creeping in by pretending to offer health.

5|$|Researchers at the University of L'Aquila, using ultrasonography, {{presented}} {{evidence that}} women who experience vaginal orgasms are statistically {{more likely to have}} thicker tissue in the anterior vaginal wall. The researchers believe these findings make it possible for women to have a rapid test to confirm whether or not they have a G-spot. Professor of genetic epidemiology, Tim Spector, who co-authored research questioning the existence of the G-spot and finalized it in 2009, also hypothesizes thicker tissue in the G-spot area; <b>he</b> <b>states</b> <b>that</b> this tissue may be part of the clitoris and is not a separate erogenous zone.|$|E
5|$|The {{earliest}} written references {{that have}} survived {{relating to the}} islands were made by Pliny the Elder in his Natural History, where <b>he</b> <b>states</b> <b>that</b> there are 30 Hebudes, and makes a separate reference to Dumna, which Watson (1926) concludes is unequivocally the Outer Hebrides. Writing about 80 years later, in 140-150AD, Ptolemy, drawing on the earlier naval expeditions of Agricola, writes that there are five Ebudes (possibly meaning the Inner Hebrides) and Dumna. Later texts in classical Latin, by writers such as Solinus, use the forms Hebudes and Hæbudes.|$|E
5|$|Bede, who is {{the main}} source for this information, is unclear on his {{chronology}} relating to Wighard. At {{one point in the}} Historia Ecclesiastica, <b>he</b> <b>states</b> <b>that</b> Canterbury had been vacant for some time before Wighard's election, but in other writings he implies that Wighard was appointed soon after the conclusion of the Council of Whitby, which likely took place in 664. However Wighard was selected, he died in Rome. His death possibly occurred around 664, but could have been as late as 667. It may have been caused by the bubonic plague, or perhaps was due to some other disease epidemic. Like much else in his life, it is unclear if he was actually consecrated before his death. The Oxford Dictionary of National Biography entry for Wighard states that he died before consecration. The historian Peter Blair, however, states that Wighard died {{as he was about to}} head home to Canterbury, after his consecration.|$|E

5|$|Buckler {{suggests}} the following: According to the Athenian politician Demosthenes, Kersebleptes met Philip at Maroneia (in Thrace), {{together with the}} Theban general Pammenes, and came to an agreement with Philip; furthermore, <b>he</b> <b>states</b> <b>that</b> Amadokos was hostile to Philip at the time. Demosthenes says that the Athenian general Chares filed the report about the meeting between Philip, Pammenes and Kersebleptes; and Polyaenus says that after Philip's Maroneia campaign, Chares ambushed Philip's fleet {{off the coast of}} Neapolis. Since it is recorded that Neapolis appealed to Athens for aid against Philip in 355 BC, it is a strong possibility that these events all took place in 355 BC. It is not entirely clear what occasioned this meeting between Philip and Kersebleptes; Buckler suggests that Philip and Kersebleptes agreed to divide Thrace between them, leaving Kersebleptes free to attack the other Thracian kings (to try to reunite the Thracian kingdom), and leaving Philip free to campaign elsewhere.|$|E
5|$|In the RAF, Marcinkus {{carried out}} {{multiple}} tasks, including various training missions, night combat and bomber escort. In June, Marcinkus and his squadron members engaged in prolonged air combat with the Luftwaffe. As later reports confirm, the Germans lost four Me 109 fighter aircraft, {{one of which}} was shot down by Marcinkus. The original report submitted by Marcinkus claiming one Me 109 shot down on 21 June 1941 is held in The National Archives; <b>he</b> <b>states</b> <b>that</b> he fired two short bursts from his guns from 100 yards behind the German. Sergeant Blasil, also of 1 Squadron, witnessed the plane break up in the air. On the allied side, one American pilot was missing. The last mission Marcinkus carried out as a RAF pilot was on 12 February 1942.|$|E
5|$|On 22 January 41 (Suetonius {{gives the}} date as 24 January), Cassius Chaerea and other guardsmen accosted Caligula as he {{addressed}} an acting troupe {{of young men}} during a series of games and dramatics held for the Divine Augustus. Details recorded on the events vary somewhat from source to source, but they agree that Chaerea stabbed Caligula first, followed {{by a number of}} conspirators. Suetonius records that Caligula's death resembled that of Julius Caesar. <b>He</b> <b>states</b> <b>that</b> both the elder Gaius Julius Caesar (Julius Caesar) and the younger Gaius Julius Caesar (Caligula) were stabbed 30 times by conspirators led by a man named Cassius (Cassius Longinus and Cassius Chaerea). By the time Caligula's loyal Germanic guard responded, the Emperor was already dead. The Germanic guard, stricken with grief and rage, responded with a rampaging attack on the assassins, conspirators, innocent senators and bystanders alike.|$|E
