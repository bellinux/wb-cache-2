The appraiser seeks enough comparables (as few as three in a residential analysis, many more in a non-residential appraisal) and makes adjustments to the comparables' selling prices according to the various factors of comparison. For example, if a subject residence is 1000 sq ft, but a comparable is 1,100, then the selling price of the comparable will be adjusted downward to account for this difference in value. The <b>downward</b> <b>adjustment</b> may be very small, since marginal prices of comparable factors are usually much lower than average prices over small ranges of values.|$|E

5000|$|Data is {{collected}} on recent sales of properties {{similar to the}} subject being valued, called [...] "comparables". Only SOLD properties {{may be used in}} an appraisal and determination of a property's value, as they represent amounts actually paid or agreed upon for properties. Sources of comparable data include real estate publications, public records, buyers, sellers, real estate brokers and/or agents, appraisers, and so on. Important details of each comparable sale are described in the appraisal report. Since comparable sales are not identical to the subject property, adjustments may be made for date of sale, location, style, amenities, square footage, site size, etc. The main idea is to simulate the price that would have been paid if each comparable sale were identical to the subject property. If the comparable is superior to the subject in a factor or aspect, then a <b>downward</b> <b>adjustment</b> is needed for that factor. Likewise, if the comparable is inferior to the subject in an aspect, then an upward adjustment for that aspect is needed. The adjustment is somewhat subjective and relies on the appraiser's training and experience. From the analysis of the group of adjusted sales prices of the comparable sales, the appraiser selects an indicator of value that is representative of the subject property. It is possible for various appraisers to choose a different indicator of value which ultimately will provide different property value.|$|E
50|$|Property {{tax rates}} in 2013-14 were {{set by the}} Plum Borough School Board at 18.75 mills. The rate {{included}} a <b>downward</b> <b>adjustment</b> due to the County's recent property reassessment. A mill is $1 of tax for every $1,000 of a property's assessed value. Irregular property reassessments have become a serious issue in the commonwealth as it creates a significant disparity in taxation within a community and across a region. Property taxes, in the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania, apply only to real estate - land and buildings. The property tax is not levied on cars, business inventory, or other personal property. Certain types of property are exempt from property taxes, including: places of worship, places of burial, private social clubs, charitable and educational institutions and government property. Additionally, service related, disabled US military veterans may seek an exemption from paying property taxes. Pennsylvania school district revenues are dominated by two main sources: 1) Property tax collections, which account {{for the vast majority}} (between 75-85%) of local revenues; and 2) Act 511 tax collections, which are around 15% of revenues for school districts. When the school district includes municipalities in two counties, each of which has different rates of property tax assessment, a state board equalizes the tax rates between the counties. In 2010, miscalculations by the State Tax Equalization Board (STEB) were widespread in the Commonwealth and adversely impacted funding for many school districts, including those that did not cross county borders.|$|E
30|$|In {{most of the}} {{specifications}} in Table 3, the estimates of the adjustment cost parameters have the expected signs and they are highly significant. 21 The estimates reveal asymmetry in adjustment costs. Except for one case (specification II with alternative growth rate), <b>downward</b> <b>adjustment</b> cost parameters are higher than upward adjustment cost parameters, both for the average-wage and employment adjustment. The equality of the upward and <b>downward</b> <b>adjustment</b> cost parameters are rejected at high levels of significance across most specifications. Furthermore, the <b>downward</b> <b>adjustment</b> cost parameters are generally larger in absolute value when all plants are considered (specifications II and IV), compared with the case of continuing plants only (specifications I and III). This difference suggests that failing plants face higher <b>downward</b> <b>adjustment</b> costs. The adjustment cost parameter estimates are generally smaller under alternative growth rates.|$|E

The introduction of an adjustable balloon could improve comfort and offer greater efficacy. A migration prevention function, safely enabling prolonged implantation, could improve efficacy and weight maintenance post-extraction. The first implantations of an adjustable balloon with an attached migration prevention anchor are reported. The primary endpoint was the absence of bowel perforation, obstruction, or hemorrhage. Eighteen patients with mean BMI of 37. 3 were implanted with the Spatz Adjustable Balloon system (ABS) for 12  months. Balloon volumes were adjusted for intolerance or weight loss plateau. Mean weight loss at 24  weeks was 15. 6  kg with 26. 4 % EWL (percent of excess weight loss) and 24. 4  kg with 48. 8 % EWL at 52  weeks. Sixteen adjustments were successfully performed.
