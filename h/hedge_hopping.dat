50|$|The {{collared}} sparrowhawk mainly eats small birds, the crested pigeon {{and spotted}} bowerbird {{are the largest}} birds that sparrowhawks have been recorded taking. They also catch insects, lizards and small mammals (including small bats). Sparrowhawks rely on stealth and surprise to catch their prey, hunting in flight or bursting from a concealed perch among foliage. Most prey weighs less than 100g and rarely over 200g. It forages by short-stay perch hunting from a concealed position in foliage, punctuated by short tree-to-tree, often undulating flights. It also forages by low fast flight, sometimes <b>hedge</b> <b>hopping.</b> Prey is seized in flight by a direct flying attack or a stealthy glide.|$|E
2500|$|May {{spoke about}} this {{incident}} years later, saying, [...] "the first thing I knew I was being fired {{on from the}} rear ... all I could do was try to dodge my attacker. I noticed it was a red tri-plane, but if I realized it was Richthofen, I would have probably {{passed out on the}} spot. I kept on dodging and spinning, I imagine from about 12,000 feet until I ran out of sky and had to <b>hedge</b> <b>hop</b> over the ground. Richthofen was firing at me continually, [...] the only thing that saved me was my poor flying. I didn't know what I was doing myself and I do not suppose that Richthofen could figure out what I was going to do".|$|R
60|$|Eastward was {{the wise}} man's course, a road dipping between <b>hedges</b> to a <b>hop</b> garden and a wood and {{presently}} no doubt reaching an inn, a picturesque church, perhaps, a village and fresh company. The wise man's course. Mr. Polly saw himself going along it, {{and tried to}} see himself going along it with all the self-applause a wise man feels. But somehow it wouldn't come like that. The wise man fell short of happiness for all his wisdom. The wise man had a paunch and round shoulders and red ears and excuses. It was a pleasant road, and why the wise man should not go along it merry and singing, full of summer happiness, was a miracle to Mr. Polly's mind, but confound it! the fact remained, the figure went slinking--slinking was the only word for it--and would not go otherwise than slinking. He turned his eyes westward as if for an explanation, and if the figure was no longer ignoble, the prospect was appalling.|$|R
