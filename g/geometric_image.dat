50|$|In {{the summer}} of 1940, he was {{assistant}} of professor Zernike at the University of Groningen. As part of his research, he studied the problem in theoretical optics: optical imaging in a microscope. The problem here is to evaluate the effect of diffraction to be charged, causes {{in combination with the}} <b>geometric</b> <b>image</b> errors due to the lens being not ideal. His teacher Zernike had developed a computational method for the case of spherical aberration and Nijboer managed to expand for astigmatism and coma. Het results staat bekend als de Nijboer-Zernike theory. In 1942 he was promoted at work in his thesis The diffraction theory of aberrations. At the beginning of the 21st century, the theory again came in the spotlight thanks to advances in the chip lithography. In 2002, sixty years after Nijboers thesis, his research continued in the Extended Nijboer Zernike (ENZ) Analysis & Aberration Retrieval by researchers at the Philips Research Laboratories in Eindhoven and the TU Delft.|$|E

40|$|AbstractBackgroundClinically and biologically, autism {{spectrum}} disorder (ASD) is heterogeneous. Unusual {{patterns of}} visual preference as indexed by eye tracking are hallmarks; however, {{whether they can}} be used to define an early biomarker of ASD as a whole or leveraged to define a subtype is unclear. To begin to examine this issue, large cohorts are required. MethodsA sample of 334 toddlers from six distinct groups (115 toddlers with ASD, 20 toddlers with ASD features, 57 toddlers with developmental delay, 53 toddlers with other conditions [e. g., premature birth, prenatal drug exposure], 64 toddlers with typical development, and 25 unaffected toddlers with siblings with ASD) was studied. Toddlers watched a movie containing <b>geometric</b> and social <b>images.</b> Fixation duration and number of saccades within each area of interest and validation statistics for this independent sample were computed. Next, to maximize power, data from our previous study (n = 110) were added for a total of 444 subjects. A subset of toddlers repeated the eye-tracking procedure. ResultsAs in the original study, a subset of toddlers with ASD fixated on <b>geometric</b> <b>images</b> > 69 % of the time. Using this cutoff, sensitivity for ASD was 21 %, specificity was 98 %, and positive predictive value was 86 %. Toddlers with ASD who strongly preferred <b>geometric</b> <b>images</b> had 1) worse cognitive, language, and social skills relative to toddlers with ASD who strongly preferred social images and 2) fewer saccades when viewing <b>geometric</b> <b>images.</b> Unaffected siblings of ASD probands did not show evidence of heightened preference for <b>geometric</b> <b>images.</b> Test-retest reliability was good. Examination of age effects suggested that this test may not be appropriate with children > 4 years old. ConclusionsEnhanced visual preference for geometric repetition may be an early developmental biomarker of an ASD subtype with more severe symptoms...|$|R

40|$|In medical {{computed}} tomography (CT) the tomographic images are reconstructed from planar information collected 180 ∘ to 360 ∘ around the patient. In clinical applications, the reconstructions are typically produced using a filtered backprojection algorithm. Filtered backprojection methods have limitations {{that create a}} high percentage of statistical uncertainty in the reconstructed images. Many techniques have been developed which produce better reconstructions, but they tend to be computationally expensive, and thus, impractical for clinical use;Artificial neural networks (ANN) {{have been shown to be}} adept at learning and then simulating complex functional relationships. For medical tomography, a neural network can be trained to produce a reconstructed medical image given the planar data as input. Once trained an ANN can produce an accurate reconstruction very quickly;A backpropagation ANN with statistically derived activation functions has been developed to improve the trainability and generalization ability of a network to produce accurate reconstructions. The tailored activation functions are derived from the estimated probability density functions (p. d. f. s) of the ANN training data set. A set of sigmoid derivative functions are fitted to the p. d. f. s and then integrated to produce the ANN activation functions, which are also estimates of the cumulative distribution functions (c. d. f. s) of the training data. The statistically tailored activation functions and their derivatives are substituted for the logistic function and its derivative that are typically used in backpropagation ANNs;A set of <b>geometric</b> <b>images</b> was derived for training an ANN for cardiac SPECT image reconstruction.
