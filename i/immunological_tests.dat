5|$|Following the {{establishment}} of evolutionary biology, studies of mutation and genetic diversity in natural populations, combined with biogeography and systematics, led to sophisticated mathematical and causal models of evolution. Paleontology and comparative anatomy allowed more detailed reconstructions of the evolutionary history of life. After the rise of molecular genetics in the 1950s, the field of molecular evolution developed, based on protein sequences and <b>immunological</b> <b>tests,</b> and later incorporating RNA and DNA studies. The gene-centered view of evolution rose to prominence in the 1960s, followed by the neutral theory of molecular evolution, sparking debates over adaptationism, the unit of selection, and {{the relative importance of}} genetic drift versus natural selection as causes of evolution. In the late 20th-century, DNA sequencing led to molecular phylogenetics and the reorganization of the tree of life into the three-domain system by Carl Woese. In addition, the newly recognized factors of symbiogenesis and horizontal gene transfer introduced yet more complexity into evolutionary theory. Discoveries in evolutionary biology have made a significant impact not just within the traditional branches of biology, but also in other academic disciplines (for example: anthropology and psychology) and on society at large.|$|E

An evaluation of the test sensitivity and specificity has been derived from the concordances and discordances of the results compared with another parameter (fourfold Table: 2 X 2); the statistical processing has been carried out using the Pearson's chi-square (X 2) Test (p <= 0, 05). The statistical analysis made by comparing the <b>immunological</b> <b>test</b> and personal history showed a X 2 = 14. 91 (p <= 0. 001), sensibility = 63 % and specificity = 84 %; also {{the results of}} the comparison between the Hemodia test and instrumental examinations showed statistical significance (X 2 = 6. 73; p <= 0. 01) and good sensibility (70. 5 %) and specificity (80 %) values. The <b>immunological</b> <b>test,</b> compared with family history, showed no statistical significance.

5000|$|In humans, P. skrjabini infections {{can result}} {{in a wide variety of}} symptoms, {{rendering}} it difficult to diagnose and challenging to quickly enact proper treatment. [...] Diagnosis typically requires first a general recognition of the symptoms followed by laboratory and radiologic tests.

[...] Serological or <b>immunological</b> <b>tests</b> including intradermal test, immunodiffusion, indirect haemagglutination test, enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay, and Western blot also play a key role in not only diagnosing the overall presence of Paragonimus parasites in the body but also distinguishing the various different species invading. [...] The ELISA test detects the antibody used to combat the P. skrjabini infection. [...] Although cases of P. skrjabini infection can exhibit early symptoms such as abdominal pain, a lack of appetite, and high fever, it can also come on slowly and fail to exhibit identifiable symptoms for a period of latency between 20 days to as long as 3 months. [...] Later on in the infection, the type of symptoms that appear primarily depends on which organs the P. skrjabini parasites enter. [...] Infections and the resulting set of symptoms can be classified under five different types including the subcutaneous mass type, cerebral type, pericarditis type, abdominal type, and pleurisy type. [...] Infections of the pleurisy type, for instance, exhibit symptoms like chest pain and cough while the cerebral type tends to result in vomiting and headaches. [...] The pericarditis type is associated with shortness of breath and palpitation while the abdominal type infections lead to diarrhea and abdominal pain. [...] P. skrjabini has shown no effect on mammalian reproductive abilities. [...] Despite occasional cases resulting in death, P. skrjabini has not been widely known to cause morbidity and death.

40|$|Introduction: An unusual case of {{positive}} <b>immunological</b> <b>testing</b> for cysticercosis in the cystic fluid obtained from an anaplastic oligoastrocytoma is presented. Case report: A 15 -year-old boy was admitted with multiple brain lesions. The biggest was a cyst with a mural node and neurocysticercosis was suspected. In order to relieve intracranial pressure, the cyst was punctured and the <b>immunological</b> <b>testing</b> for cysticercosis was positive, reinforcing the clinical suspicion and {{leading to a}} clinical trial with albendazole and steroids. As the patient deteriorated the cystic lesion was removed and the diagnosis of anaplastic oligoastrocytoma was established. A second lesion was eventually approached and the histopathological diagnosis of both specimens concurred. Discussion: Although some authors believe that chronic inflammatory changes following neurocysticercosis could induce the formation of brain tumors, this association may be a mere coincidence. In our case no clinical evidence of a prior infestation by Cysticercus was found. In fact, an exhaustive examination of the specimens did not reveal any areas of inflammatory reaction. We believe that the similarity of the glioma and cysticercosis antigens may {{be the cause of}} the positive reactions in the cystic fluid...|$|R
