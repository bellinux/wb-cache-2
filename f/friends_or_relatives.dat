If my brothers or whoever wants to come and work in government, they shouldn't be allowed to work in government. If you want to pass a law that says one individual is in government, then none of their <b>friends</b> <b>or</b> <b>relatives</b> can work in government, then you should pass that law.|$|E
5|$|Most of {{the cast}} were <b>friends</b> <b>or</b> <b>relatives</b> of the Draper-Wolff clan. Tim Draper is Polly's brother and John B. Williams is the cellist for Michael Wolff's band Impure Thoughts. Barbara eda-Young, James Badge-Dale, Gretchen Egolf, and Cooper Pillot had {{previously}} performed with Draper in her playwriting Getting Into Heaven in 2003. Jesse Draper is Tim's daughter and thus Polly's niece, and Nat and Alex's cousin. Billy and Adam Draper are Tim's sons, and Coulter Mulligan is Jesse's cousin and Polly's nephew.|$|E
5|$|On 1 September 1950, in {{the middle}} of a holiday in Italy, Pontecorvo {{abruptly}} flew from Rome for Stockholm with his wife and three sons without informing <b>friends</b> <b>or</b> <b>relatives.</b> On 2 September he was helped by Soviet agents to enter the Soviet Union from Finland. His abrupt disappearance caused much concern to many of the western intelligence services, especially those of Britain, Canada and the United States, that were worried about the escape of atomic secrets to the Soviet Union, and of Finland and Sweden, through which Pontecorvo and Marianne had been allowed to travel without valid passports and visas.|$|E

5|$|The {{biggest concern}} was food; {{ensuring}} {{there was enough}} food occupied most of the internees' time. Little food {{was provided by the}} Japanese authorities, and it was of poor quality – frequently containing dust, mud, rat and cockroach excreta, cigarette ends, and sometimes dead rats. Everyday, the internees were served rice congee at 8am, and meals consisting of rice with stew at both 11 a.m. and 5 p.m. Additionally, they relied on food mailed from <b>friends</b> <b>or</b> <b>relatives</b> in the city, Red Cross aid, garden-grown vegetables, and bought food from the canteen or the black market.|$|E
5|$|The {{threat of}} Emily {{prompted}} hurricane warnings {{for much of}} the North Carolina coast and northward through Delaware. A mandatory evacuation for Ocracoke and Hatteras islands displaced 160,000people during the busy Labor Day weekend; the loss in tourism revenue amounted to $10million (1993USD). About 1,600residents on these islands rode out the storm in their homes, and emergency officials stayed behind. Most of the evacuees went to hotels or stayed with <b>friends</b> <b>or</b> <b>relatives,</b> causing an increase in business across southeastern Virginia, where effects were minimal. Due to uncertainty in forecasting Emily's path, there were also evacuations from the coasts of Virginia, Maryland, Delaware, and Fire Island in New York.|$|E
5|$|A {{study was}} {{performed}} on the storm in eight counties in North Carolina to determine the cost of evacuation for hurricanes, and included 1,029 households. Another study was performed regarding the actions taken during Hurricane Bonnie evacuations in the state. Tourists were interviewed, and it was found that 90% of vacationers who were threatened by the hurricane evacuated, of which 56% went home, 3% stayed in public shelters, 22% stayed with <b>friends</b> <b>or</b> <b>relatives,</b> 3% stayed in hotels and motels, and 16% stayed elsewhere. In total, 58% stayed within North Carolina, 12% went to Virginia, 6% relocated to South Carolina, and 24% stayed in other regions. Most of the evacuees left on August 25; 80% left with their own vehicles, and 18% used rental transportation. Officials in the state opened an estimated 100 shelters to accommodate the evacuating tourists and residents.|$|E

5|$|Students in Malawi have {{expressed}} {{high levels of}} dissatisfaction regarding the HIV/AIDS-related education and support they receive at school. According to a survey of students in Malawi, most secondary students {{do not believe that}} the HIV/AIDS curricula at their schools provide them with an adequate understanding of the disease. Although the Malawian government and non-governmental organizations have conducted many campaigns to improve awareness about HIV/AIDS in schools, there is still a significant shortage of age-appropriate audio and visual educational materials relating to HIV/AIDS available to instructors, particularly in rural areas. In addition, most teachers cannot identify the students in their classes who have been personally affected by the epidemic, either through <b>friends</b> <b>or</b> <b>relatives,</b> which suggests that school-based support for HIV/AIDS is minimal. However, despite this lack of support, surveys indicate that children who have been affected by the epidemic do not usually experience HIV/AIDS-based discrimination at school.|$|E
5|$|The debtors' {{prison at}} the castle {{came in for}} {{particular}} scrutiny. It emerged {{that out of the}} 402 cases brought before the court at St Briavels' Castle, 397 of them were for extremely small sums of debt of £5 or less (£373 in 2009 prices), increasingly unacceptable in Victorian eyes. A penalty of up to £7 (£522 in 2009 prices) was also being charged for each case, making the process extremely onerous for the local poor being prosecuted in this way. The investigation found that the keeper of the debtors' prison, which could hold up to six inmates at a time, was appointed by the constable, and made part of his income by charging each prisoner one shilling a week {{for the use of the}} beds in the prison; with no other public funding, prisoners depended on <b>friends</b> <b>or</b> <b>relatives</b> for food and other essentials, or from donations from their original parishes.|$|E
5|$|The JNA {{effort to}} relieve its Vukovar barracks {{turned into a}} {{protracted}} siege, delaying 36,000 troops and {{a significant proportion of}} armoured units slated for the thrust towards Zagreb and Varaždin. Vukovar was captured in mid-November but the victory proved pyrrhic because it completely disrupted the overall campaign. During the Battle of Vukovar, the JNA formally approved the use of paramilitary volunteers to fill its ranks. These included the White Eagles and the Serb Volunteer Guard (SVG), which were trained by the Serbian Ministry of Interior. On 12 October, the federal presidency authorized the JNA to enlist the volunteers as an estimated 150,000 people had emigrated from Yugoslavia, while others had taken refuge with <b>friends</b> <b>or</b> <b>relatives</b> to avoid the JNA draft. After capturing Vukovar, the JNA 12th Corps and the SVG advanced south-west across the Bosut on 15–16 November, and west between Vinkovci and Osijek, on 20 November, but the Croatian forcesrenamed the Croatian Army (Hrvatska vojska - HV) that monthcontained their advances. According to General Života Panić, commander of the JNA 1st Military District at the time, the immediate objectives of the advances were Osijek and Županja.|$|E

25|$|One reason many First Lords {{chose not}} to live in Number 10 was that most were peers who owned homes {{superior}} in size and quality. To them, Number 10 was unimpressive. Their possession of the house, albeit temporary, was a perk they could use as a political reward. Most lent it to the Chancellor of the Exchequer, others to lesser officials, and still others to <b>friends</b> <b>or</b> <b>relatives.</b>|$|E
25|$|The <b>friends</b> <b>or</b> <b>relatives</b> of a {{deceased}} patient {{were free to}} remove the remains for burial. Failing this, the deceased were interred in unmarked paupers' graves in the hospitals burial ground. With the 1832 Anatomy Act, the body was first kept in a building called the 'dead house', {{on the west side}} of the burial ground (see diagram above). If unclaimed after 72 hours it could be sold to a licensed anatomy school. The Act also provided for the donation of bodies.|$|E

25|$|However, in Portugal and Spain, usually, men only kiss women (even with strangers, {{although}} {{in this case}} a handshake is more common). In Portuguese families men often kiss men, but the handshake is the most common salutation between them. However, men kissing may occur in Spain as well particularly when congratulating close <b>friends</b> <b>or</b> <b>relatives.</b> Cheek to cheek and the kiss in the air are also very popular. Hugging is common between men and men and women and women; when the other is from the opposite sex, a kiss may be added.|$|E
25|$|Several {{organizations}} {{of family members}} {{of people who have}} died in the attacks are calling for an independent investigation into the attacks. In 2009, a group of people, including 9/11 Truth movement activist Lorie Van Auken and others who have lost <b>friends</b> <b>or</b> <b>relatives</b> in the attack, appealed to the City of New York to investigate the disaster. The New York City Coalition for Accountability Now collected signatures to require the New York City Council to place the creation of an investigating commission on the November 2009 election ballot. The group collected more than enough signatures to put the proposal before the voters, but New York Supreme Court Justice Edward Lehner stated that the petition overstepped what is allowable by city law, and ruled that, despite wording in the petition to allow for elements ruled invalid to be stricken, it {{would not be allowed to}} appear on the ballot.|$|E
25|$|In 1739, {{shortly after}} {{arriving}} in America, William began a relationship with Catherine Weisenberg (c. 1723–1759), a German Electorate of the Palatinate immigrant. She originally came to the colonies as an indentured servant, but had run away, perhaps {{with the help of}} <b>friends</b> <b>or</b> <b>relatives.</b> According to tradition, she was working for another family near Warrensburgh when Johnson purchased the remainder of her indenture contract, perhaps initially to have her serve as his housekeeper. There is no record that the couple ever formally married,; Weisenberg was Johnson's common-law wife. The couple had three children, including daughters Nancy and Mary (Polly), and a son John, first christened under only Weisenberg's name at Fort Hunter. The senior Johnson later arranged for his son John to inherit his title and estates as John Johnson. A grandson of Sir William Johnson was the 3rd Baronet Sir Adam Gordon Johnson who was, through his mother Ann Watts, descendants of the Schuyler family, the Delancey family, and the Van Cortlandt family of British North America.|$|E
