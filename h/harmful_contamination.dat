Based on a chlorpyrifos-degrading fungus Cladosporium cladosporioides strain Hu- 01 (collection number: CCTCC M 20711), a fungal wettable powder preparation was developed aiming to efficiently remove chlorpyrifos residues from vegetables. The formula {{was determined to be}} 11. 0 % of carboxymethyl cellulose-Na, 9. 0 % of polyethylene glycol 6000, 5. 0 % of primary alcohol ethoxylate, 2. 5 % of glycine, 5. 0 % of fucose, 27. 5 % of kaolin and 40 % of freeze dried fungi by response surface methodology (RSM). The results of quality inspection indicated that the fungal preparation could reach manufacturing standards. Finally, the degradation of chlorpyrifos by this fungal preparation was determined on pre-harvest cabbage. Compared to the controls without fungal preparation, the degradation of chlorpyrifos on cabbages, which was sprayed with the fungal preparation, was up to 91 % after 7 d. These results suggested this freeze-dried fungal wettable powder may possess potential for biodegradation of chlorpyrifos residues on vegetables and provide a potential strategy for food and environment safety against pesticide residues...|$|R
40|$|As {{the number}} of {{bacterial}} genomes increases dramatically, the demand for easy to use tools with transparent functionality and comprehensible output for applied comparative genomics grows as well. We present BlAst Diagnostic Gene findEr (BADGE), a tool for the rapid prediction of diagnostic marker genes (DMGs) for the differentiation of bacterial groups (e. g. pathogenic / nonpathogenic). DMG identification settings can be modified easily and installing and running BADGE does not require specific bioinformatics skills. During the BADGE run the user is informed step by step about the DMG finding process, thus {{making it easy to}} evaluate the impact of chosen settings and options. On the basis of an example with relevance for beer brewing, being one of the oldest biotechnological processes known, we show a straightforward procedure, from phenotyping, genome sequencing, assembly and annotation, up to a discriminant marker gene PCR assay, making comparative genomics a means to an end. The value and the functionality of BADGE were thoroughly examined, resulting in the successful identification and validation of an outstanding novel DMG (fabZ) for the discrimination of harmless and <b>harmful</b> <b>contaminations</b> of Pediococcus damnosus, which can be applied for spoilage risk determination in breweries.

50|$|Other sources {{state that}} a single oyster can filter 24-96 liters a day(1-4 liters per hour). With 750,000 oysters in one acre, 18,000,000-72,000,000 liters of water can be filtered, {{removing}} most forms of particulate matter suspended in the water column. The particulate matter oysters remove are sand, clay, silt, detritus, and phytoplankton. These particulates all could possibly contain <b>harmful</b> <b>contamination</b> that originates from anthropogenic sources (the land or directly flowing {{into the body of}} water). Instead of becoming ingested by other filter feeders that are then digested by bigger organisms, oysters can sequester these possibly harmful pollutants, and excrete them into the sediment at the bottom of waterways. To remove these contaminants from the sediment, species of seaweed can be added to take up these contaminants in their plant tissues that could be removed and taken to a contained area where the contamination is benign to the surrounding environment.|$|E
40|$|We {{study the}} effects on credit {{allocation}} and bank stability of introducing a leverage ratio requirement (LRR) on top of risk-based capital requirements, as in Basel III. For the current 3 % LRR, both low-risk and high-risk loan rates and volumes remain essentially unchanged, because banks previously specializing in low-risk lending can adapt by granting both low-risk and high-risk loans. For sufficiently high LRRs, low-risk lending rates would significantly increase and high-risk lending rates would fall. In the presence of severe ‘model risk’ concerning low-risk loans, as happened in the subprime crisis, the current 3 % LRR might even reduce bank stability, counter to regulatory intentions. This is because the allocational effect caused by the LRR, which makes bank loan portfolios more alike, may turn beneficial risk spreading into <b>harmful</b> risk <b>contamination.</b> For higher levels of LRR, however, bank stability {{is likely to be}} improved even in the presence of model risk. bank regulation; Basel III; capital requirements; credit risk; leverage ratio...|$|R

40|$|Formation of {{hexagonal}} domains {{in group}} IV and III-V nanowires {{has been a}} point of intensive study {{in the last few}} years due to the dramatic influence of these domains on the electronic and optoelectronic properties of these nanostructures [1, 2]. Wurtzite/Zinc-blende heterostructures have been found to influence the optical properties in III-V nanowires [3]. It is also expected that the presence of these heterostructures will change the transport properties [2]. The nanowires were grown by the Vapor-Liquid-Solid method, in which a metallic nanoparticle is used to catalyze the the nucleation and growth of the nanowires. Gold is the most widely used metal, because of its ease of implementation for the growth. Gold is an undesired metal for Si-based technology. As a consequence, the use of other catalysts such as Cu, In, Al or even catalyst-free nanowires growth have been studied [4]. Recently, after successful use of Ga as catalyst for III-V NWs [5], the use of Ga as an alternative catalyst for Si NWs growth has been also implemented [6]. The main benefit of using Ga is to avoid <b>harmful</b> <b>contamination</b> of the nanowires.

40|$|The {{discipline}} of protecting solar system objects from <b>harmful</b> <b>contamination</b> {{resulting from the}} activities of interplanetary spacecraft, and of similarly protecting the Earth from uncontrolled release of a putative extra-terrestrial organism from returned extra-terrestrial samples, is called planetary protection. Planetary protection requirements for robotic exploration of Mars have been refined over time as more became understood {{about the nature of}} the Martian environment as a potential habitat. Likewise, increased understanding of the limits of life on Earth continues to inform planetary protection policy. In planning for future human exploration of Mars, it is recognized that planetary protection controls for human missions will often be supportive of other important mission needs, such as maximizing closed-loop and recycling capabilities to minimize mass required, minimizing exposure of humans to planetary materials for multiple health reasons, and minimizing contamination of planetary samples and environments during exploration and science activities. In this paper, we outline the progress and plans of a current IAA Study Group that is engaging robotic and human mission developers and scientists in exploring detailed technical, engineering and operational approaches by which planetary protection objectives can be accomplished for human missions. This will be considered through the prism of the planetary protection aspects of the NASA Mars Destination Operations Team, and assessment of current technological capabilities and knowledge gaps.

40|$|Coffee (Coffea arabica) {{is one of}} {{the most}} {{economically}} important agricultural crops in Central America where it is generally grown under shade trees. In Costa Rica, large amounts of fertilizers, particularly nitrogen, are applied under intensive coffee cultivation with potential <b>harmful</b> <b>contamination</b> of groundwater. Shade trees improve coffee soil fertility, but can provide some disadvantages such as competition for soil water, notably during the dry season. Consequently, modelling the water balance is essential in order to predict water uxes, particularly water drainage and possible water table contamination. Thus, the objective of this study was to calibrate a mechanistic model in order to simulate and compare the water uxes over two consecutive years in two coffee agrosystems with shade of Inga densi ora and in full sun, in the Central Valley of Costa Rica. To do so the following eld and laboratory measurements were taken: i) soil water content monitored by TDR measurements over the 2 production cycles; ii) soil properties at various depths, including bulk density, soil retention curve and saturation hydraulic conductivity; iii) meteorological data and calculated ETP; iv) water consumption of coffee and trees; v) rainfall interception by the canopy of shade trees and coffee plants; vi) trunk ow of coffee and shade trees; and vii) surface runoff. The model satisfactorily simulates soil water content over the year at different depths down to 200 cm. The model also simulates the dynamic water partitioning between components of the coffee system (vegetation transpiration, soil water content, runoff) and hence can be a useful tool in recommending selection and management of shade trees with respect to rainfall and soil water availability. Furthermore, this work permits the calculation of the amount of water drainage and hence provides a sound basis for calculation of nitrate leaching out the system into the sub-soil and aquifers...|$|E

Air samples were collected through an impaction method, while surface samples were collected by the swabbing method and subjected to further macro- and micro-scopic observations. In addition, we collected air samples using the impinger method in order to perform real-time quantitative PCR (qPCR) amplification of genes from specific fungal species, namely A. flavus, A. fumigatus and A. ochraceus complexes.

40|$|Within the Aspergillus genus, Aspergillus fumigatus {{species is}} one of the most {{ubiquitous}} saprophytic fungi and is considered the section of species with higher clinical relevance. This section is the most common cause of invasive aspergillosis and a major source of infection-related mortality in immunocompromised patients. One of the most abundant metabolites produced by this fungus is the metabolite gliotoxin, which exhibits a diverse array of biologic effects on the immune system. The aim of the present work was to determine the prevalence of Aspergillus section Fumigati by cultural and molecular methods in poultry; swine/bovine; and large animal (bovine and horses) slaughterhouses. Air samples were collected through an impaction method, while surface samples were collected by the swabbing method and subject to further macro and microscopic observations. In addition, we collected air samples using the impinger method in order to perform real-time quantitative PCR (qPCR) amplification of genes from A. fumigatus complex. Aspergillus section Fumigati was present only in Stacker, Bleeding and Evisceration air collected from the Poultry Slaughterhouse (10 – 30 CFU. m 3), and in air from the Gut Room collected in the Bovine Slaughterhouse (10 CFU. m 3). Molecular tools amplified successfully DNA from the A. fumigatus complex in six sampling sites where the presence of this fungal species was not identified by conventional methods. Besides suggesting A. fumigatus complex as an indicator of <b>harmful</b> fungal <b>contamination</b> in this occupational setting, this study also indicates that conventional and molecular tools should be used as a combined strategy to ensure a proper characterization of fungal occupational exposure. Moreover, in the considered slaughterhouses, fungal contamination results pinpoint to co-exposure to other mycotoxins. In fact, occupational exposure to aflatoxin B 1 has already been detected in Poultry Slaughterhouse. Therefore, there is a need for considering possible interactions between mycotoxins and fungi and this should be taken into account in the risk assessment process. N/...|$|R
40|$|For {{semiconductor}} components, {{the demand}} {{to improve performance}} and velocity as well as energy consumption is met through miniaturization. The continuing trend to miniaturize semiconductor structures can be observed since several decades and requires, among other things, sophisticated cleanliness technology. Cleanliness technology {{in this context is}} to be understood as the chain of all activities taken to control and reduce all <b>contamination</b> <b>harmful</b> to the product. Because of the very challenging particulate and outgassing contamination levels, semiconductor industry still claims technological and economic leadership in terms of cleanliness technology. But no longer only semiconductor industry is relying on cleanliness technology as the following case studies graphically demonstrate: In life science industries, mainly microbiological contamination is controlled to prevent users and patients from severe health issues caused by poor hygiene or cleanliness of the highly effective pharmaceuticals or very innovative medical devices. Space exploration combines nowadays the challenging cleanliness requirements of semiconductor and pharmaceutical industry to be in compliance with the planetary protection program, the guiding principle to preserve planetary and terrestrial conditions for future generations. And even automotive industry discovered the benefit of cleanliness technology almost ten years ago: Metallic micro sized particles (> 50 µm) were identified as critical contamination because they can cause malfunctions in fluidic and electronic vehicle systems such as antiblocking systems. By having a closer look on these three case studies, the increasing importance and on-going diversification of cleanliness technology can be shown and also the challenging future requirements of cleanliness technology {{over the next few years}} can be derived...|$|R
40|$|Robust ” {{inference}} for the Cox model commonly {{refers to}} the use of the Lin and Wei (1989) sandwich variance estimator (LW) in conjunction with the partial likelihood estimator. It usu-ally means that under certain misspecifications of the Cox model, e. g. covariate omission or slight deviations from the proportional hazards assumption, the test size is better preserved. In modern robustness theory a testing procedure must be stable in a neighbourhood of the as-sumed model both under the null and alternative to be declared robust. This property is usually required to deal with outliers, e. g. abnormal long-term survivors, a common and particularly <b>harmful</b> type of <b>contamination</b> in that setting. We examine the properties of the LW approach under that paradigm and draw a link with a robust estimator (RE) and related Wald test that emerged over the years from the work of Bednarski and colleagues- see for instance Bed-narski (1999). We show that, at least literally, the asymptotic variance for RE is a generalisation of the LW formula and compare it to the LW approach in the exact same setting. We also show that the results are contrasted in terms of robust testing in the more modern sense of the word. Only the Wald test based on RE can maintain its level if the neighbourhood shrinks as the sam-ple size increases. Our work provides some new insight into the nature of robust inference in the Cox model, and the types of contamination the proposed procedures can and cannot deal with...|$|R
40|$|Sediments {{in industrialized}} and/or {{urbanized}} coastal shallow waters have reached an alarming and <b>harmful</b> level of <b>contamination</b> {{that requires the}} development of new cost effective technologies. We report on the in situ forced aeration experiment in the Arsenale shipyard dock basin of the Venice Lagoon, Italy. This study follows the promising results obtained by similar experiment carried out in the Industrial Harbor of Marghera, where sediment reworking and mixing are strong. The study site of the Arsenale shipyard was chosen in order to test a new forced aeration system aimed at oxygenating the surficial sediments with a minimum of reworking and mixing. The aeration technique, chosen for the oxygenation of the highly polluted bottom sediments, is unique due to its innovative use of a system of porous pipes laid on the bottom sediments, therefore it is non intrusive and does not obstruct harbor activities. Forced aeration consists in the introduction of a great quantitative of oxygen at the surficial sediment-water column interface with the aim of stimulating aerobic bacterial communities to create an adapt environment for the biodegradation of organic and inorganic pollutants. The general reduction of organic pollutants and heavy metals in the surficial sediments resulted in the documented return of small fish to the area as an indication of a less polluted environment. The experiment has indicated that tangential forced aeration could represent a non intrusive and cost effective way for reducing organic and heavy metal pollutants in coastal environments where other techniques may not be environmentally and/or economically feasible...|$|R
40|$|Worldwide {{increases}} in the frequency and spatial extent of blooms of harmful marine microalgae and heterotrophic dinoflagellates suggest that these species are becoming an increasingly important influence on year class strength of marine fishes through both direct and indirect mechanisms. Impacts on fish populations from harmful marine microalgae and heterotrophic dinoflagellates have been considered primarily from the limited view of acute or lethal influences. Accumulating evidence indicates that insidious sublethal and chronic impacts to both fish and human health from these organisms, such as long-term behavior alteration, increased susceptibility to cancers and other diseases, depressed feeding, and impaired reproduction, may be substantial and pervasive. For some harmful species, significant indirect impacts that promote critical habitat loss or disrupt the microbial food web balance also have been documented. Because successful models to predict the behavior and growth of most of these species {{have not yet been}} developed, and because toxins for many are poorly characterized, a clear anthropocentric focus has guided management strategies for confronting their outbreaks. The extent to which management takes the fundamental step of acknowledging scientifically demonstrated linkages among <b>harmful</b> microalgae, shellfish <b>contamination,</b> fish kills, and human health impacts has also been seriously constrained by political dictates stemming from economic considerations. Without federal involvement, and without catastrophe of human death or widescale serious human illness, little progress historically has been realized in the development of effective management strategies to mitigate lethal impacts to fish or other organisms. Many long-known taxa such as certain "red tide" dinoflagellates apparently can increase independently of human influences other than physical transport. However, some newly discovered toxic or otherwise harmful taxa have been correlated with cultural eutrophication in poorly flushed fish nursery grounds such as estuaries and coastal waters. Outbreaks of certain warm-optimal species have coincided with El Ni (n) over tilde o events, suggesting that warming trends in global climate change may stimulate their growth and extend or shift their range. The available information points to a critical need for a more proactive, concerted effort to determine the full range of chronic/sublethal effects, as well as acute impacts, on marine fish populations by harmful marine microalgae and heterotrophic dinoflagellates, so that their increasingly important influence can be factored into reliable plans for sustainable fisheries management...|$|R
