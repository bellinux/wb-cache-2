5000|$|Built at John Buttera's shop, and {{conceived}} by Buttera and body man Louie Teckenoff, {{the car was}} an unusual magnesium monocoque (rather than the more commonplace tube chassis). The body panels were 0.050 in-thick sheet, <b>fastened</b> <b>with</b> <b>adhesives</b> and over 5,000 rivets; {{the inner and outer}} skins were separated by high-density foam. It had full-enclosed front wheels, cockpit, and engine, with a winglet ahead of the front axle and a low wing, just above the rollbar, in back. (The wings were designed and positioned by Nye Frank.) ...|$|R
5000|$|The word [...] "slip" [...] {{has come}} to be used to refer to a number of other undergarments. In German, French, and Italian the word “slip“ is {{commonly}} used for panties. The term is also sometimes used for the brief style of men's underwear. In the incontinence product market, the word [...] "slip" [...] is often used as a euphemism for an adult diaper or nappy, typically the [...] "all-in-one" [...] style that is worn by <b>fastening</b> on <b>with</b> <b>adhesive</b> tapes, similar to a larger version of the disposable nappies/diapers worn by babies.|$|R
50|$|The {{corrective}} splint is emplaced {{by inserting}} {{it to the}} rim of the gully of the deformed ear, then rolling over the ear-edge onto the splint, and <b>fastening</b> it <b>with</b> <b>adhesive</b> tape. Afterwards, the splinted ear is affixed {{to the side of the}} head <b>with</b> <b>adhesive</b> tape. In the case of ears without a gully, helix (rim), or antihelix (common prominent-ear characteristics), the splint is emplaced slightly away from the ear-edge, which then is rolled onto the splint in order to be shaped into a proper helix (ear rim), and also to facilitate the re-formation of the antihelix. In the case of Stahl’s ear deformity (characterized either by a bulging or a kinked gully), the splint is firmly emplaced upon the defect or deformity, fastened in place, and affixed to the side of the head.|$|R
50|$|Players often play {{multiple}} {{cards for}} each game; 30 {{is not an}} unusual number. Because of {{the large numbers of}} cards played by each player, most halls have the players sit at tables to which they often <b>fasten</b> their cards <b>with</b> <b>adhesive</b> tape. To mark cards faster the players usually use special markers called daubers. At commercial halls, after calling the number the caller then displays the next number on a television monitor; bingo cannot be called until that number is called aloud, however.|$|R
40|$|An {{electrical}} connector and method includes a connector and a conforming element proximate to or {{in contact with}} the mating end of the connector so as to prevent distortion of a matable end. The matable end of the connector may be of a female or male type and may be of a post, tube, blade, pin, or other configuration. An element made of conforming material, for example, an elastomer, epoxy or rubber type material, is configured and positioned {{in contact with the}} matable end of the connector, providing support during assembly to prevent distortion of the matable end. The conforming element may be rectangular, wedge, cylindrical, conical, annular, or of another configuration as required to provide support to the connector pin. The conforming element may be <b>fastened</b> <b>with</b> an <b>adhesive</b> to the matable end to further prevent distortion...|$|R

The fixed elliptical fin keel has an eight percent foil at the root with reduced chord and an extended trailing edge-hull fillet for interference drag reduction, and an eleven percent foil at the tip to help lower the centre of gravity (VCG). A keel / centreboard combination is an option. The D/L ratio ranges from 206 to 231, depending on model. The opening transom of the + and XL model is simple to operate and transforms to a walk through transom / swim platform including an integral folding ladder providing {{easy access to the}} water.

40|$|This {{study is}} a start to {{investigate}} the relationship between micro climate, i. e. the climate at the wood surface, and the wood moisture content. The micro climate {{is affected by the}} construction design; if water gets trapped in joints and stays on wood surfaces, the time during which water is absorbed by the wood increases. To be able to measure moisture content profiles and investigate the relationship between joint design and moisture content, methods for moisture content determination, duration of surface moisture and presence of water in gaps were developed. The moisture content was determined by measuring the electrical conductance between two electrodes inserted in the wood. Unlike the electrodes commonly used for this purpose these electrodes were both small and <b>fastened</b> <b>with</b> electrical conductive <b>adhesive</b> so that the contact between the electrode and the wood remained. The relationship between electrical conductance and moisture content is affected by several wood and experimental variables and calibration experiments were therefore performed. Since the study concerns wood outdoors, the relationship was determined mainly for high moisture contents. Specimens were conditioned to different relative humidity (RH) levels using two different methods. Between 64 % and 95 % RH, saturated salt solutions were used and for high RH levels (98 - 100 %), specimens were conditioned using the pressure plate method. The relationship between conductance and moisture content was obtained for moisture contents between 18 % and 180 %. Since the specimens in the pressure plate experiment were not fully equilibrated, the curve is preliminary. The pressure plate experiment also resulted in a preliminary desorption isotherm between 98 % and 100 % RH. A method for determination of absorption isotherms at high RH levels is also suggested...|$|R
