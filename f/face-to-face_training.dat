40|$|BACKGROUND The {{thought of}} having a surgery can be {{stressful}} for everyone. Providing the necessary information to the patient can help both {{the patient and the}} treatment team. This study was conducted to compare the effectiveness of <b>face-to-face</b> verbal <b>training</b> and educational pamphlets on the readiness of patients for undergoing non-emergency surgeries. MATERIALS AND METHODS The study was a before-after randomized clinical trial. 90 patients scheduled to undergo non-emergency surgery who referred to Shahrekord Ayatollah Kashani Hospital in 2013 were distributed randomly and gradually into two experimental groups (group of <b>face-to-face</b> verbal <b>training</b> and group of educational pamphlet) and one control group. Dependent variable of the study was pre-surgery readiness. Data analysis was carried out by using SPSS statistical software. Statistical analysis were analysis of variance (ANOVA) and correlation test. RESULTS Results showed that the mean scores of pre-surgery readiness in both interventional groups were significantly higher than that in the control group after the intervention (P 0. 05). CONCLUSIONS Each of the methods of face-to-face verbal education and using the pamphlet could be equally effective in improving the readiness of the patients undergoing surgery. Therefore, in environments where the health care providers are facing with the pressure of work and lack of sufficient time for <b>face-to-face</b> verbal <b>training,</b> suitable educational pamphlets can be used to provide the necessary information to patients and prepare them for surgery...|$|R

40|$|I {{tested the}} effects of {{teaching}} imitation using a mirror on the emergence of generalized imitation (GI) of physical movements by children with autism. I first tested if 128 adults, from 19 to 56 years old, emitted mirrored or non-mirrored responses in GI, because {{this had been a}} point of theoretical debate and little data were available. I found that typical adults emitted both mirrored and non-mirrored responses during the GI probe. Accordingly, topographically correct non-mirrored or mirrored responses were considered correct for Experiment Two. In the second experiment, using a combined experimental-control group design with a "nested" non-concurrent multiple probe design across participants, I compared a mirror-trained group (3 children, ages 3 to 4 years olds) and a non-mirror (<b>face-to-face)</b> <b>trained</b> group (3 children, ages 3 to 4 years olds), controlling for the amount of instruction and maturation. The dependent variable was the numbers of correct untaught imitative responses during face-to-face pre and post intervention probe sessions, and the independent variable was the mirror training. The results show that the mirror instruction facilitated in the emergence of GI in all 3 children with autism in the mirror-trained group: their controls that received the same amount of instruction face-to -face did not. I concluded that mirror training resulted in reinforcement of the duplication production and non-mirror training reinforced individual movements...|$|R

40|$|Web-based {{training}} is fast replacing <b>face-to-face</b> <b>training</b> because an online training module can be distributed across an entire organization to increase worker skills without requiring individual sessions or costly scheduling. At the Learning Center at the University of Hawai‘i Maui College, low attendance to training sessions impedes tutor productivity, and consequently lowers {{the quality of}} student support.

40|$|The aim of {{this study}} is to {{investigate}} the effectiveness of problem-based learning (PBL) on students’ mathematical performance. This includes mathematics achievement and students’ attitudes towards mathematics for third and eighth grade students in Saudi Arabia. Mathematics achievement includes, knowing, applying, and reasoning domains, while students’ attitudes towards mathematics covers, ‘Like learning mathematics’, ‘value mathematics’, and ‘a confidence to learn mathematics’. This study goes deeper to examine the interaction of a PBL teaching strategy, with <b>trained</b> <b>face-to-face</b> and self-directed learning teachers, on students’ performance (mathematics achievement and attitudes towards mathematics). It also examines the interaction between different ability levels of students (high and low levels) with a PBL teaching strategy (with <b>trained</b> <b>face-to-face</b> or self-directed learning teachers) on students’ performance. It draws upon findings and techniques of the TIMSS international benchmarking studies. Mixed methods are used to analyse the quasi-experimental study data. One -way ANOVA, Mixed ANOVA, and paired t-tests models are used to analyse quantitative data, while a semi-structured interview with teachers, and author’s observations are used to enrich understanding of PBL and mathematical performance. The findings show that the PBL teaching strategy significantly improves students’ knowledge application, and is better than the traditional teaching methods among third grade students. This improvement, however, occurred only with the <b>trained</b> <b>face-to-face</b> teacher’s group. Furthermore, there is robust evidence that using a PBL teaching strategy could raise significantly students’ liking of learning mathematics, and confidence to learn mathematics, more than traditional teaching methods among third grade students. Howe ver, there was no evidence that PBL could improve students’ performance (mathematics achievement and attitudes towards mathematics), more than traditional teaching methods, among eighth grade students. In 8 th grade, the findings for low achieving students show significant improvement compared to high achieving students, whether PBL is applied or not. However, for 3 th grade students, no significant difference in mathematical achievement between high and low achieving students was found. The results were not expected for high achieving students and this is also discussed. The implications of these findings for mathematics education in Saudi Arabia are considered...|$|R
30|$|The {{differences}} between the three scenarios mentioned in the section of data sources {{are related to the}} parties responsible for pest and disease control, with the local government usually supplying the control techniques through regular training. However, the scallion farmer cooperatives often offer <b>face-to-face</b> field <b>training.</b> Obviously, the efficiency of the latter is higher, and it is more easily accepted by farmers. A simple analysis of the effects of teaching techniques assumes that if the technique is taught by the scallion farmer cooperatives, then the entire farmer group can master the technique. If the training is supplied by the government, farmers whose agriculture practices are generally limited to subsistence farming cannot address their production problems. In addition, to further simplify the analysis, we assume that if there were purchasing contracts between scallion farmer cooperatives and farmers before 2010, these contracts will extend to 2015.|$|R
