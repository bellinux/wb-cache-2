2500|$|In two dimensions, closed disks are compact since for any {{infinite}} number of points sampled from a disk, some subset of those points must get arbitrarily close either to a point within the disc, or to a point on the boundary. [...] However, an open disk is not compact, because a sequence of points can tend to the boundary without getting arbitrarily close to any point in the interior. [...] Likewise, spheres are compact, but a sphere missing a point is not since a sequence of points can tend to the missing point, thereby not getting arbitrarily close to any point within the space. [...] Lines and planes are not compact, since one can take a set of <b>equally-spaced</b> points in any given direction without approaching any point.|$|E

50|$|In the 1880s the {{building}} underwent significant alterations. An addition extended the gallery area {{further to the}} east, and a new roof fully incorporated this space into the structure. Window spacing on this addition was made to match that of the main block, and the new roof was augmented by four <b>equally-spaced</b> gable-roof dormers.

50|$|An 8P8C modular {{connection}} has two paired components: {{the male}} plug {{and the female}} jack, each with eight <b>equally-spaced</b> conductors. On the plug, these conductors are flat contacts positioned parallel with the connector body. Inside the jack, the contacts are suspended diagonally toward the insertion interface. When an 8P8C plug is mated with an 8P8C jack, the contacts meet and create an electrical connection. Spring tension in the jack's contacts ensures a good interface with the plug and allows for slight travel during insertion and removal.|$|E
