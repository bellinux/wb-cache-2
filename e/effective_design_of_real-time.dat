40|$|Networking {{communications}} play {{an important}} role to se-cure a dependable and timely operation of distributed and real-time embedded system applications; however, an effec-tive real-time support is not yet properly addressed in the wireless realm. This paper presents Wi-STARK, a novel architecture for resilient and real-time wireless communi-cations within an one-hop communication domain. Low level reliable (frame) communications, node failure detec-tion, membership management, and networking partition control are provided; since these low level services extend and build upon the exposed interface offered by networking technologies, Wi-STARK is in strict compliance with wire-less communication standards, such as IEEE 802. 15. 4 and IEEE 802. 11 p. The Wi-STARK service interface is then offered as operating system primitives, helpful for building distributed control applications. The one-hop dependabil-ity and timeliness guarantees offered by Wi-STARK are a fundamental step towards an <b>effective</b> <b>design</b> <b>of</b> <b>real-time</b> wireless networks with multiple hops, including end-to-end schedulability analysis of networking operations...|$|E

Real-time architectures Among the most popular AI architectures, the Blackboard model has attracted our attention. Indeed, the main characteristics of Blackboard systems (independence of agents, strong centralized control, event-driven behavior) make them relatively close to classical real-time architectures. However, the <b>design</b> <b>of</b> <b>real-time</b> Blackboard systems usually requires the introduction of concurrent agent execution, which raises {{a number of important}} consistency problems. Aspects such as data access serialization and delays experienced by agents waiting for locked resources become fundamental in such systems.

40|$|The use {{of object}} {{oriented}} techniques and methodologies for the <b>design</b> <b>of</b> <b>real-time</b> control systems {{appear to be}} {{necessary in order to}} deal with the increasing complexity of such systems. Recently many object-oriented methods have been used for the modeling and <b>design</b> <b>of</b> <b>real-time</b> control systems. We believe that an approach that integrates the advancements in both object modeling and design methods, and real-time scheduling theory is the key to successful use of object oriented technology for real-time software. However, past approaches to integrate the two either restrict the object models, or do not allow sophisticated schedulability analysis techniques. In this paper we show how schedulability analysis can be integrated with object-oriented design; we develop the schedulability and feasibility analysis method for the external messages that may suffer release jitter due to being dispatched by a tick driven scheduler in real-time control system, and we also develop the scheduliability method for sporadic activities, where message arrive sporadically then execute periodically for some bounded time. This method can be used to cope with timing constraints in complex real-time control systems...|$|R
