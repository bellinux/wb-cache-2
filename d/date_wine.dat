2500|$|The {{potential}} for {{quality sparkling wine}} has attracted Champagne houses to open up wineries in California. These include Moët et Chandon's Domaine Chandon, Taittinger's Domaine Carneros and Louis Roederer's Roederer Estate. Despite being made with mostly the same grapes and with the same production techniques, California sparkling wines do not {{set out to be}} imitators of Champagne but rather to forge their own distinctive style. Instead of having the [...] "biscuity", yeasty quality that distinguishes most high quality Champagnes, premium California sparkling wines show clarity of fruit flavors without being heavily [...] "fruity". The wines strive for finesse and elegance. The optimal climate condition allows most sparkling wine producers to make a vintage <b>dated</b> <b>wine</b> every year while in Champagne this would only happen in exceptional years.|$|R

40|$|This paper {{examines}} the texts written on shards from wine-jars found at El-Amarna, Tutankhamuns tomb (KV 62) and Deir el-Medina. Information concerning {{the administration of}} wine and its production, found in these texts, is examined. Wine was {{an important element in}} Egyptian society and a common iconographic motif in tombs at Thebes during New Kingdom. A survey on previous research on the subject is presented. This is followed by analysis of the different reoccurring elements found in the texts. A definition of the standard formulation of the wine jar label texts is given and the minimal level of information needed for the administration of wine production and distribution is identified.   The chapter of the analysis deals with the various types of information given in the label texts, such as <b>date,</b> <b>wine</b> classification, and function. The next chapter presents the words associated with the vineyard, the names of the institutions involved in the production and use of wine, and the place names that identify where wine production took place. The following chapter deals with the titles and personal names of the officials involved in wine production. This study shows that these small texts contribute to an understanding of wine production. They also display continuity in form that bridges the turbulence of the Amarna Period. The earlier examples of these texts do not have an ideological component. It is first with the Ramessid Period, and the more intrusive inclusion of the name of the King, that some ideological intent can be identified...|$|E

2500|$|South African {{labelling}} law focuses {{largely on}} geographical origins, falling under {{the purview of}} the Wine of Origin legislation. Single vineyard designated wine can be produced, provided the vineyard is registered with the government and all grapes used in the production of the wine were grown in that vineyard. While the term [...] "estate" [...] no longer qualifies as a designation of geographic origins, wineries can still label [...] "estate wines" [...] provided all the grapes were grown, and the wine was vinified and bottled on the same property. The South African Wine & Spirit Board operates a voluntary programme that allows South African wines to be [...] "certified" [...] for quality and accuracy in labelling. Under this certification process, vintage <b>dated</b> <b>wine</b> must be composed of at least 85% grapes that were harvested that vintage year. Varietal wines must also be composed of at least 85% of the listed varietal. Blends, such as a Cabernet Sauvignon and Pinotage blend, can have both varietals listed on the label provided the two wines were vinified separately. A wine that has been [...] "co-fermented", with both grapes crushed and vinified together such as a Shiraz-Viognier, cannot list both varietals. As of 2006, about 35% of Cape wineries participated in this voluntary programme.|$|R

This technique has thus led to the possibility to <b>date</b> the <b>wine</b> bottles of vintages between 1952 and similar to 1980 and to verify the year written on the label or on the cork.
