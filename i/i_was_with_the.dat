500|$|A {{stopover}} in Bombay, India, {{during the}} band's Australian and Asian tour had led Davies {{to write the}} song [...] "See My Friends", released as a single in July 1965. This was an early example of crossover music, {{and one of the}} first pop songs of the period to display the direct influence of traditional music from the Indian Subcontinent. Davies had written [...] "See My Friends" [...] with a raga feel after hearing the early morning chants of local fishermen. Music historian Jonathan Bellman argues that the song was [...] "extremely influential" [...] on Davies' musical peers: [...] "And while much has been made of the Beatles' 'Norwegian Wood' because it was the first pop record to use a sitar, it was recorded well after the Kinks' clearly Indian 'See My Friends' was released." [...] Pete Townshend of the Who was particularly affected by the song: See My Friends' was the next time I pricked up my ears and thought, 'God, he's done it again. He's invented something new.' It was a European sound rather than an Eastern sound but with a strong, legitimate Eastern influence which had its roots in European folk music." [...] In a widely quoted statement by Barry Fantoni, 1960s celebrity and friend of the Kinks, the Beatles and the Who, he recalled that it was also an influence on The Beatles: [...] "I remember it vividly and still think it's a remarkable pop song. <b>I</b> <b>was</b> <b>with</b> <b>the</b> Beatles the evening that they actually sat around listening to it on a gramophone, saying 'You know this guitar thing sounds like a sitar. We must get one of those. The song's radical departure from popular music conventions proved unpopular with the band's American following—it hit number 11 in the UK, but stalled at number 111 in the US.|$|E
