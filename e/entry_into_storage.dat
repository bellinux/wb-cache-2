40|$|Proteases and {{protease}} inhibitors {{have been}} identified in the ejaculates of animal taxa ranging from invertebrates to mammals and form a major protein class among Drosophila melanogaster seminal fluid proteins (SFPs). Other than a single protease cascade in mammals that regulates seminal clot liquefaction, no proteolytic cascades (i. e. pathways with at least two proteases acting in sequence) {{have been identified}} in seminal fluids. In Drosophila, SFPs are transferred to females during mating and, together with sperm, are necessary for the many post-mating responses elicited in females. Though several SFPs are proteolytically cleaved either during or after mating, virtually nothing is known about the proteases involved in these cleavage events or the physiological consequences of proteolytic activity in the seminal fluid on the female. Here, we present evidence that a protease cascade acts in the seminal fluid of Drosophila during and after mating. Using RNAi to knock down expression of the SFP CG 10586, a predicted serine protease, we show that it acts upstream of the SFP CG 11864, a predicted astacin protease, to process SFPs involved in ovulation and sperm <b>entry</b> <b>into</b> <b>storage.</b> We also show that knockdown of CG 10586 leads to lower levels of egg laying, higher rates of sexual receptivity to subsequent males, and abnormal sperm usage patterns, processes that are independent of CG 11864. The long-term phenotypes of females mated to CG 10586 knockdown males {{are similar to those of}} females that fail to store sex peptide, an important elicitor of long-term post-mating responses, and indicate a role for CG 10586 in regulating sex peptide.

40|$|A {{position}} paper on constraints on informal grain marketing in Zimbabwe faced by rural traders and producers. Observers of Zimbabwean agriculture often express astonishment at {{the absence of}} informal grain markets in the rural areas. 2 Hypotheses abound as to the reasons for this: colonial suppression of local entrepreneurship over many decades, poor rural infrastructure, perceived low effective demand in rural areas and lack of profitability given the pricing and marketing structure of the formal sector. This paper reports {{the results of a}} survey of 124 grain and grain meal traders operating in Zimbabwe’s communal areas. The study examines: o the structure, behavior and performance of the informal grain trade; ° factors constraining investment and <b>entry</b> <b>into</b> grain transport, <b>storage,</b> and processing; 0 the potential of improved informal markets to enhance household food security in the rural areas; and o government strategies to promote the development and performance of informal grain trade.

40|$|The {{importance}} of tissue storage {{as a method}} of inactivation of circulating catechol amines has been assessed by measuring the amount of unchanged hormone remaining in the mouse 30 min after the injection of various doses of [3 H]-adrenaline or [3 H]-noradrenaline. The results show that this method of inactivation is quantitatively more important for noradrenaline than for adrenaline at all dose levels studied, and that for both hormones storage is relatively more important at physiological dose levels (3 to 30 μg/kg) than at higher dose levels (150 to 300 μg/kg). The results obtained after the simultaneous injection of various doses of [3 H]-adrenaline and [14 C]-noradrenaline show that under certain conditions the two hormones compete for <b>entry</b> <b>into</b> the tissue <b>storage</b> sites. The possible nature of the mechanisms by which circulating catechol amines enter the tissue stores is discussed in the light of previous findings on the uptake of catechol amines by tissues in vitro...|$|R
40|$|The DEAD-box RNA helicase Xp 54 is an {{integral}} component of the messenger ribonucleoprotein (mRNP) particles of Xenopus oocytes. In oocytes, several abundant proteins bind pre-mRNA transcripts to modulate nuclear export, RNA stability and translational fate. Of these, Xp 54, the mRNA-masking protein FRGY 2 and its activating protein kinase CK 2 alpha, bind to nascent transcripts on chromosome loops, whereas an Xp 54 -associated factor, RapA/B, binds to the mRNP complex in the cytoplasm. Over-expression, mutation and knockdown experiments indicate that Xp 54 functions to change the conformation of mRNP complexes, displacing one subset of proteins to accommodate another. The sequence of Xp 54 is highly conserved in {{a wide spectrum of}} organisms. Like Xp 54, Drosophila Me 31 B and Caenorhabditis CGH- 1 are required for proper meiotic development, apparently by regulating the translational activation of stored mRNPs and also for sorting certain mRNPs into germ plasm-containing structures. Studies on yeast Dhh 1 and mammalian rck/p 54 have revealed a key role for these helicases in mRNA degradation and in earlier remodelling of mRNP for <b>entry</b> <b>into</b> translation, <b>storage</b> or decay pathways. The versatility of Xp 54 and related helicases in modulating the metabolism of mRNAs at all stages of their lifetimes marks them out as key regulators of post-transcriptional gene expression.

40|$|An {{abandoned}} {{animal feeding}} facility {{is a significant}} threat to the environment. Procedures {{to minimize the risk}} are discussed. Feedlot abandonment occurs for various reasons, including economic and social changes, environmental concerns, consolidation for more cost effective management and operation, and modification of personal goals. Whether a feedlot is abandoned for a short time until some crisis passes, or permanently, steps are necessary to minimize the risk of environmental degradation. Under both scenarios, an abandoned feedlot poses an immediate threat to surface and groundwater quality. The unused facility is also a potential nuisance and source of health problems for humans and animals. The purpose of this NebGuide is to identify guidelines that will minimize environmental risk associated with feedlot abandonment. No matter how long the period of non-use is expected to be, manure should be removed to minimize transport of manure from the site via runoff and the risk of groundwater pollution. In all instances the risk of accidental <b>entry</b> <b>into</b> manure <b>storages</b> and holding ponds by animals and people must be minimized. Abandonment for periods exceeding one to two months during spring, summer or fall requires steps to control weeds and insects. Abandonment during any time of year dictates a need for rodent control in pens, feeding areas, and around feed storage facilities. With long-term or permanent abandonment, the challenge is to return the lot area to productive crop growth in the shortest feasible time...|$|R

Many studies {{have been carried out}} to understand the mechanisms implicated in such bioreactions, and a pathway involving peroxisomal β-oxidation was established but some unelucidated points remain.

40|$|AbstractADP-glucose pyrophosphorylase (AGPase) is the allosterically {{regulated}} gateway {{for carbon}} <b>entry</b> <b>into</b> transient and <b>storage</b> starch in plants {{as well as}} glycogen in bacteria. This enzyme {{plays a key role}} in the modulation of photosynthetic efficiency in source tissues and directly determines the level of storage starch in sink tissues, thus influencing overall crop yield potential. AGPase is a tetrameric enzyme; in higher plants it consists of two regulatory large subunits (LS) and two catalytic small subunits (SS), while in cyanobacteria and prokaryotes the enzyme is homotetrameric. The potato SS gene in pML 10 was mutated by hydroxylamine and mutants were screened for elevated homotetrameric activity by iodine vapor staining. This search strategy led to the isolation of SS mutants (SUP- 1, TG- 15) that had pyrophosphorylase activity in the absence of the LS. TG- 15 has a leucine to phenylalanine change at position 48 (L 48 F) that corresponds to a phenylalanine residue at the analogous position in the Escherichia coli homotetrameric AGPase as well as a valine to isoleucine change at position 59 (V 59 I). TG- 15 was partially purified and kinetic analysis revealed substrate and effector affinities equal to wild type heterotetrameric enzyme with the exception of ATP binding...|$|R

To address this, we used a β-galactosidase reporter virus to monitor virus <b>entry</b> <b>into</b> multiple cell types under varying conditions. <b>Entry</b> <b>into</b> HeLa, B 78 H 1 and L cells was strongly inhibited by heparin whereas <b>entry</b> <b>into</b> Vero and BSC- 1 cells was unaffected.

Finally, <b>entry</b> <b>into</b> HeLa, B 78 H 1, L and BSC- 1 cells exhibited a lag of 6 – 9  min whereas this delay was undetectable in Vero cells.
