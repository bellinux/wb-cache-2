However, relatively few studies on the particular spindle vibration under the excitation of <b>intermittent</b> <b>cutting</b> forces in ultra-precision raster milling (UPRM) have been reported. In this study, a specialized model for an aerostatic bearing spindle under the impulsive excitation from <b>intermittent</b> <b>cutting</b> forces of UPRM is developed and its derived mathematical solutions reveal that the spindle vibration is impulsive response. The theoretical and experimental results signify that the impulsive spindle vibration produces inhomogeneous scallops forming ribbon-stripe patterns and irregular patterns like run-out on a surface of UPRM. The potential benefits for UPRM are the theoretical supports for optimization and prediction of surface generation through the optimal selection of spindle speed.

The process offers the high flexibility necessary for fabricating freeform, micro/nano-structural surfaces, as well as hybrid structural surfaces with sub-micrometric form error and nanometric surface roughness, and its constant cutting velocity provides uniform high surface quality. However, {{in addition to its}} low machining efficiency, UPFC's <b>intermittent</b> <b>cutting</b> process results in distinctive surface generation mechanisms, covering intermittent tool-workpiece relative motion, tool geometry imprinted into a machined surface, and surface material separation and deformation.

40|$|Tool failure {{remains one}} of the most {{challenging}} phenomena in machining that affects the productivity and product quality, and hence the cost. In high feed rough milling operations of hard-to-cut materials, chipping and breakage have been observed as the dominant failure modes of the end mill cutters. Most of the work in the open literature is focusing on either detecting the complete tool breakage after it takes place or detecting the progressive tool wear. Detecting the abrupt/sudden tool failure due to tool chipping before it takes place, which is essential to avoid any damage to the machined part, has not been addressed.

40|$|Although the {{occurrence}} of tool wear can affect cutting forces, cutting chip morphologies, and machined surface quality in ultra-precision fly cutting (UPFC), {{there has been no}} research in this area due to the complex cutting mechanism of UPFC. The theoretical and experimental research described in this paper was therefore conducted to explore tool wear characteristics in UPFC and their relationship to cutting forces, cutting chip morphologies, and machined surface quality. Results from the study reveal that tool wear characteristics in UPFC include cutting edge fractures, workpiece material welding, wear land formation, sub-wear land formation, and micro-grooves. The cutting edge fractures lead to the formation of ridges on both the cutting chips and machined surface; the material welding increases the thrust force, crushes cutting chips, and deteriorates the machined surface quality; and the formation of wear land on the cutting edge makes the machined surface burred and fuzzy, and the micro-grooves leave some traces on the machined surface. By analyzing the captured cutting force, it is found that the progress of tool wear in UPFC can increase the cutting force and its power spectral density at the natural frequency of the dynamometer.

The ball radius of the carbide cutter is 3 mm and the side cutting of carbon steel with ballnose is executed without cutting fluid. Cutting temperature distribution along the ball-nosed cutting-edge is measured. The influences of spindle rotational speed, radial depth of cut and feed per tooth on the temperature distribution at the flank face are examined. The maximum temperature of peripheral cutting edge about 700 °C is obtained even at the rotation angle of 180 ° after cutting, and it drops along the ballnose toward the ball tip. Relatively large temperature gradient arises along the ball cutting-edge at higher spindle revolution because cutting speed depends on the local tool radius.

Optimum selection of cutting conditions in VAD operations of composite materials is a challenging task due to several reasons; such as {{the increase in the number}} of controllable variables, the need for costly experimentation, and the limitation on the number of experiments that can be performed before tool degradation becomes an issue in the reliability of measurements. Additionally, there are often several objectives to consider, some of which may be conflicting, while others may be somewhat correlated. Pareto-optimality analysis is needed for conflicting objectives; however the existence of several objectives (high-dimension Pareto space) makes the generation and interpretation of Pareto solutions difficult. An attractive approach to the optimization task is thus to employ Kriging meta-models in a multi-objective efficient global optimization (m-EGO) framework for incremental experimentation of optimal setting of the cutting parameters. Additional challenge posed by constraints on machine capabilities is accounted for through domain transformation of the design variables prior to the construction of the Kriging models.

40|$|In {{vibration}} assisted drilling (VAD), {{a controlled}} harmonic motion is superimposed over the principal drilling feed motion {{in order to}} create an <b>intermittent</b> <b>cutting</b> state, which reduces cutting forces and temperatures, facilitates chip removal, and increases the possibility for dry machining. However, accurate force measurements during VAD operations has been a challenge especially in systems, where the force transducer is part of the vibrating mass mounted on the shaker head, due to the dynamic force errors. Conventional signal filtering and compensation techniques were found to be not applicable for attenuating undesirable VAD dynamic force components, which exist in the measured force signals at the same frequency of superimposed modulation. This research work presents a corrective dynamic model that rectifies the erroneous VAD tangential and axial force signals measured by a commercial piezoelectric dynamometer mounted on electro-magnetic shakers for the low frequency/high amplitude (LF/HA) regime. An experimental modal analysis in tangential and axial directions was conducted in order to define the transfer function of a multiple degrees of freedom VAD system mounted on a vibrating base (shaker). The rectified force is then obtained by plugging the relative motion between the dynamometer base and face measured during cutting into the system transfer function. The predicted rectified force components showed very high conformance with known impact and sinusoidal excitation forces used for validation. Moreover, the developed corrective model was capable of predicting some features in the VAD force signals that were not fully captured in the measured force signals during cutting.

Adults comprised nearly 61 % of the total individuals, followed by infants 16 %, juveniles 13 % and sub-adults 10 %. While the proportion in the adult age class had decreased from 67 % in 1985 - 87, the proportion of individuals in all other age classes showed slight increase. The sex ratio of males: females was 1 : 1 for adults as well as sub-adults, which was the same as in 1985 - 87 survey. The modal group size was three (44 % of groups) as before. However, the next frequent group size was four (28 % of groups), whereas previously the second most frequent group size was two (30 % of groups). Twenty percent of groups had two individuals and 8 % of groups comprised of five individuals.

The major reasons of their decline are anthropogenic disturbances such as tree felling for domestic and commercial uses; <b>intermittent</b> <b>cutting</b> of new forest patches for fresh jhum cultivation, often resulting into canopy gaps as well as habitat loss; livestock grazing and poaching...|$|E
40|$|AbstractThere {{has been}} a great advance in the {{grinding}} process by the development of dressing, lubri-refrigeration and other methods. Nevertheless, all of these advances were gained only for continuous cutting; in other words, the ground workpiece profile remains unchanged. Hence, it becomes necessary to study grinding process using <b>intermittent</b> <b>cutting</b> (grooved workpiece &# 8211; discontinuous cutting), as little or no knowledge and studies have been developed for this purpose, since there is nothing found in formal literature, except for grooved grinding wheels. During the grinding process, heat generated in the cutting zone is extremely high. Therefore, plenty of cutting fluids are essential to cool not only the workpiece but also the grinding wheel, improving the grinding process. In this paper, grinding trials were performed using a conventional aluminum oxide grinding wheel, testing samples made of AISI 4340 steel quenched and tempered with 2, 6, and 12 grooves. The cylindrical plunge grinding was performed by rotating the workpiece on the grinding wheel. This plunge movement was made at three different speeds. From the obtained results, it can be observed that roughness tended to increase for testing sample with the same number of grooves, as rotation speed increased. Roundness error also tended to increase as the speed rotation process got higher for testing the sample with the same number of grooves. Grinding wheel wear enhanced as rotation speed and number of grooves increased. Power consumed by the grinding machine was inversely proportional to the number of grooves. Subsuperficial microhardness had no significant change. Micrographs reveal an optimal machining operation as there was no significant damage on the machined surface...|$|E
40|$|Abstract. In {{metal cutting}} process, {{the use of}} cutting fluids, cooling and easy chip removal causes {{long-term}} effects of cutting fluids disposal into environment. Research has also proven the health hazards on manufacturing workers who coming {{in direct contact with}} cutting fluids. Currently it is highly competitive or end-user of metal workings fluid to reduce cost and improve productivity. Considering the high cost and problems associated with health and safety, it would be desirable if the use of cutting fluids be omitted. This study investigates the flank wear behavior of coated Titanium Carbonitride (TiCN) coated tools in dry and wet machining of T 6061 Aluminum alloy with the aim of obtaining the optimum cutting speed for dry and wet machining respectively. By using specific depths of cut 0. 2 and 0. 6 mm with feed rates of 0. 4 and 0. 8 mm/rev respectively, the wear was investigated for 3 different high cutting speeds; 290, 360 and 446 mm/min. Results of dry machining was compared with traditional wet machining process. The temperature of tool tip, machining time and tool wear were recorded. Wear rate of the tool increases with the increasing cutting speed and parameters for both dry and wet machining. Wear percentage difference for dry machining was found to be 21 - 37 % (d = 0. 2 mm and f = 0. 4 mm/rev) and 41 - 58 % (d = 0. 6 mm and f = 0. 8 mm/rev) higher than wet machining. The optimum cutting speed for both cutting parameters is 446 m/min for dry and wet machining. Tool tip temperature for dry machining is found to be 14 - 16 % higher than wet machining for both cutting parameters. It is observed that dry machining is suitable for high speed <b>intermittent</b> <b>cutting</b> operations...|$|E
40|$|Virtual {{testing of}} portal machine tool {{has been carried}} out with the help of finite {{elements}} method (FEM). Static, modal and harmonic analyses have been made for a heavy planer. The paper reveals influence of concrete filler on machine tool dynamic flexibility. A peculiar feature of the simulation is concrete filling of a high-level transverse beam. Such approach oes look a typical one for machine-tool industry. Concrete has been considered as generalized material in two variants. It has been established that concrete application provides approximately 3 -fold increase in machine tool rigidity per each coordinate. In this regard it is necessary to arrange closure of rigidity contour by filling all the cavities inside of the portal. Modal FEA makes it possible to determine that concrete increases comparatively weakly (1. 3 – 1. 4 -fold) frequencies of resonance modes. Frequency of the lowest mode rises only from 30. 25 to 42. 86 Hz. The following most active whole-machine eigenmodes have been revealed in the paper: “Portal pecking”, “Parallelogram” and “Traverse pecking”. In order to restrain the last mode it is necessary to carry out concrete filling of the traverse, in particular. Frequency-response characteristics and curves of dynamic rigidity for a spindle have been plotted for 0 – 150 Hz interval while using harmonic FEM. It has been determined that concrete increases dynamic machine tool rigidity by 2. 5 – 3. 5 -fold. The effect is obtained even in the case when weakly damping concrete (2 %) is used. This is due to distribution of vibrational energy flow along concrete and along cast iron as well. Thus energy density and vibration amplitudes must decrease. The paper shows acceptability for internal reinforcement of high-level machine tool parts (for example, portal traverses) and fillers are applied for this purpose. Traverse weighting is compensated by additional torsional, shear and bending rigidity. The machine tool obtains the possibility for rough <b>intermittent</b> <b>cutting</b> even at resonance frequencies. Complete concrete filling of portal cavities is definitely a positive action for static and dynamic properties of the machine tool. </p...|$|E
