5000|$|Operative {{temperature}} (...) , {{also known}} as Dry resultant temperature, or Resultant temperature, {{is defined as a}} uniform temperature of a imaginary black enclosure in which an occupant would exchange the same amount of heat by radiation plus convection as in the actual nonuniform environment. Some references also use the terms 'equivalent temperature" [...] or 'effective temperature' to describe combined effects of convective and radiant heat transfer. In design, operative temperature can be defined as the average of the mean radiant and ambient air temperatures, weighted by their respective heat transfer coefficients. The instrument used for assessing environmental thermal comfort in terms of operative temperature is called a <b>eupatheoscope</b> and was invented by A. F. Dufton in 1929. Mathematically, operative temperature can be shown as; ...|$|E
