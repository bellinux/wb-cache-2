40|$|AbstractCharging cost of {{electric}} vehicles {{depends on the}} selection of the charging strategy when operating ina spatio-temporal electricity pricing market. In such scenario, selection of the charging strategy can be critical {{in order to keep the}} charging cost minimum. Furthermore, a coordination of charging strategies is required to prevent the <b>electric</b> grid from <b>overloading</b> during peak demand periods. Hence, a cost optimization model is implementedfor individual travelers in a coordinated context. Individuals minimize their cost and are constrained by power delivery constraints in space and time. The charging strategy optimization applies to the scenario where the electric energy price varies with time and location. When all trips are fixed in time, interesting low cost charging time slots may be unavailable to a particular individual. Hence, in order to charge at such cheap moments, a shift in traveling moments is proposed in this work. Furthermore, a comparison between cost savings and the requiredagenda adaptations also is discussed in the paper...|$|R

Indeed, by knowing in advance of localized anger for icing <b>overloads,</b> <b>electric</b> utilities can take measures in time to prevent generalized failure of the power transmission network.

There he encounters Elsa who explains {{that she was the}} wife and scientific partner of Dr. Harcourt and that the humanoid monster is in fact her young son whose original body had been irreparably damaged by an accident for which Dr. Harcourt was responsible. She had put the boy's brain in this monstrous body to preserve it and now needs Wilson's orb as a new power source for the body and the book to perform a procedure which will install the orb in the boy-monster's body. While she is preparing the procedure, Kurt sneaks into the laboratory and tries to free Wilson, but he is prevented from doing so by the full moon which appears in the window and transforms him into his werewolf form, where he is attacked by the boy-monster. While the two are fighting, Bela sneaks in and tries to free Wilson, just when Lucy in vampire-form flies in. The boy-monster defeats and incapacitates Kurt in werewolf-form and then fights with Lucy, who in turn defeats and incapacitates the monster, just when Bela manages to free Wilson. Wilson manages to stake and kill Lucy before she can bite him. He then manages to reach the book and burn it, just when the boy-monster wakes up.

40|$|Microgrids are {{independent}} micro electric systems {{made up of}} locally controlled systems that can function both connected to the main grid (on-grid mode) or isolated from the main grid (off-grid or islanded mode). CIGRE defines Microgrids as “electricity distribution systems containing loads and distributed energy resources, (such as distributed generators, storage devices, or controllable loads) that can be operated in a controlled, coordinated way either while connected to the main power network or while islanded. ” As described by the IEEE Standards Coordinating Committee, microgrids have the ability to: (1) improve electrical reliability for customers; (2) relieve <b>electric</b> power system <b>overload</b> problems, in particular for highly congested power systems; and (3) resolve power quality issues. Most of the advantages offered by microgrids heavily rely on their predisposition to operate in isolated, independent mode. However, microgrids in islanded mode present technical operating challenges {{that need to be}} thoroughly investigated. A microgrid must be able to independently meet the active and reactive power requirements of its assigned loads. In addition, it must also actively regulate voltage and frequency within a safe operating range in order to ensure system stability. Investigating the technical challenges of islanded microgrids requires appropriate modeling tools. As is the case for high voltage (HV) power systems, the reliability of an isolated microgrid starts with a thorough investigation of its behaviour under various steady-state conditions and a derivation of the steady-state voltage profiles and transmission line loading levels throughout the system. The present thesis investigates the steady-state analysis of islanded microgrid systems. To that end, an algorithm is developed using MATLAB to solve positive sequence (i. e., balanced) load-flow problems associated with isolated microgrids (IMGs). The proposed algorithm takes into account the specificities of IMGs and therefore yields more accurate results than those obtained with a conventional load flow algorithm. Compared to a conventional load flow algorithm, the algorithm that is most suitable for IMG has the following salient features: (1) no slack bus capable of supplying/absorbing the deficit/excess active and reactive power, (2) variable system frequency, and (3) part of, if not all, DG units operated in droop-control mode, which means that their active and reactive power outputs are not pre-specified, but are rather dependent on load flow variables (i. e., system frequency and bus voltages, respectively) at a given time...|$|R
40|$|Due to {{the recent}} inflow of Electric Vehicles (EVs) to the {{automobile}} market, new concerns have risen {{with respect to the}} additional electrical load and the resultant effects on an <b>overloaded</b> <b>electric</b> grid. Either for convenience purposes or possibly necessity due to limited electric range on EVs, some EV owners may desire to charge their EV while at work in addition to charging at home. These forward-thinking daytime charging providers are typically Commercial and Industrial (C 2 ̆ 6 I) electric ratepayers, or other large electric consumers which constitute the majority of businesses, shopping centers, academic campuses and manufacturing facilities. Increased electricity consumption due to EV charging activity results in higher electricity costs due to differences in the billing structures between residential and C 2 ̆ 6 I electric ratepayers. Therefore, it is beneficial to the EVSE charging provider to minimize charging activity around peak demand periods which would result in lower electrical costs overall. A solution is developed that can provide this control without creating a nuisance to electric vehicle owners since EV charging demand is somewhat inelastic due to range anxiety. The primary objective of the research detailed in this dissertation is to develop a novel demand side management system for monitoring the peak demand of commercial time-of-day electric ratepayers that cost effectively predicts and controls electric vehicle charging during peak demand periods. This objective is achieved, therefore confirming the hypothesis that such a system can provide cost and demand benefits to forward-thinking commercial electric ratepayers that provide daytime charging capabilities. This work proposes and evaluates a novel Power Monitoring and Control System (PMCS) that can be implemented at C 2 ̆ 6 I EV charging locations to minimize or eliminate the negative impacts of charging electric vehicles at the workplace in C 2 ̆ 6 I environments. Operation of the PMCS begins by forecasting electrical demand in advance of every 15 minute demand interval throughout the day. The forecast is generated using an artificial neural network and a number of input data streams. Electrical demand has been shown to correlate well with weather data such as temperature and dew point. Therefore, using those measurements along with a date and time stamp, and historical electrical demand measurements, a highly accurate forecast for the following 15 -minute demand interval was achieved. From that forecast, the number of EV charging stations that may be active, without the chance of creating new electrical demand peaks, is calculated. Finally, the forecast is then used to properly schedule EV charging activity so that electrical demand peaks can be avoided but charging activity is maximized. The avoidance of charging activity at or near peaks in electrical demand results in lower total electric costs associated with the charging process. The final design was implemented in an EV charging testbed at the University of Louisville and data was collected to verify the operation and performance of the PMCS. With a properly designed scheduling and prioritization control algorithm, increases in electrical demand and associated costs are limited to the error in the forecasting algorithm used for predicting electrical demand levels. The final design of the forecasting algorithm results in a mean absolute percent error of 0. 02...|$|R
40|$|Driven by technical, {{economic}} and environmental benefits for different stakeholders in the power industry, the electric distribution system is currently undergoing a major paradigm shift towards having an increasing portion of its growing demand supplied via distributed generation (DG) units. As the number of DG units increase; microgrids can be defined within the electric distribution system as electric regions with enough generation to meet {{all or most of}} its local demand. A microgrid should be able to operate in two modes, grid-connected or islanded. The IEEE standard 1547. 4 enumerates a list of potential benefits for the islanded microgrid operation. Such benefits include: 1) improving customers’ reliability, 2) relieving <b>electric</b> power system <b>overload</b> problems, 3) resolving power quality issues, and 4) allowing for maintenance of the different power system components without interrupting customers. These benefits motivate the operation of microgrid systems in the islanded mode. However the microgrid isolation from the main grid creates special technical challenges that have to be comprehensively investigated in order to facilitate a successful implementation of the islanded microgrid concept. Motivated by these facts, the target of this thesis is to introduce new analysis and operational control algorithms to tackle some of the challenges associated with the practical implementation of the islanded microgrid concept. In order to accomplish this target, this study is divided into four perspectives: 1) developing an accurate steady-state analysis algorithm for islanded microgrid systems, 2) maximizing the possible utilization of islanded microgrid limited generation resources, 3) allowing for the decentralized operation of islanded microgrid systems and 4) enabling the islanded microgrid operation in distribution systems with high penetration of plug-in electric vehicles (PEVs). First for the steady-state analysis of islanded microgrid systems, a novel and generalized algorithm is proposed to provide accurate power flow analysis of islanded microgrid systems. Conventional power flow tools found in the literature are generally not suitable for the islanded microgrid operating mode. The reason is that none of these tools reflect the islanded microgrid special philosophy of operation {{in the absence of the}} utility bus. The proposed algorithm adopts the real characteristics of the islanded microgrid operation; i. e., 1) Some of the DG units are controlled using droop control methods and their generated active and reactive power are dependent on the power flow variables and cannot be pre-specified; 2) The steady-state system frequency is not constant and is considered as one of the power flow variables. The proposed algorithm is generic, where the features of distribution systems i. e. three-phase feeder models, unbalanced loads and load models have been taken in consideration. The effectiveness of the proposed algorithm, in providing accurate steady-state analysis of islanded microgrid systems, is demonstrated through several case studies. Secondly, this thesis proposes the consideration of a system maximum loadability criterion in the optimal power flow (OPF) problem of islanded microgrid systems. Such consideration allows for an increased utilization of the islanded microgrid limited generation resources when in isolation from the utility grid. Three OPF problem formulations for islanded microgrids are proposed; 1) The OPF problem for maximum loadability assessment, 2) The OPF for maximizing the system loadability, and 3) The bi-objective OPF problem for loadability maximization and generation cost minimization. An algorithm to achieve a best compromise solution between system maximum loadability and minimum generation costs is also proposed. A detailed islanded microgrid model is adopted to reflect the islanded microgrid special features and real operational characteristics in the proposed OPF problem formulations. The importance and consequences of considering the system maximum loadability in the operational planning of islanded microgrid systems are demonstrated through comparative numerical studies. Next, a new probabilistic algorithm for enabling the decentralized operation of islanded microgrids, including renewable resources, in the absence of a microgrid central controller (MGCC) is proposed. The proposed algorithm adopts a constraint hierarchy approach to enhance the operation of islanded microgrids by satisfying the system’s operational constraints and expanding its loading margin. The new algorithm takes into consideration the variety of possible islanded microgrid configurations that can be initiated in a distribution network (multi-microgrids), the uncertainty and variability associated with the output power of renewable DG units as well as the variability of the load, and the special operational philosophy associated with islanded microgrid systems. Simulation studies show that the proposed algorithm can facilitate the successful implementation of the islanded microgrid concept by reducing customer interruptions and enhancing the islanded microgrid loadability margins. Finally, this research proposes a new multi-stage control scheme to enable the islanded microgrid operation in the presence of high PEVs penetration. The proposed control scheme optimally coordinates the DG units operation, the shedding of islanded microgrid power demand (during inadequate generation periods) and the PEVs charging/discharging decisions. To this end, a three-stage control scheme is formulated in order to: 1) minimize the load shedding, 2) satisfy the PEVs customers’ requirements and 3) minimize the microgrid cost of operation. The proposed control scheme takes into consideration; the variability associated with the output power of renewable DG units, the random behaviour of PEV charging and the special features of islanded microgrid systems. The simulation studies show that the proposed control scheme can enhance the operation of islanded microgrid systems in the presence of high PEVs penetration and facilitate a successful implementation of the islanded microgrid concept, under the smart grid paradigm...|$|R
