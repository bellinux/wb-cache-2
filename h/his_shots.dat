5|$|When {{profiling}} Kane in February 2013, Talksport {{said that}} he was best as a second striker, despite also having ability as a centre forward or in a wide position. They wrote that he preferred to place <b>his</b> <b>shots,</b> although he could also score from distance. The report also noted that he had good pace, but was weak in the air and had not scored on his loan at Norwich. Initially a back-up to £26million Spanish import Roberto Soldado and frequently loaned out, Kane was eventually made Tottenham's starting forward by manager Mauricio Pochettino.|$|E
5|$|With {{the switch}} to a bigger 97 inch racket from 90 inches, Federer has gained easy power while relinquishing some control on <b>his</b> <b>shots.</b> The bigger racket has enabled easier serving and better defense on both wings with less shanks. However this has diminished his forehand, slice backhand and dropshot. Since his {{comeback}} in 2017, Federer is noted for his improved backhand both down the line and cross court which was cited {{as the reason for}} his defeat of Nadal in the 2017 Australian Open Final and Indian Wells 4th Round.|$|E

5|$|As a sophomore, Middleton led {{the team}} and {{finished}} ninth in the Big 12 in scoring at 14.3 points per game while also contributing 5.2 rebounds per game. He hit 45 percent of <b>his</b> <b>shots</b> {{from the floor and}} 78.4 percent of his free throws. Middleton scored in excess of 10 points in 27 games and {{led the team}} in scoring 16 times. He scored a career-high 31 points in a 71-62 overtime victory over Arkansas, including 11 of the team's las 12 points in regulation. This earned him Big 12 Player of the Week and Oscar Robertson National Player of the Week honors for the week of December 13–19, 2010. On January 15, 2011, Middleton tallied 28 points, including 11 in overtime, to defeat Missouri 91-89.|$|E
5|$|During {{the course}} of the trilogy, Sparrow {{undergoes}} physical transformations. In The Curse of the Black Pearl, Sparrow curses himself to battle the undead Barbossa. Like all the actors playing the Black Pearl crew, Depp had to shoot scenes in costume as a reference for the animators, and <b>his</b> <b>shots</b> as a skeleton were shot again without him. Depp reprised the scene again on a motion capture stage. In At World's End, Sparrow hallucinates a version of himself as a member of Davy Jones's crew, adhered to a wall and encrusted with barnacles. Verbinski oversaw that the design retained Sparrow's distinctive look, and rejected initial designs which portrayed him as over 100 years old.|$|E
5|$|Playing in {{the final}} year of his contract, Glencross set {{personal}} highs of 24goals and 43points in 2010–11. While the Flames received offers from other teams for Glencross at the trade deadline, the team chose to hold on to him though they risked losing him as an unrestricted free agent following the season. Glencross chose to remain in Calgary, agreeing to a four-year, $10.2million contract with the Flames on May 17, 2011. Glencross felt that he could have earned a bigger contract on the open market, but chose to take less money to remain in Calgary. With 26 goals in 2011–12, Glencross finished second on the team to Jarome Iginla's 32. He was the league's most efficient scorer, scoring on 23.6 percent of <b>his</b> <b>shots</b> on net.|$|E

5|$|The Czechs won {{the first}} match of the 2006 World Cup with 3–0 against the United States, but key players were injured. They then lost their next two group matches against Ghana and {{eventual}} winners Italy, finishing third in their group. Nedvěd's apparent goal {{at the beginning of}} the second half in the match against Ghana was ruled offside. <b>His</b> <b>shots</b> on goal against Italy were saved by Juventus teammate Gianluigi Buffon. Nedvěd again announced his retirement from the international scene before the August 2006 friendly match against Serbia and Montenegro, in which he made his 91st (and final) appearance. He refused to reverse his decision before Euro 2008, despite requests from teammates and Brückner. In the 91 appearances he made for his national side, Nedvěd scored 18 goals.|$|E
5|$|Often {{considered}} by commentators {{to be the}} benchmark against which other batsmen are compared for attractive, graceful batting, Palairet won many plaudits for his style. In his book, The Jubilee Book of Cricket, Ranjitsinhji includes a number of staged photographs of Palairet playing <b>his</b> <b>shots,</b> and describes his methods in places, using them as the model which young players should adopt. He played predominantly off the front foot, and tended to be less effective on soft pitches. He favoured shots on the off side, particularly the off drive and cover drive. During Palairet's career, bowlers favoured a tactic, known as off theory, of bowling the ball just outside the off stump. The strength of Palairet's off side strokes helped him to score effectively against this tactic. Fry suggests that the early practice that Palairet gained against Attewell and Martin, who bowled accurately at the stumps, was {{a key factor in}} limiting his range of leg side shots. He favoured lofted shots which were often compared to golf strokes.|$|E
5|$|Yao {{first tried}} {{out for the}} Shanghai Sharks junior team of the Chinese Basketball Association (CBA) when he was {{thirteen}} years old, and practiced ten {{hours a day for}} his acceptance. After playing with the junior team for four years, Yao joined the senior team of the Sharks, where he averaged 10points and 8rebounds a game in his rookie season. His next season was cut short when he broke his foot {{for the second time in}} his career, which Yao said decreased his jumping ability by four to six inches (10 to 15cm). The Sharks made the finals of the CBA in Yao's third season and again the next year, but lost both times to the Bayi Rockets. When Wang Zhizhi left the Bayi Rockets to become the first NBA player from China the following year, the Sharks finally won their first CBA championship. During the playoffs in his final year with Shanghai, Yao averaged 38.9points and 20.2rebounds a game, while shooting 76.6% from the field, and made all 21 of <b>his</b> <b>shots</b> during one game in the finals.|$|E

5|$|North Carolina's first {{possession}} of the second overtime period ended with a turnover, while Kansas missed a long jump shot in theirs. North Carolina's Brennan boxed out Chamberlain who went over Brennan to collect the rebound and was called for over the back. Joe Quigg turned the ball over after traveling, while Chamberlain threw {{the ball out of}} bounds on the subsequent possession. Carolina failed to capitalize on Chamberlain's error when Kearns missed the front end of a one–and–one. Kansas came down the court and passed the ball to Chamberlain who was then fouled hard by Cunningham. This sparked an altercation between the two teams, which resulted in Chamberlain being hit in the stomach with a megaphone and his knee being scarred by a Carolina cheerleader. The referees stopped the commotion and Chamberlain was sent to the line, where he missed <b>his</b> <b>shots,</b> and Carolina got the rebound. The Tar Heels aimed to hold the ball for a final shot but they turned the ball over to Kansas with ten seconds to go and the Jayhawks called a timeout with six seconds left. The ball went to Kansas' Loneski who missed a shot and the game remained tied at 48.|$|E
5|$|Upon the resumption, Crapp {{began to}} accelerate, hitting a six—which flew {{directly}} {{back over the}} bowler's head and over the sightscreen—and three driven boundaries from the off spin of Ian Johnson. This was {{a stark contrast to}} Johnson's first ten overs before lunch, which had yielded only seven runs. Crapp was eager to use his feet to get to the pitch of Johnson's deliveries, and subsequently dealt with the spin fairly comfortably, whereas many of his compatriots stood in their crease and found matters much more difficult. He then hit Toshack to Barnes at short leg, but the catch was dropped. However, Crapp did not capitalise as Toshack conceded only eight runs in a sequence of eight overs. Australia took the new ball with the score at 87 and Lindwall trapped Crapp—who did not offer a shot—leg before wicket for 37; the batsman misjudged the line of a straight ball and thought it had pitched and struck his leg outside off stump. Tom Dollery came in and took a single to get off the mark but then missed a Johnston yorker and was bowled. This dismissal mirrored that of Washbrook's in that Dollery failed to detect Johnston's variation ball, and thus played for swing when there was none. England had lost two wickets for one run to be 97/4. Captain Norman Yardley came in and played the fast bowling of Lindwall and Johnston with relative ease, retreating onto the back foot to allow himself more time to play <b>his</b> <b>shots.</b> Edrich was struck on the hand and Yardley edged to Keith Miller in the slips cordon on the half-volley.|$|E

50|$|Early in {{the match}} Kilmarnock defender Mahamadou Sissoko's pass across the penalty area was intercepted by Gary Hooper. However, <b>his</b> <b>shot</b> was saved by goalkeeper Cammy Bell who came off his line quickly. Shortly after Dean Shiels shot {{narrowly}} wide {{from the edge}} of the area. Around 30 minutes in Scott Brown made room for himself on the right before crossing for Anthony Stokes whose header was saved by Bell. Shiels had another chance but <b>his</b> <b>shot</b> was saved by Fraser Forster. From the resulting corner Sissoko's header was cleared off the line by Stokes. Bell made another save when he tipped Brown's powerful shot from outside the box over the bar.
