50|$|Resporal is {{the brand}} name for an oral, long-acting antihistamine/decongestant {{composed}} of <b>dexbrompheniramine</b> and pseudoephedrine. Alternative brand names include Disophrol.|$|E
50|$|The {{halogenated}} alkylamine antihistamines all exhibit optic isomerism and brompheniramine products contain racaemic brompheniramine maleate whereas <b>dexbrompheniramine</b> (Drixoral) is the dextrorotary (right-handed) stereoisomer.|$|E
5000|$|<b>Dexbrompheniramine</b> {{is a first}} {{generation}} antihistamine that reduces {{the effects of the}} neurotransmitter histamine in the body; sneezing, itching, watery eyes, and runny nose.|$|E
50|$|Chlorphenamine {{is part of}} {{a series}} of antihistamines {{including}} pheniramine (Naphcon) and its halogenated derivatives and others including fluorpheniramine, dexchlorphenamine (Polaramine), brompheniramine (Dimetapp), <b>dexbrompheniramine</b> (Drixoral), deschlorpheniramine, triprolidine (Actifed), and iodopheniramine.|$|E
50|$|Derivatives of {{pheniramine}} include chlorphenamine, <b>dexbrompheniramine,</b> dexchlorpheniramine, triprolidine, and brompheniramine. Two other halogenated derivatives, iodopheniramine and fluorpheniramine, {{are currently}} in use for research on combination therapies for malaria and some cancers. The halogenation of pheniramine increases its potency by 20-fold.|$|E
50|$|<b>Dexbrompheniramine</b> is an {{antihistamine}} with anticholinergic properties used {{to treat}} allergic conditions such as hay fever or urticaria. It is the pharmacologically active dextrorotatory isomer of brompheniramine. It was formerly marketed in combination with pseudoephedrine under the name Drixoral in the US and Canada.|$|E
5000|$|Dexbrompheniramine/pseudoephedrine (trade name Drixoral) is a {{combination}} medication that contains the antihistamine <b>dexbrompheniramine</b> maleate and the decongestant pseudoephedrine sulfate. It was manufactured by Schering-Plough and was used to treat symptoms associated with allergies and colds such as itchy and watery eyes, runny nose, nasal and sinus congestion, and sneezing. Because it contains pseudoephedrine, its purchase in the United States was severely restricted by the Combat Methamphetamine Epidemic Act of 2005 over fears that any product containing pseudoephedrine {{can be used to}} make methamphetamine.|$|E
40|$|American guidelines, unlike European guidelines, {{support the}} use of antihistamines as a first line of {{treatment}} for some causes of chronic cough. Transient receptor potential vanilloid- 1 (TRPV 1) is an ion channel activated by the tussive agents capsaicin, resiniferatoxin, and protons. It is predominantly expressed by C-fiber and some Adelta -fiber sensory neurons and is thought to be a cough receptor. By measuring increases in intracellular calcium as an indicator of TRPV 1 activation, the authors sought to determine whether antihistamines could antagonise TRPV 1 permanently expressed in HEK and Pro 5 cells and TRPV 1 endogenously expressed in rat dorsal root ganglia neurons. In human TRPV 1 -expressing HEK cells (hTRPV 1 -HEK), diphenhydramine and fexofenadine failed to inhibit capsaicin-triggered calcium responses. However, both <b>dexbrompheniramine</b> and chlorpheniramine significantly inhibited capsaicin-evoked responses in hTRPV 1 -HEK. <b>Dexbrompheniramine</b> also inhibited activation of rat TRPV 1 expressed in HEK and Pro 5 cells, without interfering with TRPA 1 and proteinase-activated receptor- 2 (PAR(2)) activation. Finally, in rat dorsal root ganglia neuron preparations, <b>dexbrompheniramine</b> dose-dependently inhibited capsaicin-evoked calcium responses. Thus, the inhibition of TRPV 1 activation by <b>dexbrompheniramine</b> may provide one potential mechanism whereby this antihistamine exerts its therapeutic effect in chronic cough...|$|E
40|$|Exogenous {{histamine}} decreases {{food intake}} and injection of H- 1 antagonists increases food intake in rats. Previous work {{has focused on}} the effect of relatively large doses of histamine on eating behavior, and have not measured the effect of histamine on postprandial satiety behaviors. This work measures the effect of small and large doses of histamine and investigates the effects of an H- 1 receptor antagonist on eating, drinking and postprandial satiety behavior. Twelve adult male Sprague-Dawley rats not food deprived were tested eating Nilla Wafer cookies with or without water following subcutaneous injections of. 625 mg/Kg histamine, 10 mg/Kg histamine or 0. 9 % NaCl vehicle. The second experiment tested the effects of the H- 1 antagonist <b>dexbrompheniramine</b> (DXB); 1 mg/Kg administered 10 minutes prior to. 625 mg/Kg or 10 mg/Kg histamine on eating, drinking and satiety behavior. The 10 mg/Kg histamine inhibited eating and increase water intake, but failed to alter behavioral satiety measures. The. 625 mg/Kg histamine stimulated drinking, but did not affect food intake or satiety. When DXB was given prior to histamine it reduced histamine-induced drinking, but did not affect food intake or satiety measures. These results demonstrate that exogenous histamine can inhibit eating without changing postprandial satiety, challenging the notion that endogenous histamine contributes to satiety for food in rats...|$|E
40|$|SummaryObjectivesTo {{review the}} seven Cochrane reviews of non-antibiotic {{treatment}} for the common cold. MethodsEach Cochrane review was read and summarized, and results presented as relative risks and, where possible, numbers needed to treat. ResultsThe main theme that runs through these Cochrane reviews is the variable quality of the primary studies. In general, the reviewers are fairly cautious {{about the benefits of}} any of the treatments other than first-dose decongestants and antihistamine–decongestant combinations. For antihistamines alone, the reviewers were clear about the lack of efficacy except in the high-quality studies in which a global improvement in symptoms was noted. Some studies were statistically significant, but the Cochrane reviewers were guarded about how clinically significant they were. For Echinacea, problems were found with the quality of the studies and the wide range of different forms of this substance. Heated humidified air seemed to be effective in the UK and Israel, but not the USA, making definitive statements about efficacy difficult. Over-the-counter medication for cough seemed to have no documented benefit in {{children under the age of}} 5 years. Letosteine (a mucolytic) may be effective in children but is not available in the UK. Bisolvon (a mucolytic) was found to be effective for cough in only one study. For older children and adults, dextromethorphan may be effective (two out of three studies showed benefit), and guiafenesin (an expectorant) showed mixed benefit in two trials. <b>Dexbrompheniramine</b> (a sedating antihistamine) /pseudoephedrine (6 mg/ 120 mg twice daily for 1 week) was significantly more effective than placebo for severity of cough, whereas, in another study, loratadine (a non-sedating antihistamine) /pseudoephedrine (5 mg/ 120 mg twice daily for 4 days) did not show any difference between the study groups. Vitamin C may have a small role in preventing the common cold, with possibly a greater role in high-intensity physical activity and sub-arctic conditions. Zinc lozenges seemed to be effective, but the issue of unblinding due to taste was a methodological issue of concern to the reviewers. The benefits and harms are calculated as numbers needed to treat for one person to benefit (NNTB) and numbers needed to treat for one person to harm (NNTH), and were calculated by the author. ConclusionMost non-antibiotic treatments for the common cold are probably not effective. The most promising are dextromethorphan, bisolvon and guiaphenesin for cough, antihistamine–decongestant combinations for a wide range of symptoms, nasal decongestants (at least for the first dose) and possibly zinc lozenges...|$|E
