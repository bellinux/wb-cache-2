40|$|A highly {{promising}} {{energy crop}} for biogas production can be Miscanthus x giganteus. It has multiple advantages, which include low soil requirements {{and the existence}} of genotypes adapted to dry conditions in comparison to other energy crops. Miscanthus cannot be used in the biogas plant without a pretreatment due to the recalcitrant nature of lignocelluloses. One of the most efficient pretreatment methods for lignocellulosic biomass is steam explosion. This includes heating the biomass at high temperature values, followed by mechanical disruption of the biomass fibres by a rapid pressure drop. The objective {{of this study is to}} analyse the effect of the steam explosion pretreatment on the specific biogas and methane production of miscanthus. In addition methane hectare yields are calculated and compared to those of maize. Steam explosion pretreatment was carried out in a laboratory scale facility in Ĺs, Norway. The miscanthus was mixed with water and heated up to the desired temperature. After a defined pretreatment time the pressure in the reaction vessel was reduced rapidly, which caused the liquid water to vaporize immediately. The material was cooled down in a flushing tank and was then stored at 5 °C until further analytical procedures. Pretreatment temperatures were 190 °C and 210 °C; holding times were 5, 10 and 15 minutes. Determination of the specific methane yield was done in triplicate using batch tests according to VDI 4630. The material was inoculated with the liquid fermentation residue of a biogas plant. The produced gas was collected in <b>eudiometers</b> and then analysed for the CH 4 and CO 2 content...|$|R
40|$|A Thesis Submitted In Partial Fulfillment of the Requirements For the Degree of Master of Science MicrobiologyFossil fuels {{have been}} a crucial energy source for years. Their use come at a high cost with {{detrimental}} effects to the environment, including climate change, which affects both fauna and flora worldwide. Biogas production is a safe process by which products such as food and yard waste and feces are used as substrates for methane production. This serves as an alternative method to transform methane, a greenhouse gas, into electricity, thus benefiting both environment and population. The German Institute of Standardization or Deutsches Institut fur Normung (DIN) has developed a method {{for the analysis of}} biogas production. This method uses <b>eudiometers,</b> a laboratory glass device that measure changes in gas volume, to measure quantity and quality of biogas. The Automatic Methane Potential Test System (AMPTS) is a newly developed method, which makes use of an automated system to measure biogas production. The study looks at the AMPTS as a valid method for biomethane potential analysis (BMP) s, comparable to the DIN method. These methods were compared for analyzing biogas production with identical substrates over the course of 3 - 6 weeks. The substrates included, were microcrystalline cellulose, Smucker's jelly, lactose pellets, potato sludge, paper sludge, cyanobacterial biomass, parlor water, manure scrape, used bedding and fresh straw. Biogas production was quantified for both DIN and AMPTS. Statistical analysis showed that biogas produced using the DIN method was statistically similar to the AMPTS method (p > 0. 05). This is important because it supports the hypothesis that the AMPTS method is valid for BMP analysis, which significantly decreases costs and increase efficiency, while reducing testing time to half. It also decreases the amount of methane produced from decomposing waste, by allowing rapid testing of feedstock...|$|R

In the first one we present its aims and structure, as well as some historiographic considerations. The second one generally presents the eighteenth century scientific context in which Magalhaes' work was developed. In the third chapter we take account of Magalhaes' importance in the development of european scientific communication, analysing virtually all his known correspondence. In chapter four we present and analyse the improvements he introduced in several instruments, namely octants, sextants, reflecting circles, clocks, barometers, thermometers, precision balances, Atwood's fall machine and a registration instrument to be used in meteorology. In chapter five we refer to the collections of instruments he sent to Portugal and Spain and the localization of those instruments he had signed and still exist. In chapter six we have analysed Magalhaes' "Essai sur la nouvelle theorie du feu elementaire" {{in the context of the}} development of pneumatic chemistry and heat theories. Chapetr seven was dedicated to Magalhaes' other scientific contributions as the improvement of the glass machine for preparing artificial mineral waters in a short time, the alambics, the <b>eudiometers</b> for testing air salubrity.

5000|$|Marsilio Landriani (Milan, 1751 - Vienna, 1815) was an Italian chemist, {{physicist}} and meteorologist.

5000|$|Although the eudiometer's {{invention}} {{is usually}} credited to Marsilio Landriani, {{it was truly}} pioneered by Count Alessandro Volta (1745-1827), an Italian physicist who {{is well known for}} his contributions to the electric battery and electricity. Aside from its laboratory function, the <b>eudiometer</b> is also known for its part in the [...] "Volta pistol". Volta invented this instrument in 1777 for the purpose of testing the [...] "goodness" [...] of air, analyzing the flammability of gases, or to demonstrate the chemical effects of electricity. Volta's Pistol had a long glass tube that was closed at the top, like a <b>eudiometer.</b> Two electrodes were fed through the tube and produced a spark gap inside the tube. Volta's initial use of this instrument concerned the study of swamp gases in particular. Volta's pistol was filled with oxygen and another gas. The homogeneous mixture was taped shut with a cork. A spark could be introduced into the gas chamber by electrodes, and possibly catalyze a reaction by static electricity, using Volta's electrophorus. If the gases were flammable, they would explode, and increase the pressure within the gas chamber. This pressure would be too great and eventually cause the cork to become airborne. Volta's pistol was made with either glass or brass, however due to the electricity the glass was vulnerable to exploding. Volta's extensive studies on measuring and creating high levels of electric currents caused the electrical unit, the volt, to be named after him.|$|E
5000|$|In 1806 Pepys was {{prominent}} in {{the founding of the}} London Institution and was an original manager.

In 1808 and 1809 he was involved in the subscription to the ‘great battery’ installed at the Royal Institution. Another close friend was William Allen and together they investigated the composition of carbon dioxide, and the density of ammonia, and elucidated the chemical phenomena of respiration in man, animals, and plants. These researches were successful largely because of the ingenious apparatus invented and designed by Pepys. He was active in the management of the Royal Institution of Great Britain and was its Vice-President in 1816. He was honorary secretary of the London Institution from 1821 to 1824 and was Master of the Worshipful Company of Cutlers in 1822 and 1828. He became the Treasurer and Vice-President of the Geological Society. [...] As well as the manufacture of surgical instruments in the City he took active directorships in the Imperial Continental Gas Association, which was introducing gas illumination to cities and towns across Europe, and the General Steam Navigation Company, which first used steam-propelled vessels to maintain a regular passenger and cargo service to Continental ports.|$|E
30|$|Special {{attention}} should be devoted to the tightness of the apparatus. A critical point is the seal between the <b>eudiometer</b> and the bottle (picture 3) and the valve {{at the top of}} the <b>eudiometer</b> (picture 4). To assure the tightness of the system, the seals should always be carefully greased. It is advisable to check the tightness or the equipment before the start of the degradation test. To do so it is recommended to let the assembled apparatus (without sludge) stand for 24 hour with the collection bottle at a significant lower height than the meniscus of the liquid in the <b>eudiometer.</b> This set up applies a slight negative pressure (vacuum) to the system, which allows one to detect any leaks before the test is started. The risk of leaks can be further minimized, if the bottles containing the excess <b>eudiometer</b> solution are places at about the same height as the meniscus of the liquid inside the <b>eudiometer</b> during the test to minimize the vacuum effect (see picture 5).|$|E
30|$|The {{apparatus}} (see Additional file 1 : Annex 2 pictures 1 - 2) {{consists of}} an <b>eudiometer</b> (e.g. from Behr Labor-Technik, Düsseldorf, Germany, Behrotest <b>Eudiometer</b> Unit FH 10 as per DIN 38414 p 8) with a volume of 400 ml, graduated {{from top to bottom}} at intervals of 5 ml. This is attached to the incubation bottle (500 ml capacity) by a ground glass joint. A connection tube is led through the base of the <b>eudiometer</b> tube to allow the sludge gas produced in the incubation bottle to enter the <b>eudiometer</b> tube and in this way displace the barrier liquid into the leveling bottle (750 ml) through a tube. At {{the upper end of the}} <b>eudiometer</b> is a stopcock to allow gas samples to be removed and also to adjust the zero point of the barrier liquid. The barrier liquid consists of 30 ml sulfuric acid (density: 1.84 g/ml), 200 g sodium sulfate decahydrate and a few drops of 0.1 % methyl orange solution per liter deionized water. The incubation bottles are placed in a water bath kept at 35 ± 1 °C by a controlled water thermostat (e.g. Behrotest Apparatus FH 6 from Behr Labor-Technik, Düsseldorf).

30|$|The anionic {{surfactant}} LAS was degraded {{much less than}} the other surfactants.

The high mean degradation and standard deviation values are due to a single anomalous degradation value of 133.4 % submitted by laboratory 5. If the anomalous result is discounted, then LAS achieves a mean degradation of 14.3 % with a standard deviation of 12.7 %. Laboratory 5 found no toxic effects associated with LAS as demonstrated by the toxicity control. However, it was noted that the results appeared ‘strange’, although no problems were found. Possible explanations might be (a) the presence of oxygen in the system (see below) or (b) that the observed ‘degradation’ was an artifact due to a not properly sealed apparatus and/or that the bottles containing the excess <b>eudiometer</b> solution were not placed at about the same height as the meniscus of the liquid inside the <b>eudiometer</b> (see [5] for a more detailed explanation).|$|E

40|$|The {{history of}} the <b>eudiometer,</b> the method of testing devised by Joseph Priestley {{in order to measure}} the {{quantity}} of dephlogisticated air (oxygen) in closed rooms, is a useful example of how extensive the role of theory was in eighteenth-century experimental practice. Scientific instruments were the means for manipulating phenomena and represented at the highest degree a renewed and positive attitude towards experimental practice. However, eighteenth-century naturalists often used instruments for theoretical purposes which, in many cases, had {{very little to do with}} the phenomena that could be investigated with the instrument in question. The case of the <b>eudiometer</b> is interesting because it not only conveyed a multiplicity of theories and practices often in opposition with each other, but also the genealogy of its naming, far from being conventional, encouraged the emergence of this tension. In 1772 Joseph Priestley presented to the Royal Society of London his Observations on Different Kinds of Air 1 in which, among other things, he announced a new method for testing the salubrity of air. This method was derived from Priestley’s isolation of nitrous air (NO) and his later observation that this gas had the property of absorbing dephlogisticated air. By this combination it was easy to ascertain with precision the diminution of the quantity of dephlogisticated air in common air. The volume of common air diminished in proportion to the quantity of dephlogisticated air it contained. One of the consequences which could be drawn from this was that a small diminution of common air after the reaction denoted the presence of a small quantity of dephlogisticated air and therefore the insalubrity of air. Marsilio Landriani, professor of experimental physics at the Scuole Palatine in Milan, 2 was probably the first to realise the technical possibility of creating, out of this observation, an instrument and a theory of its scientific implications.

30|$|In {{order to}} {{determine}} the anaerobic degradation, an exactly defined amount of the substance is incubated together with sludge inoculum at 35 °C ± 1 °C. The sludge inoculum consists of digested sludge to which a certain amount of raw sludge (raw sludge is usually a mixture of 40 % sludge from the pre-sedimentation and 60 % sludge from the final sedimentation in WWTPs) has been added in order to ‘vitalize’ it, i.e. to obtain a basic sludge gas development. The addition of raw sludge is part of the original DIN 38414, part 8.

40|$|Global warming {{arguments}} {{have gained}} {{more and more}} attention due to the new regulations of carbon dioxide (CO 2) emission in the world. Monoethanolamine (MEA) has been employed as an important industrial absorbent for CO 2 capture since the 1930 s because of its high reaction rate, relatively low cost, and thermal stability. The concentration of MEA in aqueous solution is generally increased to 30 mass % in the CO 2 capture process. The energy consumption is high in the present MEA process {{because of the high}} reaction heat of MEA with CO 2, and a large number of liquid transportation. To reduce the energy consumption and improve the efficiency of CO 2 capture in the present MEA process, further increase in solution concentration of MEA is a potential solution. Basic research on the properties and reaction kinetics with CO 2 of concentrated aqueous MEA solution is necessary to perform engineering calculations and important for the dimensioning of pipes, pumps and heat exchangers etc. In this work, a novel solubility apparatus and technique was designed and built for the measurement of physical solubility of a gas in liquid. The technique employs a scaled spiral glass tube with a small drop of mercury inside as a <b>eudiometer</b> as an alternative to a three–branch U–tube setup to keep the system pressure constant, and measure the volume drop of absorbed gas at constant temperature. A “vacuum gas saturation” method is proposed for gas saturation operation in the measurement. The physical solubilities of N 2 O in pure water over the temperature range from 298. 15 to 323. 15 K and in aqueous salt MEA solutions at 313. 15 K were measured under a constant ambient pressure to validate the new technique. The new solubility apparatus and technique possesses some advantages including easy operation, lower mercury inventory, higher sensitivity and greater accurate. The physical mass transfer coefficients of N 2 O in aqueous MEA solutions were performed using the new apparatus as well. The physical solubilities of N 2 O in aqueous MEA solutions over the full concentrations range were measured by the novel solubility apparatus over a temperature range from 298. 15 to 323. 15 K under a constant ambient pressure. The physical solubilities of CO 2 in aqueous MEA solutions were estimated using “N 2 O analogy” method. The results of the solubility measurements of N 2 O and CO 2 in water and N 2 O in aqueous MEA solutions agree with literature. A semiempirical model to solubility proposed by Wang et al. was used to correlate the solubilities of N 2 O and CO 2 in aqueous MEA solutions, and the correlation results are in agreement with experiment data. The results show that the solubilities of both N 2 O and CO 2 in aqueous MEA solutions showed negative deviation behaviors from the linear additive principle. The viscosities of aqueous MEA solutions over the full concentration range were measured using a rheometer with a double–gap measuring system at a temperature range from 298. 15 to 353. 15 K. The measured viscosity data are in good agreement with the literature values. An exponent model proposed by DiGuilio et al. was used to correlate the data and the results are very satisfied for the regression of the viscosities of pure MEA from 298. 15 to 353. 15 K. The polynomial model proposed by Teng et al. with five parameters is satisfied the aqueous MEA solution. The relationship between the viscosity and mole fraction of MEA shows both positive and negative deviation behavior and the critical mole fraction of MEA was found is 0. 2. The molecular diffusivities of N 2 O in aqueous MEA solutions up to 12 M were studied from 298. 15 to 333. 15 K using a laminar liquid jet absorber, and the diffusivities of CO 2 in aqueous MEA solutions were calculated by the N 2 O analogy method. A modified construction of the temperature control for the laminar liquid jet was proposed. The relationship between the diffusivity and the viscosity of the solution is roughly in agreement with the modified Stokes–Einstein equations. On the other hand, an exponent mathematical model was used to correlate N 2 O diffusivities in aqueous MEA solutions satisfactorily for calculation of the diffusivities of CO 2 in aqueous MEA solutions. Based on the measured physical properties in this work, the chemical reaction kinetics of CO 2 with aqueous MEA solutions over a wide concentration range from 0. 5 to 12 M were investigated using a stirred cell absorber with a plane gas–liquid interface over a temperature range from 298. 15 to 323. 15 K. To satisfy the criterion of pseudo-first-order reaction, low CO 2 partial pressure (3 – 4 kPa) was employed. The rates of CO 2 absorption in the solutions were determined from the fall in pressure, and the reaction rate constants were determinate by two treatment methods on the same experimental data, viz. a “differential” and an “integral” method, which are derived from the mass balance principle and Henry’s law. The reaction between MEA and CO 2 is based on “zwitterion” mechanism in this work. The gas-phase resistance was investigated systematically in the stirred cell. To reduce the gas phase resistances in the measurements of CO 2 absorption in the solutions, speeding up the gas phase fans and employing very low inert gas pressures of N 2 and solution vapor were suggested. The chemical reaction kinetics of CO 2 in aqueous MEA solutions were measured over the concentration range from 0. 5 to 12 M by a stirred cell absorber with batchwise operation for both gas and liquid. As same as the dilute solution, the reaction of concentrated aqueous IV MEA solution with CO 2 is also first order with respect to MEA and the reaction is in the fast reaction regime. The reaction activation energy (Ea) of aqueous MEA + CO 2 is calculated based on the experimental data. The enhanced mass transfer coefficient in liquid phase, kLE, increases with the concentration of MEA solutions but decreases when the molarity of MEA is higher than 8 M. Last, some recommendations are given to the future work. CO 2 –loaded MEA solution is suggested to focus on in the next–step work, the properties and gas absorption of the system can be measured and discussion by the same experimental method mentioned in this thesis. The gas absorption and desorption from the CO 2 –loaded aqueous MEA solutions should be performed as well. The issue of heat transfer should be taken into account and investigated when the concentrated aqueous MEA solution is employed in the CO 2 capture process. The stirred cell or laminar liquid jet can be employed in these studies under a suitable pressure. However, to obtain more accurate experimental data, some modifications on the construction of both the laminar liquid jet and stirred cell should be made. For example, the absorption cell of the liquid laminar jet can be smaller, and the nozzle or receiver should be adjustable etc. Regarding the modification on the temperature control of these equipments, the main idea is to immerse all the gas and liquid pipes in to the same water bath or its hose. Some suggestions of these modifications are proposed in the appendix of this thesis...|$|E
