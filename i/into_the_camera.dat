5|$|South Carolina Congressman Frank Underwood (Kevin Spacey), the Democratic Majority Whip, {{leaves his}} house in Washington, D.C. after hearing his neighbors’ dog {{get hit by a}} car. As he comforts the mortally-wounded dog, he looks <b>into</b> <b>the</b> <b>camera</b> and says “Moments like this require someone who will act, who will do the {{unpleasant}} thing, the necessary thing,” before calmly proceeding to strangle it. This introduces both his habit of breaking the fourth wall to narrate, and his cold and vicious nature. Frank and his wife, Claire (Robin Wright), go on to attend a New Year’s Eve party in honor of the new President-elect, Garrett Walker (Michel Gill), a fellow Democrat and winner of the 2012 election. Frank confesses to the viewer that he does not like Walker, but saw his political potential early on and ingratiated himself to him, putting himself in line to be nominated as Walker’s Secretary of State after 22 years in Congress.|$|E
5|$|The {{producers}} faced a stiff {{challenge in}} securing a rural bungalow {{to serve as}} the landlady's mansion. Even after obtaining a building as the best possible fit in the coastal town of Bobbili, infestation of snakes and bats posed a problem for the crew. In addition, the building was not strong enough to support the filming equipment. Under these circumstances, the makeshift production designers refurbished the building with space for chicken coops and goat pens as required by the script. To make the space look inhabited, local help was sought for trampling the ground with their livestock. The local people wanted to act as extras in exchange for providing farming tools, bullock carts and other material. As a result, the crew had to ensure that these extras didn't look <b>into</b> <b>the</b> <b>camera</b> during filming.|$|E
5|$|The song's video {{features}} close-up {{shots of}} Beyoncé and incorporates psychedelic light effects and symmetrical filming photography. As the acoustic guitar begins playing, Beyoncé's face comes into view. She stands with {{her blond hair}} draped just below her exposed shoulders. As she intently stares <b>into</b> <b>the</b> <b>camera,</b> her skin glistens as though it has been coated with a honey-like and glittery substance. Turning her head from right to left, with her eyes fixed off-camera, Beyoncé starts belting out the first verse. As the chorus is reached, scenes of Beyoncé in a darkened room are shown. Additionally, she places her face delicately against dripping water, gently brushing it with her lips and palms. The scenery changes and Beyoncé {{is back in the}} darkened chamber, where she removes her dress.|$|E

5|$|The video {{opens with}} a still image {{of a woman in}} her bikini (Manuela Arbeláez) while various scenery backdrops are {{superimposed}} in the background. The first scenes of the video flicker between Diddy’s life with his femme fatale and Diddy singing with the rest of Dirty Money in the bedroom of a mansion. Some of the possessions in the house such as picture frames shatter as the chorus builds up. However, during Dawn Richard and Kalenna Harper’s verses, the camera focus on Richard and Harper singing directly <b>into</b> <b>the</b> <b>camera</b> lens. As Drake’s verse begins, Diddy falls backwards into a swimming pool in slow motion, while the camera image slowly fades into a club scene. There is a brief shot of a bottle of coconut-flavored Cîroc vodka before Diddy is scene mingling in the club. The camera mainly focus on Drake, who is observing what is happening and rapping his verse. During the bridge, Richard and Harper appear in the club and Diddy’s femme fatale is seen in the background.|$|E
5|$|Written and {{directed}} by Welles at Toland's suggestion, the theatrical trailer for Citizen Kane differs from other trailers in {{that it did not}} feature a single second of footage of the actual film itself, but acts as a wholly original, tongue-in-cheek, pseudo-documentary piece on the film's production. Filmed {{at the same time as}} Citizen Kane itself, it offers the only existing behind-the-scenes footage of the film. The trailer, shot by Wild instead of Toland, follows an unseen Welles as he provides narration for a tour around the film set, introductions to the film's core cast members, and a brief overview of Kane's character. The trailer also contains a number of trick shots, including one of Everett Sloane appearing at first to be running <b>into</b> <b>the</b> <b>camera,</b> which turns out to be the reflection of the camera in a mirror.|$|E
5|$|The {{music video}} begins with Beyoncé {{preparing}} herself for her wedding ceremony. She {{is in her}} boudoir wearing a lacy corset and a lingerie combo with garters. As the song begins, Beyoncé looks towards the camera, addressing the viewer while affirming {{the subject of the}} song that she was the best he ever had. The video moves from Beyoncé playing with a tiara, a veil and tulle netting on a bed, to various stages of getting dressed. Between scenes, flash back scenes of Beyoncé in high school are shown. Beyoncé is seen with a high school boyfriend at their senior-prom night on May 16, 1998. As Beyoncé and her boyfriend dance, he becomes interested in another girl, leaving Beyoncé alone on the dance floor. The video then returns to the present, with Beyoncé in her final preparations before her marriage. She is shown wearing a white gown and singing at sunset atop a grassy hill, followed by a scene of her walking down the aisle and exchanging vows. Her former lover is shown at the prom, deep in thought, with his prom king crown askew on his head. Beyoncé and her new husband are seen celebrating at a happy and well-attended reception. The groom removes the bride's garter with his teeth and they start dancing with their younger family members. The final scene features Beyoncé looking <b>into</b> <b>the</b> <b>camera</b> looking happy and satisfied. She walks off confidently to rejoin her wedding party and new husband, and then the screen fades to black.|$|E

5|$|The {{music video}} was {{directed}} by Nima Nourizadeh and released on 11 December 2006. It opens with an aerial shot of a piano which begins to play by itself, and then moves to reveal a film set. Allen stands on a lamppost, wearing a raincoat, with lights, a camera and directors surrounding her. The image zooms <b>into</b> <b>the</b> <b>camera</b> from the studio and turns the video black-and-white, with the story coming to life, as the singer begins the first verse. From the lamppost {{she is able to}} see her former self walking down the street with her boyfriend. While they enter a building, a light comes out in one of the windows, revealing their silhouettes kissing. The caption changes, with the two of them dancing, while a man plays the piano in the background; as he dips her and holds this position, she continues to sing. The camera zooms out to see a heart shaped window surrounding the two that opens and changes to a picture on Allen's wall. She is alone in a room, staring at a mirror. Her hair is let down and she is wearing a white nightgown. The piano is seen again playing itself, as the image shifts to the window, where Allen is again portrayed leaning against the lamppost in the street, as {{in the beginning of the}} video. She again looks at the silhouettes in the window of the building, as it collapses on her, once again changing the scene. This time, the singer is looking through another window, and then turns around to a mirror which captures a door. The former Allen with the raincoat walks through with her boyfriend, as their shadows are seen kissing. The image changes to Allen from the film set, zooming out from the camera's viewing piece, making the video in colour again.|$|E
25|$|Most of the slapstick comedic {{sequences}} between Hale and Denver {{were heavily}} inspired by Laurel and Hardy, particularly by Hale breaking the fourth wall by looking directly <b>into</b> <b>the</b> <b>camera</b> expressing his frustration with Denver's clumsiness as Oliver Hardy often did.|$|E

25|$|Douglass {{considered}} photography {{very important}} in ending slavery and racism, and believed that the camera would not lie, even {{in the hands of}} a racist white, photographs being an excellent counter to the many racist caricatures, particularly in blackface minstrelsy. He was the most photographed American of the 19th Century, self-consciously using photography to advance his political views. He never smiled, specifically so as not to play into the racist caricature of a happy slave. He tended to look directly <b>into</b> <b>the</b> <b>camera</b> to confront the viewer, with a stern look.|$|E
25|$|Unlike its predecessors, {{which used}} an engine based on 2D {{isometric}} graphics and sprites, SimCity 4 primarily uses a 3D engine to render its graphics. The landscape and moving props such as vehicles are modeled as fully polygonal and rotatable 3D objects. Small buildings and props are drawn as flat images, which are pasted onto billboards; polygons with their surface normal facing <b>into</b> <b>the</b> <b>camera.</b> Larger buildings are modeled using a hybrid approach; a simple polygonal model defines {{the shape of}} the building, then textures are added to create detail such as doors, windows and rooftop clutter.|$|E
25|$|Meanwhile, Hammerschmidt publishes {{his story}} and threatens to end Frank's {{campaign}} {{weeks before the}} election. Claire urges Frank to use a heavier hand in the situation, and they decide to fight back by creating chaos. Frank addresses the public declaring that the nation is at total war, ordering {{the full force of}} the military be used to combat global terrorism regardless the cost. The season ends with Frank and Claire watching the live execution of the hostage together, and Claire breaking the fourth wall for the first time by looking <b>into</b> <b>the</b> <b>camera</b> along with Frank.|$|E
50|$|Shells of Wardoceras are {{smooth and}} orchoconic, with a {{circular}} cross section and small subcental siphuncle, the segments {{of which are}} ventrally straight and dorsally slightly expanded <b>into</b> <b>the</b> <b>camerae.</b> <b>The</b> siphuncle is completely encircled internally by a thin lining that thickens and thins rhythmically so as to slightly thicken just forward of the septal necks, suggesting an origin in annular deposits. Cameral deposits are well developed and are thick,almost filling the ventral portion of the more apical chambers but also found in dorsal chambers as well.|$|R

25|$|Reporters {{were denied}} access to the prisoners, but not so {{photographer}} Alexander Gardner. On April 27, Gardner began taking photographs {{of those who were}} caught up in the government's dragnet. One by one, each prisoner was brought on deck and photographed in a few positions. Gardner took far more photographs of Powell than anyone else. Powell obliged Gardner by posing seated, standing (with and without restraints), and modeling the overcoat and hat he'd worn the night of the Seward attacks. Among the most famous of these photographs is one in which Powell sits against the gun turret of the Saugus, staring <b>into</b> <b>the</b> <b>camera</b> in a modern fashion, relaxed and direct.|$|E
25|$|Many of the viewers, already deeply {{upset at}} the murder of such a brave, honest, courageous, and well-loved man {{apparently}} killed in defence of his family, were further affected by the mournful manner in which Dyer, who deeply respected and admired Swift, spoke. It was only later revealed {{that the reason for}} Dyer's initial refusal to speak on air, and his actual refusal to look <b>into</b> <b>the</b> <b>camera</b> whilst speaking – having been forced against his will, by Casey, to deliver the eulogy – was solely due to his having left his false teeth at home (a fact that he refused to reveal to Casey or anyone else at the time), and {{had nothing to do with}} any reluctance to acknowledge his own personal sense of great loss at Swift's murder.|$|E
25|$|The Return of the King {{also has}} {{practical}} effects. In the Pyre of Denethor sequence, as the Steward of Gondor throws Pippin {{out of the}} Tomb, John Noble threw a size double named Fon onto a prostrate Billy Boyd, who immediately pushed his head into camera to complete the illusion. A few burning torches were also reflected off a plate of glass and <b>into</b> <b>the</b> <b>camera</b> for when Gandalf's horse Shadowfax kicks Denethor onto the pyre. Because of Jackson's requirement for complete representation of his fantasy world, numerous miniatures were built, such as 1:72 scale miniature of Minas Tirith, which rises 7m high and is 6.5m in diameter. 1:14 scale sections of the city were also required, and the Extended Edition scene of the collapsing City of the Dead has 80,000 small skulls, amounting in total to a single cubic meter. The miniatures team concluded in November with the Black Gate, after 1000 days of shooting, and the final digital effects shot done was the Ring's destruction, on 25 November.|$|E
40|$|Video {{feedback}} occurs {{whenever a}} video camera is directed at a screen displaying the image currently being recorded by <b>the</b> <b>camera.</b> It {{can be observed in}} everyday situations, for example at sporting events when a stadium’s display screen comes <b>into</b> <b>the</b> <b>camera’s</b> view. Here we consider how this simple physical process is affected by the fact that monitors are pixelbased, and show that it can result in stationary fractal patterns such as von-Koch snowflakes and Sierpinski gaskets...|$|R
5000|$|Other {{features}} {{found on}} many SLR cameras include through-the-lens (TTL) metering and sophisticated flash control {{referred to as}} [...] "dedicated electronic flash". In a dedicated system, once the dedicated electronic flash is inserted <b>into</b> <b>the</b> <b>camera's</b> hot shoe and turned on, there is then communication between <b>camera</b> and flash. <b>The</b> <b>camera's</b> synchronization speed is set, along with <b>the</b> aperture. Many <b>camera</b> models measure <b>the</b> light that reflects off of the film plane, which controls the flash duration of the electronic flash. This is denoted TTL flash metering.|$|R
50|$|However, {{to install}} precompiled {{firmware}} on a PowerShot camera, {{it is only}} necessary to download the correct binary and copy it to an SD memory card.

If <b>the</b> card is unlocked or removed, <b>the</b> <b>camera</b> will start up in the original Canon firmware. CHDK will mask the lock on the SD card so that <b>the</b> <b>camera</b> will still write to it however. Alternatively, CHDK can be loaded manually from the Canon menu.|$|R
25|$|The video {{opens with}} a {{starship}} flying towards an island after being summoned by its local tribesmen. The island locals slowly awake as the craft passes overhead. The starship then beams a pink bikini-clad electric green-haired Minaj down onto the beach and she begins to sing. She is presumably being worshipped as a goddess as she is carried away through the jungle by the island locals wearing a pale pink bikini with strands hanging off the bottom and short green hair, which is also worn during some kaleidoscope effects and in one scene of her on the beach singing. Minaj is then seen dancing in the mountains wearing a white, pink and black bodysuit behind a glass box {{while some of the}} male islanders run up to her. The scene then shifts towards the volcano top at nighttime where Minaj is sitting on top of the box with some of the locals dancing around her. In the final scene, a blonde-haired Minaj, wearing a white fringed strapless bikini splattered with paint, is partying with the islanders. Intercut scenes show Minaj singing with kaleidoscope effects on her in the second outfit and some more kaleidoscope effects in the same outfit but under blacklights. It ends with her singing the last line while looking directly <b>into</b> <b>the</b> <b>camera.</b>|$|E
500|$|The episode {{ends with}} a live-action parody of Dallas, in which Pam Ewing (Victoria Principal) wakes up and tells her husband Bobby (Patrick Duffy) about a dream she had of a strange episode of Family Guy.

[...] to get <b>the</b> <b>camera</b> to slow down. Eventually they disappear off-camera. Then, <b>the</b> <b>camera</b> pans back. Upon returning to where they left off it's discovered that they are now catching their breath from the running that Jackson and his troupe are able to do easily.
