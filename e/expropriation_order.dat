The property belonged to activist Auguste Guiraud, and was due for expropriation {{under the terms of the}} decree. On 10 June 1973 re-construction began in defiance of the <b>expropriation</b> <b>order</b> and the fact that planning permission had not been granted. Hundreds of supporters came to join the effort, notably the hippie contingent who had to learn the art and craft of masonry very quickly, and, it must be said, with somewhat random results.

50|$|During the Nazi era, Müller {{avoided the}} risk of an <b>expropriation</b> <b>order</b> by leasing the {{building}} to the Wehrmacht. Troops used the site for rest and recuperation after battle. After WW2 Johannes Müller was condemned as a war criminal (Hauptschuldiger) because of supporting Hitler in his articles (Spruchkammer). As a result, he lost his property. The castle was then briefly confiscated by the U.S. Army and used as a field hospital. The Bavarian government used the building as a ward for Displaced Persons, survivors of the Holocaust and for tuberculosis patients. After Johannes Müller died in 1951, Bernhard and Sieglinde Müller leased the castle from the government to run it in the old tradition.Sieglinde Müller and Mesirca get married in 1954.|$|E

Israel left the Temple Mount under the {{jurisdiction}} of an Islamic waqf, but opened the Western Wall to Jewish access. The Moroccan Quarter, which was located adjacent to the Western Wall, was evacuated and razed. {{to make way for a}} plaza for those visiting the wall. [...] On 18 April 1968, an <b>expropriation</b> <b>order</b> by the Israeli Ministry of Finance more than doubled the size of the Jewish Quarter, evicting its Arab residents and seizing over 700 buildings of which 105 belonged to Jewish inhabitants prior to the Jordanian occupation of the city. The order designated these areas for public use, but they were intended for Jews alone. The government offered 200 Jordanian dinars to each displaced Arab family.|$|E

The year 1917 marks the founding of the State Park (Parque do Estado); sources were used until 1928 to supply water to the district of Ipiranga.

In contrast with other places, at Montargull there was no retaliation against right wing peopole or the Church, except for hooking off the bells. There were, however, some <b>expropriations</b> in <b>order</b> to support the war front.|$|R

He goes on to propose a more decentralised economic system based on mutual aid and voluntary cooperation, asserting that the tendencies for this kind of organisation already exist, both in evolution and in human society. He also talks about details of revolution and <b>expropriation</b> in <b>order</b> not to end in a reactionary way.|$|R
50|$|Some 95% of the possessors {{said they}} did not want {{resettlement}} and wanted to negotiate directly. Subsequently, 192 out of 213 possession rights were settled; and acquisition of the 8 public properties was negotiated with the municipality of HN. In August 2001, the remaining 13 possession rights were acquired through an <b>expropriation</b> process <b>ordered</b> by national judges in accordance with the Colombian Mining Law. Court action was initiated on behalf of those people who had not agreed to sell their possession rights; and, in May 2002, the Colombian Supreme Court ordered that the municipality of HN provide primary education and housing infrastructure support for children of this group. While schooling is provided free to students, there are associated expenses for such items as educational materials. Following a review at the end of 2002, it was decided the funding should be provided directly to the schools attended by the children. Through the Fundación Nuestra Señora del Pilar, assistance has been given to the school in HN for a cafeteria and to the school in Patilla for school furniture and materials.|$|R
50|$|The {{church has}} functioned as the {{university}} church for the Pontifical University of St. Thomas Aquinas (Angelicum) since the Dominicans {{were able to}} re-acquire the convent complex from the Italian government in 1927 after its <b>expropriation</b> from the <b>Order</b> in 1870 due to the Laws of suppression of religious orders. The church is used to celebrate the solemn inauguration of each academic year, the feast of St. Thomas Aquinas and the official closing of the academic year. It closes during the university's summer break except for the feast of St. Dominic on 7 August. Other than during public functions, visits need to be arranged by prior appointment.|$|R
50|$|Despite the {{existence}} of the Vila inhabitants' property titles, Prefeitura do Rio de Janeiro reduced the original size of the community by 83% using <b>expropriations</b> and eviction <b>orders.</b> Afterwards, following constant clashes against the riot police after resisting evictions, families affected formed a civil society called Viva A Vila Autódromo!. They received consultancy of several Rio de Janeiro universities and organisations of the civil society to elaborate Plano Popular da Vila Autódromo (Popular Plan of Vila Autódromo), a plan of urbanisation that was agreed with the mayor of the city, Eduardo Paes, to give to the village a place with a new urban infrastructure that will include a cultural centre and sportive fields and coexist with the new Olympic infrastructure of suitable way, while being surrounded almost completely by the new Olympic park.|$|R
50|$|Prior to the {{establishment}} of the present airport in Ülemiste area, Lasnamäe Airfield was the primary airport of Tallinn, serving as a base for Aeronaut airline. After Aeronaut went bankrupt in 1928, air service was continued by Deruluft, which used Nehatu instead, 12 km from the centre of Tallinn. The first seaplane harbour on the shores of Lake Ülemiste was built 1928 to 1929 in order to serve Finnish seaplanes. The use of this harbour ended in World War II. On 26 March 1929 Riigikogu passed an <b>expropriation</b> act in <b>order</b> to establish a public airport. 10 ha of land was expropriated from Dvigatel joint-stock company and another 22 ha was expropriated from descendants of Vagner. 10 million sents were paid to land-owners as indemnity. Land leveling and renovation works took another 5 million sents.|$|R
40|$|Commercial {{expropriation}} {{occurs when}} real property is compulsory acquired {{by a private}} operator. This phenomenon is relatively new and has been criticized {{not only because of}} the rules concerning compensation, but also from the point of view of permissibility. An intervention in the protection of property must fulfill the requirement of important public interest set out in RF 2 kap. 15 § in order for it to be allowed. There is no definition regarding what constitutes an important public interest, the only thing that exist is a non-exhaustive list in the preparatory work. This in turn has led to the creation of a broad discretion when it comes to determining what constitutes important public interests. The broad discretion is making it difficult for the courts to reject interventions due to the vague meaning of the requirement. Commercial expropriations are not exempted from the difficulty of determining the meaning of important public interests. What makes commercial expropriation controversial is the fact that it occurs under the same rules that govern communi-ty expropriation, although private operators are driven by profit motives. The problem is the fact that the requirement does not limit the possibilities of making interventions in the protection of property. The necessity of having a requirement without meaning that should limit the possibilities of making interventions can be questioned. The possibility of making all or nothing fit under the requirement can affect legal certainty in a negative way, because it becomes difficult to predict the reasons that may justify <b>expropriation.</b> In <b>order</b> for the requirement to work as a limitation, there must be a clarification concerning its meaning. A first step in that direction is to introduce a clarification in the preparatory work which would render the courts able to determine if the requirement is fulfilled...|$|R
40|$|In {{order to}} prevent and reduce water {{nuisance}} and flooding, {{it should be possible}} to modify water systems and to prevent activities that increase the risk of water nuisance and flooding. The management of water systems needs a set of public law instruments which also enable the actual performance of that management. These public law instruments are provided by the Water Act (Waterwet), the Water Boards Act (Waterschapswet) and the relevant rules and regulations based on these two Acts. This book focuses on the question as to what extent water system managers are able to perform their water assignment using the public law instruments provided by this legislation, and how they can use these instruments in an effective manner. In addition, an analysis is made of possible problems in using these instruments and how they might be solved. The main conclusion of this study is that the water system managers have sufficient and adequate public law instruments at their disposal to carry out their management assignment. For the active management assignment, the Water Act provides for an effective project procedure regarding construction or modification of certain water management structures, which even allows the Provincial Executive to take decisions if municipal bodies refuse to cooperate. If the construction, modification or management of water management structures requires the cooperation of any third parties, the the water system managers have the authority to enforce this cooperation imposing or invoking an obligation to tolerate. When the third party does not want to cooperate they can use the instrument of <b>expropriation.</b> In <b>order</b> to carry out their consolidating management assignment, the water system managers are authorised to regulate the use of water systems in {{order to prevent}} nuisance and flooding. They can therefore adopt a system of exemptions and permits or general rules that apply to activities that may cause the standards to be exceeded. Although the existing public law instruments are generally adequate, this book also includes some recommendations on the subject of legal certainty, efficiency and transparency to improve these instruments to carry out the water management assignment. Carrying out the water management assignment does not just require public law instruments to be adequate, but also that these instruments are actually used. Therefore, it is significant that the division of tasks and powers between the various government authorities that are involved in the water management assignment is clear and that these authorities bring their relevant policies into line. The main recommendations of this study focus on the recognition of the water system manager’s own responsibility to carry out his management assignment and on giving them the necessary public law instruments to actually exercise that responsibility. Other recommendations include: Recognition of the provincial authorities’ crucial role when bringing municipalities’ and Water Boards’ policies in line with their use of public law instruments, and introduction of a strict division between the water system managers’ power to establish generally binding instructions and the municipalities’ power to give generally binding instructions pursuant to the Spatial Planning Act...|$|R
40|$|Tesis (magister en derecho internacional) The recent globalized economy, and the {{substantial}} number of bilateral and multilateral agreements that have been signed, have become a constant incentive to foreign investors willing {{to invest in a}} host State. For its part, the host State is also concerned with investments, specifically with the restraint on its regulatory powers when it is in compliance with its treaties. Many countries today receive a great amount of foreign direct investment (FDI). It is this substantial level of FDI {{that is part of the}} source of the rapid development of countries we see these days. The idea of State expropriation is an act which is recognized in the international plane, which it is established pursuant the public interest and its requirements. The problem arises when the act does not regard a direct taking which is “more noticeable”, but appears certain conducts of the State disguised as “measure pursuant the public interest”, when actually is trying to control or deprive the investor form its peaceful enjoyment of its assets without the proper compensation. I will deal with the different concepts of expropriation, indirect expropriation in its different forms, such as regulatory takings, creeping expropriation, and measures tantamount to <b>expropriation</b> in <b>order</b> to establish how government’s measures take place and harm private owners. I will analyze the current treaties on investment, the principles that can be extracted in today’s BIT and Regional Agreements such as NAFTA, and the main problem of the lack of a concrete definition of expropriation, which today is saved by the principles of international customary law. Then I will analyze the denominator problem, which deals with the dilemma Courts face when determining the extent of damage to the property owner’s assets, which may regard a compensable act of expropriation, the way courts try to define the relevant parcel affected by the government’s measure, and if that harm amounts a damage to the investment, great enough to be compensable, or simply regards a burden, the investor must bear, in order for the State to fulfill the public interest. Finally I will analyze the recent jurisprudence regarding foreign investor claims against outright deprivations by the host State, and the evolution of the diverse concepts and principles extracted of those awards. To summarize I will establish when the State has the legitimacy to affect foreign private property, under what circumstances can do so, when privates have been affected in their property, in a way that entitles them to compensation for the harm caused by the State, when can we talk about expropriation or indirect expropriation of investment (affectation of property at its core and to its periphery), and finally what are the principles that can be extracted through the different treaties signed, the diverse concepts regarding indirect expropriation and of the recent jurisprudence on these muddied matters judges are somewhat reluctant to address in the international plane...|$|R
