40|$|It is {{suggested}} that in a localized remnant of Kalahari sand at Dufuya, central Zimbabwe, groundwater flows in an integrated pattern inherited from the paleochannel network of the underlying gneiss. Contact springs occur at discrete localities along the Kalahari sand/gneiss boundary and are associated with spring sapping and land surface subsidence. Subsidence is presumed {{to be due to}} preferential solute removal by leaching and dissolution as a result of concentration of groundwater flow within the buried paleochannel network and the location of the springs is presumed to occur where the paleochannel network intersects the Kalahari sand/gneiss boundary. Over time the surficial Kalahari sand is preferentially removed along these buried drainage lines by spring sapping and headwards erosion, exposing the gneiss. Multi-electrode direct current resistivity profiling and radar have been used to map the sub-surface, revealing the topography of the basement and nature of the Kalahari cover. Coincidence of gneiss basement depressions with the spring sites, leached sands and subsidence zones suggests inheritance of the gneiss fluvial paleochannel network pattern by the present day groundwater flow. Washed sand and gravel intersected in shallow boreholes in these areas provides further evidentiary support for the concept of <b>inherited</b> <b>drainage...</b>|$|E
50|$|The Royal Commission had {{identified}} one hundred catchment areas, {{based on the}} main rivers of England and Wales. When the Act was published, it contained only 47 catchment areas. This was altered by {{the passing of the}} River Boards Act 1948, which defined thirty-two river board areas, covering almost the whole of England and Wales, and created a River Board for each one. The Boards <b>inherited</b> the land <b>drainage,</b> fisheries and river pollution functions of the catchment boards.|$|R
5000|$|The {{legislation}} made {{provision for}} a [...] "first appointed day", {{on which the}} River Authorities would come into existence, and this was set on 15 October 1964, {{as a result of}} the River Authorities (First Appointed Day) Order 1964. A River Authorities (Second Appointed Day) Order 1964 established 1 April 1965 as the day on which the new authorities would take over the responsibilities of the previous River Boards, which would then cease to exist. The River Boards Act 1948, under which they had been established, was also repealed on that day. Under the new legislation, twenty-seven River Authorities replaced the 32 existing River Boards. As well as <b>inheriting</b> land <b>drainage,</b> fisheries and the prevention of pollution functions, the new authorities were given additional duties to monitor water quality and protect water resources. They thus became responsible for inland waters and the underground strata which existed within their area. The Act made special provision for the River Thames and Lee Conservancy Catchment Boards, enabling them to act as if they were River Authorities and their catchment areas were river authority areas. There was also special provision for parts of London, defined as the London excluded area under section 125 of the Act.|$|R
40|$|The {{preserved}} sedimentary {{expression of}} fluvial successions accumulated in salt-walled mini-basins records the complex history of basin subsidence, {{the style of}} sediment supply, and the pattern of sediment distribution {{in response to a}} range of fluvial processes throughout the evolution of such basins. Temporal and spatial variations in the rate of basin subsidence govern the generation of accommodation space, whereas the rate and style of sediment supply govern how available accommodation is filled; together these parameters act as principal controls that dictate the gross-scale pattern of fluvial sedimentation. Additional factors that influence fluvial stratigraphic architecture in salt-walled mini-basins are: (i) the trend and form of inherited basement lineations and faults that control the geometry, orientation and spacing of salt walls that develop in response to halokinesis; (ii) salt thickness and composition that dictate both the maximum potential basin-fill thickness within a developing mini-basin and the rate of evacuation (migration) of salt from beneath evolving mini-basins, leading to the growth of confining salt walls, uplift of which may generate surface topographic expression that influences fluvial drainage patterns; (iii) climate that dictates fluvial style and the processes by which sediment is distributed; and (iv) the <b>inherited</b> direction of <b>drainage</b> relative to the trend of elongate salt walls and locus of sediment supply that dictates how sediments are distributed both within a single mini-basin and between adjacent basins. Examples of fluvial sedimentary architectures preserved in salt-walled mini-basins from a number of geographic regions are used to illustrate and document the primary controls that influence patterns of fluvial sediment accumulation. The distribution of fluvial architectural elements preserved within mini-basins follows a predictable pattern, both within individual basin depocentres and between adjoining basins: drainage pathways preferentially migrate to topographic lows within basins, such as developing rim-synclines, and away from topographic highs, such as uplifting salt walls or developing turtle-back structures. This paper demonstrates a range of fluvialâ€“halokinetic interactions through consideration of a series of case studies, which demonstrate the current understanding of fluvial response to salt-walled mini-basin evolution and which highlight gaps in the current understandin...|$|R
