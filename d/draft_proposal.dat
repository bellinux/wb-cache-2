5|$|These trans-Neptunian {{objects are}} {{theoretically}} {{large enough to}} be dwarf planets. Dozens more could have been included. Both Quaoar and Orcus have known moons that have allowed the mass of the systems to be determined. Both are more massive than the 5 kg recommendation of the IAU 2006 <b>draft</b> <b>proposal</b> as sufficient for classification as a dwarf planet.|$|E

25|$|In June 2017 a <b>draft</b> <b>proposal</b> by the {{ministry}} of education was approved by Erdoğan, in which the curriculum for schools excluded {{the teaching of the}} theory of evolution of Charles Darwin by 2019. From then on the teaching will be postponed and start at undergraduate level.|$|E
25|$|As {{early as}} in 1934, a <b>draft</b> <b>proposal</b> for an {{additional}} convention {{for the protection of}} the civil population during an armed conflict was adopted by the International Red Cross Conference. Unfortunately, most governments had little interest in implementing this convention, and it was thus prevented from entering into force before the beginning of World War II.|$|E
5000|$|In 2004, {{the various}} sub-committees were {{discussing}} and <b>drafting</b> <b>proposals</b> {{in the following}} areas: ...|$|R
5000|$|Initial <b>draft</b> <b>proposals</b> were {{published}} in July 2008. The committee was expected to make final recommendations by 31 December 2008, but these were delayed, due to legal challenges; and because they didn't assess the potential new authorities in proposals which would have split up the counties between two or more unitaries in aggregate. As a result, a further set of <b>draft</b> <b>proposals</b> {{were published}} in March 2009: ...|$|R
50|$|The {{commission}} submitted their <b>draft</b> <b>proposals</b> in May 1961 {{and made}} the final report in March 1963.|$|R
25|$|In a <b>draft</b> <b>proposal</b> for the 2006 {{redefinition}} of the term, the IAU proposed that a planet {{be defined as}} a body that orbits the Sun that is large enough for gravitational forces to render the object (nearly) spherical. Under this proposal, Charon would have been classified as a planet, because the draft explicitly defined a planetary satellite as one in which the barycenter lies within the major body. In the final definition, Pluto was reclassified as a dwarf planet, but the formal definition of a planetary satellite was not decided upon. Charon is not in the list of dwarf planets currently recognized by the IAU. Had the <b>draft</b> <b>proposal</b> been accepted, even the Moon would be classified as a planet in billions of years when the tidal acceleration that is gradually moving the Moon away from Earth takes it far enough away that the center of mass of the system no longer lies within Earth.|$|E
25|$|In Chicago, Ayers, Hallett and Chapman {{gathered}} a 73-member Chicago School Reform Collaborative Working Group from organizations involved in school reform {{to help them}} draft a proposal, with Hallett's Cross-City Campaign for Urban School Reform donating its headquarters and providing staff support to the Working Group. In June 1994, Ayers and Hallett submitted a <b>draft</b> <b>proposal</b> to Gregorian {{on behalf of the}} Working Group.|$|E
25|$|In March 2015, Professor Stephen Lincoln from South Australian Nuclear Energy Systems {{discussed}} a <b>draft</b> <b>proposal</b> for a $7 billion uranium enrichment facility at Whyalla with the Whyalla News. Residents who were interviewed {{indicated that they}} disagreed with the proposal and were cynical about the Royal Commission. The Council said it would reserve its judgement until after the Commission had presented its findings, with Mayor Jim Pollock expressing personal reservations regarding potential developments of the nuclear industry in the region.|$|E
50|$|The <b>draft</b> <b>proposals</b> {{were made}} public in September 2010. Both are blue ensigns defaced with the {{proposed}} coats of arms.|$|R

50|$|<b>Draft</b> <b>proposals</b> were {{presented}} in December 1965. They were limited in scope and proposed boundary alterations in county boroughs and county districts only.|$|R
25|$|This {{initiative}} {{is supported by}} the U.S. Department of Transportation. The initial charging scenarios considered were presented in public meetings held in December 2008 and the final <b>draft</b> <b>proposal,</b> which calls for implementation of a six-month to one-year trial in 2015, was discussed by the San Francisco Board of Supervisors (SFBS) in December 2010. The SFBS decided to exclude the Southern Gateway scenario and authorized SFCTA to seek federal financing to continue further planning for the two Northeast Cordon options.|$|E
25|$|In SCP a {{statement}} of proposal and {{a summary of the}} Statement of Proposal is a required to go out for community feedback. The draft full document requires not less than one month for public submissions to be sent into council. These submission can be heard in person if the submitter wishes and full council listens and consults on all submissions in making a decision over the <b>draft</b> <b>proposal.</b> Once passed the document is no longer draft and the SCP requirement has been satisfied.|$|E
25|$|In 2010, draft {{legislation}} was proposed to prohibit {{the consumption of}} dog meat. The legislation, however, was {{not expected to be}} enforced, despite making the consumption of dog meat illegal if it passed. In 2010, the first <b>draft</b> <b>proposal</b> of the legislation was introduced, with the rationale to protect animals from maltreatment. The legislation includes a measure to jail people for up to 15 days for eating dog meat. However, certain cultural food festivals continue to promote the meat. For example, in 2014, 10,000 dogs were killed for the Yulin dog eating festival.|$|E
5000|$|The review area {{included}} {{some of the}} smallest (in both area and population) administrative counties in England. <b>Draft</b> <b>proposals</b> were quite radical, as follows ...|$|R

25|$|A {{delegation}} {{from the}} Arab League came to New York {{to try to}} persuade the architects of the UN draft, France and USA, to base it on the Siniora Plan. This, combined with a strong opposition to the existing draft from several of the 15 Council members, especially Qatar, resulted in a change of France's position. In order to avoid a total collapse of the UN efforts to end the hostilities, this eventually led to a substantial revision of the <b>draft</b> <b>proposal</b> (with several re-drafts in between), which included many elements from the Siniora Plan.|$|E
25|$|Impressed by Vivekananda's {{views on}} science and {{leadership}} abilities, Tata wanted him to guide his campaign. Vivekananda endorsed the project with enthusiasm, and Tata, {{with the aim of}} advancing the scientific capabilities of the country, constituted a Provisional Committee to prepare a plan for setting up of an Institute of research and higher education. The committee presented a <b>draft</b> <b>proposal</b> to Lord Curzon on 31 December 1898. Subsequently, Sir William Ramsay, a Nobel Laureate, was called on to propose a suitable place for such an institution who suggested Bangalore as the best location.|$|E
500|$|Caulfield {{prepared}} a twelve-page <b>draft</b> <b>proposal</b> detailing an intelligence-gathering strategy, {{aimed at the}} opposition Democratic Party; he had worked on this draft for several months and presented it to Nixon's staff in September 1971. The proposal, dubbed [...] "Operation Sandwedge", called for a budget of $500,000, primarily to cover private investigative work and security for the Republican National Convention, however Caulfield intimated privately that it would also include electronic surveillance.|$|E
50|$|During the 1970s, <b>draft</b> <b>proposals</b> {{were made}} for an inner relief road to avoid traffic {{congestion}} in the town centre. However, it was rejected in favour of a bypass outside the town.|$|R
50|$|<b>Draft</b> <b>proposals</b> were {{presented}} in October 1965, and were limited in scope. It was proposed that Barrow-in-Furness become a non-county borough, and extensions to {{the boundaries of the}} other county boroughs in the area.|$|R
50|$|That night, Hacker {{does indeed}} {{discover}} the memo in question and, at Annie's urging, rings Sir Humphrey {{to tell him}} — despite it being 2.00am. He also has in his possession Tom Sargent's original <b>draft</b> <b>proposals.</b>|$|R
500|$|The {{definition}} specifically excludes satellites {{from the}} category of dwarf planet, though it does not directly define the term [...] "satellite". In the original <b>draft</b> <b>proposal,</b> an exception was made for Pluto and its largest satellite, Charon, which possess a barycenter outside the volume of either body. The initial proposal classified Pluto–Charon as a double planet, with the two objects orbiting the Sun in tandem. However, the final draft made clear that, {{even though they are}} similar in relative size, only Pluto would currently be classified as a dwarf planet.|$|E
500|$|Eris (then {{known as}} [...] ) was {{discovered}} in January 2005; it {{was thought to be}} slightly larger than Pluto, and some reports informally referred to it as the tenth planet. As a consequence, the issue became a matter of intense debate during the IAU General Assembly in August 2006. The IAU's initial <b>draft</b> <b>proposal</b> included Charon, Eris, and Ceres in the list of planets. After many astronomers objected to this proposal, an alternative was drawn up by Uruguayan astronomer Julio Ángel Fernández: he proposed an intermediate category for objects large enough to be round but which had not cleared their orbits of planetesimals. Dropping Charon from the list, the new proposal also removed Pluto, Ceres, and Eris, because they have not cleared their orbits.|$|E
500|$|The CIPM's <b>draft</b> <b>proposal,</b> {{which was}} an {{extensive}} revision and simplification of the metric unit definitions, symbols and terminology based on the MKS system of units, was put to the 10th CGPM in 1954. In accordance with Giorgi's proposals of 1901, the CIPM also recommended that the ampere be the base unit from which electromechanical would be derived. The definitions for the ohm and volt {{that had previously been}} in use were discarded and these units became derived units based on the metre, ampere, second and kilogram. After negotiations with the CIS and IUPAP, two further base units, the degree kelvin and the candela were also proposed as base units. [...] The full system and name [...] "Système International d'Unités" [...] were adopted at the 11th CGPM.|$|E

A year later, on 27 September 2018, it will be announced which Clusters of Excellence were successful. These will then be funded, for an initial period of seven years, from 2019 onwards. If at least two TUD-Clusters of Excellence are selected, TUD shall be eligible to apply for the second funding line “University of Excellence”, for which the submission of applications is scheduled for mid-December 2018.|$|R

25|$|The Washington State Redistricting Commission {{is charged}} with {{adjusting}} congressional and legislative district boundaries after each decennial census. Given Washington State's growth over the previous decade, Washington gained an additional congressional district for the 113th congress. The third district needed to lose 106,894 people in the redistricting process {{in order to meet}} the ideal population of 672,454. On September 13, 2011, the four voting commissioners on the Redistricting Commission submitted <b>draft</b> <b>proposals</b> for the congressional map. All four <b>draft</b> <b>proposals</b> left the entirety of Lewis, Wahkiakum, Cowlitz, and Clark Counties, and all or most of Skamania county in the 3rd district. In addition, each proposal added population from one or more of Pacific, Thurston, Pierce, or Klickitat counties.|$|R
