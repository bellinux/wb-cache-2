25|$|Although {{the school}} ship was left {{out from the}} Finnish Naval Act of 1927, the Finnish Navy decided to <b>keep</b> <b>looking</b> for a {{suitable}} vessel and purchase it separately from the major fleet renewal program. Over the years, opinions both in favor and against a school ship had been presented, but it was generally agreed that such vessel would be in many ways beneficial for the Finnish Navy. Initially there was also disagreement about the type of the ship — some {{were in favor of}} a modern steam ship {{that could be used in}} the local waters while the others preferred a traditional sailing ship that would teach the cadets traditional seaman skills and bring them closer to merchant mariners. The latter was also recommended by foreign naval officials, and finally the Finnish Navy agreed on a sailing ship. This was further helped by the Wall Street Crash of 1929 that had brought the prices down, and the fact that windjammers had been largely replaced by steam ships.|$|E

500|$|In the UK, BBC DJ John Peel called [...] "Ding Dong" [...] "repetitive and dull" [...] {{and accused}} Harrison of complacency, while the NMEs Bob Woffinden derided Dark Horse as [...] "Just stuff and nonsense", adding: [...] "You <b>keep</b> <b>looking</b> for saving graces, for words of enthusiasm {{to pass on}} – 'Ding Dong', you begin to think, for all its inane lyrics, has some spirit, {{but it really is}} very slight." [...] Harrison's {{standing}} there was not helped by the presence of [...] "I Don't Care Anymore" [...] on the B-side, due to its casual delivery and the literal message in the song title. In a more favourable review, for Melody Maker, Chris Irwin wrote of the single: [...] "We’ve come to expect something with more substance than this glorified nursery rhyme from {{one of the most important}} musicians of the decade. True, it’s catchy with a full chunky sound to bounce it along, but with an undeniable infectiousness of the sort normally associated with chicken pox or measles ... Curiously, records of such banality have a habit of selling in their zillions and this is bound to be a biggie. Hit." ...|$|E
500|$|Like the North American tour, Dark Horse {{was much}} {{maligned}} on release. According to Simon Leng, Harrison's rejection of rock 'n' roll {{tradition and the}} Beatles' legacy during the tour was the cause for the album's unfavourable critical reception; {{in the case of}} [...] "It Is 'He'", Leng continues, this manifested as [...] "outright hostility" [...] from some reviewers, who saw it as [...] "one Krishna paen too many". Bob Woffinden of the NME wrote: [...] "You <b>keep</b> <b>looking</b> for saving graces , for words of enthusiasm to pass on... Tracks like 'It Is HE (Jai Sri Krishna)' are more typical. There, the endless repetition of 'Jai Sri Krishana, Jai Sri Radhe' over an enfeebled tune is hardly compelling listening." [...] Writing for Rolling Stone, Jim Miller opined: [...] " [...] religiosity, once a spacey bauble in the Beatles' panoply, has come to resemble the obsessiveness of a zealot." [...] In a more favourable review, Brian Harrigan of Melody Maker called the song [...] "a bit of a groover" [...] and credited Harrison with the creation of [...] "a new category in music – Country and Eastern".|$|E

He used the opportunity to make new statements about violence in the media and the pornographic [...] "roots" [...] of his crimes. [...] "It happened in stages, gradually", he said. [...] "My experience with ... pornography that deals on a violent level with sexuality, is once you become addicted to it ... I would <b>keep</b> <b>looking</b> for more potent, more explicit, more graphic kinds of material. Until you reach a point where the pornography only goes so far ... where you begin to wonder if maybe actually doing it would give that which is beyond just reading it or looking at it." [...] Violence in the media, he said, [...] "particularly sexualized violence", sent boys [...] "down the road to being Ted Bundys." [...] The FBI, he suggested, should stake out adult movie houses and follow patrons as they leave. [...] "You are going to kill me," [...] he said, [...] "and that will protect society from me. But out there are many, many more people who are addicted to pornography, and you are doing nothing about that." ...|$|E

500|$|Root came {{to realise}} {{that while the}} novel's {{narrative}} style allowed Anne's thoughts to come through, the film adaptation offered comparatively little dialogue. As a result, she [...] "had to cover pages and pages of the story without uttering anything, much of the time. I couldn't even think about technique, I just had to <b>keep</b> <b>looking</b> at the [...] and then somehow radiate the feelings". Persuasion was shot in chronological order, which allowed Root to see [...] "what a difference [...] sense of unhappiness can create", as {{by the end of}} the film Anne is [...] "happier and looks better". Root considered the role to be much quieter than her experiences working with the Royal Shakespeare Company, which included her portrayal of Lady Macbeth. The Irish actor Ciarán Hinds, who depicted Frederick Wentworth, commented that Austen [...] "understands a man's heart and how delicate it can be sometimes". He also appreciated that, though Wentworth was a [...] "competent leader of men in his profession", he was [...] "socially inept" [...] in Anne's presence. Susan Fleetwood, the actress who played Lady Russell, had also worked with Michell on The Buddha of Suburbia. She died soon after filming; Persuasion was her last film role.|$|E
500|$|Coe's {{interpretation}} {{was repeated}} by other scholars {{through the early}} 1990s. In contrast, later researchers said that, while {{the end of the}} 13th b'ak'tun would perhaps be a cause for celebration, it did not mark the end of the calendar. [...] "There is nothing in the Maya or Aztec or ancient Mesoamerican prophecy to suggest that they prophesied a sudden or major change of any sort in 2012," [...] said Mayanist scholar Mark Van Stone. [...] "The notion of a 'Great Cycle' coming to an end is completely a modern invention." [...] In 1990, Mayanist scholars Linda Schele and David Freidel argued that the Maya [...] "did not conceive this {{to be the end of}} creation, as many have suggested." [...] Susan Milbrath, curator of Latin American Art and Archaeology at the Florida Museum of Natural History, stated that, [...] "We have no record or knowledge that [...] would think the world would come to an end" [...] in 2012. Sandra Noble, executive director of the Foundation for the Advancement of Mesoamerican Studies, said, [...] "For the ancient Maya, it was a huge celebration to make it to the end of a whole cycle," [...] and, [...] "The 2012 phenomenon is a complete fabrication and a chance for a lot of people to cash in." [...] "There will be another cycle," [...] said E. Wyllys Andrews V, director of the Tulane University Middle American Research Institute. [...] "We know the Maya thought there was one before this, and that implies they were comfortable with the idea of another one after this." [...] Commenting on the new calendar found at Xultún, one archaeologist said [...] "The ancient Maya predicted the world would continue– that 7,000 years from now, things would be exactly like this. We <b>keep</b> <b>looking</b> for endings. The Maya were looking for a guarantee that nothing would change. It's an entirely different mindset." ...|$|E

2500|$|In February 2004, Putin said: [...] "It is my deep {{conviction}} that {{the dissolution of the}} Soviet Union was a national tragedy on a massive scale.

On the contrary, people have been faced with a host of problems." [...] He went on to say, [...] "Incidentally, at that period, too, opinions varied, including among the leaders of the Union republics. For example, Nursultan Nazarbayev was categorically opposed to the dissolution of the Soviet Union and he said so openly proposing various formulas for preserving the state within the common borders. But, I repeat, all that is in the past. Today we should look at the situation in which we live. One cannot <b>keep</b> <b>looking</b> back and fretting about it: we should look forward." [...] In December 2007, he said in the interview to the Time magazine: [...] "Russia is an ancient country with historical, profound traditions and a very powerful moral foundation. And this foundation is a love for the Motherland and patriotism. Patriotism in the best sense of that word. Incidentally, I think that to a certain extent, to a significant extent, this is also attributable to the American people." ...|$|E
2500|$|Mortaza {{continued}} to struggle for {{form in the}} 2010 Asia Cup, held in June, taking just two wickets in three matches {{at an average of}} 77.00. The coach, Jamie Siddons, commented that [...] "He's going to have to improve a lot on his current form. Unfortunately there's no ready replacement for Mashrafe at the moment, we're hoping his experience will pull him through. We'll <b>keep</b> <b>looking</b> for others and if Mash can't stand up we'll have to replace him." [...] Siddons also noted that since his comeback in 2010, Mortaza's bowling has not been as fast as it used to be. In the one-day leg of the return tour in England in July 2010, Mortaza regain the captaincy of the ODI side. He took over from Shakib Al Hasan who had stepped down after a dip in form. In the second ODI Bangladesh ended their 24-match losing streak; Mortaza led his country to their first victory over England in any form of cricket. However, Bangladesh were unable to seal a series victory and lost 2–1. Mortaza finished as joint-lead wicket-taker for the series with five wickets, equal with England's Ajmal Shahzad. Later the same month, Bangladesh played two ODIs against Ireland, and one against the Netherlands; the team managed only one victory against Ireland. Analysing Bangladesh's performance on the tour, Mortaza noted his concern about the effectiveness of the team's bowling.|$|E
