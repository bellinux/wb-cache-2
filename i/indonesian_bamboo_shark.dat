40|$|Dorsal fins have diverse morphologies across shark species. However, {{little is}} known about the ability of sharks to control fin {{movements}} and the nature of the balance of forces during swimming. White-spotted <b>bamboo</b> <b>sharks,</b> Chiloscyllium plagiosum, and spiny dogfish, Squalus acanthias, are two unrelated species that inhabit different habitats and have strikingly different dorsal fin morphologies. Previous studies that have used a shark model in a wind tunnel have hypothesized that median fins function in stabilization during steady swimming. ^ The dorsal fin anatomy of benthic white-spotted <b>bamboo</b> <b>sharks</b> and benthopelagic spiny dogfish reflects their different swimming habits. White-spotted <b>bamboo</b> <b>sharks</b> live in complex reef habitats and thus have requirements for high maneuverability. Spiny dogfish occupy a variety of coastal and continental shelf habitats and are known to form schools, spending more time in open water environments. Principal component analysis separates these two species in morphospace. <b>Bamboo</b> <b>sharks</b> are characterized by a second dorsal with larger area and proportionally more muscle inserting onto first and second dorsal fins in comparison to spiny dogfish. The two species also differ in the morphology of the skeletal support of the dorsal fin. Basals and radials in spiny dogfish are almost indistinguishable, while radials in <b>bamboo</b> <b>sharks</b> are more numerous and are arranged in two rows of elongate, plate-like elements that articulate with one another. The muscle of the dorsal fin in spiny dogfish is composed of one large muscle mass that extends to all of the proximal radials in spiny dogfish, while in <b>bamboo</b> <b>sharks</b> distinct individual muscle bundles insert onto the ceratotrichia overlying the distal and proximal skeletal elements. ^ During steady swimming, the first dorsal fin in spiny dogfish move independently of the body with larger amplitudes at lower speeds, indicating a stabilizing function. The dorsal fins in <b>bamboo</b> <b>sharks</b> move in synchrony with the trunk, with a larger range of motion than dogfish at both speeds. The first and second dorsal fins of <b>bamboo</b> <b>sharks</b> move laterally in phase with the axial portion of the body, although with larger lateral displacement. ^ Electromyography data shows simultaneous muscle activity on both sides of the first dorsal fin in spiny dogfish which is independent of speed, indicating active stiffening of this fin. The second dorsal fin in spiny dogfish and both dorsal fins in bamboos show alternating muscle activity on each side of the fin, indicating active flapping. Flow acceleration and vortex shedding were identified at the wake of the second dorsal fin in spiny dogfish and both dorsal fins in <b>bamboo</b> <b>sharks</b> using particle image velocimetry. Flow in the wake of the second dorsal was considerably decelerated. These data demonstrate that contrary to the traditional hypothesis, not all dorsal fins function as stabilizers; the first dorsal fin in spiny dogfish contributes to stability while the second dorsal fin, as well as both dorsal fins in <b>bamboo</b> <b>sharks,</b> contribute to thrust production. ^ During maneuvers, the dorsal fin muscles are active on both sides in spiny dogfish and white-spotted <b>bamboo</b> <b>sharks.</b> Spiny dogfish have longer burst duration on the contralateral side, consistent with opposing resistance to the medium. In <b>bamboo</b> <b>sharks,</b> activation might be insufficient to counteract water resistance. The function of the dorsal fins is more flexible and diverse than first thought and might explain the morphological diversity in dorsal fins found among sharks. ...|$|R

25|$|In 2002, two white-spotted <b>bamboo</b> <b>sharks</b> {{were born}} at the Belle Isle Aquarium in Detroit. They hatched 15 weeks after being laid. The births baffled experts as the mother shared an {{aquarium}} with only one other shark, which was female. The female <b>bamboo</b> <b>sharks</b> had laid eggs in the past. This is not unexpected, as many animals will lay eggs {{even if there is}} not a male to fertilize them. Normally, the eggs are assumed to be inviable and are discarded. This batch of eggs was left undisturbed by the curator as he had heard about the previous birth in 2001 in Nebraska and wanted to observe whether they would hatch. Other possibilities had been considered for the birth of the Detroit <b>bamboo</b> <b>sharks</b> including thoughts that the sharks had been fertilized by a male and stored the sperm for a period of time, as well as the possibility that the Belle Isle <b>bamboo</b> <b>shark</b> is a hermaphrodite, harboring both male and female sex organs, and capable of fertilizing its own eggs, but that is not confirmed.|$|R
