40|$|The {{assessment}} of creep damage in structural components has become important {{in order to}} improve the reliability and safety of power stations. In many high-temperature steel creep damage starts with cavity formation. Nondestructive detection of this kind of damage requires techniques which are very sensitive to porosity. The potential of ultrasonic techniques for this purpose is evaluated both theoretically and experimentally. Measurements were performed using service-exposed <b>ferretic</b> material (14 MoV 6 3) as well as austenitic laboratory specimens (Alloy 800 H). Results obtained show that measurements of ultrasonic velocity is a promising technique for characterisation of creep porosity and could possibly be used for the in-service detection of creep damage in components such as pipings at a relatively early stage.

40|$|Ductile {{cast iron}} with {{different}} copper content was precipitation hardened. Cast iron with 0. 48 % Cu content was ferritized. That operation was ended with rapid quenching, and then aged. Cast iron with 1. 27 or 2. 10 % Cu content was spheroid annealing. After rapid quenching cast iron was aged. Not {{alloy cast iron}} with small copper content (0. 04 %) had a chemical composition similar to cast iron with 0. 48 % Cu content. Such copper was for tests {{in order to obtain}} an answer for the question whether only copper is responsible for precipitate hardening effects. Metalographic microscope tests (LM, SEM) of mechanical properties (Rm, Rp, A 5, Z, K and H) and x-ray diffraction tests were performed. It has been stated, that hardening of <b>ferretic</b> cast iron let to obtain tensile strength above 500 MPa and elongation approx. 23 %. Precipitation hardening of ductile cast iron efficiently compensates reducing of hardening caused by partial graphitization and spheroidization of pearlitic cementite...|$|E
40|$|This paper {{presents}} a finite element {{investigation into the}} web crippling strength of cold-formed stainless steel lipped channels with circular web perforations under end-two-flange (ETF) loading. The cases of web openings located both centred and offset to the load bearing plates, are considered. In order {{to take into account}} the influence of the circular web openings, a parametric study involving 2, 190 finite element analyses was performed, covering duplex EN 1. 4462, austenitic EN 1. 4404 and <b>ferretic</b> EN 1. 4003 stainless steel grades; from the results of the parametric study, strength reduction factor equations are determined. The strength reduction factor equations are first compared to equations recently proposed for cold-formed carbon steel lipped channels. It is demonstrated that the strength reduction factor equations proposed for cold-formed carbon steel are conservative for the stainless steel grades by up to 10 %. New coefficients for web crippling strength reduction factor equations are then proposed that can be applied to all three stainless steel grades...|$|E
40|$|Nonlinear {{acoustic}} measurements, {{including the}} generation of higher harmonics caused by nonlinear material behavior, haves {{proven to be a}} useful technique to detect changes in the microstructure of a material, and thus, nondestructively characterize material state. Optical detection of second harmonic Rayleigh waves by means of a heterodyne laser interferometer has advantages over traditional detection techniques such as contact transducers. Laser detection is a non-contact point measurement, which provides absolute readings of the surface displacements and the particle velocity of the Rayleigh surface waves. Frequency or phase modulation of the laser is caused by the Doppler effect on the velocity and displacement amplitudes of a vibrating specimen. This modulation can be recovered with suitable demodulators. This research explores digital demodulation techniques and their effects on higher harmonic measurements. A 9 % Cr <b>ferretic</b> martensitic steel is used to demonstrate the accuracy of the non-contact laser measurement. The results show that the second harmonic increase is hidden in wideband noise for this measurement setup and both, quadrature demodulation and zero-cross detection provide similar results for the amplitude of the first and second harmonic in this experimental arrangement.

40|$|In cold-formed {{stainless}} steel lipped channel-sections, web openings {{are becoming increasingly}} popular. Such openings, however, result in the sections becoming more susceptible to web crippling, especially under concentrated loads applied near the web opening. This paper {{presents the results of}} a finite element parametric study into the effect of circular web openings on the web crippling strength of cold-formed {{stainless steel}} lipped channelsections for the interior-one-flange (IOF) loading condition. This involves a bearing load applied to the top flange of a length of member, away from the end supports. The cases of web openings located centred beneath the bearing load (i. e. beneath the bearing plate delivering the load) and offset to the bearing plate, are considered. Three grades of stainless steel are considered: duplex EN 1. 4462, austenitic EN 1. 4404 and <b>ferretic</b> EN 1. 4003. In total, 2218 finite element models were analyzed. From the results of the parametric study, strength reduction factors for load bearing capacity are determined, where these reduction factors are applied to the bearing capacity calculated for a web without openings, to take account the influence of the web openings. The strength reduction factors are first compared to equations recently proposed for cold-formed carbon steel lipped channel-sections. It is shown that for the case of the duplex grade, the strength reduction factor equations for cold-formed carbon steel are conservative but only by 2 %. However, for the cases of the austentic and ferritic grades, the cold-formed carbon steel equations are around 9 % conservative. New strength reduction factor equations are proposed for all three stainless steel grades...|$|E
