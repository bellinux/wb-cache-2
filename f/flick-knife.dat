50|$|On {{the same}} night, at 4 a.m., while {{walking along the}} beach near the deserted West Pier, she realizes that she is being watched. The man {{watching}} her, a serial killer, thinks he has found his next victim, but when he attacks Bella she stabs him with a <b>flick-knife</b> in the leg.|$|E
50|$|Reflecting {{what the}} hero’s eyes observe, the camera follows those steps, moves backwards, {{and then it}} lurches forward, {{suggesting}} a disquieting outcome of situations of these days, {{like those of the}} September 11. «The boys who live around her tell the same story in a different way. To make that possible, {{all it takes is a}} <b>flick-knife,</b> a handsaw, a broom stick, bamboo canes, floaters from the sardine nets, a few magic tricks».|$|E
5000|$|Jules et Jim is a trip hop / {{drum and}} bass band {{consisting}} of Jean-Marc Lederman (of The Weathermen) and Julianne Regan (of All About Eve). A 1999 press release describing their music reads: [...] "While their sound is eerie, the vocal's in your face. When the voice whispers, the music slashes like a <b>flick-knife.</b> It's warm but chilled, it's groovy while discreet, it's a night record you wanna hear {{when the sun}} comes up." ...|$|E
50|$|There {{are several}} {{implicit}} cross-overs with R. K. Milholland's Something Positive, where Bun-bun is indirectly referred to. Milholland goes {{as far as}} imply that Bun-bun was Aubrey Chorde's bunny {{when she was a}} teen, and stole her <b>flick-knife</b> when she was forced to sell him to Kikis' Petstore by her mother. In an episode of Freefall, wolf engineer Florence has caught a couple of rabbits for dinner; the robot Helix thinks they are intended as pets and names them Kevin (presumably after Kevin Dewclaw in Kevin and Kell) and Bun-Bun. The comic is part of the Create a Comic Project.|$|E
50|$|It {{is illegal}} to carry a knife {{for use as a}} weapon in attack or defense. The only general {{restriction}} is intended use, not the properties of the knife itself (in particular, there is no restriction of blade length, despite popular belief). However, in practice there will be significant leeway for interpretation for police officers and judges - and much will depend on whether an intended use other than as a weapon can be argued - for which the properties of the knife in question will be very relevant (bad: <b>flick-knife,</b> automated, long blade, neck-knife, tactical). So, carrying a knife that has its main use as a weapon will be illegal. In addition, it is not allowed to carry knives in certain places, such as courtrooms, to football matches, etc. Carrying knives is generally very unusual in towns, but not in the countryside.|$|E
