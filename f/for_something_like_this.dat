Webber told [...] The Daily Mail: [...] "The Americans wrote the Russian entry last year. There's no rule to say I can't use a lyricist from anywhere I want. I did approach a couple of British people and both were unavailable. One was a very famous name and Tim Rice didn't want to do it. He said he didn't have the turn of phrase <b>for</b> <b>something</b> <b>like</b> <b>this.</b> Then I thought of Warren. I was staggered when she agreed." [...] Diane Warren also talked about writing the song in an interview for the BBC she said [...] "I don't usually co-write much, I tend to write by myself, so that was quite scary – especially with some like Andrew Lloyd Webber who's a legend!" ...|$|E
2500|$|In 1991, The Offspring {{released}} the Baghdad 7". This EP was {{the turning point}} for the band; due to its success the band signed with Epitaph Records. Thom Wilson, who produced The Offspring's first two albums, {{had been trying to}} get the Offspring to switch to Epitaph, a label run by Bad Religion guitarist Brett Gurewitz. Gurewitz felt that The Offspring was just not quite pronounced enough for his label, but Baghdad convinced him to give the band a shot. Wilson and The Offspring entered the studio again and recorded Ignition. Released in 1992, Ignition exceeded all of the label's and band's expectations. Following the subsequent touring to support Ignition, The Offspring began writing new material for their third album in mid-1993. Recording sessions for Smash took place in January and February 1994 at Track Record in North Hollywood. On the recording process of the album, frontman Dexter Holland told Flux Magazine in 1994, [...] "When we recorded this album, our last one has sold maybe 15,000 copies, so the possibility of us getting played on the radio or anything like that was pretty much nonexistent. Especially because this kind of music is not generally considered acceptable by the mainstream - so, <b>for</b> <b>something</b> <b>like</b> <b>this</b> to happen, it really took us by surprise." ...|$|E

Even more astonishing to the Japanese Army who expected an easy triumph, the Red Army defeated them at the Battle of Khalkhin Gol, which came as a great shock and caused many Japanese generals to lose their bellicosity, if only for a moment. The Japanese Foreign Minister Hachirō Arita regularly met with Cragie and by 22 July 1939 felt that he was winning in his talks. On 26 July 1939, the United States gave the six-month notification that it would not renew the 1911 Treaty of Commerce and Navigation, which increased the amount of economic pressure the British could bring against Japan. The Roosevelt administration had carried its version of appeasement in the Far East, but actions such as the Tientsin incident had persuaded the Americans that Japan was out of control, and the United States needed to start applying economic pressure via such moves like cancelling the 1911 treaty to pressure the Japanese to stop challenging the existing international order in Asia. The Showa Emperor was furious, telling his aide-de-camp Hata Shunroku: [...] "It could be a great blow to scrap metal and oil. Even if we can purchase [...] for the next six months, we will immediately have difficulties thereafter.

Does it reside solely {{in the person}} of The Lieutenant, who gave the order to [...] "waste them"? Or perhaps in the larger military itself, where wars are planned, body counts are calculated, and inconvenient casualties are sometimes scrubbed from the record? Or just maybe the seeds for deeds like My Lai are latent in the very fabric of the human race, {{and once in a while}} the perfect storm of events allows <b>for</b> <b>something</b> terrible <b>like</b> <b>this</b> to happen? ...|$|R

5000|$|In April 2010, an oil rig in the Gulf of Mexico {{owned by}} Transocean and {{operated}} under contract for BP, exploded, {{which led to}} a massive oil spill in a disaster known as the Deepwater Horizon oil spill. At this time, several people around the world, including Mayhem Festival 2010 headliner Korn, decided to boycott BP by not purchasing their fuel. Jonathan Davis, the lead singer of Korn commented, [...] "We need to do our part to let BP know there are consequences <b>for</b> causing <b>something</b> <b>like</b> <b>this.</b> We want {{to send a message to}} corporations like BP so that they will take more preventative measures in the future." [...] Korn will not be using BP, or oil from partnering companies, to fuel their tour buses during upcoming concert dates and also encouraged the other 2010 Mayhem Festival bands to participate in the boycott. Several artists not on the Mayhem Festival later joined in on Korn's boycott, including Disturbed, Rise Against, and Megadeth. Korn's encouragement for Mayhem bands to join the boycott eventually made its way to tour founder Kevin Lyman, who decided the entire festival would not be using BP oil. In a press release, Lyman stated that he is, [...] "encouraging everyone we deal with to find alternative ways to get down the road this summer." ...|$|R

After convincing the citys Redevelopment Authority to donate land for the project, Rev. Sullivan set out to raise the capital needed to build the shopping center. [...] "So I went to the chairman of the bank and I said, I want a construction loan", he recounts. [...] "He said, well Reverend, you need some equity <b>for</b> <b>something</b> <b>like</b> <b>this.</b> Think about it and come back later in two, three or four years, and lets see what we can do." [...] Rev. Sullivan was already prepared for that challenge, however. [...] "Give me the sack", he told Zions treasurer, William Downes. [...] "I opened it up and $400,000 worth of equities came out", he describes. [...] "The mans eye glasses fell off his eyes. He came around the table and took my hand and said, Reverend, we can work together." [...] Rev. Sullivans theory about the power of money to deal with persistent racial inequalities was proving to be correct.
