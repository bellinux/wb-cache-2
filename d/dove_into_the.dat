5|$|The cook {{let go of}} the line. We rowed {{around to}} see if we could not get a line from the chief engineer, and all this time, mind you, there were no shrieks, no groans, but silence, silence and silence, and then the Commodore sank. She lurched to windward, then swung afar back, righted and <b>dove</b> <b>into</b> <b>the</b> sea, and the rafts were {{suddenly}} swallowed by this frightful maw of the ocean. And then by the men on the ten-foot dingy were words said that were still not words—something far beyond words.|$|E
5|$|A {{weather station}} in Norfolk, Virginia {{recorded}} gusts of 3844mph (6171km/h) and 0.17inches (4.31mm) of rainfall. In Cape Henry, sustained winds of 42mph (68km/h) and a precipitation total of 0.02inches (0.5mm) were reported. Coastal sections of southeastern Virginia experienced tides 2.26.1feet (0.61.8m) above normal, resulting in minor tidal flooding. One indirect fatality was attributed from Gladys {{when a man}} suffered fatal wounds to his throat due to flying debris. High winds and strong ocean currents from Gladys produced beach erosion in New Jersey, New York and Massachusetts. In Rhode Island, the outer bands of Gladys produced light rainfall, peaking at 0.38inches (9.6mm). A boy was washed into the sea by the waves offshore Narragansett and was rescued by United States Coast Guard servicemen, who <b>dove</b> <b>into</b> <b>the</b> water after two previous attempts to rescue him failed.|$|E
5|$|That year, the Red Sox won an eventful season {{series against}} the Yankees. A 13-inning {{comeback}} win for the Yankees on July 1 was punctuated by a catch from Derek Jeter, who ran and <b>dove</b> <b>into</b> <b>the</b> stands at full speed and came out with facial lacerations when Trot Nixon hit a pop up in an area deep behind third base. On July 24, Jason Varitek shoved his glove {{into the face of}} the Yankees' Álex Rodríguez after Rodríguez was hit by a pitch from Bronson Arroyo, causing a bench-clearing brawl. Though he was ejected (along with Rodríguez) from the game following the incident, the moment sparked Boston to an 11–10 come-from-behind victory. Both Rodríguez and Varitek were each suspended four games and fined $2,000 for the brawl.|$|E

50|$|The African {{collared}} dove is the species {{thought to be}} the wild ancestor of the domestic Barbary dove, though some suggest the Eurasian {{collared dove}} (Streptopelia decaocto) may also have been involved. The African collared dove is able to hybridise with the Barbary dove, and it is thought that the increase in the range of colours of Barbary doves available that occurred in the later twentieth century {{was the result of the}} importation of African collared <b>doves</b> <b>into</b> <b>the</b> United States for interbreeding.|$|R
5|$|The Ravens {{played the}} Patriots {{for the third}} {{consecutive}} season in the 2012 AFC championship game, which the Ravens lost 23–20. The rivalry reached a new level of friction with this, the second career playoff game between the two clubs. The Ravens clawed to a 20–16 lead in the fourth quarter, but Patriots quarterback Tom Brady <b>dove</b> <b>into</b> <b>the</b> end zone to make the score 23–20 with around 11 minutes remaining; this proved to be the winning touchdown. On the Ravens' last possession of the game, quarterback Joe Flacco threw a pass to wide receiver Lee Evans {{in the corner of the}} end zone which looked to be the game-winning touchdown, before a last-second strip by Sterling Moore forced the ball from the hands of Evans, forcing the game to be decided on a last-minute field goal by Ravens placekicker Billy Cundiff. With 11 seconds remaining on the clock, the kicker missed the 32-yard field goal attempt, allowing the Patriots to kill the clock on their way to Super Bowl XLVI for a rematch with the New York Giants.|$|E
25|$|In 1901, King's roommate {{and best}} friend, Henry Albert Harper, died heroically during a skating party {{when a young}} woman fell through the ice of the partly frozen Ottawa River. Harper <b>dove</b> <b>into</b> <b>the</b> water {{to try to save}} her, and perished in the attempt. King led the effort to raise a {{memorial}} to Harper, which resulted in the erection of the Sir Galahad statue on Parliament Hill in 1905. In 1906, King published a memoir of Harper, entitled The Secret of Heroism.|$|E
25|$|In 1995, a 10-month-old Newfoundland named Boo saved a hearing-impaired {{man from}} {{drowning}} in the Yuba River in Northern California.

The Newfoundland instinctively <b>dove</b> <b>into</b> <b>the</b> river, took the drowning man by the arm, and brought him to safety. According to Janice Anderson, the Newfoundland’s breeder, Boo had received no formal training in water rescue.|$|E

25|$|In 1981, {{after signing}} his first solo career record deal, Osbourne bit the {{head off a}} dove during a meeting with CBS Records {{executives}} in Los Angeles. Apparently {{he had planned to}} release <b>doves</b> <b>into</b> <b>the</b> air as a sign of peace, but due to being intoxicated at the time, he instead grabbed a dove and bit its head off. He then spat the head out, with blood still dripping from his lips. Despite its controversy, the head-biting act has been parodied and alluded to several times throughout his career and is part of what made Osbourne famous.|$|R
25|$|It {{was found}} that {{grappling}} hooks were needed to climb the fort's walls, but despite this and stubborn resistance by the pirates, who defended themselves with rifles, grenades, spears and stones, the Spaniards managed to scale the walls and enter the fort. Some 25 pirates were killed inside, while another 30 or 40 <b>dove</b> <b>into</b> <b>the</b> water and were drowned or killed by the fire from the Spanish feluccas and armed boats. 14 artillery pieces were taken. The Spanish losses amounted to 5 regular soldier and two auxiliaries killed and about 50 wounded, including two colonels, José María Pañarada and Cayetano Figuera.|$|E
25|$|Priscilla Tirado was {{too weak}} to grab the line when the {{helicopter}} returned to her. A watching bystander, Congressional Budget Office assistant Lenny Skutnik, stripped off his coat and boots, and in short sleeves, <b>dove</b> <b>into</b> <b>the</b> icy water and swam out to successfully pull her to shore. The helicopter then proceeded to where Felch had fallen, and paramedic Gene Windsor stepped out onto the helicopter skid and grabbed her by the clothing to lift her onto the skid with him, bringing her to shore. When the helicopter crew returned for Williams, the wreckage he was strapped into had rolled slightly, submerging him—according to the coroner, Williams was the only passenger to die by drowning. His body and those of the other occupants were later recovered.|$|E
25|$|First to {{the scene}} were 116 cadets under the {{direction}} of Lieutenant Commander H. J. Copeland from USS Nantucket, a training ship of the Massachusetts Nautical School (which is now the Massachusetts Maritime Academy), that was docked nearby at the playground pier. They ran several blocks toward the accident. They worked to keep the curious from {{getting in the way of}} the rescuers, while others entered into the knee-deep, sticky mess to pull out the survivors. Soon, the Boston Police, Red Cross, Army, and other Navy personnel arrived. Some nurses from the Red Cross <b>dove</b> <b>into</b> <b>the</b> molasses, while others tended to the injured, keeping them warm and keeping the exhausted workers fed. Many of these people worked through the night. The injured were so numerous that doctors and surgeons set up a makeshift hospital in a nearby building. Rescuers found it difficult to make their way through the syrup to help the victims. Four days elapsed before they stopped searching for victims; many of the dead were so glazed over in molasses, they were hard to recognize.|$|E

25|$|Merchant sailors {{were trained}} {{and used to}} man the {{anti-aircraft}} gun, it fired continually throughout the battle though it misfired a few times because of old ammunition. In fifteen minutes of fighting the Stanvac Calcutta was struck {{several times in the}} bridge and elsewhere, killing Captain Karlsson and a few other men. After hitting the Stier the guards manning the 4-inch gun were reported to have been encouraged and continued firing accurately until shrapnel damaged their weapon. The sights were destroyed but the Americans continued shooting until the ammunition on deck was exhausted. At this time Ensign Anderson ordered two men to retrieve more ammunition from below deck though as soon as they left, Captain Gerlach maneuvered his ship for a torpedo attack. When lined up, Stier fired one torpedo and it <b>dove</b> <b>into</b> <b>the</b> water and headed straight for Stanvac Calcutta where it detonated on the port side. Water began flowing in and the vessel started listing. A number of additional men were killed in the torpedo explosion and when {{it was clear that the}} American ship could not be saved, Ensign Anderson ordered the survivors to abandon ship and he began to lower life rafts.|$|E
25|$|In {{the second}} quarter, Nevada's only points {{came from a}} field goal. Texas Tech drove 68 yards on five plays and scored on a one-yard run by Shannon Woods. The key play was a 50-yard pass from Harrell to Michael Crabtree who ran {{it all the way}} to the one-yard line. On the next Nevada drive, {{defensive}} end Brandon Williams tipped a pass which landed in the hands of defensive tackle Richard Jones. Both teams went scoreless the rest of the half. Nevada received the kickoff to begin the second half and immediately drove the field. Nevada's quarterback Colin Kaepernick <b>dove</b> <b>into</b> <b>the</b> endzone in what appeared to be a touchdown. However, after a lengthy review, the officials agreed that Texas Tech's Daniel Charbonnet forced the ball out of Kaepernick's hands resulting in a touchback. The next Red Raider drive, Mike Leach decided to go for a first down on fourth down, which they failed to make again. Nevada's resulting drive stalled, but they were able to kick a field goal due to good field position after the failed fourth down attempt. The only other points in the third quarter came on Texas Tech's next drive of six plays and 39 yards, scoring on Eric Morris' 13-yard run giving the Red Raiders the lead, 21–12.|$|E
25|$|The Gators {{received}} the opening kickoff and ran {{it back to}} their own 25-yard line. After gaining four yards on three plays, Florida lined up to punt, {{but it was a}} fake and punter Bobby Joe Green ran 30 yards down to the LSU 41-yard line. The Gators went no further than that on three more plays and this time they did punt, pinning LSU at its seven-yard line. From there LSU went three-and-out and Cannon punted down to near midfield. After making it into the LSU red zone, a missed field goal by the Gators gave the ball to LSU at its own 20. Again LSU picked up no yards on three plays and punted. At this point Dietzel sent in the Chinese Bandits, who forced a fumble on their first play on the field and recovered it at the LSU 45. Rabb then led the Tigers down to Florida's 6-yard line as the quarter ended. On the first play of the second quarter Florida was penalized for being offside, giving LSU a first down on the one. The Gators held at the goal-line for three straight runs up the middle, but on fourth down Cannon <b>dove</b> <b>into</b> <b>the</b> endzone for the first score of the game.|$|E
60|$|The {{march was}} resumed, {{and now they}} <b>dove</b> {{straight}} <b>into</b> <b>the</b> interior of the island, which was about {{a mile and a}} half long and half as wide. At some points the path was choked with weeds and trailing vines, and they progressed with difficulty.|$|R

25|$|Nick Saban {{returned}} to Tiger Stadium {{for the first}} time since his tenure as the Miami Dolphins head coach. Alabama entered the game as the No. 1 ranked team in all major polls, and defeated the LSU Tigers 27–21 in overtime. Alabama's offense quickly got the ball moving, as the team marched down to the LSU 26-yard line. John Parker Wilson passed to Earl Alexander, who proceeded to pick up 25-yards before fumbling out of the endzone, resulting in a touchback for the Tigers. On the first LSU possession, the Tigers ran three plays for a loss of seven yards before Alabama safety Rashad Johnson intercepted Jarrett Lee, returning it to the LSU 15-yard line. Glen Coffee moved the ball to the goal line, before John Parker Wilson <b>dove</b> <b>into</b> <b>the</b> endzone two plays later for a 7–0 lead. The Tigers came back to tie the game on their next drive as Jarrett Lee completed a 30-yard touchdown pass to Demetrius Byrd. On the ensuing kickoff, Alabama's Javier Arenas fumbled the ball, which was recovered by Josh Jasper at the Tide's 30-yard line. After a Lee incomplete pass, running back Charles Scott scored on a 30-yard rush, giving LSU a 14–7 lead. After both offenses slowed down, Alabama tied the game after Rashad Johnson intercepted a pass, and returned it for 54-yards and a touchdown to tie the score at 14–14 at the half.|$|E
25|$|Some {{while after}} this, the Doctor was {{captured}} by Marnal, {{one of the few}} surviving Gallifreyans, and accused of destroying Gallifrey. Although Gallifrey had been all but wiped from history by the Doctor's actions, Marnal was able to jury-rig a Time Space Visualiser to witness the Doctor actually push the button as he faced off against the Grandfather, although there were about three minutes between the Doctor firing the shot and Gallifrey's actual destruction where the Doctor's activities in the TARDIS were unaccounted for. Reflecting on his discoveries in the TARDIS, the Doctor, along with the aid of K9 (who had been transported into a hidden area of the TARDIS and trapped there following Gallifrey's destruction) realised that his memory loss hadn't been caused by the trauma of destroying Gallifrey; in fact, the Doctor had wiped his memories to give his mind space to store the contents of the Matrix within his brain, compressed down so he wouldn't be driven mad by the voices of all the dead Time Lords within him, his own memories presumably stored somewhere else in his mind, given his occasional flashes from his past. However, right then, the Doctor had more immediate worries; namely, saving Earth from a species of massive fly-like aliens called the Vore, who would soon have the power to devour the planet. As The Gallifrey Chronicles ended, the Doctor, Fitz, and Trix <b>dove</b> <b>into</b> <b>the</b> Vore mountain, the Doctor equipped with a plan to stop the Vore and save the world.|$|E
25|$|Peterson's father, Nelson Peterson, was {{released}} from prison during the 2006 college football season and was able to watch his son as a spectator {{for the first time on}} October 14, 2006, when Oklahoma played Iowa State. Oklahoma defeated Iowa State in that game; however, on the final drive for the Sooners, Peterson broke his collar bone when he <b>dove</b> <b>into</b> <b>the</b> end zone on a 53-yard touchdown run. During a press conference on October 18, Peterson said he was told by doctors to expect to be out for 4–6 weeks. At the time of the injury, Peterson needed only to gain 150yards to pass Billy Sims as the University of Oklahoma's all-time leading rusher. He was unable to return for the rest of the Sooners' regular season and missed seven games. The Sooners would turn to Allen Patrick, a junior, and Chris Brown, a freshman, to replace Peterson. The team went on a seven-game winning streak including winning the Big 12 Championship game against the Nebraska Cornhuskers. He returned for their last game against Boise State in the 2007 Fiesta Bowl, where he rushed for 77yards and a touchdown. He refused to discuss his plans beyond the end of this season with the press. He concluded his college football career with 1,112 rushing yards his final season, even after missing multiple games due to injury for a total of 4,245 rushing yards (only three seasons). He finished 73yards short of passing Billy Sims as Oklahoma's all-time leading rusher.|$|E
60|$|His aim proved true, {{for when}} he came up he found one rabbit dead. Another had been wounded, as the blood on the snow showed. In all haste he made after the limping game.

But at last it had to give up, and Chet secured the additional game without much trouble.|$|R
25|$|The Four Spirits {{sculpture}} {{was unveiled}} at Birmingham's Kelly Ingram Park in September 2013 {{to commemorate the}} 50th anniversary of the bombing. Crafted in Berkeley, California by Birmingham-born sculptor Elizabeth MacQueen and designed as a memorial to the four children killed on September 15, 1963, the bronze and steel life-size sculpture depicts the four girls {{in preparation for the}} church sermon at the 16th Street Baptist Church in the moments immediately before the explosion. The youngest girl killed in the explosion (Carol Denise McNair) is depicted releasing six <b>doves</b> <b>into</b> <b>the</b> air as she stands tiptoed and barefooted upon a bench as another barefooted girl (Addie Mae Collins) is depicted kneeling upon the bench, affixing a dress sash to McNair; a third girl (Cynthia Wesley) is sat upon the bench alongside McNair and Collins with a Bible in her lap. The fourth girl (Carole Robertson) is depicted standing and smiling as she motions the other three girls to attend their church sermon.|$|R

[...] The result was a broken {{collarbone}} that put him on the sideline {{for the remainder of the}} regular season. During the post-game press conference Stoops said, [...] "the earliest [...] would be ready to play would be a bowl game." [...] This put an end to Peterson's chase of the Oklahoma all-time rushing record; he was 150yards from breaking Billy Sims' mark set in 1979 at the time.|$|E
