Antagonist Anton Brooke is also attracted to her; he kidnaps her a number of times, forcing Nicky to become Sonic and rescue her. In Sonic Adventures, a 1994 two-issue French comic book published by Sir√®ne, Doctor Robotnik (Eggman) uses Amy as bait to lure Sonic. When Sonic, Amy and Tails fall into a pit of lava, they are saved by a giant ring which transports them to a different location.|$|E
5|$|Texas Tech's other mascot, Raider Red, is a {{more recent}} creation. Beginning with the 1971 {{football}} season, the Southwest Conference forbade the inclusion of live animal mascots to away games unless the host school consented. For situations where the host school {{did not want to}} allow the Masked Rider's horse, an alternate mascot was needed. Jim Gaspard, a member of the Saddle Tramps student spirit organization, created the original design for the Raider Red costume, basing it on a character created by cartoonist Dirk West, a Texas Tech alumnus and former Lubbock mayor. Though the Masked Rider's identity is public knowledge, it has always been tradition that Raider Red's student alter <b>ego</b> <b>is</b> kept secret until the end of his or her tenure. The student serving as Raider Red {{is a member of the}} Saddle Tramps or High Riders.|$|E

25|$|The {{highlighting}} of {{the fact}} that corporeity intrinsically has a dimension of expressivity which proves to be fundamental to the constitution of the <b>ego</b> <b>is</b> one of the conclusions of The Structure of Behavior that is constantly reiterated in Merleau-Ponty's later works. Following this theme of expressivity, he goes on to examine how an incarnate subject {{is in a position to}} undertake actions that transcend the organic level of the body, such as in intellectual operations and the products of one's cultural life.|$|E

25|$|Anthroposophy {{describes}} reincarnation {{from the}} point of view of Western philosophy and culture. The <b>ego</b> <b>is</b> believed to transmute transient soul experiences into universals that form the basis for an individuality that can endure after death. These universals include ideas, which are intersubjective and thus transcend the purely personal (spiritual consciousness), intentionally formed human character (spiritual life), and becoming a fully conscious human being (spiritual humanity). Rudolf Steiner described both the general principles he believed to be operative in reincarnation, such as that one's will activity in one life forms the basis for the thinking of the next, and a number of successive lives of various individualities.|$|E
25|$|One of the 'powers' of a Bene Gesserit Reverend Mother is her Other Memory: the {{combined}} ego and memories {{of all her}} female ancestors, passed on through genetic memory, and thus, {{up to the point}} where each following ancestor was born and the physical contact with the mother broken. The ego/memory combination remains a distinct identity within the Reverend Mother's mind, and is able to inject itself into her awareness at appropriate or emotional moments, though the Reverend Mother's <b>ego</b> <b>is</b> always dominant. The prequel novel Dune: The Battle of Corrin by Brian Herbert and Kevin J. Anderson establishes that the first Bene Gesserit to access Other Memory had been Raquella Berto-Anirul, the founder of the order.|$|E

25|$|People with NPD tend {{to exaggerate}} {{their skills and}} accomplishments {{as well as their}} level of {{intimacy}} with people they consider to be high-status. Their sense of superiority may cause them to monopolize conversations and to become impatient or disdainful when others talk about themselves. In the course of a conversation, they may purposefully or unknowingly disparage or devalue the other person by overemphasizing their own success. When they are aware that their statements have hurt someone else, they tend to react with contempt and to view it as a sign of weakness. When their own <b>ego</b> <b>is</b> wounded by a real or perceived criticism, their anger can be disproportionate to the situation, but typically, their actions and responses are deliberate and calculated. Despite occasional flare-ups of insecurity, their self-image is primarily stable (i.e., overinflated).|$|E

25|$|Rider {{learns that}} Worldmind has been {{recruiting}} for the Corps without telling him. When he learns that Ego the Living Planet {{is among the}} new recruits, he becomes enraged and tries to battle Worldmind. As a result, he is stripped of his rank and ejected from the Nova Corps. Because his body has become dependent on the Nova Force, Rider will die if he is without it for too long. As a temporary measure, he borrows the quantum bands from Wendell Vaughn and becomes Quasar. Using his new abilities, Rider rescues the Corps from the War of Kings. <b>Ego</b> <b>is</b> removed as a Centurion and Rider regains his Nova Prime status, but not before {{most of the new}} recruits are slaughtered by the Shi'ar Imperial Guard.

50|$|In {{what came}} to be called the {{structural}} theory, the <b>ego</b> <b>was</b> now a formal component of a three-way system that also included the id and superego. The <b>ego</b> <b>was</b> still organized around conscious perceptual capacities, yet it now had unconscious features responsible for repression and other defensive operations. Freud's ego at this stage was relatively passive and weak; he described it as the helpless rider on the id's horse, more or less obliged to go where the id wished to go.|$|R

25|$|The use of {{the term}} Ego in the Discourses does not follow the Freudian definition, {{although}} generally it refers to the same concept and many parallels can be drawn. Baba makes no mention of the Id or the Super-ego, but only the distinction between the implicit and the explicit ego. The latter finds manifestation in consciousness, whereas the former remains in the subconscious mind. Isolated subconscious tendencies stored in the implicit ego must come to the explicit side {{to take part in a}} conscious process. Yet the explicit <b>ego</b> <b>is</b> very intricately organized and has self-protection mechanisms that act as a repressive barrier to subconscious tendencies. Since spiritual progress requires all subconscious tendencies to gradually pass through the conscious part of the mind and become refined and eventually eliminated, the explicit ego has to be weakened, under certain conditions, to permit this to happen.|$|E
25|$|It is {{in those}} two {{functions}} that the real life of the <b>ego</b> <b>is</b> manifested, but behind them is self-consciousness permanently present, which is always both subjective and objective ‚Äî consciousness of ourselves and of the non-ego. This self-consciousness is the third special form or function of thought ‚Äî which is also called feeling and immediate knowledge. In it we cognize our own inner life as affected by the non-ego. As the non-ego helps or hinders, enlarges or limits, our inner life, we feel pleasure or pain. Aesthetic, moral and religious feelings are respectively produced by the reception into consciousness of large ideas ‚Äî nature, mankind and the world; those feelings are {{the sense of being}} one with these vast objects. Religious feeling therefore is the highest form of thought and of life; in it we are conscious of our unity with the world and God; it is thus the sense of absolute dependence.|$|E
500|$|Fichte {{wrote in}} The Science of Knowledge [...] "The {{question}} has been asked, What was I before I became self-conscious? The answer is, I was not at all, for I was not I. The <b>Ego</b> <b>is</b> only {{in so far as}} it is conscious of itself. ‚Ä¶. The proposition not A is not A will doubtless be recognized by every one as certain, and it is scarcely to be expected that any one will ask for its proof. If, however, such a proof were possible, it must in our system be deduced from the proposition A=A. But such a proof is impossible." ...|$|E

When Jimmy tells Cartman he feels he wrote most of the joke, Cartman fears Jimmy will try to take full credit and asks Kyle for {{advice on how to}} deal with Jimmy. Kyle instead says he believes Jimmy wrote the entire joke, and suggests that Cartman's <b>ego</b> <b>is</b> so big that he subconsciously remembers things incorrectly to make himself feel more important. This is supplemented by Cartman's flashbacks to the creation of the joke, which become more overblown and ridiculous as the episode goes on, showing him to truly believe that he deserves credit.|$|E
