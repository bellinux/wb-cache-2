5|$|Barnes {{was also}} quiet after lunch, and after one {{long period of}} defence, he drove Laker for four through the covers, <b>eliciting</b> a round of ironic applause. The Australian opener responded by placing {{his hand on his}} chest and bowing to the spectators. Barnes had started slowly, but he {{accelerated}} after reaching his half-century. Bradman took two consecutive boundaries from Wright to bring up his fifty. This left Barnes on 96 and Australia at 222/1, half an hour after tea. By this time, the pace of the pitch appeared to have slowed, making batting relatively easy.|$|E
5|$|Once the VIII Corps was at Koblenz, Patton took {{most of its}} {{divisions}} {{away for}} an operation with XII Corps further up the river at Mainz, leaving Middleton with some corps units (mostly artillery) and a single division, the 87th Infantry. Middleton asked Patton if he could take Koblenz with the 87th, <b>eliciting</b> a laugh from the army commander. Middleton pressed him to let him try, and with the commander's approval {{he was able to}} take the city, which only had about 500 defenders.

5|$|Over 90% of the sicklefin lemon shark's diet {{consists}} of bottom- and shore-dwelling teleosts, including herring, mullets, mackerel, silversides, needlefish, smelt-whitings, porgies, sea catfish, triggerfish, parrotfish, and porcupinefish. Occasionally, {{they may also}} take cephalopods and crustaceans, and older individuals {{have been known to}} consume stingrays and guitarfish. This species may be preyed upon by larger sharks. Known parasites include the tapeworms Paraorygmatobothrium arnoldi, Pseudogrillotia spratti, Phoreiobothrium perilocrocodilus, and Platybothrium jondoeorum. Sicklefin lemon sharks have been documented resting on the bottom and <b>eliciting</b> cleanings by bluestreak cleaner wrasses (Labroides dimidiatus), during which they may open their mouths and stop respiring for as long as 150 seconds to give the wrasses access to their mouths and gills.|$|E
40|$|According to folk psychology, {{instrumental}} music regularly <b>elicits</b> emotions in listeners.

40|$|Regional {{blood flow}} was {{measured}} with Doppler ultrasonic probes in anaesthetized rabbits. We used focal microinjections of pharmacological agents to investigate medullary pathways mediating ear pinna vasoconstriction <b>elicited</b> by electrical stimulation of the spinal tract of the trigeminal nerve or by pinching the lip, and pathways mediating mesenteric vasoconstriction <b>elicited</b> by electrical stimulation of the afferent abdominal vagus nerve. Bilateral injection of kynurenate into the rostral ventrolateral medulla reduced arterial pressure and prevented the mesenteric vasoconstriction and the rise in arterial pressure <b>elicited</b> by abdominal vagal stimulation. However, kynurenate did not prevent ear pinna vasoconstriction or the fall in pressure <b>elicited</b> by trigeminal tract stimulation. Similar injections of muscimol also failed to prevent the trigeminally <b>elicited</b> cardiovascular changes. Injections of kynurenate into the raphe–parapyramidal area did not diminish trigeminally <b>elicited</b> ear vasoconstriction or the depressor response. However, injections of muscimol substantially reduced or abolished the trigeminally <b>elicited</b> ear vasoconstriction, without affecting the depressor response. raphe–parapyramidal muscimol injections also entirely abolished ear vasoconstriction <b>elicited</b> by pinching the rabbit's lip. The trigeminal depressor response {{does not depend on}} either the rostral ventrolateral medulla or the raphe–parapyramidal region. Mesenteric vasoconstriction <b>elicited</b> by stimulation of the afferent abdominal vagus nerve is mediated via the rostral ventrolateral medulla, but ear vasoconstriction <b>elicited</b> by lip pinch or by stimulation of the trigeminal tract is mediated by the raphe–parapyramidal region.

5|$|After lunch, Morris was bowled for 62. Bradman joined Barnes and the Australian skipper {{played and}} missed {{a few times}} before {{settling}} down. Barnes responded to his captain's difficulties by manipulating the strike and shielding Bradman from Bedser. The Australian opener had little trouble against the leg trap Bedser set for him, scoring freely into the leg side and taking the shine off the second new ball. Generally however, Barnes also scored sedately after lunch, and after one extended period of defence, he drove Laker for four through the covers, <b>eliciting</b> a round of ironic applause. Barnes responded to the public gallery by placing {{his hand on his}} chest and bowing to the spectators. Barnes had started slowly, but accelerated after reaching his half-century.

5|$|Another {{group of}} {{researchers}} has framed the cause {{in terms of}} social psychology, specifically the self-esteem theory. Beginning with Greenwald and Banaji in 1995, this group states that the name-letter effect results from implicit self-esteem, a person's tendency to evaluate him or herself positively in a spontaneous, automatic, or unconscious manner. Most people like themselves. The halo effect of self-esteem spreads to any attributes associated with the self, including the name and its letters. As early as 1926 Syz discovered that a person's own name is special compared to others, <b>eliciting</b> physical responses measurable on the skin. It is thought that when a person recognizes the letters in his or her name, that person experiences positive feelings of implicit self-esteem. These positive feelings induce subjects to unknowingly select the letters of their own name, producing the name-letter effect.|$|E
5|$|The {{operation}} {{was part of}} a plan drawn up by the JNA aimed at securing the Dubrovnik area and then proceeding north-west to link up with the JNA troops in northern Dalmatia via western Herzegovina. The offensive was accompanied by a significant amount of war propaganda. In 2000, Montenegrin President Milo Đukanović apologized for the siege, <b>eliciting</b> an angry response from his political opponents and from Serbia. The International Criminal Tribunal for the former Yugoslavia (ICTY) convicted two Yugoslav officers for their involvement in the siege and handed a third over to Serbia for prosecution. The ICTY indictment stated that the offensive was designed to detach the Dubrovnik region from Croatia and integrate it into a Serb-dominated state through an unsuccessful proclamation of the Dubrovnik Republic on 24 November 1991. In addition, Montenegro convicted four former JNA soldiers with prisoner abuse at the Morinj camp. Croatia also charged several former JNA or Yugoslav Navy officers and a former Bosnian Serb leader with war crimes but no trials have yet resulted from these indictments.|$|E
40|$|Acquisition of pneumococci is {{generally}} from carriers {{rather than from}} infected individuals. Therefore, to induce herd immunity against Streptococcus pneumoniae {{it will be necessary}} to <b>elicit</b> protection against carriage. Capsular polysaccharide-protein conjugates, PspA, and PsaA are known to <b>elicit</b> some protection against nasopharyngeal carriage of pneumococci but do not always completely eliminate carriage. In this study, we observed that PsaA <b>elicited</b> better protection than did PspA against carriage. Pneumolysin <b>elicited</b> no protection against carriage. Immunization with a mixture of PsaA and PspA <b>elicited</b> the best protection against carriage. These results indicate that PspA and PsaA may be useful for the elicitation of herd immunity in humans. As PspA and pneumolysin are known to <b>elicit</b> immunity to bacteremia and pneumonia, their inclusion in a mucosal vaccine may enable such a vaccine to prevent invasive disease as well as carriage...|$|R
40|$|In this study, we were {{interested}} in how interviewers <b>elicit</b> subjective information in investigations of child abuse (e. g., descriptions of thoughts, emotions, opinions). Sixty-one interviews of children aged 4 - 12 years old were analyzed to determine the amount of subjective information versus non-subjective event details reported, and the type of question that <b>elicited</b> the information. Interviewers <b>elicited</b> more non-subjective than subjective information, although there was more focus on subjective information in the rapport-building phase than in the substantive phase when the allegations were <b>elicited.</b> Interviewer prompts and child responsiveness was congruent such that non-subjective questions <b>elicited</b> more non-subjective information, and subjective interviewer questions <b>elicited</b> more subjective information. The presence of subjective information in children’s testimony can influence children’s credibility, and {{the results of this study}} demonstrate that forensic interviewers play a significant part in the level of subjective information children provide...|$|R
50|$|Semantic {{processing}} {{was measured}} using EEG (ElectroEncephaloGram). Target words <b>elicited</b> an N400 when <b>elicited</b> after semantically unrelated sentences. Likewise, an N400 effect was <b>elicited</b> when target words were preceded by semantically unrelated musical excerpts, showing that music can transfer semantically meaningful information by priming representations of meaningful concepts. The ERPs of the target words showed, as expected, larger N400s when the targets were presented after semantically unrelated sentences compared to those after semantically related sentences. As when preceded by the sentences, the target words also <b>elicited</b> larger N400s when presented after an unrelated musical excerpt compared to when presented after a related excerpt. In both, language and music, both concrete and abstract target words <b>elicited</b> significant N400 effects.|$|R
5|$|After lunch, Australia scored {{slowly as}} Loxton {{struggled}} {{to come to}} grips with the bowling. Yardley took the new ball in an attempt to trouble the batsmen, but instead, Loxton began to settle in as the ball came onto the bat more quickly. He lofted Pollard to the leg side, almost for six, and then hit three boundaries off another over from the same bowler. Harvey accelerated as well, and 80 minutes into the session, reached his century to a loud reception as Australia passed 250. On each occasion, umpire Frank Chester walked to the edge of the playing field and tried to inspect where the ball landed amongst the crowd, trying to see if the point of impact was beyond the original playing arena. They were ruled as sixes in any case and some thought Chester’s actions to be more for theatrical than umpiring purposes. Loxton then dominated the scoring with a display of power hitting. He brought up his 50 by hitting Cranston into the pavilion for six, <b>eliciting</b> spontaneous applause from the English players. It also brought up a century stand, which yielded 105 in only 95 minutes. Harvey was out for 112 from 183 balls, but not before the high run rate during the partnership had helped to swing the match back from England's firm control.|$|E
5|$|In {{what was}} seen to have {{promoted}} anti-incumbency, a scandal regarding campaign finance followed allegation that the Centre Party's Timo Kalli's, who was also {{the head of the}} party's parliamentary group, admission in early May 2009 that he violated the law on reporting electoral campaign financing by not disclosing financial contributions he received for his election campaign during the previous election in 2007. When the media then delved further into the issue, stories started to emerge of common practice with a multitude of MPs not disclosing their financial benefactors, a practice which was not punishable under Finnish law. The media investigations focused on a group of entrepreneurs called Kehittyvien Maakuntien Suomi (Finland of Developing Provinces) who financed the electoral campaigns of numerous high-profile government and opposition candidates. Further investigations revealed that many recipients of their financial support did not register or even mention the amounts they received from the group. Then Prime Minister Matti Vanhanen was {{at the core of the}} accusations after the investigations showed he had also been among the beneficiaries of the groups' financing; this was despite one of the members of the group who had planned to build the biggest shopping mall in the country received Vanhanen's support for the plans against the grain of public opinion, thus <b>eliciting</b> accusations that he could have been influenced by the individual. Blame was also put on the Centre Party's secretary Jarmo Korhonen. This was said to have helped the True Finns.|$|E
5|$|The four spies head to City Hall to warn Mayor West {{about the}} sleeper agent, but they {{discover}} that the mayor is the sleeper agent when Aykroyd inadvertently uses the trigger phrase. During the ensuing fight, Aykroyd plants a homing beacon on Mayor West's leg. West escapes to Russia and the four follow him. They are quickly captured under orders of Prime Minister Vladimir Putin, who explains that the sleeper agent plan would be an embarrassment to their government if revealed to the public. He offers to help them stop West from fulfilling his pre-programmed mission. When the four find West, they see him launch a nuclear missile aimed at the United States before he snaps out of his trance. Mayor West holds himself responsible for America's fate, though Brian comforts him {{with the knowledge that}} West was not in control of his actions, having been brainwashed by the Soviets. Aykroyd realizes that he can hack into the missile's guidance system. This allows him to aim the missile's warhead high above the Earth's atmosphere and harmlessly explode, saving the US.

40|$|Live {{attenuated}} salmonella vaccines generally confer better protection than killed vaccines. The immune {{responses in}} BALB/c mice <b>elicited</b> by immunization {{with a live}} attenuated Aro Salmonella typhimurium vaccine given orally, intravenously or subcutaneously were compared with those <b>elicited</b> by killed whole-cell vaccines (acetone or heat-treated) given subcutaneously. Live vaccines given by all routes <b>elicited</b> higher interleukin- 2 (IL- 2) and interferon-gamma (IFN-gamma) responses in spleen cells against an alkali-treated whole-cell salmonella lysate than did killed vaccines. Live and killed vaccines <b>elicited</b> high total antibody levels to smooth lipopolysaccharide (LPS) (enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay), but all live vaccine regimes <b>elicited</b> higher IgG 2 a, suggesting a Th 1 response. Oral and intravenous vaccination with live organisms <b>elicited</b> IgA against smooth LPS which subcutaneous vaccination with live or killed salmonellae failed to evoke. Western blots using rough whole-cell lysates showed that all vaccines <b>elicited</b> a varied anti-protein response; however, all groups immunized with live organisms recognized three unidentified bands of MW 52, 000, 46, 000 and 18, 000 which were consistently absent in groups immunized with killed organisms.

40|$|Humans {{preferentially}} {{attend to}} negative stimuli. A {{consequence of this}} automatic vigilance for negative valence is that negative words <b>elicit</b> slower responses than neutral or positive words {{on a host of}} cognitive tasks. Some researchers have speculated that negative stimuli <b>elicit</b> a general suppression of motor activity, akin to the freezing response exhibited by animals under threat. Alternatively, we suggest that negative stimuli only <b>elicit</b> slowed responding on tasks for which stimulus valence is irrelevant for responding. To discriminate between these motor suppression and response-relevance hypotheses, we <b>elicited</b> both lexical decisions and valence judgments of negative words and positive words. Relative to positive words (e. g., kitten), negative words (e. g., spider) <b>elicited</b> slower lexical decisions but faster valence judgments. Results therefore indicate that negative stimuli do not cause a generalized motor suppression. Rather, negative stimuli <b>elicit</b> selective responding, with faster responses on tasks for which stimulus valence is response-relevant...|$|R

40|$|Rift Valley fever virus (RVFV) is an arthropod-borne {{phlebovirus}} {{associated with}} abortion storms, neonatal mortality in livestock and hemorrhagic fever or fatal encephalitis in {{a proportion of}} infected humans. Requirement of multiple booster immunizations to maintain the level of protective immunity with the inactivated vaccines {{and the ability of}} live-attenuated vaccines to cause detrimental side-effects are major limitations preventing the widespread use of current vaccines. In this paper, we describe the use of DNA and alphavirus replicon based vaccination approaches to <b>elicit</b> a protective immune response against RVFV. While both vaccines <b>elicited</b> high titer antibodies, DNA vaccination <b>elicited</b> high titer neutralizing antibodies, whereas the replicon vaccine <b>elicited</b> cellular immune responses.
