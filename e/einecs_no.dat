40|$|In {{this report}} maximum {{permissible}} concentration (MPC) and negligible concentration (NC) in water are derived for Ethylene Diamine Tetra Acetic acid (EDTA; CAS No. 64 - 02 - 8, <b>EINECS</b> <b>No.</b> 200 - 573 - 9), based on the EU risk assessment report for this compound. The Maximum Permissible Concentration (MPC) for the water compartment is 2. 2 mg/l, and the Negligible Concentration (NC) is 0. 022 mg/l. Calculation of MPCs for sediment or soil is not possible due to complex speciation of EDTA...|$|E
