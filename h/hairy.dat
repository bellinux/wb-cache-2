5|$|A tall tale was recounted by S.E. Schlosser, {{it states}} that <b>hairy</b> trout {{were the result}} of two bottles or four jugs of spilled hair tonic. To catch <b>hairy</b> trout, {{fisherman}} would act as barbers and lure fish from the waters with the offer of a free trim or shave. An intentionally fantastical story in Maine and claimed <b>hairy</b> trout were under catch and release policy that was enforced by wardens' carrying Brannock Devices. If a fish was caught, the warden would measure it against the fisher's foot. If the fish's length matched the fisher's foot size, the fish could be eaten and the outards made into furry slippers.|$|E
5|$|B.telmatiaea grows as {{an upright}} bush up to 2m (7ft) high.

The leaves have a green upper surface and white <b>hairy</b> undersurface. The new growth is pale brown, later turning green.|$|E
5|$|Lactarius repraesentaneus {{is similar}} in {{appearance}} to Lactarius scrobiculatus, which has latex that turns yellow when exposed to air, a different smell, a stinging flesh and a different reaction of the milk to alkali: in L.scrobiculatus the milk turns reddish-orange while that of L.representaneus does not change color. Lactarius uvidus also has a violet reaction {{but it has a}} different color and is not <b>hairy</b> at the margin of the cap. L.flavidus has a yellowish cap but does not have a <b>hairy</b> margin.|$|E

5|$|The {{bright green}} {{cotyledon}} {{leaves of the}} seedlings are oblong to linear in shape and measure 1.5cm (0.6in) long by 0.3cm (0.1in) wide. The greenish red hypocotyl is <b>hairy,</b> as are the stems of young plants. The <b>hairy</b> seedling leaves are crowded and oppositely arranged. They measure 0.7–1.3cm (0.2–0.5in) in length and have recurved margins. Young plants often begin branching within {{their first year of}} life.|$|E
5|$|The cap {{flesh is}} {{composed}} of two distinct layers: a thin, compact, black-brown and <b>hairy</b> upper layer, and a thick, soft, white to light brown lower layer that is made of thin, thread-like filaments arranged in a roughly parallel fashion. The stem is similarly divided, with a thin, dark and <b>hairy</b> cortical layer covered by hairs, which encircles inner ochre-colored flesh. A drop of potassium hydroxide applied {{to the surface of}} the mushroom will cause it to instantly stain black.|$|E

Yet, downy birch are characterised by <b>hairy</b> leaves and young shoots whereas the same parts on silver birch are hairless. The leaf base of silver birch is usually a right angle to the stalk while for downy birch it is rounded. In terms of genetic structure the trees are quite different but do, however occasionally hybridise.|$|E

He likewise ordered, to move God by continual entreaty, that notice should be given by the bells to call the faithful at midday to aid by their prayers those engaged in battle with the Turk.|$|E
5|$|Areoles are {{structures}} {{unique to}} cacti. Although variable, they typically appear as woolly or <b>hairy</b> {{areas on the}} stems from which spines emerge. Flowers are also produced from areoles. In the genus Pereskia, believed similar to the ancestor of all cacti, the areoles occur in the axils of leaves (i.e. in the angle between the leaf stalk and the stem). In leafless cacti, areoles are often borne on raised areas on the stem where leaf bases would have been.|$|E
