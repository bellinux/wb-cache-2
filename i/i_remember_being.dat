5|$|<b>I</b> <b>remember</b> <b>being</b> in {{the back}} part of the studio, and we were sitting there {{late at night and}} writing. I was strolling through some sounds and came upon a {{particular}} sound from a steel acoustic guitar. I played these really beautiful chord changes that eventually led to 'My All.' She started singing and I started playing, and we came up with the basis for the song. I put a little drum groove down {{and it was one of}} the easier songs to write with her.|$|E
500|$|Game Show Network (GSN) {{acquired}} {{the rights to}} air Press Your Luck in September 2001, and high viewership ratings prompted the network to order {{a revival of the}} series. Two pilots were taped on February 13, 2002: one with original Press Your Luck host Peter Tomarken and the other hosted by Todd Newton. Newton was ultimately chosen to host the show. Tomarken explained that he was asked to change his style of hosting, saying, [...] "It was terribly hurtful and I think I was doomed before I did [...] <b>I</b> <b>remember</b> <b>being</b> told, 'No, no. Be nice. Be sure everybody likes you.' I took that advice with the pilot. I made the same mistake." [...] Tomarken also acknowledged that GSN wanted to employ a younger host in an effort to attract a younger audience.|$|E
500|$|... "Audrey Pauley" [...] {{was written}} by Steven Maeda and {{directed}} by Kim Manners. The entry was Maeda's second ninth season entry after [...] "4-D". The episode features guest star Tracey Ellis as the titular Audrey Pauley. Ellis had previously appeared as a major character in the third season episode [...] "Oubliette". Annabeth Gish later noted that the episode, along with [...] "4-D", were her [...] "two favorite episodes" [...] because they [...] "are stand-alone episodes about Reyes and Doggett. Wonderful acting challenges, and the stories were fantastic." [...] Robert Patrick, whose friend Ted Demme had recently died, was worried about bringing too much emotion onto the set. He later noted, [...] "I was kind of raw. <b>I</b> <b>remember</b> <b>being</b> a little worried about bringing too much emotion to it. I felt safe with Kim; he knew I {{was going through a}} tough time." ...|$|E

500|$|Kemper again {{brought his}} victims {{back to his}} mother's house, this time {{beheading}} them {{in his car and}} carrying a headless corpse into his mother's house to have sex with. He then dismembered the bodies, removed the bullets to prevent identification and, the next morning, discarded their remains. Remains were found at Eden Canyon a week after the murders, and more were found near Highway 1 in March. When questioned in a later interview as to why he removed his victim's head before having sex with the body, he explained: [...] "The head trip fantasies were a bit like a trophy. You know, the head is where everything is at, the brain, eyes, mouth. That's the person. <b>I</b> <b>remember</b> <b>being</b> told as a kid, you cut off the head and the body dies. The body is nothing after the head is cut off... well, that's not quite true, there's a lot left in the girl's body without the head." ...|$|E
500|$|I {{loved my}} drunk scenes. I know {{that may sound}} very strange to people! I got to just let go and just do a down and dirty version of Sue Ellen. It was like, 'Just let me at it and roll those cameras'. <b>I</b> <b>remember</b> <b>being</b> in makeup for 20 minutes, which {{normally}} took two hours. They put some kind of gel in my hair and some very light makeup and I loved it. I said, [...] "Just let me go, please don't edit me, just let me go.'" [...] She added, [...] "It {{was just one of}} those charming, charming, charming times where I just got to blow it out. I just wanted Sue Ellen to be raw unlike any other time in her life, where she was the victim and she was this and she was that; J.R. Ewing would do something and she would react, he would do something and she would have an affair or drink or whatever. This was just like, 'Let me go. Let Sue Ellen out of that box' ...|$|E
500|$|At {{the age of}} 16, Rihanna {{was signed}} to Rogers' and Carl Sturken's {{production}} company, Syndicated Rhythm Productions, who assigned her a lawyer and manager, before the completed demo tape was distributed to various record labels {{around the world in}} late 2004. The first to respond to the demo tape was Jay-Z, who had recently been appointed as president and CEO of Def Jam Recordings. Rihanna auditioned for him and music mogul L.A. Reid in his office. Looking back on the audition and meeting Jay-Z, Rihanna explained in an interview how she felt before walking into the room, saying: [...] "That's when I really got nervous..... I was like: 'Oh God, he's right there, I can't look, I can't look, I can't look!' <b>I</b> <b>remember</b> <b>being</b> extremely quiet. I was very shy. I was cold the entire time. I had butterflies. I'm sitting across from Jay-Z. Like, Jay-Zee. I was star-struck." [...] During the audition, Rihanna performed Whitney Houston's cover of [...] "For the Love of You", as well as [...] "Pon de Replay" [...] and [...] "The Last Time", which were written and produced by Rogers and Sturken and would be included on her debut album Music of the Sun.|$|E

500|$|On April 16, 1953 {{against the}} St. Louis Browns (the second {{game of the}} season, and Chicago's home opener) Pierce pitched his second one-hitter, a 1–0 victory in which he allowed only a seventh-inning double by Bobby Young; the White Sox gained only two singles in the contest, and scored on a walk, {{sacrifice}} hit, error and sacrifice fly. Pierce was chosen to start the All-Star Game for the AL – the first White Sox pitcher ever to do so – and allowed only one hit through three innings (a single by Stan Musial). Boston Red Sox star Ted Williams recalled of the game: [...] "It was a hot day at Crosley Field and <b>I</b> <b>remember</b> <b>being</b> so concerned for little Billy Pierce of the White Sox. Billy probably threw harder than anybody for a guy his size, he had a real big delivery, nice to look at, and he had overcome a lot. I understand he had had epilepsy, and I was really pulling for him. He was a nervous little guy, {{and here he was}} starting his first All-Star game in a bandbox park that's tough to pitch in, and against Robin Roberts to boot. Pierce held them {{in the palm of his}} hand that day. He threw the ball right by everybody." ...|$|E
500|$|Prior to {{signing a}} record deal with Def Jam Recordings, Rihanna was {{discovered}} in her home country of Barbados by American record producer Evan Rogers, who made the necessary arrangements for her to fly to New York. There, she recorded a collection of demos for a demo tape {{to be sent to}} record labels. One of the demos recorded was that of [...] "Pon de Replay", which was written and produced by Carl Sturken, Evan Rogers and Vada Nobles in 2004. The first to respond to the demo tape was Jay-Z, who had recently been appointed as president and CEO of Def Jam Recordings, where Rihanna auditioned for him and music executive L.A.

Initially, Jay-Z was skeptical about signing Rihanna, because he felt [...] "Pon de Replay" [...] was too big for her, saying [...] "when a song is that big, it's hard [...] to come back from. I don't sign songs, I sign artists". [...] "Pon de Replay" [...] was released via iTunes on July 26, 2005, through Def Jam Recordings.|$|E
2500|$|Musically, Skiba has {{cited the}} {{influence}} of fellow Chicago punk bands Screeching Weasel, Pegboy, and Naked Raygun on This Addictions sound. He has also cited {{the influence of}} the Ramones and Social Distortion, saying of the latter that [...] "They've never put out a bad album, in my opinion. <b>I</b> <b>remember</b> <b>being</b> like 'Wow, this sounds like old Social D' [...] It's got that melodic yet melancholic kind of mean guitar lead. It sort of reminds me of Mommy's Little Monster and some of the older stuff and like how psyched I was to hear that." ...|$|E

There {{was a little more}} tension; adults seemed a little more worked up. <b>I</b> <b>remember</b> the visuals too - I was at my grandma’s house and there was this huge old wooden T.V. It was just the lexicon for a while. It was something people referenced pretty easily. That’s the thing about L.A. - it’s still referenced in the actual behaviour people. You see the actual shell-shocked nature of what these things have done to L.A. It sheds a light on a certain character of the environment."

"I {{really feel}} like I haven’t fully {{articulated}} it till now and really spoke candidly till now… When I heard the news about Prince {{and the fact that}} it might have been prescription drug-related, I really had a moment of, like, ‘That’s awful and that’s sad — and I can relate.’ And, unfortunately, 90 percent of the entertainment community can relate. <b>I</b> <b>remember</b> <b>being</b> on the road at, like, 25, touring with theater and doing my own cocktail of Tylenol PM and Xanax.

2500|$|... "The Devil and the Deep Black Void" [...] had an {{interesting}} genesis. <b>I</b> <b>remember</b> <b>being</b> outraged by reports coming from the far east. Vietnamese [...] "boat people" [...] were being preyed on by pirates. I set up a situation where a political upset in a distant colony would make it likely that refugees would be preyed on by pirates. However, the story developed {{a mind of its}} own. I realized that, due to the vastness of space, the pirates would be easy to evade. The real threat was the vastness itself. Running away was certain death, and the only hope was returning to face the original problem. That quickly became the focus of the story… ...|$|E

5000|$|For The Force Awakens, {{director}} J. J. Abrams {{decided to}} approach the choreography similarly to {{how it was done}} in the original trilogy. Abrams stated that the prequel trilogy choreography was [...] "increasingly spectacular and stylised, almost like dance choreography", but that wasn't what they really wanted to go for the new films. He told Empire magazine, [...] "When you look at Star Wars and Empire, they are very different lightsaber battles, but for me they felt more powerful because they were not quite as slick. I was hoping to go for something much more primitive, aggressive and rougher, a throwback to the kind of heart-stopping lightsaber fights <b>I</b> <b>remembered</b> <b>being</b> so enthralled by as a kid." ...|$|R
2500|$|Rugby writers Peter Meares and Maxwell Howell gave {{an account}} of Australia's first 1991 World Cup pool match in Wallaby Legends, [...] "The Pumas made a game of {{it for the first}} twenty minutes, rarely {{allowing}} the Wallabies any possession. Whatever scraps came Australia's way were booted downfield by Michael Lynagh... Campese hadn't touched the ball. The body language said it all. He stood, hands on hips, legs crossed, leaning against a goalpost." [...] Campese later recalled that [...] "...I took a breather at one stage by leaning against a goalpost. <b>I</b> <b>remember</b> <b>being</b> asked how I could do such a thing during an important game.

[...] Irwin thinks {{of himself as a}} fiction writer and refers to himself as a humorist, [...] and states, [...] "I call myself a humorist and storyteller instead of a comedian because I play in libraries and there's no three-drink minimum." [...] Irwin's stories often reflect life in a small Southern town with recurring themes of growing up and growing old, the bonds of family, the complexities of racial relations in the Deep South, especially during the 1960s and the important art of the practical joke.|$|E
