5|$|Boletus edulis fruit bodies contain about 500mg of <b>ergosterol</b> per 100g {{of dried}} mushroom. {{contents}} in some wild and cultivated mushrooms |journal=Food Chemistry |volume=76 |issue=3 |pages=293–98|doi=10.1016/S0308-8146(01)00275-8}} <b>Ergosterol</b> is a sterol compound common in fungi. Additionally, the fruit bodies have about 30mg of <b>ergosterol</b> peroxide per 100g of dried mushroom. <b>Ergosterol</b> peroxide is a steroid derivative {{with a wide}} spectrum of biological activity, including antimicrobial and anti-inflammatory activity, and cytotoxicity to various tumor cell lines grown in laboratory culture.|$|E
5|$|Lactarius sanguifluus {{contains}} {{a mixture of}} sterols. The predominant sterol is <b>ergosterol</b> (56.6% of total sterols), with lesser amounts of <b>ergosterol</b> derivatives, including ergost-7-en-3β-ol, ergosta-7,22-dien-3β-ol, and ergosta-5,7-dien-3β-ol.|$|E
5|$|Two {{derivatives}} of <b>ergosterol</b> {{have been}} {{isolated from the}} fruit bodies of T.plumbeoviolaceus: tylopiol A (3β-hydroxy-8α,9α-oxido-8,9-secoergosta-7,9(11),22-triene) and tylopiol B (3β-hydroxy-8α,9α-oxido-8,9-secoergosta-7,22dien-12-one). These sterols are unique to this species. Additionally, the compounds ergosta-7,22-dien-3β-ol, uridine, allitol, <b>ergosterol,</b> ergosterol5α,8α-peroside, ergothioneine, adenosine, and uracil have been identified from the mushrooms.|$|E
5|$|The triterpenes 3α-carboxyacetoxyquercinic acid, 3α-carboxyacetoxy-24-methylene-23-oxolanost-8-en-26-oic acid, and 5α,8α-epidioxyergosta-6,22-dien-3β-ol (<b>ergosterol</b> peroxide) {{have been}} {{isolated}} from D.confragosa. Lectins from D.confragosa, tested against rabbit and human erythrocytes, {{were determined to}} have anti-H serological specificity.|$|E
5|$|Although it {{is valued}} for its peppery flavor and eaten after {{suitable}} preparation in Russia and Finland, {{the species is}} highly irritating to the digestive system when eaten raw. The toxins, also responsible for the strongly bitter or acrid taste, are destroyed by cooking. Studies have identified several chemicals present in the mushrooms, including <b>ergosterol</b> and derivatives thereof, and the pungent-tasting velleral.|$|E
5|$|Extracts of the puffball {{have strong}} {{antitumor}} activity in mouse models attributable to protein-bound polysaccharides, the compounds calvatan, craniformin, and a tautomer of rubroflavin. Calvatan {{is thought to}} act by stimulating the immune response, rather than by killing cells. Craniformin, originally reported in 1997, is an azoformamide compound. Three sterol compounds have been identified from the fungus: ergosta-4,6,8(14), 22-tetraene-3-one, ergosta-7,22-diene-3-ol, and <b>ergosterol</b> peroxide.|$|E
5|$|Several {{bioactive}} secondary metabolites {{have been}} isolated and identified from Volvariella bombycina fruit bodies, mycelium, or pure culture. The compounds ergosta-4,6,8(14),22-tetraene-3-one, <b>ergosterol</b> peroxide, indole-3-carboxaldehyde, and indazole {{were found in}} liquid culture. In 2009, the novel compound isodeoxyhelicobasidin was identified from culture broth; this compound inhibits the enzyme human elastase. The fungus also produces compounds that have antioxidative activity.|$|E
5|$|Several steroid {{derivatives}} {{have been}} isolated and identified from fruit bodies of L.perlatum, including (S)-23-hydroxylanostrol, <b>ergosterol</b> α-endoperoxide, <b>ergosterol</b> 9,11-dehydroendoperoxide and (23E)-lanosta-8,23-dien-3β,25-diol. The compounds 3-octanone, 1-octen-3-ol, and (Z)-3-octen-1-ol are the predominant {{components of the}} volatile chemicals that give the puffball its odor and flavor. Extracts of the puffball contain relatively high levels of antimicrobial activity against the human pathogenic bacteria Bacillus subtilis, Staphylococcus aureus, Escherichia coli, and Pseudomonas aeruginosa, with an efficiency {{comparable to that of}} the antibiotic ampicillin. These results corroborate an earlier study that additionally reported antibacterial activity against Salmonella enterica serovar Typhimurium, Streptococcus pyogenes, and Mycobacterium smegmatis. Extracts of the puffball have also been reported to have antifungal activity against Candida albicans, C.tropicalis, Aspergillus fumigatus, Alternaria solani, Botrytis cinerea, and Verticillium dahliae. A 2009 study found L.perlatum puffballs to contain the phenolic compound cinnamic acid at a concentration of about 14milligrams per kilogram of mushroom. The fruit bodies contain the pigment melanin.|$|E
5|$|The fruit {{bodies of}} Geastrum triplex have been {{chemically}} analyzed and shown {{to contain a}} number of bioactive compounds, including fungal sterols such as ergosta-4,6,8,(14),22-tetraen-3-one,5,6-dihydroergosterol, <b>ergosterol,</b> and peroxyergosterol. The fungus also contains various fatty acids, notably myristic, palmitic, stearic, oleic, alpha-linolenic, and linoeic acid.|$|E
5|$|The {{species is}} {{widespread}} {{and can be}} found in Asia, Australasia, Europe, and both North and South America. The fungus has a history of use in the traditional medicines of native North America and China. Fruit bodies have been analyzed chemically to determine their lipid content, and various chemical derivatives of the fungal sterol <b>ergosterol</b> have been identified.|$|E
5|$|Extracts of {{the fruit}} body of Ramaria {{botrytis}} {{have been shown to}} favorably influence the growth and development of HeLa cells grown in tissue culture. The mushroom contains nicotianamine, an ACE inhibitor (angiotensin-converting enzyme). Nicotianamine is a metal-chelating compound essential in iron metabolism and utilization in plants. Several sterols have been isolated from the fruit bodies, 5α,6α-epoxy-3β-hydroxy-(22E)-ergosta-8(14),22-dien-7-one, <b>ergosterol</b> peroxide, cerevisterol, and 9α-hydroxycerevisterol, in addition to the previously unknown ceramide (2S,2R,3R,4E,8E)-N-2'-hydroxyoctadecanoyl-2-amino-9-methyl-4,8-heptade-cadiene-1,3-diol.|$|E
5|$|Fruit {{bodies of}} Lactarius torminosus contain {{a number of}} sterols, of which <b>ergosterol</b> (a {{component}} of fungal cell walls) is the most predominant at 60.5% of all sterols, followed by its derivatives and ergosta-5/7-dien-3-ol (17.0%), ergost-7-en-3-ol (13.7%) and ergosta-7-22-dien-3-ol (8.3%). Researchers have identified 28 volatile compounds {{that contribute to the}} odor of the mushroom. Many of these are alcohols and carbonyl compounds with eight carbon atoms; the predominant volatile compound (about 90%) is 1-octen-3-one, an odorant common in mushrooms.|$|E
5|$|Fruit bodies {{contains}} a unique sterol molecule called volemolide, a derivative {{of the common}} fungal sterol <b>ergosterol</b> that may have application in fungal chemotaxonomy. A 2001 study identified a further nine sterols, three of which were previously unknown to science. According to the authors, these types of highly oxygenated compounds—similar to sterols found in marine soft coral and sponges—are rare in fungi. The mushroom also contains volemitol (D-glycero-D-mannoheptitol), a seven-carbon sugar alcohol first isolated from the species by the French scientist Émile Bourquelot in 1889. Volemitol occurs as a free sugar in many plant and brown algal species.|$|E
5|$|Reported {{values of}} the {{composition}} and concentrations of trace metals and minerals in Boletus edulis tend to differ considerably, as the mushroom bioaccumulates different elements to varying degrees, and the element concentration in the fruit bodies is often {{a reflection of the}} element concentration of the soils from which they were picked. In general, B.edulis contains appreciable amounts of selenium (1317 ppm), a trace mineral essential for good health, though the bioavailability of mushroom-derived selenium is low. Whole fruit bodies also contain 4.7μg of vitamin D2 per 100g dry weight. The relatively high <b>ergosterol</b> content (see next section) of the fruit bodies can make the mushroom nutritionally pragmatic for vegetarians and vegans, who would otherwise have a limited intake of vitamin D.|$|E
5|$|Terpenes and isoprenoids, {{including}} the carotenoids, {{are made by}} the assembly and modification of isoprene units donated from the reactive precursors isopentenyl pyrophosphate and dimethylallyl pyrophosphate. These precursors {{can be made in}} different ways. In animals and archaea, the mevalonate pathway produces these compounds from acetyl-CoA, while in plants and bacteria the non-mevalonate pathway uses pyruvate and glyceraldehyde 3-phosphate as substrates. One important reaction that uses these activated isoprene donors is steroid biosynthesis. Here, the isoprene units are joined together to make squalene and then folded up and formed into a set of rings to make lanosterol. Lanosterol can then be converted into other steroids such as cholesterol and <b>ergosterol.</b>|$|E
5|$|The {{composition}} of the volatile flavour compounds of Suillellus luridus consists largely of linoleic acid, with smaller proportions of 1-butanol, 3-methyl-1-butanol, pentadecanoic acid, palmitic acid, linoleic acid methyl ester, and heptadecanoic acid. Pyrazine compounds might {{be responsible for the}} characteristic odour of the dried mushroom. The predominant sterol present in the fruit bodies is <b>ergosterol,</b> with smaller amounts of closely related derivative compounds. The main fatty acids of the mushroom include linoleic acid (53.4% of total fatty acids), oleic acid (24.1%), and palmitic acid (10.2%). Arginine is the free amino acid found in the highest concentration (96.9μM per gram of dry weight), followed by glutamine (9.7) and alanine (8.2).|$|E
5|$|Tylopilus plumbeoviolaceus (formerly Boletus plumbeoviolaceus), {{commonly}} known as the violet-grey bolete, is a fungus of the bolete family. First described in 1936, the mushroom has a disjunct distribution, and is distributed in eastern North America and Korea. The fruit bodies of the fungus are violet when young, but fade into a chocolate brown color when mature. They are solid and relatively large—cap diameter up to , with a white pore surface that later turns pink, and a white mycelium {{at the base of the}} stem. Like most boletes of genus Tylopilus, the mushroom is inedible due to its bitter taste. A number of natural products have been identified from the fruit bodies, including unique chemical derivatives of <b>ergosterol,</b> a fungal sterol.|$|E
5|$|Prized as an {{ingredient}} in various foods, B.edulis is an edible mushroom held in high regard in many cuisines, and is commonly prepared and eaten in soups, pasta, or risotto. The mushroom {{is low in}} fat and digestible carbohydrates, and high in protein, vitamins, minerals and dietary fibre. Although it is sold commercially, {{it is very difficult}} to cultivate. Available fresh in autumn in Central, Southern and Northern Europe, it is most often dried, packaged and distributed worldwide. It keeps its flavour after drying, and it is then reconstituted and used in cooking. B.edulis is one of the few fungi sold pickled. The fungus also produces a variety of organic compounds with a diverse spectrum of biological activity, including the steroid derivative <b>ergosterol,</b> a sugar binding protein, antiviral compounds, antioxidants, and phytochelatins, which give the organism resistance to toxic heavy metals.|$|E
5|$|Sterol lipids, such as {{cholesterol}} and its derivatives, {{are an important}} component of membrane lipids, along with the glycerophospholipids and sphingomyelins. The steroids, all derived from the same fused four-ring core structure, have different biological roles as hormones and signaling molecules. The eighteen-carbon (C18) steroids include the estrogen family whereas the C19 steroids comprise the androgens such as testosterone and androsterone. The C21 subclass includes the progestogens as well as the glucocorticoids and mineralocorticoids. The secosteroids, comprising various forms of vitamin D, are characterized by cleavage of the B ring of the core structure. Other examples of sterols are the bile acids and their conjugates, which in mammals are oxidized derivatives of {{cholesterol and}} are synthesized in the liver. The plant equivalents are the phytosterols, such as β-sitosterol, stigmasterol, and brassicasterol; the latter compound is also used as a biomarker for algal growth. The predominant sterol in fungal cell membranes is <b>ergosterol.</b>|$|E
5|$|Terpenes and isoprenoids {{are a large}} {{class of}} lipids that include the {{carotenoids}} and form the largest class of plant natural products. These compounds are made by the assembly and modification of isoprene units donated from the reactive precursors isopentenyl pyrophosphate and dimethylallyl pyrophosphate. These precursors {{can be made in}} different ways. In animals and archaea, the mevalonate pathway produces these compounds from acetyl-CoA, while in plants and bacteria the non-mevalonate pathway uses pyruvate and glyceraldehyde 3-phosphate as substrates. One important reaction that uses these activated isoprene donors is steroid biosynthesis. Here, the isoprene units are joined together to make squalene and then folded up and formed into a set of rings to make lanosterol. Lanosterol can then be converted into other steroids such as cholesterol and <b>ergosterol.</b>|$|E
5|$|The colour of the L.volemus {{mushroom}} {{varies from}} apricot to tawny, and the cap may {{be up to}} 11cm (in) wide. The pale golden yellow gills {{on the underside of}} the cap are closely spaced and sometimes forked. One of the mushroom's most distinctive features is the large amount of latex ("milk") that it exudes when the gills are damaged, leading to the common names weeping milk cap and voluminous-latex milky. It also has a distinctive fishy smell, which does not affect the taste. The fruit bodies have been chemically analysed and found to contain several sterols related to <b>ergosterol,</b> some of which are unique to this species. The mushroom also contains a natural rubber that has been chemically characterized. Phylogenetic analysis suggests that Lactifluus volemus represents several species or subspecies, rather than a single taxon.|$|E
25|$|A {{number of}} sterol {{compounds}} {{have been identified}} from P.furfuracea, including <b>ergosterol</b> peroxide, <b>ergosterol</b> and lichosterol.|$|E
25|$|As an antifungal, {{ketoconazole}} is structurally {{similar to}} imidazole, and {{interferes with the}} fungal synthesis of <b>ergosterol,</b> a constituent of fungal cell membranes, as well as certain enzymes. As with all azole antifungal agents, ketoconazole works principally by inhibiting the enzyme cytochrome P450 14α-demethylase (CYP51A1). This enzyme participates in the sterol biosynthesis pathway that leads from lanosterol to <b>ergosterol.</b> Lower doses of fluconazole and itraconazole are required to kill fungi compared to ketoconazole, {{as they have been}} found to have a greater affinity for fungal cell membranes.|$|E
25|$|When {{grown in}} liquid culture, the {{mycelium}} of Lactarius deliciosus produces {{a mixture of}} fatty acids and various compounds such as chroman-4-one, anofinic acid, 3-hydroxyacetylindole, <b>ergosterol,</b> and cyclic dipeptides.|$|E
25|$|Synthesis {{of vitamin}} D in nature is {{dependent}} on the presence of UV radiation and subsequent activation in liver and in kidney. Many animals synthesize vitamin D3 from 7-dehydrocholesterol, and many fungi synthesize vitamin D2 from <b>ergosterol.</b>|$|E
25|$|Vitamin D3 (cholecalciferol) is {{produced}} industrially by exposing 7-dehydrocholesterol to UVB light, followed by purification. The 7-dehydrocholesterol {{is a natural}} substance in fish organs, especially the liver, or in wool grease (lanolin) from sheep. Vitamin D2 (ergocalciferol) {{is produced}} {{in a similar way}} using <b>ergosterol</b> from yeast or mushrooms as a starting material.|$|E
25|$|Mushrooms {{can be a}} good dietary {{source of}} vitamin D2 if exposed to {{ultraviolet}} light. Mushrooms contain high concentrations of <b>ergosterol</b> (provitamin D2). Sunlight or ultraviolet radiation (UV) triggers conversion to viosterol (previtamin D2), which then turns into vitamin D2. Low values in mushrooms occur if there is little to no exposure to sunlight or UV light. When fresh mushrooms or dried powders are purposely exposed to artificial sunlight by use of an industrial ultraviolet lamp, vitamin D2 levels can be concentrated to much higher levels.|$|E
25|$|Vitamin D2, or {{ergocalciferol}} {{is found}} in fungus (except alfalfa which is a plantae) and created from viosterol, {{which in turn is}} created when ultraviolet light activates <b>ergosterol</b> (which {{is found in}} fungi and named as a sterol from ergot). Any UV-irradiated fungus including yeast form vitamin D2. Human bioavailability of vitamin D2 from vitamin D2-enhanced button mushrooms via UV-B irradiation is effective in improving vitamin D status and not different from a vitamin D2 supplement according to study. For example, Vitamin D2 from UV-irradiated yeast baked into bread is bioavailable.|$|E
25|$|The yeast form of S. schenckii is {{effectively}} phagocytosed by {{cells of the}} innate immune system and are recognized based on the sugars displayed on their surface or lipids in the yeast cell membrane. Although they are taken up, they are not efficiently killed. It is hypothesized that <b>ergosterol</b> peroxide reacts with and detoxifies reactive oxygen species generated by the respiratory burst used by phagocytes to kill cells they have ingested. S. schenckii is also capable of modulating the immune response to promote its own survival by blocking cytokine production by macrophages.|$|E
25|$|Vitamin D {{comes in}} two forms. Cholecalciferol (vitamin D3) is {{synthesized}} {{in the skin}} after exposure to the sun, or consumed {{in the form of}} animal products; when produced industrially it is taken from lanolin in sheep's wool. Ergocalciferol (vitamin D2) is derived from <b>ergosterol</b> from UV-exposed mushrooms or yeast and is suitable for vegans. Conflicting studies have suggested that the two forms {{may or may not be}} bioequivalent. According to researchers from the Institute of Medicine, the differences between vitamins D2 and D3 do not affect metabolism, both function as prohormones, and when activated exhibit identical responses in the body.|$|E
25|$|Some soil {{bacteria}} {{have been shown}} to have beneficial effects upon the establishment of ectomycorrhizal symbioses. Some of these bacteria, known as Mycorrhiza Helper Bacteria (MHBs), {{have been shown to}} stimulate EcM formation, root and shoot biomass. The presence of higher levels of <b>ergosterol</b> in the soil indicate that MHBs may be promoting fungal growth, as well, thereby generating an increase in mycelial tissue and hyphae capable of exploring greater soil volumes. The mechanisms by which these bacteria stimulate mycorrhizal formation are unclear. However, some mechanistic hypotheses include the softening of cell walls to make root cells more receptive, stimulation of short root formation in plants to allow for a higher probability of encounters with fungal propagules, and mediation of chemical elicitors involved in mutual recognition. However, regardless of mechanism, it is becoming evident that bacteria are more ubiquitous than previously thought and could represent a third component of mycorrhizas (3.4.l).|$|E
25|$|The {{side effects}} of {{ketoconazole}} are sometimes harnessed {{in the treatment of}} non-fungal conditions. While ketoconazole blocks the synthesis of the sterol <b>ergosterol</b> in fungi, in humans, at high dosages (>800mg/day), it potently inhibits the activity of several enzymes necessary for the conversion of cholesterol to steroid hormones such as testosterone and cortisol. Specifically, ketoconazole has been shown to inhibit cholesterol side-chain cleavage enzyme, which converts cholesterol to pregnenolone, 17α-hydroxylase and 17,20-lyase, which convert pregnenolone into androgens, and 11β-hydoxylase, which converts 11-deoxycortisol to cortisol. All of these enzymes are mitochondrial cytochrome p450 enzymes. Based on these antiandrogen and antiglucocorticoid effects, ketoconazole has been used with some success as a second-line treatment for certain forms of advanced prostate cancer and for the suppression of glucocorticoid synthesis in the treatment of Cushing's syndrome. However, in the treatment of prostate cancer, concomitant glucocorticoid administration is needed to prevent adrenal insufficiency. Ketoconazole has additionally been used, in lower dosages, to treat hirsutism and, in combination with a GnRH analogue, male-limited precocious puberty. In any case, the risk of hepatotoxicity with ketoconazole limits its use in all of these indications, especially in those that are benign such as hirsutism.|$|E
500|$|In 2011, {{research}} into the chemistry of P.ellipsoideus {{was published in the}} journal Mycosystema by Cui, along with Hai-Ying Bao and Bao-Kai Liu of the Jilin Agricultural University. The research discussed how several chemical compounds [...] could be isolated from P. ellipsoideus with petroleum ether and (after defatting) chloroform. The nine compounds isolated from these extracts included the common <b>ergosterol</b> and its derivative <b>ergosterol</b> peroxide. Two of the compounds, ergosta-7,22,25-triene-3-one and benzodifuran-3,5-dione-8-methyl formate, were new to science. All of these chemicals were steroidal; such compounds play important physiological roles in cell membranes. P.ellipsoideus {{has been used as a}} source of <b>ergosterol</b> for biochemical research.|$|E
500|$|Steroidal compounds, {{like those}} {{isolated}} from P.ellipsoideus, can have pharmacological or taxonomical applications; for instance, some {{can act as}} anti-inflammatories (including <b>ergosterol)</b> or inhibit tumour growth. The 2011 study concluded that, as P.ellipsoideus contained {{a large number of}} diverse steroidal compounds, there may be comparatively high pharmacological activity in the fungus; however, more research would be needed to confirm this. Later publications echoed this research, claiming that the fungus has [...] "potential medicinal functions". Research published in 2012 named fomitiporiaesterA, a natural furan derivative isolated from methanolic extract of P.ellipsoideus fruit bodies. The chemical, methyl 3,5-dioxo-1,3,5,7-tetrahydrobenzodifuran-4-carboxylate, displayed significant antitumour ability in a mouse model.|$|E
500|$|As a {{widespread}} edible species, Hydnum repandum {{has been the}} subject of several scientific studies determining its nutritional and chemical composition. H.repandum fruit bodies contain 10.7% moisture and 9.2% ash. The organic acid composition includes malic acid (0.31 grams per 100g of mushroom, dry weight) and citric acid (0.65%). [...] One study assessed the proportion of essential amino acids (value expressed as a percentage of the total amino acids): valine, 3.9%; leucine, 14.5%; isoleucine, 3.2%; threonine, 4.4%; methionine, 1%; lysine, 4.2%; phenylalanine, 3.4%; tryptophan, 1.4%. Lipid content is 4.7% (expressed as a percent of dry matter). Major fatty acids include palmitate (15.7%), stearate (0.9%), oleate (26.4%), lineoleate (47.5%), and linolenate (20.3%). The mycosterol content has been recorded as 628 milligrams of <b>ergosterol</b> and 85mg of fungisterol (both values per 100 grams of dry matter).|$|E
2500|$|The {{commonly}} used azole class antifungal drugs work by inhibition of the fungal cytochrome P450 14α-demethylase. This interrupts {{the conversion of}} lanosterol to <b>ergosterol,</b> {{a component of the}} fungal cell membrane. [...] (This is useful only because humans' P450 have a different sensitivity; this is how this class of antifungals work.) ...|$|E
