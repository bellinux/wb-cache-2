Defence expert Dr. Joel Watts testified that Magnotta showed signs of episodic schizophrenia (undifferentiated type), <b>histrionic</b> <b>personality</b> <b>disorder,</b> borderline personality traits and paraphilia not otherwise specified. The prosecution revealed that Magnotta had been using illegal drugs during his teenage years which led to symptoms that mimicked schizophrenia and that Magnotta has been diagnosed with borderline personality disorder by Crown expert Dr. Joel Paris at Jewish General Hospital in Montreal in April 2012. Dr. Renée Roy, the forensic psychiatrist who has been treating Magnotta at Rivières-des-Prairies Detention Centre since November 2012, through his preliminary hearing and right up to the murder trial, diagnosed Magnotta with borderline personality disorder with histrionic features. Dr. Gilles Chamberland, another Crown expert who was not able to interview Magnotta, diagnosed Magnotta with anti-social, histrionic and narcissistic personality disorder. A number of psychiatrists over the years noted that Magnotta displayed antisocial, borderline, histrionic, and narcissistic traits. The prosecution accused Magnotta of pretending to be schizophrenic since his defence pleaded diminished responsibility due to alleged schizophrenia.|$|E
500|$|The {{psychiatrist}} {{became a}} scarecrow attaching psychiatric labels. He is feared, is not confided, is not taken into {{confidence in the}} secrets of one's soul and is asked to provide only medications. Psychiatric labels, or stigmas, have spread so widely {{that there is no}} such thing as the media that does not call a disliked person schizo and does not generalize psychiatric assessments to phenomena of public life. The word psikhushka entered everyday vocabulary. All persons who deviate from the usual standards of thought and behavior are declared mentally ill, with an approving giggling of public. Not surprisingly, during such a stigmatization, people with real mental disorders fear publicity like the plague. Vilnius psychologist Oleg Lapin has the same point that politicians and the press attach psychological, psychiatric and medical labels; he adds that psychiatry has acquired the new status of normalizing life that was previously possessed by religion. Formerly, one could say: you are going against God or God is with us; now one can say: I behave reasonably, adequately, and you do not behave in that way. In 2007, Alexander Dugin, a professor at the Moscow State University and adviser to State Duma speaker Sergei Naryshkin, presented opponents of Vladimir Putin's policy as mentally ill by saying, [...] "There are no longer opponents of Putin's policy, and if there are, they are mentally ill and should be sent to prophylactic health examination."

2500|$|Already in Hitler’s lifetime, some psychiatrists judged {{that such}} a relapse without organic {{explanation}} must be described as an hysterical symptom. The hysteria diagnosis had its greatest popularity with Sigmund Freud's psychoanalysis, but was still in use in the 1930s and 1940s. Loss of the sense organs were among typical symptoms, in addition to self-centered and theatrical behavior. The psychiatrist Karl Wilmanns supposedly said in a lecture: [...] "Hitler has had a hysterical reaction after being buried alive in the field"; Wilmanns then lost his position in 1933. His assistant Hans Walter Gruhle suffered professional disadvantages due to similar statements. In modern psychiatry, the term [...] "hysteria" [...] {{is no longer in}} use; today, corresponding symptoms are rather being associated with dissociative disorder or <b>histrionic</b> <b>personality</b> <b>disorder.</b>|$|E

40|$|OBJECTIVE: To {{examine the}} sociodemographic, behavioral, and {{psychiatric}} correlates of {{cruelty to animals}} in the US. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Data were derived from a nationally representative sample of adults residing in the US Structured psychiatric interviews (N= 43, 093) were completed by trained lay interviewers between 2001 and 2002. Personality, substance use, mood, and anxiety disorders and cruelty to animals were assessed with the Alcohol Use Disorder and Associated Disabilities Interview Schedule (DSM-IV) version. RESULTS: The lifetime prevalence of animal cruelty in US adults was 1. 8 %. Men, African-Americans, Native-Americans/Asians, native-born Americans, persons {{with lower levels of}} income and education and adults living the western region of the US reported comparatively high levels of cruelty to animals, whereas Hispanics reported comparatively low levels of such behavior. Cruelty to animals was significantly associated with all assessed antisocial behaviors. Adjusted analyses revealed strong associations between lifetime alcohol use disorders, conduct disorder, antisocial, obsessive-compulsive, and <b>histrionic</b> <b>personality</b> <b>disorders,</b> pathological gambling, family history of antisocial behavior, and cruelty to animals. CONCLUSIONS: Cruelty to animals is associated with elevated rates observed in young, poor, men with family histories of antisocial behavior and personal histories of conduct disorder in childhood, and antisocial, obsessive-compulsive and <b>histrionic</b> <b>personality</b> <b>disorders,</b> and pathological gambling in adulthood. Given these associations, and the widespread ownership of pets and animals, effective screening of children, adolescents and adults for animal cruelty and appropriate mental health interventions should be deployed...|$|R

5000|$|The {{dimension}} of openness to {{experience of the}} Five-Factor model {{has been criticized for}} not directly relating to any of the major characteristics of <b>personality</b> <b>disorders</b> {{in the same way as}} do the other four dimensions [...] It has been suggested that schizotypal and <b>histrionic</b> <b>personality</b> <b>disorders</b> could be partially characterized by high levels of openness to experience (in the forms of openness to ideas and feelings, respectively) , while obsessive-compulsive, paranoid, schizoid, and avoidant <b>personality</b> <b>disorders</b> can all be conceptualized by extremely low levels of openness [...] However, there is little to no empirical support for this hypothesis, particularly with schizotypal <b>personality</b> <b>disorder.</b> Additionally, the Openness scale of the NEO-PI-R, which is one of the most widely used measures of Big Five traits, was based on research and theory which viewed openness (such as self-actualization and personal growth) as beneficial, so measurement of extreme openness using the NEO-PI-R, is actually a marker of good mental health.|$|R
40|$|Psychiatric {{categories}} in general, and the <b>personality</b> <b>disorders</b> in particular, remain problematic and contested. This is no where more clearly {{evident than in}} the case of the 'antisocial' and 'histrionic' <b>personality</b> <b>disorders.</b> In part, the problem is related to the observation of differences in gender distribution. Men are more likely to be diagnosed 'antisocial' than women, and women are more likely to be diagnosed 'histrionic' than men. Confusion results partly from the suspicion that these categories may be culturally conditioned and therefore spurious as medical labels true in some 'absolute' sense. This paper argues that the antisocial and histrionic disorders have cultural histories, representing (in extreme form) values strongly congruent with familiar cultural stereotypes: the 'independent' male and the 'dependent' female. The process by which these values were delegated to men and women is examined, and then shown to be at least partly determinative of later developments in the formation of psychiatric categories. psychiatric classification antisocial and <b>histrionic</b> <b>personality</b> <b>disorders</b> cultural history...|$|R

Method: A random national sample of psychiatrists and clinical psychologists (N= 203) completed the Therapist Response Questionnaire to identify patterns of therapists' emotional response, and the Shedler-Westen Assessment Procedure- 200 to assess <b>personality</b> <b>disorders</b> and level of psychological functioning in a randomly selected patient currently in their care and with whom they had worked for a minimum of eight sessions and a maximum of 6 months (one session per week). Results: There were several significant relationships between therapists' responses and patients' personality pathology.

40|$|This article {{examines}} the validity of grandiose and vulnerable subtypes of narcissistic character styles through an analysis of <b>personality</b> <b>disorder</b> criteria, interpersonal problems, and adult attachment styles in a nonclinical population. The grandiose personalities in this sample were rated high in the dramatic traits associated with narcissistic, antisocial, and <b>histrionic</b> <b>personality</b> <b>disorders</b> based on a diagnostic interview, and they reported domineering and vindictive interpersonal problems. How-ever, despite the observation of narcissistic personality pathology, they denied interpersonal distress related to their interpersonal problems and the majority reported adult attachment styles reflective of positive self-representations (Secure, Dismissive). Vulnerable narcissistic indi-viduals were represented by high ratings on avoidant personality disor-der based on a diagnostic interview.

50|$|The {{original}} {{purpose of the}} DSM-IV was to provide an accurate classification of psychopathology, not to develop a diagnostic system that will, democratically, diagnose as many men with a <b>personality</b> <b>disorder</b> as women”. However, if the criteria are to serve equally as indicators of disorder {{for both men and}} women, it will be important to establish that the implications of these criteria for functional impairment are comparable for both sexes. Whereas it is plausible that there are gender-specific expressions of these disorders, DSM-IV criteria that function differentially for men and women can systematically over-pathologize or under-represent mental illness in a particular gender. The present study is limited by the investigation of only four <b>personality</b> <b>disorders</b> and the lack of inclusion of additional diagnoses that have also been controversial in the gender bias debate (such as dependent and <b>histrionic</b> <b>personality</b> <b>disorders),</b> although it offers a clearly articulated methodology for studying this possibility. In addition, it provides an examination of a clinical sample of substantial size and uses functional assessments that cut across multiple functional domains and multiple assessment methods. Our results indicate that BPD criteria showed some evidence of differential functioning between genders on global functioning, although there is little evidence of sex bias within the diagnostic criteria for avoidant, schizotypal, or obsessive- compulsive <b>personality</b> <b>disorders.</b> Further investigation and validation across sexes for those disorders would be an important direction of future research.|$|R
