25|$|In 2009 in Sabaki Village, Malindi District, Kenya, a male {{farm manager}} was {{reportedly}} attacked after stepping on a 13-ft python, the exact species {{of which was}} not determined. After an hour's struggle, he was reportedly dragged up a tree, but then rescued by police and villagers after {{he was able to}} call for help on his mobile phone. The snake was reportedly captured by police, but had escaped and disappeared by the next day. The man said he bit the snake's tail while he was being attacked and was injured on <b>his</b> <b>lower</b> <b>lip</b> because the tip of the tail was sharp.|$|E
500|$|Oxbow is a bay horse, {{marked with}} an irregularly shaped white star on his {{forehead}} and white on <b>his</b> <b>lower</b> <b>lip.</b> He is [...] tall. [...] Oxbow was bred by Richard Santulli's New Jersey-based Colts Neck Stables, and foaled in Kentucky at Burleson Farms. His sire is 1998 Breeders' Cup Classic winner Awesome Again, and his dam is Tizamazing, an unraced full sister to the two-time Breeders' Cup Classic winner Tiznow. Oxbow's win in the Preakness Stakes was the first win in a Triple Crown classic race for Santulli's breeding program.|$|E
500|$|Kelly drank a lot; saxophonist Jimmy Heath {{described}} him as [...] "an alcoholic" [...] who [...] "could control his drinking" [...] and not let his playing be affected by it. Kelly was known [...] "for being a very warm, generous human being". Bassist Bill Crow reported that Kelly was [...] "full of fun": [...] "He was often the center of backstage laughing sessions as we told stories on each other. Wynton had a removable upper front denture. While on stage, if he saw some of us standing in the wings listening, he would turn around so the audience couldn't see, give us a stern look, and drop his upper plate forward onto <b>his</b> <b>lower</b> <b>lip,</b> creating a grotesquely comical effect. Sometimes he heightened it by sticking his tongue out at us over his upper teeth." ...|$|E

2500|$|Schmid was a {{short man}} who wore cowboy boots stuffed with {{newspapers}} and flattened cans to make him appear taller.

2500|$|On May 28, 1864, at the Battle of Dallas, {{there was}} at the center of Dawes's {{regiment}} a road leading to Lost Mountain which was left open. It was the evident to Dawes that the Confederates were going to force their way through this road and capture the Union supply trains. Dawes ascertained the Union line could break at this point, so he rushed to the road just as the Confederate advance was within about 50 feet of the Union line which began to waver. During the melee of battle Dawes was struck by a Minié ball on the left side of his lower jaw. It tore off <b>his</b> <b>lower</b> <b>lip</b> and chin so that it hung down, removing almost all his lower teeth and cut his tongue. As he was carried off Dawes managed to scribe in the dust on the carriage floor, [...] "Good for a 60 day furlough?" [...] Dawes subsequently was honorably discharged on October 31, 1864. After months of suffering from this wound, Dawes had his jaw reconstructed by Dr. George Blackman, and finally was restored to health. Despite the serious wound to his jaw, Dawes later went on to become a gifted public speaker.|$|E

40|$|Introduction: Exfoliative cheilitis, {{one of a}} {{spectrum}} of diseases that affect the vermilion border of the lips, is uncommon and has no known cause. It is a chronic superficial inflammatory disorder of the vermilion borders of the lips characterized by persistent scaling; {{it can be a}} difficult condition to manage. The diagnosis is now restricted to those few patients whose lesions cannot be attributed to other causes, such as contact sensitization or light. Case Report: We present a 17 year-old male presented to the out clinic in Baghdad with the chief complaint of a persistent scaly on <b>his</b> <b>lower</b> <b>lips.</b> The patient reported that the skin over the lip thickened gradually over a 3 days period and subsequently became loose, causing discomfort. Once he peeled away the loosened layer, a new layer began to form again. Conclusion: The lack of specific treatment makes exfoliative cheilitis a chronic disease that radically affects a person’s life. The aim {{of this paper is to}} describe a case of recurrent exfoliative cheilitis successfully treated with intralesional corticosteroids and to present possible hypotheses as to the cause...|$|R

40|$|We {{present a}} case of a fifty-year-old male patient who was {{referred}} to the Oral Medicine Department with a complaint of a salty taste. History taking subsequently revealed that the patient was also experiencing intermittent numbness of <b>his</b> left <b>lower</b> <b>lip,</b> tinnitus, and a feeling of fullness in the left ear. Magnetic resonance imaging was performed which revealed a large vestibular schwannoma affecting the left vestibulocochlear nerve, which was treated surgically. This case shows the importance of taking a detailed history in a patient presenting with an initial complaint of oral dysgeusia. It also highlights the possibility of significant underlying pathology, presenting with initial low level, nonspecific complaints such as an altered taste, and the rationale for imaging patients who report unilateral facial hypoesthesia...|$|R

50|$|Ek Chuaj {{can either}} be {{depicted}} as black-and-white striped, as {{he is in the}} Dresden Codex, or entirely black, as he is in the Madrid Codex. Other distinguishing characteristics of Ek Chuaj are his mouth, which is encircled by a red-brown border, <b>his</b> large <b>lower</b> <b>lip,</b> and the presence of two curved lines to the right of his eye. Other depictions of Ek Chuaj show him as an old man with only a single tooth. This is the appearance he most regularly takes in the Madrid Codex. He has been depicted with a pack of goods commonly carried by merchants, and his carrying of a burden is also indicated by the rope or tumpline tied around his head. He may also carry a spear and, in some instances, a scorpion's tail.|$|R

40|$|AbstractThymomas with {{immunodeficiency}} (formerly Good's syndrome) are a rare {{acquired disease}} of combined T- and B-cell immunodeficiency accompanying a thymoma. Recurrent opportunistic infections associated with disorders of both humoral and cell-mediated immunity frequently accompany this rare primary, adult-onset immunodeficiency. This {{is a report}} of {{a case of a}} thymoma with immunodeficiency in a 65 -year-old male patient who developed recurrent oral herpetic infections. He consulted us about recurrent vesiculo-ulcerative lesions on <b>his</b> tongue, <b>lower</b> <b>lip,</b> and buccal mucosa. Results of laboratory examinations indicated hypogammaglobulinemia accompanied by diminished B cells in the peripheral blood, which is consistent with the characteristic features of a thymoma with immunodeficiency. After a diagnosis confirming herpes simplex virus infection, systemic antiviral therapy was administered, which was effective for his vesiculo-ulcerative lesions at follow-up. When an intractable infection accompanied by a thymoma is encountered, increased awareness about the clinical and immunological profiles of this primary immunodeficiency may help in its early diagnosis, thereby preventing mortality...|$|R

30|$|At the <b>lower</b> <b>lip</b> area, the {{regression}} analysis showed that sex, the initial dento-skeletal, and soft tissue morphology were correlated with the horizontal change of the <b>lower</b> <b>lip</b> evaluated at the Li and Ils points. The patients with less ANB angle had less <b>lower</b> <b>lip</b> protrusion after treatment, which {{was consistent with the}} study of Zierhut et al [23]. Additionally, the patients with less lower incisor proclination before treatment seemed to have more <b>lower</b> <b>lip</b> protrusion after treatment. Moreover, patients with less nasolabial and labiomental angles had more <b>lower</b> <b>lip</b> protrusion after treatment. The thickness of the <b>lower</b> <b>lip</b> also {{played an important role in}} <b>lower</b> <b>lip</b> protrusion, which corresponded with the study of Oliver [8] who found a strong correlation between osseous and soft tissue changes in patients with thin lips.
