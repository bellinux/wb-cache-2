40|$|Abstract: Most popular {{polishing}} {{mechanisms for}} optical fibre end-face polishing machines {{are divided into}} three categories: planetary gear trains, linkages, and programmable logic controllers. To prevent the finished product from being scratched, {{it is expected that}} the grind-ing pattern prevents the lapping surface from repeatedly cutting the optical fibre end face in the same direction during the grinding process. For this reason, a polishing machine, whose grinding pad moves according to a Figure- 8 path, is proposed in the present work. A pair of <b>elliptical</b> <b>gears</b> is designed to substitute the anti-parallel four-bar linkage and to drive one point of the coupler link along a Figure- 8 pattern. However, owing the kinematic characteristics of <b>elliptical</b> <b>gears,</b> the velocity of the coupler point is highly variable during its motion, which is disadvantageous to the quality of grinding. Thus, in this study, a pair of non-circular gears is proposed as driving mechanism. By providing the driving elliptical gear with a suitable law of motion, it is possible to enable the velocity of the coupler point to be constant. A kinematic simulation has been performed to prove that the use of non-circular gears is effective in improving the motion characteristics of the Figure- 8 path of motion, which is generated by <b>elliptical</b> <b>gears...</b>|$|E

The stern of this vessel has a particular shape. The propulsive efficiency has been calculated with reference to a situation of steady motion. Correlations between numerical experiments on models and possible full scale application are discussed...|$|E

40|$|In {{this paper}} some {{developments}} concerning {{the possibility of}} generating a rectilinear motion of bodies partially or totally submerged subject to vibration, {{without the use of}} propellers, are presented. The motion is obtained by a device equipped with counterrotating masses installed in the vessel that vibrates along the longitudinal direction. The hull has a suitably shaped stern. The study considers an analysis for evaluating the energy that the propulsion system consumes in relation to its performances. A further objective was to maximize the speed of the system while keeping certain parameters unchanged relating to the equations of motion of the device and suitably allocating the counterrotating masses. This result is obtained by using <b>elliptical</b> <b>gears</b> to transmit the motion from the driving motor to a double pair of counterrotating masses. Such a solution allows us to reach the variability of the angular velocity of the counterrotating masses during each revolution in accordance with certain laws that maximize the thrust applied to the vessel preferentially along a direction in respect of the opposite one, all being equal. Finally, a formulation to compute the propulsive efficiency of the device study and the results of the numerical simulations carried out are illustrated...|$|E

40|$|This paper {{illustrates}} recent advancements {{relative to}} a non-conventional propulsion system for boats {{and is based on}} two previous papers of the author presented at a conference (see Muscia, 2015 a,b). The system does not consider propellers and utilizes the vibration generated by two or more pairs of counter rotating masses. The resultant of the centrifugal forces applies an alternate thrust to the hull that oscillates forward and backward along the longitudinal axis of the boat. The different hydrodynamic drag forces that oppose to the oscillation produce a prevalently forward motion of the vessel. The vibration that causes the motion can be suitably defined to maximize the forward displacement and the efficiency propulsion of the system. This result is obtained by using <b>elliptical</b> <b>gears</b> to rotate the counter rotating masses. The computation of the propulsion efficiency is based on a suitable physical mathematical model. Correlations between numerical experiments on models and possible full scale application are discussed. Some remarks in relation to practical applications and critical issues of the propulsive solution are illustrated. The results have been obtained with reference to a CAD model of a real boat already manufactured whose length is approximately equal to 13 m. Copyright © 2016 Society of Naval Architects of Korea.
