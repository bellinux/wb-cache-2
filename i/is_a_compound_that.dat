25|$|The {{hydrogen}} {{requirement of}} Arrhenius and Brønsted–Lowry was removed by the Lewis definition of acid–base reactions, devised by Gilbert N. Lewis in 1923, {{in the same}} year as Brønsted–Lowry, but it was not elaborated by him until 1938. Instead of defining acid–base reactions in terms of protons or other bonded substances, the Lewis definition defines a base (referred to as a Lewis base) to <b>be</b> <b>a</b> <b>compound</b> <b>that</b> can donate <b>an</b> electron pair, and an acid (a Lewis acid) to <b>be</b> <b>a</b> <b>compound</b> <b>that</b> can receive this electron pair.|$|R

Bismuth subsalicylate <b>is</b> <b>a</b> <b>compound</b> <b>that</b> binds H2S, and one study reported a dose of 524mg {{four times a day}} for 3–7 days bismuth subsalicylate yielded a >95% reduction in faecal H2S release in both humans and rats.|$|E
25|$|Tetraethylammonium (TEA) <b>is</b> <b>a</b> <b>compound</b> <b>that,</b> like {{a number}} of neurotoxins, was first {{identified}} through its damaging effects to the nervous system and shown to have the capacity of inhibiting the function of motor nerves and thus the contraction of the musculature {{in a manner similar}} to that of curare. Additionally, through chronic TEA administration, muscular atrophy would be induced. It was later determined that TEA functions in-vivo primarily through its ability to inhibit both the potassium channels responsible for the delayed rectifier seen in an action potential and some population of calcium-dependent potassium channels. It is this capability to inhibit potassium flux in neurons that has made TEA one of the most important tools in neuroscience. It has been hypothesized that the ability for TEA to inhibit potassium channels is derived from its similar space-filling structure to potassium ions. What makes TEA very useful for neuroscientists is its specific ability to eliminate potassium channel activity, thereby allowing the study of neuron response contributions of other ion channels such as voltage gated sodium channels. In addition to its many uses in neuroscience research, TEA has been shown to perform as an effective treatment of Parkinson's disease through its ability to limit the progression of the disease.|$|E

2500|$|Tetanus neurotoxin (TeNT) [...] <b>is</b> <b>a</b> <b>compound</b> <b>that</b> {{functionally}} reduces inhibitory transmissions in {{the nervous}} system resulting in muscular tetany. TeNT is similar to BTX, and is in fact highly similar in structure and origin; both belonging to the same category of clostridial neurotoxins. Like BTX, TeNT inhibits inter-neuron communication by means of vesicular neurotransmitter (NT) release. One notable {{difference between the two}} compounds is that while BTX inhibits muscular contractions, TeNT induces them. Though both toxins inhibit vesicle release at neuron synapses, the reason for this different manifestation is that BTX functions mainly in the peripheral nervous system (PNS) while TeNT is largely active in the central nervous system (CNS). This is a result of TeNT migration through motor neurons to the inhibitory neurons of the spinal cord after entering through endocytosis. This results in a loss of function in inhibitory neurons within the CNS resulting in systemic muscular contractions. Similar to the prognosis of a lethal dose of BTX, TeNT leads to paralysis and subsequent suffocation.|$|E
