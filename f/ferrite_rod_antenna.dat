5000|$|It is {{important}} to select the right material for the application, as the correct ferrite for a 100 kHz switching supply (high inductance, low loss, low frequency) is quite different to that for an RF transformer or <b>ferrite</b> <b>rod</b> <b>antenna,</b> (high frequency low loss, but lower inductance), and different again from a suppression ferrite (high loss, broadband) ...|$|E
50|$|In modern radios, a ferrite {{loop antenna}} is used, {{consisting}} of fine wire wound on a ferrite rod. Litz wire {{is often used}} to reduce skin effect losses. The ferrite rod increases the magnetic permeability, allowing the physically small antenna to have a larger effective area. Other names for this type of antenna are loopstick antenna, <b>ferrite</b> <b>rod</b> <b>antenna,</b> ferrite rod aerial, Ferroceptor, or ferrod antenna.|$|E

50|$|<b>Ferrite</b> <b>rod</b> aerials (or <b>antennae)</b> are a type {{of small}} {{magnetic}} loop (SML) antenna very common in AM radio broadcast band transistor radios, although they began {{to be used in}} vacuum tube ("valve") radios in the 1950s. They are also useful in very low frequency (VLF) receivers, and can sometimes give good results over most of the shortwave frequencies assuming a suitable ferrite is used). They consist of a coil of wire wound around a <b>ferrite</b> <b>rod</b> core (usually several inches longer than the coil, but sometimes over 3 feet long). This core effectively ‘concentrates’ the magnetic field of the radio waves to give a stronger signal than could be obtained by an air core loop antenna of comparable size, although still not as strong as the signal that could be obtained with a good outdoor wire aerial.|$|R
50|$|Receiving antennas do {{not have}} to be as {{efficient}} as transmitting antennas since in this band the signal to noise ratio is determined by atmospheric noise. The noise floor in the receiver is far below the noise in the signal, so antennas small in comparison to the wavelength, which are inefficient and produce low signal strength, can be used. The most common receiving antenna is the ferrite loopstick antenna (also known as a ferrite rod aerial), made from a ferrite rod with a coil of fine wire wound around it. This antenna is small enough that it is usually enclosed inside the radio case. In addition to their use in AM radios, ferrite antennas are also used in portable radio direction finder (RDF) receivers. The <b>ferrite</b> <b>rod</b> <b>antenna</b> has a dipole reception pattern with sharp nulls along the axis of the rod, so that reception is at its best when the rod is at right angles to the transmitter, but fades to nothing when the rod points exactly at the transmitter. Other types of loop antennas and random wire antennas are also used.|$|E
50|$|The radio {{equipment}} carried on course must {{be capable of}} receiving the signal being transmitted by the five transmitters and useful for radio direction finding. This includes a radio receiver that can tune in the specific frequency of transmission being used for the event, an attenuator or variable gain control, and a directional antenna. Directional antennas are more sensitive to radio signals arriving from some directions than others. Most equipment designs integrate all three components into one handheld device. On the two meter band, the most common directional antennas used by competitors are two or three element Yagi antennas made from flexible steel tape. This kind of antennahas a cardioid receiving pattern, which means that it has one peak direction where the received signal will be the strongest, and a null direction, 180° from the peak, in which the received signal will be the weakest. Flexible steel tape enables the antenna elements to flex and not break when encountering vegetation in the forest. On the eighty meter band, two common receiver design approaches are to use either a small loop antenna or an even smaller loop antenna wound around a ferrite rod. These antennas have a bidirectional receiving pattern, with two peak directions 180° apart from one another and two null directions 180° apart from one another. The peak directions are 90° offset from the null directions. A small vertical antenna element can be combined with the loop or <b>ferrite</b> <b>rod</b> <b>antenna</b> to change the receiving pattern to a cardioid shape, but the resulting null in the cardioid is not as sensitive as the nulls in the bidirectional receiving pattern. A switch {{is often used to}} allow the competitor to select the bidirectional or cardioid patterns at any moment. ARDF receiver equipment is designed to be lightweight and easy to operate while the competitor is in motion as well as rugged enough to withstand use in areas of thick vegetation.|$|E

Only one <b>ferrite</b> <b>rod</b> is required to be inserted in our structure. Firstly, the performances of circulator based on the star-type, circle, and square <b>ferrite</b> <b>rod</b> are compared, showing that the circulator with the star-type <b>ferrite</b> <b>rod</b> performs {{better than the other}} two ones. And then, based on the star-type <b>ferrite</b> <b>rod</b> circulator, four cases of improvement, in which the background rods around the center <b>ferrite</b> <b>rod</b> are replaced respectively by the backward-triangle, forward-triangle, backward-semicircle, and forward-semicircle rods, are investigated to modulate the coupling between the center magneto-optical micro-cavity and the corresponding waveguides. The results show that, with proper parameters, all the four cases can greatly improve the output properties of the circulator, and different cases have its own advantages. The mechanism behind these improvements is also discussed. Finite-element method is used to calculate the characteristics of the circulator and Nelder-Mead optimization method is employed to obtain the optimized parameters. The ideas presented here are useful for designing broadband, low insertion loss, and high-isolation circulators which have potential application in integrated photonic crystal devices.

40|$|Abstract—A {{multi-band}} ferrite-based metamaterial {{has been}} inves-tigated by experiments and simulations. The negative permeability is realized around the ferromagnetic resonance (FMR) frequency {{which can be}} influenced by the saturation magnetization 4 piMs of the fer-rites. Due to having multiple negative permeability frequency regions around the multiple FMR frequencies, the metamaterials consisting of metallic wires and <b>ferrite</b> <b>rods</b> with various 4 piMs possess several passbands in the transmission spectra. The microwave transmission properties of the ferrite-based metamaterials can be not only tuned by the applied magnetic field, but also adjusted by the 4 piMs of the <b>ferrite</b> <b>rods.</b> A good agreement between experimental and simulated results is demonstrated, which confirms that such a ferrite-based metamaterial possesses a tunable multi-band behavior.

40|$|Ever-increasing {{interest}} in millimeter-wave and terahertz spectrum has prompted {{research and development}} of novel passive components working at these frequencies. Compared with the conventional planar components, non-planar dielectric devices become more attractive as frequencies increase due to their higher quality factors and dimensional tolerances. In this thesis, we present fast methods to analyze the millimeter-wave dielectric resonator and <b>rod</b> <b>antenna.</b> First, an analytical method has been developed to evaluate resonant frequencies, quality factors of the Whispering Gallery Mode (WGM) disk resonators and also the resonator-waveguide coupling. A numerical solver based on full-wave finite element method is implemented to verify the analytical result. This analytical model provides a solution for fast design and optimization of WGM resonators in filter and sensor applications. Secondly, a fast analytical approach based on local mode theory is introduced to calculate the radiation from tapered dielectric <b>rod</b> <b>antenna.</b> This efficient approximate model consumes much less computing resources and time, and demonstrates good agreements with full-wave numerical results.
