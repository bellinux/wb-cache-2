5|$|The UK Anime Network had Andy Hanley {{review the}} first four episodes and he {{expressed}} a much more positive outlook than previous reviewers.

Hanley argued that while this pace leaves the series open to being labelled as shallow, it's actually very effective in keeping the viewer engaged.|$|E

Townshend also personally sold fund-raising anti-heroin T-shirts at a series of UK Bruce Springsteen concerts and reportedly financed a trip for former Clash drummer Topper Headon to undergo drug rehabilitation treatment.

25|$|The {{dropping}} of McCosker angered Ian Chappell and {{his teammates}} and I copped the brunt of it. I {{may have been an}} unassuming guy at the time, but I was rudely awakened to the facts of life at test level – thanks, or rather no thanks to Chappell {{and the rest of the}} team. I was not exactly welcomed with open arms into the team. In fact, I was lucky to discover my locker in the Australian dressing rooms. To top it off, Chappell figured that if I was selected to replace McCosker, that's exactly what I would do... at Number 3. I suppose you could say it was an honour to bat ahead of Ian and Greg Chappell in a test. But I have no doubts that certain members of that team wanted me to fail and therefore prove that the selectors had erred. Normally, a new batsman could expect to be cradled into the side and be 'hidden' down the order until he gets the feel of the test atmosphere. There was no such deal for me. I was thrown into the <b>deep</b> <b>end,</b> to sink or swim, and that will live in my memory forever. While I am captain of a team, no batsman will be given the shoddy treatment I received on my test debut.|$|E
500|$|Critical {{response}} to Off the <b>Deep</b> <b>End</b> was generally positive. Many critics praised not only Yankovic's parodies, {{but also his}} originals. Barry Weber, of Allmusic, wrote, [...] "In addition to re-establishing his satirical craftsmanship, <b>Deep</b> <b>End</b> showcases some of Yankovic's best originals ever; [...] "Trigger Happy," [...] "When I Was Your Age," [...] and [...] "You Don't Love Me Anymore" [...] {{prove to be the}} album's greatest songs." [...] Christopher Thelen, of the Daily Vault, wrote, [...] "In fact, it's strange to admit, but the originals on Off The <b>Deep</b> <b>End</b> actually are, at times, stronger than the parodies." [...] In The Rolling Stone Album Guide, Off the <b>Deep</b> <b>End</b> was awarded 3.5 stars out of 5, denoting that the album averaged between good and excellent. Not all reviews were so positive, however. Entertainment Weekly reviewer David Browne noted that the video for Off the <b>Deep</b> <b>End</b> lead single [...] "Smells Like Nirvana" [...] was [...] "an old-fashioned laugh riot", but that half of Yankovic's humor was merely visual, meaning that the songs without videos were not as funny.|$|E
