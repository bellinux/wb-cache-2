25|$|Menstrual cups â€“ A firm, {{flexible}} bell-shaped device worn {{inside the}} vagina {{for about half}} a day or overnight to catch menstrual flow. They are emptied <b>into</b> <b>the</b> <b>toilet</b> or sink when full, washed and re-inserted (washing hands with soap before doing so is crucial). Menstrual cups are usually made of silicone and can last 5 years or longer. At {{the end of the}} period, they are sterilised, usually by boiling in water.|$|E
25|$|The side-float design uses a {{float on}} the end of a lever to control the fill valve. The float is usually shaped like a ball, so the {{mechanism}} is called a ball-valve or a ballcock. Cock is a term for valve; see, for example, stopcock. The float was originally made from copper sheet, but it is now usually plastic. The float is located to one side of the main valve tower at the end of a rod or arm. As the side-float rises, so does the side-float-arm. The arm connects to the fill valve that blocks the water flow <b>into</b> <b>the</b> <b>toilet</b> tank, and thus maintains a constant level in the tank.|$|E
50|$|Generally <b>the</b> <b>toilet</b> brush is {{used with}} toilet cleaner or bleach. <b>The</b> <b>toilet</b> brush {{can be used}} to clean the upper area of <b>the</b> <b>toilet,</b> around <b>the</b> bowl.

He joined up with I.O. again and was placed undercover in the group of the Puritans, a high-tech fanatical organisation.|$|R
25|$|Some {{flushometer}} models {{require the}} user to either depress a lever or press a button, which in turn opens a flush valve allowing mains-pressure water to flow directly <b>into</b> <b>the</b> <b>toilet</b> bowl or urinal. Other flushometer models are electronically triggered, using an infrared sensor to initiate the flushing process. Typically, on electronically triggered models, an override button is provided in case the user wishes to manually trigger flushing earlier. Some electronically triggered models also incorporate a true mechanical manual override {{which can be used}} in the event of the failure of the electronic system. In retrofit installations, a self-contained battery-powered or hard-wired unit can be added to an existing manual flushometer to flush automatically when a user departs.|$|E
25|$|At this point, {{the toilet}} parts without their molds look like and {{are about as}} strong as soft clay. After about one hour the top core mold (interior of toilet) is removed. The rim mold bottom (which {{includes}} a place to mount the holding tank) is removed, and it then has appropriate slanted holes for the rinsing jets cut, and the mounting holes for tank and seat are punched into the rim piece. Valve holes for rapid water entry <b>into</b> <b>the</b> <b>toilet</b> are cut into the rim pieces. The exposed top of the bowl piece is then covered with a thick slip and the still-uncured rim is attached {{on top of the}} bowl so that the bowl and hollow rim are now a single piece. The bowl plus rim is then inverted, and the toilet bowl is set upside down on the top rim mold to hold the pieces together as they dry. Later, {{all the rest of the}} mold pieces are removed. As the clay body dries further it hardens more and continues to shrink. After a few hours, the casting is self-supporting, and is called greenware.|$|E
25|$|Alexander Simpson asks Poirot {{to help in}} the {{investigation}} of a painting by Rubens which was stolen from the gallery that he owns. A group of unemployed men were paid to carry out a demonstration in the gallery which, once it was cleared by the police, was found to have been a diversion to enable the picture to be cut out of its frame. Simpson knows the picture is being transported to France where it will be bought by a millionaire collector and he wants Poirot to assist as he thinks he will be better at dealing with an unscrupulous rich man than the police will be. Poirot reluctantly agrees to help. He is far more interested in a case that Japp has about Winnie King, a fifteen-year-old English girl who was being escorted to Paris as one of a party of such girls for the new term at Miss Pope's exclusive school there. On the way back from the dining car of the train, just after it left Amiens (the last stop before Paris), Winnie King went <b>into</b> <b>the</b> <b>toilet</b> and seemingly vanished. No body has been found {{by the side of the}} tracks and the train made no other stops, only slowing down for a signal; however, Winnie's hat was later recovered near the tracks. Poirot asks if her shoes have been found.|$|E
5000|$|Cultural, {{religious}} and traditional beliefs {{can lead to}} different restrictions that women or girls face during their period. Some {{of them do not}} wash their bodies, shower or bathe during these days. In some communities, they are not allowed to use water sources during menstruation. Even if they have access to toilets, they might not use them because of the fear of staining <b>the</b> <b>toilet</b> bowls (in <b>the</b> case of dry toilets or flush <b>toilets</b> where <b>the</b> flush is not powerful). This impairs the use of menstrual cups compared to pads as the pads are thrown away whereas the cups would be emptied <b>into</b> <b>the</b> <b>toilets.</b>|$|R

2500|$|Gosnell's {{license to}} {{practice}} was suspended on 22 February 2010, and these and other findings were presented to a Grand Jury on 4 May 2010. Public discussion focused on claims of unsanitary conditions and other unacceptable conditions at the practices. Media reports stated that furniture and blankets were stained with blood, freely roaming cats deposited their feces wherever they pleased, and that non-sterilized equipment was used and reused on patients. According {{to the grand jury}} report, patients were given labor-inducing drugs by staff who had no medical training. Once labor began, the patient would be placed on a toilet. After the fetus fell <b>into</b> <b>the</b> <b>toilet,</b> it would be fished out, so as not to clog the plumbing. In the recovery room, patients were seated on dirty recliners covered in blood-stained blankets. Prosecutors alleged that Gosnell had not been certified in either gynecology or obstetrics.

2500|$|VÃ©lez's {{death was}} recounted in the 1959 book Hollywood Babylon by Kenneth Anger. In Anger's retelling, VÃ©lez planned {{to stage a}} {{beautiful}} suicide scene atop her satin bed, but the Seconal she took did not mix well with the [...] "Mexi-Spice Last Supper" [...] that she had eaten earlier that evening. As a result, Anger said she became violently ill. Instead of dying on her bed as planned, Anger claimed that a dazed VÃ©lez stumbled {{to the bathroom to}} vomit, slipped on the bathroom floor tile and fell head first <b>into</b> <b>the</b> <b>toilet,</b> where she subsequently drowned. Anger claimed that VÃ©lez's [...] "chambermaid" [...] Juanita found her mistress the next morning. Despite the fact that Anger's version of events contradicts published reports and the official ruling, his story became something of an urban legend and is often repeated as fact - it was recounted in the pilot episode of the television comedy series Frasier. VÃ©lez's biographer, Michelle Vogel, points out {{that it would have been}} [...] "virtually impossible" [...] for VÃ©lez to have [...] "stumbled to the bathroom" [...] or even get off her bed after having consumed such a large amount of Seconal. Seconal is noted for being fast acting even in small doses and VÃ©lez's death was likely instantaneous. Her death certificate lists [...] "Seconal poisoning" [...] due to [...] "ingestion of Seconal" [...] as the cause of death, not drowning. Further, there was also no evidence to suggest VÃ©lez had vomited.|$|E

The same bullies arrive and pick his hat off and start beating him. Lil Wayne begins rapping at this point. The bullying flashback scenes are interlaced with Wayne rapping in a black, smoky room, which was filmed in front of a green screen. Meanwhile, Eminem walks into the studio with his lyric sheet, preparing for his recording session. He also joins behind Lil Wayne in the black room. The school boy encounters the bullies again in the school corridor, banging into them, but he simply walks off. While the boy daydreams, he listens to songs by Eminem and Lil Wayne in his earphones. The walls in his room are covered with posters of the two rappers, including a promotional poster of 8 Mile, a hip hop musical film that stars Eminem. In another flashback, he is encountered by the bullies in a restroom. The boy's hat is thrown <b>into</b> <b>the</b> <b>toilet</b> and his school items are thrown out.

2500|$|The limited series Watchmen, {{begun in}} 1986 and {{collected}} as a trade paperback in 1987, cemented Moore's reputation. Imagining {{what the world}} would be like if costumed heroes had really existed since the 1940s, Moore and artist Dave Gibbons created a Cold War mystery in which the shadow of nuclear war threatens the world. The heroes who are caught up in this escalating crisis either work for the US government or are outlawed, and are motivated to heroism by their various psychological hang-ups. Watchmen is non-linear and told from multiple points of view, and includes highly sophisticated self-references, ironies, and formal experiments such as the symmetrical design of issue 5, [...] "Fearful Symmetry", where the last page is a near mirror-image of the first, the second-last of the second, and so on, and in this manner is an early example of Moore's interest in the human perception of time and its implications for free will. It is the only comic to win the Hugo Award, in a one-time category ("Best Other Form"). It is widely seen as Moore's best work, and has been regularly described as the greatest comic book ever written. Alongside roughly contemporary works such as Frank Miller's Batman: The Dark Knight Returns, Art Spiegelman's Maus, and Jaime and Gilbert Hernandez's Love and Rockets, Watchmen was part of a late 1980s trend in American comics towards more adult sensibilities. Comics historian Les Daniels noted that Watchmen [...] "called into question the basic assumptions on which the super hero genre is formulated". DC Comics writer and executive Paul Levitz observed in 2010 that [...] "As with The Dark Knight Returns, Watchmen set off a chain reaction of rethinking the nature of super heroes and heroism itself, and pushed the genre darker for more than a decade. The series won acclaim... and would continue to be {{regarded as one of the}} most important literary works the field ever produced." [...] Moore briefly became a media celebrity, and the resulting attention led to him withdrawing from fandom and no longer attending comics conventions (at one UKCAC in London he is said to have been followed <b>into</b> <b>the</b> <b>toilet</b> by eager autograph hunters).|$|E
