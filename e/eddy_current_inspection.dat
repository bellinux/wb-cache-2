40|$|Abstract. <b>Eddy</b> <b>current</b> <b>inspections</b> {{are being}} {{commonly}} performed as a routine part {{of nuclear power}} plant in-service inspections. Important questions during analysing of inspection results are sensitivity and reliability of applied <b>eddy</b> <b>current</b> technique. One can meet with following type of questions: Does inspection of all tubes in tube bundle mean detection of all defects? What is the sensitivity of applied technique? What is the probability of detection of damage with given depth? These questions of course deserve the answers, even if we know, that a simple question in many cases requires difficult answer. The aim {{of this paper is}} to enlighten aspect of sensitivity of WWER steam generator heat exchanging tubes testing. Results of experimental works performed in VUJE, a. s. laboratories are presented.

40|$|Multiple FEM {{models of}} complex <b>eddy</b> <b>current</b> coil {{geometries}} were created and validated {{to calculate the}} change of impedance due {{to the presence of}} a notch. Capable realistic simulations of <b>eddy</b> <b>current</b> <b>inspections</b> are required for model assisted probability of detection (MAPOD) studies, inversion algorithms, experimental verification, and tailored probe design for NDE applications. An FEM solver was chosen to model complex real world situations including varying probe dimensions and orientations along with complex probe geometries. This will also enable creation of a probe model library database with variable parameters. Verification and validation was performed using other commercially available <b>eddy</b> <b>current</b> modeling software as well as experimentally collected benchmark data. Data analysis and comparison showed that the created models were able to correctly model the probe and conductor interactions and accurately calculate the change in impedance of several experimental scenarios with acceptable error.

40|$|The {{magneto-optic}} imager (MOT) {{is widely}} used in detecting surface and subsurface cracks and corrosion in aircraft skins. The instrument provides analog images of the anomalies based on <b>eddy</b> <b>current</b> induction techniques and a magneto-optic (MO) sensor using the Faraday rotation effect. The merits of the MOT that make it attractive include rapid and large-area inspection, insensitivity to liftoff variations, and easy interpretation {{in contrast to the}} complex impedance data of conventional <b>eddy</b> <b>current</b> <b>inspections.</b> The <b>current</b> MOT system lacks the capability of providing a quantitative measure of the defects. In addition, the presence of noise due to the underlying domain structures in the MO sensor can lead to inconsistent accept or reject decisions by the inspector.

40|$|In recent times, {{the desire}} to extend the service life of {{aerospace}} structures to offset the cost of replacement {{has led to an}} increase in the need to accurately predict the state of a structure by means of nondestructive evaluations. One such type of inspection is that of <b>eddy</b> <b>current</b> nondestructive <b>inspection.</b> The inspection is however difficult, and the data interpretation requires a great deal of expertise and experience with these types of systems. In order to solve some of these problems the use of numerical models has been extensive and in particular, the modeling of <b>eddy</b> <b>current</b> nondestructive evaluation problems {{has been the subject of}} much research over the past few decades. The advent of faster computers has made the process of simulating the full three-dimensional space and the <b>eddy</b> <b>current</b> nondestructive <b>inspection</b> of parts feasible. However, in order to achieve full automation of the <b>eddy</b> <b>current</b> nondestructive <b>inspection</b> the availability of accurate models to predict the expected change of probe impedance due to a flaw within a structure are required. The purpose of such models is to generate quality synthetic data which can, in some cases, be used to aid in the evaluation of data collected during the inspection process. The study presented in this dissertation probes the state of the art in <b>eddy</b> <b>current</b> modeling by making use of a commercially available finite element software package and examining the compromises which must be made in order to generate quality synthetic data in a reasonable amount of time. ...|$|R
40|$|In {{an effort}} to apply many NDE {{techniques}} to real inspections as in an automated inspection system, one often encounters situations less than ideal. These nonideal conditions frequently cause modification of existing techniques, {{and in some cases}} may even force the development of new methods. One factor which commonly causes reconsideration of NDE techniques is the geometry of the area to be inspected, since this will vary from application to application in an unpredictable way. This is true in <b>eddy</b> <b>current</b> <b>inspection</b> methods, which are sensitive to surface and conductivity discontinuities and liftoff variations, [1], and therefore are highly geometry dependent. One example, which is the focus of this paper, is the <b>eddy</b> <b>current</b> <b>inspection</b> of a rectangular opening in a surface, such as an antirotation window in aircraft engine airseals. In this situation, an <b>eddy</b> <b>current</b> <b>inspection</b> technique was sought which would allow detection of surface flaws connected to the window. This paper discusses three conventional methods and one novel method of extracting flaw information from the inspection signal. Experimental data are also presented...|$|E
40|$|Filament wound graphite/epoxy {{cylinders}} {{are used}} {{in a number of}} applications because of their favorable strength-to-weight ratio. Eddy current techniques are receiving more attention for composite inspection because eddy currents detect broken fibers but not delaminations. Therefore, <b>eddy</b> <b>current</b> <b>inspection</b> of this material would be desirable in its own right and as an adjunct to ultrasonic inspection which detects delaminations, but not broken fibers. However, filament wound graphite/epoxy is difficult to inspect because of its large and anisotropie electrical resistivity. This paper presents a technique for eddy current NDI of filament wound graphite/epoxy which uses currents flowing in the low-resistivity circumferential direction. This method eliminates several objections to conventional <b>eddy</b> <b>current</b> <b>inspection</b> of this material...|$|E
40|$|Conventional {{eddy current}} using single-frequency {{excitation}} has limited material characterization capabilities. Enrichment of the spectral information {{of the signal}} with techniques such as multifrequency or swept frequency inspection could be employed to improve the inspection process. Broadband excitation is also implemented with time-domain inspection using pulsed eddy current PEC. The spectrum of PEC however has decayed energy corresponding to higher frequencies. This paper addresses {{the implementation of a}} technique, termed transfusion; to fuse partial eddy current information obtained from measurements in the time domain with PEC with inspection results that could be available at fixed points in the frequency domain, obtained with conventional <b>eddy</b> <b>current</b> <b>inspection.</b> The technique is based on image fusion methods, in accordance with increased interest in c-scan representation of eddy current signals. The developed algorithm depends on packing multi-spectral and multi-temporal data into the values of color components of transfusion image. Further enhancement could be obtained by fusing this image with a high quality image of the object under test, which could be acquired using high frequency <b>eddy</b> <b>current</b> <b>inspection</b> or another NDE modality. Results based on the proposed technique, based on finite element simulation of <b>eddy</b> <b>current</b> <b>inspection</b> are presented, along with suggested image quality measures to test the spectral as well as spatial information of the transfusion image...|$|E

Firstly, Finite Element simulations have been conducted to (1) evaluate and assess the commercial Finite Element simulation packages, COMSOL and ANSOFT MAXWELL EM in terms of feasibility for simulation of ENDE forward problems including <b>Eddy</b> <b>Current</b> and Magnetic Flux Leakage; (2) apply Finite Element modelling as a comparative approach to verify the proposed analytical methods for forward models and inverse schemes.

40|$|Abstract: Modern multifrequency <b>eddy</b> <b>current</b> <b>inspections</b> {{typically}} {{produce more}} information than is actually processed by the analyst. The traditional “strip chart ” and impedance-plane signal analysis presentations contain the data needed to simultaneously extract a number of quantities, including the depth profile and surface extent of flaws, {{the distance from the}} probe to the test piece, the character and amplitude of ferromagnetic signal components and the gap between conductive components. However, much of this information is hidden in correlations between the signals obtained at different frequencies. A simplified modeling algorithm, based on the same skin-depth considerations employed by industrial analysts, offers a relatively fast and quantitative solution to the “inverse problem ” of deducing features from <b>eddy</b> <b>current</b> signals. The frequency response of the probe is approximated as a combination of effects, including conductor/flaw geometry, ferromagnetic response, and lift-off or fill-factor and the phenomena that combine to produce signals best approximating the observed response are displayed for consideration by the analyst. Real-world applicability of the techniques is illustrated by analysis of data from inspections of nuclear power plant components.
