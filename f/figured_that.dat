5|$|I {{started doing}} {{different}} charity events where I did {{a combination of}} 'Never Too Far' and 'Hero'. We made it into a medley {{and put them in}} the same key and made it work. People responded really well to it. It's been interesting for me, since the events of September11, the way people have been playing 'Hero' and really even talking to me about 'Never Too Far', 'cause that song is also about loss. I <b>figured</b> <b>that</b> it would be a nice thing to do, to put them both out for Christmas. There's also an unreleased track on the B-side, which is called 'There for Me' which kind of has the same sentiment. The proceeds from 'Never Too Far' and 'Hero' and 'There for Me' are going to go to the Heroes Fund, and it's going to benefit police officers' families, relief workers' families.|$|E
5|$|Kerry Conran {{grew up on}} {{films and}} comic books of the 1930s and 1940s. He and his brother, Kevin, were {{encouraged}} by their parents to develop their creative side at a young age. Kerry studied at a feeder program for Disney animators at CalArts, and became interested in 2-D computer animation. While there, he {{realized that it was}} possible to apply some of the techniques associated with animation to live-action. Conran had been out of film school for two years and was trying to figure out how to make a movie. He <b>figured</b> <b>that</b> Hollywood would never take a chance on an inexperienced, first-time filmmaker, so he decided to make the movie himself.|$|E
5|$|The Michigan Department of Transportation (MDOT) {{maintains}} M-48 {{like all}} {{other parts of the}} state trunkline highway system under its jurisdiction. As a part of these responsibilities, the department tracks the volume of traffic along its roads using a metric called average annual daily traffic (AADT). This measurement is a calculation of the average traffic levels for a roadway segment on any average day of the year. In 2009, MDOT <b>figured</b> <b>that</b> between 580 and 1,800vehicles a day used sections of M-48. In addition, the department has added the portion of M-48 between the northern M-129 junction and M-134 to the Lake Huron Circle Tour, a scenic drive that loops around the lake. No part of the highway has been added to the National Highway System, a network of roads important to the country's economy, defense, and mobility.|$|E

5000|$|Past {{research}} has tested {{the reliability and}} validity of the figure rating scale. In order to test the strength and reliability of this measurement, researchers assigned six specific instructions to ask of their participants during figure selection. The instructions are as follows: (1) choose your ideal figure; (2) choose the <b>figure</b> <b>that</b> reflects how you think you look; (3) choose the <b>figure</b> <b>that</b> reflects how you feel most of the time; (4) choose the <b>figure</b> <b>that</b> you think is most preferred by men; (5) choose the <b>figure</b> <b>that</b> you think is most preferred by women; and (6) pick the opposite sex <b>figure</b> <b>that</b> you find most attractive. For validity analyses, the figure ratings can be transformed into the three following discrepancy measures: (1) feel minus ideal; (2) think minus ideal; and (3) feel minus think. The instructions developed for these measures may be interchanged depending on the specific topic of research or category of observation. Each research study may provide a different set of reliability and validity assessments for the figure rating scale dependent upon the goal and procedures of the study.|$|R

5|$|M-46 is one {{of three}} trans-peninsular {{highways}} in the Lower Peninsula, starting blocks away from Lake Michigan in Muskegon and running almost to Lake Huron in Port Sanilac. The other two highways that do this are M-55 (Manistee– Tawas City) and M-72 (Empire–Harrisville). The highway is maintained by the Michigan Department of Transportation (MDOT) like all other state trunkline highways in the state. The department tracks the traffic volumes along all state highway highways as a part of its maintenance responsibilities using a metric called average annual daily traffic (AADT). This measurement is a calculation of the traffic level along a segment of roadway for any average day of the year. In 2009, MDOT <b>figured</b> <b>that</b> lowest traffic levels were the 1,855vehicles used the highway daily near the eastern terminus. The peak traffic volumes were the 30,505vehicles AADT along the section of M-46 immediately east of the US31 freeway near Muskegon. The trunkline has been listed on the National Highway System (NHS) between the western terminus and US31, and between Cedar Springs and the M-53 junction in Sanilac County. The NHS is a network of roadways important to the nation's economy, defense, and mobility.|$|E
5|$|WWV's 20MHz {{signal was}} used for a unique purpose in 1958: to track the {{disintegration}} of Russian satellite Sputnik I after the craft's onboard electronics failed. Dr. John D. Kraus, a professor at Ohio State University, knew that a meteor entering the upper atmosphere leaves in its wake {{a small amount of}} ionized air. This air reflects a stray radio signal back to Earth, strengthening the signal at the surface for a few seconds. This effect is known as meteor scatter. Dr. Kraus <b>figured</b> <b>that</b> what was left of Sputnik would exhibit the same effect, but on a larger scale. His prediction was correct; WWV's signal was noticeably strengthened for durations lasting over a minute. In addition, the strengthening came from a direction and at a time of day that agreed with predictions of the paths of Sputnik's last orbits. Using this information, Dr. Kraus was able to draw up a complete timeline of Sputnik's disintegration. In particular, he observed that satellites do not fall as one unit; instead, the spacecraft broke up into its component parts as it moved closer to Earth.|$|E
5|$|After Darlington {{bought the}} {{railroad}} bridge from the Delaware, Lackawanna and Western Railroad, {{he made his}} intentions with the five decade-old bridge clear. He took out the tracks, replacing them with a paved roadway. Darlington knew the automobile was becoming a big entity in the 1910s and 1920s, turning the bridge into a vehicular bridge was an important decision {{to make the most}} out of the crossing. He also <b>figured</b> <b>that</b> the bridge would make a good approach for drivers coming to visit the local natural attractions, such as the Delaware Water Gap and the Pocono Mountains. Darlington created new roadway approaches (Lackawanna Road and Ferry Lane) to the bridge and even two buildings on the New Jersey side of the span. One building was for toll collecting while the other was for living quarters. These quarters were soon occupied by Edward McCracken and his wife. McCracken and his wife had come from the Meyer's Ferry, a local ferry service running at that point on the Delaware since the early 18th century. McCracken had been the local ferry operator, but when a large accident occurred during a dinner break killed four passengers, the owner put the ferry under his control and later fired McCracken. Klein later sold the ferry, which Darlington bought and shut down. He immediately hired the McCrackens to work as the toll collectors.|$|E

5|$|Nurmi's {{trip to the}} 1924 Summer Olympics was {{endangered}} by a knee injury {{in the spring of}} 1924, but he recovered and resumed training twice a day. On 19 June, Nurmi tried out the 1924 Olympic schedule at the Eläintarha Stadium in Helsinki by running the 1500 m and the 5000 m inside an hour, setting new world records for both distances. In the 1500 m final at the Olympics in Paris, Nurmi ran the first 800 m almost three seconds faster. His only challenger, Ray Watson of the United States, gave up before the last lap and Nurmi was able to slow down and coast to victory ahead of Willy Schärer, H. B. Stallard and Douglas Lowe, still breaking the Olympic record by three seconds. The 5000 m final started in less than two hours, and Nurmi faced a tough challenge from countryman Ville Ritola, who had already won the 3000 m steeplechase and the 10,000 m. Ritola and Edvin Wide <b>figured</b> <b>that</b> Nurmi must be tired and tried to burn him off by running at world-record pace. Realizing that he was now racing the two men and not the clock, Nurmi tossed his stopwatch onto the grass. The Finns later passed the Swede as his pace faded and continued their duel. On the home straight, Ritola sprinted from the outside but Nurmi increased his pace to keep his rival a metre behind.|$|E

25|$|Population {{estimates}} {{from the first}} decade of the 19th century varied between 6,122,354 as calculated by Francisco Navarro y Noriega in 1810, to 6.5 million as figured by Alexander von Humboldt in 1808. Navarro y Noriega <b>figured</b> <b>that</b> half of his estimate constituted indigenous peoples. More recent data suggests that the actual population of New Spain in 1810 was closer to 5 or 5.5 million individuals.|$|E
25|$|Munroe <b>figured</b> <b>that</b> {{the best}} way to make pencils was by {{starting}} with a quarter inch slab of cedar wood. He then would cut the slots for his special formula graphite paste and fill them. He would let the paste air dry. The next step was to glue an eighth inch veneer of wood over the slots. The final step was to saw the slab into pencils. This resulted in a wooden lead graphite pencil that was just under a half inch thick.|$|E
25|$|San Antonio International Airport uses {{a system}} for its evening arrival {{aircraft}} using the terminals. Once all flights that are classified as passenger departures have departed, The airport would usually get very crowded in the terminal area, thus having no room for other aircraft. The San Antonio Airport Authority <b>figured</b> <b>that</b> a plan was needed to be placed into action. The plan was to have an arriving passenger aircraft park at a gate that is operated by their airline. Once all the passengers and crew are deplaned, and all servicing is completed on that aircraft, The plane will then be towed by a tug to the West Cargo area to sit parked overnight and give room for other aircraft.|$|E

25|$|The {{long-term}} {{plans for}} The Baseball Network crumbled when the Major League Baseball Players' Association {{went on strike}} on August 12, 1994 (thus forcing the cancellation of the World Series). In July 1995, ABC and NBC, which wound up having to share the duties of televising the 1995 World Series {{as a way to}} recoup (with ABC broadcasting Games 1, 4 and 5, and NBC broadcasting Games 2 3, and 6), announced that they were opting out of their agreement with Major League Baseball. Both networks <b>figured</b> <b>that</b> as the delayed 1995 baseball season opened without a labor agreement, there was no guarantee against another strike. Both networks soon publicly vowed to cut all ties with Major League Baseball {{for the remainder of the}} 20th century.|$|E
25|$|For {{the dual}} roles of Arctor and Fred, Linklater thought of Keanu Reeves, but <b>figured</b> <b>that</b> the actor would be burnt out from making another science fiction film after making The Matrix trilogy. Robert Downey, Jr. was {{attracted}} to the film when he heard Reeves was going to star and Linklater to direct. He thought that the script was the strangest one he had ever read. Linklater wrote the role of Freck with Rory Cochrane in mind. The actor was interested but {{did not want to}} recreate his role in Dazed and Confused. Both Woody Harrelson and Winona Ryder agreed to appear in the film based on the script. Reeves and Ryder agreed to work for the Screen Actors Guild scale rate plus any back-end profits. As with Linklater's earlier Waking Life, syndicated radio host Alex Jones has a small cameo as himself.|$|E
25|$|CBS alienated and {{confused}} fans with its sporadic treatment of regular season telecasts. With {{a sense of}} true continuity destroyed, fans eventually <b>figured</b> <b>that</b> they could not count on the network to satisfy their needs (thus, poor ratings were a result). CBS televised about 16 regular season Saturday afternoon games (not counting back-up telecasts) which was 14 less than what NBC televised during the previous contract. According to Commissioner Peter Ueberroth, {{the reason for the}} reduction in regular season telecasts was in order for teams to sell them locally {{in order to make a}} direct profit. CBS used the strategy of broadcasting only a select amount of games in order to build a demand in response to supposedly sagging ratings. In theory, the limited regular season package would require the network to sell less advertising during the year so it can charge more for its postseason events.|$|E

25|$|During Maga's exile, {{a number}} of coups were {{attempted}} against Presidents Soglo, Apithy, and Ahomadégbé-Tomêtin and their putschists. In order to gain power back, Maga formed a new party while in exile, the Union Nationale Dahoméenne (U.N.D.), on December 9, 1965. It {{was little more than}} a vehicle to be recognised in the upcoming elections, to be held before January 18, 1966. Maga and Apithy banded together to protest a special session of the National Assembly on December 21, 1965, that would vote on a new constitution for Dahomey, and the session was never held. Academic Dov Ronen speculates that this was because there would be no vice-presidents in the constitution, and the two politicians <b>figured</b> <b>that</b> a coalition would guarantee high offices for both. Neither was to witness a political comeback on January 18, as Soglo seized power on December 22 of the previous year and refused to hold elections.|$|E
25|$|Publishers often funded {{trade-in}} {{deals to}} encourage consumers to purchase new games. Trade-in customers at the Australia retailer Game would purchase twice the games per year as non-trade-in customers. The sale of pre-owned games kept retailers in business, and composed {{about a third}} of Game's revenue. Retailers also saved on the UK's value-added tax, which only taxed the retailer's profit on pre-owned games, rather than the full sale on regular games. The former trade-in retail executives behind the trade-in price comparison site Trade In Detectives estimated that the United Kingdom's trade-in industry was {{about a third of}} the size of its new games business. They <b>figured</b> <b>that</b> sites such as eBay, which convert used games into cash, compose about a quarter of the UK's trade-in market, but do not keep the credit within the industry. While consumers might appear to receive better offers on these sites, they also take about 15 percent of the selling price in fees. Alternatively, some retailers will match the trade-in values offered by their competitors. Microsoft's original plan for the Xbox One attempted to translate trade-in deals for the digital marketplace, with a database of product licenses that shops would be able to resell with publisher permission, though the plan was poorly received or poorly sold.|$|E
25|$|The {{dropping}} of McCosker angered Ian Chappell and {{his teammates}} and I copped the brunt of it. I {{may have been an}} unassuming guy at the time, but I was rudely awakened to the facts of life at test level – thanks, or rather no thanks to Chappell {{and the rest of the}} team. I was not exactly welcomed with open arms into the team. In fact, I was lucky to discover my locker in the Australian dressing rooms. To top it off, Chappell <b>figured</b> <b>that</b> if I was selected to replace McCosker, that's exactly what I would do... at Number 3. I suppose you could say it was an honour to bat ahead of Ian and Greg Chappell in a test. But I have no doubts that certain members of that team wanted me to fail and therefore prove that the selectors had erred. Normally, a new batsman could expect to be cradled into the side and be 'hidden' down the order until he gets the feel of the test atmosphere. There was no such deal for me. I was thrown into the deep end, to sink or swim, and that will live in my memory forever. While I am captain of a team, no batsman will be given the shoddy treatment I received on my test debut.|$|E
