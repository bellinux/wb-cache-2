40|$|This {{contribution}} {{demonstrates the}} sensitivity of antigorite dehydroxylation to treatment conditions and discusses {{the implications of the}} observations for scientific (i. e., dehydroxylation kinetics) and technological (i. e., energy efficient conditions and design of practical activation reactors) applications. At present, the energy cost of dehydroxylation of serpentinite ores represent the most important impediment for a large scale implementation of sequestering CO 2 by mineralization. We have analyzed changes in antigorite 2 ̆ 7 s derivative thermogravimetric curves (DTG) and deduced factors affecting the mass loss profiles. The imposed heating rate, type of purge gas, type of comminution and sample mass all influence the dehydroxylation curve. However, the results show no influence of material of construction of the <b>heating</b> <b>vessel</b> and flow rate of the purge gas. We report an important effect of oxidation of Fe 2 + under air purge gas that occurs prior to dehydroxylation and leads to formation of hematite skins on serpentinite particles, slowing down subsequent mass transfer and increasing the treatment temperature. From the process perspective, 75 μm particles afford optimal conditions of temperature and rate of dehydroxylation. Overall, the practical considerations, in thermally activating serpentinite ores for storing CO 2 by carbonation, comprise rapid heating, proper size reduction, prior demagnetisation, and fluidization of the powder bed...|$|E
40|$|A {{catalyst}} {{is defined}} as a substance that accelerates a process without undergoing a net change due to that process. Most chemistry students learn about catalysts in the context of chemical reactions, such as the enzymes in biochemistry or the heterogeneous metal catalysts in inorganic chemistry (1, 2). However, it is both important and instructive to show students that the concept of catalysis is broader than molecular chemistry as it also includes physical processes such as crystallization, freezing, boiling, and liquid condensation. Students are familiar with measures to accelerate these processes but probably without realizing that they apply a catalyst, according to the definition given above. In basic laboratorywork, for example, students learn about the precautions to prevent “bumping” when heating solutions or distilling liquids. This bumping is the sudden boiling that results in hot liquid and vapor shooting uncontrollably out of the <b>heating</b> <b>vessel.</b> Addition of boiling stones to the liquid before heating will prevent this uncontrolled boiling; alternative antibumping measures are stirring of the liquid with amechanical stirrer ormagnetic flea or the use of an inert gas (nitrogen) capillary bleed in the case of vacuum distillation (3). The effect of these precautions is that they facilitate the nucleation, that is, the formation of vapor bubbles in the heated liquid, such that the liquid boils at its normal boiling point (for either ambient or reduced pressure). Without antibumping measures the liquid temperature may rise above the liquid's boiling point. Any bubble nucleation in this so-called superheated liquid will lead to the uncontrollable boiling mentioned above. Ern e (4) describes an instructive classroom experiment, using amicrowave oven, that demonstrates this superheating of clean liquids and the effect of antibumping agents...|$|E

Oleoresin is very useful in food and drinks industry. It is used as a flavor in foods and drinks. Oleoresin can be found by mechanic pressing and extraction. The objective of this final project is to make an extractor by using expeller pressing system. It is done to get oleoresin in the red ginger. The specal quality of this system is extraction can be processed in confornity with the size reduction of materials. Extractor by using expeller pressing system consists of a chain of components; they are screw conveyor to take the material by pushing and reduction the raw material size, pully and v-belt component to continue the energy, electric motor to move the pully and v-belt, and reducer to reduce the rolling fastness of the motor system. In this extraction method, the ginger and the etanol are entered together in the same tin on the screw by hopper. The screw is rolling in 75 rpm to destroy the raw material, mix ginger and etanol and also pressing the raw material. Next, the raw material and the ginger extract are kept in the separate vessel to separate the raw material from the extract. Then the extract flow into the <b>heating</b> <b>vessel.</b> It is heated with the electric stove to evaporate and condensed the etanol.

40|$|This present {{contribution}} {{addresses the}} most important impediment for a large scale implementation of sequestering CO₂ by mineralisation, the energy cost of dehydroxylation of serpentinite ores. The current work, based on a practical heat activation strategy, provides reasonable energy and cost estimates of the thermal treatment of serpentine. A practical heat activation strategy comprises prograde heating to yield a material containing 20 % OHres and employs heat integration to recover ~ 80 % of the sensible heat from the dehydroxylated mineral. This study also reconfirms that crystallinity primarily controls magnesium availability. Once dehydroxylated, overheating must be avoided to prevent the material from recrystallising. Significant loss of crystallinity commences by ~ 50 % OHres, peaks at about 20 % OHres, and terminates beyond 5 % OHres. Besides limiting crystallinity, entrapment of liberated water {{and the formation of}} hematite must be minimised or altogether eliminated. The fluidisation of the reactor bed and the use of CO₂ as purge gas combined with prior demagnetisation circumvent these limiting factors. Furthermore, the rapid thermal treatment of 75 µm particles allows for optimal conditions of temperature and rate of dehydroxylation and presents a practical means to increase the throughput and minimise reactor size. Examination of the prior studies on the dehydroxylation of serpentine minerals identified the knowledge gaps that require addressing. This review surveys the key concepts, including the chemical and physical transformations involving the proposed mechanisms, thermal stability, reaction kinetics, the formation of intermediates and products, associated heat requirements, factors that influence the reaction, as well as associated enhancements in both dissolution and carbonation. The review finds the activation processes must avoid recrystallisation of disordered phases to forsterite and enstatite, and minimise the partial pressure of water vapour, which engenders reverse reaction. In particular, this current study determined the suitability of the serpentinite resource from the Great Serpentinite Belt in New South Wales for thermal activation using thermal, X-ray and spectroscopic techniques. Experimental investigations designed to evaluate the thermal behaviour and structural transformations of serpentine minerals include thermogravimetry-derivative thermogravimetry, mass spectrometry, X-ray diffraction and magic angle spinning nuclear magnetic resonance. We focussed on antigorite as the model serpentine mineral for these studies, however, we include the other serpentine minerals, lizardite and chrysotile as well as partially serpentinised samples in subsequent energy measurements by thermogravimetry-differential scanning calorimetry. We first analysed the changes in antigorite’s derivative thermogravimetric curves (DTG) and deduced factors affecting the mass loss profiles to serve as guide in both fundamental studies and in the design of a scale-up dehydroxylation reactor. The imposed heating rate, type of purge gas, type of comminution and sample mass all influence the dehydroxylation curve.

We then demonstrate the optimisation of heat treatment of antigorite, to provide a benchmark of an extreme case of activation among serpentine minerals. Antigorite was investigated non-isothermally via thermogravimetry-mass spectrometry and in-situ X-ray powder diffraction, its thermal reaction sequence elucidated and reaction kinetics subsequently modelled. Here we describe a predictive framework expedient to the thermal processing of serpentinites for the mineralisation of CO₂. We successfully modelled an optimised thermal dehydroxylation strategy for antigorite using a three-dimensional phase boundary reaction model (R 3), with activation energy Ea of 160 kJ mol⁻¹ and a frequency factor A of 5. 7 ± 4. 1 × 10 ⁵ s⁻¹ (5. 7 × 10 ⁵ s⁻¹ for dynamic and 1. 6 × 10 ⁵ s⁻¹ for static stage). This strategy translates to a fast and efficient thermal processing in an optimally-sized calcining vessel. Furthermore, the results imply that activation of the more common serpentine minerals lizardite and chrysotile would be significantly less energy intensive as their dehydroxylation proceeds at lower temperatures than that of antigorite. We also investigated the local chemical environment of thermally treated antigorite to elucidate the structural transformations that take place during its dehydroxylation. A combination of ²⁹Si and ²⁵Mg magic angle spinning nuclear magnetic resonance (MAS NMR) spectroscopy, phase compositional analysis and morphological observations served to characterise these transformations. The results indicate that, whilst the octahedral sheet remained relatively immobile, the tetrahedral sheet demonstrated a range of movements. This progressive break-up of the silicate sheet leads to various SiO₄ tetrahedral polymerisation and the formation of two intermediate phases, dehydroxylate 1 and dehydroxylate 2. These metastable phases possess similar Mg octahedral environment, but differ in the local configuration of SiO₄ tetrahedra. The results suggest that crystallinity plays a significant role in antigorite dehydroxylation wherein partially amorphised regions dehydroxylate preferentially. For applications to mineralisation of CO₂, once dehydroxylated, the formation of new crystalline phases must be minimised in order to maximise the loss of crystallinity. The combined chemical, morphological and physical evidence implies that significant loss of crystallinity commences at about 50 % OHres until about 5 % OHres. Finally, we present realistic cost estimates based on a practical heat activation strategy for serpentinites. By comparing serpentinites from the Great Serpentinite Belt to those found in Coolac Serpentinite Belt, we found the former more suitable for heat activation under a practical heat activation strategy. Based on the research findings, the thermal activation of serpentine minerals from the Great Serpentinite Belt (GSB) presents a practical option to New South Wales for the mineralisation of CO₂.

The {{purpose of this study was}} to determine whether vascular heating during local heparin delivery with hydrogel-coated, radiofrequency-powered thermal angioplasty balloons would affect immediate drug deposition and the subsequent persistence of heparin within the arterial wall. To evaluate the effect ofheat on heparin deposition, fluorescein-labeled heparin was delivered in vitro to 13 bovine coronary arteries either at 50 °C (n= 3), at 60 °C (n= 3) or without heat (n= 7). Heparin deposition was graded on a 1 – 3 scale as extending into the inner 1 / 3, the middle 1 / 3 or outer 1 / 3 of the arterial wall. To assess the effect of heat on the intramural persistence of heparin, 3 H-heparin was delivered in vivo to 13 porcine peripheral artery pairs. The balloon:artery ratio was 1. 2 : 1 as guided by intravascular ultrasound. One artery in each pair was heated during heparin delivery to either 50 °C (n= 11) or 80 °C (n= 2). The contralateral control <b>vessel</b> was not <b>heated.</b> Arteries were harvested at one hour for scintillation counting.

6000|$|The Dock of the Steam-Tug, Pancks, had a leaden roof, which, frying in {{the very}} hot sunshine, may have <b>heated</b> the <b>vessel.</b> Be that as it may, one glowing Saturday evening, on being hailed by the lumbering bottle-green ship, the Tug {{instantly}} came working out of the Dock in a highly heated condition. 'Mr Pancks,' was the Patriarchal remark, 'you have been remiss, you have been remiss, sir.' ...|$|R
40|$|An {{experimental}} apparatus for {{the investigation}} of the flow-assisted dissolution and precipitation (corrosion) of potential fuel cladding and structural materials to be used in liquid lead alloy cooled reactors has been designed. This experimental project {{is part of a larger}} research effort between Idaho National Engineering and Environmental Laboratory (INEEL) and Massachusetts Institute of Technology to investigate the suitability of lead, lead-bismuth, and other lead alloys for cooling fast reactors designed to produce low-cost electricity as well as for actinide burning. The INEEL forced convection corrosion cell consists of a small <b>heated</b> <b>vessel</b> with a shroud and gas flow system. The gas flow rates, heat input, and shroud and vessel dimensions have been adjusted so that a controlled coolant flow rate, temperature, and oxygen potential are created within the downcomer located between the shroud and vessel wall. The ATHENA computer code was used to design the experimental apparatus and estimate the fluid conditions. The corrosion cell will test steel that is commercially available in the U. S. to temperatures above 650 oC...|$|R
