5|$|Meher Baba gave {{numerous}} teachings on {{the cause}} and purpose of life, including teaching reincarnation and that the phenomenal world is an illusion. He taught that the Universe is <b>imagination,</b> <b>that</b> God is what really exists, and that each soul is really God passing through imagination to realize individually His own divinity. In addition he gave practical advice for the aspirant who wishes to attain Self-realization and thereby escape the wheel of births and deaths. He also taught about the concept of Perfect Masters, the Avatar, and those on the various stages of the spiritual path that he called involution. His teachings are most importantly recorded in his principal books Discourses and God Speaks.|$|E

25|$|Adler {{went on to}} {{note that}} from those she interviewed and {{surveyed}} in the U.S., she could identify a number of common factors that led to people getting involved in Paganism: the beauty, vision and <b>imagination</b> <b>that</b> was found within their beliefs and rituals, a sense of intellectual satisfaction and personal growth that they imparted, their support for environmentalism and/or feminism, {{and a sense of}} freedom.|$|E
25|$|The {{technological}} innovations of the 19th century {{had opened the}} possibility of rapid circumnavigation and the prospect fascinated Verne and his readership. In particular, three technological breakthroughs occurred in 1869–70 that made a tourist-like around-the-world journey possible for the first time: {{the completion of the}} First Transcontinental Railroad in America (1869), the linking of the Indian railways across the sub-continent (1870), and the opening of the Suez Canal (1869). It was another notable mark in the end of an age of exploration and the start of an age of fully global tourism that could be enjoyed in relative comfort and safety. It sparked the <b>imagination</b> <b>that</b> anyone could sit down, draw up a schedule, buy tickets and travel around the world, a feat previously reserved for only the most heroic and hardy of adventurers.|$|E

500|$|The Doctor prescribes [...] "Mythotherapy" [...] to move Jake {{beyond his}} {{paralysis}} by giving him arbitrary decision-making principles and having him take on identities by wearing [...] "masks"—assuming roles. [...] He tells Jake [...] "fiction isn't a lie at all, but a true {{representation of the}} distortion that everyone makes of life". [...] These distortions—an approach Jake calls [...] "mythoplastic"—people employ to with the arbitrary conditions life thrusts upon them. [...] According to Jake, it is the <b>imagination</b> <b>that</b> enables one to cope, and its lack in the Morgans was to lead to their destruction.|$|E

His decisions in specialist fields, such as patents, torts, admiralty law, and antitrust law, set lasting standards for craftsmanship and clarity. On constitutional matters, he was both a political progressive and an advocate of judicial restraint. He believed in the protection of free speech and in bold legislation to address social and economic problems. He argued, however, that the United States Constitution does not empower courts to overrule the legislation of elected bodies, except in extreme circumstances. Instead, he advocated the [...] "combination of toleration and <b>imagination</b> <b>that</b> {{to me is the}} epitome of all good government".|$|E

[...] Regarding the sexual intercourse scenes between actor Taylor Kinney and the singer as a mermaid, Gaga explained that it emphasized metaphorically that sometimes relationships did not work. [...] "No matter what you do, there's this giant boundary between you and someone else.

500|$|Brandon Teena was a trans {{man who was}} gang {{raped and}} murdered by two male acquaintances in December 1993, when he was 21. Kimberly Peirce, {{at the time a}} Columbia University film student, became {{interested}} in the case after reading a 1994 Village Voice article by Donna Minkowitz. Peirce became engrossed in Brandon's life and death; she said, [...] "the minute I read about Brandon, I fell in love. With the intensity of his desire to turn himself into a boy, {{the fact that he did}} it with no role models. The leap of <b>imagination</b> <b>that</b> this person took was completely overwhelming to me." [...] The sensationalist news coverage of the case prolonged her interest. Peirce said she looked beyond the brutality of the case and instead viewed the positive aspects of Brandon's life as part of what eventually causes his death. [...] She admired Brandon's audacity, ability to solve complicated problems, and what she perceived as the sense of fantasy invoked by his personality.|$|E
500|$|The episode {{as a whole}} has {{received}} mixed to positive reviews from critics. AOL TV's Brad Trechak wrote that it [...] "showed a level of <b>imagination</b> <b>that</b> the recent Halloween episodes have been lacking" [...] and that it [...] "started good and got progressively better [...] ". Todd VanDerWerff of The A.V. Club, on the other hand, commented that the segments [...] "got weaker as they went along". He added the episode [...] "wasn't awful, and it did have some solid laughs, but the quality of the segments was decidedly hit and miss." [...] These two critics both praised Bart's dream for being funny and Lisa's dream for its Inglourious Basterds parody. They had different opinions on the last two sequences, though. Trechak thought Stewart [...] "really shone in , playing some sort of parody of herself crossed with Mary Poppins and Satan," [...] and singled out the live-action sequence as his favorite because he is a fan of Jim Henson, the creator of The Muppets. VanDerWerff commented that [...] "Marge's visit from Martha Stewart was one joke stretched too far, and the final segment with the Muppet Simpsons was far too stilted." ...|$|E

500|$|Several {{critics also}} {{recognized}} the film's ability {{to appeal to}} various age groups, specifically children and adults. Owen Gleiberman of Entertainment Weekly wrote [...] "It has the purity, the ecstatic freedom of <b>imagination,</b> <b>that's</b> {{the hallmark of the}} greatest children's films. It also has the kind of spring-loaded allusive prankishness that, at times, will tickle adults even more than it does kids." ...|$|R

Also for The Hindu, Malathi Rangarajan wrote, [...] "Let's celebrate the figment of [...] <b>imagination</b> <b>that</b> has made the housefly appear as invincible as any of our muscle-flexing heroes". Karishma Upadhyay of The Telegraph called the film [...] "a winner from the first frame to the last" [...] and praised Rajamouli's screenplay, writing that it made [...] "the absurd seem real, willing you to accept anything that he throws at you". J. Hurtado of Twitch Film called Eega the [...] "best, most insane, most inventive film of the year", and praised Rajamouli's scripting, the visual effects and Sudeep's performance, calling the latter [...] "legitimately hilarious". V. S. Rajapur, Indo-Asian News Service gave Eega four stars out of five, and praised the performances and music; Rajapur was particularly appreciative of the visual effects, saying the hard work put in by the entire team was [...] "clearly visible onscreen". A reviewer from Sify called Eega an [...] "escapist, comic book-like fantasy" [...] that [...] "throws you into an experience so profound that nothing else really matters".|$|E
500|$|The film {{received}} mixed {{reception in}} trade publications, but some advertisements would boast {{the power of}} the film or {{go so far as to}} call it a great American drama. The The Moving Picture News stated, [...] "As a sketch of country folk, admirable because it is true. The situations are well worked out. The conversion! Could it be? A New England church meeting would be a good place to exhibit and - ask questions." [...] Though the reviewer in the The New York Dramatic Mirror however disagreed that the premise was plausible, [...] "A [...] old deacon forms the complicating element in this rather conventional and rather improbable story. That a girl could become a comic opera star without the knowledge of her parents is a strain for the <b>imagination.</b> <b>That</b> a simple little dance like the one in the picture could effect such a conversion is another tax on belief. The acting is good, especially in the heroine's role. The deacon displays an unnatural tendency in such a stern character when he rapturously kisses the photograph of his daughter." [...] It is unknown if the character of Deacon Sanders is really a church deacon because the synopsis states Deacon Sanders is a farmer who is [...] "nearly as poor as he is religious".|$|E
500|$|On {{the mixed}} to {{negative}} side, Joseph Stannard, {{in his review}} for Adventures in Modern Recording, opined The Age of Plastic [...] "sounds like unfinished business, a series of good ideas in need of elaboration". Dave Marsh and John Swenson, writing for The Rolling Stone Record Guide, opined that [...] "aside from the wonderful 'Video Killed the Radio Star' — perhaps the most successful recent example of a single where the production was catchier than the material", the album was [...] "high-tech dreck". Betty Page from Sounds commented that the group [...] "stretches uncomfortably out into the long playing medium like a skein of well-chewed bubblegum." [...] In {{a review of the}} 1999 reissue of the album, Richard Wallace of Daily Mirror wrote that the record [...] "shows how [...] pioneered the synth-led nonsense which fused much of the decade's pop, but had little creative <b>imagination.</b> <b>That</b> bombastic electro-sound became [...] Horn's trademark as a producer. Skip it." [...] Alexis Petridis of The Guardian has been the harshest on the LP, calling it [...] "awful beyond measure" [...] and [...] "everything bad that people say about the music industry: it's wasteful, it's stupid, it has no interest in actual music." ...|$|E

500|$|Justin Chang of Variety {{gave the}} film a {{positive}} review, saying [...] "This macabre musical {{about a young}} bridegroom who mistakenly weds a girl from beyond the grave is an endearingly schizoid Frankenstein of a movie, by turns relentlessly high-spirited and darkly poignant." [...] Kirk Honeycutt of The Hollywood Reporter gave the film a positive review, calling it [...] "A wondrous flight of fancy, a stop-motion-animated treat brimming with imaginative characters, evocative sets, sly humor, inspired songs and a genuine whimsy that seldom finds its way into today's movies." [...] Michael Atkinson of The Village Voice gave the film a positive review, saying [...] "The variety of its cadaverous style is never less than inspired; never has the human skull's natural grin been redeployed so exhaustively for yuks." [...] Owen Gleiberman of Entertainment Weekly gave the film a B, saying [...] "As an achievement in macabre visual wizardry, Tim Burton's Corpse Bride has to be reckoned some sort of marvel." [...] Manohla Dargis of The New York Times gave the film {{four out of five}} stars, saying [...] "Cinema's reinvigorated fixation with the living dead suggests {{that we are in the}} grip of an impossible longing, or perhaps it's just another movie cycle running its course. Whatever the case, there is something heartening about Mr. Burton's love for bones and rot here, if only because it suggests, despite some recent evidence, that he is not yet ready to abandon his own dark kingdom." [...] Moira MacDonald of The Seattle Times gave the film three and a half stars out of four, saying [...] "What makes Corpse Bride sing, ultimately, is the breadth of <b>imagination</b> <b>that</b> it demonstrates; creating a cluttered, textured and mysteriously beautiful world that we're loathe to leave at the end." ...|$|E
