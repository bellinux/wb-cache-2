However, some of this research suggests that as the system pressure is reduced below atmospheric, the benefits of <b>dropwise</b> condensation diminish rapidly, to the extent that, at pressures around 50 mbar the benefits of <b>dropwise</b> over filmwise are minimal. This thesis details a series of experiments which were conducted to investigate the heat transfer and pressure drop distributions in tube bundles during both <b>dropwise</b> and filmwise condensation of steam. The primary objective of the work {{was to determine the}} design implications associated with switching the mode of condensation of a electricity generating steam turbine condenser from the current filmwise mode, to <b>dropwise.</b> Experimental data were obtained from a new purpose build apparatus containing seventy-five, 150 mm long titanium tubes, arranged in an in line configuration of five columns and fifteen rows. <b>Dropwise</b> and filmwise data were recorded from each row at test cell inlet pressures down to 50 mbar using both pure steam and steam air mixtures. Filmwise heat transfer data indicated that, under most conditions, heat transfer coefficients were generally in agreement with those obtained by previous workers. Heat transfer data obtained during <b>dropwise</b> condensation suggested that the benefits of <b>dropwise</b> condensation are not significantly diminished at low pressure, and that, unlike filmwise condensation, inundation has little or no effect in a fifteen row bundle. The data also indicated that the pressure drop characteristics and effects of air are, within experimental error, identical during both modes of condensation and in line with models and theories proposed by previous workers...|$|E
40|$|The {{influence}} {{of the difference between}} a smooth and a rough surface on the heat transfer by condensation of saturated steam are investigated experimentally. About a rough surface an experiment on a method for long continuation of <b>dropwise</b> condensation is made. The results are obtained as follows: (1) The coefficients of heat transfer by <b>dropwise</b> and filmwise condensation have no conspicuous difference respectively between a smooth and a rough surface in the region of this experiment. (2) The surface of sintered alloy having enough condensing promoter keeps up the <b>dropwise</b> condensation for a long time...|$|E
40|$|The heat {{transfer}} by <b>dropwise</b> and filmwise condensation of saturated steam on a smooth and horizontal downword surface are investigated experimentally, {{and the results}} are obtained as follows: (1) The coefficients of {{heat transfer}} by <b>dropwise</b> and filmwise condesation are almost independent of the magnitude of heat flux, the flow rate of cooling water and the temperature difference of saturated steam and condensing surface. (2) The coefficients of heat transfer by <b>dropwise</b> condensation on horizontal downword surface are a few times smaller than that on vertical or inclined surface. ...|$|E
