50|$|The above opening moves {{which emerged}} from {{computer}} analysis demonstrate {{that a number}} of opening moves that were unquestioned for many decades are now considered suboptimal. One example is the move 13/11-13/8 on the roll 5-2. Although not a bad move, the alternative choice preferred by the analyses, 24/22-13/8, is now generally agreed upon to be optimal. In other cases, computer analysis has resulted in alternative strategies that were not seriously considered in the past. For instance, the opening move 8/2-6/2 for a roll of 6-4 was in the past greeted with disdain from experts (making the 2-point instead of trying for a higher <b>home</b> <b>point),</b> but turns out to be on average as effective as the usual plays (24/14 and 24/18-13/9).|$|E

These two wins, along with wins against Louisville and Syracuse made Gottfried the first coach to beat all ACC Hall of Fame coaches in the same year. They made it to the quarterfinals of the ACC tournament where they lost to Duke, and were selected as an 8 seed in the NCAA tournament where they made the Sweet Sixteen, upsetting #1 Villanova along the way.|$|E
50|$|September {{began with}} Forest giving Millwall an early lead in a hardly fought match. However Blackstock struck again late on {{to earn a}} point, {{salvaging}} Forest's unbeaten home record stretching from a year earlier. The next game saw McGugan get his first start of the season, which proved to pay off. Forest dominated the game and unlucky to go in at the break losing. However, McGugan scored two brilliant goals to give his side their first away win {{of the season and}} was the beginning of an excellent run of form for the player. Forest met Hull City in front of the Sky Sports cameras and played out a bore-draw 0-0. Forest's next game had nothing boring about it though. McGugan scored two more for himself as well as Radoslaw Majewski scoring one to see Forest comfortable beat promotion hopefuls Swansea City with class. A late consolation for The Swans could do nothing to stop Forest claiming an impressive 3 points. Paul McKenna then got his first goal of the season, all be it with a lot of luck, from outside the area to help Forest earn another <b>home</b> <b>point</b> against Sheffield United.|$|E

He ranked among the AHL's top goaltenders with 29 wins (T4th), a 2.43 goals-against average (10th), 0.922 save percentage (T4th) and six shutouts (3rd).

Coreau made 11 starts in December and finished with a 9-2-0 record with a 1.92 GAA and a [...]938 save percentage during a historic month for the Griffins. Grand Rapids extended its franchise-record winning streak to 15 games in December before a 3-2 defeat at Lake Erie on December 27 halted the run. The Griffins concluded December with a 10-2-0-0 record, marking the best December winning percentage in the franchise's history. Coreau's season ranked among the best in single-season franchise history, ranking ninth in minutes, tied for fifth in wins, first in road shutouts (four), tied for first in total shutouts, fifth in saves, first in overtime home wins (three) and tied for 10th in save percentage. He set a franchise record with a 12-game home winning streak and a 12-game home unbeaten streak, from October 21, 2015 to January 15, 2016.

50|$|Forest {{kicked off}} the 2008-09 season with a goalless home draw against Reading before {{suffering}} their first league defeat in the Championship in a 3-1 loss at Swansea City. With four strikers injured, Forest secured the loan signing of Manchester United forward Lee Martin. Martin started the scoring in the 3-2 success over Watford with a 25-yard curler; the victory was Forest's first of the Championship campaign. Robert Earnshaw netted his first league goal for the club in the victory, with Nathan Tyson, returning from injury, taking just four minutes after stepping off the bench to net the winner to put Forest 14th in the league table. Forest finished the month with a 5-1 defeat to Wolves, who went top of the Championship following the result. This marked Tyson's first {{start of the season}} after a hamstring injury. Forest picked up one point in five games during September in a 0-0 home draw against Charlton sandwiched by 2-1 loses to both Burnley and Preston, and losses at Plymouth and Sheffield Wednesday. Forest then lost their first two games in October with a 2-0 home loss to Crystal Palace and a 2-1 defeat at QPR. They won a <b>home</b> <b>point</b> against Ipswich Town but lost again four days later to Cardiff City, with both goals conceded both penalties. This run of poor form saw Forest prop up the Championship. With two away games coming up, it was being touted that manager Colin Calderwood faced the sack if they could not record a victory, but they did with a 2-1 away victory at Crystal Palace, with goals coming from midfielders Chris Cohen and Matt Thornhill. This was Forest's first win in ten games and in more than two months, and saw Forest them off the foot of the league.|$|E
50|$|On 25 August 2013, Sassuolo {{played their}} first-ever Serie A match, a 2-0 loss away at Torino. The team's second match {{was their first}} at home, against Livorno, where striker Simone Zaza scored Sassuolo's first top-flight goal as they lost 4-1. On 22 September 2013, Sassuolo endured a heavy 7-0 defeat at home to Internazionale. The team earned their first point in their fifth match, on 25 September away to Napoli. Zaza {{equalised}} as the game finished 1-1, ending the hosts' perfect start to the season. This {{was followed by a}} first <b>home</b> <b>point</b> on 29 September, a 2-2 draw with Lazio. On 20 October 2013, Sassuolo won their first Serie A game, defeating Bologna 2-1 at home with goals from Domenico Berardi and Antonio Floro Flores, moving the club off bottom place. Sassuolo won away {{for the first time in}} Serie A on 3 November against Sampdoria, with Berardi scoring their first top-flight hat-trick to win 4-3. Since the following match, a 1-1 draw at Roma on 10 November, the club has been outside the relegation zone. On 12 January 2014, Berardi was the only player in the season to score four goals in a game, as Sassuolo came from 2-0 down to win 4-3 against Milan. Towards the end of January 2014, Sassuolo were in bottom place and so manager Di Francesco was relieved of his duties and Alberto Malesani was brought in. The managerial change did not have the desired effects and so in early March, Sassuolo re-entrust the side to the management of Di Francesco. Sassuolo won its away match against Fiorentina 4-3 on 6 May 2014, and after winning 4-2 against Genoa on 11 May, Sassuolo guaranteed its place in Serie A for the 2014-15 season. Berardi finished in equal 7th place in the Serie A top scorers list, with 16 goals for the season.|$|E

A strong Yeovil reserves side faced Radstock Town in the Somerset Premier Cup, Yeovil won the game 8-0 with a first half hat trick from Paddy Madden.

On 15 October, Yeovil played local side Wincanton Town to formally switch on the club's new floodlights. The Glovers won the friendly 8-0. Scottish under-21 midfielder Fraser Fyvie arrived on loan from Wigan Athletic on loan until 1 January. Yeovil returned to Championship action, on 19 October, with a home match against Brighton & Hove Albion and picked up their first <b>home</b> <b>point</b> of the season with a 0-0 draw. New loan player Fyvie's debut only lasted 22 minutes after suffering a [...] "grade two shoulder injury" [...] keeping him out of action for around a month. In midweek Yeovil faced Conference South side Dorchester Town, Yeovil beating the Dorset club 6-0 in a friendly. On 25 October, the club announced that Wolves keeper Hennessey had extended his loan for a final month until 17 November. The following day Yeovil faced high flying Nottingham Forest at Huish Park. An eighth-minute opener from Ed Upson set Yeovil on their way before Forest's Simon Cox had a penalty saved by Wayne Hennessey. Upson completed his brace with a goal from 25 yards, and although Forest immediately replied through Nathaniel Chalobah, Yeovil extended their lead just before half time when Byron Webster headed in from an Upson corner. Yeovil held on to win their first home league game of the season. On 31 October, the club announced the extension of Everton defender Shane Duffy's loan by a further month.|$|E
