5|$|The multifidus muscles run up {{and down}} along the back of the spine, and are {{important}} for keeping the spine straight and stable during many common movements such as sitting, walking and lifting. A problem with these muscles is often found in someone with chronic low back pain, because the back pain causes the person to use the back muscles improperly in trying to avoid the pain. The problem with the multifidus muscles continues even after the pain goes away, and is probably an important reason why the pain comes back. Teaching people with chronic low back pain <b>how</b> <b>to</b> <b>use</b> <b>these</b> muscles is recommended as part of a recovery program.|$|E
25|$|Developments {{in other}} fields of science: DNA {{analysis}} has had an impact in various areas of history either confirming established historical theories or presenting new evidence that undermines the current established historical explanation. Professor Andrew Sherratt, a British prehistorian, was responsible for introducing the work of anthropological writings on the consumption of currently legal and illegal drugs and <b>how</b> <b>to</b> <b>use</b> <b>these</b> papers to explain certain aspects of prehistoric societies. Carbon dating, the examination of ice cores and tree rings, palynology, SEM analysis of early metal samples, and measuring oxygen isotopes in bones, have all provided new data {{in the last few}} decades with which to argue new hypotheses. Extracting ancient DNA allows scientists to argue whether or not humans are partly descended from Neanderthals.|$|E
500|$|The player {{must use}} {{resource}} management to survive. Items that help sustain the player, {{such as food}} and healing items, are in limited supply, and the player must figure out <b>how</b> <b>to</b> <b>use</b> <b>these</b> most advantageously {{in order to survive}} in the dungeon. USGamer further considers [...] "stamina decay" [...] as another feature related to resource management. The player's character constantly needs to find food to survive or will die from hunger, which prevents the player from exploiting health regeneration by simply either passing turns {{for a long period of}} time or fighting very weak monsters at low level dungeons. Rich Carlson, one of the creators of an early roguelike-like Strange Adventures in Infinite Space, called this aspect a sort of [...] "clock", imposing some type of deadline or limitation on how much the player can explore and creating tension in the game.|$|E

2500|$|Plato (427-347 BC) is {{a philosopher}} {{that is highly}} esteemed by the Greeks. There {{is a story that}} he had inscribed above the {{entrance}} to his famous school, [...] "Let none ignorant of geometry enter here." [...] However, the story is considered to be untrue. Though he was not a mathematician himself, his views on mathematics had great influence. Mathematicians thus accepted his belief that geometry should use no tools but compass and straightedge – never measuring instruments such as a marked ruler or a protractor, because these were a workman’s tools, not worthy of a scholar. This dictum led to a deep study of possible compass and straightedge constructions, and three classic construction problems: <b>how</b> <b>to</b> <b>use</b> <b>these</b> tools to trisect an angle, to construct a cube twice the volume of a given cube, and to construct a square equal in area to a given circle. The proofs of the impossibility of these constructions, finally achieved in the 19th century, led to important principles regarding the deep structure of the real number system. Aristotle (384-322 BC), Plato’s greatest pupil, wrote a treatise on methods of reasoning used in deductive proofs (see Logic) which was not substantially improved upon until the 19th century.|$|E

They were doubtless a key to the mystery, but until a clew was given they were absolutely useless. I sat for hours staring at them. I would have gone back and replaced them in the cabinet and left all as it had been before, but I dared not enter the room again. The next day I heard you say that you suspected that the talk with your father had been overheard, and that the man who had earlier in the evening before shot at him had returned, and while listening had heard something said about the hiding place, and thought that he would find some sort of treasure there.

60|$|Besides, what {{arguments}} so prevailing as such as are purely gospel? To instance a few--(1.) What {{stronger than}} a free forgiveness of sins? 'A certain man had two debtors, the one owed five hundred pence, {{and the other}} fifty; and when {{they had nothing to}} pay, he frankly forgave them both; tell me therefore which of them will love him most?' (Luke 7:41,42,47). (2.) What stronger argument to holiness than to see that though forgiveness comes free to us, yet it cost Christ Jesus heart-blood to obtain it for us. 'Herein is love, not that we loved God, but that he loved us, and sent his Son to be the propitiation for our sins.' And this love of God in giving his Christ, and of Christ in dying for us, there is no argument stronger to prevail with a sensible and awakened sinner to judge 'he should live to him that died for him, and rose again' (2 Cor 5:15). (3.) What stronger argument to holiness than this: 'If any man sin, we have an advocate with the Father, Jesus Christ the righteous?' (1 John 2:1). Unsanctified and graceless wretches know not <b>how</b> <b>to</b> <b>use</b> <b>these</b> words of God; the hypocrites also fly in our faces because we thus urge them; but a heart that is possessed with gospel ingenuity, or, to speak more properly, that is possessed with gospel grace, and with divine considerations, cries, If it be thus, O let me never sin against God, 'for the love of Christ constraineth me' (2 Cor 5:14). (4.) What greater argument to holiness than to see the holy Scriptures so furnished with promises of grace and salvation by Christ, that a man can hardly cast his eye into the Bible but he espieth one or other of them? Who would not live in such a house, or be servant to such a prince, who, besides his exceeding in good conditions, hath gold and silver as common in his palace as stones are by the highway side? 'Having, therefore, these promises, dearly beloved, let us cleanse ourselves from all filthiness of the flesh and spirit, perfecting holiness in the fear of God' (2 Cor 7:1). (5.) What greater argument to holiness than to have our performances, though weak and infirm from us, yet accepted of God in Jesus Christ (1 Peter 2:4-6). (6.) What greater argument to holiness than to have our soul, our body, our life, hid and secured with Christ in God? 'Mortify therefore your members which are upon the earth, fornication, uncleanness, inordinate affection, evil concupiscence, and covetousness, which is idolatry' (Col 3:1-5). (7.) What greater argument to holiness than to be made the members of the body, of the flesh, and of the bones of Jesus Christ? 'Shall I then take the members of Christ, and make them the members of an harlot? God forbid' (Eph 5:30; 1 Cor 6:15).|$|E
