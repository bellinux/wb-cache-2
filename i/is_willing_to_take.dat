25|$|The group {{now faces}} the {{additional}} burden {{of having to}} take care of a baby and a dog. They initially try to give Karli to another family on the island, but no-one <b>is</b> <b>willing</b> <b>to</b> <b>take</b> him in. As the group realize they have no choice but to take Karli with them, Sigurd finally catches up after having chased them for 16 days. Thorfinn distracts Sigurd by lying to him that Gudrid already died at sea. However, as he is lamenting his failure, Sigurd spots Gudrid and Full-Eyes climbing up a hill. Enraged, Sigurd gives chase but Gudrid and Full-Eyes escape by jumping from the cliff into the sea and swimming to the ship. In order to shake off Sigurd, Leif decides to sail further north.|$|E
25|$|The Sorting Hat is a sapient {{artefact}} used at Hogwarts, {{which uses}} Legilimency (essentially, {{the ability to}} read minds) to determine which of the four school houses – Gryffindor, Hufflepuff, Ravenclaw or Slytherin – each new student is to be assigned for their years at Hogwarts. The hat resembles a dilapidated conical leather wide-brimmed wizard's hat, with folds and tears that make it appear to have eyes and a mouth. During the opening banquet {{at the beginning of each}} school year, the Hat is placed on every first-year student's head. The Hat announces its choice aloud, and the student joins the selected house. The Hat speaks to the student while they're being sorted and <b>is</b> <b>willing</b> <b>to</b> <b>take</b> the student's preferences into account when it makes its decision. Sometimes it does not have the need to do so: for instance, the Hat barely touched Draco Malfoy's head before sending him to Slytherin. The Sorting Hat had a difficult time placing Harry, almost placing him into Slytherin house before he requested specifically and emphatically not to be. The Hat instead placed him into Gryffindor, the house of his parents. Rowling has stated the reason for the Hat's indecision as to which house to place him into was because it sensed the part of Voldemort's soul within Harry.|$|E
500|$|When he {{is about}} 30, Widmerpool becomes engaged to a {{considerably}} older widow, Mildred Haycock. His main motivation appears to be his craving for social status; she {{is the daughter of}} Lord Vowchurch. In his analysis of Powell's works, Nicholas Birns wrote: [...] "What Widmerpool wants to do is to 'marry up', to make a marriage that will cement his upward social mobility, and he <b>is</b> <b>willing</b> <b>to</b> <b>take</b> an older woman with two teenage children in order to accomplish this." [...] The engagement ends abruptly, over Widmerpool's impotence during an attempted premarital sexual union.|$|E

In the episode, Mulder and Scully are called in when a {{boatload}} of survivors from a U.S. Navy destroyer escort are found. What particularly catches Agent Mulder's attention {{is that all of}} these sailors appear to have aged many decades {{in the course of a}} few days. Mulder and Scully travel to Norway where they find a civilian fisherman who <b>is</b> <b>willing</b> <b>to</b> <b>take</b> them to the ship's last known position.

In his work he <b>is</b> <b>willing</b> <b>to</b> <b>take</b> on the sadness, the irony, the ugliness and the beauty. But not all of Gottfried's work is on a canvas. A lot of it is the way he's {{approached}} life. And it doesn't take someone knowing him to know that. You take one look at the paintings and you say [...] "this guy has been around."

A computer genius, he almost uncovered {{what he calls the}} [...] "Secrets of Tanagura" [...] during time as Iason's Furniture, but was caught in the act by Iason, who punished him by slashing his left cheek, which earned him a scar that he usually covers with his hair. Although he respects Riki, he <b>is</b> <b>willing</b> <b>to</b> <b>take</b> part in Iason's plans to make Riki return to Iason by manipulating Kirie. Despite his cool, seemingly uncaring nature, he cares for both Iason and Riki deeply and tries his best to look after both of them. In the audio book, he is voiced by Hōchū Ōtsuka. In the 1990s OVAs, he is voiced by Hideyuki Tanaka. In the later drama CDs and remake OVAs, he is voiced by Shin-ichiro Miki.|$|E
2500|$|The natural {{sciences}} have no universal standard for authorship, but some major multi-disciplinary journals and institutions have established guidelines for {{work that they}} publish. The journal Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America (PNAS) has an editorial policy that specifies [...] "authorship {{should be limited to}} those who have contributed substantially to the work" [...] and furthermore, [...] "authors are strongly encouraged to indicate their specific contributions" [...] as a footnote. The American Chemical Society further specifies that authors are those who also [...] "share responsibility and accountability for the results" [...] and the U.S. National Academies specify [...] "an author who <b>is</b> <b>willing</b> <b>to</b> <b>take</b> credit for a paper must also bear responsibility for its contents. Thus, unless a footnote or the text of the paper explicitly assigns responsibility for different parts of the paper to different authors, the authors whose names appear on a paper must share responsibility for all of it." ...|$|E

2500|$|In the Palestinian {{elections}} of January 2006, Saadat {{was elected to}} the Palestinian legislature. The newly elected Hamas government announced its intention to release Ze'evi's assassins. Hamas leader Khaled Mashaal told Arab-Israeli newspaper Kul al-Arab that his organization would positively consider Saadat's release, saying [...] "Hamas' objects to the imprisonment of Palestinians in PA jails, especially those under US and British supervision, {{as is the case in}} the Jericho prison. Therefore, their release will be our new government's top priority; it is natural that we begin a process for their release to strengthen our position so we will be able to act for the release of those held in Israeli prisons". Palestinian Authority Chairman, Mahmoud Abbas, said [...] "I see no problem in releasing him , but the Israel government is threatening to kill him—and then who will be held responsible if he gets killed or hurt? If the PLFP <b>is</b> <b>willing</b> <b>to</b> <b>take</b> responsibility, then I have no objection—I'll release him; then he and the PLFP will suffer the consequences. The minute he leaves prison an Apache will kill him".|$|E
2500|$|After Smith's {{death in}} 1844, Jacobs stood by while Zina was sealed to Smith in the Nauvoo Temple. Later in life, she called herself Joseph's [...] "widow." [...] Zina {{was present at}} the meeting at which Brigham Young was chosen to lead the church, after Young spoke with the voice and {{appearance}} of Smith. Because she believed him to be God's chosen leader, she consented when Young, 20 years her senior, claimed he acted as Smith's proxy, proposed they be married for time (as many other members of the Quorum of the Twelve did with Smith's other plural wives). They were married February 2, 1846, {{and at the same time}} she was re-sealed to Smith for eternity. At this point, Young and other church leaders considered her civil marriage to Jacobs canceled, superseded by the spiritual marriages, though no formal divorce was ever documented. In October 1861, Brigham would go on to assert, [...] "There was another way—in which a woman could leave a man—if the woman preferred—another man higher in authority and he <b>is</b> <b>willing</b> <b>to</b> <b>take</b> her. And her husband gives her up—there is no Bill of divorce required in the case it is right in the sight of God." [...] In May 1846, Young called Henry Jacobs to serve a mission to England. During Jacobs's absence, Zina began living openly in a marital relationship with Young and continued to do so for the rest of her life. [...] She had one child with Young, Zina Prescinda Young, in 1850.|$|E
