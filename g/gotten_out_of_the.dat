However, Xenix was never sold to end users directly although it was licensed to many software OEMs for resale. It grew to become the most popular version of Unix, measured by the number of machines running it (note that Unix is a multi-user operating system, allowing simultaneous access to a machine by several users). By the mid-1980s Microsoft had <b>gotten</b> <b>out</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Unix business, except for an interest in SCO.|$|E

The bill was introduced by John Conyers, Jr. of Michigan and heard by the Judiciary Committee of the House but not passed. Conyers re-introduced the bill in 2009 as the John Hope Franklin Tulsa-Greenwood Race Riot Claims Accountability Act of 2009 (H.R. 1843), and in 2012.

[...] Newsweek wrote: [...] "In Phases and stages (Nelson) looked far beyond country music's traditional shore of self pity toward a clear vision of real life country divorce".|$|E

During the shooting of an underwater sequence, a few electrical lights were used. The electricians changed the lines, creating a short circuit which resulted in the death of one of the unit members.

Mr. Gold then offers a deal for Emma in which he'll give up his questionable claim to the child and in return, Emma will owe him a favor. Emma agrees. After she leaves, Sean shows up to see his child, and they name the girl Alexandra. Later, Emma agrees to Graham's offer to become his deputy.

2500|$|At {{the time}} of the uprising, most of elite German units had left the city, but twenty-thousand German {{soldiers}} remained, armed with about eighty tanks and sixty artillery pieces. While the Resistance had about twenty-thousand fighters, they had only sixty hand guns, a few machine guns, and no heavy weapons. [...] Nonetheless, on the morning of August 20, a small group of Resistance fighters, led by Léo Hamon, walked into the office of Marcel Flouret, the new Prefect of Paris at the Hôtel de Ville and demanded that he hand over the building. The Prefect asked to see his papers and Hamon replied, [...] "We've <b>gotten</b> <b>out</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> habit of that kind of thing." [...] Hamon placed the Prefect and the member of the Municipal Council under arrest, and occupied the building. Rol-Tanguy commanded the uprising from a bunker twenty-six meters beneath the statue of the Lion de Belfort, Place Denfert-Rochereau, which communicated with the catacombs. Parisians cut down trees and tore up paving stones to build barricades. Scattered sniping and street fighting broke out between the Germans, the Milice and the Resistance; prisoners were executed on both sides. The Resistance took weapons from fallen Germans, and even captured trucks and even tanks, but neither side had enough military power to defeat the other.|$|E
