5|$|A pimp rapes Number 18 in a bar, then enslaves her sexually. Number 18's {{father died}} when she was young and her family {{struggled}} to support her thereafter. Strangers took her from her home in Cambodia as a child, replaced her name with a number, and prostituted her in various countries. Number 18 ends up in the Thai child prostitution industry. Most of her clients are rich men, many of them foreign tourists. In a brothel and bar called The Pearl, Number 18 is kept <b>in</b> <b>a</b> <b>dark</b> <b>room</b> containing only a table and a dilapidated bed. Whenever she fails to follow the orders of Mama, the brothel-keeper, Mama shouts at her and beats her. Number 18 prays for a man to come and save her from these ordeals. At the same time she becomes the most elegant and highly sought-after prostitute at The Pearl and her pimp's favourite. She becomes very proficient in pleasing men sexually but also remains childlike—she dries her face with her skirt and plays with its hem.|$|E
5|$|Black's fellow Group members {{arrive to}} help, {{though he had}} not yet {{contacted}} any of them. They set up roadblocks throughout the city but are unsuccessful in finding Catherine. Black returns home, where his colleague Peter Watts (Terry O'Quinn) tells him about trying to conceive a son with his wife. Watts had once been assigned to a child-murder case in which the dismembered infant's body had been found in a cooler. He believed that God would reward him with his longed-for son if he could find the killer—years later, he still only has his three daughters, which has caused him to realize it is impossible to sacrifice one thing to gain another. Watts then has a Group member install software on Black's computer, allowing him access to sensitive documents—Black comments that he thought he already had full access before. Watts also explains that the Group's interest in Black is the reason for the Polaroid Man's actions. Elsewhere, the Polaroid Man ties up Catherine <b>in</b> <b>a</b> <b>dark</b> <b>room.</b>|$|E
5|$|The video {{begins with}} the singer recalling {{memories}} from a hangover, including images of whiskey, a shoe in a chandelier, and her making out with a man flash on the screen, particularly getting a bottle of whiskey and drinking it with him. In the following scene, Lo is seen at a tea party with four other women and the waitresses, where they drink champagne amongst an array of cakes and cupcakes. As the video flashes white, it shows {{a glimpse of the}} other women's fantasies. Then, Lo becomes drunk, takes her shirt off, smears cake on her face, pours champagne on herself and starts to dance with her guests and the waitresses. In the following scene, she makes out with the man she was drinking with. The visual ends with the singer being at home while vomiting into a sink. Scenes interspersed through the main plot portray Lo <b>in</b> <b>a</b> <b>dark</b> <b>room,</b> with mascara dripping from her eyes while doing activities such as blowing bubble gum, eating melting ice cream, and smoking a cigarette.|$|E

5|$|Monster's Ball II {{was held}} at Bound for Glory. Rhino, Abyss, Sabu, and Jeff Hardy all participated in the match. James Mitchell {{accompanied}} Abyss to the ring. In a Monster's Ball match, pinfalls and submissions count anywhere. There are no disqualifications or count-outs and weapons are supplied and welcomed. It is called Monster's Ball because in the storyline each wrestler has supposedly been locked <b>in</b> <b>a</b> <b>dark</b> <b>room</b> for the preceding 24 hours without food or water. In the very beginning, Sabu started bleeding from his right eye, while Hardy had blood {{coming out of a}} cut on his arm. Midway through the bout, Rhino also started to bleed. Hardy laid Abyss on a table and then ascended {{to the top of the}} Bound for Glory set. He then jumped off in a somersault and landed on Abyss. Eventually both Abyss and Hardy recovered, leading to Rhino tackling Abyss through a table with his signature Gore maneuver. Afterwards, Rhino drove Hardy's head into the mat with his signature Rhino Driver maneuver from the second ring rope and followed with a pin to win the match at 12 minutes and 20 seconds. After this match, Larry Zbyszko announced that a Ten-Man Gauntlet match would be held later in the show to determine who would face Jarrett for the NWA World Heavyweight Championship.|$|E
5|$|Nefarious covers human {{trafficking}} in the United States, Western and Eastern Europe, and Southeast Asia. Interviews are interspersed with re-enactments. The film {{opens with a}} re-enactment of a girl being kidnapped by organized criminals. She is confined with other girls <b>in</b> <b>a</b> <b>dark</b> <b>room,</b> lit by a flickering lightbulb. Men order the girls to remove their clothes, and then examine them and shout commands and threats at them, causing them to cry from fear. One girl is dragged into another room. A victim of ordeals such as these, speaking in voiceover, explains that, in this situation, girls are often taken into a separate room to have their sexual performance tested. Identifying these events as taking place near Belgrade, Serbia, the film then tracks the fictional girls through Croatia to Amsterdam's red-light district De Wallen, and to sex markets in Berlin and Las Vegas. The film states that this slavery goes unnoticed in cities where prostitution is legal. Slaves are depicted in confinement, at their places of work, and as they are sold. Many of the girls are orphans, and all are either kidnapped or tricked into forced prostitution. Traffickers in the film use hard drugs, brainwashing and sexual and physical abuse to keep the girls under control.|$|E
5|$|The video {{begins with}} a shot of Minogue posing <b>in</b> <b>a</b> <b>dark</b> <b>room,</b> dressed in a {{sparkling}} costume on which rainbow-lighting is projected. She is then shown {{in front of a}} wall wearing a flowing maroon dress. As the intro ends and the first verse commences, Minogue appears in a hall and performs various dance routine with numerous female dancers clad in nude bodysuits. The singer's attire consists of a pleated red organza dress designed by Austrian fashion designer Helmut Lang (in 2006, Minogue donated this costume to the Arts Centre Melbourne museum, where it is displayed in the Kylie Minogue Collection). Shots of the dancers in kaleidoscopic arrangements are intercut. A few seconds later, Minogue and a man dance together alone in a hall. Their dance ends with the man slowly laying Minogue {{down on the floor and}} leaving. Twelve women in golden and pastel pink dresses are seen dancing on a dark brown floor, which is revealed to be Minogue's hat as the camera pans out. She proceeds to wave to a distant person and then plucks the petals out of a pink rose she is holding. The rest of the video randomly intersperses all of the previous scenes.|$|E
50|$|The {{sets and}} {{atmospheric}} lighting {{used in the}} film {{are based on the}} backgrounds of the paintings by Vermeer. Paintings by Schalcken showing young women holding candles <b>in</b> <b>a</b> <b>dark</b> <b>rooms</b> are used throughout the drama, but the final image, again showing a young candlelit woman, but this time with <b>a</b> man <b>in</b> the shadowy background drawing his sword, was created for the film, based on the style of Schalcken.|$|R

25|$|The first {{experiments}} with RGB in early color photography {{were made in}} 1861 by Maxwell himself, and involved the process of combining three color-filtered separate takes.

25|$|In Tibetan Buddhism, the {{luminous}} mind (Tibetan: gsal ba) is often equated with the Yogacara concept of svasaṃvedana (reflexive awareness).

50|$|Belladonna was {{featured}} {{on the cover of}} metalcore band Asking Alexandria's sophomore album titled Reckless & Relentless, where she is seen sitting <b>in</b> <b>a</b> dirty, <b>dark</b> <b>room.</b> She is also later featured in their short film Through Sin + Self Destruction.|$|R

25|$|In the 2004 German film Der Untergang (Downfall), Adolf Hitler {{is shown}} sitting <b>in</b> <b>a</b> <b>dark</b> <b>room</b> forlornly gazing at a {{painting}} of Frederick, possibly {{a reference to the}} dictator's fading hopes for another Miracle of the House of Brandenburg. This is based on an incident witnessed by Rochus Misch.|$|E
25|$|He was {{the first}} to observe and report the {{phenomenon}} of thermophoresis in aerosols. He spotted it surrounding hot objects while investigating the Tyndall Effect with focused lightbeams <b>in</b> <b>a</b> <b>dark</b> <b>room.</b> He devised a better way to demonstrate it, and then simply reported it (1870), without investigating the physics of it in depth.|$|E
25|$|In particular, {{it must be}} {{very clear}} that...the {{unambiguous}} use of spatiotemporal concepts {{in the description of}} atomic phenomena must be limited to the registration of observations which refer to images on a photographic lens or to analogous practically irreversible effects of amplification such as the formation of a drop of water around an ion <b>in</b> <b>a</b> <b>dark</b> <b>room.</b>|$|E
60|$|It is humbly {{submitted}} to consideration, whether {{the project would}} not be better, if the persons of true fame meet <b>in</b> <b>a</b> middle room, those of dubious existence <b>in</b> <b>an</b> upper room, and those of evil fame <b>in</b> <b>a</b> lower <b>dark</b> <b>room.</b>|$|R

25|$|Keyboards and keypads may be {{illuminated}} from inside, {{especially on}} equipment for mobile use. Illumination facilitates {{the use of}} the keyboard or keypad in dark environments. Some gaming keyboards have lighted keys, {{to make it easier for}} gamers to find command keys while playing <b>in</b> <b>a</b> <b>dark</b> <b>room.</b> Some keyboards may have small LED lights in a few important function keys, to remind users that the function is activated (see photo).|$|E
25|$|On 19 January 1794, the Simons {{left the}} Temple, after {{securing}} a receipt for the safe transfer of their ward, who was declared {{to be in}} good health. A large part of the Temple records from that time onward disappeared under the Bourbon Restoration, making knowledge of the facts impossible. Two days after the departure of the Simons, Louis-Charles is said by the Restoration historians to have been put <b>in</b> <b>a</b> <b>dark</b> <b>room</b> which was barricaded like the cage of a wild animal. The story runs that food was passed through the bars to the boy, who survived despite the accumulated filth of his surroundings.|$|E

25|$|The {{music video}} {{was shot by}} {{director}} Yuri Kanchiku. It depicts miwa <b>in</b> <b>a</b> <b>dark</b> <b>room</b> with several free-standing doorways.

The first time, it is set up for a frivolous banquet, with many different people dressed formally. The second time she enters it, the room is set up {{as if it were a}} busy park sidewalk, with many people dressed in work clothes ignoring her. She decides to sit down at a park bench. miwa later finds a birdcage, and the scene switches to depicting her trapped inside the birdcage, with the floor littered with sheet music.|$|E
25|$|Bascom {{started making}} portraits in 1801 by tracing the shadow {{cast of the}} sitter by lamp- or candlelight on drawing paper placed on a wall <b>in</b> <b>a</b> <b>dark</b> <b>room.</b> At that time, cutting {{profiles}} was a popular parlor game and an inexpensive form of art. She didn't seem to make many portraits {{in the first decade}} or so of the 19th century; she recorded making portraits just seven times between 1801 and 1808, and {{there was no mention of}} profiles again until 1818, when she made them of the recently deceased son and wife of A. Gould. In 1819 she began making profiles in the evenings. The subject's features and other details were drawn with a pencil.|$|E
25|$|The weak {{parts of}} this story have been {{identified}} as: the sudden and unexplained departure of the Simons; the subsequent cruel treatment of the child – keeping him <b>in</b> <b>a</b> <b>dark</b> <b>room</b> practically out of sight (unless any doubt of his identity was possible), while his sister Marie-Thérèse was in comparative comfort; the cause of death, declared to be of long standing, but in fact developing rapidly, {{and the fact that}} the disease is usually not fatal and is self-limiting; the insufficient excuse provided for the child's muteness under Gomin's regime (he had answered Barras) and the irregularities in the formalities in attending the death and the funeral, when a simple identification of the body by Marie Thérèse would have prevented any doubt of his death.|$|E
50|$|The exact {{refresh rate}} {{necessary}} to prevent the perception of flicker varies greatly based on the viewing environment. <b>In</b> <b>a</b> completely <b>dark</b> <b>room,</b> <b>a</b> sufficiently dim display can run as low as 30 Hz without visible flicker.
