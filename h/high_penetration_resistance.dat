40|$|The {{influence}} of penetration resistance, bulk density and moisture content of soil on winter triticale crop yield was investigated. The crops were grown on land {{that had not}} been cultivated for several years, and two methods of cultivation were used: direct sowing and plough-based cultivation. Winter triticale crop yields did not differ significantly regardless of the method of cultivation. Analysis of the coefficients for multiple regression showed that winter triticale crop yield was most dependent on the mass of a thousand grains and the number of grains per ear in the case of plough-based cultivation. In the case of direct sowing, the mass of a thousand grains and the number of ears per 1 m 2 had a great influence on the crop yield. Negative partial regression coefficients were obtained for penetration resistance and bulk density of the soil, indicating their inverse relationship to the crop yield. Canonical analysis was used, allowing the determination of the range of effect of penetration resistance, bulk density and moisture content (independent variables) on selected components of winter triticale crop yield (dependent variables) relative to the method of cultivation. The presented canonical analysis showed that the analysed components of the yield were 78 % dependent on the three fundamental physical parameters of the soil in the case of plough-based cultivation and 58 % dependent in the case of direct sowing. In the case of plough-based cultivation, primarily the penetration resistance and then the moisture content of the soil had the greatest influence on the variability of the components of the crop yield.

40|$|Crop yield {{variability}} {{and productivity}} below potential yield on neutral and alkaline soils in the semiarid Mediterranean-type environments of south-eastern Australia have been attributed, in part, to variable rooting depth and incomplete soil water extraction caused by {{physical and chemical}} characteristics of soil horizons below the surface. In this review these characteristics {{are referred to as}} subsoil constraints. This document reviews current information concerning subsoil constraints typical of neutral and alkaline soils in south-eastern Australia, principally salinity, sodicity, dense soils with <b>high</b> <b>penetration</b> <b>resistance,</b> waterlogging, nutrient deficiencies and ion toxicities. The review focuses on information from Australia (published and unpublished), using overseas data only where no suitable Australian data is available. An assessment of the effectiveness of current management options to address subsoil constraints is provided. These options are broadly grouped into three categories: (i) amelioration strategies, such as deep ripping, gypsum application or the use of polyacrylamides to reduce sodicity and/or bulk density, deep placement of nutrients or organic matter to overcome subsoil nutrient deficiencies or the growing of ‘primer’ crops to naturally ameliorate the soil; (ii) breeding initiatives for increased crop tolerance to toxicities such as salt and boron; and (iii) avoidance through appropriate agronomic or agro-engineering solutions. The review highlights difficulties associated with identifying the impact of any single subsoil constraint to crop production on neutral and alkaline soils in south-eastern Australia, given that multiple constraints may be present. Difficulty in clearly ranking the relative effect of particular subsoil constraints on crop production (either between constraints or in relation to other edaphic and biological factors) limits current ability to develop targeted solutions designed to overcome these constraints. Furthermore, it is recognised that the task is complicated by spatial and temporal variability of soil physicochemical properties and nutrient availability, as well as other factors such as disease and drought stress. Nevertheless, knowledge of the relative importance of particular subsoil constraints to crop production, and an assessment of impact on crop productivity, are deemed critical to the development of potential management solutions for these neutral to alkaline soils.

40|$|Despite {{more than}} 30 years of {{research}} and practical experience the interest in shallow tillage and especially direct drilling has remained low in Scandinavia. Excessive compaction of the topsoil layer {{is one of the}} major problems encountered when adapting shallow tillage and direct drilling in particular. The purpose of this study was to evaluate temporal and spatial effects of two different direct drilling techniques on bulk density and penetration resistance in the near seed environment. A sandy loam growing small grain cereals was followed during the first 3 years after conversion from conventional tillage to direct drilling to reveal short-term changes in soil structure. A field experiment with four blocks was conducted in 1999 – 2001 where a conventional mouldboard ploughing–harrowing system (PL) was compared with direct drilling performed by either a chisel coulter drill (DD-C) or a single disc drill (DD-D). Effects on density and penetration resistance were measured in the field after first, second and third year of crop establishment (T 1, T 2 and T 3). Bulk density was determined at 0 – 100 mm depth using a dual probe gamma-ray transmission system. Penetration resistance was recorded in the field at 0 – 150 mm depth. At T 2 column samples (diameter: 180 mm, height: 200 mm) were taken with the seed row through the centre. Penetration resistance was determined in these samples in a 10 mm× 10 mm grid using a micropenetrometer (3 mm cone base diameter) at 0 to approximately 150 mm depth. Two samples from each treatment were analysed by a medical CT-scanner to determine spatial differences in bulk density. Irrespective of coulter type direct drilling gave a fast compaction of the arable layer below seeding depth when shifting from mouldboard ploughing to direct drilling. Soil strength was substantially higher already in the first year of direct drilling (i. e., maximum 0. 4 and 1. 2 MPa, for PL and DD-D/DD-C, respectively). Critical <b>high</b> <b>penetration</b> <b>resistance</b> (> 2. 0 MPa) and bulk density levels (> 1. 5 g cm- 3) were reached at T 2 and remained at the same level at T 3. The DD-C direct drill produced a more favourable soil environment for crop establishment than the DD-D drill. A layer of approximately 40 mm loose granular soil above seeding depth and no indication of a direct compaction effect was found for the DD-C treatment. In contrast, the field as well as the laboratory results indicated a direct compacting effect for the DD-D drill. Despite the lack of direct compaction effect from the DD-C drill itself, evidence suggest that periodic non-inversion soil loosening of the lower part of the arable layer is needed on direct drilled sandy loam soil in a moist and cool climate...|$|E

40|$|During {{the last}} decades, manual felling and logging of forest trees by animals or small {{tractors}} evolved towards mechanized harvesting, using heavy tractors or specialized forestry machines with increasing masses. This development may cause soil degradation in forest ecosystems as the resulting soil compaction modifies soil characteristics {{that are important}} for the sustained provision of ecosystem services. Consequently, soil conditions may become unfavourable to soil fauna, herb and tree layer and in the long-term it {{may lead to a}} loss of biodiversity, soil fertility and stand productivity. The impacts of site and stand characteristics, machine weight and traffic intensity on the compaction degree were examined in a first field trial, performed in eight Flemish forest stands. If based on bulk density and penetration resistance, we generally found low compaction degrees, even on the vulnerable soil textures. Effects could be explained by high soil water contents in the clayey soils (leading to clear rut formation) and a high precompression stress (as indicated by the high initial bulk densities) on the sandy and loamy to silt loamy soils. Results showed that soil water content and initial compaction status (as an indicator for the precompression stress) should always be taken in consideration when evaluating the influence of texture on the compaction degree. Higher machine masses and traffic intensities increased the compaction degrees. Although compaction degrees remained low, increased carbon dioxide concentrations within tracks on the sandy soils showed that soil aeration was severely affected by machine traffic. These results indicated that quantification of the soil impact based on bulk density and penetration resistance may lead to an underestimation and should take more sensitive soil variables such as soil carbon dioxide concentration into account. The vulnerability to compaction is often regarded as negligible on sandy forest soils and was therefore examined in detail in a second field trial. Significant increases of bulk density and penetration resistance and a positive (logarithmic) relationship with traffic intensity were found. The application of a brash mat reduced the compaction degree. The results of both field trials were combined with international study results to draw general conclusions on the impact of mechanized harvesting. A meta-analysis was performed {{to examine the effects of}} soil texture, machine weight and traffic intensity. It showed clear compaction degrees for both clayey as sandy textures and confirmed the significant impact of the initial compaction status and machine mass. A lot of interesting studies could not be implemented due to lack of important information. Recommendations for future research were therefore formulated. Abiotic changes may yield biotic effects and these were examined in a second meta-analysis, focussing on survival, height and diameter growth of seedlings of mainly light tolerant tree species. The influence of soil compaction on seedling growth and survival was predominantly insignificant, due to strong variation in the datasets. However, they indicated a different response in accordance to soil texture, with negligible to slightly positive impacts on sandy to loamy soils and more negative impacts on silty to clayey soils. Again a lot of the performed studies lacked important information. As soil compaction induces biotic effects, fast recovery is desired. Compaction status of nine forest stands on three soil textures where the last harvesting activity took place seven to nine years ago was determined by measuring penetration resistance along transects. In all forest stands, traces of former machine traffic were found in the shape of locally increased or overall <b>high</b> <b>penetration</b> <b>resistance.</b> This means that complete recovery of compacted forest soils was certainly not achieved within seven to nine years after the last machine impact. As this is a common period between two harvesting activities, effects will accumulate and expand at subsequent harvests in case machine traffic is not restricted to permanent skid trails. A fourth field trial examined whether stimulating biological activity by means of a manipulation of litter quality, soil acidity and earthworm populations could accelerate recovery. Liming and the application of calcium-rich litter positively influenced the numbers of inoculated anecic earthworms that were retraced, with a positive feedback on soil acidity and litter decomposition. Within the short study period, small reductions of the compaction degree due to anecic worms could only be shown on the non-trafficked soil beside the wheel tracks. Unfavourable soil acidity and nutrient status probably hampered ecological restoration. We hypothesize that ecological restoration of compacted soils is possible though time-consuming, stipulating that soil conditions are favourable, particularly to anecic earthworms. An increase of their survival rate and activity is best achieved through an admixture containing species with high quality litter, which induce lower soil acidity and a better nutrient status. In this thesis we gained insight into i) the abiotic and biotic effects of soil compaction as influenced by stand, site and harvesting characteristics, ii) the compaction status of Flemish forest soils, and iii) the potential of ecological restoration options for compacted forest soils. Results showed that the risk for soil compaction should be taken into account for all texture classes when planning and preparing harvesting activities. We recommend performing harvesting activities on sandy soils at intermediate soil water contents, while on medium- to fine-textured soils very dry conditions are optimal for limitation of the soil impact. The machines used should always be tuned to the intensity and the demands of the harvesting activity and the field circumstances. We emphasize to concentrate the traffic on designated skid trails. In this way only a restricted portion of the area is damaged, enabling the soil between trails to recover from the compacted status applied during previous harvesting activities. A brash mat may be very effective to further reduce the degree of soil compaction on these trails. Admixtures with tree species that provide good quality litter, perhaps combined with liming may imply stimulation of biological activity and in the long-term a decrease of the compaction degree...|$|E
40|$|Sub) {{tropical}} {{highlands of}} the world are densely populated and intensively cropped. Agricultural sustainability problems resulting from soil erosion and fertility decline have arisen throughout this agro-ecological zone. Major changes are needed in land, livestock and water management in line with traditional lifestyles and customs to remedy the agricultural system. Can conservation agriculture, based on three basic principles (1) minimal soil movement, (2) retention of rational amounts of crop residues and (3) viable crop rotations, be an option towards these goals? It is essential to have an indication of the sustainability of a proposed agricultural system in addition to the potential, immediate benefits from introducing new technologies well before the catastrophic consequences of non-sustainability become apparent. Long-term experiments are best suited to test the sustainability of a given system. The International Maize and Wheat Improvement Centre (CIMMYT, Int.) has initiated various long-term agronomical trials (started 1991) at its semi-arid highland experiment station in Mexico (2240 masl; 19. 31 ° N, 98. 50 ° W; Cumulic Phaeozem) to investigate the long-term effects of tillage/seeding practices, crop rotations, and crop residue management on maize and wheat grown under rain fed conditions. The objective of this dissertation is to come to an integrated evaluation of the different management systems. Toward improved more stable yields? Small-scale maize and wheat farmers can obtain yield improvements through zero tillage, appropriate rotations and retention of sufficient residues (average maize and wheat yield of 5091 and 5407 kg ha− 1), compared to the common practices of heavy tillage before seeding, monocropping and crop residue removal (average maize and wheat yield of 3411 and 4267 kg ha− 1). Leaving residue on the field is critical for zero tillage practices. However, it may take some time—roughly 5 years—before the benefits become evident. After that, zero tillage with residue retention results in higher and more stable yields than alternative management. Toward increased physical and chemical soil quality? Zero tillage combined with crop residue retention improved chemical and physical conditions of the soil. Soil quality under conventional tillage was intermediate (irrespective of residue management), especially in its physical status. In contrast, zero tillage with removal of residues, led to low aggregate stability, <b>high</b> <b>penetration</b> <b>resistance,</b> surface slaking resulting in low time-to-pond values and high runoff. Throughout the growing season, the highest soil moisture content was found in zero tillage with residue retention while conventional tillage had intermediate soil moisture values. Zero tillage without residue retention had more days of soil moisture values under permanent wilting point, while zero tillage with residue retention had the least. Comparable results on the interaction between zero tillage and residue retention were obtained with permanent raised beds. Permanent raised bed planting with retention of crop residue results in more stable macroaggregates and as such a reduced erosion potential, as well as an increased protection of C and N in the microaggregates within the macroaggregates, as compared to conventionally tilled raised beds. However, the positive effect of permanent raised beds is lost when all residues are removed. Permanent raised beds with partial residue retention for both crops have provided acceptable levels of aggregate stability and C and N accumulation. Toward increased biological soil quality and soil health? Crop residue retention resulted in increased microbial biomass, micro-flora catabolic activity, increased populations of soil micro-flora that promote plant growth and suppress diseases (total bacteria, fluorescent Pseudomonas, Actinomycetes, total fungi, and Fusarium spp.) and reduced numbers of the nematode Pratylenchus thornei. The continuous, uniform supply of C from crop residues serves as an energy source for microorganisms. When residue was retained, zero tillage showed much higher microbial biomass, micro-flora catabolic activity and beneficial soil micro-flora populations than zero tillage without residue, especially for maize. Zero tillage on its own does not induce better soil health, but the combination of zero tillage with residue retention does. Zero tillage with residue removal is clearly an unsustainable practice. This highlights the importance of crop residue for dry-land rain fed production systems. The increased microbial diversity under zero tillage and residue retention may be useful for biological control and integrated pest management. In our agro-ecological environment, detrimental effects of soil-borne diseases were not observed for zero tillage with residue retention. Incidence of root rot and parasitic nematode populations were not correlated with yield. Although root diseases may have affected crop performance, they affected yield less than the positive effects of other critical plant growth factors such as infiltration and water availability. Toward a time efficient use of resources? The NDVI-handheld sensor was evaluated as a tool for crop monitoring and to provide within season prediction of yield. The handheld sensor is a non-destructive system that samples at a very high rate and, compared to other methods, can easily and time-efficiently measure a representative area for a plot. Final maize yield and biomass could be predicted 2. 5 months before harvest by combining NDVI {{from the beginning of the}} season and NDVI measured at the beginning of the reproductive phase (coefficient of correlation in calibration ≥ 0. 921 and 0. 935 respectively). For wheat the period immediately after flowering is critical for yield prediction. The NDVI based crop growth curves clearly reflected crop performance and can explain in-season stress factors. Zero tillage induced different crop growth dynamics over time compared to conventional tillage. Zero tillage with residue retention is characterized by a slower, early crop growth, totally compensated for by an increased growth in the later stages, positively influencing final grain yield. Zero tillage with partial residue retention gave similar crop growth compared with full residue retention, indicating a promising potential to remove part of the straw for other uses (fodder, fuel etc.). Zero tillage with residue removal had low NDVI values throughout the growing season. Zero tillage with (partial) retention of crop residues results in time efficient use of resources, as opposed to conventional tillage, regardless of residue management, and zero tillage with residue removal. Toward a spatial efficient use of resources? The coefficient of variation (CV) for the NDVI measurement sequence in each plot was determined. Zero tillage systems without surface residue retention produced high CVs of the NDVI sequence and high spatial crop variability throughout the season, even after the vegetative period, as opposed to zero tillage with residue retention. Increased spatial variability throughout the season might reflect agronomical mismanagement leading to inefficient use of critical plant growth resources and increased fertility gradients. When one or more critical elements in the soil are limited, plant-to-plant competition will increase plant-to-plant performance variability and agronomical mismanagement will induce degradation processes resulting in increased spatial variability of crop performance. Comparison of the patterns of NDVI and soil moisture, made clear that soil moisture and water availability are limiting factors for our target zone, and any management practice that results in an increased time and spatial availability of this critical resource will increase production sustainability. Toward a more profitable agricultural system? Zero tillage and permanent raised bed planting with at least partial residue retention generate higher yields, lower costs, and higher incomes than the incumbent traditional agriculture management system, based on extensive tillage and residue removal. The zero tillage system with at least partial residue retention also demonstrates less income variability over years, decreasing risk. Moreover, the traditional farmer practices result in negative returns after variable costs. It is clear that an environmental friendly and profitable agriculture for the (sub) tropical highlands should be based on conservation agriculture practices. In the (sub) tropical highlands, a cropping system that includes zero tillage/permanent raised bed planting, crop rotation, and crop residue retention can have positive effects compared with commonly used farming practices of heavy tillage before seeding, monocropping and crop residue removal. Zero tillage with residue retention can clearly be a part of an integrated management scheme towards sustainable agriculture. It is clear that to develop new management practices to improve water use, reduce erosion and enhance human labour/(animal) power, the focus must be on the use of conservation agriculture both for rain fed as well as irrigated production systems which will need to be fine tuned for each system. Our results provide a sound basis to support the development of zero-till seeding equipment in order to extend the technology to the small-scale farmers of the target area.

Although the earliest emergence time (17 day) and the highest emergence degree (66. 5 %) were obtained, yield was the lowest in no-tillage system. The <b>highest</b> <b>penetration</b> <b>resistance</b> (53. 71 kg cm - 2) was measured in no-tillage system.

This {{study was conducted}} to determine the influence of nine long-term cropping systems on Andean hillside soil; specifically the degradation of soil structure. During the course of studying each soil treatment, resulting changes in soil properties and their effects on water infiltration and crop yield were recorded. The effects of soil crusting and sealing were investigated during the period Jan 2000 - Dec 2001 in southwest Colombia. Physical parameters such as <b>penetration</b> <b>resistance,</b> shear strength, and infiltration capacity, as well as chemical parameters such as nutrient content, soil reaction, organic matter content and electrical conductivity were analyzed. Two types of soil crusting were observed during the project. One occurred due to splash impact of raindrops on barely covered soil surfaces. The second occurred due to excessive application of chicken manure. A seasonal increase in <b>penetration</b> <b>resistance</b> and shear strength in some treatments did not necessarily lead to restrictions in water infiltration. A nutrient-rich minimum tillage treatment, which displayed the <b>highest</b> <b>penetration</b> <b>resistance</b> of up to 46. 4 kg cm- 2 during the dry periods, presented no restricting effects on soil water intake (76. 2 mm h- 1 final infiltration in 2000) due to an optimal aggregate development during 14 years of cultivation.

40|$|Alternative {{technologies}} to increase grain maize production under rainfed systems are urgently needed, considering the low grain yield in small-scale farming {{in countries such}} as Mozambique. Supplemental irrigation, fertiliser application and tillage methods are valuable available farming technologies. This thesis examined the impact of supplemental irrigation, fertiliser application and three tillage methods (hand hoeing, strip tillage, disc tillage) on maize grain yield. Studies on belowground biomass showed that most roots were concentrated in the upper 20 cm of the soil. Root abundance decreased down the soil profile, which can be genetically derived but also attributable to <b>higher</b> <b>penetration</b> <b>resistance</b> at greater depth. Tillage had a great effect on soil <b>penetration</b> <b>resistance,</b> but little effect on root growth and a limited effect on yield. Root to shoot ratio was high under rainfed conditions, due to low allocation of assimilates to aboveground traits under water stress. Degrees above canopy threshold (DACT, a water stress index) varied from 0 °C (no stress) to 17. 1 °C (high stress). It was mainly affected by water supply and was negatively correlated with soil moisture, grain yield, thousand-grain weight and water use efficiency. Water use efficiency ranged from 0. 16 - 0. 60 kg m- 3 (rainfed) to 0. 45 - 1. 09 kg m- 3 (irrigated) and was negatively correlated with DACT in both seasons studied.

40|$|The {{interpretation}} of {{cone penetration test}} (CPT) data {{is important for the}} in-situ characterisation of soils. Interpretation of CPT data remains a predominately empirical process {{due to the lack of}} a rigorous model that can relate soil properties to penetrometer readings. Interpretation is especially difficult in layered soils, where penetrometer response can be affected by several horizons of soil with different properties. This paper aims to provide some insight into the mechanisms of soil displacement that occur as a penetrometer is pushed into layered soils. Data is presented from centrifuge modelling of probe penetration in layered soils in an axisymmetric container where soil deformation patterns around the probe can be measured. Results obtained from uniform soil tests are also presented to illustrate the effects of soil density and stress level (i. e. centrifuge acceleration). A large influence zone is found to relate to the <b>higher</b> <b>penetration</b> <b>resistance</b> obtained in a denser soil. Differing soil displacement patterns at low and high stresses are related to the tendency of the soil to dilate, with the well-known consequence of a non-linear increase of <b>penetration</b> <b>resistance</b> with stress level. Layered soil tests show a clear difference of soil deformation patterns compared to uniform tests, especially for vertical displacements. The peak value of vertical displacement of the soil occurs at dense-over-loose interfaces, while a local minimum occurs at loose-over-dense interfaces. Parameters are proposed to quantitatively evaluate the layered effects on soil deformations and a deformation mechanism is described for penetration in layered soils based on the transition of displacement profiles...|$|R

40|$|Reduced tillage is {{interesting}} in many points of views and improved soil structure {{is a factor}} of great importance. In reduced tillage the labour intensive mouldboard plough is often replaced by disc or spring-tine cultivators. Tillage systems affect several soil properties, both biological and physical. Reduced tillage is often shown to improve soil structure and the method has in Sweden been best suited on strongly structured heavy clays. Weakly structured soils needs more loosening and reduced tillage has not been that successful on these types of soils. It can take several years with reduced tillage before the positive effects becomes beneficial. Measurements on soil properties affecting crop growth has been studied in field trials in south of Sweden on two farms. The randomized block designed trials consist of four tillage systems and they are listed as: (A 1) reduced tillage (15 cm), (A 2) reduced tillage (5 - 7 cm), (B) conventional ploughing (20 - 22 cm) and (C) shallow ploughing (12 - 15 cm). Measurements of dry bulk density, infiltration, <b>penetration</b> <b>resistance</b> and root development were performed under {{spring and early summer}} 2008. Furthermore preferential flow was studied with the dye tracer Brilliant Blue FCF using high resolution images. The measurements showed that the difference between the different tillage methods generally was small. The differences between ploughed and non-ploughed plots were more pronounced than between tillage depths. Dry bulk density in the topsoil does not always increase when conventional plough is replaced by reduced tillage systems. Increased tillage depth did not affect the <b>penetration</b> <b>resistance</b> in the non-ploughed plots. The ploughed plots generally had lower <b>penetration</b> <b>resistance</b> than the non ploughed plots and the shallow ploughed plot resulted in <b>higher</b> <b>penetration</b> <b>resistance</b> compared to the deep ploughed plots.

At the depth of the plough pan the infiltration was higher in non-ploughed plots at Väby but no differences were found at Charlottenlund.

40|$|In the Netherlands infrastructural works, such as {{bridges and}} overpasses, are {{generally}} constructed using {{blast furnace slag}} cement (BFSC) concretes, because of the relative <b>high</b> <b>resistance</b> against chloride <b>penetration</b> from de-icing salts. However, sheltered elements constructed in BFSC concrete are prone to carbonation, for example abutments and support beams. From the field investigation at the Hattemerbroek overpass, concrete damages were found at the abutments and attributed to chloride induced corrosion enhanced by carbonation. This research focuses {{on the influence of}} carbonation on the chloride <b>penetration</b> <b>resistance</b> of BFSC mortars and the effect of slag content. For the influence of carbonation on chloride <b>penetration</b> <b>resistance</b> it is assumed that there is a sheltered carbonation period before exposure to chlorides, like an abutment exposed to chlorides after a joint starts to leak. This research was needed since there are up to 2000 concrete structures like Hattemerbroek, executed in BFSC and prone to carbonation enhanced chloride induced corrosion. In order to identify the influence of different slag contents (0 - 70 %) on carbonation, chloride penetration and their coupled effect, twelve slag cement blends were tested. Chloride <b>penetration</b> <b>resistance</b> was expressed by means of electrical resistivity and chloride diffusion coefficient determined from the RCM-test in accordance with NT Built 492.
