5|$|At the time, Diệm <b>had</b> <b>little</b> {{authority}} {{beyond the}} gates of his own palace. Bảo Đại <b>had</b> <b>little</b> confidence in him and gave him meagre support—the pair had clashed in the past, with Diem resigning as Bảo Đại's Interior Minister two decades earlier, believing {{the head of state}} to be weak and ineffective. Many historians believe that Bảo Đại may have selected Diệm for the latter's ability to attract U.S. support and funding. During the transition period, the French Expeditionary Corps maintained a presence in South Vietnam. This led to tension between France and the State of Vietnam. Diệm, a passionate nationalist, detested the French, who reciprocated, hoping he would fail, even calling for his removal on occasions.|$|E

2500|$|But as {{multiple}} US {{agencies have}} moved into embassies over the years, the COM's authority has actually declined. Not many Army officers realize that COMs <b>have</b> <b>little</b> or no staff in the military sense; often they <b>have</b> <b>little</b> oversight of funds moving through other agencies in the embassy, and they <b>have</b> <b>little</b> or no planning capability, which sometimes leads to culture clashes with US military forces in country. More worrisome, under current rules COMs often <b>have</b> <b>little</b> to say about military operations in their countries, overpowered as they are by regional combatant command planning staffs and military teams that move in and out. Under President John F. Kennedy, COMs had explicit authority over Military Assistance Advisory Groups (MAAG), which {{were part of the}} ambassador's [...] "country team."
