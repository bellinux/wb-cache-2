In {{order to}} study the {{expansion}} properties of slates, this paper tests multiple groups of data, including free <b>expansion</b> <b>ratio,</b> <b>expansion</b> force and expansion strain for the different stratification slates in Chongqing. We found that {{with the increase of}} time, the axial <b>expansion</b> <b>ratio</b> and swelling pressure of different stratification slates begin to increase rapidly in the initial period,until gradually moving to a maximum value. In addition, slates stratification in different directions has different expansion properties, the perpendicular to stratification direction has greater <b>expansion</b> <b>ratio,</b> is about 2. 5 times more than the <b>expansion</b> <b>ratio</b> of parallel to the bedding.

40|$|A {{methodology}} {{is presented}} {{for improving the}} amount of compression achieved by continuous-flow decompressors by using multiple ratios of scan chains to tester channels (i. e., <b>expansion</b> <b>ratios).</b> The idea is {{to start with a}} higher <b>expansion</b> <b>ratio</b> than normal and then progressively reduce the <b>expansion</b> <b>ratio</b> to detect any faults that remain undetected. By detecting faults at the highest <b>expansion</b> <b>ratio</b> possible, the amount of compression can be significantly improved compared with conventional approaches. The <b>expansion</b> <b>ratio</b> is progressively reduced by concatenating scan chains together using MUXes to make fewer and longer scan chains. Selecting which scan chains to concatenate is done by using a dependency analysis procedure that takes into account structural dependencies among the scan chains as well as free-variable dependencies in the logic driving the scan chains to improve the probability of detecting faults. Results for applying the proposed approach to industrial designs using various types of decompressors indicate significant improvements in compression are possible. 1...|$|R

In this study, the capability of a two-dimensional shallow-water numerical model to simulate the symmetric and asymmetric flows that can take place in rectangular shallow reservoirs varying the lateral <b>expansion</b> <b>ratio</b> and the dimensionless length is investigated. For a large lateral <b>expansion</b> <b>ratio,</b> the use of two protocols of simulation highlighted a high sensitivity of the simulated flow pattern to the initial condition. Comparison between simulated results and experimental data showed a good agreement for the critical shape parameter (combination of the lateral <b>expansion</b> <b>ratio</b> and the dimensionless length) between symmetric and asymmetric flows.
