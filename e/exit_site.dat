25|$|The {{ribosome}} {{has three}} sites for tRNA to bind. They are the aminoacyl site (abbreviated A), the peptidyl site (abbreviated P) and the <b>exit</b> <b>site</b> (abbreviated E). With {{respect to the}} mRNA, the three sites are oriented 5’ to 3’ E-P-A, because ribosomes move toward the 3' end of mRNA. The A site binds the incoming tRNA with the complementary codon on the mRNA. The P site holds the tRNA with the growing polypeptide chain. The E site holds the tRNA without its amino acid. When an aminoacyl-tRNA initially binds to its corresponding codon on the mRNA, {{it is in the}} A site. Then, a peptide bond forms between the amino acid of the tRNA in the A site and the amino acid of the charged tRNA in the P site. The growing polypeptide chain is transferred to the tRNA in the A site. Translocation occurs, moving the tRNA in the P site, now without an amino acid, to the E site; the tRNA that was in the A site, now charged with the polypeptide chain, is moved to the P site. The tRNA in the E site leaves and another aminoacyl-tRNA enters the A site to repeat the process.|$|E

Here, we provide evidence that apoptosis-linked gene 2 (ALG- 2), a Ca 2 +-binding protein of unknown function, regulates the COPII function at ER <b>exit</b> <b>sites</b> in mammalian cells. ALG- 2 bound to the Pro-rich region of Sec 31 A, a ubiquitously expressed mammalian orthologue of yeast Sec 31, in a Ca 2 +-dependent manner and colocalized with Sec 31 A at ER <b>exit</b> <b>sites.</b> A Ca 2 + binding-deficient ALG- 2 mutant, which did not bind Sec 31 A, lost the ability to localize to ER <b>exit</b> <b>sites.</b> Overexpression of the Pro-rich region of Sec 31 A or RNA interference-mediated Sec 31 A depletion also abolished the ALG- 2 localization at these sites. In contrast, depletion of ALG- 2 substantially reduced the level of Sec 31 A associated with the membrane at ER <b>exit</b> <b>sites.</b> Finally, treatment with a cell-permeable Ca 2 + chelator caused the mislocalization of ALG- 2, which was accompanied by a reduced level of Sec 31 A at ER <b>exit</b> <b>sites.</b> We conclude that ALG- 2 is recruited to ER <b>exit</b> <b>sites</b> via Ca 2 +-dependent interaction with Sec 31 A and in turn stabilizes the localization of Sec 31 A at these sites...|$|R

40|$|<b>Exit</b> <b>sites</b> {{associated}} with scar-related reentrant arrhythmias represent important targets for catheter ablation therapy. However, their accurate location {{in a safe}} and robust manner remains a significant clinical challenge. We recently proposed a novel quantitative metric (termed the Reentry Vulnerability Index, RVI) to determine the difference between activation and repolarisation intervals measured from pairs of spatial locations during premature stimulation to accurately locate the critical site of reentry formation. In the clinic, the method showed potential to identify regions of low RVI corresponding to areas vulnerable to reentry, subsequently identified as ventricular tachycardia (VT) circuit <b>exit</b> <b>sites.</b> Here, we perform an in silico investigation of the RVI metric in order to aid the acquisition and interpretation of RVI maps and optimise its future usage within the clinic. Within idealised 2 D sheet models we show that the RVI produces lower values under correspondingly more arrhythmogenic conditions, with even low resolution (8 mm electrode separation) recordings still able to locate vulnerable regions. When applied to models of infarct scars, the surface RVI maps successfully identified <b>exit</b> <b>sites</b> of the reentrant circuit, even in scenarios where the scar was wholly intramural. Within highly complex infarct scar anatomies with multiple reentrant pathways, the identified <b>exit</b> <b>sites</b> were dependent upon the specific pacing location used to compute the endocardial RVI maps. However, simulated ablation of these sites successfully prevented the reentry re-initiation. We conclude that endocardial surface RVI maps are able to successfully locate regions vulnerable to reentry corresponding to critical <b>exit</b> <b>sites</b> during sustained scar-related VT. The method is robust against highly complex and intramural scar anatomies and low resolution clinical data acquisition. Optimal location of all relevant sites requires RVI maps to be computed from multiple pacing location...|$|R
2500|$|Once {{proteins}} have {{folded and}} {{are ready to}} be transported out of the ER {{it is thought that}} they assemble at specific site within the ER called [...] "ER exit sites". These sites can be transient but are most likely situated in the ER where the ER is close to the next transport compartment, the vesicular-tubular cluster (VTC) (also referred to as the ER-Golgi Intermediate Compartment (ERGIC)). The details of how proteins are concentrated or localized to the <b>exit</b> <b>site</b> is unclear (some aspects are emerging!) but the actual process of budding a vesicle containing these proteins start with a protein called Sec12. This protein recruits a small GTPase called Sar1 (think of Sar1 as a switch, it is active when bound to GTP and inactive when it hydrolyses the GTP to GDP). This in turn leads to the recruitment of a protein complex, the Sec23/Sec24 and the Sec13/Sec31 complex (also known as the COPII coat). In a nutshell what these proteins do is form a mesh at the ER <b>exit</b> <b>site</b> and the mesh through mechanical curvature forms a little [...] "blob" [...] that pinches off from the ER with proteins inside (think, playdough as the ER and your hand as the Sec complex pinching off little bits). The mesh disassembles off the budded vesicle when Sar1 hydrolyses the GTP to GDP. Interestingly, this activity of Sar1 is enhanced by Sec23/24.|$|E

[...] After binding of a charged tRNA to the A-site, a peptide bond is formed between the growing polypeptide chain on the P-site tRNA and the amino acid of the A-site tRNA, and the entire polypeptide is transferred from the P-site tRNA to the A-site tRNA. [...] Then, in a process catalyzed by the prokaryotic elongation factor EF-G (historically known as translocase), the coordinated translocation of the tRNAs and mRNA occurs, with the P-site tRNA moving to the E-site, where it dissociates from the ribosome, and the A-site tRNA moves {{to take its place}} in the P-site.|$|E

5000|$|A Hickman line is {{a central}} venous {{catheter}} most often used for the administration of chemotherapy or other medications, {{as well as for}} the withdrawal of blood for analysis. Some types are used mainly for the purpose of apheresis or dialysis. Hickman lines may remain in place for extended periods and are used when long-term intravenous access is required. They are inserted under sedation or a general anesthetic by a radiologist or surgeon. The insertion involves two incisions, one at the jugular vein or another nearby vein or groove, and one on the chest wall. At the former incision site (known as the [...] "entrance" [...] site), a tunnel is created from there through to the latter incision site (known as the [...] "exit" [...] site), and the catheter is pushed through this tunnel until it [...] "exits" [...] the latter incision site. The <b>exit</b> <b>site</b> is where the lumens are seen as coming out of the chest wall. The catheter at the entrance site area is then inserted back through the entrance site and advanced into the superior vena cava, preferably near the junction of it and the right atrium of the heart.

Methods and Results-In 16 isolated, blood-perfused canine hearts, multiterminal electrodes were used to map electrical activity in Koch's triangle after ventricular stimulation and during ventricular echoes. The subendocardial cell layers were chemically destroyed in 3 hearts. Incisions in the posterior approach to the compact node were made in 6 hearts. The apex of the triangle of Koch was surgically dissociated from the perinodal atrial tissue in 5 hearts. Retrograde atrial activation occurred via 2 distinct endocardial <b>exit</b> <b>sites.</b> Ventricular echoes could be induced in all hearts irrespective of the atrial activation pattern. Simultaneous retrograde activation of both <b>exit</b> <b>sites</b> often preceded reciprocation.
