5|$|After {{they started}} to break apart, further orders were placed for {{additional}} suits and all the suits used eventually fell apart during the four days they were used on set. In order to film one scene, McChesney wore the suit open-backed due to the damage. No optical effects were used in creating Armus. For the scene where Riker is pulled into the oil, a stuntman {{was used as a}} stand in for Jonathan Frakes. Where Riker's face emerges from the oil, <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>actually</b> <b>a</b> plaster cast of Frakes' face painted black. It was placed on the same grate used to lift McChesney, and filmed lifting out of the liquid. The twitching effect in Yar's death was due to a wire tied around Crosby's waist being pulled on.|$|E
5|$|The Mint {{struck at}} least several hundred {{patterns}} using Longacre's flying eagle design in the proposed composition. In an effort to secure public acceptance of the new pieces, these were distributed to various congressmen and other officials, initially in November 1856. Two hundred {{were sent to the}} House Committee on Coinage, Weights and Measures, while four were given to President Franklin Pierce. At least 634 specimens were distributed, and possibly several thousand; extra were available on request. This was the origin of the highly collectable 1856 Flying Eagle cent, which is considered by numismatists as part of the Flying Eagle series although <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>actually</b> <b>a</b> pattern or transition piece, not an official coin, as congressional approval had not yet been granted. Additional 1856 small cents were later struck by Snowden for illicit sale, and to exchange for pieces the Mint sought for its coin collection.|$|E

5|$|On the July 25 {{episode of}} Raw, Mysterio won the tournament {{to become the}} new WWE Champion, and {{immediately}} had to fend off Alberto Del Rio {{to prevent him from}} cashing in his Money in the Bank. TripleH, now Chief Operating Officer, decreed that Mysterio was to face ex-champion Cena later that night for the title; Cena won and again became WWE Champion. After the match, Punk made an unannounced return to WWE with the old WWE Championship belt to confront Cena. Cena and Punk later fought in a match at SummerSlam on August 14 to crown the undisputed WWE Champion, which Punk won controversially as Triple H didn't see Cena's leg was on the rope and <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>actually</b> <b>a</b> rope break. As Punk celebrated, Kevin Nash made his WWE return and assaulted him. Del Rio then cashed in his Money in the Bank contract and pinned Punk to become the new champion after kicking Punk in the head. Punk regained the WWE Championship from Del Rio at Survivor Series in November 2011; starting a 434-day reign until The Rock beat him at the 2013 Royal Rumble event.|$|E

25|$|While {{centered}} on the Plain of Jars, FAN raised a Special Guerrilla Battalion that occupied Vang Khy, a village located between Vientiane and Vang Viang. While the reputed purpose of the new battalion was security for Neutralist officials in the capital, the Royalist General Staff suspected <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>actually</b> <b>a</b> potential coup force. In December 1963, its commanding officer was murdered in Vientiane. A Royalist assassination was presumed.|$|E

25|$|A {{few years}} later, another Maya codex was found possessed by another collector, which {{became known as}} the Codex Cortesianus (in the belief that {{it had been in the}} {{possession}} of Hernán Cortés).

25|$|After Shemp {{rejoined the}} act, Moe, Shemp, and Larry shot a {{television}} pilot for ABC called Jerks of All Trades (1949), apparently intended {{to lead to}} a weekly sitcom series on the premise that the Stooges would try a different job or business every week, hoping that eventually one of their attempts would be successful. Anything they tried {{turned out to be a}} fiasco, which was the source of the comedy.

25|$|Gardiner {{maintains}} that on 14 April, First Officer Murdoch (who was not officially on duty yet) {{was on the}} bridge because {{he was one of}} the few high-ranking officers other than Captain Smith who knew of the plan and was keeping a watch out for the rescue ships. One of Gardiner's most controversial statements is that the Titanic did not strike an iceberg, but an IMM rescue ship that was drifting on station with its lights out. Gardiner based this hypothesis on the idea that the supposed iceberg was seen at such a short distance by the lookouts on the Titanic because <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>actually</b> <b>a</b> darkened ship, and he also does not believe an iceberg could inflict such sustained and serious damage to a steel double-hulled vessel such as the Titanic.|$|E
25|$|Meanwhile, Air New Zealand's {{financial}} position was deteriorating, and Ansett was losing market share to both Qantas {{and a new}} entrant on the Australian domestic market, Virgin Blue. The Air New Zealand board decided that the answer was to spend still more money, and buy Virgin Blue as well as Ansett. On condition that that deal went through, SIA was prepared to fund the purchase of 32 new aircraft for the Air New Zealand group. Virgin Blue, however, was growing fast, largely {{at the expense of}} Ansett; the initial A$120 million offer was deemed insufficient and in August Virgin Blue owner Sir Richard Branson, with his customary gift for publicity, put an end to negotiations when he tore up on television what he claimed was a A$250 million Air New Zealand cheque. Although the offer may have been genuine the cheque was not - <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>actually</b> <b>a</b> cheque from a book of one of the airport managers drawn on a Qantas' staff credit union account.|$|E

[...] Eight days later, Molina was behind the plate to call rookie Michael Wacha's one-hit, 8 [...] innings of shutout work in a 2–0 victory over the Washington Nationals.

500|$|Though the {{resulting}} Constitution {{has sometimes been}} depicted as a pre-digested French project, <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>actually</b> <b>a</b> result of the constitutional commission's discussions between October 1797 and January 1798.

In any case, the [...] "suggestions" [...] of Delacroix were politely rejected and the constitutional commission insisted on the following three essential points: universal manhood suffrage, without fiscal qualifications; the right of revision of the constitution at quinquennial intervals by the voters; and finally the rejection of the principle of a bicameral legislature, in which each House would have a separate electoral base.|$|E
