5|$|Emotions are {{generally}} defined as two-step multicomponent processes involving <b>elicitation,</b> followed by psychological feelings, appraisal, expression, autonomic responses, and action tendencies. Attempts to localize basic emotions to certain brain regions have been controversial, with some research finding {{no evidence for}} specific locations corresponding to emotions, and instead circuitry involved in general emotional processes. The amygdala, orbitofrontal cortex, mid and anterior insula cortex and lateral prefrontal cortex, appeared {{to be involved in}} generating the emotions, while weaker evidence was found for the ventral tegmental area, ventral pallidum and nucleus accumbens in incentive salience. Others, however, have found evidence of activation of specific regions, such as the basal ganglia in happiness, the subcallosal cingulate cortex in sadness, and amygdala in fear.|$|E
5|$|The Fujita {{scale and}} the Enhanced Fujita Scale rate tornadoes by damage caused. The Enhanced Fujita (EF) Scale was an update to the older Fujita scale, by expert <b>elicitation,</b> using {{engineered}} wind estimates and better damage descriptions. The EF Scale was designed so that a tornado rated on the Fujita scale would receive the same numerical rating, and was implemented starting in the United States in 2007. An EF0 tornado will probably damage trees but not substantial structures, whereas an EF5 tornado can rip buildings off their foundations leaving them bare and even deform large skyscrapers. The similar TORRO scale ranges from a T0 for extremely weak tornadoes to T11 for the most powerful known tornadoes. Doppler weather radar data, photogrammetry, and ground swirl patterns (cycloidal marks) may also be analyzed to determine intensity and award a rating.|$|E

40|$|This {{research}} studies {{the use of}} the <b>elicitations</b> in the film entitled The Day After Tomorrow. It is conducted to find out the types of the <b>elicitations</b> employed by the main characters, the way the main characters deliver the <b>elicitations</b> with respect to the participants' statuses and roles, and the reasons why the main characters employ certain <b>elicitations</b> in the film. This research deals with socio-pragmatics approach. It is a descriptive qualitative study, and it employs a purposive sampling as the sampling technique. The data are all the dialogs containing the <b>elicitations,</b> verbal and non-verbal response in the film, which have significant relationship with the problem statements. There are 61 data found in the film. The 61 data having the same characteristics are then reduced by using criterion-based selection. The data are then identified by using Tsui�s theory on <b>elicitations</b> to identify what types of the <b>elicitations</b> are employed by the main characters. The researcher uses SPEAKING formula, Brown and Levinson�s theory of politeness and the theory of intonation to reveal how the main characters employ the <b>elicitations.</b> The researcher also uses Holmes� social dimensions and Fishman�s domain of language use to find out the reasons why the main characters employ the <b>elicitations</b> in the film. The <b>elicitations</b> are an adjacency pair event; therefore, Tsui�s classification of the elicitations� responses is used to analyze the <b>elicitations</b> responses. The result of this research shows that there are five types of the <b>elicitations</b> employed by the main characters. They are elicit: inform (30 data), elicit: confirm (14 data), elicit: agree (7 data), elicit: repeat (1 datum), elicit: clarify (9 data). It is also found that each type of the <b>elicitations</b> is delivered by the main characters in various ways. It is closely related to the intonation and the key �the facial expression and the body language� presented by the participants when they have a conversation. It is found that the responses prospected given by the addressees and the receiver are also various. The responses found in the film are positive verbal response, positive non-verbal response, negative verbal response, and temporization verbal response. The researcher also finds that the appearances of certain types of the <b>elicitations</b> are influenced by some factors. They are the context of situations, the ends of the conversation, the social statuses and roles of the participants, the social dimensions and the domains of language use. The result of this research is expected to give input dealing with {{the use of the}} <b>elicitations</b> and their responses prospected related to the social factors for the students, lecturers, and other researchers. The researcher suggests other researchers who are interested in socio-pragmatics study to conduct a further research on the <b>elicitations</b> and their responses. They may relate it with other social factors such as gender and age. They can also try to conduct a field study to study the use of the <b>elicitations</b> and their responses related with certain social factors in a real life. �...|$|R

40|$|Expert <b>elicitations</b> are {{frequently}} used to characterize future technology outcomes. However their usefulness is limited, in part because: estimates across studies {{are not easily}} comparable; choices in survey design and expert selection may bias results; and over-confidence is a persistent problem. We provide quantitative evidence of how these choices affect experts 2 ̆ 019 estimates {{of the costs of}} future energy technologies. We harmonize data from 19 <b>elicitations,</b> involving 215 experts, on the 2030 costs of 5 energy technologies: nuclear, biofuels, bioelectricity, solar, and carbon capture. We control for expert characteristics, survey design, and public R&D investment levels on which the elicited values are conditional. We find that, on average, when experts respond to <b>elicitations</b> in person, they ascribe lower confidence (larger uncertainty) to their estimates than when responding via mail or online. In-person interviews also produce more optimistic assessments of best-case (10 th percentile) outcomes. The impacts of expert affiliation 2 ̆ 014 government, private sector, or academic 2 ̆ 014 and geography 2 ̆ 014 US or EU 2 ̆ 014 are also significant; academics and US experts have lower confidence than other types of experts. Higher R&D investment levels have no effect on the confidence of experts 2 ̆ 019 judgments. R&D reduces both the median and breakthrough (10 th percentile) cost estimates, although the size of the effect varies across technologies. These results indicate the source, direction, and size of bias in energy technology <b>elicitations.</b> They also point to the technology specificity of some of the effects. These biases should be seriously considered, both in interpreting the results of existing <b>elicitations</b> and in designing new ones...|$|R

25|$|Surface {{landmarks}} {{can be used}} {{to identify}} the appropriate location for injection of local anesthetic, which is typically lateral to (outside) the lateral border of the sternocleidomastoid muscle and above the clavicle, with the first rib generally considered to represent the limit below which the needle must not be directed (the pleural cavity and uppermost part of the lung are located at this level). Palpation or ultrasound visualization of the subclavian artery just above the clavicle provides a useful anatomic landmark for locating the brachial plexus, which is lateral to the artery at this level. Proximity to the brachial plexus can be determined using by <b>elicitation</b> of a paresthesia, use of a peripheral nerve stimulator, or ultrasound guidance.|$|E

2500|$|Brachial plexus {{block is}} {{typically}} performed by an anesthesiologist. To achieve an optimal block, {{the tip of}} the needle should be close to the nerves of the plexus during the injection of local anesthetic solution. Commonly employed techniques for obtaining such a needle position include transarterial, <b>elicitation</b> of a paresthesia, and use of a peripheral nerve stimulator or a portable ultrasound scanning device. If the needle is close to or contacts a nerve, the subject may experience a paresthesia (a sudden tingling sensation, often described as feeling like [...] "pins and needles" [...] or like an electric shock) in the arm, hand, or fingers. Injection close to the point of <b>elicitation</b> of such a paresthesia may result in a good block. A peripheral nerve stimulator connected to an appropriate needle allows emission of electric current from the needle tip. When the needle tip is close to or contacts a motor nerve, characteristic contraction of the innervated muscle may be elicited. Modern portable ultrasound devices allow the user to visualize internal anatomy, including the nerves to be blocked, neighboring anatomic structures and the needle as it approaches the nerves. Observation of local anesthetic surrounding the nerves during ultrasound-guided injection is predictive of a successful block. Appropriate block per site-specific procedure are listed in the following table: ...|$|E
