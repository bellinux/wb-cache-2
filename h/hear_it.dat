5|$|In 2011, Nestlé Purina Petcare {{became the}} {{official}} {{sponsor of the}} Westminster show hosted by the American Kennel Club. The company introduced a competition for pet owners to win a part-time job earning $50,000 annually to travel with their cat, interview other pet owners and write for the Purina website. Nestle Purina also produced television advertisements intended for Austria that had audio effects only pets could <b>hear.</b> <b>It</b> was {{the first set of}} advertisements targeting pets directly, rather than their owners.|$|E
5|$|It is a {{collaboration}} {{with one of}} my friends from the international music industry, Eric Turner, a very talented guy from Sweden, and with the boys from Play & Win. It is very particular. I consider that I went through all stages, from popcorn to dance, club and pop music, so I considered that I have reached a maturity which allows me to release a song which I like, which makes me move in a club and makes me want to <b>hear</b> <b>it</b> on the radio, and I'm very fulfilled.|$|E
5|$|On March 16, 1824 Mr. Lowndes, the BFBS's {{secretary}} in Corfu, {{sent a letter}} to the society in which he mentioned that the sum paid to Meksi for his work was 6,000 piastras and that Archimandrite Grigor was paid 60 crowns. On September 5, 1824 the Saint Matthew's Gospel was published in Albanian. According to Lowndes' letters, the Albanian community of Missolonghi was extremely excited when mass was said with a piece from Saint Matthew, as since its translation they had been impatient to <b>hear</b> <b>it</b> in Albanian. In July 1827 the form in which the first 500copies of the New Testament were to be bound was decided in London. The entire edition amounted to 2,000copies.|$|E

5|$|Carnaby's black {{cockatoo}} communicates by auditory {{and visual}} displays. The voice is generally noisy with several calls; loudest and most frequent is a wailing wy-lah, which is uttered by both sexes and often heard before the birds themselves are seen. There is usually an interval of 0.4 {{seconds before the}} call is repeated. This call is made by birds in flight, before taking off and returning to the nest. Carnaby's black cockatoos {{that are not in}} flight may answer with this call when they <b>hear</b> <b>it.</b> The call is often shortened or chopped off three-quarters of the way through as the bird takes off. The call varies between individual Carnaby's black cockatoos, and older nestlings can distinguish their parents' calls. Saunders labelled a variant of the wy-lah as the interrogative call—it is drawn out and ends with an inflection. Birds often utter a soft chuck call when alone. Females make a whistling call composed of two notes of varying volume when perched or about to take off. They also utter a softer version that is 0.6 seconds long, as well as a long single-noted whistle when alone. The male makes a soft shot wy-lah call in similar situations. Birds may also make a harsh screeching alarm call when they notice something is out of place. They squawk loudly in disputes with their own kind, when other animals enter breeding territory, or when they are handled by people in captivity. Males can utter a harsh chattering squeak when arguing with other males.|$|E

25|$|Example (10) is not {{grammatical}} {{because the}} same preposition (in) is both maintained in its original position and stranded.
