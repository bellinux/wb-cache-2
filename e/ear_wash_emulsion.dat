40|$|Whey {{protein isolate}} (WPI), soy protein isolate (SPI), and sodium {{caseinate}} (CAS) can inhibit lipid oxidation when they produce a positive charge at the interface of emulsion droplets. However, when proteins {{are used to}} stabilize oil-in-water emulsions, {{only a fraction of}} them actually absorb to the emulsion droplets, with the rest remaining in the continuous phase. The impact of these continuous phase proteins on the oxidative stability of protein-stabilized emulsions is not well understood. WPI-stabilized menhaden oil-in-water emulsions were prepared by high-pressure homogenization. In some experiments WPI was removed from the continuous phase of the emulsions through repeated centrifugation and resuspension of the <b>emulsion</b> droplets (<b>washed</b> <b>emulsion).</b> Unwashed emulsions were more oxidatively stable than <b>washed</b> <b>emulsions</b> at pH 7. 0, suggesting that continuous phase proteins were antioxidative. The oxidative stability of emulsions containing different kinds of protein in the continuous phase decreased in the order SPI 3 ̆e CAS 3 ̆e WPI, as determined by both hydroperoxide and headspace propanal formation. Iron-binding studies showed that the chelating ability of the proteins decreased in the order CAS 3 ̆e SPI 3 ̆e WPI. The free sulfhydryls of both WPI and SPI were involved in their antioxidant activity. This research shows that continuous phase proteins could be an effective means of protecting ω− 3 fatty acids from oxidative deterioration...|$|R

40|$|To {{evaluate}} {{the presence of}} viruses and bacteria in middle ear and adenoids of patients with and without otitis media with effusion (OME). Adenoid samples and middle <b>ear</b> <b>washes</b> (MEW) were obtained from children with OME associated with adenoid hypertrophy undergoing adenoidectomy and tympanostomy, and compared to those obtained from patients undergoing cochlear implant surgery, as a control group. Specific DNA or RNA of 9 respiratory viruses (rhinovirus, influenza virus, picornavirus, syncytial respiratory virus, metapneumovirus, coronavirus, enterovirus, adenovirus and bocavirus) and 5 bacteria (S. pneumoniae, H. influenzae, M. catarrhalis, P. aeruginosa and S. aureus) were extracted and quantified by real-time PCR. 37 OME and 14 cochlear implant children {{were included in the}} study. At the adenoid, virus and bacteria were similarly detected in both OME and control patients. At the middle <b>ear</b> <b>washes,</b> however, a higher prevalence of bacteria was observed in patients with OME (p = 0. 01). S. pneumoniae (p = 0. 01) and M. catarrhalis (p = 0. 022) were the bacteria responsible for this difference. Although total virus detection was not statistically different from controls at the middle <b>ear</b> <b>washes</b> (p = 0. 065), adenovirus was detected in higher proportions in adenoid samples of OME patients than controls (p = 0. 019). Despite both OME and control patients presented similar rates of viruses and bacteria at the adenoid, children with OME presented higher prevalence of S. pneumonia, M. catarrhalis in middle ear and adenovirus in adenoids when compared to controls. These findings could suggest that these pathogens could contribute to the fluid persistence in the middle ear...|$|R
40|$|A {{cuprous oxide}} {{emulsion}} was made using noodling and <b>washing</b> <b>emulsion</b> making techniques. An {{attempt to use}} phthalated gelatin and coagulation washing resulted {{in the formation of}} cuprous hydroxide and destruction of the phthalated gel molecule and lack of coagulation within the emulsion. Cuprous oxide was also slurried with water and coated onto unglazed porcelain plates. The density-log exposure relationship was linear for the cuprous oxide slurry and non-linear for the cuprous oxide emulsion. The cuprous oxide film gave a speed value twenty-five times greater than that obtained with the slurry. The cuprous oxide dismutation system possesses great variability and little repeatability...|$|R

40|$|Nontypeable Haemophilus influenzae (NTHI) {{is a major}} {{pathogen}} of otitis media. One of {{the outer}} membrane proteins of NTHI, P 6, is an antigen common to all strains and is considered {{as a candidate for}} mucosal vaccine. To elucidate the possibility of developing a nasal vaccine against nontypeable Haemophilus influenzae (NTHI) and to investigate mucosal immune responses in the middle ear, mice were immunized intranasally with the P 6 outer membrane protein of NTHI, and P 6 -specific immune responses in the middle ear mucosa were examined. Mice were given with P 6 and cholera toxin intranasally as an adjuvant on days 0, 7, and 14 and were killed on day 21. The P 6 -specific immunoglobulin A (IgA) antibody titer in <b>ear</b> <b>wash</b> was significantly elevated. Mononuclear cells were isolated from middle ear mucosa, and an increase in P 6 -specific IgA-producing cells was shown with an enzyme-linked immunospot assay. In addition, an increase in memory T cells in middle ear mucosa was detected with flow cytometric analysis after intranasal immunization. Moreover, in vitro stimulation with P 6 resulted in proliferation of purified CD 4 + T cells from immunized mice, and these T cells expressed Th 2 cytokine mRNA. These results indicate that P 6 -specific IgA–B-cell immune responses and selected Th 2 cytokine expressing Th cells were induced in middle ear mucosa by intranasal immunization. These findings suggest that a nasal vaccine is useful for preventing otitis media with effusion...|$|R
2500|$|Others {{have noted}} the {{similarities}} between the maneki-nekos gesture and that of a cat washing its face. There is a Japanese belief that a cat washing its face means a visitor will soon arrive. This belief may in turn be related to an even older Chinese proverb that states that if a cat washes its face, it will rain. Thus, it is possible a belief arose that a figure of a cat washing its face would bring in customers. In his Miscellaneous Morsels from Youyang, China's Tang Dynasty author Duan Chengshi (803?-863) wrote: [...] "If a cat raises its paw over the <b>ears</b> and <b>washes</b> its face, then patrons will come".|$|R
5000|$|When {{a man is}} {{becoming}} dull of hearing, which happens most often after prolonged headaches, in the first place, the ear itself should be inspected: for there will be found either a crust such as comes upon the surface of ulcerations, or concretions of wax. If a crust, hot oil is poured in, or verdigris mixed with honey or leek juice or a little soda in honey wine. And when the crust has been separated from the ulceration, the ear is irrigated with tepid water, {{to make it easier}} for the crusts now disengaged to be withdrawn by the ear scoop. If it be wax, and if it be soft, it can be extracted in the same way by the ear scoop; but if hard, vinegar containing a little soda is introduced; and when the wax has softened, the <b>ear</b> is <b>washed</b> out and cleared as above. ... Further, the ear should be syringed with castoreum mixed with vinegar and laurel oil and the juice of young radish rind, or with cucumber juice, mixed with crushed rose leaves. The dropping in of the juice of unripe grapes mixed with rose oil is also fairly efficacious against deafness.|$|R

40|$|Washing of {{biodiesel}} removes contaminants (soap, catalyst, methanol {{and free}} glycerin) from biodiesel, {{even though this}} activity will sometimes cause an emulsion. This research aims to develop new method of washing that can minimize emulsification. The method used is misting water in crude biodiesel by certain nozzle. Washing apparatus has 5 main part i. e. nozzle, washing chamber, circulation pump, valve to set level of debit and piping channel. The {{research has been done}} to study dependency of biodiesel washing on the numbers of nozzles (2, 3 and 4), the distance between nozzle and constrictor plate (2 cm, 4 cm, 6 cm and 8 cm) and the level of wash water debit 45. 3 ml/min, 83. 6 ml/min and 150 ml/min. Parameters measured were pH of <b>wash</b> water, <b>emulsion</b> formed, rendemen of biodiesel, quality of biodiesel and energy consumption. Variation of the numbers of nozzles are purposed to have more extensively contact between water and biodiesel. At optimum level of debit, high performance biodiesel washing expeted, with little emulsion can be obtained. The research indicates that the numbers of nozzles, the distance of nozzle and level of water debit are significant variables to determine washing performance. The research showed that washing biodiesel with the numbers of nozzles 4 pc, debit of washing water 83. 6 ml/min and 45. 3 ml/min and distance between nozzle and constrictor plate 8 cm produce 100 % biodiesel for every step washing, with pH of washing water at third washing 7. 1 and emulsion formed 81. 6 ml. Misting water in oil method needs smaller energy than others, i. e. only 4 % of stirrer method and 1. 2 % of bubble method. Quality biodiesel – i. e. density, flash point, cetane index, cloud point, moisture content, viscosity – meets ISO standard...|$|R
40|$|The {{increasing}} numbers of product containing nanosilver have raised a great concern about their possible impact in the environment especially in the ionic form {{which leads to the}} toxicity problem when the association occurs with the organism cells. Therefore, the main focus {{of this study was to}} investigate several parameters influencing the recovery of ionized nanosilver from <b>wash</b> water using <b>emulsion</b> liquid membrane (ELM) process. This process involves three phases dispersion system including external, membrane and internal phase. The membrane phase was prepared by dissolving bis [2, 4, 4 -trimethylpentyl] monothiophosphinic acid (Cyanex 302) as a carrier and Sorbitan Monooleate (Span 80) as a surfactant in kerosene as a diluent. Thiourea in Sulfuric acid (H 2 SO 4) was used as a stripping agent in the internal phase. The important parameters such as extraction time, carrier and stripping agent concentrations were investigated. All experiments were conducted in batch system. The concentration of the ionized nanosilver was measured using Atomic Absorption Spectrometry (AAS). The result demonstrated that almost 100 % of silver ion was extracted with 91 % have been recovered within 5 minute of extraction time using 0. 005 M Cyanex 302 and 1. 0 M Thiourea in 1. 5 M H 2 SO 4.

40|$|Caffeic acid, a hydroxycinnamic acid {{common in}} {{different}} vegetable sources, has been {{employed as a}} natural antioxidant for inhibiting oxidation of fish lipids present in different food matrices. The aim of this review is to discuss the mechanisms involved in the antioxidative and prooxidative effects of caffeic acid found in different model systems containing fish lipids. These model systems include bulk fish oils, liposomes from cod roe phospholipids, fish oil <b>emulsions,</b> <b>washed</b> cod mince, regular horse mackerel mince and a fish oil fortified fitness bar. The data reported show that the antioxidant activity depends on the physical state of the lipids and {{the composition of the}} intrinsic matrix in which they are situated. Caffeic acid significantly prevented rancidity in both unwashed and washed fish mince, the latter which was fortified with haemoglobin. In the unwashed mince, the activity was however clearly dependent on the lipid to antioxidant ratio. In these systems, an important redox cycle between caffeic acid and the endogenous reducing agents ascorbic acid and tocopherol were further thought {{to play an important role}} for the protective effects. The effect of caffeic acid was also highly dependent on the storage temperature, showing higher effectiveness above than below 0 degrees C. Caffeic acid was not able to inhibit oxidation of bulk fish oils, fish oil in water emulsions and the fish-oil enriched fitness bar. In the liposome system, caffeic acid inhibited haemoglobin (Hb) -promoted oxidation but strongly mediated Fe(2 +) mediated oxidation. In conclusion, caffeic acid can significantly prevent Hb-mediated oxidation in fish muscle foods but its activity in food emulsions and liposomes is highly dependent on the pH, the emulsifier used and the prooxidants present...|$|R
