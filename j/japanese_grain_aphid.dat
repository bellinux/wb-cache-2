40|$|Insects {{are often}} {{infected}} with facultative endosymbiotic bacteria, which {{can have a}} range of important ecological effects. The <b>grain</b> <b>aphid,</b> Sitobion avenae, harbours diverse facultative symbionts, which suggests their importance in <b>grain</b> <b>aphid</b> biology. This thesis attempts to explain the ecological roles of the facultative endosymbionts in S. avenae. It also examines {{the question of whether the}} horizontal transmission of symbionts between aphid clones and species can be important for shaping the ecology and evolution of multi-species aphid communities. Novel techniques developed for research with the <b>grain</b> <b>aphid</b> study system are presented. <b>Grain</b> <b>aphid</b> clones vary in their tolerance to low temperatures, but this trait is not affected by their facultative endosymbionts. Strains of a symbiont Hamiltonella defensa do not protect <b>grain</b> <b>aphids</b> from hymenopterous parasitoids, regardless of the host genotype. However, experienced parasitoid females preferentially oviposit in aphids which do not harbour symbionts. Comparison of the fitness consequences of infection with the same Hamiltonella strains in their original and in novel <b>grain</b> <b>aphid</b> host clones reveal no consistent differences. Symbiont strains establish easily following artificial transfer between clones of the <b>grain</b> <b>aphid,</b> but the symbionts transferred from other aphid species form less stable infections. Hamiltonella strains do not affect the fecundity of their <b>grain</b> <b>aphid</b> host clones regardless of their host species of origin, but also do not generally confer protection against parasitoids. There are no clear patterns in the distribution of parasitoid-resistant phenotypes across phylogenetic trees of Hamiltonella and its bacteriophage APSE. Strains of four unrelated species of endosymbionts, Rickettsia, Spiroplasma, Rickettsiella and Regiella, confer the same pathogen-resistant phenotype to a single pea aphid clone. The same symbiont strains can confer resistance to clones of two different aphid species. Some strains in multiple infections may compensate for the costs of infections with other symbionts. The importance of these results for understanding the ecological and evolutionary role of facultative endosymbionts in aphids and other insects are discussed, and directions for further research are proposed.

40|$|Background: The <b>grain</b> <b>aphid</b> (Sitobion avenae F.) {{is a major}} {{agricultural}} pest {{which causes}} significant yield losses of wheat in China, Europe and North America annually. Transcriptome profiling of the <b>grain</b> <b>aphid</b> alimentary canal after feeding on wheat plants could provide comprehensive gene expression information involved in feeding, ingestion and digestion. Furthermore, selection of aphid-specific RNAi target genes would be essential for utilizing a plant-mediated RNAi strategy to control aphids via a non-toxic mode of action. However, due to the tiny size of the alimentary canal and lack of genomic information on <b>grain</b> <b>aphid</b> as a whole, selection of the RNAi targets is a challenging task {{that as far as}} we are aware, has never been documented previously. Results: In this study, we performed de novo transcriptome assembly and gene expression analyses of the alimentary canals of <b>grain</b> <b>aphids</b> before and after feeding on wheat plants using Illumina RNA sequencing. The transcriptome profiling generated 30, 427 unigenes with an average length of 664 bp. Furthermore, comparison of the transcriptomes of alimentary canals of pre- and post feeding <b>grain</b> <b>aphids</b> indicated that 5490 unigenes were differentially expressed, among which, diverse genes and/or pathways were identified and annotated. Based on the RPKM values of these unigenes, 16 of them that were significantly up or down-regulated upon feeding were selected for dsRNA artificial feeding assay. Of these, 5 unigenes led to higher mortality and developmental stunting in an artificial feeding assay due to the down-regulation of the target gene expression. Finally, by adding fluorescently labelled dsRNA into the artificial diet, the spread of fluorescence signal in the whole body tissues of <b>grain</b> <b>aphid</b> was observed. Conclusions: Comparison of the transcriptome profiles of the alimentary canals of pre- and post-feeding <b>grain</b> <b>aphids</b> on wheat plants provided comprehensive gene expression information that could facilitate our understanding of the molecular mechanisms underlying feeding, ingestion and digestion. Furthermore, five novel and effective potential RNAi target genes were identified in <b>grain</b> <b>aphid</b> for the first time. This finding would provide a fundamental basis for aphid control in wheat through plant mediated RNAi strategy. publishersversionPeer reviewe...|$|R

40|$|A {{monoclonal}} antibody (McAb), EGA- 4 A 9, {{was developed to}} detect the semi-digested proteins of the English <b>grain</b> <b>aphid,</b> Sitobion avenae (Fabricius) (Hemiptera: Aphididae), in predatory ladybird beetles (species of the genera Adonia, Coccinella, Hippodamia, and Propylea) using the gut homogenate of Adonia variegata (Goeze) (Coleoptera: Coccinellidae) adults which had fed on S. avenae as immunogen. The McAb was selected by screening hybridoma lines for antibodies that bound with the semi-digested aphid proteins in ladybirds. A double antibody sandwich enzyme-linked immuno-sorbent assay (ELISA) using ClonotypingTM System/HRP showed that it belonged to the IgG 2 a isotype. It did not cross-react {{with any of the}} 21 arthropod species tested besides the ladybird beetles fed on S. avenae with an indirect ELISA. It could still detect the semi-digested proteins in the gut of a ladybird adult, kept at 25 °C, that had ingested one aphid 6 days before. The extended antigen detection period and the high specificity of the antibody indicated that EGA- 4 A 9 could be used to study interactions between English <b>grain</b> <b>aphids</b> and their ladybird predators in the field. Between 28 and 72 % of coccinellids collected from the field were positive for English <b>grain</b> <b>aphid</b> protein by ELISA.

40|$|Background: The {{sesquiterpene}} (E) -ß-farnesene is {{the main}} component of the alarm pheromone system of various aphid species studied to date, including the English <b>grain</b> <b>aphid,</b> Sitobion avenae. Aphid natural enemies, such as the marmalade hoverfly Episyrphus balteatus and the multicolored Asian lady beetle Harmonia axyridis, eavesdrop on aphid chemical communication and utilize (E) -ß-farnesene as a kairomone to localize their immediate or offspring preys. These aphidpredator systems are important models to study how the olfactory systems of distant insect taxa process the same chemical signal. We postulated that odorant-binding proteins (OBPs), which are highly expressed in insect olfactory tissues and involved in the first step of odorant reception, have conserved regions involved in binding (E) -ß-farnesene. Methodology: We cloned OBP genes from the English <b>grain</b> <b>aphid</b> and two major predators of this aphid species. We then expressed these proteins and compare their binding affinities to the alarm pheromone/kairomone. By using a fluorescence reporter, we tested binding of (E) -ß-farnesene and other electrophysiologically and behaviorally active compounds, including a green leaf volatile attractant. Conclusion: We found that OBPs from disparate taxa of aphids and their predators are highly conserved proteins, with apparently no orthologue genes in other insect species. Properly folded, recombinant proteins from the English <b>grain</b> <b>aphid,</b> SaveOBP 3, and the marmalade hoverfly, EbalOBP 3, specifically bind (E) -ß-farnesene with apparent high affinity.

40|$|Fusarium graminearum is the {{predominant}} causal species of Fusarium head blight in Europe and North America. Different chemotypes {{of the species}} exist, each producing a plethora of mycotoxins. Isolates of differing chemotypes produce nivalenol (NIV) and deoxynivalenol (DON), which differ in toxicity to mammals and plants. However, the effect of each mycotoxin on volatile emissions of plant hosts is not known. Host volatiles are interpreted by insect herbivores such as Sitobion avenae, the English <b>grain</b> <b>aphid,</b> during host selection. Previous work has shown that <b>grain</b> <b>aphids</b> are repelled by wheat infected with DON-producing F. graminearum, and this study seeks to {{determine the influence of}} pathogen mycotoxins to host volatile chemistry.

Acquisition of a novel symbiont strain can provide fitness benefits to the host, with significant ecological and evolutionary consequences. We measured barriers to horizontal transmission by artificially transferring facultative symbionts from the <b>grain</b> <b>aphid,</b> Sitobion avenae, and five other aphid species into two clonal genotypes of S. avenae. We found the symbiont Hamiltonella defensa establishes infections more easily following a transfer from the same host species and that such infections are more stable. Infection success was also higher when the introduced symbiont strain was {{more closely related to}} the strain that was originally present in the host (but which had previously been removed). There were no differences among successfully established symbiont strains in their effect on aphid fecundity. Hamiltonella defensa did not confer protection against parasitoids in our S. avenae clones, although it often does in other aphid hosts. However, strains of the symbiont Regiella insecticola originating from two host species protected <b>grain</b> <b>aphids</b> against the pathogenic fungus Pandora neoaphidis.

40|$|The role of {{proteins}} in cerals resistance against the aphids is still poorly recognized. It was discussed if feeding preferences of these insects are related only to their nutritional demands, or rather to {{their reaction to}} the toxic compounds in plant tissues. Nowadays it is accepted that both the nutrients and other chemical factors determine their preferences of host plant. Aphid feeding on cereals is limited mainly by the proteins due to their low content, strongly dependent on the plant's age. Therefore, protein availability may be a limiting factor for <b>grain</b> <b>aphid</b> growth and reproduction. Electrophoretic composition of main plant protein fractions may also affect the choice and acceptance of host plant by the aphids, and thus determine its high natural resistance.

Ecdysone receptor (EcR) and ultraspiracle protein (USP) play important roles in molting, metamorphosis, and reproduction of insects. EcR and USP orthologs and their function in <b>grain</b> <b>aphid</b> (Sitobion avenae F.) have not been documented yet. Here, RT-PCR, qRT-PCR, dsRNA feeding assay and aphid bioassay were employed to isolate EcR and USP orthologs in <b>grain</b> <b>aphid,</b> investigate their expression patterns, and evaluate the effect of RNAi on aphid survival and fecundity, and its persistence. The results indicated that SaEcR and SaUSP exhibited similar expression profiles at different developmental stages. Oral administration of dsRNAs of SaEcR and dsSaUSP significantly decreased the survival of aphids due to the down-regulation of these two genes, respectively. The silencing effect was persistent and transgenerational, as demonstrated by the reduced survival and fecundity due to knock-down of SaEcR and SaUSP in both the surviving aphids and their offspring, even after switching to aphid-susceptible wheat plants. Taken together, our results demonstrate that SaEcR and SaUSP are essential genes in aphid growth and development, and could be used as RNAi targets for wheat aphid control...|$|R

Secondarily, aphid-elicited alternations in the antioxidative capacity towards DPPH (1, 1 -diphenyl- 2 -picrylhydrazyl) radical in insect-stressed plants were evaluated. Comprehensive comparison of expression profiles of the four sod genes showed that both insect species evoked significant upregulation of three genes sod 2, sod 3. 4 and sod 9). However, aphid infestation affected non-significant fluctuations in expression of sodB gene in seedlings of both maize genotypes. The highest levels of transcript accumulation occurred at 8 h (sod 2 and sod 3. 4) or 24 h (sod 9) post-infestation, and aphid-induced changes in the expression of sod genes were more dramatic in the Ambrozja cultivar than in the Tasty Sweet variety. Furthermore, bird cherry-oat aphid colonization had a more substantial impact on levels of DPPH radical scavenging activity in infested host seedlings than <b>grain</b> <b>aphid</b> colonization.

We assessed, by coupling demographic and genetic methods, the relative contribution of local and transient migrants of the <b>grain</b> <b>aphid</b> Sitobion avenae to wheat field colonization in spring. 2. We examined, during two consecutive years, the daily colonization of wheat by aphid migrants and compared this with daily aphid flight monitored by a local 12. 2 -m suction trap. The genetic profiles of aphids landing on crops were compared with those of both flying aphids caught by the suction trap and local populations from arable crops and hedgerows. 3. In the first year, we observed: (i) a strong correlation between aphids colonizing the crop and those moving within the crop and a close genetic similarity between aphids from these samples and (ii) a high level of genetic differentiation between these aphids and populations from local cereals and field margins. In the second year, the number of migrants recorded on the wheat was three-fold higher than in the previous year, and less correlated with that recorded by the suction trap. This was associated with a lack of genetic differentiation between all samples. 4. This variation in the colonization processes resulted mainly in an abrupt increase in abundance of genotypes from local over-wintering sites in 2004. This suggests that, despite the long range dispersal potential of the <b>grain</b> <b>aphid,</b> outbreak risks could be mainly determined at a local scale, encouraging the design of relatively small management units...|$|R

Although the fusion protein was rapidly degraded by proteases in the insect, Hv 1 a/GNA oral toxicity to M. persicae was significantly greater than GNA alone. A construct encoding the fusion protein, including the GNA leader sequence, under control of the constitutive CaMV 35 S promoter was transformed into Arabidopsis; the resulting plants contained intact fusion protein in leaf tissues at an estimated level of 25. 6 ± 4. 1 ng/mg FW.

However, {{the investigation of the}} transfer and fate of trace metals in soil-plant-arthropod systems in an agricultural context has received little attention, despite the potential threat that secondary toxicity to predatory arthropodsposes to the biological control of crop pests. In this study, an agricultural soil was amended with sewage sludgeat rates up to an equivalent of 100 t (dry solids) ha- 1. The subsequenttransfer of Zn and Cd through an ecologically relevant soil-crop-aphid-arthropod predator systemwasinvestigatedin a series of pot trials. Results show that Zn was transferred {{to a greater extent than}} Cd between all components of the system, except between the roots and shoots. Cadmium was only biomagnified in roots and was biominimised in shoots, aphids and ladybirds. Zinc was biomagnified in roots, shoots, andaphids compared to the soil, but concentrationsin ladybirds were similar to those in the aphids they consumed. Differences between winter and spring wheat were found to have a larger influence on the transfer of Cd and Zn in the systemthan differences between winter wheat and spring barley. It was also shown that the rose <b>grain</b> <b>aphid</b> (Metopolophium dirhodum) accumulateshigher concentrationsof Cd than the <b>grain</b> <b>aphid</b> (Sitobion avenae). Whilst concentrationsof Zn did not differ between the two species of aphid, concentrations in M. dirhodum appearedto be more closely regulated than in S. avenae. Consumptionof S. avenaeby the fourth instar larvae of the seven-spottedladybird (Coccinella septempunctata) did not result in significant differences between treatmentsin newly emergedadults. This was partly the result of the sequestrationof the two metalsin the pupal exuviae. This mechanism had a greater effect on the Cd concentrations in newly emerged adult ladybirds than on Zn concentrations. In a further experiment,there appeared to be no pathway for the transfer of Cd from aphids to adult ladybirds, but a pathway was indicatedfor Zn. The implications of the results are discussed in relation to the agroecosystem andthe wider environment. EThOS - Electronic Theses Online ServiceGBUnited Kingdo...|$|R
40|$|Agricultural pests are not {{restricted}} to crops, but often simultaneously or successively use different cultivated and uncultivated hosts. Nevertheless, the source–sink role of cultivated and uncultivated habitats in {{the life cycle of}} crop pests remains poorly understood. This is largely due to the difficulty of tracking displacements of small organisms in agricultural landscapes. We used stable-isotope ratios in order to infer the natal host plant of individuals of the English <b>grain</b> <b>aphid</b> Sitobion avenae colonizing wheat fields in autumn. We showed that among the numerous plant sources of S. avenae, maize, which has been intensively grown in western France since the 1960 s, provided most aphids that attack wheat fields early in autumn. This study illustrates how insect pests respond to land-use changes within {{a relatively short period of}} time, rapidly acquiring a new host that in turn affected their population biology considerably by playing a pivotal role on their annual life cycle...|$|R
40|$|Data on the {{chemical}} {{composition of the}} aphid epicuticle are scarce and often incongruent depending on the methodological parameters of the extraction and chemical analysis. This study aims to provide a chemical characterization of the epicuticular lipids of the English <b>grain</b> <b>aphid,</b> Sitobion avenae (F.) (Hemiptera: Aphididae). First, our {{results showed that the}} adsorption chromatography on a silica gel column is suitable to separate the hydrocarbons from more polar constituents found in the extract (e. g., wax esters, alcohols, and aldehydes). Then, we showed that other compounds not detected in previous analysis are likely to be constituents of the extract. Through a transesterification reaction, we demonstrated that the extracts produced numerous fatty acid methyl esters that can come either from long chain wax esters or fatty acid parts of cuticular acylglycerols. The possible semiochemical value of the wax esters and other long chain compounds is discussed. This study opens new insight on the identification of host recognition chemical cues by the parasitoids...|$|R
