5|$|The {{completion}} of High Speed 1 <b>has</b> <b>brought</b> <b>the</b> British part of Eurostar's route {{up to the}} same standards as the French and Belgian high-speed lines. Non-stop journey times were reduced by a further 20minutes to 2hours 15minutes for London–Paris and 1hour 51minutes for London–Brussels.|$|E
5|$|Since 1990 {{the total}} number of hours flown {{annually}} by the GA sector has remained in the range 1.25–1.35million, the dominant sector being traditional GA flying, which accounts for 0.6million per year. An overall increase in aircraft numbers combined with nil growth in hours flown <b>has</b> <b>brought</b> <b>the</b> annual average utilisation per aircraft down from 157 hours in 1984 to 103 hours in 2002. The decline in asset utilisation has led to speculation that the economic health of the GA industry is weakening, though the lack of data on profitability makes this difficult to confirm.|$|E

5|$|Great Britain's medal {{performance}} at the 2008 Summer Olympics was its best in a century; only its {{performance at}} the 1908 Summer Olympics, which Britain hosted in London, resulted in more gold medals being awarded. The total medal count, 47, is also the fourth highest Great Britain has ever achieved, with only the 1908, 2012 and 2016 Games resulting in more medals. Following retests of doping samples in 2016 {{in connection with the}} Russian doping scandal, 4 further medals, all bronze, are expected to be awarded in athletics, retrospectively bringing the total gained to 51. As of October 2017, the award of the bronze medals to the Men's and Women's 4 x 400 metres relay teams <b>has</b> <b>brought</b> <b>the</b> official medal total to 49. Goldie Sayers and Kelly Sotherton await reallocation of further medals.|$|E
5|$|Kratos surprises Zeus, seizes the Blade of Olympus, {{and finally}} incapacitates him. Athena {{intervenes}} and implores Kratos to stop, as by killing Zeus, he will destroy Olympus. Kratos ignores her {{and tries to}} kill Zeus, but Athena sacrifices herself by impaling herself upon the blade, granting Zeus escape. Before she dies, Athena reveals that Kratos is actually Zeus' son. Zeus was afraid Kratos would usurp him, just as Zeus had usurped his own father, Cronos. Kratos declares that {{the rule of the}} gods is at an end, then travels back in time and rescues the Titans just before their defeat in the Great War. He returns with the Titans to the present, and the gods watch as their former foes climb Mount Olympus. Kratos, standing on the back of Gaia, declares that he <b>has</b> <b>brought</b> <b>the</b> destruction of Olympus, setting up the events of God of War III.|$|E
5|$|The {{award of}} the 2012 Summer Olympics to London <b>has</b> <b>brought</b> <b>the</b> {{question}} of British {{participation in the}} football tournaments to the fore, given that there is traditionally no single British national football team. The British Olympic Association initially refused {{to rule out the}} possibility of entry for 2008, but were unable to come to an agreement with the Scottish Football Association. The 2007 European Under-21 Championship, which served as the European qualifying tournament for the men's competition, saw the England U-21 team reach the semi-finals, which would have meant a place at the Olympics. Because at the Olympics the team is representative of the entire UK, England were thus prevented from taking this place, with instead a play-off taking place between Portugal and Italy. A similar situation occurred with the England Women's team who, by virtue of being one of the top three European sides at the 2007 World Cup, would have been granted a place at the Olympics. Instead, there was a play-off between Denmark and Sweden.|$|E

5|$|Rose and Pete {{drive to}} the wedding together, and the car that had been meant to kill Pete appears and nearly collides with their car. They join the other guests, {{including}} Jackie who <b>has</b> <b>brought</b> <b>the</b> infant Rose with her. Rose is {{surprised to find that}} Jackie and Pete argue frequently. A young Mickey runs in to warn the guests about the Reapers, who think it is a joke until a Reaper appears above and attacks them. The Doctor runs to the church and directs everyone inside, noting that the age of the church will protect them against the Reapers. The Doctor explains to Rose that her actions have caused a paradox that normally the Time Lords would have prevented. Without them, the Reapers are sterilising the wound in time by consuming everyone within it. The Doctor further warns Rose not to touch her infant self, as it could cause further damage to time and allow the Reapers into the church. Feeling that his TARDIS key is still warm, the Doctor sets it {{up in the middle of}} the church and the TARDIS slowly begins materialising around it.|$|E

25|$|Despite the predation, the {{polymorphism}} survives {{in almost}} all habitats, though the proportions of morphs varies considerably.

While the Type 212 is also being purchased by Italy, the Type 214 has been designed as the follow-on export model and has been sold to Greece, South Korea and Turkey.|$|E
