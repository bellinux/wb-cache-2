25|$|While {{the book}} {{describes}} Israel's many successes in technological innovation, it also attempts to address, <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>words</b> <b>of</b> <b>one</b> reviewer, why Israel still lacks its own Nokia, Samsung, or IBM. According to the book's authors, {{this is partly}} because Israeli startups tend to be bought up by large foreign companies and partly because Israeli business has thus far failed to develop the kind of mature management culture needed to run such companies.|$|E

25|$|Abaza Hasan's {{promotion}} {{to the major}} governorships of Diyarbakır and Aleppo coincided with another major development in Ottoman history: {{the beginning of the}} Köprülü Era. Köprülü Mehmed Pasha had been given the office of grand vizier on 15 September 1656, and since then began carrying out major reforms of the Ottoman state. Some of these aroused widespread opposition, such as the purges he carried out against the Altı Bölük cavalry regiments (of which Abaza Hasan had once been a member). In particular, after his return to Edirne from the 1657 campaign to reconquer the islands of Bozcaada (Tenedos) and Limni (Lemnos), Köprülü Mehmed ordered a massacre of all the cavalry soldiers he suspected of disloyalty - <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>words</b> <b>of</b> <b>one</b> historian, strewing the banks of the Tunca River with corpses. Abaza Hasan already had a history of disloyalty toward Köprülü: In 1657 Köprülü had ordered the execution of the governor of Egypt, and Abaza Hasan secretly aided his escape through Aleppo. Thus, when the order was given for the army to assemble for a campaign against Transylvania, Abaza Hasan and his allies chose not to heed the call. Instead, they gathered at Konya with an army of 30,000, and pledged to oppose Köprülü. Their forces included {{a significant portion of the}} Ottoman military, including the governors of Damascus, Anatolia, Raqqa, and Aleppo, which Abaza Hasan himself governed. The rebels were further supported by members of the imperial cavalry regiments who had fled from Köprülü's purges.|$|E

It can be claim that Sheikh Shabestari made the best and finest Gnostic and theological implications into poetic form. He was impressed by three philosophical-theological schools including the philosophy of Ibn Arabi, the theological school of Ash'ari and the romance of Sanaee. The {{first part of the}} study focuses on the Gnostic concepts and terms <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>words</b> <b>of</b> Sheikh Shabestari. <b>In</b> <b>the</b> following sections, we discuss the Gnostic concepts and the theory <b>of</b> pantheism <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>words</b> <b>of</b> Sheikh. Gnosticism <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>words</b> <b>of</b> Sheikh Mahmoud Shabestari, {{is one of the most}} important issues <b>in</b> <b>the</b> field of Gnostic mainstreaming <b>in</b> <b>the</b> speech of philosophers and famous mystics of Islam. To understand Gnosticism <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>words</b> <b>of</b> Sheikh Mahmoud Shabestari, it is necessary to philosophically investigate and analyze schools and Gnostic and philosophical movements before him which have influenced him. Therefore, in this study we have tried to talk about schools influencing him in addition to describing Gnosticism <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>words</b> <b>of</b> Sheikh Mahmoud Shabestari. Apart from this, we investigate how the Gnosticism of Sheikh Shabestari revolves around a main idea that is pantheism...|$|R
