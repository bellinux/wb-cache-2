5|$|Jim Halpert (John Krasinski) asks Dunder Mifflin CEO David Wallace (Andy Buckley) if he {{can work}} {{part-time}} so he can go to Philadelphia to help with his sports marketing job. David Wallace says {{that he might be}} needed in the office if there <b>is</b> <b>a</b> <b>crisis</b> with one of his clients, to which he responds that Stanley Hudson (Leslie David Baker) and Phyllis Vance (Phyllis Smith) have agreed to cover for him, though he in fact has not asked them yet. Stanley and Phyllis respond with their usual disinterest in helping others, so Jim offers to treat them to lunch. Stanley and Phyllis order extra side dishes and help themselves to an excess of wine, annoying Jim with drunken behavior and silencing him whenever he brings up the subject of their covering for him. When they arrive back at the office, a drunk Stanley and Phyllis are seemingly passed out in the backseat of Jim's car. When Jim puts his coat on them to keep them warm, Phyllis and Stanley say they will cover for him as they care for Jim and his family, laughing as they reveal they were only pranking him. Jim gives both of them a hug.|$|E

25|$|The fall of soviet-style {{communism}} in 1989 elated the cultural world, {{but the experience}} hasn't been an easy one due to problems in the transition period and {{the adoption of a}} free market economy. The discontinuation of state and political control of culture brought about the long dreamt freedom of expression, but, at the same time, the state subsidies also stopped and Romania's culture was seriously affected by the side-effects of the incipient, still very imperfect, free market economy and by inadequate material resources. Culture has had to cope with a variety of problems, one of them being a shift in people's interest towards other areas such as the press and television. The search for a new cultural policy, relying on decentralisation, seems to prevail now. People speak about a crisis of culture in this country, but if there <b>is</b> <b>a</b> <b>crisis</b> of culture, it is only at an institutional level.|$|E
25|$|Queen loss <b>is</b> <b>a</b> <b>crisis</b> for {{a colony}} of social insects, which may cause {{increased}} aggression and work inefficiencies. Also, if the colony can produce a new queen, it could be slow to produce eggs. After queen loss, replacement queens do not mate in the 12 days following queen removal and few had mature eggs in their ovaries. After a month, most replacement queens develop ovaries and mate. Nest growth decreases with colonies that lose their queen, which can be expected if increased dominance behavior interfered with other essential behaviors or if the new queen is not competent at egg laying. Among queenless colonies of P. dominula, individuals demonstrated an increased level of chewing and climbing, but not of lunging and biting. These are all dominance behaviors. No difference of foraging behaviors occurs between colonies with and without queens. Subordinates are kept reproductively suppressed enough {{not to be a}} threat to the existing queen, as indicated by the high cost of queen replacement.|$|E

Some of you always seem to think he is suddenly going to turn a double somersault, and land in our rear and on both of our flanks at the same time. Go back to your command, and try to think {{what we are going to}} do ourselves, instead of what Lee is going to do." ...|$|E
2500|$|In {{the speech}} Bannon invoked the Christian {{concept of the}} Church Militant. He claimed that World War I ushered in [...] "a new Dark Age" [...] that {{continued}} through World War II and which was only able to be overcome by [...] "the heroism of our people...really the Judeo-Christian West versus atheists" [...] combined with the underlying principle of [...] "an enlightened form of capitalism" [...] that was [...] "eventually [...] to take back continental Europe and to beat back a barbaric [...] empire in the Far East." [...] Bannon {{went on to say}} [...] "I believe we've come partly off-track in the years since the fall of the Soviet Union and we're starting now in the 21st century, which I believe, strongly, <b>is</b> <b>a</b> <b>crisis</b> both of our church, a crisis of our faith, a crisis of the West, a crisis of capitalism. And we're at the very beginning stages of a very brutal and bloody conflict, of which if the people in this room, the people in the church, do not bind together and really form what I feel is an aspect of the church militant, to really be able to not just stand with our beliefs, but to fight for our beliefs against this new barbarity that's starting, that will completely eradicate everything that we've been bequeathed over the last 2,000, 2,500 years." [...] Bannon maintained that [...] "the West" [...] was successful due to a capitalism based on [...] "the underlying spiritual and moral foundations of Christianity and, really, Judeo-Christian belief." [...] Which was under threat from [...] "state-sponsored capitalism... you see in China and Russia.", from [...] "Ayn Rand or Objectivist School of libertarian capitalism", and from [...] "immense secularization of the West... the overwhelming drive of popular culture is to absolutely secularize this rising iteration [...]" [...] Bannon held that the undermining of [...] "enlightened capitalism", and the loss of [...] "Judeo-Christian belief" [...] he held it was based on, were in dangerous decline right as [...] "we are in an outright war against jihadist Islamic fascism" [...] which includes Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant, Boko Haram [...] "and other groups that will eventually partner with ISIS in this global war". Bannon called on Christian capitalists to examine the purpose of their wealth and if divine providence was calling on them [...] "to actually be a creator of jobs and a creator of wealth...and make sure that we are reinvesting that back into positive things... bind together as partners with others in other countries" [...] which would better prepare the West at these [...] "the very beginning stages of a global conflict".|$|E

2500|$|In {{the first}} two months (prior to the minor {{escalation}} phase of 23–24 July), the protests did not receive significant coverage in international media, especially relative to the more numerous and violent demonstrations in Turkey, Brazil as well as the anti- and post-Morsi unrest in Egypt. The protest activities and messages have been endorsed by prominent European Union politicians such as European Commissioner for Justice, Fundamental Rights and Citizenship Viviane Reding and also garnered the approval of the French and German ambassadors to Bulgaria, Philippe Autié and Matthias Höpfner. The latter two welcomed Rosen Plevneliev's call for a new morality in politics that is in accordance with European values, also emphasizing that there <b>is</b> <b>a</b> <b>crisis</b> of trust {{when it comes to the}} institutions and elites in the country as well as some worrying signs pertaining a concentration of media ownership, which could herald risks for the continued thriving of freedom of speech. The ambassadors praised both the protesters and the Bulgarian police for behaving in a way that is conducive to the peaceful expression of the civil society spirit. In addition, Autié and Höpfner stressed that the [...] "oligarchic model" [...] is not suitable for any country and could only lead to the creation of a [...] "state within a state". Dutch ambassador to Bulgaria Karel van Kesteren has referred to the protests as a [...] "sign of hope" [...] and the first clear instance of civil society rearing its head to clamor for the observance of European values since Bulgaria's accession to the EU. He also expressed disquiet about the role of Attack as well as its ability to influence proceedings and reminded the government that election wins are just one component of democracy that should not be a substitute for responsible governance and lack of secrecy in decision-making. His Belgian counterpart to Bulgaria Anik van Kalster stated that [...] "the best solution [...] is the one that is widely supported by the society as a whole" [...] and also played down the concerns that Belgian investments in Bulgaria could be negatively affected due to the political uncertainty. In relation to the Peevski situation, she reminded the government of the European Commission's insistence for certain standards to be respected when high-level appointments are made and the need for the primacy of the legal order to remain unchallenged. Van Kalster has lauded the peaceful character of the protests and depicted them as a continuation of the February demonstrations, but with a higher premium placed on ideals and principles rather than economic issues. In June 2013, Hannes Swoboda, President of the group of the S in the European Parliament, stated that the Oresharski government deserves support, maintaining that the social measures suggested by the cabinet were necessary for the country. He also commended Stanishev for being forward-looking and having a long record in promoting modernization. However, Swoboda criticized the appointment of Delyan Peevski as well as the decision to elect Volen Siderov as chairman of the Parliamentary commission for fighting corruption, warning the governing BSP party that it would need to go to extra lengths in order to preserve its values and provide a true [...] "left alternative" [...] to the Borisov cabinet (due to the BSP's alliance with the MRF and Ataka). He also emphasized that Bulgaria needs fundamental changes in its political system and urged the government to be constantly engaged in a dialogue with the wider society and prioritize the promotion of political transparency and democratic principles. In Antoniy Galabov's view, PES' support for Stanishev was a risky strategy, as it could negatively affect the electoral fortunes for the European political party in the 2014 European election. The EU has urged BSP and GERB to exhibit cooperative behaviour towards each other. French ambassador to Bulgaria, Xavier Lapeyre de Cabanes, has diagnosed Bulgaria's corruption problems as deeply rooted, stipulating that the underlying motivations for such protests have been brewing under the surface since the 1990s. He also acknowledges that a variety of anti-corruption measures have been implemented since the collapse of communism and observes that the country's xenophobia has not reached dangerous levels. Daniel Cohn-Bendit, a leading personality during the 1968 student protests in France, sent out a note, in which he expressed support for the Bulgarian student occupiers. Polish historian and prominent former anti-communist dissident Adam Michnik has been more cautious in his assessment of the protests, stating that the main reason for them is the [...] "lack of a political culture as well as an absence of a culture of compromise", which from his standpoint is still an issue for other Eastern European countries besides Bulgaria because of the effects of communism on the mentality of citizens and the paucity of democratic traditions. He sees the political elites as a reflection of society and emphasizes that in cases when fair elections bring unsympathetic [...] "old [...] apparatus" [...] members to power, this needs to be accepted, as [...] "democracy should apply to all, not only to those who are intelligent and have perfectly sound moral qualities".|$|E
