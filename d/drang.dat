5|$|The unit's {{first major}} {{operation}} was the Pleiku Campaign. During this action, the command supported the division during 35 days of continuous airmobile operations. The opening {{battle of the}} campaign, the Battle of Ia <b>Drang</b> Valley, was described in the book We Were Soldiers Once...And Young which was also {{the basis of the}} subsequent Mel Gibson film We Were Soldiers.|$|E
5|$|Friedrich {{began his}} formal study {{of art in}} 1790 as a private student of artist Johann Gottfried Quistorp at the University of Greifswald in his home city, at which the art {{department}} is now named Caspar-David-Friedrich-Institut in his honour. Quistorp took his students on outdoor drawing excursions; as a result, Friedrich was encouraged to sketch from life at an early age. Through Quistorp, Friedrich met and was subsequently influenced by the theologian Ludwig Gotthard Kosegarten, who taught that nature was a revelation of God. Quistorp introduced Friedrich {{to the work of}} the German 17th-century artist Adam Elsheimer, whose works often included religious subjects dominated by landscape, and nocturnal subjects. During this period he also studied literature and aesthetics with Swedish professor Thomas Thorild. Four years later Friedrich entered the prestigious Academy of Copenhagen, where he began his education by making copies of casts from antique sculptures before proceeding to drawing from life. Living in Copenhagen afforded the young painter access to the Royal Picture Gallery's collection of 17th-century Dutch landscape painting. At the Academy he studied under teachers such as Christian August Lorentzen and the landscape painter Jens Juel. These artists were inspired by the Sturm und <b>Drang</b> movement and represented a midpoint between the dramatic intensity and expressive manner of the budding Romantic aesthetic and the waning neo-classical ideal. Mood was paramount, and influence was drawn from such sources as the Icelandic legend of Edda, the poems of Ossian and Norse mythology.|$|E
25|$|A new <b>Drang</b> nach Osten {{was called}} for by German nationalists to oppose a Polish <b>Drang</b> nach Westen ("thrust toward the West"). World War I had ended with the Treaty of Versailles, by which most or parts of the Imperial German provinces of Posen, West Prussia, and Upper Silesia were given to reconstituted Poland; the West Prussian city of Danzig became the Free City of Danzig.|$|E

25|$|Jakob Michael Reinhold Lenz (23 January 1751, or 12 January in the Julian calendar–4 June 1792, or 24 May in the Julian calendar) was a Baltic German {{writer of}} the Sturm und <b>Drang</b> movement.|$|E
25|$|Plumley was a {{prominent}} and central figure in the 1992 book We Were Soldiers Once… and Young by Lt. Gen Hal Moore and Joseph L. Galloway about the Battle of Ia <b>Drang</b> and was portrayed by actor Sam Elliott in the 2002 film adaption.|$|E
25|$|Despite <b>Drang</b> nach Osten policies, {{population}} movement {{took place in}} the opposite direction also, as people from rural low-developed areas in the East were attracted by the prospering industrial areas of Western Germany. This phenomenon became known by the German term Ostflucht, literally the flight from the East.|$|E
25|$|In 1992 Moore wrote We Were Soldiers Once… And Young with {{co-author}} Joseph L. Galloway. The {{book was}} adapted into the 2002 film We Were Soldiers, which was filmed at Forts Benning and Hunter Liggett, depicting Moore's command of 1st Battalion, 7th Cavalry, at Fort Benning {{and in the}} Battle of Ia <b>Drang.</b>|$|E
25|$|The Skyraider {{was also}} {{featured}} {{as one of}} the many aircraft providing close air support during the First Battle of the Ia <b>Drang</b> Valley Campaign in Mel Gibson's 2002 film We Were Soldiers, based on the non-fiction book We Were Soldiers Once… And Young by Lieutenant General (Ret.) Hal Moore and reporter Joseph L. Galloway.|$|E
25|$|The {{flexible}} {{shifting of}} tempo and styles however {{was not without}} cost. Tens of thousands of VC and PAVN regulars were required and on several occasions when attempts were made at confrontation in remote areas, such as at the Ia <b>Drang</b> in 1965 and in the 1967 border battles, heavy losses were suffered from US firepower.|$|E
25|$|Crandall's {{exploits}} (along {{with those}} of many others) at the Battle of Ia <b>Drang,</b> are depicted in the 1992 book We Were Soldiers Once...And Young (by Harold G. Moore and Joseph L. Galloway), and in the related 2002 movie, We Were Soldiers, where he is portrayed by Greg Kinnear. Crandall served as an aviation consultant during filming in 2001.|$|E
25|$|Basil L. Plumley (January 1, 1920– October 10, 2012) was {{a career}} soldier and {{airborne}} combat infantryman in the United States Army who eventually achieved {{the rank of}} Command Sergeant Major.

25|$|We Were Soldiers is a 2002 American war {{film that}} dramatizes the Battle of Ia <b>Drang</b> on November 14, 1965. The film was {{directed}} by Randall Wallace and stars Mel Gibson.

25|$|With the {{development}} of romantic nationalism in the 19th century, Polish and Russian intellectuals began referring to the German Ostsiedlung as <b>Drang</b> nach Osten. The German Empire and Austria-Hungary attempted to expand their power eastward; Germany by gaining influence in the declining Ottoman Empire (the Eastern Question) and Austria-Hungary through the acquisition of territory in the Balkans (such as Bosnia and Herzegovina).|$|E
25|$|Started in 1973 by Frank Chadwick, Rich Banner, Marc Miller, and Loren Wiseman, GDW's first game, <b>Drang</b> Nach Osten!, {{immediately}} garnered {{attention and}} led to the Europa series. They quickly followed this with other games, which also got favorable reviews. It has been estimated that GDW published one new product every 22 days for the 22 year life of the company (to be fair, this would include magazines and supplements, not just complete games).|$|E
25|$|Even though Japan {{had been}} {{fighting}} in China since 1937, the conventional {{view is that the}} war began on September 1, 1939, when Nazi Germany invaded Poland, the <b>Drang</b> nach Osten. Within two days the United Kingdom and France declared war on Germany, even though the fighting was confined to Poland. Pursuant to a then-secret provision of its non-aggression Molotov-Ribbentrop Pact, the Soviet Union joined with Germany on September 17, 1939, to conquer Poland and to divide Eastern Europe.|$|E
25|$|The UH-1 was {{a central}} part of the 2002 Vietnam war film We Were Soldiers. The {{helicopter}} was shown ferrying troops into the Ia <b>Drang</b> valley as part of the then-new concept of air cavalry. The film particularly focused on the flights of Major Bruce Crandall, who was later awarded the Medal of Honor for his actions while piloting his UH-1 during the battle depicted in the film. Four of the UH-1s used were provided by the Georgia Army National Guard.|$|E
25|$|Bruce Perry Crandall (born February 17, 1933) is {{a retired}} U.S. Army officer who {{received}} the Medal of Honor for his actions as a pilot during the Battle of Ia <b>Drang</b> on November 14, 1965 in South Vietnam. During the battle, he flew 22 missions in an unarmed helicopter into enemy fire to evacuate more than 70 wounded and bring ammunition and supplies to US forces. By {{the end of the}} Vietnam War, he had flown more than 900 combat missions.|$|E
25|$|Boyd and Kim Dupree, {{parents of}} the four DuPree siblings, ran a venue called Brewtones Coffee Galaxy by occupying the space of their Vineyard church on days when {{it was not in}} use. Eisley, then known as the Towheads, began years of service as the house band, giving them their first exposure. At Brewtones, the band played with many other acts such as Ester <b>Drang,</b> Midlake, Waterdeep, and others. The band played {{numerous}} weekend shows at the venue until they became too busy with other opportunities.|$|E
25|$|At {{the end of}} the film, it is {{revealed}} that the landing zone immediately reverted to North Vietnamese hands after the American troops were airlifted out. Hal Moore continued the battle in a different landing zone, and after nearly a year he returns home safely to Julia and his family. His superiors congratulate him for killing over 1,800 North Vietnamese Army and Viet Cong soldiers. An older Moore visits the Vietnam War memorial and sees the names of soldiers who fell at Ia <b>Drang.</b>|$|E
25|$|After his {{retirement}} in 1977, Moore served as the Executive President of the Crested Butte Ski Area, Colorado. In June 2009, the 87-year-old Moore attended the formal opening of the National Infantry Museum in Columbus, Georgia. One of the featured exhibits of the museum is a life-size diorama of L.Z. X-Ray from the Battle of Ia <b>Drang.</b> The Moores had five children, Greg Moore, Steve Moore, Julie Moore Orlowski, Cecile Moore Rainey, and David Moore, as well as twelve grandchildren. Two of their sons are career U.S. Army officers: one a retired colonel and another a retired lieutenant colonel.|$|E
25|$|Assessment of VC/NVA {{performance}} {{must look}} beyond the American interlude, and the guerrilla warfare phases to the final outcome of the Vietnam War in 1975. Well before the end, the Viet Cong were reduced to a minor force, and regular PAVN formations controlled the field. While final victory was aided by absence of American airpower, the PAVN/VPA armies were no longer the light-infantry formations mauled at the Battle of Ia <b>Drang</b> in 1965, but a tough, proficient, well-equipped modern force. Their capabilities had grown considerably, and several shortcomings of the conventional 1972 Easter Offensive were remedied.|$|E
25|$|Ion Sân-Giorgiu (also {{known as}} Sîn-Giorgiu, Sângiorgiu or Sîngiorgiu; 18931950) was a Romanian modernist poet, dramatist, essayist, {{literary}} and art critic, {{also known as}} a journalist, academic, and fascist politician. He was notably the author of works on the Sturm und <b>Drang</b> phenomenon and the influence of Johann Wolfgang von Goethe. During his early years, he was influenced by Expressionism and contributed to the literary magazine Gândirea; he progressively moved towards support for the Iron Guard (the Legionary Movement), edited the far right journal Chemarea Vremii, and spent his last years as a member of Horia Sima's government in exile.|$|E
25|$|The Gulf of Tonkin {{incident}} of 2 August 1964 {{led to a}} dramatic increase in direct American participation in the war, with nearly 200,000 troops deployed {{by the end of the}} year. Viet Cong and PAVN strategy, organization and structure meant Westmoreland faced a dual threat. Regular North Vietnamese army units infiltrating across the remote border were apparently concentrating to mount an offensive and Westmoreland considered this the danger that had to be tackled immediately. There was also entrenched guerrilla subversion throughout the heavily populated coastal regions by the Viet Cong. Consistent with the enthusiasm of Robert McNamara for statistics, Westmoreland placed emphasis on body count and cited the Battle of Ia <b>Drang</b> as evidence the communists were losing. However, the government wished to win at low cost, and policymakers received McNamara's interpretation indicating huge American casualties in prospect, prompting a reassessment of what could be achieved. Moreover, the Battle of Ia <b>Drang</b> was unusual in that US troops brought a large enemy formation to battle. After talking to junior officers General Johnson became skeptical about localised concentrated search and destroy sweeps of short duration, because the Communist forces controlled whether there were military engagements, giving an option to simply avoid battle with US forces if the situation warranted it. The alternative of sustained countrywide pacification operations, which would require massive use of US manpower, was never available to Westmoreland, because it was considered politically unacceptable.|$|E
25|$|The Soviet Union {{viewed the}} 1933 {{accession}} of fervently anti-Communist Hitler's government {{to power in}} Germany with great alarm from the onset, especially since Hitler proclaimed the <b>Drang</b> nach Osten {{as one of the}} major objectives in his vision of the German strategy of Lebensraum. The Soviets supported the republicans of Spain who struggled against fascist German and Italian troops in the Spanish Civil War. In 1938–1939, immediately prior to WWII, the Soviet Union successfully fought against Imperial Japan in the Soviet-Japanese Border Wars in the Russian Far East, which led to Soviet-Japanese neutrality and the tense border peace that lasted until August 1945.|$|E
25|$|As Mozart matured, he {{progressively}} incorporated more features {{adapted from}} the Baroque. For example, the Symphony No.29 in A major K.201 has a contrapuntal main theme in its first movement, and experimentation with irregular phrase lengths. Some of his quartets from 1773 have fugal finales, probably influenced by Haydn, who had included three such finales in his recently published Opus20 set. The influence of the Sturm und <b>Drang</b> ("Storm and Stress") period in music, with its brief foreshadowing of the Romantic era, {{is evident in the}} music of both composers at that time. Mozart's Symphony No.25 in G minor K.183 is another excellent example.|$|E
25|$|The Robbers (Die Räuber): The {{language}} of The Robbers is highly emotional, and {{the depiction of}} physical violence in the play marks it as a quintessential work of Germany's Romantic Sturm und <b>Drang</b> movement. The Robbers is considered by critics like Peter Brooks {{to be the first}} European melodrama. The play pits two brothers against each other in alternating scenes, as one quests for money and power, while the other attempts to create revolutionary anarchy in the Bohemian Forest. The play strongly criticises the hypocrisies of class and religion, and the economic inequities of German society; it also conducts a complicated inquiry into the nature of evil. Schiller was inspired by the play Julius of Tarent by Johann Anton Leisewitz.|$|E
25|$|Johann Gottfried von Herder (1744–1803) broke {{new ground}} in {{philosophy}} and poetry, {{as a leader}} of the Sturm und <b>Drang</b> movement of proto-Romanticism. Weimar Classicism ("Weimarer Klassik") was a cultural and literary movement based in Weimar that sought to establish a new humanism by synthesizing Romantic, classical, and Enlightenment ideas. The movement, from 1772 until 1805, involved Herder as well as polymath Johann Wolfgang von Goethe (1749–1832) and Friedrich Schiller (1759–1805), a poet and historian. Herder argued that every folk had its own particular identity, which was expressed in its language and culture. This legitimized the promotion of German language and culture and helped shape the development of German nationalism. Schiller's plays expressed the restless spirit of his generation, depicting the hero's struggle against social pressures and the force of destiny.|$|E
25|$|Against US {{forces the}} record is more mixed. There {{were a number of}} successes {{particularly}} in ambushes, sapper attacks and various other engagements. When entrenched in strong positions, they were able to exact a price on attacking American troops, before withdrawing to cross-border sanctuaries to fight another day. VC/NVA operations however were sometimes marked by very heavy casualties. Typical of these were the Tet attacks and the border battles that saw heavy losses against superior US air, ground and naval firepower. American strategic mobility, using airpower and helicopters also took a heavy toll and blunted several communist initiatives, most notably at the Ia <b>Drang,</b> Tet and other places. In general during the war, US forces caused far more casualties to the VC/NVA than the other way round. However, the communist forces were usually able to replenish their forces. Expansion of the battle-space over a wide area, and attrition over time however, the linchpin of their protracted war strategy, kept their forces intact until this formidable opponent withdrew.|$|E
25|$|The film's final version, though getting many of {{the facts}} of the book {{presented}} onto film, is not entirely a historically accurate portrayal of the battle, nor is it entirely faithful to the book. For instance, the film depicts a heroic charge under the command of Lt. Col. Hal Moore {{at the end of the}} battle that destroys the Vietnamese reserve, ending the battle in an American victory (a fact that director Randall Wallace noted in the DVD commentary); in fact, there was no heroic final charge in the book, nor were the North Vietnamese forces destroyed, though the American commander Moore reported 834 enemy bodies and 1215 estimated KIA (one-third of the enemy force) while the US forces were reduced by 72, out of 395, with 18% fatal casualties. Lt. Col. Nguyen Huu An, the Vietnamese commander, did not see the conclusion at LZ X-Ray as the end of combat, and the Battle of Ia <b>Drang</b> continued the next day with combat action at LZ Albany where the 2/7th, with A Company 1/5th, found themselves in a fight for their lives against Lt. Col. Nguyen Huu An's reserve.|$|E
500|$|For Max Scheler, {{the concept}} of <b>Drang</b> is the {{centerpiece}} of philosophical anthropology and metaphysics. [...] Though his concept has been important throughout his entire philosophical career, it was only developed later in his life when his focus shifted from phenomenology to metaphysics. [...] Like Bergson's élan vital, <b>Drang</b> (drive or impulsion) is the impetus of all life; however, unlike in Bergson's vitalistic metaphysics, the significance of <b>Drang</b> is that it provides the motivation and driving force even of Spirit (Geist). [...] Spirit, which includes all theoretical intentionality, is powerless without the movement of <b>Drang,</b> the material principle, as well as Eros, the psychological principle.|$|E

500|$|... "I Don't Give A" [...] is a midtempo pop {{song with}} a [...] "ballsy" [...] {{electronic}} hip hop and industrial beats. Tracklisted {{after the initial}} dance tunes in MDNA, the mood for the song is dark and somber, with a Sturm und <b>Drang</b> chorus and backed by an orchestra that The New York Times reviewer Jon Pareles compared to composer Carl Orff's cantata, Carmina Burana. The ending of the song consists of a big outro, with [...] "grandiose" [...] choirs, [...] "crashing" [...] cymbals and [...] "escalating" [...] strings. Critics noted that Madonna's rap in the song {{is similar to that}} on her 2003 single [...] "American Life".|$|E
500|$|... "You and I" [...] {{received}} acclaim {{from music}} critics. After hearing the White Tie and Tiara Ball performance, Entertainment Weekly Leah Greenblatt complimented the song for its [...] "torchy, slow-burn cabaret quality" [...] and for lacking [...] "Auto-Tune, fancy production, or performance gimmicks." [...] McCormick, noting {{the differences between}} Gaga's live and studio versions of the song, described the studio version as [...] "bigger, bolder and less quirkily emotive, a custom-built radio rock ballad to induce hand claps in packed stadiums. This is not music for the underground: it is cheesy, high-gloss, pop rock for the mainstream middle, a kind of instant Eighties retro classic to seduce middle-aged rockers – possibly the last demographic to remain sceptical about her appeal." [...] Jody Rosen of Rolling Stone called the song a confessional power ballad [...] "with a torrid, Sturm und <b>Drang</b> vocal turn". In his review for The Guardian, Tim Jonze said the song [...] "aims for a 'Hey Jude' style singalong but – owing to its determination to have someone playing kitchen sink in the background – ends up as bloated as Oasis' 'All Around the World'." [...] Dan Aquilante of The New York Post wrote a less-than-favorable review of Born This Way but complimented [...] "You and I" [...] and the [...] "uniquely earthy quality" [...] that Lange brought to the album. Kitty Empire said the song is Gaga's [...] "unlikely heartland moment – a bid, perhaps, to locate herself as an all-American balladeer {{as well as an}} art-disco avatar with tent pegs under her skin", referring to the implants featured in the music video for the song [...] "Born This Way." ...|$|E
