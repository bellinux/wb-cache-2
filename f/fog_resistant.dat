Open-label studies have suggested that intravenous (IV) amantadine is effective against <b>FOG</b> <b>resistant</b> to dopaminergic therapy in Parkinson's disease (PD). We evaluated the efficacy of IV amantadine on <b>FOG</b> <b>resistant</b> to dopaminergic therapy. This was a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, cross-over study on IV amantadine. The placebo (normal saline) and amantadine (400 mg/day) were injected for 2 days with a 52 -hour washout period. The instruments for the outcome measures were the Freezing of Gait Questionnaire (FOGQ), Unified Parkinson's disease rating Scale (UPDRS), and the duration of the 4 × 10 m walking test. The placebo arm was compared to the amantadine arm. Ten patients were enrolled but two patients withdrew, one from each arm. The FOGQ and UPDRS scores and the duration of the 4 × 10 m walking test improved in both arms compared to the baseline (P< 0. 05 in all). However, there were no differences in these values between the amantadine arm and placebo arm (P = 0. 368, P = 0. 583, P = 0. 206, respectively). Follow-up measures 2 weeks after discharge in an open-label study showed the beneficial effects of an amantadine tablet on FOG (FOGQ, P = 0. 018; UPDRS, P = 0. 012 respectively). This double blind, placebo-controlled study did not show the efficacy of IV amantadine on FOG when compared with the placebo.

40|$|Background: Freezing of gait (FOG) {{is one of}} {{the most}} {{disabling}} symptoms in Parkinsonism. Open-label studies have suggested that intravenous (IV) amantadine is effective against <b>FOG</b> <b>resistant</b> to dopaminergic therapy in Parkinson’s disease (PD). We evaluated the efficacy of IV amantadine on <b>FOG</b> <b>resistant</b> to dopaminergic therapy. Methodology/Principal Findings: This was a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, cross-over study on IV amantadine. The placebo (normal saline) and amantadine (400 mg/day) were injected for 2 days with a 52 -hour washout period. The instruments for the outcome measures were the Freezing of Gait Questionnaire (FOGQ), Unified Parkinson’s disease rating Scale (UPDRS), and the duration of the 4610 m walking test. The placebo arm was compared to the amantadine arm. Ten patients were enrolled but two patients withdrew, one from each arm. The FOGQ and UPDRS scores and the duration of the 4610 m walking test improved in both arms compared to the baseline (P, 0. 05 in all). However, there were no differences in these values between the amantadine arm and placebo arm (P = 0. 368, P = 0. 583, P = 0. 206, respectively).

40|$|Gladiolus {{is one of}} {{the most}} cultivated, {{economically}} important and common flowering plants worldwide including Pakistan. Fusarium corm rot caused by Fusarium oxysporum f. sp. Gladioli mass {{is one of the}} most serious diseases of Gladiolus; it can reduce corm and flower production. Management of Fusarium wilt is mainly through chemical soil fumigation and resistant cultivars. Cormels pieces of four reported highly Fusarium susceptible Gladiolus cultivars (Friendship, peter pears, Victo Borge and Novalux) formed friable calli when cultured in-vitro on MS basal medium containing 2, 4 -D and BAP. The friable calli of each cultivar established cell suspensions in their respective callus maintenance gelrite free G 2 -medium. One week after the initiation of suspension cultures only few viable cells could be visualized under microscope. At initial stages of suspension cultures, two types of cells were noted. The first cell type consisted of elongated. And with on starch contents. The second type was round in shape and small in size as compared with the first type of cells. Plantlets were regenerated from the all four cultivars of immature cormel slices when the cormel slices went through a cellus phase. Plant regeneration was obtained form the control callus, control cells suspension derived callus, Gamma irradiated callus and in-vitro selected <b>FOG</b> <b>resistant</b> cell-lines of Gladiolus CV-I. Cell suspension or cell suspension derived calli of CV- 4 did not regenerate plants after 36 months. The calli derived from cell suspension with 15 - 30...|$|E
40|$|Freezing of Gait (FOG) is a {{frequent}} and disabling feature of Parkinson disease (PD). Gait rehabilitation assisted by electromechanical devices, such as training on treadmill associated with sensory cues or assisted by gait orthosis {{have been shown to}} improve FOG. Overground robot assisted gait training (RGT) has been recently tested in patients with PD with improvement of several gait parameters. We here evaluated the effectiveness of RGT on FOG severity and gait abnormalities in PD patients. Eighteen patients with <b>FOG</b> <b>resistant</b> to dopaminergic medications were treated with 15 sessions of RGT and underwent an extensive clinical evaluation before and after treatment. The main outcome measures were FOG questionnaire (FOGQ) global score and specific tasks for gait assessment, namely 10 meter walking test (10 MWT), Timed Up and Go test (TUG) and 360 ° narrow turns (360 NT). Balance was also evaluated through Fear of Falling Efficacy Scale (FFES), assessing self perceived stability and Berg Balance Scale (BBS), for objective examination. After treatment, FOGQ score was significantly reduced (P= 0. 023). We also found a significant reduction of time needed to complete TUG, 10 MWT, and 360 NT (P= 0. 009, 0. 004 and 0. 04, respectively). By contrast the number of steps and the number of freezing episodes recorded at each gait task did not change. FFES and BBS scores also improved, with positive repercussions on performance on daily activity and quality of life. Our results indicate that RGT is a useful strategy for the treatment of drug refractory FOG...|$|E
