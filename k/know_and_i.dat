So you take those words and just let them go whichever way they want...'Moonshadow'? Funny, that was in Spain, I went there alone, completely alone, {{to get away from}} a few things. And I was dancin' on the rocks there... right on the rocks where the waves were, like, blowin' and splashin'. Really, it was so fantastic. And the moon was bright, ya <b>know,</b> <b>and</b> <b>I</b> started dancin' and singin' and I sang that song and it stayed. It's just the kind of moment that you want to find when you're writin' songs.|$|E

Here he met Sidney Webb, a junior civil servant who, like Shaw, was busy educating himself. Despite difference of style and temperament, the two quickly recognised qualities in each other and developed a lifelong friendship. Shaw later reflected: [...] "You knew everything that I didn't <b>know</b> <b>and</b> <b>I</b> knew everything you didn't know... We had everything to learn from one another and brains enough to do it".|$|E

And I {{just thought it was}} incredible that this guy's not singing about 'moon in June' and he's getting away with it. That's what I thought at the time. The subject matter wasn't pop songs, ya <b>know,</b> <b>and</b> <b>I</b> thought this kind of opens the whole thing up ... Dylan put it into the mainstream that this could be done." ...|$|E
500|$|In a November 2003 {{interview}} with Mike Wallace {{on the television}} news magazine 60 Minutes, Taylor claimed he hired and sent prostitutes to opponents' hotel rooms the night before a game {{in an attempt to}} tire them out, and that at his peak, he spent thousands of dollars a day on narcotics. He also recounted several other instances of aberrant behavior, including arriving to a team meeting during his playing career in handcuffs after spending a night with some call girls. He said, [...] "A couple of ladies that were trying out some new equipment they had. You <b>know?</b> <b>And</b> <b>I</b> just happened to, and they just didn't happen to have the key."

The subject matter wasn't pop songs, ya <b>know,</b> <b>and</b> <b>I</b> thought this kind of opens the whole thing up." [...] Morrison's record producer at the time, Bert Berns, encouraged him to find models for his songs, so he bought Dylan's Bringing It All Back Home album in March 1965.

500|$|Stephen Holden of The New York Times {{said that}} the album was [...] "refreshing", and that Collins was [...] "adept" [...] at setting a suspenseful or menacing mood. Holden {{described}} [...] "Only You <b>Know</b> <b>and</b> <b>I</b> Know" [...] as an [...] "angry love song" [...] that had some sampling of [...] "Motown" [...] style music mixed in. [...] "In 'One More Night', Mr. Collins's recent number-one hit, a ticking snare drum injects a whisper of lurking fear into a song that suggests a sweeter, tenderer reprise of 'Against All Odds'", says Holden. Holden concluded by saying [...] "On the surface, No Jacket Required, is an album bursting with soulful hooks and bright peppy tunes. But beneath its shiny exterior, Mr. Collins's drums and his voice carry on a disjunctive, enigmatic dialogue between heart and mind, obsession and repression." ...|$|E

You know, his addiction is obviously serious, drugs, and, but, Trump is just addicted to feeling important. You <b>know,</b> <b>and</b> <b>I</b> think if anybody is under the delusion that he cares about, uh, uh, anybody in America besides himself, they are, they are stoned and need to rethink their priorities, 'cause he's, you know, 'cause it's just ridiculous that's he's gotten as far as he has." ...|$|E

In the same entry she wrote {{that she did not}} think about marriage because [...] "it's not the time now". She later wrote that she [...] "had it out" [...] with Nikolai and [...] "wrote him a note in the sense of 'but I'm given to the one and will love no other one". Ultimately in her last diary record, filled with sombre tones, Shanina wrote that she [...] "cannot find a solace" [...] now and is [...] "of no use to anyone".|$|E

'Express Yourself' is one of the routines that I <b>know</b> <b>and</b> <b>I</b> used to really like doing that one because it is where she shows her bra and holds her crotch." [...] In 2010, singer Christina Aguilera paid tribute to [...] "Express Yourself" [...] with the music video of her single, [...] "Not Myself Tonight". She commented [...] "One of my favorite videos ever is 'Express Yourself' by Madonna which came across as really strong and empowering which I always try to incorporate through my expression of sexuality... I love the direct reference I made to Madonna with the eye glass moment and the smoke and stairs. I was paying tribute to a very strong woman who has paved the way before." [...] James Montgomery from MTV deemed [...] "Express Yourself" [...] as the primary influence of Aguilera's video with scenes like Aguilera displaying a monocle, standing atop a flight of stairs and crawling across the floor while pouring a black liquid over herself.

500|$|Following {{the events}} of WrestleMania 21, the next night on Raw, Muhammad Hassan and Daivari came out to confront and assault Michaels. On the April 11 episode of Raw, Michaels {{approached}} authority figure Eric Bischoff, in which he demanded a handicap match with Hassan and Daivari, a match consisting of one wrestler or team of wrestlers facing off against a team of wrestlers with numerical superiority such as two against one, or three against two. Bischoff refused to schedule the match, but informed Michaels to find a partner and he would grant him the match. Michaels then made a plea for Hulk Hogan {{to come back and}} team with him. On the April 18 episode of Raw, Hassan again led an attack on Michaels until Hogan appeared to save Michaels and accept his offer. At Backlash, Hassan and Daivari lost to Hogan and Michaels when Daivari was pinned. On the July 4 episode of Raw, Michaels and Hulk Hogan had a tag team match, which they won. During the post-match pose, Michaels hit Hogan with his superkick, knocking Hogan to the ground and making Michaels a villain {{for the first time since}} returning in 2002. The following week on Raw, Michaels appeared on Piper's Pit where he superkicked Roddy Piper and then challenged Hogan to a match at SummerSlam. Hogan defeated Michaels at SummerSlam, and after the match Michaels extended his hand to him, saying [...] "I needed to <b>know,</b> <b>and</b> <b>I</b> found out" [...] and he and Hogan shook hands.

That's because, little did we know at the time, the other guitarist had only one song ready a month before studio (despite telling us he had material for four songs) so either way we would have had four weeks to write the rest of the album.
