40|$|A {{major goal}} of the Digital Systems Technology Branch at the NASA Lewis Research Center is to {{identify}} and develop critical <b>digital</b> <b>components</b> and <b>technologies</b> that either enable new commercial missions or significantly enhance the performance, cost efficiency, and/or reliability of existing and planned space communications systems. NASA envisions a need for low-data-rate, interactive, direct-to-the-user communications services for data, voice, facsimile, and video conferencing. The network would provide enhanced very-small-aperture terminal (VSAT) communications services and be capable of handling data rates of 64 kbps through 2. 048 Mbps in 64 -kbps increments. Efforts have concentrated heavily on the space segment; however, the ground segment has been considered concurrently to ensure cost efficiency and realistic operational constraints. The focus of current space segment developments is a flexible, high-throughput, fault-tolerant onboard information-switching processor (ISP) for a geostationary satellite communications network. The Digital Systems Technology Branch is investigating both circuit and packet architectures for the ISP. Destination-directed, packet-switched architectures for geostationary communications satellites are addressed...|$|R

Component video is capable of carrying signals such as 480i, 480p, 576i, 576p, 720p, 1080i and 1080p, although many TVs do not support 1080p through component video.|$|R
40|$|Given the {{technological}} {{progress in the}} fields of <b>digital</b> <b>components</b> and Information <b>Technology</b> within substations, new generations of instrument transformers with digital output, known as Non Conventional Instrument Transformers (NCIT) and/or Electronic Instrument transformers (EIT) are now becoming attractive for large scale application. These devices (both primary sensors & digital interfaces), which are typically very compact, have already been analysed & described by a WG of SC A 3 (publication imminent). However, even though digital communication methods are being used more often for new substations and for the modernisation of existing installations, the interface between high voltage equipment and low voltage equipment (so called " 0 / 1 interface") remains predominantly classical (100 V/√ 3, 1 or 5 A). To promote digital communication for this " 0 / 1 interface " and to obtain all the advantages of Information Technology, the development of a "Stand Alone Merging Unit " (SAMU) is under widespread consideration. This new equipment is an essential tool to enable the use of classical magnetic ITs alongside NCITs in the same substation; an essential consideration for the refurbishment of existing substations. The ability to mix conventional & non-conventional devices will also tend to accelerate the development of EITs with digital interfaces. The use of digital output for ITs (magnetic or electronic) requires development & adaptation of the accuracy testing procedures and the development of appropriate methods for in-factory and on-site calibration which may become more frequent with the deregulation of electric power companies. The redundancy of various equipment and links will also need to be considered to achieve the high reliability and availability levels required for a modern electrical network. This accuracy testing & calibration activity is the main focus of thi...|$|R
40|$|One of the {{greatest}} challenges in evaluating reliability of digital I&C systems is how to obtain better failure rate estimates of <b>digital</b> <b>components.</b> A common practice of the <b>digital</b> <b>component</b> failure rate estimation is attempting to use empirical formulae to capture the impacts of various factors on the failure rates. The applicability of an empirical formula is questionable because it is not based on laws of physics and requires good data, which is scarce in general. In this study, the concept of population variability of the Hierarchical Bayesian Method (HBM) is applied to estimating the failure rate of a <b>digital</b> <b>component</b> using available data. Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) simulation is used to implement the HBM. Results are analyzed and compared by selecting different distribution types and priors distributions.

40|$|Abstract. Significant {{economic}} and technical benefits accrue {{from the use}} of pre-existing and commercially available software components to develop new systems. However, challenges remain that, if not adequately addressed, will slow the adoption of software <b>component</b> <b>technology.</b> Chief among these are a lack of consumer trust in the quality of components, and a lack of trust in the quality of assemblies of components without extensive and expensive testing. This paper describes prediction-enabled <b>component</b> <b>technology</b> (PECT). A PECT results from integrating <b>component</b> <b>technology</b> with analysis models. An analysis model permits analysis and prediction of assembly-level properties prior to component composition, and, perhaps, prior to component acquisition.

40|$|Nearly all {{software}} organizations today {{develop and}} maintain {{more than a}} single product. This holds for organizations that develop tailored systems individually for single customers, as well as for organizations that develop products for a mass market.

To implement a product line approach in practice, special technologies are required that effectively support the identification of reusable artifacts, as well as explicit means for capturing and controlling commonalities and variabilities.
