5|$|Briseis, {{at least}} for now, is equally {{affected}} {{by the possibility of}} separation from her lover. Troilus goes to her room and they spend the night together, trying to comfort each other. Troilus is part of the escort to <b>hand</b> <b>her</b> over the next day. Once she is with the Greeks, Diomedes is immediately struck by her beauty. Although she is not hostile, she cannot accept him as her lover. Meanwhile Calchas tells her to accept for herself that the gods have decreed Troy's fall and that she is safer now she is with the Greeks.|$|E
5|$|During {{the course}} of the battle, two of Von der Tanns main turrets were knocked out by British gunfire, while her other two turrets {{suffered}} mechanical failures. The ship was firing so fast that several of the main guns in the amidships turrets became overheated and jammed in their recoil slides, and could not be returned to working order. Von der Tann was without her main battery for 11hours, although three turrets were restored to working order {{before the end of the}} battle; Dturret only after much cutting away of bent metal with oxyacetylene torches—afterwards the guns could be worked only by <b>hand.</b> <b>Her</b> casualties amounted to 11 dead and 35 wounded. During the battle Von der Tann fired 170 heavy shells and 98 secondary caliber shells.|$|E
5|$|Scully {{does the}} autopsy on the {{invisible}} body by covering it in powder. Mulder, meanwhile, researches {{the owner of}} the container. He learns that the man in the picture was extremely wealthy and lucky for a short period, before he died with a giant oversized penis. Mulder believes the woman in the picture is responsible for everything, and determines she is a jinniyah, or a female jinn. Mulder goes to the Stokes residence and asks Leslie to <b>hand</b> <b>her</b> over, presuming her to be kept in a box. It turns out, however, that she is not in the box, but back in the storage facility, where Mulder also finds pictures of the jinniyah next to Benito Mussolini in the 1930s and next to Richard Nixon in the 1960s, two men that had a lot of power and lost it in a bad way.|$|E

5|$|A minor {{incident}} in the K'iche' capital Q'umarkaj escalated to have important consequences. A K'iche' soldier tried to seize bread from a Kaqchikel woman who was selling it in the market. The woman refused the soldier and drove him off with a stick. The Kaqchikel demanded {{the execution of the}} K'iche' soldier while the K'iche' nobility demanded the punishment of the Kaqchikel bread seller. When the Kaqchikel lords refused to <b>hand</b> <b>her</b> over, the K'iche' lords sentenced Hun-Toh and Wuqu-Batz' to death against the wishes of the K'iche' king K'iq'ab. King K'iq'ab warned his Kaqchikel friends and advised them to flee Q'umarkaj. On the day 13 Iq' of the Kaqchikel calendar the four lords of the Kaqchikel led their people out of the K'iche' capital to found their own capital at Iximche. The exact year of this event is not known with certainty but {{is believed to have been}} between AD 1470 and 1485, with some scholars, such as Guillemín, preferring 1470. The Kaqchikel abandoned their previous capital Chiavar (speculated to be modern Chichicastenango) because it was too close to Q'umarkaj.|$|E

25|$|The {{fact that}} Yagoda {{was one of}} the accused showed the speed at which the purges were {{consuming}} their own. It was now alleged that Bukharin and others sought to assassinate Lenin and Stalin from 1918, murder Maxim Gorky by poison, partition the U.S.S.R and <b>hand</b> <b>her</b> territories to Germany, Japan, and Great Britain, and other preposterous charges.|$|E

25|$|Despite not {{participating}} {{on the campaign}} trail, Jacqueline became subject of intense media attention with her fashion choices. On one hand, she was admired for her personal style; she was frequently featured in women's magazines alongside film stars and named {{as one of the}} 12 best-dressed women of the world. On the other <b>hand,</b> <b>her</b> preference for French designers and her spending on her wardrobe brought her negative press. In order to downplay her wealthy background, Jacqueline stressed the amount of work she was doing for the campaign and declined to publicly discuss her clothing choices.|$|E
25|$|Bree was {{released}} from her psychiatric hospital and returned to Ferndale after Brooke's husband Boyd (Sam Bunkall) plead to her to donate a kidney to a sick Brooke.

Nonetheless, Bree bailed and Brooke paid her off to leave Ferndale. Bree returned claiming she had suffered another psychotic episode, though it was soon clear she had in fact murdered Travis Corfield (John Tui) and had returned to steal his money. Bree eventually confessed this to Brooke and tried to escape, only for her own sister to <b>hand</b> <b>her</b> into the police.|$|E

To resolve his father's dilemma, Devavrata agrees to relinquish his right to the throne. As the fisherman is not sure about the prince's children honouring the promise, Devavrata also takes a vow of lifelong celibacy to guarantee his father's promise.|$|E

500|$|The Imperatritsa Ekaterina Velikaya ( [...] , or Empress Catherine the Great) was {{the second}} ship of the [...] dreadnoughts of the Imperial Russian Navy.

She was renamed Svobodnaya Rossiya ( [...] , Free Russia) after the February Revolution, but saw no further combat. She was evacuated from Sevastopol as the Germans approached in May 1918, but was scuttled in Novorossiysk harbor the following month when the Germans demanded that the Soviets <b>hand</b> <b>her</b> over according {{to the terms of}} the Treaty of Brest-Litovsk.|$|E
500|$|Charles I, {{also known}} as Charles Robert ( [...] ; 128816 July 1342) was King of Hungary and Croatia from 1308 to his death. He {{was a member of}} the Capetian House of Anjou and the only son of Charles Martel, Prince of Salerno. His father was the eldest son of Charles II of Naples and Mary of Hungary. She laid claim to Hungary after her brother, Ladislaus IV of Hungary, died in 1290, but the Hungarian prelates and lords elected her cousin, Andrew III, king.

500|$|Mileena {{returns in}} Mortal Kombat (2011), an alternative-timeline retelling of the {{original}} Mortal Kombat trilogy that brought some major changes to her character. In this game, Mileena was created by Shang Tsung in the [...] "Flesh Pit" [...] and introduced during the second tournament, instead of many years earlier. Meant to be a loyal replacement for Kitana, she is physically and mentally damaged, her animalistic rage controlled only by Shao Kahn as she uses her lascivious behavior to lure victims and then slaughter and devour them. In the game's story mode, she serves as an opponent for Kitana, Jade, Stryker and Kabal, and is referred to by Shao Kahn as his [...] "true daughter", succeeding him after his death by Raiden's <b>hand.</b> <b>Her</b> very immature personality and behavior is {{in sharp contrast to}} the scheming Mileena of the previous games. The game's Challenge Tower mode has Mileena develop unrequited feelings for Scorpion, while Kitana's uncanonical ending shows her as being unusually sympathetic towards Mileena.|$|E
500|$|Though not {{native to}} Nicaragua, having {{lived in the}} {{stratified}} social order of a Hispanic country, de Mena was able to empathize with Afro-Latina discontent in her travels through Latin America for UNIA and she spoke their language. De Mena's identity shifted as needed. When she was denied a berth on a Pullman car, de Mena used her Nicaraguan passport to gain one. On ship passenger manifests, she claimed to be African, colored, Negro, Spanish American, West Indian, and white on various voyages and was known to travel on both a Nicaraguan and British passport. On the other <b>hand,</b> <b>her</b> [...] "foreigness" [...] was often challenged by the male hierarchy, who had issues with her autonomy. In like manner, she was investigated by the Federal Bureau of Investigation for her activities and relationships with foreigners. De Mena, dedicated {{to the cause of}} improving her race, used her shifting identity for political expediency. Natanya Duncan, even observed that she chose her husbands based on whether they could advance the cause of racial improvement and disposed of them when they became either a liability or did not support her aims.|$|E
