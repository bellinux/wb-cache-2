40|$|Purpose: The {{integration}} of management systems {{is a common}} need nowadays, thus several paradigms exist in the bibliography for relevant efforts. However, the basic effort seems to be mainly {{at the direction of}} aligning processes and documents, taking into account only one of four typical views of organisations' modelling (the <b>function</b> <b>view).</b> Since the <b>function</b> <b>view</b> has been widely studied, this paper aims to focus on the organisation/decision view. Design/methodology/ approach: The proposed approach focuses on the integrated management system (IMS) with respect to the organisation/decision view and offers a control mechanism which guarantees that requirements from all standards will be taken into consideration, while it proposes the use of a well-known multi-criteria decision making technique to support the decision makers. The paper focuses on the organisation/decision view, illustrated through a real case from the chemical industry. Findings: It is concluded that the {{integration of}} management sub-systems into one IMS should be done with respect to each one of the four enterprise modelling views, namely function, information, resource and organisation/decision view. Research limitations/implications: The proposed approach is general and can be applied to many integrated systems where decisions have to be taken. However, the selection of the analytic network process as a decision support tool implies that the decision involves both qualitative and quantitative criteria. In cases where only qualitative or only quantitative criteria exist, another decision support tool may be superior. Originality/value: The originality of the paper stems from the consideration of the organisation/decision view rather than the <b>function</b> <b>view</b> that mostly appears in literature. © Emerald Group Publishing Limited 1754 - 2731...|$|E

40|$|There is no {{question}} that Fichte's theory of conscience is central to his system of ethics. Yet his descriptions of its role in practical deliberation appear inconsistent, if not contradictory. Many scholars have claimed that for Fichte conscience plays a material role by providing the content of our moral obligations—the Material <b>Function</b> <b>View.</b> Some have denied this, however, claiming that conscience only plays a formal role by testing our moral convictions in any given case—the Formal <b>Function</b> <b>View.</b> My aim in this paper is to offer a new contribution to this debate. I begin by supplying further evidence in support of the view that conscience only plays a formal function in Fichte's ethics. Then I call attention to a deeper problem this view faces, namely, that it invites an infinite regress by making one's conviction a matter of higher-order reflection. The key to overcoming this threat, I argue, lies in Fichte's doctrine of feeling, whereby the criterion of one's conviction lies, not in a cognitive state, but in an affective state. In closing, I discuss the relevance of Fichte's theory for current debates over the nature of moral error and moral deference...|$|E

It yields precise, formal specifications of information hiding properties for any protocol formalism and any choice of the attacker model as long as the latter induce an observational equivalence relation on protocol instances. In particular, specifications based on function views are suitable for any cryptographic process calculus that defines some form of indistinguishability between processes. Our definitions of information hiding properties take into account any feature of the security model, including probabilities, random number generation, timing, etc., {{to the extent that it}} is accounted for by the formalism in which the system is specified...|$|E
