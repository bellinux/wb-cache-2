5|$|McKellen and {{his first}} partner, Brian Taylor, a history teacher from Bolton, began their {{relationship}} in 1964. Their relationship lasted for eight years, ending in 1972.

Mathias later directed McKellen in Waiting for Godot at the Theatre Royal Haymarket in 2009. The pair entered into a business partnership with Evgeny Lebedev, purchasing the lease on The Grapes public house in Narrow Street.|$|E
5|$|The player {{assumes the}} role of Tomoya Okazaki, the protagonist of Clannad. Tomoya has been labeled a delinquent; at the {{beginning}} of the story, he even expresses hatred toward the city <b>he</b> <b>has</b> <b>lived</b> in all his life where Clannad is set.

Despite this, Tomoya is very loyal to his friends, and has been known to dedicate himself for those around him in need of help or support.

5|$|Ben then visits Jack, {{telling him}} his real name, and that <b>he</b> <b>has</b> <b>lived</b> {{on the island}} all his life. He offers that if Jack cooperates, he can be sent home. Jack {{believes}} the Others are also stranded just as he is, but Ben informs him of the exact time and date of his plane crash and that 69 days have since passed (making the date November 29, 2004) and insists {{that they are in}} contact with the outside world. He shows this by citing various current events, such as the re-election of George W. Bush to the American presidency, the sudden death of Christopher Reeve and that the Boston Red Sox have won the 2004 World Series. Once Ben tells him about the Red Sox, Jack starts laughing and says that proves he is lying. Ben then proves it by playing a recording of the final play in the game as Jack watches in shock.|$|E
5|$|The name of Sejanus {{continued}} to be pressed into political service during the 18th century. Prime Minister Robert Walpole was attacked in 1735 {{in the course of}} a popular skit, C----- and country: A play of seven acts...the whole concluding with the grand masque, call'd, The downfall of Sejanus; its authorship is attributed to 'a masquerader' and in the printed version the masque precedes the play, although it is performed last. This gives the clue of how to take what is to follow and consists of a conversation between Punch and the Hangman, opening with the question 'Is this same Sejanus to go out of the World like a Man, or to die the Death of a mad Dog? For <b>he</b> <b>has</b> <b>lived</b> like a sad One, from the first Day that the Emperor Tiberius took him into Favour.' A subtler attack on a later prime minister occurred in 1769 when Jonson's Sejanus was reissued under the title of The Favourite. This was prefaced with a tongue-in-cheek dedication to Lord Bute, denying that there can be any comparison between the conduct of Sejanus and that of his lordship.|$|E
5|$|Irvine {{is married}} to wife Rita, whom he met in a public house in Burnley. The couple were wed on 3 October 1966 and have three sons; Darren, Stephen and Jonathan, who played semi-professional {{football}} for Nelson and Colne. <b>He</b> <b>has</b> <b>lived</b> {{in the village of}} Worsthorne since retiring from football in 1974. Following his retirement he rented a warehouse from a friend and started a do-it-yourself retail business in the centre of Burnley. The shop was reasonably successful, and Irvine opened a second branch in Keighley, West Yorkshire. However, the business became untenable after several years and left Irvine owing £44,000 to the bank after a potential buyer for the shop pulled out of the deal. Following the collapse of the business, Irvine suffered severe depression and at one stage attempted suicide by taking an overdose of paracetamol tablets. He was discovered in time by his wife and admitted to Burnley General Hospital, where he underwent an emergency procedure to pump his stomach. After the attempt, he got a part-time job with Burnley Borough Council, working with young people at local community centres. He later worked as a window cleaner for 12months before selling the round for a profit. Irvine then took a job in an engineering factory, where he worked for 14years, before joining electrical firm LED. From there, he moved to Aeropia, an aircraft parts manufacturer, where he has worked as a stores manager ever since. On matchdays at Turf Moor, he gives guided tours of the ground to supporters.|$|E
