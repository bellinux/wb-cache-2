25|$|Phenolics or phenol {{formaldehyde}} (PF) – <b>high</b> <b>modulus,</b> relatively heat resistant, and excellent fire resistant polymer. Used for insulating parts in electrical fixtures, paper laminated products (e.g. Formica), thermally insulation foams. It is a thermosetting plastic, with the familiar trade name Bakelite, {{that can be}} molded by heat and pressure when mixed with a filler-like wood flour or can be cast in its unfilled liquid form or cast as foam (e.g. Oasis). Problems include the probability of moldings naturally being dark colors (red, green, brown), and as thermoset {{it is difficult to}} recycle.|$|E

40|$|The {{structural}} {{effects of}} additives in performance improvement of aminoplastic adhesive resins were discussed. The comparative titration behavior of pure melamine-urea formaldehyde (MUF) resins and MUF resin with seven different additives were shown.

50|$|Kevlar, an aramid fiber, {{has become}} the {{predominant}} fiber for racing sails, since it was introduced by DuPont in 1971. It is stronger, has a higher strength to weight ratio than steel, and has a modulus that is five times greater than PET, and about {{twice as high as}} PEN. There are two popular types of Kevlar: Type 29 and Type 49, the latter having a 50% <b>higher</b> initial <b>modulus</b> than Type 29 but a lower flex loss. DuPont has developed <b>higher</b> <b>modulus</b> Types 129, 149 and 159, but these have seen little use in sails, since generally as the modulus increases the flex strength decreases. DuPont has recently introduced Kevlar Edge, a fiber developed specifically for sails with 25% higher flex strength and a <b>higher</b> <b>modulus</b> than Kevlar 49.Kevlar, along with other aramid fibers, have poor UV resistance (Kevlar loses strength roughly twice as quickly in sunlight as PET) and rapid loss of strength with flexing, folding and flogging. Minimal flogging and careful handling can greatly extend the life of a Kevlar sail.|$|R
5000|$|PEN is {{used for}} {{manufacturing}} high performance fibers that have very <b>high</b> <b>modulus</b> and better dimensional stability than PET or Nylon fibers.|$|E
50|$|The {{history of}} AuTx started in 1976 with the {{creation}} of the first Russian para-aramid fibres under the name SVM (Super <b>High</b> <b>modulus</b> Fibre). The process of fibre forming was principally different from those used while forming of Kevlar and Twaron aramid fibres. The SVM fibre had high strength (190-220 cN/tex), <b>high</b> <b>modulus</b> (75-100 GPa) and high elongation at break (3,0-4,0%). This fibre was used in high strength lightweight composites and as a fabric was used in the creation of first flexible Russian bullet-proof vests.|$|E
50|$|Reinforced {{plastics}} are {{a recent}} class of composite materials {{in which the}} low modulus and temperature limitations of plastic is overcome by reinforcing it with fibres of <b>high</b> <b>modulus.</b>|$|E
40|$|The {{recent years}} have {{witnessed}} some serious attempts to use wood and vegetable fibers, such as reed fibers, in concrete as reinforcement or as light weight aggregate due to its low cost and relatively high tensile strength. Unfortunately the durability of these materials in concrete media is very low due to the high PH value of concrete. The effect of some coatings on the tensile strength, modulus of elasticity and absorption of reed exposed to media of high PH value is investigated. The effects of these coatings on the modulus of rupture of cement mortar prisms reinforced with reed are also investigated. Many coatings, namely, epoxy paint, styrene –butadiene rubber (SBR), polyvinyl acetate (PVA), and liquid mastic were used. It is concluded that epoxy paint has shown the most superior qualities as a coating by exhibiting less absorption, higher tensile strength, <b>higher</b> <b>modulus</b> of elasticity and <b>higher</b> <b>modulus</b> of rupture...|$|R
50|$|The {{hardness}} of {{a material}} {{is directly related}} to its incompressibility, elasticity and resistance to change in shape. A superhard material has <b>high</b> shear <b>modulus,</b> <b>high</b> bulk <b>modulus</b> and does not deform plastically. Ideally superhard materials should have a defect-free, isotropic lattice. This greatly reduces structural deformations that can lower the strength of the material. However, defects can actually strengthen some covalent structures. Traditionally, high-pressure and high-temperature (HPHT) conditions have been used to synthesize superhard materials, but recent superhard material syntheses aim at using less energy and lower cost materials.|$|R
40|$|Phenylethynyl-terminated poly(arylene ethers) are {{prepared}} {{in a wide}} range of molecular weights by adjusting monomer ratio and adding an appropriate amount of 4 -fluoro- 4 '-phenylethynyl benzophenone during polymer synthesis. The resulting phenylethynyl-terminated poly(arylene ethers) react and crosslink upon curing for one hour at 350 C to provide materials with improved solvent resistance, <b>higher</b> <b>modulus,</b> and better <b>high</b> temperature properties than the linear, uncrosslinked polymers...|$|R

50|$|A unique {{feature of}} the dam is its {{spillway}}. The spillway {{is located on the}} embankment, rather than on one of the rock abutments. This had never been successfully attempted before in the design of dams of any significant height, due to problems in making allowance for embankment settlements. In the case of Crotty Dam, the embankment was partly composed of well graded gravels, and thus a very <b>high</b> <b>modulus</b> of embankment deformation was achieved. The <b>high</b> <b>modulus</b> limits embankment settlements. Additionally, the spillway was designed to articulate in order to accommodate any settlement that did occur.|$|E
50|$|Co-Cr alloy {{dentures}} {{and cast}} partial dentures have been commonly manufactured since 1929 due to lower cost and lower density compared to gold alloys; however, Co-Cr alloys tend to exhibit a <b>higher</b> <b>modulus</b> of elasticity and cyclic fatigue resistance, which are significant factors for dental prosthesis. The alloy is a commonly {{used as a}} metal framework for dental partials. A well known brand for this purpose is Vitallium.|$|R
50|$|Increasing {{the amount}} of SBR in the blend {{decreased}} the storage modulus due to intermolecular and intramolecular interactions that can alter the physical state of the polymer. Within the glassy region, EPDM shows the <b>highest</b> storage <b>modulus</b> due to stronger intermolecular interactions (SBR has more steric hindrance that makes it less crystalline). In the rubbery region, SBR shows the <b>highest</b> storage <b>modulus</b> resulting from its ability to resist intermolecular slippage.|$|R
50|$|Typical COC {{material}} {{will have}} a <b>higher</b> <b>modulus</b> than HDPE and PP, similar to PET or PC. COC also has a high moisture barrier for a clear polymer along with a low moisture absorption rate. In medical and analytical applications, COC is noted to be a high purity product with low extractables. COC is also a halogen-free and BPA-free product. Some grades of COC have shown a lack of estrogenic activity.|$|R

5000|$|<b>High</b> <b>modulus</b> asphalt concrete, {{sometimes}} referred to by the French-language acronym EMÉ (enrobé à module élevé), uses a very hard bituminous (penetration 10/20), sometimes modified, in proportions close to 6% on {{the weight of the}} aggregates, and a proportion of mineral powder also high, between 8-10%, to create an asphalt concrete layer with a <b>high</b> <b>modulus</b> of elasticity, of the order of 13000 MPa, as well as very high fatigue strengths. HMAC layers are used both in reinforcement operations and in the construction of new reinforcements for medium and heavy traffic. In base layers, they tend to exhibit a greater capacity of absorbing tensions and, in general, better fatigue resistance.|$|E
50|$|Woven fabric {{with high}} UV and {{abrasion}} protection {{is added to}} the film-on-film. This combines the best of the above, but is costly, heavy, and stiff. This is an attractive method to combine <b>high</b> <b>modulus</b> fibers with poor UV resistance.|$|E
40|$|The {{definitive}} {{version is}} available at [URL] {{of the factors that}} affect the rheological characteristics of fibril gels are discussed. Fibrils with nanoscale diameters from β-lactoglobulin (β-lg) and α-lactalbumin (α-la) have been used to create gels with different rheological characteristics. Values of the gelation time, tc, the critical gel concentration, c 0, and the equilibrium value of the storage modulus, G, such as G'inf at long gelation times, derived from experimental rheological data, are discussed. Fibrils created from β-lg using solvent-incubation and heating result in gels with different rheological properties, probably because of different microstructures and fibril densities. Partial hydrolysis of α-la with a serine proteinase from Bacillus licheniformis results in fibrils that are tubes about 20 nm in diameter. Such a fibril gel from a 10. 0 % w/v α-la solution has a <b>higher</b> <b>modulus</b> than a heat-set gel from a 10 % w/w β-lg, pH 2. 5 solution; it is suggested that one reason for the <b>higher</b> <b>modulus</b> might be the greater stiffness of α-la fibrils. However, the gelation times of α-la fibrils are longer than those of β-lg fibrils...|$|R
40|$|A novel {{nanocomposite}} {{based on}} nanodiamond (ND) powder and Poly (lactic acid) (PLA) for potential bio-engineered applications was fabricated {{for the first}} time by using melting compound methods. Its structure and mechanical properties were investigated by using transmission electron microscopy (TEM), scanning electron microscopy (SEM) and tensile property test. The results showed that as compared with pure PLA, ND/PLA nanocomposites possessed <b>higher</b> <b>modulus,</b> <b>higher</b> strength and comparable elongation at break, in other words, the mechanical properties of PLA were significantly improved by incorporating ND powder into it. This is presumably due to homogeneous dispersion of ND cluster, good interfacial bonding and unique ND bridge structures in the ND/PLA nanocomposites...|$|R
30|$|However, {{the drying}} {{shrinkage}} of mortars reduces significantly {{by increasing the}} glass cullets dosage. When 100 % calcareous gravel is replaced by waste glass, the shrinkage of the corresponding mortar becomes less than one-third of that of the reference mortar (0 %). This {{is due to the}} <b>higher</b> <b>modulus</b> of elasticity of glass cullets compared to that of calcareous gravel. Again, the silane addition does not change significantly the behaviour of mortars.|$|R

50|$|Carbon fiber is a <b>high</b> <b>modulus</b> {{synthetic}} fiber made from carbon atoms. It is virtually unaffected by UV exposure and provides exceptionally low stretch.

50|$|Wovens on {{both sides}} of a scrim without the film layer. The problem is getting enough <b>high</b> <b>modulus</b> yarn into the sandwich, and still being able to get a good bond, because, {{dissimilar}} fabrics don’t often bond well. This technique is more experimental than practical, but may yield results in time.|$|E
40|$|The elastic moduli of the α-helix, polyglycine II, and the parallel-chain and antiparallel-chain pleated sheet {{structures}} {{have been}} calculated. A Urey-Bradley type of potential was used, extended by {{the inclusion of}} hydrogen bond stretching terms where appropriate. In the one instance where a valid comparison with experimental data can be made, viz, α-keratin, the calculations indicate that the matrix component, rather than being amorphous, probably contains an ordered structure of <b>higher</b> <b>modulus</b> than the α-helix...|$|R
40|$|The {{effect of}} {{crystallization}} temperature on the morphology of two Syndiotactic Polypropylene (sPP) was examined {{in terms of}} crystal dimensions and initial phase composition. Investigations show that the mechanical parameters correlated qualitatively with the phase composition, crystallite size and their orientation.

50|$|The {{stiffness}} of a structure is of principal importance in many engineering applications, so the {{modulus of elasticity}} is often {{one of the primary}} properties considered when selecting a material. A <b>high</b> <b>modulus</b> of elasticity is sought when deflection is undesirable, while a low modulus of elasticity is required when flexibility is needed.|$|E
50|$|Pitch-based {{carbon fibers}} have various end uses {{due to their}} high strength. These fibers are used within the {{aerospace}} industry due to their <b>high</b> <b>modulus</b> and higher price. These fibers could be used within the automotive and sports industries, but the cheaper PAN based carbon fibers provide a high enough strength for these applications.|$|E
50|$|Twaron is an aramid, {{which is}} {{produced}} in The Netherlands by Teijin, is chemically and physically similar to DuPont’s Kevlar. Twaron HM (<b>High</b> <b>modulus)</b> has similar stretch properties to Kevlar 49, greater tensile strength and better UV resistance. Twaron SM is similar to Kevlar 29. Like Kevlar, the fiber is a bright gold color.|$|E

Mechanical spectra of stimulated and unstimulated human submandibular-sublingual saliva (HSMSL) and human parotid saliva (HPS) were compared. The HSMSL saliva had <b>higher</b> <b>modulus</b> and longer relaxation times due to higher mucus content than the parotid saliva. Unstimulated saliva showed the same behaviour when compared to stimulated saliva, but only after a resting period of 20 minutes...|$|R
40|$|The oldest joint set in Devonian {{rocks of}} western New York state has an {{atypical}} NS strike and predates regionally more abundant NW-striking and ENE-striking joints driven by hydrocarbon-related fluid decompression. The NS joints originated in <b>higher</b> <b>modulus</b> diagenetic carbonate and were driven initially {{by a different}} mechanism, either joint-normal stretching and/or thermoelastic contraction. The origin of these joints in <b>higher</b> <b>modulus</b> carbonate concretions indicates {{the presence of a}} tensile stress produced by uniform regional extensional strain. Upper Devonian shale hosting the NS joints crops out in that area of the Appalachian Basin where a Morrowan erosional unconformity marks the region of maximum upward lithospheric flexure of an early Alleghanian forebulge. The NS strike of these early joints points to a forebulge stretching axis oriented approximately east-west and associated in time and space with crustal loading that drove both the Northfieldian Orogeny and the underplating of the Bronson Hill Anticlinorium in New England. Ultimately, subsidence of the Morrowan forebulge buried the Upper Devonian shale succession to the oil window during {{the latter part of the}} Alleghanian tectonic cycle resulting in the propagation of fluid driven NW- and ENE-trending joints in black shale...|$|R
