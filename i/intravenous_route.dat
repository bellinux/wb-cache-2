40|$|Vidarabine (adenine arabinoside) is a purine {{nucleoside}} useful in humans for therapy of {{herpes simplex virus}} encephalitis and herpes zoster virus infections in immunocompromised patients. However, the potential usefulness of vidaribine is limited by its poor solubility, which requires continuous infusion in relatively large volumes of intravenous fluid. Vidarabine 5 ′-monophosphate is highly soluble and has the advantage {{that it can be}} administered intermittently intramuscularly or intravenously. In a clinical, pharmacokinetic study, plasma levels and urinary excretion of vidarabine 5 ′-monophosphate were determined after intravenous and intramuscular administration in 29 immunosuppressed patients with herpes simplex or zoster virus infections at dosages of 15 to 30 mg/kg per day administered for 5 days. As determined by high-pressure liquid chromatography, vidarabine 5 ′-monophosphate was metabolized in a fashion comparable to the metabolism of vidarabine and its major metabolite in plasma was arabinosyl hypoxanthine. After administration, 40 to 50 % of the vidarabine 5 ′-monophosphate was recovered from the urine as arabinosyl hypoxanthine, and 3 to 4 % was recovered as vidarabine. Determinations of areas under the curve for arabinosyl hypoxanthine were not statistically different by dosage for intramuscular or <b>intravenous</b> <b>routes</b> of administration. At all dosages studied, viral clearance appeared to occur with therapy. The advantage of increased solubility will lead to controlled clinical investigations in which vidarabine 5 ′-monophosphate is administered by intramuscular or <b>intravenous</b> <b>routes</b> against targeted human herpesvirus infections...|$|R
40|$|Administration of {{therapeutic}} entities by inhalation opens new possibilities for drug entry into systemic circulation, but this requires {{passage through the}} alveolar epithelium. Little {{is known about the}} pulmonary metabolism of verapamil. Specifically, this cardiovascular drug suffers from extensive first pass metabolism. We therefore evaluated the metabolism of verapamil in cultured alveolar epithelium and compared findings with results after administration by inhalation and <b>intravenous</b> <b>routes.</b> Specifically, cell culture of alveolar epithelium was characterized by gene expression of surfactant proteins A, B, C, and D, by immunohistochemistry of surfactant protein C, by staining for laminar bodies, and by gene expression of cytochrome P 450 monooxygenases. During 6 days of culture expression, all cellular differentiation markers were obvious, albeit at different levels. With testosterone as substrate, we found alveolar epithelial cells to produce several stereo- and site-specific hydroxylation products. This provided evidence for metabolic competence of cultured alveolar epithelial cells. With verapamil as substrate, only limited production of metabolites was observed in cell culture assays, and similar results were recorded after administration by inhalation and <b>intravenous</b> <b>routes.</b> Likewise, elimination of verapamil from lung tissue and plasma was similar by both routes of administration. In conclusion, administration of verapamil by inhalation-abrogated extensive first pass metabolism frequently seen after oral application, and this may well be extended to the development of drugs with similar pharmacokinetic defects...|$|R
