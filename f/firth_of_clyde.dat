5|$|In Ireland, Flann Sinna, {{married to}} Constantine's aunt Máel Muire, was dominant. The years around 900 {{represented}} {{a period of}} weakness among the Vikings and Norse-Gaels of Dublin.

In 894 one group left Dublin, perhaps settling on the Irish Sea coast of Britain between the River Mersey and the <b>Firth</b> <b>of</b> <b>Clyde.</b> The remaining Dubliners were expelled in 902 by Flann Sinna's son-in-law Cerball mac Muirecáin, and soon afterwards appeared in western and northern Britain.|$|E
5|$|In {{common with}} the rest of Scotland the <b>Firth</b> <b>of</b> <b>Clyde</b> was covered by ice sheets during the Pleistocene ice ages and the {{landscape}} is much affected by glaciation.

50|$|The Kingdom of Northumbria was {{ascendant}} {{from the}} seventh through the ninth centuries, {{and it was}} the premier regional power in Great Britain between the Humber and the <b>Firths</b> <b>of</b> <b>Clyde</b> and Forth. At the Synod of Whitby in 664, King Oswiu repudiated the Celtic Christianity (so called, and also called Columban after its most notable proponent) that had previously been dominant in the northern Northumbrian territory of Bernicia, and aligned Northumbria with the continental church organisation favoured by Northumbria's southern neighbors.|$|R
50|$|Popularised by Kenneth McKellar (singer) (although {{covered by}} various Scottish singers) {{it is an}} affectionate tribute to the River Clyde in Scotland, name-checking the {{majority}} of towns and villages on its banks.

5|$|Gaelic {{continued}} to exist as a spoken language in the southern Hebrides throughout the Norse settlement period, but place-name evidence suggests it had a lowly status. The obliteration of pre-Norse names is almost total. There is little continuity of style between Pictish pottery {{in the north and}} that of the early Viking period. The similarities that do exist suggests the later pots may have been made by Norse who had settled in Ireland, or by Irish slaves. In the <b>Firth</b> <b>of</b> <b>Clyde,</b> Norse burials have been found on Arran, although not on Bute, and place-name evidence suggests a settlement pattern that was much less well-developed than in the Hebrides. There are numerous Manx Runestones and place names of Norse origin on the Isle of Man.|$|E
50|$|The {{best record}} of any event before the incursions of the Northmen is {{attributed}} to Báetán mac Cairill, king of Ulster, who (according to the Annals of Ulster) led an expedition to Man in 577-578, imposing his authority on the island (though some have thought this event may refer to Manau Gododdin between the <b>Firths</b> <b>of</b> <b>Clyde</b> and Forth, rather than the Isle of Man).

25|$|Scotland's Scapa Flow was {{the main}} base for the Royal Navy in the 20th century. As the Cold War {{intensified}} in 1961, the United States deployed Polaris ballistic missiles, and submarines, in the <b>Firth</b> <b>of</b> <b>Clyde's</b> Holy Loch. Public protests from CND campaigners proved futile. The Royal Navy successfully convinced the government to allow the base because it wanted its own Polaris-class submarines, and it obtained them in 1963. The RN's nuclear submarine base opened four Resolution class Polaris submarines at the expanded Faslane Naval Base on the Gare Loch. The first patrol of a Trident-armed submarine occurred in 1994, although the US base was closed {{at the end of}} the Cold War.|$|R
50|$|Aeron {{could not}} have existed as a kingdom beyond the 7th century. The Kingdom of Northumbria was ascendant, and it would conquer all of Scotland south <b>of</b> the <b>Firths</b> <b>of</b> <b>Clyde</b> and Forth. The {{definitive}} years were {{the middle of the}} 7th century, when Penda of Mercia led an alliance of Mercians, Cymry (from both the north and from Gwynedd), East Anglians, and Deirans against Bernicia. Penda would be defeated and killed at the Battle of Winwaed in 655, ending the alliance and cementing Bernician control over all of Britain between the English Midlands and the Scottish firths. Bernicia would again be united with Deira to form Northumbria as the premier military power of the era. Alt Clut would soon re-establish its independence, but all other Brythonic kingdoms north of the Solway-Tyne were gone forever.|$|R
5|$|HMS Tiptoe (pennant number P332) was a British {{submarine}} of {{the third}} group of the T class. She was built by Vickers Armstrong, Barrow, and launched on 25 February 1944. She {{was one of two}} submarines named by Winston Churchill, and so far has been the only ship of the Royal Navy to be named Tiptoe. In 1955 she was involved in a collision with a coastal steamer whilst in Tromsø harbour. She was involved in escape trials off Malta in 1962, and the commanding officer was reprimanded in 1964 following an incident in the <b>Firth</b> <b>of</b> <b>Clyde</b> where she was run aground, and again in 1965 when she collided with HMS Yarmouth. Although originally named for the ability to sneak up on someone undetected, she maintained several links with ballet, including the Royal Ballet and ballet dancer Moira Shearer. She was scrapped in Portsmouth in 1975, while her anchor is on display in Blyth, Northumberland.|$|E
5|$|In {{the early}} Paleogene period between 63 and 52 Ma, the last {{volcanic}} {{rocks in the}} British Isles were formed. As North America and Greenland separated from Europe, the Atlantic Ocean slowly formed. This led to a chain of volcanic sites west of mainland Scotland including on Skye, the Small Isles and St. Kilda, in the <b>Firth</b> <b>of</b> <b>Clyde</b> on Arran and Ailsa Craig and at Ardnamurchan. Sea levels began to fall, {{and for the first}} time the general outline of the modern British Isles was revealed. At the beginning of this period the climate was sub-tropical and erosion was caused by chemical weathering, creating characteristic features of the Scottish landscape such as the topographical basin of the Howe of Alford near Aberdeen. The vegetation of the period is known from Paleocene sedimentary deposits on Isle of Mull. The rich flora here included temperate-climate tree species such as plane, hazel, oak, Cercidiphyllum, Metasequoia and ginkgo.|$|E
5|$|The Romans began {{military}} expeditions {{into what}} is now Scotland from about 71 CE, building a series of forts, but by 87 the occupation {{was limited to the}} Southern Uplands {{and by the end of}} the first century the northern limit of Roman expansion was a line drawn between the Tyne and Solway Firth. The Romans eventually withdrew to a line in what is now northern England, building the fortification known as Hadrian's Wall from coast to coast. Around 141 CE they undertook a reoccupation of southern Scotland, moving up to construct a new limes between the Firth of Forth and the <b>Firth</b> <b>of</b> <b>Clyde,</b> where they built the fortification known as the Antonine Wall. The wall was overrun and abandoned soon after 160 and the Romans withdrew back to the line of Hadrian's Wall, until Roman authority collapsed in the early fifth century.|$|E
50|$|The Southern Picts, {{for whom}} Ninian is {{held to be}} the apostle, are the Picts south of the {{mountains}} known as the Mounth, which cross Scotland north <b>of</b> the <b>Firths</b> <b>of</b> <b>Clyde</b> and Forth. That they had once been Christian is known from a 5th-century mention of them by Saint Patrick in his Letter to Coroticus, where he refers to them as 'apostate Picts'. Patrick {{could not have been}} referring to the Northern Picts who were converted by Saint Columba in the 6th century because they were not yet Christian, and thus could not be called 'apostate'. Northumbria had established a bishopric among the Southern Picts at Abercorn in 681, under Bishop Trumwine. This effort was abandoned shortly after the Picts defeated the Northumbrians at the Battle of Dun Nechtain in 685.|$|R
50|$|Coates sailed 26 August 1952 {{to join in}} North Atlantic Treaty Organization Operation Mainbrace, {{visiting the}} <b>Firths</b> <b>of</b> <b>Clyde</b> and Forth and Arendal, Norway, before {{returning}} home 11 October.

5000|$|The poem is {{commonly}} {{described as an}} expression of Welsh frustration with the pragmatic, peaceful policies of Hywel Dda towards the then-ascendant Kingdom of Wessex. Edward the Elder (reigned 899 [...] - [...] 924) had gained acknowledged pre-eminence over almost all of the peoples south <b>of</b> the <b>Firths</b> <b>of</b> <b>Clyde</b> and Forth, including the Gaels, Vikings, English, Cornish, Welsh, and the Cumbrians. After he died and his son Æthelstan had become king (reigned 924 [...] - [...] 939), an alliance of the kingdoms of Dublin, Scotland, and Strathclyde rose against him and was defeated at the Battle of Brunanburh in 937. Out of keeping with their historical stance alongside the 'Men of the North' (Gwŷr y Gogledd) and against the English, the Welsh under Hywel Dda had stood aside, neither helping their traditional compatriots (the men of Strathclyde) nor opposing their traditional enemies (the Saxons of Wessex).|$|R
5|$|The {{architecture}} of Scotland includes all human building within the modern borders of Scotland, from the Neolithic era {{to the present}} day. The earliest surviving houses go back around 9500 years, and the first villages 6000 years: Skara Brae on the Mainland of Orkney being the earliest preserved example in Europe. Crannogs, roundhouses, each built on an artificial island, date from the Bronze Age and stone buildings called Atlantic roundhouses and larger earthwork hill forts from the Iron Age. The arrival of the Romans from about 71 AD {{led to the creation}} of forts like that at Trimontium, and a continuous fortification between the Firth of Forth and the <b>Firth</b> <b>of</b> <b>Clyde</b> known as the Antonine Wall, built in the second century AD. Beyond Roman influence, there is evidence of wheelhouses and underground souterrains. After the departure of the Romans there were a series of nucleated hill forts, often utilising major geographical features, as at Dunadd and Dunbarton.|$|E
5|$|In {{the twentieth}} century the {{distinctive}} Scottish use of stone architecture declined as it was replaced by cheaper alternatives such as Portland cement, concrete, and mass-production brick. Stone would however be retained as a material for some housing stock in Edinburgh, Aberdeen and Dumfries, and would undergo revivals. In {{the twentieth century}} private architecture was increasingly client driven. James Robert Rhind (1854–1918), the son of David Rhind, was successful in the competition for new libraries to be constructed in Glasgow following Andrew Carnegie's gift of £100,000 to the city in 1901. His designs were selected for seven libraries, allowing him to demonstrate his individual interpretation of Edwardian Baroque architecture. Rhind's libraries were all built with locally quarried sandstone, which blended in with the existing tenement neighbourhoods. His landmark buildings were greatly enhanced by his liberal use of columns, domes and sculpted features. James Miller (1860–1947) is noted for his Scottish railway stations, such as his 1901–05 extensions to Glasgow Central railway station, and the spectacular Wemyss Bay railway station on the <b>Firth</b> <b>of</b> <b>Clyde.</b>|$|E
5|$|While Illustrious {{was being}} moved in {{preparation}} for her acceptance trials on 24 April, the tugboat Poolgarth capsized {{with the loss of}} three crewmen. The carrier conducted preliminary flying trials in the <b>Firth</b> <b>of</b> <b>Clyde</b> with six Fairey Swordfish torpedo bombers that had been craned aboard earlier. In early June, she loaded the personnel from 806, 815, and 819 Squadrons at Devonport Royal Dockyard; 806 Squadron was equipped with Blackburn Skua and Fairey Fulmar fighters, and the latter two squadrons were equipped with Swordfish. She began working up off Plymouth, but the German conquest of France made this too risky, and Illustrious sailed for Bermuda later in the month to continue working up. This was complete by 23 July, when she arrived in the Clyde and flew off her aircraft. The ship was docked in Clydeside for a minor refit the following day; she arrived in Scapa Flow on 15 August, and became the flagship of Rear Admiral Lumley Lyster. Her squadrons flew back aboard, and she sailed for the Mediterranean on 22 August with 15 Fulmars and 18 Swordfish aboard.|$|E
2500|$|The [...] {{is known}} to have begun {{by the end of the}} last glacial period (in the paleolithic), roughly 10,000 years ago. Prehistoric Scotland entered the Neolithic Era about 4000BCE, the Bronze Age about 2000BCE, and the Iron Age around 700BCE. Scotland's {{recorded}} history began with the arrival of the Roman Empire in the 1stcentury, when the province of Britannia reached as far north as the line between the <b>firths</b> <b>of</b> <b>Clyde</b> to the Forth. North of this was Caledonia, whose people were known in Latin as [...] "Picti", [...] "the painted ones". Constant uprisings forced Rome's legions back: Hadrian's Wall attempted to seal off the Roman south and the Antonine Wall attempted to move the Roman border north. The latter was swiftly abandoned and the former overrun, most spectacularly during the Great Conspiracy of the 360s. As Rome finally withdrew from Britain, Gaelic raiders called the Scoti began colonizing Western Scotland and Wales.|$|R
50|$|Ptolemy {{says that}} in 150 both the Damnonii and the Otadini possessed the land north <b>of</b> the <b>Firth</b> <b>of</b> Forth and south <b>of</b> the <b>Firth</b> <b>of</b> Tay. The Picts were {{constantly}} pressing southward, and by the early 3rd century the Roman Emperor Severus ineffectively campaigned against them. Known then as the Maeatae, the local Picts would ultimately push south to the <b>Firth</b> <b>of</b> Forth and beyond, and by the 7th century the Votadini were being squeezed {{between them and the}} Anglian Bernicians, who were expanding northward.Neither Gododdin nor Manaw Gododdin could have existed as a kingdom beyond the 7th century.

5|$|Mesolithic humans {{arrived in}} the Firth of the Clyde during the fourth {{millennium}} BC, probably from Ireland. This {{was followed by a}} wave of Neolithic peoples using the same route and {{there is some evidence that}} the <b>Firth</b> <b>of</b> <b>Clyde</b> was a significant route via which mainland Scotland was colonised at this time. A particular style of megalithic structure developed in Argyll, the Clyde estuary and elsewhere in western Scotland that has become known as the Clyde cairn. They are rectangular or trapezoidal in shape with a small enclosing chamber faced with large slabs of stone set on end and sometimes subdivided into smaller compartments. A forecourt area may have been used for displays or rituals associated with the interment of the dead, who were placed inside the chambers. They are concentrated in Arran, Bute and Kintyre and it is likely that the Clyde cairns were the earliest forms of Neolithic monument constructed by incoming settlers although few of the 100 or so examples have been given a radiocarbon dating. An example at Monamore on Arran has been dated to 3160 BC, although it was almost certainly built earlier than that, possibly c. 4000BC. There are also numerous standing stones dating from prehistoric times, including six stone circles on Machrie Moor, Arran and other examples on Great Cumbrae and Bute.|$|E
5|$|In December 1404 {{the king}} granted the royal Stewart {{lands in the}} west, in Ayrshire and around the <b>Firth</b> <b>of</b> <b>Clyde,</b> to James in regality {{protecting}} them from outside interference and providing the prince with a territorial centre should the need arise. Yet, in 1405 James was under the protection and tutelage of Bishop Henry Wardlaw of St Andrews on the country's east coast. Douglas animosity was intensifying because of the activities of Orkney and Fleming who continued to expand their involvement in border politics and foreign relations with England. Although a decision to send the young prince to France and out of Albany's reach was taken {{in the winter of}} 1405–06, James's departure from Scotland was unplanned. In February 1406 Bishop Wardlaw released James to Orkney and Fleming who, with their large force of Lothian adherents, proceeded into hostile Douglas east Lothian. James's custodians may have been giving a demonstration of royal approval to further their interests in Douglas country. This provoked a fierce response from James Douglas of Balvenie and his supporters who, at a place called Long Hermiston Muir, engaged with and killed Fleming while Orkney and James escaped to the comparative safety of the Bass Rock islet in the Firth of Forth. They endured more than a month there before boarding the France-bound Maryenknyght, a ship from Danzig. On 22 March 1406 the ship was seized, in an act of piracy, by an English vessel part-owned by the MP and royal official Hugh Fenn that resulted in James becoming the hostage of King Henry IV of England. Robert III was at Rothesay Castle when he learned of his son's capture, and he died soon after on 4 April 1406 and was buried in the Stewart foundation abbey of Paisley.|$|E
5|$|One {{of several}} ecclesiastical sources that deal {{specifically}} with Ragnall is an undated grant to the Cluniac priory at Paisley. Since this grant probably {{dates to the}} period after Ragnall's defeat to Áengus, it may be evidence of an attempt made by Ragnall to secure an alliance with Alan fitz Walter, Steward of Scotland (died 1204). The patrons of this priory were members of Alan's own family, a powerful kindred that had recently begun to expand its influence westwards from Renfrew, to the frontier of the Scottish realm and the fringes of Argyll. Since Bute seems to have fallen {{into the hands of}} this kindred at about the time of Ragnall's grant, it is possible that Alan took advantage of the internal conflict between the meic Somairle, and seized the island before 1200. Alternately, Alan may have received the island from Ragnall as payment for military support against Áengus, who appears to have gained the upper hand over Ragnall by 1192. Alan's expansion and influence in territories outwith the bounds of the Scottish kingdom may have been perceived as a threat by William I, King of Scots (died 1214), and may partly explain the king's construction of a royal castle at Ayr in 1195. This fortress extended Scottish royal authority into the outer <b>Firth</b> <b>of</b> <b>Clyde</b> region, and was probably intended to dominate not only William's peripheral barons, but also independent rulers just beyond the borders of the Scottish realm. In fact, Alan's westward expansion appears to have suddenly ceased at about 1200, and may have been a consequence of royal anxiety concerning an alliance with Ragnall.|$|E

50|$|No Roman remains {{have been}} {{discovered}} in or around the village, but it appears likely that the estuary was known and presumably used by the Romans, perhaps when the empire extended to the Antonine Wall between the <b>Firths</b> <b>of</b> Forth and <b>Clyde.</b> Ptolemy, writing in the 2nd century CE notes the river Alaunus, and the much later Ravenna Cosmography notes a place-name of Alauna. A substantial Roman fort, Alauna, was established over an 11 acre site, 9.5 mi upstream on the Aln at Learchild near Whittingham. The harbour provided by the river would have been useful to the Romans, both to support military campaigns and to facilitate trade, albeit the river is not navigable beyond Lesbury, 3.2 km upstream.|$|R
60|$|Such {{were the}} people in Alba whom we can dimly descry around Agricola's {{fortified}} frontier between the <b>firths</b> <b>of</b> Forth and <b>Clyde,</b> about 81-82 A.D.

In his battle at Mons Graupius (perhaps at the junction of Isla and Tay), his cavalry had the better of the native chariotry in the plain; and the native infantry, descending from their position on the heights, were attacked by his horsemen in their attempt to assail his rear. But they were swift of foot, the woods sheltered and the hills defended them. He made no more effectual pursuit than Cumberland did at Culloden.|$|R
