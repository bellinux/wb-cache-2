5|$|Theramenes {{remained}} a controversial figure after his death; Lysias vigorously denounced him while prosecuting {{several of his}} former political allies, but others defended his actions. Modern historical assessments have shifted over time; in the 19th century, Theramenes's part in the coup of 411 BC and his use of Arginusae were widely condemned, but newly discovered ancient texts and 20th-century scholarship supported more positive assessments. Some historians <b>have</b> <b>found</b> <b>in</b> Theramenes a selfish opportunist, others a principled moderate. The details of his actions, his motivations, and his character continue to be debated down to the present day.|$|E

25|$|In 1944 de Beauvoir {{wrote her}} first {{philosophical}} essay, Pyrrhus et Cinéas, {{a discussion of}} an existentialist ethics. She continued her exploration of existentialism through her second essay The Ethics of Ambiguity (1947); it {{is perhaps the most}} accessible entry into French existentialism. In the essay, de Beauvoir clears up some inconsistencies that many, Sartre included, <b>have</b> <b>found</b> <b>in</b> major existentialist works such as Being and Nothingness. In The Ethics of Ambiguity, de Beauvoir confronts the existentialist dilemma of absolute freedom vs. the constraints of circumstance.|$|E

25|$|Poetry has {{consistently}} {{been held in}} extremely high regard in China, often incorporating expressive folk influences filtered through the minds of Chinese literati. In Chinese culture, poetry has provided a format and a forum for {{both public and private}} expressions of deep emotion, offering an audience of peers, readers, and scholars insight into the inner life of Chinese writers across more than two millennia. Westerners also <b>have</b> <b>found</b> <b>in</b> it an interesting and pleasurable field of study, in its exemplification of essential contrasts between the Western world and Chinese civilization, and on its own terms.|$|E
25|$|Buddhism and {{the modern}} {{discipline}} of Psychology have multiple parallels and points of overlap. This includes a descriptive phenomenology of mental states, emotions and behaviors, as well as theories of perception and unconscious mental factors. Psychotherapists such as Erich Fromm <b>have</b> <b>found</b> <b>in</b> Buddhist enlightenment experiences (e.g. kensho) the potential for transformation, healing and finding existential meaning. Some contemporary mental-health practitioners such as Jon Kabat-Zinn increasingly find ancient Buddhist practices (such as the development of mindfulness) of empirically proven therapeutic value, while Buddhist teachers such as Jack Kornfield see Western Psychology as providing complementary practices for Buddhists.|$|E
25|$|Arnold was {{an outspoken}} critic of the trend towards high levels of {{abstraction}} in mathematics {{during the middle of the}} last century. He had very strong opinions on how this approach—which was most popularly implemented by the Bourbaki school in France—initially had a negative impact on French mathematical education, and then later on that of other countries as well. Arnold was very interested in the history of mathematics. In an interview, he said he had learned much of what he knew about mathematics through the study of Felix Klein's book Development of Mathematics in the 19th Century —a book he often recommended to his students. He liked to study the classics, most notably the works of Huygens, Newton and Poincaré, and many times he reported to <b>have</b> <b>found</b> <b>in</b> their works ideas that had not been explored yet.|$|E

500|$|The {{injection}} of Taylor's claim under the Fourteenth Amendment gave him grounds {{to appeal the}} decision to the U.S. Supreme Court. In a majority opinion delivered by Chief Justice Melville Fuller, the Supreme Court also rejected Taylor's claim to loss of property without due process and thus refused to intervene on Taylor's behalf, claiming that no federal issues were in question and the court lacked jurisdiction. Justices Gray, White, Shiras, and Peckham concurred with the majority opinion. Justice Joseph McKenna concurred with the decision to dismiss, but expressed reservations about the determination that an elected office was not property. Justice David J. Brewer, joined by Justice Henry B. Brown, contended that the Supreme Court did have jurisdiction, but concurred with the result in favor of Beckham. Kentuckian John Marshall Harlan authored the lone dissent from the majority opinion, claiming that the court did have jurisdiction and should <b>have</b> <b>found</b> <b>in</b> favor of Taylor based on his claim of loss of property without due process. He further argued that elective office fell under the definition of [...] "liberty" [...] as used in the Fourteenth Amendment and was protected by due process.|$|E
