25|$|The early {{advances}} in weaving had been halted {{by the lack}} of thread. The spinning process was slow and the weavers needed more cotton and wool thread than their families could produce. In the 1760s, James Hargreaves improved thread production when he invented the Spinning Jenny. By the end of the decade, Richard Arkwright had developed the water frame. This invention had two important consequences: it improved the quality of the thread, which meant that the cotton industry was no longer dependent on wool or linen to make the warp, and it took spinning away from the artisans' homes to specific locations where fast-flowing streams could provide the water power needed to drive the larger machines. The Western Pennines of Lancashire became the centre for the cotton industry. Not long after the invention of the water frame, Samuel Crompton combined the principals of the Spinning Jenny and the Water Frame to produce his Spinning Mule. This provided <b>even</b> <b>tougher</b> and finer cotton thread.|$|E

500|$|The {{following}} day (28 August), Deputy Foreign Minister of Indonesia Suwito summoned the British Charge d'Affaires {{complain that the}} British notification had been far too casual, and whilst not asking for the British to receive Indonesian permission for such an action, he asked Britain to give a more formal, preferably written, announcement next time. Or else, Suwito warned, [...] "present tension might result in an unplanned, unwanted but serious incident," [...] a statement that was quickly {{passed on to the}} British government. The Charge d'Affairs replied that any further notice would be in writing, so as not to provoke any issue. Several days later, on 2 September, the day after the Labis landings, Subandrio took an <b>even</b> <b>tougher</b> line, telling the Australian Ambassador to Jakarta that the Victorious would be refused return passage through the Strait. The motivations for such a ban are not clear, as official documents on from the time are unavailable, but Subandrio's announcement was in line with government policy on passage through Indonesian waters, which was moving towards cracking down on unauthorized passages after an American carrier group had made the voyage earlier in the month. Indonesian policy-makers was also likely worried about the threat of British air power so close to Jakarta as well as the possibility that the British were attempting to provoke a response similar to the Vietnamese had made against America during the Gulf of Tonkin incident earlier that year. The latter seems exceedingly probable given Sukarno's furious response to the incident, and it is unsurprising in such a context that the response to the British incursion was equally forceful. In any case, the pervading thought in the Indonesian command was that this was a direct retaliation to the Pontian landings and a signal of British resolve, which although worrying could not overtake the British violation of their nautical claims in importance.|$|E
500|$|Although the eponymous Baker {{brothers}} are the default {{stars of the}} film, Susie {{is considered to be}} the film's [...] "centerpiece". Film critic Mike D'angelo, writing for The Dissolve, observed that [...] "the character's name is Susie Diamond, and she's written like a woman named Susie Diamond, and Pfeiffer plays her ... like a woman named Susie Diamond." [...] As a romantic film, The Fabulous Baker Boys focuses on [...] "the unfulfilled longing between" [...] bandmates Susie and Jack. Susie is the only woman capable of changing [...] "the aloof, uncommunicative Jack... by throwing incendiary tantrums and sounding <b>even</b> <b>tougher</b> than he does", slowly inspiring the pianist to change the person he has allowed himself to become. Rolling Stones Peter Travers believes that Susie and Jack bond because both characters are [...] "losers who've sold themselves on the cheap"; Jack is a skilled musician who despises himself for squandering his talent, which reminds former escort Susie of herself. Pfeiffer agreed that her character essentially becomes [...] "a mirror image for Jack" [...] although both remain very different individuals. While Jack is depicted as timid and cautious about his decisions, Susie rather [...] "embraces life" [...] instead. An adventurous individual, Susie refuses to do only one thing, including perform, for her entire life. Pfeiffer observed that although her character has spent a significant portion of her life as an escort, she remains less of a [...] "whore" [...] than Jack because she retains her individuality, while Jack [...] "has ceased to be a vital human being." [...] When Susie and Jack have their final argument, the profanity Jack uses actually helps establish Susie as the stronger character, according to Mark R. Hasan of KQEK.com. Susie's nicknames for her bandmates reveal exactly how she feels about both brothers individually; while she refers to Frank as [...] "Egghead" [...] because of his growing bald spot and tendency to act unintelligent at times, she calls Jack simply [...] "Baker" [...] because, in her opinion, [...] "there's really only one Baker brother and he's it." [...] The way Susie teases Frank is reminiscent of how Jack used to treat him several years before she joined the band when he had energy to do it.|$|E
500|$|The European {{sovereign}} debt crisis was another important {{issue in the}} election, even more so after Portugal applied for an EU bailout on 6 April, {{the first day of}} advance voting. According to an opinion poll nearly 60% of Finns were against Finland's participation in bailing out the crisis-ridden countries. All four parties of the governing coalition (Centre Party, National Coalition Party, Green League and the Swedish People's Party) support Finland's participation in the bailout and all four opposition parties (Social Democrats, Left Alliance, Christian Democrats and the True Finns) oppose such measures. The issue helped Soini become the most visible opposition leader. Soini then also stated that his party would not join in any coalition that supports guarantees to the crisis-ridden EU countries. He said that their crises are a consequence of the EU's failure. Finance Minister Jyrki Katainen had commented that a bailout for Portugal should only happen if the Portuguese parliament passed <b>even</b> <b>tougher</b> austerity measures than the failed programme that led to an early Portuguese election: [...] "The package must be really strict because otherwise it doesn't make any sense. The package must be harder and more comprehensive than the one the parliament voted against." [...] Despite his comments, the National Coalition Party believed the bailout to be in Finland's interests. It, along with the Centre Party, supported the bailout under the EU's auspices, while the True Finns and the Social Democrats were opposed to it. The True Finns said that Finnish taxpayers were being unjustly burdened by [...] "squanderers" [...] within the eurozone and pointed out that no one aided Finland during its own financial crisis in the 1990s. Helsingin Sanomat read the affair as having added [...] "confusion" [...] and complexity to the electoral race. The effect of the Finnish election on a possible EU bailout caused concern amongst to international investors as [...] "it is a very distinct possibility that the next government and parliament of Finland will not want to agree to the things that the current government has signed up for, namely supporting Portugal and agreeing to the permanent and temporary crisis mechanisms," [...] as there was said to be an [...] "even chance" [...] of Finland blocking a bailout for Portugal as its support was crucial because it would need the unanimous support of all national governments to pass. Finland's participation was further thrown in doubt as it was the only eurozone country to require parliamentary approval of any such measure. Should a new Finnish administration opt out of the bailout, this could throw into doubt the eurozone's capacity to maintain financial stability.|$|E
