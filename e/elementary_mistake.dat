In addition, uniform priors on the real line, or even normal distributions with mean zero and huge variances, say very silly things, for example, that the parameters are far from zero with high probability. In a logistic regression, such priors induce prior probabilities for events that are concentrated about 50 % near zero and about 50 % near one (Seaman, Seaman, and Stamey 2012). Pretty stupid. The only advantage to such priors is that they might be easily overwhelmed by data. My advice is to check the implications of one’s prior, uniform or otherwise. 6. CONCLUSIONS The state of Bayesian statistics in the twenty-first century is strong. Bayesian statistics provides relatively simple tools to address the increasingly complex models that modern technology and concerns have brought to the fore. But the history of Bayesian methodology was difficult in the twentieth century. It is desirable for us to know where Bayesian statistics has been, not only where Bayesian statistics is going. It is useful for us to know the scientific and philosophical basis for Bayesian statistics, not only the techniques that allow its application. Deborah G. MAYO 1...|$|E

A canonical empiricist like Locke goes {{out of his way to}} state that their project to investigate and articulate the ‘logic of ideas’ is not a scientific project: “I shall not at present meddle with the Physical consideration of the Mind” (Essay, I. i. 2). An equally prominent thinker, Immanuel Kant, seems to make an <b>elementary</b> <b>mistake,</b> given such a clear statement, when he claims that Locke’s project was a “physiology of the understanding,” in the Preface to the A edition of the first Critique). A first question, then, would be: what is this physiology of the understanding, if it was not Locke’s project? Did anyone undertake such a project? If not, what would it have resembled? My second and related case comes out of a remark the Hieronymus Gaub makes in a letter to Charles Bonnet of 1761 : criticizing materialist accounts of mind and mind-body relations such as La Mettrie’s, Gaub suggests that what is needed is a thorough study of the “mechanics of the soul,” and that Bonnet could write such a study. What is the mechanics of the soul, especially given that it is presented as a non-materialist project? To what extent does it resemble the purported “physiology of the understanding”? And more generally, what do both of these phantom projects have to do with a process we might describe as a ‘naturalization of the soul’...|$|E

In sharp contrast to previously reported ambiguities (by up to a factor 8), Schuermann et al. suggest an accuracy of 12 %. We demonstrate that the so claimed "rigorous data selection criteria" used by Schuermann et al. relies on the s-factors extracted by Assuncao et al. But these results were shown in a later analysis (by this author) to have large error bars (considerably larger than claimed by Assuncao em et al.) which render these data not appropriate for a rigorous analysis. When their "rigorous data selection" is adjusted to remove the results of Assuncao et al. the astrophysical cross section factor cannot be extracted with 12 % accuracy, or even close to it. Such data on the S_E 2 values at low energies deviate by up to a factor two from their fit and exhibit a sharper slope rising toward low energies, leading to strong doubt on their extrapolated S_E 2 (300) value and the quoted small error bar. Contrary to their claim the small value of S_E 1 (300) ~ 10 keVb cannot be ruled out by current data including the most modern gamma-ray data. As previously observed by several authors current data reveal ambiguities {{in the value of}} S_E 1 (300) ~ 10 keVb or ~ 80 keVb, and the new ambiguity that was recently revealed (by this author) of S_E 2 (300) ~ 60 keVb or ~ 154 keVb, appear to be a more reasonable evaluation the status of current data.

The system employs workers that, through performing given jobs, enter into relationships with persons in emergency situations; such situations require special procedures among which you can find negotiating. The thesis at hand describes how negotiating strategies are applied in the negotiation process. It delivers {{an assessment of the}} current state of negotiating strategies among the employees of the IRS bodies, especially the level of their awareness of using such negotiating strategies in emergency negotiations with aggressive persons and persons demonstrating suicide intents. The thesis examines the frequency at which the IRS employees must face emergency situations that involve emergency negotiations, and it identifies {{the extent to which these}} officers are ready to cope with such situations. Subsequently, the thesis compares strategies employed in negotiations pursued from operations centres and those pursued while carrying out the duties under normal circumstances and in emergency situations; with regard to the individual IRS bodies. The thesis discusses the development of these strategies concerning the development of the society and culture. Through quantitative research based on questionnaires and additional interviews with negotiators-specialists, the thesis examines practical knowledge of the topic among the members of the IRS bodies when it comes to application of negotiating strategies. The target research group comprised of the IRS employees proportionally representing the Police of the Czech Republic, Fire Rescue Service, and Emergency Medical Service in the Region of South Bohemia. The outcome of the thesis shows that the members of the IRS bodies, except the police negotiators, do not have any significant experience with negotiating as a particular activity.

40|$|This is {{a conference}} paper. This paper {{describes}} our experiences with authoring and trialling questions in advanced calculus topics, namely ordinary differential equations, Laplace transforms and Fourier series. These topics are generally {{taught at the}} end of the first year or during the second year of a mathematics or engineering undergraduate degree. We expect that many of the lessons learned here will apply to other conceptually-advanced mathematical and scientific content. Typically, what is significant for such content is that many skills are needed from previous exposure to calculus and algebra, and that paper-based questions at this level tend to be more abstract, holistic and open-ended, requiring the sort of flexibility in marking generally associated with human markers. For objective, and therefore more constrained questions, we do not know what is feasible and whether or not questions on advanced topics will actually test the skills they are designed to test. For example, a student may carry out e. g. a Laplace transform correctly, but make an <b>elementary</b> algebraic <b>mistake</b> near the end; this would be easily recognised by a human marker, but simply marked wrong by any current CAA system which cannot assess the (generally handwritten) intermediate steps in a student’s solution. Conversely, any question that can be marked by a CAA system is likely to be structured or scaffolded (e. g. by asking for intermediate steps explicitly) so that the original requirement on the student to devise a solution strategy is lost. This paper explores what can be asked effectively: facility with such questions is a necessary (but not sufficient) condition for students to master more advanced topics, so some sort of blended assessment (with human markers) may still be needed for higher-level skills. We describe the process of authoring higher-level objective and report of the experience of running the questions with our second year cohort, including an analysis of the answer files produced. Our evidence suggests that the assessments were useful to students in establishing a solid foundation of skills, mainly by being encouraged, or even forced, to engage with the extensive feedback screens...|$|R
