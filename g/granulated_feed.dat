40|$|It is well {{established}} that reproduction is sensitive {{to the state of}} energy reserves, {{and that there is a}} balance between energy homeostasis and fertility. In this view, this study examined the effects of different diets on growth and reproductive performance of fresh water angelfish. Twenty four pairs of angelfish (weighing 3. 58 ± 0. 24 g) were fed with four types of diets including live earth worm (LEW), dried Tubifex (DT), dried Gammarus (DG) and prepared <b>granulated</b> <b>feed</b> (PGF), twice a day for 90 days. Reproductive parameters were measured between days 60 and 90. The significant increase in the gonadosomatic index (GSI), fecundity and hatchability brought about by the LEW were demonstrated by the higher number of spawned eggs and hatched larvae. The best growth observed significantly in PGF, and length of larvae was enhanced in this group, consequently. The numbers of dead and deformed fry were lower in the fish fed with PGF and LEW, but there was no significant difference among experimental groups. This study showed that breeders benefit from inclusion of prepared <b>granulated</b> <b>feed</b> and living earth worm during their growth and reproductive stages, and simultaneous using of them for achieving better results is suggested...|$|E

We watched efficiency of substances to growth and mortality of larvae of Siberian sturgeon. The larvae were kept in aquariums (18), which {{were divided into two}} groups. One of them was fed by artemia one week and five weeks by dry <b>granulated</b> <b>feed</b> and the second was fed by artemia three weeks and three weeks by dry <b>granulated</b> <b>feed.</b> Then all of aquariums were divided into three and three groups (three aquariums for one group), which was fed by artemia enriched by different substances (group without enrichment-control, group enriched with preparation DHA and a third group was enriched with preparation Spresso). For proper breeding we had the temperature of water at 20 °C+. After regular measurement of temperature in the morning and in the evening were measured average values morning x= 22, 4 °C and average values evening s = 22. 9 ° C. The attempt proved double growth in the group which was fed by artemia one week, but at the expense of higher mortality. The group which was fed by Artemia enriched by product Spresso showed in both groups the best growth and weight characteristics. In conclusion we can say that the enrichment by product Spresso is better than feeding by artemia without enrichment...|$|E
40|$|The {{topic of}} this diploma work was to {{evaluate}} the hematological and biochemical indicators of various breeds of dogs. The aim of this work was {{to evaluate the}} blood samples taken from 10 dogs and 10 bitches of various breeds and find out the dependency of values {{in relation to their}} age, nutrition and sex. The samples were processed and evaluated from May to October 2015. The following was examined from the hematological indicators: RBC, HGB, HCT, MCV, WBC and a blood smear was made, from which a differential count of leucocytes was made. Furthermore, the following biochemical indicators were examined: TP, GLU, CHOL and ATP. The literature research first focused on the basic components of dog feed. Moreover, the hematological and biochemical indicators of blood as well as the methodology of the whole experiment were described. The results were processed with the aid of the RStudio program and the following basic statistical characteristics were counted: median, minimum, maximum and standard deviation. The ANOVA statistical method was used, in which the dependency of values among sex, age category and the type of feed fed to the animals was determined. Furthermore, the values among the breeds were compared. From the differences observed among the breeds, there was an increase in red blood cells in German Shepherds and Dobermans. Dobermans, Labrador Retrievers and German shepherd crossbreeds had increased values of ALT. Significant findings showed that there was {{an increase in the number}} of red blood cells and hematocrits in subjects fed with <b>granulated</b> <b>feed</b> as opposed to subjects with a combined diet. The difference was also observed for MCV between the genders. Differences between the genders were found for ALT values. More data would be needed to confirm the relationship to age. ALT values are dependent on the type of feed, where the values are higher in subjects fed with a completely granulated diet. The values of total protein increased in dogs with age. This trend is likely to be observed in bitches. For subjects fed a combined diet (<b>granulated</b> <b>feed</b> + home diet) an increase in the value of total protein was observed with age.

Transmission electron microscopy (TEM) was used to monitor the translocation of bacterial pathogens which can enter the host through the gut. A total of 260 samples from larvae at different feeding stages were examined, 15 healthy and 50 moribund juvenile dentex were sampled over a 2 -year period. Bacterial isolates (n= 433) from healthy and moribund fish and their environments were identified by biochemical methods; 75 % of them were identified as Gram-negative (mainly Vibrio spp.) and 25 % as Gram-positive. Vibrio scophthalmi and other Vibrio species were recovered from moribund fish samples. Some bacteria were recovered from diseased fish reared in hatcheries, introduced mainly from sea water. Among anaerobic bacteria, Eubacterium tarantellae was recovered from larval gut flora while Clostridium botulinum was recovered from juvenile gut flora. TEM also showed that bacterial endocytosis first occurs when fish are fed <b>granulated</b> dry <b>feeds</b> and becomes more prevalent in the juvenile stages when many bacteria are present in the microvilli. TEM also revealed that the bacteria enter the larvae via the mouth and gills before the <b>granulated</b> <b>feeding</b> stage, after which they begin to penetrate the gut and finally also contaminate the marine rearing stage.

In this study, the efficiency of eight different methods for DNA isolation was investigated. For DNA extraction, the raw chicken meet, ham, sausages, tinned lunch meat, pate, tinned feeds for dogs, complete <b>granulated</b> <b>feeds</b> for dogs and chicken flour were used. Kits of several different producers, i. e. : NucleoSpin Food (Marchery-Nagel), Wizard Genomic DNA Purification Kit (Promega), Invisorb Spin Food Kit I (Invitek), Wizard SV Genomic DNA Purification System (Promega), JetQuick Tissue DNA Spin Kit (Genomed), RNA Blue (Top-Bio), JetQuick Blood & Cell Culture Kit (Genomed), QIAamp DNA Mini Kit and QIAamp DNA Blood Mini Kit (Qiagen) were employed in the study. Gel agarose electrophoresis for primary verification of DNA quality was performed. The isolates were subsequently assessed for quantity and quality using by spectrophotometer Nanodrop 2000 (Thermo Scientific). To verify of template usability and quality of isolated DNA, the polymerase chain reaction (PCR) was used. Differences between isolated DNA from tinned products and meat, ham, sausage, <b>granulated</b> dog <b>feed</b> and chicken flour were found. In tinned food and feed, the DNA was more degraded, DNA content and DNA purity was lower and also PCR amplification was the most difficult.

40|$|Purpose. To study some morphometric parameters, {{protein and}} {{lysozyme}} content in organs and serum in several sturgeon species reared in aquiculture at {{the ages of}} 3, 8 and 18 months, and to investigate the specific and age distribution of lysozyme in fish organs. Methodology. For the experiments we used sturgeon species of different age groups reared in the fish farm «Fortuna XXI» located in the Galerny Gulf of the Dіnprо river. The study objects were: bester (Huso huso×Acipenser ruthenus), age of 3, 8 and 18 months; Russian sturgeon (Acipenser gueldenstaedtii), age of 3 months, Siberian sturgeon (A. baeri) and sterlet (A. ruthenus), age of 8 month. Following morphometric parameters were determined in the studied fish: weight (g), length (cm), absolute weight of liver, kidneys, spleen (mg), condition factor and relative weight (index, ‰) of organs. The lysozyme content was determined in serum and extracts of the tissues of fish organs by a diffusion method on the agar and protein content was determined by Louri's method. Findings. We detected significant differences in morphometric parameters, protein and lysozyme content in organs and serum of 3 -month bester and Russian sturgeon as well as specific differences of relative organ weight, protein and lysozyme levels in organs and serum of 8 -month Siberian sturgeon, bester and sterlet. A comparison of the investigated parameters in 3, 8 and 18 -month bester showed {{an increase in the}} condition factor with fish growth, significant changes of protein content in fish of different age groups, high level of lysozyme in kidneys and serum of 18 -month fish, redistribution of lysozyme contents in fish organs depending on age. Originality. First comparison of several morphophysiological parameters of 3, 8, 18 -month sturgeon species (sterlet, Russian sturgeon, Siberian sturgeon, bester) reared in aquiculture. Practical value. Taking into account the high commercial value of sturgeon species, the conducted studies showed that in the conditions of cage culture with the use of live and high quality <b>granulated</b> <b>feeds,</b> juveniles and age 2 commodity sturgeons maintain the high level of general nonspecific immunity inherent to sturgeon species living in natural conditions...|$|R

40|$|The {{effects of}} grains, {{pelleted}} and extruded {{feed on the}} fatty acid content in carp meat has not been examined yet. In this work, we present evidence that the high carbohydrate content in all three types of feed causes oleic acid to predominate in all meat samples. A higher PUFA content in the meat of fish fed with <b>granulated</b> <b>feed</b> was detected. The extruded feed diet led to 69 % greater n- 3, and 53 % lower n- 6 fatty acid contents. Their ratio is thus 2. 64 -fold higher than in meat of carp fed with pelleted feed. A higher content of n- 3 fatty acids in fish fed with extruded feed was the consequence of higher DHA (1. 6 times) and EPA (3. 3 times) contents. The detected differences could be the consequence of the thermal treatment of extruded feed that makes the proteins, carbohydrates and lipids more accessible to fish than in a pelleted feed.

40|$|Abstract. In this paper, we {{approached}} a research theme regarding {{the effects of}} Sea-buckthorn (Hippophae rhamnoides L.) upon the growth {{and development of the}} common carp (Cyprinus carpio) in aquarium conditions. In this sense, there were organized 3 lots, each lot containing 25 individuals, weighting between 7. 27 and 16. 01 g. Feeding occurred with <b>granulated</b> <b>feed,</b> having a protein level of 26 %, the only difference between the lots was represented by the percentage of the added Sea-buckthorn, which was in the first case 1 % and in the second one 2 %, compared to the control lot, without Sea-buckthorn. During the 120 days of this experiment, we monitorised the dynamic of the body weight, accumulation of body mass, average daily gain and the survival rate. The fish breeding was carried out in aquariums, each with a total capacity of 500 l, and controlled medial conditions the only difference between the lots was the addition of Sea-buckthorn regarding the feed system. The results obtained during this experiment, prove the opportunity and the actuality of this research theme, and the positive impact of the Sea-buckthorn upon the growth of the common carp.

40|$|The {{objective}} {{of this research was}} to determine the effect of breed, feed type and sex, on the final body weight in New Zealand white and Blanc de Termonde rabbits. The experiment was conducted on a farm in the Małopolska Province in the south of Poland. Rabbits of both breeds were kept in identical conditions up to the age of 90 days. However, they were fed using two different methods – with commercial balanced (<b>granulated)</b> <b>feed</b> (9. 75 MJ, 155 g protein) and farm-made feed (9. 54 MJ, 157 g protein). Among New Zealand White rabbits, commercial balanced feed was given to 38 males and 42 females, whereas farm-made feed to 37 males and 38 females. Among Blanc de Termonde rabbits, commercial balanced feed was given to 65 males and 68 females, and farm-made feed to 54 males and 60 females. Daily gains were determined for both examined breeds divided into sexes. Then, we calculated interactions between breed and feed type, between breed and sex, as well as between feed type and sex. The mean body weights on the 90 th day of fattening differed for both sexes and feed types. For both rabbit breeds, the higher mean final body weight was observed in case of feeding with the commercial balanced feed, whereas the highest body weight (2515. 13 g) was registered for the females of Blanc de Termonde rabbits...|$|E
40|$|A new {{technique}} {{for measuring the}} voidage of a packed bed of wet deformable granules is described. Rather than attempt to measure voidage in situ, the voidage is calculated from accurate measurements of bed bulk density and separate measurement of granule apparent density by kerosene displacement. The technique is reproducible to ± 0. 005 void fraction. This technique is used to study in detail the factors which determine the voidage of packed beds of <b>granulated</b> ferrous sinter <b>feed.</b> 10 sinter feed blends are used varying the type of ore (7 ores), feed size distribution and moisture content (3. 5 % to 8 %). As moisture content increases, bed voidage passes through a maximum. At low moisture contents, added water reduces {{the spread of the}} granule size distribution and increases the voidage. At higher moisture contents, granule deformation becomes important. Granules become more deformable as moisture content increases and the bed voidage drops. The key parameter which affects granule deformation is the granule layer mass to nuclei mass ratio (R). All blends show the same relationship between R and voidage. Voidage decreases with increasing R before approaching an asymptotic value for large values of R. The effect of feed particle size distribution, moisture holding capacity and moisture content on voidage can be explained by their effect on the layer mass to nuclei mass ratio during granulation. Hence, {{with the aid of a}} suitable granulation model, the effect of feed blend properties and granulation conditions on bed voidage can be predicted...|$|R

Imports of frogs' legs have been increasing over the last few decades in relation to the development of deep-frozen products. This demand has stimulated farming with neotropical species for international trade. Today, in spite of some trials on European species, no production is effective. From the early 1990 s, small-scale experimental rearing trials have been undertaken in Brittany (France) with a local green frog belonging to the esculenta complex (Rana ridibunda) which accepts <b>granulated</b> <b>feed.</b> This complex comprises two Mendelian species R. lessonae (LL) and R. ridibunda (RR) as well as their hybridogenetic hybrid Rana esculenta, which can be either diploid (RL) or triploid (RLL, RRL). The {{purpose of this study is}} to analyse the ability of each taxon to be reared. During the two months following metamorphosis, froglets were trained to eat pellets. The surviving individuals were reared for one year under regulated conditions to estimate the survival rate, growth and production of each frog type. The results show low survival rates (14. 8 to 26. 2 %) for LL and RLL, higher rates (39 – 46. 4 %) for F 1 and F 2 from wild RR and RLL, with the highest rates (63. 0 to 77. 4 %) for RL, RRL and all RR, using data from several years of rearing. After three years under rearing conditions, the adult survival rate is highest for rearing strain RRRivan 92 * (53. 7 %). The growth rate varies greatly according to phenotype, and only frogs with an RR phenotype reach marketable size. In the wild, LL exhibits some difficulty in reaching this limit. As a result, production increases from 1. 5 – 8. 7 kg/m 2 for individuals with an L hemiclone to 22. 9 – 35. 7 kg/m 2 for each cohort of phenotype RR from at least two generations under rearing conditions. In relation to hybridogenesis processes, hybrids with diploid or triploid genomes do not seem to offer any advantage for production purposes. However, R. lessonae individuals from intensive rearing can produce fertile eggs and tadpoles, which could enable production for restocking to preserve wild diversity or build up new populations in suitable habitats...|$|E
40|$|Purpose. To {{investigate}} {{the effect of}} increased amounts of vitamin A in the diet on the fatty acid composition of esterified cholesterol of liver and reproduction ability of brood carp females and males. Methodology. The experiment was conducted in pre-spawning period using three groups of brood carp. The control group of carp received standard <b>granulated</b> <b>feed.</b> Experimental groups of brood carps additionally received retynilatsetat {{in the composition of}} the above-mentioned fodder. Findings. It was found that the liver of females and males of brood carp of experimental groups, which received vitamin A at a quantity of 2500 and 5000 IU/kg of feed in the composition of standard granulated formulated feed during pre-spawning period had shown a dose-dependent reduction in the content of esterified cholesterol. At the same time, the level of monounsaturated fatty acids of n- 9 family decreases significantly and dose-dependently in its fatty acid composition, however, there is an increase in the level of saturated fatty acids with paired and unpaired quantities of carbon atoms in the chain as well as polyunsaturated fatty acids of n- 6 family and especially n- 3 family. Females of brood carp in the experimental groups, which were fed with additional vitamin A at a quantity of 2500 and 5000 IU/kg of standard granulated formulated feed during pre-spawning period, had an increase in working and relative fecundity, while males had an increase in sperm volume. At the same time, the output of larvae from eggs increases significantly and dose-dependently. Originality. For the first time {{it was found that the}} liver of brood carp females and males, which received increased quantities of vitamin A in the composition of standard granulated formulated feed during pre-spawning period, had the reduction in the content of esterified cholesterol. the level of monounsaturated fatty acids of n- 9 family decreases significantly and dose-dependently in its fatty acid composition, however, there is an increase in the level of saturated fatty acids with paired and unpaired quantities of carbon atoms in the chain as well as polyunsaturated fatty acids of n- 6 family and especially n- 3 family. Females of brood carp in the experimental groups, which were fed with additional vitamin A at a quantity of 2500 and 5000 IU/kg of standard granulated formulated feed during pre-spawning period, had an increase in working and relative fecundity, while males had an increase in sperm volume. At the same time, the output of larvae from eggs increases significantly and dose-dependently. Practical value. The content of esterified cholesterol and its acid composition in the liver of females and males of brood carp directly correlates with their reproductive ability. In particular, the liver of females of brood carp, which had a reduction in the content of esterified cholesterol and an increase in the level of polyunsaturated fatty acids in its fatty acid composition, had of an increased working and relative fecundity, while males had an increase in sperm volume. At the same time, th output of larvae from eggs increases...|$|E
