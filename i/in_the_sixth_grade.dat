5|$|In {{the public}} school system of Baltimore city, music {{education}} is a part of each grade level to high school, at which point it becomes optional. Beginning in first grade, or approximately six years old, Baltimore students begin to learn about melody, harmony and rhythm, and are taught to echo short melodic and rhythmic patterns. They also begin to learn about different musical instruments and distinguish between different kinds of sounds and types of songs. As students progress through the grades, teachers go into more detail and require more proficiency in elementary musical techniques. Students perform rounds in second grade, for example, while movement (i.e. dance) enters the curriculum in third grade. Beginning in middle school <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>sixth</b> <b>grade,</b> students are taught to make mature aesthetic judgements, and to understand and respond to a variety of forms of music. In high school, students may choose to take courses in instrumentation or singing, and may be exposed to music {{in other areas of the}} curriculum, such as in theater or drama classes.|$|E
5|$|Maho is Shuichi's sister. She is {{one year}} older than Shuichi is, and at the {{beginning}} of Wandering Son, she is <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>sixth</b> <b>grade</b> of elementary school. Maho shows a strong interest in clothes, and spends much of her money on new apparel. She is a big fan of a teen fashion model named Maiko, and to meet her, Maho auditions for the same modeling agency as Maiko. After she is hired and becomes recognized as a model, Maho enjoys being asked her autograph by complete strangers. While her modeling career initially starts out slowly, Maho soon gains confidence in her abilities, and becomes friends with Maiko and two other models, Anna Suehiro and Tamaki Satō. In contrast to her younger sibling, Maho is very out-spoken and tends to be rough with Shuichi, even hitting or slapping Shuichi on occasion, and she often forces things on Shuichi with little consideration of Shuichi's opinion. She does not like Shuichi's cross-dressing and gets angry and disturbed when she finds Shuichi dressed as a girl. In junior high school, Maho becomes attracted to her classmate Riku Seya, and eventually starts dating him.|$|E

40|$|Graduation date: 1977 Purpose of the Study: The {{purpose of}} this {{investigation}} was to measure some of the effects of an elementary science program, the Science Curriculum Improvement Study (SCIS) on science achievement of certain <b>sixth</b> <b>grade</b> students. Important to the problem was how the SCIS students compared with students exposed to a second elementary science program, Experiences in Science (EIS). Design of the Study: <b>The</b> subjects included <b>in</b> <b>the</b> study were <b>sixth</b> <b>grade</b> students enrolled <b>in</b> <b>the</b> Corvallis Intermediate schools or the Albany Elementary schools during the 1975 - 76 school year. There was a total of 506 students <b>in</b> <b>the</b> Corvallis population and 324 students comprising the Albany group. The Corvallis students were considered the experimental group and were exposed to the SCIS program during the treatment period. <b>The</b> Albany <b>sixth</b> <b>grade</b> students were exposed to the EIS program and constituted the control group. Student assignment to the various schools and classes was determined by school attendance boundaries and computerized scheduling. The elementary battery of the Analysis of Learning Potential (ALP) was administered prior to the treatment period as a group equivalent indicator. The science sub-test of the Comprehensive Tests of Basic Skills (CTBS), Level 2, Form 5, was administered as a pre- and post-test during the first and fourth quarters of the school year. Findings of the Study The findings of the study are presented <b>in</b> terms of <b>the</b> two major hypotheses tested. There will be {{no significant difference between the}} H₀₁ mean scores of the SCIS group as taught <b>in</b> <b>the</b> Corvallis <b>sixth</b> <b>grade</b> as compared with the EIS group as taught <b>in</b> <b>the</b> Albany <b>sixth</b> <b>grade.</b> Hypothesis 1 was retained. There was no significant difference between the CTBS mean scores of the experimental and control groups. H₀₂: There will be no significant difference between the mean scores of the SCIS group as taught <b>in</b> <b>the</b> Cheldelin, Highland View and Western View <b>sixth</b> <b>grade</b> as compared with the EIS group as taught <b>in</b> <b>the</b> Albany <b>sixth</b> <b>grade.</b> Hypothesis 2 was retained. There was no significant difference between the CTBS mean scores of the Cheldelin, Highland View or Western View populations as compared with the Albany control group. Conclusions of the Study: 1. There was no significant difference <b>in</b> <b>the</b> science achievement of the students exposed to <b>the</b> SCIS program <b>in</b> <b>the</b> Corvallis <b>sixth</b> <b>grade</b> as compared with the students exposed to <b>the</b> EIS program <b>in</b> <b>the</b> Albany <b>sixth</b> <b>grade.</b> 2. There was no significant difference <b>in</b> <b>the</b> science achievement of <b>the</b> <b>sixth</b> <b>grade</b> students <b>in</b> <b>the</b> SCIS program at Cheldelin, Highland View or Western View Intermediate schools, as compared with <b>the</b> <b>sixth</b> <b>grade</b> students <b>in</b> <b>the</b> Albany EIS program. Recommendations for Further Study: 1. This investigation covered a time span of approximately 29 weeks. Lingitudinal studies are recommended that would investigate students' retention of outcomes and learnings as they may influence achievement in other science areas. 2. Although the SCIS program has been a part of the Corvallis elementary school curriculum for some time, it was not recommended for use in all <b>sixth</b> <b>grade</b> classrooms until <b>the</b> 1975 - 76 school year. It is recommended that a future study be carried out to determine the effectiveness of the program after it has been more thoroughly implemented into <b>the</b> <b>sixth</b> <b>grade.</b> 3. <b>The</b> literature reveals several studies dealing with the effects of the SCIS program on achievement in other areas. It is recommended that a study of this nature be carried out at the local level. 4. This study placed a heavy emphasis on the significance of Piaget's philosophies <b>in</b> <b>the</b> development of the SCIS and EIS programs. It is recommended that further studies investigate the importance of an understanding of Piaget's theories to good teaching...|$|R
