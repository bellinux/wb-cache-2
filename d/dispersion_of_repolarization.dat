50|$|Approximately 20% of {{the cases}} of Brugada {{syndrome}} {{have been shown to}} be associated with mutations in a gene that encodes for a sodium ion channel in the cell membranes of the muscle cells of the heart (the myocytes); this is often referred to as a sodium channelopathy. The majority of patients affected by Brugada syndrome are not found to have known genetic mutations to explain the disease, as of 2015. The gene, named SCN5A, is located on the short arm of the third chromosome (3p21). Loss-of-function mutations in this gene lead to a loss of the action potential dome of some epicardial areas of the right ventricle. This results in transmural and epicardial <b>dispersion</b> <b>of</b> <b>repolarization.</b> The transmural dispersion underlies ST-segment elevation and the development of a vulnerable window across the ventricular wall, whereas the epicardial <b>dispersion</b> <b>of</b> <b>repolarization</b> facilitates the development of phase 2 reentry, which generates a phase 2 reentrant extrasystole that captures the vulnerable window to precipitate ventricular tachycardia and/or ventricular fibrillation that often results in sudden cardiac death. At present time however, all the reported patients who died because of the disease and were submitted to detailed autopsy study have shown a structural right ventricular pathology underlying the syndrome.|$|E

40|$|BACKGROUND: The {{concept that}} the {{interval}} between the peak (T(peak)) and the end (T(end)) of the T wave (T(p-e)) {{is a measure of}} transmural <b>dispersion</b> <b>of</b> <b>repolarization</b> time is widely accepted but has not been tested rigorously by transmural mapping of the intact heart. OBJECTIVES: The {{purpose of this study was}} to test the relationship of T(p-e) to transmural <b>dispersion</b> <b>of</b> <b>repolarization</b> by correlating local repolarization times at endocardial, midmural, and epicardial sites in the left and right ventricles with the T wave of the ECG. METHODS: Local activation times, activation-recovery intervals, and repolarization times were measured at 98 epicardial sites and up to 120 midmural and endocardial sites in eight open-chest dogs. In four of the dogs, long-term cardiac memory was induced by 3 weeks of ventricular pacing at 130 bpm because previous data suggest that, in this setting, delayed epicardial repolarization increases transmural dispersion. The other four dogs were sham operated. RESULTS: In sham dogs, T(p-e) was 41 +/- 2. 2 ms (X +/- SEM), whereas the transmural <b>dispersion</b> <b>of</b> <b>repolarization</b> time was 2. 7 +/- 4. 2 ms (not significant between endocardium and epicardium). Cardiac memory was associated with evolution of a transmural gradient of 14. 5 +/- 1. 9 ms (P <. 02), with epicardium repolarizing later than endocardium. The corresponding T(p-e) was 43 +/- 2. 3 ms (not different from sham). In combined sham and memory dogs, T(p-e) intervals did not correlate with transmural <b>dispersion</b> <b>of</b> <b>repolarization</b> times. In contrast, <b>dispersion</b> <b>of</b> <b>repolarization</b> of the whole heart (measured as the difference between the earliest and the latest moment of repolarization from all left and right ventricular, endocardial, intramural, and epicardial recording sites) did correlate with T(p-e) (P <. 0005, r = 0. 98), although the latter underestimated total repolarization time by approximately 35 %. The explanation for this finding is that parts of the heart fully repolarize before the moment of T(peak).

40|$|<b>Dispersion</b> <b>of</b> <b>repolarization</b> time (or {{recovery}} time) {{is known}} to be pro-arrhythmic, but not much is known about the rate-dependency of dispersion in repolarization time. The aim of this thesis was to investigate how heterogeneity in structure and function influence the <b>dispersion</b> <b>of</b> <b>repolarization</b> time following normal and premature beats in simulated human left ventricular tissue. The modelling tools were (1) geometrical models of tissue and fibre; (2) two cell models including a simple and a biophysically detailed human ventricular cell models; and (3) a monodomain model of ventricular tissue. During decreasing stimulus (S 1 S 2) intervals, dispersion in repolarization time remained constant for normal beats while changed greatly for premature beats. In 2 D tissue with structural discontinuities and no fibre orientation, the structural discontinuity was found to produce increased <b>dispersion</b> <b>of</b> <b>repolarization,</b> and slowing of propagation in the region between two structural discontinuities. In 3 D tissue with functional heterogeneity (including a linear or a non-linear change in fibre orientation), the <b>dispersion</b> <b>of</b> <b>repolarization</b> time produced at different S 1 S 2 intervals depended on the differences in local restitution. Thus longer S 1 S 2 intervals could produce greater <b>dispersion</b> <b>of</b> <b>repolarization</b> time than shorter S 1 S 2 intervals. Speed of depolarization conduction was also depended on the differences in local restitution. Therefore, combination of anisotropy and fibrosis could suppress the speed of depolarization conduction for premature beats in the mid-myocardial region of heterogeneous tissues composed of three ventricular cell types. The results suggest that 3 D cubes of anisotropic fibrosis heterogeneous tissue may promote tissue vulnerably to ventricular arrhythmia. In an anatomically detailed left ventricular wedge with functional heterogeneity, long and short S 1 S 2 intervals could produce greater <b>dispersion</b> <b>of</b> <b>repolarization</b> time than 3 D cubes of tissues. These simulations have implications for our understanding of arrhythmias in the whole heart. Restitution profiles of repolarization time and profiles of dispersion in repolarization time (not action potential duration) may be used for estimating abnormal changes in repolarization time of premature beats and arrhythmia risk. ...|$|E

To {{establish}} {{a set of}} reference values for regional <b>dispersion</b> <b>of</b> <b>repolarization</b> of the right atrium in the in situ heart of pigs and {{to see if the}} global <b>dispersion</b> <b>of</b> <b>repolarization</b> could be estimated from regional mapping. Design. Monophasic action potential (MAP) were sequentially recorded from 28 Â± 3 sites in seven different regional areas of the right atrium: lateral, anterior and posterior wall, septum, sinoatrial node (SAN), appendage, and near the tricuspid annulus (TA) in 10 healthy pigs using the CARTO mapping system. Results. The activation time (AT), MAP duration (MAPd) and end of repolarization time (EOR) of the whole right atrium were 68 Â± 7, 239 Â± 20 and 270 Â± 23 ms, respectively. There were no significant differences on MAPd and EOR among the seven regional areas, nor between each of the regional and global values. The global dispersions of the MAPd and EOR were 75 Â± 19 and 103 Â± 13 ms, which were significantly greater than those obtained from any of the seven regional areas and those between two remote regions, SAN vs. TA and SAN vs. appendage regions.

However, it is unknown whether the ART can be used to estimate the global sequence and <b>dispersion</b> <b>of</b> ventricular <b>repolarization</b> as determined by the monophasic action potential (MAP) mapping technique. Methods and Results: Endocardial MAPs and unipolar electrograms were simultaneously recorded using the CARTO system from 34 +/- 12 left (n = 6) or right (n = 9) ventricular sites in 12 patients. End-of-repolarization (EOR) times from the MAPs and ARTs from the unipolar electrograms were calculated, based on which 15 sets of 3 -dimensional maps of global EOR sequence and ART sequence were reconstructed. The ART sequence was consistent with the EOR sequence in 14 of 15 maps. In the 473 paired measurements obtained, the differences between the ART and the EOR time were 2 +/- 22 milliseconds (NS). A significant positive correlation between the ART and the EOR time was found in all the maps (r = 0. 58 +/- 0. 22). Agreement analyses showed that the differences between these 2 measurements were almost all within the range of mean difference +/- 2 SD for each individual map and for all the 473 recordings. The global <b>dispersion</b> <b>of</b> ART was 79 +/- 35 milliseconds, as compared with that of EOR time of 78 +/- 35 milliseconds (NS).

40|$|OBJECTIVE: Increased <b>dispersion</b> <b>of</b> {{ventricular}} <b>repolarization</b> {{has been}} shown to be a marker for increased risk of ventricular tachyarrhythmias in various cardiac disorders. The present study is aimed at comparing the values <b>of</b> four <b>dispersion</b> indices in four clinical groups: normal subjects (n = 23), patients with intraventricular conduction defects (QRS > 0. 12 s) without underlying cardiac disease (n = 30), patients with dilated cardiomyopathy (n = 36), and patients with both dilated cardiomyopathy and ventricular conduction defects (n = 18). METHODS: On an averaged cycle from a 10 s record of 15 simultaneous leads (12 -lead ECG and XYZ leads), and after interactive editing, four intervals were computed: JTapex, JTend, QTapex and QTend. For each interval, the dispersion is defined as the difference between the maximal and minimal values across the 15 leads. RESULTS: The mean values <b>of</b> all four <b>dispersion</b> indices were significantly smaller in the normal group than in the three other groups (P < 0. 001). Among patients with dilated cardiomyopathy, those with intraventricular conduction defects had significantly higher dispersion values than those without, even disregarding the QRS duration (P < 0. 01).

Increased QT dispersion {{has been reported in}} patients with HCM, but the underlying mechanisms have not been completely elucidated. In this study, we examined the relationship between diffuse interstitial fibrosis, replacement fibrosis, QTc dispersion and ventricular arrhythmias in patients with HCM. We hypothesized that fibrosis would slow impulse propagation and increase <b>dispersion</b> <b>of</b> ventricular <b>repolarization,</b> resulting in increased QTc dispersion on surface electrocardiogram (ECG) and ventricular arrhythmias. Methods: ECG and cardiac magnetic resonance (CMR) image analyses were performed retrospectively in 112 patients with a clinical diagnosis of HCM. Replacement fibrosis was assessed by measuring late gadolinium (Gd) enhancement (LGE), using a semi-automated threshold technique. Diffuse interstitial fibrosis was assessed by measuring T 1 relaxation times after Gd administration, using the Look–Locker sequence. QTc dispersion was measured digitally in the septal/anterior (V 1 –V 4), inferior (II, III, and aVF), and lateral (I, aVL, V 5, and V 6) lead groups on surface ECG. Results: All patients had evidence of asymmetric septal hypertrophy. LGE was evident in 70 (63 %) patients; the median T 1 relaxation time was 411 ± 38  ms. An inverse correlation was observed between T 1 relaxation time and QTc dispersion in leads V 1 –V 4 (p< 0. 001).

40|$|This paper {{shows the}} use of the {{equivalent}} surface source model in its application to the genesis of the surface ECG in which the sources are of the double layer type. This model has previously been shown to yield an accurate description of body surface potentials during the QRS interval. Its application to the genesis of the T wave is now worked out in greater detail. In this source model, the full spatio-temporal character of the cardiac electric generator is expressed by means of an equivalent double layer situated at the boundary of ventricular tissue. The timing of local depolarization and <b>of</b> <b>repolarization</b> <b>of</b> the cells near this boundary is used to simulate the surface ECG. The background of this source model is discussed, as well as its validity. A matrix formulation is presented of the forward problem of computing the resulting body surface potentials. Based on this forward formulation, an inverse computation of the timing <b>of</b> the <b>repolarization</b> process was performed. Simulated T waves, based on this timing, showed a close correspondence with measured body surface potentials. By taking the inversely computed timing <b>of</b> <b>repolarization</b> as representing the true situation, the model can be used to study in which way perturbations in the timing <b>of</b> local <b>repolarization</b> effect the shape of T waves. An analysis based on this model indicates that the amplitude of the T wave is proportional to the <b>dispersion</b> <b>of</b> the <b>repolarization</b> times at the ventricular surface.

MethodsQT intervals were measured from the 12 -lead electrocardiogram in a random middle-aged population (226 men/ 187 women). The longest QT interval at any of the 12 leads (QTmax), QTV 2, and the Tpeak-Tend interval were used as measures <b>of</b> <b>repolarization.</b> Deoxyribonucleic acid samples were genotyped for the nucleotide 2690 A>C variation of the HERG gene, corresponding to the HERG K(lysine) 897 T(threonine) amino acid polymorphism. ResultsThe allele frequencies were 0. 84 (A) and 0. 16 (C). Females with the genotype AC or CC had longer QTcmax (477 ± 99 ms) and Tpeak-Tend intervals (143 ± 95 ms) than females with the genotype AA (441 ± 69 ms and 116 ± 65 ms, p = 0. 005 and p = 0. 025, respectively). In males, the QTcmax and the Tpeak-Tend intervals did not differ between the genotypes. After adjustment for echocardiographic and various laboratory variables, the HERG K 897 T polymorphism remained as an independent predictor of QTcmax (p = 0. 009) and the Tpeak-Tend intervals (p = 0. 026) in females.

40|$|Torsade de pointes (TdP) is a {{life-threatening}} arrhythmia that develops {{as a consequence}} of a reduction in the repolarization reserve of cardiac cells leading to amplification of electrical heterogeneities in the ventricular myocardium {{as well as to the}} development of early afterdepolarization-induced triggered activity. Electrical heterogeneities within the ventricles are due to differences in the time course of repolarization of the three predominant cell types that make up the ventricular myocardium, giving rise to transmural voltage gradients and a <b>dispersion</b> <b>of</b> <b>repolarization</b> that contributes to the inscription of the electrocardiographic T wave. A number of non-antiarrhythmic drugs and antiarrhythmic agents with class III actions and/or the various mutations and cardiomyopathies associated with the long QT syndrome reduce net repolarizing current and amplify spatial <b>dispersion</b> <b>of</b> <b>repolarization,</b> thus creating the substrate for re-entry. This results in a prolongation of the QT interval, abnormal T waves, and development of TdP. Agents that prolong the QT interval but do not cause an increase in transmural <b>dispersion</b> <b>of</b> <b>repolarization</b> (TDR) do not induce TdP, suggesting that QT prolongation is not the sole or optimal determinant for arrhythmogenesis.

40|$|AbstractOBJECTIVESThe study {{compared}} {{the influence of}} sympathetic stimulation on transmural and spatial <b>dispersion</b> <b>of</b> <b>repolarization</b> between LQT 1 and LQT 2 forms of congenital long QT syndrome (LQTS). BACKGROUNDCardiac events are more associated with sympathetic stimulation in LQT 1 than in LQT 2 or LQT 3 syndrome. Experimental {{studies have suggested that}} the interval between Tpeak and Tend (Tp-e) in the electrocardiogram (ECG) reflects transmural <b>dispersion</b> <b>of</b> <b>repolarization</b> across the ventricular wall. METHODSWe recorded 87 -lead body-surface ECGs before and after epinephrine infusion (0. 1 μg/kg/min) in 13 LQT 1, 6 LQT 2, and 7 control patients. The Q-Tend (QT-e), Q-Tpeak (QT-p), and Tp-e were measured automatically from 87 -lead ECGs, corrected by Bazett’s method (QTc-e, QTc-p, Tcp-e), and averaged among all 87 -leads and among 24 -leads, which reflect the potential from the left ventricular free wall. As an index of spatial <b>dispersion</b> <b>of</b> <b>repolarization,</b> the dispersion of QTc-e (QTc-eD) and QTc-p (QTc-pD) were obtained among 87 -leads and among 24 -leads, and were defined as the interval between the maximum and the minimum of the QTc-e and the QTc-p, respectively. RESULTSEpinephrine significantly increased the mean QTc-e but not the mean QTc-p, resulting in {{a significant increase in the}} mean Tcp-e in both LQT 1 and LQT 2, but not in control patients. The epinephrine-induced increases in the mean QTc-e and Tcp-e were larger in LQT 1 than in LQT 2, and were more pronounced when the averaged data were obtained from 24 -leads than from 87 -leads. Epinephrine increased the maximum QTc-e but not the minimum QTc-e, producing a significant increase in the QTc-eD in both LQT 1 and LQT 2 patients, but not in control patients. The increase in the QTc-eD was larger in LQT 1 than in LQT 2 patients. CONCLUSIONSOur data suggest that sympathetic stimulation produces a greater increase in both transmural and spatial <b>dispersion</b> <b>of</b> <b>repolarization</b> in LQT 1 than in LQT 2 syndrome, and this may explain why LQT 1 patients are more sensitive to sympathetic stimulation...|$|E
40|$|The {{purposes}} are {{to validate}} the noninvasive parameters, QT interval, QT dispersion, Tpeak-Tend interval, and the activation recovery time (ART) for estimation <b>of</b> global <b>dispersion</b> <b>of</b> ventricular <b>repolarization</b> (DVR), and to investigate the changes <b>of</b> <b>repolarization</b> sequence and DVR by altered ventricular pacing sites. The material consisted of 12 patients (Study I) and two series healthy pigs with 10 in each (Studies II and III; Studies IV and V). In Study I, endocardial MAPs and unipolar electrograms were recorded using the CARTO system in 12 patients. End <b>of</b> <b>repolarization</b> (EOR) times from the MAPs and ARTs from the unipolar electrograms were acquired and 3 -dimensional maps of global EOR and ART were reconstructed. The ART sequence was consistent with that of EOR and no significant diffence was found between EOR times and ART. A significant, positive correlation between the ART and the EOR time was also found in all maps. These findings suggest {{the usefulness of the}} ART in evaluation of global sequence and <b>dispersion</b> <b>of</b> ventricular <b>repolarization.</b> In Studies II and III, MAP mapping was performed over both the ventricular endo- and the epicardium using the CARTO system in 10 open-chest pigs, from which the EOR times over the epi- (EORepi), endocardium (EORendo) and over both (EORtotal) were obtained- 12 -lead ECG were recorded simultaneously. The QTpeak intervals were significantly smaller than the maximal EORepi. No significant difference was found between the maximal QTend interval and the maximal EORendo, between the maximal QTend interval and the maximal EORtotal nor between the minimal QTpeak interval and the minimal EORtotal, which suggests that not only the transmural gradients, but also the apico-basal repolarization gradients contribute to the genesis of the T wave. In addition, the maximal Tpeak-Tend intervals were consistent with the <b>dispersion</b> <b>of</b> EOR-total, and significantly correlated with the <b>dispersion</b> <b>of</b> EOR-total. However, the mean Tpeak-Tend intervals, and Tpeak-Tend intervals from lead II and V 5 were all significantly smaller than and poorly correlated with the <b>dispersion</b> <b>of</b> EOR-total, as were the QTpeak and QTend dispersions. These findings suggest that the maximal Tpeak-Tend interval may be used as a noninvasive estimate of the global DVR, but not the QTpeak and QTend dispersions, nor the mean Tpeak-Tend interval and that from a single lead. In Studies IV and V, global MAPs were recorded from the ventricular endocardium during right atrial (RA), RV apex endocardial (RVEndo) and LV laterobasal epicardial (LVEpi) pacing in 10 pigs, with ECG simultaneously recorded. During RA pacing, the EOR sequence followed the AT sequence in both ventricles. Strikingly, the EOR sequence was also consistent with the AT sequence in both ventricles during RVEndo and LVEpi pacing, even though the mapping was performed after an abrupt change of the pacing site. In all maps, there was a negative correlation between the MAP duration and the AT and a positive correlation between the EOR time and the AT under each pacing protocol. These findings suggest the importance of activation sequence in governing repolarization patterns. Significant changes in repolarization from an altered activation sequence may happen within a few hours in vivo, implying that electrical remodeling of the ventricles may be rapidly induced by altered activation sequence. In addition, the global <b>dispersion</b> <b>of</b> EOR times during LVEpi pacing was significantly greater than those during RA and RVEndo pacing, whereas no significant difference was found between those during RA and RVEndo pacing. In addition, the QT intervals, QT dispersion and Tpeak-Tend intervals during LVEpi pacing were all significantly greater than those during RA and RVEndo pacing These findings provide in vivo evidence supporting the involvement of increased DVR in the incidence of malignant ventricular arrhythmias in a subgroup of patients with biventricular pacing...|$|R

The {{influence of the}} new class III agent d-sotalol on QT dispersion (QT disp) was investigated in 20 patients (pts) with recurrent sustained ventricular tachycardia (VT) and/or ventricular fibrillation (VF). All pts had inducibile VT/VF at baseline and were electrophysiologically studied under oral d-sotalol (460 ± 94 mg/day). In 10 pts d-sQTalol suppressed the induction of VT/VF, whereas 10 pts did not respond. QTand RR intervals of 3 consecutive beats were measured in 6 simultaneously recorded precordial leads (VI-V 6) by two independent blinded investigators. Under oral d-sotalol, the QT disp was reduced in 9 / 10 responders but only in 4 / 10 non-responders, despite comparable doses of the drug in both groups.

40|$|Differences in {{the time}} course of repolarization of the three {{predominant}} myocardial cell types have been shown to contribute to the inscription of the T wave of the electrocardiogram (ECG). Voltage gradients developing {{as a result of the}} different time course of repolarization of phases 2 and 3 in the three cell types give rise to opposing voltage gradients on either side of the M region, which are in part responsible for the inscription of the T wave. 1 In the case of an upright T wave, the epicardial response is the earliest to repolarize and the M cell action potential is the latest. In the coronary-perfused wedge preparation, repolarization of the epicardial action potential coincides with the peak of the T wave and repolarization of the M cells is coincident with the end of the T wave, so that the interval from the peak to the end of the T wave provides a measure of transmural <b>dispersion</b> <b>of</b> <b>repolarization</b> (TDR).

40|$|The T wave on the ECG (T-ECG) {{represents}} repolariza-tion of the ventricular myocardium.

However, the physiological background of the T wave is incompletely under-stood, thereby hampering reliable interpretation of the T wave. Clinical Perspective on p 531 Interpretation of the T wave morphology on body surface ECGs (T-ECG) {{is different from that}} on local electrograms (T-local). In a far-field recording (eg, a 12 -lead ECG), the T wave represents repolarization in the entire heart. 1 In a near-field recording (eg, a local electrogram), the T wave can be used to accurately deter-mine local repolarization moments. 2, 3 Unlike our understanding of T-local, knowledge of the T-ECG is still incomplete. Previous studies have focused mainly on a single domi-nant repolarization gradient to explain the T-ECG morphol-ogy. 4 – 6 It has become generally accepted that concordance of the T-ECG with the QRS complex is explained by oppos-ing sequences of transmural activation and repolarization. 5 Whereas activation progresses from subendocardial to sub-epicardial myocardium, repolarization was assumed to prog-ress in the opposite direction. 7 Additionally, T-ECG-peak and T-ECG-end were explained by the end <b>of</b> <b>repolarization</b> <b>of,</b> respectively, the subepicardial and M cell layers. 6 There is, however, controversy regarding the presence of a functional M cell layer in human hearts.
