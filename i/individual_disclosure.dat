40|$|Businesses {{routinely}} rely on econometric {{models to}} analyze and predict consumer behavior. Estimation of such models may require combining a firm’s internal data with external datasets {{to take into account}} sample selection, missing observations, omitted variables and errors in measurement within the existing data source. In this paper we point out that these data problems can be addressed when estimating econometric models from combined data using the data mining techniques under mild assumptions regarding the data distribution. However, data combination leads to serious threats to security of consumer data: we demonstrate that point identification of an econometric model from combined data is incompatible with restrictions on the risk of <b>individual</b> <b>disclosure.</b> Consequently, if a consumer model is point identified, the firm would (implicitly or explicitly) reveal the identity of at least some of consumers in its internal data. More importantly, we provide an argument that unless the firm places a restriction on the <b>individual</b> <b>disclosure</b> risk when combining data, even if the raw combined dataset is not shared with a third party, an adversary or a competitor can gather confidential information regarding some individuals from the estimated model...|$|E

40|$|This Essay {{considers}} Professor Gilbert’s {{model as}} the core element in a dynamic system of campaign finance disclosure. First, it recognizes several useful contributions of the model’s framework of informational costs and benefits. In the simplest analysis, disclosure increases the information available to voters by adding source revelation to campaign speech. However, the reality is more complicated. Disclosure can have a chilling effect that decreases the amount of campaign speech by imposing administrative and exposure burdens on speakers. As Professor Gilbert shows, this cannot end the analysis. What matters {{is not just the}} magnitude of the chilling effect on speech, but the net “information tradeoff” between the decrease in campaign speech and the increase in source revelation, both of which are informative to voters. Second, this Essay builds upon the information tradeoff in several directions, drawing on other scholars’ perspectives of campaign finance as a complex system of dynamic interactions. It refines the speaker’s cost-benefit function in the information tradeoff {{at the level of the}} <b>individual</b> <b>disclosure</b> rule, extends the information tradeoff analysis to dynamics involving multiple <b>individual</b> <b>disclosure</b> rules at the regime level, and considers the aggregate information tradeoff from multiple interacting regimes at the system level. The Essay concludes by suggesting that, given the difficulty of determining the information tradeoff at the rule, regime, and system levels, analysts, policymakers, and courts should more often recognize the value of second-best solutions to campaign finance disclosure...|$|E

40|$|PURPOSE OF THE STUDY Executive {{compensation}} frequently makes {{headlines in}} both academic journals {{and the yellow}} press. From the academic point of view, executive compensation has its grounds in agency theory. Effective compensation schemes align the interests of managers and owners and motivate managers to maximize shareholder value. Disclosure of compensation schemes enables shareholders to evaluate the remuneration contracts’ adequacy. In 2005, the German legislator created a natural experiment to study the economic consequences of executive compensation disclosure. From 2006 on, firms were obliged to disclose individual compensation details for their executive board members. Prior to that, disclosure of individual figures was recommended but voluntary, disclosure was mandatory only for the board as a whole. The setting allows examining whether voluntary <b>individual</b> <b>disclosure</b> reveals information about the underlying firms, whether the capital markets appreciated the increased disclosure requirements and how firms reacted to the amendment. DATA AND METHODOLOGY The sample is collected from a repeated cross-section of the constituents of the German stock indexes DAX, MDAX, SDAX and TecDAX for the years 2005 - 2007. After exclusion of missing data, 428 out of 480 firm years (160 firms for three years) remain which represents a considerable portion of the total German market capitalization. Compensation data is hand collected from annual reports, other financial data is taken from the Thomson One Banker database. Hypotheses are tested by comparisons of means, random effects regressions, difference-in-differences analysis and an event study that uses constant mean return and mean adjusted return models. RESULTS The results show structural differences between voluntary disclosing and non-disclosing firms. Disclosing firms use performance-based compensation {{to a greater extent}} but pay comparatively more than their non-disclosing peers. Event study results indicate positive capital market reactions around the dates the amendment was introduced. The findings support the governance improvement hypothesis which predicts improvements of compensation schemes when disclosure is more detailed. Examination of the real firm reactions shows increases in absolute pay levels and the performance-based portions. Especially, firms increase compensation when they switch to <b>individual</b> <b>disclosure.</b> Possible reasons are higher competition for labor or compensation for the higher risk of variable payments...|$|E
30|$|The {{strength}} of the resulting sample is the 1 : 1 -matching of personal and firm years. Conditions for being included in the regressions are the following: First, for some individuals, data on compensation received were not available. This possibility exists because of an opt-out rule specified in the VorstOG which enables shareholders to veto the <b>individual</b> <b>disclosure</b> of the company’s executives’ compensation (§ 286 subparagraph 5). Second, the compensation packages had to be comparable and, therefore, we only included executives with 12  months of tenure per year. These adjustments yield a matched sample of overall 122 executive/firm years (61 male and 61 female). 112 of them {{were included in the}} calculated models due to the partial unavailability of control variables. To provide evidence for the equivalency of the two sub-samples, we tested for the sub-samples’ equality with regard to firm size, firm performance as well as ownership structure (Arthaud-Day et al. 2006). The results indicated no differences of statistical significance between the female and the male sub-samples.|$|E
40|$|Information flow {{techniques}} typically classify information {{according to}} suitable security levels and enforce {{policies that are}} based on binary relations between individual levels, e. g., stating that information is allowed to flow from one level to another.

The flow of information is expressed in terms of causal dependencies and the satisfaction of a policy is defined with respect to an event structure that is assumed to capture the causal structure of system computations.

40|$|It is commonplace {{that the}} data needed for econometric {{inference}} are not contained in a single source. In this paper we analyze the problem of parametric inference from combined individual-level data when data combination is based on personal and demographic identifiers such as name, age, or address. Our main question is {{the identification of the}} econometric model based on the combined data when the data do not contain exact individual identifiers and no parametric assumptions are imposed on the joint distribution of information that is common across the combined dataset. We demonstrate the conditions on the observable marginal distributions of data in individual datasets that can and cannot guarantee identification of the parameters of interest. We also note {{that the data}} combination procedure is essential in the semiparametric setting such as ours. Provided that the (non-parametric) data combination procedure can only be defined in finite samples, we introduce a new notion of identification based on the concept of limits of statistical experiments. Our results apply to the setting where the individual data used for inferences are sensitive and their combination may lead to a substantial increase in the data sensitivity or lead to a de-anonymization of the previously anonymized information. We demonstrate that the point identification of an econometric model from combined data is incompatible with restrictions on the risk of <b>individual</b> <b>disclosure.</b> If the data combination procedure guarantees a bound on the risk of <b>individual</b> <b>disclosure,</b> then the information available from the combined dataset allows one to identify the parameter of interest only partially, {{and the size of the}} identification region is inversely related to the upper bound guarantee for the disclosure risk. This result is new in the context of data combination as we notice that the quality of links that need to be used in the combined data to assure point identification may be much higher than the average link quality in the entire dataset, and thus point inference requires the use of the most sensitive subset of the data. Our results provide important insights into the ongoing discourse on the empirical analysis of merged administrative records as well as discussions on the disclosive nature of policies implemented by the data-driven companies (such as Internet services companies and medical companies using individual patient records for policy decisions...|$|E
40|$|Several recent {{corporate}} governance scandals relate to non-disclosure or high amounts of pension benefits given to executive directors. The lack of disclosure and transparency has gained pensions benefits greater attention {{as a significant}} part of the total remuneration received by executive directors. Due to the associated problems there is a greater need for better disclosure and in turn heightened transparency towards shareholders.   This qualitative case study focuses on general retailers in Sweden and the United Kingdom. Due to the lack of research five general retailers from respective country were chosen to be examined and compared during 2006 - 2010. The aim is to examine the disclosure of individual pension benefits of executive directors and the development in levels of pension benefits in the following general retailers Bilia, Clas Ohlson, Debenhams, Dunelm Mill, Fenix Outdoor, Halfords, JD Sports Fashion,  Kappahl, Mekonomen and N Brown Group.

The level of disclosure has differentiated, where UK general retailers have a higher level of <b>individual</b> <b>disclosure.</b> The development in levels of pension benefits has shown that there are higher amounts of pension benefits in Swedish general retailers. A negative trend in the development of the Chief Executive Officers amounts of pension benefits has mainly been present in 2007 - 2009.

40|$|This {{paper is}} closed access. Manuscript Type: Empirical Research Question/Issue: This study seeks to {{understand}} why the disclosure of individual executive compensation, as recommended by the German Code of Corporate Governance, met with resistance in some firms while being a welcome innovation for others. Employing the theoretical perspective of institutional inertia and change, this paper identifies the characteristics of a firm likely to embrace or resist a management practice imported from an Anglo-American system of corporate governance. Research Findings/Results: Using data on large German firms for the years 2002 through 2005, the study shows that institutional ownership, dispersed ownership, state ownership, prior adoption of shareholder value-oriented practices, and firm size are positively and significantly associated with the disclosure of individual executive compensation. On the other hand, the size of the supervisory board and firm age are negatively and significantly associated with <b>individual</b> <b>disclosure</b> of executive compensation. Theoretical Implications: This study provides empirical support for the institutional inertia or change perspective at the national level for the adoption of contested management practices, taken from the Anglo-American system and translated to the German model. As such, it adds to the argument on convergence/divergence in comparative corporate governance literature, as well as support for the neo-institutional perspective in helping to further understand institutional change. Practical Implications: This study offers insights to policy makers who aim to create an institutional environment that accepts corporate governance practices translated or negotiated from a different variety of capitalism. In addition, it provides a useful synthesis of the relevance and effectiveness of codes of corporate governance, thus helping policy makers to recommend continuation with the current elements of the code or to make such provisions compulsory...|$|E

40|$|To date, {{traditional}} behavioral interventions {{have done}} little to reduce the prevalence and transmission of HIV among African American {{men who have sex with}} men (AAMSM), a highly at risk group. Some researchers theorize that the lack of success may be because these interventions do not address contextual factors among AAMSM. Community-based participatory research (CBPR) is one approach to research with the potential to lead to effective interventions in the future. CBPR is a collaborative, mixed-methods and multidisciplinary, approach to scientific inquiry, which is conducted with, and within, the community. The current study follows the CBPR approach to engage and develop a relationship with the African American communities in the Dallas/Fort Worth Metroplex. Contextual issues were discussed in order to identify emerging themes regarding HIV health related issues among AAMSM to provide the groundwork for continued CBPR research and future interventions with AAMSM in the Dallas/Fort Worth Metroplex. To accomplish this goal, researchers began the CBPR process by conducting interviews and focus groups with a sample of approximately 62 (34 from key informant interviews, 28 from focus groups [gender balanced]) AIDS service organization leaders and workers, advocates, medical doctors and community members with first-hand knowledge of HIV health issues in the AAMSM community. Transcripts of these interviews and focus groups were analyzed to identify emerging themes at the societal (religious doctrine, African American Culture, age-related norms and stigma), community (education, religious views/policy and community norms) and <b>individual</b> (<b>disclosure,</b> personal identity, sexual behavior/risk, accessing care and communication) levels.

40|$|Disclosure of HIV status {{has been}} the focus of three decades of research, which have {{revealed}} its complex relations to many behaviors involved in HIV prevention and treatment, and exposed its central role in managing the HIV epidemic. The causes and consequences of disclosure acts have recently been the subject of several theoretical models. Although it is acknowledged that <b>individual</b> <b>disclosure</b> events are part of a broader process of disclosing one's HIV status to an increasing number of people, this process has received less theoretical attention. In quantitative studies of disclosure, researchers have often implicitly assumed that disclosure is a single unidimensional process appropriately measured via the total number of one's disclosure acts. However, there is also evidence that disclosure may have different causes and consequences depending on the types of actors involved (e. g. family members, friends) and on the presence or absence of the discloser's intention, suggesting that the unidimensionality assumption may not hold. We quantitatively examined the dimensionality of voluntary and involuntary disclosure to different categories of actors, using data collected via structured interviews in the spring of 2010 from 158 people living with HIV in Kilimanjaro, Tanzania. For voluntary disclosure, nonparametric item response analyses identified two multi-category clusters, family and community, and two single-category dimensions, partner and children. Involuntary disclosure consisted of several single- or two-category dimensions. Correlation analyses between the resulting disclosure dimensions and stigma and social support revealed distinct relationships for each disclosure dimension. Our results suggest that treating disclosure as a unidimensional construct is a simplification of disclosure processes that may lead to incorrect conclusions about disclosure correlates. We therefore recommend examining disclosure acts jointly to identify sample-specific dimensions before examining causes and consequences of disclosure. We propose a methodology for investigating disclosure processes, and recommend its adoption in future disclosure studies...|$|E
40|$|Background: Breaking {{bad news}} to cancer {{patients}} {{is one of}} the important responsibilities in the oncology setting. The {{purpose of this study is}} develop and validate a new theoretically based tool for measurement of attitude and practice of physicians toward breaking bad news. Methods: The psychometric properties of the scale were established by following the guidelines of Clark and Watson. In the first phase, a literature review was performed to create items; then items were assessed for content validity through individual interview (n = 12) and construct validity was assessed by using factor analysis. Reliability was evaluated by Cronbach’s alpha. Research data was gathered from physicians working in breast cancer setting. Results: A total of 12 expert reviews concluded that a large amount of items of attitude and practice questionnaires were important and essential (Content Validity Ratio > 0. 73). The exploratory and confirmatory factor analyses for a sample of physicians (n = 200) indicated a 12 -item of attitude scale with three factors: full disclosure, non-disclosure and <b>individual</b> <b>disclosure.</b> Cronbach’s Alpha for the factors returned 0. 746, 0. 834 and 0. 795, respectively. The exploratory and confirmatory factor analyses for a sample of physicians (n = 200) indicated a 20 -item of practice scale with six factors: preparation, setting of the interaction, communicate well, use of the “cancer” word, patient’s right to know and close the interview, and summarized. Cronbach’s Alpha for the factors returned 0. 765, 0. 63, 0. 65, 0. 793, 0. 759 and 0. 7, respectively. Conclusions: A resultant 12 items of attitude and 20 items of practice questionnaire were developed to assess how physicians are giving bad news to breast cancer patients. The reliability of the new tools needs to be evaluated for further studies. This new questionnaire will provide researchers and clinicians with a thorough and suitable instrument to measure belief and practice regarding disclosing the truth to breast cancer patients. </p...|$|E

40|$|The aim of {{this thesis}} {{is to examine the}} quality of the {{disclosure}} IAS 1 Presentation of Financial Statements, paragraphs 122 and 125 in the annual reports of Swedish publicly listed firms. These paragraphs state that firms are required to disclose judgments made by management in preparing financial statements that may have significant impact on the recognized carrying amount. These paragraphs should also include information about major sources of estimation uncertainty. A quantitative research approach is used and the sample consists of 1, 519 annual reports over a 7 -year period. We construct a disclosure index to assess the quality of the disclosures in Critical judgements and key sources of estimation uncertainty (IAS 1 : 122 and 1 : 125) note and categorize the annual reports into four index groups. Additionally, the number of headlines in the note are counted and sorted into three other groups, creating a headline index. Lastly, we multiply the disclosure index with the headline index to get a score, which then enable us to distinguish and rank the quality of disclosure between firms. Further, we count the number of words in each <b>individual</b> <b>disclosure</b> in each annual report. This additional quantitative data enable regression analyses, further ensuring objectivity in assessing the disclosure quality. Agency theory and political cost theory are used as base for determining which firm characteristics may affect disclosure quality. We examine the firm characteristics firm visibility, ownership concentration and leverage to investigate any relationship with disclosure quality. We use the ordinary least squares (OLS) regression method to analyse this data. The analysis shows that firm visibility and leverage have positive relationships with disclosure quality. This supports the political cost theory and suggests that firms that are more visible have stronger incentives to attain a high disclosure quality. Our findings also support debt-associated agency problems and are also in line with prior studies that found a positive relationship between disclosure quality and the degree of leverage, which indicates that disclosures reduces the information gap. ...|$|E

Due to their size and economic impact it is important that they maintain growth and stability. Writers have maintained that voluntary corporate disclosure can help to achieve growth and stability thus the aim of this research is to examine recent Chinese listed companies’ voluntary disclosure practice. The purpose of this study is to investigate voluntary disclosure level of top 50 listed Chinese companies on Shanghai Stock Exchange during 2008 - 2012 period. This study primarily utilizes a quantitative approach. The author constructs a Voluntary Disclosure Index (VDI) based on legislative/regulatory consideration, investor demand, investor sophistication and previous studies. This VDI score is then used to measure companies’ voluntary disclosure level. The results of this study indicate that the overall voluntary disclosure level did not increase during 2008 - 2012, rather it dropped. Some interesting findings about disclosure level and <b>individual</b> <b>disclosure</b> item scores in certain disclosure categories stood out; for example, nearly all companies detached their CSR report or sustainability report from their annual reports in 2010, resulted a sharp decline in voluntary disclosure level in certain related disclosure category. Further there was little employment information disclosed particularly of note are the areas of minority and gender, and little forward looking corporate focused financial information as opposed to general economic expectations was disclosed. By using more recent data and considering the changes in China’s corporate disclosure regulation system in recent years, this study addresses certain gaps from previous Chinese studies. This study also explores some regulatory loopholes in China’s disclosure regulation system and certain insufficiencies in investors’ education, thus this study can be of value to policy makers. Overall it is hoped that this study can lead to greater engagement between Chinese corporations and investors particularly in the area of voluntary disclosure...|$|E
40|$|In {{the last}} few years, {{payments}} from the pharmaceutical industry to physicians and medical institutions are increasingly critically questioned, since evidence suggests that those payments are influencing the medical profession (e. g. in prescribing). To promote trust, the European Federation of Pharmaceutical Industries and Associations (EFPIA) responded with directives and regulations. The "Transparency Initiative" calls on member companies to disclose "monetary benefits {{to members of the}} professional circles and institutions" in year 2015. This information should be accessible to the general public at the respective websites of the pharmaceutical companies. The question that underlies this project report is the following: To what extent were Austrian physicians and medical institutions supported by pharmaceutical companies in 2015 and how transparent are they in the disclosure of the financial benefits? In a systematic analysis, the websites of all PHARMIG member companies (115) were searched for information on financial allocations to Austrian physicians and medical institutions in 2015. For a total of 69 out of 115 PHARMIG member companies, cash-based benefits were found in 2015. 20 pharmaceutical companies stated that they had not made any financial contributions; the rest of the companies did not provide feedback on request. A total of 104. 1 million euros from PHARMIG member companies to doctors and medical institutions as well as to clinical research and application observations were made in Austria in 2015. From this, clinical and post-marketing studies were financed with around 54 million euros (52 % of the total financial expenditures), medical institutions and organisations received 27 million euros (26 %) and physicians 22 million euros (22 %). The results also show that Austrian pharmaceutical companies invested approximately 30 million euros in events (conferences, meetings), including the support of the events themselves, conference and participation fees as well as travel and accommodation costs. A total of 14 million euros was spent on services and advisory fees (e. g. on lectures given by physicians) and about 6 million euros for donations and funding. The disclosure of payments by pharmaceutical companies to doctors and medical institutions in Austria is an important step towards greater transparency, but is still at an initial stage. The evaluation of the data from 2015 shows that the actual willingness to disclose financial grants, especially from physicians, is low and the <b>individual</b> <b>disclosure</b> rate (naming of the nominee) was only at an average of 21. 9 %. In contrast, the willingness to disclose payments from medical institutions by name (institutional) was significantly higher at 50. 2 %...|$|E
40|$|The aim of {{this study}} was to explore what it means for London-based, {{immigrant}} Black East-African men and their female partners to live with HIV. Few studies have been conducted on this issue with the present study population. The main thrust of existing research has been on preventing new infections, and work on living with HIV has mostly focused on groups in which the disease has a higher prevalence in developed societies, for example men who have sex with men. A modified grounded theory methodology underpinned by a symbolic interactionist theoretical framework was adopted. Data collection involved in-depth interviews with 23 participants, including: one HIV-negative man in a sero-discordant relationship; 11 HIV-positive men; six HIV-positive women, five of whom were partners of an HIV-positive research participant; and five workers from London-based community organisations offering HIV-related services accessed by Black Africans. Most (13 / 17) of the HIV-positive research participants opted to partially conceal their condition. In consequence, they faced an ongoing dilemma regarding whether to reveal their HIV-positive status to particular <b>individuals.</b> <b>Disclosure</b> could potentially unlock sources of social support, but also created the risk of stigmatization. But concealment meant forfeiting potential social support sources, and created risks of exposure. Four of the 18 research participants had eventually decided to ‘come out’ publicly in order to challenge stereotypes about HIV. They demonstrated that open communication about HIV-positive status can be a viable alternative to selective concealment and disclosure. The findings are used to develop practice and policy recommendations based on recognising social sensitivities around communicating HIV-positive status and other stigmatized attributes. Proposals are offered for developing further research, particularly comparative work which can help to clarify the impact of culture on disclosure of potentially stigmatizing personal information...|$|R
40|$|Increasing {{collection}} of individuals’ information {{has led to}} several security and privacy issues, such as identity theft and targeted marketing. These risks are further heightened in the mobile realm as data collection can occur continuously and ubiquitously. Most existing research considers threats to privacy and security as separate concerns, resulting in separate research streams. However, focusing on information privacy alone results in {{a lack of understanding}} of the security ramifications of <b>individual</b> information <b>disclosure.</b> Using the Information Motivation Behavioral (IMB) Skills Model as a theoretical foundation, we develop the Knowledge Gap Model of Security and Privacy Behavior. In the model, we propose that two knowledge gaps exist that affect how individuals enact security and privacy behaviors: the security-privacy knowledge gap, and the knowledge-belief gap. We use the model to develop a research agenda for future research...|$|R
40|$|Accounting {{accruals}} are at {{the heart}} of most accounting systems. A basic premise of accrual accounting is that it provides a more timely and relevant performance measure than cash flows through a better matching of revenues and expenses. While some prior studies suggest that managers use <b>individual</b> accrual-related <b>disclosure</b> items in an opportunistic manner, hindering market participants’ ability to predict future firm performance, the market’s expectation about future firm performance will become more accurate and consistent under accrual accounting if the market properly uses such information to set expectations about future firm performance. Consistent with this idea, our evidence shows that the frequency of accrual-related disclosure is positively (negatively) associated with analysts’ forecast accuracy (dispersion). We interpret this finding as the presence of more detailed accrual-related disclosure requirements enhancing the market participants’ ability to predict earnings. Accounting systems, Accruals...|$|R
