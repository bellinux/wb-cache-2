Most of the matches were not first-class but Brown scored his final first-class century against Otago, scoring 184 in an innings victory.

They faced off once again in the 2010 NBA Finals which the Lakers won in 7 games. Since 1960, the Lakers are 4-2 against their fiercest rival in the Finals.|$|E
5|$|Prior to Gettysburg, Robert E. Lee had {{established}} a reputation as an almost invincible general, achieving stunning victories against superior numbers—although usually {{at the cost of}} high casualties to his army—during the Seven Days, the Northern Virginia Campaign (including the Second Battle of Bull Run), Fredericksburg, and Chancellorsville. Only the Maryland Campaign, with its tactically inconclusive Battle of Antietam, <b>had</b> <b>been</b> <b>less</b> than successful. Therefore, historians have attempted to explain how Lee's winning streak was interrupted so dramatically at Gettysburg. Although the issue is tainted by attempts to portray history and Lee's reputation in a manner supporting different partisan goals, the major factors in Lee's loss arguably can be attributed to: (1) his overconfidence in the invincibility of his men; (2) the performance of his subordinates, and his management thereof; (3) his failing health, and (4) the performance of his opponent, George G. Meade, and the Army of the Potomac.|$|E

25|$|James I had poor {{relations}} with the English Parliament, which <b>had</b> <b>been</b> <b>less</b> submissive than the Scottish Estates {{that he had been}} accustomed to. To raise funds without taxation, James began to sell titles. For instance, individuals paying £1095 could obtain the non-peerage hereditary dignity of baronet. Even peerage dignities were sold. Thus, James I added sixty-two peers to a body that had included just fifty-nine members at the commencement of his reign. His Stuart successors were no less profuse.|$|E

Rajinikanth, {{one of the}} highest paid actors in India, supported the DMK and its ally Tamil Maanila Congress in the 1996 elections. His movie Muthu (1995) makes indirect reference to the then AIADMK head and Chief Minister of Tamil Nadu, Jayalalitha. His movies such as Mannan and Padayappa had characters which were politically identified with Jayalalitha. He later moved his allegiance to the Bharathiya Janata Party in the Indian general election of 2004. Rajinikanth is no longer active in politics. Another leading actor in Tamil cinema, Kamal Hasan, is a well known follower of Periyar.|$|E

25|$|Alongside tragedy, European humanists also {{adapted the}} ancient comedic {{tradition}} and {{as early as}} the 15th century, Renaissance Italy had developed a form of humanist Latin comedy. Although the ancients <b>had</b> <b>been</b> <b>less</b> theoretical about the comedic form, the humanists used the precepts of Aelius Donatus (4th century A.D.), Horace, Aristotle and the works of Terence to elaborate a set of rules: comedy should seek to correct vice by showing the truth; there should be a happy ending; comedy uses a lower style of language than tragedy; comedy does not paint the great events of states and leaders, but the private lives of people, and its principal subject is love.|$|E
25|$|By 2004, it was {{observed}} that since the Oscar for Shakespeare in Love, Paltrow's film career <b>had</b> <b>been</b> <b>less</b> noteworthy and critical acclaim had waned. She said she was unequipped for the pressure, leading to several bad movie choices, agreeing with peers who believe the win is, in some ways, a curse. During this time, Paltrow rarely appeared in films, having taken a hiatus to raise her two children. In The Guardian, she said she divided her career into movies for love and films for money: The Royal Tenenbaums, Proof, and Sylvia fell into the former category, while she signed on to View from the Top and Shallow Hal for the latter.|$|E
25|$|The {{alliance}} was defensive in nature, {{each party}} declaring it would protect the territorial {{stability of the}} other. This provided Prussia with important security on the international scene by turning its most dangerous enemy into an ally. The alliance was also aimed at counteracting {{the power of the}} Austrian, or Habsburg, Empire. From Russia's perspective, Austria <b>had</b> <b>been</b> <b>less</b> willing to compromise on issues related to the expanding Russian sphere of influence and was thus less attractive as an ally at that time. According to some historians, Russia would become the dominating partner in the alliance, partially fulfilling one of its goals from the Seven Years' War: increased influence over Prussia. Others have taken the view that the treaty was a skillful victory for Prussia despite the tendency of Russia to treat Prussia as a junior partner. Shortly before his death, Frederick the Great of Prussia declared that it was the most advantageous treaty he had made.|$|E

25|$|The {{extent of}} alcohol myopia’s effects on one’s {{decisions}} about how to react to sexual arousal is dependent upon the level of confliction one feels. The more intense the personal conflict {{of whether or not}} to use a condom, the greater effect alcohol has on the final decision to engage in risky sexual behavior. Intoxicated males who had felt heavily conflicted about condom use were least likely to use a condom. Those intoxicated men who <b>had</b> <b>been</b> <b>less</b> conflicted about using a condom were {{more likely to engage in}} safe sex. Therefore, some intoxicated individuals can actually be less likely to engage in risky sexual behavior than their sober counterparts, given appropriate cues. The effects of alcohol myopia on response to sexual arousal also depend on the level of sexual arousal. When sexual arousal levels were high, a greater percentage of men reported not using a condom than when arousal levels were low. This goes back to the importance of saliency in alcohol myopia. The more salient the external cue (in this case, higher levels of sexual arousal were more salient than lower levels) the more likely it is for alcohol to inhibit the comprehension of the consequences of an action.|$|E
25|$|By her own account, Casco {{began working}} with women's groups around 1946, mainly because she {{had the support of}} her brother Adolfo. While as a woman she had no real {{political}} power, she felt she <b>had</b> <b>been</b> <b>less</b> marginalized than others. Initially, women helped each other with social service needs, but in 1953, she and other professional women founded the Intituto Cultural de Amparo a la Mujer (Cultural Institute of Refuge for Women). Made up primarily of teachers, with a few doctors and lawyers, their objective was to counsel women and assist them in overcoming societal impediments, such as poor pay, discrimination, poverty, lack of health care, though at times they provided material support. They also attempted to refer women to other benevolent associations that {{might be able to help}} them. In 1954, a coup d'etat brought the dictator Alfredo Stroessner to power and within two years, he issued a decree banning the Institute and placing the women who organized it on lists of suspicious persons. The group did not disband, but instead transformed into the Women's Department of the Liberal Party, though in fact, the Liberal Party was still an illegal organization, as the one-party state was limited to the Colorado Party. Women were not allowed to run for office or participate in any decision-making process. Instead they performed benevolent works, visiting prisoners, raising money, hosting meetings and providing food for functions.|$|E

500|$|He {{was one of}} {{the first}} artists to portray winter landscapes in which the land is {{rendered}} as stark and dead. Friedrich's winter scenes are solemn and still—according to the art historian Hermann Beenken, Friedrich painted winter scenes in which [...] "no man has yet set his foot. The theme of nearly all the older winter pictures <b>had</b> <b>been</b> <b>less</b> winter itself than life in winter. In the 16th and 17th centuries, it was thought impossible to leave out such motifs as the crowd of skaters, the wanderer... It was Friedrich who first felt the wholly detached and distinctive features of a natural life. Instead of many tones, he sought the one; and so, in his landscape, he subordinated the composite chord into one single basic note".|$|E
500|$|Walter Reginald [...] "Wally" [...] Hammond (19 June 1903 – 1 July 1965) was an English Test cricketer {{who played}} for Gloucestershire in a career that lasted from 1920 to 1951.

Primarily a middle-order batsman, Wisden Cricketers' Almanack described him in his obituary {{as one of the}} four best batsmen in the history of cricket. He was considered to be the best English batsman of the 1930s by commentators and those with whom he played; they also said {{that he was one of}} the best slip fielders ever.
