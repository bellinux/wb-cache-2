25|$|The bandit's {{most famous}} exploit {{occurred}} {{early in his}} career in 1944—the robbery of the Duchess of Pratameno. He and his men sneaked into her estate unnoticed, and Giuliano was in her salon before she knew what was occurring. <b>He</b> <b>kissed</b> <b>her</b> hand and showed respect for her noble status, but then demanded all of her jewelry. When she refused, Giuliano threatened to kidnap her children. After she handed the loot over, he took a diamond ring from her hand, which he wore {{for the rest of his}} life, and borrowed John Steinbeck's “In Dubious Battle” from her library before leaving (which was returned with a respectful note a week later). By mid-1945, Giuliano's daring, good looks, and theatrical flair were the talk of Sicily, and soon beyond.|$|E

500|$|Weakened {{by his own}} wounds, Beauchamp {{was loaded}} on a cart {{to be taken to}} the gallows and hanged before he bled to death. He insisted on seeing his wife before being executed, but doctors told him she was not {{severely}} injured and would recover. Beauchamp protested that not being allowed to see his wife was cruel, and the guards consented to take him to her. Upon arriving, he was angered to see that the doctors had lied to him; Anna was too weak even to speak to him. He remained with her until he could no longer feel her pulse. <b>He</b> <b>kissed</b> <b>her</b> lifeless lips and declared [...] "For you I lived [...] for you I die." ...|$|E

500|$|Anne's masques were {{responsible}} for almost all the courtly female performance {{in the first two}} decades of the seventeenth century and are regarded as crucial to the history of women's performance. Anne sometimes performed with her ladies in the masques herself, occasionally offending members of the audience. In The Vision of the Twelve Goddesses of 1604, she played Pallas Athena, wearing a tunic that some observers regarded as too short; in The Masque of Blackness of 1605, Anne performed while six months pregnant, she and her ladies causing scandal by appearing with their skin painted as [...] "blackamores". Letter writer Dudley Carleton reported that when the Queen afterwards danced with the Spanish ambassador, <b>he</b> <b>kissed</b> <b>her</b> hand [...] "though there was danger it would have left a mark upon his lips". Anne commissioned the leading talents of the day to create these masques, including Ben Jonson and Inigo Jones.|$|E
