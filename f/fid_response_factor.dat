40|$|Chlorinated ethenes {{are among}} the most common {{environmental}} contaminants and are known or suspected carcinogens. This class of compounds includes perchloroethene (PCE), trichloroethene (TCE), and their breakdown products, including dichloroethene (DCE) isomers and vinyl chloride (VC). Engineers and scientists must be able to measure concentrations of these chemicals in water samples to assess site contamination, monitor clean-up progress, and test possible remediation technologies. Gas chromatography with flame ionization detection (GC/FID) is a common method for measuring these contaminants in environmental samples. In this study, we tested the hypothesis that FID response factors are equal for all chlorinated ethene compounds. The rationale for the investigation was that if the hypothesis is correct, a single calibration curve can be used for GC/FID analysis of all chlorinated ethene compounds, saving time and money during sample analysis. Based on our measurements, a single calibration curve (FID response versus mass of analyte injected) is applicable to analysis of PCE, TCE, and all three DCE isomers (r 2 = 0. 990, n= 50 measurements), allowing for simplified quantification of those chemicals. However, the apparent <b>FID</b> <b>response</b> <b>factor</b> for VC was lower by ∼ 40 %, indicating that a separate calibration curve would need to be used to accurately estimate the VC concentration in water samples. The difference in the apparent VC response factor is caused predominantly by losses of VC to volatilization during the analysis...|$|E
40|$|The two {{objectives}} {{of this work}} were to develop a simplified method {{for the analysis of}} chlorinated organics in water samples and to improve an existing soil remediation technology. The contaminants considered for these studies were chlorinated hydrocarbons because of their relative frequency of appearance at contaminated sites. The first half of this study involved the analysis of chlorinated ethenes by gas chromatography with flame ionization detection (GC-FID). I tested the hypothesis that the <b>FID</b> <b>response</b> <b>factor</b> is the same for all chlorinated ethene compounds. The rationale for this investigation is that if the hypothesis is correct, a single calibration curve can be used for GC/FID analysis of all chlorinated ethene compounds, saving time and money during sample analysis. Based on my measurements, a single calibration curve fits PCE, TCE, and cis-DCE (R 2 = 0. 998). However, the apparent slope of the calibration curve for vinyl chloride is approximately 45 % lower, indicating that a separate calibration curve must be used to quantify vinyl chloride. I believe this difference in vinyl chloride is due to loss of analyte mass due to volatilization. The second half of the study considered the effect of solvent composition for a soil remediation technology, entitled remedial extraction and catalytic hydrodehalogenation (REACH), developed by Dr. Hun Young Wee and Dr. Jeff Cunningham (Wee and Cunningham, 2008). The objective of this thesis is to convert 1, 2, 4, 5 -tetrachlorobenzene (TeCB) to cyclohexane, thus improving on the work of Wee (2007). Recent work by Osborn (2011) tested successfully the use of palladium and rhodium catalysts for this conversion, though it took twelve hours for full conversion. Osborn (2011) performed her experiments in a 50 : 50 water-ethanol solvent; previous work by Wee and Cunningham (2008) suggests that using a 67 : 33 water-ethanol composition may dramatically reduce the reaction time. Therefore, the goal of this research was to use palladium and rhodium catalysts with a 67 : 33 water-ethanol solvent composition, with an aim of reducing the reaction time required to fully convert benzene to cyclohexane. The data suggest that the time required for conversion of the analyte to its product was improved dramatically compared to previous experiments. However, powdered palladium catalyst was used in this study instead of pellet form as in previous studies. The powdered palladium allowed for full conversion of the target chemical, TeCB, to benzene in less than 5 minutes. Benzene was fully converted to cyclohexane within 45 minutes in the batch reactor when a rhodium catalyst was used jointly with palladium. This study suggests that the 67 : 33 water-ethanol solvent composition be utilized in continuous flow tests in the future to improve the efficiency of the REACH system. The results also suggest that powdered palladium catalyst be considered because of its ability to force the reaction to completion in significantly less time than previous experiments...|$|E
40|$|High {{molecular}} weight (HMW) hydrocarbons (defined herein as C 35 + compounds) {{are difficult to}} characterise by conventional analytical methods. Very few studies have reported precise and reproducible quantification of such compounds in fossil fuels. Nonetheless, such components have important effects on the physical and biological fate of fossil fuels in the geosphere. For example, the phase behaviour of waxy gas condensates is significantly affected by the varying proportions of HMW compounds. Similarly HMW compounds are amongst the most resistant petroleum components to biodegradation. The current study reports the development of reproducible quantitative high temperature capillary gas chromatography (HTCGC) methods for studying both these aspects of the chemistry of HMW hydrocarbons. In addition those hydrocarbons which remain unresolved when analysed by gas chromatography (so called unresolved complex mixtures UCMs) are also studied. UCMs may account for {{a large portion of}} the hydrocarbons in many fossil fuels yet very little is known about their composition. Knowledge of these compounds may be important in enhancing the prediction of phase behaviour. Oxidative degradation and GC-MS is used to elucidate the types of structures present within the UCM. The concentrations of C 3 S 4 h. ydrocarbons in two unusually waxy gas condensates from high temperature wells in the North Sea were determined by HTCGC. The whole C, 5 + fraction comprised about 20 % of the total hydrocarbons and consisted of compounds with carbon numbers extending up to and beyond Coo. By paying particular attention to sample dissolution and injection, good reproducibility and precision were obtained. For example, for authentic n-C, to n-C 60 alkanes a relative standard deviation of under 5 % for manual injection, linear response factors (1. 01 Cm to 0. 99 C 6), and a linear calibration for 5 ng to 25 ng on-column were found. Limits of detection are reported for the first time for HMW n-alkanes. The limits were found to be as low as 0. 8 ng for Cto to 1. 87 ng for C 60. Tristearin is proposed as a suitable HTCGC internal standard for quantification since the <b>FID</b> <b>response</b> <b>factor</b> (1. 1) was close to that of the HMW n-alkanes and response was linear. Importantly, when co-injected with the two waxy North Sea condensates, tristearin was adequately separated from the closest eluting alkanes, n-C 59 and n-C 60 under normal operating conditions. Qualitative characterisation of the HMW compounds in the waxy gas condensates and in synthetic wax blends (polywax 1000) using HTCGC-EI MS and HTCGC-CI MS produced molecular ions or pseudo molecular ions for n-alkanes up to n- C 6 o. The spectra of some HMW compounds contained fragment ions characteristic of branched compounds but detailed characterisation was very limited. This study has also shown, for the first time, the significance of the unresolved complex mixture in gas condensatesU.

Thesew ere found to be between 64 to 97 % unresolved after molecular sieving (5 A) and urea adduction. The UCMs were oxidised using CrO 3 /AcOHw hich produced 5 - 12 % C 02, and 55 - 83 % dichloromethane-solublep roducts. Thus 65 - 94 % of the original UCMs were accounted for as oxidation products. The remainder were thought to be water soluble acids which could not be determined in the presence of the AcOH reagent. Of the recovered oxidised products, 27 - 81 % were resolved and these comprised mainly n-monocarboxylic acids (19 - 48 %). The average chain length was found to be C 12 indicating the average length of alkyl groups. Branched acids, ketones, ketoacids, ndicarboxylic acids, branched dicarboxylic acids, lactones, isoprenoid acids, alkylcyclohexane carboxylic acids and toluic acids accounted for the majority of the remaining resolved products.

Overall, oxidation provided structural information for about half of the UCM. HTCGC was also used to measure the biodegradability of HMW alkanes in a waxy Indonesian oil. Traditional alkane isolation techniques (TLC and CC) discriminated against HMW compounds above C 40 whereas adsorption onto alumina in a warm cyclohexane slurry provided an aliphatic fraction still rich in HMW compounds and suitable as a biodegradation substrate. A waxy Indonesian oil was subjected to 136 day biodegradation by Pseudomonas fluorescens. Extraction efficiencies of over 90 % (RSD < 5 %) were obtained for n-alkanes up to C 6 o using continuous liquid-liquid extraction. Over 80 % of the oil aliphatic fraction was degraded within 14 days. After 136 days only 14 % of the original aliphatic fraction remained, yet surprisingly no decreases in the concentrations of compounds above C 45 were observed. However, the use of a rapid screening biodegradation method proved conclusively that Pseudomonasfluorescens was capable of utilising n-alkanes up to C 60 once the bacteria had acclimated to the HMW alkanes. This is the first report of bacterial utilisation of an n-alkane as large as C. ...|$|E

40|$|We {{describe}} an experimental sq stem and techniques for sampling and analyzing biogenic emissions of {{volatile organic compounds}} (VOC). The system uses a Teflon chamber to enclose a single branch of a tree. Temperature, photosynthetic active radiation (PAR), relative humidity and carbon dioxide concentration are continuously monitored with a time resolution of five minutes. VOCs are sampled on tubes containing solid adsorbents (Tenax TA and Carbotrap) with a time resolution of 1 h. Composition and concentration of VOC emissions are measured with a gas chromatographic system equipped with a flame ionization detector (FID) for quantitative and a mass spectrometer (MS) for qualitative analysis. To calibrate the system, a diffusion source was built to produce standard mixtures of up to 36 different compounds with mixing ratios at low concentrations and high accuracy. The diffusion rates were monitored over 17 months and shelved variations between 0. 2 and 7. 6 % for monoterpenes (expect for alpha -phellandrene, alpha -terpinene and gamma -terpinene) and between 10. 6 and 22. 6 % for sesquiterpenes. <b>FID</b> <b>response</b> <b>factors</b> calculated from calibration measurements were corrected using correction factors based on the effective carbon number concept.

40|$|An intercomparison {{exercise}} of the world-harmonized light-duty vehicle test procedure (WLTP) aiming at measuring ethanol, formaldehyde and acetaldehyde emissions from a flex-fuel light-duty vehicle using E 85 was conducted in the Vehicle Emission Laboratory (VELA) at the European Commission Joint Research Centre (EC-JRC), Ispra, Italy. The instruments used during the intercomparison allowed online measurements of these compounds directly from the diluted exhaust. Measurements were done either in real time or immediately after the test. The measurement and analysis of exhaust emissions over the world-harmonized light-duty vehicle test cycle was done by means of Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy (FTIR), proton transfer reaction-mass spectrometry (PTR-Qi-ToF-MS), photoacoustic spectroscopy (PAS) and gas chromatography (GC). Results showed that online systems can perform measurements from the vehicle diluted exhaust assuring a good repeatability (within instrument variance) and reproducibility (between instrument variance) of the results. Measurements from all the instruments were in good agreement (|Z-score| < 2). Results showed that online systems can perform measurements from the vehicle diluted exhaust assuring the reproducibility and repeatability of the results. Results obtained measuring at the tailpipe using a FTIR were in good agreement with those acquired measuring at the constant volume sampler (CVS).

40|$|Biogenic {{volatile}} organic compounds (BVOCs) are emitted into the atmosphere by plants and include isoprene, monoterpenes, sesquiterpenes, and their oxygenated derivatives. These BVOCs are among the principal factors influencing the oxidative capacity of the atmosphere in forested regions.

One of the most commonly used detectors in chromatographic analysis is the flame ionization detector (FID). For quantitative analysis with an <b>FID,</b> relative <b>response</b> <b>factors</b> may be estimated using the effective carbon number (ECN) concept. The {{purpose of this study was}} to determine the ECN for a variety of terpenoid compounds to enable improved quantification of BVOC measurements.

For each experiment using this system, one terpene standard was co-injected with an internal reference, n-octane, and analyzed via an automated cryofocusing system interfaced to a gas chromatograph flame ionization detector and mass spectrometer (GC/MS/FID). The ECNs of 16 compounds (14 BVOCs) were evaluated with this approach, with each test compound analyzed at least three times. The difference between the actual carbon number and measured ECN ranged from − 24 % to − 2 %. The difference between theoretical ECN and measured ECN ranged from − 22 % to 9 %.

These responses are calculated from respective solutions of each ester and the four compounds, hexadecane, toluene, tetralin, and naphthalene, as used for the D 5186 <b>response</b> <b>factor</b> mixture...|$|R

40|$|This work {{deals with}} the study of an {{improved}} thin-layer chromatographic-flame-ionization detection (TLC-FID) system (using the newer configuration of the detector, an automatic sample spotter, and a careful selection of the operating parameters) in the quantitative hydrocarbon group type analysis of a deasphalted heavy oil from petroleum and its derived hydrocracking products. The separation method proposed allows for the detection and quantitation of saturates, alkylaromatics, aromatics, polars, and an uneluted fraction. The repeatability of the experiments has always been better {{than that of the}} ASTM D 2007 standard for each fraction. It is not affected by application volumes or concentration in the studied ranges. Results from the absolute calibration method and from a variety of the internal normalization procedures are comparable, although the latter is faster and allows a rapid determination of the linear range of the detector. Factors such as eluent development length or application spot size do not influence the <b>FID</b> <b>response</b> of our samples under the studied conditions. Likewise, the behavior of the detector is linear with mass in the range studied for each separated fraction...|$|R
40|$|The {{quantitative}} study of noncovalent complexes by electrospray mass spectrometry requires {{the determination of}} the relative response of each species. The method proposed here to determine the electrospray <b>response</b> <b>factors</b> is based on the use of (1) an internal standard and (2) the mass balance equation applied to one binding partner M, for which different complexes MxLy are detected in the electrospray mass spectra. A set of experiments providing various ratios between the complexes (e. g. different ligand concentrations in a titration experiment or different time points in a kinetics experiment) is used to generate a set of independent linear equations that can be solved using simple matrix algebra to find the <b>response</b> <b>factors</b> of each MxLy complex relative to that of the internal standard. The <b>response</b> <b>factors</b> can then be used to determine equilibrium dissociation constants or for the quantitative monitoring of reaction kinetics. The first is illustrated with a study of DNA-ligand complexes, where we show that neither minor groove binding nor intercalation dramatically affects the DNA <b>response</b> <b>factor.</b> The second is illustrated with a study of the association kinetics of the telomeric G-quadruplex dGGG(TTAGGG) 3 with its complementary strand, where the <b>response</b> <b>factors</b> allow correcting for the relative response of the quadruplex and the long duplex and obtaining reproducible association rate constants independently of the source tuning potentials.
