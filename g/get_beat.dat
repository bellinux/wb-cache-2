5|$|The {{elements}} of the episode involving Kyle's loneliness as a Jew during Christmas were inspired by Parker and Stone's perceptions of Jews growing up in Colorado during their childhood. Although the two went to different schools, they both witnessed Jewish children <b>get</b> <b>beat</b> up and bullied because both of their schools had very few Jewish students to begin with; although Stone himself is Jewish, he was not raised as a practicing Jew {{and so he did}} not experience much of the bullying himself firsthand. The unsuccessful efforts by the South Park Elementary School in the episode to include people of non-Christian denomination were inspired by similarly failed attempts Parker and Stone witnessed growing up. Parker cited as an example a chorus concert in which the single Jewish student was asked to sing her own Hanukkah song while everybody else sang Christmas songs; although the idea was to make the student feel special, Parker said it only made her feel more lonely and isolated.|$|E
500|$|Edwards {{appeared}} in Victory Lane {{in front of}} the crowd of 153,000 people to celebrate his second victory of the season, earning him $425,675. He was pleased with the result, saying it was [...] "a very special win" [...] and that he felt he was close to the form he had achieved in 2005: [...] "I tried hard to stay calm. And I'm not the best at it sometimes. We all know that." [...] He added, [...] "We do this to win. Winning these races is the greatest. Winning a championship would be the ultimate. What we’re trying to do is win the championship this year. That’s our number-one goal.” Second-place finisher Earnhardt was disappointed, saying he had his car in his chosen position but the red-flag period prevented him from winning the race: [...] "Carl wasn't going to <b>get</b> <b>beat</b> today. He had it in the bag. He was so strong... I was terrible on cold tires. I wish all of you knew what that felt like. I hate it." [...] Biffle was philosophical as he argued that he had the fastest car but did not gain the track position he needed to challenge Edwards because he slid on pit road.|$|E
500|$|Hamlin, who {{finished}} second, said [...] "Hats off to Mike (Ford, crew chief) {{and this whole}} FedEx Office Camry team. We {{have a really good}} car, we just had to learn to stay in the pits. We just lost too many spots on pit road that we couldn't overcome that track position. I was trying to make something happen and got in the wall which ended up killing our car. The good part about that is I was able to save fuel because there was no pressure from behind. I was able to save fuel and our Camry got the best fuel mileage it got all day." [...] Kyle Busch's crew chief Dave Rogers said of his drivers' performance, [...] "I think he handled it well -- it's tough. You lead all these laps and he could have gone for the clean sweep this weekend -- win all three in a row. He deserved to win all three in a row and to <b>get</b> <b>beat</b> -- it's tough.", he continued, [...] "We're disappointed -- this Toyota deserved to be in Victory Lane. I thought we had one of the best cars throughout the entire race, but it just didn't work out that way. We were a little short on fuel." ...|$|E

500|$|Bart {{is portrayed}} as a popular cool boy and has many friends at school. Out {{of all of them}} his best friend is Milhouse Van Houten, {{although}} Bart has at times shown embarrassment about their friendship. Bart is a bad influence on Milhouse, and the two have been involved in a lot of mischief together. Because of this behavior, Milhouse's mother forbids Milhouse from playing with Bart in [...] "Homer Defined" [...] (season three, 1991). While at first he pretended that he did not care, Bart eventually realizes that he needs Milhouse, and Marge manages to convince Mrs. Van Houten to reconsider. Milhouse is a frequent target for local bullies Nelson Muntz and his friends Jimbo, Dolph, and Kearney. At times, Bart also [...] finds himself at the hands of their abuse. Despite being the more socially powerful of the two, Bart's social popularity has temporarily subsided various episodes either due to extreme embarrassment caused by his family or other people (or even himself) or an unfortunate coincidence. Milhouse describes their social standing as [...] "Three and a half. We <b>get</b> <b>beat</b> up, but we get an explanation." [...] While Bart and the bullies have been adversaries at times, with Bart once declaring war on Nelson, the school bullies actually like Bart for his ways and hang out with him at times, especially Nelson who eventually becomes close friends with him.|$|E
500|$|As the {{defending}} champion at the World Championship for the first time, O'Sullivan sought to turn his recent bad form around and break the Crucible curse. O'Sullivan defeated Drew Henry 10–5 in the first round, Robert Milkins 13–2 in the second round, and Stephen Lee 13–10 in the quarter-finals {{to advance to the}} semi-finals where he faced Stephen Hendry. In a pre-match interview, O'Sullivan revealed that he had [...] "no respect" [...] for Hendry, referring to an incident during O'Sullivan's 13–17 semi-final defeat to Hendry three years prior, when the referee had awarded a miss that O'Sullivan felt Hendry should not have accepted. He further added that he wanted [...] "to send [...] back home to Scotland" [...] to stop one of his former manager's players from winning the tournament, and that [...] "I know if I do <b>get</b> <b>beat</b> and [...] comes up and does a moonie {{in front of me and}} goes 'Ne ne ne', I'll just look at him and say 'well done' and say 'go back to your sad little life'.". In the match O'Sullivan took a 5–3 overnight lead after the first session, but Hendry fought back to level at 12–12 before the final session. Hendry subsequently outplayed O'Sullivan winning the semi-final 17 frames to 13. After the match, Hendry said it wasn't [...] "personal" [...] for him and he didn't remember the incident O'Sullivan described. O'Sullivan was unapologetic about the comments he made, saying it made a [...] "better atmosphere" [...] and [...] "what's better than a grudge match?".|$|E
500|$|Yankee outfielder Bob Cerv {{recalled}} of the rivalry, [...] "I {{always remember}} the games when Pierce and Ford would lock up. Those were great ballgames – 2–1, 3–2. Usually, if they'd <b>get</b> <b>beat,</b> Mantle would {{hit a home}} run." [...] New York outfielder Hank Bauer noted, [...] "The guy who gave me the most problem – I know he gave 'em to me, and I think he gave 'em {{to most of us}} – was Billy Pierce." [...] Tommy Byrne, who pitched for the Yankees for most of his career from 1943 to 1957 but played for Chicago {{for the first half of}} the 1953 season, said, [...] "Pierce was sneaky fast, a good breaking ball. He was tough. For several years there he was right up there on a par with Ford." [...] Sportswriter Bill Madden recalled in 1982, [...] "Always it was Pierce against Whitey Ford and always, to me, that seemed like an unfair matchup. They were your classic 'stylish' left-handers, equal in guile and guts, but Ford had those howitzers of Mickey Mantle, Yogi Berra, Bill Skowron and Hank Bauer behind him, while Pierce came armed with popguns. Nellie Fox, Luis Aparicio and Minnie Miñoso supported him with hustle and chink singles and I always marveled at the fact that Pierce could duel Ford on even terms despite those odds." [...] Ironically, the Yankees tried to acquire Pierce in the early 1950s when Ford was in the military, but White Sox general manager Frank Lane proposed that New York give up Bauer, first baseman Joe Collins and second baseman Jerry Coleman in exchange for Pierce and outfielder Al Zarilla, and ended talks when Yankees GM George Weiss suggested the Yankees send minor leaguers instead.|$|E

2500|$|As well, the hip hop music {{community}} {{has been criticized for}} its homophobia and transphobia. Hip hop song lyrics contain offensive, homophobic slurs (most popularly, the pejorative term [...] "faggot") and sometimes violent threats towards queer people, such as rapper DMX's [...] "Where the Hood At," [...] rapper Eazy-E's [...] "Nobody Move," [...] rap group Brand Nubian's [...] "Punks Jump Up to <b>Get</b> <b>Beat</b> Down". Many rappers and hip hop artists have advocated homophobia and/or transphobia. These artists include Ja Rule, who in an interview claimed,"We need to go step to MTV and Viacom, and let's talk about all these fucking shows that they have on MTV that is promoting homosexuality, that my kids can’t watch this shit," [...] and rap artist Erick Sermon, who has said publicly," [...] will never accept transgender rappers." [...] Until the 2010s, hip hop music has excluded the lesbian, gay, bisexual and transgender (LGBT) community. This has perpetuated a culture in hip hop that is prejudiced towards queer and trans people, making it a tough culture for queer artists to participate in. Despite this prejudice, some queer/genderqueer rappers and hip hop artists have become successful and popular in the 2010s. One of the more notable members of the LGBT community in hip hop is Frank Ocean, who came out in 2012 and has released critically acclaimed albums and won two Grammy Awards. Other successful queer hip hop/rap artists include female bisexual rapper Azealia Banks, pansexual androgynous rapper and singer Angel Haze, lesbian rapper Siya, and genderqueer rapper Mykki Blanco.|$|E
2500|$|In 1974 EMLL {{founder and}} owner Salvador Lutteroth brought his son into the promotion, {{grooming}} {{him to take}} over when the aging Lutteroth, Sr. eventually had to retire. This action combined with a very rigid and conservative promotional philosophy led EMLL's Promoter in Naucalpan, Mexico State, Francisco Flores, EMLL wrestler and trainer Ray Mendoza and investor Benjamin Mora, Jr. {{to break away from}} EMLL to form their own company called the Universal Wrestling Association. With the impending change of management in EMLL many wrestlers who had previously been loyal to Lutteroth decided to leave with Flores, Mendoza and Mora including promoters René and Karloff Lagarde as well as number of young wrestles, including El Canek who were frustrated with the lack of opportunities in EMLL. They held their first show on January 29, 1975 with El Canek teaming up with former rivals Dory Dixon and Sunny War Cloud to lose the semi-main event to the team of Mil Máscaras, Ray Mendoza and El Solitario. One of the early draws in the UWA was Mil Máscaras, but he began taking more and more bookings in both the United States and Japan, leaving little time for the UWA between tours, coupled with the age of two of the most recognizable wrestlers in the UWA, Mendoza and Guajardo, the UWA bookers were looking to create new headliners, with the two front runners being the tecnico (wrestling term for those that portray the [...] "good guys") Dos Caras (brother of Mil Máscaras) and El Canek who played the part of a brutal, cheating rudo (those that portray the [...] "bad guys") El Canek. The UWA decided to have El Canek defeat Dr. Wagner to win the Mexican National Light Heavyweight Championship on January 15, 1978. The title run was used to build a storyline feud between El Canek and Dos Caras as Caras was immediately positioned as the next challenger and actually won the championship from El Canek on June 20, 1978 During the feud the fans responded favorably [...] to the two wrestlers as each played their part to perfection, the physically imposing El Canek used his strength to dominate and gloat his way to becoming a rudo that the fans would gladly pay admission to see <b>get</b> <b>beat</b> up while Dos Caras became the quintessential tecnico, the hero of the people who overcame the odds and defeated the bad guys, while also being a very talented wrestler.|$|E

So I wanna get that old feeling back that I do naturally. I'm not necessarily trying to bring gangsta rap back. I'm just trying to let you know it's still here and I'm a part of it. I feel like I'm the only one out of the coast that's doing this gangsta rap shit the way that it used to be done...how niggas used to put detail in their music, not just going to the club and turning up." [...] Schoolboy Q said {{that he is going to}} bring that style in Oxymoron: [...] "I'm just telling my story and what I grew up around and what I seen and what I did and I wanna put that in the light instead of everybody just smiling.
