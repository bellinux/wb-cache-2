40|$|In the {{psychological}} literature {{little has been}} written about the use <b>of</b> <b>humor</b> in therapy. Especially lacking is empirical data regarding the topic. In the current study I investigated the relationship between a personality characteristic, <b>sense</b> <b>of</b> <b>humor,</b> and the amount <b>of</b> <b>humor</b> used by a therapist in a mock therapy session. A 2 x 3 factorial design was implemented with participant's <b>sense</b> <b>of</b> <b>humor</b> and the amount <b>of</b> <b>humor</b> used by the therapist being the independent variables. I hypothesized that a moderate amount <b>of</b> <b>humor</b> would result in more positive ratings of the therapist than either the low or high humor conditions. I also hypothesized that participants who had a <b>greater</b> <b>sense</b> <b>of</b> <b>humor</b> would rate the therapist more positively. Results revealed a partial confirmation of the hypotheses. The greatest amount <b>of</b> <b>humor</b> used by the therapist resulted in decreased ratings of the therapist for a measure <b>of</b> appropriateness <b>of</b> <b>humor</b> and a measure of warmth and empathy. Also, the therapist who used the most humor was rated significantly less rigid and dull than the therapist who used no humor. Suggestions forfuture research in the area are given.

500|$|As a person, Kubrick was {{described}} by Norman Lloyd as [...] "a very dark, sort of a glowering type who was very serious". Marisa Berenson, who starred in Barry Lyndon fondly recalled: [...] "There was great tenderness in {{him and he was}} passionate about his work. What was striking was his enormous intelligence, but he also had a <b>great</b> <b>sense</b> <b>of</b> <b>humor.</b> He was a very shy person and self-protective, but he was filled with the thing that drove him twenty-four hours of the day." [...] Kubrick was particularly fond of machines and technical equipment, to the point that his wife Christiane once stated that [...] "Stanley would be happy with eight tape recorders and one pair of pants". Although Kubrick had obtained a pilot's license in August 1947, some have claimed that he later developed a fear of flying, stemming from an incident in the early 1950s when a colleague had been killed in a plane crash. Kubrick had been sent the charred remains of his camera and notebooks which, according to Duncan, traumatized him for life. Kubrick also had a strong mistrust of doctors and medicine, especially those he did not know, and on one occasion he had a dentist from the Bronx flown to London to treat him.|$|E
500|$|Upon the {{suggestion}} of Universal Studios, Roach cast De Niro {{in the role of}} Jack Byrnes due to critical acclaim of De Niro's recent comedy work in films such as Analyze This and in the live-action/animated film The Adventures of Rocky and Bullwinkle. De Niro's character Jack Byrnes is Pam's father and a retired CIA operative who is overly protective of his family and has a hard time warming up to his daughters' love interests. The script was not written with De Niro in mind as Jack Byrnes; the first draft of the script was completed in 1996, three years before De Niro appeared in Analyze This. However, shortly after De Niro finished filming The Adventures of Rocky and Bullwinkle, Universal suggested to Roach that he should cast De Niro for the role to which Roach agrees that he had [...] "no reservations whatsoever." [...] In an interview with Entertainment Weekly, De Niro stated that he was in active pursuit of comedic roles since Analyze This. Admitting that he had initial reservations about starring in Meet the Parents, De Niro said that he felt [...] "pushed into it" [...] due to insistence by Jane Rosenthal—De Niro's partner in TriBeCa Productions who also acted as one of the producers of Meet the Parents. Screenwriter Jim Herzfeld and director Jay Roach both confirmed that, after committing to the project and reviewing the script, Robert De Niro was actually the person {{who came up with the}} idea for the famous polygraph test scene. Asked about working with De Niro given the serious nature of his previous roles, Ben Stiller said that [...] "it was a little bit intimidating working with De Niro" [...] but that he [...] "has a <b>great</b> <b>sense</b> <b>of</b> <b>humor</b> and I think that's the biggest surprise about him." ...|$|E
500|$|Musicians Kid Rock and Joe C. guest {{starred in}} the episode as themselves, {{performing}} at the annual spring break concert that Homer sneaks out to attend. When Joe C. makes his first appearance on stage in the episode, Homer mistakes him for a child that has lost his parents. After performing his song [...] "Bawitdaba", Kid Rock tells the audience {{that he is going}} to pour out forty gallons of malt liquor on the curb as a way of showing respect to his homies that could not make it to the concert. When Homer hears this he starts to drink the malt liquor. Just as Kid Rock and Joe C. are about to stop him by hurling Joe C. (now wearing a spiked helmet) at him with a slingshot, the sheriff arrives and settles the situation. Scully said in an interview with the Detroit Free Press that the staff of the show chose Kid Rock and Joe C. for the episode because the two [...] "have a lot of stage presence" [...] and visually are [...] "a funny combination," [...] and because the staff thought [...] "they would be funny playing off Homer." [...] According to Scully, the two musicians [...] "had a <b>great</b> <b>sense</b> <b>of</b> <b>humor</b> [...] about themselves," [...] with Kid Rock asking if [...] "he could add a couple of his own lines. He wanted to introduce himself as 'the pimp of the nation.' We kept that in the show. It's quite a title." [...] Kid Rock recorded some of his dialog over the phone, but also paid a 45-minute visit to the Simpsons studio in Los Angeles to record lines. Scully thought it looked like the singer enjoyed the experience and was surprised to see that he arrived on time. [...] "My first reaction to that was, 'What kind of rock star is this?'," [...] Scully jokingly told the Detroit Free Press. All of Joe C.'s lines were recorded over the phone.|$|E

60|$|On {{holidays}} {{this routine}} of Tonelli's life was varied. In the forenoon {{he went to}} mass at St. Mark's, to see the beauty and fashion of the city; and {{then he took a}} walk with his four or five young friends, or went with them to play at bowls, or even made an excursion to the main land, where they hired a carriage, and all those Venetians got into it, like so many seamen, and drove the horse with as little mercy {{as if he had been}} a sail-boat. At seven o'clock Tonelli dined with the notary, next whom he sat at table, and for whom his quaint pleasantries had a zest that inspired the Paronsina and her mother to shout them into his dull ears, that he might lose none of them. He laughed a kind of faded laugh at them, and, rubbing his pale hands together, showed by his act that he did not think his best wine too good for his kindly guest. The signora feigned to take the same delight shown by her father and daughter in Tonelli's drolleries; but I doubt if she had a <b>great</b> <b>sense</b> <b>of</b> his <b>humor,</b> or, indeed, cared anything for it save as she perceived that it gave pleasure to those she loved. Otherwise, however, she had a sincere regard for him, for he was most useful and devoted to her in her quality of widowed mother; and if she could not feel wit, she could feel gratitude, which is perhaps the rarer gift, if not the more respectable.|$|R

But he is sweet and kind, as the American men so often are, and he thinks his wife is the delightfulest creature in the world, as the American husband nearly always does. They have several times asked me to dine with them en famille; and, as a matter of form, he keeps me a little while with him after dinner, when she has left the table, and smokes his cigar, after wondering why we do not smoke in Altruria; but I can see that he is impatient to get to her in their drawing-room, where we find her reading a book in the crimson light of the canopied lamp, and where he presently falls silent, perfectly happy to be near her. The drawing-room is of a good size itself, and it has a room opening out of it called the library, with a case of books in it, and Mrs. Makely's piano-forte. The place is rather too richly and densely rugged, and there is rather more curtaining and shading of the windows than we should like; but Mrs. Makely is too well up-to-date, as she would say, to have much of the bric-à-brac about which she tells me used to clutter people's houses here. There are some pretty good pictures on the walls, and a few vases and bronzes, and she says she has produced a greater effect of space by quelling the furniture--she means, having few pieces and having them as small as possible. There is a little stand with her afternoon tea-set in one corner, and there is a pretty writing-desk in the library; I remember a sofa and some easy-chairs, but not too many of them. She has a table near one of the windows, with books and papers on it. She tells me that she sees herself that the place is kept just as she wishes it, for she has rather a passion for neatness, and you never can trust servants not to stand the books on their heads or study a vulgar symmetry in the arrangements. She never allows them in there, she says, except when they are at work under her eye; and she never allows anybody there except her guests, and her husband after he has smoked. Of course, her dog must be there; and one evening after her husband fell asleep in the arm-chair near her, the dog fell asleep on the fleece at her feet, and we heard them softly breathing in unison. She made a pretty little mocking mouth when the sound first became audible, and said that she ought really to have sent Mr. Makely out with the dog, for the dog ought to have the air every day, and she had been kept indoors; but sometimes Mr. Makely came home from business so tired that she hated to send him out, even for the dog's sake, though he was so apt to become dyspeptic. [...] "They won't let you have dogs in some of the apartment-houses, but I tore up the first lease that had that clause in it, and I told Mr. Makely that I would rather live in a house all my days than any flat where my dog wasn't as welcome as I was. Of course, they're rather troublesome." ...|$|R

500|$|The {{animated}} series {{received a}} generally positive reception in North America. [...] In January 2004, Yu Yu Hakusho {{was named the}} second best action-adventure anime by Anime Insider. It was voted by the users of IGN as the tenth best animated series of all time. Critical reviews focused on the series' attempt at a versatile balance of narrative, character development, and action sequences. Animerica's Justin Kovalsky defined Yu Yu Hakusho as a character-driven series and compared it to other anime like Phantom Quest Corp., Rurouni Kenshin, and Flame of Recca in that it successfully combines different ideas such as martial arts battles, character dynamics, the supernatural, and mythology. Allen Divers of the Anime News Network identified Yu Yu Hakusho as [...] "one of the best action series out there", and noted consistently good storytelling and character development throughout his critique of key points of the series. Todd Douglass Jr. of DVD Talk declared, [...] "It's a fun show with a <b>great</b> cast, a <b>sense</b> <b>of</b> <b>humor,</b> {{and a lot of}} action so there's no excuse not to at least give it a chance." [...] He recommended the first three-season box sets of Yu Yu Hakusho, as well as the original boxset of the Three Kings Saga, but enjoyed the show's third season more than the others because of its multiple plotlines. N. S. Davidson of IGN concluded that having several concurrent plot branches is not enough for an anime to succeed, but that good writing, interesting characters, and action are also necessary. He proclaimed in his review of the anime's final episodes that Yu Yu Hakusho possesses all of these qualities. This was concurred upon by Joseph Luster of Otaku USA, who summed up his feelings about the universe of Yu Yu Hakusho by stating, [...] "Togashi's world is eternally hellish and dark, but wildly varied. The only thing that doesn't change throughout its run is the fact that you'll still be rooting for the well-defined protagonists until the credits run on the last episode." ...|$|R
40|$|The {{present study}} {{examined}} the relationship <b>of</b> <b>sense</b> <b>of</b> <b>humor</b> to affect and coping with humor ability. The participants were 147 Introductory Psychology students from Ball State University. Participants first took the Situational Humor Response Questionnaire (SHRQ: Martin & Lefcourt, 1984), then observed 1 of 3 videos (i. e., sad, neutral, or humorous), which was then followed by the Coping with Humor Scale (CHS: Martin & Lefcourt, 1983) and the Multiple Affect Adjective Check List (MAACL: Zuckerman & Lubin, 1965). The results indicate that <b>sense</b> <b>of</b> <b>humor</b> is inversely related to depression and hostility regardless of video condition but not with anxiety. Low <b>sense</b> <b>of</b> <b>humor</b> participants were influenced greatly {{as a function of}} the video condition but the high <b>sense</b> <b>of</b> <b>humor</b> paticipants were not.

40|$|Gerald D. Schmidt {{was born}} March 12, 1934 in Greeley, Colorado. After {{finishing}} his undergraduate degree in Biology at Colorado College in Greeley (now the University of Northern Colorado) Dr. Schmidt {{went on to}} receive his masters degree from Colorado State University (CSU) in 1962 and his Ph. D. in 1964 also from CSU. While At CSU he worked under Dr. O. W. Olsen, first on the helminth parasites of the common snipe, and then, for his doctorate, he studied the embryological development of the Acanthocephala. He {{became a member of}} the faculty of UNC in Greeley In 1966. His collaboration with Dr. R. E. Kuntz of the US NAMRU- 2 in Taiwan on long-term studies of zoonoses resulted in a large number of publications which increased our knowledge of the biodiversity of the South Pacific region. His many masters and doctoral students have dispersed to all points of the globe and many continue to publish on biodiversity and the systematics of parasites. The thorny-headed worms were his primary focus of study and, despite a lack of institutional support at UNC for such a scientist, he published more than 160 articles in systematics and parasitology. Included in this extensive series are the books Essentials of Parasitology (Wm. C. Brown. 1988), How to Know the Tapeworms (Brown Co., 1970), Handbook of Tapeworm Identification (CRC Press, 1986) and Foundations of Parasitology (with Larry Roberts, Mosby, 1989, four editions.). He was also editor of an influential and forward-looking book entitled Problems in Systematics of Parasites (University Park Press, 1969). Gerald D. Schmidt was honored for his achievements in science and systematics of parasites at a young age by the American Society of Parasitologists with the Henry Baldwin Ward medal and was a board member of the World Federation of Parasitologists, a Fellow of the Royal Society of Tropical Medicine and Hygiene, London, and a Fellow of the Royal Society of South Australia. As a professor at the University of Northern Colorado, he established the local chapter of Sigma Xi, the Scientific Research Society, and served as its first president; he was also a co-founder of the Rocky Mountain Conference of Parasitologists. He served as Secretary-Treasurer of the American Society of Parasitologists during a period of financial and structural rebuilding of the society from 1982 - 1987.
