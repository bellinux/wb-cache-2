50|$|Repeater: A {{repeater}} accepts content, decrypts it, then re-encrypts and retransmits the data. It may perform some signal processing, such as upconverting video into a higher-resolution format, or splitting out {{the audio}} {{portion of the}} signal. Repeaters have <b>HDMI</b> <b>inputs</b> and outputs. Examples include home theater audio-visual receivers that separate and amplify the audio signal, while re-transmitting the video for display on a TV. A repeater could also simply send the input data stream to multiple outputs for simultaneous display on several screens.|$|R

50|$|XBR is Sony’s highest {{performance}} series of BRAVIA LCD, OLED, and formerly, Trinitron CRT and WEGA Plasma televisions featuring advanced features and progressive industrial design. According to Sony, XBR is {{an acronym for}} eXtended Bit Rate, although {{there is evidence that}} it originally stood for “Project X, Black Remote” which was supposed to set it apart from the then-standard line of Sony televisions. The XBR range is typically derived from equipment that has been released in Japan and Europe as mid and high-end models, usually with some small upgrades. For example, in Europe and Japan, the Sony X-Series 1080p TVs had two <b>HDMI</b> <b>inputs,</b> whereas on the American XBR version, there were three. An XBR may cost up to US$25,000.|$|R

5|$|According to In-Stat, {{the number}} of HDMI devices sold was 5 million in 2004, 17.4 million in 2005, 63 million in 2006, and 143 million in 2007. HDMI has become the de facto {{standard}} for HDTVs, and according to In-Stat, around 90% of digital televisions in 2007 included HDMI. In-Stat has estimated that 229 million HDMI devices were sold in 2008. On April 8, 2008 there were over 850 consumer electronics and PC companies that had adopted the HDMI specification (HDMI adopters). On January 7, 2009, HDMI Licensing, LLC announced that HDMI had reached an installed base of over 600 million HDMI devices.

5|$|From a user's perspective, an HDMI display can {{be driven}} by a single-link DVI-D source, since HDMI and DVI-D define an {{overlapping}} minimum set of allowed resolutions and framebuffer formats to ensure a basic level of interoperability. In the reverse case a DVI-D monitor {{would have the same}} level of basic interoperability unless there are content protection issues with High-bandwidth Digital Content Protection (HDCP) or the HDMI color encoding is in component color space YCbCr which is not possible in DVI, instead of RGB. An HDMI source such as a Blu-ray player may demand HDCP-compliance of the display, and refuse to output HDCP-protected content to a non-compliant display. A further complication {{is that there is a}} small amount of display equipment, such as some high-end home theater projectors, designed with <b>HDMI</b> <b>inputs</b> but not HDCP-compliant.|$|R

5000|$|A few manufacturers, notably Sony and Panasonic, have {{implemented}} wireless connection {{technology for the}} surround speakers in this class of equipment. This technology may be available as standard {{with some of the}} high-priced models or may be supplied as an aftermarket kit that only works with selected models in the manufacturer's range. It usually manifests in a line-level feed over a proprietary wireless link to a separate power amplifier used for the surround-sound channels. This link-receiver and power amplifier can be built into one of the surround speakers or housed in a black box that the surround speakers are connected to. Some higher-end HTIB models offer additional features such as 1080i or 4k ( [...] mainly versions with Blu-ray) video resolution upscaling, a 5-disc platter, <b>HDMI</b> <b>inputs,</b> USB connectivity, Bluetooth support, Wifi support, internet apps, DAB and DAB+, mirroring possibility, iPod dock and a hard disk.|$|R

These more limiting copy protection technologies will all start after analog broadcasting ends (when there won't be any choice for viewers).
