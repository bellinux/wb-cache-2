500|$|The death verdict against Kesselring {{unleashed}} {{a storm of}} protest in the United Kingdom. Former British Prime Minister Winston Churchill immediately branded it as too harsh and intervened in favour of Kesselring. Field Marshal Alexander, now Governor General of Canada, sent a telegram to Prime Minister Clement Attlee in which he expressed his hope that Kesselring's sentence would be commuted. [...] "As his old opponent on the battlefield", he stated, [...] "I have no complaints against him. Kesselring and his soldiers fought against us hard but clean." [...] Alexander had expressed his admiration for Kesselring as a military commander as early as 1943. In his 1961 memoirs Alexander paid tribute to Kesselring as a commander who [...] "showed great skill in extricating himself from the desperate situations into which his faulty intelligence had led him". Alexander's sentiments were echoed by Lieutenant General Sir Oliver Leese, who had commanded the British Eighth Army in the Italian campaign. In a May 1947 interview, Leese said he was [...] "very sad" [...] to hear of what he considered [...] "British victor's justice" [...] being imposed on Kesselring, an [...] "extremely <b>gallant</b> <b>soldier</b> who had fought his battles fairly and squarely". Lord de L'Isle, who had been awarded the Victoria Cross for gallantry at Anzio, raised {{the issue in the}} House of Lords.|$|E

2500|$|Kitchener {{was worried}} that, {{although}} his moustache was bleached white by the sun, {{his blond hair}} refused to turn grey, {{making it harder for}} Egyptians to take him seriously. His appearance added to his mystique: his long legs made him appear taller, whilst a cast in his eye made people feel he was looking right through them. Kitchener, at 6'2", towered over most of his contemporaries. Sir Evelyn Baring, the de facto British ruler of Egypt, thought Kitchener “the most able (soldier) I have come across in my time”. In 1890, a War Office evaluation of Kitchener concluded: [...] "A good brigadier, very ambitious, not popular, but has of late greatly improved in tact and manner...a fine <b>gallant</b> <b>soldier</b> and good linguist and very successful in dealing with Orientals" [...]|$|E
