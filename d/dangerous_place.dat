5|$|The Badlands are a rocky and hilly valley on the {{northern}} borders of the Septimus Heap world, where DomDaniel once practised his dark magic in an observatory atop a hill. They are inhabited by Land Wurms, giant carnivorous snakelike animals, making them a <b>dangerous</b> <b>place.</b> Simon Heap also used to live there with Lucy Gringe.|$|E
5|$|Bambi is a {{roe deer}} fawn {{born in a}} thicket to a young doe in late spring one year. Over {{the course of the}} summer, his mother teaches him about the various {{inhabitants}} of the forest and the ways deer live. When she feels he is old enough, she takes him to the meadow which he learns is both a wonderful but also <b>dangerous</b> <b>place</b> as it leaves the deer exposed and in the open. After some initial fear over his mother's caution, Bambi enjoys the experience. On a subsequent trip, Bambi meets his Aunt Ena, and her twin fawns Faline and Gobo. They quickly become friends and share what they have learned about the forest. While they are playing, they encounter princes, male deer, for the first time. After the stags leave, the fawns learn that those were their fathers, but that the fathers rarely stay with or speak to the females and young.|$|E
5|$|Salim {{appears in}} Uncharted 3: Drake's Deception. He is voiced by TJ Ramini. After Drake defeats the henchmen {{in the desert}} ghost town, Salim comes to him on horseback and helps him escape. After Drake was rescued, Salim tells him that the Atlantis of the Sands is a <b>dangerous</b> <b>place</b> and that Marlowe cannot be allowed to enter because of the evil within. Drake {{believes}} that she could use these powers to control others through fear, realising it was not treasure they were after. When Sully is rescued, Salim brings both {{of them to the}} open desert where the Atlantis of the Sands is located. Salim heads off and gets separated from Drake and Sully because of the heavy sandstorm. After Talbot is defeated and the Atlantis of the Sands collapse, Salim appears in time to save them.|$|E

40|$|This {{research}} {{explores the}} followers of the book The World’s Most <b>Dangerous</b> <b>Places.</b> These tourists deliberately travel to dangerous destinations {{where there is a}} high level of violence due to civil unrest, conflict or war. The research has focused on the Black Flag Café, an online tourism-based community created by the writer Robert Young Pelton, author of the books Come Back Alive and The World’s Most <b>Dangerous</b> <b>Places.</b> This is a case study that has made use of virtual ethnography and descriptive content analysis to explore the forum and its members. The research has identified four factors which influence the forum members’ decision to travel to a dangerous place: a search for selfactualisation through “it” or peak experiences; a desire to improve self-image and to obtain status from travelling to dangerous places; a search for an “authentic” travel experience; and finally their awareness and perception of danger and acceptance of the residual risks involved in travel to <b>dangerous</b> <b>places.</b> The study shows that the forum members enjoy pushing the boundaries of risk, undertaking a form of edgework. The research also explores the forum members’ sense that travelling to <b>dangerous</b> <b>places</b> can result in other benefits including familiarity with death, gaining arousal from risk taking (flow) and the possibility of repeat travel to increasingly <b>dangerous</b> <b>places.</b> The conceptual framework developed from the research displays the danger tourist’s approach to travelling to <b>dangerous</b> <b>places.</b> This framework identifies five benefits which participants obtain from travelling to dangerous places: flow, self-actualisation, improvement to self-esteem, the achievement and/or maintenance of status and familiarity with death. While this framework has been developed for the tourists who travel to <b>dangerous</b> <b>places,</b> undertaking danger tourism, it could equally be applied to other high-risk activities...|$|R
5|$|Veracruz is {{the most}} <b>dangerous</b> <b>place</b> in Mexico for journalists; at least nine journalists have been killed since Governor Javier Duarte de Ochoa took office in 2010, many of them by the Los Zetas drug cartel. Most of these reporters were killed under unclear circumstances, and few arrests {{have been made in}} their {{respective}} investigations. Given the high levels of corruption, criminal impunity, and drug-related attacks against the press all across Veracruz, many local journalists have decided to leave the state and relocate in other parts of Mexico. The atmosphere in Veracruz has also forced many media outlets to self-censor and stop reporting on the drug violence. With traditional reporting being too dangerous and intimidating, social media and blogs are often the only outlets for reporting serious crimes.|$|E
5|$|Another {{commonly}} held misconception is that highway overpasses provide adequate shelter from tornadoes. This belief is partly inspired by widely circulated video captured during the 1991 tornado outbreak near Andover, Kansas, where a news crew {{and several other}} people take shelter under an overpass on the Kansas Turnpike and safely ride out a tornado as it passes by. However, a highway overpass is a <b>dangerous</b> <b>place</b> during a tornado, and the subjects of the video remained safe due to an unlikely combination of events: the storm in question was a weak tornado, the tornado did not directly strike the overpass, and the overpass itself was of a unique design. Due to the Venturi effect, tornadic winds are accelerated in the confined space of an overpass. Indeed, in the 1999 Oklahoma tornado outbreak of May 3, 1999, three highway overpasses were directly struck by tornadoes, and {{at each of the}} three locations there was a fatality, along with many life-threatening injuries. By comparison, during the same tornado outbreak, more than 2000 homes were completely destroyed, with another 7000 damaged, and yet only a few dozen people died in their homes.|$|E

25|$|Logistics. Both {{during the}} buildup of forces and during the clashes of January and February, the Peruvian Army found itself at a {{logistical}} disadvantage. The fact that all reinforcements and supplies had to be flown in by helicopter from Ciro Alegría base, more than 110km to the south, meant that, in general, the Ecuadorian forces went into combat better armed and supplied. Moreover, once the shooting war started, the Cenepa valley became a rather <b>dangerous</b> <b>place</b> for the Peruvian Mil Mi-8 and Mil Mi-17 helicopters, which besides their transport duties also carried out ground-attack missions.|$|E

25|$|A Thomas Reuters Foundation survey {{says that}} India {{is the fourth}} most <b>dangerous</b> <b>place</b> {{in the world for}} women to live in. Women {{belonging}} to any class, caste, creed or religion can be victims of this cruel form of violence and disfigurement, a premeditated crime intended to kill or maim permanently and act as a lesson to put a woman in her place. In India, acid attacks on women who dared to refuse a man's proposal of marriage or asked for a divorce are a form of revenge. Acid is cheap, easily available, and the quickest way to destroy a woman's life. The number of acid attacks have been rising.|$|E
25|$|Governor Don Pedro Fernandez de Busto {{had been}} warned from a vessel that had sailed fast from the {{recently}} sacked city of Santo Domingo that his city would be next. He decided that all value was to be transported inland, while the city itself was evacuated of all non-combatants. Don Pedro Fernandez called for reinforcements from other nearby settlements and the militia of Cartagena was mustered and defences were prepared. The English fleet after leaving Santo Domingo sailed parallel along the New Granadan coast towards Cartagena. Drake knew that the coast was a treacherous one and a <b>dangerous</b> <b>place</b> to land sailors let alone soldiers.|$|E

The township also played an important role in the development and regular use of the Pennsylvania Canal along the West Branch Susquehanna River. The hamlet of Port Penn rose up along the section of the canal that passed through Muncy Creek Township.

40|$|Sounds from <b>Dangerous</b> <b>Places</b> asks “What can {{we learn}} of <b>dangerous</b> <b>places</b> by {{listening}} to their sounds?” Recent travels have brought me into contact with some difficult and potentially <b>dangerous</b> <b>places.</b> Most are areas of major environmental/ecological damage, but others are nuclear sites or the edges of military zones. The danger is not necessarily to a short-term visitor, but {{to the people of}} the area who have no option to leave or through the location’s role in geopolitical power structures. <b>Dangerous</b> <b>places</b> can be both sonically and visually compelling, even beautiful and atmospheric. There is, often, an extreme dichotomy between an aesthetic response and knowledge of the ‘danger’, whether it is pollution, social injustice, military or geopolitical. Places visited include: the Chernobyl Exclusion Zone, Ukraine: the Caspian Oil Fields, Azerbaijan: North Wales, UK, where Chernobyl fallout affected sheep farming practice until 2012 : nuclear, military and greenhouse gas sites in the UK including Sellafield, Dungeness, Bradwell, Sizewell, Thetford Forest, Rainham and Uttlesford. Field recordings, photographs, conversations, scientific and other information were collected at the sites and have been used for talks, lectures, radio programs, gallery installations, and publications. The ‘Sounds from Dangerous Places’ CDs and accompanying 80 -page book present recordings, images and writing from Chernobyl, the Caspian Oil Fields and UK sites...|$|R

25|$|In historiography, the {{hurricane}} and the rebuilding afterward divide {{what is known}} as the Golden Era (1875–1900) from the Open Era (1920–1957) of Galveston. The most important long-term impact of {{the hurricane}} was to confirm fears that Galveston was a <b>dangerous</b> <b>place</b> to make major investments in shipping and manufacturing operations; the economy of the Golden Era was no longer possible as investors fled. In 1920, Prohibition and tax law enforcement opened up new opportunities for criminal enterprises related to gambling and bootlegging in the city. Galveston rapidly became a prime resort destination enabled by the open vice businesses on the island. This new entertainment-based economy brought decades-long prosperity to the island.|$|E
25|$|The {{widespread}} {{adoption of}} steampowered {{vessels in the}} world's merchant marine services {{in the late nineteenth}} and early twentieth centuries radically altered the economics of seafaring. Without acres of canvas to be furled and unfurled, the demand for unskilled labor (and, by extension, crimping) greatly diminished. The sinking of the RMS Titanic, followed by onset of World War I (which made the high seas a much more <b>dangerous</b> <b>place</b> due to the threat of submarine attack) provided the final impetus to stamp out the practice. In 1915, Andrew Furuseth and Senator Robert M. La Follette Sr. pushed through the Seamen's Act of 1915 that made crimping a federal crime, and finally put an end to it.|$|E

25|$|Beinn a’ Chaorainn’s summit ridge is {{approximately}} 1.5km {{in length and}} made up of three high points. The middle of the three tops is now regarded as the highest point, the South Top (1049 metres) was regarded as the highest point until 1974 when re-surveying downgraded it to a “Top” in the Munros Tables and elevated {{the middle of the}} pinnacles to the recognised summit. The North Top (1044 metres) is also a “Top” in the tables and has been so ever since they were first published in 1891. The summit ridge of Beinn a’ Chaorainn has the reputation as a potentially <b>dangerous</b> <b>place</b> for walkers under winter conditions with at least one fatality in 1994. The problem arises with certain sections of the eastern corrie which bite far back into the ridge and can be snow covered in winter forming cornices. Walkers taking direct compass bearings between the high points on the summit ridge have fallen through the cornices by underestimating the distance that the corrie bites into the ridge.|$|E
