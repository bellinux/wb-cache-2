25|$|Various {{methods were}} used to {{forecast}} {{the outcome of the}} 2016 election. For the 2016 election, there were many competing election forecast approaches including Nate Silver's FiveThirtyEight, The Upshot at The New York Times, Daily Kos, Princeton Election Consortium, Cook Political Report, Rothenberg and Gonzales, PollyVote, Sabato's Crystal Ball and Electoral-Vote. These models mostly showed a Democratic advantage since the nominees were confirmed, and were supported by pundits and statisticians, including Nate Silver of FiveThirtyEight, Nate Cohn at The New York Times, and Larry Sabato from the Crystal Ball newsletter, who predicted a Democratic victory in competitive presidential races and projected consistent leads in several battleground states around the country. The near-unanimity of forecasters in predicting a Clinton victory may have been the result of groupthink. However, FiveThirtyEight's model pointed to the possibility of an Electoral College-popular vote split widening in the final weeks based on Trump's improvement in swing states like Florida or Pennsylvania. This was due to the demographics targeted by Trump's campaign which lived in big numbers there, in addition to Clinton's poor performance in several of those swing states in comparison with Obama's performance in 2012, as well as <b>having</b> <b>a</b> <b>big</b> number of her potential voters in very populated traditionally 'blue' states, but also in some very populated states traditionally 'red', like Texas, which were projected safe for Trump.|$|E

Set on a Sunday, the family who had commissioned the pie from the baker, in order to avoid cooking, try to find it, but to no avail. Taylor explains the moral is that if you believe it is a sin to cook on a Sunday, you should not be still <b>having</b> <b>a</b> <b>big</b> meal by getting a baker to cook for you.|$|E

500|$|Culverhouse {{quickly became}} one of the most {{influential}} NFL owners; he served as a member of the Player Club Relations Committee that handled player grievances, and of the NFL Congressional Committee. He was a member of the Executive Committee that handled negotiations during the 1982 NFL strike, an experience that earned him great praise from NFL negotiator Jack Donlan. Donlan praised Culverhouse's logic, analytical, and problem-solving skills, and his effectiveness [...] "at getting his way". Culverhouse was credited with <b>having</b> <b>a</b> <b>big</b> hand in the owners' course of direction during the strike, and was responsible for recruiting Donlan as negotiator. He repeated the role during the 1987 players' strike, after which NFLPA President Gene Upshaw described him as [...] "formidable", and said that [...] "at times, the whole league seemed to flow from this one guy". He was chairman of the NFL Finance Committee and the Management Council Executive Committee. His efforts were instrumental in bringing Super Bowl XVIII to Tampa, despite a lack of adequate hotel space in the city. Culverhouse was also a pioneer in using computers to handle team finances and scouting reports. He was a member of the four-man committee that stripped ownership of the New England Patriots from the Sullivan family when their debt became too great. Patriots founder Billy Sullivan later accused Culverhouse of blocking his effort to propose a stock sale that would have eased the debt. Culverhouse distanced himself from the NFL power core in later years, stung by other owners' criticisms of the Management Council. NFL Commissioner Paul Tagliabue credited Culverhouse for building much of the strength and unity of the modern NFL.|$|E

500|$|In the 1967 NBA Finals, the Sixers were {{pitted against}} Chamberlain's old team, the San Francisco Warriors of his {{one-time}} backup Nate Thurmond and star forward Rick Barry. The Sixers {{won the first}} two games, with Chamberlain and Greer taking credit for respectively defensive dominance and clutch shooting, but San Francisco won two of the next three games, so Philadelphia was up 3–2 prior to Game 6. In Game 6, the Warriors were trailing 123–122 with 15 seconds left. For the last play, Thurmond and Barry were assigned to do a pick and roll against Chamberlain and whoever would guard Barry. However, the Sixers foiled it: when Barry ran past Thurmond's pick {{and drove to the}} basket, he was picked up by Chet Walker, making it impossible to shoot; Thurmond was covered by Chamberlain, which made it impossible to pass. Barry botched his shot attempt, and the Sixers won the championship. Chamberlain said: [...] "It is wonderful {{to be a part of}} the greatest team in basketball... being a champion is like <b>having</b> <b>a</b> <b>big</b> round glow inside of you." [...] He contributed with 17.7 ppg and 28.7 rpg against fellow future Hall-of-Fame pivot Nate Thurmond, never failing to snare at least 23 rebounds in the six games. Chamberlain himself described the team as the best in NBA history. In 2002, writer Wayne Lynch wrote a book about this remarkable Sixers season, Season of the 76ers, centering on Chamberlain. In the 1967–68 NBA season, matters began to turn sour between Chamberlain and the Sixers' sole surviving owner, Irv Kosloff. This conflict had been going along for a while: in 1965, Chamberlain asserted that he and the late Richman had worked out a deal which would give the center 25% of the franchise once he ended his career. Although there is no written proof for or against, ex-Sixers coach Dolph Schayes and Sixers lawyer Alan Levitt assumed Chamberlain was right; in any case, Kosloff declined the request, leaving Chamberlain livid and willing to jump to the rival ABA once his contract ended in 1967. Kosloff and Chamberlain worked out a truce, and later signed a one-year, $250,000 contract.|$|E
