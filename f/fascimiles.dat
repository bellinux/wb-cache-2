50|$|His first book, the 1975 <b>Fascimile,</b> {{appeared}} late; it {{was followed}} by Conspirații sub cer deschis (1976), a selection of his anti-fascist, pro-democracy articles from 1936-1938. When he returned to journalism in 1978, publishing a column in Adrian Păunescu's Flacăra, he continued to be monitored by the Securitate. He collected these columns in five volumes, which appeared to positive reviews between 1980 and 1985 as Simple note. In June 1983, thanks to the efforts of Dumitru Radu Popescu, the Romanian Writers' Union granted him an unofficial pension; his name later disappeared from the membership list. His wife died the following month, plunging him into grief; his apathy deepened after his brother died in 1985, and his desire to write steadily faded. In October 1989, his health increasingly deteriorating, he returned to Focșani, where his two sisters cared for him until his death the following January. He was buried in the local Armenian cemetery, the service officiated by Zareh Baronian.|$|R
40|$|Oestrogen receptors and {{progesterone}} receptors {{were measured}} in the cytosols from cryostat sections of 45 meningiomas from 40 patients (12 men, 28 women) using an isoelectric focusing technique. Near <b>fascimile</b> adjacent sections from the same tissue blocks were stained and examined to determine the histological subtype of the neoplasms. Appreciable levels of progesterone receptor (greater than 10 fmol/mg cytosol protein) were present in 24 (53. 3 %) of of the neoplasms, but no clinically important oestrogen receptor was detected {{in any of the}} tumours. Competitive binding studies on control tissue confirmed the specificity of the assay procedures. No correlation was found between progesterone receptor state and the age, sex, or menopausal state of the patients, or the histological subtype and site of the neoplasms. Four of the patients studied had multiple intracranial neoplasms, which in two were of differing progesterone receptor state. The presence of specific progesterone receptor in meningioma cytosols raises the possibility of hormonal manipulation in the treatment of this group of neoplasms...|$|R

40|$|Hereby {{presented}} diploma {{paper is}} concentrating {{primarily on the}} Book Of Henryków (BOH), the outcome of Cistercian literature as produced in Silesia at the break of 13 th and 14 th century. I worked with Roman Grodecki edition, published in 1991. At the beginning I resumed published editions and source related literature. W orks containing some notions on BOH but not dealing with it further were left behind. Here I also made few remarks on topics I did not work with later on, as clashes between Polish, German and Roman/German canon law and {{the case of the}} oldest Polish-written sentence. I did not comment largely literature exploited {{for the purpose of this}} paper. In first part I reviewed general political and cultural situation in the 12 th, 13 th and the beginning of 14 th century Silesia, and introduced the moment when Grey Monks entered this area. Then I summarized contemporary Cistercian writing, where those produced in communities of Lubi'l_z, Trzebnica, Henryków and Kamienec are the most significant. These were mainly obituaries, annals, chronicles, Bishop' s lists, legends and Boo k Of Henrykow itself. With the help of previous researches and manuscript <b>fascimile,</b> I analyzed handwriting, authors, organization of BOH manuscript and reasons of manuscripťs creation.

40|$|AbstractThe Global Utilization of Streptokinase and Tissue Plasminogen Activator for Occluded Coronary Arteries (GUSTO) {{trial is}} a large scale {{international}} trial of new myocardial reperfusion strategies. The primary hypothesis is that early and sustained coronary artery recanalization will {{be associated with a}} significant reduction in mortality. The four regimens that are being tested are 1) streptokinase with subcutaneous heparin; 2) streptokinase with intravenous heparin; 3) accelerated recombinant tissue-type plasminogen activator (rt-PA) with intravenous heparin; and 4) combination streptokinase, rt-PA and intravenous heparin. The planned recruitment of 41, 600 patients in 1, 500 sites from 15 countries is expected to be completed by December 1992 and will enable detection of a 15 % reduction or 1 % absolute difference in mortality compared with that associated with standard therapy (streptokinase and subcutaneous heparin). In designing the trial, two important issues were directly addressed. First, a strategy was developed to provide assurance of patient safety during large scale investigational use of an aggressive thrombolytic regimen. This includes <b>fascimile</b> transmission of a one-page safety summary form to the Data Coordinating Center within 24 h of death or discharge, acceptance of the concept of “net clinical benefit” and close surveillance of the trial's progress by the independent Data and Safety Monitoring Committee. Second, to avoid potential conflict of interest beyond elimination of any position of financial equity, the Steering Committee unanimously voted to prohibit any honoraria for speaking engagements, payment for consultancy or travel or reimbursement of any kind from any of the five corporate sponsors until 1 year after publication of the results. Incorporation of these approaches may facilitate the design of future large scale randomized trials in cardiovascular medicine...|$|R
