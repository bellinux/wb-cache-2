500|$|Until {{the early}} 14th century, the {{interior}} of the cathedral was in a unified style, but it was to undergo two significant changes, to the tower and to the eastern end. Between 1315 and 1322 the central tower was heightened and topped by a spire, which caused the piers that supported it to show signs of stress. In 1338 the mason William Joy employed an unorthodox solution by inserting low arches topped by <b>inverted</b> <b>arches</b> of similar dimensions, forming scissors-like structures. These arches brace the piers of the crossing on three sides, while the easternmost side is braced by a choir screen. The bracing arches are known as [...] "St Andrew's Cross arches", in a reference to the patron saint of the cathedral. They have been described by Wim Swaan – rightly or wrongly – as [...] "brutally massive" [...] and intrusive in an otherwise restrained interior.|$|E

2500|$|The {{structure}} {{is much the}} same as it was when it was constructed in the 18th century. [...] The facade is simple and is fronted by a series of columns in sandstone and wood over which is a roof. The door and window jambs are typical of civil constructions of the 18th century with wrought iron work. The facade is topped by a wide cornice and <b>inverted</b> <b>arches.</b> At the very front is a sculpture of two coyotes in volcanic stone, the current logo of the borough. Above the entrance is the coat of arms granted to Coyoacán by Charles IV of Spain. On one side of the building is the Sala de Cabildos, or City Council Hall. It was painted by Aurora Reyes Flores with a mural depicting pre-Hispanic Coyoacan and includes depictions of the landscape of the area including the Xitle volcano, the Tepaneca god Xocotlhuetzin [...] as well as the Mesoamerican deity Quetzalcoatl. Next to this hall is an attached chapel. The mural in the chapel was done by Diego Rosales in 1961, depicting the early history of Mexico with personages such as Cuauhtémoc, Cortés, La Malinche and Pedro de Alvarado. Scenes of the work cover the walls and the ceiling.|$|E
50|$|The {{panorama}} of the Wastwater Screes across Wastwater {{is one of}} the most famous and awe-inspiring views in England. Poet Norman Nicholson described the Screes as ‘like the <b>inverted</b> <b>arches</b> of a Gothic Cathedral’.|$|E
50|$|A further use of <b>inverted</b> <b>arches</b> is {{to support}} lengthways forces from another arch, such as a bridge or viaduct. This is often done on poor ground, to reduce the ground loading {{otherwise}} and thus the need for extensive foundations. In the simplest case, the arches simply spread the downwards loads of viaduct piers into a wider ground area, exactly as for an inverted arch bridge. Such arches were used beneath the Hownes Gill Viaduct, {{on the advice of}} Robert Stephenson. <b>Inverted</b> <b>arches</b> have also been added to existing bridges, to reinforce them after their banks start to slide inwards. Such a repair was applied to The Iron Bridge in the 1970s.|$|E
50|$|On both floors, French {{casement}} {{windows with}} fanlights open {{from the main}} rooms onto wide verandahs, which are enclosed externally by Gothic stone arches, creating a cloistered atmosphere. The second storey verandah balustrade is constructed of cast iron fashioned in an <b>inverted</b> <b>arch</b> pattern.|$|R
50|$|Engaged {{cast stone}} piers divide the facade at regular intervals. Within them {{the first and}} second stories are set with {{rectangular}} windows similar to those in the central pavilion's dormers without the sidelights; the third story has an elliptical oculus. Above it is some decorative stonework and an <b>inverted</b> <b>arch</b> at the roofline.|$|R
5000|$|The blandness of {{the outside}} walls is {{relieved}} by two types of emblematic window openings: hexagonal windows enclosing {{the shape of the}} Star of David; and windows with an <b>inverted</b> <b>arch</b> form that includes a stylistic echo of the form of the traditional Jewish seven-branched candelabrum (the [...] "menorah") from the ancient Temple in Jerusalem. These windows run in horizontal rows around the building. The hexagonal windows are of stained glass and are themed around the months and festivals of the Jewish year and the Twelve Tribes of Israel. Although all the designs are different, these windows have colours and other stylistic elements in common that give coherence and a sense of unity to the collection. The <b>inverted</b> <b>arch</b> form windows are of plain clear glass. Williams later justified the whimsical window forms as being of structural relevance to a girder-like concrete element.|$|R
5000|$|<b>Inverted</b> <b>arches</b> {{are often}} used in {{conjunction}} with retaining walls. The arch provides a foundation for the walls and can resist the sideways forces upon them. The retaining wall also provides the vertical load needed by the arch.Inverted arch foundation is very strong foundation.|$|E
50|$|Having {{taken over}} the line, the S&DR {{proposed}} to bypass Hown's Gill through construction of a suitable bridge. They commissioned Thomas Bouch to design and supervise the construction of such a structure. Bouch's design was submitted to Stephenson, who recommended the use of <b>inverted</b> <b>arches</b> under the five central piers to reduce ground loading.|$|E
50|$|<b>Inverted</b> <b>arches</b> {{are used}} where {{sideways}} forces must be restrained, and where space is most easily available beneath a construction. They {{have often been}} applied to railway cuttings, but are perhaps most distinctively used as the base of docks, particularly dry docks and locks that must be supported {{even when they are}} empty of water that could otherwise resist the sidethrust of their walls. Some canal tunnels were built oval in section, such as the Newbold-on-Avon tunnel, where the lower section forms an invert for strength.|$|E
50|$|The River Avon and the Oxford Canal go between Newbold and Rugby. The canal {{goes through}} the 189-metre-long Newbold Tunnel, built in the 1830s to replace an older tunnel which went on a {{different}} route. Remains of the old tunnel can be seen next to the churchyard. The tunnel is oval in section, with the lower part forming an <b>inverted</b> <b>arch</b> for strength.|$|R
50|$|The {{excavated}} {{sides were}} almost perpendicular. To form the <b>inverted</b> <b>arch</b> or U-shape and prevent water permeating, the sides were constructed of puddled clay lined with concrete mixed with rubble then altars (steps {{in the dry}} dock wall) of Lockyer Creek freestone. The 1887 excavation to extend the dock required only limited lining and the base was not concreted until 1901.|$|R

50|$|The first Eagle Gate was remodeled and {{enlarged}} {{with new}} stone piers and wider <b>inverted</b> <b>arches</b> {{in the early}} 1890s (with Ralph Ramsay's eagle rebuilt and fortified); designed by Don Carlos Young, an architect son of Brigham Young. Due to the widening of State Street in the early 1960s, the prior monument including Ramsay's eagle was removed and replaced with a much wider and larger third generation Eagle Gate, designed by Salt Lake City architect George Cannon Young. Young {{was the son of}} Don Carlos Young and the grandson of Brigham Young. The monument is one of Salt Lake City's most well known pioneer landmarks, and its current design is one of Salt Lake City's best standing examples of Mid-Century Modern design.|$|E

5000|$|The {{building}} was the colonial archbishop's palace and contains two stone-columned courtyards. [...] In 1530, Friar Juan de Zumárraga {{became the first}} archbishop of New Spain, which at that time included most of the Americas and the Philippines. He decided to place the see in two houses near where the cathedral would later be built. After initial adaptation, two structures were added: one to cast bells and the other served as a prison. The structure continued to be modified until 1771 when it attained the appearance still seen today. The complex is topped by a cornice on with <b>inverted</b> <b>arches</b> are combined with merlons. Two estipite columns flank the bay of the portal, through which the highest ecclesiastical authorities of colonial times once passed. Remnants of the pyramid of Tezcatlipoca {{can be seen on}} the ground floor. This is because of a restoration project concluded in 1997. Along with restoring the colonial building, two excavations were carried out to expose details of the pre-Hispanic structures.|$|E
50|$|The Whiting Memorial Administration Building(Chinese: 怀德堂) was {{originally}} the studio of West China Union University(Chinese: 华西协和大学事务所). It was built from 1915 to 1919, designed by British Architect Fred Rowntree, {{who was also}} the main designer of the whole campus. It used the <b>inverted</b> <b>arched</b> technology at that time, which was the advanced during that time. Now this building is used as the office building of Huaxi District of Sichuan University.|$|R
50|$|In 1832 {{during a}} break in work on the Thames Tunnel due to water ingress, Donkin {{recommended}} Gravatt as Engineer to the Calder and Hebble Navigation. Gravatt resultantly designed the arches for several bridges, using a solid iron-plate <b>inverted</b> <b>arched</b> chain above the platform, creating the forerunner of the suspension bridge. However, early in the start of construction Gravatt was dismissed on grounds of experience. He was replaced by William Bull.|$|R
5000|$|The Cathedral of St. Ignatius Loyola {{was built}} in the Modern {{architectural}} style. The pews are arranged on a sloped floor to promote better participation. Together with the chapel the cathedral holds 1,250 people. [...] The sanctuary rises 75 feet (22.9 m) in an <b>inverted</b> <b>arch.</b> The wood reredos and the marble sanctuary furniture was a part of an early 21st-century renovation. It has a Rodgers Custom IV-manual organ, designed by Arthur Nobile, Jr..|$|R
50|$|Across {{the street}} from the plaza are the parish church and the former {{municipal}} hall. The parish and former monastery of San Felipe and Santiago Apóstoles dates from 1565. It has the largest atrium in Mexico City, surrounded by a thick wall with <b>inverted</b> <b>arches.</b> The main church has a large Baroque portal which contains the main door topped by a choir window. To the side there is a slender bell tower with pilasters on it four sides. Under the tower, there is an image of a red ant. A local legend says that when the ant climbs the bell tower, the world will end. To the right of the portal are three arches that front the former Dominican monastery. The interior of the church has a Baroque gilded altarpiece with Salomonic columns which contains images of the Virgin Mary. The main altar is Neoclassical. To the side there is a chapel called the Capilla del Rosario from 1720 with Baroque and Churrigueresque altars. The former cloisters has remains of its former mural work.|$|E
5000|$|The church, {{dedicated}} to the Virgin Mary, was built in several phases between the 8th and 13th centuries, using stones collected from the river Olona bound with sand and lime. The interior contains traces of an earlier ecclesiastical structure: {{the remains of a}} campanile with a square outline, pre-dating the present construction, are still visible. The external wall of the apse, with large pebbles, has four lesene dividing it into five parts, within which are single window openings in splayed surrounds. The upper perimeter is decorated with [...] "hanging" [...] or <b>inverted</b> <b>arches</b> in cotto brick, which create an interesting chromatic effect popular in Lombard Romanesque architecture. Inside the church some tombs have been rediscovered and a crypt with an ambulatory, datable to the 8th century, which is reached by two flights of stone stairs set into the side walls. To the originally rectangular church was added in the 12th and 13th centuries an apse of tufa and brick. To increase the capacity of the building a removable wooden mezzanine structure was added to {{the main body of the}} church, over the crypt.|$|E
5000|$|The parish {{church of}} the town is Divino Salvador (Divine Savior), which {{was built in the}} 17th century on a hill {{overlooking}} the town. Its facade is heavily decorated with estipite pilasters, gilded images of Saints Anne and Joachim and the Apostles [...] John, Peter and James. The prophets Moses and Elijah appear in the capitals of the columns. The interior was redone in the early 20th century in 19th century style, conserved one painting by Antonio Caro done in 1681 and another by an anonymous painter from the same epoch depicting Jesus as a child accompanied by his parents and grandparents. [...] The atrium in front of the church is still used for burials and is surrounded by a wall with <b>inverted</b> <b>arches,</b> with a clock at the entrance. [...] This church is the focus of the main religious event, the feast of the Divine Savior, celebrated on August 6 and 7th. This event begins at 5 am with the singing of Las Mañanitas accompanied by mariachi, followed by a procession of the image of Jesus. Carnival is also celebrated here, with traditional dance such as the Huehues, danced to various types of music, including current pop songs. These dancers generally wear colorful costumes with religious symbolism as well as wooden masks.|$|E
5000|$|Initial work on {{the dock}} {{included}} diversion of drains, and dredging of the entrance channel to the Humber. Approximately [...] of excavated material from the dock {{was used in the}} construction for levelling. The dock walls were made of concrete, with granite coping; the lock pit was constructed with concrete side walls and a shallow <b>inverted</b> <b>arch</b> of brickwork at the invert. Installation of the lock gates and their machinery was by Head Wrightson.|$|R
50|$|Like {{the flying}} <b>arch,</b> the <b>inverted</b> <b>arch</b> {{is not used}} to support a load, as for a bridge, but rather to resist sideways, inwards loads. The {{conventional}} arch supports a vertical load downwards on {{the centre of the}} arch and translates this into forces both downwards and outwards {{at the base of the}} arch. In most cases, this sideways force is a nuisance and must be resisted by either strong foundations or a further 'bowstring' girder, in the form of a tied-arch bridge.|$|R
50|$|It was {{designed}} by James Walker with Thomas Thorton and later John Timperley as resident engineer, The construction cost £186,000. The dock walls were similar in design {{to those in the}} Humber dock, as were the locks, with <b>inverted</b> <b>arched</b> bottoms. While the cofferdam used on construction of the northern lock was being dismantled a leak caused the undermining and collapse of around 60 ft the Old dock wall; the removal of debris was done using a diving bell and the Old dock wall repaired with piling.|$|R
50|$|The West India Docks Act of 1799 {{allowed the}} City of London Corporation to {{construct}} a canal from Limehouse Reach to Blackwall Reach, across the Isle of Dogs. It was intended to provide a short cut for sailing ships, to save them travelling around {{the south of the}} Isle of Dogs to access the wharves in {{the upper reaches of the}} river. If winds were unfavourable, this journey could take some time. The idea had been suggested by Ralph Walker in 1796. The West India merchants employed him as an engineer, and with assistance from William Jessop, John Foulds and George Dance, who was the City of London's surveyor, he produced the detailed plans which enabled the Act of Parliament to be obtained. Jessop was appointed as engineer with Walker as resident engineer, in August 1799, but Walker departed in 1802 after a disagreement with Jessop following a structural failure of part of the works. The canal was 3710 ft long with a surface width of 173 ft and a depth of 45 ft. The two locks were 193 by 45 ft, with the floors built as <b>inverted</b> <b>arches.</b> The lock walls were 6 ft thick, built of bricks with a stone facing. The depth over the lock cills varied between 20 and 24 ft at high tide, allowing ships of up to 500 tons burden to use the canal. Banks 12 ft high had to be built, because the high tide level was above that of the surrounding land, and the tops were 6 ft above water level. The surrounding land also had to be raised to the same height.|$|E
5000|$|The {{main feature}} of these churches is the ornate {{decoration}} {{of the main}} portals, although there is decoration on the bell towers and in some churches, other areas as well. This decoration is termed [...] "Mestizo Baroque" [...] or [...] "Mestizo architecture" [...] according to INAH. The ornate decoration is primarily aimed at teaching the new religion to the indigenous peoples, but unlike even the Baroque works further south, indigenous influence is obvious as the Serra’s idea was to demonstrate a blending of cultures rather than complete conquest. One element {{is the use of}} red, orange, and yellow, including pastel shades, and native sacred figures such as the rabbit and jaguar appear. The mission churches have a single nave, covered by a cannon vault, but each has its own peculiarities, especially in the portals. [...] Serra spent eleven years in the Sierra Gorda before moving on in the late 1760s north.The mission in Jalpan was established before the arrival of Junípero Serra in 1744, but Serra was in charge of building the mission complex that stands today from 1751 to 1758. It is dedicated to the Apostle James, the first evangelist. This complex is situated {{in the center of the}} modern town in front of the main plaza and formed by an atrium, cloister, pilgrim portal and church, with a chapel annex on the left side. The original atrium wall was lost, but reconstructed in the same style, with three portals and <b>inverted</b> <b>arches.</b> The main features of the ornate portal on the facade are Our Lady of the Pillar and the Virgin of Guadalupe, both with Mesoamerican connections, as well as a double headed eagle, meant to symbolize the blending of the two cultures.|$|E

Much of the detail is vegetative, along with small angels and eagles. European elements include images of saints such as Saint Dominic and Francis of Assisi and the Franciscan coat of arms. Inside the door, there are the images of Saints Peter and Paul. Native elements include a double-headed Mexican eagle devouring a serpent. On the upper left, there is an image of the Virgin of Guadalupe on the upper left, the Our Lady of the Pillar. These are the virgin images of Mexico and Spain respectively. This statue is said to have been taken by a general at the end of the 19th century. It was replaced by a more modern clock. [...] Inside, the cupola of the Jalpan mission contains scenes of the appearance of the Virgin of Guadalupe.|$|E
50|$|The main {{entrance}} of the convent is opens directly onto the street Francisco Botello. It is made with blocks of granite and consists of a geminate <b>inverted</b> <b>arch,</b> with thread cutting molding and keystones; it is aligned with and supports arch panels on flat pilasters.

50|$|Designed by Sir Owen Williams, {{who served}} as both {{architect}} and engineer on the project, the completed two-storey concrete structure was designed to accommodate 324 men at ground level and 316 women at gallery level. The synagogue's design featured two unusual window patterns that were meant to suggest Jewish religious symbolism: a hexagon, which Williams meant to suggest the Star of David, and an <b>inverted</b> <b>arch,</b> which {{was inspired by the}} outline of a seven-candle menorah. Although the building was consecrated in 1938 as a district member of the United Synagogue, the congregation expressed displeasure with the finished structure and Williams returned a portion of his design fee in view of this dissatisfaction.|$|R
