The deal between the two was reached after 18 months of negotiations, during at which point NAPE released radio and television advertisements criticizing {{the government}} for saying the province's economy was booming while they laid off employees and told unions to expect a modest increase in pay. The tentative deal included a wage freeze {{during the first two}} years of the deal, a two per cent increase in pay during year three and a three per cent wage increase in year four. Full-time employees will also receive a $1,400 signing bonus, while temporary, seasonal and part-time workers will get a pro-rated bonus. As well a new job <b>evaluation</b> <b>system</b> would see significant monetary benefits for some employees. Two weeks after reaching an agreement with NAPE, {{the government announced}} tentative agreements with the Canadian Union of Public Employees (CUPE) and the Association of Allied Health Professionals (AAHP).

5|$|Vaulx Carter {{was born}} in August 14, 1863, in western Tennessee, the sixteenth of {{seventeen}} children to Samuel Jefferson Carter. His mother was Anne Vaulx, the elder Carter's second wife. He was raised there for {{the early part of}} his life, but was orphaned along with two of his siblings following his father's death in March 1873 and his mother's the next year. The siblings remained without a guardian until February 1875, when they were adopted by a family member and spent the rest of their childhood in Pennsylvania. In September 1880, Carter passed the entrance examinations for the United States Naval Academy and on the twenty-second of that month, he was admitted into the school, one of four people selected to represent Pennsylvania at the academy in that year's class. In his second year at the school, Carter excelled in English and drawing, but had poor discipline and received 109 demerits; using a point <b>evaluation</b> <b>system,</b> the Naval Academy gave Carter fifty-three out of a possible seventy-six points for his conduct during the year. Between his second and third years, Cater sailed on the U.S.S. Constitution {{as a part of the}} Academy's summer cruise. His conduct worsened that year, and he only excelled in drawing. At the end of the year, Carter received ninety-nine of a possible one-hundred fifty-two points.|$|E

Beginning in January 2012, York County some schools will use the new evaluation method and provide feedback to the Department of Education. This new evaluation will not be used to determine an educator’s official 2011-12 assessment. Under the new <b>evaluation</b> <b>system,</b> 50% of the evaluation of a teacher will be based on an observation divided into four categories: planning and preparation, classroom environment, instruction, and professional responsibilities.

The new <b>evaluation</b> <b>system</b> has both announced and unannounced observations.

40|$|<b>Evaluation</b> <b>systems</b> {{of various}} types are an {{integral}} part of a country’s education policy space, within which they are supposed to have the basic functions of enhancing accountability and supporting school development. Here we argue that in a crowded policy space <b>evaluation</b> <b>systems</b> may interfere with each other in a way that can have unintended consequences and create new ‘policies by the way’ that are not the result of intentional policy decisions. To shed light on this argument, we examine five of approximately 30 <b>evaluation</b> <b>systems</b> operating in the Swedish education system. Our analysis examines a situation in which many <b>evaluation</b> <b>systems</b> are doing almost the same thing, i. e. collecting a similar and limited set of quantitative data, and addressing the same local governance actors with the primary goal of supporting school development in the same direction. By doing so, these <b>evaluation</b> <b>systems</b> could thus give rise to several unintended consequences, including a scaling down of the school law and curriculum, multiple accountability problems, increased administration and new intermediary job functions at the level of local education governance.

The unplanned nature {{of growth in}} the city resulted in massive traffic gridlocks that the municipality attempted to ease by constructing a flyover system and by imposing one-way traffic systems. Some of the flyovers and one-ways mitigated the traffic situation moderately but were unable to adequately address the disproportionate growth of city traffic. A 2003 Battelle Environmental <b>Evaluation</b> <b>System</b> (BEES) evaluation of Bangalore's physical, biological and socioeconomic parameters indicated that Bangalore's water quality and terrestrial and aquatic ecosystems were close to ideal, while the city's socioeconomic parameters (traffic, quality of life) aire quality and noise pollution scored poorly.

25|$|The Sitaras Method {{consists}} in an initial comprehensive <b>evaluation</b> <b>system</b> (which can take between 6-12 sessions) for assessing flexibility, cardio-respiratory fitness, strength, endurance, and body fat. Sitaras {{takes into account}} the unique musculature of the person, isolating differences between right and left sides of the body, different parts of each muscle, and the two major muscle fiber types (those for strength, and those for endurance), in order to design a workout tailored to each student's genetic aptitude, level of fitness, health conditions, and goals. An important goal is to develop muscular balance, which is the foundation for more specific goals such as aesthetics, strength and flexibility gains, or developing a more powerful athletic ability. The students must commit to working out at least twice a week, and are subject to a background check. They resume the muscle evaluation every three months with a variety of tools including digital scales, body fat and flexibility readers, and proprietary fitness software that helps track the clients strength gains over time. Based on the muscle evaluation, the fitness programs are adjusted or redesigned. The trainees too can follow the detailed physical changes of their body, giving them motivation and stimulation.|$|E

We show that more precise <b>evaluation</b> <b>systems,</b> being associated to a higher reactivity of wages to school grades, induce an higher level of student effort. However, the effect is heterogeneous: low ability students tend to react less compared to high ability students. Moreover, from our analysis, it emerges that individuals endowed with low abilities may prefer less accurate <b>evaluation</b> <b>systems.</b> Nevertheless, when productivity increases the convenience of these systems reduces and the number of individuals preferring them shrinks. Our analysis highlights an important trade-off between centralized and decentralized <b>evaluation</b> <b>systems.</b> Frequent <b>evaluations,</b> typical of decentralized systems, reduce the impact on grades of errors that influence student performance and in this way diminish signal noise, on the other hand, different teachers generally adopt different performance assessment standards, and this tends to produce noisier <b>evaluations.</b> Conversely, centralized <b>systems</b> use common <b>evaluation</b> standards, but their frequency is limited by relevant administration costs and then produce evaluations that are more affected by errors influencing student performance. In the final part of the paper we investigate the relationship between the optimal class size and <b>evaluation</b> <b>systems.</b> We show that under decentralized <b>evaluation</b> <b>systems</b> the class size also affects the signal noise, since larger classes may reduce the frequency of evaluations undertaken by teachers. ...|$|R
