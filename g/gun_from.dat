5|$|A rudder and {{a section}} of {{propeller}} shaft were {{on display at the}} Arashiyama Art Museum until it closed around 1991. The rudder, an anchor and one propeller have been relocated to the JMSDF Kure Museum, directly {{across the street from the}} Yamato Museum. The left-side 410mm <b>gun</b> <b>from</b> No. 3 turret is displayed outside as well, in Daiwa Park, Kure. The current whereabouts of the propeller shaft is now unknown.|$|E

50|$|When {{faced with}} public policy propositions for tougher {{controls}} over gun show transfers, or even bans on gun shows, anticontrol conservatives claim that blocking just {{one source of}} guns would not prevent a criminal <b>from</b> getting a <b>gun.</b> Advocates of gun show restrictions claim {{that large numbers of}} criminals acquire <b>guns</b> <b>from</b> professional <b>gun</b> traffickers, who acquire their <b>guns</b> <b>from</b> <b>gun</b> shows.|$|R
5|$|The {{original}} {{plan was to}} dismount the eight guns on the forecastle and quarterdeck and stow them on chocks on the deck during daylight {{to prevent them from}} being damaged by muzzle blast from the main guns. Gun trials in December 1906 proved that this was a bit more difficult than expected and the two port guns from the forecastle and the outer starboard <b>gun</b> <b>from</b> the quarterdeck were transferred to turrets' roofs, giving each turret two guns. The remaining forecastle guns and the outer port <b>gun</b> <b>from</b> the quarterdeck were removed by the end of 1907, which reduced the total to twenty-four guns. During her April–May 1915 refit the two guns from the roof of 'A' turret were reinstalled in the original positions on the starboard side of the quarterdeck. A year later, the two guns {{at the rear of the}} superstructure were removed, reducing her to twenty-two guns. Two of the quarterdeck guns were given high-angle Mark IV*C mounts for anti-aircraft duties and the two guns abreast the conning tower were removed in 1917.|$|E
5|$|The {{ship was}} {{fitted with a}} single QF 6 pounder Hotchkiss {{anti-aircraft}} (AA) <b>gun</b> <b>from</b> October 1914 {{to the end of}} 1915. In March 1915, a single QF 3 inch 20 cwt AA gun was added. It was provided with 500 rounds. The battlecruiser's 4-inch guns were enclosed in casemates and given blast shields during a refit in November to better protect the gun crews from weather and enemy action. Two aft guns were removed at the same time.|$|E
5|$|The ship's bell is {{currently}} {{on display in the}} University Memorial Center (UMC) at the University of Colorado. A /51 cal deck <b>gun</b> <b>from</b> Colorado was donated to the Puget Sound Maritime Historical Society in 1959, and is displayed at the Museum of History and Industry in Seattle. It was one of eight such guns on Colorado.|$|E

Harold intercepts the bullet in his chest and Merrigan is taken away.|$|E
5|$|Bulgaria used 26 tanks, {{delivered}} by Germany from used war reserve stock in early 1940, with the normal A-3 gun and 10 New T-11 tanks {{with the more}} powerful A-7 <b>gun</b> <b>from</b> the confiscated Afghan order were delivered between August and October 1940. They were supposedly relegated to training duties once the Germans began to deliver Panzerkampfwagen IV medium tanks in 1944, but apparently remained in service into the Fifties. But Kliment and Francev claim that the T-11s participated in the fighting in Yugoslavia and ended the war south of Vienna {{as part of the}} 1st Tank Brigade.|$|E
5|$|In 1924, John Ingle, {{the former}} captain of Pegasus, was tasked with {{clearing}} wrecks from the harbor in Dar es Salaam. At that time, {{he bought the}} salvage rights to Königsberg {{for the price of}} £200; he sent divers to extract non-ferrous scrap metal from the wreck and in turn sold the rights. Salvage work continued into the 1930s, and by the 1940s the hull had rolled over to her starboard side. As late as 1965, salvage work continued, but in 1966 the wreck collapsed and finally sank into the riverbed. Three of the ship's 10.5cm guns are preserved, one in Pretoria, South Africa, one in Jinja, Uganda, and one in Mombasa, along with a <b>gun</b> <b>from</b> Pegasus.|$|E

5|$|Later in August, Alabama {{departed}} for the Pacific theater; {{the ship was}} assigned to the US Third Fleet during the amphibious operations in the Gilbert islands, particularly Kwajalein in early 1944. During the night of 21 February 1944, Alabamas 5-inch guns were firing upon Japanese aircraft in the area. The ship turned {{in the direction of the}} Japanese aircraft in order to better engage them, but the rearmost turret was masked behind the amidships mount. The gunner in the rearmost turret accidentally overrode the safety mechanism that prevented the <b>gun</b> <b>from</b> firing in that circumstance, and when the gun was fired, it hit the 5-inch turret in front of it. Five men were killed and 11 wounded in the incident; an investigation revealed that the override switch was faulty and prone to accidental operation.|$|E
5|$|Mercedes tells Jacqui she {{is having}} an affair with Calvin. Jacqui confronts him and steals a <b>gun</b> <b>from</b> Lauren Valentine (Dominique Jackson). Theresa finds the gun and shoots Calvin. Jacqui decides to cover for Theresa. Jacqui tries to frame Gaz Bennett (Joel Goonan), but Kyle Ryder (Neil Toon) is later charged with the murder. Shortly after Des proposes to her, Jacqui discovers that he was a racist from Michaela's boyfriend Zak Ramsey (Kent Riley). Consequently, for Des, Jacqui declines his {{proposal}} and he leaves the village after being arrested alongside his sister Rose.|$|E
5|$|On 29 August 1942, {{during the}} Battle of Isurava, Kingsbury {{was one of}} the few {{survivors}} of a platoon that had been overrun by the Japanese. He immediately volunteered to join a different platoon, which had been ordered to counter-attack. Rushing forward and firing his Bren <b>gun</b> <b>from</b> the hip, he cleared a path through the enemy and inflicted several casualties. Kingsbury was then seen to fall, shot by a Japanese sniper and killed instantly. His actions, which delayed the Japanese long enough for the Australians to fortify their positions, were instrumental in saving his battalion's headquarters and he was posthumously awarded the Victoria Cross as a result.|$|E

5|$|On Martha's Vineyard, the Smoking Man visits Mulder's father, Bill, and informs {{him of his}} son's likely {{possession}} of the tape. Scully meets with a Navajo translator, who refers her to a code talker. Mulder is called away to see Bill; when Scully arrives at his apartment, she is grazed by a bullet shot through his window. When Mulder arrives at Bill's residence, his father prepares to reveal the truth about everything. However, Bill is shot and mortally wounded by Alex Krycek. When Mulder contacts Scully, she tells him to flee the scene. After Mulder arrives at her apartment, Scully takes his <b>gun</b> <b>from</b> him while he sleeps.|$|E
5|$|Schlesselman and Cowart chatted on the Internet {{about how}} {{to carry out the}} operation. Schlesselman {{suggested}} using a sawed-off shotgun because {{it would be easy to}} maneuver; he also said he planned to steal a <b>gun</b> <b>from</b> his father. Prior to their arrest, the men decorated their car with a Swastika and drew the numbers 88 and 14 on their hood using window chalk. Authorities believe the men may have planned to move from state to state to choose their victims. They also planned to wear white tuxedos and top hats during the assassination attempt.|$|E
5|$|Scully {{performs}} {{an autopsy}} on McRoberts' body and discovers signs of phobia including {{high levels of}} adrenaline and the same substance found on the elevator killer. She hypothesizes that the substance, when combined with other neurochemicals, produces an LSD-like reaction. While Mulder and Scully build a case, Funsch becomes more psychotic, continuing to see violent messages on electronic gadgets. Blood is associated in some way with each incident; a volunteer asks Ed to donate blood at a department store and seconds later he sees violent images, including a video of the 1993 Waco siege burning, flash across a sales display of TV sets, followed by a message to get a <b>gun</b> <b>from</b> the sporting goods department.|$|E

5|$|The 6th Squadron, {{commanded}} by Major Charles Dick, were also sent forward {{to support the}} 2nd Squadron's attempt to break through to the post. Advancing along the ridge from No.2 Post, they reached {{a position on the}} open plateau to the north of No.3 Post, but neither of the relieving squadrons could break through the Turkish lines, and were confronted by heavy Turkish fire from the surrounding higher ground. They were blocked by the sheer number of Turkish troops. Around noon the Turks undermined and blew up part of the trench at No.3 Post, which they then occupied. Turkish attacks continued all day, and they brought into action a mountain artillery <b>gun</b> <b>from</b> a nearby position. It was now estimated that around 3,000 Turkish troops were involved in the assault on No.3 Post.|$|E
5|$|The two aft turrets from Mutsus wreck were {{salvaged}} in the 1970s; No. 4 in July or August 1970 and No. 3 in September of {{the following}} year. Turret No. 4 and its guns were restored and were installed {{on the grounds of}} the former Imperial Japanese Naval Academy at Etajima, Hiroshima. One <b>gun</b> <b>from</b> Turret No. 3 is at the Kure Maritime Museum, popularly known as the Yamato Museum, in Kure, Hiroshima while the other is at the Museum of Maritime Science in Odaiba, Tokyo.|$|E
5|$|Very little {{improvisation}} {{took place}} during the filming due to the directors' extensive planning and clear vision for the film. Not everything went as expected, however, as the physical exchanges in the script caused some injuries. Barry Kivel, whose character Shelly was violently beaten in Caesar's bathroom, received a head injury from his head being banged against the toilet. In the scenes between Corky and Caesar {{near the end of the}} film, Gina Gershon hit her hand so hard when she knocked a <b>gun</b> <b>from</b> Joe Pantoliano's hand that she required stitches.|$|E
