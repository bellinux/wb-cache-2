5|$|People with {{infectious}} pneumonia {{often have}} a productive cough, fever accompanied by shaking chills, shortness of breath, sharp or stabbing chest pain during <b>deep</b> <b>breaths,</b> and an increased rate of breathing. In the elderly, confusion {{may be the most}} prominent sign.|$|E
5|$|Chlorine is {{detectable}} with {{measuring devices}} in concentrations {{as low as}} 0.2 parts per million (ppm), and by smell at 3 ppm. Coughing and vomiting may occur at 30 ppm and lung damage at 60ppm. About 1000ppm can be fatal after a few <b>deep</b> <b>breaths</b> of the gas. The IDLH (immediately dangerous to life and health) concentration is 10 ppm. Breathing lower concentrations can aggravate the respiratory system and exposure to the gas can irritate the eyes. The toxicity of chlorine comes from its oxidizing power. When chlorine is inhaled at concentrations greater than 30ppm, it reacts with water and cellular fluid, producing hydrochloric acid (HCl) and hypochlorous acid (HClO).|$|E
25|$|Before {{competition}} attempts, freedivers {{perform a}} preparation sequence, which usually consists of physical stretching, mental exercise and breath exercise. It may include sequention of variable length static apnea and special purging <b>deep</b> <b>breaths.</b> Results of the preparation sequence are slower metabolism, lower {{heart rate and}} breath rate, {{and lower levels of}} carbon dioxide in the bloodstream and overall mental equilibrium.|$|E
5000|$|Take a <b>Deep</b> <b>Breath</b> is {{the second}} {{full-length}} album by Canadian band, Brighton Rock. The album was released in 1988. Take a <b>Deep</b> <b>Breath</b> is Brighton Rock's most commercially successful album, peaking at #22 on the Canadian album chart. The album was also certified Gold by the CRIA.

40|$|Induced bronchoconstriction {{in normal}} {{subjects}} can be transiently reversed by a <b>deep</b> <b>breath</b> (airway hysteresis). The mechanisms of airway hysteresis {{are not fully}} understood. The aim of these studies {{was to determine whether}} the nature of the <b>deep</b> <b>breath</b> (slow or fast inspiration, five or 10 second breath hold) affects the resultant bronchodilatation. Bronchoconstriction was induced in 10 normal subjects by inhalation of histamine until specific airway conductance (sGaw) was halved (mean (SEM) post-histamine sGaw 0. 099 * (0. 009) s- 1 cm H 2 O- 1). A subsequent <b>deep</b> <b>breath</b> to total lung capacity (TLC) increased sGaw by 57 % (13 %) and neither the rate of inspiration to TLC nor periods of breath holding at TLC produced a significantly different degree of bronchodilation. Reducing the volume of the <b>deep</b> <b>breath</b> produced progressively less bronchodilatation and this was no longer significant after a breath to 68 % (2 %) TLC. To determine whether the volume of the <b>deep</b> <b>breath</b> or the accompanying increase in transpulmonary pressure (PstL) was responsible for the effect on sGaw, subjects were studied with an oesophageal balloon in place with and without their chest strapped. Subjects took a <b>deep</b> <b>breath</b> to a PstL of 20 cm H 2 O after bronchoconstriction had been induced by histamine. The degree of bronchodilatation (mean (SEM) %) was not significantly different (strap on 25 (6), strap off 36 (5)) even though significantly larger lung volumes (as % TLC) were reached with the strap off (strap on 57 (2), strap off 78 (3)). These results suggest that PstL rather than lung volume during a <b>deep</b> <b>breath</b> determines airway hysteresis...|$|R

25|$|There may be {{a number}} of side effects {{following}} the surgery. Because certain nerve connections to the lungs are cut during the procedure, transplant recipients cannot feel the urge to cough or feel when their new lungs are becoming congested. They must therefore make conscious efforts to take <b>deep</b> <b>breaths</b> and cough in order to clear secretions from the lungs. Their heart rate responds less quickly to exertion due to the cutting of the vagus nerve that would normally help regulate it. They may also notice a change in their voice due to potential damage to the nerves that coordinate the vocal cords.|$|E
25|$|Chronic {{lung disease}} {{develops}} {{in more than}} 25% of people with A-T. Three major types of lung disease can develop: (1) recurrent and chronic sinopulmonary infections; (2) lung disease caused by ineffective cough, swallowing dysfunction, and impaired airway clearance; and (3) restrictive interstitial lung disease. It is common for individuals with A-T {{to have more than}} one of these lung conditions. Chronic lung disease can occur because of recurrent lung infections due to immunodeficiency. Individuals with this problem are at risk of developing bronchiectasis, a condition in which bronchial tubes are permanently damaged, resulting in recurrent lower airway infections. Gamma globulin for people with antibody deficiency and/or chronic antibiotic treatment may reduce the problems of infection. Other individuals with A-T have difficulty with taking <b>deep</b> <b>breaths</b> and may have an ineffective cough, making it difficult to clear oral and bronchial secretions. This can lead to prolonged respiratory symptoms following common viral respiratory illnesses. Techniques that allow clearance of mucus can be helpful in some individuals during respiratory illnesses. Some people will develop swallowing problems as they age, increasing their risk of aspiration pneumonia. Recurrent injury to the lungs caused by chronic infections or aspiration may cause lung fibrosis and scarring. This process may be enhanced by inadequate tissue repair in ATM-deficient cells. A small number of individuals develop interstitial lung disease. They have decreased pulmonary reserve, trouble breathing, a need for supplemental oxygen and chronic cough in the absence of lung infections. They may respond to systemic steroid treatment or other drugs to reduce inflammation.|$|E
500|$|Following the album's low-budget release, Shields boasted, [...] "We {{know more}} about how the record {{industry}} works than our record company half the time. We do. I'm not joking." [...] That winter the band toured Europe, an event music critic David Cavanagh described as a [...] "unique chapter in live music". To recreate the higher tones from Loveless, Shields employed American flautist Anna Quimby. According {{to a friend of}} the band, [...] "She had a little skirt on, black tights...she was a little indie girl. But when she blew into the flute, it was like fucking Woodstock". NME editor Danny Kelly attended a show he described as [...] "more like torture than entertainment, I had a half pint of lager; they hit their first note and it was so loud that it sent the glass hurtling". A US spring tour followed, during which Shields and Butcher tested their audiences' ability to sustain noise played at high volumes. Critic Mark Kemp said of the American tour, [...] "After about thirty seconds the adrenaline set in, people are screaming and shaking their fists. After a minute you wonder what's going on. After another minute it's total confusion. The noise starts hurting. The noise continues. After three minutes you begin to take <b>deep</b> <b>breaths.</b> After four minutes, a calm takes over." [...] The tour saw My Bloody Valentine accused of criminal negligence by the music press, who took exception to the long period of extreme noise played during [...] "You Made Me Realise", referring to it as [...] "the holocaust". In December 2000 Mojo magazine rated the tour as the second loudest in history.|$|E
