40|$|Abstract]: This project investigates and {{evaluates the}} use of the conformal, affine and {{projective}} transformation methods to derive parameters to convert three existing co-ordinate systems found within the Australian Capital Territory into the Geodetic Datum of Australia 1994 map projection Map Grid Australia. These existing co-ordinate systems are known as City <b>Co-ordinates</b> (CC), Preliminary <b>Grid</b> <b>Co-ordinates</b> (PGC) and Adjusted <b>Grid</b> <b>Co-ordinates</b> (AGC) and are located in separated zones through the ACT. Three styles of transformation have been used {{in each of the three}} co-ordinate zones and analysis has been made into which method is most suited when a conversion from a 2 D orthogonal co-ordinate system into another is required. Comparisons have also been made when using GPS observations and territory published values to derive parameters in converting values within each test area. Effects of extrapolation have been investigated to determine the magnitude of error when parameters are used outside the region used to derive them. The error from the effects of extrapolation, have also been contrasted against acceptable limits defined from class and order of known published values. Spatial information is at the forefront of industry and government and with the ever increasing quantity of available data to the spatial user, quality data is desirable and co-ordinate transformation offers a method to data users for the merging of data and co-ordinate system conversion within data sets...|$|R

40|$|This {{thesis is}} {{primarily}} concerned {{with the use of}} moving mesh methods for the approximate solution of non-linear partial differential equations of parabolic type. Such methods have become a popular means for the solution of problems which maycontain sharp features that are hard to approximate, whilst efficiently managing computational overheads. Initially, anovel moving grid technique known as Contour Zoning is discussed. This 'static' method is able to reduce numerical resources by grouping together sets of nodes as a moving contour of the solution. Motivated by the findings from this method, a 'dynamic' moving mesh method is developed, initially powered by conservation of mass and later by equidistribution principles. The unusual feature of the method is that the resulting system is solved entirely through the <b>grid</b> <b>co-ordinates,</b> with the underlying partial differential equation solution being constructed algebraically aposteriori from the mesh. Numerical results are compared with an analytical solution to the porous media equation which drives the development of the method. Self-similar theory is also used to verify our approximate solutions. In one dimension the method is highly successful when applied to non-linear diffusion problems incorporating moving or fixed boundaries and problems with blow-up. However, in higher-dimensions we encounter oscillatory solutions emanating from an inability to manipulate our solution technique into square, invertible systems which satisfy all of the conditions required for this style of mesh movement...|$|R
40|$|This {{thesis is}} about {{estimation}} of trap efficiency of desilting basin using numerical model program named as SSIIM. SSIIM is acronym for Sediment Simulation in Intakes with Multiblock Option. It is developed by Dr. Nils Reider B. Olsen, Professor at NTNU, Norway and complete software is freely available over net with user manual. The {{program is a}} stepping stone {{in the field of}} Computational Fluid Dynamics (CFD). Study is based on desilting basin of Tala Hydropower Project (6 X 170 MW), an Indo Bhutan Joint venture. A physical model study of the same was done in Central Water Power Research Station (CWPRS), Pune, India,. Here this physical model and prototype both has been simulated, but with more emphasis over first one. Three dimensional flow and sediment calculation is evaluated over three dimensional grid using Power Law Scheme (POW) with no heeding towards Second order upwind scheme (SOU). The results are analysed, compared with physical model study and discussed. All the input data i. e. <b>grid</b> <b>co-ordinates</b> and different parameters used are appended in two files named koordina and control, using these program can be run. Number of different options were tried, but only few important has been discussed. Simulation result is found in harmony with physical model result. As real time data of sediment was not available for prototype, a relationship curve between particle size in prototype and model, as per CWPRS report, is used to get input sediment particle size for prototype. </p...|$|R

40|$|Preliminary {{visions of}} Grid {{computing}} {{have been presented}} in the late 90 ies. Since this time, the technology has changed tremendously and several contributions {{have been made by}} the research community in which we have participated since early 2000. Originally, Grid computing mainly focused on computing intensive tasks whereas Data Grids gained popularity in 2000. CERN’s LHC programme, its Grid projects and activities have been main driving forces. In the following habilitation 1 we cover a broad Grid research field that starts with early architectural ideas, covers concrete Grid services for research and academia and then gives an outlook on how Grids {{can be used in a}} business environment. A strong focus is on data and replica management, storage systems and workload management. This article provides a short introduction to the field of Grid computing and then outlines the following chapters of this habilitation. In detail, a selection of 20 papers will follow that have been written mainly in the years from 2000 to 2005. A strong focus is put on the work done within international <b>Grid</b> projects <b>co-ordinated</b> by CERN. ...|$|R

In order to model this type of geometry we divide the flow region into various smaller sub domains. All these regions are meshed separately and joined up correctly with the neighbors. This type of arrangement is known as Block Structured Grid. This type of system is flexible than the previous one.

40|$|An {{important}} {{stage in}} microarray image analysis is gridding. Microarray image gridding {{is done to}} locate sub arrays in a microarray image and find co-ordinates of spots within each sub array. For accurate identification of spots, most of the proposed gridding methods require human intervention. In this paper a fully automatic gridding method which enhances spot intensity in the preprocessing step as per a histogram based threshold method is used. The <b>gridding</b> step finds <b>co-ordinates</b> of spots from horizontal and vertical profile of the image. To correct errors due to the grid line placement, a grid line refinement technique is proposed. The algorithm is applied on different image databases and results are compared based on spot detection accuracy and time. An average spot detection accuracy of 95. 06 % depicts the proposed method’s flexibility and accuracy in finding the spot co-ordinates for different database images...|$|R
40|$|In {{this report}} the {{implementation}} {{and testing of}} a numerical model {{that is based on}} a Cartesian fixed grid in vertical direction is described. The model uses the shallow-water equations and accounts for effects of stratification. In stratified environments, the terrain-following 0 -transformation, which is often used in shallow-watermodels, is known to introduce numerical errors in computing the baroclinic pressure gradient, especially in regions with varying depth. Although quite some research was carried out in the past on the improvement of the implementation of the baroclinic pressure gradient, it still is not entirely clear to what extent the errors related to this problem harm computational results. In order to compare both approaches, i. e. the Cartesian fixed <b>grid</b> and the <b>co-ordinate</b> system based on the o-transformation, in a consistent way, identical discretizations of time and space were employed in both models, This allows to draw conclusions about the errors that are related to the co-ordinate system used, without interference of other uncertainties. It is shown that for relatively simple flow configurations, both models yield comparable results. In case of stratified flow over a rapidly varying bathymetry, significant differences between the models were observed. Hydraulic EngineeringCivil Engineering and Geoscience...|$|R
40|$|This thesis report {{submitted}} in partial {{fulfillment of}} the requirement for the degree of Bachelor of Science in Electrical and Electronic Engineering, 2014. Cataloged from PDF version of Internship report. Includes bibliographical references (page 32). Vital {{to the evolution of}} a modern civilization is uninterrupted supply of electricity. However, in a resource constrained utility the large gap between demand and generation entails load shed i. e. tripping a feeder from the substation causing a total service disruption to the consumers under that feeder for an interval. An alternative is load management through demand response i. e. consumers will willingly reduce their consumptions on getting a signal on price or other incentives from the utility so that {{there is no need for}} shedding the total load of a consumer. This is one of the objectives of a Smart grid that aims to overlay ICT in the existing power <b>grid</b> and <b>co-ordinate</b> energy usage of individual consumers so that the generation and demand is balanced. In order to familiarize the smart grid concept to the consumers in general and future engineers in particular this thesis addresses the load management aspect through developing a laboratory model. Here the consumer end smart meter is represented by an Arduino Mega 2560 microcontroller equipped with a NRF 905 transceiver and interfaced with LEDs (which simulate loads). Another similar set of Arduino is interfaced with a computer to simulate the utility server. From the server a signal on the percentage of load to be turned off is transmitted to the client end. Within 10 seconds of receiving the signal a suitable combination of loads greater than or equal to the instructed percentage needs to be turned off by the consumer else the equivalent load will be turned off automatically by the smart meter. In either case the client (smart meter) transmits a feedback signal to the server. The way the model has been built and various codes are developed for control and communication is illustrated in this thesis. Syeda Mayesha AzimSalwa ShahidiRehenuma TarannumSharaban TahoraB.

40|$|Two {{different}} methods {{were used to}} obtain a potential energy surface for the Arco molecule. One involved choosing a functional form for the repulsion and dispersion energies whose parameters were determined by a fit to experimental data. A physically justified potential that agreed with experiment could not be obtained. The other method was based on calculating ab initio interaction energies at different configurations of the molecule and interpolating between them. The resulting surface was scaled in the energy and the co-ordinates. Improved agreement was achieved for most observed bound states. Errors in the surface {{may have been due}} to an inadequate density of ab initio energies. So, how the molecular configurations chosen for interaction energy calculations affected the potential obtained was investigated. Both the co-ordinate system and the interpolation scheme also significantly affected the quality of surface obtained. The best compromise between accuracy and number of configurations, was points distributed on a regular <b>grid</b> in elliptic <b>co-ordinates</b> with Gauss-Legendre quadrature points in the angular co-ordinate. This information was employed to obtain a potential energy surface for the weakly bound HeOCS molecule which was in close agreement with experiment. A co-ordinate and energy scaling, guided by experiment, was applied to the ab initio surface. Only three scaling parameters were required due to the high quality of the initial surface...|$|R
40|$|Roughly {{perpendicular}} to SS 433 ’s famous precessing jets is an outflowing “ruff ” of radio-emitting plasma, revealed by direct imaging on milli-arcsecond scales. Over the last decade, {{images of the}} ruff reveal that its orientation changes over time {{with respect to a}} fixed sky <b>co-ordinate</b> <b>grid.</b> For example, during two months of daily observations with the VLBA by Mioduszewski et al. (2004), a steady rotation through ∼ 10 ◦ is observed whilst the jet angle changes by ∼ 20 ◦. The ruff reorientation is not coupled with the well-known precession of SS 433 ’s radio jets, as the ruff orientation varies across a range of 69 ◦ whilst the jet angle varies across 40 ◦, and on greatly differing and non-commensurate timescales. It has been proposed that the ruff is fed by SS 433 s circumbinary disk, discovered by a sequence of optical spectroscopy by Blundell et al. (2008), and so we present the results of 3 D numerical simulations of circumbinary orbits. These simulations show precession in the longitude of the ascending node of all inclined circumbinary orbits — an effect which would be manifested as the observed ruff reorientation. Matching the rate of ruff precession is possible if circumbinary components are sufficiently close to the binary system, but only if the binary mass fraction is close to equality and the binary eccentricity is non-zero...|$|R
