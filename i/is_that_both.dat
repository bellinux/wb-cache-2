5|$|Amenhotep I {{was the son}} of Ahmose I and Ahmose-Nefertari. His elder brothers, {{the crown}} prince Ahmose Sapair and Ahmose-ankh, died before him, thus {{clearing}} the way for his ascension to the throne. Amenhotep probably came to power while he was still young himself, and his mother, Ahmose-Nefertari, appears to have been regent for him for at least a short time. The evidence for this regency <b>is</b> <b>that</b> <b>both</b> he and his mother are credited with founding a settlement for workers in the Theban Necropolis at Deir el-Medina. Amenhotep took his sister Ahmose-Meritamon as his Great Royal Wife. Another wife's name, Sitkamose, is attested on a nineteenth dynasty stele.|$|E
5|$|Between 1983 and 1989 the {{paintings}} underwent technical examination and were extensively restored and cleaned. Technical {{analysis of the}} Philadelphia painting established that the wood panel comes from the same tree as that of two paintings definitively attributed to van Eyck, and that the Italian panel has underdrawings of a quality that it is thought could only have come from him. After nearly 500 years, {{the paintings}} were reunited in 1998 in an exhibition at the Philadelphia Museum of Art. Today the consensus <b>is</b> <b>that</b> <b>both</b> were painted by the same hand.|$|E
5|$|Hyderabad {{emerged as}} the {{foremost}} centre of culture in India with {{the decline of the}} Mughal Empire. After the fall of Delhi in 1857, the migration of performing artists to the city particularly from the north and west of the Indian sub continent, under the patronage of the Nizam, enriched the cultural milieu. This migration resulted in a mingling of North and South Indian languages, cultures and religions, which has since led to a co-existence of Hindu and Muslim traditions, for which the city has become noted. A further consequence of this north–south mix <b>is</b> <b>that</b> <b>both</b> Telugu and Urdu are official languages of Telangana. The mixing of religions has also resulted in many festivals being celebrated in Hyderabad such as Ganesh Chaturthi, Diwali and Bonalu of Hindu tradition and Eid ul-Fitr and Eid al-Adha by Muslims.|$|E
5000|$|In {{regard to}} whether two given propositions {{can have the}} same truth value, there are four {{separate}} logical possibilities: the propositions are subalterns (possibly both are true, and possibly both are false); subcontraries (it <b>is</b> possible <b>that</b> <b>both</b> <b>are</b> true, but not <b>that</b> <b>both</b> <b>are</b> false); contraries (it <b>is</b> possible <b>that</b> <b>both</b> <b>are</b> false, but not <b>that</b> <b>both</b> <b>are</b> true); or contradictories (it <b>is</b> not possible <b>that</b> <b>both</b> <b>are</b> true, and it <b>is</b> not possible <b>that</b> <b>both</b> <b>are</b> false).|$|R

5|$|Male {{participation}} in feminism is encouraged by feminists and {{is seen as}} an important strategy for achieving full societal commitment to gender equality. Many male feminists and pro-feminists are active in both women's rights activism, feminist theory, and masculinity studies. However, some argue that while male engagement with feminism is necessary, it is problematic because of the ingrained social influences of patriarchy in gender relations. The consensus today in feminist and masculinity theories <b>is</b> <b>that</b> <b>both</b> genders can and should cooperate to achieve the larger goals of feminism. It has been proposed that, in large part, this can be achieved through considerations of women's agency.|$|E
5|$|The {{boundary}} of the south polar region {{is marked by a}} pattern of parallel, Y- and V-shaped ridges and valleys. The shape, orientation, and location of these features suggest they are caused by changes in the overall shape of Enceladus. As of 2006 there were two theories for what could cause such a shift in shape: the orbit of Enceladus may have migrated inward, leading to an increase in Enceladus's rotation rate. Such a shift would lead to a more oblate shape; or a rising mass of warm, low-density material in Enceladus's interior may have led to a shift in the position of the current south polar terrain from Enceladus's southern mid-latitudes to its south pole. Consequently, the moon's ellipsoid shape would have adjusted to match the new orientation. One problem of the polar flattening hypothesis <b>is</b> <b>that</b> <b>both</b> polar regions should have similar tectonic deformation histories. However, the north polar region is densely cratered, and has a much older surface age than the south pole. Thickness variations in Enceladus's lithosphere is one explanation for this discrepancy. Variations in lithospheric thickness are supported by the correlation between the Y-shaped discontinuities and the V-shaped cusps along the south polar terrain margin and the relative surface age of the adjacent non-south polar terrain regions. The Y-shaped discontinuities, and the north-south trending tension fractures into which they lead, are correlated with younger terrain with presumably thinner lithospheres. The V-shaped cusps are adjacent to older, more heavily cratered terrains.|$|E

25|$|Writing and art {{were not}} {{distinct}} {{as they have}} been for European cultures. Writing was considered art and art was often covering in writing.

25|$|Overall {{the culture}} of Northumberland, as with the north east of England in general, has much {{more in common with}} Scottish Lowland and Northern English culture than with that of Southern England. One reason <b>is</b> <b>that</b> <b>both</b> regions have their {{cultural}} origins in the old Anglian Kingdom of Northumbria, a fact borne out by the linguistic links between the two regions. These include many Old English words not found in other forms of Modern English, such as bairn for child (see Scots language and Northumbria).|$|E

25|$|A {{step drill}} bit is a drill bit {{that has the}} tip ground down to a {{different}} diameter. The transition between this ground diameter and the original diameter is either straight, to form a counterbore, or angled, to form a countersink. The advantage to this style <b>is</b> <b>that</b> <b>both</b> diameters have the same flute characteristics, which keeps the bit from clogging when drilling in softer materials, such as aluminum; in contrast, a drill bit with a slip-on collar {{does not have the}} same benefit. Most of these bits are custom-made for each application, which makes them more expensive.|$|E
25|$|Batoo is {{a modern}} Korean variant. The name stems from a {{combination}} of the Korean words baduk and juntoo (“battle”). It is played entirely in cyberspace, and differs from standard Go in a number of ways, most noticeably {{in the way in which}} certain areas of the board are worth different points values. The other principal difference <b>is</b> <b>that</b> <b>both</b> players place three stones before the game begins, and may also place a special “hidden stone”, which affects the board as a regular stone but is invisible to the opponent. Batoo became a short-lived fad among young people in Korea around 2011.|$|E

25|$|Activity theory, in {{contrast}} to disengagement theory, implies that the more active elderly people are, {{the more likely they}} are to be satisfied with life. The view that elderly adults should maintain well-being by keeping active has had a considerable history and since 1972, this has come to be known as activity theory. However, this theory may be just as inappropriate as disengagement for some people as the current paradigm on the psychology of ageing <b>is</b> <b>that</b> <b>both</b> disengagement theory and activity theory may be optimal for certain people in old age, depending on both circumstances and personality traits of the individual concerned. There are also data which query whether, as activity theory implies, greater social activity is linked with well-being in adulthood.|$|E
25|$|Shellsort {{was invented}} by Donald Shell in 1959. It {{improves}} upon bubble sort and insertion sort by moving out of order elements more than one position at a time. The concept behind Shellsort <b>is</b> <b>that</b> <b>both</b> of these algorithms perform in O(kn) time, where k is the greatest distance between two out-of-place elements. This means that generally, they perform in O(n2), but for data that is mostly sorted, {{with only a few}} elements out of place, they perform faster. So, by first sorting elements far away, and progressively shrinking the gap between the elements to sort, the final sort computes much faster. One implementation can be described as arranging the data sequence in a two-dimensional array and then sorting the columns of the array using insertion sort.|$|E
25|$|The {{canonical}} Wnt Pathway {{involves the}} accumulation of β-catenin in the cytoplasm, which activates transcription factors. Casein kinase 1 epsilon, and related casein kinase 1 delta, is dephosphorylated in this pathway. Dephospho rylation of casein kinase 1 epsilon is likely achieved by Protein Phosphatase 2(PP2A), which increases both the enzymes' kinase activity in vivo. Casein kinase 1 epsilon and casein kinase 1 delta have been implicated in increasing β-catenin's stability in the cytoplasm, although studies of the mechanism for this stabilization are inconclusive. The current theory for how casein kinase 1 epsilon and/or casein kinase 1 delta function in this pathway <b>is</b> <b>that</b> <b>both</b> casein kinases either directly stabilize β-catenin though positive regulation, or that they indirectly stabilizes β-catenin through negative regulation of the β-catenin degradation complex (protease).|$|E
