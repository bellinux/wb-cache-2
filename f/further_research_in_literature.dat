40|$|Although {{altruism}} {{is known}} to be a typical volunteer-trait, our respondents were motivated more or less by self-interest as well, adding to the discussion regarding whether altruism or self-interest is the main motivator for volunteer tourists. Second, the outcome of the volunteer experience is not necessarily as dependent on the motives as it is on what the volunteer makes of it. Something we believe needs <b>further</b> <b>research</b> <b>in</b> <b>literature</b> concerning volunteer tourists. Third, the rewards mainly derived from the free time and the relationships developed between volunteers, and the costs mainly from the projects due to social distance. However, the rewards were generally perceived as greater than the costs considering the total experience, implying that the free time during volunteer experiences is of greater importance than what can be understood from current literature. Forth, the low level of commitment among volunteers leads us to question if it should be considered as a form of pro-poor tourism. Fifth, communication is of great importance in order to achieve cultural interaction, a vital component of volunteer tourism and finally, we found that volunteer tourism can indeed be beneficial, as long as organizations focus on the “right kind” of projects...|$|E
40|$|Ice {{hockey is}} {{particularly}} significant in Canada as {{it acts as}} a primary site of socialization for boys and men. This form of socialization raises questions about masculinity on the public agenda {{in terms of the}} problematic nature of hypermasculinity in sport, stereotypical images of athletes, and questions of social responsibility as both men and athletes. These issues are presently relevant as Canada (and perhaps all of North America) finds itself in an era characterized by accounts in mainstream media of competitive athletes’ cavalier lifestyles, hazing, violence, homophobia, drug addictions, and suicides. This review of literature uses secondary research to problematize masculinity in the ice hockey context by presenting the overarching claim that male hockey players are hegemonically masculine individuals. The piece begins by defining Australian sociologist R. W. Connell’s (1987) concept of hegemonic masculinity and situating it in the contemporary academic context. Next, it offers an overview of relevant literature on masculinity and sport along with a concise examination of scholarly work on the relationship between hegemonic masculinity and ice hockey in Canada. It concludes by summarising calls for <b>further</b> <b>research</b> <b>in</b> the <b>literature</b> and by suggesting approaches to future studies in the field...|$|R

3000|$|Recently, due to {{the high}} {{capacity}} of SO 2 pick-up of MgAl 2 O 4, {{there has been a}} growing interest in the application of it as a sulfur transfer catalyst in FCC for controlling SO x [...] emission. However, the surface area of the existing spinel tends to be no more than 100  m 2 /g [4, 5, 6, 7], which is far from enough, specifically at 700  °C. As a result, when applied in catalysis, the small surface area does not facilitate the diffusion of oxides and reducibility of the catalysts [8, 9]. Wang et al. [10] prepared a series of De-SO x [...] catalysts by the co-precipitation method using MgNO 3 and NaAlO 2 as precursors. By evaluating their structural properties and the De-SO x [...] activity as well as reducibility, they concluded that those materials owning big surface area show an exceptional catalytic activity. But the price of NaAlO 2 is so high that it cannot be used widely. At the present time, the researchers have increased the surface area of spinel by adding surfactants during the preparation [1]. For example, Ashad et al. had synthesized the spinel magnesium aluminate nanopowders of 182.12  m 2 /g using 8 -hydroxyquinoline (HQ) and tetraethyl ammonium hydroxide (TEAOH) [11]. The sample CuMgAlCe mixed oxides were prepared by a modified co-precipitation–calcination method using CTAB as a surfactant template. The sample had the highest specific surface area of 142.2  m 2 /g and also presented the best SO 2 adsorption rate and capacity [12]. But there was still a lack of <b>further</b> <b>research</b> <b>in</b> the <b>literature</b> regarding the influence of multi-surfactants and their combination on the properties of spinel.|$|R

We believe that drinking works as a trigger for smoking especially in social settings like bars while {{it is also possible that}} people who want to cut cigarette consumption might increase alcohol consumption to cope with resulting stress, which induces an asymmetry in cross price elasticities. We did not find a strong relation between coffee consumption and the consumption of cigarette and alcohol. This finding does not rule out the possibility that coffee and cigarette are complements for certain people. However there is not a significant complementarity relationship when we look at the whole population. cigarette, alcohol, coffee, rational addiction, pseudo panel, Demand and Price Analysis,...|$|R
40|$|This thesis, whose {{materials}} were gathered through library and archival research, examines {{a selection of}} English novels written by white Rhodesians between 1890 and 1994. In the introductory chapter reasons are given for choosing these novels and the period between 1890 and 1994. The objectives for carrying out this study were, firstly, to enlighten the students of literature, literary scholars {{and the general public}} on {{the subject matter of the}} white-authored novel in Rhodesia and in present day Zimbabwe. Secondly, it was to enable students, scholars and the general public to link such historical and social events, as described in the novels, with current political and social events in a country struggling to defeat racism and to create a socially equitable environment for everyone. Thirdly, it was to help these interested parties appreciate the role of this novel as a conscientising tool since it describes human behaviour in a way that enables the reader to learn from its rights and wrongs. In discussing the selected novels, focus is on content and character and how these interact to produce meaning. The thesis is particularly sensitive to the portrayal of Africans and demonstrates that Africans are invariably portrayed negatively. This influences their reaction towards the white settlers. Such reaction indicates African response to colonisation. The Africans are neither passive nor stupid. It is only white people who conceive them to bear these characteristics. Attention has also been paid to the white women: as novelists, victims, silent protagonists and outspoken protagonists of various issues in the different novels. The womenâ€™s role is indispensable as it complements that of the men in many ways during the colonisation of Zimbabwe. Finally, some questions have been posed which enable the reader to focus on possible <b>further</b> <b>research</b> <b>in</b> this <b>literature.</b> It is hoped that the reader will find this historical study of the white Rhodesian novel interesting as well as educative...|$|R
40|$|Africa {{has been}} {{identified}} as an upcoming market in which luxury brands should secure future growth opportunities. A review of related academic literature, however, reveals that limited research has been conducted which focuses specifically on the continent’s luxury consumers. This gap <b>in</b> the <b>literature</b> highlights the need to further the body of knowledge on luxury consumer behaviour in this context. However, as the continent comprises a vast number of countries with diverse consumer profiles, it was decided that this study would focus on the assessment of the behaviour of the members of luxury consumer segments in the South African market. The specific areas that require <b>research</b> <b>in</b> order to establish an understanding of luxury consumer segments’ behaviour commenced from a review of different trends and developments in the South African market. The core trends, along with calls for <b>further</b> <b>research</b> on luxury brands in the international academic literature were combined to identify numerous avenues for <b>further</b> <b>research.</b> This eclectic approach aimed to not only contribute to an enhanced understanding of the behaviour of luxury consumer segments in the South African market, but to develop and extend the existing body of academic knowledge and literature on luxury brands. Four research questions were developed from both the identified avenues from the review of the trends in the market, and the calls for <b>further</b> <b>research</b> <b>in</b> the academic <b>literature.</b> Each of these questions was then addressed by four individual papers.  This thesis makes a number of contributions to the related body of knowledge as it details the behaviour of different luxury brand consumer segments in the South African market, thereby serving as a step towards addressing the gap <b>in</b> the <b>literature</b> on luxury consumers on the African continent.   QC 20170411 </p...|$|R
40|$|Purpose/objectives: This {{research}} {{deals with}} the development of a consensus construction to understand and to optimize factors affecting service technicians response time in corrective maintenance processes for stationary equipment, i. e. equipment that can generally not be re-located for maintenance and repair, in different business areas, i. e. elevator, mining equipment and IT hardware. In this context, the goal of this research is to identify competitive objectives with respect to corrective maintenance, factors that are perceived to influence service technicians in this process as well as perceived improvement opportunities. Based on this, a consensus construction to be utilized <b>in</b> the <b>researched</b> community has been developed in order to optimize the according response times. The construct may also be used as a baseline for <b>further</b> <b>research</b> <b>in</b> this context. Design/methodology/approach: The empirical part of the research conducted has been targeted with an abductive, qualitative, multiple case study approach. The need for this research has been identified through an in-depth and iterative literature review and the methodology chosen, i. e. multiple case study research, has been justified. The empirical part to contribute to closing the research gap has thereby been divided into four parts: 1. Preparation of research and pilot 2. Case studies and result documentation 3. Analysis, interpretation and consensus construction development 4. Conclusions, limitations, outlook and recommendations Findings: The findings represent a significant contribution both for knowledge as well as business practice. In addition to the identification of <b>further</b> gaps <b>in</b> <b>research,</b> the <b>literature</b> review thereby isolated a specific need with regards to understanding and improving factors affecting service technicians in stationary equipment corrective maintenance response time. In this con-text, numerous concepts, such as PSS, servitization, competitive objectives/priorities, correc-tive maintenance, response time reduction, etc. have been reviewed, put into context, dis-played in a structured way and contributed to by this research. Furthermore, a set of 57 per-ceived factors influencing the corrective maintenance process and 87 perceived improvement opportunities has been identified. The consensus construction structures and prioritizes these, gives action recommendations and makes the findings available for application in business practice in the community studied.

40|$|Soil {{analyses}} {{have been}} carried out in permafrost environment in Victoria Land, Continental Antarctica, in 9 sites within the network of the sensitive system permafrost-vegetation for the assessment of climate change effects along a latitudinal and geographical transect (77 ° - 72 °S). Within each site the samples have been collected in different ecological and environmental conditions concerning active layer thickness, vegetation type and coverage, substrata, occurrence of glacial and periglacial features. In each site the vertical profile of the ground have been described and the samples collected within the active layer representing all the layers with visible differences regarding texture, structure and color. Organic C and N show specific patterns allowing to discriminate: a) vegetated vs unvegetated sites; b) among the unvegetated sites, ground with and without disturbance processes, mainly represented by frost heave and salt concrections. The barren grounds with frost heave and/or salt efflorescences show highest values of organic C and N. In the vegetated sites, organic C and N show different patterns related to the vegetation type and to their ecological requirements in terms of nutrient regime. The higher values are associated in particular with moss communities and with ground colonized by nitrophytic epilithic lichens. On inundated grounds the content of both organic C and N increases respect to close sites with similar vegetation. On the contrary, bacteria have a wide range of variability (between complete sterile soils to a more than 100 K of cells/g soil) with less clear patterns of spatial distribution. In the surficial layers (< 5 cm) in the unvegetated sites the higher bacteria values couple with the higher values of Al and Fe, but not with the organic C and N. In these sites the higher bacteria values are always associated to the more xeric conditions while the only really sterile site is the true inland one (Cape Sastrugi). Although the vegetated sites show more abundant bacteria, the highest values have been found within unvegetated gelifluction terracettes soils. The vertical distribution of the measured parameters show regular patterns, with lower values at the surface, maximum at intermediate depth, and a decrease in the deeper parts of the profile, except for C and N in some sites with a progressive decrease with depth. These depths are consistent with the values of active layer thickness characterizing the different sites. The vertical profile of the bacteria are differentiated between vegetated soils and barren grounds, the former with the higher values in the upper layers, the latter with an opposite pattern. The relatively high values of bacteria in barren grounds and in strongly disturbed soils (as gelifluction terracettes) need <b>further</b> <b>research</b> especially because <b>in</b> <b>literature</b> these Antarctic environments have been considered sterile and therefore not particularly sensitive to the climate change...|$|R
