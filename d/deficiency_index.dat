Here J,B,H are n×n matrix-valued functions and the Hamiltonian H⩾ 0 may be singular even everywhere. We obtain two results for such a system to have minimal numbers (N±= 0 if I=R resp. N±=n if I=R+) and a criterion for their maximality N±= 2 n for I=R+ (as well as the quasi-regularity). This covers the Kac–Krein and de Branges (Trans. Amer. Math. Soc. 99 (1961) 118) theorems on 2 × 2 canonical systems and some results from Kogan and Rofe–Beketov (Proc. Roy. Soc. Edinburgh Sect. A 74 (1974 / 75) 5). Some conditions for a canonical system to have intermediate formal <b>deficiency</b> <b>indices</b> are presented, too. We also obtain a generalization of the well known Titchmarsh–Sears theorem for second-order Sturm–Liouville-type equations. This contains results due to Lidskii and Krein as special cases. We present two approaches to the above problems: one dealing with formal <b>deficiency</b> <b>indices</b> and one dealing with (ordinary) <b>deficiency</b> <b>indices.</b> Our main (non-formal) approach is based on the investigation of a symmetric linear relation Smin which is naturally associated to a first-order system.
