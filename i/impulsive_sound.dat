40|$|Abstract. <b>Impulsive</b> <b>sound</b> and {{vibration}} {{signals in}} gear system are {{often associated with}} their faults. Thus these <b>impulsive</b> <b>sound</b> and vibration signals {{can be used as}} indicators in condition monitoring of gear system. The traditional continuous wavelet transform has been used for detection of impulsive signals. However, it is often difficult for the continuous wavelet transform to identify spikes at high frequency and meshing frequencies at low frequency simultaneously since the continuous wavelet transform is to apply the linear scaling (a-dilation) to the mother wavelet. In this paper, the spike wavelet transform is developed to extract these <b>impulsive</b> <b>sound</b> and vibration signals. Since the spike wavelet transform is to apply the non-linear scaling, it has better time resolution at high frequency and frequency resolution at low frequency than that of the continuous wavelet transform respectively. The spike wavelet transform can be, therefore, used to detect fault position clearly without the loss of information for the damage of a gear system.

For this problem, a direct simulation using the conventional flow computation method is performed to obtain the acoustic source information in near-field. Computed unsteady flow results are used to obtain the solutions in far-field. Hybrid method using the flow results computed in near-field boundary region combined with an integral formulation to evaluate the radiated noise in far-field is suggested. First, a numerical study on wave dynamic procedure occurring in muzzle flows, which are made by a supersonic projectile released from the open end of a tube into ambient air condition, is implemented. From numerical simulation in near-field, such complex phenomena, including blast waves, jet flows, shock waves and their interactions in the muzzle blast, are described. Second, the Euler equations assuming axi-symmetric flows, which are able to ensure the non-linear effects while propagating outward and to simulate the near/far-field acoustic propagation, are applied for <b>impulsive</b> <b>sound</b> propagation resulting from complex muzzle blast through the unsteady flow results computed above. This numerical method is efficient and powerful computation tool to extend <b>impulsive</b> <b>sound</b> prediction near-field to the very far-field. ...|$|E

In the area of the NEMO-ONDE deep-sea observatory, sperm whales are often present together with heavy shipping. The spatial coincidence of both sound sources allows for the long term monitoring of their interaction. Some ships produce <b>impulsive</b> <b>sounds</b> and the automated separation of these impulses from sperm whale clicks is not a trivial task. As part of a detection, classification and localisation system for acoustic data from marine observatories, we present four modules performing the automated real-time classification of clicks from sperm whales and <b>impulsive</b> <b>sounds</b> produced by ships. First, two modules detect segments that contain <b>impulsive</b> <b>sounds</b> within a specifiable frequency band and return the impulses' positions. Then, two modules classify the detected impulses as sperm whale clicks or ship impulses.

The modules' reliability was tested on data from the NEMO-ONDE observatory.

Determining wildlife responses to <b>impulsive</b> <b>sound</b> is pertinent in coastal areas where development of port and power generation industries may result in disturbance from impulsive sounds such as percussive piling, especially around estuaries which may support internationally important numbers of bird species. Discussions between regulators, planning authorities and regional development agencies over precautionary levels of <b>impulsive</b> <b>sound</b> emitting activities are common, yet we're unaware of any study which provides guidance on acceptable noise limits that would keep disturbance to shorebirds to a minimum. This experimental study intentionally disturbed birds at a high tide roost site, an agricultural field adjacent to the sea wall on the south bank of the Humber estuary in northern England, using an <b>impulsive</b> <b>sound,</b> and their behavioural responses were recorded. The researcher sounded an air-horn at ever decreasing distances towards a mixed species flock of shorebirds. While visual disturbance from the experimenter was taken into consideration in the mediods, we cannot statistically separate their effects in this study. An ordinal logistic regression model demonstrated a statistically significant positive relationship between the decibel (dB(A)) level experienced by {{the birds and the}} behavioural response observed. In principle, this model can be used to predict the probability of a particular behavioural response at a given dB(A) level. Estimates of sound levels which included calculation of geometric and atmospheric attenuation were superior over more simple measures in predicting behavioural responses. This study has implications for assessing possible disturbance caused by impulsive noise, and adds to growing evidence that the effects of noise may be an important, albeit not straightforward, consideration in management decisions made for shorebirds and other avian species. ©Wildfowl & Wedands Trust...|$|E

A High Intensity Controlled Impedance Fluid filled wave Tube was developed that enabled laboratory simulation of high-energy <b>impulsive</b> <b>sound</b> that were characteristic of aquatic far-field, plane-wave acoustic conditions. The sounds used were based upon the impulsive sounds generated by an impact hammer striking a steel shell pile. Neutrally buoyant juvenile Chinook salmon (Oncorhynchus tshawytscha) were exposed to impulsive sounds and subsequently evaluated for barotrauma injuries. Observed injuries ranged from mild hematomas at the lowest sound exposure levels to organ hemorrhage at the highest sound exposure levels. Frequency of observed injuries were used to compute a biological response weighted index (RWI) to evaluate the physiological impact of injuries at the different exposure levels. As single strike and cumulative sound exposure levels (SEL(ss), SEL(cum) respectively) increased, RWI values increased. Based on the results, tissue damage associated with adverse physiological costs occurred when the RWI was greater than 2. In terms of sound exposure levels a RWI of 2 was achieved for 1920 strikes by 177 dB re 1 µPa(2) ⋅s SEL(ss) yielding a SEL(cum) of 210 dB re 1 µPa(2) ⋅s, and for 960 strikes by 180 dB re 1 µPa(2) ⋅s SEL(ss) yielding a SEL(cum) of 210 dB re 1 µPa(2) ⋅s.
