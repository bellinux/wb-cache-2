5|$|In the {{rebuttal}} phases, {{a witness}} or a rival character provides {{their idea of}} what has happened. The player is able to press them for details, and can present relevant pieces of evidence that contradict what the witness or rival <b>is</b> <b>saying.</b> By doing this, the player gets closer to the truth; it is through confronting suspects during these phases that the player solves the cases. Upon solving a case, the episode is cleared and a new episode is {{made available to the}} player. If the player makes mistakes throughout the game, such as presenting wrong pieces of evidence, attempting to connect two thoughts that do not match up, or making incorrect choices, a green gauge called the Truth Gauge decreases, representing Edgeworth getting further from the truth. If it is completely emptied, the game ends. By clearing an investigation phase, half of the gauge is restored, and by clearing an episode, the gauge is restored completely.|$|E
5|$|After Ashtar escapes {{into the}} Maze of Darkness, Robert tells Ryu about Ashtar's plot {{to take over}} the world by using the full power of his sword, the Dark Sword of Chaos. Robert implores Ryu to stop Ashtar before his Dark Sword reaches full power. After battling through the Maze of Darkness and into the World of Chaos, Ryu hears echoes of Ashtar's plan in the distance. Ryu then catches up with Ashtar. He {{releases}} Irene, but immediately after releasing her he stabs her with the Dark Sword. Robert then shows up, only to find out that Irene has been mortally wounded; Ashtar then blasts Robert with energy from his Dark Sword and then challenges Ryu to battle. Ryu defeats Ashtar, and before he dies, he says that the forces of Darkness will soon awaken and implores the forces of Chaos to engulf the world into darkness. While he <b>is</b> <b>saying</b> this, the Dark Sword of Chaos vanishes into thin air. After Ashtar's death, Irene tells Ryu that an evil altar that Ashtar prepared to open the Gate of Darkness must be destroyed. Ryu then leaves Irene behind and tells Robert to take her and leave the World of Chaos.|$|E

25|$|The many-worlds {{interpretation}} is very vague {{about the ways}} to determine when splitting happens, and nowadays usually the criterion {{is that the two}} branches have decohered. However, present day understanding of decoherence does not allow a completely precise, self-contained way to say when the two branches have decohered/"do not interact", and hence many-worlds interpretation remains arbitrary. This objection <b>is</b> <b>saying</b> that {{it is not clear what}} is precisely meant by branching, and point to the lack of self-contained criteria specifying branching.|$|E
25|$|The monads for {{collections}} naturally represent nondeterministic computation. The list (or other collection) represents all {{the possible}} results from different nondeterministic paths of computation at that given time. For example, when one executes x <- , one <b>is</b> <b>saying</b> that the variable x can non-deterministically take {{on any of the}} values of that list. If one were to return x, it would evaluate to a list of the results from each path of computation. Notice that the bind operator above follows this theme by performing f on each of the current possible results, and then it concatenates the result lists together.|$|E
25|$|Hermeneutic {{theorists and}} {{therapists}} write that ontological hermeneutics is ideally situated {{to address this}} limitation of individualism because it upholds from the outset {{that human beings are}} relational and it attempts to explain human suffering and healing in these relational contexts. What ontological hermeneutics theory <b>is</b> <b>saying</b> {{is that it is not}} through isolated reflection upon personal cognitive and affective processes that heals psychological suffering. Instead, it is being-in-the-world and relating authentically to others through dialogue that provides a nexus of healthy, meaningful relationships that alleviates human suffering and promotes a sense of the good life for Dasein.|$|E

25|$|The form not {{the content}} of the {{theories}} (conversation theory and interactions of actors theory) return to and is congruent with the forms of physical theories; such as wave particle duality (the set theoretic unfoldment part of conversation theory is a radiation and its reception is the interpretation by the recipient of the descriptions so exchanged, and vice versa). The particle aspect is the recompilation by the listener of what a speaker <b>is</b> <b>saying.</b> Theories of many universes, one at least for each participant A and one to participant B- are bridged by analogy. As before this is the truth value of any interaction; the metaphor for which is culture itself.|$|E
25|$|Professor Trelawney first {{appears in}} the third book of the series, when Harry, Ron, and Hermione start divination lessons. The friends {{generally}} believe Professor Trelawney is a fraud. However, Gryffindor students Parvati Patil and Lavender Brown are very fond of and impressed by her. According to Professor McGonagall, her credibility as a Seer is undermined by her habit of erroneously predicting, each year, {{the death of one}} of her students. Her more profound predictions seem only to happen when she is in a trance and unaware of what she <b>is</b> <b>saying,</b> with no memory of it afterward. However, almost all her predictions were later to be shown true in the books even if she was not in a trance.|$|E
25|$|The Charismatic {{element of}} the Church is seen as being evident {{today as it was}} in the early days of Christianity. Some Catholic Charismatic {{communities}} conduct healing services, gospel power services, outreaches and evangelizations where the presence of the Holy Spirit is believed to be felt, and healings and miracles are said to take place. The mission of the Catholic Charismatic Renewal is to educate believers into the totality of the declaration of the gospels. This is done by a personal relationship with Jesus Christ; a one-to-one relationship with Jesus is seen as a possibility by the Charismatic. He is encouraged to talk to Jesus directly and search for what The Lord <b>is</b> <b>saying</b> so that his life will be one with Him; to walk in the Fruit of the Spirit in , this is what the Charismatic understands by giving their life to Jesus. Conscience is seen as an alternative voice of Jesus Christ.|$|E

25|$|What ontological hermeneutics <b>is</b> <b>saying</b> is {{here that}} the {{therapist}} strives to avoid an attitude of “expert” or “specialist” on human suffering and healing. Even though many mainstream counseling theories assume such roles, the position of ontological hermeneutics is that such roles create a conflict between freedom and commitment for the client and should therefore be avoided. In fact, hermeneutic theory states that such positions are nonexistent. Therefore, therapist does not intervene with objective truths that are intended to disprove the client’s previously perpetuated ways of thinking and feeling. Fusing horizons “is, instead, a matter of integrating another’s horizon {{in such a way}} that the one’s own outlook is changed in the process”) so that both therapist and client are thus both authentically benefited. And, ontological hermeneutics holds that this process is only possible via authentic dialogue during which both therapist and client utilize their memory and imagination to develop therapeutic possibilities. Furthermore, through this process, empathy is seen as a deeper phenomenon (intropathy) for relating to others; the entire process being what may be referred to as empathic envisioning, and compels therapists to become subjective in their value-laden conversations.|$|E
25|$|As {{human beings}} (Dasein) {{navigate}} their world around them, {{they look for}} tools and ways to accomplish {{what they need to}} do: food and water for survival, instruments to complete tasks, shelter for protection etc. Heidegger theorized that Dasein’s “quest” to exist, so to speak, can only be completed via his relationship with others and his world around him. This is what Slife termed radical relationality: human beings are fundamentally and inescapably relational beings. That human beings exist in-the-world as radically relational beings ultimately means that Dasein must seek out his existence through opportunities that present themselves in his world and through his relationships with others. In other words, what ontological hermeneutics <b>is</b> <b>saying</b> about what nature is that human beings cannot be thought of as merely “self-certain actants” capable of distancing themselves above and against their world effortly to determine rational courses of action, nor as little more than computers that have been programmed to react to stimuli. Instead, all understanding of how to exist comes from being-in-the-world and understanding one’s relation to, or place in, that world. Put another way, human beings conduct themselves within the context of their life-world (the world in which their lives take place) which provides Dasein with possibilities of how to act. It is this understanding of himself in that life-world that informs his choice.|$|E
25|$|Eden, {{who faced}} {{domestic}} pressure from his party to take action, {{as well as}} stopping the decline of British influence in the Middle East, had ignored Britain's financial dependence on the US {{in the wake of}} the Second World War, and had assumed the US would automatically endorse whatever action taken by its closest ally. At the 'Law not War' rally in Trafalgar Square on 4 November 1956, Eden was ridiculed by Aneurin Bevan: 'Sir Anthony Eden has been pretending that he is now invading Egypt to strengthen the United Nations. Every burglar of course could say the same thing; he could argue that he was entering the house to train the police. So, if Sir Anthony Eden is sincere in what he <b>is</b> <b>saying,</b> and he may be, then he is too stupid to be a prime minister'. Public opinion was mixed; some historians think that the majority of public opinion in the UK was on Eden's side. Eden was forced to bow to American diplomatic and financial pressure, and protests at home, by calling a ceasefire when Anglo-French forces had captured only 23 miles of the Canal. With the US threatening to withdraw financial support from sterling, the Cabinet divided and the Chancellor of the Exchequer Harold Macmillan threatening to resign unless an immediate ceasefire was called, Eden was under immense pressure. He considered defying the calls until the commander on the ground told him it could take up to six days for the Anglo-French troops to secure the entire Canal zone. Therefore, a ceasefire was called at quarter past midnight on 7 November.|$|E

25|$|Callum, who was {{battling for}} custody over Max, {{attacked}} David and the Platt family for months {{until one day}} when, after the Platt's return from a week-long holiday, Sarah Platt was babysitting Max. Whilst they were watching a scary movie, Gemma Winter, Callum's friend, came {{knocking at the door}} of Callum's flat. She had been beaten up by a thug. When Max was playing in his room, he found Callum's gun. Callum threatened Sarah that if she told anyone about the gun then he would release a video of Bethany dealing and taking drugs to the police. Sarah flees with Max, refused to speak to anyone about it and told Bethany to stay away from him. However, he continued threatening the Platts. Sarah confided in Jason Grimshaw to finish him off. He attacked Callum in the Rovers and told him to stay away. He was then arrested for possession of the gun but was released without charge due to lack of evidence. When Callum arrived at the Platts' house to collect Max, David and Jason prevented him. Furious, Callum and two of his thugs lead Jason into the ginnel and beat him up. Sarah found Jason and called an ambulance. Jason's parents Eileen and Tony were told that he might not walk or talk again. Max, who had witnessed the attack on Jason, told David and Kylie what he saw after he appeared terrified when Callum came to collect him. Max gave a statement to the police. Before Callum was arrested, he spiked Sarah's drink and knocked her unconscious. He threatened Bethany that he would kill Sarah if she did not lie for him. The day after, on Lily Platt's 2nd birthday, Bethany revealed to the Platts that she made a statement against Max. The family was disgusted as they knew she was lying. Sarah informed Tony about Callum and the following day, he took matters into his own hands by beating up Callum in the ginnel, only to be stopped by Liz. Callum continued to attack the Platts because he needed money to pay off a dangerous drug dealer. Sarah lures him to the house and records what he <b>is</b> <b>saying.</b> Callum finds her 'phone and starts attacking Sarah, and Kylie comes in and beats him over the head with a wrench, killing him. They bury his body in a manhole in the garage and Sarah is traumatized.|$|E
