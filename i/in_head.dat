5|$|The {{paintings}} depict isolated figures {{enclosed in}} spaces that are undefined, overwhelmingly claustrophobic, reductive and eerie. Coming early in Bacon's career, they are uneven in quality, but show a clear progression especially {{in how they}} utilise and present ideas he was still clearly developing and coming to terms with. Head I (actually begun {{in the winter of}} 1948) and Head II show formless pieces of flesh that broadly resemble human heads; they have half-open eyes and a pharynx, though it is positioned much higher than would be expected in a human. Heads III, IV and V show fully formed busts recognisable as men, and are characterised by a haunted atmosphere. These two broad ideas coalesce <b>in</b> <b>Head</b> VI, which is as physiologically tortured as the first two paintings, and as spectral as the middle three. <b>In</b> <b>Head</b> VI the figure has developed and is now shown wearing vestments, the first indication in Bacon's work of the influence of Velázquez, while the focus has become the open mouth and the study of the human scream.|$|E
5|$|After the 1973 {{season the}} team fired Webster, who later {{admitted}} {{his heart was}} never <b>in</b> <b>head</b> coaching, and said he more enjoyed life as an assistant. They hired retired star defensive end Andy Robustelli to run their football operations, and he picked Miami Dolphins defensive coordinator Bill Arnsparger as the team's head coach. Arnsparger had built an enviable reputation as {{the architect of the}} Dolphins defense which helped the team to two Super Bowl championships. Robustelli traded their 1975 first round draft choice to the Cowboys (who used it to select Hall of Fame defensive lineman Randy White) for quarterback Craig Morton {{in the middle of the}} 1974 season.|$|E

They are short-backed with oblique shoulders and good withers. The horses have the appearance of well-bred riding horses <b>in</b> <b>head,</b> skin, and coat. Overall, they have good conformation, with few deformities. Club hooves are occasionally seen in foals, likely due to trauma to the hoof while traveling long distances.|$|E

He had entered the house through a downstairs bathroom window, taken the rifle with the silencer attached, and gone upstairs.|$|E
