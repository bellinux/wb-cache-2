5|$|According to musicologist Francis Maes, Rubinstein {{could not}} be accused of any lack of artistic integrity. He fought for change and {{progress}} in musical life in Russia. Only his musical tastes were conservative—from Haydn, Mozart and Beethoven to the early Romantics up to Chopin. Liszt and Wagner were not included. Neither did he welcome many ideas then new about music, including the role of nationalism in classical music. For Rubinstein, national music existed only in folk song and folk dance. There {{was no place for}} national music in larger works, especially not in opera. Rubinstein's public reaction to the attacks was simply not to react. His classes and concerts were well attended, so <b>he</b> <b>felt</b> <b>no</b> reply was actually necessary. He even forbade his students to take sides.|$|E

5|$|Bhimsen {{felt the}} need to finish off his rivals, but at the same time, felt a need to take {{precaution}} before going after immediate members of the royal household. For almost two years after returning to Kathmandu, Rana Bahadur had no official position in the government – he was neither a king, nor a regent, nor a minister – yet <b>he</b> <b>felt</b> <b>no</b> qualms in using the full state power. Not only did Rana Bahadur carry out the Baisathi Haran under Bhimsen's advice, he was also able to banish all non-vaccinated children, as well as their parents, from the town during a smallpox outbreak, in order to prevent King Girvan from catching that disease. Now, after almost two-year, all of a sudden Rana Bahadur was made mukhtiyar (chief authority) and Bhimsen tried to implement his schemes through Rana Bahadur. Bhimsen had also secretly learned of a plot to oust Rana Bahadur. Tribhuvan Khawas (Pradhan), a member of Sher Bahadur's faction, was imprisoned on the re-opened charges of conspiracy with the British that led to the Knox's mission, but for which pardon had already been doled out, and was ordered to be executed. Tribhuvan Khawas decided to reveal everyone that was involved in the dialogue with the British. Among those implicated was Sher Bahadur Shah.|$|E
5|$|Castelli {{was born}} in Buenos Aires in 1764. He {{was the first of}} eight {{children}} born to a Venetian doctor, Ángel Castelli Salomón, and Josefa Villarino, who was a relative of Manuel Belgrano. He was trained by the Jesuits shortly before their expulsion, and attended the Real Colegio de San Carlos in Buenos Aires. As was customary, one of the children of the Castelli family was ordained into the priesthood, and Juan José was chosen for this. He was sent to study at the Colegio Monserrat, part of the University of Córdoba. He was influenced by the works of Voltaire and Diderot, and especially by Jean-Jacques Rousseau's The Social Contract. He was a fellow student of men who would later have influence in the public life of South America, including Saturnino Rodríguez Peña, Juan José Paso, Manuel Alberti, Pedro Medrano, and Juan Martínez de Rozas, among others. He focused on studying philosophy and theology, but when his father died in 1785, he abandoned his career in the priesthood, for which <b>he</b> <b>felt</b> <b>no</b> strong vocation.|$|E
5|$|Returning {{once again}} to {{domestic}} cricket, Hamence scored 85 and 66 against Queensland, and this kept him in the running for {{a place in the}} national team, as he toured with The Invincibles in England in 1948. He was not selected to play in any of the Tests, however he reiterated when interviewed in 2008 that <b>he</b> <b>felt</b> <b>no</b> resentment over not having played. Hamence was a popular member of the touring squad and his cheerful nature and splendid tenor voice added to the good spirits of the team. His success in the warm up games was mixed, scores of 92, 46 and 49 not out against Cambridge University, Essex and Lancashire mixed with a duck, seven, one, three, two and five against other counties. Against Somerset, approaching his first century of the tour, the Australian players, keen to see Hamence succeed, left their card games to applaud only to see him dismissed for 99, his highest score for the season. He also faced Scotland for two matches in August 1948, scoring six and 15. Overall on the tour he played 19matches scoring 582runs at an average of 32.33.|$|E

25|$|In 2004 erythromelalgia {{became the}} first human {{disorder}} {{in which it has}} been possible to associate an ion channel mutation with chronic neuropathic pain; when its pathophysiology was initially published in the Journal of Medical Genetics. Conversely, in December 2006 a University of Cambridge team reported an SCN9A mutation that resulted in a complete lack of pain sensation in a Pakistani street performer and some of his family members. <b>He</b> <b>felt</b> <b>no</b> pain, walked on hot coals and stabbed himself to entertain crowds.|$|E
25|$|From 1855 to 1860, Hill was {{employed}} on the United States' coastal survey. He was once engaged to Ellen B. Marcy, the future wife of Hill's West Point roommate George B. McClellan, before her parents pressured her {{to break off}} the engagement. Although <b>he</b> <b>felt</b> <b>no</b> ill will about the affair afterward, during the war a rumor spread that Hill always fought harder if he knew McClellan was present with the opposing army, because of Ellen's rejection. On July 18, 1859, he married Kitty ("Dolly") Morgan McClung, a young widow, thus becoming the brother-in-law of future Confederate cavalry generals John Hunt Morgan (Hill's best man at the wedding) and Basil W. Duke.|$|E
25|$|Lee {{perceived}} that McClellan {{was no longer}} a threat to him on the Peninsula, so <b>he</b> <b>felt</b> <b>no</b> compulsion to keep all of his forces in direct defense of Richmond. This allowed him to relocate Jackson to Gordonsville to block Pope and protect the railroad. Lee had larger plans in mind. Since the Union Army was split between McClellan and Pope and they were widely separated, Lee saw an opening to destroy Pope before returning his attention to McClellan. Believing that Ambrose Burnside's troops from North Carolina were being shipped to reinforce Pope, and wanting to take immediate action before those troops were in position, Lee committed Maj. Gen. A.P. Hill to join Jackson with 12,000 men, while distracting McClellan to keep him immobilized.|$|E

25|$|Luke's {{understanding}} of Jesus – his Christology – {{is central to}} his theology. One approach to this is through the titles Luke gives to Jesus: these include, {{but are not limited}} to, Christ (Messiah), Lord, Son of God, and Son of Man. Another is by reading Luke in the context of similar Greco-Roman divine saviour figures (Roman emperors are an example), references which would have made clear to Luke's readers that Jesus was the greatest of all saviours. A third is to approach Luke through his use of the Old Testament, those passages from Jewish scripture which he cites to establish that Jesus is the promised Messiah. While much of this is familiar, much also is missing: for example, Luke makes no clear reference to Christ's pre-existence or to the Christian's union with Christ, and makes relatively little reference to the concept of atonement: perhaps <b>he</b> <b>felt</b> <b>no</b> need to mention these ideas, or disagreed with them, or possibly he was simply unaware of them.|$|E

He also stated that it seemed neither likely nor desirable to have only one elected government rule the whole world. He criticized accusations of him being [...] "ruler of the world" [...] as nonsensical.|$|E
500|$|For a long time, it was {{difficult}} to discover many details of Sorabji's life, as he was extraordinarily private. He almost always refused requests for interviews or information, often with sharp messages and warnings not to approach him again. This has led to numerous misunderstandings, such as that he lived in a castle, because he lived in the Dorset village of Corfe Castle. Since he had independent financial means, <b>he</b> <b>felt</b> <b>no</b> need to be tactful in his dealings with the public, critics and musicians interested in performing his works. [...] "The Eye", Sorabji's home in Corfe Castle, had a sign at the gate stating: [...] "Visitors Unwelcome".|$|E

500|$|During a 1994 interview, a visibly {{intoxicated}} Frusciante {{noted that}} he wrote the album {{in order to create}} [...] "interesting music", which <b>he</b> <b>felt</b> <b>no</b> longer existed. He felt contemporary artists were not writing material he deemed worth listening to and the mainstream population were settling for mediocrity. Drugs were another significant topic Frusciante based Niandra Lades and Usually Just a T-Shirt on. According to Frusciante, he [...] "was stoned for every single note [...] played on the album." [...] He increased his drug use to cope with worsening depression that was caused by leaving the Red Hot Chili Peppers, and his subsequent isolation. Several songs on the album deal with his dislike for the Chili Peppers' success, such as the album's eleventh track, [...] "Blood on My Neck From Success".|$|E
500|$|The {{significance}} of the fixture for the two clubs was increased by the fact that, had Arsenal avoided defeat, they would have extended their unbeaten league run to 50 matches. Wenger told reporters at his press conference that <b>he</b> <b>felt</b> <b>no</b> increased pressure, though added the team's midweek draw in the UEFA Champions League at Panathinaikos increased expectation. He admitted his team's behaviour in the fixture last season was unacceptable, but pointed out [...] "...the best response we gave was to win the fair play table. That meant we took responsibility for what we did and we have improved our attitude." [...] Wenger believed United's strengths lay in creativity, {{and did not want}} to set his team out to nullify, rather to [...] "...play our game based on speed and technique." ...|$|E
500|$|Ice later {{developed}} {{a friendship with}} producer Ross Robinson, who had become known for producing music by Deftones, Korn, Limp Bizkit and Sepultura. Robinson and Ice shared an interest in motocross racing. Monte Lipman hoped that Robinson would produce a new Vanilla Ice album. According to Robinson, others had attempted to discourage him from working with Ice, saying it might hurt his reputation. Rather than being dissuaded, their fear encouraged Robinson who agreed to work with Ice. In an interview, Robinson stated [...] "It's the most punk-rock thing you could do." [...] Despite not being happy with his old image, Winkle stated that {{he never had a}} problem with his older music. Ice decided against changing his stage name to something else, as <b>he</b> <b>felt</b> <b>no</b> need to run from his past, despite being uneasy with some of it and started performing again, booking a hundred shows a year.|$|E
50|$|He {{encourages}} the people working under him to break rules {{and to go}} outside the box. He prefers a hands-off managing style and let his employees operate without interference. When he left Unilever, he said that <b>he</b> <b>felt</b> <b>he</b> <b>no</b> longer had the entrepreneurial freedom he required. At Gucci, he left design decisions to the designers of the respective departments, {{a stark contrast to}} how previous executives worked.|$|R

500|$|Following {{a largely}} {{successful}} Australian {{tour in the}} spring, Hoppus and DeLonge presented an ultimatum: quit drinking or go to an in-patient rehab. Raynor agreed to both and informed the band of his decision after taking the weekend to mull options. According to Raynor, he was fired through a phone call despite his agreement to rehab. Despite this, <b>he</b> <b>felt</b> <b>no</b> malice toward his former bandmates and later conceded they were [...] "right" [...] to fire him. The band would minimize {{the impact of the}} situation in future interviews and remained vague regarding his departure. Initial news reports explained that Raynor had [...] "reportedly returned to school." [...] DeLonge would later explain the drinking problem that led to his expulsion: [...] "One show he dropped his sticks 10 times. It was so disturbing to see someone ruining himself."

Raynor returned for the band's Hollywood Palladium performance, and the band became increasingly uneasy and arguments grew worse. To offset personal issues, Raynor began to drink heavily and it began to affect the band's performances.

500|$|Wenger {{was highly}} {{critical}} of Riley's performance, claiming he [...] "...decided the game, like we know he can do at Old Trafford." [...] The Arsenal manager claimed that Rooney told his players that <b>he</b> <b>felt</b> <b>no</b> contact, but the referee {{made the decision to}} give Manchester United a penalty which he called the turning point of the match. Wenger used statistics to question Riley's impartiality – of the referee's last eight matches at Old Trafford, he awarded eight penalties to the home team. Wenger was not surprised at United's rough treatment of Reyes – [...] "That's what they always try against us when they're in a difficult situation" [...] and accused Van Nistelrooy of being a cheat in his post-match television interview. Vieira, like his manager, was disappointed in Riley's handling of the match, but sought positives: [...] "We're still eight points clear of United and two points clear of Chelsea. We're in a really good position and all the other teams would want to be in our position." ...|$|E
