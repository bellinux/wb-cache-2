Included among these enterprises, for example, was the Great Wall Industrial Corporation, which imported and exported transportation vehicles, satellites and other products associated with aerospace programs, mechanical equipment, <b>electrical</b> <b>products,</b> hardware and tools, medical apparatus, and chemicals. China Northern Industrial Corporation, subordinate to the Ministry of Ordnance Industry, used military production facilities to manufacture civilian products for export. The business activities of China Northern Industrial Corporation included the sale of heavy machinery, hardware and tools, and heavy-duty vehicles; light chemical industry products, such as plastic, paints, and coatings; and high-precision machinery and optical and optical-electronic equipment. Other corporations offered a variety of professional consulting services. One of these, the China International Economic Consultants Corporation, provided economic and legal expertise on investment and other economic activities.|$|E

2500|$|Overall, Angola's {{economy has}} {{in recent years}} moved on from the disarray caused by a quarter-century of civil war to become the {{fastest-growing}} economy in Africa {{and one of the}} fastest in the world, with an average GDP growth of 20 percent between 2005 and 2007. In the period 2001–10, Angola had the world's highest annual average GDP growth, at 11.1 percent. In 2004, the Exim Bank of China approved a $2billion line of credit to Angola. The loan was to be used to rebuild Angola's infrastructure, and also to limit the influence of the International Monetary Fund in the country. China is Angola's biggest trade partner and export destination as well as the fourth-largest importer. Bilateral trade reached $27.67billion in 2011, up 11.5% year-on-year. China's imports, mainly crude oil and diamonds, increased 9.1% to $24.89billion while China's exports, including mechanical and <b>electrical</b> <b>products,</b> machinery parts and construction materials, surged 38.8%.

In her 1914 book Electric cooking, heating, cleaning, etc. Maud Lucas Lancaster mentions an earthed iron-clad plug and socket by the English firm of Reyrolle and Co. The earliest American patent application for an earthed plug appears to be 11 January 1915 by George P. Knapp, {{on behalf of the}} Harvey Hubbell company. This patent covers the use of an earthing pin which extends further than the other two contacts to ensure that it is engaged first. Knapp's design was obsoleted in the US before the modern NEMA designations, but is still used in some other countries including China, Argentina and Australia. The configuration of the socket was not operable with existing two-contact unearthed plugs. Other earthed sockets that are widely used in the US today are operable with unearthed plugs. [...] It is sometimes claimed (e.g., in Illumin) that the modern American version of the earthed plug, was invented by Philip F. Labre who was issued a US patent for an earthed socket and plug in 1928. However, Labre's design is no more similar to the modern version than Knapp's earlier design.|$|E

40|$|This study {{analyzes}} {{toxic chemical}} substance management in three U. S. manufacturing sectors from 1991 to 2008. Decomposition analysis applying the logarithmic mean Divisia index {{is used to}} analyze changes in toxic chemical substance emissions by the following five factors: cleaner production, end-of-pipe treatment, transfer for further management, mixing of intermediate materials, and production scale. Based on our results, the chemical manufacturing sector reduced toxic chemical substance emissions mainly via end-of-pipe treatment. In the meantime, transfer for further management contributed to the reduction of toxic chemical substance emissions in the fabricated metal industry. This occurred because the environmental business market expanded in the 1990 s, and the infrastructure for the recycling of metal and other wastes became more efficient. Cleaner production is the main contributor to toxic chemical reduction in the <b>electrical</b> <b>product</b> industry. This implies that the <b>electrical</b> <b>product</b> industry is successful in developing a more environmentally friendly product design and production process. ...|$|R
