25|$|Historians {{subject the}} gospels to {{critical}} analysis by differentiating authentic, reliable information from possible inventions, exaggerations, and alterations. Since {{there are more}} textual variants in the New Testament (200–400 thousand) than it has letters (c. 140 thousand), scholars use textual criticism to determine which gospel variants could theoretically be taken as 'original'. To answer this question, scholars have to ask who wrote the gospels, when they wrote them, what was their objective in writing them, what sources the authors used, how reliable these sources were, and how far removed in time the sources were from the stories they narrate, or if they were altered later. Scholars may also look into the internal evidence of the documents, to see if, for example, a document has misquoted texts from the Hebrew Tanakh, has made incorrect claims about geography, if the author appears to have <b>hidden</b> <b>information,</b> or if the author has fabricated a prophecy. Finally, scholars turn to external sources, including the testimony of early church leaders, to writers outside the church, primarily Jewish and Greco-Roman historians, {{who would have been}} more likely to have criticized the church, and to archaeological evidence.|$|E

2500|$|A digital {{watermark}} {{is a kind}} of marker covertly embedded in a noise-tolerant signal such as an audio, video or image data. It is typically used to identify ownership of the copyright of such signal. [...] "Watermarking" [...] is the process of hiding digital information in a carrier signal; the <b>hidden</b> <b>information</b> should, but does not need to, contain a relation to the carrier signal. Digital watermarks may be used to verify the authenticity or integrity of the carrier signal or to show the identity of its owners. It is prominently used for tracing copyright infringements and for banknote authentication.|$|E
40|$|In this paper, we {{introduce}} a new method to <b>hide</b> <b>information</b> (such as face image, voice, signature…) in ridges of a fingerprint image. The place where the message is hidden depends on features extracted from the image (like core, delta, ending and bifurcation). The proposed system consists of two stages; the First stage is for hiding a message which means extracting features from a fingerprint image to determine useless regions, while the second stage is for extracting a message from a fingerprint image. <b>Hiding</b> <b>information</b> in a fingerprint image must never alter the positions and numbers of important regions or pixels. <b>Hiding</b> <b>information</b> helps the automated fingerprint identification system in making the individual identification decision more reliable. In this paper a new technique {{in the way of}} <b>hiding</b> <b>information</b> is used depending {{on the nature of the}} cover image by determining the edges of an object and hiding the message between these edges...|$|R

50|$|The strictest {{definition}} of an abstract strategy game requires that it cannot have random elements or <b>hidden</b> <b>information.</b> In practice, however, many games that do not strictly meet these criteria are commonly classified as abstract strategy games. (Games such as Continuo, Octiles, Can't Stop, and Sequence, could be considered abstract strategy games, despite having a luck or bluffing element.) A smaller category of abstract strategy games manages to incorporate <b>hidden</b> <b>information</b> without using any random elements; the best known example is Stratego.|$|E

40|$|Steganography {{is the art}} of <b>hiding</b> <b>information</b> in {{ways that}} prevent its detection. Though {{steganography}} is an ancient craft, the onset of computer technology has given it new life. Computer-based steganographic techniques introduce changes to digital covers to embed information foreign to the native covers. Such information may be communicated in the form of text, binary files, or provide additional information about the cover and its owner such as digital watermarks or fingerprints. This paper explains steganography, provides a brief history and describes how steganography is applied in <b>hiding</b> <b>information</b> in images.

40|$|STEGANOGRAPHY {{is defined}} as the art of <b>hiding</b> <b>information.</b> STEGANOGRAPHY and {{cryptology}} are similar {{in the way that they}} both are used to protect important information. The difference between the two is that STEGANOGRAPHY involves <b>hiding</b> <b>information</b> so it appears that no <b>information</b> is <b>hidden</b> at all therefore the person will not attempt to decrypt the information. In STEGANOGRAPHY the different file formats can be used for the purpose of <b>hiding</b> the <b>information</b> like for example the video or audio etc. STEGANOGRAPHY comes from the Greek words STEGANÓS (Covered) and GRAPTOS (Writing).

40|$|A common {{technique}} for <b>hiding</b> <b>information</b> in executable files is the embedding {{a limited amount}} of information in program binaries. The hiding technique is commonly achieved by using special software tools as e. g. the tools presented by Hydan and Stilo in (Rakan, 2004, Bertrand, 2005). These tools can be used to commit crimes as e. g. industrial spy activities or other forms of illegal data access. In this paper, we propose new methods for <b>hiding</b> <b>information</b> in Portable Executable (PE) files. PE is a file format for executables used in the 32 -bit and 64 -bit versions of the Windows operating system. In addition, we discuss the analysis techniques which can be applied to detect and recover data hidden using each of these methods. The existing techniques for <b>hiding</b> <b>information</b> in an executable file determine the total number of bytes to be hidden on the foundation {{of the size of the}} executable code. Our novel methods proposed here do not limit the amount of hidden code...|$|R
