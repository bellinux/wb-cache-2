40|$|BACKGROUND: The only {{approach}} {{used in the}} refractory lesions of stable vitiligo is the surgical supply of melanocytes. Suction Blistering Epidermal Graft {{is one of the}} most common and effective techniques. There are multiple modalities, including the motor-driven diamond fraise, for the preparation of recipient sites in suction blistering epidermal graft with different repigmentation rates and complications. OBJECTIVES: To evaluate preparation of recipient site by a motor-driven dental lab <b>finishing</b> carbide <b>bur.</b> METHODS: Sixty-one stable, depigmented lesions were selected in 14 patients (9 women and 5 men), aged 16 - 29 years, of which 9, 3 and 2 had localized, generalized and segmental vitiligo, respectively. Recipient site was prepared by a motor-driven dental lab <b>finishing</b> carbide <b>bur.</b> RESULT: Excellent repigmentation at the recipient site was observed in 53 out of 61 (86. 9 %) grafted lesions. Postinflammatory hyperpigmentation and perigraft halo were seen in 11 (18 %) and 17 (27. 9 %) patients at the recipient site, respectively. CONCLUSION: Using a motor-driven dental lab <b>finishing</b> carbide <b>bur</b> to prepare the recipient site of suction blistering epidermal graft technique is reliable and effective, removing only the depigmented epidermis in a simple and safe manner, even on complex-shaped lesions and scar-prone sites...|$|R
40|$|Five {{composite}} filling {{materials were}} finished using six finishing procedures currently in clinical use. The average roughness produced by each procedure {{was measured by}} means of a Surfanalyzer with four replications for each procedure on each of the five materials. Statistical analysis indicated that finishing with silicon carbide disks produced the smoothest surfaces. Acceptable surfaces were obtained with stones or with burs. Use of an alumina paste after a green stone-white Arkansas sequence did not produce a significant improvement. Two processes of filler particle abrasion were distinguished by means of electron microscopy: wear and shear. Fracture striations indicated particle shear. The roughest surfaces were produced by the use of a diamond instrument which is contraindicated. Acceptable finishing procedures for the composite materials tested include silicon carbide disks for accessible areas or 12 fluted <b>finishing</b> <b>burs</b> for more inaccessible areas...|$|R

40|$|In this study, surface {{roughness}} of three esthetic materials namely composite resin, resin-modified glass ionomer, and a compomer were examined using three finishing and polishing systems. Thirty samples of each material were prepared. Ten samples from each material were then finished and polished {{with one of}} the three systems (Sof-Lex discs, a combination of diamond and silicone points, and carbide <b>finishing</b> <b>burs).</b> Surface roughness (R) of the samples after finishing and polishing were measured using a perthometer. The results showed that Sof-Lex discs and a combination of diamond and silicone points produced significantly better finished and polished surfaces on composite resin than on the other two materials. The roughest surfaces were obtained by carbide burs on glass ionomer (Photac-Fil). Although a combination of diamond and silicone points could provide acceptable finishing and polishing surfaces for composite resin and resin-modified glass ionomer surfaces, Sof-Lex discs provided smoother surfaces.

40|$|A missing incisor or premolar tooth that {{requires}} a quick functional and esthetic repair, such as the case of tooth loss caused by trauma needs quick conservative treatment to maintain sound abutment teeth. The use of resin composite for direct fixed partial denture (FPD) can reduce problems associated with metal substructures, such as esthetic limitations and preparation of abutment teeth. However, mechanical failure of direct FPD often occurs because of design limitations and poor fabrication. This case report describes a direct resin composite FPD combined with an orthodontic wire framework. A small enamel dimple was prepared below the contact area, and a U-shaped wire was formed and positioned in the prepared enamel dimples and bonded with resin cements. An alloy primer {{was applied to the}} surface of the wire, which was coated with adhesive resin and veneered with resin composite. The finishing of the margins and final polishing were completed a week after insertion. The FPD was contoured using fine composite diamond <b>finishing</b> <b>burs</b> and polished with silicone points. The combination of the U-shaped wire and an enamel dimple below the contact area has shown good results over a period of more than 12 months in these two cases. © 2008 The Authors. link_to_subscribed_fulltex...|$|R
40|$|AIM: Eugenol {{is claimed}} to {{interfere}} with the polymerization of composite resins and to affect shear bond strengths of dentine-bonded composite restorations. Eugenol-based sealers are used during root canal treatment in teeth that may require build-ups or extensive restorations. Unfortunately, the adverse effect of eugenol has mostly been assessed in shear bond tests and this variable may be clinically inappropriate. The current study evaluate the effect of eugenol in a eugenol-based endodontic sealer on marginal adaptation of composite resin restorations with and without thermo-mechanical stress. METHODOLOGY: Thirty Class V cavities with half of the cavity margins in dentine and half of the cavity margins in enamel were prepared in extracted human premolars and then divided into 5 groups. Teeth in group 1 were not contaminated with eugenol. Cavities in groups 2 - 4 were contaminated with a eugenol-based sealer (Tubli-Seal, Kerr) and cleaned with: (i) sandblasting, (ii) <b>bur</b> <b>finishing</b> alone or (iii) <b>bur</b> <b>finishing</b> combined with swabbing with alcohol. These 4 groups were temporized for 6 weeks (Ketac, ESPE), whilst group 5 received no eugenol, was not temporized and acted as the control. Cavities were restored with Tetric Ceram using Syntac Classic (Vivadent) as a dentine-bonding agent. The specimens were then thermo-mechanically stressed. The percentages of marginal adaptation in dentinal and enamel margins were assessed in a SEM at x 200 magnification before and after stress using a replica method. Mean percentages of marginal adaptation were calculated and compared using a two way-ANOVA (influence of eugenol and cleaning procedure) and non-parametric tests. RESULTS: Marginal adaptation in enamel exceeded 95 % and 92 % in all specimens before and after thermo-mechanical stress, respectively. Before stress, marginal adaptation in dentine ranged from 92. 3 +/- 7. 9 % to 95. 7 +/- 6. 2 % in groups 1 - 5. After stress, the percentage of marginal adaptation in dentine decreased significantly overall (P 0. 05) : in contrast, there was a significantly beneficial effect when the entire cavity was <b>finished</b> with <b>burs</b> (P < 0. 01). CONCLUSIONS: Under the conditions of this study, the eugenol containing sealer did not significantly impair marginal adaptation in dentinal margins of mixed Class V restorations when <b>bur</b> <b>finishing</b> was employed before placement.

MethodsThirty patients received sixty different restorations. The distributions of materials and the teeth locations were randomized. Class V cavity was prepared according to caries extension. For cavities to be restored with composite a 1  mm bevel {{was placed on the}} enamel margin to increase the surface area for bonding. adhesives were used following the manufacturer's instructions. Grandio SO with its adhesive and Ketac N 100 restorative materials were applied following manufacturer's instructions. Finishing and polishing was performed using <b>finishing</b> <b>burs</b> and polishing discs. Each restoration was clinically evaluated at base line (24  h), 6 months and after one year using USPHS criteria. ResultsThe recall rate was (81. 7 %) after 1 year. Survival rate for Grandio SO restorations were (85. 185 %) while for Ketac N 100, it was (100 %) after one year of clinical service. Using Friedman test, a significant difference was recorded between the tested materials when the effect of time was tested on restoration fracture, color match, anatomic form, marginal adaptation and recurrence of caries. Using Fischer's exact test, a significant difference was recorded between tested groups regarding restoration fracture, color match. Anatomic form, recurrence of caries, marginal discoloration and postoperative hypersensitivity. ConclusionMost of the restorations maintained good quality during the observation period, which was considered a short evaluation time. Clinical implicationsGrandio SO and Ketac N 100 achieved clinically acceptable results after one year of service. So both materials may be used with confidence in Class V carious lesions. A longer evaluation period may be recommended to decide the use of restorative material safely in Class V cavities...|$|R

40|$|INTRODUCTION: The {{finishing}} {{and polishing}} phases {{are essential to}} improve smoothness and shining {{on the surface of}} acrylic resins used to make removable orthodontic appliances. A good surface finishing reduces roughness, which facilitates hygiene, prevents staining and provides greater comfort to the patients. OBJECTIVE: The aim of this paper was to analyze the changes on surface morphology of acrylic resins during finishing and polishing phases. METHODS: Thirty discs (10 mm in diameter and 5 mm in length) were made with acrylic resin and randomly divided into ten groups. The control group did not receive any treatment while the other groups received gradual finishing and polishing. The last group received the entire finishing and polishing procedures. Surface morphology was qualitatively analyzed through scanning electron microscopy and quantitatively analyzed through a laser profilometer test. RESULTS: The acrylic resin surfaces without treatment showed bubbles which were not observed in the subsequent phases. Wearing out with multilaminated <b>burs,</b> <b>finishing</b> with wood sandpaper and finishing with water sandpaper resulted in surfaces with decreasing irregularities. The surfaces that were polished with pumice and with low abrasive liquids showed high superficial smoothness. CONCLUSION: Highly smooth acrylic resin surfaces can be obtained after mechanical finishing and polishing performed with multilaminated burs, wood sandpaper, water sandpaper, pumice and low abrasive liquids...|$|R
30|$|A {{total number}} of 80 human {{permanent}} incisors, without caries, obvious defects, or attrition, extracted for periodontal causes {{over a period of}} 6 months, were selected for this study. The teeth were thoroughly cleaned and stored in distilled water and thymol at room temperature. The preparation of the labial surfaces of all the incisors and the direct application of the nanofilled composite (Tetric Evo-ceram, Ivoclar Vivadent AG, Schaan) laminate veneers were carried out by the same clinician according to the manufacturer’s instructions. All nanofilled composite laminate veneers were <b>finished</b> using diamond <b>bur</b> and aluminum oxide polishing paste. The 80 teeth were then divided into four groups of 20 teeth; each group was allocated to receive a different laminate surface treatment. In group 1, the laminates were roughened with a diamond bur with grit sizes of 125 to 150 mm (863 Grit; Drendell and Zweilling, Berlin, Germany). In group 2, the laminates were abraded with a microetcher (50 -μm alumina particles; Microetcher ERC, Danville Engineering Inc., Danville, CA, USA). Group 3, the laminates were exposed to 38 % phosphoric acid (3 M ESPE, St Paul, Minnesota, USA) for 60 s, then rinsed with water for 60 s, and dried with compressed oil-free air. Group 4 is the control group which receives no surface treatment. Bracket bonding was carried out after 24 h of laminate placement.|$|R
40|$|Trabalho final do 5 º ano com vista à atribuição do grau de mestre no âmbito do ciclo de estudos de Mestrado Integrado em Medicina Dentária apresentado à Faculdade de Medicina da Universidade de Coimbra. Statement of {{the problem}} Recently, and {{attempting}} to overcome some limitations of the conventional tools, instruments obtained by a process of chemical vapour deposition (CVD) appeared with promising features and alleged advantages in many applications, such as preparation and finishing in fixed prosthodontics procedures. However, {{there is still no}} conclusive evidence of their superior performance. Objectives The aim {{of this study is to}} test different types of CVD-obtained instruments in crown preparations, using profilometric evaluation of surface roughness and three-dimensional form, in order to demonstrate, in a scientific manner, the advantages or disadvantages of these instruments, as well as diagnose possible flaws or confirm the accuracy of the methodology, thus being called a pilot study. Materials and methods Margin preparations were made, with the aid of a parallelometer, applying different methods of preparation and finishing in a split-tooth model. The margins were photographed with high magnification, and then a 3 D profilometric evaluation was made, resulting in values for different roughness parameters, as well as three-dimensional images of the surface. Results The group prepared and <b>finished</b> with CVD <b>burs</b> achieved the lowest roughness values. The highest scores were associated to the group prepared with high-speed diamond <b>burs</b> and <b>finishing</b> made with CVD ultrasonic tips. Groups 4 and 1 achieved both median scores, whereas the latter presented greater variability. However, in a visual analysis of the three-dimensional images, groups 2 and 4 (both finished using CVD ultrasonic tips) show a more regular and smooth surface, with less relief marks, opposing to the ones corresponding to groups 1 and 3, which show a more pronounced bur path, matching its movements along the margin. Conclusion Preparations made with CVD burs present the best roughness results, conventional diamond burs presented the most variable ones and the association between conventional diamond burs and CVD ultrasonic tips presented the worst values. Nonetheless, by examining the three-dimensional images and taking in consideration a whole set of success parameters, groups finished using CVD ultrasonic tips seem to deliver better conditions for a positive outcome of fixed prosthodontic restorations by providing more precise, well-defined and sharp margins, which can enhance marginal fit, castability and aesthetics. Clinical significance Clinically, the definition, sharpness and precision on the margins are more important features than roughness, as dissected on this study. Provided that margins produced with CVD ultrasonic excel on these characteristics, this makes them a valid and important tool in the execution of a successful fixed prosthodontics restoration...|$|R
40|$|Avaliou-se clinicamente 2 resinas compostas (Z- 100 e Fill Magic),quanto a: sensibilidade pós-operatória, forma anatômica, cárie secundária, integridade marginal, descoloração marginal, cor e a influência do período de observação (baseline, 6 meses, 1 ano e 2 anos) no desempenho desses fatores. Participaram 43 pacientes, que receberam 2 restaurações de classe III, 1 de cada resina, totalizando 86 restaurações. Fez-se a avaliação inicial das restaurações, o baseline, 7 dias após a sua confecção, por 2 examinadores. Cada item recebia um escore em 3 níveis: bom (0), aceitável (1) e inaceitável (2). Somente para a cárie considerava-se 2 níveis: ausente (0) e presente (1). Fotografou-se as restaurações em todos os períodos de observação. Obteve-se moldagens das restaurações de 10 pacientes, para análise e fotografias em Microscópio Eletrônico de Varredura, com aumento de 40 X. Dos 43 pacientes, 8 não retornaram, assim, analisou-se estatisticamente pelo teste exato de Fisher, 70 restaurações. No baseline, 34 restaurações com a resina composta Z- 100 e 35 com a Fill Magic receberam escores zero em todas as categorias, com exceção de 1 caso com a resina Z- 100 que recebeu escore 1 para o critério cor. Para esse mesmo critério, aos 6 meses, 35 restaurações com a Fill Magic e com a Z- 100, 31 restaurações receberam escores zero e 4 mereceram escores 1. Em 1 ano, 31 restaurações com a Z- 100 ficaram com escores zero e 4 com escores 1; 34 restaurações com Fill Magic obtiveram escores zero e 1 obteve escore 1, com relação à cor. Aos 2 anos, também com relação à cor, para 3 restaurações com Z- 100 e para 1 com Fill Magic atribuíram-se escores 1; escores 0 foram aplicados a 32 das restaurações de Z- 100 e a 34 das de Fill Magic. Exceto para a categoria cor, que sofreu mudanças com o passar do tempo, todas as restaurações receberam escores 0 na avaliação baseline, 6 meses, 1 ano e 2 anos. Nenhum escore 2 foi anotado. Não observou-se diferença estatisticamente significante entre as 2 resinas compostas, aceitando-se a hipótese de igualdade entre as mesmas. The {{purpose of}} this study was to {{clinically}} evaluate two composite resins at 2 -year period. Seventy Class III restorations were made by only one operator, 35 with Z- 100 composite resin and 35 with Fill Magic. The teeth were selected based on clinical exams. Restorations included only anterior superior teeth. Following cavity preparations, under rubber dam, they were protected with calcium hydroxide and/or a glass ionomer base. Magic Adhesiv/Fill Magic (Vigodent) and Scotchbond Multipurpose Plus/Z- 100 (3 M) were used for adhesion to exposed dentin and enamel and restoration of the cavities. The cavities were restored in increments. Restorations were <b>finished</b> using multi-laminated <b>burs,</b> Sof-Lex discs and Enhance System. Evaluation was assessed after finishing and polishing approximately one week after placement (baseline), 6 months, 1 year and 2 years using the modified Ryge criteria for color, marginal discoloration, anatomic form, marginal integrity, secondary caries and post-operative sensitivity. There were three levels of scores for each category: good (0), acceptable (1) and unacceptable (2). Only for secondary caries there were 2 levels: absent (0) and present (1). Besides, it was investigated the occurrence of postoperative sensitivity, which was classified as the other scores were for another characteristics observed. At every evaluation, impressions from the restorations were made and they were examined by scanning electron microscopy. At baseline, there was one score one for category color for Z- 100 composite resin; the other restorations and the other composite resin were graded to be zero. At 6 months recall, the restorations were assessed and there were four scores one for Z- 100 composite resin. The restorations were evaluated at 1 year and the results were as follow: there were four scores one for Z- 100 composite resin and one score one for Fill Magic composite resin with regard to color. At 2 -year evaluation were observed three scores one for Z- 100 composite resin and one score one for Fill Magic. Except for color category, all the restorations received score zero either for 6 months, 1 -year and 2 - year recalls. No scores two were noted. The results were analyzed by Fisher Exact Statistical Test. No significant differences were noted between both composite resins. In conclusion, these two composite resins demonstrated excellent clinical acceptability in all categories assessed, making them suitable for anterior restorations...|$|R
