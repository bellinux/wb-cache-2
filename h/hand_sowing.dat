40|$|Intensive {{management}} {{has resulted in}} a loss of plant diversity in European floodplain grasslands. In particular, species adapted to traditional land use have largely declined or disappeared. Restoration approaches based on the conversion to traditional management systems often fail to re-establish these characteristic floodplain species (target species). We tested dispersal and microsite limitations in three studies on grassland restoration and succession in east German river valleys. In a long-term transect study, the migration of target species from source communities (reference grassland) into restoration grassland was analyzed over a period of ten years that began nine years after conversion to traditional management. A transplant experiment was set up to examine dispersal distances and vectors. Microsite limitation was tested by comparing seedling emergence in three soil disturbance treatments (deep tillage, shallow tillage, and control). The transect analysis revealed a slow migration of target species into restoration sites, reaching approximately 30 to 45 m within 19 years of restoration. Similarity indices between restoration grasslands and adjacent reference communities did not significantly increase during the ten years of observation. In the transplant study, seedlings were concentrated close to the mother plants, and dispersal distances did not exceed 3 to 4 m. The strong dispersal limitation was confirmed by an analysis of seedling survival showing no differences between restoration and reference grasslands. In the undisturbed control plots, seedling emergence following seed addition by hay transfer or <b>hand</b> <b>sowing</b> was lower than 0. 03 %. The soil disturbance treatments significantly increased recruitment, and the highest seedling numbers were observed in the deep tillage treatment, indicating microsite limitation. The results suggest that the dense sward of floodplain grasslands represents a second strong environmental filter hampering grassland succession. In conclusion, the successful restoration of floodplain grasslands requires a combination of soil disturbance and seed transfer if source populations are not available in very close vicinity...|$|E
40|$|Introduction Researchers {{frequently}} include multiple cultivars {{and fertility}} levels in field experiments. Therefore, the experiments sowing operation must represent a considerable saving {{in time and}} labor, compared to <b>hand</b> <b>sowing.</b> Greater flexibility in experimental design and setup could be achieved by equipment that enables quick changes in the cultivar and fertilizer rates from one plot to the next. A satisfactory seed drill must distribute a given quantity of seed evenly over a predetermined length of coulter row, the coulters must be spaced at exact intervals and depth of sowing must be uniform. In a self-propelled type of plot seeder, no coulter should run in a wheel track as the compaction of the soil can cause observable differences in vigor between plants in such a row and those in un-compacted rows. The machine should sow in succession from a try in which a series of seed pocket separated clearly and must be put into distributer funnel by an assistant operator. The length of gap being varied according to the nature and purpose of the plot. The objectives of this experiment were 1 - to design and construct a local self-propelled plot seeder and 2 - To compare it with the imported (Wintersteiger) plot seeder in cereal breeding programs. Materials and Methods A small-plot seeder was designed and constructed to meet this objective. The unit consists of the following basic components: a toolbar for pulling a set of six blade coulter, an air compressor for lifting and putting down the openers and metering transmission drive wheel, an operators chair and work rack, one belt seed distribution. A cone-celled and rotor seed distributor is used for seed distribution to the openers. The cone system {{is connected to the}} gearbox and allows for great flexibility in changing cultivars, crop species, and plot length. This is driven by the separate drive wheel. The cone-celled distributor sows all the seed of the sample in making one complete turn. The spinner can be equipped with a 4 or 6 outlet delivery head, depending on row spacing. The planter is fitted with hoe openers. Alternatively, spear-point openers have sometimes been used under conventional tillage systems. Seeding depth control was achieved by an adjustment screw handle. The plot seeder is being moved by a 9. 6 kW engine, and has been successfully used in applications. Field experiment established by using 4 plot length (2, 3, 4 and 6) with 4 replication by the constructed plot seeder and imported plot seeder. Crop measurements were planted height, spike m- 2, seeds/spike, Thousand kernel weight, Biological and grain yield, harvest index and drill measurements were seeding depth, uniformity of row spacing in action, seed counter performance, power requirement, slippage evenly of rows after planting. Results and Discussion Results showed that there were significant differences between the plant emergences. The emergencies were higher in plots, which planted by the new plot seeder. The differences between seed distribution of openers were insignificant, but the variances of new plot seeder and imported plot seeder were 0. 267 and 1. 05 respectively. Mean planting depth of plots planted by the Wintersteiger plot seeder was 0. 8 cm shallower than the adjusted planting depth while mean planting depth in plots planted by constructing machine had only 0. 01 cm variation. Results of variance analysis revealed that effect of treatments on wheat grain yield and yield components was significant. So that, highest grain yield (4216 kgha- 1), biological yield (8704 kgha- 1), number of spikes per square meter (649 spike), obtained from a plot which planted by constructed plot seeder. Increasing yield of treatments which planted by constructed plot seeder might be because of increasing the number of spikes per square meter in those treatments. The mean of spike per square meter in plots of new planter was 691 spikes which were 116 spike more than plots planted by imported plot seeder. Conclusions The constructed plot seeder had up to 18500 cost reduction. The seeder was able to distribute the different type of seed to the seed tubes uniformly in laboratory tests, nevertheless it is necessary to test the constructed plot seeder in field condition by using different seed type and conducting new research project. Advantages of this planter include less variation of seed fall down in different coulters, perfect planting depth control, separate wheel for adjusting planting length, minimize the slippage of planter driven wheel and proper utility in different field condition. According to effects on crop parameters the constructed plot seeder had relative priority to imported one. In addition easily accessories supply and cheaper prime cost are profit of the designed and constructed plot seeder...|$|E

The experiment was arranged in a split-plot design with four replications. Two levels of N (300, 500 Kg/ha urea) were the main plots and the subplots were three sorghum hybrids (Sugar graze, Super dan and Speed feed). Seeds were <b>hand</b> <b>sown</b> on June 29 with an inter row space of 50 cm and a final density of 20 plant/m 2. The results showed that when the N rate increased, forage yields and percent of protein in forage and silage increased. Also panicle dry weight increased at anthesis. The N rate had no significant effect on other traits. A significant difference was observed among hybrids for all characteristics measured. Sugar graze with a bigger stem diameter was taller and produced higher number of leaves. At anthesis, plant leaf and stem dry weight was also highest for Sugar graze; however, the highest panicle dry weight belonged to Speed feed. There was a significant interaction between hybrids and N levels for dry matter production. The percent of leaf, stem and panicle dry matter was highest in sugar graze, Super dan and Speed feed, respectively. The Sugar graze produced the highest forage and dry matter yield. This hybrid produced 30 ton/ha of dry matter and 97 ton/ha of forage, respectively.  Furthermore, this cultivar had the highest percent of forage crude protein (7. 45 %) and the least percent of forage crude fiber (25. 12 %). Ensiling caused a decrease in percentage of crude protein and an increase in crude fiber. The Sugar graze and Speed feed had the highest and lowest dry matter digestibility, respectively. Based on the results obtained from this study, Sugar graze was found to be the most suitable hybrid due to its highest forage and dry matter yield and better silage quality.

The {{study was conducted}} under both greenhouse and field conditions. In the green-house, the experimental design was a split-plot, randomized-block design in time, using transplanted seedlings. The treatments were exposed to three water levels to determine species response to varying moisture availability. Plastic pots of 15. 4 cm (diameter) by 17. 9 cm (depth) were filled with 2, 800 g of sandy-loam soil and brought to field capacity. The pots were weighted twice weekly and the water lost to evapotranspiration was replaced. The plants were measured for plant height on six occasions at two week intervals. On the last measurement date, plants were harvested for above-and-below ground biomass. The field used the species treatment as in the greenhouse study and these were <b>hand</b> <b>sown</b> in 1 m 2 plots. Using a line-source sprinkler system, species responses at four water levels were examined. Soil water content in the various field plots was determined at various depths via access tubes and a neutron soil moisture probe. The experimental design was a split-plot design in time. Seedling emergence was recorded daily for the first 35 days after seeding. Plant height was measured six times during the growing season. All the species were clipped, oven-dried, and weighed {{at the end of}} the experimental period in 1982. In the greenhouse, AGDE was the dominant species, yet produced more in the MESA combination. MESA exhibited a marked decrease in production when grown with AGDE. ATCA showed a remarkable ability to survive under high water stress. Variable soil water content created in the field resulted in significant differences in germination, emergence, and establishment among planting treatments. MESA germinated and emerged faster than AGDE and ATCA, allowing it to utilize water and nutrient resources earlier than the competing species. The greatest shoot production occurred when MESA grew alone. In the AGDE-MESA combination, shading apparently reduced AGDE growth and shoot production at the two most favorable water levels.

40|$|Introduction: The latest {{report of}} the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) states that future {{emissions}} of greenhouse gases (GHGs) will continue to increase and cause climatic change (16). These conditions are also true for Iran. The three greenhouse gases associated with agriculture are carbon dioxide (CO 2), methane (CH 4), and nitrous oxide (N 2 O). The three GHGs associated with agriculture CO 2, CH 4, and N 2 O differ in their effectiveness in trapping heat and in their turnover rates in the atmosphere. This environmental change will have serious impacts on different growth and development processes of crops. Increasing temperature could affect physiological processes such as photosynthesis, respiration and partitioning of photoassimilates. Farmers are not able to change or manage the climatic conditions, but some factors such as soil, water, seed and agricultural practices can be managed to reduce the adverse impacts of climate change (32). Mitigation and adaptation are two known ways for reducing the negative impacts of climate change. Mitigation strategies are associated with decreasing greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions through management practices such as reducing chemical fertilizer application, mechanization, increasing carbon storage in agroecosystems, planting biofuel crops and moving towards organic farming (42), etc. Material and Methods: This study was carried out at the experimental field of the Ferdowsi University of Mashhad in 2011 and was repeated in 2012. The Research Station (36 ° 16 ´N, 59 ° 36 ´E) is located at about 985 m a. s. l. Average temperature and precipitation rate of the research station in two years are shown in Figure. 1. The three-factor experiment was set up in a strip-split-plot arranged in a randomized complete block design with three replications. The experimental treatments were tillage systems (conventional and reduced tillage) and residual management (remaining and leaving of maize residual) assigned to main plots and different levels of N fertilizer (0, 150, 300 and 450 kg urea ha- 1) was randomized as a subplot in tillage treatment. The seedbed preparation was made based on common practices at the location. Plot size under the trial was 4 m × 3 m so as to get 70 cm inter row spacing. Maize seeds (single-cross 704 cultivar) were <b>hand</b> <b>sown</b> in May for two years. The ideal density of the crops was considered as spacing 20 cm inter plant.

In a field experiment at Massey University in the 1994 / 95 season, the effects of fungicide application, nitrogen fertiliser application rate and time and method of harvest on seed quality and particularly seed vigour of super sweetcorn cv. Illini Gold were investigated. The experiment used a randomised split-split plot design with four replicates of each treatment. Individual plot size was 3. 25 m x 4. 75 m. Seeds were <b>hand</b> <b>sown</b> on 25 November 1995 at a spacing of 75 cm between rows and 25 cm between seeds within the row. Treatments were nitrogen (0, 100, 200 kg N/ha as urea) applied in three split side dressing (15 days after sowing, 50 days after emergence and 30 days after silking) and a fungicide (Sportak 45 EC, 0 and 37 g a. i. /ha) applied at tasselling, again during early cob development, and again at seed physiological maturity. Each treatment was split into six sub-plots for hand and machine (stationary thresher) harvest at 35 %, 25 % and 15 % seed moisture content (SMC). At each harvest, 30 cobs were picked per sub plot and 15 were then hand shelled, while 15 were fed into an Almaco STB stationary thresher running at a speed of 396 rpm. Threshed seeds were then ambient air dried to 12 % SMC. Fungicide application failed to control Fusarium spp., and these fungi were recovered from 73 - 88 % of the seeds depending on treatment. Because of this fungal infection, the highest germination recorded was 68 % (for hand harvesting at 35 %SMC), while the lowest was 48 % (for machine harvest at 15 % SMC). Abnormal seedlings resulting from Fusarium induced lesions averaged 25 %, and from 10 - 15 % of seeds were dead. Fusarium infection level increased and seed quality decreased as harvest was delayed from 35 % SMC to 15 % SMC. Seed quality (germination and vigour) was greater for hand harvested seeds then machine harvested seeds, as machine harvesting cracked seeds and lead to physical and physiological damage which nearly doubled the percentage of dead seeds. Seed quality did not differ for harvests at 25 and 35 % SMC. Nitrogen application increased the seed nitrogen content and thousand seed weight significantly, but {{had no effect on}} the seed vigour parameters recorded, including conductivity and seedling growth. Accelerated ageing vigour test results were confounded by the presence of Fusarium fungi, but whether these pathogens affected conductivity results could not be determined. Because {{of the effects of the}} Fusarium fungi, the hypothesis that the increasing availability of nitrogen would improve cell membrane integrity and therefore increase seed vigour could not be assessed. Effective control strategies for Fusarium spp. must be implemented before this hypothesis can be fairly tested in the future...|$|R
40|$|Abstract: With {{this study}} {{the effect of}} {{prescribed}} fire on the natural regeneration success of Lebanon Cedar (Cedrus libani A. Rich.) by shelterwood method was investigated at Antalya-Kaş localitiy. Split plot design with three replications was applied as experimental design. Prescribed fire was applied to slash pile at one of each main plot while the other was left as control. Main plots {{were divided into two}} subplots and equal number of seeds were used at each subplot for additional seeding by applying broadcast seeding (full seeding) or drill sowing methods. Seedling survival was recorded each year and the height growth of the seedlings was measured {{at the end of the}} fifth vegetation period. The results revealed that there were significant differences between the plots where prescribed fire was applied and the control plots for the seedling survival and height growth. Drill sowing method gave slightly better seedling survival than broadcast seeding method; however, enough seedlings were also obtained by broadcast seeding method. On the other <b>hand,</b> drill <b>sowing</b> is more expensive and difficult or sometimes even impossible to apply in karstic soils. According to the results of this and other related investigations, higher seedling survival, better development and more healthy seedlings were obtained at the areas where prescribed fire was applied, Therefore, the prescribed fire is a reliable silvicultural tool in the success of natural regeneration of Lebanon cedar at karstic lands of the Mediterranean Turkey...|$|R
40|$|AquaCrop, the FAO water {{productivity}} model, {{is used as}} a tool to predict crop production under water limiting conditions. In the first step AquaCrop was calibrated and validated for barley (Hordeum vulgare L.). Data sets of field experiments at seven different locations in four countries (Ethiopia, Italy, Syria and Montana, USA) with different climates in different years and with five different cultivars were used for model calibration and validation. The goodness-of-fit between observed and simulated soil water content, green canopy cover, biomass and grain yield was assessed by means of the coefficient of determination (R 2), the Nasha-Sutcliff efficiency (E), the index of agreement (d) and the root mean square error (RMSE). The statistical parameters indicated an adequate accuracy of simulations (validation regression of yield: R 2 = 0. 95, E = 0. 94, d = 0. 99, RMSE = 0. 34). Subsequently, sowing strategies in the semi-arid environment of northern Ethiopia were evaluated with the validated model. Dry sowing had a probability of 47 % germination failure attributable to false start of the rainy season. On the other <b>hand,</b> delay <b>sowing</b> {{at the start of the}} rainy season to eliminate germinating weeds should be kept as short as possible because grain yields strongly reduce in the season due to water stress when sowing is delayed on shallow soils. This research demonstrates the ability of AquaCrop to predict accurately crop performance with only a limited set of input variables, and the robustness of the model under various environmental and climatic conditions. © 2012 Cambridge University Press.
