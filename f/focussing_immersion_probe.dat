40|$|The {{failure of}} an F- 111 wing during a {{full-scale}} fatigue test had {{important implications for}} the structural integrity management of the RAAF F- 111 fleet. This failure was due to a fatigue crack which initiated in the bore of a fastener hole. To assure structural integrity, an automated ultrasonic inspection has been developed which will be applied to up to 1200 fastener holes in each wing. The holes are inspected from the lower surface and definitive assessments of wing serviceability must be made without removing fasteners. The inspection system uses <b>focussed</b> <b>immersion</b> <b>probes</b> to perform a 45 -degree angle-beam shear wave inspection, utilising full-waveform capture and post-processing. This style of complex, computer-based inspection system is new to the Australian Defence Organisation and challenged many existing engineering processes for performing NDT and interpreting the results. This paper reviews the application of automated ultrasonic inspection for the F- 111 lower wing skin and outlines some of the significant challenges for both the science behind the inspection and the associated engineering processes. The lessons learnt will aid the successful integration of new technologies into existing NDT practices in the future. 1...|$|R
40|$|As {{a simple}} {{model of a}} rotor spar, a {{circular}} graphite-epoxy composite laminate cylinder was subjected to cyclic torsional load. The test section of the cylindrical specimen varied from four to six plies of plus or minus 45 degree fibers, due to intentional ply overlaps and gaps. A layer of 13 -micrometer Teflon film was inserted between plies at three locations to serve as delamination initiators. A commercial X-Y scanner was mounted to the load frame to enable ultrasonic inspection without removing the specimen. A <b>focused</b> <b>immersion</b> <b>probe</b> was mounted in a captive water column with a rugged Nitrile membrane tip, which was coupled to the cylinder using a mist of soapy water. The transducer was aligned normal to the cylinder surface using the X-axis. Scanning was performed {{along the length of}} the specimen with the Y-axis and the specimen was incrementally rotated by the torsion head of the load frame. After 350 k cycles of torsion, several linear 45 degree diagonal indications appeared as 5 - 40 % attenuation of the back wall echo, with no apparent echoes from the interior of the composite, suggesting through-ply cracks in the innermost ply. Crack indications grew and new cracks appeared as torsion cycling continued. Internal reflections from delaminations associated with the growing ply cracks appeared after 500 k cycles. Three areas of extensive multi-layer delaminations appeared after 1150 k cycles. Failure of the specimen occurred at 1600 k cycles. The observed progressive damage was not associated with the Teflon inclusions. Concurrent thermographic measurements provided lower resolution confirmation of the damage observed...|$|R

40|$|Energy {{transport}} {{analysis of}} micro/nano optics {{as well as}} their optimization to achieve high-throughput deep nanoscale patterning and microscopy is the goal of this study. To understand the energy transport in nano-optical devices, the transient heating behavior of a commercial available nano-optical probe, NSOM, under pulsed laser operation is examined first. Based on the thermal analysis, it is observed that the major limitation of the NSOM probe under higher energy operation arises from the joule heating of its thin metal coating and the resulting thermal/mechanical damage during operation. Based on the understanding, a diffraction-based micro-zone plate (MZP) optical probe suffers less from joule heating and with advantages of higher optical throughput as well as longer working distance is designed and constructed. The MZP is fabricated at the end face of an optical fiber with a micro-fabrication technique based on e-beam negative tone lift-off lithography on non-planar substrates. The fabricated MZP can achieve spot sizes ~ 0. 7 ? at a focus distance of ~ 6 ? with an optical transport efficiency of 20 %, which is more than 3 orders higher than that of NSOM. To further reduce the size of the focus spot to deep sub-wavelength scales and to eliminate metallic structures which can cause joule heating during high energy operation, two all-dielectric optical probes are then designed/constructed, namely, (a) solid <b>immersion</b> <b>probe,</b> and (b) scattering dielectric probe. Both dielectric probes focus light by combining more than one of the diffraction mechanisms associated with dielectric material (e. g., refraction, solid immersion, Mie and near-field Rayleigh scattering) to achieve deep nanoscale light focusing with minimum energy loss. The solid <b>immersion</b> optical <b>probe</b> is constructed with a ball lens and microsphere for macro to micro scale focusing with far field refraction and micro to mesocale <b>focusing</b> with solid <b>immersion.</b> The ball lens and the microsphere are stacked on an optical fiber for achieving the cascade focusing configuration. The solid <b>immersion</b> <b>probe</b> can achieve a focus spot size of ~ 0. 45 ?/n (~ 0. 3 ? when n = 1. 5) on a target in the near field of the surface of the microsphere when the light is radially polarized. To achieve an even smaller focal spot in the near field, the scattering dielectric optical probe combines the verified solid <b>immersion</b> <b>probe</b> with a nano-scatterer at its focal spot. Due to the near-field Rayleigh scattering, the nano scatterer can induce a deep nanoscale spot with a diameter comparable to the forward radius of curvature of the scatterer under radially polarized light. It is verified with full wave electrodynamics simulations that the resulting scattering optical probe can achieve a ~ 10 nm spot with an intensity enhancement of ~ 10 ^ 5, which can be valuable in all kinds of bio-detection as well as nano fabrications. At the end of the Ph. D study, mechanisms for deep sub-wavelength imaging resolutions with microspheres, which is recently demonstrated in different groups, are identified with full wave electrodynamics simulations. It is found that the high spatial imaging resolution of microlenses can be attributed to refractive index of the microsphere which is placed on the target plane (i. e. solid immersion effect), refractive index of the base material of the target and polarization of the emitters...|$|R

The oxidation of S(-II) is initiated by reaction with ·OH, but it is further propagated by a free-radical chain sequence involving O_ 2. This mechanism can adequately model the observed oxidation of S(-II) in air-saturated aqueous solutions sonicated at 20 kHz and 75 W/cm^ 2 at pH ≥ 10, assuming a continuous and uniform ·OH input into solution from the imploding cavitation bubbles. At this pH range, practically all S(-II) is present in the form of HS^- and cannot undergo thermal decomposition.
