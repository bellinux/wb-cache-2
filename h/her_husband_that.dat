5|$|When Valérie becomes pregnant, {{she tells}} {{each of her}} lovers (and <b>her</b> <b>husband)</b> <b>that</b> he is the father. She gives birth to a {{stillborn}} child, however, and her husband dies soon thereafter. Hulot and Crevel are ecstatic when they hear this news, each believing that he will become her only love once the official mourning period has passed. Valérie chooses Crevel for his comfortable fortune, and they quickly wed. This news outrages Baron Montès, and he devises a plot to poison the newlyweds. Crevel and Valérie die slowly, their bodies devoured by an exotic Brazilian toxin.|$|E
5|$|Editor Donald A. Wollheim {{was working}} at Avon Books in 1952, but disliked his job. While looking for other work, he tried to persuade A. A. Wyn to begin a new {{paperback}} publishing company. Wyn was already a well-established publisher of books and pulp magazines under the name A. A. Wyn's Magazine Publishers. His magazines included Ace Mystery and Ace Sports, and it is perhaps from these titles that Ace Books got its name. Wyn liked Wollheim's idea but delayed for several months; meanwhile, Wollheim was applying for other jobs, including assistant editor at Pyramid Books. Pyramid mistakenly called Wyn's wife Rose for a reference, thinking Wollheim had worked for her. When Rose told <b>her</b> <b>husband</b> <b>that</b> Wollheim was applying for another job, Wyn made up his mind: he hired Wollheim immediately as an editor.|$|E
5|$|The next day, Rakesh tells Raj about {{a defect}} in the company's new mobile handset: a call goes to two people simultaneously—the {{intended}} recipient and another random person on the phone's contact list. Raj needs Sonia's permission to stop production, and she invites him to her house to discuss the matter. Sonia makes provocative and sexually explicit statements to Raj, who ignores her. She then aggressively tries to pursue Raj, who resists. Although he repeatedly rejects her advances, Sonia continues trying to seduce him. As he leaves, Sonia threatens to punish him for spurning her. The next day, he learns that Sonia has told <b>her</b> <b>husband</b> <b>that</b> he sexually harassed her. Since he has admitted finding Sonia attractive, his claim of innocence is not believed, and the company pressures him into resignation.|$|E

5|$|Twice Through the Heart {{is based}} on a 1992 poetry {{documentary}} of the same name that Kay had written for the BBC television series Words on Film. Kay was concerned by inequalities in how the legal system treats men and women who kill their spouses and, in particular, in how the law on provocation in the United Kingdom was then interpreted, allowing a defence to murder only in the context of what happened immediately before a homicide and excluding the battered woman defence which considers the broader context which may have involved years of violent abuse. She chose to base the poems on a specific true case, that of Amelia Rossiter, a woman in her sixties who refused to give evidence in court about the years of violence from <b>her</b> <b>husband</b> <b>that</b> eventually led to her stabbing him twice through the heart with a kitchen knife. By the time Kay's programme was broadcast, Rossiter had been freed, her conviction reduced to manslaughter after her plea of provocation was accepted.|$|E
25|$|In Kim Stanley Robinson's {{alternate}} history novel The Years of Rice and Salt (2002), Kang Tongbi is {{an apparently}} typical Chinese upper-class woman whose feet are bound. The hardships {{of women with}} bound feet are referenced several times, and after nearly losing her life during a flood due to her inability to walk or climb normally, a heavily pregnant Kang tells <b>her</b> <b>husband</b> <b>that</b> if their baby is a daughter, {{there will be no}} footbinding.|$|E
25|$|After {{having lived}} in Canaan {{for ten years}} and still childless, Sarai {{suggested}} that Abram have a child with her Egyptian handmaid Hagar, to which he agreed. This resulted in tension between Sarai and Hagar, and Sarai complained to <b>her</b> <b>husband</b> <b>that</b> the handmaid no longer respected her. At one point, Hagar fled from her mistress but returned after angels met her. She gave birth to Abram's son Ishmael when Abram was eighty-six years old.|$|E

25|$|Eugénie Glaisette {{married the}} civil {{engineer}} François Avril {{in a civil}} ceremony in May 1900 when she was aged 45. They lived at 1 avenue Malakoff (now avenue Raymond Poincaré) in the 16th arrondissement of Paris, in an apartment overlooking the place du Trocadéro. The marriage did nothing to reduce her activism. No doubt {{it was due to}} <b>her</b> <b>husband</b> <b>that</b> she was able to hold several feminist meetings in the Civil Engineers premises at 19 rue Blanche.|$|E
25|$|When Delaney {{wrote her}} memoir late in life, {{she remembered the}} Major and his wife Fanny Berry as kind slaveholders. The major told Polly and <b>her</b> <b>husband</b> <b>that</b> his slaves would be freed upon his death {{and the death of}} his wife. After the major died in a duel, Fanny Berry married Robert Wash, a lawyer later {{appointed}} as a Missouri State Supreme Court judge. When Fanny Wash died, the Berry slave family's fortunes changed. Judge Wash sold Lucy Ann's father to a plantation down the Mississippi River in the Deep South.|$|E
25|$|When Skarbek's husband, Jerzy Giżycki, was {{informed}} that Skarbek and Kowerski's services were being dispensed with, he took umbrage and abruptly bowed {{out of his own}} career as a British intelligence agent. When Skarbek told <b>her</b> <b>husband</b> <b>that</b> she loved Kowerski, Giżycki left for London, eventually emigrating to Canada. The couple were formally divorced at the Polish consulate in Berlin on 1 August 1946. Skarbek was sidelined from mainstream action. Vera Atkins, assistant to the head of F Section, later described Skarbek as a very brave woman, but a law unto herself and a loner.|$|E

25|$|Calls for {{reinforcements}} {{from the}} newly established Kingdom of Jerusalem, and Pope Paschal II, successor to Pope Urban II (who died before learning {{of the outcome of}} the crusade that he had called), urged a new expedition. He especially urged those who had taken the crusade vow but had never departed, and those who had turned back while on the march. Some of these people were already scorned at home and faced enormous pressure to return to the east; Adela of Blois, wife of Stephen, Count of Blois, who had fled from the Siege of Antioch in 1098, was so ashamed of <b>her</b> <b>husband</b> <b>that</b> she would not permit him to stay at home.|$|E
25|$|Harrod's wife, daughter, and {{son-in-law}} {{believed that}} Harrod {{had been killed}} by one of his fellow hunters, a man named Bridges. The family claimed that Harrod and his companions had not been hunting beaver, but were instead searching for a silver mine that a man named Jonathan Swift had claimed to have discovered years before. Ann Harrod claimed that she had warned <b>her</b> <b>husband</b> <b>that</b> she feared that Bridges was planning to murder him because of a dispute over some property that the two had some years earlier. Although Harrod had said he was not afraid, he made out the will. He also allowed a fellow explorer and friend, Michael Stoner, to accompany him on the trip.|$|E
25|$|Agnes’s {{relationship}} with her daughter, Julia, does not fare much better. Julia also embarrasses her mother. When Julia becomes hysterical, Tobias asks Agnes to go talk to their daughter. Agnes’s response is, “I haven’t the time.” Instead of empathizing with Julia, Agnes becomes more self-absorbed. She tells <b>her</b> <b>husband</b> <b>that</b> she has suffered far more than her daughter. This same self-absorption is apparent in all of Agnes’s relationships. She easily becomes lost in self-pity {{and at the same}} time believes herself to be above everyone around her. If she is the fulcrum of the balance in the family, Albee portrays her as a very unstable one. Albee has admitted that the character of Agnes is based on his real-life adopted mother.|$|E

25|$|At {{one of the}} {{meetings}} during the reformation Anderson and his step-daughter confessed that they had committed adultery, believing when they did so that Brigham Young {{would allow them to}} marry when he learned the facts. Their confession being full, they were rebaptized and received into full membership. They were then placed under covenant that if they again committed adultery, Anderson should suffer death. Soon after this a charge was laid against Anderson before the Council, accusing him of adultery with his step-daughter...the Council voted that Anderson must die for violating his covenants. Klingensmith went to Anderson and notified him that the orders were that he must die by having his throat cut, so that the running of his blood would atone for his sins. Anderson, being a firm believer in the doctrines and teachings of the Mormon Church, made no objections, but asked for half a day to prepare for death. His request was granted. His wife was ordered to prepare a suit of clean clothing, in which to have her husband buried, and was informed that he was to be killed for his sins, she being directed to tell those who should enquire after <b>her</b> <b>husband</b> <b>that</b> he had gone to California.|$|E
500|$|Victoria, who had matured as {{she entered}} her 30s, decided to convert to the Russian Orthodox Church in 1907, a {{decision}} that thrilled both her mother and <b>her</b> <b>husband.</b> <b>That</b> same year the first of their three children, Maria Kirillovna, was born. She was named after her grandmother and nicknamed [...] "Masha." [...] Their second daughter, Kira Kirillovna, was born in Paris in 1909. Victoria and Kirill, who had hoped for a son, were disappointed to have a girl, but named their daughter after her father.|$|E

When King Duncan becomes her overnight guest, Lady Macbeth seizes the opportunity to effect his murder. Aware her husband's temperament is [...] "too full o' the milk of human kindness" [...] for committing a regicide, she plots {{the details of the}} murder; then, countering her husband's arguments and reminding him that he first broached the matter, she belittles his courage and manhood, finally winning him to her designs.|$|E

500|$|By 1850 Josephine {{had grown}} close to George Butler, a Fellow of Exeter College, Oxford, {{whom she had}} met at several of the balls hosted around County Durham. By October that year George was sending her self-penned poems; the couple were engaged in January 1851 and married in January 1852. The Butlers set up home at 124, High Street, Oxford. George was a scholar and cleric and shared with his wife a {{commitment}} to liberal reforms and a love of Italian culture. The couple also both had a strong Christian belief and Josephine later wrote of <b>her</b> <b>husband</b> <b>that</b> they often [...] "prayed together that a holy revolution might come about and that the Kingdom of God might be established on the earth".|$|E
500|$|The {{first years}} of Marie and Ferdinand's {{marriage}} were not particularly easy, and Marie would later tell <b>her</b> <b>husband</b> <b>that</b> [...] "it is such a shame {{that we had to}} waste so many years of our youth just to learn how to live together!" [...] Gradually, the couple's relationship became based on a cordial friendship: Marie accorded Ferdinand respect she believed he was due as a man and, later, as king, and he respected her because he realised that she had {{a better understanding of the}} world than he did. Eventually, Marie came to believe that she and Ferdinand were [...] "the best associates, the most loyal companions, but our lives intertwine only in certain matters". Ferdinand enjoyed Marie's presence during military marches and consequently, she was frequently invited to this sort of event.|$|E
500|$|Notorious {{scenes in}} the play include [...] "the china scene", a {{sustained}} double entendre dialogue mostly heard from off stage, where Horner is purportedly discussing his china collection {{with two of his}} lady friends. The husband of Lady Fidget and the grandmother of Mrs. Squeamish are listening front stage and nodding in approval, failing to pick up the double meaning which is obvious to the audience. Lady Fidget has already explained to <b>her</b> <b>husband</b> <b>that</b> Horner [...] "knows china very well, and has himself very good, but will not let me see it lest I should beg some. But I will find it out, and have what I came for yet" [...] (IV.iii.110). Dialogue such as this made [...] "china" [...] a dirty word in common conversation, Wycherley later claimed.|$|E
