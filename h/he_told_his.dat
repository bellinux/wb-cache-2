5|$|In January 1976, Ochs {{moved to}} Far Rockaway, New York, {{to live with}} his sister Sonny. He was lethargic; his only {{activities}} were watching television and playing cards with his nephews. Ochs saw a psychiatrist, who diagnosed his bipolar disorder. He was prescribed medication, and <b>he</b> <b>told</b> <b>his</b> sister he was taking it. On April 9, 1976, Ochs committed suicide by hanging himself in Sonny's home.|$|E
5|$|Surrounded, <b>he</b> <b>told</b> <b>his</b> men to die as martyrs, {{and opened}} fire. His {{defiance}} and manner {{of his death}} (which stunned the traditional leadership) electrified the Palestinian people. Thousands forced their way past police lines at the funeral in Haifa, and the secular Arab nationalist parties invoked his memory as the symbol of resistance. It was the largest political gathering ever to assemble in mandatory Palestine.|$|E
5|$|Albert {{was seriously}} ill with stomach cramps in August 1859. During {{a trip to}} Coburg {{in the autumn of}} 1860 he was driving alone in a {{carriage}} drawn by four horses that suddenly bolted. As the horses continued to gallop toward a stationary wagon waiting at a railway crossing, Albert jumped for his life from the carriage. One of the horses was killed in the collision, and Albert was badly shaken, though his only physical injuries were cuts and bruises. <b>He</b> <b>told</b> <b>his</b> brother and eldest daughter that he sensed his time had come.|$|E
60|$|And <b>he</b> <b>told</b> of <b>his</b> {{adventure}} {{while trying}} to escape from Daniel Hawkins.|$|R

5|$|De Hauteclocque {{broke his}} leg {{in two places}} in a fall from his horse in 1936. <b>He</b> <b>told</b> <b>his</b> company {{that it was his}} own fault for riding on the {{shoulder}} of the road. Thereafter he frequently walked with a cane. After another mishap involving losing his way during a tactical exercise and getting stuck in a field cordoned off with barbed wire, he told them that when you have done something really stupid, it is best to admit it.|$|E
5|$|In 1955, an {{advertisement}} encouraging children to call Santa Claus over a special telephone number was printed in Colorado Springs, Colorado. Due to an error, {{the phone number}} that was printed {{was that of the}} Continental Air Defense (CONAD). Colonel Harry Shoup was on duty on Christmas Eve 1955 and took many calls from children inquiring about Santa. <b>He</b> <b>told</b> <b>his</b> operators to give a current location for Santa Claus to any child who called in. Three years later, the North American Aerospace Defense Command (NORAD) was formed and the NORAD Tracks Santa service continued.|$|E
5|$|Like {{many people}} of his generation, Ochs deeply admired President John F. Kennedy, even though he {{disagreed}} {{with the president on}} issues such as the Bay of Pigs Invasion, the Cuban Missile Crisis, and the growing involvement of the United States in the Vietnamese civil war. When Kennedy was assassinated on November 22, 1963, Ochs wept. <b>He</b> <b>told</b> <b>his</b> wife that he {{thought he was going to}} die that night. It was the only time she ever saw Ochs cry.|$|E

5|$|When the Scott family awoke {{the next}} morning, Beauchamp {{emerged from his}} quarters. He feigned {{surprise}} when told of the murder and was apparently believed at the time. After being told there were no suspects yet, he called for his horse and began his return trip of four days to Bowling Green. Arriving, <b>he</b> <b>told</b> <b>his</b> wife Anna that Sharp was dead. The next morning, a posse from Frankfort arrived and told Beauchamp that he was under suspicion for the murder. He agreed to return with the men to Frankfort and face the charge.|$|E
5|$|As {{early as}} February 1933, Hitler {{announced}} that rearmament must be undertaken, albeit clandestinely at first, as {{to do so}} was {{in violation of the}} Versailles Treaty. A year later <b>he</b> <b>told</b> <b>his</b> military leaders that 1942 was the target date for going to war in the east. He pulled Germany out of the League of Nations in 1933, claiming its disarmament clauses were unfair as they applied only to Germany. The Saarland, which had been placed under League of Nations supervision for 15 years at the end of World War I, voted in January 1935 to become part of Germany. In March 1935, Hitler announced that the Reichswehr would be increased to 550,000 men and that he was creating an air force. Britain agreed that the Germans would be allowed to build a naval fleet with the signing of the Anglo-German Naval Agreement on 18 June 1935.|$|E
5|$|As {{the head}} of research, Kaspersky {{authored}} papers on viruses and went to conferences to promote the software. He was often quoted in the technology press as an antivirus expert. He helped establish the company's Global Research and Expert Analysis Team (GReAT), which helps corporations and governments investigate IT security threats. Initially <b>he</b> <b>told</b> <b>his</b> team not to discuss cyber-terrorism publicly, to avoid giving governments {{ideas on how to}} sabotage their political opponents. After the American film Live Free or Die Hard (AKA Die Hard 4.0) (2007) was released, Kaspersky said the idea was now public. He hired the researcher that identified the Stuxnet worm, which {{is believed to be the}} first instance of state-sponsored cyberweapon. Afterwards, the company exposed the Flame virus at the request of the International Telecommunication Union. The virus was believed to have been used for cyber-espionage in Middle-Eastern countries.|$|E

5|$|Nash {{was born}} in Johannesburg, South Africa, to a Welsh mother, Jean, and English father, John, on February 7, 1974. His family moved to Regina, Saskatchewan when he was 18 months old, before {{settling}} in Victoria, British Columbia. He therefore holds British as well as Canadian citizenship. Before the family settled in Canada, his father played professional soccer {{in various parts of}} the world. Nash often played soccer and ice hockey with his younger brother Martin, and did not start playing basketball until he was 12 or 13 years old. In grade eight, however, <b>he</b> <b>told</b> <b>his</b> mother that one day he would play in the NBA and would become a star. He was neighbour to future NHL stars Russ and Geoff Courtnall, who used to babysit him and played soccer coached by Nash's father.|$|E
5|$|On {{the morning}} of what they {{suspected}} would be the general engagement, Karl Aloys zu Fürstenberg sought out the field chaplain, and requested the sacraments because, as <b>he</b> <b>told</b> <b>his</b> aide, anything can happen during a battle. Although Ostrach had been a hard-fought battle, at Engen and Stockach, the Austrian and French forces were far more concentrated—more men in a smaller space—than they had been at Ostrach, where the French forces in particular had been stretched thinly on a long line from Lake Constance to north of the Danube. At Stockach, furthermore, Jourdan had all his troops under his direct control, {{with the possible exception}} of Dominique Vandamme, who was maneuvering his small force of cavalry and light infantry into position to attempt a flanking action on the far right Austrian flank.|$|E
5|$|Playford {{went into}} the 1965 {{election}} confident that he would build upon his previous result. Labor was continuing its practice of concentrating on individual seats: this time the effort was invested in the electorates of Barossa and Glenelg. In Barossa, northern Adelaide urban sprawl was overflowing into an otherwise rural and conservative electorate; in Glenelg, a younger generation of professionals and their families were settling. On election day, 6 March, both seats fell to Labor with substantial swings. The LCL lost power {{for the first time}} in 35 years. In seats that were contested by both parties, Labor led on the primary vote with 52.7 to 43.3%. Playford stayed up on the night to see the result, and conceded defeat at midnight. He appeared calm when announcing the loss to the public, but wept when <b>he</b> <b>told</b> <b>his</b> family of it. Playford had been premier for 26 years and 126 days.|$|E
50|$|<b>He</b> never <b>told</b> <b>his</b> {{superiors}} of his son. They mindwiped Sharon, {{forcing her}} to take the identity of Hawkwoman.|$|R
60|$|And he drew rein and said, 'Nay, but I am the King.' And <b>he</b> <b>told</b> them <b>his</b> three dreams.|$|R
60|$|At breakfast {{the next}} morning Olive stopped pouring coffee when <b>he</b> <b>told</b> her <b>his</b> {{plans to go to}} the sea.|$|R
5|$|Years later colonial trader Ludovick Grant, {{who lived}} in Great Tellico and briefly {{accompanied}} Cuming during his tour, described the latter's techniques. In each town, Cuming arranged a meeting with local Cherokee leaders. He arrived fully armed at the meeting at the town council house, in defiance of custom. There he made a prepared speech {{saying that he was}} a private citizen wishing only to see their country, and that if any Indians wished to return to England with him, he would take them. He asked them to join his party in a toast to the health of King George II, and to kneel in allegiance. <b>He</b> <b>told</b> <b>his</b> guides that he would have set fire to the townhouse and killed the assembled Indians if they refused.|$|E
5|$|Hinckley was {{convinced}} {{that he would be}} Foster's equal if he became a national figure. He decided to emulate Bickle and began stalking President Jimmy Carter. He was surprised at {{how easy it was to}} get close to the president—he was only a foot away at one event—but was arrested in October 1980 at Nashville International Airport for illegal possession of firearms. Carter had made a campaign stop there, but the FBI did not connect this arrest to the President and did not notify the United States Secret Service. His parents briefly placed him under the care of a psychiatrist. Hinckley subsequently turned his attention to Ronald Reagan whose election, <b>he</b> <b>told</b> <b>his</b> parents, would be good for the country. He wrote three or four more notes to Foster in early March 1981. Foster gave these notes to her dean, who gave them to the Yale police department, who sought but failed to track Hinckley down.|$|E
5|$|In December 1984, Silcott {{was arrested}} {{for the murder of}} a 22-year-old boxer, Anthony Smith, at a party in Hackney. Smith had been slashed more than once on his face, there were two wounds to his abdomen, a lung had been lacerated and his aorta cut. Silcott was charged with the murder in May 1985 and was out on bail when Blakelock was killed in October that year. At first he told police he had not known Smith and had not been at the party, {{although}} at trial he acknowledged having been there. He said Smith had started punching him, and that he had pushed Smith back but had not been carrying a knife. Silcott was convicted of Smith's murder in February 1986, while awaiting trial for the Blakelock murder, and was sentenced to life imprisonment; he was released in 2003 after serving 17 years. After the conviction <b>he</b> <b>told</b> <b>his</b> lawyer he had indeed known Smith, that there had been bad blood between them, and that he had stabbed the man in self-defence, because one of Smith's friends had had a knife.|$|E

5|$|Meanwhile, Grace and Jack are {{discussing}} their own problems. Grace uses Jack's promiscuous history with married men {{as a legitimate}} reason to have {{an affair with a}} married man, but Jack tells her to forget about it as both of them are the moral role models to their friends. After being honest with her, Jack confesses that the reason he is wearing an eye patch is not because he got glitter in his eye, as <b>he</b> <b>told</b> <b>his</b> friends. When he refused to stop his singing performance during the debut of his new talk show, Jack Talk, even though the entire set had accidentally been set on fire, his eyebrow was burnt off. Later, Will, Grace, and Jack all decide that it would be for the best to let Karen know the truth about Stan. Will breaks the news to her, but Karen believes he is joking. Rosario tells Karen that Stan is not dead, as she has been giving him reports on Karen. At the admission, Karen fires Rosario and leaves Will's apartment with Malcolm, explaining that Stan may be alive, but that he is still dead to her.|$|E
5|$|The {{following}} year Soegija asked {{to join the}} Catholic-education classes, citing a desire to fully use the facilities at Xaverius. His teacher, Father Mertens, told Soegija that he required permission from his parents first; although they refused, Soegija was nevertheless allowed to study Catholicism. He was intrigued by the Trinity, and asked several of the priests for clarification. Van Lith cited the works of Thomas Aquinas, while Mertens discussed the Trinity as explained by Augustine of Hippo; the latter told him that humans were not meant to understand God with their limited knowledge. Soegija, who wanted to learn more, asked to be baptised, quoting the Finding in the Temple to show why he should not need his parents' permission. The priests agreed, and Soegija was baptised on 24December 1910, taking the baptismal name Albertus, for Albertus Magnus. During Christmas holidays, <b>he</b> <b>told</b> <b>his</b> family that he had converted. Although his immediate family eventually accepted this, and may have eventually supported him, Soegija's other relatives refused {{to speak to him}} afterwards.|$|E
5|$|The {{incident}} proved stressful for Hendrix, and it weighed {{heavily on}} his mind during the seven months that he awaited trial. Two weeks after the arrest, <b>he</b> <b>told</b> <b>his</b> friend, journalist Sharon Lawrence, that his fear of needles discouraged him from using heroin and that associating with junkies had convinced him {{it was not a}} drug he wanted to use. Both of Hendrix's Experience bandmates, Mitch Mitchell and Noel Redding, later stated that they had been warned about a planned drug bust the day before flying to Toronto and they believed that drugs had been planted in Hendrix's bag. Although Hendrix {{was one of the biggest}} stars in North America at the time, and the world's highest-paid performer, only a couple of Toronto newspapers carried the story. His public relations manager, Michael Goldstein, later revealed that he bribed a member of the Associated Press with a case of liquor in an effort to prevent the story from going out on the news wire.|$|E
