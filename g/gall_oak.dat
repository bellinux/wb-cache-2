25|$|Oak marble galls {{develop as}} a {{chemically}} induced distortion of leaf buds on pedunculate oak (Quercus robur), sessile oak (Quercus petraea) or their hybrid Quercus × rosacea, trees, {{caused by the}} parthenogenetic gall wasp (Andricus kollari, (Hartig, 1843)) which lays eggs within leaf buds using their ovipositor. The Turkey oak (Quercus cerris), introduced into Britain in 1735, {{is required for the}} completion of the life cycle of the gall. The oak marble gall is frequently confused with the oak apple gall, caused by another gall wasp, Biorhiza pallida. Oak marble galls are also known as the bullet <b>gall,</b> <b>oak</b> nut or Devonshire gall. Synonyms for the species are Cynips kollari, Andricus quercusgemmae, A. minor, A. indigenus and A. circulans.|$|E

50|$|A {{major feature}} of the Armentia park is its {{extensive}} covering of natural woodland (104 ha), representing more than 70% of its surface area. The dominating species of the forest of Armentia is the <b>gall</b> <b>oak.</b> The park has grown over the last 25 years with the plantation {{of a wide variety}} of tree species, distributed over 40 ha of land formerly used for farming.|$|E
50|$|In the mid-90s, {{the wood}} showed clear signs of {{degradation}} {{such as the}} accumulation of rubbish, remains of bonfires, and excessive number of pathways and tracks and numerous eroded and flooded areas. The disorderly influx of visitors and especially vehicles were the main threat {{for the conservation of}} this park. The natural <b>gall</b> <b>oak</b> wood contained a large number of small, bushy trees with badly formed bases, and there were few well-developed mature trees.|$|E
50|$|The park {{possesses}} a huge natural wealth, with really different fauna and flora. Some plant here are endemic, like the Spanish Fir (Abies pinsapo) or the <b>Gall</b> <b>Oak.</b> Other animal {{species such as}} the ibex or the otter maintain in this reserve populations of stable individual species. There is one Spanish Fir, the Pinsapo de Las Escaleretas, which has been declared a natural monument. The park also has a chestnut 800 or 1000 years old, the Castaño Santo.|$|E

5000|$|The Tzippori stream (Nahal Tzippori) {{trail segment}} covers {{one of the}} {{geographical}} areas least familiar to many travelers. This area of <b>gall</b> <b>oaks</b> (known in Hebrew as [...] "Alon HaTavor" [...] - Tabor oak) also features birch trees and carpets of blossom in winter and spring. Along the trail are streams of flowing water, improvised water pumps, a castle named [...] "The Monks Mill" [...] (Takhanat HaNezirim), {{and the remains of}} another impressive gristmill at the Alil ruins (Khurbat Alil).|$|R
50|$|The {{fires and}} {{excessive}} {{exploitation of the}} last two decades placed the forest of Armentia in a very precarious state of conservation. In 1974, the Provincial Council of Álava, the owner of this land, began work to improve the <b>gall</b> <b>oak</b> wood and thus initiated the creation of a botanical park in the deforested areas, including native species together with other, more exotic plants and trees. The maples, rowan trees, cypresses and many other species date from that period.|$|E
50|$|Its oceanic or {{transitional}} climate dictates {{the annual}} fluctuations in heat. The abundant rainfall {{throughout the year}} favours the colour, vegetation and particular “atmosphere” prevalent in Valdegovía. The region’s vegetation is particularly characterised by pinewoods of albar pine, kermes oak, <b>gall</b> <b>oak</b> and beech. There are also other very typical vegetation types such as scrub, rock plants and vegetation associated with natural springs and still water. The most common mammals {{in the region are}} the roe deer, wild boar, fox and hare.|$|E

40|$|The {{purpose of}} this work was to purify and, it possible, to isolate an antihistamine-like principle(s) from the Hungarian <b>oak</b> <b>gall.</b> Although the study fell short of {{isolating}} the active principle(s), it succeeded in obtaining a highly purified tannin-tree fraction by silica gel G and sephadex LH- 20 column chromatography. According to the thin layer chromatography, the active tractions so obtained still contain at least 4 - 8 substances. The antihistamine-like activity of the purified <b>oak</b> <b>gall</b> extract was {{compared to that of}} tomatine and gomatine in the guinea pigs. All three substances significantly inhibited histamine-induced bronchoconstriction. Tomatine and gomatine significantly reduced the effects of both histamine and bradykinin but the purified <b>oak</b> <b>gall</b> extract only antagonized the histaminic affects. Gomatine and the purified <b>oak</b> <b>gall</b> extract but not tomatine exerted anti-anaphylactic activity. None of the three substances inhibited the PCA reaction...|$|R
5000|$|Tolox is a {{town and}} {{municipality}} {{in the province of}} Málaga in the autonomous community of Andalusia in southern Spain. The municipality has a population of 2,317 (2006). It is situated in the centre of the Sierra de las Nieves Nature Park {{at the foot of the}} Sierra Blanca and the Sierra Parda. In addition to La Torrecilla peak (1,919 m.), there are ancient woodlands of Spanish Fir and <b>gall</b> <b>oak.</b> The municipality covers 94 km2, has a mean elevation of 285 m. and mean geographical coordinates of 36° 41' 11" [...] N, 4° 54' 16" [...] E.

50|$|The most {{commonly}} accepted {{theory is that}} the first pigs were brought to the Iberian Peninsula by the Phoenicians from the Eastern Mediterranean coast (current day Lebanon), where they interbred with wild boars. This cross gave rise to the ancestors of what are today Iberian pigs. The production of Iberian pig is deeply rooted to the Mediterranean ecosystem. It is a rare example in the world swine production where the pig contributes so decisively to the preservation of the ecosystem. The Iberian breed is currently one of the few examples of a domesticated breed which has adapted to a pastoral setting where the land is particularly rich in natural resources, in this case acorns from the holm oak, <b>gall</b> <b>oak</b> and cork oak.|$|E
50|$|Within these {{mountain}} ranges is Spain's largest continuous area of pine forest, {{with representatives of}} nearly all pine species found in the Iberian Peninsula, the most abundant being European black pine (Pinus nigra). These species were repopulated long ago and their growth has been aided by abundant rainfall. Beginning 900 m above sea level are forests of Aleppo pine (Pinus halepensis), accompanied by strawberry trees (Arbutus unedo) and mastic (Pistacia lentiscus), more typical of the Mediterranean forests that once stood here. Yet higher are forests of holm oak (Quercus ilex), Portuguese oak (Quercus faginea), and <b>gall</b> <b>oak</b> (Quercus lusitanica), and important areas of maritime pine (Pinus pinaster). In the wettest areas are ancient yews (Taxus baccata) and European holly (Ilex aquifolium), both scarce in Andalusia. Along the rivers are ash, willows, and poplars as well as reeds and cattails that provide shelter to waterfowl and small mammals.|$|E
50|$|Originally the {{mountains}} {{were covered in}} maple and oak forests.These trees was largely cleared for agriculture and charcoal production, causing erosion.In an effort to stabilize the land {{in the last century}} the mountain slopes were planted with Aleppo, Laricio and Austrian pines, now the dominant types of tree.Less common evergreens include maritime pines, Atlas cedars and Spanish firs.The north of the park has deciduous woodlands with native holm oak as well as <b>gall</b> <b>oaks</b> and maples.The higher-altitude oak woods harbor shrubs beneath the trees that include Spanish barberry, hedgehog broom various species of dog roses.There are many smaller species of flowering plants.|$|R
