On October 1 it entered the eastern Pacific Ocean, and continuing westward it <b>developed</b> an area of persistent convection on October 5. Initially the system was disorganized, although gradual development was expected as conditions in the upper-levels of the atmosphere were expected to become more favorable. On October 7 it <b>developed</b> a broad low pressure area, and by the next day it was located in the eastern portion of a large area of disturbed weather; the western portion of the system later <b>developed</b> into Tropical Storm Olivia. The eastern system <b>developed</b> organized convection near its center, and <b>developed</b> into Tropical Depression Fifteen-E at 0000UTC on October 9, about 765mi (1235km) southwest of the southern tip of the Baja California Peninsula.|$|E

40|$|Driven by {{globalization}} and increased financial integration, {{the last decade}} has seen many foreign banks entering <b>developing</b> countries. Although the majority of these banks are from high-income countries, recently banks from <b>developing</b> countries have followed suit. This paper looks at this phenomenon, by examining the differences and similarities between <b>developing</b> and high-income country foreign banks. Using a large dataset on banking sector FDI in <b>developing</b> countries, we find that 27 percent of all foreign banks in <b>developing</b> countries are owned by a bank from another <b>developing</b> country, while these banks hold 5 percent of the foreign assets. The importance of <b>developing</b> country foreign banks is much larger in low-income countries (both in number of banks and in terms of assets) and this type of foreign banking is strongly regionally concentrated. Although foreign bank entry by both <b>developing</b> country as well as high-income country banks seems to be driven by economic integration, common language and proximity, banks from <b>developing</b> countries are more likely to invest in small <b>developing</b> countries with weak institutions where high-income country banks are reluctant to go. This result seems to suggest that <b>developing</b> country banks have a competitive advantage dealing with countries with a weak institutional climate. Furthermore, our results indicate that <b>developing</b> country foreign banks have a higher interest margin and are less profitable than foreign banks from high-income countries...|$|R
