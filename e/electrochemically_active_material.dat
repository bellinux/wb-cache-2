Component control of MOFs remains a significant challenge. Herein, we demonstrate a solvothermal method to realize nanostructure engineering of 2 D nanoflake MOFs. The hollow structures with Ni/Co- and Ni-MOF (denoted as Ni/Co-MOF nanoflakes and Ni-MOF nanoflakes) were assembled for their electrochemical performance optimizations in supercapacitors and in the oxygen reduction reaction (ORR). As a result, the Ni/Co-MOF nanoflakes exhibited remarkably enhanced performance with a specific capacitance of 530.4  F g− 1 at 0.5  A g− 1 in 1  M LiOH aqueous solution, much higher than that of Ni-MOF (306.8  F g− 1) and ZIF- 67 (168.3  F g− 1), a good rate capability, and a robust cycling performance with no capacity fading after 2000 cycles. Ni/Co-MOF nanoflakes also showed improved electrocatalytic performance for the ORR compared to Ni-MOF and ZIF- 67.

We provide several hypotheses regarding why the measured capacities in such architectures are well above the theoretical predictions of the known MoS 2 intercalation and conversion reactions.

Conservative forecasts predict four million electric cars on the road by 2015 (Bernhart et al., 2012). A crucial component of electric vehicles is the battery. This component affects two key performance factors, energy storage and usage. This implies that battery performance is the basis for public acceptance of electric vehicles. The lithium-ion (Li-ion) battery chemistries are the most popular battery chemistries to fulfill this requirement (especially for the complete electric vehicles) among manufacturers. The large influx of HEVs and EVs will present unique challenges for the safe disposal and recycling of their batteries at the end of product life. The high energy density, ironically the characteristic that makes the Li-ion batteries ideal for electric drive, is the cause for concern in handling and processing them at their end of life. However, recycling end-of-life batteries for their constituent metals has multifold advantages. If successful, recycling may effectively mitigate environmental effects of mining/ brine extractions for virgin metals and raw material transportation emissions. In addition, it can also balance fluctuating cost dynamics and ensure a steady supply of raw material.

These advantages include the following: a) Stimuli and responses could be localized at finer scales of spatial and temporal resolution, which is at subcellular level, with fewer disturbances to, and less interference from, adjacent regions. b) There would be less risk of hemorrhage on implantation because nano-electrode-based probe tips could be configured to be less traumatic. c) Being more biocompatible than are metal electrodes, carbon-nanotube-based electrodes and arrays would be more suitable for long-term or permanent implantation. d) Unlike macro- and microelectrodes, a nano-electrode could penetrate a cell membrane with minimal disruption. Thus, for example, a nanoelectrode could be used to generate an action potential inside a neuron or in proximity of an active neuron zone.

However, much attention is paid to the formulation engineering in the field of battery industry, because it is critically significant in order to manufacture efficient full cells which can be commercialized.

This study is focused on the optimization of full cell formulation factors based on silicon-natural graphite composite negative electrode. The considered factors were composition of active materials, binder, electrolyte and cutoff voltage in a full cell. The effect of different particle sizes of natural graphite within the composite, which is composed of silicon and natural graphite, was investigated, in which the composite with smaller natural graphite showed the superior electrical conductive network. The experiment showed that the silicon based composite electrode keeps higher voltage profile than that of natural graphite, especially during delithiation in the half cell. And, the simulation result, computed out of the experimental result, envisioned that it is better to shift cutoff voltage to the lower voltage during discharge in the full cell consisting of silicon–natural graphite composite electrode in order to use the maximum capacity of each electrode, comparing with that of natural graphite electrode. Additionally, a design method of calculating initial discharge capacity in a full cell was investigated. A statistical analysis method making use of Design of Experiments (DOE) was applied to search for the optimized condition for the weight ratio of binder mixture and the electrolyte kind, which showed that the cycle life of silicon-natural graphite composite electrode with the PAA or CMC binders is superior to that with SBR binder. This experimental result enabled me to argue that those binders, which have mechanically high ‘proportional limit stress’ like PAA and CMC, provide more robust bonds among expansive active materials (Si) which, in turn, can be adhered solidly to current collector substrate, compared with SBR and PVDF which have low ‘proportional limit stress’.

40|$|The {{study of}} ion {{transport}} in <b>electrochemically</b> <b>active</b> <b>materials</b> for energy storage systems requires simulations on quantum- atomistic- and mesoscales. The methods accessing these scales {{not only have}} to be effective but also well compatible to provide a full description of the underlying processes. We propose to adapt the Generalized Shadow Hybrid Monte Carlo (GSHMC) method to atomistic simulation of ion intercalation electrode materials for batteries. The method has never been applied to simulations in solid state chemistry but it has been successfully used for simulation of biological macromolecules, demonstrating better performance and accuracy than can be achieved with the popular molecular dynamics (MD) method. It has been also extended to simulations on meso-scales, making it even more attractive for simulation of battery materials. We combine GSHMC with the dynamical Core-Shell model to incorporate polarizability into the simulation and apply the new Modified Adaptive Integration Approach, MAIA, which allows for a larger time step due to its excellent conservation properties. Also, we modify the GSHMC method, without losing its performance and accuracy, to reduce the negative effect of introducing a shell mass within a dynamical shell model. The proposed approach has been tested on olivine NaFePO 4, which is a promising cathode material for Na-ion batteries. The calculated Na-ion diffusion and structural properties have been compared with the available experimental data and with the results obtained using MD and the original GSHMC method. Based on these tests, we claim that the new technique is advantageous over MD and the conventional GSHMC and can be recommended for studies of other solid-state electrode and electrolyte materials whenever high accuracy and efficient sampling are critical for obtaining tractable simulation results...|$|R
40|$|The {{development}} of a sensor for the precise and selective measurement of biological analytes (such as dopamine (DA), nitric oxide (NO), hydrogen peroxide (H 2 O 2) and L-Cysteine (L-Cys)) at the low levels characteristic of living systems can make a great contribution to disease diagnosis. The discovery of an electrochemical technique {{for the detection of}} various biological analytes was induced by the strong demand on developing a sensing technique that able to offer a rapid response, high sensitivity, simplicity and low operating cost. In order to enhance the analytical performance of electrochemical biosensor, several challenges associated with the sensors need to be solved including: (i) sluggish electron-transfer rate properties at the electrode's surface which led to the poor response signal; (ii) limited sensitivity and selectivity capabilities towards target analyte detection due to occurrence of fouling effect; and (iii) overlapping voltammetric response caused by the co-existence of various interfering species. We have sought to address these problems through chemical modification of conventional working electrode surface with an <b>electrochemically</b> <b>active</b> <b>material,</b> which is reduced graphene oxide (rGO) -based material. The thesis reports the preparation of novel reduced graphene oxide-nafion@metal (rGO-Nf@metal) nanohybrid materials which were then used to modify glassy carbon electrode (GCE) for the detection of various biological analytes. The strategy of using these nanohybrid materials is driven by the excellent individual properties owned by rGO and metal nanoparticles which essential in boosting the sensing performance. There are four important studies that have been presented in this thesis; (i) reduced graphene oxide-nafion (rGO-Nf) nanohybrid modified electrode for electrochemical detection of DA and NO; (ii) reduced graphene oxide-nafion@silver (rGO-Nf@Ag) nanohybrid modified electrode for electrochemical detection of H 2 O 2; (iii) reduced graphene oxide-nafion@gold (rGO-Nf@Au) nanohybrid modified electrode for electrochemical detection of NO; (iv) reduced graphene oxide-nafion@palladium (rGO-Nf@Pd) nanohybrid modified electrode for electrochemical detection of L-Cys. To sum up, we have successfully developed a simple, highly sensitive, and selective electrochemical sensor using rGO-Nf@metal-based nanohybrids for the detection of various biological analytes. The novelty of presented work lies in the used of simple, rapid, and facile method for synthesis that is hydrothermal method, and the used of small amount of metal which could reduce the cost of production. Moreover, the combination of three individual materials (rGO, Nf, and metal nanoparticles) to form a ternary nanohybrid material proven to be suitable material for boosting the electrochemical sensor performance, thus open up a new path to develop new catalyst for electrochemical sensor...|$|E
40|$|Eine große Herausforderung des 21. Jahrhunderts stellt die Bereitstellung von Energie unter gleichzeitiger Reduzierung der globalen Schadstoffemissionen dar. Zur Realisierung dieses Ziels sind effiziente, kostengünstige sowie umweltfreundliche Energiespeichersysteme notwendig. Lithium-Ionen-Batterien sind hierbei aussichtsreiche Kandidaten für derartige Speichersysteme. Neben der elektrochemisch aktiven Komponente wird das elektrochemische Verhalten von Lithium-Ionen-Batterie-Elektroden durch elektrochemisch inaktive Materialien sowie durch die Elektrodenarchitektur beeinflusst. Die vorliegende Arbeit beschäftigt sich hierbei mit der Struktur-Eigenschafts-Beziehung von Lithium-Ionen-Batterie-Elektroden. Als Anodenmaterial dient das sichere sowie hochleistungsfähige Li 4 Ti 5 O 12 und als Kathodenmaterial fungiert das sichere, umweltfreundliche und kostengünstige LiFePO 4. Ein guter elektrischer Kontakt zwischen der Aktivmasse und dem Stromabnehmer ist notwendig, um einen schnellen Elektronentransfer zwischen diesen beiden Komponenten zu realisieren. Um diesen Transfer zu beeinflussen, wurde die Oberfläche von den metallischen Stromabnehmern chemisch modifiziert. Mit chemischen, elektrochemischen sowie strukturaufklärenden Analysemethoden werden die Wechselwirkungen zwischen dem Stromabnehmer und der Aktivmasse als Funktion des Stromabnehmers und des Bindersystems diskutiert. Ferner wurde die Mikrostruktur von Elektroden mittels Verdichtung gezielt modifiziert. Anhand von elektrochemischen Messungen werden Schlussfolgerungen über die ionische und elektrische Leitfähigkeit in Abhängigkeit des Verdichtungsgrades gewonnen. Darüber hinaus wird der Einfluss der Primärpartikelgröße des LiFePO 4 auf die Elektrodenmikrostruktur sowie auf das elektrochemische Verhalten diskutiert. Ein weiterer Aspekt der vorliegenden Arbeit stellt die Erhöhung der Sicherheit von Lithium-Ionen-Batterien dar. Üblicherweise werden in Lithium-Ionen-Batterien Elektrolyte auf der Basis organischer Carbonate eingesetzt. Solche Carbonate sind leicht entflammbar und weisen somit ein erhebliches Gefahrenpotential auf. Um diese Gefahrenquelle zu vermeiden wird die Funktionalität der schwer entflammbaren, ionischen Flüssigkeit N-Methoxyethyl-N-methylmorpholinium Bis[(trifluoromethyl) sulfonyl]imid als Elektrolyt in Lithium-Ionen-Batterien bewertet. To {{ensure the}} energy demand {{and to reduce}} {{simultaneously}} the global pollution {{is one of the}} most important challenges within the 21 st century. Low-cost, efficient as well as environmentally friendly energy storage media are essential to meet these requirements. Among these lithium-ion batteries represent one of the most promising candidates. The electrochemistry of electrodes for lithium-ion batteries is influenced by the <b>electrochemically</b> <b>active</b> <b>material,</b> electrochemically inactive materials as well as by the electrode architecture. This work concerns with the structure-property relation of lithium-ion battery electrodes. The safe and the high-power capable Li 4 Ti 5 O 12 serves as anode material and the safe, environmentally-friendly and low-cost LiFePO 4 acts as cathode material. A good electrical con-tact between the active mass and the current collector is crucial to realize a fast electron transfer between these two components. To influence this transfer the surface of the metallic current collectors was chemically modified. Depending on the different current collectors and on the binder system the interactions between the current collector and the active mass using chemical, electrochemical as well as optical analytical methods are investigated. Furthermore, the structure of the electrodes was intentionally modified by compressing. With the help of electrochemical measurements the ionic and the electrical conductivity of such electrodes as a function of the compression is discussed. In addition the impact of the primary particle size of LiFePO 4 on the structure and on the electrochemistry is shown. Besides these investigations safety concerns of lithium-ion batteries are pointed out. Usually the electrolytes for lithium-ion batteries are based on organic carbonates. However, such electrolytes are easily flammable resulting in a significant hazard potential. To eliminate that source of danger the functionality of the flame resistant ionic liquid N-Methoxyethyl-N-methylmorpholinium bis[(trifluoromethyl) sulfonyl]imide is evaluated as an alternative electrolyte for lithium ion batteries...|$|E
40|$|The Li-ion battery has for {{a number}} of years been a key factor that has enabled an ever {{increasing}} number of modern consumer devices, while in recent years has also been sought to power a range of emerging electric and hybrid electric vehicles. Due to their importance and popularity, a number of characteristics of Li-ion batteries have been subjected to intense work aimed at radical improvement.

40|$|The {{performance}} {{and safety of}} lithium-ion batteries (LIBs) are dependent on interfacial processes at {{the positive and negative}} electrodes. For example, the surface layers that form on cathodes and anodes are known to affect the kinetics and capacity of LIBs. Interfacial reactions between the electrolyte and the electrodes are also known to initiate electrolyte combustion during thermal runaway events that compromise battery safety. Atomic layer deposition (ALD) and molecular layer deposition (MLD) are thin film deposition techniques based on sequential, self-limiting surface reactions. ALD and MLD can deposit ultrathin and conformal films on high aspect ratio and porous substrates such as composite particulate electrodes in lithium-ion batteries. The effects of electrode surface modification via ALD and MLD are studied using a variety of techniques. It was found that sub-nm thick coatings of Al 2 O 3 deposited via ALD have beneficial effects on the stability of LIB anodes and cathodes. These same Al 2 O 3 ALD films were found to improve the safety of graphite based anodes through prevention of exothermic solid electrolyte interface (SEI) degradation at elevated temperatures. Ultrathin and conformal metal alkoxide polymer films known as “metalcones” were grown utilizing MLD techniques with trimethylaluminum (TMA) or titanium tetrachloride (TiCl 4) and organic diols or triols, such as ethylene glycol (EG), glycerol (GL) or hydroquinone (HQ), as the reactants. Pyrolysis of these metalcone films under inert gas conditions {{led to the development of}} conductive metal oxide/carbon composites. The composites were found to contain sp 2 carbon using micro-Raman spectroscopy in the pyrolyzed films with pyrolysis temperatures ≥ 600 °C. Four point probe measurements demonstrated that the graphitic sp 2 carbon domains in the metalcone films grown using GL and HQ led to significant conductivity. The pyrolysis of conformal MLD films to obtain conductive metal oxide/carbon composite films is presented as a method for enabling non-conductive, but possibly <b>electrochemically</b> <b>active</b> <b>materials,</b> to be used for electrochemical applications...|$|R
