5|$|Some {{members of}} the Lithuanian nobility opposed the growing Polish–Lithuanian union and offered the Lithuanian crown to Ivan IV. The Tsar {{publicly}} advertised this option, either because he took the offer seriously, or because he needed time to strengthen his Livonian troops. Throughout 1561, a Russo-Lithuanian truce (with a scheduled <b>expiration</b> <b>date</b> of 1562) was respected by both sides.|$|E
5|$|The {{contract}} for Metro's fare collection system was awarded in 1975 to Cubic Transportation Systems. Electronic fare collection using paper magnetic stripe cards started on July 1, 1977, {{a little more}} than a year after the first stations opened. Prior to electronic fare collection, exact change fareboxes were used. Metro's historic paper farecard system is also shared by Bay Area Rapid Transit, which Cubic won a {{contract for}} in 1974. Any remaining value stored on the paper cards was printed on the card at each exit, and passes were printed with the <b>expiration</b> <b>date.</b>|$|E
5|$|In {{the early}} hours of March 18, 1990, guards at the Isabella Stewart Gardner Museum in Boston {{admitted}} two men posing as police officers responding to a disturbance call. Once inside, the men tied up the guards and, over the next hour, stole 13 works of art valued at $500 millionthe largest-value theft of private property in history. Despite efforts by the Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI) and multiple probes around the world, no arrests have been made and no works have been recovered. The museum initially offered a reward of $5 million for information leading to their recovery, but in 2017 this was doubled temporarily to $10 million with an <b>expiration</b> <b>date</b> set {{to the end of the}} year.|$|E
40|$|<b>Expiration</b> <b>dates</b> on drug {{samples are}} often {{cumbersome}} to check {{due to their}} poor legibility and variable location on the containers. Consequently, many samples remain unused past their <b>expiration</b> <b>dates</b> and must be discarded. Timely use of samples can be facilitated by legibly writing their <b>expiration</b> <b>dates</b> on the top surface of their containers, stratifying all samples by their <b>expiration</b> <b>dates</b> in chronologically labeled shelves and reviewing the stock monthly. This procedure should also be useful for other dated items...|$|R

40|$|Abstract: Pharmacy {{inventory}} management (PIM) comprises business activities which are {{connected with the}} size and placement of stocked drugs. To manage minimal and maximal drugs stock, orders dynamics etc., pharmacies must track <b>expiration</b> <b>dates</b> of each drug in stock. Outdated drugs can’t be counted as stock and produce lot of costs, especially for their disposal. The most number of pharmacies in Bosnia use European Article Numbering (EAN 13) barcode by which is impossible to define drug <b>expiration</b> <b>dates.</b> Radio Frequency Identification (RFID) enables full automatization of PIM, {{but it is still}} not in use, mostly because of high costs of implementation of this system. In our research we have observed 52 Bosnian pharmacies and presented another approach to barcode technology which can be used in automatization of PIM. As the base we have used existing EAN 13 code, adding 6 digits for <b>expiration</b> <b>dates.</b> We have successfully created and tested program for extraction of EAN 13 and <b>expiration</b> <b>dates</b> from that barcode using separate files in database to keep inputs, outputs and stocks of each item by <b>expiration</b> <b>dates...</b>|$|R
5|$|In {{spite of}} Wiesenthal's protests, in late 1963 his centre in Vienna {{was taken over}} by a local {{community}} group, so he immediately set up a new independent office, funded using donations and his stipend from the Mossad. As the 20-year statute of limitations for German war crimes was about to expire, Wiesenthal began lobbying to have it extended or removed entirely. In March 1965 the Bundestag deferred the matter for five years, effectively extending the <b>expiration</b> <b>date.</b> Similar action was taken by the Austrian government. But as time went on, it became more difficult to obtain prosecutions. Witnesses grew older and {{were less likely to be}} able to offer valuable testimony. Funding for trials was inadequate, as the governments of Austria and Germany became less interested in obtaining convictions for wartime events, preferring to forget the Nazi past.|$|E
5|$|Like the Wii, the DSi {{can connect}} to an online store. The store, called the DSi Shop, {{allows users to}} {{download}} DSiWare games and applications, which are paid for with a Nintendo Points Prepaid Card (previously known as Wii Points Prepaid Card). Application prices follow a three-tiered pricing scheme. The service launched with the DSi Browser, a free web browser developed by Opera Software and Nintendo. A DSiWare trial campaign, whose <b>expiration</b> <b>date</b> varied by region, formerly offered 1,000 free Nintendo Points to each DSi that accesses the DSi Shop. As of June 2011, over 350 downloadable games were available, varying by region. Purchased DSiWare on DSi or DSi XL consoles cannot be transferred between units unless that console is repaired or replaced by Nintendo. Most DSiWare can be transferred to a 3DS, however saved data cannot.|$|E
5|$|At the Kwik-E-Mart, Apu {{is selling}} items to {{customers}} at outrageous prices, like normal. Apu scribbles out the 1989 <b>expiration</b> <b>date</b> on {{a package of}} ham and then lowers the price instead of throwing it out. Homer buys the meat, eats it, and contracts food poisoning. After recovering, Homer returns to the Kwik-E-Mart to complain, and Apu gives him two five-pound buckets of expired shrimp to placate him. Homer eats the shrimp and becomes ill again. Whilst recovering at home, Homer sees the Channel 6 investigative news program Bite Back with Kent Brockman. Lisa gives him the idea to get the show to investigate the Kwik-E-Mart. Kent gives Homer a giant novelty hat containing a spy camera to expose Apu for selling expired food. Though Homer almost immediately abandons the hat after mistaking the buzzing of the machinery as a bee, the camera catches Apu placing a hot dog that he had dropped on the ground back into the hot dog cooker. Apu is immediately fired by his company (even though he was actually following company policy), and is replaced by actor James Woods, who is doing research for a role in an upcoming film.|$|E

25|$|The <b>expiration</b> <b>date</b> of {{pharmaceuticals}} specifies {{the date}} the manufacturer guarantees the full potency {{and safety of}} a drug. Most medications continue to be effective and safe for a time after the <b>expiration</b> <b>date.</b> A rare exception {{is a case of}} renal tubular acidosis purportedly caused by expired tetracycline. A study conducted by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration covered over 100 drugs, prescription and over-the-counter. The study showed that about 90% of them were safe and effective as long as 15 years past their expiration dates. Joel Davis, a former FDA expiration-date compliance chief, said that with a handful of exceptions - notably nitroglycerin, insulin and some liquid antibiotics - most expired drugs are probably effective.|$|E
