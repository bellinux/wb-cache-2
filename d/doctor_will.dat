5|$|When {{initiating}} warfarin therapy ("warfarinization"), the <b>doctor</b> <b>will</b> {{decide how}} strong the anticoagulant therapy needs to be. The target INR {{level varies from}} case to case depending on the clinical indicators, but tends to be 2–3 in most conditions. In particular, target INR may be 2.5–3.5 (or even 3.0–4.5) in patients {{with one or more}} mechanical heart valves.|$|E
5|$|Convinced of Barclay's claims, the Doctor {{prepares to}} destroy the ship when Chakotay (Robert Beltran) arrives and gives an {{alternative}} story: The Doctor is indeed the Voyager EMH, but his program is stuck in the malfunctioning holodeck. The crew is trying to extricate his program so he only needs to wait it out; if he destroys the ship as Barclay suggests, it will prematurely end {{the program and the}} <b>Doctor</b> <b>will</b> be lost. Even though Barclay introduces Kes (Jennifer Lien) as Zimmerman's wife, the Doctor finally opts to believe in his holographic existence. The simulation ends and the Doctor finds himself on the holodeck; Chakotay's story was true and the Doctor is safely returned to sickbay.|$|E

5|$|When {{a person}} dies, a <b>doctor</b> <b>will</b> certify {{the cause of}} death if it is known and due to natural causes. He or she will then fill up a {{certificate}} of cause of death (CCOD) which will be given to the family of the deceased. If the doctor is unable to determine {{the cause of death}}, or the death is due to non-natural causes, the Criminal Procedure Code requires him to refer the case to the police. The police will provide a hearse to send the body to the Centre for Forensic Medicine (CFM) Mortuary at Block 9 of the Singapore General Hospital, which will then inform the family when to visit the mortuary.|$|E
5|$|Miss Foster accelerates her plans, {{knowing that}} the <b>Doctor</b> <b>will</b> attempt to stop her. Throughout London, the Adipose begin to spawn and soon number several thousand. The Doctor and Donna prevent total {{emergency}} parthenogenesis occurring, which would have killed those who had taken the pill, and {{the remainder of the}} young Adipose make their way to Adipose Industries. The Adiposian First Family arrive in a spaceship and begin collecting their young. The Doctor tries to warn Miss Foster about her safety, but she disregards him and is killed when the Adipose drop her from their transport beam to her death, to cover their unsanctioned colonization efforts. The Doctor refrains from killing the young Adipose because they are children, to which Donna remarks that his previous companion Martha Jones made him more human.|$|E
25|$|A <b>doctor</b> <b>will</b> {{test for}} {{prolactin}} blood levels {{in women with}} unexplained milk secretion (galactorrhea) or irregular menses or infertility, and in men with impaired sexual function and, in rare cases, milk secretion. If prolactin is high, a <b>doctor</b> <b>will</b> test thyroid function and ask first about other conditions and medications known to raise prolactin secretion. The <b>doctor</b> <b>will</b> also request a magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), {{which is the most}} sensitive test for detecting pituitary tumors and determining their size. MRI scans may be repeated periodically to assess tumor progression and the effects of therapy. Computed Tomography (CT scan) also gives an image of the pituitary, but it is less sensitive than the MRI.|$|E

25|$|On funduscopic exam, a <b>doctor</b> <b>will</b> see {{cotton wool}} spots, flame hemorrhages (similar lesions are also {{caused by the}} alpha-toxin of Clostridium novyi), and dot-blot hemorrhages.|$|E
25|$|It {{takes time}} for the islets to attach to new blood vessels and begin {{releasing}} insulin. The <b>doctor</b> <b>will</b> order many tests to check blood glucose levels after the transplant, and insulin may be needed until control is achieved.|$|E
25|$|In {{childhood}} and adulthood, the diagnosing <b>doctor</b> <b>will</b> {{look for these}} features accompanied by corroboratory evidence of hypopituitarism such as deficiency of other pituitary hormones, a structurally abnormal pituitary, or a history of damage to the pituitary. This would confirm the diagnosis; {{in the absence of}} pituitary pathology, further testing would be required.|$|E

25|$|Methylphenidate is {{available}} in numerous forms, a <b>doctor</b> <b>will</b> determine the appropriate formulation of the drug to prescribe based on the patient's history, the doctor's experiences treating other patients with methylphenidate products, and product pricing/availability. Currently available forms include a variety of tablets and capsules, an adhesive-based matrix transdermal system (transdermal patch), and an oral suspension (liquid syrup).|$|E
25|$|The <b>doctor</b> <b>will</b> {{perform a}} {{neurological}} examination to assess nerve function and motor and sensory skills. The tests {{are designed to}} determine any functional limitations, such as difficulty with handwriting {{or the ability to}} hold a utensil or cup. The patient may be asked to place a finger on the tip of her or his nose, draw a spiral, or perform other tasks or exercises.|$|E
25|$|When a {{fracture}} occurs, the doctor tries {{to bring the}} bones into a position that will promote healing and restore arm movement. If the clavicle is fractured, the patient must at first wear a strap and sling around the chest to keep the clavicle in place. After removing the strap and sling, the <b>doctor</b> <b>will</b> prescribe exercises to strengthen the shoulder and restore movement. Surgery is occasionally needed for certain clavicle fractures, especially for disunions.|$|E
50|$|It is {{important}} to build {{a good relationship with}} doctors, both primary care and specialist. Because of the rarity of the illness, many <b>doctors</b> <b>will</b> not have encountered it before. Each case of CIDP is different, and relapses, if they occur, may bring new symptoms and problems. Because of the variability in severity and progression of the disease, <b>doctors</b> <b>will</b> not be able to give a definite prognosis. A period of experimentation with different treatment regimens is likely to be necessary in order to discover the most appropriate treatment regimen for a given patient.|$|R
50|$|The {{recommended}} crew {{consists of}} mainly engineers that have knowledge in multiple fields. They will have many skills including piloting, life-support, mechanical training, and other specialties. Two medical <b>doctors</b> <b>will</b> also {{be out in}} the field. Their role will be to care for the well-being of the crew as well as to conduct biological research. The <b>doctors</b> <b>will</b> have training in psychiatry to manage any psychological problems that arise. The overall idea is that each person will have expertise in many fields because only eight people can be transported to Mars.|$|R

25|$|Doctor Stoppage/Cut: {{the referee}} will {{call for a}} time out if a fighter's ability to {{continue}} is in question {{as a result of}} apparent injuries, such as a large cut. The ring <b>doctor</b> <b>will</b> inspect the fighter and stop the match if the fighter is deemed unable to continue safely, rendering the opponent the winner. However, if the match is stopped {{as a result of an}} injury from illegal actions by the opponent, either a disqualification or no contest will be issued instead.|$|E
25|$|The four novels Longest Day by Michael Collier, Legacy of the Daleks by John Peel, Dreamstone Moon by Paul Leonard and Seeing I by Jonathan Blum and Kate Orman form a story arc. Initially, Sam flees {{from the}} Doctor after {{she finds herself}} kissing him passionately when giving him CPR and the two became separated. Although the Doctor {{eventually}} tracks her down, he is arrested and imprisoned for espionage. After three years, Sam discovers the Doctor's imprisonment and helps him to escape, realising that her relationship with the <b>Doctor</b> <b>will</b> never be anything other than platonic.|$|E
25|$|During a {{physical}} exam a doctor can {{determine whether the}} tremor occurs primarily during action or at rest. The <b>doctor</b> <b>will</b> also check for tremor symmetry, any sensory loss, weakness or muscle atrophy, or decreased reflexes. A detailed family history may indicate if the tremor is inherited. Blood or urine tests can detect thyroid malfunction, other metabolic causes, and abnormal levels of certain chemicals that can cause tremor. These tests may also help to identify contributing causes, such as drug interaction, chronic alcoholism, or another condition or disease. Diagnostic imaging using CT or MRI imaging may help determine if the tremor {{is the result of}} a structural defect or degeneration of the brain.|$|E
50|$|Crohn {{noted that}} it can be {{difficult}} for physicians to correctly differentiate neuroses from diseases of the organs. He said that all <b>doctors</b> <b>will</b> occasionally mistake diseases of the organs for neuroses or vice versa.|$|R
50|$|The HSG can be painful, so analgesics may be {{administered}} before and/or after the procedure to reduce pain. Many <b>doctors</b> <b>will</b> also prescribe an antibiotic {{prior to the}} procedure {{to reduce the risk}} of an infection.|$|R
5000|$|Non-Chinese Doctors: International Clinics {{will tend}} to have several foreign <b>doctors</b> who <b>will</b> either serve as {{management}} or as specialists in specialties which may be under represented or developed in Chinese medical education. These <b>doctors</b> <b>will</b> generally come from many {{countries around the world}} and speak a variety of languages, though it is rare that they speak Chinese. To practice in China, they need a medical license in their own country as well as China.|$|R
25|$|A {{woman with}} a prolactinoma should discuss her plans to {{conceive}} with her physician, so she can be carefully evaluated prior to becoming pregnant. This evaluation will include a magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) scan to assess {{the size of the}} tumor and an eye examination with measurement of visual fields. As soon as a patient is pregnant, her <b>doctor</b> <b>will</b> usually advise that she stop taking bromocriptine or cabergoline, the common treatments for prolactinoma. Most endocrinologists see patients every two months throughout the pregnancy. The patient should consult her endocrinologist promptly if she develops symptoms — in particular, headaches, visual changes, nausea, vomiting, excessive thirst or urination, or extreme lethargy. Bromocriptine or cabergoline treatment may be renewed and additional treatment may be required if the patient develops symptoms from growth of the tumor during pregnancy.|$|E
25|$|The Half-Faced Man deploys {{his escape}} pod — in reality, a hot-air balloon made of human skin—lifting the {{restaurant}} {{into the sky}} with him and the Doctor inside. The Doctor discovers that the Half-Faced Man {{and parts of the}} restaurant are from the SS Marie Antoinette, the sister ship to the SS Madame de Pompadour ("The Girl in the Fireplace"). The Doctor claims that the Half-Faced Man has replaced his components so many times that he no longer exists in his original form and that he secretly wants to end his existence. He then warns him that he will either have to kill himself, or the <b>Doctor</b> <b>will</b> be forced to kill him to protect the humans. Clara and the Paternoster Gang are nearly overwhelmed by the other robots when they see them go lifeless. The Half-Faced Man is then shown to be impaled on the spire of Big Ben.|$|E
25|$|The Master {{agrees to}} help the Doctor {{stop the spread of}} Entropy by {{adapting}} the Pharos Project radio telescope on Earth so that they are able to reopen the CVEs. However, when the Master tries to take control of it, the Doctor runs out under the upturned radio dish to sever the cable linking the Master to the CVEs. The Master makes the dish start rotating so that the <b>Doctor</b> <b>will</b> fall to his death. Before he falls, he manages to tear out the cable, only to leave his companions watching as he clings to the cable. As his grip begins to slip, he sees visions of all the enemies he's faced over the years, then falls. Adric, Nyssa, and Tegan gather around the mortally wounded Doctor and call out his name. The Doctor begins seeing visions of all his companions and even the Brigadier calling his name.|$|E
