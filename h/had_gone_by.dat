5|$|While most Americans saw Los Alamos as {{a remote}} and {{isolated}} place, it looked quite different to those {{accustomed to the}} shortages and danger of wartime Britain. Peggy, who worked at Los Alamos as a laboratory technician, pleasantly surprised and impressed Brigadier General Leslie Groves by congratulating him on the food and accommodation. Titterton played the grand piano at dances and recitals at the Fuller Lodge, often accompanied by Richard Feynman on the drums. With {{the passage of the}} Atomic Energy Act of 1946, known as the McMahon Act, all British government employees had to leave. All <b>had</b> <b>gone</b> <b>by</b> the end of 1946, except for Titterton, who was granted a special dispensation, and remained until 12 April 1947. The British Mission to the Manhattan Project ended when he departed.|$|E
5|$|For {{many years}} in New South Wales, the wallum banksia <b>had</b> <b>gone</b> <b>by</b> the {{scientific}} name of Banksia serratifolia. Richard Anthony Salisbury had published this binomial name in 1796, which was followed by Otto Kuntze, and then Karel Domin in 1921. Botanist and banksia authority Alex George conclusively established aemula as the correct name {{to be used in}} his 1981 revision of the genus. He pointed out that Salisbury's original described the leaves only, was insufficient to diagnose the species and is hence a nomen dubium—the description could have fit juvenile leaves of B.paludosa as well. In fact, Brown himself had been unsure whether serratifolia applied to what he called Banksia aemula. Salisbury's taxon appeared as Banksia serraefolia in Knight's 1809 work On the cultivation of the plants belonging to the natural order of Proteeae, but that entry might also refer to serrata. Where Salisbury got his material is unclear, but John White had sent material to James Edward Smith now held in the Linnean Society marked as B.serratifolia Salisb. as well as B.aemula R.Br.|$|E

5|$|Instead of {{alerting}} the police, {{the family}} took the silencer to Boutflour's sister's home. Boutflour said it felt sticky. They found red paint and blood on it, {{and the surface}} of it had been damaged. When the police collected the silencer from them on 12 August, {{five days after the}} murders, an officer reportedly noticed an inch-long grey hair attached to it, but this <b>had</b> <b>gone</b> <b>by</b> the time the silencer arrived at the Forensic Science Service at Huntingdon. A scientist at the Forensic Science Laboratory, Mr. Hayward, found blood on the inside and outside surface of the silencer, the latter not enough to permit analysis. The blood inside was found to be the same blood group as Sheila's, although {{it could have been a}} mixture of Nevill's and June's. A firearms expert, a Mr. Fletcher, said the blood was backspatter, caused by a close-contact shooting.|$|E
5|$|John Struthers {{was the son}} of Dr Alexander Struthers (1767–1853) and {{his wife}} Mary Reid (1793–1859). They lived in Brucefield, a large stone-built 18th century house with spacious grounds, which was then just outside Dunfermline; John was born in the house. Alexander was a wealthy mill owner and linen merchant. He bought Brucefield early in the 19th century, along with Brucefield Mill, a linen {{spinning}} mill built in 1792. Linen was threshed at the nearby threshing mill, and bleached in the open air near the house. There were still linen bleachers living in Brucefield House in 1841, but they <b>had</b> <b>gone</b> <b>by</b> 1851, leaving the house as the seat of the Struthers family. Mary's father, Deacon John Reid, was also a linen maker. Alexander and Mary were married in 1818; the marriage, though not warmly affectionate, lasted until Alexander's death despite the large age difference. Both Alexander and Mary are buried at Dunfermline Abbey.|$|E
5|$|The SR V class, more {{commonly}} known as the Schools class, is a class of steam locomotive designed by Richard Maunsell for the Southern Railway. The class was a cut down version of his Lord Nelson class but also incorporated components from Urie and Maunsell's LSWR/SR King Arthur class. It was the last locomotive in Britain to be designed with a 4-4-0 wheel arrangement, and was the most powerful class of 4-4-0 ever produced in Europe. All 40 of the class were named after English public schools, and were designed to provide a powerful class of intermediate express passenger locomotive on semi-fast services for lines which could cope with high axle loads but some of which had short turntables. Because of the use of a ‘’King Arthur’’ firebox, rather than the square-topped Belpaire firebox used on the Lord Nelsons, the class could be used on lines with a restricted loading gauge and some of the best performance by the class was on the heavily restricted Tonbridge to Hastings line. The locomotives performed well from the beginning but were subject to various minor modifications to improve their performance over the years. The class operated until 1961 when mass withdrawals took place and all <b>had</b> <b>gone</b> <b>by</b> December 1962. Three examples are now preserved on heritage railways in Britain.|$|E

25|$|Oare mill {{was built}} in the late eighteenth or early nineteenth century. It was marked on the 1819-42 Ordnance Survey map and Greenwood's map of 1821. The mill was working until June 1919.

25|$|British {{fighter pilots}} from IV Brigade {{were sent to}} the scene but the Germans <b>had</b> <b>gone</b> <b>by</b> the time they arrived. RFC {{observers}} watched the British attack but the strong westerly wind made their aircraft appear to be stationary in the air, when the pilots turned into the wind to allow the observers to study the ground. German infantry fired on the aircraft, two crew were wounded and several aircraft had to be flown back to make emergency landings. Rawlinson complained at the quality of the reconnaissance reports, which with the lack of observation during the rain delays before the attack, led to the British bombardments and barrages being inaccurate, which contributed to the failure of the Fourth Army except east of Gueudecourt and at Le Sars. The German counter-barrage had been prompt and accurate, helped by the success of the reconnaissance flights before the attack.|$|E
25|$|Studebaker's strong post-war {{management}} team including president Paul G Hoffman and Roy Cole (vice-president, engineering) <b>had</b> <b>gone</b> <b>by</b> 1949 {{and was replaced}} by more cautious executives who failed to meet the competitive challenge brought on by Henry Ford II and his Whiz Kids. Massive discounting in a price war between Ford and General Motors, which began with Ford's massive increase in production in the spring of 1953—part of Ford's postwar expansion program aimed at restoring it to the position of the largest car maker which GM had held since 1931—could not be equalled by the independent carmakers, for whom the only hope was seen as a merger of Studebaker, Packard, Hudson, and Nash into a third giant combine. This had been unsuccessfully attempted by George W. Mason. In this scheme, Studebaker had the disadvantage that its South Bend location would make centralization difficult. Its labor costs were also the highest in the industry.|$|E
25|$|By 1886, Bogan was in Wyoming {{working for}} the Vorhees Ranch, near Lusk, Wyoming. He {{is known to have}} killed three men by this time, one was the alleged murder of a dance hall {{proprietor}} who prohibited Bogan and his men from ever entering his saloon. Bogan, who have laready taken the alias of Bill Gatlin at that time, still forced his way into the establishment, and when he met the proprietor with a rifle in his hands, Bogan drew his revolver and shot him in cold blood. Bill Calkin, the editor of the local newspaper, wrote that Bogan was possible a cowboy wanted in Texas, and who <b>had</b> <b>gone</b> <b>by</b> at least two other names in the past. Bogan was infuriated, and Bogan set out looking for him, accompanied by cowboy Sterling Balou. The two entered the Cleveland Brothers Saloon, at which point Bogan drew his pistol calling for Calkin, and daring any of his friends to challenge him. One of the Cleveland brothers was able to bring a sawed off shotgun to bear on the two cowboys, and seconds later Constable Charles S. Gunn entered with his own pistol drawn, backing Cleveland. Bogan and Balou retreated and fled.|$|E

25|$|Wilde and Murdoch {{oversaw the}} launch of the first of the {{collapsible}} Engelhardt lifeboats, with 44 people, which was retrieved from its stored position, the sides erected and the boat attached to the davits. The majority of the forward boats <b>had</b> <b>gone</b> <b>by</b> this time and most of the crowd on deck had moved aft as Titanics bow dipped deeper into the water. The boat was rushed by a group of stewards and Third Class passengers who tried to climb aboard but were driven back by Purser McElroy, who fired two warning shots into the air, while Murdoch tried to hold the crowd back. Two First Class passengers, Hugh Woolner and Swedish industrialist Mauritz Håkan Björnström-Steffansson, came to the officers' assistance and dragged out two stewards who had made it into the lifeboat. With the assistance of Woolner and Steffanson, Murdoch and Wilde managed to load the lifeboat quickly but calmly. White Star Line chairman J. Bruce Ismay also assisted by rounding up women and children to bring them to Collapsible C. Captain Smith, who was observing events from the starboard bridge wing, ordered Quartermaster George Rowe to take command of the boat. After Wilde called repeatedly for women and children to enter, a number of men took up the remaining spaces in the lifeboat, including Ismay; his decision to save himself was later to be very controversial.|$|E

500|$|According to Victorian scholar Linda Hughes, the {{emotional}} {{gulf between the}} state of his domestic affairs {{and the loss of}} his special friendship informs the reading of [...] "Ulysses"—particularly its treatment of domesticity. At one moment, Ulysses' discontent seems to mirror that of Tennyson, who would have been frustrated with managing the house in such a state of grief. At the next, Ulysses is determined to transcend his age and his environment by travelling again. It may be that Ulysses' determination to defy circumstance attracted Tennyson to the myth; he said that the poem [...] "gave my feeling about the need of going forward and braving the struggle of life". On another occasion, the poet stated, [...] "There is more about myself in Ulysses, which was written under the sense of loss and that all <b>had</b> <b>gone</b> <b>by,</b> but that still life must be fought out to the end. It was more written with the feeling of his loss upon me than many poems in In Memoriam." [...] Hallam's death influenced much of Tennyson's poetry, including perhaps his most highly regarded work, In Memoriam A.H.H., begun in 1833 and completed seventeen years later.|$|E

Featuring the band's first set since 2004, alongside Luke Bryan, Sheryl Crow and Brad Paisley, the concert raised $2.1 million. [...] "I guess we realized that maybe we missed the playing... and five or six years <b>had</b> <b>gone</b> <b>by</b> and we were like, 'Maybe that wasn't as bad as we remember it being,'" [...] said Gentry. In celebration of the group's 40th anniversary, Alabama resumed touring in 2013 for the Back to the Bowery tour, referencing the Myrtle Beach club where they first became professional musicians.
