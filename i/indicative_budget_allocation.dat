40|$|Introduction: Stock {{shortage}} {{is one of}} {{the development}} impasses in developing countries and trough it the agriculture sector has faced with the most limitation. The share of Iran’s agricultural sector from total investments after the Islamic revolution (1979) has been just 5. 5 percent. This fact causes low efficiency in Iran’s agriculture sector. For instance per each 1 cubic meter of water in Iran’s agriculture sector, less that 1 kilogram dry food produced and each Iranian farmer achieves less annual income and has less mechanization in comparison with similar countries in Iran’s 1404 perspective document. Therefore, it is clear that increasing investment in agriculture sector, optimize the <b>budget</b> <b>allocation</b> for this sector is mandatory however has not been adequately and scientifically revised until now. Thus, in this research optimum <b>budget</b> <b>allocation</b> of Iran- Khorasan Razavi province agriculture sector was modeled. Materials and Methods: In order to model the optimum <b>budget</b> <b>allocation</b> of Khorasan Razavi province’s agriculture sector at first optimum <b>budget</b> <b>allocation</b> between agriculture programs was modeled with compounding three indexes: 1. Analyzing the priorities of Khorasan Razavi province’s agriculture sector experts with the application of Analytical Hierarchy Process (AHP), 2. The average share of agriculture sector programs from 4 th country’s development program for Khorasan Razavi province’s agriculture sector, and 3. The average share of agriculture sector programs from 5 th country’s development program for Khorasan Razavi province’s agriculture sector. Then, using Delphi technique potential indexes of each program was determined. After that, determined potential indexes were weighted using Analytical Hierarchy Process (AHP) and finally, using numerical taxonomy model to optimize allocation of the program’s budget between cities based on two scenarios. Required data, also was gathered from the budget and planning office of Khorasan Razavi’s Jahad Keshavarzi organization during 2006 - 2015. They were collected through distributed binary comparison questionnaires related to AHP model between Khorasan Razavi’s agricultural experts in 2015 and distributed questionnaires related to Delphi technique between Khorasan Razavi’s agricultural experts in 2015. Indeed, Super decision and Taxonomy software were applied to analyze the gathered data. Results and Discussion: Results of <b>budget</b> <b>allocation</b> of Khorasan Razavi province’s agriculture sector using three mentioned indexes showed that between 8 programs, P 1 and P 6 have the most and least share, respectively. The results of the Delphi technique for determining potential indexes of between cities <b>budget</b> <b>allocation</b> of agriculture sector programs indicated that totally there are 62 indexes. Findings of between cities <b>budget</b> <b>allocation</b> of agriculture sector programs showed that for <b>budget</b> <b>allocation</b> of P 1 based on 1 and 2 scenarios, Kalat and Davarzan cities have the most and least share, respectively and vice versa. For <b>budget</b> <b>allocation</b> of P 2 based on 1 and 2 scenarios, Bardaskan and Kalat cities have the most and least share, respectively and vice versa. For <b>budget</b> <b>allocation</b> of P 3 based on 1 and 2 scenarios, Mashhad and Joghatai cities have the most and least share, respectively and vice versa. For <b>budget</b> <b>allocation</b> of P 4 based on 1 and 2 scenarios, Jovein and Torghabe Shandiz cities have the most and least share, respectively and vice versa. For <b>budget</b> <b>allocation</b> of P 5 based on 1 and 2 scenarios, Chenaran and Neishabour cities have the most and least share, respectively and vice versa. For <b>budget</b> <b>allocation</b> of P 6 based on 1 and 2 scenarios, Mashhad and Khoushab cities have the most and least share, respectively and vice versa. For <b>budget</b> <b>allocation</b> of P 7 based on 1 and 2 scenarios, Neishabour and Saleh Abad cities have the most and least share, respectively and vice versa. Finally, for <b>budget</b> <b>allocation</b> of P 8 based on 1 and 2 scenarios, Neishabour and Khoushab cities have the most and least share, respectively and vice versa. Conclusion: The study concludes that the agriculture sector budget of Khorasan Razavi Province’s has not been allocated optimally. Therefore, paying attention to this fact that agriculture sector <b>budget</b> <b>allocation</b> which carried out previously between various programs, have been provided different instructions for opposite ideas always caused to challenge between beneficiary groups.
