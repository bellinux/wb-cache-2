50|$|Dexoxadrol (<b>Dioxadrol)</b> is a dissociative {{anaesthetic}} drug {{which has}} been found to be an NMDA antagonist and produces similar effects to PCP in animals. Dexoxadrol, along with another related drug etoxadrol, were developed as analgesics for use in humans, but development was discontinued after patients reported side effects such as nightmares and hallucinations.|$|E

In addition, response-contingent i. v. dexoxadrol maintained {{higher rates of}} responding than either levoxadrol or fl-dioxadrol in monkeys experienced with ketamine seif-admin-istration. The order of potency in displacing bound 1 -[1 -(2 -thn 1) cydohex 1 Jpipendine from binding sites in rat brain ho-mogenates was dexoxadrol levoxadrol = -(±) -dioxadrol. Viewed {{in the context of}} previous studies with stereochemical probes of the PCP receptor, these results extend and confirm the supposition that dexoxadrol and levoxadrol are the stereo-chemical probes of choice in the study of effects mediate...|$|E
40|$|Since the mid- 1950 s the {{pharmaceutical}} industry has developed a number of chemicals, including phencyclidine, ketamine and related arylcyclohexylamines (PCE and TCP), dizocilpine (MK- 801), N-allylnormetazocine [NANM, (±) SKF- 10, 047], etoxadrol, <b>dioxadrol</b> and its enantiomers dexoxadrol and levoxadrol, which produce a constellation of unusual behavioral effects in animals and man. The compounds best studied in humans are phencyclidine and ketamine. They produce a remarkable dose-dependent dissociation of awareness. All of these substances are now known to be non-competitive antagonists of NMDA receptors of glutamic acid. They act in the NMDA receptor ion channel. One can conclude, {{on the basis of}} the effects observed with these agents, that glutamic acid and related excitatory amino acids are extremely important in the maintenance of human awareness...|$|E
40|$|The {{effects of}} {{representative}} drugs from three classes of psychotomimetic compounds (arylcyclohexylamines, benzomorphan opioids and dioxolanes) {{have been examined}} on synaptic transmission at an identified monosynaptic pathway in rat hippocampal slices. The compounds tested were phencyclidine (PCP) and ketamine, the racemate and isomers of SKF 10, 047 (N-allylnormetazocine), and the isomers of <b>dioxadrol</b> (dexoxadrol and levoxadrol). In the absence of added magnesium ions (Mg) in the perfusion medium low frequency stimulation of the Schaffer collateral-commissural pathway evoked a burst of population spikes in the CA 1 cell body region. The secondary components of this response could be abolished by the selective N-methyl-D-aspartate (NMDA) antagonist D- 2 -amino- 5 -phosphonovalerate (APV). PCP (1 microM) or ketamine (10 microM) selectively blocked the secondary components of the synaptic response. The effect of PCP was neither mimicked nor prevented by hexamethonium and atropine, phentolamine and propranolol, or clonidine and was therefore unlikely to involve cholinergic or adrenergic neurotransmitter systems. The sigma opiate, (+/-) -SKF 10, 047 (10 microM) also abolished selectively the secondary components of the synaptic response. There was no apparent difference between the potency of the stereoisomers of this compound. The action of (+/-) -SKF 10, 047 was not affected by either naloxone or haloperidol, indicating that this effect did not involve opioid receptors or the haloperidol-sensitive sigma site. Dexoxadrol (10 microM), but not levoxadrol (10 microM), also selectively blocked the secondary components of the synaptic response. It is concluded that these psychotomimetic agents can block an NMDA receptor-mediated component of synaptic transmission in the hippocampus and that this effect is mediated by a specific PCP/sigma site...|$|E
