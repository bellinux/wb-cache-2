40|$|Abstract Background Estimates of {{baseline}} {{incidence of}} childhood intussusception could help safety monitoring after {{the introduction of}} rotavirus vaccines. We studied the incidence of intussusception in Uzbekistan, a GAVI-fund <b>eligible</b> <b>state</b> in Central Asia. Methods We retrospectively reviewed intussusception cases in children Results Over a 5 -year study period, 67 confirmed cases were identified, of which 67 % were boys. The median age was 12 months, and no seasonal trend {{in the distribution of}} cases was observed. The diagnostic methods used included abdominal radiography (87 %) and ultrasonography (57 %). Intussusception reduction by air enema was successful in 33 (49 %) patients and 34 (50 %) cases underwent surgery. A total of 4 deaths occurred, including 3 deaths in infants aged 0 - 6 months. The median length of hospital stay was 7. 3 (range 0 - 37) days. The incidence of intussusception is estimated at 23 (95 % CI 13. 6 - 32. 4) cases per 100, 000 child-years, corresponding to approximately 237 cases annually. Conclusions This is the first study to estimate the incidence of childhood intussusception prior to the introduction of the rotavirus vaccination in Uzbekistan. A prospective surveillance system using a standardized case definition is needed in order to better examine the occurrence of intussusception in developing countries. </p...|$|E

40|$|This {{study is}} the first to explore empirically the {{relationship}} between appraisal practice and user studies as well as the utilization of users and use as an appraisal factor. Both of these topics have been questioned in the archival community for several decades. This study investigated the current utilization of user studies in U. S. state archives and records management programs. It used the findings, along with participants¡¯ attitudes toward such practices, to consider the potential relationship between appraisal practice and user studies. A paucity of information on this research topic and on the target population necessitated three preliminary studies, conducted from 2006 through 2008, which facilitated the development of the survey questionnaire and three interview protocols. These tools were tested in a 2009 pretest study. In 2010 the full research study employed an online survey and in-person and phone interviews. Forty-seven <b>eligible</b> <b>state</b> archivists and records managers from thirty-three states participated, and interviewees involved twenty-eight participants from twenty-one states. This full study analyzed data at four levels (individual, group, program, and state), and it used SPSS software and NVivo 8 software for data analysis. According to the results of this study, the user {{study is the}} least frequently utilized user/use information source for appraisal practice, even though many participants consider users and use as an appraisal factor and collect user/use information from several different sources. Participants from only seven programs utilized results of user studies in their appraisal practice, and then only irregularly and unsystematically. Nevertheless, this study indicates the relationship between appraisal practice and user studies is likely to continue developing for two broad reasons. First, most participants have positive attitudes toward the feasibility and value of utilizing user studies in appraisal practice; participants who have done so proved the feasibility and value. Second, developing information technology helps conduct user studies, and results of this study show that if a program conducts a user study, its results will probably be utilized in appraisal practice. Findings of this study informed recommendations for further research, recommendations for archival education and training, and implications and recommendations for practitioners...|$|E
40|$|Correspondence {{issued by}} the Government Accountability Office with an {{abstract}} that begins "Individuals who are limited in their capacity for self-care because of a physical, cognitive, or mental disability or condition that results in a functional impairment may depend on family caregivers for assistance with routine daily activities. According to a 2009 study by the National Alliance for Caregiving and AARP, an estimated 65. 7 million people, or 29 percent of the population, had served as unpaid family caregivers to an adult or child with special needs in the previous 12 months, providing {{an average of about}} 20 hours of care per week. Activities caregivers conduct can range from assistance with routine daily tasks like bathing and dressing, to carrying out more complex health-related interventions like administering medication and wound care. The responsibilities of caregiving may present physical, emotional, and financial challenges for caregivers. In December 2006, the Lifespan Respite Care Act of 2006 (LRCA) was enacted to improve the delivery and quality of respite care services available to families across age and disability groups by establishing coordinated lifespan respite systems. The LRCA authorized the Secretary of the Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) to award competitive grants or cooperative agreements to <b>eligible</b> <b>state</b> agencies 7 to: (1) expand and enhance respite care services to family caregivers; (2) improve the statewide dissemination and coordination of respite care; and (3) provide, supplement, or improve access and quality of respite care services to family caregivers. The LRCA also authorized the Secretary of HHS to award a grant or cooperative agreement to a public or private nonprofit entity to establish a National Resource Center on Lifespan Respite Care to: (1) maintain a national database on lifespan respite care; (2) provide training and technical assistance to state, community, and nonprofit respite care programs; and (3) provide information, referral, and educational programs to the public on lifespan respite care. For fiscal years 2007 through 2011, over $ 289 million was authorized to carry out activities under the Act. Since the enactment of the LRCA, $ 5 million has been allocated to date to implement the federal Lifespan Respite Care Program [...] $ 2. 5 million in each of fiscal years 2009 and 2010. The Administration on Aging (AOA), the agency within HHS responsible for administering the Lifespan Respite Care Program, has had two competitive grant announcements for state agencies, with funding starting in September 2009 and September 2010 respectively. Both announcements offered federal funding of up to $ 200, 000 per award for a 3 -year project period; grantees are required to provide at least a 25 percent match of total project costs. In addition, in May 2009, AOA announced the availability of funding for a public or nonprofit entity to enter into a cooperative agreement with AOA to provide caregiver and respite program development and technical assistance, including establishing the National Resource Center on Lifespan Respite Care. The LRCA required that GAO evaluate lifespan respite programs. This report describes the grants and cooperative agreements that have been awarded to implement the requirements of the LRCA. ...|$|E
