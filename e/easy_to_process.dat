25|$|LLDPE {{is defined}} by a density range of 0.915–0.925nbsp&g/cm3. LLDPE is a {{substantially}} linear polymer with significant numbers of short branches, commonly made by copolymerization of ethylene with short-chain alpha-olefins (for example, 1-butene, 1-hexene, and 1-octene). LLDPE has higher tensile strength than LDPE, and it exhibits higher impact and puncture resistance than LDPE. Lower thickness (gauge) films can be blown, compared with LDPE, with better environmental stress-cracking resistance, but is not as <b>easy</b> <b>to</b> <b>process.</b> LLDPE is used in packaging, particularly film for bags and sheets. Lower thickness may be used compared to LDPE. It is used for cable coverings, toys, lids, buckets, containers, and pipe. While other applications are available, LLDPE is used predominantly in film applications due to its toughness, flexibility, and relative transparency. Product examples range from agricultural films, Saran wrap, and bubble wrap, to multilayer and composite films. In 2013, the world LLDPE market reached a volume of US$40 billion.|$|E

It is a very soft alloy, which makes it <b>easy</b> <b>to</b> <b>process.</b> Since the soft lead alloy is prone to strongly deform when striking a bullet catcher, it rapidly loses its kinetic energy and will not easily bounce off.

40|$|We {{examine a}} case of word order {{variation}} where speakers choose between two near-synonymous constructions partly {{on the basis of}} the processing complexity of the construction and its context. When producing two-verb clusters in Dutch, a speaker can choose between two word orders. Previous corpus studies have shown that a wide range of factors are associated with this word order variation. We conducted a large-scale corpus study in order to discover what these factors have in common. The underlying generalization appears to be processing complexity: we show that a variety of factors that are related to verbal cluster word order, can also be related to the processing complexity of the cluster's context. This implies that one of the word orders might be <b>easier</b> <b>to</b> <b>process</b> [...] - when processing load is high, speakers will go for the easier option. Therefore, we also investigate which of the two word orders might be <b>easier</b> <b>to</b> <b>process.</b> By testing for associations with factors indicating a higher or lower processing complexity of the verb and its context, we find evidence for the hypothesis that the word order where the main verb comes last is <b>easier</b> <b>to</b> <b>process...</b>|$|R
40|$|Early {{acquisition}} strategies likely don’t yield adult knowledge directly, {{but instead}} provide {{a stepping stone}} to later knowledge (Frank et al. 2009, Phillips & Pearl 2015). One beneficial effect of preliminary knowledge could be that language input becomes <b>easier</b> for children <b>to</b> <b>process,</b> given their limited cognitive resources. We leverage the idea that more predictable language is <b>easier</b> <b>to</b> <b>process</b> (Levy 2008) and assess language predictability (and thus language processing ease) with the information-theoretic measure perplexity (Goodman 2001). As a case study, we investigate early syntactic categorization occurring around fourteen months (Waxman & Booth 2001), when children have minimal structural knowledge about their language. We evaluate the frequent frames (FFs) categorization strategy (Mintz 2003, Mintz 2006) on English and American Sign Language (ASL), finding that FFs derive preliminary “proto-categories ” in both languages that make the child’s language input <b>easier</b> <b>to</b> <b>process</b> (i. e., more predictable) than adult syntactic categories do. This suggests early acquisition strategies may yield knowledge that not only scaffolds children’s future language acquisition but also their current language comprehension. We selected perplexity {{as a measure of}} very early language processing because it quantifies how probable the word sequences are that children encounter in their input (Eq 1). Knowledge that makes these input data more probable also makes them more predictable and so <b>easier</b> <b>to</b> <b>process</b> at this stage of development [...] and this makes their perplexity score lower. The FFs strategy has had considerable success identifying adult syntactic categories for many spoke...|$|R
40|$|We report three eye-movement {{experiments}} that investigated whether alternative syntactic analyses compete during syntactic ambiguity resolution. Previous research (Traxler et al., 1998 and Van Gompel et al., 2001) {{has shown that}} globally ambiguous sentences are <b>easier</b> <b>to</b> <b>process</b> than disambiguated sentences, suggesting that competition does not explain processing difficulty. However, the disambiguation in these studies was delayed relative to the initial point of ambiguity, so they do not rule out models which claim that competition is very short-lasting. The current experiments show that globally ambiguous sentences are <b>easier</b> <b>to</b> <b>process</b> than disambiguated sentences even when the disambiguation is immediate. Furthermore, globally ambiguous sentences are no harder <b>to</b> <b>process</b> than syntactically unambiguous sentences. We argue that the results are inconsistent with currently implemented constraint-based competition models, and support variable-choice reanalysis models such as the unrestricted race model...|$|R

Recently, several self-paced reading studies have presented surprising evidence that object relatives in Chinese are <b>easier</b> <b>to</b> <b>process</b> than subject relatives. We carried out three self-paced reading experiments that attempted to replicate these results.

Using a random effects bayesian meta-analysis of fifteen studies (including our own), we show that the overall current evidence for the subject-relative advantage is quite strong (approximate posterior probability of a subject-relative advantage given the data: 78 - 80 %). We argue that retrieval/integration based accounts would have difficulty explaining all three experimental results.
