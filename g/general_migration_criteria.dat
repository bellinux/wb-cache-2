40|$|Aimed at {{resolving the}} issues of the {{imbalance}} of resources and workloads at data centers and the overhead together with the high cost of virtual machine (VM) migrations, this paper proposes a new VM migration strategy which is based on the cloud model time series workload prediction algorithm. By setting the upper and lower workload bounds for host machines, forecasting the tendency of their subsequent workloads by creating a workload time series using the cloud model, and stipulating a <b>general</b> VM <b>migration</b> <b>criterion</b> workload-aware <b>migration</b> (WAM), the proposed strategy selects a source host machine, a destination host machine, and a VM on the source host machine carrying out the task of the VM migration. Experimental results and analyses show, through comparison with other peer research works, that the proposed method can effectively avoid VM migrations caused by momentary peak workload values, significantly lower the number of VM migrations, and dynamically reach and maintain a resource and workload balance for virtual machines promoting an improved utilization of resources in the entire data center...|$|R

40|$|A major {{assumption}} underlying <b>general</b> <b>migration</b> {{theory is}} that migrating further or longer entails costs in terms of energy used during flight and mortality risk, so that individuals should try to stay as close as they can to the breeding grounds during winter (see eg Alerstam & Hedenström 1998 and Cristol et al 1999 for reviews of <b>general</b> <b>migration</b> theory, costs of migration, etc). This pattern is generally counterbalanced by a higher daily energy expenditure at a higher latitude in winter (ie closer to the breeding grounds), so that the selection of given winter quarters is generally {{the result of a}} trade-off decision made by individual birds.

Since countries adopt various <b>migration</b> <b>criteria,</b> among which education is an important one for the social planner, this paper proposes a 3 -period overlapping generations model in which individuals train when they are young and work when they are adults. Finally, when old, they optimally choose their retirement date. Such a model allows conclusions on both growth and welfare prior to migration (in autarky) and post-migration (when borders are open on their two sides).|$|R
