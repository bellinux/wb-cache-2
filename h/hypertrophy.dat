40|$|AbstractOBJECTIVESWe {{sought to}} {{determine}} whether improving coupling between glucose oxidation and glycolysis by stimulating glucose oxidation during reperfusion enhances postischemic recovery of <b>hypertrophied</b> hearts. BACKGROUNDLow rates of glucose oxidation and high glycolytic rates are associated with greater postischemic dysfunction of <b>hypertrophied</b> as compared with nonhypertrophied hearts. METHODSHeart function, glycolysis and glucose oxidation were measured in isolated working control and <b>hypertrophied</b> rat hearts for 30 min before 20 min of global, no-flow ischemia and during 60 min of reperfusion. Selected control and <b>hypertrophied</b> hearts received 1. 0 mmol/liter dichloroacetate (DCA), an activator of pyruvate dehydrogenase, {{at the time of}} reperfusion to stimulate glucose oxidation. RESULTSIn the absence of DCA, glycolysis was higher and glucose oxidation and recovery of function were lower in <b>hypertrophied</b> hearts than in control hearts during reperfusion. Dichloroacetate stimulated glucose oxidation during reperfusion approximately twofold in both groups, while significantly reducing glycolysis in <b>hypertrophied</b> hearts. It also improved function of both <b>hypertrophied</b> and control hearts. In the presence of DCA, recovery of function of <b>hypertrophied</b> hearts was comparable to or better than that of untreated control hearts. CONCLUSIONSDichloroacetate, given at the time of reperfusion, normalizes postischemic function of <b>hypertrophied</b> rat hearts and improves coupling between glucose oxidation and glycolysis by increasing glucose oxidation and decreasing glycolysis. These findings support the hypothesis that low glucose oxidation rates and high glycolytic rates contribute to the exaggerated postischemic dysfunction of <b>hypertrophied</b> hearts...|$|R

We simultaneously measured cell motion and intracellular free calcium concentration ([Ca 2 +]i) with indo- 1 in isolated paced myocytes from aortic-banded rats and sham-operated rats. There {{was no difference in}} either the end-diastolic or peak-systolic [Ca 2 +]i between control and <b>hypertrophied</b> myocytes (97 +/- 18 vs. 105 +/- 15 nM, 467 +/- 92 vs. 556 +/- 67 nM, respectively). Myocytes were first superfused with oxygenated Hepes-buffered solution containing 1. 2 mM CaCl 2, 5. 6 mM glucose, and 5 mM acetate, and paced at 3 Hz at 36 degrees C. Exposure to 20 mM 2 -deoxyglucose as substitution of glucose for 15 min caused an upward shift of end-diastolic cell position in both control (n = 5) and <b>hypertrophied</b> myocytes (n = 10) (P < 0. 001 vs. baseline), indicating an impaired extent of relaxation. <b>Hypertrophied</b> myocytes, however, showed a greater upward shift in end-diastolic cell position and slowing of relaxation compared with control myocytes (delta 144 +/- 28 vs. 55 +/- 15 % of baseline diastolic position, P < 0. 02). Exposure to 2 -deoxyglucose increased end-diastolic [Ca 2 +]i in both groups (P < 0. 001 vs. baseline), but {{there was no difference between}} <b>hypertrophied</b> and control myocytes (218 +/- 38 vs. 183 +/- 29 nM, respectively). The effects of 2 -deoxyglucose were corroborated in isolated oxygenated perfused hearts in which glycolytic inhibition which caused severe elevation of isovolumic diastolic pressure and prolongation of relaxation in the <b>hypertrophied</b> hearts compared with controls.

The severe impairment of diastolic relaxation induced by 2 -deoxyglucose in <b>hypertrophied</b> myocytes compared with control myocytes cannot be explained by greater diastolic Ca 2 + overload, which implicates an increase in myofilament Ca(2 +) -responsiveness as a possible mechanism...|$|R
40|$|The {{durations}} of transmembrane action potentials recorded from single myocytes {{isolated from}} the endocardial surface of <b>hypertrophied</b> left ventricles of rats were increased, compared to the durations recorded from normal left ventricular cells at 36 - 37 °C. Exposure to phalloidin (1 - 20 μM, < 20 min), a specific stabilizer of the non-myofibrillar actin microfilament component of the cardiac cytoskeleton, {{had no effect on}} action potential duration of normal cells, but significantly shortened the prolonged action potentials of <b>hypertrophied</b> cells. Cytochalasin D (5 - 50 μM), a disrupter of the actin microfilaments, also had little effect on action potential duration of normal cells. However, cytochalasin D further increased the action potential duration of <b>hypertrophied</b> cells at 10 min exposure. The addition of phalloidin to solutions containing cytochalasin D, reduced the latter's increase of action potential duration in <b>hypertrophied</b> cells. Whole-cell transient outward K+ current (Ito 1) density was significantly decreased in <b>hypertrophied</b> cells. At a test potential of + 60 mV, the mean Ito 1 density recorded from normal cells was 13. 5 ± 1. 1 pA pF− 1 (n = 18) compared to 4. 17 ± 1. 2 pA pF− 1 for LVH cells (n = 22; P < 0. 05). Phalloidin (20 μM) increased and cytochalasin D (50 μM) decreased whole-cell Ito 1 in <b>hypertrophied</b> cells but had no effect on Ito 1, in normal cells.

Intracellular pH (pH(i)) was measured in individual myocytes with SNARF- 1, and [Ca 2 +]i was measured with indo- 1, simultaneous with cell motion. Experiments were performed at 36 degrees C in myocytes paced at 0. 5 Hz in Hepes-buffered solution (pH(o) 7. 40) containing 1. 2 mM CaCl 2. At baseline, calibrated pH(i), diastolic and systolic [Ca 2 +]i values, and the amplitude of cell contraction were similar in <b>hypertrophied</b> and control myocytes. Exposure of the control myocytes to 10 nM ET- 1 caused {{an increase in the}} amplitude of cell contraction to 163 +/- 22 % of baseline (P < 0. 05), associated with intracellular alkalinization (pH(i) + 0. 08 +/- 0. 02 U, P < 0. 05) and a slight increase in peak systolic [Ca 2 +]i (104 +/- 11 % of baseline, P < 0. 05). In contrast, in the <b>hypertrophied</b> myocytes, exposure to ET- 1 did not increase the amplitude of cell contraction or cause intracellular alkalinization (- 0. 01 +/- 0. 02 U, NS). Similar effects were observed in the <b>hypertrophied</b> and control myocytes in response to exposure to 10 nM angiotensin II. ET- 1 also increased the rate of recovery from intracellular acidosis induced by the washout of NH 4 Cl in the control cells, but did not do so in the <b>hypertrophied</b> cells. In the presence of 10 microM 5 -(N-ethyl-N-isopropyl) -amiloride, which inhibits Na+-H+ exchange, ET- 1 did not cause a positive inotropic effect or intracellular alkalinization in control cells.
