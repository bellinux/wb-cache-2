25|$|Permanence in links is {{desirable}} when content items {{are likely to}} be linked to, from, or cited by a source outside the originating organization. Before the advent of large-scale dynamic websites built on database-backed content management systems, it was more common for URLs of specific pieces of content to be static and <b>human</b> <b>readable,</b> as URL structure and naming were dictated by the entity creating that content. Increased volume of content and difficulty of management led to the rise of database-driven systems, and the resulting unwieldy and often-changing URLs necessitated deliberate policies with regard to URL design and link permanence.|$|E
25|$|But more {{important}} to the operation of the ODBC system is the DM's concept of a Data Source Name (DSN). DSNs collect additional information needed to connect to a specific data source, versus the DBMS itself. For instance, the same MySQL driver can be used to connect to any MySQL server, but the connection information to connect to a local private server is different from the information needed to connect to an internet-hosted public server. The DSN stores this information in a standardized format, and the DM provides this to the driver during connection requests. The DM also includes functionality to present a list of DSNs using <b>human</b> <b>readable</b> names, and to select them at run-time to connect to different resources.|$|E

This research proposes an indoor navigation system which relies on symbolic information described by OWL. The description is used for path finding and for generating navigation instruction. The proposed indoor navigation system is developed using semantic web technology and the mobile application for navigation is developed on Android platform. With OWL-based symbolic information, spatial object information is described semantically in which both computer and <b>human</b> are <b>readable</b> and therefore, the spatial object information is easier to create and to maintain. Using direction-based navigation, interaction between human and system is flexible and the users are able to realise the orientation of current location easily...|$|R

We propose {{oblivious}} printing, a novel {{approach to}} document printing in which a set of printers can cooperate to print a secret message—in <b>human</b> or machine <b>readable</b> form—without learning the message. We present multi-party protocols for obliviously printing a secret in three settings: obliviously printing {{the contents of a}} ciphertext, obliviously printing a randomized message, and generating and obliviously printing a DSA/Elgamal keypair. We propose an approach to improving the legibility of messages in the presence of numerous participants. Finally we propose some potential applications of oblivious printing in the context of electronic voting and digital cash. ...|$|R

40|$|The {{mountain}} ranges of the Tadrart Acacus and Messak in southwestern Libya (central Sahara) are widely {{known for their}} outstanding rock art inventory and some key prehistoric sites. This paper illustrates the preliminary outcomes of current investigations on the ‘Tifinagh’ inscriptions of the Tadrart Acacus the recording of which has recently increased thanks to the support of ‘Endangered Archives Programme’ of the British Library. Its aim is twofold: first, to outline the main steps of the project, placing these within the most relevant {{issues related to the}} phenomenon of writing in the Sahara, and second, to describe the results that have been achieved to date and to foresee possible avenues of development. In fact, although difficulties in both dating and decipherment have been repeatedly stressed through the years, we emphasise that Tifinagh texts can {{play an important role in}} the process of landscape interpretation. A proper ‘written landscape’, where <b>humans</b> left <b>readable</b> signs of their passages or their stays, can integrate other archaeological approaches pursued so far in the Tadrart Acacus and its surroundings...|$|R

TN-TIES consists of chunking, classification, and interpretation processing stages. The results at each stage are promising.

40|$|Interoperability is an {{important}} issue in distributed object-based systems, because it allows the communication of programs (clients and servers) written in different object-oriented programming languages. Some of the fundamental issues to reach interoperability are related to the data type mapping, object representation, messages, serialization and de-serialization. Serializing objects to XML brings many advantages over binary encoding because XML is <b>human</b> and computer <b>readable,</b> and it also aims to have better interoperability between different programming languages. This paper presents Web Objects in XML (WOX), an efficient and easy to use XML serializer for C# and Java. It allows to serialize Java objects to XML, de-serialize them to C#, and vice versa. The XML encoding used in our WOX serializer can represent objects in other object-oriented programming languages...|$|R
