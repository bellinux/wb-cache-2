500|$|Monk was {{originally}} envisioned as a [...] "more goofy and physical" [...] Inspector Clouseau type of character. However, co-creator David Hoberman {{came up with}} the idea of a detective with obsessive-compulsive disorder. This was inspired by his own bout with self-diagnosed obsessive-compulsive disorder; in a Pittsburgh Post-Gazette interview, he stated that, [...] "Like Monk, I couldn't walk on cracks and had to touch poles. <b>I</b> <b>have</b> <b>no</b> <b>idea</b> why [...] but if I didn't do these things, something terrible would happen." ...|$|E

500|$|There were {{accusations that}} certain {{foodstuffs}} – usually reported as pizza, but occasionally reported as coffee, tomato soup or pea soup – {{had been thrown}} at Ferguson by an unknown Arsenal player. Ferguson changed into the club tracksuit in order {{to carry out his}} television duties. Speculation that the player who threw the pizza was Cesc Fàbregas arose when Cole hinted that the culprit was neither English nor French. In his autobiography, Ferguson said: [...] "They say it was Cesc Fàbregas who threw the pizza at me but, to this day, <b>I</b> <b>have</b> <b>no</b> <b>idea</b> who the culprit is." [...] Fàbregas confirmed he did throw the pizza on an episode of A League of Their Own, broadcast in October 2017.|$|E

Novak, who also acts in the show as Ryan Howard, and the first episode of the series {{directed}} by Jason Reitman, who directed the films Juno and Thank You for Smoking. When speaking about his directorial experience with The Office, Reitman stated that [...] "Anyhow, the whole experience was awesome. They’re all geniuses over there. I didn’t have to contribute much {{at the end of}} the day because they’re all so on their game." [...] He also stated that [...] "Weird moment of production design surprise – There's a three ring binder on Creed's desk with the logo from the Academy of Tobacco Studies that we created for [...] Smoking. <b>I</b> <b>have</b> <b>no</b> <b>idea</b> how it got there and neither does he." [...] B.J. Novak's brother Jesse, a musician, contributed in writing the song that some of the characters sing in the episode.|$|E
500|$|Reardon and Yeates' friends set up {{a website}} and used social {{networking}} services to help look for her. On 21 December 2010, Yeates' parents and Reardon made a public appeal for her safe return at a police press conference. In another press conference, broadcast live on 23 December 2010 by Sky News and BBC News, Yeates' father David commented on her disappearance: [...] "I think she was abducted after getting home to her flat ... <b>I</b> <b>have</b> <b>no</b> <b>idea</b> of {{the circumstances of the}} abduction because of what was left behind ... I feel sure she would not have gone out by herself leaving all these things behind and she was taken away somewhere". Her keys, phone, purse and coat were left behind at her flat. Detectives retrieved a receipt for a pizza, but found no sign of it or of its packaging. Both bottles of cider were found in the flat, one of them partially consumed. As {{there was no evidence of}} forced entry or a struggle, investigators began to examine the possibility that Yeates may have known her abductor.|$|E
500|$|Vince Gilligan, {{the writer}} of the episode, wanted Bryan Cranston to play the {{antagonist}} because he felt he would humanize the role. “We needed a guy who could be scary and kind of loathsome {{but at the same}} time had a deep, resounding humanity," [...] he later said. [...] In an interview with The New York Times, Gilligan stated, [...] "We had this villain, and we needed the audience to feel bad for him when he died. Bryan alone was the only actor who could do that, who could pull off that trick. And it is a trick. <b>I</b> <b>have</b> <b>no</b> <b>idea</b> how he does it.” Rick Millikan, the casting director for The X-Files noted that Cranston was nearly not chosen for this episode. Initially, the part of Crump had been assigned to a different actor, but Cranston came prepared to audition for the part. Although the character had already been cast, Millikan allowed him to audition and was very pleased with his performance and chose him for the part instead.|$|E

500|$|While {{the music}} of Henry Cow was highly orchestrated and structured, Frith also began to {{experiment}} with unstructured music, using prepared instruments and chance composition. In June 1974, {{after the release of}} Henry Cow's second album, Virgin Records (Henry Cow's record label) commissioned a solo record from Frith. They were impressed with his musical ability and gave him free rein to record whatever he wanted. In a 2001 radio interview, Frith said he used the opportunity as a challenge: [...] "I said to myself ... in two weeks time I'm going to go into the studio and <b>I</b> <b>have</b> <b>no</b> <b>idea</b> what I'm going to do and I'm going to kind of reinvent the instrument for myself." [...] Frith spent four days in July 1974 recording at the Kaleidophon Studios in London, and the resulting experimentation and the process of galvanisation and pressure led to the [...] "radical approach to the guitar" [...] on the album. In October 1974, Virgin released the album as Guitar Solos on their budget label, Caroline Records.|$|E
500|$|Entertainment Weekly Ken Tucker {{called the}} episode [...] "at once cool-looking, heart-tugging, and pretty simple", {{especially}} {{when compared to}} previous episodes like [...] "White Tulip". Writing for The A.V. Club, Noel Murray graded the episode with an A, explaining [...] "I can't really find anything to complain about here. The direction was effectively moody and snappy, the performances were sharp, and the case was cool." [...] Murray praised the subtle characteristics of the parallel universe, the action scenes, {{and the use of}} split-screens to visually show Milo's predictions. MTV's Josh Wigler believed that the episode [...] "demonstrated how the mystery-of-the-week format can still be compelling: by taking everything familiar and applying a stark new layer of paint." [...] Andrew Hanson of the Los Angeles Times wrote [...] "The third season of Fringe continues to get better with each episode. Most importantly, it has momentum. It's moving forward with a distinct destination, and even though I know Fringe is heading somewhere, <b>I</b> <b>have</b> <b>no</b> <b>idea</b> where that might be, or what's going to happen when we get there. Boy, if you're not watching Fringe, you're missing out." ...|$|E
500|$|During {{a trip to}} California on Republican Party {{business}} {{in the summer of}} 1973, Bundy rekindled his relationship with Brooks, who marveled at his transformation into a serious, dedicated professional seemingly on the cusp of a distinguished legal and political career. He continued to date Kloepfer as well, though neither woman was aware of the other's existence. In the fall of 1973 Bundy matriculated at UPS Law School and continued courting Brooks, who flew to Seattle several times to stay with him. They discussed marriage; at one point he introduced her to Davis as his fiancée. In January 1974, however, he abruptly broke off all contact; her phone calls and letters went unreturned. Finally reaching him by phone a month later, Brooks demanded to know why Bundy had unilaterally ended their relationship without explanation. In a flat, calm voice, he replied, [...] "Stephanie, <b>I</b> <b>have</b> <b>no</b> <b>idea</b> what you mean" [...] and hung up. She never heard from him again. [...] He later explained, [...] "I just wanted to prove to myself that I could have married her"; but Brooks concluded in retrospect that he had deliberately planned the entire courtship and rejection in advance as vengeance for the breakup she initiated in 1968.|$|E

500|$|On an {{exclusive}} interview with Access Hollywood, Cyrus spoke in regards to the music video for the song, directed by Marc Webb. She said, [...] "I wanted something crazy that no one else has done and like really random because this song is kinda random." [...] Shot on November 16, 2007 in a suburban area of Los Angeles, California, the video included fifty background dancers, such as a middle school teacher. Cyrus said the concept was, [...] "I'm singing and dancing and like rocking out and <b>I</b> <b>have</b> <b>no</b> <b>idea</b> where these people come from." [...] The portion of the music video in which she enters the [...] "carnival-like" [...] scene drew influences from the 1950s and Hairspray. Another concept she further explained was the appearance of a man in a [...] "prom-setting." [...] Cyrus said, [...] "Here it's gonna be the guy that I'm supposed to 'start all over' and we're at prom, so I'm just [...] not like in a dress or anything. So, it's random. It's like everything is happening all at once." [...] The ending of the music video, she explained, was when she went back to [...] "where [...] belongs" [...] after a day of [...] "torture." ...|$|E
500|$|During the {{beginning}} of season three, Chris Carabott from IGN described Ben as [...] "one of the best 'villains on television', due to his 'eerie manner' and 'methodical delivery'". Later in the season Carabott {{had a problem with}} Ben being so deceptive, as [...] "anything he imparts must be taken with a grain of salt". Jeff Jensen of Entertainment Weekly also noted this, saying [...] "I don't trust Ben. <b>I</b> <b>have</b> <b>no</b> <b>idea</b> when he's lying and when he's telling the truth. The only thing I'm reasonably sure of is that everything he says is for the purpose of impacting a character — and the audience". Ben's father issues revealed towards the end of season three are described as [...] "not the most original Lost character trait by any means but it is the thrust behind Ben's development into the genocidal maniac he eventually becomes". Following the penultimate episode of the season, Carabott stated [...] "Even with his limited screen time, Michael Emerson's performance shines through and we hope that he survives the events of the finale because we love seeing his character every week." [...] Erin Martell from TV Squad picked the Others as one of her season three highlights, partly due to the development of Ben, adding [...] "I cannot even picture the final three seasons without Ben". Martell also gave six reasons to look forward to season four, one of which was Ben Linus.|$|E
500|$|One of {{the letters}} was from Bannon, asking for {{professional}} assistance in getting published. On writing to Meaker, she said, [...] "To this day <b>I</b> <b>have</b> <b>no</b> <b>idea</b> why she responded to {{me out of the}} thousands of letters she was getting at that time. Thank God she did. I was both thrilled and terrified." [...] Bannon visited Meaker and was introduced to Greenwich Village, which made a significant impression on Bannon: she called it [...] "Emerald City, Wonderland, and Brigadoon combined—a place where gay people could walk the crooked streets hand in hand." [...] Meaker set up a meeting with Gold Medal Books editor Dick Carroll, who read Bannon's initial 600-page manuscript. It was a story about the women in her sorority whom she admired, with a subplot consisting of two sorority sisters who {{had fallen in love with}} each other. Carroll told her to take it back and focus on the two characters who had an affair. Bannon claims she went back and told their story, delivered the draft to Carroll and saw it published without a single word changed. While raising two young children, Bannon lived in Philadelphia and took trips into New York City to visit Greenwich Village and stayed with friends. She said of the women she saw in Greenwich Village, [...] "I wanted to be one of them, to speak to other women, if only in print. And so I made a beginning—and that beginning was the story that became Odd Girl Out." ...|$|E

500|$|Carla Gugino {{revealed}} in August 2009 {{that she had}} begun taking singing lessons for her part in the film. One month later, Jamie Chung announced {{in an interview with}} E! Entertainment that recording for the soundtrack had begun. When Emily Browning auditioned for her role as Babydoll, Snyder asked her to sing because of the musical element in the film. He told her to record herself while singing, and the actress did a version of [...] "Killing Me Softly with His Song". Browning later said, [...] "I was terrified, of course. But he liked it. <b>I</b> <b>have</b> <b>no</b> <b>idea</b> why, but he thought me capable of carrying a tune on the screen." [...] The crew liked the result and offered her to sing more songs. At first it was just a cover of [...] "Where Is My Mind?" [...] by Pixies, which ended up becoming a duet with Yoav, but the producers extended to three songs. One, a version by [...] "Sweet Dreams (Are Made of This)" [...] by Eurythmics, is used to open the movie, and Bates noted that [...] " [...] first line of dialogue is actually 27 minutes into the film so it is an interesting way to introduce her character." [...] The other came up when during a discussion on her favorite music with Snyder, Browning said that The Smiths was her favorite band. Several weeks later, Snyder informed her that he had acquired the rights to The Smiths' song [...] "Asleep", and asked her if she would like to perform the lead vocals. At first, she hesitated, saying that [...] "The offer was flattering, but there was so much pressure". However, she recorded the song and according to Snyder, The Smiths' frontman Morrissey was happy with the result. Regarding Browning's performance, de Vries considered that [...] "having Emily sing—essentially commenting in song on her character’s situation in the film — provided an interesting texture, real resonance and depth, and tied the music to the visuals in a way that might otherwise not have been so clearly defined", and Snyder found the actress' [...] "emotional delivery" [...] to [...] "make the songs even more poignant". To work with Browning between takes, de Vries used a portable recording rig on a room with a piano - [...] "a very distressed, out-of-tune, almost-unusable instrument (...) which turned out to have real charm in it." ...|$|E
