500|$|Her reappearance and {{subsequent}} explanation (including {{the assumption that}} she had been held at Wells's house) were the following day printed in the London Daily Advertiser. [...] She was visited by the apothecary, but with <b>her</b> <b>pulse</b> faint, and so weak she could scarcely speak, she vomited up the medicine he gave her. [...] He administered several glysters until satisfied with the results, following which Canning was taken by her friends and neighbours to the Guildhall to see Alderman Thomas Chitty, to ask that he issue a warrant for Wells's arrest.|$|E
500|$|Weakened {{by his own}} wounds, Beauchamp {{was loaded}} on a cart {{to be taken to}} the gallows and hanged before he bled to death. He insisted on seeing his wife before being executed, but doctors told him she was not {{severely}} injured and would recover. Beauchamp protested that not being allowed to see his wife was cruel, and the guards consented to take him to her. Upon arriving, he was angered to see that the doctors had lied to him; Anna was too weak even to speak to him. He remained with her until he could no longer feel <b>her</b> <b>pulse.</b> He kissed her lifeless lips and declared [...] "For you I lived [...] for you I die." ...|$|E
2500|$|She did not breathe {{during the}} entire period of a vision that ranged from fifteen minutes to three hours. [...] Yet, <b>her</b> <b>pulse</b> beat {{regularly}} and her countenance remained pleasant as in the natural state.|$|E
60|$|Slone {{shook his}} head mournfully. He was getting one of those gloomy spells that Lucy hated. Nevertheless, she felt a stir of <b>her</b> <b>pulses.</b>|$|R
6000|$|... "Neale or Larry {{will visit}} Durade's," [...] she soliloquized, with <b>her</b> <b>pulses</b> beating fast. [...] "And {{if they do}} not come--some one else will... some man I can trust." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Be mine ... mine absolutely," [...] {{he urged}} eagerly with passion just {{sufficiently}} subdued to make <b>her</b> <b>pulses</b> throb. [...] "Be my wife ... my princess ... let {{me feel that}} no one could come between us...." ...|$|R
2500|$|Without {{official}} government support {{the most radical}} advocates of manifest destiny increasingly turned to military filibustering. Originally filibuster {{had come from the}} Dutch vrijbuiter and referred to buccaneers in the West Indies that preyed on Spanish commerce. While there had been some filibustering expeditions into Canada in the late 1830s, it was only by mid-century did filibuster become a definitive term. By then, declared the New-York Daily Times [...] "the fever of Fillibusterism is on our country. <b>Her</b> <b>pulse</b> beats like a hammer at the wrist, and there's a very high color on her face." [...] Millard Fillmore's second annual message to Congress, submitted in December 1851, gave double the amount of space to filibustering activities than the brewing sectional conflict. The eagerness of the filibusters, and the public to support them, had an international hue. Clay's son, diplomat to Portugal, reported that Lisbon had been stirred into a [...] "frenzy" [...] of excitement and were waiting on every dispatch.|$|E
2500|$|On , Catherine rose {{early in}} the morning and had her usual morning coffee, soon {{settling}} down to work on papers at her study. Her lady's maid, Maria Perekusikhina, had asked the Empress if she had slept well, and Catherine reportedly replied she had not slept so well in a long time. Sometime after 9:00 that morning, Catherine went to her dressing room and collapsed from a stroke while on the toilet. Worried by Catherine's absence, her attendant, Zakhar Zotov, opened the door and peered in. Catherine was sprawled on the floor. Her face appeared purplish, <b>her</b> <b>pulse</b> was weak, and her breathing was shallow and laboured. The servants lifted Catherine from the floor and brought her to the bedroom. Some 45 minutes later, the royal court's Scottish physician, Dr. John Rogerson, arrived and determined that Catherine had suffered a stroke. Despite all attempts to revive the Empress, she fell into a coma from which she never recovered. Catherine was given the last rites and died the following evening around 9:45. An autopsy performed on her body the next day confirmed the cause of death as stroke. (Later, several unfounded stories circulated regarding the cause and manner of her death.) ...|$|E
60|$|The mother sighed {{again with}} weariness. <b>Her</b> <b>pulse</b> was very irregular.|$|E
60|$|Then, {{with another}} little sigh, {{she was just}} turning to go when {{the sound of her}} name spoken in a whisper and quite close to <b>her</b> sent <b>her</b> <b>pulses</b> quivering and made her heart beat furiously.|$|R
60|$|She {{resolved}} to say her morning prayers with full attention so {{soon as the}} church was empty, and meantime to follow the service with all her powers, though <b>her</b> <b>pulses</b> were still throbbing and her head aching.|$|R
6000|$|Our {{earth is}} no doubt made of {{excellent}} stuff, [...] But <b>her</b> <b>pulses</b> beat slower and slower, [...] The weather in Forty was cutting and rough, [...] And then, as Heaven knows, the glass stood low enough, [...] And now it is four degrees lower.|$|R
60|$|Quest felt <b>her</b> <b>pulse</b> and her forehead. They {{moved back}} to the fire.|$|E
60|$|A {{man who had}} {{announced}} himself a doctor, bent over <b>her</b> <b>pulse</b> and turned away.|$|E
60|$|His fingers strayed to <b>her</b> <b>pulse.</b> He smiled {{upon her}} as one smiles upon a child.|$|E
60|$|She {{meant to}} keep him from killing Beasley if she sacrificed every last shred of her pride. And she stamped the look of his face on her heart of hearts to {{treasure}} always. The thrill, the beat of <b>her</b> <b>pulses,</b> almost obstructed <b>her</b> thought of purpose.|$|R
6000|$|In {{the moment}} of shaking hands, Cherry had foreboded enough to set <b>her</b> <b>pulses</b> {{throbbing}} so violently as to deafen her ears. Lance had failed, had run away in despair, to go to Fulbert rather than be a burthen; Felix would go in search of him--break a blood-vessel--and-- ...|$|R
6000|$|The {{thoughts}} formed themselves mechanically in her mind. Her eyes {{sought the}} ball which had come {{crashing into the}} room. There was life once more in <b>her</b> <b>pulses.</b> She found {{a scrap of paper}} and a pencil in her pocket. With trembling fingers she wrote a few words: ...|$|R
60|$|Liza lay still, {{breathing}} very quietly, {{her eyes}} closed. The doctor kept {{his fingers on}} <b>her</b> <b>pulse.</b>|$|E
60|$|Ida {{felt like}} death itself. <b>Her</b> <b>pulse</b> sunk and fluttered; her vital forces seemed to cease their work.|$|E
60|$|The doctor, {{who was a}} red-nosed gentleman with a great {{bunch of}} seals {{dangling}} below a waistcoat of ribbed black satin, arrived with all speed, and taking his seat by the bedside of poor Nell, drew out his watch, and felt <b>her</b> <b>pulse.</b> Then {{he looked at her}} tongue, then he felt <b>her</b> <b>pulse</b> again, and while he did so, he eyed the half-emptied wine-glass as if in profound abstraction.|$|E
60|$|She passed at a stride to the {{acceptance}} of Mr. Brumley's hitherto incredible suspicion. <b>Her</b> <b>pulses</b> quickened. It came into her head {{to see how far}} this man would go in following her. She went on demurely down the hill leaving him quite unaware that she had seen him.|$|R
60|$|She stood still, {{rooted to}} the spot with a great horror. <b>Her</b> <b>pulses</b> had ceased to beat. The warm summer day seemed {{suddenly}} to have closed in around her. There was a singing in her ears, and she found herself battling hard with a deadly faintness. Yet she found words.|$|R
60|$|Lenore {{strained}} {{her eyes}} and felt a stir of <b>her</b> <b>pulses.</b> Jake's voice was perturbing. Was it strange that Nash slowed up a little {{where there was no}} apparent need? Then Lenore saw a hand flash {{out of the side of}} the car ahead and throw a small, glinting object into the wheat.|$|R
60|$|He stopped beside her, {{feeling for}} <b>her</b> <b>pulse</b> and then {{listening}} for her heartbeats. She lived. He shook her.|$|E
60|$|Herr Grosse hesitated--looked at her--let {{go of the}} bandage-and lifting one of her hands, {{laid his}} fingers on <b>her</b> <b>pulse.</b>|$|E
60|$|She did {{not know}} why his soft, low tones mysteriously wrung her heartstrings. <b>Her</b> <b>pulse</b> began to beat more quickly.|$|E
60|$|Standing {{beneath the}} window, chatting merrily {{with a group}} of officers-- It was he! Could she mistake that figure, though the face was turned away? Her head swam, <b>her</b> <b>pulses</b> beat like church bells, her eyes were ready to burst from their sockets. But--she was {{assisting}} at an operation. It was God's will, and she must endure.|$|R
60|$|And as Yvonne too in instinctive {{response}} to that peremptory call was further straining her every sense in order to listen, there came from somewhere, not very far away, right through {{the stillness of the}} night, a sound which caused <b>her</b> <b>pulses</b> to still their beating and her throat to choke with the cry which rose from her breast.|$|R
60|$|When {{they were}} gone, the cares {{of the morning}} {{returned}} upon her, {{and by the time}} her household affairs were finished, all <b>her</b> <b>pulses</b> were throbbing at the prospect of the effort to which she was nerving herself. She ordered herself to be quiet, and lay down on the sofa, leaving the door open that Theodora might not go out without her knowledge.|$|R
60|$|Doctor Walker kneeled beside her, {{and passed}} {{his left hand}} over her head, while he grasped <b>her</b> <b>pulse</b> with the right.|$|E
60|$|Captain Dunning looked anxiously at Dr Hopley, who {{crouched}} beside them, {{and gazed}} earnestly in the child's face while he felt <b>her</b> <b>pulse.</b>|$|E
6000|$|Mr. Beaumont {{considered}} it. “How do {{you know}} she isn’t dying if you haven’t felt <b>her</b> <b>pulse?</b> I mean if you haven’t asked her?” ...|$|E
60|$|There was a {{tenderness}} in {{his voice}} that set <b>her</b> <b>pulses</b> stirring wildly. Did she guess aright the reason that had caused him to break his journey and return? That he had done so--no matter what the reason--she thanked God from her inmost heart, as for a miracle that had saved him from the doom awaiting him in London town.|$|R
60|$|His very senses ached {{with the}} longing to clasp {{her in his}} arms, to draw her to him, and to feel <b>her</b> <b>pulses</b> beat closer against his. It was almost torture now to gaze upon her beauty--that small, oval face, almost like a child's, the large eyes which at times had seemed to be blue but which now {{appeared}} to be a deep, unfathomable colour, like the tempestuous sea.|$|R
6000|$|What fear {{could face}} a heaven and earth like this? [...] What silveriest cloud could hang 'neath such a sky? A tide of wondrous and unwonted bliss [...] Rolls back through all <b>her</b> <b>pulses</b> suddenly, As if some seraph, who had learned to kiss [...] From the fair daughters of the world gone by, Had wedded so his fallen light with hers, Such sweet, strange joy through soul and body stirs.|$|R
