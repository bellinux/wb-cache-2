5|$|Executives at Tetragrammaton Records, Deep Purple's American label, {{thought that}} it would have been more {{profitable}} to have a new album to promote during the US tour, besides the already successful Shades of Deep Purple. Moreover, the eight tracks recorded in May for Deep Purple's debut album and performed live in the British gigs of July and August were deemed insufficient for their shows as headliners in the US. For these reasons, they were pushed back into the studio <b>just</b> <b>a</b> <b>couple</b> of months before the tour began, even though their debut album had not been released in the United Kingdom yet.|$|E
5|$|The move to top team IFK Göteborg {{went well}} and Augustinsson played {{most of the}} games during the pre-season. When Svenska Cupen began in March, he was first-choice as left-back and played two games in the group stage. IFK Göteborg later won the cup against Djurgården in the final. <b>Just</b> <b>a</b> <b>couple</b> of weeks {{before the start of}} 2013 Allsvenskan, he picked up a knee injury while playing for Sweden U21 which kept him out of action for five months. On his Allsvenskan debut on 25 August 2013 in an away match against Malmö FF he {{suffered}} another injury, which meant that he would be out {{for the rest of the}} season.|$|E

5|$|Upon {{hearing the}} news of the change of government, former viceroy Santiago de Liniers {{prepared}} a counter-revolution from the city of Córdoba, but Francisco Ortiz de Ocampo routed his militia and captured all the leaders in <b>just</b> <b>a</b> <b>couple</b> of skirmishes. The initial orders were to send them to Buenos Aires, but after their capture the Junta decided to execute them. This decision was taken in a resolution signed by all members of the Junta, excepting Manuel Alberti, because as a priest, he could not give consent to the death penalty. The measure found strong popular resistance in Córdoba, as Liniers and the governor Juan Gutierrez de la Concha were popular and the execution of a priest (Rodrigo de Orellana, another leader of the counter-revolution) was rejected as heretical. Ocampo and Chiclana decided to carry on with the original orders, and transferred the prisoners to Buenos Aires.|$|E

In June 2013, the band participated in a short European tour.|$|E

25|$|The Mk I Armadillo was {{produced}} with startling speed. Using {{a wide range}} of trucks conscripted from civilian service, the first 20 were delivered on 7 June and the complete consignment of 312 vehicles within <b>just</b> <b>a</b> <b>couple</b> of weeks. On 20 June, the Air Ministry ordered another 300 vehicles; these Mk II Armadillos would mostly be based on a standard Bedford OL 1½ and 3 ton chassis.|$|E
25|$|Prior to the cartel's creation, Union and Confederate forces {{exchanged}} prisoners sporadically, usually {{as an act}} {{of humanity}} between opposing field commanders. In some cases, a transfer of only sick and wounded captives took place. Exchanges for <b>just</b> <b>a</b> <b>couple</b> of prisoners between sides could prove very time-consuming to achieve. A few military commanders unfamiliar with the practice were reluctant to engage in exchanges without explicit approval and instruction from their superiors.|$|E
25|$|In <b>just</b> <b>a</b> <b>couple</b> {{of decades}} {{the work of}} Fisher, Ford, Arthur Cain, Philip Sheppard and Cyril Clarke {{promoted}} natural selection as the primary explanation of variation in natural populations, instead of genetic drift. Evidence {{can be seen in}} Mayr's famous book Animal Species and Evolution, and Ford's Ecological Genetics. Similar shifts in emphasis can be seen in most of the other participants in the evolutionary synthesis, such as Stebbins and Dobzhansky, though the latter was slow to change.|$|E
5000|$|There {{were some}} mixed {{feelings}} about this episode.

25|$|The band sent several demos {{to record}} companies, but {{were told that}} in order to be {{published}} they had to cut their hair and sing in Swedish. Two years later, Olsson left the band and was replaced by John Levén. <b>Just</b> <b>a</b> <b>couple</b> of months later, Levén joined Yngwie Malmsteen's band Rising Force, and Malmsteen's former bassist, Marcel Jacob, joined Force. This only lasted for three months, though; Levén apparently had issues with Malmsteen, so he and Jacob traded places again.|$|E
25|$|Others {{were not}} so affable. In fact, some stars hedged: Richard Gere, a friend of Wessler's, said yes—but also {{said he would not}} be {{available}} for more than a year. So Wessler waited him out, convinced his sketch was good. Gere eventually called Wessler and told him he was free to shoot, on <b>just</b> <b>a</b> <b>couple</b> of conditions: They had to do it in four days, and they needed to relocate the shoot from Los Angeles to New York City.|$|E
25|$|Hayward {{married and}} {{was living on}} Vancouver Island in British Columbia, with his liver cancer in {{remission}} as he awaited a transplant. On Sunday, July 11, 2010, Little Feat played at the Vancouver Island Music Fest and Hayward was slated to play <b>just</b> <b>a</b> <b>couple</b> of tunes, but once he sat behind his kit, he finished out the night. Hayward had intended {{to return to the}} band in the event of recovery, but he died on August 12, 2010, from pneumonia and complications from lung disease.|$|E

25|$|The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints also {{interprets the}} woman to be the Church, and the man-child to be the {{political}} kingdom that will grow out of the Church prior to or during the Second Coming of Christ; this interpretation arises from Joseph Smith's translation of the twelfth chapter of Revelation. Some in the church interpret {{the woman to}} be {{a symbol of the}} earth. Baptisms of fire and water being poured upon the earth and the sun clothing the earth daily are <b>just</b> <b>a</b> <b>couple</b> examples of this reference.|$|E
25|$|Halqa e Arbab e Zauq was a {{literary}} movement begun in Lahore, British Raj, India in 1936. Early members included poets Noon Meem Rashid, Zia Jallandhari, Muhtar Siddiqui, Hafeez Hoshiarpuri and Meeraji, {{brought to the}} meeting by his friend, Qayyum Nazar, {{an active member of}} the group. The Halqa was the second modern literary movement in Urdu poetry in the 20th century, founded <b>just</b> <b>a</b> <b>couple</b> of years after the leftist Progressive Writers' Movement, and is considered to be the most influential group on modern poetry in the Urdu Language.|$|E
25|$|The end of most {{high-end}} CRT {{production by}} around 2010 (including high-end Sony and Mitsubishi product lines) means {{an erosion of}} the CRT's capability. In Canada and the United States, the sale and production of high-end CRT TVs (30-inch screens) in these markets had all but ended by 2007. <b>Just</b> <b>a</b> <b>couple</b> of years later, inexpensive combo CRT TVs (20-inch screens with an integrated VHS player) disappeared from discount stores. It has been common to replace CRT-based televisions and monitors {{in as little as}} 5–6 years, although they generally are capable of satisfactory performance for a much longer time.|$|E
40|$|We study {{black hole}} {{solutions}} in {{an extension of}} general relativity (GR) with <b>an</b> explicit non-minimal <b>coupling</b> between matter and curvature. General black hole solutions satisfying the known energy conditions are derived including the ones with anti-de Sitter background. These solutions {{differ from those of}} GR by <b>just</b> <b>a</b> <b>coupling</b> function-dependent rescaling of the mass and charge of the black hole and by a 'dressing' of the cosmological constant. The existence of black hole solutions of the non-minimally coupled theory as well as the conditions for a suitable weak-field limit are considered as a constraint on the coupling function responsible for the non-minimal coupling between matter and curvature. The 'dressing' of the cosmological constant is then used to address the cosmological constant problem...|$|R

25|$|The Reds {{launched}} their first attack on 21 February by pounding Väärinmaja {{and the nearby}} villages of Seppälä and Enoranta with artillery fire. They took Enoranta, but three days later, the Whites launched a counterattack and took the village back. The second attack was made on 10 March, but also this one failed. The final attempt on 13 March was again preceded by heavy artillery fire, but Väärinmaja remained in White control. Two days later, the Whites launched a major offensive against Tampere. and the Red front collapsed in <b>just</b> <b>a</b> <b>couple</b> of days.

25|$|I wasn't {{meant to}} be the lead singer of the band.

We had a full list of songs by Wayne Burt and that really made the difference for us. I wasn't writing any songs really and I thought Wayne was a much better singer than me as well but he didn't {{want to be the}} lead singer, so we sort of shared it around for a little while. – Joe Camilleri.|$|E
