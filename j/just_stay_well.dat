"I {{know that}} it must seem preposterous and--and almost ungrateful that I should think of going back, when I might <b>just</b> as <b>well</b> <b>stay.</b> Why, I've a great many more friends here than I have there; I suppose I shall be almost a {{stranger}} when I get there, and there's no comparison in congeniality; and yet I feel that I must go back. I can't tell you why. But I have a longing; I feel that I must try to be of some use in the world--try to do some good--and in Hatboro' I think I shall know how." [...] She put on her glasses, {{and looked at the}} old lady as if she might attempt an explanation, but, as if a clearer vision of the veteran worldling discouraged her, she did not make the effort.|$|R
