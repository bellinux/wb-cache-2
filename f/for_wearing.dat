5|$|Daniel Cloutier (born April 22, 1976) is an Aboriginal Canadian (more {{specifically}} of Métis descent), former professional {{ice hockey}} goaltender and currently a goaltending {{coach for the}} Vancouver Canucks. In his 10-year National Hockey League (NHL) career, Cloutier played with the New York Rangers, Tampa Bay Lightning, Vancouver Canucks and Los Angeles Kings, spending {{the majority of his}} career in Vancouver. He employed a combination of both butterfly and stand-up goaltending and was known <b>for</b> <b>wearing</b> the uncommon birdcage style helmet.|$|E
5|$|No {{images of}} Murrell survive. Accounts {{describe}} him as a short man who walked with {{his hands behind his}} back and hummed as he went. He was also noted <b>for</b> <b>wearing</b> a hard hat, bobbed tale coat, and iron goggles, while carrying a whalebone umbrella and a basket into which he placed the herbs that he collected. His appearance reportedly scared local children, of whom he was nevertheless fond.|$|E
5|$|Researchers at the Cleveland Museum of Natural History gave {{a species}} of praying mantis the name Ilomantis ginsburgae after Ginsburg. The name was given because the neck plate of the Ilomantis ginsburgae bears a {{resemblance}} to a jabot, which Ginsburg is known <b>for</b> <b>wearing.</b> Moreover, the new species was identified based upon the female insect's genitalia instead of based upon the male of the species. The researchers noted that the name was a nod to Ginsburg's fight for gender equality.|$|E

40|$|An {{experimental}} methodology <b>for</b> <b>wear</b> {{assessment of}} extracted polyethylene hip implants was designed in this diploma thesis. Methodology uses optical 3 D scanner and optical profilometer <b>for</b> analysis of <b>wear.</b> Designed methodology <b>for</b> <b>wear</b> analysis was validated by gravimetric method. The results of validation were in good {{agreement with the}} increase of wear rate. Validation results show that the methodology is not suited <b>for</b> <b>wear</b> assessment of metal and ceramic implants which have small wear rates. On the other hand the methodology is more than useful <b>for</b> <b>wear</b> assessment of polyethylene implants. Designed methodology <b>for</b> <b>wear</b> assessment was applied on the set of thirteen extracted polyethylene hip implants. Results of the wear analysis were wear volumes and linear wear noted in the wear maps. Roughness of the surface was measured on explanted cups and results were noted in the roughness map. On articulating surface of the cups different areas were observed for measured roughness. Those areas were described as area with machining marks from manufacturing process, polished area from combination of abrasive and adhesive wear, polished area from micro-contact fatigue and area including plastic deformation...|$|R

5|$|As {{early as}} the late 1380s and early 1390s, Isabeau {{demonstrated}} that she possessed diplomatic influence when the Florentine delegation requested her political intervention in the Gian Galeazzo Visconti affair. Orléans and the Duke of Burgundy were in the pro-Visconti faction while the anti-Visconti faction included Isabeau, her brother, Louis VII, Duke of Bavaria, and John III, Count of Armagnac. At that time Isabeau lacked the political power to effect change. Some years later, however, at the 1396 wedding of her seven-year-old daughter, Isabella, to Richard II of England (an event at which Charles attacked a herald <b>for</b> <b>wearing</b> Galeazzo's livery), Isabeau successfully negotiated an alliance between France and Florence with Florentine ambassador Buonaccorso Pitti.|$|E
5|$|In 1907, Australian swimmer and {{performer}} Annette Kellerman {{was arrested}} on a Boston beach <b>for</b> <b>wearing</b> form-fitting sleeveless one-piece knitted swimming tights that covered her from neck to toe, a costume she adopted from England, although it became accepted swimsuit attire for women in parts of Europe by 1910. In 1913, designer Carl Jantzen made the first functional two-piece swimwear. Inspired {{by the introduction of}} females into Olympic swimming he designed a close-fitting costume with shorts for the bottom and short sleeves for the top.|$|E

50|$|In 1950, the Women's Army Corps {{were issued}} new Goldenlite Yellow-on-brown {{insignia}} <b>for</b> <b>wear</b> with the taupe WAC uniform. It {{was the same}} size as the men's small 2-inch-wide Goldenlite stripes. Even after male personnel were issued larger 3-inch-wide insignia in 1951, female personnel would wear the smaller 2-inch insignia until 1998. In 1951 they were assigned the surplus men's Goldenlite Yellow-on-dark-blue stripes <b>for</b> <b>wear</b> with the Olive Drab or fatigue uniforms. Also in 1951, the optional white WAC dress uniform was now authorized <b>for</b> <b>wear</b> by enlisted and NCO ranks and 2-inch Goldenlite Yellow-on-white stripes were created to be worn with it.|$|R
5|$|In {{his later}} {{political}} career, he became known <b>for</b> <b>wearing</b> {{a bright red}} vest and tie. He adopted this dress during his term as vice-president when he and James Reeside, a mail contractor known for his drab dress, passed a tailor's shop that displayed a bright red cloth in the window. Johnson suggested that Reeside should wear a red vest because the mail coaches he owned and operated were red. Reeside agreed to do so if Johnson would also. Both men ordered red vests and neckties, and were known for donning this attire {{for the rest of}} their lives.|$|E
5|$|In this game, the Crimson Tide wore Nike Pro Combat uniforms for {{the first}} time. These uniforms {{featured}} crimson jerseys with grey and white houndstooth numbers, a houndstooth stripe on the helmet, houndstooth gloves and an American flag sewn {{into one of the}} sleeves in honor of Veterans Day. The houndstooth design was chosen as a tribute to former Alabama coach Bear Bryant who was known <b>for</b> <b>wearing</b> a houndstooth fedora during games. The victory improved Alabama's all-time record against the Bulldogs to 73–18–3 (75–17–3 without NCAA vacations and forfeits).|$|E
5|$|Riya's {{on-screen}} performances {{have established}} {{her as a}} bold youth icon in India. Since entering the film industry, she has gained attention <b>for</b> <b>wearing</b> a bikini in Shaadi No. 1 and sharing on-screen kisses with co-stars Ashmit Patel in Silsiilay and Sharman Joshi in Style, respectively. Such performances garnered negative attention because of the relatively conservative outlook of Indian cinema {{at that time and}} her own statements about such practices. In 2008, Riya Sen was also linked to author Salman Rushdie. Before becoming a film star, she had a reputation for partying, which started at the age of fifteen. Riya's public persona is compared to her mother Moon Moon, who was seen as a sex symbol of her time, while her sister Raima is mostly compared to their grandmother Suchitra.|$|E

5|$|The family's {{problems}} are compounded when Kiat Kun accidentally loses Seow Fang's only {{pair of shoes}} after taking them to be repaired. The children conduct a frantic search but find nothing; a karung guni man had claimed the shoes as unwanted rubbish. The Chew siblings are frustrated and rendered helpless by the situation until their father inspires Kiat Kun to share his shoes with his sister, trading off between classes so they can both attend school. Unfortunately, this plan brings additional problems: Seow Fang is chastised <b>for</b> <b>wearing</b> oversized shoes to school, while Kiat Kun is repeatedly late as he must wait for his sister to exchange shoes with him.|$|E
5|$|Croitoru had {{a history}} of run-ins with the police. Many of his legal {{problems}} came while he was president of the Hamilton, Ontario chapter of the Satan's Choice Outlaw motorcycle club. He was arrested for trafficking cocaine and served ten months in prison. Soon after, he was convicted of assault and was given a sentence of seven months. He encountered more problems on December 15, 1996 when he and several friends from Satan's Choice were kicked out of a strip club <b>for</b> <b>wearing</b> their gang's colors. To get revenge, Croitoru and his friends planned to blow up the strip club. They changed their minds, however, and decided to bomb the local police station instead. The bomb caused $133,000 in damages to the Sudbury, Ontario police station and a nearby bank and injured a police officer. Croitoru and two friends were arrested and charged, but the trial did not begin until almost two years later.|$|E
5|$|Howe and Murray {{returned}} to England in 1778. Howe was disaffected by his experiences of command in North America, and consequently did not bestow patronage on those junior officers under his command, {{as was the}} custom. Instead a friend of Murray's father, Captain George Montagu arranged for him {{to draw up a}} record of his service and good conduct in the North American campaign, which was then passed on to the First Lord of the Admiralty, John Montagu, 4th Earl of Sandwich. He passed his lieutenant's examination on 19 November 1778, and quickly received his commission on 31 December that year. He was to be second lieutenant aboard the 32-gun , under Captain Charles Holmes Everitt. It was to be a short-lived appointment as on 19 March 1779 she ran aground and was wrecked on the Breton coast while chasing a French frigate. Murray was captured and became a prisoner of war, spending the next two years in captivity and occupying himself with the study of the French language and naval regulations. He was released and exchanged {{when he came to the}} attention of the French authorities after chastising an American privateersman <b>for</b> <b>wearing</b> a British uniform.|$|E

5|$|On 15 February 2002, {{while at}} Speakers' Corner, Singapore Democratic Party chief Chee Soon Juan {{attacked}} the Government's decision to suspend four Muslim girls <b>for</b> <b>wearing</b> the tudung (Islamic headscarf) to public schools. Contrary to police advice, {{he chose not}} to apply for a public entertainment licence, arguing he did not need one. Chee's speech sparked heated exchanges involving the Sikh practice of wearing turbans. In July, Chee was convicted and fined S$3,000 for speaking without the required licence. In his judgment, District Judge Kow Keng Siong emphasized the twin considerations of public order and national security in multi-racial and multi-religious Singapore, finding that Chee's speech had bred social unrest. Under the Constitution of Singapore, a person who has been fined at least $2,000 cannot stand for election to Parliament for five years. As a result of the incident, Chee was barred from contesting the 2006 general elections.|$|E
5|$|On {{the outer}} {{fringes of the}} few small gay {{communities}} were people who challenged gender expectations. They were effeminate men and masculine women, or people assigned male at birth who dressed and lived as women and people assigned female at birth who dressed and lived as men, respectively, either part or full-time. Contemporary nomenclature classified them as transvestites, {{and they were the}} most visible representatives of sexual minorities. They belied the carefully crafted image portrayed by the Mattachine Society and DOB that asserted homosexuals were respectable, normal people. The Mattachine and DOB considered the trials of being arrested <b>for</b> <b>wearing</b> clothing of the opposite gender as a parallel to the struggles of homophile organizations: similar but distinctly separate. Gay and transgender people staged a small riot at the Cooper Do-nuts cafe in Los Angeles in 1959 in response to police harassment.|$|E
5|$|On {{top of all}} {{the misery}} the Zoroastrians had to pay a heavy {{religious}} tax known as Jizya. Zoroastrian sources record the method of extracting this as designed to humiliate the dhimmi, the taxed person, who was compelled to stand while the officer receiving the money sat on a high throne. Upon receiving the payment, the officer gave the dhimmi a blow on the neck and drove him roughly away. The public was invited to watch the spectacle. Arab tax collectors would mock Zoroastrians <b>for</b> <b>wearing</b> Kushti and would rip it off, hanging the cord around the necks of the beleaguered faithful. Due to corruption of the tax officials, at times twice and even three times the official figure would be collected, because every intermediary had to receive his share. If the families could not afford paying the Jizya, their children were beaten and even tortured and their religious books were thrown in fire. That is how the term “the bookless” came about. Under the woeful conditions, some had to convert and {{there were those who}} declared themselves Muslims, picked up Islamic names, but in secret continued Zoroastrian practices. Today the latter group among the Zoroastrians is known as Jaddid. In response to persecution and segregation policies, the Zoroastrians community became closed, introverted, and static.|$|E
