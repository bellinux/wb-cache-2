40|$|Ultra {{wideband}} (UWB) technology plays {{a significant}} role in wireless communication. The complex antenna transfer function (CATF) of an UWB antenna provides important information required for better channel designs and communication systems. In this dissertation the CATF of a Double ridge guide horn (DRGH) antenna is determined and used as a <b>standard</b> <b>antenna</b> for UWB measurements. Two methods were used: the two antenna method in an anechoic chamber and a modified gain-transfer method in a compact antenna test range (CATR). Measurements were performed with a vector network analyser (VNA) in the frequency domain, in the anechoic chamber and the CATR. The distance measurements required to calculate the CATF from the S-parameter measurements were performed in the time domain. The CATF of the <b>standard</b> <b>antenna</b> was determined using two identical antennas and then it was shown that a modified gain-transfer method can be used to determine the CATF of any unknown antenna in a CATR, using the <b>standard</b> <b>antenna</b> as a reference. Some of the challenges were to obtain the correct equations and measurement method to obtain the CATF in a CATR. The <b>standard</b> <b>antenna</b> was used to investigate uncertainty contributions for the measurements in the CATR.

40|$|The gain is an {{important}} figure of merit to describe the performance of an antenna under test (AUT). For radiation pattern envelope (RPE) measurements or other ad-hoc scans, the realized gain of the AUT is often determined by applying the gain-transfer (gain-comparison) method. The relative measurement values are compared with a measurement of a <b>standard</b> <b>antenna</b> (SGH) with a known gain. Ideally, the gain values of the <b>standard</b> <b>antennas</b> {{are based on a}} traceable calibration. But also, the calculated gain of commercially available <b>standard</b> <b>antennas</b> is usually supplied by the manufacturer. However, these values do not necessarily describe the realized gain for the current reference measurement. They may result from different setups or refer to non-identical environmental conditions or on a different gain definition. This paper explains the benefits and limitations of the pattern integration technique, to provide validated reference values of the SGH in the current measurement setup within reasonable time. The results presented are based on measurements in the DLR Compact Test Rang...|$|R

40|$|Using {{more than}} just on antenna can {{significantly}} speed up the data rate in a wireless communication system. These systems are {{commonly referred to as}} Diversity- and MIMO-systems. Due to tight volume restriction for the antennas, e. g. in a mobile phone, electromagnetic coupling between the antennas will degrade the capacity of the wireless system and lower the coverage. In the proposed thesis, a thorough study of Ethertronics’ <b>standard</b> <b>antennas</b> will be established in which the antennas will be used in a multiport system, e. g. MIMO. The thesis will be strongly related to Ethertronics’ engagement in Chase and therefore also dependent on the latest progresses on MPA (Multiport Analyzer) developed in Chase.

40|$|Measuring {{differences}} in the <b>economic</b> <b>standard</b> of living of between natives and other ethnic groups can inform us about the relative disadvantages and inequalities within Italian society. Despite {{the importance of this}} question, the measurement of this gap is not an easy task because, when using the usual design-based approach to survey sampling inference, the available micro-data lack sufficient sample size for the majority of immi- grant communities needed to obtain reliable estimates. In this paper, we show that small area estimation (SAE) techniques can be applied in a fruitful way to avoid this issue. In particular, we use an approach based on M-quantile regression for estimating the <b>economic</b> <b>standard</b> of living in each community in Italy. Our findings highlight economic disparities between natives and other ethnic groups and suggest the need to adopt specific policies that target the most vulnerable immigrant communities and are designed to improve their <b>economic</b> <b>standard</b> of living...|$|R
