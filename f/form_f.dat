5|$|In the 19th and 20th centuries, some taxonomists {{inspected}} serval {{skins and}} identified two {{species on the}} basis of coat pattern: Felis serval (serval), with large, pronounced spots, and F. servalina or F. ornata (servaline cat), marked by freckle-sized dots. F. servalina was first described in 1839 by Irish naturalist William Ogilby from Sierra Leone; in 1867, British zoologist John Edward Gray described F. herschelii from an Indian skin, which was probably the same as the servaline cat. In 1907, British zoologist Reginald Innes Pocock commented that the two forms should be considered independent species, but reverted from this in 1917. Eventually, the two forms came to be recognised as the same species. Another <b>form,</b> <b>F.</b> himalayanus (Himalayan serval), was described from a skin procured from the Himalayan region; however, Scottish naturalist William Jardine noted in The Naturalist's Library (1843) that no such specimen had been identified by him or his colleagues, and that it differed considerably from the common serval. In 1944, Pocock identified three races of the serval from northern Africa.|$|E

Genetic analysis indicates that both phenotypes are inherited as autosomal dominants. Cross hybridizations indicate the phenotypes are produced by isoalleles at a single locus.|$|E
25|$|Paeonia daurica {{was first}} {{described}} by Henry Charles Andrews {{in the seventh}} volume of his Botanist's Repository published in 1807. A yellow flowered Paeonia species from Abkhazia was collected by C.M. Worontzoff, and described in 1846 by John Lindley, who named it P.wittmanniana Lindl.. In 1848 Christian von Steven described another taxon with yellow petals under the same specific name P.wittmanniana Steven. It had been collected at Atskhu, Meskheti Province, in Georgia. Pierre Edmond Boissier made descriptions of three taxa in this complex in 1869: P.corallina and P.corallina var. triternata, and P.wittmanniana Steven. Franz Josef Ruprecht in 1869, distinguished P.triternata f. coriifolia. In 1892 Ernst Huth distinguished between P.corallina var. typica with entire leaflets and red petals, and P.wittmanniana with lobed leaflets and yellow petals. Russian botanist Nikolai Michailowitsch Albow {{was the first to}} think that a difference only in petal colour does not merit distinguishing species, and he reduced P.wittmanniana to P.corallina var. wittmanniana, under which he described a new <b>form,</b> <b>f.</b> macrophylla. Aleksandr Aleksandrovich Lomakin recognized four species in this group in 1897: P.corallina, P.mlokosewitschii, P.macrophylla, P.wittmanniana, and introduced P.wittmanniana var. tomentosa. In 1899, Vladimir Ippolitovich Lipsky mostly supported the ideas of Lomakin, but distinguished between P.triternata and P.corallina. In 1901, Nikolai Busch recognized P.corallina subsp. triternata, its variety coriifolia (Rupr.), P.wittmanniana f. macrophylla and subsp. tomentosa, and P.mlokosewitschii. Alexander Grossheim distinguished in 1930 seven taxa that differed in the colour of the petals, the shape and number of leaflets, and the hairiness of the leaflets and fruits, so recognizing P.corallina var. caucasica and var. coriifolia, P.mlokosewitschii, P.wittmanniana and its var. macrophylla, P.tomentosa and the new P.abchasica. Nikolai Schipczinsky in the Flora of the USSR (1937) distinguished between P.mlokosewitschii - as part of the series Obovatae having orbicular, ovate or rarely pointed leaflets - and P.triternata, P.caucasica, P.wittmanniana, P.macrophylla, P.tomentosa and P.abchasica - all having rather wide, pointed leaflets – assigning them to the series Corallinae. Frederick Claude Stern in his book A study of the genus Paeonia recognized in his subsection Foliolatae the species P.daurica, P.mlokosewitschii and P.wittmanniana, the latter with four varieties. In 1950 Grossgeim revised his view from 1930 and recognized P.kavachensis (= P.caucasica), P.mlokosewitschii (including P.tomentosa) and P.wittmanniana (including P.abchasica). P.wittmanniana Steven was renamed to P.steveniana by the Georgian botanist Kemularia-Nathadze in 1961, who recognized all previous taxa except P.abchasica in addition to describing a new species named P.ruprechtiana. In 2010 D.Y. Hong revised the genus Paeonia, recognising seven subspecies in P. daurica, among which the new subsp. velebitensis.|$|E
