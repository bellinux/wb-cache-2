5|$|Also late on Thursday, {{managers}} officially released Endeavour {{from its}} stand-by state, as Atlantis was cleared of any damage to its <b>heat</b> <b>shield</b> {{and was in}} good shape to return to Earth.|$|E
5|$|Some {{concerns}} were raised that the Gemini spacecraft's <b>heat</b> <b>shield</b> {{would not have}} been able to protect it during the higher speed ballistic reentry associated with the trajectory that would have been required. NASA proposed using a thicker <b>heat</b> <b>shield</b> and more insulation to protect the spacecraft. This and several other modifications made the spacecraft too heavy to be launched by the Titan II rocket which was used for the original twelve Gemini missions, so several solid rocket motors would have been added to allow this additional mass to be flown.|$|E
5|$|Glenn landed safely, but an {{inspection}} of his capsule revealed {{that one of}} the landing bag switches had been faulty. Kraft was right; the <b>heat</b> <b>shield</b> had not been loose after all. The lessons that he drew from this experience were clear.|$|E
5000|$|Reentry <b>heat</b> <b>shields</b> {{on these}} {{vehicles}} are often proposed {{to be some}} sort of ceramic and/or carbon-carbon <b>heat</b> <b>shields,</b> or occasionally metallic <b>heat</b> <b>shields</b> (possibly using water cooling or some sort of relatively exotic rare earth metal.) [...] Some shields would be single-use ablatives, discarded after reentry.|$|R
50|$|These systems {{often work}} in {{combination}} with engine cooling and exhaust systems. <b>Heat</b> <b>shielding</b> is necessary to prevent engine heat from damaging heat-sensitive components. The majority of older cars use simple steel <b>heat</b> <b>shielding</b> to reduce thermal radiation and convection. It is now most common for modern cars are to use aluminium <b>heat</b> <b>shielding</b> which has a lower density, can be easily formed and does not corrode {{in the same way}} as steel. Higher performance vehicles are beginning to use ceramic <b>heat</b> <b>shielding</b> as this can withstand far higher temperatures as well as further reductions in heat transfer.|$|R
50|$|<b>Heat</b> <b>shields</b> {{are also}} known as burner <b>shields,</b> <b>heat</b> plates, <b>heat</b> tents, {{radiation}} <b>shields,</b> or <b>heat</b> angles. They serve the same purpose as a rock grate and rock, protecting the burner from corrosive meat drippings and dispersing heat. They are more common in newer grills. <b>Heat</b> <b>shields</b> are lighter, easier to replace and harbor less bacteria than rocks.|$|R
5|$|In {{addition}} to the survey of the orbiter's <b>heat</b> <b>shield,</b> the crew gathered and inspected the EVA tools and spacesuits {{that would be used}} for the mission's spacewalks and prepared the Flight Support System (FSS) for berthing with Hubble on flight day three.|$|E
5|$|While the spacewalk {{preparations}} were underway, Altman and McArthur {{completed a}} robotic survey {{of a small}} row of <b>heat</b> <b>shield</b> tiles {{that had not been}} sufficiently imaged during the day two inspection. Following the analysis of the survey, the managers cleared all of the TPS systems until the pre-landing inspection.|$|E
5|$|Following {{the morning}} wake up call, the crew {{began work on}} the day's tasks, which were {{centered}} on inspection of the orbiter's <b>heat</b> <b>shield.</b> Using the shuttle robotic arm and the Orbiter Boom Sensor System (OBSS), the crew went through a detailed inspection of the orbiter's thermal protection system (TPS) tile and Reinforced carbon-carbon (RCC) surfaces. During the inspection, engineers on the ground noticed a small area of tile on the forward area of the shuttle's right wing that appeared to have suffered some damage during ascent.|$|E
5000|$|Due to {{the large}} amounts of heat given off by {{internal}} combustion engines, <b>heat</b> <b>shields</b> are used on most engines to protect components and bodywork from heat damage. As well as protection, effective <b>heat</b> <b>shields</b> can give a performance benefit by reducing the under-bonnet temperatures, therefore reducing the intake temperature. <b>Heat</b> <b>shields</b> vary widely in price, but most are easy to fit, usually by stainless steel clips or high temperature tape. There are two main types of automotive heat shield: ...|$|R

5|$|On 20 June 2010, 611 C3 Picassos built between January and March 2010 were {{recalled}} due to incorrectly routed fuel pipes, {{which were}} {{believed to have been}} in contact with the <b>heat</b> <b>shield.</b> This fault may have caused chafing and may lead to a fuel leak. The models were built between January and March 2010 and were sold in the UK. On 24 August 2010, all 13,234 Picassos sold in the UK were recalled because the windscreen trim could deteriorate, and could eventually detach, leading to a loose-fitting windscreen.|$|E
5|$|The United States Air Force {{intended}} to use the Gemini spacecraft to transport astronauts to its proposed space stations, the Manned Orbital Development System and later the Manned Orbital Laboratory (MOL). These stations would have been launched by Titan IIIM rockets, with a Gemini spacecraft atop, {{eliminating the need for}} rendezvous and docking maneuvers. For this purpose, several modifications were made to the Gemini capsule, including the installation of a hatch in the <b>heat</b> <b>shield</b> to allow access to the space station.|$|E
5|$|The {{delay in}} the CSM caused by the fire enabled NASA {{to catch up on}} man-rating the LM and Saturn V. Apollo 4 (AS-501) was the first {{unmanned}} flight of the Saturn V, carrying a Block I CSM on November 9, 1967. The capability of the Command Module's <b>heat</b> <b>shield</b> to survive a trans-lunar reentry was demonstrated by using the Service Module engine to ram it into the atmosphere at higher than the usual Earth-orbital reentry speed.|$|E

5|$|An {{atmospheric}} probe {{was released from}} the spacecraft in July 1995, entering the planet's atmosphere on December 7, 1995. After a high-g descent into the Jovian atmosphere, the probe discarded the remains of its <b>heat</b> <b>shield,</b> and it parachuted through 150km of the atmosphere, collecting data for 57.6minutes, before being crushed by the pressure and temperature to which it was subjected (about 22 times Earth normal, at a temperature of 153°C). It would have melted thereafter, and possibly vaporized. The Galileo orbiter itself experienced a more rapid version of the same fate when it was deliberately steered into the planet on September 21, 2003 at a speed of over 50km/s, in order to avoid any possibility of it crashing into and contaminating Europa.|$|E
5|$|Following the {{separation}} burn, the crew {{set to work}} performing the standard late inspection of the thermal protection system of the orbiter. Using the robotic arm, McArthur, Altman, and Johnson worked through the procedures to inspect the wing leading-edge panels, reinforced carbon-carbon nose cap, and <b>heat</b> <b>shield</b> tiles. After evaluating the weather reports, managers on the ground slightly refined the schedule for landing, opting to bring the shuttle home one orbit early {{to try to avoid}} the possibility of showers that would prevent a landing on Friday. The new landing opportunity would bring the crew home at 10:01am EDT.|$|E
5|$|Once in orbit, Big G {{would have}} docked with space {{stations}} using an Apollo docking probe {{mounted on the}} rear of the cargo module, which was in turn mounted on {{the rear of the}} re-entry module. The re-entry module itself would have been enlarged to accommodate the larger crew, and the modifications made to the spacecraft for the MOL program would have been incorporated, including the hatch in the <b>heat</b> <b>shield,</b> which would have been used to provide access to the cargo module. In the event of a launch failure, the launch escape system developed for the Apollo spacecraft would have been used to propel the re-entry module clear of the rocket.|$|E

5|$|One of {{the reasons}} for the move from Zeus to Nike-X was concern that the Zeus radars would not be able to tell the {{difference}} between the warhead and a decoy until it was too late to launch. One solution to this problem was the Sprint missile, which had the performance required to wait until decluttering was complete. Another potential solution was to look for some sort of signature of the reentry through the highest levels of the atmosphere that might differ between a warhead and decoy; specifically, it appeared that the ablation of the <b>heat</b> <b>shield</b> might produce a clear signature pointing out the warhead.|$|E
5|$|Unable to {{maneuver}} the Soyuz to dock with the station, Stone ejects herself via explosive decompression {{and uses a}} fire extinguisher as a makeshift thruster to travel the final metres to Tiangong, which is rapidly deorbiting. Stone then enters the Shenzhou capsule just as Tiangong starts to break up on the upper edge of the atmosphere. Stone radios that she is ready {{to head back to}} Earth. After re-entering the atmosphere, Stone hears Mission Control, which is tracking the capsule and sending a rescue. But due to a harsh reentry and the premature jettison of the <b>heat</b> <b>shield,</b> a fire starts inside the capsule.|$|E
5|$|MOL Launches {{would have}} been {{conducted}} from Launch Complex 40 at the Cape Canaveral Air Force Station, and Space Launch Complex 6 at Vandenberg Air Force Base. In 1966, a test flight was launched from LC-40, using a Titan IIIC. It consisted of the Gemini B spacecraft, built from the spacecraft used for the Gemini 2 test flight, atop OPS 0855, a boilerplate MOL space station. Gemini B was released on a suborbital trajectory, and descended to Earth to test modifications made to the <b>heat</b> <b>shield,</b> and ensure that the access hatch would not affect its performance. OPS 0855 continued on to orbit. Early MOL stations would have only been manned by a single crew, launched with the station. Later stations {{would have been}} designed to be resupplied, and support multiple crews, delivered by additional Gemini spacecraft, or derivatives.|$|E

5|$|On {{board the}} Forerunner ship, the Master Chief is {{captured}} and interrogated by Covenant forces, but manages to escape using a concealed weapon. On Earth, Ruwan and Tyla escape detection by the Covenant and appropriate a vehicle {{in an effort}} to escape. Ruwan reveals that the Key is in fact a fictional object that he and his brother James Ackerson made up as children; James told the Covenant about the Key in order to prevent the outright destruction of Cleveland. After fighting Covenant forces, Ruwan and Tyla are rescued by marines and leave the city. The Master Chief attempts to kill the Covenant's leader, Prophet of Truth, but is discovered as he takes aim; Truth escapes as the Chief is left to kill the Prophet's guards and find a way off the ship. Learning {{that there is no way}} to change the Forerunner ship's destination, the Chief jumps to Earth using a piece of the vessel as a <b>heat</b> <b>shield.</b>|$|E
