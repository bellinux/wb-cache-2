40|$|The {{foothold}} trap is {{an important}} tool {{that is used by}} the U. S. Department of Agriculture Animal Damage Control (ADC) program to capture coyotes (Canis latrans) that are causing livestock depredations. In FY 1990 and FY 1991 the ADC program trapped 17, 732 and 15, 805 coyotes, respectively (USDA 1991; 1992). Foothold traps can cause trauma and injury to feet and legs (Englund 1982; Linhart et al. 1986; Olsen et al. 1986, 1988; Onderka et al. 1990, Tullar 1984) and Onderka et al. (1990) observed oral injuries such as broken teeth, and tongue and gum lacerations in captured animals. The ADC program and other organizations such as the U. S. Technical Advisory Group for Humane Trap Standards (Linhart 1990), are investigating means of reducing injuries to animals caught in traps. Two approaches to reduce injuries, trap modification and the use of a tranquilizer, have been investigated and previously tested in the field. Most of the studies have focused upon trap modifications. Several studies have evaluated the padded <b>jaw</b> <b>trap</b> (Linhart et al. 1986; 1988; Linhart and Dasch 1992; Olsen et al. 1986; Onderka et al. 1990; Tullar 1984).

50|$|<b>Trap</b> <b>Jaw's</b> origin is very {{different}} in the 2002 comic series. Originally a minion of Keldor named Kronis, he was badly injured during a fight with the Council of Elders. He was then rebuilt into a cyborg by replacing his damaged humanoid arm and jaw with mechanical parts, renaming himself <b>Trap</b> <b>Jaw.</b> Later, the cartoon demonstrates that the more metal he eats the stronger he becomes, and one episode focuses on a quest to eat the strongest chemical element in Eternia called Eternium (which was forged and guarded {{by a group of}} subterranean dwellers called the Kulatuks).

50|$|Although the {{beech marten}} is a {{valuable}} animal to the fur trade, its pelt is inferior in quality {{to that of the}} pine marten and sable. Beech marten skins on the fur markets of the Soviet Union accounted for only 10-12% of the market presence of pine marten skins. Beech martens were caught only in the Caucasus, in the Montane part of Crimea and (in very small numbers) in the rest of Ukraine, and in the republics of Middle Asia. Because animals with more valuable pelts are rare in those areas, the beech marten is of value to hunters on the local market. Beech martens are captured with <b>jaw</b> <b>traps,</b> or, for live capture, with cage traps. The shooting of beech martens is inefficient, and trailing them with dogs is only successful when the animal can be trapped in a tree hollow.|$|R
50|$|The steppe polecat is {{of great}} {{economic}} value to nations of the former Soviet Union. It kills large numbers of rodents harmful to agriculture and which spread disease; a single steppe polecat can destroy at least 200 ground squirrels a year or 1,500 mouse-like rodents in winter alone. It is also {{very important to the}} fur trade of the former Soviet Union. It holds first place among harvested furbearers in Kazakhstan and other regions. However, steppe polecat numbers dropped noticeably during 1926-1929 and 1956-1959. This decline was attributed to changes in steppe landscapes and a decrease in the species' natural prey in connection with the application of chemical methods in controlling rodent populations, the plowing of Virgin Lands and changes in agrochemical methods. The steppe polecat is fairly easy to harvest. It is primarily caught with <b>jaw</b> <b>traps</b> located near inhabited burrows.|$|R

25|$|There {{are other}} ants with trap-jaws {{such as the}} extant Strumigenys, Mystrium, Myrmoteras and Anochetus along with the extinct Cretaceous age tribe Haidomyrmecini.

25|$|O. bauri {{is able to}} {{recognize}} other workers from different nests by antennation. This process happens when two ants are front to front of one another, and either one is touching the other’s antennae with their antennae or head. There are four different behavioral patterns that may result after recognition of the other ant. These are basic alertness, alarm, attack with mandibles or attack with sting. Basic alertness occurs when both ants open their mandibles to about 180°. Alarm is composed of both basic alertness with fast random body movements and release of alarm pheromone. Attack with mandibles is a pattern in which the <b>trap</b> <b>jaw</b> ant will use its mandibles in order to strike {{a blow to the}} opponent. Attack with sting is when the <b>trap</b> <b>jaw</b> ant will bend its abdomen forward and try to use its sting to hurt the opponent.|$|R
40|$|The {{effectiveness}} and selectivity of several traps and trap Modifications were field-evaluated and compared in Alabama from 1977 to 19 B 0. No. 220 Conibear traps placed in baited open-end boxes (TB) {{on the ground}} posed a hazard to dogs and were not recommended for general use in terrestrial sets. They may be effective to control feral dogs in special situations or areas. TB devices attached to tree trunks 1 m above the ground eliminated the hazard to dogs, but rendered the trap ineffective for taking small mammals. No. 220 Conibear traps with selective position treadle triggers placed in trail water-sets were significantly less effective for taking raccoon and other small mammals than standard <b>jaw</b> <b>traps.</b> No. 120 Conibear TB baited with putrified deer meat or fresh fish were found in field evaluations to take one opossum or raccoon per 8. 4 trap nights and caused no mortality in dogs.

The No. 120 Conibear TB {{appears to be an}} effective means for selectively taking 2 to 7 kg mammals, particularly with pre-baiting.
