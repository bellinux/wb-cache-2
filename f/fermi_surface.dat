25|$|It is {{difficult}} to visualize {{the shape of a}} band as a function of wavevector, as it would require a plot in four-dimensional space, E vs. kx, ky, kz. In scientific literature it is common to see band structure plots which show the values of E'n(k) for values of k along straight lines connecting symmetry points, often labelled Δ, Λ, Σ, or , , and , respectively. Another method for visualizing band structure is to plot a constant-energy isosurface in wavevector space, showing all of the states with energy equal to a particular value. The isosurface of states with energy equal to the Fermi level is known as the <b>Fermi</b> <b>surface.</b>|$|E
25|$|In reality, {{there is}} {{interaction}} between the electrons {{with each other and}} the atomic cores of the crystal. This has several consequences: For example, the unambiguous relation between energy and momentum of an electronic state is broken and an electronic band structure is formed. Measuring the momentum of one electronic state gives a distribution of momenta which are all separated by reciprocal lattice vectors. Hence, an ACAR measurement on a solid with completely filled bands (i.e. on an insulator) gives a continuous distribution. An ACAR measurement on a metal has discontinuities where bands cross the Fermi level in all Brillouin zones in reciprocal space. This discontinuous distribution is superimposed by a continuous distribution from the entirely filled bands. From the discontinuities the <b>Fermi</b> <b>surface</b> can be extracted.|$|E

40|$|Isoscalar Cooper pairing in isospin {{asymmetric}} nuclear matter occurs {{between states}} populating two distinct <b>Fermi</b> <b>surfaces,</b> each for neutrons and protons. The {{transition from a}} BCS-like to the normal (unpaired) state, as the isospin asymmetry is increased, is intervened by superconducting phases which spontaneously break translational and rotational symmetries. One possibility is {{the formation of a}} condensate with a periodic crystallinelike structure where Cooper pairs carry net momentum (the nuclear Larkin-Ovchinnikov-Fulde-Ferrell-phase). Alternatively, perturbations of the <b>Fermi</b> <b>surfaces</b> away from spherical symmetry allow for minima in the condensate free energy which correspond to a states with quadrupole deformations of <b>Fermi</b> <b>surfaces</b> and zero momentum of the Cooper pairs.

40|$|We {{describe}} {{the properties of}} a mixture of fermionic and bosonic atoms, as they are tuned across a Feshbach resonance associated with a fermionic molecular state. Provided the number of fermionic atoms exceeds the number of bosonic atoms, we {{argue that there is}} a critical detuning at which the Bose-Einstein condensate (BEC) is completely depleted. The phases on either side of this quantum phase transition can also be distinguished by the distinct Luttinger constraints on their <b>Fermi</b> <b>surfaces.</b> In both phases, the total volume enclosed by all <b>Fermi</b> <b>surfaces</b> is constrained {{by the total number of}} fermions. However, in the phase without the BEC, which has two <b>Fermi</b> <b>surfaces,</b> there is a _second_ Luttinger constraint: the volume enclosed by one of the <b>Fermi</b> <b>surfaces</b> is constrained by the total number of_bosons_, so that the volumes enclosed by the two <b>Fermi</b> <b>surfaces</b> are separately conserved. The phase with the BEC may have one or two <b>Fermi</b> <b>surfaces,</b> but only their total volume is conserved. We obtain the phase diagram as a function of atomic parameters and temperature, and describe critical fluctuations in the vicinity of all transitions. We make quantitative predictions valid for the case of a narrow Feshbach resonance, but we expect the qualitative features we describe to be more generally applicable. As an aside, we point out intriguing connections between the BEC depletion transition and the transition to the fractionalized Fermi liquid in Kondo lattice models.

50|$|The {{electronic}} structure of superconducting cuprates is highly anisotropic (see the crystal structure of YBCO or BSCCO). Therefore, the <b>Fermi</b> <b>surface</b> of HTSC {{is very close}} to the <b>Fermi</b> <b>surface</b> of the doped CuO2 plane (or multi-planes, in case of multi-layer cuprates) and can be presented on the 2D reciprocal space (or momentum space) of the CuO2 lattice.

It can be derived from the band structure calculations or measured by angle resolved photoemission spectroscopy (ARPES).

In a wide range of charge carrier concentration (doping level), in which the hole-doped HTSC are superconducting, the <b>Fermi</b> <b>surface</b> is hole-like (i.e. open, as shown in Fig. 1).

40|$|Recently {{the discoveries}} of graphene, Weyl {{semi-metal}} and Dirac semi-metal are drawing {{more and more}} people’s attentions back to the topological characteristics of <b>Fermi</b> <b>surfaces,</b> which may be tracked back to the pair of Weyl points observed experimentally in the phase A of Helium three in 80 s in the last century. Based on the pioneer works by Volovik and Hořava, we classify all kinds of <b>Fermi</b> <b>surfaces</b> with respect to anti-unitary symmetries and codimensions of <b>Fermi</b> <b>surfaces.</b> The first chapter of this thesis is attributed to develop symmetry-dependent topological invariants to characterize topological properties of <b>Fermi</b> <b>surfaces,</b> and map out the periodic classification tables of <b>Fermi</b> <b>surfaces.</b> Compared with the existing classification of topological insulators (TIs) and superconductors (TSCs), {{it is observed that}} there exists a two-step dimension shift from our classification of <b>Fermi</b> <b>surfaces.</b> Actually the two classifications can both be derived rigorously in the framework of K-theory, a mathematical algebraic topology theory for stable fiber bundles, where the dimension shift can also be derived rigorously by constructing maps between <b>Fermi</b> <b>surfaces</b> and TIs/TSCs. This unified treatment of the two classifications is of mathematical elegance, even providing us deeper understandings of these topological phenomena, and is the subject of chapter II of this thesis. In the beginning of chapter III, when applying our theory of topological <b>Fermi</b> <b>surfaces</b> on the boundary of TIs/TSCs, a general index theory is conjectured describing a faithful boundary-bulk correspondence of TIs/TSCs, which is motivated by the dimension shift in the two classifications. Then we construct all kinds of TIs/TSCs and <b>Fermi</b> <b>surfaces</b> by Dirac matrices, which is actually a physical interpretation of the Atiyah-Bott-Shapiro construction as a mathematical theory, and provides us a rigorous proof of our general index theorem. We also provide applications of our theory and its connections to nonlinear sigma models of disordered systems. The last chapter of this thesis may be regarded as a collection of applications of the boundary-bulk correspondence described by the general index theorem for spatially one-dimensional systems. Specifically one-dimensional superconductor models in the other three nontrivial cases are constructed as generalizations of the Kitaev’s model that is one of four nontrivial cases, and every model is solved in detail by methods similar to that provided by Kitaev. Then we analyze each model in the framework of the general index theorem, focusing on the topological properties of Majorana zero-modes with codimension zero at the ends of these models under the open boundary condition. The possible applications of these models to universal quantum manipulations are also discussed. published_or_final_versionPhysicsDoctoralDoctor of Philosoph...|$|R

However, hole <b>Fermi</b> <b>surfaces</b> of yz and zx orbital character centered at the Γ point of the two-dimensional Brillouin zone are smaller than those predicted by the calculation while the other hole <b>Fermi</b> <b>surfaces</b> of xy orbital character is much larger.
