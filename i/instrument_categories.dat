30|$|Instrument {{recognition}} {{is a typical}} supervised classification task. First, meaningful features need to be extracted, and second, a classification model is learned which maps the feature space to the <b>instrument</b> <b>categories.</b> Although one could assume the same predominant instrument during one song, we do not use the information about previous tones, since we want to use instrument recognition as an indicator for correctly perceived timbre. We think this is best characterized by tone-wise classification without using additional knowledge. Hence, also here, the auditory output of each song is separated into temporal segments defined by the individual tones of the predominant instrument, and for each segment—corresponding to one melody tone—features are extracted separately.|$|E

40|$|M. Comm. The {{debate around}} the {{usefulness}} of fair value {{as a basis for}} measuring financial instruments has become increasingly topical and, in recent times, has attracted the attention of various market participants {{as a result of the}} global credit crisis which developed during 2007. The qualitative characteristics of relevance and reliability are central to any analysis regarding {{the usefulness of}} fair value as a financial instrument measurement basis. This study therefore investigates the relevance and reliability of the fair value measurements disclosed by the four largest South African banks in their 2008 annual financial statements in order to determine whether fair value is the most useful basis for measuring the majority of the financial instruments of South African banks. The financial <b>instrument</b> <b>categories</b> and fair value hierarchy defined in International Financial Reporting Standards (IFRS) are used to perform a content analysis on the 2008 annual financial statements of the banks included in the study, in order to conclude on the relevance and reliability, respectively, of the financial instrument fair values provided. Collectively, an analysis of the financial <b>instrument</b> <b>categories</b> applied and an investigation of the differences between the fair values and carrying values of financial instruments not measured at fair value suggest that fair value is not the most relevant basis for measuring the majority of the financial assets of all of the banks included in the study, and is also not the most relevant basis for measuring the majority of the financial liabilities of three of the four banks included in the study. Based on their fair value hierarchy classification, the fair values of the majority of both the financial assets and financial liabilities of the banks included in the study were not found to be reliable. Fair value was therefore not found to be the most useful basis for measuring the majority of the financial instruments of three of the four banks surveyed, while the findings for the fourth bank were inconclusive in this respect.

40|$|Policy {{fields are}} usually defined by {{conventional}} usage {{rather than by}} systematic analysis. This paper experiments with a methodology of boundary analysis that builds inductively through the aggregation of "topics" and policy instruments. Using the case of shipping policy, we develop a list of 473 topics drawn from several bibliographical and policy sources. These are then aggregated into 135 categories with accompanying policy instruments. While the methodology has obvious limitations, the experiment and case study demonstrate {{that it is possible}} to systematically estimate the complete possible contents of a policy field. The approach shows sufficient promise to warrant refinements and broader applications to a wide variety of estimation problems. It also makes a modest contribution to the study of policy instruments, which has tended to get stuck at the "classification" stage without much detailed empirical analysis of how and when <b>instrument</b> <b>categories</b> actually apply. ...|$|E

40|$|Eco-innovation {{globally}} {{emerged as}} an effort to implement sustainable development. States and firms established and implemented policies and strategies for eco-innovation as one route to achieving sustainable development. Eco-innovation has been facilitated in developed countries, specifically OECD members and European countries, through action plans. Recently, eco-innovation policies have emerged in developing countries. Thus, this study analyzes eco-innovation policies in Asian countries. Policies related to eco-innovation in 17 Asian countries were investigated using policy <b>instrument</b> <b>categories.</b> National policies for eco-innovation were interpreted and compared with development stage classifications. The results indicate that there are similar and different policy approaches to eco-innovation in Asian countries. Given the balance between a technology push (supply side) and a market pull (demand side) in policy instruments for eco-innovation, 17 countries were identified by four categories: leaders, followers, loungers, and laggards. The results provide insight for designing national strategies for eco-innovation in Asia’s developing countries.

40|$|We use {{financial}} accounts data at sector level to construct financial networks for individual euro area countries. We then connect the country-level networks to one large 2 ̆ 01 cMacro Network 2 ̆ 01 d, using information on cross-border linkages between the national banking sectors. We then evaluate {{the features of}} the resulting framework using various network statistics. Shock simulations reveal that the structural features of the bilateral linkages are a key determinant of the losses that may be generated when the shocks propagate in the system. The network structures evolve over time, showing increasing interconnectedness in different <b>instrument</b> <b>categories</b> before the financial crisis hit in 2007, and a sharp retrenchment from bilateral exposures after the crisis started. This reflects the surge in counterparty risk and the de-leveraging processes which were triggered by the initial asset price losses and were further amplified by the economic downturn. As a consequence, there was a marked deterioration in financial integration both within economies and across countries in the euro area. Nonetheless, our analysis suggests that the risk of contagion is not reduced, while a more diversified portfolio of cross-border exposures might mitigate shocks effects...|$|E

40|$|Physiological {{evidence}} suggests that sound onset detection in the auditory system may be performed by specialized neurons {{as early as the}} cochlear nucleus. Psychoacoustic evidence shows that the sound onset can be important for the recognition of musical sounds. Here the sound onset is used in isolation to form tone descriptors for a musical instrument classification task. The task involves 2085 isolated musical tones from the McGill dataset across five <b>instrument</b> <b>categories.</b> A neurally inspired tone descriptor is created using a model of the auditory system's response to sound onset. A gammatone filterbank and spiking onset detectors, built from dynamic synapses and leaky integrate-and-fire neurons, create parallel spike trains that emphasize the sound onset. These are coded as a descriptor called the onset fingerprint. Classification uses a time-domain neural network, the echo state network. Reference strategies, based upon mel-frequency cepstral coefficients, evaluated either over the whole tone or only during the sound onset, provide context to the method. Classification success rates for the neurally-inspired method are around 75 %. The cepstral methods perform between 73 % and 76 %. Further testing with tones from the Iowa MIS collection shows that the neurally inspired method is considerably more robust when tested with data from an unrelated dataset...|$|E
40|$|The {{ability to}} {{automatically}} identify the musical instruments occurring in a recorded {{piece of music}} has important uses for various music-related applications. This paper examines the case of instrument classification where the raw data consists of musical phrases performed on digital instruments from eight instrument families. We compare the use of extracted features from a continuous sample of approximately one second, {{to the use of}} a systematic segmentation of the audio on note boundaries and using multiple, aligned note samples as input to classifiers. The accuracy of the segmented approach was greater than the one of the unsegmented approach. The best method was using a two-tiered hierarchical method which performed slightly better than the single-tiered flat approach. The best performing instrument category was woodwind, with an accuracy of 94 % for the segmented approach, using the Bayesian network classifier. Distinguishing different types of pianos was difficult for all classifiers, with the segmented approach yielding an accuracy of 56 %. For humans, broadly similar results were found, in that pianos were difficult to distinguish, along with woodwind and solo string instruments. However there was no symmetry between human comparisons of identical instruments and different instruments, with half of the broad <b>instrument</b> <b>categories</b> having widely different accuracies for the two cases. 1...|$|E
40|$|A {{family of}} science {{enabling}} radiation hard Application Specific Integrated Circuits (ASICs), Front End Electronics (FEEs) and Event Processing Systems, with flight heritage on many NASA missions, is presented. These technologies {{play an important}} role in the miniaturization of instruments -and spacecraft systems- at the same time increasing performance and reducing power. The technologies target time of flight, position sensing, and energy measurements as well as standard housekeeping and telemetry functions for particle and fields instruments, but find applications in other <b>instrument</b> <b>categories</b> too. More specifically the technologies include: the TOF chip, 1 D and 2 D Delay Lines with MCP detectors, for high precision fast and low power time of flight and position sensing; the Energy chip for multichannel SSD readout with time over threshold and standard voltage read out for TDC and ADC digitization; Fast multi channel read out chip with commandable thresholds; the TRIO chip for multiplexed ADC and housekeeping etc. It should be mentioned that the ASICs include basic trigger capabilities to enable random event processing in a heavy background of penetrators and UV foreground. Typical instruments include time of flight versus energy and look angle particle analyzers such as: plasma composition, energetic particle, neutral atom imaging as well as fast plasma and deltaE/E ion/electron telescopes. Flight missions include: Cassini/LEMMS, IMAGE/HENA, MESSENGER/EPPS/MLA/X-ray/MLA, STEREO, PLUTO-NH/PEPSSI/LORI, IBEX-Lo, JUNO/JEDI, RBSP/RBSPICE, MMS/HPCA/EPD, SO/SIS.
