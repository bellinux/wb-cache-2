50|$|The curie is {{a unit of}} {{radioactivity}} (3.7 × 1010 decays {{per second}} or 37 <b>gigabecquerels)</b> originally {{named in honor of}} Curie by the Radiology Congress in 1910, after his death. Subsequently, there has been some controversy over whether the naming was in honor of Pierre, Marie, or both.|$|R
30|$|The {{specific}} radioactivity [SRA] of {{the product}} {{was measured by the}} same analytical HPLC method for quality control. SRA was calibrated for UV absorbance (λ = 214 nm) response per mass of ligand and calculated as the radioactivity of the radioligand (in <b>gigabecquerels)</b> divided by the amount of the associated carrier substance (in micromoles). Each sample was analyzed three times and compared to a reference standard analyzed three times.|$|R
5000|$|Like any SI unit, Bq can be prefixed; {{commonly}} used multiples are kBq (kilobecquerel, 103 Bq), MBq (megabecquerel, 106 Bq, equivalent to 1 rutherford), GBq (<b>gigabecquerel,</b> 109 Bq), TBq (terabecquerel, 1012 Bq), and PBq (petabecquerel, 1015 Bq). For practical applications, 1 Bq {{is a small}} unit; therefore, the prefixes are common. For example, the roughly 0.0169 g of potassium-40 present in a typical human body produces approximately 4,400 disintegrations per second or 4.4 kBq of activity. The global inventory of carbon-14 {{is estimated to be}} [...] (8.5 EBq, 8.5 exabecquerel). The nuclear explosion in Hiroshima (An explosion of [...] ) is estimated to have produced [...] (8 YBq, 8 yottabecquerel).|$|E
40|$|About 50 % of the 1. 4 GeV CERN (European Organization for Nuclear Research, www. cern. ch) protons {{are sent}} onto targets to produce {{radioactive}} beams by online mass separation at the Isotope Separator Online Device (ISOLDE) facility, {{for a wide}} range of studies in fundamental and applied physics. CERN-MEDICIS is a spin-off dedicated to R&D in life sciences and medical applications. It is located in an extension of the Class A building presently under construction. It will comprise laboratories to receive the irradiated targets from a new station located at the dump position behind the ISOLDE production targets. An increasing range of innovative isotopes will thus progressively become accessible from the start-up of the facility in 2015 onward; for fundamental studies in cancer research, for new imaging and therapy protocols in cell and animal models and for pre-clinical trials, possibly extended to specific early phase clinical studies up to Phase I trials. Five hundred megabecquerel isotope batches purified by electromagnetic mass separation combined with chemical methods will be collected on a weekly basis. A possible future upgrade with <b>gigabecquerel</b> pharmaceutical-grade i. e., current good manufacturing practices (cGMP) batch production capabilities is finally presented...|$|E
40|$|Radiolabeled compounds, cis-diammine-(1, 1 -cyclobutanedicarboxylato) - 193 mPt(II) (carboplatin) and dipyrrolidinedithiocarbamato- 212 Pb(II) (Pb(PDC) 2) were {{synthesized}} in microscale quantities. High performance {{liquid chromatography}} (HPLC) techniques were employed {{as both a}} synthetic tool and mode of product analysis. The specific activities of the purified radiochemicals were in the <b>gigabecquerel</b> per mg range. This was adequate for radiobiological experiments and is several orders of magnitude higher than that required for tracer studies. The radionuclide 193 mPt with 4. 3 day half-life emits numerous low energy Auger electrons {{by virtue of its}} 3 -step isomeric decay essentially by internal conversion. The yields and energies of the electrons were calculated using Monte Carlo methods. This radionuclide was produced by the 192 Pt(n,γ) 193 mPt reaction. Other avenues of production, 192 Os(α, 3 n) 193 mPt, were also considered. The β emitting 212 Pb, which decays to α particle emitting daughters, was isolated from a 226 Ra generator. The clonogenic survival of Chinese hamster V 79 cells was investigated using both radiolabeled and nonradiolabeled forms of the compounds. The effects of the two types of ionizing radiation (Auger electrons and α particles), kinetics of cellular uptake and retention, and subcellular distribution of these compounds were studied. The dosimetry calculations were performed using the radiation spectra, biokinetics, and Medical Internal Radiation Dose (MIRD) formalism. The mean lethal values of dose (D 37) for the radiolabeled carboplatin and 212 Pb(PDC) 2 were 0. 453 grays and 0. 85 grays, respectively. The values of relative biological effectiveness (RBE) were estimated to be about 8. 8 for radiolabeled carboplatin and 4. 6 (2. 4 with recoil of the daughter nuclei included) for radiolabeled 212 Pb(PDC) 2. The results confirm the inadequacy of the current methods of dose calculation (MIRD) and International Commission on Radiation Units and Measurements (ICRU) and point to the potential usefulness of 193 mPt-carboplatin in chemo-Auger combination therapy of cancer. ...|$|E

A milligram (5 curies) of 210Po emits about as many alpha particles per second as 5 grams of 226Ra. A few curies (1 curie equals 37 <b>gigabecquerels,</b> 1 Ci = 37 GBq) of 210Po emit a blue glow which is caused by ionisation of the surrounding air.|$|R

5000|$|South-Eastern part of {{the country}} {{contaminated}} with fallout from 1986 accident at Chernobyl Nuclear Power Plant, Ukraine, receiving about 60% of total fallout. Vast amounts of territory in Homyel and Mahilyow voblasts rendered uninhabitable. Roughly 7000 km2 of soil were contaminated by caesium-137 to levels greater than 15 curies (550 <b>gigabecquerels)</b> per square kilometer, i.e., taken from human usage for indefinite time. In 1996 the areas contaminated with over 1 Ci/km² (37 GBq/km²) of caesium-137 constituted about 21% of the total territory (only 1% decrease compared to 1986), and in 2002 over 1.5 million people still lived in this area.|$|R
50|$|Astatine {{was first}} {{produced}} by bombarding bismuth-209 with energetic alpha particles, {{and this is}} still the major route used to create the relatively long-lived isotopes astatine-209 through astatine-211. Astatine is only produced in minuscule quantities, with modern techniques allowing production runs of up to 6.6 <b>gigabecquerels</b> (about 86 nanograms or 2.47 × 1014 atoms). Synthesis of greater quantities of astatine using this method is constrained by the limited availability of suitable cyclotrons {{and the prospect of}} melting the target. Solvent radiolysis due to the cumulative effect of astatine decay is a related problem. With cryogenic technology, microgram quantities of astatine might be able to be generated via proton irradiation of thorium or uranium to yield radon-211, in turn decaying to astatine-211. Contamination with astatine-210 {{is expected to be a}} drawback of this method.|$|R

A few curies (1 curie equals 37 <b>gigabecquerels)</b> of 210Po emit a blue glow caused by excitation of surrounding air. A single gram of 210Po generates 140 watts of power. Because it emits many alpha particles, which are stopped within a very short distance in dense media and release their energy, 210Po {{has been used as}} a lightweight heat source to power thermoelectric cells in artificial satellites; for instance, a 210Po heat source was also in each of the Lunokhod rovers deployed on the surface of the Moon, to keep their internal components warm during the lunar nights. Some anti-static brushes, used for neutralizing static electricity on materials like photographic film, contain a few microcuries of 210Po as a source of charged particles. 210Po is also used in initiators for atomic bombs through the (α,n) reaction with beryllium.|$|R
40|$|The {{refuelling}} and refitting of submarines in the Tamar Estuary {{causes the}} disposal of low-level liquid waste into the lower estuary. This contains up to 800 <b>gigabecquerels</b> (G 8 q) of tritium per year plus an additional aerial discharge of gaseous tritium is released. The actual level of tritiated water disposed per refuelling is in itself not documented. The aim of this project was twofold firstly to quantify the concentration of tritium in the sediments through analysis of pore water, the electrostatically bound fraction and the sediment bound fraction. This {{was to assess the}} levels already available. The second stage was to quantify the potential uptake available within the system if tritium disposal continues. Overall there is a large discrepancy between sites assessed in the Tamar. This can be justified by the geographic location and water flow at sites but does indicate a difference in an order of magnitude from sites just 0. 2 Km apart. The volumes in the sediment are ten times greater than that either electrostatically bound or in the pore water. The dosing experiments gave low K! for tritium using coarse bed sediments however there was significantly measurable uptake, and the maximal volume capable of being taken up onto sediments has not been reached, within the current environmental levels. The future {{for the study of the}} uptake should be to quantify the maximal uptake possible per unit volume and to quantify the volume to be re-released based on a gradient of tritium for understanding of future bed sediment source for the estuary.

40|$|Purpose: In peptide {{receptor}} {{radionuclide therapy}} (PRRT), {{the bone marrow}} (BM) {{is one of the}} dose-limiting organs. The accepted dose limit for BM is 2  Gy, adopted from 131 I treatment. We investigated the incidence and duration of haematological toxicity and its risk factors in patients treated with PRRT with 177 Lu-DOTA 0 -Tyr 3 -octreotate (177 Lu-DOTATATE). Also, absorbed BM dose estimates were evaluated and compared with the accepted 2  Gy dose limit. Methods: The incidence and duration of grade 3 or 4 haematological toxicity (according to CTCAE v 3. 0) and risk factors were analysed. Mean BM dose per unit (<b>gigabecquerels)</b> of administered radioactivity was calculated and the correlations between doses to the BM and haematological risk factors were determined. Results: Haematological toxicity (grade 3 / 4) occurred in 34 (11  %) of 320 patients. In 15 of the 34 patients, this lasted more than 6  months or blood transfusions were required. Risk factors significantly associated with haematological toxicity were: poor renal function, white blood cell (WBC) count < 4. 0 × 109 /l, age over 70  years, extensive tumour mass and high tumour uptake on the OctreoScan. Previous chemotherapy was not associated. The mean BM dose per administered activity in 23 evaluable patients was 67 ± 7  mGy/GBq, resulting in a mean BM dose of 2  Gy in patients who received four cycles of 7. 4  GBq 177 Lu-DOTATATE. Significant correlations between (cumulative) BM dose and platelet and WBC counts were found in a selected group of patients. Conclusion: The incidence of subacute haematological toxicity after PRRT with 177 Lu-DOTATATE is acceptable (11  %). Patients with impaired renal function, low WBC count, extensive tumour mass, high tumour uptake on the OctreoScan and/or advanced age are more likely to develop grade 3 / 4 haematological toxicity. The BM dose limit of 2  Gy, adopted from 131 I, seems not to be valid for PRRT with 177 Lu-DOTATATE...|$|R
