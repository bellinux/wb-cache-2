The diversity, {{biology and}} {{distribution}} of the red algal family Gelidiaceae (Rhodophyta) of South Africa (and related taxa) were investigated, being relatively poorly understood and taxonomically problematic. Prior to this study, 21 species in 6 genera were reported from South Africa Now there are 29 species in 3 genera (though molecular data indicates that there is possibly a new, undescribed genus) of which 16 are <b>Gelidium</b> <b>species,</b> 5 are Pterocladiella species and 8 are Ptilophora species. The phylogenetic relationships and taxonomic status of the genera Beekerella, Ptilophora, Onikusa and Suhria, and various species within Gelidium and Pterocladiella, were reassessed...|$|E
40|$|The {{value of}} any seaweed crop is {{enhanced}} by the name under which the seaweed is sold, for the kind {{and quality of the}} seaweed product is announced with its name. Thus, though chemists may say that the agar from <b>Gelidium</b> <b>species</b> is the same as that from Gracilaria species, industry will pay more for Gelidium than for Gracilaria. (It might be so because the agarose fraction is higher in Gelidium, and agarose commands a higher price on its own.) In the case of the seaweeds that produce the colloid carrageenan, some species form only kappa-carrageenan (which produces a firm gel), others produce only iota- carrageenan (which forms a soft gel), and still others form only lambda-carrageenan (which does not gel). In geographic areas or developing countries where the identity of seaweeds is not known or is uncertain, the economic potential for using this untapped seaweed resource is unrealized. For Japan and China, on the contrary, which have and use many named seaweed species, the financial gain in the world market can be more easily accomplished, since demand for certain colloids currently exceeds supply. One of Chile's major exports is seaweed, sold for extraction of colloids in other countries. We chose to focus on the four economically important seaweeds that have warm-water representatives because the useful temperate algae are fairly well known and do not have taxonomic or nomenclatural problems that approach those in the tropics. The groups we chose are Gelidium, Pterocladia, Gelidiella, Yatabella, Acanthopeltis (treated as one group, the Gelidiales), Gracilaria, Polycavernosa, Eucheuma, and Sargassum...|$|E
40|$|Some {{preliminary}} {{investigations of}} the effects of temperature, light intensity, salinity and to a lesser extent, water movement, were performed under controlled laboratory culture conditions on the subtidal red alga Gelidium capense, with regards to its potential for aquaculture for its use in the agar and paper-making industries. Agar was also extracted from a wild population and its concentration measured. Four temperature conditions {l 0 °C, 15 °C, 20 °c and 25 °C) and three salinities (35 ppt, 18 ppt and 9 ppt) were tested as well as four irradiances (120 - 140 μmol photons m⁻²s⁻¹, 80 - 100 μmol photons m⁻²s⁻¹, 60 - 70 μmol photons m⁻²s⁻¹ and 30 - 50 μmol photons m⁻²s⁻¹). Water movement was achieved either through aeration or using a flask shaker. A combination of full salinity { 35 ppt) and 15 °C temperature with a light intensity of 80 - 100 μmol photons m⁻²s⁻¹ yielded the most optimal growth rates (5. 07 % day⁻¹) while poor growth rates (- 1. 61 % day⁻¹) were observed for the 18 ppt and 9 ppt salinities and the lowest light intensities. Interestingly, G. capense did not thrive at 20 °c or 25 °C and instead discoloured rapidly, showed necrosis within a few days, which is in contrast to the findings of most studies focussed on other species of Gelidium under similar conditions. Slow growth rates were achieved at 10 °c. The mean agar yield measured ten percent (9. 66 % ± 1. 81) of dry algal weight which is {{less than a third of}} the agar yields of some other species of Gelidium and Graci/aria. This suggests that this species may not be as valuable as other <b>Gelidium</b> <b>species</b> in terms of its agar content. It does, however, have high rhizine content and this may lend it to be beneficial in the papermaking industry...|$|E
40|$|In {{this study}} 12 taxa are treated, {{belonging}} to four different genera of Gelidiales (i. e. Gelidiella, Gelidium, Pterocladia, and Porphyroglossum) {{as well as}} one species of Wurdemannia, a genus of unknown affinity. One new <b>species,</b> <b>Gelidium</b> amboniense, and a new forma, Gelidium latifolium forma elongatum, are described. Holotype material of Gelidium bornetii Weber-van Bosse in the Weber-van Bosse collection in Leiden can be synonymized with Gelidiella lubrica (Kützing) Feldmann & Hamel, while the original sample in the herbarium in Copenhagen only contains Gelidium pusillum (Stackhouse) Le Jolis var minusculum Weber-van Bosse. In the key to the genera and species we also include the very similar genus Ceratodictyon Zanardini (= Gelidiopsis Schmitz) ...|$|R
40|$|Abstract. Agar is a {{hydrophilic}} colloid {{formed by}} polysaccharides, whose ability to form reversible gels simply by cooling hot aqueous solutions {{is the most}} important property and can be regarded as the prototype and model for all gelling systems. In this paper the evolution of the gelation process of agar obtained from algae of the <b>species</b> <b>Gelidium</b> robustum, using the photopyroelectric technique is reported. It is shown that thermal effusivity increase when the agar is cooled, reaching a maximum value around 37 °C. The increase in thermal effusivity can be related to the increasing of the bondings in the gel as temperature decreases, reaching the maximum at the gelation point. The decrease of the thermal effusivity at lower temperature could be due to the syneresis process involving a gradual release of water after gelation...|$|R
40|$|A {{study of}} the {{processes}} of decomposition of agar-agar by micro 6 rganisms involves first of all {{a knowledge of the}} chemical nature of the agar. This material is prepared from certain marine algae and, {{due to the fact that}} it is used as a food in the Orient and for medicinal purposes in Europe and America, as well as due to its employment for the preparation of culture media, its chemical nature has received considerable attention. It has been found that the composition of the agar varies with the nature of the plant from which it is obtained. Japanese agar is usually prepared from Gelidium corneum, while other <b>species</b> of <b>Gelidium</b> and <b>species</b> of Gracillaria, Fucus and Eucheuma are also employed in different parts of the world. Although agar contains a considerable amount of ash, themajor part of it consists of one or more hemicelluloses, or carbohydrates which are readily hydrolized by hot dilute mineral acids. The most important constituent of the agar is a galactan, first referred to by Payen as gelose, to which he gave the formula C 6 Hjo 05. Czapek (1913) in summarizing the results of previous investiga-tors, concludes that one-third of the agar consists of galactan. On treatment of agar with nitric acid, mucic and oxalic acids are produced. Pentosans are usually reported to be present in agar but in very small amounts. Fellers (1916) reported the presenc...|$|R
40|$|Several {{accounts}} {{have been}} produced on the seaweeds of the west coast including the Saldanha and Langebaan System, but none has looked at how human activities may have affected the seaweed diversity of Saldanha Bay. The major human activities in the Bay include shipping and mariculture. The major human impacts resulting from these activities are species introductions which often lead {{to a change in}} species composition in an area. Six sites were sampled in various visits in autumn and winter 2012. Two of the sites were natural wave exposed rocky shore sites while the rest were sheltered and man-made. Detailed collections of seaweeds were made. The seaweeds were identiﬁed to species level and preserved either as herbarium specimen or in formalin. Specimens that {{it was not possible to}} identify using morphological features were preserved in silica gel for DNA analysis. Three samples of the red algal genus Gruteloupia, collected from aquaculture systems, which could not be identified using morphological features, were sent to Ghent University where the rbcL gene region was sequenced. Collected species were compared with species lists from previous studies in the same area. The results from this study showed that most of the species collected were west coast species, with a few species with south coast distributions. The numbers of species in the Bay since the study of Day showed an increase from 23 by Day to 58 by Simons' 1960 collection. His 1976 collection reduced to 47. The most species so far recorded are by Schils' 1997 collection with 72. From this study, 69 species were recorded of which 23 are potentially new records. Of these records, two were south coast <b>species</b> <b>Gelidium</b> reptans and Laurencia peninsularis. They were recorded for the first time in the system and they are range extensions. Furthermore, the results provide molecular evidence that two species of Grateloupia have been introduced into Saldanha Bay. Bayesian analysis showed that one of the species was Grateloupia turuturu, a Japanese species which has spread to a number of world regions which culture the Paciﬁc oyster. The other was distinct from other Grateloupias previously recorded in South Africa, and did not match any species in Genbank. The potential vector of introduction for Grateloupia turuturu, importation of the Pacific oyster Crassostreo gigas, is discussed...|$|R
