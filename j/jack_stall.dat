50|$|In {{contrast}} to the qualifying session, the sky was overcast {{and the threat of}} rain ever-present. A lightning start from Ferrari Driver Academy's Charles Leclerc saw him grab first place entering the first turn, while Kevin Jörg fell to fifth. After an exciting opening few laps, the field stagnated, with Leclerc edging away from polesitter Jake Hughes and teammate Nirei Fukuzumi. Further back in the pack, <b>Jack</b> Aitken <b>stalled</b> at the start, while Steijn Schothorst retired with mechanical problems. An intense battle developed between the Koiranen GP drivers, who were fighting for tenth place and the final point. Meanwhile, Leclerc continued to build a gap to Hughes, eventually recording his first GP3 win with a margin of just over six seconds. Hughes held off Fukuzumi for second, with Antonio Fuoco finishing a distant fourth. Behind them were Jörg, Alexander Albon, and Jake Dennis, who had a wild off-track moment early on at the final corner. Óscar Tunjo finished eighth, giving him reverse-grid pole for the Sprint Race, with Nyck de Vries and Ralph Boschung completing the top ten.|$|R

5000|$|Next, the {{telephone}} rings {{and it is}} Jack Hammer's boss. He wants Jack to build the skyscraper quickly. Overhearing this, Woody has a few plans of his own. As Hammer tries to pull a cement-filled wheelbarrow vertically with a rope, Woody cuts the rope with a knife, and Jack Hammer falls into the cement. As he chases Woody, the cement hardens with him inside. Woody frees the foreman, but Hammer insists that he fell in the cement on purpose. The telephone rings again, and the boss advises Hammer to continue with work. Once again Woody <b>stalls</b> <b>Jack's</b> progress by entering the elevator before him, declaring that the elevator only has the capacity for one passenger, and going up without Jack. Hammer then orders the elevator to go down, only to be crushed by it.

5000|$|Outraged {{at their}} actions, Woody {{returns to the}} Del Fuegos bar and {{retrieves}} Dudley's bike, cuts off their bikes' fuel supplies {{in the process and}} fabricates a story to the other Wild Hogs of how he [...] "negotiated" [...] with them to return the bike. When the Del Fuegos hear the Wild Hogs riding back past the bar, they attempt to pursue them, only for the bikes to <b>stall.</b> <b>Jack</b> inadvertently drops his lit cigarette onto the ground, igniting the fuel leaking from the bikes which then causes the bar to explode. Woody, after witnessing the explosion from afar, convinces the others to keep riding. Eventually, the Wild Hogs run out of gas and end up in Madrid, New Mexico, where they stumble into a diner and help themselves to water and beer without first paying for the beer. As a result, the townspeople first mistake them for Del Fuegos. When the Wild Hogs explain their actions, they learn that the Del Fuegos have been terrorizing the town frequently, while the local police force are unable to do anything to protect the town. Although Woody is still antsy about the Del Fuegos, the others convince him to stay in the town overnight. During their stay in the town, Dudley falls in love with Maggie (Marisa Tomei), the diner's owner. While out searching for the Wild Hogs, Jack's closest biker members Red & Murdock spot the group and report their location to Jack. Jack tells the pair not to hurt the Wild Hogs until he gets there, leaving them unable to fight back when Bobby spots and confronts the pair by splashing beer and spraying ketchup and mustard on their clothes before finally laying two uppercuts to them. The Wild Hogs are hailed as heroes amongst the town's residents and celebrate well into the night with the townspeople.|$|R
