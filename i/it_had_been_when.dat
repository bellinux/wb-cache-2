In 1910 Atlantic Boulevard opened between South Jacksonville and the Jacksonville Beaches, further cementing South Jacksonville's place as a hub for car and ferry traffic. By 1917 the town's population was ten times what <b>it</b> <b>had</b> <b>been</b> <b>when</b> it was incorporated, so local leaders planned the original Acosta Bridge, connecting Jacksonville and South Jacksonville by road for the first time.|$|E

25|$|A {{shift in}} {{preferences}} at the microeconomic level, {{caused by an}} income effect can change the make-up of {{the consumer price index}} to include proportionately more expenditure on services. This alone may shift the consumer price index, and might make the non-trade sector look relatively less productive than <b>it</b> <b>had</b> <b>been</b> <b>when</b> demand was lower; if service quality (rather than quantity) follows diminishing returns to labour input, a general demand for a higher service quality automatically produces a reduction in per-capita productivity.|$|E

Around that time the two agencies also announced plans, and received federal funding, for a redone exit7 that would allow traffic to go directly between I-84 and the Thruway instead of using a short stretch of NY300, which by then was more heavily developed than <b>it</b> <b>had</b> <b>been</b> <b>when</b> the interstates were first built.

25|$|Bryansk Front {{was under}} the command of Gen. Andrey Yeryomenko. During the balance of August and most of September he ordered his forces, {{including}} the relatively fresh 50th Army, into repeated clashes with the German XLVII Motorized Corps over its possession of a bridgehead over the Desna anchored on the towns of Pochep and Pogar. This was also an attempt to disrupt 2nd Panzer Army as it prepared to strike southwards towards Kiev. These operations had little effect on the German forces and also severely weakened the Front just as it was to face its greatest test. As of Sept. 30, strength returns for 50th Army showed 61,503 personnel, 780 guns and mortars (of which 149 were antitank guns), but only 7 tanks. It was still one of the stronger armies before Moscow, but not so strong as <b>it</b> <b>had</b> <b>been</b> <b>when</b> formed.|$|E

500|$|Soon after {{becoming}} Permanent Secretary Schuster {{had decided that}} his aim should be {{to make sure that}} the entire court system was under the control of his office, rather than partially under his control and partially under the control of HM Treasury as <b>it</b> <b>had</b> <b>been</b> <b>when</b> he started. The 1931 Royal Commission on the Civil Service recommended that all Civil Service departments take a more business-like approach to their work, and spurred Schuster into making a further attempt to reorganise and reform the Lord Chancellor's Office. As such he persuaded Sankey to set up a Departmental Committee on the Business of the Courts, with Lord Hanworth (one of Schuster's friends) chairing the committee and Schuster himself sitting as a member. As he had under Lord Birkenhead Schuster attempted to reform the County Courts. Hee partially succeeded in doing when his recommendations were included in the Administration of Justice [...] Act 1934 which sent appeals from the county courts straight to the Court of Appeal rather than the Divisional Courts. He also attempted to have the number of jury trials in civil cases reduced, something which Hanworth supported but which was blocked by the King's Bench Division.|$|E

2500|$|On the one hand, Van Helmont was {{a disciple}} of Paracelsus (though he scornfully repudiated his errors {{as well as}} those of most other {{contemporary}} authorities), a mystic and alchemist. On the other hand, he engaged in the new learning based on experimentation that was producing men like William Harvey, Galileo Galilei and Francis Bacon. Van Helmont was a careful observer of nature; it can be inferred that from his analysis of data gathered in his experiments suggested he had a concept of the conservation of mass. He performed an experiment to determine where plants get their mass. He grew a willow tree and measured the amount of soil, the weight of the tree and the water he added. After five years the plant had gained about 164lbs (74kg). [...] Since the amount of soil was basically the same as <b>it</b> <b>had</b> <b>been</b> <b>when</b> he started his experiment (it lost only 57 grams), he deduced that the tree's weight gain had come from water. Since it had received nothing but water and the soil weighed practically the same as at the beginning, he argued that the increased weight of wood, bark and roots had been formed from water.|$|E
2500|$|At {{the end of}} the 13th {{century the}} Church of the East still {{extended}} across Asia to China.

[...] During their journey from China to Baghdad in 1279, Yahballaha and Bar Sawma were offered hospitality by an unnamed bishop of Tus in northeastern Persia, confirming that there was still a Christian community in Khorasan, however reduced. [...] India had a metropolitan named Yaqob {{at the beginning of the}} 14th century, mentioned together with the patriarch Yahballaha 'the fifth (sic), the Turk' in a colophon of 1301. [...] In the 1320s Yahballaha's biographer praised the progress made by the Church of the East in converting the 'Indians, Chinese and Turks', without suggesting that this achievement was under threat. [...] In 1348 Amr listed twenty-seven metropolitan provinces stretching from Jerusalem to China, and although his list may be anachronistic in several respects, he was surely accurate in portraying a church whose horizons still stretched far beyond Kurdistan. [...] The provincial structure of the church in 1318 was much the same as <b>it</b> <b>had</b> <b>been</b> <b>when</b> it was established in 410 at the synod of Isaac, and many of the 14th-century dioceses had existed, though perhaps under a different name, nine hundred years earlier.|$|E
