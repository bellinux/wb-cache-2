500|$|Kinsler {{was then}} drafted {{a third time}} by the Texas Rangers in the 17th round (496th overall) in 2003 as a shortstop {{at the urging of}} area scout Mike Grouse. Grouse liked Kinsler's tools, makeup, desire, and gritty approach. In Grouse's {{scouting}} report, he wrote that Kinsler had a great feel for the game, athleticism, solid defensive skills, intensity, and leadership qualities. Grouse knew that Kinsler was probably being underrated by rival scouts who did not know that Kinsler had played with a foot stress fracture while at Missouri, [...] "so [...] really couldn't run like I knew he could. I'd seen him in Wichita the year before, so I knew he was a plus runner. Most people ... didn't know that, so they probably downgraded him. But I knew it, and I wasn't telling anybody." [...] Kinsler, for his part, says: [...] "I thought I was a lot better than a 17th round pick. I thought <b>I</b> <b>belonged</b> in the top 10 rounds." [...] Kinsler nonetheless agreed to sign with the Rangers on his 21st birthday, for $30,000.|$|E
500|$|Still {{hoping to}} work on Cheers, Mirkin sent a spec script of an episode of Taxi to Cheers writers Ken Levine and David Isaacs. The two {{approved}} and offered Mirkin a freelance job writing one of the final nine episodes of the show's first season, pending their commissioning by NBC. The episodes were commissioned, but Mirkin's agent rejected the Cheers job without telling his client, failing to see why Mirkin would want {{to work on}} {{what was then the}} lowest-rated comedy on television. Mirkin sacked the agent and signed on with Robb Rothman. Rothman knew Dan Wilcox, the executive producer of Newhart, which like Cheers was more character-focused. Rothman persuaded Wilcox to hire Mirkin. Mirkin wrote a freelance script and in 1984 beat seven other writers to a staff position on the series. He served as a writer and supervising story editor, before being promoted to executive producer and showrunner after one and a half years. Mirkin [...] "felt [...] was where <b>I</b> <b>belonged.</b> I'd finally come to a place in my life where everything I'd ever wanted had come together." [...] In 1987, he received a Primetime Emmy Award nomination for Outstanding Writing for a Comedy Series for Newhart. It was the first nomination the show had received in that category and for the first episode Mirkin wrote as the series' showrunner. Mirkin directed several of the Newhart episodes he wrote because he saw directing as [...] "a means of protecting the writing". A philosophy he carried into his later work, Mirkin felt that [...] "being the head writer... was not enough; you had to see the material through its execution– especially the weirder stuff. You had to be right there to make sure every sick idea didn't lose any disturbing nuance." [...] Mirkin left Newhart in 1988, desiring to work on a single-camera sitcom.|$|E

2500|$|In 2005, Mimi Pollak's estate {{released}} 60 letters Garbo {{had written}} her in their long correspondence. Several letters suggest {{she may have}} had romantic feelings for Pollak for many years. After learning of Pollak's pregnancy in 1930, for example, Garbo wrote [...] "We cannot help our nature, as God has created it. But I have always thought you and <b>I</b> <b>belonged</b> together". [...] In 1975, she wrote a poem {{about not being able}} to touch the hand of her friend with whom she might have been walking through life.|$|E
2500|$|DeLillo {{returned}} with what {{would turn out}} to be his final novel of the decade with Falling Man in May 2007. The novel concerned the impact on one family of the 9/11 terrorist attacks on the World Trade Center in New York, [...] "an intimate story which is encompassed by a global event." [...] According to a 2007 interview in Die Zeit, DeLillo claims that originally he [...] "didn't ever want to write a novel about 9/11" [...] and [...] "had an idea for a different book" [...] which he had [...] "been working on for half a year" [...] in 2004 when he came up with an idea for the novel, beginning work on the novel following the re-election of George W. Bush that November. Although highly anticipated and eagerly awaited by critics, who felt that DeLillo was one of the contemporary writers best equipped to tackle the events of 9/11 in novelistic form, the novel met with a mixed critical reception and garnered no major literary awards or nominations. DeLillo, however, remained unconcerned by this relative lack of critical acclaim, remarking in 2010, [...] "In the 1970s, when I started writing novels, I was a figure in the margins, and that’s where <b>I</b> <b>belonged.</b> If I’m headed back that way, that’s fine with me, because that’s always where I felt <b>I</b> <b>belonged.</b> Things changed for me in the 1980s and 1990s, but I’ve always preferred to be somewhere in the corner of a room, observing." ...|$|E
2500|$|In 1940 Britten {{composed}} Seven Sonnets of Michelangelo, {{the first}} of many song cycles for Pears. The composer and biographer David Matthews described the cycle as Britten's [...] "declaration of love for Peter". The partners made a private recording of the work in New York shortly after it was completed, but the public premiere was not for a further two years. In 1941, spurred by a magazine article by E M Forster about the Suffolk poet George Crabbe, Pears bought Britten a copy of Crabbe's collection of narrative poems The Borough. He suggested to Britten that the section about the fisherman Peter Grimes would make a good subject for an opera. Britten agreed, and, a Suffolk man himself, was struck with a deep nostalgia by the poem. He later said, [...] "I suddenly realised where <b>I</b> <b>belonged</b> and what I lacked". He and Pears began to plan their return to England. They made the perilous Atlantic crossing in April 1942.|$|E

2500|$|In 1897, Ward {{enrolled}} in the medical school at the University of Pennsylvania. [...] Ward received his M.D. from Penn in 1899. [...] While at Penn, {{he was a member}} of Psi Upsilon and the H.C. Wood Medical Society. [...] As he had done at Michigan, Ward followed in the footsteps of William [...] "Jerry" [...] McCauley. Both were Princeton football players who coached football at Michigan and received their medical degrees at Penn. [...] Ward later wrote, [...] "At Pennsylvania, too, 'Jerry' McCauley had been my forerunner, and he it was who took me around to see Dr. Joe upon the very day of my arrival in Philadelphia, and from that time until I left Philadelphia, in March, 1902, after a winter's special training with him, he was my friend and instructor; and if I ever make a name for myself in the domain of surgery it is his training that I have to thank for it. [...] Many a morning would find me standing beside his operating table instead of on the benches of the lecture room where <b>I</b> <b>belonged,</b> but I have never repented my choice." ...|$|E
2500|$|When she was 15, {{her parents}} separated, and her mother, {{supportive}} of her daughter's desire to act, moved {{with her to}} Los Angeles, where they lived out of their car until Swank's mother saved enough money to rent an apartment. Swank has called her mother the inspiration for her acting career and her life. In California, Swank enrolled in South Pasadena High School, later dropping out because of her ADHD and lack of interest. She described her time at South Pasadena High School, [...] "I felt like such an outsider. I didn't feel like I fit in. I didn't belong in any way. I didn't even feel like the teachers wanted me there. I just felt like I wasn't seen or understood." [...] She explained that she became an actor because she felt an outsider, [...] "As a kid I felt that <b>I</b> <b>belonged</b> only when I read a book or saw a movie, and could get involved with a character. It was natural that I became an actor because I longed {{so much to be}} those other people, or at least to play them." ...|$|E
2500|$|In 2002, Torre and {{his wife}} Ali {{established}} the Joe Torre Safe at Home Foundation. In October 2007 the Foundation partnered with the Union City, New Jersey Board of Education and the North Hudson Community Action Corporation (NHCAC) to establish the Foundation's Margaret Place initiative at Union City, New Jersey's José Martí Middle School, with a $325,000 donation from Verizon. It continues to receive yearly funding from that company of up to $65,000. The Foundation's mission is to educate and prevent domestic violence. Margaret's Place is named after Torre's mother, who {{was a victim of}} verbal and physical abuse at the hands of Torre's New York City Police officer father when Torre was a child. Torre describes his father as a [...] "bully", and while Torre himself was not a target of his father's violence, he has related that he never felt safe at home, and grew up in fear for his mother, saying, [...] "I always felt responsible for it. I never thought <b>I</b> <b>belonged</b> anywhere. I never felt safe except on the ball field." [...] Margaret's Place is a comprehensive program that provides students with a safe room in school where they can meet with a professional counselor trained in domestic violence intervention and prevention in order to address the student's home situation and educate them to understand domestic violence's impact on the community. The children are also given the opportunity to read, play games or talk about their experience with others. The program, which is administered by health care professionals from North Hudson Community Action Corp, also includes an anti-violence campaign within the school, and training for teachers and counselors. It has grown to 11 sites in the region, though Union City's is the only such program in New Jersey.|$|E
