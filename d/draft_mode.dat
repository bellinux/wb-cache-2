40|$|We {{investigate}} {{the relationship between}} spectral solar irradiance (SSI) and ozone in the tropical upper stratosphere. We find that solar cycle (SC) changes in ozone can be well approximated by considering the ozone response to SSI changes in a small number individual wavelength bands between 176 and 310 nm, operating independently of each other. Additionally, {{we find that the}} ozone varies approximately linearly with changes in the SSI. Using these facts, we present a Bayesian formalism for inferring SC SSI changes and uncertainties from measured SC ozone profiles. Bayesian inference is a powerful, mathematically self-consistent method of considering both the uncertainties of the data and additional external information to provide the best estimate of parameters being estimated. Using this method, we show that, given measurement uncertainties in both ozone and SSI datasets, it is not currently possible to distinguish between observed or modelled SSI datasets using available estimates of ozone change profiles, although this might be possible by the inclusion of other external constraints. Our methodology has the potential, using wider datasets, to provide better understanding of both variations in SSI and the atmospheric response.

We create a thermal inkjet (TIJ) printhead using an {{application-specific integrated circuit}} system and bulk micromachining technology (microelectromechanical systems). We design inkjet printhead chips with a new structure and investigate their properties. For the new structure, the integration of complementary metal-oxide-semiconductors (MOSs) and enhancement-mode devices, as well as power switches and a TIJ heater transducer, enables logic functions to be executed on-chip. This capability {{is used in the}} proposed design to address individual jets with even fewer input lines than in matrix addressing. A high number of jets (at least 896) can be addressed with only 11 input lines. E 1 (Enable 1) and E 2 (Enable 2) are set up dependently, and they have the ability to reverse their signals in relation to each other (i. e., if E 1 is disabled, E 2 is enabled and vice versa). The E 1 and E 2 signals each service 448 jets. If one of the MOSs is turned on, then it corresponds to a power line with a similar function. If an addressing gate terminal of the other MOS has a discharge action, then we can control a different heater to generate heating bubbles in the jet inks. The operating frequency for addressing these measurements is 18 kHz in normal mode, 26 kHz in <b>draft</b> <b>mode,</b> and 16 kHz in best mode...|$|E
40|$|M. Ing. (Engineering Management) Abstract: AEROSUD Aviation is a South African based {{manufacturer}} of aircraft components and assemblies. The company’s customer base includes various international Original Equipment Manufacturers (OEMs). The organisation adopts the Theory of Constraints (ToC) manufacturing methodology and management {{focus is placed}} on process improvements across {{all aspects of the}} business. The proprietary Manufacturing Execution System (MES) of AEROSUD is responsible for prioritisation of the Work In Process (WIP) complement in each manufacturing cell. In order to achieve a short term objective of achieving weekly customer demand, the system is reliant on human heuristic manipulation of production priorities as defined by a <b>drafted</b> <b>Mode</b> Of Operation (MOO). A combination of systems engineering and ToC principles is used to develop and constrain a multi-method simulation model, aimed at identifying and analysing the effects of the current prioritisation MOO in relation to a proposed MOO for a defined WIP complement. The current MOO is defined as the baseline in the comparative analysis. The model allows for execution of multi-case scenarios under a set of controlled ToC related parameters. The analysis involves establishment of the relative effectiveness of each MOO through comparison. The multi-method model is developed {{with the use of the}} Anylogic modelling platform. The results provide insights into optimising the facility through proposal of the most effective prioritisation MOO. Selection of an MOO that supports ToC principles allows for significant lead time reduction through a constrained manufacturing flow line. This improves organisational agility as the short term objective of satisfying customer demand is achieved through the improvement in ToC performance...|$|R

40|$|In {{this work}} we {{determine}} key model parameters for rapidly intensifying Hurricane Guillermo (1997) using the Ensemble Kalman Filter (EnKF). The {{approach is to}} utilize the EnKF {{as a tool to}} only estimate the parameter values of the model for a particular data set. The assimilation is performed using dual-Doppler radar observations obtained during the period of rapid intensification of Hurricane Guillermo. A unique aspect of Guillermo was that during the period of radar observations strong convective bursts, attributable to wind shear, formed primarily within the eastern semicircle of the eyewall. To reproduce this observed structure within a hurricane model, background wind shear of some magnitude must be specified; as well as turbulence and surface parameters appropriately specified so that the impact of the shear on the simulated hurricane vortex can be realized. To identify the complex nonlinear interactions induced by changes in these parameters, an ensemble of model simulations have been conducted in which individual members were formulated by sampling the parameters within a certain range via a Latin hypercube approach. The ensemble and the data, derived latent heat and horizontal winds from the dual-Doppler radar observations, are utilized in the EnKF to obtain varying estimates of the model parameters. The parameters are estimated at each time instance, and a final parameter value is obtained by computing the average over time. Individual simulations were conducted using the estimates, with the simulation using latent heat parameter estimates producing the lowest overall model forecast error.

40|$|We {{present a}} revised and {{extended}} total and spectral solar irradiance (SSI) reconstruction, {{which includes a}} wavelength-dependent uncertainty estimate, spanning the last three solar cycles using the SATIRE-S model. The SSI reconstruction covers wavelengths between 115 and 160, 000 nm and all dates between August 1974 and October 2009. This represents the first full-wavelength SATIRE-S reconstruction to cover the last three solar cycles without data gaps and with an uncertainty estimate. SATIRE-S is compared with the NRLSSI model and SORCE/SOLSTICE ultraviolet (UV) observations. SATIRE-S displays similar cycle behaviour to NRLSSI for wavelengths below 242 nm and almost twice the variability between 242 and 310 nm. During the decline of last solar cycle, between 2003 and 2008, SSI from SORCE/SOLSTICE version 12 and 10 typically displays {{more than three times}} the variability of SATIRE-S between 200 and 300 nm. All three datasets are used to model changes in stratospheric ozone within a 2 D atmospheric model for a decline from high solar activity to solar minimum. The different flux changes result in different modelled ozone trends. Using NRLSSI leads to a decline in mesospheric ozone, while SATIRE-S and SORCE/SOLSTICE result in an increase. Recent publications have highlighted increases in mesospheric ozone when considering version 10 SORCE/SOLSTICE irradiances. The recalibrated SORCE/SOLSTICE version 12 irradiances result in a much smaller mesospheric ozone response than when using version 10 and now similar in magnitude to SATIRE-S. This shows that current knowledge of variations in spectral irradiance is not sufficient to warrant robust conclusions concerning the impact of solar variability on the atmosphere and climate.
