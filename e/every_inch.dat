5|$|On March 11 Thieu {{convened a}} meeting with Prime Minister Trần Thiện Khiêm, Chief of the ARVN General Staff General Cao Văn Viên, and Lieutenant General Dang Van Quang to discuss the {{military}} situation in the northern provinces of South Vietnam. In this meeting, Thieu decided to withdraw {{what was left of}} his army from the northern provinces to defend the Mekong region, where most of the nation’s population and vital economic resources were located. Thieu justified his decision on the basis that the South Vietnamese military could not defend <b>every</b> <b>inch</b> of South Vietnam’s territory, so the military had to be ‘lightened at the top and heavy at the bottom’.|$|E
5|$|The City was {{essentially}} medieval in its street plan, an overcrowded warren of narrow, winding, cobbled alleys. It had experienced several major fires before 1666, {{the most recent}} in 1632. Building with wood and roofing with thatch had been prohibited for centuries, but these cheap materials continued to be used. The only major stone-built area was the wealthy centre of the City, where the mansions of the merchants and brokers stood on spacious lots, surrounded by an inner ring of overcrowded poorer parishes whose <b>every</b> <b>inch</b> of building space was used to accommodate the rapidly growing population. These parishes contained workplaces, {{many of which were}} fire hazards—foundries, smithies, glaziers—which were theoretically illegal in the City but tolerated in practice.|$|E

25|$|The {{frontage}}: The Jain temple has a fine frontage of carved stone, carved so profusely in such delicate airy tracery that it {{is difficult}} to believe it is stone. We went up a flight of steps and came to a courtyard surrounded by what we call Moorish arches, with colonnades having groined roofs, <b>every</b> <b>inch</b> of which was painted elaborately with graceful arabesques, the effect being rich and soft in the extreme.|$|E
25|$|Not {{only had}} the 35th and 38th Divisions been gutted in the {{fighting}} early in 1915, they were undergoing a change in command. The previous commander for the Iraq Area Command, Colonel Süleyman Askeri Bey, after the defeats of Qurna and Shaiba, had killed himself while recuperating from wounds. His successor was Colonel Nureddin. A veteran of the Balkan Wars, Nureddin was charged by Envers Pasha with defending <b>every</b> <b>inch</b> of the Baghdad vilayet with an eye towards to recapturing Basra.|$|E

25|$|Making {{the baskets}} {{required}} great skill and knowledge in collecting and preparing the needed materials. Materials for weaving baskets {{changed with the}} seasons and years, so did the materials used for the baskets. The Pomo usually covered a basket completely with the vivid red feathers of the pleated woodpecker until the surface resembled the smoothness of the bird itself. With the feathers, 30-50 to <b>every</b> <b>inch,</b> beads were fastened to the basket’s border and hung pendants of polished abalone shell from the basket itself. Pomo women sometimes spent months or years making such gift baskets.|$|E
25|$|Over {{the next}} twenty-two days, the four conspirators fled {{through the small}} streets and little holes that they could find, trying to escape from Guatemala City, but the {{government}} surrounded the city and slowly tightened the perimeter while combing <b>every</b> <b>inch</b> of terrain. The conspirators' families were incarcerated and prosecuted. Others conspirators, brothers Juan and Adolfo Viteri and Francisco Valladares, were arrested when they attempted to flee disguised as women in Guastatoya. Others, like Felipe and Rafael Prado Romaña, tried to flee to El Salvador, but were captured when someone informed on them. The Romaña brothers remained imprisoned until their death. Only the Colombian Rafael Madriñán escaped the country on a bicycle. The mother of the Romaña brothers took the Mexican Ambassador, Federico Camboa, to {{the house where the}} Avila Echeverría brothers and his friends were hiding, who, knowing that they had only days to live, gave him all their valuables and begged him to pass them on to their relatives.|$|E

It consisted of six candles made from 72pennyweights of wax, each [...] high, and of uniform thickness, marked <b>every</b> <b>inch</b> (2.54cm). As these candles burned for about four hours, each mark represented 20minutes. Once lit, the candles were placed in wooden framed glass boxes, to prevent the flame from extinguishing.|$|E

500|$|Although Kennedy was not {{a gifted}} skater, he {{compensated}} with a fierce determination and tireless hard work.

Line-mate Howie Meeker said that while he was a much better skater than Kennedy, [...] Kennedy was a perfect fit into coach Hap Day's coaching style of emphasizing defense, positional hockey and physical play. He brought to the Leafs a classy, humble leadership and the knack for scoring goals when they were most needed. He fought for <b>every</b> <b>inch</b> of ice and was difficult to separate from the puck. He was also known for his agility, stick-handling, playmaking, passing skills and physical toughness.|$|E

Initially the transformations were made to follow the laws of physics, {{but it did not}} look {{exciting}} enough and was changed to be more fluid. Bay rejected a liquid metal surface for the characters' faces, instead going for a [...] "Rubik's Cube" [...] style of modeling. He wanted numerous mechanical pieces visible so the robots would look more interesting, realistic, dynamic and quick, rather than like lumbering beasts. One such decision was to have the wheels stay on the ground for as long as possible, allowing the robots to cruise around as they changed. Bay instructed the animators to observe footage of two martial artists and numerous martial arts films to make the fights look graceful.|$|E
500|$|Critics {{unanimously}} praised Karthi's {{portrayal of}} a careless village ruffian.

His expressions, anger, laughter and anguish are all so realistic that you can feel the fire in him." [...] Rediff called his performance [...] "excellent", and [...] "...one of the top performances of 2007". Karthi received several accolades for his performance, including the Filmfare Award for Best Actor in Tamil.|$|E
