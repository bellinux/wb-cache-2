25|$|Every {{emotional}} response has a behavioral component, an autonomic component, and a hormonal component. The hormonal component includes {{the release of}} epinephrine, an adrenomedullary response that occurs in response to stress and that {{is controlled by the}} sympathetic nervous system. The major emotion studied in relation to epinephrine is fear. In an experiment, subjects who were injected with epinephrine expressed more negative and fewer positive facial expressions to fear films compared to a control group. These subjects also reported a more intense fear from the films and greater mean intensity of negative memories than control subjects. The findings from this study demonstrate that there are learned associations between negative feelings and levels of epinephrine. Overall, the greater amount of epinephrine is positively correlated with an arousal state of negative feelings. These findings can be an effect in part that epinephrine elicits physiological sympathetic responses including an increased heart rate and knee shaking, which {{can be attributed to the}} feeling of fear regardless of the actual level of fear elicited from the video. Although studies have found a definite relation between epinephrine and fear, other emotions have not had such results. In the same study, subjects did not express a greater amusement to an amusement film nor greater anger to an anger film. Similar findings were also supported in a study that involved rodent subjects that either were able or unable to produce epinephrine. <b>Findings</b> <b>support</b> <b>the</b> idea that epinephrine does have a role in facilitating the encoding of emotionally arousing events, contributing to higher levels of arousal due to fear.|$|E

2500|$|The {{notion of}} telepathy is not {{dissimilar}} to two clinical concepts: delusions of thought insertion/removal. This similarity might explain how an individual {{might come to}} the conclusion that they were experiencing telepathy. Thought insertion/removal is a symptom of psychosis, particularly of schizophrenia, schizoaffective disorder or substance-induced psychosis. Psychiatric patients who experience this symptom falsely believe that some of their thoughts are not their own and that others (e.g., other people, aliens, demons or fallen angels, or conspiring intelligence agencies) are putting thoughts into their minds (thought insertion). Some patients feel as if thoughts are being taken out of their minds or deleted (thought removal). Along with other symptoms of psychosis, delusions of thought insertion may be reduced by antipsychotic medication.

2500|$|Proponents of {{the view}} that PCS has a {{physiological}} basis point to findings that children demonstrate deficits on standardized tests of cognitive function following a mild TBI. A few {{studies have shown that}} people with PCS score lower than controls on neuropsychological tests that measure attention, verbal learning, reasoning, and information processing, but issues related to effort and secondary gain {{can not be ruled out}} as contributing to these differences. [...] Recovery as measured by scores on cognitive tests frequently do not correlate with resolution of symptoms; individuals diagnosed with PCS may still report subjective symptoms after their performance on tests of cognitive functioning have returned to normal. Another study found that although children with PCS had poorer scores on tests of cognitive functioning after the injury, they also had poorer behavioral adjustment before the injury than children with no persistent symptoms; these <b>findings</b> <b>support</b> <b>the</b> idea that PCS may result from a combination of factors such as brain dysfunction resulting from head injury and preexisting psychological or social problems. Different symptoms may be predicted by different factors; for example, one study found that cognitive and physical symptoms were not predicted by the manner in which parents and family members coped with the injury and adjusted to its effects, but psychological and behavioral symptoms were.|$|E
2500|$|Job {{performance}} is another consistent and important outcome of core-self evaluations. [...] Many theories have developed regarding how the CSE trait {{is related to}} job performance; {{the most popular of}} these theories argues that people with high core self-evaluations will be more motivated to perform well because they are confident they have the ability to do so. [...] Another theory suggests that the link between core self-evaluations and performance can be attributed to supervisors enjoying the positivity of high CSE individuals and, thus, rating them highly on performance measures. [...] Lastly, literature has argued that high CSE could be an ability factor. [...] This last theory stems from intuitions made about core self-evaluations from previous connections found in literature. [...] For example, literature has connected the construct of positive self-concept, an idea similar to core self-evaluations, to the ability to cope well with organizational change. [...] Furthermore, individual core self-evaluation traits like emotional stability have been linked to job performance in team settings (Mount, Barrick, & Stewart, 1995 as cited in). [...] Finally, it is suggested that those with a positive self-concept will be likely to perform well in customer service settings due to their positive emotional displays. [...] These <b>findings</b> <b>support</b> <b>the</b> possibility that high core self-evaluations could indicate a person who has the ability to cope well with organizational change, to work well in groups, and to display positive emotions, all of which contribute to better performance.|$|E
