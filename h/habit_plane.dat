40|$|We {{show here}} that the {{boundaries}} of individual grains in dense polycrystals prefer certain crystallographic <b>habit</b> <b>planes,</b> {{almost as if they}} were independent of the neighboring crystals. In MgO, SrTiO 3, MgAl 2 O 4, TiO 2, and Al, the specific <b>habit</b> <b>planes</b> within the polycrystal correspond to the same planes that dominate the external growth forms and equilibrium shapes of isolated crystals of the same phase. The observations reduce the apparent complexity of interfacial networks and suggest that the mechanisms of solid state grain growth may be analogous to conventional crystal growth. The results also indicate that a model for grain boundary energy and structure based on grain surface relationships is more appropriate than the widely accepted models based on lattice orientation relationships...|$|R

40|$|Precipitations that exhibit irrational {{transformation}} crystallography {{can often}} be {{explained in terms of}} the O-lines in the <b>habit</b> <b>plane.</b> The present work developed an analytical O-line method, which is more useful than the numerical O-line method to study the variation in the <b>habit</b> <b>plane</b> and its structure in a systematic manner. This method has an advantage that the orientation relationship (OR) is the output from the calculation, while in many other models interpreting precipitation crystallography the OR is either an input or is constrained by a prerequisite condition. This paper described the derivation of this method and its application {{to the study of the}} precipitation crystallography in fcc-bcc systems. Examples were given for three alloy systems, namely Cu- 0. 33 wt% Cr and Ni- 45 wt% Cr alloys and a duplex-phase alpha-gamma stainless steel.

While the classical phenomenological theory of martensite crystallography (PTMC) is unable to explain the <b>habit</b> <b>plane</b> of type K martensite even though they contain f 1 1 0 1 g internal twins, application of the edge-to-edge matching (E 2 EM) model succeeded in accounting for both the orientation relationship and the <b>habit</b> <b>plane</b> orientation of the two types of martensite.
