40|$|A three-mass {{mechanical}} {{model that}} considers both shaft and blade flexibilities {{was used for}} the design of a torsional damper to damp drive-train vibrations in a wind turbine. Two torsional dampers were designed: one considering only the <b>drive-train</b> mode <b>and</b> another considering both the <b>drive-train</b> <b>and</b> blade in-plane symmetrical modes. The dampers performance was tested on a simple wind turbine model in Simulink® and then implemented in a more complete model in GH Bladed®. The simulation results on both wind turbine models correlate very well. This result indicates that a three-mass model is a good model for representing the shaft and blade flexibilities for designing a torsional damper. Simulation results show that considering both <b>drive-train</b> <b>and</b> blade in-plane mode frequencies when designing the torsional damper can lead to a better performance in damping torsional vibrations...|$|R

50|$|The most {{important}} characteristics about a racing bicycle are its weight and stiffness which determine the efficiency {{at which the}} power from a rider's pedal strokes can {{be transferred to the}} <b>drive-train</b> <b>and</b> subsequently to its wheels. To this effect racing bicycles may sacrifice comfort for speed. The drop handlebars are positioned lower than the saddle in order to put the rider in a more aerodynamic posture. The front and back wheels are close together so the bicycle has quick handling. The derailleur gear ratios are closely spaced so that the rider can pedal at their optimum cadence. Other racing bicycles, especially those used in time trialling, prioritize aerodynamics over comfort.|$|R

50|$|The early {{articulated}} haulers were rugged, lacked {{suspension and}} had manual transmissions.

40|$|Rolling mill drive-trains, {{driven by}} AC or DC motors, have {{historically}} experienced premature component fatigue failures {{even when the}} perceived operating load is well below the design limit. This is often related to low damped torsional vibrations, especially to self-excited vibrations in rolling slippage (especially during threading and tailing out of a rolled piece), overloading {{the elements of the}} drive-train. Long transmission shafts make these vibrations become more critical. A regulator aimed at damping the torsional vibrations of the rolling mill <b>drive-train</b> <b>and</b> thus reducing the electric motor speed fluctuations is presented in this paper. The proposed regulator relies on a reduced order state observer able to estimate the shaft torque amplifications due to the working process. The capability of the regulator to damp out torsional vibrations has been verified through simulations on a lumped parameter torsional model of a single-stand rolling mill accounting for torsional deformability of the power-train shafts...|$|R
50|$|Some links have {{side plates}} that are raised on top (figure 3), while some are straight, (figure 2), {{and some have}} more {{prominent}} pin projections than others. Since a chain on a derailleur-fitted bicycle is reversed for part of its excursion through the <b>drive-train,</b> <b>and</b> because some cogsets have close ramp tolerances, such a link might cause a malfunction if the wrong selection were made. Bushingless chains, with smaller projections, are used on bicycles with large cogsets, since their clearances are more critical than those with only seven speeds. In these former cases a master link of comparable quality is needed. As a result, some manufacturers of derailleurs (e.g. SRAM) recommend only their own products, and these days package a master link with each new chain that is purchased. Chains for small cogsets (e.g. seven-speeds) and other than derailleur-fitted bicycles are more tolerant of these master link dimensions.|$|R

40|$|In the {{monitoring}} process of wind turbines the utmost {{attention should be}} given to gearboxes. This conclusion is derived from numerous summary papers. They reveal that, on the one hand, gearboxes {{are one of the most}} fault susceptible elements in the <b>drive-train</b> <b>and,</b> on the other, the most expensive to replace. Although state-of-the-art CMS can usually provide advanced signal processing tools for extraction of diagnostic information, there are still many installations, where the diagnosis is based simply on the averaged wideband features like root-mean-square (RMS) or peak-peak (PP). Furthermore, for machinery working in highly changing operational conditions, like wind turbines, those estimators are strongly fluctuating, and this fluctuation is not linearly correlated to operation parameters. Thus, the sudden increase of a particular feature does not necessarily have to indicate the development of fault. To overcome this obstacle, it is proposed to detect a fault development with Artificial Neural Network (ANN) and further observation of linear regression parameters calculated on the estimation error between healthy and unknown condition. The proposed reasoning is presented on the real life example of ring gear fault in wind turbine’s planetary gearbox...|$|R
5000|$|RTV (Road Taxed Vehicle) {{trialing}} is {{the most}} common form of trialing. As the name suggests, it is for vehicles that are road-legal (and thus required to pay vehicle excise duty). This excludes vehicles that are highly modified or specially built. RTV-class vehicles can carry a wide range of suspension modifications, as well as off-road tires (provided they are road-legal), recovery winches, raised air intakes etc. Vehicles on RTV trials are usually best described as [...] "modified from standard"—they use the standard chassis, <b>drive-train</b> <b>and</b> body that the vehicle was built with. Whilst modification is not necessarily required for an RTV trial, at the very least the vehicle would be expected to have some under-body protection such as a sump guard, differential guard and solid sills. RTV courses are intended to be non-damaging and driven at little more than a walking pace and a course properly laid out would be drivable without damage. However, the terrain usually includes steep slopes, water, side-slopes, deep ruts and other obstacles that could potentially damage a vehicle if mistakes are made or poor driving technique is used, and vehicle modifications increase the chance of success.|$|R
