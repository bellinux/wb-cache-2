5000|$|The {{applicable}} {{legal provisions}} regarding the limited liability {{can be found}} in Art. 203, para. 1 and 3, Art. 204-209 and Art. 210 of the Labour Code. The size of the liability is differentiated for different categories of employees: for persons on executive and managing positions- three times the monthly remuneration; {{for the rest of the}} employees - no more than the amount of the monthly remuneration [...]In cases of limited liability, the employer issues an order in which he determines the basis and amount of the liability of the employee (Art. 210 of the LC). The order shall be issued within one month after discovery of the damage (but not later than one year after the induction). For executive and managing positions the periods are 3 months and 5 years accordingly.According to Art. 200 (1) of the LC the employer is liable with his assets for the damages that have led to a temporary or permanent incapacity or death of the employee. The employer is liable if an accident at work has been caused by force majeure or in fulfillment of the work commitments or during rest periods, provided the employee has not contributed himself to the accident or has caused it intentionally. The cases in which the employer is liable for damages are regulated in Art. 213-226 of the Labour Code and the amount of compensation is calculated on the basis of the <b>gross</b> <b>remuneration</b> for the last working month, unless otherwise provided (Art. 228).|$|E
40|$|The {{discussed}} {{article presents}} {{research on the}} value of the time of private travels by road transport in Poland. This research is based on the data obtained by the method of conditional pricing from a representative group of 1000 adult Poles. In the analysis of the collected data the logit model was used, in which the dependent variable was the probability of rejecting by the respondents of the proposed rate of single payment in exchange for the possibility of shortening the travel. The obtained results indicate that the average value of the unit of time of travel is higher than the average rate of <b>gross</b> <b>remuneration</b> for the equivalent period. In the research the socio-economic variables having influence on the vale of the time of travel were also discussed. ...|$|E
50|$|Almost all {{graduate}} internships are paid, but {{the remuneration}} is usually only around 600 euros gross per month (that is about ¼ of the <b>gross</b> monthly <b>remuneration</b> of an hired young graduate employee) and without benefits other than lunch {{and a few}} paid days for sickness or vacation. This poses a problem for graduates, considering as well that some companies use graduate interns just to save money, making them work for 6 to 12 months without giving them a decent remuneration, without offering them proper training or formation, and without hiring them after the internship {{even if they were}} shown to be productive, fast-learning and trustworthy.|$|R
40|$|AbstractBackground: The {{traditional}} {{separation of}} vascular surgery and interventional radiology into distinct units {{is associated with}} inefficiencies in patient care, practice management, and training. Traditional departmental politics, discrepant clinical backgrounds and philosophies, fear of decreasing remuneration, and basic differences in education, training, and practice have all rendered mergers difficult. Methods: We have implemented a model that incorporates all the clinical, fiscal, and educational activities of the 2 former entities into a single unit. A 5 -physician vascular surgery group, its noninvasive laboratory, and a 3 -physician interventional radiology group were unified. The revenue was deposited into a single account from which all the expenses were paid. The net income of the joint unit was apportioned on a predetermined pro rata basis, with scaled percentages for each practitioner. In an effort to separate clinical decision making from economic pressures, the individual physician remuneration {{was not on the}} basis of productivity. Clinical volume, <b>gross</b> revenue, and <b>remuneration</b> were compared with the 12 -month period that immediately preceded the merger and contrasted to the previous 3 -year historical trend (HT). Results: The number of vascular surgical procedures fell after the merger (– 9. 3 %; HT, + 4. 7 %). By contrast, the number of interventional radiology procedures rose (+ 56. 1 %; HT, + 15. 2 %), as did the number of noninvasive testing (+ 9. 2 %; HT, + 3. 5 %). In concordance with the number of procedures, the gross revenue of vascular surgery fell (– 23. 7 %; HT, + 1. 1 %) and that of interventional radiology rose (+ 53. 5 %; HT, + 46. 0 %). The increased efficiencies allowed the total expenses of the 2 units to fall (– 13. 2 %; HT, + 7. 5 %), and, despite the reduced revenue, the vascular surgeon remuneration was preserved (+ 0. 7 %; HT, – 3. 9 %) and the radiology remuneration rose (+ 22. 3 %; HT, + 8. 3 %). The merger allowed the vascular surgery fellows to actively participate in 26 interventional cases per month and the interventional radiology fellows to actively participate in 8 open surgical cases per month. Conclusion: The merger of vascular surgery and interventional radiology resulted in a decrease in the surgical procedures and revenue, with a corresponding increase in the interventional radiology procedures and revenue. Despite these effects, the physician remuneration increased as a result of the improved efficiencies in practice management and the reduction in expenses. The merger of the 2 units excludes the economic pressures from clinical decision making and appears to be warranted on the basis of the fiscal and educational benefits that are achieved.

40|$|The {{total value}} of the South African fishing {{industry}} amounted to R 2. 78 billion in 1999 and the Western Cape accounted for about 90 % of the industry. Demersal trawl contributes almost 50 % to the {{total value of}} the industry. The Western Cape exported fish with a total value of R 2 418. 4 million, representing 8. 5 % of total Western Cape exports and 73 % of total South African fish exports. The South African fishing industry employs 38 311 people of which 90 % are Black. The Western Cape employs approximately 70 % of the workers and about 71 % of the <b>gross</b> <b>remuneration</b> is earned in the Western Cape. The majority (90. 6 %) of workers in the fishing industry in the commercial harbour towns of the Western Cape are Black. 76 % of the Black workers are semi-skilled. Transformation in the fishing industry is primarily the result of a change in the number and size of fishing rights allocated. Some 2 625 rights (or quotas) were allocated in 2001, of which at least 2 000 qualify as SMME’s. The Department of Environmental Affairs and Tourism estimates that an average of 60 % are majority PDI-owned (majority pdi-owned means 51 % or more of the company is owned by pdi’s). This large number of rights allocated to pdi’s or companies owned and managed by pdi’s, resulted in a large increase in the flow of income to impoverished fishing communities...|$|E
