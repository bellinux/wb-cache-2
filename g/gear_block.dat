40|$|International audienceThis {{work was}} aimed at {{studying}} the overall, partial, and local residence time distributions (RTD); overall, partial and local residence revolution distributions (RRD) and overall, partial and local residence volume distributions (RVD) in a co-rotating twin screw extruder, on the one hand; and establishing the relationships among them, on the other hand. Emphasis {{was placed on the}} effects of the type and geometry of mixing elements (a <b>gear</b> <b>block</b> and various types of kneading elements differing in staggering angle) and process parameters on the RTD, RRD and RVD. The overall and partial RTD were directly measured in-line during the extrusion process and the local ones were calculated by deconvolution based on a statistical theory. The local RTD allowed comparing the mixing performance of mixing elements. Also it was confirmed both experimentally and theoretically that specific throughput, defined as a ratio of throughput (Q) over screw speed (N), controlled all the above three types of residence distributions, be they local, partial or overall. The RRD and RVD do not provide more information on an extrusion process than the corresponding RTD. Rather they are different ways of representing the same phenomena...|$|E

40|$|External {{spur gear}} pumps are {{exceedingly}} useful components in common hydraulic systems. The main issue with {{external gear pumps}} is that all current models are limited to only fixed-displacement. This means that for every revolution of the gears inside the pump, a set amount of fluid will always be displaced. Consequently, external gear pumps are limited in their use because they can only operate at full throttle causing inefficiencies when reduced displacement is needed. The successful procurement of a variable displacement gear pump will allow a more efficient use of hydraulic systems, {{such as in the}} displacement controlled systems used in some heavy construction equipment. In this research approach, the displacement is varied by changing the timing of the gears inside the pump. More specifically, changing the timing of the gears’ connections with the inlet and outlet grooves alters the available volume in the gears’ spaces, subsequently varying the displacement. With this in mind, additional research was conducted to develop an actuation system for the aforementioned process. This includes the design of new <b>gears,</b> bearing <b>blocks,</b> and additional hydraulics for use in a modified existing commercial pump. Simulations have shown the implementation of the design allowed for a 67 % reduction in displacement, and thus successful introduction of variable displacement into an external gear pump. Additional {{research is needed to determine}} the optimal designs for the actuation system and variable displacement concept used in the gear pump...|$|R
40|$|There {{is growing}} {{interest}} in accelerating irregular data-parallel algorithms on GPUs. These algorithms are typically blocking, so they require fair scheduling.

We propose cooperative kernels, an extension to the traditional GPU programming model <b>geared</b> towards writing <b>blocking</b> algorithms. Workgroups of a cooperative kernel are fairly scheduled, and multitasking is supported via a small set of language extensions through which the kernel and scheduler cooperate.

5000|$|Other modern {{features}} are carbon fibre prods (bowsprits) supported by bob stays, dolphin strikers and bow struts. This enabled quicker setting and dropping {{of the large}} downwind sails. Huge spinnakers could be set quickly by having halyards <b>geared</b> by mini <b>blocks</b> running internally in the mast. Dacron sails were replaced by much lighter stiffer less porous material such as mylar plastic. Weights of the bare hulls dropped quickly when New Zealand designer Bruce Farr, using his experience in Moth and Cherub designs used thin 3mm ply supported by multiple lightweight stringers and stiffened with tissue fibreglass. These were quickly followed by foam and fibreglass hulls first designed by Russell Bowler. Bare hulls weigh 120 lbs but are very strong {{with the use of}} carbon and kevlar to locally reinforce mast steps, centreboard cases, chain plates and wing attachment points.

50|$|During development, the {{anticipated}} {{weight of the}} He 177 increased so much that a main undercarriage design sufficient to handle the 32 MT loaded weight, was difficult to achieve. The engine nacelles and wings had little room for the main undercarriage members, which needed to be longer than usual, for ground clearance for the large diameter four-blade propellers. After several extremely complex arrangements had been considered during initial design, a novel system was adopted. Instead of a wheel leg under each engine nacelle, two wheel legs were attached to the main spar at each nacelle, the outboard legs retracting upward and outward into shallow wing wells and the inboard legs swinging upward and inward into similar wells in the wing roots, with all units enclosed by flush fitting wheel and strut doors, which almost met under each engine nacelle when fully extended. During the retraction cycle, the forward-oriented lever-action lower gear strut sections, on which the wheels were mounted onto their axles, pivoted to a 90° angle from 120° when fully extended to the main gear leg, {{to be able to}} fit into the wheel wells. A conventional rearwards-retracting single-leg twin wheel arrangement for each main gear was used on the two prototypes built (one during the war, one post-war) of the He 274 in France. Drawings were made for a tricycle gear arrangement for the Amerika Bomber entry version of the proposed He 277, which was also depicted with single main gear struts with twin wheels. For the He 177A's own landing gear maintenance needs, some two hours were required just to change a main gear tire, using special Heinkel-designed 12 MT capacity main <b>gear</b> jacks and <b>blocks.</b>|$|R
40|$|ABSTRACT South Africa, like {{numerous}} {{other developing countries}} throughout the world, faces increasing demands for public services in urban areas (Rondinelli and Kasarda, 1993). South Africa’s access to basic services such as water has clearly become part of social security/ citizenship. The research report investigates and elucidates the role of privatisation in the basic service delivery context. It argues that the <b>GEAR</b> policy framework <b>blocks</b> the resources required to achieve social citizenship (Cock 2000). This gave rise to community struggles concerning prepaid water meters in Phiri, Soweto. These struggles are examined and competing discourses surrounding public versus private sector participation in basic service (water) provision are also explored. The argument in this research report is two-fold. First, it establishes a view of water as an economic good, with the democratic government reducing the municipal problems of delivery to economic markets or private corporations. Second, it examines the perspective that water is a human right issue contained in the Bill of Rights. These two counter-arguments perpetuate struggles in relation to access, affordability and supply of water. The research seeks to examine these opposing arguments and further explores the impacts these struggles have on future delivery and access of such ‘life need’ as water. This exposure is done through the collection of Secondary data and empirical evidence obtained using various qualitative data gathering techniques. Although the advantages of prepaid water meters are recognised, the dominant argument in this report {{is in line with}} Dependency Theory. This maintains that the socio-economic inequalities as well as the socio-environmental injustices widespread in the policies of privatisation exclude various sectors of the population from full access to essential necessities such as water. These injustices are rooted in the fact that water is treated as a commodity to be sold and not as a basic human right (Maema 2003). To deny water to people reduces their citizenship and therefore the achievement of full citizens’ rights for the community of Phiri {{has become one of the}} crucial barometers for the realisation of the depth and sustainability of South Africa’s democracy (Khunou 2000). The research findings obtained suggest that the government does realise its responsibility to provide basic water services. Nevertheless, it delegates this responsibility to private institutions; hence making it an individual responsibility to gain access to water at a cost. This form of attempt in South Africa gives a clear reflection of Adam Smith’s “commercial society” which is viii encompassed and endorsed by privatisation and the capitalist endeavours. However, this is in contrast with the principles enshrined in the constitution of the Republic of South Africa, which mandate the government to ensure the progressive realisation and maintenance of access to available basic services. The research report, however, suggests that some educational programmes need to be developed and promoted to inform and equip the public on how best to preserve water. This endeavour is gradually envisaged under the auspices of emerging corporatised utilities...|$|R
