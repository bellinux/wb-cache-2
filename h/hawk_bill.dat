50|$|Illinois picked Tulsa coach Bill Self {{from a list}} of {{numerous}} candidates, including popular assistant Jimmy Collins, to succeed Kruger, who moved on to the NBA to coach the Atlanta <b>Hawks.</b> <b>Bill</b> Self was hired to the Illini coaching staff as the 15th head coach {{in the history of the}} program. He spent his previous seven years as the head coach of Oral Roberts University and Tulsa University where he compiled an overall record of 129-71. In 2001, his first season at Illinois, Self coached his new Fighting Illini squad to a 27-8 record, a share of the Big Ten title, and a number 1 seed in the NCAA Tournament. That 27-game winning season in Self's first year was the second most winning season in school history at that time. McClain, Cook and preseason Big Ten player of the year Cory Bradford led the Illini to the Elite Eight, where they fell to eventual finalist Arizona in a much disputed contest. The Illini were accused of being overly physical most of the season, especially McClain and pesky guards Sean Harrington and Lucas Johnson (younger brother of former Illini forward Brian Johnson). The '01 Illini team also included Robert Archibald, Damir Krupalija and Marcus Griffin. With mostly the same core, Illinois followed up the season with impressive 2002 and 2003 campaigns, but fell in the Sweet 16 in 2002. He was the first head coach in the Big Ten, since 1912, to lead his team to conference championships in each of his first two seasons. It was also the first time Illinois won back-to-back titles in 50 years. Self, also, had an overall record of 53-17 in his two years as Illinois head coach. Self left for Kansas after the 2003 season.|$|R
25|$|When McLaughlin died in 1944, Norris helped {{longtime}} Black <b>Hawks</b> president <b>Bill</b> Tobin {{put together}} a syndicate that bought the team from the McLaughlin estate. It was generally understood, however, that Norris called the shots. He had bought Chicago Stadium in 1936, thus making him the Black Hawks' landlord. Earlier in the decade, he had bought enough stock in Madison Square Garden to become its largest stockholder, and while he did not buy majority control (he was forbidden from doing so by the NHL constitution), he had enough support from the board that he effectively controlled the New York Rangers as well. Norris's loans to the Boston Bruins during the 1930s gave him significant control over that franchise as a creditor as well, which effectively gave him control {{of the majority of}} the league.|$|R
5000|$|The season saw {{the return}} of the National Hockey League All-Star Game, an idea that, {{although}} proposed in the previous season, came into fruition this year.

Other stars would retire, ending both the Montreal Canadiens' Punch line and the Boston Bruins' Kraut Line. However, this season saw the creation of the Detroit Red Wings' Production Line. The policy of having players raise their hockey sticks to signify that a goal was scored was also initiated in this season, at the suggestion of Frank Patrick, with Habs forward Billy Reay being the first to do on November 13, 1947. The season also saw Boston's Don Gallinger suspended indefinitely pending an investigation of gambling activities and the New York Rangers' Billy [...] "The Kid" [...] Taylor being expelled for life for gambling.|$|R
