5|$|Belgium {{failed to}} {{progress}} {{past the first}} round of their earliest five World Cup participations. After two scoreless defeats at the inaugural World Cup in 1930, the team scored in their first-round knockout games in the 1934 and 1938 editions—but only <b>enough</b> <b>to</b> <b>save</b> their honour. In 1954, they tied with England (4–4 after extra time), and in 1970, they won their first World Cup match, against El Salvador (3–0). From 1982 until 2002, Belgium reached six successive World Cups by playing qualification rounds, advancing to the second phase five times. In the 1982 FIFA World Cup opener, Belgium beat defending champions Argentina 1–0. Their tournament ended in the second group stage, after a Polish hat-trick by Zbigniew Boniek and a 0–1 loss against the Soviet Union.|$|E
5|$|On 3 October, Vale {{secured the}} biggest ever win at Vale Park when they beat York City 5–0. Seven days later Vale's clean sheet streak {{came to an}} end, though they still secured a 2–1 victory over Chesterfield at Saltergate; Cyril Hatton was the scorer for Chesterfield, though it proved not <b>enough</b> <b>to</b> <b>save</b> his team's unbeaten home record. Albert Mullard had a penalty kick saved {{towards the end of}} the game by goalkeeper Ron Powell, the only one of two {{penalties}} the club were awarded throughout the campaign. Vale then beat Tranmere Rovers 2–0 after their defence successfully contained the threat posed by the division's then-top scorer Cyril Done. The following week they won 1–0 at Halifax Town in a game where Ken Griffiths hit the woodwork three times.|$|E
5|$|The plot of The Legend of Zelda is {{described}} in the instruction booklet and in the short prologue after the title screen. A small kingdom {{in the land of}} Hyrule, the setting of the game, is engulfed in chaos after an army led by Ganon, the Prince of Darkness, invaded it and stole the Triforce of Power, a part of a magical artifact bestowing great strength. In an attempt to prevent Ganon from acquiring the Triforce of Wisdom, another of the pieces, Princess Zelda splits it and hides the eight fragments in secret dungeons throughout the land. Before the princess is eventually kidnapped by Ganon, she commands her nursemaid Impa to find someone courageous <b>enough</b> <b>to</b> <b>save</b> the kingdom. While wandering the land, the old woman is surrounded by Ganon's henchmen, though a young boy named Link appears and rescues her. After hearing Impa's plea, he resolves to save Zelda and sets out to reassemble the scattered fragments of the Triforce of Wisdom, to become powerful enough to defeat Ganon.|$|E

5|$|In 1994, {{the players}} were locked out by the owners {{because of a lack}} of a Collective Bargaining Agreement (CBA). The 1994–95 NHL lockout lasted 104days and {{resulted}} in the season's being shortened from a planned 84 games to 48. The owners insisted on a salary cap, changes to free agency and arbitration in the hopes of limiting escalating salaries, the union instead proposed a luxury tax system. Just as the entire season seemed to be lost, an 11th-hour deal was agreed on. The owners failed to achieve a full salary cap but the deal was initially hailed as a win for the owners. The deal was not <b>enough</b> <b>to</b> <b>save</b> two teams in Canada's smallest NHL markets. The revenue disparity between large and small market teams, exacerbated by the falling value of the Canadian Dollar, forced the Quebec Nordiques to move to Denver and become the Colorado Avalanche in 1995; the Winnipeg Jets relocated to Phoenix, Arizona, becoming the Coyotes, the next year. The Hartford Whalers followed, moving to Greensboro, NC and becoming the Carolina Hurricanes in 1997. The NHL continued its expansion into cities in the Southern United States. In 1998, the Nashville Predators joined the league, followed by the Atlanta Thrashers the following year. To further market their players, the NHL decided to have its players play in the Winter Olympics, starting in 1998, at the Nagano Games. In 2000, the league added two franchises, boosting the total number to 30. The NHL returned to Minnesota with the Wild and added the Blue Jackets in Columbus, Ohio.|$|E
5|$|Pre-season for Plymouth Argyle {{began on}} 1 July 2009 {{when the first}} team squad {{returned}} to Harpers Park. A week of intense training followed, before the club's first match of the new season took place on 13 July 2009 against Cornish side Truro City. In a match which featured trialist Kári Árnason, Argyle scored a goal in each half to earn a comfortable win. A youthful Argyle team headed across the city of Plymouth {{the next day to}} take on Plymouth Parkway. The visitors fell behind to an early goal but responded with three of their own in an entertaining friendly, including a brace from Republic of Ireland youth international Joe Mason. The first team were in action again the next day, against Torquay United. The visitors went behind twice but looked like leaving Plainmoor with a win until Torquay converted a penalty in the 90th minute. The squad then departed for a tour of Scotland, and stopped off in the north of England on the way in order to play a friendly against Skelmersdale United on 18 July 2009. Argyle came away with a 2–0 win after scoring a goal in each half. A picturesque setting greeted the squad as they took to the field against Livingston on 20 July 2009. An 81st-minute penalty from Luke Summerfield wasn't <b>enough</b> <b>to</b> <b>save</b> Argyle from their first defeat of the season.|$|E

25|$|To prevent electrocution, RCDs should {{operate within}} 25–40 {{milliseconds}} with any leakage currents (through a person) of greater than 30 mA, before electric shock can drive the heart into ventricular fibrillation, {{the most common}} cause of death through electric shock. By contrast, conventional circuit breakers or fuses only break the circuit when the total current is excessive (which may be thousands of times the leakage current an RCD responds to). A small leakage current, such as through a person, can be a very serious fault, but would probably not increase the total current enough for a fuse or circuit breaker to break the circuit, and certainly not do so fast <b>enough</b> <b>to</b> <b>save</b> a life.|$|E
