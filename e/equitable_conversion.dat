50|$|The State of New York {{does not}} {{recognize}} <b>equitable</b> <b>conversion.</b> In New York, {{as long as the}} buyer is without fault, the risk of loss remains on the seller until the buyer takes title or possession.|$|E
50|$|The {{consequences}} of this maxim, and of <b>equitable</b> <b>conversion,</b> are significant in their bearing on the risk of loss in transactions. When parties enter a contract for a sale of real property, the buyer is deemed to have obtained an equitable right that becomes a legal right only after the deal is completed.|$|E
5000|$|A growing {{minority}} of States {{have adopted the}} Uniform Vendor and Purchaser Risk Act (UVPRA) {{in one form or}} another. The UVPRA negates the doctrine of <b>Equitable</b> <b>Conversion</b> {{as it relates to the}} risk associated with loss. The risk of loss is retained by the seller (Vendor/Grantor) under the UVPRA. [...] Generally, the provisions of the UVPRA can be modified or avoided in the Land Sale Contract.|$|E
50|$|There {{are several}} cases in which, by statute or otherwise, {{property}} {{is taken out}} of the class of real or personal to which it seems naturally to belong. By the operation of the <b>equitable</b> doctrine of <b>conversion</b> money directed to be employed in the purchase of land, or land directed to be turned into money, is in general regarded as that species of property into which it is directed to be converted. An example of property prima facie real which is treated as personal is an estate pur autre vie, which, since 1740, is distributable as personal property {{in the absence of a}} special occupant. Examples of property prima facie personal which is treated as real are fixtures, heirlooms, such as deeds and family portraits, and shares in some of the older companies, as the New River Company, which are real estate by statute. In ordinary cases shares in companies are personal property, unless the shareholders have individually some interest in the land as land.|$|R

5000|$|Sometimes phrased as [...] "equity {{regards as}} done {{what should have}} been done", this maxim means that when {{individuals}} are required, by their agreements or by law, to perform some act of legal significance, equity will regard that act as having been done as it ought to have been done, even before it has actually happened. This makes possible the legal phenomenon of <b>equitable</b> <b>conversion.</b>|$|E
50|$|By {{purchasing}} the property from trustees, under Section 2 of the Law of Property Act 1925, the occupation rights {{of any other}} party are automatically extinguished. If such a party claims an overriding interest in the land, that interest is converted by attaching a monetary interest to the land, such as a purchase price, and the interest claimed by the party is 'overreached'; this conversion {{is often referred to}} as the doctrine of <b>equitable</b> <b>conversion.</b>|$|E
50|$|<b>Equitable</b> <b>conversion</b> is a {{doctrine}} {{of the law of}} real property under which a purchaser of real property becomes the equitable owner of title to the property at the time he/she signs a contract binding him/her to purchase the land at a later date. The seller retains legal title of the property prior to the date of conveyance, but this land interest is considered personal property (a right to the payment of money, rather than a right to the property). The risk of loss is then transferred to the buyerif a house on the property burns down after the contract has been signed, but before the deed is conveyed, the buyer will nevertheless have to pay the agreed-upon purchase price for the land. Such issues can and should be avoided by parties by stipulating in the contract who will bear the loss in such occurrences. The above rule varies by jurisdiction, but is the general rule.|$|E
40|$|Since the 1925 {{decision}} of Ashford v. Reese, Washington {{has had the}} distinction of being the only American jurisdiction totally, albeit implicitly, to reject the doctrine of <b>equitable</b> <b>conversion.</b> Ashford was overruled in 1977, in a remarkable opinion which simultaneously, and explicitly, rejected the doctrine of <b>equitable</b> <b>conversion,</b> thus maintaining Washington 2 Ì† 7 s unique status with respect to that doctrine. But the opinion failed to provide a substitute for either the rule of Ashford or the contrary doctrine of <b>equitable</b> <b>conversion,</b> both of which it emphatically abjured. The result is an unbroken line of Washington cases consistent with only one rule of law-the doctrine of <b>equitable</b> <b>conversion.</b> The effect of the opinion is thus de jure rejection and de facto adoption of <b>equitable</b> <b>conversion.</b> This article will analyze the process by which Washington has managed to achieve substantial conformity with the majority of American jurisdictions, while resolutely maintaining a unique stance...|$|E

40|$|The {{principal}} {{thesis of}} this Article is that property and contract questions {{should not be}} solved independently and are most usefully approached in a distinct order. Because the installment contract divides the incidents of property ownership usually associated with legal title between {{the parties to the}} contract, it should be treated differently than the earnest money contract in which the incidents of ownership are not divided. In addition, it is important to first answer some remedial questions before proceeding to make decisions about the property interest of each party to the contract. To support this thesis, this Article explains in detail how the Ashford legacy has affected the treatment of real estate contracts in Washington. It then compares the Washington approach with the doctrine of <b>equitable</b> <b>conversion.</b> Finally, it suggests an analysis for real estate contract problems and applies that analysis to some remaining problem areas...|$|E
40|$|We humans {{now have}} a name for our {{survival}} instinct: sustainable development. This means, quite simply, living on this planet as if we intended to go on living here forever. Porritt 2002, p. 75 Abstract: Sustainable mineral resources development {{can be seen as the}} <b>equitable</b> <b>conversion</b> of transient mineral wealth into durable social and environmental capital. In the past, this con-version has not been efficient or equitable, with benefits accruing mainly to First World inves-tors and consumers by externalization f social and environmental costs to local people and places. Modern industry, led by large multinational corporations, isin the process of changing its modus operandi toembrace ideas of corporate and social responsibility. The damage from past practices to the developing world is severe, however, and may require measures b yond voluntary or current legal instruments to reverse degenerative trends. Central among these requirements is Third World debt cancellation. However, the mining industry can also contrib-ute by fully internalizing the costs of mineral production, and paying a fair price for the resources it extracts; these internalized costs should be reflected in higher commodity prices. This can be achieved through a combination of financial instruments and incentives...|$|E
