40|$|Summary: Threat mitigation, in the {{disaster}} management community, is {{treated in a}} systematic “all-hazards ” manner, addressing readiness, response, and recovery. Deflection is only one element of response to an NEO threat. As the early warning system, NASA’s Spaceguard search programs must go beyond finding threatening objects and calculating <b>impact</b> <b>probabilities.</b> Uncertainties must be calculated properly and sound risk communication practices must be employed, to inform the public, officials, and disaster management agencies; strategic planning must guide response. NASA must establish interfaces with national and international agencies that would lead response and recovery efforts if a NEO were to impact without warning, or if deflection is impossible or attempts to deflect fail. We outline basic elements of a NEO threat mitigation plan, emphasizing elements that are or should be NASA’s responsibility...|$|R
