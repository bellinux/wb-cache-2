[...] The Federal Environment Ministry estimated that renewables were to save 87 million tonnes of carbon dioxide by 2012. The average level of feed-in tariff was 9.53 ¢/kWh in 2005 (compared to an average cost of displaced energy of 4.7 ¢/kWh). In 2004, the total level of reallocated EEG surcharges was €2.4 billion, at a cost per consumer of 0.56 ¢/kWh (3% of household electricity costs). By 2013, the figure had risen to €20.4 billion. The tariffs are lowered every year to encourage more efficient production of renewable energy. By 2014, the EEG surcharge - which pays for the additional costs through feed-in tariffs - had increased to 6.24 ¢/kWh.

40|$|With {{unpredictable}} oil prices, geopolitical tensions over {{oil reserves}} and, perhaps most importantly, very {{serious concerns about}} climate change, {{there has been a}} renewed interest for wider implementations of alternative sources of energy. Over the past several years, wind energy has been rapidly developing and is certainly one of the most attractive sources of renewable energy. Currently, the European commission aims at respectively 11 % and 18 % of EU <b>gross</b> <b>electricity</b> <b>production</b> by wind power in 2020 and 2030. On the long term, 50 % of this capacity is expected to be installed in off-shore wind farms (SET plan, EU commission). With the recognition that wind energy may become an important contributor to the world’s overall energy portfolio, both on- and off-shore wind farms are expected to become more extended and cover increasingly larger surface areas. Envisioning such large-scale implementations calls for advancements in our understanding of the detailed interactions between wind turbines and the atmospheric surface layer. Increased understanding is required to improve siting of wind-farms, to optimize the spatial distribution of wind turbines inside an array, to better quantify unsteady loading and failure predictions, as well as to parameterize their effects in very large-scale simulation...|$|E
40|$|Renewable energy {{resources}} provide {{a large share}} of the total energy consumption of many developing countries. Turkey's renewable sources are the second largest source for energy production after coal. About two-thirds of the renewable energy produced is obtained from biomass, while the rest is mainly from hydroelectric energy. Hydropower is today the most important kind of renewable and sustainable energy. In Turkey, most of the important water power plants have been developed; hence, only a modest increase in the hydroelectric generating capability can be anticipated in the next two decades. Turkey has a gross annual hydro potential of 433, 000 Â GWh, which is almost 1 % of world total potential. Its share is about 16 % of the total hydropower capacity in Europe. The total <b>gross</b> <b>electricity</b> <b>production</b> of Turkey has reached about 140, 283 Â GWh in 2003, 75 % of this is produced from thermal sources and the reminder 25 % from hydropower.

Global Change Biology, 10 (4) 509 - 518 Field trials throughout Europe over the past 15 years have confirmed the potential for high biomass production from Miscanthus, a giant perennial rhizomatous grass with C 4 photosynthesis. However, policies to promote the utilization of biomass crops require yield estimates that can be scaled up to regional, national and continental areas. The only way in which this information can be reliably provided is {{through the use of}} productivity models. Here, we describe MISCANMOD, a productivity model, which was used in conjunction with a GIS to plot potential, non-water-limited yields across Europe. Modelled rainfed yields were also calculated using a water balance approach based on FAO estimates of plant available water in the soil. The observed yields were consistent with modelled yields at 20 trial sites across Europe. We estimate that if Miscanthus was grown on 10 % of suitable land area in the European Union (EU 15), 231 TWh yr? 1 of electricity could be generated, which is 9 % of the <b>gross</b> <b>electricity</b> <b>production</b> in 2000.

40|$|Portugal is {{a country}} with an energy system highly {{dependent}} on oil and gas imports. Imports {{of oil and gas}} accounted for 85 % of the country's requirements in 2005 and 86 % in 2006. Meanwhile, the share of renewable energy sources (RES) in the total primary energy consumption was only 14 % in 2006. When focusing only on electricity production, the situation is somewhat better. The share of RES in <b>gross</b> <b>electricity</b> <b>production</b> varies between 20 % and 35 % and is dependent on the hydropower production in wet and dry years. This paper presents, on a national scale, Portugal's energy system planning and technical solutions for achieving 100 % RES electricity production. Planning was based on hourly energy balance and use of H 2 RES software. The H 2 RES model provides the ability to integrate various types of storages into energy systems in order to increase penetration of the intermittent renewable energy sources or to achieve a 100 % renewable island, region or country. The paper also represents a stepping-stone for studies offering wider possibilities in matching and satisfying electricity supply in Portugal with potential renewable energy sources. Special attention has been given to intermittent sources such as wind, solar and ocean waves that can be coupled to appropriate energy storage systems charged with surplus amounts of produced electricity. The storage systems also decrease installed power requirements for generating units. Consequently, these storages will assist in avoiding unnecessary rejection of renewable potential and reaching a sufficient security of energy supply.

40|$|The aim of {{this paper}} is to {{identify}} the main circumstances related to the Estonian energy sector and economy and the facts which are important for development of the research conducted by the author and for clarification of the main viewpoints. The paper provides the principal facts on the first (2005 - 2007) and second (2008 - 2012) period of CO 2 (carbon dioxide) trade in Estonia; describes <b>electricity</b> <b>production</b> in Estonia on the basis of the electricity development plan effective in the reference year 2007 and proceeding from that – calculations of CO 2 emissions by kind of fuel used. The paper will touch upon the main legislative provisions concerning renewable energy support, which essentially influence the development of renewable energy generation and indirectly the CO 2 trade. Analogously with the reference year 2007 methods of calculation, CO 2 emissions have been calculated for 2020. The <b>electricity</b> <b>production</b> prognosis for the year 2020 is based on the interpretation of the electricity sector development plan. Computation according to the CO 2 calculation methodology shows that the CO 2 emission amount will be ca 5. 7 Mt (million tonnes) in 2020. In 2020 compared to 2007, the domestic consumption of electricity is estimated to grow: in 2007 the domestic consumption of electricity was ca 8200 GWh, in 2020 it is estimated to be ca 10480 GWh, i. e. the growth is ca 22 %. Decrease in the emission amount of CO 2 will be gained due to the expected use of different energy sources, compared to those used in 2007, in the designed power plants based on renewable energy sources or gas. The share of oil shale-based energy production will decrease from 83 % to 44 % resulting in a further reduction of CO 2 emissions from 12 Mt to 4 Mt. In view of the fact that, during consumption, the CO 2 emissions comprise nearly 60 % of the <b>gross</b> consumption of <b>electricity</b> <b>production,</b> the research reveals that raising consumer awareness of the use of various energy saving equipment and the promotion of economical lifestyle involve a remarkable potential for reducing the amount of CO 2 emission. To ensure competitiveness of electricity producers in the free market conditions, influenced by CO 2 emission allowance trading, construction of the power plants in compliance with national regulations must be ensured with the help of support schemes, state aid, tax policies and legislative measures. Since the quota trade rules which will apply after the year 2012 are not distinctly clear yet, thus this topic will be developed further in the articles to come...|$|R
