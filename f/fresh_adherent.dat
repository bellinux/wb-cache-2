40|$|To {{determine}} whether viral antigens associated with infected cells were processed for presentation to T cells, we cultured human blood mononuclear cells (MNC) from varicella-zoster virus (VZV) immune donors with VZV-infected fibroblasts of known HLA type {{which had been}} fixed in 0. 05 % glutaraldehyde. After 7 - 8 days of culture thymidine uptake by T 4 + cells exceeded that of T 8 + cells. Stimulated cells were depleted of adherent cells and restimulated with VZV-infected fibroblasts from donors matched or unmatched with the responder for HLA type in {{the presence or absence}} of <b>fresh</b> <b>adherent</b> cells. Proliferation of the VZV-specific blasts required the presence of adherent cells matched with the responder lymphocytes for HLA-DR; conversely, the VZV specific response was not restricted by the MHC of the fibroblasts used in the restimulation assay. Preincubation of the adherent cells with chloroquine inhibited the proliferative response in a dose-dependent manner. These results suggest that VZV antigens on infected cells may be processed by monocytes for presentation to T cells...|$|E
40|$|International audienceThis study {{examined}} {{the interaction of the}} poorly metastatic human melanoma cell line M 4 Be and the highly metastatic clone 4 derived from M 4 Be, with respect to <b>fresh</b> <b>adherent</b> leukocytes (AL) isolated from 17 different healthy blood donors. These AL contained 80 % (73 %- 93 %) monocytes, 15 % (6 %- 20 %) B lymphocytes and 5 % (1 %- 8 %) T lymphocytes. The survival of these tumor cells against the stress exerted by these AL was estimated with a clonogenic assay where isolated tumor cells were co-cultured for 14 days in contact with AL and lipopolysaccharide (LPS). For a given blood donor, AL either stimulates or inhibits the colony formation of the tumor cells (T) depending on the AL/T ratio, the AL activation status and the metastatic potential of tumor cells. At low AL/T ratios (10 / 1), whatever the characteristics of the blood donor, clone 4 is significantly more sensitive than M 4 Be to AL activated with medium containing low (8 ng/ml) or high (1, 000 ng/ml) levels of LPS; this killing effect is suggested to be due to TNF-alpha, both soluble and membrane-bound, but not to be due to release of H 2 O 2. These data suggest that the regulatory role of AL, which remove the majority of human melanoma cells and stimulate the colony formation of a small fraction of them, is partly due to TNF-alpha...|$|E
40|$|Although {{endoscopic}} injection {{therapy is}} an effective method for bleeding peptic ulcers, it is associated with significant re-bleeding rate; whether the addition of thermal method improves the outcome is still unclear. Our previous experience showed that Argon Plasma Coagulation (APC) alone is not sufficient in stopping spurting haemorrhage, and potentially dangerous for large non bleeding visible vessels (NBVV). Our hypothesis was that combination of adrenaline injection (AI) and thermal therapy could be more efficient than thermal therapy alone for permanent haemostasis of active bleeding peptic ulcers, and particularly appropriate for NBVV treatment. From October 1998 to February 2000 we examined two hundred patients with upper gastrointestinal bleeding. Fifty-three patients with major peptic ulcer haemorrhages received combined injection therapy with adrenaline 1 : 10. 000 and Argon plasma coagulation; there were 34 male and 19 female {{with a mean age}} of 63. 2 +/- 1. 2 years (range 22 - 93). The bleeding site was duodenal in 30 patients, gastric in 17 patients, anastomotic in 5 patients and esophageal in 1 patient. Endoscopic findings were the following: active bleeding in 23 patients (6 spurting, 17 oozing), non bleeding visible vessels in 12 patients and <b>fresh</b> <b>adherent</b> clots in 18 patients. Initial haemostasis was achieved in 52 / 53 patients (98. 1 %). Re-bleeding was observed in 5 / 52 cases (9. 6 %). Surgery was necessary in 3 / 53 patients (5. 6 %). Mortality was 7. 5 % (4 cases). No major complications resulted from this treatment. Primary adrenaline injection provided initial bleeding arrest, facilitating the following application of APC, because of a more precise definition of the active bleeding site. Rates of initial hemostasis were significantly higher with combined therapy (injection + APC) compared to APC treatment alone. We believe that Adrenaline and APC combined therapy {{is an effective}} and safe method for treatment of non-variceal gastrointestinal bleeding...|$|E

Every day, every minute brings it <b>fresh</b> <b>adherents.</b> It is as certain that some day a king will reign once more at Versailles, as that the sun will set before many hours are past. The French people are too bourgeois at heart to love a republic. The desire for its abolition is growing up in their hearts day by day. You understand me now when I say that I cannot treat with your country? The honour of Russia is bound up with her friendship to France. Germany, on the other hand, has ready her battle cry.

60|$|But {{the eighteenth}} century saw another movement, all the more powerful, perhaps, because it was {{continually}} changing its shape, even its purpose; and gaining fresh life and <b>fresh</b> <b>adherents</b> with every change. Propagated at first by men {{of the school of}} Locke, it became at last a protest against the materialism of that school, on behalf of all that is, or calls itself, supernatural and mysterious. Abjuring, and honestly, all politics, it found itself sucked into the political whirlpool in spite of itself, as all human interests which have any life in them must be at last. It became an active promoter of the Revolution; then it helped to destroy the Revolution, when that had, under Napoleon, become a levelling despotism; then it helped, as actively, to keep revolutionary principles alive, after the reaction of 1815:--a Protean institution, whose power we in England are as apt to undervalue as the governments of the Continent were apt, during {{the eighteenth century}}, to exaggerate it. I mean, of course, Freemasonry, and the secret societies which, honestly and honourably disowned by Freemasonry, yet have either copied it, or actually sprung out of it. In England, Freemasonry never was, it seems, more than a liberal and respectable benefit-club; for secret societies are needless for any further purposes, amid free institutions and a free press. But on the Continent during the eighteenth century, Freemasonry excited profound suspicion and fear on the part of statesmen who knew perfectly well their friends from their foes; and whose precautions were, from their point of view, justified by the results.|$|R
50|$|Passaging (also {{known as}} {{subculture}} or splitting cells) involves transferring {{a small number}} of cells into a new vessel. Cells can be cultured for a longer time if they are split regularly, as it avoids the senescence associated with prolonged high cell density. Suspension cultures are easily passaged {{with a small amount of}} culture containing a few cells diluted in a larger volume of <b>fresh</b> media. For <b>adherent</b> cultures, cells first need to be detached; this is commonly done with a mixture of trypsin-EDTA; however, other enzyme mixes are now available for this purpose. A small number of detached cells can then be used to seed a new culture. Some cell cultures, such as RAW cells are mechanically scraped from the surface of their vessel with rubber scrapers.|$|R
40|$|AbstractBackgroundAortoenteric fistula is a {{communication}} between the aorta and adjacent bowel. It is rare, potentially fatal, and is difficult to diagnose and manage. These patients often present with a “herald bleed,” followed by massive gastrointestinal hemorrhage. Patient and methodsA 67 year old man presented with right upper quadrant pain, hematochezia and hypotension. Two months ago, the patient underwent elective open repair of an abdominal aortic aneurysm. On upper endoscopy, <b>fresh</b> blood and <b>adherent</b> clots were seen in the third/fourth portion of the duodenum. After some of the clots were gently washed off with water flushing, a fistula opening was seen on posterior superior wall of the duodenum. The fistula opening was surrounded by edematous duodenal mucosal. An aortoenteric fistula was highly suspected and the patient went to emergent laparotomy. ResultsDuring surgery, significant inflammation was noted surrounding the aorta with friable tissues of the aorta itself. A definite aortoenteric fistula was seen arising in the native aorta. Unfortunately, the patient expired due to cardiac vascular collapse. ConclusionsDiagnosis of aortoenteric fistula requires a high index of suspicion and careful history-taking. Endoscopic findings include adherent clots or bleeding at the fistula opening and/or eroded vascular graft or stent into the bowel...|$|R
40|$|Cultured IFN-γ ELISPOT assays are {{primarily}} {{a measure of}} central memory T cell (Tcm) responses with humans; however, this important subset of lymphocytes is poorly characterized in cattle. Vaccine-elicited cultured IFN-γ ELISPOT responses correlate with protection against bovine tuberculosis in cattle. However, whether this assay measures cattle Tcm responses or not is uncertain. The objective {{of the present study}} was to characterize the relative contribution of Tcm (CCR 7 +, CD 62 Lhi, CD 45 RO+), T effector memory (Tem, defined as: CCR 7 -, CD 62 Llow/int, CD 45 RO+), and T effector cells (CCR 7 -, CD 62 L-/low, CD 45 RO-), in the immune response to Mycobacterium bovis. Peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMC) from infected cattle were stimulated with a cocktail of M. bovis purified protein derivative, rTb 10. 4 and rAg 85 A for 13 days with periodic addition of fresh media and rIL- 2. On day 13, cultured PBMC were re-stimulated with medium alone, rESAT- 6 :CFP 10 or PPDb with <b>fresh</b> autologous <b>adherent</b> cells for antigen presentation. Cultured cells (13 days) or fresh PBMCs (ex vivo response) from the same calves were analyzed for IFN-γ production, proliferation, and CD 4, CD 45 RO, CD 62 L, CD 44, and CCR 7 expression via flow cytometry after overnight stimulation. In response to mycobacterial antigens, ~ 75 % of CD 4 + IFN-γ+ cells in long-term cultures expressed a Tcm phenotype while less than 10 % of the ex vivo response consisted of Tcm cells. Upon re-exposure to antigen, long-term cultured cells were highly proliferative, a distinctive characteristic of Tcm, and the predominant phenotype within the long-term cultures switched from Tcm to Tem. These findings suggest that proliferative responses of Tcm cells to some extent occurs simultaneously with reversion to effector phenotypes (mostly Tem). The present study characterizes Tcm cells of cattle and their participation in the response to M. bovis infection...|$|R

40|$|<b>Fresh</b> and aged <b>adherent</b> T pallidum {{were used}} to study the {{accessibility}} of their outer membrane to antibodies {{by means of an}} indirect immunofluorescent technique. The integrity of the outer membrane was demonstrated by the non-reactivity with a monoclonal antibody directed against the axial filaments. Using the sera from patients with sero-positive primary and secondary syphilis no binding of IgG and IgM antibodies was observed. However, IgG and IgM antibody fractions isolated from the sera of patients with secondary syphilis, gave with the fresh fibroblast-adhering treponemes a mean of 14. 5 % IgG- and of 43. 2 % IgM positive treponemes. These means were 32. 1 % and 87. 3 % respectively for aged treponemes. Lower percentages were observed when fibronectin adhering treponemes were used. This demonstrates the inability of the outer membrane to bind antibodies in a majority of the fresh treponemes. This is partly lost on in vitro aging. Absence of IgG- and IgM fluorescence was also observed when sequential incubations with the antibody fractions and control sera were used. This was accompanied by the deposition of the third complement factor (C 3) around the treponemes. Incubations of IgG- or IgM pre-coated adherent treponemes with heat-inactivated control sera or a C 3 deficient serum did not result in the deposition of C 3, and partially restored the detection of human antibodies. The most likely explanation for the absence of fluorescence is that antibodies become buried in an extra-cellular layer of serum proteins. The deposition of C 3 from control sera alone most probably points to the classical pathway of complement activation and suggests that antibodies of rabbit origin constitute a part of the extracellular layer of treponemes...|$|R
