5|$|In the 1840s, Johor {{began to}} receive the first Chinese {{settlers}} (mainly immigrants from Swatow and Chaozhou). The young Temenggong, Tun Daeng Ibrahim, took up the administrative tasks of the state. He imposed taxes upon these settlers, which went to the Temenggong's charge. However, unlike the Temenggong, Sultan Ali was unwilling to involve himself with {{the affairs of the}} state {{but at the same time}} complained of receiving insufficient allowance from the British. He was well known for <b>his</b> <b>penchant</b> for an extravagant lifestyle, and was chalking up considerable debts by the 1850s.|$|E
5|$|Johnson {{served as}} Vice President from March 4, 1837, to March 4, 1841. His term was largely unremarkable, and he enjoyed little {{influence}} with President Van Buren. <b>His</b> <b>penchant</b> for wielding his power {{for his own}} interests did not abate. He lobbied the Senate to promote Samuel Milroy, whom he owed a favor, {{to the position of}} Indian agent. When Lewis Tappan requested presentation of an abolitionist petition to the Senate, Johnson, who was still a slaveholder, declined the request.|$|E

He writes, [...] "I {{began to}} exude some kind of masculinity, in the way I tossed up and caught my eraser, for instance." [...] In another incident, Cal discusses how <b>his</b> <b>penchants</b> were masculine. While his female classmates are {{turned off by the}} blood in the Iliad, Cal is [...] "thrilled to [...] the stabbings and beheadings, the gouging out of eyes, the juicy eviscerations." [...] Cal ponders his gender identity and how males and females associate with each other, reflecting, [...] "Did I see through the male tricks because I was destined to scheme that way myself? Or do girls see through the tricks, too, and just pretend not to notice?" ...|$|R
5|$|Olds was {{promoted}} to brigadier general after returning from Vietnam but did not hold another major command. The remainder of his career was spent in non-operational positions, as Commandant of Cadets at the United States Air Force Academy and as an official in the Air Force Inspector General's Office. His inability to rise higher as a general officer is attributed to both his maverick views and <b>his</b> <b>penchant</b> for drinking.|$|E
5|$|Upon his {{entry to}} William Knibb Memorial High School, Bolt {{continued}} {{to focus on}} other sports, but his cricket coach noticed Bolt's speed on the pitch and urged him to try track and field events. Pablo McNeil, a former Olympic sprint athlete, and Dwayne Jarrett coached Bolt, encouraging him to focus his energy on improving his athletic abilities. The school {{had a history of}} success in athletics with past students, including sprinter Michael Green. Bolt won his first annual high school championships medal in 2001, taking the silver medal in the 200 metres with a time of 22.04 seconds. McNeil soon became his primary coach, and the two enjoyed a positive partnership, although McNeil was occasionally frustrated by Bolt's lack of dedication to his training and <b>his</b> <b>penchant</b> for practical jokes.|$|E

He also filed Chapter 11 bankruptcy proceedings in 2010 when a bank called a note due and tried to foreclose on his horses. Zayat Stables successfully completed its Chapter 11 reorganization, but Zayat was next plagued by legal issues related to <b>his</b> <b>penchant</b> for betting {{large sums of money}} on horse racing. Nonetheless, Zayat generated considerable positive publicity on social media for his efforts to save his racehorse Paynter from life-threatening health problems, a successful struggle that earned the colt the 2012 NTRA Moment of the Year Award and Secretariat Vox Populi Award.|$|E

5|$|Many of the game's non-player {{characters}} (NPCs) are companion characters, {{who appear}} throughout {{the game and}} may volunteer their services. Companions include Alistair, a reluctantly heroic Grey Warden with a sarcastic wit; Morrigan, a sultry but cynical dark mage who has little regard for authority or social mores; Leliana, an ex-member of Ferelden's Chantry whose optimistic and virtuous demeanor belies an aptitude for espionage and combat; Sten, a proud but stoic warrior of the militaristic Qunari people who often questions human ways; Oghren, a brutal dwarven warrior whose love of alcohol is only matched by <b>his</b> <b>penchant</b> for violence and loyalty to his friends; Wynne, an Elder Mage of the Circle, a maternal figure to the party and a powerful healer; Zevran, a rakish elven assassin who is fond of treasures, sex and innuendo; and a loyal Mabari War Hound, which the player can name and use for scouting and combat.

In the fourth season, Buffy begins attending college, where she discovers that her psychology professor, Walsh, is a scientist for the Initiative. Adam is Dr. Walsh's horrible masterpiece, an allusion to Frankenstein's monster, whose first conscious act is killing his creator. Adam's search for understanding himself and his true nature, combined for <b>his</b> <b>penchant</b> for chaos, leads him to orchestrate a massacre between demons and humans, after which {{he will be able}} use body parts left over from the melee to create an army of monsters to set loose on Sunnydale. Buffy's effectiveness as a Slayer is increased because her close friends and family, called the Scooby Gang, assist her in her battles. By the end of season four the members of the group have become estranged and must come back together in order to defeat the apparently invincible Adam.|$|E

50|$|The {{majority}} of Barnbrook's art work {{focuses on the}} theme of landscape, either by representation or choreography and cinemagraphics and much of his output has been characterised by <b>his</b> particular <b>penchant</b> for the environment and his interpretive response to the natural world. This is particularly evident in his large scale water-colours, which together with sculpture, are his favoured media.|$|R
50|$|Kammula {{sat with}} Veturi for writing songs for the film. Kammula {{said that he}} could see {{thousands}} of expressions expressed as a couple of words in lyrics.

5000|$|Water and Lights is {{the fifth}} album by the jazz pianist Paul Hanmer. It is more {{reminiscent}} of Abdullah Ibrahim than Keith Jarrett especially with occasional guitar moments that evoke echoes of George Benson. Jazzy and more discordant than his previous work, Salivation Army {{and to a lesser}} extent Calling the names of God nonetheless remind of <b>his</b> signature <b>penchant</b> for sweet melody.|$|R
25|$|In the mid 20th century, as {{pressure}} {{built to}} express a uniquely Australian identity in music, composers such as John Antill and Peter Sculthorpe drew influence from nature and Aboriginal culture, and Richard Meale turned to south-east Asian music.

2500|$|One {{of the few}} {{depictions of}} a real person, the infamous {{criminal}} Mark 'Chopper' Read (Franklin) appears as a special guest in various incongruous situations, such as reading a story for children a la Play School or calling numbers for bingo. Much of the humour in Chopper's segments derives from <b>his</b> <b>penchants</b> for swearing and violence, {{as well as his}} lack of education, as demonstrated in the bingo sketch where he points out [...] "I can't even fuckin' count, and I'm gonna host bingo! It's just like bloody dingo but it's safer with your kids, isn't it?". Chopper also makes many threatening statements directed at Neville Bartos, a character based on a real person who the real Chopper allegedly shot before going to prison, but with whom Chopper is now good friends. Franklin's portrayal of Read is as much based on the real Chopper as it is on Eric Bana's take on the man as portrayed in the 2000 Andrew Dominik film of the same name.|$|R

25|$|Abueva's struggles {{seemed to}} {{continue}} towards the next season.

25|$|Because of <b>his</b> <b>penchant</b> for biting social {{criticism}} and satire, Bierce's long newspaper career was often steeped in controversy. On several occasions his columns stirred {{up a storm}} of hostile reaction, which created difficulties for Hearst.

The title was a reference to how BBV had never obtained a license from the BBC to produce official Doctor Who tie-in material and therefore had to create works that only narrowly avoided infringing the BBC's intellectual property rights.|$|R

50|$|Simchowitz is {{a popular}} target for critics who claim that <b>his</b> {{particular}} <b>penchant</b> for promoting young, undiscovered artists through bulk acquisitions of their work to later flip for profit destabilizes established workings {{of the art world}} — age-old, value-determining systems composed of a long-standing and tight network of critics, publications, universities, museums, and galleries that collectively define the nature of good art. He subverts this establishment by selling his curated acquisitions directly to a diverse network of wealthy clientele who trust his taste implicitly.|$|R
