50|$|Agrobacterium-mediated T-DNA {{transfer}} {{is widely used}} as a tool in biotechnology. In genetic engineering, the tumor-promoting and opine-synthesis genes are removed from the T-DNA and replaced with a gene of interest and/or a selection marker, which is required to establish which plants have been successfully transformed. Examples of selection markers include neomycin phosphotransferase, <b>hygromycin</b> B phosphotransferase (which both phosphorylate antibiotics) and phosphinothricin acetyltransferase (which acetylates and deactivates phosphinothricin, a potent inhibitor of glutamine synthetase). Agrobacterium is then used as a vector to transfer the engineered T-DNA into the plant cells where it integrates into the plant genome. This method {{can be used to}} generate transgenic plants carrying a foreign gene.|$|E
50|$|A {{selectable}} marker is {{carried by the}} vector to allow the selection of positively transformed cells. Antibiotic resistance is often used as marker, an example being the beta-lactamase gene, which confers resistance to the penicillin group of beta-lactam antibiotics like ampicillin. Some vectors contain two {{selectable marker}}s, for example the plasmid pACYC177 has both ampicillin and kanamycin resistance gene. Shuttle vector {{which is designed to}} be maintained in two different organisms may also require two selectable markers, although some selectable markers such as resistance to zeocin and <b>hygromycin</b> B are effective in different cell types. Auxotrophic selection markers that allow an auxotrophic organism to grow in minimal growth medium may also be used; examples of these are LEU2 and URA3 which are used with their corresponding auxotrophic strains of yeast.|$|E
5000|$|Given the {{abundance}} of xylose and its potential for the bioconversion of lignocellulosic materials to renewable fuels, Pichia stipitis has been extensively studied. The complete sequencing of its genome was announced in 2007. Native strains of S. stipitis {{have been shown to}} produce ≈50 g/l ethanol in 48 h from pure xylose in defined minimal medium using urea as a nitrogen source. S. stipitis is a predominantly haploid yeast but strains can be induced to mate with themselves or with other strains of S. stipitis by cultivating cells on minimal medium containing limiting amounts of carbon sources and nitrogen. An extensive genetic toolbox has been developed for S. stipitis that includes synthetic drug resistance markers for nourseothricin acetyltransferase gene (nat1), <b>hygromycin</b> (hph) and a synthetic form of Cre that enables excision of the markers. Engineered strains of S. stipitis will produce 57 g/l ethanol from pure xylose in under 48 h and adapted strains will produce significant amounts of ethanol from acid hydrolysates of lignocellulose.|$|E

40|$|Abstract We have {{evaluated}} {{the effects of}} the antibiotic <b>hygromycin</b> B on cotton (Gossypium hirsutum L.) callus induction, callus proliferation, and seed germination. Nontransgenic cotyledon and hypocotyl showed obvious variance in tolerance to <b>hygromycin.</b> Cotyledons were more sensitive to <b>hygromycin</b> than hypocotyls. <b>Hygromycin</b> at 7. 5 and 20 mg l − 1 completely inhibited callus initiation from cotyledon and hypocotyl explants, respectively. Nontransformed calli did not grow on media supplemented with 10 mg l − 1 <b>hygromycin</b> and were killed at 15 mg l − 1. In seed germination assay, the presence of 20 mg l − 1 <b>hygromycin</b> significantly suppressed shoot and root elongation of seedlings. This <b>hygromycin</b> concentration was applied to select regenerated transgenic plantlets and their progenies. Based on these results, we developed an efficient <b>hygromycin</b> selection protocol for Agrobacterium-mediated cotton transformation and regeneration...|$|E
40|$|<b>Hygromycin</b> is an {{efficient}} selective agent in transformation studies of wide ranges of crop. In this study, different concentrations of <b>hygromycin</b> {{were used to}} observe the effect on untransformed calli death, percent germination and seedling growth of three rice varieties (Oryza sativa L.) viz BRRI dhan 29, MR 219 and Taipei 309. <b>Hygromycin</b> killed the untransformed calli and inhibited the germination of tested varieties in a concentration dependent manner. Among the tested varieties, the lowest and the highest calli death was observed in MR 219 and Taipei 309 respectively in all the concentrations of <b>hygromycin.</b> Whereas, the highest and the lowest percent germination were observed in MR 219 and Taipei 309 respectively. The minimal inhibitory concentration (MIC) for selection of calli were calculated as 42, 40 and 47 mg/L <b>hygromycin</b> for BRRI dhan 29, MR 219 and Taipei 309 respectively. During germination, 35, 62 and 32 mg/L <b>hygromycin</b> were suitable for the selection of BRRI dhan 29, MR 219 and Taipei 309 respectively. Shoot and root growth reduction after germination was increased with the increased concentration of <b>hygromycin.</b> Besides, root growth was more sensitive to <b>hygromycin</b> than the shoot. These results suggest that <b>hygromycin</b> increases calli death, decreases percent germination, and shoot and root growth in all varieties with the increasing rate of <b>hygromycin.</b> But these characteristics vary with different degrees in different genotypes as well as different stages...|$|E
40|$|<b>Hygromycin</b> B is an {{aminoglycoside}} antibiotic active against prokaryotic and eukaryotic ribosomes. Ribosomal {{alterations in}} bacteria conferring resistance to <b>hygromycin</b> B {{have not been}} described, prompting us to use a single rRNA allelic derivative of the gram-positive bacterium Mycobacterium smegmatis for investigation of the molecular mechanisms involved in ribosomal resistance to <b>hygromycin</b> B in eubacteria. Resistance mutations were found to localize exclusively in 16 S rRNA. The mutations observed, i. e., 16 S rRNA U 1406 C, C 1496 U, and U 1498 C (E. coli numbering), are {{in close proximity to}} the <b>hygromycin</b> B binding site located in conserved helix 44 of 16 S rRNA.

Cells which are infected with MHV do not take up higher levels of <b>hygromycin</b> B than do uninfected ones. Comparative assays of MHV replication and MHV protein synthesis in the presence of <b>hygromycin</b> B and another aminoglycoside, neomycin, indicate that <b>hygromycin</b> B is the more-effective antiviral agent and that its antiviral activity likely does not involve phosphoinositide-mediated processes such as those inhibited by neomycin...|$|E
40|$|Protoplasts of Festuca arundinacea (Schreb.) were {{transformed}} with plasmids containing a <b>hygromycin</b> resistance gene, and plants were regenerated under {{a variety of}} selection regimes.

Continuous selection at low concentrations of <b>hygromycin</b> produced the highest numbers of transgenic plants without escapes. Transgene copy numbers for 83 plants were estimated and related to the selection regime under which the plants were regenerated. Discontinuous application of <b>hygromycin</b> produced a high proportion of plants containing two or fewer inserted copies of the transgene (87 %), as did low levels (50 mg?l? 1) of continuous selection on <b>hygromycin</b> (88 %).
