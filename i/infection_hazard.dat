Sharp force hazards categorize any bodily harm from the use of tools and equipment such as scalpels and needles which resulting in cuts or punctures. Electrical hazards encompass any potential harm in the form of shock from the use of equipment like saws or defibrillators. Chemical hazards include harm from the use of a variety of chemicals used in the autopsy process such as cyanide and formaldehyde.

30|$|Other {{limitations}} of this study include preparation method. Our results may not be translated to other settings where these methods differ. Furthermore, among ICU centres there is variability in ICU-specific factors, which can lead to heterogeneity in nosocomial <b>infection</b> <b>hazard</b> rates. Of these, the use of SDD may be the most important. Whether the results in this paper can be extrapolated to centres that do not use SDD remains to be determined. Lastly, although we accounted for exposure bias that is a well-known confounder in studies investigating risk factors for nosocomial infection, standard Cox regression analysis is limited in correcting for time-dependent bias and competing risks. However, this study also has strong aspects. We investigated the association between transfusion products and nosocomial infection with a prospective study design, using a structured evaluation of all infectious events, to minimize the potential sources of bias and confounding. In addition, our study is characterized by a large sample size. Furthermore, the independent effect on nosocomial infections was studied for each type of transfusion product separately.|$|E

40|$|Our {{ability to}} infer unobservable disease-dynamic {{processes}} such as force of infection (<b>infection</b> <b>hazard</b> for susceptible hosts) has transformed our understanding of disease transmission mechanisms and capacity to predict disease dynamics. Conventional methods for inferring FOI estimate a time-averaged value and are based on population-level processes. Because many pathogens exhibit epidemic cycling and FOI {{is the result of}} processes acting across the scales of individuals and populations, a flexible framework that extends to epidemic dynamics and links within-host processes to FOI is needed. Specifically, within-host antibody kinetics in wildlife hosts can be short-lived and produce patterns that are repeatable across individuals, suggesting individual-level antibody concentrations could be used to infer time since infection and hence FOI. Using simulations and case studies (influenza A in lesser snow geese and Yersinia pestis in coyotes), we argue that with careful experimental and surveillance design, the population-level FOI signal can be recovered from individual-level antibody kinetics, despite substantial individual-level variation. In addition to improving inference, the cross-scale quantitative antibody approach we describe can reveal insights into drivers of individual-based variation in disease response, and the role of poorly understood {{processes such as}} secondary infections, in population-level dynamics of disease...|$|E

For equal sample volumes of pool water containing adequate free chlorine residual, VJ agar was found to be more selective for staphylococcal species and less inhibitory to general cell growth than was BP agar. However, neither medium was found to be sufficiently differential to permit the accurate identification of S. aureus. In contrast, water samples obtained from a swimming pool containing very low levels of chlorine (none of which was in the free form) showed abundant growth of staphylococci on both test media, with both VJ and BP agars showing increased sensitivity for the detection of S. aureus.

This study aimed {{to determine the}} effectiveness of antifungal prophylaxis for patients receiving OLT. Patients and Methods. This is a retrospective analysis of a database at Chang Gung Memorial Hospital. We have been administering routine antibiotic and prophylactic antifungal regimens to recipients with high model for end-stage liver disease scores (> 20) since 2009.

The cumulative hazards and transition probability of “transplantation to fungal infection” were lower in the prophylaxis group. The incidence rate of fungal infection after OLT decreased from 18. 9 % to 11. 4 % (p= 0. 052); overall mortality improved from 40. 8 % to 23. 4 % (p< 0. 001).

40|$|Objective: The {{objective}} {{was to determine the}} safety of ocrelizumab (OCR) in patients with rheumatoid arthritis (RA). Methods: This was an analysis of the double-blind, placebo-controlled periods and long-term follow-up of 4 OCR phase III trials in RA (SCRIPT, STAGE, FILM and FEATURE). Safety data per study and the results of a meta-analysis of serious infectious events (SIEs) are presented. Results: Overall, 868 patients received placebo, 1064 patients OCR 200 mg 62 (or 400 mg 61) (OCR 200), and 827 patients OCR 500 mg 62 (OCR 500) plus background methotrexate (MTX) at baseline and 24 weeks. During the double-blind, placebo-controlled periods, the incidence of adverse events and serious adverse events was comparable between the OCR+ MTX and placebo +MTX groups. Infusion-related reactions were more common with OCR+MTX and decreased in frequency with subsequent infusions. Serious infusion-related reactions were rare (0. 1 %). Serious infections occurred more frequently with OCR 500 +MTX. In the meta-analysis, a statistically significant difference from placebo +MTX in incidence of SIEs per 100 patient-years of 2. 4 (95 % CI, 0. 3 – 4. 5) was observed with OCR 500 +MTX, but not with OCR 200 +MTX (0. 6; 95 % CI, 21. 3 to 2. 4). Patients recruited in Asia exhibited a higher risk of serious <b>infections</b> (<b>hazard</b> ratio, 1. 78; 95 % CI, 1. 03 – 3. 06). The incidence of human anti-human antibodies was, 5 %. Long-term follow-up indicated no differences in malignancy rates between the treatment groups. There was no apparent difference in time to B-cell repletion between the OCR dose groups...|$|R
40|$|Background: Infectious {{disease is}} {{a leading cause of}} {{morbidity}} and hospitalization for infants and children. During infancy, breast-feeding protects against infectious diseases, particularly respiratory infections, gastrointestinal infections, and otitis media. Little is known about the longer-term impact of breast-feeding on infectious disease in children. Methods: We investigated the relationship between infant feeding and childhood hospitalizations from respiratory and gastrointestinal infections in a population-based birth cohort of 8327 children born in 1997 and followed for 8 years. The main outcomes were public hospital admissions for respiratory infections, gastrointestinal infections, and all infectious diseases. Cox regression was used to assess time to first hospitalization. Results: Breast-feeding only (no formula-feeding) for 3 or more months was associated with a lower risk of hospital admission in the first 6 months of life for respiratory <b>infections</b> (<b>hazard</b> ratio = 0. 64 [95 % confidence interval = 0. 42 - 0. 97]), gastrointestinal infections (0. 51 [0. 25 - 1. 05]), and any infection (0. 61 [0. 44 - 0. 85]), adjusted for sex, type of hospital at birth, and household income. Partial breast-feeding (both breast-feeding and formula-feeding) in the first 3 months also reduced hospitalizations from infections but with smaller effect sizes. Beyond 6 months of age, there was no association between breast-feeding status at 3 months and hospitalization for infectious disease. Conclusions: Giving breast milk and no formula for at least 3 months substantially reduced hospital admissions for many infectious diseases in the first 6 months of life, when children are most vulnerable. © 2010 by Lippincott Williams & Wilkins. postprin...|$|R
