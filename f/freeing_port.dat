50|$|Towards {{the end of}} the 14th century, ships {{like the}} carrack began to develop towers on the bow and stern. These towers {{decreased}} the vessel's stability, and in the 15th century, the caravel, designed by the Portuguese, based on the Arabic qarib which could sail closer to the wind, became more widely used. The towers were gradually replaced by the forecastle and sterncastle, as in the carrack Santa María of Christopher Columbus. This increased freeboard allowed another innovation: the <b>freeing</b> <b>port,</b> and the artillery associated with it.In the 16th century, the use of freeboard and freeing ports became widespread on galleons.|$|E

30|$|The {{external}} factor {{involves the}} political and administrative context of the <b>free</b> <b>port.</b> <b>Free</b> <b>ports</b> exist because there are frictions to international trade created by boundaries between different regulatory regimes (Lavissière, 2014) and as such <b>free</b> <b>ports</b> provide a form of extraterritoriality as well as logistical services to mitigate these frictions. Therefore, {{the evolution of the}} institutions that generate administrative frictions and customs barriers has had an influence on the evolution of <b>free</b> <b>ports.</b> Early <b>free</b> <b>ports</b> were connecting two customs areas outside of their own. Then, <b>free</b> <b>ports</b> developed within nation states. This changed the trade function because <b>free</b> <b>ports</b> became a link between domestic legal provisions and the outside. French <b>free</b> <b>ports</b> in the mercantilist era, and later on Spanish <b>free</b> <b>ports</b> and American Foreign Trade Zones are examples of entities set to mitigate the complexity of domestic customs and global markets.|$|R

30|$|This paper aims rationalizing the {{complexity}} of <b>free</b> <b>ports.</b> It {{is based on a}} wide array of empirical observations and an analysis of structure, function and evolution of <b>free</b> <b>ports.</b> Collected <b>free</b> <b>ports</b> data enabled the identification of three constitutive factors of evolution: an external factor (the jurisdiction), an internal factor (the services provided) and a linking factor (the orientation of flows). Based on these three factors a model of <b>free</b> <b>ports</b> was designed with a typology of thirteen types of <b>free</b> <b>ports,</b> an explanation of their evolution, and their future prospects.|$|R
40|$|Freeing ports {{on fishing}} vessels are a {{significant}} safety feature. They are designed to reduce the build up of green water on deck {{that may lead to}} loss of stability. At a more mundane level they reduce wetness on decks that are the working platforms for the fishers. Wet decks that are moving working platforms are clearly a hazard. The present study deals more with the build up of water on deck rather than just general deck wetness. It attempts to quantify the amount of water on deck for different <b>freeing</b> <b>port</b> configurations, using parameters such as number of freeing ports, <b>freeing</b> <b>port</b> areas, deck area etc. The study uses numerical simulations to evaluate these parameters. One particular vessel has been used throughout the study, namely a typical fibreglass 65 foot fishing vessel of recent design. The main conclusions of the study are that generally there is not a great deal of difference between the amounts of water on deck for the different <b>freeing</b> <b>port</b> configurations. Although larger freeing ports allow more water on deck if the ingress and egress of water flowing through the freeing ports is unhindered in both directions, for freeing ports fitted with some device (such as 2 ̆ 018 flaps 2 ̆ 019) that hinders the in-flow but not the out-flow then having larger freeing ports is shown to be beneficial. The benefits here are more to do with stability than general deck wetness. It is in fact clear from some of the results that larger freeing ports lead to wetter decks. The motions of the vessel in the study with water on deck have been evaluated and it is shown that different <b>freeing</b> <b>port</b> configurations can lead to different motions of the vessel, particularly {{in the early stages of}} flooding.

40|$|Water {{collected}} on decks due to waves or result of accidental structural damages cause loss of stability {{by what is}} known as the free surface effects. This study focuses on the modeling of the discharge of the collected water in order to establish relationships between the geometrical characteristics of an open deck or damaged hull - its beam, height of the gap (e. g. <b>freeing</b> <b>port)</b> - and wave parameters such as wave length and wave height. A two-dimensional model of the discharge was constructed to visualize the free surface and to measure the flow discharge from a flat bottom. In this study, lengths corresponding to the flooded width of the ship, initial water height corresponding to the collected amount of water on deck and discharge gap height corresponding to the <b>freeing</b> <b>port</b> opening were varied systematically. The time domain discharge flow pattern and free surface form were recorded with a digital camera. The digitized frames were captured on a computer and the location and the form of the free surface were computed. The change in volume, discharge rate velocity at the <b>freeing</b> <b>port</b> and various parameters of the discharge kinematics were calculated from knowledge of the free surface. Additionally, CFD solutions to the problem were carried out. This paper reports some of the findings related to the variation of the discharge gap height and tank length.

40|$|In this study, {{experimental}} results on water collection and discharge from an opening on a floating body at sea are reported. The {{objectives of the}} tests were to establish relationships between the geometrical characteristics of an open deck or a damaged hull - its beam, height of the discharge gap (e. g. <b>freeing</b> <b>port)</b> - and wave parameters such as wavelength and wave height. Two separate series of experiments were designed and models constructed for water discharge and collection. A two-dimensional model for water discharge experiments was built to visualize the free surface and to measure the flow discharge from a tank. Additionally, {{for the study of}} water collection experiments, a similar plexi-glass model was constructed. This model was used to measure time dependent volume of water accumulation on deck. The amount of water collected inside the plexi-glass tank was measured by four load-cells, at different tank opening heights and wave frequencies and amplitudes.

30|$|The {{evolution}} of <b>free</b> <b>ports</b> along with globalization of trade is another major factor. The adaptation of <b>free</b> <b>ports</b> to wider ranges of services {{in order to}} cope with evolutions of supply chains is another factor.

30|$|Interviews {{have been}} {{conducted}} from 2007 to 2015 as part of ongoing research projects on <b>free</b> <b>ports.</b> More than 50 interviews {{have been conducted}} in 17 countries on 4 continents (Brazil, Cameroon, China, France, French Guyana, Germany, Madagascar, Malaysia, Mauritius, Morocco, Panama, Singapore, Spain, Tunisia, UAE, UK, and USA.) Interviewees were government agents, free zone administrators, customs officers, investors, logisticians, manufacturers and operators of <b>free</b> <b>ports.</b> In most of the countries direct observation of the <b>free</b> <b>ports</b> was possible and brought valuable data. Finally, in few <b>free</b> <b>ports</b> (Mauritius <b>Free</b> <b>Port,</b> Ehoala Park, Tangier-Med, Manaus Suframa, Radès, and Kribi) participant observations was possible due to the involvement in audits, creation, restructuration or development of <b>free</b> <b>ports,</b> during consulting missions.

40|$|This paper {{describes}} {{the results of}} a series of experiments on a simplified model of a 160 m RO-RO ferry, after SOLAS damage. The model was a prismatic shape, primarily to allow for a direct comparison with numerical simulations. The model was tested for a range of residual freeboards from 0. 5 to 1. 5 metres, and a vertical centre of gravity range to cover values expected from typical existing ships and ships designed to meet SOLAS 90 regulations. The model was tested with and without a centreline casing and {{for a wide range of}} <b>freeing</b> <b>port</b> areas. Some tests were carried out with flapped covers on the freeing ports, to prevent water flowing onto the deck through the freeing ports, and some tests were carried out with permanently open freeing ports. For each condition, the highest waveheight that the model could survive and lowest waveheight that caused a capsize were determined. Peer reviewed: NoNRC publication: Ye...|$|E
40|$|The sinkings of the European Gateway, the Herald of Free Enterprise and the Estonia have {{highlighted}} {{the potential for}} tragedy when water floods the car deck of RO-RO ferries. Transport Canada, through the Marine Safety Directorate and the Transportation Development Centre, sponsored model experiments {{to evaluate the effectiveness}} of the current SOLAS regulations and to determine if they can be safely relaxed when applied to domestic ships operating in sheltered waters. The first model tested was a prismatic hull, with the overall dimensions and stability characteristics of a 160 m ferry. The subject of this paper is the results for the second model tested which was a simplified ship shaped hull with a waterline length of approximately 87 metres. The basic hull form was derived from smaller ferries, but was modified to be symmetrical about midships. The program of experiments was carried out over ranges of residual freeboard, vertical centre of gravity and area of freeing ports (fitted with flaps). The estimated maximum significant waveheight that the ship will survive is presented against various stability parameters and <b>freeing</b> <b>port</b> areas. The limits of survivability are evaluated against the current SOLAS requirements, and are also compared with the findings from the Joint North West European R&D Project 'Safety of Passenger/RO-RO Vessels'. These results were developed from ships with fully enclosed car decks, rather than typical North American designs. Peer reviewed: YesNRC publication: Ye...|$|E
40|$|The {{survival}} {{capability of}} damaged ships under dynamic sea conditions {{has been the}} subject of technical investigations since the early 1 9 W's. Building upon this base of knowledge, a research program was initiated in Canada to investigate the prime factors affecting the survival of Ro-Ro passenger ferries when flooded symmetrically after damage at midship. This effort would form an initial phase in the development of criteria for assessing Ro-Ro capsize safety after damage in sea states. A comprehensive model test program was devised to systematically examine the capsize phenomenon in sea states up to 7 metres significant wave height, using a model which replicated the design characteristics and proportions of large Canadian flag ferries. The vertical centre of gravity of the model was varied over a range of test conditions which met SOLAS 90 damage stability criteria. Using time history traces and summary data sheets, the test results were analysed to identify patterns of repeatable behaviour. Examined were the maximum upright and minimum capsize conditions of the ship in each test case. Prime variables used to make assessments under dynamic sea conditions are metacentric height and dynamic stability in the damaged condition. conclusions are drawn using these prime variables with respect to their relationship to residual freeboard after damage, <b>freeing</b> <b>port</b> area and presence of a centreline casing. In addition, findings are made on the behaviour of water accumulation on the vehicle deck which may assist in establishing criteria serving to design for capsize prevention in the future.

30|$|The {{first factor}} {{emerging}} from the case study is customs extraterritoriality. This is the core characteristics of <b>free</b> <b>ports</b> {{and one that is}} present in every <b>free</b> <b>port</b> studied, although it evolved in time. Customs extraterritoriality is a juridical factor making the link between the structure of the <b>free</b> <b>port</b> and its environment. This factor alone, however, is not sufficient to explain the evolution of <b>free</b> <b>ports</b> and their wide variety. Moreover, the reduction of customs barriers with the GATT and then the WTO, while <b>free</b> <b>ports</b> were growing in number proves that the sole customs extraterritoriality is not fully explaining the issue.|$|R
30|$|Several {{questions}} {{remains to}} be answered. First, under what circumstances are the decisions made to open, to expand {{as well as to}} close a <b>free</b> <b>port?</b> For instance, in 2013 Hamburg forfeited its <b>free</b> <b>port</b> status, which it held for centuries. This underlines that the arbitrage that the <b>free</b> <b>port</b> provided was no longer judged to be valuable enough to maintain. Another example being post-Brexit UK striving to create <b>free</b> <b>ports</b> in order to position itself as a major supply chain link between the Commonwealth and the E.U. (Sunak, 2016). This underlines that <b>free</b> <b>ports</b> could even thrive in a global context of potential trade restrictions since their arbitrage function would be even more prevalent. Second, {{further research is needed to}} compare the different <b>free</b> <b>ports</b> models and identify macro-economic as well as geographical factors driving the development of a specific model. This could provide analytical and decision-making tools to better understand the dynamics of <b>free</b> <b>ports</b> and how they continue to support global trade and supply chains. It is also unclear how path dependent different <b>free</b> <b>port</b> models are, implying that once a <b>free</b> <b>port</b> has been established, to what extent it can evolve into new forms and new value propositions. Still, it is fairly surprising that in light of ongoing trade liberalization, including the setting of economic blocs, that <b>free</b> <b>ports</b> remain an active and even thriving element of global trade.|$|R
50|$|Some special {{economic}} {{zones are}} called <b>free</b> <b>ports.</b> Sometimes they {{have historically been}} endowed with favorable customs regulations such as the <b>free</b> <b>port</b> of Trieste. In recent years the <b>free</b> <b>port</b> system {{has been accused of}} facilitating international art crime, allowing stolen artworks to remain undetected in storage for decades.|$|R
30|$|<b>Free</b> <b>ports</b> {{are based}} on a form of exceptionalism which has existed since Antiquity. They have seen their role and {{function}} evolve to follow political, economic and technological developments, particularly as they relate to international trade routes. Because of these changes, some <b>free</b> <b>ports</b> disappeared while others gained and lost their importance with the ebb and flows of global trade. Globalization underlines the enduring fundamental niche that <b>free</b> <b>ports</b> play as international trade gateways, with most countries having a regulatory environment enabling <b>free</b> <b>ports,</b> with some actively promoting them. Their use remains a market strategy for actors seeking a form of arbitrage such as traders, transport and logistics companies and even financial firms. They have been effective tools of transnationalism as the examples of Shenzhen and Dubai underline. Yet, <b>free</b> <b>port</b> status does not guarantee economic development since there are numerous <b>free</b> <b>ports</b> that provided limited economic and trade impetus. The insertion of <b>free</b> <b>ports</b> within existing trade networks remains a key factor in their success, but this success is often observed afterwards.|$|R
30|$|The historical, {{structural}} and functional analyses of <b>free</b> <b>ports</b> mentioned above, {{made possible the}} identification of major factors describing {{the wide range of}} existing <b>free</b> <b>ports.</b>|$|R
3000|$|In addition, it {{is crucial}} to avoid {{confusion}} on what a <b>free</b> <b>port</b> is. <b>Free</b> <b>ports</b> are different from free trade zones, special economic zones and export processing zones, because they are logistic oriented free zones whatever their free zone status or name. <b>Free</b> <b>ports</b> are also different from the concepts of sea ports and port terminal; they are special logistics zones next to ports. The definition of <b>free</b> <b>port</b> from Lavissière et al. (2014) was retained. It states that ‘A <b>free</b> <b>port</b> is an international logistic interface that is free from border frictions and designed to bring more value in the global supply chains of its operators. This definition states that the <b>free</b> <b>port</b> is not the port, but the logistics facility ‘often next to a sea port but also next to or within an airport, a river port, or a dry port.’ [...]...|$|R
30|$|The {{evolution}} of the external factor follows three stages: a city state or depot stage, in which the <b>free</b> <b>port</b> {{does not belong to}} any customs entity; then a customs entity stage in which the <b>free</b> <b>ports</b> links an external customs area and a domestic customs area; and last a network of duty free zones connecting <b>free</b> <b>ports</b> inside or outside the same customs area.|$|R
30|$|The {{literature}} thus underlines {{a functional}} and modal specialization of <b>free</b> <b>ports.</b> <b>Free</b> <b>ports</b> are developed {{adjacent to a}} wide range of transport nodes, including sea ports, air ports, river ports, and dry ports (railyards). The relevance of <b>free</b> <b>ports</b> is underlined by the increasing number of countries developing them and the amount of Foreign Direct Investments (FDI) invested in these zones around the world (Farole, 2011).|$|R
30|$|In {{terms of}} organization, Lafargue (2008) points an {{evolution}} in the governance of <b>free</b> <b>ports</b> from publicly managed entities to landlord free zones, while Bost (2011) underlines the ongoing specialization of free zones to cater to specific supply chains. <b>Free</b> <b>ports</b> are evolving with the range of added value activities they provide from labor intensive to high value added products (Barbier and Véron, 1991). In the same manner, services offered by <b>free</b> <b>ports</b> are evolving to include ancillary services such as finance and insurance (Tiefenbrun, 2012). These organizational and marketing drivers represent the internal factors {{of the evolution of}} <b>free</b> <b>ports.</b>|$|R
30|$|At the microeconomic level, {{few studies}} show the {{advantages}} for {{users of the}} <b>free</b> <b>port.</b> This core function is briefly mentioned by Tiefenbrun (2012) in a list of advantages for users of American foreign trade zones. These advantages are mostly commercial, fiscal and financial. Lafargue (2008) explains there are different advantages and functions of the <b>free</b> <b>port</b> for the four categories of actors mentioned: State, Regulator, Developer and Users. Lavissière et al. (2014) explained that the main function of <b>free</b> <b>ports</b> is to reduce border frictions for international supply chains through fiscal, logistical and cultural advantages. Barbier and Véron (1991) incorporated several of these elements {{in order to show}} an evolution in time of the function of <b>free</b> <b>ports.</b> The more developed the <b>free</b> <b>port,</b> the wider services are.|$|R

50|$|The <b>Free</b> <b>Port</b> Act {{was passed}} in 1766 also in 1766 the Declaratory Act was passed with the Revenue Act of 1766 and more see list of acts of {{parliament}} and the Stamp Act was repealed with the Sugar act. The <b>free</b> <b>port</b> act stated that trade could be made with French and Spanish colonies. The <b>free</b> <b>port</b> act was a modified system in use by the French, and Dutch.|$|R
30|$|The {{internal}} factor {{relates to}} {{the function of the}} <b>free</b> <b>port</b> and the services it provides. Initially <b>free</b> <b>ports</b> were only a transloading infrastructure and many eventually developed as added value platforms. Hanseatic ports of the twelfth century brought transformation activities to the storage function. In time, <b>free</b> <b>ports</b> kept adding services of increasing complexity; from manufacturing to supply chain services and offshore banking facilities. Furthermore, in the twenty-first century a specialization emerged where the <b>free</b> <b>port</b> specializes in logistics and supply chain services while other adjacent zones are specializing in banking, IT services, or manufacturing. The <b>free</b> <b>port</b> focuses on its core competencies and becomes part of a local network of specialized free zones. From that perspective, three stages in the evolution and complexification of this internal factors can be identified; storage, transformation and logistics and supply chain services.|$|R

30|$|Today, few <b>free</b> <b>ports</b> {{remain at}} the level of a city state, but there are notable {{exceptions}} such as Singapore, Hong Kong, Malta and Dubai. Still, they belong to larger economic entities having a common customs regulatory regime. Nowadays, there are <b>free</b> <b>ports</b> connecting to a network of free zones. These <b>free</b> <b>ports</b> are incorporating different types of free zones such as industry and services into a ‘free zone area’. Mauritius, for instance, linked the free zones of its port and airport to industrial zones producing textile and then developed an IT dedicated free zone (Lavissière, 2014). All these zones are linked commercially but also physically within customs corridors (where flows are permitted on the domestic system as long as they go from one element of the free zone to another). Tanger-Med has a similar development strategy with its port, a planned airport, an automotive free zone, a logistics <b>free</b> <b>port,</b> an industrial <b>free</b> zone and an offshore banking free zone. This model illustrates a regionalization of <b>free</b> <b>ports</b> by permitting a specialization of the <b>free</b> <b>port</b> functions within the <b>free</b> <b>port</b> itself as well as through satellite facilities. Thus, the regulatory framework of <b>free</b> <b>ports</b> corresponds to infrastructural developments of transport terminals in regard to their hinterland. Tanger-Med and Barcelona Free Zone also signed an agreement on promotion, exchange of best practices and trade facilitation that creates a customs free corridor between the two entities. In the United States, free zones are technically networked since it is possible to move goods from one zone to another without disbursing custom duties. Still, this status is in its infancy at the transnational level and {{it remains to be seen}} the scale and extent <b>free</b> <b>ports</b> will create effective trade networks.|$|R

30|$|This paper {{provided}} a conceptualization of contemporary <b>free</b> <b>ports</b> and underlined three main factors explaining {{the evolution of}} <b>free</b> <b>ports,</b> which was concomitant with the evolution of international trade. They include the regulatory context, the function and trade orientation. These three factors helped articulate models explaining the development of <b>free</b> <b>ports</b> {{in a variety of}} contexts. In addition, these factors helped understand what drives the transition from one model to another. Based upon this evolution it is possible to infer about a prospective <b>free</b> <b>port</b> model that would involve networks of free trade clusters through strategic agreements. As such, the current trend underlines that trade gateways could further consolidate their role by networking their free zones with other gateways with which they have functional relations. This would obviously require more advanced forms of trade facilitation measures and customs agreements, but networked <b>free</b> <b>ports</b> would support more competitive supply chains, particularly if they enhance the complementarity of the trade relations they support. Therefore, stakeholders have active interests in supporting the emergence of these <b>free</b> <b>port</b> clusters. These decisions are likely going to be made where there is a strong complementarity in the value-added functions, particularly with reverse trade flows.|$|R
30|$|Trade flows {{underlines the}} nature and {{evolution}} of the trade supported by the <b>free</b> <b>port.</b> Initially, a <b>free</b> <b>port</b> {{was at the center}} of a regional trade system because transportation was only allowing trade over short distances, while long distance trade was marginal at best. This was particularly the case during the Middle Ages. During the mercantilism era, the scale and scope of trade routes expanded and many <b>free</b> <b>ports</b> developed as colonial outposts (Bost, 2010). While the trade routes were longer and more extensive, the <b>free</b> <b>port</b> remained mostly a point of transshipment between areas where goods were produced and colonial consumption markets. Globalization changed the organization of production and, therefore, the orientation of trade flows (Rodrigue, 2017). The spatial division of production and the growing reliance on logistics transformed the function of many <b>free</b> <b>ports</b> from single transloading points along sequential trade flows towards nodes within global value chains (Lavissière et al., 2016).|$|R
