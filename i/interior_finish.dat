25|$|The {{building}} is constructed out of recycled steel, aluminum and fly ash concrete. <b>Interior</b> <b>finish</b> materials were produced using sustainable methods with high-recycled content. The windows and storefront are locally manufactured, {{as is the}} metal exterior cladding. The exterior cladding of the building also includes FSC-Certified ipe wood. The interior minimizes the use of additional finish materials.|$|E
25|$|Heavy {{materials}} like stone, {{mortar and}} clay were abandoned as building elements, with simple wooden walls, floors and partitions becoming prevalent. Native species like cedar (sugi) were popular as an <b>interior</b> <b>finish</b> {{because of its}} prominent grain, while pine (matsu) and larch (aka matsu) were common for structural uses. Brick roofing tiles and a type of cypress called hinoki were used for roofs. It was sometime during this period that the hidden roof, a uniquely Japanese solution to roof drainage problems, was adopted.|$|E

25|$|Silver is also {{applied to}} copper {{by means of}} electroplating, and {{provides}} an <b>interior</b> <b>finish</b> {{that is at once}} smooth, more durable than either tin or nickel, relatively non-stick and extremely thermally efficient. Copper and silver bond extremely well owing to their shared high electro-conductivity. Lining thickness varies widely by maker, but averages between 7–10 microns. The disadvantages of silver are expense and the tendency of sulfurous foods, especially brassicas, to discolor. Worn silver linings on copper cookware can be restored by stripping and re-electroplating.|$|E
2500|$|In a {{few months}} the {{handsome}} exterior of the building was completed. Its dimensions were: [...] length, [...] width, [...] height; the upper story served as a church, and the lower served as a parochial school, divided into four rooms. The cost of building, exclusive of <b>interior</b> <b>finish,</b> was $16,000. As soon as the edifice was enclosed, a temporary altar was erected and plain chairs, in lieu of pews, were provided {{in one of the}} large rooms in the unplastered upper story, and divine service was held {{for the first time on}} Christmas, 1892. The parish school was opened in February, 1893, with a good attendance. Rosinski continued to attend St. Casimir's as a mission church until the appointment of Father P. M. Cerveny as first resident pastor, July 17, 1893. Under his direction, in November, 1893, only the ceilings were plastered, when part of the scaffolding collapsed, resulting in injury to some of the workmen; the work was then stopped for a time.|$|E
2500|$|In the {{carpentry}} industry, {{the timber}} {{is referred to}} as satin walnut [...] {{and is one of the}} most important materials for plywood manufacturers. It is used for furniture, interior trim, railroad ties, cigar boxes, crates, flooring, barrels, woodenware, and wood pulp. It is also used for veneer for plywood. The wood is very compact and fine-grained, the heartwood being reddish, and, when cut into planks, marked transversely with blackish belts. Sweetgum is used principally for lumber, veneer, plywood, slack cooperage, fuel, and pulpwood. The lumber is made into boxes and crates, furniture, cabinets for radios, televisions, and phonographs, interior trim, and millwork. The veneer and plywood, (typically backed with some other kind of wood which shrinks and warps less) are used for boxes, pallets, crates, baskets, and interior woodwork. [...] It was formerly used in the <b>interior</b> <b>finish</b> of railroad sleeping cars. Being readily dyed black, it is sometimes substituted for ebony for such uses as inexpensive picture frames.|$|E

2500|$|Indoor Air Quality {{seeks to}} reduce {{volatile}} organic compounds, or VOCs, and other air impurities such as microbial contaminants. Buildings {{rely on a}} properly designed ventilation system (passively/naturally or mechanically powered) to provide adequate ventilation of cleaner air from outdoors or recirculated, filtered air as well as isolated operations (kitchens, dry cleaners, etc.) from other occupancies. During the design and construction process choosing construction materials and <b>interior</b> <b>finish</b> products with zero or low VOC emissions will improve IAQ. Most building materials and cleaning/maintenance products emit gases, some of them toxic, such as many VOCs including formaldehyde. These gases can have a detrimental impact on occupants' health, comfort, and productivity. Avoiding these products will increase a building's IEQ. LEED, HQE and Green Star contain specifications on use of low-emitting interior. Draft LEED 2012 is about to expand {{the scope of the}} involved products. BREEAM limits formaldehyde emissions, no other VOCs. MAS Certified Green is a registered trademark to delineate low VOC-emitting products in the marketplace. The MAS Certified Green Program ensures that any potentially hazardous chemicals released from manufactured products have been thoroughly tested and meet rigorous standards established by independent toxicologists to address recognized long term health concerns. These IAQ standards have been adopted by and incorporated into the following programs: (1) The United States Green Building Council (USGBC) in their LEED rating system (2) The California Department of Public Health (CDPH) in their section 01350 standards [...] (3) The Collaborative for High Performance Schools (CHPS) in their Best Practices Manual and (4) The Business and Institutional Furniture Manufacturers Association (BIFMA) in their level® sustainability standard.|$|E

40|$|The WASCOR (WASeda Construction Robot) {{research}} project was organized in 1982 by Waseda University, Tokyo, Japan, aiming at automatizing building construction with a robot. This project is collaborated by nine general contractors and a construction machinery manufacturer.
