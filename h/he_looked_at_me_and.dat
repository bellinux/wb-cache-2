25|$|I {{just want}} to say that when I was 16 or 17 years old, I went to see Buddy Holly play at Duluth National Guard Armory and I was three feet away from him… and <b>he</b> <b>looked</b> <b>at</b> <b>me.</b> <b>And</b> I just have some kind of feeling that he was – I don’t know how or why – but I know he was with us all the time we were making this record in some kind of way.|$|E
500|$|I saw the boy getting {{injured in}} his leg, {{and the father}} asking for help. Then I saw him getting injured in his arm, the father. The father was asking the {{ambulances}} to help him, because {{he could see the}} ambulances. I cannot see the ambulance... I wasn't far away, maybe from them [...] face to face about 15 meters, 17 meters. But the father didn't succeed to get the ambulance by waving to them. <b>He</b> <b>looked</b> <b>at</b> <b>me</b> <b>and</b> he said, [...] "Help me." [...] I said, [...] "I cannot, I can't help you." [...] The shooting till then was really heavy... It was really raining bullets, for more than for 45minutes. Then... I hear something, [...] "boom!" [...] Really is coming with a lot of dust. I looked at the boy, I filmed the boy lying down in the father's lap, and the father really, getting really injured, and he was really dizzy. I said, [...] "Oh my god, the boy's got killed, the boy's got killed," [...] I was screaming, I was losing my mind. While I was filming, the boy got killed... I was very afraid, I was very upset, I was crying, and I was remembering my children.... This was the most terrible thing that has happened to me as a journalist.|$|E
2500|$|Muawiyah is {{reported}} to have said: [...] "I observed the Messenger of Allah perform Wudhoo (ablution) and when he finished, <b>he</b> <b>looked</b> <b>at</b> <b>me</b> <b>and</b> said; 'O Muawiyah! If you get to rule then fear Allah and be just to the people.' Due to that statement of the Prophet I was convinced that I would one day be held accountable for undertaking the task" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "And <b>he</b> <b>looked</b> <b>at</b> <b>me</b> when I came away! I said: 'I s'll {{have to go}} now, Walter, {{because of}} the train--and the children.' And <b>he</b> <b>looked</b> <b>at</b> <b>me.</b> It seems hard." ...|$|R
50|$|<b>He</b> <b>looked</b> <b>at</b> <b>me</b> a minute, then winked his eye.|$|R
60|$|<b>He</b> <b>looked</b> <b>at</b> <b>me</b> with fond, {{dark eyes}} and smiled incredulously.|$|R
2500|$|Recalling his {{involvement}} with Foyt, Hutcherson said that [...] "A.J. had bought a Camaro to run USAC stock cars and we were running at Texas World Speedway at College Station. He had gotten mad about what some reporters had written {{about him in the}} days before the race. Well he sat on the pole and was leading the race when he pulled in with just a couple laps to go. I leaned in the car and asked him what was wrong and he said, 'Overheating.' I looked at the gauges which were normal and said, 'Why'd you pull out?' <b>He</b> <b>looked</b> <b>at</b> <b>me</b> <b>and</b> said, 'I didn't want to talk to those reporters in Victory Circle.' We had the race won and he parked the damn car!" ...|$|E
2500|$|According to Amy Lee, {{the song}} has several meanings, the first being an {{incident}} at a restaurant. During an interview from a tour stop in Tulsa she told The Boston Phoenix: [...] "I {{was inspired to}} write it when someone said something to me— I didn’t know him, and I {{thought he might be}} clairvoyant. I was in a relationship and I was completely unhappy. But I was hiding it. I was being completely abused and I was trying to cover it up; I wouldn’t even admit it to myself. So then I had spoken maybe 10 or 15 words to this guy, who was a friend of a friend. We were waiting for everyone else to show up, and we went into a restaurant and got a table. And <b>he</b> <b>looked</b> <b>at</b> <b>me</b> <b>and</b> said, ‘Are you happy?’ And I felt my heart leap, and I was like, he totally knows what I’m thinking. And I lied, I said I was fine. Anyway, he's not really clairvoyant. But he is a sociology major." [...] Lee said in a VH1 interview: [...] "Open-mindedness. It's about waking up to all the things you've been missing for so long. One day someone said something that made my heart race for a second and I realized that for months I'd been numb, just going through the motions of life." [...] During an interview with Blender, Lee claimed that she wrote [...] "Bring Me to Life" [...] about her longtime friend, Josh Hartzler, whom she married in 2007.|$|E
60|$|<b>He</b> <b>looked</b> <b>at</b> <b>me</b> <b>and</b> laughed, {{but that}} laugh was uncommonly like a snarl.|$|E
60|$|The boy whistled softly. <b>He</b> <b>looked</b> <b>at</b> <b>me</b> with wide-open eyes.|$|R
60|$|Mabane {{showed no}} sign of annoyance. <b>He</b> <b>looked</b> <b>at</b> <b>me</b> composedly.|$|R
60|$|Mr. Wading {{agreed to}} the alteration. <b>He</b> <b>looked</b> <b>at</b> <b>me</b> amusedly.|$|R
60|$|Then <b>he</b> <b>looked</b> <b>at</b> <b>me,</b> <b>and</b> his {{brooding}} {{eyes seemed}} to scan my face.|$|E
60|$|<b>He</b> <b>looked</b> <b>at</b> <b>me,</b> <b>and</b> I {{saw that}} he did not know what I meant. I explained.|$|E
60|$|<b>He</b> <b>looked</b> <b>at</b> <b>me,</b> <b>and</b> fell {{a victim}} to my {{confidence}} of manner. The petulancy died {{out of his}} face.|$|E
60|$|<b>He</b> <b>looked</b> <b>at</b> <b>me</b> in keen surprise. He {{was evidently}} taken aback.|$|R
60|$|<b>He</b> <b>looked</b> <b>at</b> <b>me</b> stolidly. Apparently <b>he</b> {{thought that}} silence was wisest.|$|R
60|$|<b>He</b> <b>looked</b> <b>at</b> <b>me</b> with a half-suppressed pity, {{and shook}} his head.|$|R
60|$|<b>He</b> <b>looked</b> <b>at</b> <b>me,</b> <b>and</b> {{his eyelids}} hung heavy {{over his eyes}} {{as if he had}} been drinking, or as if he were tired.|$|E
6000|$|... "Like this." [...] I imitated his buzzing noise. <b>He</b> <b>looked</b> <b>at</b> <b>me,</b> <b>and</b> it {{was evident}} the buzzing awakened distaste. [...] "Do I do that?" [...] he asked.|$|E
6000|$|I put out my hand, and Mr. Wemmick {{at first}} {{looked at it}} as if he thought I wanted something. Then <b>he</b> <b>looked</b> <b>at</b> <b>me,</b> <b>and</b> said, {{correcting}} himself,-- ...|$|E
60|$|<b>He</b> <b>looked</b> <b>at</b> <b>me</b> with a {{singular}} expression in his ironical eyes.|$|R
60|$|I insulted him. <b>He</b> <b>looked</b> <b>at</b> <b>me</b> in {{slow and}} smiling surprise.|$|R
60|$|Mr. Grooten {{raised his}} eyes to mine. <b>He</b> <b>looked</b> <b>at</b> <b>me</b> steadily.|$|R
6000|$|... "'I was boiling {{the kettle}} when I fell asleep, sir.' <b>He</b> <b>looked</b> <b>at</b> <b>me</b> <b>and</b> then {{up at the}} still quivering bell with an ever-growing astonishment upon his face.|$|E
6000|$|<b>He</b> <b>looked</b> <b>at</b> <b>me</b> <b>and</b> paused. 'Well,' {{he went on}} at last, after a long interval; 'since {{you insist}} upon it, I will leave the bequest to stand without condition.' ...|$|E
60|$|I {{have spoken}} to him many times, but he never answers. I sat and watched him all morning. Frequently <b>he</b> <b>looked</b> <b>at</b> <b>me,</b> <b>and</b> it was patent that he knew me.|$|E
60|$|<b>He</b> <b>looked</b> <b>at</b> <b>me</b> doubtfully, then started, {{and looked}} with a changed expression.|$|R
60|$|<b>He</b> <b>looked</b> <b>at</b> <b>me</b> seriously now, a cold glitter in {{his small}} eyes.|$|R
60|$|<b>He</b> <b>looked</b> <b>at</b> <b>me</b> sharply, wondering, maybe, at {{the fresh}} tone I took.|$|R
6000|$|... "Look on me now, O Chief Bulalio, O Slaughterer, {{who once}} was named Umslopogaas--look {{on me and}} say who am I?" [...] Then <b>he</b> <b>looked</b> <b>at</b> <b>me</b> <b>and</b> his jaw fell.|$|E
60|$|When the {{sickness}} passed over, {{he stood up}} away from the post, trembling and lugubrious. His eyelids drooped heavily over his eyes, and <b>he</b> <b>looked</b> <b>at</b> <b>me,</b> <b>and</b> smiled a faint, sick smile.|$|E
6000|$|... “Value? What value?” <b>He</b> <b>looked</b> <b>at</b> <b>me,</b> <b>and</b> {{though his}} eyes were steady and motionless, there seemed a cynical smile in them. “What kind of value? How do you measure it? Who values it?” ...|$|E
60|$|<b>He</b> <b>looked</b> <b>at</b> <b>me</b> {{with that}} queer {{expression}} of mirth he sometimes has.|$|R
60|$|<b>He</b> <b>looked</b> <b>at</b> <b>me</b> {{as though}} in reproach at the levity of my question.|$|R
60|$|He made no reply. His {{silence was}} {{sufficiently}} expressive; <b>he</b> <b>looked</b> <b>at</b> <b>me</b> fondly.|$|R
