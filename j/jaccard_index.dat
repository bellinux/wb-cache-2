40|$|Drawing on a {{long history}} in macroecology, {{correlation}} analysis of microbiome datasets is becoming a common practice for identifying relationships or shared ecological niches among bacterial taxa. However, many of the statistical issues that plague such analyses in macroscale communities remain unresolved for microbial communities. Here, we discuss problems in the analysis of microbial species correlations based on presence-absence data. We focus on presence-absence data because this information is more readily obtainable from sequencing studies, especially for whole-genome sequencing, where abundance estimation is still in its infancy. First, we show how Pearson's correlation coefficient (r) and <b>Jaccard's</b> <b>index</b> (J) -two of the most common metrics for correlation analysis of presence-absence data-can contradict each other when applied to a typical microbiome dataset. In our dataset, for example, 14 % of species-pairs predicted to be significantly correlated by r were not predicted to be significantly correlated using J, while 37. 4 % of species-pairs predicted to be significantly correlated by J were not predicted to be significantly correlated using r. Mismatch was particularly common among species-pairs with at least one rare species (< 10 % prevalence), explaining why r and J might differ more strongly in microbiome datasets, where there are large numbers of rare taxa. Indeed 74 % of all species-pairs in our study had at least one rare species. Next, we show how Pearson's correlation coefficient can result in artificial inflation of positive taxon relationships and how this is a particular problem for microbiome studies. We then illustrate how <b>Jaccard's</b> <b>index</b> of similarity (J) can yield improvements over Pearson's correlation coefficient. However, the standard null model for <b>Jaccard's</b> <b>index</b> is flawed, and thus introduces its own set of spurious conclusions. We thus identify a better null model based on a hypergeometric distribution, which appropriately corrects for species prevalence. This model is available from recent statistics literature, and can be used for evaluating the significance of any value of an empirically observed <b>Jaccard's</b> <b>index.</b> The resulting simple, yet effective method for handling correlation analysis of microbial presence-absence datasets provides a robust means of testing and finding relationships and/or shared environmental responses among microbial taxa...|$|R

50|$|The <b>Jaccard</b> <b>index</b> is {{also more}} general than the SMC {{and can be used}} to compare other data types than just vectors of binary attributes, such as {{probability}} measures.|$|E
50|$|In other contexts, where 0 and 1 carry {{equivalent}} information (symmetry), the SMC {{is a better}} measure of similarity. For example, vectors of demographic variables stored in dummies variables, such as binary gender, would be better compared with the SMC than with the <b>Jaccard</b> <b>index</b> since the impact of gender on similarity should be equal, independently of whether male {{is defined as a}} 0 and female as a 1 or the other way around. However, when we have symmetric dummy variables, one could replicate the behaviour of the SMC by splitting the dummies into two binary attributes (in this case, male and female), thus transforming them into asymmetric attributes, allowing the use of the <b>Jaccard</b> <b>index</b> without introducing any bias. By using this trick, the <b>Jaccard</b> <b>index</b> can be considered as making the SMC a fully redundant metric. The SMC remains, however, more computationally efficient in the case of symmetric dummy variables since it does not require adding extra dimensions.|$|E
40|$|The biogeographic {{patterns}} in species density of herptiles were analysed in the Iberian Peninsula. Geoclimatic regions were identified using a PCA. Individual habitat suitability (HS) models for 23 amphibians and 35 reptiles at 10 x 10 km scale were calculated with ENFA, using 12 environmental factors established with Remote Sensing (RS) techniques. The species presence proportion in each geoclimatic region was calculated through a cross-tabulation between each potential occurrence {{model and the}} geoclimatic regions. Species chorotypes were determined through Hierarchical Cluster Analysis using <b>Jaccard's</b> <b>index</b> as association measure and by the analysis of marginality and tolerance factors from individual HS models. Predicted species density maps were calculated for each geoclimatic region. Probable under-sampled areas were estimated through differences between the predicted species density maps and observed (Gap analysis). The selected PCA components divided the Iberian Peninsula in two major geoclimatic regions largely corresponding to the Atlantic and Mediterranean climates. The <b>Jaccard's</b> <b>index</b> clustered herptiles in two main taxonomic groups, with distribution similar to the Atlantic and Mediterranean geoclimatic regions (7 amphibian + 13 reptile species in three Atlantic subgroups and 16 amphibian + 22 reptile species in four Mediterranean subgroups). Marginality and tolerance factor scores identified species groups of herptile specialists and generalists. The highest observed and predicted species density areas were broadly located in identical regions. Predicted gaps are located in north-western, north-east and central Iberia.

DNA yields per individual ranged from 33. 80 ng/µl to 441. 40 ng/µl.
