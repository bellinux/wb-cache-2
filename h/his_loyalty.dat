However, Charlton seemed to accept the affirmative result of the referendum and again proved <b>his</b> <b>loyalty</b> to Hughes by defending him when he became the target of caucus criticism. Charlton attempted to deflect attacks made on Hughes to a party conference, but Hughes left the party before a decision could be made.|$|E
