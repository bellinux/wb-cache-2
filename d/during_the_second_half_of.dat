5|$|<b>During</b> <b>the</b> <b>second</b> <b>half</b> <b>of</b> the 16th century, Europeans' {{interest}} in the New World revolved around gold and silver and not tobacco. The European lack of {{interest in}} tobacco was {{due to the fact that}} the Amerindians controlled the tobacco industry; as long as the Amerindians controlled the supply there was no need for the incorporation in European commercial capitalism.|$|E

5|$|Under Lord Fairfax's ownership, the Cacapon River Valley was {{predominantly}} {{inhabited by}} English-speaking settlers {{as early as}} the late 1730s; most came from Pennsylvania and New Jersey. As settlement progressed <b>during</b> <b>the</b> <b>second</b> <b>half</b> <b>of</b> the 18th century, the fertile land of Hampshire County (including the Cacapon River Valley) also attracted German settlers from Pennsylvania and elsewhere in Virginia before and after the American Revolutionary War (1775–1783).|$|E
5|$|Watson, {{who grew}} up in Seattle in the 1920s and 1930s, was a tireless advocate, through his column as well as through a fictional {{organization}} he created called Lesser Seattle, for limiting the seemingly unbridled growth and urban renewal that dramatically altered the Seattle landscape <b>during</b> <b>the</b> <b>second</b> <b>half</b> <b>of</b> the twentieth century.|$|E

5|$|Due {{in part to}} the {{diffusion}} of national and Republican ideas across France <b>during</b> <b>the</b> <b>second</b> <b>half</b> <b>of</b> the Third Republic, the Bastille lost an element of its prominence as a symbol by the 20th century. Nonetheless, the Place de la Bastille continued to be the traditional location for left wing rallies, particularly in the 1930s, the symbol of the Bastille was widely evoked by the French Resistance during the Second World War and until the 1950s Bastille Day remained the single most significant French national holiday.|$|E

5|$|<b>During</b> <b>the</b> <b>second</b> <b>half</b> <b>of</b> the 18th century, Lima was {{adversely}} affected by the Bourbon Reforms as it lost its monopoly on overseas trade and the important mining region of Upper Peru {{was transferred to the}} Viceroyalty of the Río de la Plata. This economic decline made the city's elite dependent on royal and ecclesiastical appointment and thus, reluctant to advocate independence. In the 1810s, the city became a Royalist stronghold during the South American wars of independence led by a strong viceroy, José Fernando de Abascal y Sousa.|$|E
5|$|<b>During</b> <b>the</b> <b>second</b> <b>half</b> <b>of</b> the 19th century, the Surrey {{villages of}} Wimbledon and Sutton {{experienced}} rapid residential growth, {{stimulated by the}} railways running through their areas, with landowners in both areas profiting from {{the development of new}} suburban housing on their previously rural estates. Less accessible to the railways, the parishes of Merton and Morden, which lay between Wimbledon and Sutton, remained largely rural and, starting in the 1880s, a series of railway schemes were proposed to bring a new line through the area and increase the value of the land.|$|E
5|$|<b>During</b> <b>the</b> <b>second</b> <b>half</b> <b>of</b> the 2nd century, the Roman army {{underwent}} considerable further expansion, {{with the}} addition of 5 new legions (27,500 men) to a Principate peak of 33. A matching number of auxilia (i.e. c. 50 regiments, although only the names of around 25-30 have survived in the epigraphic record) were probably added, possibly reaching a peak of c. 440 regiments and around 250,000 effectives by the end of Septimius Severus's rule (211AD).|$|E

5|$|General sejm was {{the highest}} organ of {{collective}} and consensus-based state power. The Sejm's supreme court, presided over by the king, decided the most serious of legal cases. <b>During</b> <b>the</b> <b>second</b> <b>half</b> <b>of</b> the 17th century, {{for a variety of}} reasons, including abuse of the unanimity rule (liberum veto), sejm's effectiveness had declined, and the void was being increasingly filled by sejmiks, where in practice the bulk of government's work was getting done.|$|E

If Sheshi lived <b>during</b> <b>the</b> <b>second</b> <b>half</b> <b>of</b> the 15th Dynasty between the reigns of Khyan and Apophis as Ben-Tor and Ward favor then Sheshi would have reigned c. 1600 BC.|$|E
5|$|Ivan Sratsimir {{began to}} mint his own coinage {{to show his}} {{legitimacy}} {{as early as the}} 1360s.
