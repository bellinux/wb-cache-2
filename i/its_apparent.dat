5|$|It is {{believed}} that the Lānai hookbill inhabited montane dry forests on Lānai dominated by akoko (Euphorbia species) and ōpuhe (Urera glabra). The unique shape of the hookbill's bill, particularly {{when compared with the}} ōū's bill, and <b>its</b> <b>apparent</b> rarity suggested that the species was an extreme specialist and was therefore restricted to this habitat.|$|E

5|$|Before venom {{immunotherapy}}, whole-body extract immunotherapy {{was widely}} used due to <b>its</b> <b>apparent</b> effectiveness, {{and it was}} the only immunotherapy used for ant stings. However, fatal failures were reported, and this led to scientists to research for alternative methods of desensitisation. Before 1986 allergic reactions were not recorded and there was no study on Myrmecia sting venom; whole body extracts were later used on patients during the 1990s, but this was found to be ineffective and was subsequently withdrawn. In 2003, ant venom immunotherapy was shown to be safe and effective against Myrmecia venom.|$|E
5|$|The {{apparent}} {{brightness of}} a star is {{expressed in terms of}} <b>its</b> <b>apparent</b> magnitude. It {{is a function of the}} star's luminosity, its distance from Earth, and the altering of the star's light as it passes through Earth's atmosphere. Intrinsic or absolute magnitude is directly related to a star's luminosity, and is what the apparent magnitude a star would be if the distance between the Earth and the star were 10 parsecs (32.6 light-years).|$|E
5|$|The current {{standard}} {{theory for}} Solar System formation, the nebular hypothesis, has fallen {{into and out}} of favour since its formulation by Emanuel Swedenborg, Immanuel Kant, and Pierre-Simon Laplace in the 18th century. The most significant criticism of the hypothesis was <b>its</b> <b>apparent</b> inability to explain the Sun's relative lack of angular momentum when compared to the planets. However, since the early 1980s studies of young stars have shown them to be surrounded by cool discs of dust and gas, exactly as the nebular hypothesis predicts, which has led to its re-acceptance.|$|E

50|$|The binary's {{composite}} spectral {{class is}} F9V and <b>its</b> combined <b>apparent</b> magnitude is +4.90. The pair orbit each other once every 13 days, and the orbital eccentricity {{is a low}} 0.014, making it nearly circular.|$|R
5|$|Because Earth's {{rotational}} axis is not perpendicular to its orbital plane, Earth's equatorial plane is not coplanar with the ecliptic plane, but {{is inclined to}} it by an angle of about 23.4°, which {{is known as the}} obliquity of the ecliptic. If the equator is projected outward to the celestial sphere, forming the celestial equator, it crosses the ecliptic at two points known as the equinoxes. The Sun, in <b>its</b> <b>apparent</b> motion along the ecliptic, crosses the celestial equator at these points, one from south to north, the other from north to south. The crossing from south to north is known as the vernal equinox, also known as the first point of Aries and the ascending node of the ecliptic on the celestial equator. The crossing from north to south is the autumnal equinox or descending node.|$|E
5|$|The Milky Way covers {{much of the}} constellation's area. Of the {{deep-sky objects}} in Apus, there are two {{prominent}} globular clusters—NGC 6101 and IC 4499—and a large faint nebula that covers several degrees east of Beta and Gamma Apodis. NGC 6101 is a globular cluster of apparent magnitude 9.2 located around 50,000 light-years distant from Earth, which is around 160 light-years across. Around 13 billion years old, it contains {{a high concentration of}} massive bright stars known as blue stragglers, thought {{to be the result of}} two stars merging. IC 4499 is a loose globular cluster in the medium-far galactic halo; <b>its</b> <b>apparent</b> magnitude is 10.6.|$|E

5|$|The {{discovery}} image {{gave the}} first hint that comet Shoemaker–Levy 9 was an unusual comet, as it appeared to show multiple nuclei in an elongated region about 50arcseconds long and 10arcseconds wide. Brian G. Marsden of the Central Bureau for Astronomical Telegrams noted that the comet lay only about 4degrees from Jupiter as seen from Earth, and that although this could of course be a line of sight effect, <b>its</b> <b>apparent</b> motion in the sky suggested that it was physically close to it. Because of this, he suggested that the Shoemakers and David Levy had discovered the fragments of a comet that had been disrupted by Jupiter's gravity.|$|E
5|$|The {{thesis of}} eliminativism {{seems to be}} so {{obviously}} wrong to many critics, under the claim that people know immediately and indubitably that they have minds, that argumentation seems unnecessary. This sort of intuition pumping is illustrated by asking what happens when one asks oneself honestly if one has mental states. Eliminativists object to such a rebuttal of their position by claiming that intuitions often are mistaken. Analogies {{from the history of}} science are frequently invoked to buttress this observation: it may appear obvious that the sun travels around the earth, for example, but for all <b>its</b> <b>apparent</b> obviousness this conception was proved wrong nevertheless. Similarly, it may appear obvious that apart from neural events there are also mental conditions. Nevertheless, this could equally turn out to be false.|$|E
5|$|Because {{the orbit}} of Mars is eccentric, <b>its</b> <b>apparent</b> {{magnitude}} at opposition from the Sun can range from −3.0 to −1.4. The minimum brightness is magnitude +1.6 when the planet is {{in conjunction with the}} Sun. Mars usually appears distinctly yellow, orange, or red; the actual color of Mars is closer to butterscotch, and the redness seen is just dust in the planet's atmosphere. NASA's Spirit rover has taken pictures of a greenish-brown, mud-colored landscape with blue-grey rocks and patches of light red sand. When farthest away from Earth, it is more than seven times farther away than when it is closest. When least favorably positioned, it can be lost in the Sun's glare for months at a time. At its most favorable times—at 15- or 17-year intervals, and always between late July and late September—a lot of surface detail can be seen with a telescope. Especially noticeable, even at low magnification, are the polar ice caps.|$|E
50|$|NGC 6388 is a {{globular}} cluster {{located in the}} constellation Scorpius. The cluster was discovered by Scottish astronomer James Dunlop on May 13, 1826 using a 22.86 cm reflector telescope.

5|$|Before venom {{immunotherapy}}, {{whole body}} extract immunotherapy was widely used due to <b>its</b> <b>apparent</b> effectiveness, {{and it was}} the only immunotherapy used on ants. However, fatal failures were reported and this led to scientists researching for alternative methods of desensitisation. Whole body extract immunotherapy was later proven to be ineffective, and venom immunotherapy was found to be safe and effective to use. Paul Clarke first drew medical attention to the jack jumper ant in 1986, and before this, there had been no history of records of allergic reactions or study on their sting venom. The identification of venom allergens began in the early 1990s in preparation for therapeutic use. Whole body extracts were first used to desensitize patients, but it was found to be ineffective and later withdrawn. Venom immunotherapy was shown {{to reduce the risk of}} systemic reactions, demonstrating that immunotherapy can be provided for ant-sting allergies.|$|E
5|$|Despite <b>its</b> <b>apparent</b> success, Bedouin {{power was}} fragile, as the Jarrahids proved {{susceptible}} to bribery. Al-Hakim sent large sums and gifts to Mufarrij and his sons, with Hassan in return sending back the grandsons of Jawhar al-Siqilli, {{who had been}} entrusted to his care, to be executed. Abu'l-Futuh began to have second thoughts, as the Jarrahids increasingly treated him disrespectfully after the money he had brought with him ran out. Eventually he returned to Mecca and Fatimid allegiance. Abu'l-Qasim too feared a Jarrahid rapprochement with the Fatimids, and fled for Iraq, eventually rising to become a vizier for the Marwanid and Uqaylid rulers of the Jazira. Finally, in July/August 1013, al-Hakim sent a 24,000-strong army under Ali ibn Ja'far ibn Fallah against the Bedouin. The latter were heavily defeated {{in the field and}} lost Ramlah. Ali and Mahmud surrendered, and at the same time, Mufarrij died, possibly poisoned by agents of the Caliph. Thereupon Hassan too secured a pardon, and managed to retain his father's lands in Palestine. Although initially loyal to the Fatimids, he too held ambitions to rule Palestine as an autonomous ruler. From 1024, he launched a series of rebellions, allied with the Christians of Palestine and the Byzantines. Like his father, however, he failed to achieve but ephemeral success.|$|E
5|$|If the Moon {{were in a}} {{perfectly}} circular orbit, {{a little closer to}} the Earth, and in the same orbital plane, there would be total solar eclipses every new moon. However, since the Moon's orbit is tilted at more than 5 degrees to the Earth's orbit around the Sun, its shadow usually misses Earth. The Moon's orbit must cross Earth's ecliptic plane in order for an eclipse (both solar as well as lunar) to occur. In addition, the Moon's actual orbit is elliptical, often taking it far enough away from Earth that <b>its</b> <b>apparent</b> size is not large enough to block the Sun entirely. The orbital planes cross each other at a line of nodes resulting in at least two, and up to five, solar eclipses occurring each year; no more than two of which can be total eclipses. However, total solar eclipses are rare at any particular location because totality exists only along a narrow path on the Earth's surface traced by the Moon's shadow or umbra.|$|E

5|$|M36 (NGC 1960) {{is a young}} galactic {{open cluster}} with {{approximately}} 60 stars, {{most of which are}} relatively bright; however, only about 40 stars are visible in most amateur instruments. It is at a distance of 3,900 light-years and has an overall magnitude of 6.0; it is 14 light-years wide. <b>Its</b> <b>apparent</b> diameter is 12.0 arcminutes. Of the three open clusters in Auriga, M36 is both the smallest and the most concentrated, though its brightest stars are approximately 9th magnitude. It was discovered in 1749 by Guillaume Le Gentil, the first of Auriga's major open clusters to be discovered. M36 features a 10-arcminute-wide knot of bright stars in its center, anchored by Struve 737, a double star with components separated by 10.7 arcseconds. Most of the stars in M36 are B type stars with rapid rates of rotation. M36's Trumpler class is given as both I 3 r and II 3 m. Besides the central knot, most of the cluster's other stars appear in smaller knots and groups.|$|E
5|$|Semantic {{challenges}} to divine command theory have been proposed; the philosopher William Wainwright argued {{that to be}} commanded by God and to be morally obligatory do not have an identical meaning, which he believed would make defining obligation difficult. He also contended that, as knowledge of God is required for morality by divine command theory, atheists and agnostics could not be moral; he saw this as a weakness of the theory. Others have challenged the theory on modal grounds by arguing that, even if God's command and morality correlate in this world, they may not do so in other possible worlds. In addition, the Euthyphro dilemma, first proposed by Plato (in the context of polytheistic Greek religion), presented a dilemma which threatened either to leave morality subject to the whims of God, or challenge his omnipotence. Divine command theory has also been criticised for <b>its</b> <b>apparent</b> incompatibility with the omnibenevolence of God, moral autonomy and religious pluralism, although some scholars have attempted to defend the theory from these challenges.|$|E
5|$|Sforza chose for his {{headquarters}} the Borromeo castle of Peschiera, south-east of the city. Starvation and suffering were rampant in Milan. At last Gaspare da Vimercate engineered a coup on 24 February 1450. The {{next day the}} citizens met, but the suggestions and opinions were of great variety, save that all condemned Venice for <b>its</b> <b>apparent</b> apathy. Da Vimercate convinced the people to surrender to Sforza. Sforza had made himself very popular for his generosity while fighting for Milan. He had abstained from ravaging the countryside as was so common among commanders of his day, and after some debate the public was convinced. The following day terms were offered to Sforza, who accepted them. Sforza earned the city's devotion by distributing food to the starving people. On 22 March 1450, he had himself declared capitano del popolo, and by right of his wife, the Duke of Milan. He secured his popular support by letting many office-holders keep their positions and being very lenient in his reprisals. The leaders were briefly imprisoned or relegated to their estates, but were generally pardoned soon after, even knighting some of his old enemies at his coronation. Ghibellines were allowed to return in safety and were restored to favor.|$|E
