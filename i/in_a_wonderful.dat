25|$|In Series 9, Capaldi {{described}} his character as a 'thrill-seeker' who is confronting danger where he soon realises {{that he is}} 'one of the luckiest creatures in all of time and space' and that 'life is short even at two-thousand years'. According to Coleman regarding Clara's bond with The Doctor inquring if she had feelings for him she stated “She’s totally in love with him, always has been. It’s its own kind of love. He is her hero but she would be very reluctant to tell him that. It’s a doctor-and-companion love, and there’s nothing else like it really.” “They’re kind of freed of their issues and <b>in</b> <b>a</b> <b>wonderful</b> place together. Previously {{she was trying to}} keep him under control yet now the two of them are going ‘Come on, lets jump, lets do it’, egging each other on really, and being more and more reckless,” she teased. Capaldi stated “It’s sort of an utterly platonic bond, which is quite unusual. The problem is the Doctor knows a lot more than he ever says. He knows Clara’s fate. He knows the fate of all his companions before they do.” Ultimately it has been confirmed by both Capaldi and Coleman that the Doctor and Clara's relationship is romantic in nature.|$|E
500|$|Ealdred {{did much}} to restore {{discipline}} in the monasteries and churches under his authority, and was liberal with gifts to the churches of his diocese. He built the monastic church of St Peter at Gloucester (now Gloucester Cathedral, though nothing of his fabric remains), then part of his diocese of Worcester. He also repaired {{a large part of}} Beverley Minster in the diocese of York, adding a presbytery and an unusually splendid painted ceiling covering [...] "all {{the upper part of the}} church from the choir to the tower...intermingled with gold in various ways, and <b>in</b> <b>a</b> <b>wonderful</b> fashion". He added a pulpit [...] "in German style" [...] of bronze, gold and silver, surmounted by an arch with a rood cross in the same materials; these were examples of the lavish decorations added to important churches in the years before the conquest.|$|E

500|$|The most {{important}} thing for Paterson was to keep the spirit of the book alive while finding a way to transform it from [...] "a novel that takes place mostly in the characters' heads to a dynamic visual medium". Paterson knew that the film had to be about friendship and imagination. While Paterson focused on [...] "bringing out the emotions of the story," [...] he admitted to having difficulty writing about Terabithia [...] "because it was too close". He credited fellow screenwriter Jeff Stockwell for recreating Terabithia for the film. [...] "What Jeff was able to do as an outsider who wasn't so attached to the story was to really let his imagination go free and make up this world <b>in</b> <b>a</b> <b>wonderful</b> way", David said. Csupó noted that the two main characters are a little bit older in the film than they are in the book. Csupó reasons that the movie [...] "deals with so many issues including friendship, and maybe first innocent love, things like that", so it [...] "made more sense" [...] to make the characters older.|$|E
500|$|Eliza Meek {{was born}} on March 3, 1832, to Captain John Meek (1792–1875) and Betsy W. Meek (1807–1848). John was a New Englander from Marblehead, Massachusetts, who first arrived in Hawaii about 1809 and served for many years as harbor master and pilot of Honolulu. Betsy was the Hawaiian wife of Captain Meek and died on May 5, 1848. Eliza grew up with many {{siblings}} including her youngest sister Elizabeth [...] "Betsy" [...] Meek (1841–1895), who married American settler Horace Gate Crabbe in 1857 and had five children. In her youth, Eliza was noted for her equestrian skills on her father's lands at Lihue and Wahiawa {{on the island of}} Oʻahu where their family raised thorough-bred horses which were well known across the islands. According to archivist and historian Albert Pierce Taylor, Eliza was often [...] "seen riding the horse through the streets of Honolulu garbed <b>in</b> <b>a</b> <b>wonderful</b> pa-u, with a dozen or more followers riding behind her wearing the same color of garment". Eliza was considered a great beauty in her youth and possessed green-color eyes indicative of her hapa-haole (half-European, half-Hawaiian) heritage.|$|E
500|$|The {{production}} {{moved to}} the United Kingdom and shot in a converted airship hangar in Cardington, Bedfordshire, north of London. There, the hotel bar set which tilted 30 degrees was built. A hotel corridor was also constructed by Guy Hendrix Dyas, the production designer, Chris Corbould, the special effects supervisor, and Wally Pfister, the director of photography; it rotated a full 360degrees to create the effect of alternate directions of gravity for scenes set during the second level of dreaming, where dream-sector physics become chaotic. The idea {{was inspired by a}} technique used in Stanley Kubrick's [...] (1968). Nolan said, [...] "I was interested in taking those ideas, techniques, and philosophies and applying them to an action scenario". The filmmakers originally planned to make the hallway only 40ft (12m) long, but as the action sequence became more elaborate, the hallway's length grew to 100ft (30m). The corridor was suspended along eight large concentric rings that were spaced equidistantly outside its walls and powered by two massive electric motors. Joseph Gordon-Levitt, who plays Arthur, spent several weeks learning to fight in a corridor that spun like [...] "a giant hamster wheel". Nolan said of the device, [...] "It was like some incredible torture device; we thrashed Joseph for weeks, but in the end we looked at the footage, and it looks unlike anything any of us has seen before. The rhythm of it is unique, and when you watch it, even if you know how it was done, it confuses your perceptions. It's unsettling <b>in</b> <b>a</b> <b>wonderful</b> way". Gordon-Levitt remembered, [...] "it was six-day weeks of just, like, coming home at night battered ... The light fixtures on the ceiling are coming around on the floor, and you have to choose the right time to cross through them, and if you don't, you're going to fall." [...] On July15,2009, filming took place at University College London for the sequences occurring inside a Paris college of architecture in the story, including the library, Flaxman Gallery and Gustav Tuck Theatre.|$|E

2500|$|On March 14, 1858, at Lovett's Grove, near Bowling Green, Ohio, White {{received}} a vision while attending a funeral service. On that day James White wrote that [...] "God manifested His power <b>in</b> <b>a</b> <b>wonderful</b> manner" [...] adding that [...] "several {{had decided to}} keep the Lord's Sabbath and go {{with the people of}} God." [...] In writing about the vision, she stated that she received practical instruction for church members, and more significantly, a cosmic sweep of the conflict [...] "between Christ and His angels, and Satan and his angels." [...] Ellen White would expand upon this great controversy theme which would eventually culminate in the Conflict of the Ages series.|$|E
2500|$|The {{first record}} of the Cobb, the town's harbour wall, is in a 1328 {{document}} describing it as having been damaged by storms. It was made of oak piles driven into the seabed with boulders stacked between. The boulders had been floated into place, tied between empty barrels. A 1685 account describes it as, [...] "an immense mass of stone, of a shape of a demi-lune, with a bar {{in the middle of}} the concave: no one stone that lies there was ever touched with a tool or bedded in any sort of cement, but all the pebbles of the see are piled up, and held by their bearings only, and the surge plays in and out through the interstices of the stone <b>in</b> <b>a</b> <b>wonderful</b> manner." [...] The Cobb wall provides a breakwater to protect the town from storms and separates Monmouth and Cobb Gate beaches.|$|E
2500|$|Armstrong wore a Star of David pendant for {{the rest}} of his life and wrote about what he learned from them: [...] "how to live—real life and determination." [...] The {{influence}} of Karnofsky is remembered in New Orleans by the Karnofsky Project, a nonprofit organization dedicated to accepting donated musical instruments to [...] "put them into the hands of an eager child who could not otherwise take part <b>in</b> <b>a</b> <b>wonderful</b> learning experience." [...] His first music gig may have been at the side of the Karnoffsky's junk wagon. To distinguish themselves from other hawkers, Louis tried playing a tin horn instead of ringing a bell as a means of attracting the attention of potential customers. Morris Karnoffsky advanced young Louis $2 toward the purchase of a $5 cornet from a pawn shop near the corner of Perdido and Rampart Streets, then cleaned and oiled the previously soiled instrument. In general, the family encouraged Louis' musical pursuits.|$|E
