5000|$|A metric ISO {{screw thread}} is {{designated}} by the letter M followed by {{the value of the}} nominal diameter D (Dmaj in the diagram above) and the pitch P, both expressed in millimetres and separated by the multiplication sign, × (e.g., M8×1.25). If the pitch is the normally used [...] "coarse" [...] pitch listed in ISO 261 or ISO 262, it can be omitted (e.g., M8). Tolerance classes defined in ISO 965-1 can be appended to these designations, if required (e.g., M500- 6g in external threads). If, for instance, only M20 is given then it is <b>coarse</b> <b>pitch</b> <b>thread.</b>|$|R
50|$|MDF may be glued, doweled or laminated. Typical {{fasteners}} are T-nuts and pan-head machine screws. Smooth-shank nails do {{not hold}} well, and neither do fine-pitch screws, especially in the edge. Special screws are available with a <b>coarse</b> <b>thread</b> <b>pitch,</b> but sheet-metal screws also work well. Like natural wood, MDF may split when woodscrews are installed without pilot holes.|$|R

5000|$|Kingsbury {{pursued a}} {{teaching}} {{position at the}} University of New Hampshire. Within two years, he was a professor of Mechanical Engineering courses at the university. His new position at the university allowed him to continue pursuing his interest in lubrication. During his time at the University of New Hampshire, he created an innovative test machine to measure friction in <b>coarse</b> <b>pitch,</b> lubricated screw <b>threads</b> at loads of up to 14,000 psi. The usefulness of this invention received mixed reviews from the American Society of Mechanical Engineers (ASME). His research also covered fluid lubricated bearings, and he published a paper entitled [...] "Experiments with an Air Lubricated Bearing". It was at this university that he envisioned the Kingsbury thrust bearing.|$|R
50|$|The USS {{standard}} {{is no longer}} supported. It, together with the SAE fastener standard, was incorporated into the Unified Thread Standard. However, the term, USS, continues to be used occasionally today to describe inch based threaded fasteners with a <b>coarse</b> <b>thread</b> <b>pitch</b> and inch based washers that {{are a little bit}} larger than the corresponding SAE washer. The Unified Thread Standard uses the term UNC (Unified National Coarse) to describe a fastener that previously would have been designated USS and the Unified Thread Standard uses the term UNF (Unified National Fine) to describe a fastener that would have previously been designated SAE.|$|R

This works for both fine and <b>coarse</b> <b>pitches,</b> and also produces an approximate 75 percent thread.|$|R

50|$|In {{addition}} to coarse and fine threads, {{there is another}} division of extra fine, or “superfine” threads, with a very fine <b>pitch</b> <b>thread.</b> Superfine <b>pitch</b> metric <b>threads</b> are occasionally used in automotive components, such as suspension struts, and are commonly used in the aviation manufacturing industry. This is because extra fine threads are more resistant to coming loose from vibrations.|$|R

50|$|Finer and <b>coarser</b> <b>pitch</b> cables {{are also}} available. For instance, the {{high-speed}} ATA interface cable used for computer hard disk interfaces ULTRA-ATA has 0.025-inch (0.64-mm) pitch. Finer pitches, {{as small as}} 0.3 mm, are found in portable electronic equipment, such as laptops; however, portable electronic equipment usually uses flexible flat cables (FFC).|$|R
50|$|<b>Thread</b> <b>pitch</b> gauges {{are used}} as a {{reference}} tool in determining the <b>pitch</b> of a <b>thread</b> that is on a screw or in a tapped hole. This tool is not used as a precision measuring instrument. This device allows the user to determine {{the profile of the}} given thread and quickly categorize the thread by shape and pitch. This device also saves time, in that it removes the need for the user to measure and calculate the <b>thread</b> <b>pitch</b> of the <b>threaded</b> item.|$|R
50|$|Screw jacks {{are limited}} in their lifting capacity. Increasing load {{increases}} friction within the screw <b>threads.</b> A fine <b>pitch</b> <b>thread,</b> which would increase {{the advantage of the}} screw, also reduces the size and strength of the threads. Longer operating levers soon reach a point where the lever will simply bend at their inner end.|$|R

5000|$|Several {{designs were}} tried, {{including}} a small bladder of pressurized {{air in the}} propeller hub providing the necessary force to resist a spring that would drive the blades from fine <b>pitch</b> (take-off) to <b>coarse</b> <b>pitch</b> (level cruising). At a suitable airspeed a disk {{on the front of}} the spinner would press sufficiently on the bladder's air-release valve to relieve the pressure and allow the spring to drive the propeller to <b>coarse</b> <b>pitch.</b> These [...] "pneumatic" [...] propellers were fitted on the DH88 Comet aircraft, winner of the famed long distance 1934 Mac Robertson race and in the Caudron C.460 winner of the 1936 National Air Races, flown by Michel Detroyat. Use of these pneumatic propellers required presetting the propeller to fine pitch prior to take-off. This was done by pressurizing the bladder with a bicycle pump, hence the whimsical nickname Gonfleurs d'hélices (prop inflater boy) given to the aircraft ground mechanics in France up to this day.|$|R
5000|$|The basic {{principles}} of the ISO metric screw thread are defined in international standard ISO 68-1 and preferred combinations of diameter and pitch are listed in ISO 261. The smaller subset of diameter and pitch combinations commonly used in screws, nuts and bolts is given in ISO 262. The most commonly used pitch value for each diameter is the <b>coarse</b> <b>pitch.</b> For some diameters, one or two additional fine pitch variants are also specified, for special applications such as threads in thin-walled pipes. ISO metric screw threads are designated by the letter M followed by the major diameter of the thread in millimeters (e.g. M8). If the thread does not use the normal <b>coarse</b> <b>pitch</b> (e.g. 1.25 mm {{in the case of}} M8), then the pitch in millimeters is also appended with a multiplication sign (e.g. [...] "M8×1" [...] if the screw thread has an outer diameter of 8 mm and advances by 1 mm per 360° rotation).|$|R
30|$|CMSE {{resulted}} to be too smooth {{in order}} to show fast variations of the EEG signals. This fact is explained by the <b>extra</b> <b>coarse</b> -graining process used in this computation (see Algorithm 4 in “Methods”). In addition, time calculation was also long with respect to the other entropies. Thus, the parameter chosen to describe the evolution of this affection as the best complexity measure was MSE.|$|R
25|$|Gashing is a {{machining}} process used {{to rough out}} <b>coarse</b> <b>pitched</b> gears and sprockets. It is commonly used on worm wheels before hobbing, but also used on internal and external spur gears, bevel gears, helical gears, and gear racks. The process is performed on gashers or universal milling machines, {{especially in the case}} of worm wheels. After gashing the gear or sprocket is finished via hobbing, shaping, or shaving.|$|R
50|$|A {{centrifugal}} {{twisting force}} is experienced by any asymmetrical spinning object. In the propeller it acts to twist the blades {{to a fine}} pitch. The aerodynamic centre of pressure is therefore usually arranged to be slightly forward of its mechanical centreline, creating a twisting moment towards <b>coarse</b> <b>pitch</b> and counteracting the centrifugal moment. However in a high-speed dive the aerodynamic force can change significantly and the moments can become unbalanced.|$|R

50|$|The {{submarine}} was streamlined by {{careful attention}} to the attachments {{on the outside of}} the hull, the size of the bridge reduced, the gun was removed along with one of the periscopes and the radar mast, and torpedo tubes blanked over. The motors were upgraded and higher capacity batteries fitted along with replacement of the propellors with the <b>coarser</b> <b>pitched</b> type used on the larger T class submarines.|$|R
50|$|The common V-thread {{standards}} (ISO 261 and Unified Thread Standard) {{include a}} <b>coarse</b> <b>pitch</b> {{and a fine}} pitch for each major diameter. For example, -13 belongs to the UNC series (Unified National Coarse) and -20 belongs to the UNF series (Unified National Fine). Similarly, ISO261 M10 (10mm (398 thou) nominal outer diameter) has a coarse thread version at 1.25mm pitch (49 thou) and a fine thread version at 1 mm (39 thou) pitch.|$|R
5000|$|A ground-adjustable {{propeller}} is {{a simple}} type of aircraft variable-pitch propeller where the blade angle can be adjusted between pre-set limits of fine and <b>coarse</b> <b>pitch.</b> [...] As its name implies, a ground-adjustable propeller may be adjusted only when the aircraft {{is on the ground}} and when the engine is not running. To adjust the propeller, the blades are loosened in the hub, a new angle set and then the hub tightened.|$|R
50|$|Coarse threads {{are those}} with larger <b>pitch</b> (fewer <b>threads</b> per axial distance), and fine threads are those with smaller <b>pitch</b> (more <b>threads</b> per axial distance). Coarse threads {{have a larger}} threadform {{relative}} to screw diameter, where fine threads have a smaller threadform relative to screw diameter. This distinction is analogous to that between coarse teeth and fine teeth on a saw or file, or between coarse grit and fine grit on sandpaper.|$|R
30|$|Figure  3 {{indicates}} {{that with the}} increase of the replacement volume fraction of the scattering-filling aggregate, the shrinkage of the concrete decreases significantly. With increasing of the volume fraction of the <b>extra</b> <b>coarse</b> aggregate is added to the concrete, the shrinkage of the concrete decreases markedly. The aggregate scattering-filling process is a very effective approach to reduce the shrinkage of the high strength concrete, which is highly desired by engineers (Mindess et al. 2003).|$|R
5000|$|The British Standard Fine (BSF) {{standard}} has {{the same}} thread angle as the BSW, but has a finer <b>thread</b> <b>pitch</b> and smaller <b>thread</b> depth. This is more like the modern [...] "mechanical" [...] screw and was used for fine machinery and for steel bolts.|$|R
5000|$|This new {{standard}} specified a 55° thread angle and a thread depth of 0.640327p and a radius of 0.137329p, where p is the <b>pitch.</b> The <b>thread</b> <b>pitch</b> increased with diameter in steps specified on a chart. An {{example of the}} use of the Whitworth thread is the Royal Navy's Crimean War gunboats. These were the first instance of [...] "mass-production" [...] techniques being applied to marine engineering.|$|R
5000|$|The T-mount is a {{standard}} lens mount for cameras and other optical assemblies. The usual T-mount is a screw mount using a male 42×0.75 (42 mm diameter, 0.75 mm <b>thread</b> <b>pitch)</b> metric <b>thread</b> on the lens with a flange focal distance of 55 mm and a mating female 42mm thread on a camera adapter or other optical component.

40|$|Objectives : Implant design {{features}} such as macro- and micro-design may influence overall implant success. Limited information is currently available. Therefore, it {{is the purpose of}} this paper to examine these factors such as <b>thread</b> <b>pitch,</b> <b>thread</b> geometry, helix angle, thread depth and width as well as implant crestal module may affect implant stability. Search Strategy : A literature search was conducted using MEDLINE to identify studies, from simulated laboratory models, animal, to human, related to this topic using the keywords of implant thread, implant macrodesign, <b>thread</b> <b>pitch,</b> <b>thread</b> geometry, helix angle, thread depth, thread width and implant crestal module. Results : The results showed how thread geometry affects the distribution of stress forces around the implant. A decreased <b>thread</b> <b>pitch</b> may positively influence implant stability. Excess helix angles in spite of a faster insertion may jeopardize the ability of implants to sustain axial load. Deeper threads seem to have an important effect on the stabilization in poorer bone quality situations. The addition of threads or microthreads up to the crestal module of an implant might provide a potential positive contribution on bone-to to-implant contact as well as on the preservation of marginal bone; nonetheless this remains to be determined. Conclusions : Appraising the current literature on this subject and combining existing data to verify the presence of any association between the selected characteristics may be critical in the achievement of overall implant success.
