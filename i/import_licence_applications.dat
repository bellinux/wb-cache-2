He declined their request {{on the grounds that}} New Zealand was suffering from falling export prices at the time, which was causing a balance of trade problem for the Government. Other established car manufacturers were having the <b>import</b> <b>licences</b> reduced and the granting of a licence to another manufacturer was seen as counter-productive.|$|R

Computers could only be <b>imported</b> under <b>licence.</b> The executive management of the BNZ (Bank of New Zealand) wanted to obtain a computer and establish a computerised system to enable the automation of the processing of its banking transactions and customer accounting. Computerisation was deemed as the only way to proceed if the increasing cheque transaction volumes were to be accommodated in timely fashion.

5000|$|Production {{began in}} an old flour store in Devon Street, New Plymouth. The aim was to make 120 {{machines}} a year, but demand was higher after a flurry of articles in magazines and newspapers about the bike. Some were sold to Borneo and the New Hebrides. [...] Problems soon arose with the government refusing to issue an <b>import</b> <b>licence</b> for the engines and brake hubs. While negotiations continued between Callender and the government, Callender sent {{a photo of the}} bike along with Hillary, Mulgrave, and himself to Suzuki in Japan. Suzuki turned the photo into a giant poster on their Tokyo Motor Show stand along with a replica of the bike. In 1966 the government issued the <b>import</b> <b>licence</b> to allow enough parts to build the 120 bikes per year. By that time Callender had decided to sell the business to Motor Components of Waitara. Motor Components planned to sell 1,000 bikes per year, but by then Suzuki had commenced production of its own specialised machine. They in turn were followed by the other major Japanese motor cycle manufacturers. Production at the Waitara plant stopped in the 1970s.|$|R
