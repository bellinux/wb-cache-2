5|$|The {{season ended}} in {{disappointment}} for Neuner in Oslo. After claiming her 24th career {{win in the}} sprint, she had moved into second place <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>Overall</b> World Cup ranking. However, she again suffered from a cold and had {{to pull out of}} the penultimate race of the winter, the pursuit in which she would have started 31seconds in front. This effectively ended her hopes of retaining the World Cup crown. She eventually finished fifth <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>overall</b> standings, having missed five of the season's 26 races.|$|E
5|$|At the 2015 World Championships, Prevc {{finished}} 4th on {{the large}} hill, 13th on the normal hill, and 6th with the Slovenian team at the team event. Prevc took two 3rd places at the 2014–15 Four Hills Tournament which secured him a 3rd place <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>overall</b> tournament standing.|$|E

5|$|Even {{before the}} advent of printing, the visual {{appearance}} of poetry often added meaning or depth. Acrostic poems conveyed meanings in the initial letters of lines or in letters at other specific places in a poem. In Arabic, Hebrew and Chinese poetry, the visual presentation of finely calligraphed poems has played an important part <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>overall</b> effect of many poems.|$|E
5|$|Fluorosurfactants {{are small}} organofluorine {{molecules}} used for repelling water and stains. Although expensive (comparable to pharmaceuticals at $200–2000 per kilogram), they yielded over $1 {{billion in annual}} revenues by 2006; Scotchgard alone generated over $300 million in 2000. Fluorosurfactants are a minority <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>overall</b> surfactant market, most of which is taken up by much cheaper hydrocarbon-based products. Applications in paints are burdened by compounding costs; this use was valued at only $100 million in 2006.|$|E
5|$|In March, Carlsen {{played for}} the second time in the Melody Amber blind and rapid chess tournament, held in Nice for the first time. In the 11 rounds he {{achieved}} four wins, four draws and two losses in the blindfold, and three wins, two losses, and six draws in the rapid. This resulted in a shared fifth place in the blindfold, shared third place in the rapid and a shared second place <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>overall</b> tournament.|$|E

5|$|Prevc {{made his}} World Cup {{debut in the}} 2009/10 season, {{finishing}} 22nd in Lillehammer, Norway, on 5 December 2009. That season, he finished at 35th place <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>overall</b> standings. Prevc also represented Slovenia at the 2010 Winter Olympics in Vancouver, where he finished 7th in the individual normal hill and 16th in the individual large hill. Together with Robert Kranjec, Primož Pikl, and Mitja Mežnar, he finished 8th in the team large hill event.|$|E
5|$|Scheduling {{was left}} up to each team. There were wide variations, both <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>overall</b> number of games played and in the number played against other Association members. Thus, no {{official}} standings were maintained. In addition, football teams in the APFA also faced independent football teams not associated with the league. For instance, the Rochester Jeffersons played a schedule consisting mostly of local teams from their local sandlot circuit and the NYPFL, not the APFA.|$|E
5|$|Texas {{place at}} the top of the BCS rankings lasted only one week. On October 29, 2005, Texas {{initially}} trailed but rallied to beat an Oklahoma State Cowboys team that had held a losing record through the season so far. Texas retained the top spot in the computer rankings, but not by enough to stay ahead of USC <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>overall</b> BCS standings.|$|E

5|$|The Chalukyan architects {{retained}} features {{from both}} {{northern and southern}} styles. However, <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>overall</b> arrangement of the main temple and of the subsidiary shrines, they inclined towards the northern style and tended to build one main shrine with four minor shrines, making the structure a panchayatna or five-shrined complex. Chalukyan temples were, almost always, built facing the east.|$|E
5|$|With the {{progress}} of European colonization in the territories of the contemporary United States, the Native Americans were often conquered and displaced. The native population of America declined after Europeans arrived, and for various reasons, primarily diseases such as smallpox and measles. Violence {{was not a significant}} factor <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>overall</b> decline among Native Americans, though conflict among themselves and with Europeans affected specific tribes and various colonial settlements.|$|E
5|$|Aarhus has {{the highest}} ratio of {{immigrants}} in Denmark, 14.8% of the population, outside the Copenhagen area. During the 1990s there was significant immigration from Turkey and in recent years, there has been high growth <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>overall</b> immigrant community, from 27,783 people in 1999 to 40,431 in 2008. The majority of immigrants have roots outside Europe and the developed world, comprising some 25,000 people from 130 different nationalities, with the largest groups coming from the Middle East and north Africa. Some 15,000 have come from within Europe, with Poland, Germany, Romania and Norway being the largest contributors.|$|E

5|$|Although the {{essential}} problem of large tribal {{groups on the}} frontier remained {{much the same as}} the situation Rome faced in earlier centuries, the 3rd century saw a marked increase <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>overall</b> threat, although there is disagreement over whether external pressure increased, or Rome's ability to meet it declined. The Carpi and Sarmatians whom Rome had held at bay were replaced by the Goths and likewise the Quadi and Marcomanni that Rome had defeated were replaced by the greater confederation of the Alamanni.|$|E
5|$|At the Olympic {{rehearsal}} in Vancouver, Canada, in March 2009, Neuner {{claimed the}} 2008–09 Individual World Cup, despite never having won a race in that discipline. She {{also won the}} Vancouver relay race with the German team, and was second in the sprint, 0.7seconds behind Sweden's Helena Ekholm. At the season final in Khanty-Mansiysk, Neuner won the pursuit race—her 14th World Cup win. She ended the season fourth <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>Overall</b> Biathlon World Cup, which was generally considered disappointing in the media.|$|E
5|$|At {{the end of}} the season, she {{continued}} her successful run with four more World Cup wins. In March 2007, Neuner won the pursuit and mass start races at Holmenkollen in Oslo, Norway, and she won the sprint and pursuit events at the season final in Khanty-Mansiysk, Russia, giving her seven career World Cup wins. She ended her first complete season fourth <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>Overall</b> World Cup standings and finished second in the pursuit discipline. In the course of three months, Neuner had emerged from anonymity to become one of Germany's most popular female athletes. At the end of 2007, she had earned an estimated 1.3million euros through sponsorship and endorsement deals.|$|E

5|$|Blitzball {{is first}} {{introduced}} {{in the beginning of}} the game during one of the early cinematic sequences in which Tidus, the main character who is described as a star blitzball player, is part of an intense game. It is the only minigame that plays a role <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>overall</b> plot line as it is not only a main part of Tidus's character, but it's also in the first scene where the game's main antagonist, Sin is shown. Unlike with the other minigames, playing blitzball is mandatory near the beginning of the game, but it is later optional.|$|E
5|$|By 1961, workers' basic wages {{had risen}} {{to an average of}} about 73 percent of their total {{earnings}}; piece-rate workers saw an average of 71 percent and time workers 76 percent of their earnings as their basic wage. There was also a reduction <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>overall</b> level of quota overfulfillment—with quotas raised, many could not meet their own personal quota. The proportion of workers who achieved 100 percent or less of their quota varied from as low as 5.1 percent in iron and steel industries, to 31.4 percent in coal mining. Across Soviet industry, the average level of quota fulfillment fell from 169 percent before the reform, to 120 percent in October 1963.|$|E
5|$|Danilo Di Luca made {{it clear}} that he was aiming for the time bonuses {{available}} in this stage, both at the finish line and the intermediate sprint. As such, his team worked to bring the morning's breakaway back well before the end of the stage. Just as he had in the mountains, race leader Denis Menchov stayed right with Di Luca, and the two of them contested the intermediate sprint, with Di Luca's team trying to give him a successful leadout. They mistimed it, however, and Menchov was able to come around Di Luca and beat him to the line (Di Luca's teammate and accomplished sprinter Alessandro Petacchi managed to beat Menchov in the sprint to limit Di Luca's losses). Both Menchov and Di Luca got time bonuses, but Menchov got 4 for second in the sprint and Di Luca 2 for third, padding Menchov's lead <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>overall</b> classification.|$|E
