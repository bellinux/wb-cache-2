In his investigations of composition of binary quadratic forms, Gauss explicitly stated the associative law for the composition of forms, but like Euler before him, {{he seems to have}} been more interested in concrete results than in general theory. In 1870, Leopold Kronecker gave a definition of an abelian group in the context of ideal class groups of a number field, generalizing Gauss's work; but it appears he did not tie his definition with previous work on groups, particularly permutation groups. In 1882, considering the same question, Heinrich M. Weber realized the connection and gave a similar definition that involved the cancellation property but omitted the existence of the inverse element, which was sufficient in his context (finite groups).|$|E

At least 95 % of the cyclic peptides show a cis conformation of the Xaa-Pro bond in solution in DMSO or water, whereas all other peptide bonds are trans. Furthermore, we observed a hydrogen bond between the NH <b>group</b> <b>of</b> <b>residue</b> Ala 4 and the C = O <b>group</b> <b>of</b> <b>residue</b> Cys 1.

We propose a ‘double water exclusion’ hypothesis to refine the O-ring theory by assuming the hot spot itself is water-free. To computationally model a water-free hot spot, we use a biclique pattern that is defined as two maximal <b>groups</b> <b>of</b> <b>residues</b> from two chains in a protein complex holding the property that every residue contacts with all residues in the other group...|$|E

40|$|The helix is {{a common}} {{secondary}} structural element in proteins. Several subtypes of helical structures are possible, depending {{on the nature of}} the backbone hydrogen-bonding pattern. For short peptides in solution, more than one helical conformation may be in equilibrium. Most of the time it is extremely difficult to identify experimentally the interconversion between different helix forms in solution, although one of the helical structures may be trapped in single crystals. This report analyzes crystallographic and NMR studies of a model heptapeptide, Boc-Leu-Aib-Val-Ala-Leu-Aib-Val-OMe, designed to probe conformational heterogeneity and relative stability of different helical structures. In crystals the peptide adopts a right-handed 310 -helical structure, terminated by a lefthanded helical conformation (alphaL) at Aib(6) resulting in a 6 - 1 hydrogen bond at the C-terminus. The crystals are in space group P 21, a = 9. 843 (4) Å, b = 19. 944 (4) Å, c = 12. 456 (2) Å, beta = 102. 51 (2) °, Z = 2, R = 10. 1 %, and Rw = 9. 21 % for 2301 reflections; [F] > 3 sigma(F). In CDCl 3 NMR studies establish that the NH <b>groups</b> <b>of</b> <b>residues</b> 3 - 6 are hydrogen bonded, consistent with a continuous 310 -helix or the conformation observed in crystals. In (CD 3) 2 SO, NMR studies reveal that the NH <b>groups</b> <b>of</b> <b>residues</b> 1 - 3 are solvent exposed, supporting an R-helical structure. However, NMR data suggest appreciable conformational heterogeneity in solution, with population of extended states and conformations resembling the structure in crystals.

Thus, our limited understanding of which amino acids in the kinase domain encode substrate specificity, the so-called determinants of specificity (DoS), constitutes a major obstacle in cancer signaling. Here, we systematically discover several DoS and experimentally validate three of them, named the αC 1, αC 3, and APE- 7 residues.

In the reactive configuration of the complex cytochrome c heme edge is between plastocyanin acidic and hydrophobic patch.

The intermediate is zinc cytochrome c cation radical which exhibits different reactivity from the native iron(III) form of the protein. The reorganization energy and electron self-exchange rate constant of the zinc cytochrome c cation radical show that methionine, ligand in iron form of the protein, is uncoordinated in the zinc form of the protein;We extended the proton-linkage model so it can give information about individual proteins and even about amino-acid residues involved in protein association.

40|$|A general {{method for}} facilitating the {{interpretation}} of computer simulations of protein folding with minimally frustrated energy landscapes is detailed and applied to a designed ankyrin repeat protein (4 ANK).

The free energies of the individual macrobasins are then calculated, informing practical kinetic analysis. Two simple assumptions about the universality of the rate for downhill transitions between macrobasins and the natural local connectivity between macrobasins lead to a scheme for predicting overall folding and unfolding rates, generating chevron plots under varying thermodynamic conditions, and inferring dominant kinetic folding pathways. To illustrate the approach, free energies of macrobasins were calculated from biased simulations of a non-additive structure-based model using two structurally motivated foldon definitions at the full and half ankyrin repeat resolutions. The calculated chevrons have features consistent with those measured in stopped flow chemical denaturation experiments. The dominant inferred foldin...|$|E
