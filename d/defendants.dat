5|$|Although, in many areas, Scalia's {{approach}} was unfavorable to criminal <b>defendants,</b> {{he took the}} side of <b>defendants</b> in matters involving the Confrontation Clause of the Sixth Amendment, which guarantees <b>defendants</b> the right to confront their accusers. In multiple cases, Scalia wrote against laws that allowed alleged victims of child abuse to testify behind screens or by closed-circuit television. In a 2009 case, Scalia wrote the majority opinion in Melendez-Diaz v. Massachusetts, holding that <b>defendants</b> must {{have the opportunity to}} confront lab technicians in drug cases and that a certificate of analysis is not enough to prove a substance was a drug.|$|E

40|$|In a mock-trial paradigm, 205 {{participants}} {{considered a}} patricide trial {{in which a}} child <b>defendant</b> claimed the patricide was done in self-defense after years of sexual abuse. Participants in an empathy-induction condition were asked to take {{the perspective of the}} <b>defendant</b> and to detail how they would be thinking and feeling if they were the <b>defendant.</b> Control condition participants received no such instructions. Results indicated that, compared to jurors in the control condition, jurors who were asked to take the <b>defendant’s</b> perspective had more empathy for the <b>defendant</b> (without feeling more similar to or more sympathy for the <b>defendant),</b> found the <b>defendant</b> less guilty and less responsible for the murder, and were more likely to consider abuse to be a mitigating factor in the killing. Overall, compared to men, women were more likely to believe the <b>defendant’s</b> abuse allegations, find the <b>defendant</b> credible, and consider the <b>defendant</b> to be less responsible for the murder.

Two kilograms of cocaine were seized, along with 50 pounds of marijuana, 350 Ecstasy pills, hash oil, methamphetamine, other drug paraphernalia, three guns, and $60,000 in cash. Several months after the May 6 announcement, it was reported {{that the majority of the}} <b>defendants</b> had pleaded guilty to the felony charges.

40|$|We {{investigated}} {{the effect of}} the desirability of the <b>defendant</b> and the cost of a date on how participants assigned blame in a date rape context. Community participants (N = 211) read one of four date rape trial summaries that differed based on the two manipulated independent variables: the desirability of the <b>defendant</b> (i. e., high vs. low desirability) and the cost of the date (i. e., expensive [US$ 175] vs. inexpensive [US$ 30]). Participants then rated the victim and <b>defendant</b> on various attributes related to the trial (credibility, blame, and guilt) and post-date sexual behavior (expectations, want, and deservingness of sex). Overall, men viewed the victim more negatively and the <b>defendant</b> more positively than women. Participants in the high <b>defendant</b> desirability condition also viewed the victim as having higher want of sex following the date and rated the <b>defendant</b> as more credible. With regard to the cost of date manipulation, men viewed the <b>defendant</b> as more credible when a desirable <b>defendant</b> paid for an inexpensive date in comparison with an undesirable <b>defendant.</b> However, when the date was expensive, women viewed the desirable <b>defendant</b> as more credible than the undesirable <b>defendant.</b> Finally, we also found that participants’ perceptions of the victim’s expectations and want for sex and the <b>defendant’s</b> deservingness for sex mediated the effects of participant gender and <b>defendant</b> desirability on victim and <b>defendant</b> blame...|$|R

The trial varied {{as to whether the}} victim and <b>defendant</b> were depicted via images as either feminine or masculine. Participants rendered verdicts and made judgments about the victim and <b>defendant</b> (e. g., credibility). Results indicated that the victim’s and <b>defendant’s</b> masculine or feminine appearance affected these judgments. Female participants viewed a masculine victim as more credible than a feminine victim when the <b>defendant</b> was masculine. When the victim was masculine, they viewed a masculine <b>defendant</b> as more responsible for the victim’s injuries than a feminine <b>defendant.</b> Male participants had higher sympathy for a masculine versus feminine victim overall, but had more anger toward a masculine <b>defendant</b> versus a feminine <b>defendant</b> accused of assaulting a feminine victim. Finally, fewer participants mentioned the <b>defendant’s</b> history of violence as a reason for a guilty of felony verdict for a feminine victim with a feminine <b>defendant</b> versus all other combinations of victim and <b>defendant</b> masculine/feminine appearance.

In a misdemeanor case, the court may set the trial date at the initial appearance. The next court action in a misdemeanor case is the arraignment. Further steps are required in a felony case.

5|$|The trial, Illinois vs. August Spies et al., {{began on}} June 21, 1886, {{and went on}} until August 11. The trial was {{conducted}} {{in an atmosphere of}} extreme prejudice by both public and media toward the <b>defendants.</b> It was presided over by Judge Joseph Gary. Judge Gary displayed open hostility to the <b>defendants,</b> consistently ruled for the prosecution, and failed to maintain decorum. A motion to try the <b>defendants</b> separately was denied. The defense counsel included Sigmund Zeisler, William Perkins Black, William Foster, and Moses Salomon. Selection of the jury was extraordinarily difficult, lasting three weeks, and nearly one thousand people called. All union members and anyone who expressed sympathy toward socialism were dismissed. In the end a jury of 12 was seated, most of whom confessed prejudice towards the <b>defendants.</b> Despite their professions of prejudice Judge Gary seated those who declared that despite their prejudices they would acquit if the evidence supported it, refusing to dismiss for prejudice. Eventually the peremptory challenges of the defense were exhausted. Frustrated by the hundreds of jurors who were being dismissed, a bailiff was appointed who selected jurors rather than calling them at random. The bailiff proved prejudiced himself and selected jurors who seemed likely to convict based on their social position and attitudes toward the <b>defendants.</b> The prosecution, led by Julius Grinnell, argued that since the <b>defendants</b> had not actively discouraged the person who had thrown the bomb, they were therefore equally responsible as conspirators. The jury heard the testimony of 118 people, including 54 members of the Chicago Police Department and the <b>defendants</b> Fielden, Schwab, Spies and Parsons. Albert Parsons' brother claimed there was evidence linking the Pinkertons to the bomb. This reflected a widespread belief among the strikers.|$|E

50|$|An {{arraignment}} {{is held in}} both misdemeanor and felony cases. At the arraignment, {{the complaint}} or information is read out loud unless the <b>defendant</b> waives reading, and in a felony case the district attorney gives the <b>defendant</b> {{a copy of the}} information. The court then asks the <b>defendant</b> to submit a plea. The <b>defendant</b> may plead “guilty”, “no contest”, “not guilty”, or “{{not guilty by reason of}} mental disease or defect”. A plea of no contest has the same effect in a criminal case as a guilty plea, except it cannot be used as an admission of criminal action in a civil case. The <b>defendant</b> may not enter a plea of no contest without approval from the court. If the <b>defendant</b> pleads guilty or no contest, the court sentences the <b>defendant</b> or places the <b>defendant</b> on probation.
