5|$|Total {{production}} of slate in Wales declined from 54,000tons in 1958 to 22,000tons in 1970. The Diffwys quarry at Blaenau Ffestiniog closed in 1955 after almost {{two centuries of}} operation. The nearby Votty and Bowydd quarries closed in 1963. In 1969, the Dinorwig Quarry was closed, and over 300 quarrymen lost their jobs. The following year the Dorothea Quarry in the Nantlle Valley and the Braichgoch Slate Mine near Corris announced their closure. The Oakeley mine at Blaenau Ffestiniog closed in 1971, but was later reopened by another company. By 1972, {{the number of men}} employed in the North Wales slate industry was down to under 1,000. There was little alternative employment in the slate-producing areas, and the closures resulted in high unemployment and a drop in population as younger people moved away to find work. In 1979, after a long struggle, the government recognized silicosis as an <b>industrial</b> <b>disease</b> meriting compensation. There was an increase in demand for slate in the 1980s, and although this came too late for many quarries there was still some production in the Blaenau Ffestiniog area at the Oakeley, Llechwedd and Cwt-y-Bugail quarries, though the bulk of roofing slate production was at the Penrhyn Quarry. Further mechanization was introduced, with a computerized laser beam being used to aid the sawing of the slate blocks.|$|E

For, granting the entire population no larger than the ground can easily maintain,--that the classes are stringently divided,--and that there is sense or strength of hand enough with the rich to secure obedience; then, if nine-tenths of a nation are poor, the remaining tenth have the service of nine persons each;[116] but, if eight-tenths are poor, only of four each; if seven-tenths are poor, of two and a third each; but, practically if the rich strive always to obtain more power over the poor, instead of to raise them,--and if, on the other hand, the poor become continually more vicious and numerous, through neglect and oppression--though {{the range of the}} power of the rich increases, its tenure becomes less secure; until, at last, the measure of iniquity being full, revolution, civil war, or the subjection of the state to a healthier or stronger one, closes the moral corruption and <b>industrial</b> <b>disease.</b>|$|E

40|$|Background: The {{stress in}} the society seems to having become more amplified and more trying. Statistics show that the {{appearance}} of stress related <b>industrial</b> <b>diseases</b> have increased strikingly. What can be stressing at the workplace? The work conditions {{are not the only}} thing that causes stress but no matter what the causes are employers have to restore the employees to their former positions. How are companies dealing with the problems of stress in reality? Do they have formulated strategies for how to manage the problems? Purpose: The purpose with this essay is to try to see pattern in how companies manage and treat stress and stress related <b>industrial</b> <b>diseases.</b> Realization: To distinguish patterns in the stress handling process, ten respondents from two case companies has been interviewed. The respondents are divided into three categories, which are employees that have been subjected to stress, those above them and trade-union colleagues. They have answered questions concerning stress and how their companies manage the stress problems that have occurred, with focus on goals and strategies, co-ordination forms and leadership. Results: Within each group of respondents, some patterns can be seen regarding how companies have managed stress. However, the apprehension of stress management differs from one group to the other why, generally, there is not possible to distinguish any uniform patterns in the stress management...|$|R
