Unlike other Metroid games, enemies do not drop items, with the {{restoration}} of health and ammo occurring either by using the Navigation Booths, or employing of the Concentration technique, where Samus rests and replenishes missiles and health. Players can also use the Navigation Booths to save their progress. While there are power-ups scattered around the Bottle Ship, a few items are already equipped by Samus, but she agrees to wait to use them until commanding officer Adam Malkovich authorizes <b>her</b> <b>to</b> <b>do</b> so.

5|$|To ease her heartbreak and the {{rejection}} from her family, Silk turns to alcohol and chain smoking. She gains weight, {{causing her to}} lose her status as a sex symbol.

5|$|In 1913, Stevens {{arrived in}} Washington {{to take part}} in the June {{picketing}} of the Senate. She did not plan to stay, but Alice Paul convinced <b>her</b> <b>to</b> <b>do</b> so. She was hired by the NAWSA, and was assigned to the newly formed Congressional Union for Woman Suffrage (CUWS), which had been created by Alice Paul and Mary Ritter Beard. At that time, the Congressional Union was a subdivision of the NAWSA, though it operated independently. Stevens was hired to serve as executive secretary in Washington, D. C., as well as serve as regional organizer and was assigned the eastern district. Paul had divided the nation into quadrants of twelve states each and assigned Stevens to the eastern area, Mabel Vernon to the middle west, Anne Martin to the far west, and Maud Younger to the south. The regional organizers were tasked with educating groups about the suffrage bills that were in Congress and garnering support from each state for ratifying national suffrage. Rather than follow the previous strategy of achieving enfranchisement on a state-by-state basis, the Congressional Union Strategy was full federal approval. This issue, caused a rift in the suffrage movement at the 1913 Convention, causing Paul and her supporters to break ties with the NAWSA and become an independent organization.|$|E
