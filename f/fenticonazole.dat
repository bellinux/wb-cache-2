40|$|A {{double-blind}} {{clinical trial}} {{was performed to}} evaluate efficacy and tolerance of once-daily 2 % <b>fenticonazole</b> compared with 1 % cyciopyroxolamine spray applied for 2 - 4 weeks in 100 patients with cutaneous mycotic lesions. After treatment lasting 21. 9 ± 6. 7 or 22. 5 ± 6. 2 days, respectively, patients receiving <b>fenticonazole</b> or cyciopyroxolamine had negative microscopic findings and cultures were sterile. Comparable clinical improvement was observed in both treatment groups, with 91. 8 % and 89. 8 % of patients, respectively, receiving <b>fenticonazole</b> or cyciopyroxolamine being evaluated as cured or greatly improved. Following a drug-free period, the clinical evaluation of nine (20. 9 %) patients treated with <b>fenticonazole</b> and 14 (30. 4 %) treated with cyciopyroxolamine worsened. The incidence of side-effects was low; only one patient withdrew from treatment because of a slight itch. It is suggested that <b>fenticonazole</b> and cyciopyroxolamine are equally effective in eradi-cating cutaneous mycoses and that their efficacy and tolerance are comparable.

40|$|Two {{simple and}} {{sensitive}} high performance liquid chromatography–tandem mass spectrometry (HPLC–MS/MS) methods were developed and validated for {{the determination of}} <b>fenticonazole</b> in human plasma after percutaneous and intravaginal administration. Mifepristone {{was used as an}} internal standard (IS), and simple protein precipitation by acetonitrile containing 2 % acetic acid was utilized for extracting the analytes from the plasma samples. Chromatographic separation was performed on a Kinetex XB-C 18 column. The quantitation was performed by a mass spectrometer equipped with an electrospray ionization source in multiple reactions monitoring (MRM) positive ion mode using precursor-to-product ion transitions of m/z 455. 2 – 199. 1 for <b>fenticonazole</b> and m/z 430. 2 – 372. 3 for mifepristone. The validated linear ranges were 5 – 1000  pg/mL and 0. 1 – 20  ng/mL <b>fenticonazole</b> in plasma for the methods A and B, respectively. For the two methods, the accuracy data ranged from 85 % to 115 %, the intra- and inter-batch precision data were less than 15 %, the recovery data were more than 90 %, and no matrix interference was observed. The methods A and B were successfully validated and applied to the pharmacokinetic studies of <b>fenticonazole</b> gel in Chinese healthy volunteers after percutaneous and intravaginal administration, respectively...|$|E
40|$|The {{in vitro}} {{antibacterial}} {{activity of the}} antifungal compound <b>fenticonazole</b> was {{compared with those of}} clotrimazole, miconazole, tetracycline, and metronidazole against 177 strains of bacterial species associated with either bacterial vaginosis (BV) or skin infections by agar dilution MIC determinations. BV-associated Bacteroides isolates of the Bacteroides melaninogenicus-B. oralis group, Gardnerella vaginalis, Mobiluncus spp., and anaerobic, gram-positive cocci were highly susceptible to <b>fenticonazole,</b> clotrimazole, and miconazole; but Bacteroides spp. not associated with BV, Bacteroides ureolyticus and the Bacteroides fragilis group, were resistant. All Bacteroides strains were susceptible to metronidazole, but the susceptibility of G. vaginalis and Mobiluncus spp. varied. Among the skin bacteria, Staphylococcus aureus, coryneforms, and streptococci were highly susceptible to the imidazoles; but Staphylococcus epidermidis strains were generally resistant. This antibacterial activity may give <b>fenticonazole</b> a useful role in the topical treatment of vaginal discharge and in mycotic skin infections that are superinfected with bacteria...|$|E
40|$|The {{activity}} of <b>fenticonazole</b> was studied against 260 West and Southeast European vulvovaginal candidiasis isolates, and low MICs were displayed. <b>Fenticonazole</b> {{was assessed by}} European Committee on Antimicrobial Susceptibility Testing and CLSI microdilution methods for the first time, and the results showed excellent agreement (97 %) and significant interclass correlation coefficient (P < 0. 0001). Also, the levels of agreement for the results for itraconazole, fluconazole, and ketoconazole were 84 %, 90 %, and 98 % (P < 0. 0001), respectively.

40|$|<b>Fenticonazole</b> is a chiral {{antifungal}} agent, used {{in therapy}} as the racemic mixture. The investigation on the chirality of <b>fenticonazole</b> is {{reported in this}} study. rae-Fenticonazole was resolved by HPLC and by capillary electrophoresis (CE). The chiral stationary phase (CSP), used in HPLC, was Daicel OD-H, a commercial phase, which allowed the separate collection of the two enantiomers. The chiral selectors used for CE were some cyclodextrin derivatives. The analysis time required from CE was about the half the HPLC enantioseparation time. The biological activity of the rac-mixture and each individual enantiomer was tested against Cryptococcus neoformans and two Aspergillus nidulans strains. The minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC) evaluation showed that the eutomer was the enantiomer chromatographically more retained and had a longer migration time in the electrophoretic enantioseparation.

40|$|Female {{patients}} often visit physicians reporting {{symptoms of}} acute vulvovaginitis. They complain {{of pain and}} irritation and they seek immediate relief and no symptom recurrence. In the past few years, an increase in both the number of first-time incidents of vulvovaginal candidiasis (VVC) {{and the number of}} recurrent vulvovaginal candidiasis (RVVC) was noted in women of reproductive age. In recent studies infection by Candida species has been the most common reason of vulvovaginitis in Europe, and the second leading cause in the USA. Furthermore, an increased tolerance of the candida species to the broadly administered antifungal drugs has been observed. Therefore, investigation of the effectiveness of some new antifungal agents would be highly beneficial. AIMS This dissertation aimed in: A. The research of distribution of the Candida species in four groups of patients who present disturbance of the mucosa of vaginal microflora according to their medical history and to clinical and laboratory results: i) patients with Vulvovaginal Candidiasis (VVC), ii) patients with Recurent Vulvovaginal Candidiasis (RVVC), iii) women in pregnancy, iv) patients with type I and II diabetes. B. An in-vitro evaluation of the susceptibility of the isolated Candida species to two antifungal agents and their clinical efficacy was performed using a broth microdilution method. Two antifungal agents have been tested: i) a triazole, the itraconazole, a broadly per os administered antifungal drug, ii) an imidazole, the <b>fenticonazole</b> a novel topical agent, which was at phase III of clinical trials, in the drug approval procedure, when this project started. C. The retrospective project of in-vitro susceptibility of itraconazole and <b>fenticonazole,</b> that was tested {{for the very first time}} in Greek patients with: i) Vulvovaginal Candidiasis (VVC), ii) Recurent Vulvovaginal Candidiasis (RVVC), iii) pregnancy, iv) type 1 and 2 diabetes. D. The identification of pathogens such as Mycoplasma hominis, Ureoplasma urealyticum, Chlamydia trachomatis, Human Papilloma Virus, E. coli, Streptococcus agalactiae, Enterococcus faecalis that were probably responsible for the disturbance of the mucosa of vaginal microflora in the patient groups. E. The study of exogenous predisposing factors, such as antibiotics, oral contraceptives and highestrogen contraceptives for therapy, that according to international evidence provide the disturbance of the mucosa of vaginal microflora, having as result the presence of vulvovaginal candidosis. METHODS The guidelines M 27 -A 2 of CLSI (Clinical and Laboratory Standards Institute, USA) and those of Subcommittee on Antifungal Susceptibility Testing (AFST) of the ESCMID European Committee for Antimicrobial Susceptibility Testing (EUCAST), were followed while performing the broth microdilution methods to test the susceptibility of the Candida species. These guidelines did not include a method and specific break points for <b>fenticonazole.</b> Consequently, we performed a new, pilot, experimental procedure to test <b>fenticonazole</b> using the break points of itraconazole because they both have similar chemical characteristics (water-insoluble substances). The results of the two broth microdilution reference methods had been compared and no difference of statististical significance was found. The use of these two reference methods validates the credibility of results*. We also examined the clinical efficacy of the antifungal drugs according to the percentages of cure or recurrence.

40|$|Secretion of aspartic (acid) proteinase by Candida albicans is {{inhibited}} by {{the action}} of a new anticandidal agent, L-lysyl-L-norvalyl-[N 3 -(4 -methoxyfumaroyl) ]-L- 2, 3 -diamino pro panoic acid (Lys-Nva-FMDP), at low, even sub-minimum inhibitory concentrations. The observed phenomenon is a direct consequence of inhibition of the enzyme, glucosamine- 6 -phosphate synthase. As a result of this inhibition, biosynthesis of candidal mannoproteins is markedly reduced. A possible correlation between general inhibition of mannoprotein biosynthesis and acid proteinase secretion is suggested. The reported inhibition of acid proteinase secretion by Lys-Nva-FMDP is more specific than the previously described effects of methyl patricin, 5 -fluorocytosine and <b>fenticonazole...</b>|$|E
40|$|Introduction. Uncomplicated vulvovaginal {{candidiasis}} appears in 75 % women of reproductive age. The most frequent causes are Candida albicans (85 - 95 %) or C. glabrata, and infrequently C. krusei, C. tropicalis, C. parapsilosis, C. pseudotropicalis, etc. Objective. The {{aim of the}} study was to investigate efficiency and safety of <b>fenticonazole</b> for vaginal candidiasis treatment. Methods. Therapeutic effect of a single 600 mg fenticonasole vaginal capsule was observed in 417 women, aged 16 - 67, in five centers in Serbia. In all women, before the treatment, vaginal candidiasis was confirmed by testing of vaginal smear. Based on smear findings and associated symptoms observed on the 7 th and 28 th day after therapy administration, treatment results were evaluated. On the next day after drug application the patients recorded by using a questionnaire their own feelings on withdrawal symptoms and possible side effects in the period prior to the first control. Results. Control after seven days showed a statistically significant decrease of symptoms. In 385 women, vaginal smear was found negative to yeast and yeast blastospores. Within the first seven days after treatment 84 women had to repeat therapy due to the persistence of symptoms or positive vaginal smear. After 28 days we recorded full recovery in 392 patients, clinical improvement in eight, no change in 16, and deterioration in one patient only. Side effects were very seldom, mostly in the form of a slight redness of the vulva and vagina, and mild itching during several days. Conclusion. Our observations confirmed good efficacy and safety of <b>fenticonazole</b> in the treatment of vaginal candidiasis...|$|E
40|$|The {{antifungal}} minimal inhibitory concentrations (MIC) {{were determined}} to 35 samples of Candidaalbicans; 14 of them were isolated from HIV-positive patients, and 21 from HIV-negative patients with oral erythematouscandidosis. The {{aim of this study}} was to evaluate the performance of agar dilution method in the determination ofsusceptibility of Candida albicans isolated from buccal lesions of HIV-positive and negative patients to some antifungalsand compare the results with the plasmatic concentration reached by each one of these drugs. The samples were evaluated invitro by the agar dilution method and showed higher MIC values to ketoconazole, fluconazole, itraconazole andamphotericin B than the concentrations achieved by these antifungals in plasma. 88. 9 % of the samples presented in vitroresistance to ketoconazole and the plasmatic levels of this antifungal varied from 1 to 8 μg/mL. Regarding fluconazole anditraconazole, most samples presented MIC larger than 128 μg/mL and plasmatic concentration varying from 0. 4 to 8 μg/mL. Only 11. 9 % of the samples were susceptible in vitro to fluconazole and 2. 7 % of them to itraconazol. The usageconcentrations prescribed for the topical antifungals nystatin, <b>fenticonazole</b> and miconazole are markedly higher than thevalues of MIC obtained. Related to nystatin, it was verified that its MIC values were between 1 and 4 μg /mL. Theplasmatic levels to this drug are extremely low. <b>Fenticonazole</b> presented a MIC value larger than 128 μg/mL. Relating tomiconazole, the plasmatic levels vary from 1 to 8 μg/mL and 11. 9 % of the samples presented in vitro susceptibility to thisdrug. No significant differences (p< 0. 05) were found in the susceptibility profiles of the samples obtained from HIVpositiveand HIV-negative patients...|$|E

40|$|The {{effect of}} antimycotics on {{secretory}} aspartate (acid) proteinase, a virulence enzyme of Candida albicans, was investigated. The {{conditions of the}} study were such as to induce proteinase production in the stationary phase of growth (25 - 40 hours), when no antifungal tested, except the polyene derivative methyl partricin, significantly reduced the viability of the culture. Among azole derivatives, <b>fenticonazole</b> (FZ) but not miconazole, fluconazole or ketoconazole, exerted strong inhibition on proteinase, in typical dose-diphasic pattern, (0. 01 microgram/ml; 1 - 10 micrograms/ml). 5 -fluorocytosine (5 -FC) was also inhibitory at a dose interval 1 - 10 micrograms/ml. In all cases, the inhibition concerned the synthesis of the enzyme rather that its activity as suggested by the results of comparative ELISA, SDS-PAGE and spectrophotometric methods of proteinase detection. Finally, the inhibition of proteinase production by FZ and 5 -FC mainly reflected the effect of these antimycotics on general protein synthesis...|$|E
40|$|In {{the present}} work, cyclodextrin-modified micellar {{electrokinetic}} chromatography (CD-MEKC) method {{was developed and}} applied for enantioseparation of three imidazole drugs and vinpocetine. The three imidazole drugs namely tioconazole, isoconazole and <b>fenticonazole</b> were simultaneously separated {{for the first time}} by MEKC technique using dual cyclodextrin (CD) approach. A combination of two neutral CDs; 2 -hydroxypropyl-�-CD (HP-�-CD) and heptakis (2, 6 -di-O-methyl) -�-CD (DM-�-CD) (35 mM: 10 mM) in background electrolyte (BGE) containing 35 mM phosphate buffer (pH 7. 0), 50 mM sodium dodecyl sulfate (SDS) and 15 % (v/v) acetonitrile at 27 kV and 30 oC gave the best separation of six stereoisomers of imidazole drugs with resolutions, Rs 1. 90 - 27. 22 and peak efficiencies, N > 180 000 in less than 15 min. The samples were injected electrokinetically at 3 kV for 3 s and detection was carried out at 200 nm. The method was linear over the concentration range of 25 - 200 mg/L (r 2 > 0. 998) and the detection limits (S/N = 3) of the three imidazole drugs were found to be 2. 7 - 7. 7 mg/L. The CD-MEKC method was successfully applied to the determination of the three imidazole drugs in spiked human urine to give mean recoveries ranging from 72. 3 to 107. 5 % (RSD < 6 %, n = 3). The method was also applied to the analysis of commercial cream formulation of tioconazole and isoconazole. Good mean recoveries were obtained, ranging from 93. 6 - 100 % (RSD < 7 %, n = 3). The best chiral separation of vinpocetine that gave four resolved peaks was achieved using 40 mM HP-�-CD in 50 mM phosphate buffer (pH 7. 0) consisting of 40 mM SDS and 10 % v/v acetonitrile at a separation temperature of 25 oC and separation voltage 25 kV. Samples were injected electrokinetically at 5 kV for 7 s. Vinpocetine detection was accomplished using diode array detector at 200 nm. The complete vinpocetine separation was achieved in less than 15 min with peak resolution, Rs 1. 40 - 5. 80...|$|E
