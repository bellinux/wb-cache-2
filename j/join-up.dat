50|$|The 55th Army's {{objective}} was to break open the vital Leningrad-Moscow Highway, starting from its jump-off position in Kolpino towards Tosno; it was to <b>join-up</b> with a northbound pincer attack of the 54th Army of the Volkhov Front, thereby encircling German formations in the Mga sector. The highway is an important road/railway connection linking Moscow and Leningrad. The pivot-point for this highway was Krasny Bor, situated between the highway and the railway line. 55th Army's attack would also hit sectors defended by other German formations which were established to secure flanks and draw them into battle. Once this attack had succeeded, the plan was for the second echelon forces to advance through the gap towards Tosno. The attack was planned for February 10, 1943 and was to jump off from Kolpino.

40|$|Effective {{training}} of horses {{relies on the}} trainer’s awareness of learning theory and equine ethology, and should be undertaken with skill and time. Some trainers, such as Monty Roberts, share their methods {{through the medium of}} public demonstrations. This paper describes the opportunistic analysis of beat-to-beat (RR) intervals and heart rate variability (HRV) of ten horses being used in Monty Roberts’ public demonstrations within the United Kingdom. RR and HRV was measured in the stable before training and during training. The HRV variables standard deviation of the RR interval (SDRR), root mean square of successive RR differences (RMSSD), geometric means standard deviation 1 (SD 1) and 2 (SD 2), along with the low and high frequency ratio (LF/HF ratio) were calculated. The minimum, average and maximum RR intervals were significantly lower in training (indicative of an increase in heart rate as measured in beats-per-minute) than in the stable (p = 0. 0006; p = 0. 01; p = 0. 03). SDRR, RMSSD, SD 1, SD 2 and the LF/HF ratio were all significantly lower in training than in the stable (p = 0. 001; p = 0. 049; p = 0. 049; p = 0. 001; p = 0. 01). When comparing the HR and HRV of horses during <b>Join-up</b> ® to overall training, {{there were no significant differences}} in any variable with the exception of maximum RR which was significantly lower (p = 0. 007) during <b>Join-up</b> ®, indicative of short increases in physical exertion (canter) associated with this training exercise. In conclusion, {{training of}} horses during public demonstrations is a low-moderate physiological, rather than psychological stressor for horses. The physiological stress responses observed within this study were comparable or less to those previously reported in the literature for horses being trained outside of public audience events. Furthermore, there is no evidence that the use of <b>Join-up</b> ® alters HR and HRV in a way to suggest that this training method negatively affects the psychological welfare of horses...|$|E

40|$|Purpose – The {{purpose of}} this paper is to provide an update to a review of the joint working {{literature}} in the field of health and social care for adults, with particular emphasis given to the experiences of users and carers. Design/methodology/approach – The aims of the literature review remained largely the same as those of the original, they were to identify: models of joint working, evidence of effectiveness and cost-effectiveness and the factors promoting or hindering the models. However, to reflect the growing interest in the experiences of users and carers a fourth aim was added to map these experiences. Given their prominence in terms of policy debates about integration, the review focused on jointly organised services for older people and people with mental health problems in the UK only. Findings – The review demonstrates tentative signs that some initiatives designed to <b>join-up</b> or integrate services can deliver outcomes desired by government. Importantly some studies that report the experiences of users of services and carers suggest that they perceive benefits from efforts to <b>join-up</b> or integrate services. However it is our contention that the evidence is less than compelling and does not justify the faith invested in the strategy by current or previous governments. Originality/value – The study updates our knowledge of the impact of joint working in the field of health and social care for adults. Importantly the paper highlights what is known about the experiences of users and carers of joint/integrated services...|$|E

40|$|The {{proliferation}} of policy think tanks and more broadly {{the rise of}} ‘policy networks’ {{can be viewed as}} indicative of important global transformations {{in the nature of the}} state. That is, the emergence of new state modalities, with a shift away from government towards forms of polycentric governance, where policy is produced through multiple agencies and multiple sites of discourse generation. This paper addresses some particular aspects of this shift by focusing on a set of relationships and sites which have had some kind of influence upon the social and educational policies of UK New Labour governments. It has two main concerns. First, focusing on the generation and circulation of some of the key policy ‘ideas’ of New Labour, it maps out a related and overlapping set of policy networks which <b>join‐up</b> government, think tanks and some individual interlockers, who ‘straddle sectors and policy fields and settings’.

40|$|The {{article will}} explore {{the history of}} {{vocational}} services very briefly, explore recent policy shifts and ask why, despite so many shifts in policy and programme, disabled young peoples’ access to training and employment are still very limited. A reading of UK vocational and post school policy over {{the last ten years}} would lead a reasonable observer to conclude that disabled young people had never been as well supported and protected in their search for economic belonging and wellbeing. Policy has shifted towards mainstreaming and emphasised disabled peoples’ right to live ordinary lives and to realise their expectations. However, institutional discrimination, credentialism and inaccessible learning and training environments are all seen as important. Access to employment and training are two key issues for disabled young people attempting to get a foothold in contemporary society. Their social inclusion and economic standing remain closely linked to their entry to the world of paid work. Despite major policy shifts aimed at enhancing the social inclusion of disabled young people and similar efforts to <b>join-up</b> post school training, qualifications and employment support systems, there remain real barriers to disabled young people getting equal treatment and opportunities. This article will largely explore the vocational position of disabled young people in England, but will also draw on some key findings from Wales and Scotland which inform policy analyses in this area...|$|E

The lack of available capacity within the regional labour market coupled with the poor image of the sector, call into question the industry’s ability to cope with the levels of new orders and output growth predicted over the next few years. In this paper, it is argued that the casualised nature of the industry’s labour market has rendered national, ‘top-down’ labour market policy measures ineffective in addressing the industry’s skills concerns. This hypothesis has been explored through research that canvassed the opinions of key industry stakeholders as to the actions necessary to avert the region’s skills crisis. This was achieved through a series of focus groups and workshops involving over 150 individuals with a vested interest in the region’s construction skills situation. The insights emerging from the analysis suggested that bespoke regional and sub-regional labour market policies are required to avert the current skills shortage. The recommendations provided by the participants were used as the basis for a strategic package of measures that are currently being implemented across the region’s five counties.

40|$|This paper {{highlights}} {{the connection between}} the International Criminal Court’s Office of the Prosecutor and the field of transitional justice. This overlapping relationship is ultimately based on the common ambition of preventing international crimes in conflict-affected states. The paper’s specific focus is on how to improve the OTP’s existing language and discourse through an accompanying transitional justice vocabulary, in order to help enhance the prevention mission. It firstly appraises how that mission is translated into the OTP’s institutional objective to maximise its preventive impact, and identifies how it is currently beset with complexities that have not been adequately addressed. It then considers the current conceptual attraction to legalism within OTP language, declarations and pronouncements, and explores the limitations and negative consequences. Legalism is critically a theoretical dogma ill-equipped at capturing the social and political complexities of domestic societies shaped by conflict and post-conflict momentums. Given this, any purported preventive impact of the OTP is significantly reduced. In light of the prevailing arguments, conceptual and substantive evidence will justify the OTP as a transitional justice actor in those situations shaped by and demanding it. Therefore the paper makes the case for the OTP to adopt an accompanying transitional justice focus within its language and discourse. Through adopting a multifaceted and reasoned case for its prosecution decision-making in conflict-affected situations, the OTP could better dovetail itself into inclusive domestic transitional justice strategies. This would allow a more local and domestic contestation of ICC prosecutions including a fuller assessment as to how and why they contribute to a range of transitional reforms on the ground. In so doing the OTP could fully integrate and <b>join-up</b> its justice mandate with domestic transitional agendas, and ultimately help establish the social and political forces necessary to prevent future crimes...|$|E

The authors assess and reflect on this activity, funded through the European Regional Development Fund (ERDF) to help understand the inputs, processes and outcomes of that relationship. Approach / Methodology The approach undertaken was firstly to identify the ERDF-funded projects since 2002 that the VAR (Quadra Solutions Ltd) has been a part of, as a private sector partner, with the HEI (Lancaster University’s Engineering Department). This is defined as where there is a service level agreement in place and the provision of match-funding is committed-to in that contract. This differs from that of a sub-contractor where the relationship may be better defined as purchaser-supplier and emphasizes the collaborative nature of the relationship being explored. We subsequently identified the ‘interventions’ in which both the knowledge exchange team (Lancaster Product Development Unit) and Quadra Solutions Ltd had worked with a ‘beneficiary’ as part of those ERDF initiatives. Retaining confidential information, these interventions were aggregated and basic company information collected in terms of location, size (by turnover) and sector. Analysis was then undertaken on the results collected as a consequence of that intervention, based on the following economic key performance indicators (KPIs) : businesses improving performance; safeguarding of jobs; and the creation of new jobs. Qualitative reflection was carried out to assess wider impacts of the relationship {{and the development of a}} model that articulates this way of working. We highlight both the benefits and drawbacks based on extensive experience of providing technology-transfer solutions to SMEs, part-funded by ERDF. Results The results show that 93 interventions have been undertaken between Lancaster University’s Engineering Department and Quadra Solutions Ltd, in-part funded by ERDF between 2003 and 2015, spanning seven major projects. All of these interventions supported technology transfer by the introduction of a new or enhanced design process within the beneficiary, using the Autodesk family of software. All beneficiaries receiving support were SMEs, complying with national and regional eligibility guidelines as defined by the funding body secretariat. Sectoral breakdown unsurprisingly shows that the vast majority were in the engineering/manufacturing sector, accounting for 94. 6 % of the total. Of those SMEs that were assisted, all received increased functionality via the introduction or improvement to design software than that previously being used, demonstrating clear technology transfer. Where data was obtained, this intervention led to the cumulative safeguarding of 102. 1 jobs and the creation of 71 jobs. As noted elsewhere, there is considerable ambiguity in using figures that attempt to provide a unit cost per result, and whilst one can attempt to draw comparison with other initiatives in other areas, this can be problematic due to assumptions made. For the purposes of this investigation, we have benchmarked against ourselves and show that for all cumulative ERDF assistance provided by the Engineering Department, the average job created per intervention is 0. 64 and the average job safeguarded is 0. 91. For the technology transfer work carried out in partnership with Quadra Solutions Ltd, the figures are 0. 76 and 1. 10, respectively. More widely, there are other impacts from joint collaboration with private sector partners that have been created, for the HEI: • Clear access to the latest in engineering design functionality, informed by globally-operating OEMs spanning many sectors; • Provision of a match-funding contribution through the time of company representatives contributing towards the objectives of the project; • Sharing of a networks of users and manufactures in close proximity, with a ‘seal-of-approval’ for quality of work; • Local, regional, national and international market intelligence; • Formalisation in the pursuit of similar objectives; • Contribution to the state-of-the-art and hence vital commercial-sector input to other future programmes of business support. The benefits created by such a relationship for private sector partners include: • Promotion of joint-funding opportunities to potential beneficiaries generating in-house advocates, or ‘funding champions’; • Ability to <b>join-up</b> wider business-support allied to technology transfer, which may include time-bound financial incentives, training offers, subscriptions, hardware support and so on. • Increased knowledge and experience of public-funding processes, regulations and conditions; • Externally-visible partnerships with a world-ranked university. Arguably the most important benefits relate to the end-user, which in this case is the beneficiary. The following model outlines a typical journey taken by a beneficiary through the technology acquisition route of intervention. Additional benefits to the beneficiaries in these cases may include: • Increased ability to develop new products • Awareness of how new technology processes can be further exploited, such as through expansion, training, add-ons; • A route into higher education to explore other research and development opportunities that may exist beyond that of the intervention; Implications and Recommendations The authors fully accept that there are a number of issues with the data collected which include that our assessment methods: • Only take account of the reported results when/if engaged with the beneficiary. Some beneficiaries become reluctant to undertake evaluation after the assistance has been delivered. • It does not record the exact time input to each intervention made by either the HEI or the VAR. • The package of support (or agreed solution) has not been specified and will include some differences, in this case in software, including for example upgrades or new packages. Notwithstanding some of the limitations outlined above, we have been able to demonstrate that the work carried-out by the partnership of a private sector VAR and an HEI to support SMEs in technology transfer has clear, demonstrable impact, both quantitatively and qualitatively. Such a model can be applied to future initiatives that have technology transfer as a theme within business support. Areas for development / future research There are a number of important areas underpinned by this work that would be useful to explore further: • Sector transference, for example application in other disciplines requiring software, such as for example architecture, construction, chemicals, food and drink, creative. • Technology transference, for example application of using other technologies beyond software, such as for example, manufacturing hardware. • Longer-term assessment of the impact to beneficiaries of these interventions, which may include aspects related to innovation culture, new product development or increased capacity for R&D. • Exploration of opportunities that may be available beyond the intervention provided, by the HEI, such as access to graduates, and the ‘completion of the circle’...|$|E
