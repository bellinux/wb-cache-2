25|$|A tram system {{known as}} the Milwaukee Connector was {{proposed}} and passed by the Common Council, but Mayor Tom Barrett vetoed the bill because of problems of cost and availability. A modern streetcar system, the Milwaukee Streetcar, is now being constructed to connect the Milwaukee <b>Intermodal</b> <b>Station,</b> downtown Milwaukee, and Ogden Avenue, at a projected cost of$122million. The line is expected to open in mid-2018.|$|E
25|$|Besides this, {{most of the}} {{stations}} have connections with different bus lines. At the same time, Urbinaga Station was built {{with the intention of}} connecting lines C1 and C2 of Cercanías and Ansio Station with a bus terminal. However, these connection projects have not been finished as of 2011. Eventually the Urbinaga project was restarted in 2009. That future <b>intermodal</b> <b>station</b> will also take advantage of the future Leioa-Urbinaga Tram. Its construction was expected to start at the end of 2009.|$|E
25|$|Caltrain {{passengers}} may {{transfer to}} BART at the Millbrae <b>Intermodal</b> <b>Station</b> for {{travel to the}} San Francisco International Airport. Currently, Caltrain riders looking to transfer to the airport must also change BART trains at San Bruno station during weekdays before 7pm, as BART has eliminated direct service from Milbrae to SFO during those times; direct BART service between Millbrae and SFO still exists on nights and weekends. Prior {{to the opening of}} the airport extension in 2003 a free shuttle bus operated between Millbrae and the airport.|$|E

25|$|Basauri's town hall, {{along with}} the {{neighbouring}} towns, requested the construction of another station in Basauri, {{in the neighborhood of}} Sarratu. That station would work as an interchange station for different means of transportation. In the last months of 2009, Metro Bilbao announced that it would consider the creation of that station in Basauri, as it would work as an <b>intermodal</b> <b>station</b> for the services of Euskotren Trena; FEVE (which only has cargo services in that location); and even with Line 5 of the metro.|$|E
25|$|On February 10, 2015, a {{streetcar}} {{connecting the}} Milwaukee <b>Intermodal</b> <b>Station</b> with the city's {{lower east side}} {{was approved by the}} Common Council, bringing if not to a halt then at least to a pause, decades of sometimes acrimonious debate. On a 9–6 vote, the council approved a measure that established the project's $124 million capital budget, its estimated $3.2 million operating and maintenance budget and its 2.5-mile route, which includes a lakefront spur connecting the line to the proposed $122 million, 44-story Couture. Construction on the Milwaukee Streetcar will start March 2017, with initial operation by mid-2018. The Lakefront service is expected to start operation by 2019.|$|E
25|$|The San Francisco Bay Area {{has seen}} {{expansions}} beyond its original vision, {{such as the}} Silicon Valley BART extension, Oakland Airport Connector, the East Contra Costa BART Extension. BART and Caltrain jointly opened Millbrae station in 2003 – the largest <b>intermodal</b> <b>station</b> west of the Mississippi. San Francisco's Muni Metro has expanded service to via the sequential Third Street Light Rail Project and Central Subway (with plans for a third extension underway). The heritage streetcar service was extended to Fisherman's Wharf via constructing light rail infrastructure {{in place of the}} demolished Embarcadero Freeway, and the E Embarcadero streetcar service entered regular service in 2015 providing a link between the waterfront and Caltrain. City Supervisor Scott Wiener called for sustained subway construction throughout San Francisco.|$|E

2500|$|In April, 2002, {{the city}} of Lynchburg celebrated {{the opening of the}} newly {{restored}} Kemper Street station. [...] The restoration allowed the facility to take on the new role of <b>intermodal</b> <b>station,</b> housing both rail and bus services. [...] Amtrak operations were moved to the ground-floor platform level, left vacant since the station no longer serviced freight trains. [...] This allowed for Greyhound Lines to establish a bus terminal in the vacated street-level passenger facility, thus centralizing Lynchburg's primary services for intercity passenger travel under one roof.|$|E
2500|$|A 0.5% {{sales tax}} was {{proposed}} for the counties of Milwaukee, Racine, and Kenosha by the Southeast Wisconsin Regional Transit Authority to fund the KRM (Kenosha-Racine-Milwaukee) Commuter Rail project serving those cities {{as well as several}} other stops on the route. [...] A connection to Metra commuter rail in Kenosha was planned with some trains continuing to Chicago. [...] In Milwaukee, the line was to terminate at the Milwaukee <b>Intermodal</b> <b>Station.</b> [...] In June 2011, authorizing legislation for regional transit authorities in Wisconsin was repealed, leading to the dissolution of the Southeastern Regional Transit Authority, which was leading the commuter rail planning in southeastern Wisconsin. [...] The project is currently on indefinite hold.|$|E

2500|$|The {{concept of}} a Caltrain {{extension}} to Monterey County has been considered since at least 1996, with the cities of Salinas and Watsonville considering rail station improvements and construction between 1996 and 1998, culminating in a TAMC-sponsored Extension of Caltrain Commuter Service to Monterey County Business Plan in 2000. The proposed extension would create new stations and stops in Pajaro (serving Watsonville in adjacent Santa Cruz County at an estimated cost of [...] ) and Castroville (at an estimated cost of [...] ) before terminating at the existing Salinas, Amtrak station with Coast Starlight service. The Salinas station would be rebuilt as an <b>intermodal</b> <b>station</b> to connect commuter rail with Monterey-Salinas Transit buses.
