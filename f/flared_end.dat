40|$|Objectives. Endoscopic {{management}} of bile leak after orthotopic liver transplant (OLT) is widely accepted. Preliminary studies demonstrated encouraging results for covered self-expandable metal stents (CSEMS) in complex bile leaks. Methods. Thirty-one patients with post-OLT bile leaks underwent endoscopic temporary placement of CSEMS (3 partially CSEMS, 18 fully CSEMS with fins and 10 fully CSEMS with <b>flare</b> <b>ends)</b> between December 2003 and December 2010. Long-term clinical success and safety were evaluated. Results. Median stent indwelling and follow-up were 89 and 1, 353 days for PCSEMS, 102 and 849 for FCSEMS with fins and 98 and 203 for FCSEMS with <b>flare</b> <b>ends.</b> Clinical success was achieved in 100 %, 77. 8 %, and 70 %, respectively. Postplacement complications: cholangitis (1) and proximal migration (1), {{both in the}} FCSEMS with fins. Postremoval complications were biliary strictures requiring drainage: PCSEMS (1), FCSEMS with fins (6) and with <b>flare</b> <b>ends</b> (1). There was {{no significant differences in}} the FCSEMS groups regarding clinical success, age, gender, leak location, previous treatment, stent indwelling, and complications. Conclusion. Temporary placement of CSEMS is effective to treat post-OLT biliary leaks. However, a high number of post removal biliary strictures occurred especially in the FCSEMS with fins.

50|$|In medicine, a nasopharyngeal airway, {{also known}} as an NPA, nasal trumpet (because of its <b>flared</b> <b>end),</b> or nose hose, a type of airway adjunct, is a tube that is {{designed}} to be inserted into the nasal passageway to secure an open airway. When a patient becomes unconscious, the muscles in the jaw commonly relax and can allow the tongue to slide back and obstruct the airway. This makes airway management necessary, and an NPA is one of the available tools. The purpose of the <b>flared</b> <b>end</b> is to prevent the device from becoming lost inside the patient's nose.|$|E

40|$|A {{solar flare}} is an {{explosive}} release of stored magnetic energy on the Sun. Much of this energy is converted into x-ray photons which escape into space. As a solar flare begins, the 1 - 8 Å x-ray photon flux at Earth’s orbit, {{as measured by}} the GOES satellite, rapidly increases. It quickly reaches a peak and slowly decays. A plot of this flux exhibits an approximate lognormal shape. A lognormal function becomes a normal, symmetric, function when the logarithm of the independent variable is taken. Once the peak flux is reached, this symmetry is used to make a prediction of the <b>flare</b> <b>end</b> time. Examining over 1300 flares, an improvement in the <b>flare</b> <b>end</b> time prediction over the current climatological method is demonstrated. Predictions of the evolution of the flux prior to reaching the peak flux are also made beginning five minutes after flare onset. An effort to predict the temporal evolution prior to the peak is made using a fourth order least squares fit to the rise-phase flux alone and the rise-phase flux plus an estimate of the decay flux. Using both methods, accurate predictions of the x-ray flux evolution ar...|$|R

40|$|To {{evaluate}} the potential utility of a self-expandable intratracheal nitinol stent with <b>flared</b> <b>ends</b> {{for the treatment}} of tracheal collapse in dogs, endotracheal stenting therapy was performed under fluoroscopic guidance in four dogs with severe tracheal collapse. During the 4 to 7 month follow-up, after stent implantation, clinical signs, including dyspnea and respiratory distress, dramatically improved in all dogs. The radiographs showed that the implanted stents improved the tracheal collapse, and there were no side effects such as collapse, shortening or migration of the stents. In conclusion, the self-expandable intratracheal nitinol stents provided adequate stability to the trachea and were effective for attenuating the clinical signs associated with severe tracheal collapse...|$|R
