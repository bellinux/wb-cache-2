5|$|The bovids have various {{methods of}} social {{organisation}} and social behaviour, which are classified into solitary and gregarious behaviour. Further, these types may each {{be divided into}} territorial and nonterritorial behaviour. Small bovids such as the klipspringer, oribi, and steenbok are generally solitary and territorial. They hold small territories into which {{other members of the}} species are not allowed to enter. These antelopes form monogamous pairs. Many species such as the <b>dik-dik</b> use pheromone secretions from the preorbital glands and sometimes dung, as well, to mark their territories. The offspring disperse at the time of adolescence, and males need must acquire territories prior to mating. The bushbuck is the only bovid that is both solitary and not territorial. This antelope hardly displays aggression, and tends to isolate itself or form loose herds, though in a favourable habitat, several bushbuck may be found quite close to one another.|$|E
25|$|Only male dik-diks sport horns, {{which are}} {{approximately}} 3 inches long, corrugated, and backward-slanted. Horns of male Kirk's <b>dik-dik</b> may be straight or curved backwards from {{the profile of}} the face and the basal half of the horns have seven to nine annular ridges, that are frequently covered by the crest. Kirk's <b>dik-dik</b> are sexually dimorphic: females are larger and lack horns, while males sport a more developed muzzle, a longer crest, and tend to be lighter in color. Though physically very similar the Kirk's <b>dik-dik</b> can be distinguished from Guenthers’ <b>dik-dik</b> due to its longer nasals and premaxillae and shorter proboscis, which gives the head a more wedged-shaped profile than that of Guenther's <b>dik-dik.</b>|$|E
25|$|<b>Dik-dik</b> are herbivorous {{and their}} diets consist mainly of foliage, fruits, shoots, and berries. Due to their adaptations <b>dik-dik</b> are water {{independent}} {{and rely on}} vegetation {{as a source of}} water. Kirk's dik-diks are concentrate selectors, feeding selectively on dicotyledonous plants that can be rapidly fermented and digested. This includes leaves and fruit high in nutrients and water but low in fiber and cellulose. According to Hofmann (1973) and Hoope et al. (1983), grasses are only consumed when they are germinating and Kirk's <b>dik-dik</b> have stomach capacities and mass that consist of 8.5–10.0% of body mass when full and 2.2% when empty". As further explained by Hofmann (1973), because of the aforementioned facts and their high food requirements, Kirk's <b>dik-dik</b> feed and ruminate periodically throughout day and nighttime. Hendrichs (1975) stated that, they consume roughly 3.8% of their body mass daily.|$|E
50|$|<b>Dik-diks</b> live in shrublands and savannas {{of eastern}} Africa. <b>Dik-diks</b> seek {{habitats}} with a plentiful supply of edible {{plants such as}} shrubs. <b>Dik-diks</b> may live in places as varied as dense forest or open plain, but they require good cover and not too much tall grass. They usually live in pairs in territories of about 5 ha. The territories are often in low, shrubby bushes (sometimes along dry, rocky streambeds) with plenty of cover. <b>Dik-diks,</b> with their dusty colored coat, are able {{to blend in with}} their surroundings. <b>Dik-diks</b> have an established series of runways through and around the borders of their territories that are used when they feel threatened.|$|R
2500|$|<b>Dik-diks</b> are {{susceptible}} to a myriad of predators including eagles, cats, jackals, caracals, leopards, hyenas, cheetahs, cape hunting dogs, honey badgers, crocodiles, pythons, lions, and humans. Young <b>dik-diks</b> are particularly preyed upon by baboons, genets, and eagles. <b>Dik-diks</b> have a fine-tuned sense of hearing, sight, and smell. When they feel in danger or hear the alarm calls of other animals they hide, rather than fleeing. It is only when frightened or disturbed that they emit their iconic [...] "zik-zik" [...] alarm.|$|R
5000|$|Apparently {{to prevent}} overheating, <b>dik-diks</b> have {{elongated}} snouts with bellows-like muscles through which blood is pumped. Airflow and subsequent evaporation cools this blood {{before it is}} recirculated to the body. However, this panting is only implemented in extreme conditions; <b>dik-diks</b> can tolerate air temperatures of up to [...]|$|R
25|$|Behaviorally, dik-diks {{are highly}} nocturnal {{and during the}} daytime seek shade to rest {{throughout}} the hottest parts {{of the day to}} help avoid the loss of valuable fluids. Dik-diks are also highly selective when browsing on succulents, herbs, and foliage as to maximize fluid acquisition. The hind legs of the Kirk's <b>dik-dik</b> are longer and are structurally more uniform, than the forelegs. Hopwood 1936 suggests that, this helps the hind legs propel the <b>dik-dik</b> forward, as the relatively short forelegs of dik-diks are more efficient at ascending broken terrain".|$|E
25|$|Kirk's dik-diks {{are highly}} adapted to {{surviving}} in the arid regions of eastern Africa. They have a hairy proboscis with tiny slit-like nostrils, {{a feature that}} is most pronounced in the Guenther's <b>dik-dik.</b> This proboscis contains an enlarged nasal chamber that is supplied with a rich amount of blood that is cooled via rapid nasal panting. Panting through their snouts leads to airflow and evaporation that cools the blood before it is pumped back into the body.2 This process is also efficient, because it results in a minimal loss {{of water in the}} exhaled air. Water and energy conserving methods, such as fluctuating body temperatures, lowered metabolic rates, concentrated urine, and dry feces all contribute to the ability of the <b>dik-dik</b> to survive harsh arid climates. Further, as observed by Hoppe 1977b, Kamau 1988, and Maloiy et al., 1988, they also conserve fluids by licking dew from their nose and reabsorbing water from their feces. When compared to cattle, <b>dik-dik</b> have a significantly lower density of sweat glands.|$|E
25|$|As {{noted by}} Tinley (1969), typical {{habitats}} of Kirk's <b>dik-dik</b> consist of thicket mosaics characterized by well-developed shrub layers and scant short grass cover. Dik-diks live in pairs on territories of 2–86 acres, depending on cover and resources. If no unfavorable events occur {{a pair of}} Kirk's <b>dik-dik</b> may reside within the same territory for life. Males are the main defenders of territories, as females are unable to maintain territories themselves. (Kingdon 1982) According to MacDonald (1985), territorial conflicts over quality habitat are not frequent, however, when do they occur, males charge one another, stopping just short of physical contact, before repeating the process by running from a longer distance. Furthermore, the encounter ends when one male surrenders, which results in both males scratching at the ground, urinating, and defecating".|$|E
40|$|Animals living around humans may habituate to us, {{but little}} is known about the {{consequences}} of this habituation. Some wildlife managers assume that habituation to humans makes individuals less likely to respond to natural predators, which is something to be avoided in captive breeding programmes where animals are destined for release. We conducted a playback experiment where we broadcast the sounds of a terrestrial predator and the song from a non-threatening bird to Gunther's <b>dik-diks</b> (Madoqua guentheri), a small ungulate that is vulnerable to many predators, in areas where <b>dik-diks</b> were and were not habituated to humans. Contrary to our expectation, habituated <b>dik-diks</b> discriminated the predator sounds from the birdsong, while unhabituated <b>dik-diks</b> failed to make this discrimination. Our results demonstrate that humans may influence predation hazard assessment, but we should not generally assume that human-habituated animals will be especially vulnerable to predators...|$|R
5000|$|<b>Dik-diks</b> stand about 30 - 40 cm at the shoulder, are [...] long, weigh 3 - 6 kg and {{can live}} {{for up to}} 10 years. <b>Dik-diks</b> are named for the alarm calls of the females. In {{addition}} to the females' alarm call, both {{the male and female}} make a shrill, whistling sound. These calls may alert other animals to predators.|$|R
25|$|The antilopine bovids (dwarf antelope, {{such as the}} springbok, blackbuck, gazelles, <b>dik-diks,</b> oribi, {{and several}} similar species) have {{well-developed}} preorbital glands.|$|R
25|$|Somalia {{contains}} {{a variety of}} mammals due to its geographical and climatic diversity. Wild fauna are found throughout the territory, including the cheetah, lion, reticulated giraffe, baboon, civet, serval, elephant, bushpig, gazelle, ibex, kudu, <b>dik-dik,</b> oribi, Somali wild ass, reedbuck and zebra, shrew, rock hyrax, golden mole and antelope. It also has a large population of the dromedary camel.|$|E
25|$|The Eritrean Coastal Desert Ecoregion {{stretches}} {{along the}} southern coast of the Red Sea from Balfair Assoli in Eritrea to Ras Bir; it forms the shores of Yemen and Djibouti funnel. During every autumn, large bird migrations have been recorded in the Obock area of Djibouti. The most common species recorded are the dorcas gazelle, Soemmerring's gazelle, and Salt's <b>dik-dik.</b> This ecoregion in Djibouti's Ras Siyyan consists of rocky terrain, old coral reefs seen during low tide, and sandy beaches. Among the several offshore islands in this region are the Sept Frères islands, an archipelago of Djibouti.|$|E
25|$|Differences in {{the social}} {{structure}} and marking behavior among different species {{may lead to a}} different size and position of the preorbital glands on the animal's face. For example, Günther's <b>dik-dik</b> (Madoqua guentheri) is a monogamous species of antelope that lives in a permanent territory, the boundaries of which the animals mark several times a day by actively pressing the preorbital glands to grasses and low-lying plants and applying the secretions. In this territorial animal, the preorbital glands remain of considerable size throughout the year. The glands are located in large preorbital pits in the lacrimal bone, and are surrounded by specialized facial muscles that compress them to express the secretions more effectively. In contrast, the saiga antelope (Saiga tatarica) is a polygamous and somewhat nomadic species which does not occupy any permanent territory {{at any time during the}} year. For most of the year the preorbital glands remain small, only growing to substantial size during the rut. At that time of year, secretions ooze more or less continuously from the glands. In this nonterritorial animal, the preorbital glands are not as well-developed, lack well-developed surrounding facial muscles, and are positioned in an inconspicuous and shallow depression of the lacrimal bone.|$|E

500|$|Lions are generalist hypercarnivores {{and usually}} hunt in groups. Their prey {{consists}} mainly of mammals, particularly ungulates, with {{a preference for}} wildebeest, zebras, buffalo, gemsbok, and giraffes in Africa and chital, sambar deer, nilgai, wild boar, chinkara and chousingha in India. African lions prefer prey weighing [...] They generally avoid fully grown adult elephants, hippopotamuses and rhinoceroses, as well as very small prey like <b>dik-dik,</b> hyrax, hare and vervet monkey. However, Thomson's gazelles may be hunted and warthogs are often taken depending on availability, despite being below the preferred weight range. In most areas, {{a small number of}} species may make up around three-fourths of the lion's diet. In Serengeti National Park, wildebeest, zebras and gazelle are the majority of prey. In Kruger National Park, giraffes are the most common prey, and in Manyara Park, Cape buffaloes constitute as much as 62% of the lion's diet, due to the high number density of buffaloes. At the Okavango Delta, with its strong seasonal changes in prey, up to eight species may make up three quarters of a lion's diet. Occasionally adult hippopotamus are taken at Gorongosa National Park and calves are commonly hunted at Virunga National Park. In addition to size, the aquatic nature of hippos makes them normally unavailable as prey. [...] The lions of Savuti, Botswana, have adapted to hunting young elephants during the dry season, and a pride of 30 lions has been recorded killing individuals between the ages of four and eleven years. [...] Lions also attack domestic livestock and in India cattle contribute significantly to their diet. Unusual prey items include porcupines and small reptiles. Lions will kill other predators such as leopards, cheetahs, and hyenas, but they seldom devour them.|$|E
500|$|Water {{and carbon}} dioxide are {{metabolic}} end products of oxidation of fats, proteins, and carbohydrates. Oxidising a gram of carbohydrate produces 0.60 grams of water; a gram of protein produces 0.41 grams of water; and a gram of fat produces 1.07 grams of water, {{making it possible for}} xerocoles to live with little or no access to drinking water. The kangaroo rat for example makes use of this water of metabolism and conserves water both by having a low basal metabolic rate and by remaining underground during the heat of the day, reducing loss of water through its skin and respiratory system when at rest. Herbivorous mammals obtain moisture from the plants they eat. Species such as the addax antelope, <b>dik-dik,</b> Grant's gazelle and oryx are so efficient at doing this that they apparently never need to drink. The camel is a superb example of a mammal adapted to desert life. It minimizes its water loss by producing concentrated urine and dry dung, and is able to lose 40% of its body weight through water loss without dying of dehydration. Carnivores can obtain much of their water needs from the body fluids of their prey. Many other hot desert animals are nocturnal, seeking out shade during the day or dwelling underground in burrows. At depths of more than [...] , these remain at between [...] regardless of the external temperature. Jerboas, desert rats, kangaroo rats and other small rodents emerge from their burrows at night and so do the foxes, coyotes, jackals and snakes that prey on them. Kangaroos keep cool by increasing their respiration rate, panting, sweating and moistening the skin of their forelegs with saliva. Mammals living in cold deserts have developed greater insulation through warmer body fur and insulating layers of fat beneath the skin. The arctic weasel has a metabolic rate that is two or three times as high as would be expected for an animal of its size. Birds have avoided the problem of losing heat through their feet by not attempting to maintain them at the same temperature as the rest of their bodies, a form of adaptive insulation. The emperor penguin has dense plumage, a downy under layer, an air insulation layer next the skin and various thermoregulatory strategies to maintain its body temperature in one of the harshest environments on Earth.|$|E
2500|$|Humans are the {{greatest}} threat to <b>dik-dik,</b> which are sometimes hunted for their hides and bones, often using snares. The bones from their legs and feet are used in traditional jewelry, while their hides are fashioned into suede gloves. Parker (1990) noted that an entire <b>dik-dik</b> hide is required to produce a single glove. Nowak (1991) asserted that <b>dik-dik</b> are disliked by local hunters because they flush and warn larger game to the presence of humans. Kingdon (1982) revealed that <b>dik-dik</b> also benefit from the destruction of vegetation via human-mediated slash and burn agriculture that results in the subsequent secondary growth of shrubs that serve as a food source and place of refuge for <b>dik-dik.</b> The IUCN Redlist lists the Kirk's <b>dik-dik</b> as [...] "least concern".|$|E
50|$|Female <b>dik-diks</b> are {{somewhat}} larger than males. The males have horns, which are small (about 3 in), slanted backwards and longitudinally grooved. The {{hair on the}} crown forms an upright tuft that sometimes partially conceals the short, ribbed horns of the male. The upper body is gray-brown, while the lower parts of the body, including the legs, belly, crest, and flanks, are tan. A bare black spot below the inside corner of each eye contains a preorbital gland that produces a dark, sticky secretion. <b>Dik-diks</b> insert grass stems and twigs into the gland to scent-mark their territories.|$|R
50|$|<b>Dik-diks</b> are monogamous, and {{conflicts}} between territorial neighbors are rare. When they occur, the males from each territory dash at each other, stop short, vigorously nod {{their heads and}} turn around. They will repeat this process, increasing the distance each time until one stops. Males mark their territories with dung piles, and cover the females' dung with their own. Monogamy in <b>dik-diks</b> may be an evolutionary response to predation; surrounded by predators, it is dangerous to explore, looking for new partners. Pairs spend about 64% of their time together. Males, but not females, will attempt to obtain extra-pair mating when the opportunity arises.|$|R

2500|$|The Kirk's <b>dik-dik</b> {{pronounced}} [...] "xylophone" [...] (Madoqua kirkii) {{is a small}} antelope {{native to}} Eastern Africa and one of four species of <b>dik-dik</b> antelope. It {{is believed to have}} six subspecies and possibly a seventh existing in southwest Africa. Dik-diks are herbivores, typically of a fawn color that aids in camouflaging themselves in savannah habitats. According to MacDonald (1985), they are also capable of reaching speeds of up to 42 kilometers per hour. The lifespan of Kirk's <b>dik-dik</b> in the wild is typically 5 years, but may surpass 10 years. In captivity males have been known to live up to 16.5 years, while females have lived up to 18.4 years.|$|E
2500|$|Usually, four {{subspecies}} of Kirk's <b>dik-dik</b> are distinguished, but in {{fact they}} may represent three or more distinct species: ...|$|E
2500|$|... "Kirk's <b>dik-dik</b> are {{endemic to}} savanna areas of eastern and southwestern Africa, {{occurring}} {{primarily in the}} Somali and Southwest arid biotic zones, but encroaching into the Southern savanna biotic zone". Their distribution {{can be described as}} discontinuous and as a result they often occur in dispersed patches due to their unique habitat requirements. In Namibia, Kirk's <b>dik-dik</b> occur in isolated areas along the Fish River and do not reside in the Namib desert, though they may traverse desert thickets along sources of water. They prefer habitats with good cover but lacking tall vegetation. Ideal habitats contain a variety of browse, extensive shade, and an open understory at their eye level. (Tinley, 1969) [...] As a result, they move to different ranges when grass grows too high and obstructs their view.|$|E
50|$|<b>Dik-diks</b> are hunted {{primarily}} by leopards, caracals, lions, hyenas, wild dogs and humans. Other predators include monitor lizards, cheetahs, jackals, baboons, eagles, hawks and pythons. Dik-diks' adaptations to predation include excellent eyesight {{and the ability}} to reach speeds up to 42 km/h.|$|R
25|$|Predator Ridge {{is a large}} exhibit {{representing}} the African savanna. It {{has the ability to}} rotate different African predators (Transvaal lions, spotted hyenas, and African wild dogs), whose overlapping scents provide environmental enrichment for the animals. Other species exhibited in smaller kopje exhibits include Kirk's <b>dik-diks,</b> banded mongooses and crested porcupines.|$|R
50|$|Small antelope, such as <b>dik-diks,</b> {{tend to be}} monogamous. They live in {{a forest}} {{environment}} with patchy resources, and a male is unable to monopolize more than one female due to this sparse distribution. Larger forest species often form very small herds of two to four females and one male.|$|R
2500|$|Kirk's <b>dik-dik</b> have a {{gestation}} period of 5–6 months, and may produce {{up to two}} offspring per year. Females reach sexual maturity between 6 and 8 months of age, while this occurs for males between 8 and 9 months. <b>Dik-dik</b> produce one offspring per gestation. Most births occur between November and December and April through May, which coincides with {{the timing of the}} rainy seasons. Dik-diks differ from other ruminants in that offspring are born with their forelegs along the body, rather than extended forward. [...] "After birth, the offspring lie concealed away from their mother 2-3 weeks and survival rates for fawns are roughly around fifty percent. Once offspring reach a certain age, they also begin to participate in the bonding ritual, and will remain with the parents until another offspring is born. At this point, the parents will chase the older sibling out of their territory. The older offspring then seeks out its own territory and mate.|$|E
2500|$|The dik-dik's name {{is derived}} from its call. When they feel threatened, <b>dik-dik</b> lie low to prevent detection. If they are {{discovered}} they run in a swift zigzag like pattern until they reach refuge in a nearby thicket. During this ‘flight’ they emit trumpet-like [...] "zik-zik" [...] calls to raise an alarm or to harass predators and publicize {{the presence of a}} mated pair.|$|E

Other local wildlife include bushbuck, duikers, greater kudu, Klipspringer, African leopards, oryx and crocodiles., The spotted hyena is widespread and fairly common.|$|R
50|$|The Serengeti is {{also home}} to a {{diversity}} of grazers, including African buffalo, warthogs, Grant's gazelle, eland, waterbuck, and topi. The Serengeti can support this remarkable variety of grazers only because each species, even those that are closely related, has a different diet. For example, wildebeests prefer to consume shorter grasses, while zebras prefer taller ones. Similarly, <b>dik-diks</b> eat the lowest leaves of a tree, impalas eat the leaves that are higher up, and giraffes eat leaves that are even higher.|$|R
