5|$|Balangoda Man (Homo sapiens balangodensis) {{refers to}} hominins from Sri Lanka's late Quaternary period.

The <b>earliest</b> evidence of Balangoda Man from archaeological sequences at caves and other sites dates back to 38,000 BP, and from excavated skeletal remains to 30,000 BP, which is also the <b>earliest</b> reliably dated record of anatomically modern humans in South Asia. Cultural remains discovered alongside the skeletal fragments include geometric microliths dating to 28,500 BP, which together with some sites in Africa is the <b>earliest</b> record of such stone tools.|$|E
5|$|Cannon: The <b>earliest</b> known {{depiction}} of a cannon is a sculpture from the Dazu Rock Carvings in Sichuan dated to 1128, however the <b>earliest</b> archaeological samples and textual accounts do not appear until the 13th century. The primary extant specimens of cannon from the 13th century are the Wuwei Bronze Cannon dated to 1227, the Heilongjiang hand cannon dated to 1288, and the Xanadu Gun dated to 1298. However, only the Xanadu gun contains an inscription bearing a date of production, so it is considered the <b>earliest</b> confirmed extant cannon. The Xanadu Gun is 34.7cm in length and weighs 6.2kg. The other cannon are dated using contextual evidence.|$|E

In addition, we examined the moderating role of the voluntariness of the <b>early</b> retirement transition in the proposed model.
