25|$|I met Laughton only once, at a party. Of all {{the actors}} I have seen, <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>he</b> <b>would</b> <b>have</b> come closest to doing Nero Wolfe perfectly. A motion picture {{producer}} (I forget who) {{asked him to}} do a series of Nero Wolfe movies, and he had said he would agree to do one but would not commit himself to a series.|$|E
500|$|While announcing her {{retirement}} from rallying, Mouton stated her intention {{to start a}} family with Corsican sports journalist Claude Guarnieri. She had her daughter Jessie (Jessica) in 1987. Mouton credited her father Pierre's support as the secret for her success: [...] "He loved driving. He loved fast cars. And <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>he</b> <b>would</b> <b>have</b> loved to do what I did. He was a prisoner of war for five years and when he came back he never had the opportunity to compete. But he came to all the rallies I did. And my mother came, too." ...|$|E
500|$|The {{group were}} not sociable with reporters, and {{according}} to the book Morrison's drinking habits made him reclusive. [...] "I regret that we couldn't have controlled Morrison better... <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>he</b> <b>would</b> <b>have</b> been big if he'd been straightened out {{at the beginning of his}} career," [...] comments Phil Solomon about Morrison. [...] "He was on a downer and he was drinking. He wasn't the most bankable of artists. He had been the frontman for another of those R & B bands that had gone up the Swanee and there were three or four versions of Them touring. It was a joke. He was no gift. There weren't record companies falling over themselves to sign him up." [...] says Phil Coulter in the book.|$|E

6000|$|... "I <b>think</b> <b>he</b> <b>would</b> be {{indifferent}} to illustrations that is, <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>he</b> <b>would</b> not value illustrations above simple letterpress." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "My compassion? Lord Glenallan cannot need my compassion. If Lord Glenallan could need it, <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>he</b> <b>would</b> hardly ask it." ...|$|R
500|$|Sections of {{the media}} have often campaigned for a {{particular}} person to be appointed England manager. At various times, but particularly during the tenure of Bobby Robson, the media campaigned for the appointment of Brian Clough. Robson once told FA chairman Bert Millichip [...] "I'm having a rough time and everybody wants Brianâ€“ give the job to him. If he's successful, everybody's happy. If he fails, that's {{the end of the}} clamour for Brian Clough to be England manager." [...] Robson added, [...] "He would have ruffled a few feathers and disturbed the corridors of power but <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>he</b> <b>would</b> <b>have</b> been a good England manager. He had good judgement, knew how to design a team and was a great motivator." [...] Terry Venables was also the subject of a media campaign for dismissal during his time as manager but was then supported by the press to return to the role in 2000.|$|E
2500|$|He toured New Zealand at the season's end {{and due to}} his keeping ability, Australia did {{not send}} a reserve for Barry Jarman. Burge said [...] "Cricket had been {{so much a part}} of Dad's life that <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>he</b> <b>would</b> <b>have</b> wanted me to go." [...] He started the tour with a 105 against Canterbury and later made 81 not out against Auckland, but did not {{otherwise}} pass 50. New Zealand had Test status at the time, but the Australian Board of Control refused to ratify the matches between the two nations as such. Burge had little impact in three international matches, scoring 115 runs at 28.75 as Australia took the series 10. He ended the New Zealand tour with 310 runs at 38.75.|$|E
60|$|But <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>he</b> <b>would</b> <b>have</b> {{consented to}} accept his liberty with three hundred a year,--so great to him was the relief.|$|E
6000|$|... 'She {{has asked}} him to be her puro--her clergyman--at Saharunpore, <b>I</b> <b>think.</b> <b>He</b> <b>would</b> not do that {{on account of his}} River. She did talk.' ...|$|R
6000|$|... "No, indeed, he {{has plenty}} of sense, but <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>he</b> <b>would</b> not show it as a clergyman. <b>He</b> <b>would</b> {{be a piece of}} {{professional}} affectation." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "He {{was bound}} to do that, but <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>he</b> <b>would</b> prefer the Monk. I wonder whether you care very much about my {{accepting}} the offer." ...|$|R
60|$|If that Lion {{had been}} a Tiger, <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>he</b> <b>would</b> <b>have</b> killed the man, whether he wished to eat him or not.|$|E
6000|$|... 'If he had, <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>he</b> <b>would</b> <b>have</b> wronged me. He met {{you in my}} house, and I think {{must have}} known what my {{feelings}} were towards you.' ...|$|E
6000|$|Now, I {{never knew}} for certain how [...] "Mr. David's conscience" [...] would decide, but <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>he</b> <b>would</b> <b>have</b> {{been with me}} on this occasion, and with the Rules of the Game.|$|E
6000|$|... "That {{remains to}} be seen, Fred. I wish Colonel Colby were here. <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>he</b> <b>would</b> give us some good advice--being such {{an old friend of}} our fathers." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "But {{he should}} take warning, sir, and use {{precautions}} too," [...] interposed Mr. Sweeting; [...] "and <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>he</b> <b>would</b> if <b>he</b> heard what I heard the other day." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Well, {{he is very}} agreeable," [...] said Myra, [...] "and {{many would}} think interesting, and if Lord Roehampton does not know him, <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>he</b> <b>would</b> do very well." ...|$|R
6000|$|... 'I {{am sorry}} to record it of old Lobbs, but <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>he</b> <b>would</b> <b>have</b> struck the cousin, if his pretty daughter, with her bright eyes {{swimming}} in tears, had not clung to his arm.|$|E
6000|$|... "Elizabeth," [...] he said, [...] "I {{never really}} understood. What {{was it that}} came over him so suddenly? One day he was your slave, the next <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>he</b> <b>would</b> <b>have</b> murdered you if he could." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Upon my word, Bertram," [...] he said gazing round, [...] "if Bunyan {{had ever}} been in the Rocky Mountains, <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>he</b> <b>would</b> <b>have</b> chosen such a spot as this for the castle o' Giant Despair." ...|$|E
6000|$|... (Diary entry) The captain {{has lost}} his glasses, and {{therefore}} he [...] cannot read our pocket prayer-books as much as <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>he</b> <b>would</b> [...] like, though he is not familiar with them.|$|R
2500|$|Arrowverse {{executive}} producer Marc Guggenheim has stated, [...] "I {{would love to}} tackle [...] at some point. <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>he</b> <b>would</b> fit really well in our little universe. So we talk about him a lot." ...|$|R
50|$|<b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>he</b> <b>would</b> nuke {{them before}} breakfast. And, look, you know I don't like George Bush {{but he is}} the best {{president}} we've ever had on Israel because for some reason he gets that.|$|R
6000|$|... "Because he fancied another. And {{ever since}} that time he has been fancying others, instead of remembering me. Had he got you, Miss Rose, <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>he</b> <b>would</b> <b>have</b> been content {{for the rest of}} his days." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Nor do <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>he</b> <b>would</b> <b>have</b> been, {{save for}} his wife, Maud Pratt of Hampton," [...] said Ambrose. [...] "Nay, truly also, he deemed {{that we were}} only within a day's journey of council from our uncle Richard at Hyde." ...|$|E
60|$|It's {{always a}} nasty jar {{to wait for}} the laugh and find that the gag hasn't got across. The bearded bloke was visibly discomposed. At that, however, <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>he</b> <b>would</b> <b>have</b> got by, had he not, at this juncture, {{unfortunately}} stirred Gussie up again.|$|E
5000|$|Arrowverse {{executive}} producer Marc Guggenheim has stated, [...] "I {{would love to}} tackle Sage at some point. <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>he</b> <b>would</b> fit really well in our little universe. So we talk about him a lot." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I {{think that}} myself. If {{he could do}} it, <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>he</b> <b>would</b> hypnotize her into marrying him. He is just rascal enough. Of course he is after the money Mrs. Stanhope is holding in trust for Dora." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I don't know. <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>he</b> <b>would</b> do {{anything}} to rid us from what he {{believed to have been}} our danger. <b>I</b> don't <b>think</b> it was in George Hotspur to write such a letter out of his own head." ...|$|R
6000|$|Now, had Scott been {{pirating}} Satchells, <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>he</b> <b>would</b> <b>have</b> kept [...] "By {{the cross}} of my sword," [...] which is picturesque and probable, Willie being no good Presbyterian. In Otterburne, Scott, ALTERING HOGG'S COPY, makes Douglas swear [...] "By the might of Our Ladye." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I {{think so}} myself, sir," [...] replied the old gentleman. He looked kindly at Dave and his chums. [...] "It {{looks to me}} as if you had saved me from being swindled," [...] he continued. [...] "If he had a fair sort of a {{proposition}} <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>he</b> <b>would</b> <b>have</b> stayed." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "No, I don't think so," [...] Amuba gasped. [...] "The brute has knocked all {{the breath}} {{out of my}} body; but that's better than if he had {{hit me in the}} leg, for <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>he</b> <b>would</b> <b>have</b> broken it had he done so. How is the woman--is she dead?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... 'I {{am sorry}} to say that I differ from you; I lean to my first notion still--that Mr.--Mr. Manston is most {{desirable}} in tone and bearing, and even specifically; <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>he</b> <b>would</b> suit me best in the long-run.' ...|$|R
6000|$|... 'I fancy {{it is the}} recommendation,' said Ferdinand, smiling with {{a little}} shame; 'but if you really see reason for some other choice perhaps you would {{represent}} it to him. <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>he</b> <b>would</b> attend to you in person.' ...|$|R
6000|$|Nora paused {{again before}} she replied. [...] "As nearly as I {{know how to}} do in such words as <b>he</b> <b>would</b> put into my mouth. I shall strive to write just what <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>he</b> <b>would</b> wish me to write." ...|$|R
