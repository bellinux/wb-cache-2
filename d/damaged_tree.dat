40|$|Damage by the banana‐spotting bug, Amblypelta lutescens lutescens to papaw trees was {{assessed}} at 12 sites in North Queensland. Sites {{were chosen to}} determine if the number of <b>damaged</b> <b>trees</b> differed between plots grown adjacent to remnant rainforest or plots grown in open areas. Regression analysis was used {{to examine the relationship between}} distance from the forest edge and percent damage. To gain insight into A.

Papaw trees in sites that bordered remnant rainforest were attacked more frequently than those in open areas. The percentage of <b>trees</b> <b>damaged</b> decreased significantly with increased distance from the rainforest edge, and <b>damaged</b> <b>trees</b> were distributed non‐randomly (clumped) throughout the plot.

In 2012, Chronicle Books published Woodcut, a book which displays a selection of Gill's prints; it was named one of The New York Times Magazines best books of the year. An exhibition by the same name, composed of 30 of Gill's prints, was displayed at the Chicago Botanic Garden in early 2013. He created prints from a large variety of trees, of which the oldest was a fallen 200-year-old chestnut tree once planted by Frederick Law Olmsted.|$|E

50|$|Most {{species of}} Neriidae are slender, long-legged flies. Many exhibit striped {{patterns}} {{that appear to}} provide camouflage against tree bark. Many neriids are sexually dimorphic, with males having more elongated bodies, heads, antennae, and legs than females. In some species, the male fore-tibia is greatly thickened distally. Neriid flies are saprophagous. Larvae develop in rotting vegetable matter, including bark and fruit. Neriid adults tend to aggregate on rotting vegetable matter or <b>damaged</b> <b>tree</b> trunks. Neriid adults are also attracted to flowers or other sources of sugar. The upper face has a medial division and the antennae are porrect. The arista on the antenna arises at the tip (not dorsally, as in the Micropezidae). The fore legs are long with prominent coxae. In the Micropezidae, the fore legs are reduced. The fore femora (and sometimes all femora) bear ventral spines in males. The fore tibia of males may have rows of spines or tubercles. The third and fourth veins of the wing converge at the tip and the first vein is not setulose. Neriids have 1-5 frontal bristles, no ocellar bristles and some have reduced postvertical bristles.|$|E

40|$|The paper {{presents}} {{the result of}} the research carried out in even-aged spruce stands, regarding to the deer <b>damaged</b> <b>tree</b> distribution on the diameter classes. The main studied topics were: correlation between the frequency of the deer damages and the Charlier distribution; regression equations witch represent relation between the Charlier distribution parameters (standard deviation, asymmetry, kurtosis) and the frequency of the deer damages; structural models of the deer <b>damaged</b> <b>tree</b> distribution on the diameter classes correlated with the frequency of the deer damages; validation of the theoretical model. Using an original method, it was possible to establish a model predicting the deer <b>damaged</b> <b>tree</b> distribution on the diameter classes, based on the relationship between frequency of the deer damages and stand age in spruce forests. This research brought up some unknown aspects that can be considered as new contributions concerning scientific basis for the sustainable forest management in mountains ecosystems affected by disturbances factors. ...|$|E

40|$|Individual {{differences}} of ozone (O 3) resistance for seed production, seed germination and seedling development {{were examined in}} this study. Five in each healthy and <b>damaged</b> <b>trees</b> of Pinus thunbergii growing in air polluted area for 12 years were chosen based on visible foliar injury and growth. The cones of P. thunbergii, which were collected from healthy and <b>damaged</b> <b>trees,</b> were analyzed for physical characteristics and seeds from the cones were used to test germination percentage under O 3 treatment. The germinated seeds were continuously exposed to O 3 treatment and the lipid peroxidation and activities of antioxidative enzymes were determined for both seeds and seedlings. The O 3 treatment for seed germination and seedling development were conducted at three conditions: control, 150 ppb and 300 ppb of O 3. The non-treated seeds from the <b>damaged</b> <b>trees</b> showed 21. 6 % lower germination than those from the healthy ones. On the O 3 treatment of 300 ppb, seed germination decreased approximately 10 % for the healthy trees and 19 % for the <b>damaged</b> <b>trees</b> compared to that on the control. The seeds from the healthy trees showed significantly higher activities of superoxide dismutase (SOD), glutathione reductase (GR), and catalase (CAT) than those from the <b>damaged</b> <b>trees.</b> The activities of GR, ascorbate peroxidase (APX), and CAT decreased along with the increasing O 3 concentration in two tree grades. Malondialdehyde (MDA) content of seeds was not influenced by O 3 treatment for two tree grades.
