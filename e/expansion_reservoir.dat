The obtained {{results show that the}} sand production has a significant influence on RPP. By contrast with rock deformation, it has a smaller influence on RPP. The influence caused by the former is about 5 ~ 8 times than latter. During the period of steam injection, resulting from the movement of sand grain and <b>expansion</b> of <b>reservoir,</b> both porosity and permeability of reservoir are on the rise.

40|$|Abstract Background To address how natural disturbance, forest harvest, and {{deforestation}} from reservoir creation affect landscape-level carbon (C) budgets, {{a retrospective}} C {{budget for the}} 8500  ha Sooke Lake Watershed (SLW) from 1911 to 2012 was developed using historical spatial inventory and disturbance data. To simulate forest C dynamics, data was input into a spatially-explicit version of the Carbon Budget Model-Canadian Forest Sector (CBM-CFS 3). Transfers of terrestrial C to inland aquatic environments {{need to be considered}} to better capture the watershed scale C balance. Using dissolved organic C (DOC) and stream flow measurements from three SLW catchments, DOC load into the reservoir was derived for a 17 -year period. C stocks and stock changes between a baseline and two alternative management scenarios were compared to understand the relative impact of successive <b>reservoir</b> <b>expansions</b> and sustained harvest activity over the 100 -year period. Results Dissolved organic C flux for the three catchments ranged from 0. 017 to 0. 057  Mg C ha− 1  year− 1. Constraining CBM-CFS 3 to observed DOC loads required parameterization of humified soil C losses of 2. 5, 5. 5, and 6. 5 %. Scaled to the watershed and assuming none of the exported terrestrial DOC was respired to CO 2, we hypothesize that over 100  years up to 30, 657  Mg C may have been available for sequestration in sediment. By 2012, deforestation due to reservoir creation/expansion resulted in the watershed forest lands sequestering 14  Mg C ha− 1 less than without <b>reservoir</b> <b>expansion.</b> Sustained harvest activity had a substantially greater impact, reducing forest C stores by 93  Mg C ha− 1 by 2012. However approximately half of the C exported as merchantable wood during logging (~ 176, 000  Mg C) may remain in harvested wood products, reducing the cumulative impact of forestry activity from 93 to 71  Mg C ha− 1. Conclusions Dissolved organic C flux from temperate forest ecosystems is a small but persistent C flux which may have long term implications for C storage in inland aquatic systems. This is a first step integrating fluvial transport of C into a forest carbon model by parameterizing DOC flux from soil C pools. While deforestation related to successive <b>reservoir</b> <b>expansions</b> did impact the watershed-scale C budget, over multi-decadal time periods, sustained harvest activity was more influential...|$|R

40|$|Abstract The north-central {{region of}} Indiana in the Midwestern United States {{was covered by}} {{deciduous}} forest, but was largely cleared for agriculture during the 1800 s. The landscape has experienced tremendous change due to forest restoration, urban <b>expansion,</b> and <b>reservoir</b> construction since the early 1900 s. At the same time, ecological health and environmental qual-ity have been dramatically degraded in the region. We used simple landscape indices, such as land proportion, TE, and Shared Edge Length (SEL) between any two classes, to examine changes in the spatial patterning of six land cover types, including agriculture, grassland, closed-canopy forest, open-canopy forest, urban, and water, using aerial photographs dating from 1940 to 1998. The landscape’s domination by agriculture did not change (65 % in 1940 and 57 % in 1998), but there were net gains in area for closed-canopy forest (79 %), urban (256 %), and water (125 %). Several landscape indices did not change much but SEL between closed-canopy forest and urban increased over seven fold, and SEL between water and urban increased over eight fold from 1940 to 1998. More forestlands and water bodies were exposed to human activities. The clumped pattern of forest, water, and urban in a landscape can be ecologically detrimental and {{should be considered in}} future land-use decisions...|$|R
