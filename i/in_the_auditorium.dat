The north-most building is an auditorium. Next to it is the North Building, with the East Building sitting between the North Building and the rotunda. The main entrance to the East Building is flanked by two round silos that hold its elevators.

These buildings house the Getty Conservation Institute (GCI), the J. Paul Getty Trust and the Getty Foundation. These buildings are generally {{closed to the public}} except for special events held <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>auditorium.</b> They are linked to the Museum both by landscaped terraces and by an enclosed glass walkway that leads from the main rotunda.|$|E
