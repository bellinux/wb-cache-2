5|$|Edwin was {{defeated}} by the Welsh and died at the Battle of Hatfield Chase, on a date traditionally given as 12 October 633. One problem with the dating of the battle is that Pope Honorius <b>I</b> <b>wrote</b> <b>in</b> June 634 to Paulinus and Archbishop Honorius {{saying that he was}} sending a pallium, the symbol of an archbishop's authority, to each of them. The pope's letter shows no hint that news of Edwin's death had reached Rome, almost nine months after the supposed date of the battle. The historian D. P. Kirby argues that this lack of awareness makes it more likely that the battle occurred in 634.|$|E
25|$|<b>I</b> <b>wrote</b> <b>in</b> {{detail about}} the Holocaust and said I {{did not want to}} discuss numbers. I quoted an {{argument}} between historians in which various numbers of casualties were mentioned. One wrote there were 12million victims and another wrote there were 800,000. I have no desire to argue with the figures. The Holocaust was a terrible, unforgivable crime against the Jewish nation, a crime against humanity that cannot be accepted by humankind. The Holocaust was a terrible thing and nobody can claim I denied it.|$|E

500|$|Hunter {{reports that}} Samuel Johnson visited Smart during the latter's confinement, {{and it was}} Johnson that, [...] "on the first {{approaches}} of Mr Smart's malady, wrote several papers for a periodical publication in which that gentleman was concerned." [...] However, {{at no time did}} Smart ever believe himself to be insane; these meetings began before Smart was ever put into asylum because he still contributed, although not as significantly, to the Universal Visiter. In joking about writing for the Universal Visiter, Johnson claimed: [...] "for poor Smart, while he was mad, not then knowing the terms on which he was engaged to write... I hoped his wits would return to him. Mine returned to me, and <b>I</b> <b>wrote</b> <b>in</b> 'the Universal Visitor' no longer." ...|$|E

She added that Lawrence was the [...] "only one who truly captured the character <b>I</b> <b>wrote</b> <b>in</b> the book" [...] {{and that she had}} [...] "every essential quality necessary to play Katniss." [...] Lawrence, a fan of the books, took three days to accept the role, initially intimidated {{by the size of the}} production. Josh Hutcherson and Liam Hemsworth were later added to the cast, in the roles of Peeta and Gale, respectively. [...] Production began in late spring 2011 and the film was released on March 23, 2012.

[...] My productions were a collection of haphazard observations, put together no doubt {{against the backdrop of}} what I had read. [...] Every beginning author does the same. [...] To be sure, this kind of work was to me a great mortification. [...] Then I began asking older authors, and they told me that 'there are no rules, nor can there be any, for the art of novel-writing.' [...] Then , brought to desperation, I set about trying to resolve for myself the question: [...] 'Can literary art be reduced to general rules?' [...] After several years of observing and thinking, the matter began to get clearer for me, and as early as August 1886 I set down my first notes [...] and, God willing, I hope to publish a scientific theory of literary art. [...] I expect that it will contain some fairly new things." ...|$|E

[...] Alan Sepinwall of The Star-Ledger said that [...] "I saw [...] "Subway Hero" [...] a while back, and as <b>I</b> <b>wrote</b> <b>in</b> my column last week, my {{reaction}} to it was roughly {{the same as it was}} to [...] "MILF Island": a number of very funny individual moments, but an episode that was less than the sum of its parts." [...] David Hinckley of The New York Daily News said that there were [...] "a lot of former-boyfriend gags that are, once again, well-formulated" [...] in this episode and that [...] "They work." [...] Hinckley also wrote that [...] "the real reason [...] is must-see TV is a guest spot by Tim Conway as an old-time television star whose deadpan recollections of the [...] "good old days" [...] keep getting weirder and funnier.
