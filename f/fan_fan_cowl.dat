50|$|Triumph Airborne Structures in Hot Springs, Arkansas is an FAA/EASA {{approved}} repair facility {{specializing in}} maintenance, repair and overhaul of flight control surfaces, nacelle components, <b>fan</b> reversers and other aerostructures. The facility performs repairs on aircraft structures, {{as well as}} full overhaul support, including replacement of core and skins for both composite and metal bonded components. Components produced at this location include Inlet <b>Cowls,</b> <b>Fan</b> Reversers, Flaps, <b>Fan</b> <b>Cowls,</b> Ailerons, Slats, Elevators, Stabilizers and Spoilers.|$|R
40|$|The {{influence}} of the <b>fan</b> <b>cowl,</b> particularly the material {{of which it is}} made, on the acoustic noise emitted from PWM controlled induction machines is investigated. It is shown that there are significant harmonic excitation forces which can cause mechanical resonances of the <b>fan</b> <b>cowl.</b> The mechanical behaviour of both metal and plastic cowls is measured, using impulse force tests and random PWM excitation. The noise spectra and sound pressure level of a 1. 5 kW 3 -phase induction machine when equipped with a metal and a plastic <b>fan</b> <b>cowl</b> are investigated, and the noise spectra when the machine is supplied from sub-harmonic PWM, space vector PWM and random PWM inverter are compared. It shows that a metal <b>fan</b> <b>cowl</b> can significantly amplify the noise level, whilst the noise level with a plastic <b>fan</b> <b>cowl</b> is effectively the same as that with the cowl removed...|$|R

50|$|On the Boeing 707 the JT3D <b>fan</b> nacelle was {{relatively}} short, whereas the Douglas DC-8 installation {{had a full}} length <b>fan</b> <b>cowl.</b> Pratt & Whitney provided a kit whereby JT3Cs could be converted to the JT3D standard in an overhaul shop.|$|R
50|$|There is, however, another {{installation}} effect: freestream air scrubbing {{an exposed}} <b>fan</b> <b>cowl</b> {{and its associated}} pylon (where applicable) will create drag. Deducting this term from the streamtube net thrust yields the force applied by the engine to the airframe proper.|$|R
40|$|A tool {{to create}} {{parametric}} aerodynamic shapes using intuitive design variables based on class shape transformation (CST) curves is presented. To enable this, a {{system has been}} developed which accepts arbitrary constraints and automatically derives the analytical expressions which describe the corresponding class shape transformation curves. Parametric geometry definitions for <b>fan</b> <b>cowl</b> and intake aero-lines were developed using the generalized method. Computational fluid dynamics (CFD) analysis of the <b>fan</b> <b>cowl</b> shows that despite the simple geometry definition, its performance characteristics are close to what would be expected of a finished design. The intake geometry was generated {{in a similar way}} and met the typical performance metrics for conventional intakes. This demonstrates the usefulness of the tool to quickly and robustly produce parametric aero-lines with good aerodynamic properties, using relatively simple intuitive design variables...|$|R
40|$|The {{prediction}} {{of the location}} of the transition from laminar to turbulent boundary layer flow on a hybrid laminar flow(HLF) engine nacelle flight tested on the DLR VFW 614 /ATTAS is carried out using the e N method of the local linear stability theory. The value of the limiting N factor N LIM required for the transition prediction has been derived from an analysis of flight tests with a natural laminar flow engine nacelle previously flight tested on the same aircraft at the same flight and engine operating conditions. In contrast to the flight trials with the natural laminar flow nacelle, for the HLF nacelle flight tests there existed an additional receptivity component due to the waviness of the forebody surface of the manufactured HLF nacelle <b>fan</b> <b>cowl</b> as result of the aerodynamic surface quality not complying with the manufacturing specification. For the validation of the transition prediction, results obtained using the infrared thermography as well as the external surface temperature distribution on the HLF nacelle <b>fan</b> <b>cowl</b> have been drawn upon. It is found that the transition location prediction by the e N method underestimates the longitudinal extent of the laminar boundary layer flow on the HLF nacelle <b>fan</b> <b>cowl</b> by about the same amount by which the experimentally determined transition location differs between the infrared thermography and the surface temperature measurement results...|$|R

50|$|Since the mid-1990s, Alenia Aermacchi {{has participated}} in {{programs}} for the supply of engine nacelles for civil aircraft. It produces cold parts for engine nacelles: inlets, <b>fan</b> <b>cowls</b> and EBU, the systems-to-engine interface. In 1999, the company established a joint venture (MHD) with Hurel-Dubois (presently Hurel-Hispano, of SNECMA group), a French company specializing {{in the development and}} manufacture of thrust reversers, to obtain the full responsibility for the development of nacelles installed on maximum 100-seat aircraft.|$|R
40|$|Some {{lessons learned}} as regards flow {{transition}} detection {{in the course}} of flight-testing carbon fiber composite conventional and laminar flow nacelles are presented. The key objective of the flight trials was to examine the influences of environmental phenomena and of the engine nacelle structure regarding the interpretation of the nacelle infrared images and of the nacelle surface temperature measurements, both with reference to determining the location of the flow transition front on the nacelles. As regards the application of the infrared thermography, the study has yielded the result that the quality of the infrared images is influenced by heat radiation to space and from Earth, as well as by reflection of sunlight from the airframe. For good quality infrared images, only carbon fiber composites should be used as structural material for the nacelle <b>fan</b> <b>cowls.</b> In addition, the mechanical design of the <b>fan</b> <b>cowls</b> should not contain any stiffening frames in the substructure, but the should be designed as a uniform honeycomb skin structure. Concerning the surface temperature measurements, for good-quality results,a uniform honeycomb carbon fiber composite skin structure is just as essential as for the infrared imaging system...|$|R
5000|$|Around this time, {{the band}} changed their name to TPOK Jazz. TP stood for [...] "Tout Pouissant" [...] (all powerful). Band {{membership}} had increased to over twenty. The {{quality of their}} music had improved to where they could challenge African Jazz for the position of Congo's premier group. Franco's music appealed to ordinary people mainly because it discussed issues that affect the common man on a daily basis. Franco led other Congolese musicians in using new technology to produce sounds of much higher quality {{than in any other}} part of Africa. The new technology included electric guitars, amplifiers and basses. Congo had now assumed the premier position as Africa's leading music nation. During the late 1960s, Kwamy Munsi and Mulamba Joseph Mujos led nine other musicians in a mass defection from TPOK Jazz. A few months later, saxophonist Verckys Kiamuangana Mateta also left. Franco recruited Rondot Kassongo wa Kassongo to replace Verckys. He also brought in solo guitarist Mose <b>Fan</b> <b>Fan.</b> <b>Fan</b> <b>Fan</b> had a new style of guitar-playing called sebene, which was more danceable.
