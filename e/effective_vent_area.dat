40|$|Roof venting {{is often}} {{utilised}} in large warehouses to remove smoke {{in order to}} reduce damage to a building and its contents, and to maintain access for fire-fighters. In New Zealand, the Compliance Document for the New Zealand Building Code C clauses recommends 15 % opening area for unsprinklered single floor buildings. This opening area is required to be designed for <b>effective</b> fire <b>venting.</b> There is no justification for why 15 % is required, and no definition of how fire venting qualifies as being effective. Fire Dynamics Simulator (FDS) was used to simulate the performance of various roof venting strategies in two different-sized industrial warehouses (both larger than 1, 500 m²) with a 50 MW fire with both a rapid and an extreme t³ growth rate. In particular, roof <b>venting</b> <b>areas</b> of 15 %, 10 %, and 5 % of the floor area were tested with each of the following inlet areas for make-up air: 100 %, 50 %, and 0 % of roof <b>venting</b> <b>area.</b> In each of these cases, the vents were treated as permanently-open holes in the roof. It was shown that roof venting with 15 % geometric area is ample to provide and maintain tenability for fire-fighters. With sufficient inlet area for make-up air, smaller <b>venting</b> <b>areas</b> could also be employed. Further simulations were run to test the effect of square-shaped vents that opened simultaneously at 100 °C compared with square-shaped vents that opened sequentially at 100 °C, 200 °C, and 300 °C, and strip-shaped vents that opened progressively as each portion of a vent reached activation temperatures of 200 °C and 300 °C. Vents that opened at 100 °C were intended to represent mechanical vents, while vents opening at higher temperatures were intended to represent plastic sky-light or drop-out type vents. The activation temperature proved to be more influential than the opening sequence or shape: there was a significant advantage to be gained by having vents that activated at 100 °C as opposed to 200 °C or 300 °C. The role of downstands in aiding the effectiveness of roof venting was also investigated, with downstand depths of 10 %, 20 %, and 30 % of the ceiling height being simulated. Downstands were shown to be incredibly useful for exhausting smoke and hot gases, provided their installation was appropriately coordinated with placement of roof venting. It is concluded that a clear definition of <b>effective</b> fire <b>venting</b> must not only include the <b>area</b> of roof <b>venting,</b> but equally important is the definition of required inlet area for make-up air, as it plays {{a crucial role in the}} effectiveness of the specified roof <b>venting</b> <b>area.</b> In addition, the clear aerodynamic area should be specified. This could be achieved by use of a discharge coefficient that describes the proportion of the roof <b>venting</b> <b>area</b> that is clear aerodynamic area for a particular material, <b>vent,</b> and geometric <b>area.</b> Development of a clear definition of <b>effective</b> fire <b>venting</b> will help to determine how an economic fire protection system can be continued to be used, while going a long way to ensuring predictable and tenable conditions for fire-fighters in New Zealand...|$|R
40|$|The {{levels of}} {{contamination}} that originate {{from inside the}} IUS equipment support section (ESS) due to outgassing from electronics components and wiring operating at elevated temperatures (80 - 160 F) were investigated. Pressure was measured {{inside and outside the}} ESS. Mass deposition measurements were made with quartz crystal microbalances (QCM) facing into and away from ESS vents. The OCM's were operated at - 50 C and - 180 C using thermoelectrically and cryogenically cooled QCM's. Gaseous nitrogen flow inside the ESS was used to obtain the <b>effective</b> molecular flow <b>vent</b> <b>area</b> of the ESS, which was evaluated to be 359 sq cm (56 sq in) compared to the 978 sq cm (150 sq in) estimated by an earlier atmosphere pressure billowing test. The total outgassing rate of the ESS materials at a temperature of 60 C (140 F) decays with a time constant of 11. 5 hours based on pressure measurements during the hot cycle. A time constant of 22 hours was estimated for the fraction of the outgassing which will condense on a - 50 C surface. In contrast, the time constant is only 10. 1 hours for the outgassing material which condenses on a surface at - 180 C. A surface at - 180 C collects approximately one half of the material vented from the ESS which impinges on it. Pressure measurements show very good correlation with the mass deposition measurements...|$|R

40|$|International audienceA Round Robin {{test was}} set up to obtain a cross {{comparison}} of participant's methods regarding a typical pressure relief device (bursting disc) sizing problem. The problem in question was a 'gassy' runaway reaction system: decomposition of 40 % w/w dicumyl peroxide in 2, 2, 4 -trimethyl- 1, 3 - pentanediol diisobutyrate. The objective of the Round Robin exercise was to highlight the disparities in the participant's approaches and identify barriers and research needs. Two broad methods were used: one was the implementation of the DIERS method; the other was to follow a similarity or scale-up approach. The scale-up approach consists experimentally determining a minimum safe <b>vent</b> <b>area</b> and scaling up maintaining the vent area/volume ratio. This approach is similar to the one adopted by the UN committee on the Transport of Dangerous Goods for vent sizing of peroxide tankers using a 10 litre vessel. Very different results in terms of <b>vent</b> <b>area</b> were obtained from the seven participants. Analysis of the vent sizing calculations based on calorimetric data showed that the experimental conditions and their interpretation can significantly influence the estimated gas production rate and therefore the final <b>vent</b> <b>area.</b> However, the calculation of the vented mass flux stays largely responsible for the differences in calculated <b>vent</b> <b>area.</b> The critical factor lies in the assumption of single-phase (gas only) venting or two-phase (liquid and gas) venting. The reasons for assuming single-phase venting, which gives a lower <b>vent</b> <b>area,</b> are unclear and may not be justified. The comparison showed that the calorimetric and the similarity approaches diverged significantly when two-phase only venting was assumed. The Round Robin test highlighted the need for more experimental and modelling work towards predicting the nature of the vented fluid at large scale, and in the use of adiabatic calorimetry to determine the maximum gas production rate. Large-scale tests would allow the comparison, the validation and the improvement of the calorimetric and similarity approaches...|$|R
40|$|In {{order to}} protect {{chemical}} reactors from runaway reactions, vent sizing methods, based on data obtained from adiabatic calorimetry and two-phase flow models, were built {{under the guidance of}} the DIERS (Design Institute for Emergency System Relief). Nevertheless, because of the simplifying assumptions used (mainly conservation of initial reactive mass and homogeneous vessel venting), DIERS methods often lead to unrealistically large <b>vent</b> <b>areas.</b> This is especially the case of non tempered systems (gas-generating and hybrid systems, peroxide decomposition for example). The United Nation Manual of Test and Criteria (UN) also proposes an experimental method to determine the minimum required <b>vent</b> <b>area</b> using a 10 dm vessel test. The <b>vent</b> <b>area</b> is scaled up on vessel volume. Prior mass loss and two phase flow being experimentally taken into account, this method provides a more realistic vent size. This type of area to volume scale up can be conservative in the case of non tempered systems because the mass loss at small scale is more important. Nevertheless, {{due to the fact that}} the sample size is large, the UN method has the disadvantage of being time consuming, laborious and requires heavy safety precautions...|$|R

40|$|In this work, {{a series}} of vented explosions in a typical {{compressor}} compartment are simulated using FLACS code to analyze the explosion venting characteristics. The effects of relevant parameters on the pressure peaks (i. e., overpressure and negative pressure) are also numerically investigated, including <b>vent</b> <b>area</b> ratio of the compressor compartment, vent activation pressure, mass per unit <b>area</b> of <b>vent</b> panels, and volume blockage ratio of obstacles. In addition, the orthogonal experiment design and improved grey relational analysis are implemented to evaluate the impact degree of these relevant parameters.

There is an approximately linearly increasing relationship between the pressure peaks and the vent activation pressure. The pressure peaks increase with the mass per unit <b>area</b> of <b>vent</b> panels. The pressure peaks increase with the volume blockage ratio of obstacles. Based on the grey relational grade values, the effects of these relevant parameters on the overpressure peak are ranked as follows: volume blockage ratio of obstacles > vent activation pressure > <b>vent</b> <b>area</b> ratio > mass per unit <b>area</b> of <b>vent</b> panels.

40|$|The {{influence}} of <b>venting</b> <b>areas</b> built from {{glass on the}} peak pressure and impulse of explosions due to high explosives is investigated. The pressure-time function of an air blast wave resulting from a high explosive {{is different from that}} of a gas or dust explosion. Its peak pressure is higher but the duration of the positive phase is much shorter. Its capacity of making a structure fly away is therefore reduced. Apart from the pressure-time function, it is shown that also the direction of the wave has an influence. Starting from a certain distance to the explosion, calculations indicate that the air blast wave inside a tubular structure becomes one-dimensional. In such a case, the {{influence of}} <b>venting</b> <b>areas</b> parallel to the wave propagation direction is small. This is shown in the study by several calculations using fluid-structure interaction.

40|$|AbstractThis paper {{describes}} a combined experimental, analytical and numerical modelling investigation into hydrogen jet fires in a passively ventilated enclosure. The work {{was funded by}} the EU Fuel Cells and Hydrogen Joint Undertaking project Hyindoor. It is relevant to situations where hydrogen is stored or used indoors. In such situations passive ventilation can be used to prevent the formation of a flammable atmosphere following a release of hydrogen. Whilst a significant amount of work has been reported on unignited releases in passively ventilated enclosures and on outdoor hydrogen jet fires, very {{little is known about the}} behaviour of hydrogen jet fires in passively ventilated enclosures. This paper considers the effects of passive ventilation openings on the behaviour of hydrogen jet fires. A series of hydrogen jet fire experiments were carried out using a 31  m 3 passively ventilated enclosure. The test programme included subsonic and chocked flow releases with varying hydrogen release rates and vent configurations. In most of the tests the hydrogen release rate was sufficiently low and the <b>vent</b> <b>area</b> sufficiently large to lead to a well-ventilated jet fire. In a limited number of tests the <b>vent</b> <b>area</b> was reduced, allowing under-ventilated conditions to be investigated. The behaviour of a jet fire in a passively ventilated enclosure depends on the hydrogen release rate, the <b>vent</b> <b>area</b> and the thermal properties of the enclosure. An analytical model was used to quantify the relative importance of the hydrogen release rate and <b>vent</b> <b>area,</b> whilst the influence of the thermal properties of the enclosure were investigated using a CFD model. Overall, the results indicate that passive ventilation openings that are sufficiently large to safely ventilate an unignited release will tend to be large enough to prevent a jet fire from becoming under-ventilated...|$|R

30|$|On {{the surface}} of a GNSS {{instrument}} (REGMOS) installed by the Geospatial Information Authority of Japan (Fig.  2), ash fall tracks were recorded as grime formed by droplets of mud or mud rain (Fig.  10 b).

Since the fall velocity of a droplet of this size is estimated to be approximately 7  m/s (Beard 1977) and the angle between the ash fall tracks and the vertical line was approximately 60 °, the wind velocity is estimated to have been 12  m/s (=[*] 7 [*]×[*]tan 60 °).

40|$|Forced {{convection}} {{cooling process}} is {{the most widely used}} method of cooling to extend shelf life of horticultural produce after harvest. However, heterogeneous cooling of produce inside different parts of ventilated packages is a serious problem. Therefore, it is essential to design packages that facilitate air circulation throughout the entire package to provide uniform cooling. Selection of appropriate combinations of air temperature and velocity for a given vent design is currently done largely by experimental trial and error approach. A more logical approach in designing new packages, to provide uniform cooling, is to develop mathematical models that would be able to predict package performance without requiring costly experiments. In this study, mathematical models of simultaneous airflow, heat and mass transfer during forced convection cooling process were developed and validated with experimental data. The study showed that produce cooling is strongly influenced by different ventilated package designs. Generally, cooling uniformity was increased by increasing number of vents from 1 (2. 4 % <b>vent</b> <b>area)</b> to 5 (12. 1 % <b>vent</b> <b>area).</b> More uniform produce cooling was obtained at less cooling time when vents were uniformly distributed on package walls with at least 4. 8 % opening areas. Aerodynamic studies showed that heterogeneity of airflow distribution during the process is strongly influenced by different package vent configurations. The highest cooling heterogeneity index (108 %) was recorded at 2. 4 % <b>vent</b> <b>area</b> whereas lowest heterogeneity index (0 %) was detected in a package with 12. 1 % <b>vent</b> <b>area.</b> The magnitudes of produce evaporative cooling (EC) and heat generation by respiration (HG) as well as the interactive effects of EC, HG and package vent design on produce cooling time were also investigated. Considerable differences in cooling times were obtained with regard to independent and simultaneous effects of EC and HG in different package vent configurations. Cooling time was increased to about 47 % in a package with 1 vent compared to packages with 3 and 5 vents considering simultaneous effects of EC and HG. Therefore, the effects of EC and HG can be influential in designing the forced-air precooling system and consequently, in the accurate determination of cooling time and the corresponding refrigeration load...|$|R

40|$|AbstractThe {{effects of}} a gas {{explosion}} in enclosures like vessels can be limited e. g. by gas explosion venting systems. The major design step of this constructive explosion protection method {{is to determine the}} required <b>vent</b> <b>area,</b> which depends significantly on whether turbulent combustion exists. However, current standards like NFPA 68 or EN 14994 are applicable only to limited boundary conditions and as far as possible only to laminar flame propagation. Difficulties arise in the assessment or predictability of gas explosion hazard when turbulence occurs. In this research especially venting at elevated initial pressure has been shown to accelerated flame propagations and therefore, to a considerably higher reduced pressure. Therefore, it is essential to provide a broader data base of turbulent combustion and explosion behavior to verify the existing rules or to determine their safety-relevant parameters. For a better safety assessment or design of protective systems the turbulent combustion and accelerated gas explosion behaviour of quiescent methane and hydrogen in air were investigated at initial pressures up to 8 bar using vessels up to 100 litres. In particular a systematic study was performed to investigate the influence of turbulence on the overpressure development during accelerated gas explosion. Moreover, the present study consider the position of the spark igniters, the burning velocity and the maximum pressure rise for different concentration of fuel as well as the size of orifice and/or <b>vent</b> <b>area.</b> A choice of experimental tests showed under the investigated conditions that not only turbulence inducing obstacles but also over sized <b>vent</b> <b>areas</b> could lead to an increased pressure development and therefore to an inacceptable safety state...|$|R

40|$|ABSTRACT: A {{mathematical}} {{model has been}} developed to investigate {{the effect of a}} sprinkler spray on adjacent horizontal smoke venting and in particular the water droplet drag component. The pressure difference across a roof vent and the volumetric flow of smoke vented are determined by considering the interaction between the drag force of the sprinkler spray and the buoyancy of the smoke layer in the spray region. Smoke venting may become progressively more inefficient as the sprinkler operating pressure increases due to the cooling and drag effect of the sprinkler spray.
