5|$|In the A-not-B task, {{children}} are shown an object <b>hidden</b> at Location A within their reach, and are then prompted {{to search for}} the object at Location A, where they find it. This activity is repeated several times, with the <b>hidden</b> object at Location A. Then, in the critical trial, the object is <b>hidden</b> in Location B, a second location within easy reach of child. Typically, children younger than one year old search for the object under Location A, where the object was previously <b>hidden.</b> However, after their first birthday, {{children are}} capable of mentally switching to locate the object in Location B, demonstrating flexibility. Researchers have agreed that the A-not-B task is a simple task that effectively measures cognitive flexibility during infancy.|$|E

30|$|Recently, Turkmen et al. (2017) have {{proposed}} a policy analysis framework for XACML policies based on SMT. The framework supports the verification of a large range of properties including the robustness of XACML policies against two types of attribute <b>hiding</b> attacks, namely partial attribute <b>hiding</b> and general attribute <b>hiding.</b> Partial attribute <b>hiding</b> analyzes the case where a user <b>hides</b> a single attribute name-value pair, whereas general attribute <b>hiding</b> extends partial attribute <b>hiding</b> by assuming that a user completely suppresses information about one attribute. However, this work only allows verifying whether a policy is vulnerable to attribute <b>hiding</b> attacks. In contrast, the notion of attribute value power introduced in this work also provides a means {{to assess the impact}} of missing information on policy evaluation and thus to quantify the risks of attribute <b>hiding</b> attacks.|$|R

40|$|This paper designs a novel <b>hiding</b> {{strategy}} {{based on}} an equivalence relation, which can remarkably {{enhance the quality of}} stego image without sacrificing the security and capacity of original steganography schemes.

Following that, the <b>hiding</b> procedure is performed in predefined order in equivalence classes as the traditional steganography scheme. Because of considering the relation between the length of message and capacity, the performance of the <b>hiding</b> method using proposed <b>hiding</b> strategy outperforms the original approaches when embedding the same length message. Experimental results indicate that the gain from the proposed strategy over existing <b>hiding</b> schemes can reach up to 4. 0 dB.
