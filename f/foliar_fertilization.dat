The distal half of Fe-deficient, chlorotic leaves was treated with Fe sulfate by dipping and using a brush in peach trees and sugar beet plants, respectively. The re-greening of the distal (Fe-treated) and basal (untreated) leaf areas was monitored, and the nutrient and photosynthetic pigment composition of the two areas were also determined. Leaves were also studied using chlorophyll fluorescence imaging, low temperature-scanning electron microscopy microanalysis, scanning transmission ion microscopy-particle induced X-ray emission and Perls Fe staining. The distal, Fe-treated leaf parts of both species showed a significant increase in Fe concentrations (across the whole leaf volume) and marked re-greening, with significant increases in the concentrations of all photosynthetic pigments, as well as decreases in de-epoxidation of xanthophyll cycle carotenoids and increases in photochemical efficiency.

Much past ecological work has focused either on temperate nitrogen-limited systems or has addressed infertile soils {{as a single}} entity, rather than addressing {{the nature of the}} limitation. Although low nitrogen (N) and phosphorus (P) soils are found worldwide, the consequences of N and P limitation for plants may vary due to fundamental differences in the soil mobility, availability, uptake, and cellular uses of N and P. Using a well-studied chronosequence in the Hawaiian Islands, which contains both low N and P soils but which is dominated by similar plant communities, foliar N and P plant responses to fertilization were examined across a diverse group of species and life forms. Here it is shown that in response to N <b>fertilization,</b> <b>foliar</b> N concentrations do not significantly increase. In contrast, P fertilization leads to highly elevated foliar P concentrations and lower N:P values.

Results indicate that greater variation in foliar P than <b>foliar</b> N after <b>fertilization</b> transcends soil nutrient availability and may be widespread among ecosystems. Such P accumulation means that N and P concentrations may not be in close association after pulses of soil P. It also provides a mechanism whereby ecosystem P limitation may be overcome with external inputs more easily than N limitation and points for the need to think about N and P limitation not just as infertile stressful conditions for plants, but as two fundamentally different phenomena...|$|R
40|$|A {{study was}} {{initiated}} {{in the spring}} of 2003 to evaluate the response of lemons to soil and foliar applied micronutrients for two growing season (2003 - 2005). Soil applied Fe, Zn, Mn, and Cu was applied in sulfate form and B as Solubor in shallow holes around the skirt of each tree. Foliar applied micronutrients were all applied as “Metalosate” products. Lemon leaf tissue analyses show marginal levels of Zn, Mn, and Cu throughout the study. In 2003 - 2004, soil fertilization sometimes increased leaf nutrient composition but there was no effect to <b>foliar</b> <b>fertilization.</b> In 2004 - 2005,,leaf B and Zn increased to soil fertilization and leaf Mn and Cu increased to <b>foliar</b> <b>fertilization</b> Overall, {{there were no significant differences}} in yield or quality to micronutrient fertilization in either growing season...|$|E

As a consequence, at the Research Institute for Fruit Growing Pitesti some studies were done between 2008 - 2009. The following experimental scheme was organized. A Factor – The species involved, with the graduations: a 1 = chokeberry; a 2 = hip rose (Rosa canina); a 3 = thornless blackberry; a 4 = honeysuckle; B Factors – biostimulators for rooting with the graduations: b 1 = without biostimulators (control); b 2 = Radistim (powder); b 3 = indole acetic acid. C factors – <b>foliar</b> <b>fertilization,</b> with the graduations: c 1 = unfertilized; c 2 = fertilized with Folimax 2 %; c 3 = fertilized with Plantfert (14 - 5 - 4) 2 %. For of rooting the softwood cuttings a substratum consisting in 60 % pest, 20 % manure and 20 % sand was employed. This rooting substratum of 8 - 10 cm thick was placed in plastic boxes put on high beds in a solarium where artificial mist may be intermittently applied. On average, for the graduations of B, C experimental factors, significant differences between the 4 species with regard to the values of the 4 growth characteristics were noticed. In case of control treatment (without biostimulators) versus the 2 <b>foliar</b> <b>fertilization</b> treatments, the mean shoot length was significantly higher by 14 - 17 % for all 4 species and 3 <b>foliar</b> <b>fertilization</b> levels. On average for all 4 species and 3 rooting biostimulator treatments, the mean length of shoots was significantly higher by 10 % in the unfertilized treatment versus the 2 foliar fertilized treatments.

40|$|Abstract: The {{objective}} {{of this study was}} to evaluate the effect of nitrogen fertilization and fungicide application on yield, grain protein concentration and kernel plumpness on malting barley. Eleven experiments were replicated in Buenos Aires province, Argentina, during years 2012 and 2013. Treatments were: 1. Control; 2. 80 kg N ha- 1 applied at tillering; 3. treatment 2 plus a foliar application of 20 kg N ha- 1 at Z 38; 4. treatment 3 plus a foliar application of fungicide at Z 38; and 5. treatment 4 plus a foliar application of fungicide at second detectable node. Nitrogen applied at tillering increased yields at the sites where soil N availability was below 100 kg N ha- 1, increased grain protein and decreased kernel plumpness on sites where kernel plumpness in the control plots was < 75 %. An extra <b>foliar</b> N <b>fertilization</b> did not affect yield or kernel plumpness, but increased grain protein concentration significantly 0. 82 percentage points in 45 % of the studied site-years. Fungicide application at Z 38 increased yield and kernel plumpness in 2012, when high moisture conditions promoted fungal diseases. An extra fungicide application at second node stage had no consistent effect on the studied variablesFil: Daverede, Inés. Universidad Católica Argentina. Facultad de Ciencias Agrarias; Argentina.

This experiment aimed {{to evaluate the}} effects of two times (March 3 2008 and at anthesis) and four doses of foliar application of B (equivalent to 0, 2, 4 and 6 kg ha- 1) in Mombaça grass (Panicum maximum Jacq. cv. Mombaça) on components of seed yield and quality, seed yield, and relationships among yield-components. The experimental design was a randomized block design in a factorial design (2 x 4), with four replications. The experiment was conducted in the field. The times and doses of B application {{had no effect on}} the mass of tillers vegetative and tillers with panicle, and numbers of vegetative tillers, tillers with panicle and total tillers. The interaction was significant in March 3, for the number of seeds apparent and pure, panicle- 1 and area- 1, apparent seed yield, pure seed yield, harvest index, germinable seed yield, and for a one thousand seeds pure. The times and doses of B did not affect the physical purity and seed germination. A high correlation was obtained between the number of apparent and pure seeds per area and harvest index, with apparent seed yield and with pure seed yield. Levels of <b>foliar</b> B <b>fertilization</b> of 4. 0 kg ha- 1 can be recommended to be applied in seed crops of Mombaça grass. ...|$|R
40|$|The {{objective}} {{of this study was}} to assess the changes in leaflet zinc (Zn), leaf nutritional state, vegetative and physiological parameters, and yield quality in pecan trees sprayed with different Zn compounds. Eight-year-old ‘Western Schley’ pecan trees grafted to native seedlings were treated with ZnNO 3 (100 mg·L− 1 Zn), Zn-EDTA (50, 100, and 150 mg·L− 1 Zn), and Zn-DTPA (100 mg·L− 1 Zn) and compared with the Zn-untreated control. After 3 years of evaluation, the trees with the best appearance were those treated with ZnNO 3 (100 mg·L− 1 Zn) and Zn-DTPA (100 mg·L− 1 Zn), which showed leaf Zn concentration increases of 73 % and 69 %, respectively, when compared with the controls. The chlorophyll values of the Zn-treated trees reached 46 SPAD units, equivalent to 43 mg·kg− 1 dry weight (DW) of chlorophyll compared with values of 22 mg·kg− 1 DW in Zn-deficient leaves. On a leaf area basis, chlorophyll value was 37 % lower under Zn deficiency conditions than that of Zn-treated trees. Nut quality was unaffected by the Zn treatments. Data suggest that Zn-DTPA and Zn-NO 3 are good options to carry out <b>foliar</b> Zn <b>fertilization</b> in pecan trees.
