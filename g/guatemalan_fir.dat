50|$|Abies guatemalensis or the <b>Guatemalan</b> <b>fir</b> is an {{evergreen}} tree {{native to}} Central America {{and is the}} southernmost member of the genus Abies being spread to the south almost up till 14° N. It's range is from southern (less from western and central) Mexico in the north to Honduras andEl Salvador in the south. It is a warm- and moisture-loving tree of the tropical mountain coniferous and mixed cloud forests of these countries. <b>Guatemalan</b> <b>fir</b> is almost completely non-frost-resistant tree. Due to logging and loss of habitat, the tree is considered threatened and is protected in CITES Appendix I.|$|E
5000|$|The volcano forms {{part of the}} Sierra Madre, hosting an {{abundance}} of endemic species such as the endangered <b>Guatemalan</b> <b>Fir</b> or [...] "Pinabete" [...] (Abies guatemalensis) and forming {{an integral part of}} one of the largest contiguous biological corridors of southwestern Guatemala. Bird species include the pink-headed warbler, black-capped siskin, highland guan, rufous-collared robin, white-breasted hawk, and rufous-browed wren.|$|E
50|$|The {{department}} is widely recognized in Central America for its extensive highland oak-pine forests with also fir and cypress stands, these hold {{some of the}} largest stands of the threatened <b>Guatemalan</b> <b>fir,</b> Abies guatemalensis, known locally as the pinabete. The forests cover extensive portions of the Sierra Madre, especially in the municipios of San Francisco el Alto and Totonicapán, and are held in a variety of communal arrangements, including village, clan (parcialidad) and municipio-wide ownership.|$|E
40|$|This paper first {{provides}} a general survey of Guatemala, investigating historical, economic, {{social and political}} trends within the country. Then, the paper analyzes the management of pinabete, an endangered <b>Guatemalan</b> <b>fir</b> (Abies guatemalensis). The cultivation of this species is being promoted by the environmental agencies of Guatemala in effort to alleviate pressure upon the few remaining natural forested stands. This species is highly sought after {{for use as a}} Christmas tree during the holiday season. A financial analysis is conducted in the final section of this paper that investigates three different cultivation systems for this threatened species. The financial analysis of these three cultivation systems indicates that the commercialization of this species can be considered a financially efficient cropping alternative for farmers of the Guatemalan Highlands. Moreover, the incorporation of pinabete into a farmer’s cultivation system assists in the conservation of this species, promotes soil conservation and enables farmers to diversify their revenue sources. The combination of income generation, inclusion of marginalized people, and natural resource conservation is key to the sustainable development of the Guatemalan Highlands...|$|E
