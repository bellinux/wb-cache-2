5|$|He {{spent the}} 1964–65 season {{playing for the}} reserve side. On 1 January 1965 he became the only footballer to ever be knighted (for {{services}} to football) whilst still an active professional player; though <b>he</b> <b>never</b> <b>thought</b> himself worthy of such an honour. His only first team appearance of the season was also the last Football League game of his career; it came on 6 February 1965, just after his 50th birthday, and was necessitated by injuries to both Peter Dobing and Gerry Bridgwood. The opponents that day were Fulham, and Stoke won the game 3–1. Though {{he felt he had}} retired too early, and could have carried on playing for another two years, this brought an end to his 35-year professional career.|$|E

In his memoir, The Avengers and Me, Patrick Macnee interviewed Newman about this. Newman explained that he never sought on-screen credit on the series because during his previous tenure at the Canadian Broadcasting Corporation, such credits were not given, and <b>he</b> <b>never</b> <b>thought</b> to get one for The Avengers.|$|E

However, Gödel had already discovered this consequence, now known as his second incompleteness theorem, and he sent von Neumann a preprint of his article containing both incompleteness theorems. Von Neumann acknowledged Gödel's priority in his next letter. <b>He</b> <b>never</b> <b>thought</b> much of [...] "the American system of claiming personal priority for everything." ...|$|E

After {{recording}} Taking Back Sunday's self-titled EP, Longo left the band and eventually played with Guilt Like Gravity and the Mirror. In December 2000, Lazzara switched from bass to lead vocals. <b>He</b> <b>never</b> <b>thought</b> he would become the group's singer: [...] "I remember getting into [...] Windstar with that [...] and just driving around singing those songs, just to make myself actually do it." [...] O'Connell suggested that the group needed a bassist, and brought in Shaun Cooper of Breaking Pangaea. In February 2001, Taking Back Sunday released a five-track demo before touring for a year.|$|E
500|$|Throughout his cross-examination, {{prosecutor}} Hausner {{attempted to}} get Eichmann {{to admit he}} was personally guilty, but no such confession was forthcoming. Eichmann admitted to not liking the Jews and viewing them as adversaries, but stated that <b>he</b> <b>never</b> <b>thought</b> their annihilation was justified. When Hausner produced evidence that Eichmann had stated in 1945 that [...] "I will leap into my grave laughing because the feeling that I have five million human beings on my conscience is for me a source of extraordinary satisfaction", Eichmann said he meant [...] "enemies of the Reich" [...] such as the Soviets. During later examination by the judges, he admitted he meant the Jews, and said the remark was an accurate reflection of his opinion at the time.|$|E

Lyrically, Papa vs Pretty songs {{have been described}} as often dealing with themes of disenfranchisement, lost love, human emotions, technology, and the state of the world, however Rawle, whilst accepting these as legitimate interpretations of his lyrics, says <b>he's</b> <b>never</b> <b>thought</b> that much about what he writes.|$|R
500|$|A {{successful}} summer {{followed for}} the Argentine. In July, del Potro {{and his team}} decided to remain in Europe to test his fitness. [...] "We decided to play on clay courts for my back because if I start to play again on hard courts, maybe I will injure it again", he recalled. Del Potro won his first career ATP tour title at the Mercedes Cup in Stuttgart, defeating Gasquet in straight sets in the final. A week later, del Potro reached his second career ATP Tour final at the Austrian Open in Kitzbühel, where he beat local hope and sixth seed Melzer {{in less than an}} hour, to claim his second title in two weeks.

Gaston, too in love with Gigi to give her this appalling life of uncertainty and judgment, leaves without a word after dragging her home crying.

2500|$|In 1983 the {{historian}} René de La Croix de Castries summarized {{the career of}} Thiers this way: [...] "Thiers was essentially an ambitious man and an egoist. <b>He</b> <b>never</b> <b>thought</b> of anything except his own career, and he imagined reaching the highest level. He wanted {{to be at the}} top, which from the very beginning led him naturally desire one day to be head of state; a dream {{that for a long time}} was not practical, because there was a monarchy or an empire. When he did have a chance to try in 1848, he thought it was more judicious to support Louis-Napoleon. It was thus an extraordinary circumstance that he could actually achieve his dream in 1871, at the age of seventy-four, an age which considerably passed the average life expectancy of that time....The work of Thiers did not include a single social law. On this point, he was truly a bourgeois of the 19th century, insensible to the miseries of the working class and not hesitant to open fire on the masses when the public order was threatened. To him belongs the glory of having brought an end the German occupation, and to have given to a humiliated France the desire to live again. But if he earned admiration, he did not inspire much sympathy. Thiers was nothing less than the summary of French politics in the 19th century." ...|$|E
2500|$|In this situation, {{several groups}} {{belonging}} to four different circles (the royal court, the antifascist parties, the fascism {{and the general}} Staff) started {{to look for a}} way out. Aristocrats such as Crown Princess Maria José, members of the upper classes and politicians belonging to the pre-Fascist elites, independently started plots aiming at establishing contacts with the Allies. Unfortunately, none of them understood that the war had become ideological with the declaration of Casablanca stating that the Allies would only accept unconditional surrender. [...] Moreover, despite the Crown Princess' involvement, the Anglo-Americans expected a move from higher-placed personalities, like the King, and disregarded contacts with these groups. The antifascist parties, weakened by 20 years of dictatorship, were still in an embryonic state. Moreover, all except the communists and the republicans of the Partito d’Azione waited for a signal from Victor Emmanuel, but in vain: the King's character, realist and skeptical at the same time, his fears, his constitutional scruples, {{and the fact that the}} monarchy was almost certainly finished regardless of how the war turned out contributed to his inaction. The King had considerable contempt towards the old pre-Fascist politicians, whom he ironically called [...] "revenants" [...] ("ghosts" [...] in French) and didn't entirely trust those who claimed that the Anglo-Americans would not seek to exact revenge upon Italy. Last but not least, Victor Emmanuel retained his trust in Mussolini, and he hoped that the Duce could save the situation once again. Consequently, the King kept his own counsel and isolated himself from all those who tried to learn his intentions. Among them was the new Chief of the General Staff, General Vittorio Ambrosio, a Piemontese, [...] "not of high intelligence", but devoted to the King and hostile to the Germans. Ambrosio was persuaded that the war was lost for Italy, but <b>he</b> <b>never</b> <b>thought</b> to take a personal initiative to change the situation without first consulting with Victor Emmanuel. On the other side Ambrosio, helped by his right-hand man, Giuseppe Castellano, and by Giacomo Carboni (both of whom would play key roles in the happenings which would lead to the armistice of 8 September 1943), slowly proceeded to occupy several key positions in the armed forces with officials devoted to the king. Moreover, he tried to bring back to Italy as many forces as possible among those which were abroad, but it was difficult to do that without raising the suspicions of the Germans.|$|E
