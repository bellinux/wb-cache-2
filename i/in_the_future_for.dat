5|$|A patient's genome {{may include}} an {{inherited}} or random mutation which affects {{the probability of}} developing a disease <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>future.</b> <b>For</b> example, Lynch syndrome is a genetic disease that predisposes patients to colorectal and other cancers; early detection can lead to close monitoring that improves the patient's chances of a good outcome. Cardiovascular risk is indicated by biological markers and screening can measure the risk that a child will be born with a genetic disease such as Cystic fibrosis. Genetic testing is ethically complex: patients may not want the stress of knowing their risk. In countries without universal healthcare, a known risk may raise insurance premiums.|$|E

25|$|Methods {{that test}} {{prospective}} memory require {{the distinction between}} retrospective memory, which is remembering information, and prospective memory, which is remembering information for the future. Prospective memory requires retrospective memory because one must remember the information itself in order to act <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>future.</b> <b>For</b> example, remembering to buy groceries after work (prospective memory) requires the ability to remember what type of groceries are needed (retrospective memory). While prospective memory and retrospective memory are connected, they are distinguishable. This {{makes it possible to}} separate these two processes during tests.|$|E
25|$|Equine sarcoid, a {{naturally}} occurring skin tumour affecting horses, donkeys and mules, {{is associated with}} strains of BPV-1/2 which may be equine specific. The lesions can occur anywhere on the body, often multiply, with the limbs, thorax–abdomen, head and paragenital areas being particularly commonly affected. The method of transmission is currently unclear; the involvement of face flies (Musca autumnalis) has been suggested, and transmission via contaminated tack is likely. The disease forms the only known example of natural cross-species infection by a papillomavirus. The involvement of BPV leads to hope that vaccination or antiviral therapy might be possible <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>future</b> <b>for</b> this common tumour.|$|E
25|$|Kings Gap is {{suitable}} habitat {{for a variety}} of reptiles, including the box turtle, the five-lined skink (one of Pennsylvania's few lizards), the northern copperhead and the timber rattlesnake. Sightings of these reptiles are not uncommon in the summer months. In the Mansion Day Use Area, copperheads and rattlesnakes are sometimes seen hunting rodents along the stone walls of the mansion patio and garden. Although these snakes are venomous and should be respected, in their natural habitats they retreat when threatened. The timber rattlesnake is classified as a candidate species in Pennsylvania, which means it could receive endangered or threatened status <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>future.</b> <b>For</b> additional information on these reptiles, contact the center office.|$|E

25|$|To {{alleviate}} this fundamentally flawed {{state of}} affairs, Skidmore {{argued for the}} end of the right of inheritance and for the strict leveling of property among adults. His program was straightforward: all property in the United States should be divvied up and redistributed, in equal shares, to American citizens. From that point on, Americans would own their share as private property, and would relinquish it only when they died. Private inheritance would be abolished, and the wealth of the deceased would be pooled into a fund and reserved, <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>future,</b> <b>for</b> young people when they reached the age of 18. Upon reaching that age, all Americans would inherit a generous sum of money, understood as their birthright, to get them started in adult life.|$|E
25|$|The {{field of}} {{three-dimensional}} and highly accurate models of biological systems is pioneered by multiple projects and technologies including a rapid method for creating tissues and even whole organs involves a 3D printer that can print the scaffolding and cells layer by layer into a working tissue sample or organ. The device {{is presented in}} a TED talk by Dr. Anthony Atala, M.D. the Director of the Wake Forest Institute for Regenerative Medicine, and the W.H. Boyce Professor and Chair of the Department of Urology at Wake Forest University, in which a kidney is printed on stage during the seminar and then presented to the crowd. It is anticipated that this technology will enable the production of livers <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>future</b> <b>for</b> transplantation and theoretically for toxicology and other biological studies as well.|$|E
25|$|The {{response}} to the unrest—giving the appearance of acquiescing to the workers' demands and meeting local grievances, then isolating the ringleaders by sending them away or imprisoning them once the strike had ended, and reneging on concessions—established a model for dealing with such incidents <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>future.</b> <b>For</b> example, other disturbances followed in Cluj-Napoca, Turda and Iași, where students and workers in two separate protests apparently marched through the streets to party headquarters. There was a strict news blackout on such events, but it seems these were peacefully and easily defused given the non-political nature of the demands (poor factory and dormitory conditions) and their timely resolution. The Jiu Valley strike, along with the Goma episode, taught dissidents that any public deviation from the regime would not be tolerated.|$|E

25|$|Neuer {{played for}} Schalke 04 II during the 2003–04, 2004–05, 2006–07, and 2008–09. Neuer signed {{professional}} terms in 2005 after progressing through every age group at his hometown club, Schalke 04. Neuer didn't make any first team appearances during the 2005–06 season. He made his Bundesliga debut with Schalke {{when he came}} on to substitute the injured Frank Rost on matchday 2 of the 2006–07 season. The 20-year-old eventually won the starting position when Rost was surprisingly dropped for the crunch clash against Bayern Munich. Neuer did not disappoint and managed to secure a 2–2 draw against the defending champions. He made 27 league appearances during the 2006–07 season. Despite his young age, he was widely tipped to be a potential successor to his former idol Jens Lehmann <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>future</b> <b>for</b> the German national team.|$|E
25|$|With {{the entire}} {{existing}} track in use since service to Wassaic was restored in 2000, {{there is little}} talk of expansion or branching. However, Metro-North will revisit a future extension northward if circumstances change. When plans were drawn up for extending the line northward from Dover Plains, the goal for Metro-North was to extend the line {{as far north as}} possible for a new yard, and to attract the most new passengers. Wassaic was the best site, and service was not extended to Millerton as the Harlem Valley Rail Trail was using the right-of-way. This is directly contrasts one of the main purposes of rail trails: to preserve the right-of-way to allow for rail service to be restored <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>future.</b> <b>For</b> now, Metro-North and the MTA have focused on improving existing facilities on the line, particularly stations such as Brewster where increasing usage has caused parking shortages.|$|E
25|$|Climate {{change has}} the {{potential}} to affect agriculture through changes in temperature, rainfall (timing and quantity), CO2, solar radiation and the interaction of these elements. Extreme events, such as droughts and floods, are forecast to increase as climate change takes hold. Agriculture is among sectors most vulnerable to the impacts of climate change; water supply for example, will be critical to sustain agricultural production and provide the increase in food output required to sustain the world's growing population. Fluctuations in the flow of rivers are likely to increase in the twenty-first century. Based on the experience of countries in the Nile river basin (Ethiopia, Kenya and Sudan) and other developing countries, depletion of water resources during seasons crucial for agriculture can lead to a decline in yield by up to 50%. Transformational approaches will be needed to manage natural resources <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>future.</b> <b>For</b> example, policies, practices and tools promoting climate-smart agriculture will be important, as will better use of scientific information on climate for assessing risks and vulnerability. Planners and policy-makers will need to help create suitable policies that encourage funding for such agricultural transformation.|$|E
