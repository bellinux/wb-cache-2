25|$|The Central Powers {{were slow}} to use these techniques; however, {{at the start of}} the war the Germans succeeded in {{inducing}} the Sultan of the Ottoman Empire to declare 'holy war', or Jihad, against the Western infidels. They also attempted to foment rebellion against the British Empire in places as far afield as Ireland, Afghanistan, and India. The Germans' greatest success was in giving the Russian revolutionary, Lenin, <b>free</b> <b>transit</b> on a sealed train from Switzerland to Finland after the overthrow of the Tsar. This soon paid off when the Bolshevik Revolution took Russia out of the war.|$|E
25|$|US {{involvement}} in the European war also led to formalization of security measures along the border. In an effort to exercise greater control over the border zone, the State Department called on American citizens to register for passports as soon as possible. These new regulations had a profound impact, as they halted the <b>free</b> <b>transit</b> across the open and unobstructed international line that had defined the relationship between Ambos Nogales. Moreover, entry into Nogales, Arizona, was now restricted to designated inspection stations along International Street, with soldiers posted at intervals along the international line to control human traffic into the US. For nogalenses who were accustomed to free passage between the two cities, these rules demanded a difficult adjustment that led to growing hostility between citizens of the two countries.|$|E

25|$|The {{stadium is}} served by Stadium station of the Edmonton Light Rail Transit's (LRT) Capital Line. During Eskimos games, the service {{frequency}} is increased.

Any holder of a pre-purchased ticket or an Edmonton Transit System ticket can travel for free on the services from these lots to Commonwealth Stadium. The program is initiated by the city to minimize parking and congestion in the stadium's neighborhood. Game day tickets are also valid fare on the LRT service from two hours prior to games to two hours after games.

2500|$|When some Portuguese {{proposed}} {{to buy a}} <b>free</b> <b>transit</b> document (one silver royal for each man) to avoid fighting, the [...] Cardinal Mendoza counselled [...] Ferdinand to send an order to spare any prisoner and to not offer resistance to those Portuguese who tried to cross the frontier, because other way, they would have no alternative except to fight and thereby prolonging the war and destruction inside [...] Castile: [...] "when this was known to the King, it was debated in his council if they should permit the returning of the Portuguese to Portugal in security. Some chevaliers and other men from the King's army whose sons and brothers and relatives were killed and wounded on the battle (...) worked to provoke the King (...). And brought into the King's memory the injuries and the cruel deaths inflicted by the Portuguese to the Castilians {{in the battle of}} Aljubarrota (...).The cardinal of Spain said: (...) Pero Gonzalez de Mendoza my great grandfather, lord of Aleva, was killed on that so called battle of Aljubarrota (...) and in the same way perished some of my relatives and many of Castile's important personalities. (...) do not think in revenge (...). It is sure that if the passage was made impossible for those [...] who go, they will be forced to stay in your kingdoms, making war and bad things (...). After hearing the cardinal's reasons, the King sent an order to not preclude the passage of the Portuguese, and to not cause them harm in any way." [...] (Pulgar). It was a variant of the principle attributed to [...] Sun Tzu: [...] "when enemy soldiers leave your country cover them with gold", except that in this case it was the enemy soldiers who left silver in Castilian territory in exchange for their <b>free</b> <b>transit.</b>|$|E
2500|$|Throughout the protests, {{a common}} tactic that has divided {{opinions}} among Venezuelans and the anti-government opposition has been erecting burning street barricades, colloquially known as guarimbas. Street barricades, which stop vehicles from passing, violate the 50th article {{of the constitution}} of Venezuela, which grants the right of <b>free</b> <b>transit.</b> Initially, these barricades consisted of piles of trash and cardboard set on fire at night, and were easily removed by Venezuelan security forces. Guarimbas have since evolved into [...] "fortress-like structures" [...] of bricks, mattresses, wooden planks and barbed wire guarded by protestors, who [...] "have to resort to guerrilla-style tactics to get a response from the government of President Nicolas Maduro". [...] However, their use is controversial. Critics claim guarimbas, which are primarily erected in residential areas, victimize local residents and businesses and have little political impact.|$|E
40|$|Cooperative Justice and <b>Free</b> Public <b>Transit</b> - Urban {{transportation}} {{is a central}} issue for theories of urban justice. The current car culture is unjust because it discriminates against those who cannot afford {{to be a part}} of it, and it is inefficient because it creates a collectively disadvantageous situation. In this paper, I will first argue that public policies should encourage a modal transfer from car to public transit. Drawing on a theory of cooperative justice, I will then argue that <b>free</b> public <b>transit</b> is mutually advantageous and can be defended from both the perspectives of equality and efficiency...|$|R

2500|$|The area is well-served {{by public}} transport. The New York City Subway serves Brownsville on the IRT New Lots Line (...) and BMT Canarsie Line (...) [...] The New Lots Line from Sutter Avenue–Rutland Road to Junius Street, and the Canarsie Line between Sutter Avenue and New Lots Avenue, are {{definitively}} in Brownsville, with the Atlantic Avenue and East 105th Street subway stations at the neighborhood's borders. Due {{to the lines}} being created by two different, competing subway companies (the Interborough Rapid Transit Company and the Brooklyn Rapid Transit Company, respectively), a <b>free</b> <b>transit</b> connection does not exist between the two lines, which provide the area's only subway service. A pedestrian bridge from the Livonia Avenue station on the Canarsie Line spans west across the Long Island Rail Road's Bay Ridge Branch to Junius Street, where an entrance to that street's station along the New Lots Line {{is less than a}} block away. There are proposals to convert the overpass into a free-transfer passage between the two stations, due to increasing ridership and plans for additional housing in the area. Money is allocated in the Metropolitan Transportation Authority's 2015–2019 Capital Program to build this transfer. The stations would also need to be upgraded to become compliant with mobility accessibility guidelines under the Americans with Disabilities Act of 1990.|$|E
2500|$|The School of Salamanca, which {{gathered}} theologians {{such as the}} Dominican Francisco de Vitoria (1480–1546), {{and later}} theologians, such as the highly influential Jesuit Francisco Suárez (1548–1617), argued {{in favor of the}} existence of rights to indigenous peoples. [...] For example, these theologians thought that it was illegitimate to conquer other peoples for religious reasons, or even to force the baptisms of non-Christian subjects. [...] Their views on non-believers had been already established by medieval discussions of Jewish and Muslim subjects of Christian princes. [...] Although this view was not always prevalent, it was the traditional Dominican and Thomist view, and reflected the practice of late antiquity and the early Middle Ages. However, while such theologians limited Charles V's imperial powers over colonized people, they also mentioned some legitimate reasons for the conquest. [...] For instance, on their view, war might be justified if the indigenous people refused <b>free</b> <b>transit</b> and commerce to the Europeans; if they forced converts to return to idolatry; if there come to be a sufficient number of Christians in the newly discovered land that they wish to receive from the Pope a Christian government; if the indigenous people lacked just laws, magistrates, agricultural techniques, etc. In any case, title taken according to this principle must be exercised with Christian charity, warned Suárez, and for the advantage of the Indians. More traditional theologians legitimized the conquest {{while at the same time}} limiting the absolute power of the sovereign, which was celebrated in others parts of Europe under the developing notion of the divine right of kings.|$|E
