5|$|During the 2014 festival, a 26-year-old Berkshire man {{suffered}} from a suspected reaction to <b>Ketamine</b> and later died in Bristol Royal Infirmary. Despite this, police reported that crime was down 30% from last year but reminded festival goers to look after their possessions.|$|E
5|$|Feynman tried LSD {{during his}} {{professorship}} at Caltech. He also tried marijuana and <b>ketamine</b> experiences at John Lilly's famed sensory deprivation tanks, {{as a way}} of studying consciousness. He gave up alcohol when he began to show vague, early signs of alcoholism, as {{he did not want to}} do anything that could damage his brain.|$|E
5|$|Spontaneous {{ventilation}} {{has been}} traditionally performed with an inhalational agent (i.e. gas induction or inhalational induction using halothane or sevoflurane) however {{it can also}} be performed using intravenous anaesthesia (e.g. propofol, <b>ketamine</b> or dexmedetomidine). SponTaneous Respiration using IntraVEnous anaesthesia and High-flow nasal oxygen (STRIVE Hi) is an open airway technique that uses an upwards titration of propofol which maintains ventilation at deep levels of anaesthesia. It has been used in airway surgery as an alternative to tracheal intubation.|$|E
5|$|Winehouse's {{battles with}} {{substance}} abuse were {{the subject of much}} media attention. In 2005, she went through a period of drinking, heavy drug use, and weight loss. People who saw her during the end of that year and early 2006 reported a rebound that coincided with the writing of Back to Black. Her family believes that the mid-2006 death of her grandmother, who was a stabilising influence, set her off into addiction. In August 2007, Winehouse cancelled a number of shows in the UK and Europe, citing exhaustion and ill health. She was hospitalised during this period for what was reported as an overdose of heroin, ecstasy, cocaine, <b>ketamine</b> and alcohol. In various interviews, she admitted to having such problems with self-harm, depression, and eating disorders.|$|E
5|$|The Commandoes Mob {{was formed}} in 2004 {{when a group of}} Gattaca females teamed up with a Young Ones roving coalition. Aragorn and Zorilla {{established}} dominance after several disputes. They remained the dominant pair till 2007 when Aragorn died. After the death of Aragorn, his son <b>Ketamine</b> established natal dominance beside his mother. Then five Whiskers males emigrated and all natal adult males had left, Zarathustra became dominant male till he was predated. Then Baker took his position but Miles stole it from him. Throuought their history, the Commandos had been a fast-growing group, unlike their founding group the Gattaca. In January 2009, Zorilla, Miles, Baker Karim and Cody were killed by TB, the group is led by Whiskers male Panthro and Commandos female Celidh. Disease hit the group killing a few members. The Commandos left the monitored area and could no longer be tracked. A few new groups were formed from Commandos members. The Kung Fu was formed by Zorilla's sister. The Geckos and Sequioa were formed by Zorilla and Aragorn's daughters. Benzedrine is the last known surviving Commandos meerkat today.|$|E
5|$|The agents {{call the}} police, who take Mulder with them {{due to the}} circumstantial {{evidence}} against him. Scully performs an autopsy on Amy Cassandra, finding a scab on her forehead. The detective {{in charge of the}} case tells Mulder that they have found David and Amy's blood on his shirt. Mulder refuses to confess to the murders, not remembering anything. Scully arrives, saying she found in Amy's blood traces of <b>ketamine,</b> an anesthesic substance that has hallucinogenic properties. The substance was detected in Mulder's blood as well. Meanwhile, one of the officers at the station kills himself; he has similar symptoms to that of the Cassandras. Mulder suffers a seizure and flashes back to his childhood again, witnessing his parents arguing with The Smoking Man. Scully sees Mulder the next day, telling him that she believes that the Cassandras killed themselves after receiving psychiatric treatment and that Mulder was visiting them about their alien abduction experiences.|$|E
25|$|Drowsiness, dissociation, and psychosis-like effects (e.g., hallucinations, delirium) are {{reported}} in patients treated with <b>ketamine</b> starting at circulating concentrations of around 50 to 200ng/mL (210–841nM), while analgesia begins at levels of approximately 100 to 200ng/mL (421–841nM). The typical intravenous antidepressant dosage of <b>ketamine</b> used to treat depression is low and results in maximal plasma concentrations of 70 to 200ng/mL (294–841nM). Circulating concentrations of around 2,000 to 3,000ng/mL (8,413–12,620nM) are employed during anesthesia, and patients may start to awaken once levels of <b>ketamine</b> have decreased to about 500 to 1,000ng/mL (2,103–4,207nM). There is wide variation in the peak concentrations of <b>ketamine</b> that {{have been reported in}} association with anesthesia in the literature, with values ranging from 2,211–3,447ng/mL (9,300–14,500nM) to as high as 22,370ng/mL (94,100nM). Bioactive concentrations of <b>ketamine</b> are lower than total plasma levels due to plasma protein binding, although plasma protein binding is relatively low with <b>ketamine</b> (approximately 12 to 47% protein-bound). Concentrations of <b>ketamine</b> in the brain have been reported to be several-fold higher than in plasma.|$|E
25|$|In {{chemical}} structure, <b>ketamine</b> is an arylcyclohexylamine derivative. <b>Ketamine</b> is a chiral compound. Most {{pharmaceutical preparations}} of <b>ketamine</b> are racemic; however, some brands reportedly have (mostly undocumented) {{differences in their}} enantiomeric proportions. The more active enantiomer, esketamine (S-ketamine), is also available for medical use under the brand name Ketanest S, while the less active enantiomer, arketamine (R-ketamine), has never been marketed as an enantiopure drug for clinical use.|$|E
25|$|Although <b>ketamine</b> is a {{very weak}} ligand of the monoamine {{transporters}} (Ki > 60,000nM), {{it has been suggested}} that it may interact with allosteric sites on the monoamine transporters to produce monoamine reuptake inhibition. However, no functional inhibition (IC50) of the human monoamine transporters has been observed with <b>ketamine</b> or its metabolites at concentrations of up to 10,000nM. Moreover, animal studies and at least three human case reports have found no interaction between <b>ketamine</b> and the monoamine oxidase inhibitor (MAOI) tranylcypromine. Collectively, these findings shed doubt on the involvement of monoamine reuptake inhibition in the effects of <b>ketamine</b> in humans. <b>Ketamine</b> has been found to increase dopaminergic neurotransmission in the brain, but instead of via dopamine reuptake inhibition, this may be via indirect/downstream mechanisms, namely antagonism of the NMDA receptor.|$|E
25|$|<b>Ketamine</b> {{has been}} found to act as a potent partial agonist of the high-affinity state of the human and rat {{dopamine}} D2 receptors in multiple studies. Its apparent potency for this action {{is similar to that of}} its NMDA receptor antagonism. However, there are also contradictory data, with studies finding an affinity of <b>ketamine</b> of >10,000nbsp&nM for the regular human and rat D2 receptors, and direct interactions with the D2 receptor are controversial. Moreover, whereas D2 receptor agonists like bromocriptine are able to rapidly and powerfully suppress prolactin secretion, subanesthetic doses of <b>ketamine</b> have not been found to do this in humans and in fact have been found to significantly and dose-dependently increase prolactin levels. Imaging studies have shown mixed results on inhibition of striatal raclopride binding by <b>ketamine</b> in humans, with some studies finding a significant decrease and others finding no such effect. However, changes in raclopride binding may be due to changes in dopamine concentrations induced by <b>ketamine</b> rather than binding of <b>ketamine</b> to the D2 receptor.|$|E
25|$|<b>Ketamine</b> is {{primarily}} sold {{throughout the world}} under the brand name Ketalar. It is also marketed {{under a variety of}} other brand names, including Calypsol, Ketamin, Ketamina, <b>Ketamine,</b> Ketaminol, Ketanest, Ketaset, Tekam, and Vetalar among others.|$|E
25|$|Metabolites of <b>ketamine</b> {{including}} dehydronorketamine, hydroxynorketamine, and norketamine {{have been}} found to act as negative allosteric modulators of the α7 nicotinic acetylcholine receptor in the KXa7R1 cell line (HEK293 cells transfected with rat nicotinic acetylcholine receptor genes) with subanesthetic and nanomolar potencies (e.g., IC50 = 55nM for dehydronorketamine), whereas <b>ketamine</b> itself was inactive at the same concentrations (< 1nbsp&µM). These findings suggest that metabolites may contribute importantly to the pharmacodynamics of <b>ketamine.</b>|$|E
25|$|December 8, 2016 - Malaysian police {{crippled}} a China-linked <b>ketamine</b> distribution syndicate and {{uncovered a}} drug lab in Bukit Jalil. A raid spearheaded by STING seized 210kg of China-made <b>ketamine,</b> {{and other drugs}} syabu, Eramine-5, ecstasy, and yaba pills worth RM15.5 million. Initial investigations revealed that the <b>ketamine</b> was intended for the local market, and could supply up to 540,000 addicts. All detained will be investigated under Section 39B, Dangerous Drugs Act 1952, which carries mandatory death penalty upon conviction.|$|E
25|$|Some anesthetics like <b>ketamine</b> and etomidate.|$|E

25|$|<b>Ketamine</b> {{was first}} {{synthesized}} in 1962 by Calvin L. Stevens, {{a professor of}} Chemistry at Wayne State University and a Parke Davis consultant conducting research on alpha-hydroxyimine rearrangements. After promising preclinical research in animals, <b>ketamine</b> was introduced to testing in human prisoners in 1964. These investigations demonstrated ketamine's short duration of action and reduced behavioral toxicity made it a favorable choice over phencyclidine (PCP) as a dissociative anesthetic. Following FDA approval in 1970, <b>ketamine</b> anesthesia was first given to American soldiers during the Vietnam War.|$|E
25|$|Cardiovascular: <b>Ketamine</b> {{stimulates the}} {{sympathetic}} nervous system, resulting in cardiovascular changes.|$|E
25|$|In medical settings, <b>ketamine</b> {{is usually}} {{injected}} intravenously or intramuscularly.|$|E
25|$|In Canada, <b>ketamine</b> is {{classified}} as a Schedule I narcotic, since 2005.|$|E
25|$|Among the dissociatives, {{phencyclidine}} (PCP), and <b>ketamine</b> are {{the most}} sought after.|$|E
25|$|Respiratory: <b>Ketamine</b> causes bronchodilation. Several {{mechanisms}} {{have been}} hypothesized {{to explain this}} effect.|$|E
25|$|Gastrointestinal: <b>Ketamine</b> {{produces}} {{nausea and}} vomiting in 15 to 25% of individuals at anesthetic doses.|$|E
25|$|It {{has been}} used (in {{combination}} with <b>ketamine,</b> midazolam, and amantadine) in treatment of rabies.|$|E
25|$|<b>Ketamine</b> {{acts as a}} {{selective}} antagonist of the NMDA receptor, an ionotropic glutamate receptor. It binds specifically to the dizocilpine (MK-801) site of the NMDA receptor, near the channel pore, and is an uncompetitive antagonist. <b>Ketamine</b> may also interact with and inhibit the NMDAR via another allosteric site on the receptor. Its full mechanism of action is not well-understood as of 2017.|$|E
25|$|Because of {{its ability}} to cause {{confusion}} and amnesia, <b>ketamine</b> can leave users vulnerable to date rape.|$|E
25|$|OBEs can {{be induced}} by {{hallucinogens}} (particularly dissociatives) such as psilocybin, <b>ketamine,</b> DMT, MDA, and LSD.|$|E
25|$|<b>Ketamine</b> {{use as a}} {{recreational}} drug has been implicated in deaths globally, with more than 90 deaths in England and Wales in the years of 2005–2013. They include accidental poisonings, drownings, traffic accidents, and suicides. The majority of deaths were among young people. This has led to increased regulation (e.g., upgrading <b>ketamine</b> from a Class C to a Class B banned substance in the U.K.).|$|E
25|$|<b>Ketamine,</b> an NMDA {{antagonist}} drug, {{can be used}} as a {{last resort}} for drug-resistant status epilepticus.|$|E
25|$|While <b>ketamine</b> {{is legally}} marketed in many {{countries}} worldwide, {{it is also a}} widely controlled substance throughout the world.|$|E
25|$|Other arylcyclohexylamines and analogues of <b>ketamine</b> include {{eticyclidine}} (PCE), 3-MeO-PCE, methoxetamine (MXE), tiletamine, phencyclidine (PCP), tenocyclidine (TCP), {{and many}} others.|$|E
25|$|Other psychotropic {{analgesic}} agents include <b>ketamine</b> (an NMDA receptor antagonist), clonidine {{and other}} α2-adrenoreceptor agonists, and mexiletine {{and other local}} anaesthetic analogues.|$|E
25|$|<b>Ketamine</b> can {{be started}} using the oral route, or {{people may be}} changed from a {{subcutaneous}} infusion once pain is controlled.|$|E
25|$|The South China Morning Post {{reports the}} rise in the use of <b>ketamine,</b> easy to mass-produce in illicit labs in {{southern}} China, particularly among the young. Because of its low cost, and low profit margin, drug peddlers rely on mass distribution to make money, thus increasing its penetrative power to all, including schoolchildren. The journal cites social workers saying that four people can get high by sharing just HK$20 worth of <b>ketamine,</b> and estimates 80 per cent of young drug addicts take 'K'.|$|E
25|$|The N-methyl-D-aspartate (NMDA) {{receptor}} {{seems to}} play a major role in neuropathic pain and in the development of opioid tolerance. Dextromethorphan is an NMDA antagonist at high doses. Experiments in both animals and humans have established that NMDA antagonists such as <b>ketamine</b> and dextromethorphan can alleviate neuropathic pain and reverse opioid tolerance. Unfortunately, only a few NMDA antagonists are clinically available and their use is limited by a very short half life (dextromethorphan), weak activity (memantine) or unacceptable side effects (<b>ketamine).</b>|$|E
25|$|In {{otherwise}} normal individuals, exogenous ligands {{can produce}} psychotic symptoms. NMDA receptor antagonists, such as <b>ketamine,</b> {{can produce a}} similar psychosis to that experienced in schizophrenia.|$|E
25|$|Some specialists {{stop the}} {{subcutaneous}} infusion {{when the first}} dose of oral <b>ketamine</b> is given. Others gradually reduce the infusion dose as the oral dose is increased.|$|E
