The plan is being implemented by the Lake Champlain Basin Program and its partners at the state, provincial, <b>federal,</b> <b>and</b> <b>local</b> levels.

25|$|Tombstone, Arizona was a {{turbulent}} mining town that flourished longer than most, from 1877 to 1929. Silver {{was discovered in}} 1877, and by 1881 the town had a population of over 10,000. In 1879 the newly arrived Earp brothers bought shares in the Vizina mine, water rights, and gambling concessions, but Virgil, Wyatt, and Morgan Earp obtained positions at different times as <b>federal</b> <b>and</b> <b>local</b> lawmen. After {{more than a year}} of threats and feuding, they killed three outlaws in the Gunfight at the O.K. Corral, the most famous gunfight of the Old West. In the aftermath, Virgil Earp was maimed in an ambush and Morgan Earp was assassinated while playing billiards. Wyatt and others, including his brothers James Earp and Warren Earp, pursued those they believed responsible in an extra-legal vendetta and warrants were issued for their arrest in the murder of Frank Stilwell. The Cochise County Cowboys were one of the first organized crime syndicates in the United States, and their demise came in the hands of Wyatt Earp.|$|E
