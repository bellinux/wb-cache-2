50|$|Ocean voyages are {{steeped in}} routine. Maritime {{tradition}} dictates that each day {{be divided into}} six four-hour periods. Three groups of watch keepers from the engine and <b>deck</b> <b>departments</b> work four hours on then have eight hours off watch keeping. However, there are many overtime jobs to be done daily. This cycle repeats endlessly, 24 hours a day while the ship is at sea. Members of the steward department typically are day workers who put in at least eight-hour shifts. Operations at sea, including repairs, safeguarding against piracy, securing cargo, underway replenishment, and other duties provide opportunities for overtime work. Service aboard ships typically extends {{for months at a}} time, followed by protracted shore leave. However, some seamen secure jobs on ships they like and stay aboard for years.|$|R

40|$|A {{new time}} domain method is {{presented}} to identify moving loads on a bridge deck {{based on the measured}} responses. The bridge deck is modeled as an orthotropic plate and the loads are modeled as a group of four loads moving on top of the bridge deck at fixed distance apart. Dynamic behavior of the bridge deck is analyzed by the orthotropic plate theory and mode superposition technique. Like all inverse problems, this identification is an ill-conditioned problem, and a regularization technique is employed to stabilize the computations. The identified loads moving at different eccentricities are presented. Laboratory work on the force identification is also presented. The effect of incomplete measured modes in the responses is discussed, and an underestimation in the loads may result if the number of vibration mode for identification is larger than that in the responses. Computational simulations and laboratory tests show that the method is effective and practical for identification of individual wheel loads on bridge <b>decks.</b> <b>Department</b> of Civil and Environmental Engineerin...|$|R

A 1 / 10 scale double-deck bus model was constructed. A pool fire was placed at different positions of the lower deck of the bus model. Smoke spreading from the lower deck to the upper deck was observed. Air temperature profiles in the two decks were measured. Further, performance of two smoke control schemes with natural vents was evaluated. By opening a ceiling vent or the rear window, smoke can be removed.

40|$|In {{an effort}} to {{minimize}} corrosion of the reinforcement in bridge <b>decks,</b> the Iowa <b>Department</b> of Transportation started using epoxy-coated rebars as top reinforcing mat around 1976. However, the presence of cracks in bridge decks has raised some concerns among bridge and maintenance engineers. The impact of deck cracking on the service life of a bridge deck was investigated herein. This was accomplished by collecting core samples from 80 bridges, calculating the chloride content in these cores, developing a relationship for chloride infiltration through the deck, examining the condition of several rebar samples, and developing a rebar rating-age relationship, and estimating a bridge deck service life. No signs of corrosion were observed on the rebars collected from uncracked locations. In addition, no delaminations or spalls {{were found on the}} decks where bars at cracked location exhibit some signs of corrosion. Considering a corrosion threshold for epoxy-coated rebars that range from 3. 6 lb/ yd 3 to 7. 2 lb/yd 3, the predicted service life for Iowa Bridge decks was over 50 years.

40|$|In {{recognizing}} that small structural defects could be often discerned from {{the variation in}} strain or its derivatives rather than in acceleration, strain-based methods for structural damage detection have received increasing attention recently. In this study, the neutral-axis position of bridge deck cross-sections is proposed as a damage indicator for bridge deck assessment and a Kalman filter (KF) based method for optimal estimation of the neutral-axis position from dynamic strain measurement data under operational traffic is developed. As observed from the monitoring data, under traffic effect, bridge deck performs like a flexural beam, i. e., the deck top compresses and the deck bottom extends concurrently, or vice versa. Based {{on the relationship between}} the neutral-axis position and strain response, a KF estimator for locating the neutral-axis position is formulated and used to verify its robustness to noise disturbance through numerical simulations. The numerical studies show that the estimator generates satisfactory results in the presence of noise. The proposed K. F estimator is further applied for neutral-axis estimation of the suspension Tsing Ma Bridge (TMB) using long-term monitoring data of dynamic strain responses. The results show that the neutral-axis position is insensitive to the traffic environment and hence can serve as an indicator for <b>deck</b> condition assessment. <b>Department</b> of Civil and Environmental EngineeringRefereed conference pape...|$|R
