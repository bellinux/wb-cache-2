Standard practice amongst both practitioners and academics is to assume a smooth pattern in these expenditures past some future point, and such a pattern is improbable. This paper develops a model that rests upon much less restrictive assumptions, shows that the model is readily amenable to implementation, and that the difference in valuation results could be quite substantial.

40|$|Radiatively driven flow in a {{luminous}} disk is {{examined in the}} subrelativistic regime of (v/c) ^ 1, taking account of radiation transfer. The flow {{is assumed to be}} vertical, and the gravity and gas pressure are ignored. When internal heating is dropped, for a given optical depth and radiation pressure at the flow base (disk "inside"), where the flow speed is zero, the flow is analytically solved under the appropriate boundary condition at the flow top (disk "surface"), where the optical depth is zero. The loaded mass and terminal speed of the flow are both determined by the initial conditions; the mass-loss rate increases as the initial radiation pressure increases, while the <b>flow</b> <b>terminal</b> speed increases as the initial radiation pressure and the loaded mass decrease. In particular, when heating is ignored, the radiative flux F is constant and the radiation pressure P_ 0 at the flow base with optical depth tau_ 0 is bound in the range of 2 / 3 < cP_ 0 /F = 2 / 3 + tau_ 0. In this case, at the limit of (cP_ 0) /F = 2 / 3 + tau_ 0, the loaded mass diverges and the <b>flow</b> <b>terminal</b> speed becomes zero, while, at the limit of (cP_ 0) /F = 2 / 3, the loaded mass becomes zero and the terminal speed approaches (3 / 8) _c, which is the terminal speed above the luminous flat disk under an approximation of the order of (v/c) ^ 1. We also examine the case where heating exists, and find that the flow properties are qualitatively similar to the case without heating...|$|E
30|$|Bladder {{symptoms}} are divided in irritative and obstructive. The first ones can be presented as an overactive bladder syndrome, which involves an overexcited detrusor muscle, which cause urgency, pollakiuria, nocturia and urgency incontinence. Obstructive {{symptoms are}} related to a pseudo-obstructive bladder, which represent a late phase of the diabetic neuropathy and are characterized by low uroflowmetry, high postmictional residue, and a hypotonic bladder in the cystometry. The last one reflects a myogenic alteration of the neuronal and microvasculature. These pseudo-obstructive symptoms include a decreased size and strength of the voiding <b>flow,</b> <b>terminal</b> dribbling, decreased sensation of a full bladder and high post void residual urine (very similar to those seen in the benign prostate hyperplasia) (Daneshgari et al. 2009; Liu and Daneshgari 2006).|$|E

40|$|Regional blood {{flows in}} the heart muscle are remarkably heterogeneous. It is very likely that the most {{important}} factor for this heterogeneity is the metabolic need of the tissue rather than flow dispersion by the branching network of the coronary vasculature. To model the contribution of tissue needs to the observed flow heterogeneities we use arterial trees generated on the computer by constrained constructive optimization. This method allows to prescribe <b>terminal</b> <b>flows</b> as independent boundary conditions, rather than obtaining these flows by the dispersive effects of the tree structure. We study two specific cases: equal <b>terminal</b> <b>flows</b> (model 1) and <b>terminal</b> <b>flows</b> set proportional to the volumes of Voronoi polyhedra used as a model for blood supply regions of terminal segments (model 2). Model 1 predicts, depending on the number Nterm of end-points, fractal dimensions D of perfusion heterogeneities in the range 1. 20 to 1. 40 and positively correlated nearest-neighbor regional flows, in good agreement with experimental data of the normal heart. Although model 2 yields reasonable <b>terminal</b> <b>flows</b> well approximated by a lognormal distribution, it fails to predict D and nearest-neighbor correlation coefficients r 1 of regional flows under normal physiologic conditions: model 2 gives D = 1. 69 ± 0. 02 and r 1 = − 0. 18 ± 0. 03 (n = 5), independent of Nterm and consistent with experimental data observed under coronary stenosis and under the reduction of coronary perfusion pressure. In conclusion, flow heterogeneity can be modeled by terminal positions compatible with an existing tree structure without resorting to the flow-dispersive effects of a specific branching tree model to assign <b>terminal</b> <b>flows...</b>|$|R

40|$|This paper {{develops}} algorithms {{to ensure}} that agents of a mobile micro autonomous system (MMAS) maintain integrity of communication flows as they move to accomplish their task. Due to inherent uncertainties in estimation of wireless channels, we advocate a stochastic approach whereby achievable communication rates of point-to-point links are regarded as random variables with known means and variances. To achieve reliable end-to-end communication <b>flows,</b> <b>terminals</b> route their traffic through various alternative paths to reduce the effect of uncertainty in individual link rates. The proposed algorithms are optimal and robust in that routes are obtained as solutions of optimization problems subject to constraints on minimum required rates and maximum acceptable variances. Algorithms are tested in an event-based simulator that uses an accurate data-driven model of radio communications to model both the structure of code running independently on multiple robots {{as well as the}} transmission of messages via a real radio.

40|$|Swash zone {{boundary}} conditions are investigated using field {{observations of the}} inner surf zone and the swash zone {{for a range of}} micro-tidal, predominantly swell-dominated, sandy beaches. The boundary conditions are characterized in terms of a terminal bore height and the asymmetry between uprush and backwash <b>flows.</b> <b>Terminal</b> bore heights are calculated by examining wave evolution across the surf zone. This is investigated in terms of wave height to water depth ratios (γ) and waves are shown to be unsaturated. These observations are used to approximate the terminal bore height at the surf swash boundary as Hb≈ 0. 12 Ho, which is consistent with recent laboratory data sets. Wave transformation modelling is used to identify conditions where the surf zone is predicted to be unsaturated and this is found to occur for steep beaches and large wave periods. A normalised beach slope parameter is derived to separate these two regions. The asymmetry between uprush and backwash flows is investigated using remote sensing techniques. The time of flow reversal in the swash zone was found to occur at approximately 40 - 50 % of the duration of the swash cycle, which is significantly different from previous theory...|$|R

40|$|We {{present a}} new general scheme for calculating the {{structure}} and dynamics of radiation pressure driven, photoionized flows. The new method goes one step beyond the Sobolev approximation. It involves a numerical solution of the radiative transfer in absorption lines including the effects of differential expansion and line interactions such as line locking and blanketing. We also present a new scheme for calculating the radiation pressure due to trapped line photons in finite, differentially expanding flows. We compare our results for the radiation pressure force with those obtained using the Sobolev approximation and show {{the limitations of the}} latter. In particular, we demonstrate that the Sobolev method gives a poor approximation near discontinuity surfaces and its neglect of line blanketing can lead to erroneous results in high velocity flows. We combine the newly calculated radiation pressure force with self-consistent photoionization and thermal calculations to study the dynamics and spectral features of broad absorption line flows and highly ionized gas flows in AGN. A comparison with Sobolev-type calculations shows that the latter over estimates the <b>flow's</b> <b>terminal</b> velocity and, conversely, under estimates its opacity.

40|$|Freight {{transport}} {{planning is}} nowadays encouraged to align with environmental objectives. Among those, {{climate change is}} of particular interest for many countries. In its White Paper on Transport, the European Commission considers intermodal transport as a potential solution for reducing environmental impacts. In order to make good strategic transport decisions, realistic decision support models for freight transport networks must be developed, so that insights can be derived for the different stakeholders of the transportation chain. This research proposes a bi-objective mathematical formulation which takes into account economic and environmental objectives, on a road and intermodal network with three modes of transport (road, intermodal rail, and intermodal inland waterways), and in which economies of scale of intermodal transport can be considered. With this model better fitting reality, an application to the Belgian case study provides practical information on how <b>flows,</b> <b>terminal</b> types and locations vary depending on the chosen policy, on the integration or not of economies of scale, on costs or emissions modifications and on the number of terminals to locate.

40|$|This paper {{presents}} and discusses physical models for simulating {{some aspects of}} neural intelligence, and, in particular, the process of cognition. The main departure from the classical approach here is in utilization of a terminal version of classical dynamics introduced by the author earlier. Based upon violations of the Lipschitz condition at equilibrium points, terminal dynamics attains two new fundamental properties: it is spontaneous and nondeterministic. Special {{attention is focused on}} terminal neurodynamics as a particular architecture of terminal dynamics which is suitable for modeling of information <b>flows.</b> <b>Terminal</b> neurodynamics possesses a well-organized probabilistic structure which can be analytically predicted, prescribed, and controlled, and therefore which presents a powerful tool for modeling real-life uncertainties. Two basic phenomena associated with random behavior of neurodynamic solutions are exploited. The first one is a stochastic attractor; a stable stationary stochastic process to which random solutions of a closed system converge. As a model of the cognition process, a stochastic attractor {{can be viewed as a}} universal tool for generalization and formation of classes of patterns. The concept of stochastic attractor is applied to model a collective brain paradigm explaining coordination between simple units of intelligence which perform a collective task without direct exchange of information. The second fundamental phenomenon discussed is terminal chaos which occurs in open systems. Applications of terminal chaos to information fusion as well as to explanation and modeling of coordination among neurons in biological systems are discussed. It should be emphasized that all the models of terminal neurodynamics are implementable in analog devices, which means that all the cognition processes discussed in the paper are reducible to the laws of Newtonian mechanics...|$|R
