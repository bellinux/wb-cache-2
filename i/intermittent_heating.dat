30|$|The {{effect of}} {{intermittent}} heat treatment on cellulose crystallites in wood was studied to evaluate quantitatively the changes of crystallinity induced by intermittent and continuous heating. The changes in crystallinity {{were found to}} be strongly affected by the intermittent heat treatment. The increased crystallinity, the width of the crystals, and the piezoelectric properties were the same for the first <b>intermittent</b> <b>heating</b> as for continuous heating. Further <b>intermittent</b> <b>heating</b> for the same time duration and temperature had no effect on the above properties, probably due to the stopping of the thermal reaction during the interval. Our results suggested that intermittent heat treatment has certain critical cooling temperatures that stop the thermal reaction and are closely related to the duration of the interval. Samples once exposed to a certain duration of heat treatment and then cooled need more time, about twice that of the first duration of <b>intermittent</b> <b>heating</b> compared with continuous heating, to reach maximum crystallinity in wood cellulose.|$|E
40|$|International audienceRecently, we {{suggested}} {{that the source of}} ion heating in solar coronal holes is small-scale reconnection events (microflares) at the coronal base. The microflares launch <b>intermittent</b> <b>heat</b> flux up into the corona exciting ion cyclotron waves through a plasma microinstability. The ions are heated by these waves during the microflare bursts and then evolve with no energy input between the bursts. The overall coronal heating by this mechanism is a summed effect of all microflare bursts during the expansion time of the solar wind and adiabatic cooling between the microflares. The <b>intermittent</b> <b>heat</b> flux produced by the microflares was modeled as electron beams with constant speed and temperature for simplicity. In this paper, we consider a more sophisticated model of the heat flux taking into account the action of the mirror force and the charge separation electric field on the beam particles. We show that the radial evolution of the heat flux is determined mainly by the beam expansion along the magnetic field roughly at the root mean square velocity of the beam particles, while the variation of the beam bulk speed and thermal energy is less important...|$|R

However, data available for assessing the predictability of the creep behaviour are somewhat scarce since creep testing has generally been for constant temperature and load conditions. The present investigation was conducted on three advanced 9 - 12 %Cr martensitic/ferritic steels (P 91, P 92 and E 911) in an effort to obtain more complete description and understanding of the role of degradation processes in high temperature creep during <b>intermittent</b> <b>heating.</b> A comparison between the creep characteristics of non-steady and monotonously loaded creep specimens has revealed no significant deterioration of the creep strength and fracture resistance of the steels P 91, P 92 and E 911 under non-steady loading in power-law (dislocation) creep.

40|$|Graduation date: 2015 In horticultural {{nurseries}} for container-grown plants, {{production and}} {{sales have been}} threatened {{by the presence of}} a quarantined plant pathogen, Phytophthora ramorum (causal agent of sudden oak death). Infested nursery beds are an important source of P. ramorum, which can initiate disease through movement with surface water to infect roots or can be splashed onto foliage. My research objectives were 1) to investigate the potential use of soil solarization (solar heating of soil) to control soilborne P. ramorum and another species Phytophthora pini, 2) to examine solarization effects on an introduced biocontrol agent Trichoderma asperellum and on indigenous soil microbial communities, and 3) to determine the major factors defining survival of the pathogens and to develop a useful mathematical model to predict the minimum time period required for solarization to kill the pathogens. Field trials were conducted in San Rafael, California (CA) and Corvallis, Oregon (OR) U. S. A. with rhododendron leaf disk inoculum infested by P. ramorum or P. pini. In lab experiments, thermal inactivation curves were determined for inoculum of both species exposed to stable high temperatures. P. pini had greater heat tolerance than P. ramorum. Both species survived high temperature treatment longer at lower water potentials than at higher water potentials as demonstrated in polyethylene glycol solutions as well as in soil. <b>Intermittent</b> <b>heat</b> was less effective in killing the pathogens than was continuous heat for the equivalent total heat exposure period. The rate of physiological damage to the inoculum was not constant but rather increased with exposure to continuous heat. In contrast, damage from multiple sub-lethal heat events accumulated at a constant rate, allowing calculation of total damage as the sum damage from each heat event. A predictive model was established with the parameters of temperature, water potential, and <b>intermittent</b> <b>heat</b> regime effects based on lab experiments. The model was tested with inoculum recovery data from field trials in bare soil, or soil covered with a 5 - or 7. 5 -cm- thick layer of gravel as is typical of container nurseries. The presence of a gravel layer in solarized plots increased belowground temperature relative to plots without gravel and resulted in a lower water potential of leaf disk inoculum placed at the surface or buried within the gravel layer. The prediction of inoculum survival time was significantly improved by adding the factors water potential and <b>intermittent</b> <b>heat</b> regime to the model in addition to temperature. Solarization enhanced subsequent establishment of T. asperellum although there was no significant reduction in Phytophthora spp. recovery after application of the biocontrol agent. High throughput sequencing analysis with the Illumina Miseq platform revealed the response of soil prokaryotic and fungal communities to solarization and demonstrated heat sensitivities of individual taxa. This study resulted in development of a mathematical model to predict critical conditions of temperature and moisture necessary to kill soilborne inoculum of Phytophthora spp. during soil solarization, and contributed to an understanding of solarization effects on an introduced biocontrol agent and on indigenous microbial communities...|$|R

40|$|Friction pendulums are {{relatively}} new and cheaper seismic isolators {{that is increasingly}} attracting the interest of both the technical and scientific communities {{as an alternative to}} the already widely adopted elastomeric ones. Even if its effectiveness has been extensively proved, many aspects concerning the behavior under seismic action still need to be clarified.

Sesquiterpene hydrocarbons (C 15) not only share the structural properties thought to lend protective qualities to isoprene and monoterpene hydrocarbons, but also react rapidly with ozone, suggesting that sesquiterpenes may similarly enhance tolerance of abiotic stresses. To test whether sesquiterpenes protect plants against ozone, UVB light, or drought, we used transgenic lines of the wild tobacco Nicotiana attenuata. The transgenic plants expressed a maize terpene synthase gene (ZmTPS 10) which produced a blend of (E) -ß-farnesene and (E) -α-bergamotene, or a point mutant of the same gene (ZmTPS 10 M) which produced (E) -ß-farnesene alone,.

40|$|The main aim of {{this study}} is to derive some simple rules for an optimal {{management}} of direct electric heating in residential buildings. Optimal management should minimise the running cost of heating while maintaining comfort, in the case of control strategies involving <b>intermittent</b> <b>heating.</b> This study has been carried out with the help of numerical simulation in a graphical environment [1] in order to study the behaviour of a whole system, referred to as a simulator, which consists of the building zone, the heating system and the controller. We chose an optimisation function of a mathematical software [2] to determine the optimal value of the operating cost. The coupling between the simulator and the optimisation algorithm is done automatically during the simulation in order to determine the optimal management scenario. The relevance of the work lies in the coupling between the simulator and the optimisation algorithm. This coupling was made possible thanks to the structuring of the simulator following a modelling methodology and parametering rules developed by CSTB [3]. The methodology enabled an efficient modelling of the system to carry out the optimisation analysis automatically on a large number of cases. The analysis by "experiment plans " on the simulation results obtained allowed the definition of rules for the optimal management of direct electric heating.

40|$|The {{memory and}} {{rejuvenation}} aspects of <b>intermittent</b> <b>heat</b> transport are explored theoretically and by numerical simulation for Ising spin glasses with short-ranged interactions. The theoretical part develops {{a picture of}} non-equilibrium glassy dynamics recently introduced by the authors. Invoking the concept of marginal stability, this theory links irreversible `intermittent' events, or `quakes' to thermal fluctuations of record magnitude. The pivotal {{idea is that the}} largest energy barrier b(t_w,T) surmounted prior to t_w by thermal fluctuations at temperature T determines the rate r_q ∝ 1 /t_w of the intermittent events occurring near t_w. The idea leads to a rate of intermittent events after a negative temperature shift given by r_q ∝ 1 /t_w^eff, where the `effective age' t_w^eff≥ t_w has an algebraic dependence on t_w, whose exponent contains the temperatures before and after the shift. The analytical expression is verified by numerical simulations. Marginal stability suggests that a positive temperature shift T → T' could erase the memory of the barrier b(t_w,T). The simulations show that the barrier b(t_w,T') ≥ b(t_w,T) controls the intermittent dynamics, whose rate is hence r_q ∝ 1 /t_w. Additional `rejuvenation' effects are also identified in the intermittency data for shifts of both signs. Comment: Revised introduction and discussion.
