5|$|Some ignorant clerics reject {{calculations}} {{of this kind}} (for shame!) and {{do not wish to}} keep their phylacteries, that is, they do not preserve the order, which they have received in the bosom of mother church, nor do they persist in the holy teaching of meditation. They should consider carefully the way of the Pharisees and the Sadducees, and they should spit out their doctrine like filth. A cleric ought to be the keeper of his own soul, just as a noble man subjects a young foal to the yoke, so he ought to subject his own soul to service, by filling the alabaster box with precious oil, that is, <b>he</b> <b>ought</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> inwardly subjected daily, by obeying the divine laws and admonitions of the Redeemer.|$|E
25|$|It is {{that single}} word “usual” that brings you up short {{and lets the}} poem fan out. It points {{not just to the}} {{regularity}} of Robinson’s own days and years but to the engulfing possibility of a thousand Robinsons out there, in the subway and on the streets, all ticking their lives away like his soundless watch. The poem, entitled “Aspects of Robinson,” is the portrait of the postwar man of affairs: neither laborer nor magnate, but holding steady—and, at first blush, looking purposeful—within the middle rank. He is everything that Weldon Kees dreaded, as well as everything that he suspected <b>he</b> <b>ought</b> <b>to</b> <b>be.</b>|$|E
25|$|Father Arkadii Ostal'sky {{was accused}} in 1922 of inciting the masses against the state. At his trial every witness refuted the charge, and the {{prosecution}} then argued that this number of witnesses was proof that the bishop was very popular and because he preached religion, which was harmful to the Soviet state, <b>he</b> <b>ought</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> condemned. He was sentenced to death, but this was commuted to ten years hard labour. After he returned early he was consecrated a bishop, but was then arrested and exiled to Solovki in 1931. He returned again in 1934 and then went into hiding, but he was caught and sent to another concentration camp. He was released shortly before the war broke out and was told by his camp administrator {{that he could have}} safety and job security if he agreed to remain {{in the area of the}} camps and give up the priesthood. He refused, and was then re-arrested and disappeared.|$|E

25|$|Thurman's {{involvement}} {{in identifying the}} fragment later proved controversial because of a 1997 report on the FBI Laboratory, unrelated to the PA 103 investigation, written by U.S. Inspector-General Michael Bromwich, which concluded that Thurman had altered lab reports in ways that had rendered them inaccurate, and that <b>he</b> <b>ought</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> transferred to a position outside the FBI lab (The Wall Street Journal, September 26, 1997). Thurman was not called to testify. Potentially also damaging to the Crown's case as presented at the trial, the testimony of Thurman's UK counterpart, DERA's Alan Feraday, has now been called into question. In three separate cases where Feraday had been the expert witness, men against whom he gave evidence have had their convictions overturned. And, thirdly, Dr Thomas Hayes was castigated for his failure to test the timer fragment for explosives residue, even though at the trial he maintained that the fragment {{was too small to}} test. Defence counsel contrasted Hayes' testimony with that of two of his colleagues (Elliott and Higgs) at DERA's forensic laboratory who, as revealed in the notorious Maguire Seven trial, had tested minute samples from underneath the fingernails of the suspects for explosives residue. In another important development, a retired senior Scottish police chief added fuel to the timer fragment fire by claiming that the CIA planted this crucial piece of evidence.|$|E

500|$|For {{the trials}} match between the Probables and the Possibles on 18 December 1910 at Colombes, Guillemin {{played for the}} Probables and was then {{selected}} for France. G. Neumeyer writing in la Culture physique, considered that the selectors had {{made the right choice}} of XV, with the exception of Guillemin. In his opinion, it was deplorable that he should be selected, noting his [...] "remarkable brutality", proof of which he demonstrated in the trials match, and that <b>he</b> <b>ought</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> thrown out of the national team for all time. Reichel in Le Figaro agreed that Guillemin's play was more violent than effective and would have preferred the selection of Berneron, who did [...] "great work" [...] for the Possibles.|$|E
500|$|Ford and Goebel both {{served in}} the U.S. Navy during World War II, and after the war, Ford urged Goebel to run for Congress against the incumbent, an isolationist named Barney Jonkman. Goebel {{declined}} to run, but suggested to Ford that, [...] "if you think <b>he</b> <b>ought</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> beaten, why don't you run?" [...] Ford did run for Congress in 1948, and Goebel {{was one of his}} close circle of early supporters, the original Ford-for-Congress group. Ford won the election and won re-election for twelve more terms. In 1960, Goebel was a leader in the movement to nominate Ford as the Vice Presidential candidate on the ticket with Richard Nixon, serving as Chairman of the [...] "Ford for Vice President Committee" [...] at the Republican National Convention in Chicago.|$|E
500|$|Some {{have been}} linked to his caustic {{criticism}} of George W. Bush's administration. [...] For instance, his frustration over the slow federal response to Hurricane Katrina led him to compare, at a Congressional Black Caucus town meeting in September 2005, Bush to Bull Connor, a 1960s symbol of white opposition to the civil rights movement, stating: [...] "George Bush is our Bull Connor." [...] He said a few days later that both figures had become focal points for American blacks to rally against. His first remark led to a public exchange with Vice President Dick Cheney, who said, [...] "I'm frankly surprised at his comments. It almost struck me — they were so out of line, it almost struck me that there was some — Charlie was having some problem. Charlie is losing it, I guess." [...] Rangel responded by saying, [...] "The fact that he would make a crack at my age, <b>he</b> <b>ought</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> ashamed of himself ...

500|$|In the House, as {{the session}} began at 4:30 pm, the Whig MP Henry Brougham, a leading {{opponent}} of the Orders, {{drew attention to the}} Prime Minister's absence and remarked that <b>he</b> <b>ought</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> there. A messenger was sent to fetch Perceval from Downing Street, but met him in Parliament Street (Perceval having decided to walk and dispense with his usual carriage) {{on his way to the}} House, where he arrived at about 5:15. As Perceval entered the lobby, he was confronted by Bellingham who, drawing a pistol, shot the Prime Minister in the chest. Perceval staggered forward a few steps and exclaimed [...] "I am murdered!" [...] before falling face down at the feet of William Smith, the MP for Norwich. (It was also variously reported Perceval had said [...] "Murder" [...] or [...] "Oh my God".) Smith only realised that the victim was Perceval when he turned the body face upwards. By the time he had been carried into an adjoining room and propped up on a table with his feet on two chairs, he was senseless, although there was still a faint pulse. When a surgeon arrived a few minutes later, the pulse had stopped, and Perceval was declared dead.|$|E
500|$|Trent's Last Case is an {{adaptation}} of British author E. C. Bentley's 1913 novel of the same name, which had already been adapted for cinema in England in 1920. Hawks considered the novel to be [...] "one of the greatest detective stories of all time" [...] and was eager to make it his first sound film. He cast Raymond Griffith in the lead role of Phillip Trent. Griffith's throat had been damaged by poison gas during World War I and his voice was a hoarse whisper, prompting Hawks to later state, [...] "I thought <b>he</b> <b>ought</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> great in talking pictures because of that voice." [...] However, after shooting only a few scenes, Fox shut Hawks down and ordered {{him to make a}} silent film, both because of Griffith's voice and because they only owned the legal rights to make a silent film. The film did have a musical score and synchronized sound effects, but no dialogue. Due to the failing business of silent films, it was never released in the US and only briefly screened in England where film critics hated it. The film was believed lost until the mid-1970s and was screened {{for the first time in}} the US at a Hawks retrospective in 1974. Hawks was in attendance of the screening and attempted to have the only print of the film destroyed.|$|E
500|$|Johnson {{told the}} United States Secret Service he rented the Hyatt hotel room at Adolf's request {{and that he}} {{believed}} [...] "without a doubt" [...] that Adolf came to Denver to kill Obama. According to a police affidavit, [...] "Johnson said the only reason for such killing would be because Obama is black." [...] During an August 25 interview with KCNC-TV, a CBS owned-and-operated television station in Denver, Johnson first denied being personally involved with the plot and, when asked whether he felt the men had serious plans {{to go through with}} the assassination, he said, [...] "Looking back at it, I don't want to say yes, but I don't want to say no." [...] Eventually, however, he admitted the other two men had planned a killing when he said, [...] "Yeah, they were here to do that, to assassinate him ... it's about as hard for me to swallow as it is for you to understand." [...] Johnson said the plan was for Adolf to, [...] "shoot Obama from a high vantage point using a [...] sighted at 750 yards". Johnson said the shooting was to take place during Obama's acceptance speech on August 28 at the Democratic National Convention in INVESCO Field at Mile High. Johnson told the station, [...] "He don't belong in political office. Blacks don't belong in political office. <b>He</b> <b>ought</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> shot." ...|$|E

500|$|Madness {{frequently}} discovers itself {{merely by}} unnecessary {{deviation from the}} usual mode of the world. My poor friend Smart shewed the disturbance of his mind, by falling upon his knees, and saying his prayers in the street, {{or in any other}} unusual place. Now although, rationally speaking, it is greater madness not to pray at all, than to pray as Smart did, I am afraid there are so many who do not pray, that their understanding is not called in question.Concerning this unfortunate poet, Christopher Smart, who was confined in a mad-house, he had, at another time, the following conversation with Dr [...] Burney:– Burney. 'How does poor Smart do, Sir; is he likely to recover?' Johnson. 'It seems as if his mind had ceased to struggle with the disease; for he grows fat upon it.' Burney. 'Perhaps, Sir, that may be from want of exercise.' Johnson. 'No, Sir; he has partly as much exercise as he used to have, for he digs in the garden. Indeed, before his confinement, he used for exercise to walk to the ale-house; but he was carried back again. I did not think <b>he</b> <b>ought</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> shut up. His infirmities are not noxious to society. He insisted on people praying with him; and I'd as lief pray with Kit [...] Smart as any one else. Another charge was that he did not love clean linen; and I have no passion for it.'– Johnson continued. 'Mankind have a great aversion to intellectual labour; but even supposing knowledge to be easily attainable, more people would be content to be ignorant than would take even a little trouble to acquire it.' ...|$|E
500|$|In his judgment, Justice T. S. Sinnathuray {{considered}} Schmidt v. Secretary of State for Home Affairs (1968), {{decided by}} the Court of Appeal of England and Wales. He found that the procedural principles that govern the administration of Singapore's immigration laws {{were similar to those}} in the UK. In Schmidt it was decided that an alien has no right to enter the country except by leave and the Home Secretary can refuse leave without giving any reason; that if an alien is given leave to enter the country for a limited period he has no right to stay, and no legitimate expectation of being allowed to stay, for a day longer than the permitted period; and that an alien's application for an extension of his stay can be refused without reasons and without a hearing as the rules of natural justice do not apply. Furthermore, in Schmidt Lord Denning had espoused the obiter view that where an alien's permit to stay [...] "is revoked before the time limit expires, <b>he</b> <b>ought...</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> given the opportunity of making representations: for he would have a legitimate expectation of being allowed to stay for a permitted time". This argument was advanced by Siah's counsel to persuade the court that [...] "an alien who is in possession of an entry permit which has not yet expired is in the country lawfully until the date of expiry and, therefore, he has an interest during the unexpired portion that carries with it a public law right to a fair procedure, if and when the minister desires to terminate that leave to stay prematurely". The High Court judge considered this proposition and conceded that it was an [...] "attractive" [...] one. However, he ultimately dismissed the argument by saying that it had [...] "not been supported by any English authority", and that the position in Singapore is [...] "quite different". He stated that Parliament had already provided in the Immigration Act for appeals and the right to be heard has been given statutory recognition and protection in the Act, and the applicant had already availed herself of the right to appeal. The Minister was not required to give reasons for his rejection of the appeal under the common law or the Immigration Act.|$|E
