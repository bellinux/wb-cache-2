500|$|Adams {{decided to}} focus on the game's {{development}} full-time during his first year of his math post-doctorate at Texas A in 2006. The university offered him $50,000 if he would stay another year. Adams agreed and commented on this, [...] "I woke up the morning after I gave notice, like, I can actually make this work." [...] Later, Adams expected he would use his $15,000 savings for a year and then <b>have</b> <b>to</b> <b>get</b> <b>a</b> job in order to support himself because the game had not been released yet.

500|$|When Powell was 17, {{her father}} died after a long battle with lung cancer. Before he died, he told her she would <b>have</b> <b>to</b> <b>get</b> <b>a</b> job to support her mother, {{and would not be}} able to go to art school. As her mother wanted her to receive an education, she rented out a room to four {{apprentice}} electricians. In September 1957, Powell gained a place at the Liverpool College of Art. Although studying graphics, she also took lettering classes, as did Lennon. He never had any drawing tools with him, so he constantly borrowed pens and pencils from Powell, who discovered he was only there because other teachers had refused to instruct him. She had an air of respectability and moved in different social circles than her future husband. Lennon and an art school friend, Geoff Mohammed, used to make fun of her by stopping the conversation when she walked in the room, saying: [...] "Quiet please! No dirty jokes; it's Cynthia." ...|$|E
2500|$|Dickson {{approached}} the five original members of The Byrds {{in order to}} have them sign a letter of permission to authorize the release of these early recordings. [...] David Crosby was initially reluctant to sanction the release but he was eventually persuaded by his friend and singing partner, Graham Nash, who convinced Crosby of the musical worth and historical value of the recordings. [...] Dickson later recalled Nash's involvement during a 1977 interview: [...] "Graham Nash said that the songs were charming baby pictures. You <b>have</b> <b>to</b> <b>get</b> <b>a</b> little older before you can tolerate seeing your baby pictures out there. We were all babies once! Graham just charmed David's socks off." [...] With the permission of all five original members of the band secured, Together Records released the album in July 1969 {{with a great deal of}} publicity. [...] As a collection of previously unreleased demo recordings, Preflyte can be seen as one of the earliest examples of issuing outtakes by popular artists, a practice that is now commonplace in the reissue market.|$|E

So much in America is based on religious fundamentalist Christianity. Grow up! This is the modern world!" [...] In 1992, Spin printed an article by Vedder, entitled [...] "Reclamation", which detailed his views on abortion.

2500|$|Starting as {{far back}} as at least 2000, the Mexican wrestling {{promotion}} [...] International Wrestling Revolution Group (IWRG; Sometimes referred to as Grupo Internacional Revolución in Spanish) has held several annual events where the main event was a multi-man steel cage match where the last wrestler left in the cage would be forced to either remove their wrestling mask or have their hair shaved off under Lucha de Apuestas, or [...] "bet match", rules. From 2012 IWRG has promoted a variation of the steel cage match under the moniker Prisión Fatal ("Deadly Prison") {{at least once a year}} since its inception. The Prisión Fatal has the added twist that each competitor is chained by the wrist to the cage with a long steel chain and to escape they fight <b>have</b> <b>to</b> <b>get</b> <b>a</b> key to unlock their chain before they are able to escape. The added chain helps to distinguish it from other Steel cage matches held through out the year such as the IWRG Guerra del Golfo ("Gulf War"), IWRG Guerra de Sexos ("War of the Sexes") or IWRG El Castillo del Terror ("The Tower of Terror") shows. The Prisión Fatal shows, as well as the majority of the IWRG shows in general, are held in [...] "Arena Naucalpan", owned by the promoters of IWRG and their main arena.

2500|$|In {{response}} {{a debate}} over banning gay and lesbian marriage occurred in the Minnesota Legislature. On the House floor Lindner claimed that allowing same-sex marriage would {{open the door to}} [...] "a man marrying a child or a man marrying a dog." [...] Openly gay State Rep. Karen Clark (whose partner, parents, and her partner's parents were attending the debate) expressed dismay at the comment. Lindner told her “I don't know why you felt that was insulting. I was trying to make a point, that we've got a norm of one man, one woman. Once we begin to deviate...what's to keep us from having to pass laws to allow a man to marry several women, or a man and a boy relationship -- and there [...] are people who would like to have that. When we start changing that definition of marriage, that does open up the door to others who will say 'Why not us?'” He told Clark that while he saw her as “one of God’s creations. ...I personally don't think the lifestyle you've chosen and other homosexuals have chosen is really good [...] for you, your partner or society. ...I'm talking in general, the HIV/AIDS problem, other diseases. It probably affects more homosexual men. ...I don't know of any [...] couple, where they've been faithful to each other, a man and a woman, has any fear of any sexually transmitted disease unless they <b>have</b> <b>to</b> <b>get</b> <b>a</b> blood transfusion. ...you're living in sin."
