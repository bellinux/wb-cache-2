Some advanced designs use fast neutrons produced by this second stage to ignite a third fast <b>fission</b> or <b>fusion</b> stage.The <b>fission</b> <b>bomb</b> and <b>fusion</b> fuel are placed near {{each other in a}} special radiation-reflecting container called a radiation case that is designed to contain x-rays for as long as possible.

25|$|In 1954, {{to explain}} the {{surprising}} amount of fission-product fallout produced by hydrogen bombs, Ralph Lapp coined the term fission-fusion-fission to describe a process inside {{what he called a}} three-stage thermonuclear weapon. His process explanation was correct, but his choice of terms caused confusion in the open literature. The stages of a nuclear weapon are not <b>fission,</b> <b>fusion,</b> and <b>fission.</b> They are the primary, the secondary, and, in a very few exceptional and powerful weapons no longer in service, the tertiary. Tertiary (three-stage) designs, such as the U.S. B41 nuclear bomb and the Soviet Tsar Bomba (discussed above), were developed in the late 1950s and early 1960s; all have since been retired, as the typical multi-megaton yields of tertiary bombs do not destroy targets efficiently, since they waste energy in a sphere above and below an area of land. For this reason, all tertiary bombs have given way in modern nuclear arsenals to multiple smaller two-stage bomb tactics (see for example, MIRV). Such two-stage bombs, even though less efficient in yield, are nevertheless more destructive for their total bomb weight, because they can be distributed over a roughly two-dimensional area of land at the target.|$|R

For these reasons, nuclear weapon design extensively utilizes D-T fusion 14.1 MeV neutrons to cause more <b>fission.</b> <b>Fusion</b> neutrons are able to cause fission in ordinarily non-fissile materials, such as depleted uranium (uranium-238), and these materials have been used in the jackets of thermonuclear weapons.

We propose a new algorithm for finding a minimum sequence of <b>Fissions,</b> <b>Fusions,</b> and Signed Re-versals that transforms a genome into another.

Thus a genome {{is a product of}} cycles instead of the usual representation as a set of mappings. By representing a chromosome as a cycle, rearrangement events like <b>fissions,</b> <b>fusions,</b> and signed reversals are performed in constant running time.

The functional versatility of the organelle is matched by its structural complexity, continuously remodelled by <b>fusion</b> and <b>fission</b> events controlled by “mitochondria-shaping” proteins. Several genetic diseases are associated with mutations in mitochondrial <b>fission</b> and <b>fusion</b> proteins, therefore underlining their importance in pathophysiology. So far, our knowledge of how the processes of mitochondrial <b>fusion</b> and <b>fission</b> occur in living cells is limited, since the size of the organelle and its subcompartments exceeds the resolution power of optical microscopy. In particular, very little is known of the molecular and biophysical details of the coordination of the processes of mitochondrial <b>fusion,</b> <b>fission</b> and apoptosis. Super-resolution microscopy like photoactivated light microscopy (PALM) can break the optical resolution barrier allowing in principle imaging of submitochondrial <b>fusion</b> and <b>fission</b> processes.

40|$|AbstractThe {{mitochondrial}} {{life cycle}} consists of frequent <b>fusion</b> and <b>fission</b> events. Ample experimental and clinical data demonstrate that inhibition of either <b>fusion</b> or <b>fission</b> results in deterioration of mitochondrial bioenergetics. While fusion may benefit mitochondrial function {{by allowing the}} spreading of metabolites, protein and DNA throughout the network, the functional benefit of fission is not as intuitive. Remarkably, studies that track individual mitochondria through <b>fusion</b> and <b>fission</b> found that the two events are paired and that <b>fusion</b> triggers <b>fission.</b> On average each mitochondrion would go though ~ 5 fusion:fission cycles every hour. Measurement of Δψm during single <b>fusion</b> and <b>fission</b> events demonstrates that fission may yield uneven daughter mitochondria where the depolarized daughter {{is less likely to}} become involved in a subsequent fusion and {{is more likely to be}} targeted by autophagy. Based on these observations we propose a mechanism by which the integration of mitochondrial <b>fusion,</b> <b>fission</b> and autophagy forms a quality maintenance mechanism. According to this hypothesis pairs of <b>fusion</b> and <b>fission</b> allow for the reorganization and sequestration of damaged mitochondrial components into daughter mitochondria that are segregated from the networking pool and then becoming eliminated by autophagy...|$|R
40|$|Neurons are metabolically active {{cells with}} high energy demands at {{locations}} {{distant from the}} cell body. As a result, these cells are particularly dependent on mitochondrial function, as reflected by the observation that diseases of mitochondrial dysfunction often have a neurodegenerative component. Recent discoveries have highlighted that neurons are reliant particularly on the dynamic properties of mitochondria. Mitochondria are dynamic organelles by several criteria. They engage in repeated cycles of <b>fusion</b> and <b>fission,</b> which serve to intermix the lipids and contents of a population of mitochondria. In addition, mitochondria are actively recruited to subcellular sites, such as the axonal and dendritic processes of neurons. Finally, {{the quality of a}} mitochondrial population is maintained through mitophagy, a form of autophagy in which defective mito-chondria are selectively degraded. We review the general features of mitochondrial dynamics, incorporating recent findings on mitochondrial <b>fusion,</b> <b>fission,</b> transport and mitophagy. Defects in these key features are associated with neurodegenerative disease. Charcot-Marie-Tooth type 2 A, a peripheral neuropathy, and dominant optic atrophy, an inherited optic neuropathy, result from a primary deficiency of mitochondrial fusion. Moreover, several major neurodegenerative diseases—including Parkinson’s, Alzheimer’s and Huntington’s disease—involve disruption of mitochondrial dynamics. Remarkably, in several disease models, the manipulation of mitochondrial <b>fusion</b> or <b>fission</b> can partially rescue disease phenotypes.
