25|$|Often in bleak moments do <b>I</b> <b>cast</b> back to Bob Barber's 185 {{in front}} of 40,000 on that sunny Friday in January 66. He batted without chance for five hours, {{starting}} decorously enough and then hitting the ball progressively harder and with a superb disdain to {{every corner of the}} field. One recalls the exceptional vigour of his driving and how he brought his wrists into the cut, making room for the stroke. It made blissful watching to English eyes – to one pair in particular, for by a wonderful chance father Barber had flown in from home that very day.|$|E
500|$|As Adams {{worked on}} the opera, {{he came to see}} Nixon, whom he had once {{intensely}} disliked, as an [...] "interesting character", a complicated individual who sometimes showed emotion in public. [...] Adams wanted Mao to be [...] "the Mao of the huge posters and Great Leap Forward; <b>I</b> <b>cast</b> him as a heldentenor". [...] Mao's wife, on the other hand, was to be [...] "not just a shrieking coloratura, but also someone who in the opera's final act can reveal her private fantasies, her erotic desires, and even a certain tragic awareness. [...] Nixon himself is a sort of Simon Boccanegra, a self-doubting, lyrical, at times self-pitying melancholy baritone." ...|$|E
500|$|David Fincher cast Ralph Brown as Francis Aaron, reuniting {{the actor}} with fellow Withnail and <b>I</b> <b>cast</b> member Paul McGann. In Alien Woman: The Making of Lt. Ellen Ripley, Jason Smith and Ximena Gallardo-C. {{consider}} Aaron's body language and overall reaction to Ellen Ripley's impregnation (his attention {{is drawn from}} the bio-scan to the Alien roaming the facility) as indicative of Ripley's own state of mind. In his [...] "Arrow in the Head" [...] review of Alien 3 on JoBlo.com, John Fallon praised Brown for playing the character in a manner reminiscent of Forrest Gump. Michael Nordine wrote in an LA Weekly article that although Aaron is a secondary character, his loyalty to Ripley and betrayal of Weyland-Yutani contradict his apparent company-orientation and lack of intelligence.|$|E

Rangel lost some of his {{traditional}} endorsements, but still retained others and campaigned hard even while turning 84 years of age. In the June 24 primary, voting was again close, but Rangel prevailed over Espaillat. Rangel faced no Republican opposition in the November general election and won it easily against a minor party candidate, saying as he voted on November 4, [...] "Today was a historic day and a very emotional day [...] <b>I</b> <b>cast</b> my final vote as a candidate on the ballot ..." ...|$|E
500|$|In 1999, Finch flew to Rwanda to help {{launch a}} new radio soap called Urunana, a {{programme}} which is aimed predominantly at women and focuses on health issues, child care and genocide within the country of Rwanda. A decade later, the makers of Urunana invited Finch to record a guest appearance as Ruth for the show. Ruth's scenes saw her married to a shopkeeper named Munyakazi, who was reluctant to let her train as a community health worker. Of the storyline, Finch said [...] "Although all this seemed not a little bizarre for strong-willed, independent Ruth, when <b>I</b> <b>cast</b> my mind back, it wasn't a million miles away from David's (my Archers husband of more than 20 years) reaction to having a female student arrive to work alongside him at Brookfield in 1987." ...|$|E
500|$|Bach {{composed}} his cantata {{as part of}} {{his application}} for the position of [...] in Leipzig, the official title being [...] (Cantor and Director of Music). As cantor, he was responsible for the music at four Lutheran churches, the main churches Thomaskirche (St. Thomas) and the Nikolaikirche (St. Nicholas), but also the Neue Kirche (New Church) and the Peterskirche (St. Peter). As director of music, the Thomaskantor was Leipzig's [...] "senior musician", responsible for the music on official occasions such as town council elections and homages. Functions related to the university took place at the Paulinerkirche. The position became vacant when Johann Kuhnau died on 5 June 1722. Bach was interested, mentioning as one reason that he saw more possibilities for future academic studies of his sons in Leipzig: [...] "...but this post was described to me in such favorable terms that finally (particularly since my sons seemed inclined to [...] studies) <b>I</b> <b>cast</b> my lot, {{in the name of the}} Lord, and made my journey to Leipzig, took my examination, and then made the change of position." ...|$|E

500|$|Despite her {{recollections}} of a pleasant early childhood, Hügel-Marshall was {{singled out for}} her skin colour. Growing up, she faced constant racism and was referred to by the local community as a Negermischling; Mischling was the term used by the Nazis to designate [...] "mixed" [...] children (with a Jewish and a non-Jewish parent). In 1952, when {{she was ready to}} start school, her mother was forced by social services to send her to the orphanage God's Little Cabin Children's Home. She lived there {{for the rest of her}} childhood, despite promises that it was only temporary, that she would only be there for six weeks. At the home, she endured mental and physical abuse from both adults and children. This included being shouted at to stop crying for her mother, being force-fed her own vomit, and undergoing an exorcism, during which she was blindfolded and forced to repeat such phrases as [...] "Satan, <b>I</b> <b>cast</b> you out" [...] and [...] "Lord Jesus, purify my black soul." [...] She was allowed to go home for summer vacations; she never told her family about her bad experiences at the children's home.|$|E
500|$|Raleigh's {{commanding}} officer. On selecting Elba, del Toro stated: [...] "This is a {{movie where}} I have {{had to deal with}} more dialogue than ever, and the way <b>I</b> <b>cast</b> the movie was—who do I want to hear say these things? Who do I want Charlie Hunnam to go against? Who can really tell Charlie Hunnam 'sit down and listen'?" [...] In another interview, the director said: [...] "I wanted to have Idris not be the blonde, square-jawed, Anglo, super hip marine that knows [...] I wanted somebody that could bring a lot of authority, but that you could feel {{the weight of the world}} on his shoulders. When I watched Luther, that's the essence of the character… Luther is carrying literally the evils of the world on his shoulders. He's doing penance for all humanity… Idris is one of those actors that is capable of embodying humanity, in almost like a Rodin sculpture-type, larger than life, almost like a Russian realism statue, you know, big hands, all the turmoil of humanity in his eyes. I wanted somebody that you could have doubts internally, and very few guys can do that." [...] To prepare for the role, Elba watched footage of politicians David Cameron and Barack Obama, as well as Russell Crowe in Gladiator and Mel Gibson in Braveheart. Del Toro initially offered the role to Tom Cruise, who declined because of scheduling conflicts.|$|E

2500|$|Another Midrash {{played on}} two {{possible}} {{meanings of the}} second word of [...] , eikev, [...] "as a consequence" [...] and [...] "heel." [...] The Midrash interpreted the words [...] "upon Edom <b>I</b> <b>cast</b> my shoe" [...] in [...] and [...] to mean that God says that when Israel repents, then God will tread with God's heel, so to speak, on Israel's enemy Edom. And the Midrash taught, {{in the words of}} [...] that [...] "it shall come to pass, because (eikev) you hearken." ...|$|E
2500|$|The Rabbis {{taught that}} through the word [...] "this," [...] Aaron became degraded, as it is said in [...] "And Aaron said: ‘[...] [...] <b>I</b> <b>cast</b> it into the fire, and there came out this calf,'" [...] and through the word [...] "this," [...] Aaron was also elevated, as it is said in [...] "This is the {{offering}} of Aaron and of his sons, which they shall offer to the Lord on {{the day when he}} is anointed" [...] to become High Priest.|$|E
2500|$|Although the Idumaeans {{controlled}} the lands {{to the east}} and south of the Dead Sea, their peoples were held in contempt by the Israelites. Hence the Book of Psalms says [...] "Moab is my washpot: over Edom will <b>I</b> <b>cast</b> out my shoe." [...] According to the Torah, the congregation could not receive descendants of a marriage between an Israelite and an Edomite until the fourth generation. This law was a subject of controversy between Shimon ben Yohai, who said it applied only to male descendants, and other Tannaim, who said female descendants were also excluded for four generations. From these, some early conversion laws in halacha were derived.|$|E

2500|$|The film {{significantly}} {{differs from}} all other adaptations of Ramayana in the characterisation of the central characters, including Rama and Lakshmana. The characters are humanised, contrary to the way divine characters from Indian mythology are usually depicted in visual media. Rama has a pot belly, while Lakshmana has pockmarks on his face. In an interview, Aravindan stated, [...] "Our sculptures are large in size and exude strength and vitality, which is absent in murals. The Rama of Kanchana Sita exudes the strength and vitality of our sculptures. He {{is not just a}} plain frontal image. The wandering tribals we encounter here and there with their medicines also share this quality. I enquired and found that these people are settled in villages near the Godavari River. Apart from this they also believe that they belong to the same race. That is why <b>I</b> <b>cast</b> two of them in my film." ...|$|E
2500|$|On {{nearing the}} Cocos (Keeling) Islands, Slocum noted [...] "I didn't touch the helm, for {{with the current}} and heave of the sea the sloop found herself {{at the end of}} the run {{absolutely}} in the fairway of the channel. ... Then I trimmed her sails by the wind, took the helm, and flogged her up the couple of miles or so abreast the harbour landing, where <b>I</b> <b>cast</b> anchor at 3.30 pm, July 17, 1897, twenty-three days from Thursday Island. The distance run was twenty-seven hundred miles as the crow flies. ... During those twenty-three days I had not spent altogether more than three hours at the helm, including the time occupied in beating into Keeling harbour. I just lashed the helm and let her go; whether the wind was abeam or dead aft, it was all the same: she always stayed on her course." ...|$|E
2500|$|Gans {{said that}} casting of Mitchell {{as the lead}} for the film is [...] "a matter of feeling. If you play Silent Hill you know that each {{character}} has a very special poetic quality. They are both twisted and sophisticated. We tried to {{keep that in mind}} when we did the casting on this film." [...] Bean's role in the film was originally kept to {{the beginning and the end}} of the movie, but due to studio pressure for a male lead, his role was expanded into a subplot. Gans cast Holden after seeing her in The Majestic: [...] "in The Majestic, she was beautifully feminine and <b>I</b> <b>cast</b> her so I could show her other side, make her strong and sleek. Gans saw Ferland as [...] "the ideal actress" [...] after viewing the television show Kingdom Hospital and her screen test for Terry Gilliam's film Tideland. To prepare for her role, Krige read the book The End of Days by Erna Paris, a book about tyranny during the Spanish Inquisition.|$|E

2500|$|A Midrash {{explained}} that Israel sinned with fire {{in making the}} Golden Calf, as [...] says, [...] "And <b>I</b> <b>cast</b> it into the fire, and there came out this calf."

[...] The Midrash taught that Bezalel was the smith whom God had created to address the fire. And the Midrash likened it to the case of a doctor's disciple who applied a plaster to a wound and healed it. When people began to praise him, his teacher, the doctor, said that they should praise the doctor, for he taught the disciple. Similarly, when everybody said that Bezalel had constructed the Tabernacle through his knowledge and understanding, God said that it was God who created him and taught him, as [...] says, [...] "Behold, I have created the smith."
