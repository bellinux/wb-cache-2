After the Chinese had invented gunpowder, they began adapting its <b>explosive</b> <b>properties</b> for use in military technology.

25|$|TNT {{was first}} {{prepared}} in 1863 by German chemist Julius Wilbrand and originally {{used as a}} yellow dye. Its potential as an explosive was not appreciated for several years, mainly {{because it was so}} difficult to detonate and because it was less powerful than alternatives. Its <b>explosive</b> <b>properties</b> were first discovered by another German chemist, Carl Häussermann, in 1891. TNT can be safely poured when liquid into shell cases, and is so insensitive that it was exempted from the UK's Explosives Act 1875 and was not considered an explosive for the purposes of manufacture and storage.|$|E
500|$|Liquid sodium {{is used as}} a heat {{transfer}} fluid in some types of nuclear reactors because it has the high thermal conductivity and low neutron absorption cross section required to achieve a high neutron flux in the reactor. The high boiling point of sodium allows the reactor to operate at ambient (normal) pressure, but the drawbacks include its opacity, which hinders visual maintenance, and its <b>explosive</b> <b>properties.</b> Radioactive sodium-24 may be produced by neutron bombardment during operation, posing a slight radiation hazard; the radioactivity stops within a few days after removal from the reactor. If a reactor needs to be shut down frequently, NaK is used; because NaK is a liquid at room temperature, the coolant does not solidify in the pipes. In this case, the pyrophoricity of potassium requires extra precautions to prevent and detect leaks. [...] Another {{heat transfer}} application is poppet valves in high-performance internal combustion engines; the valve stems are partially filled with sodium and work as a heat pipe to cool the valves.|$|E

40|$|One of {{the typical}} {{problems}} of Natural Language Processing (NLP) is the <b>explosive</b> <b>property</b> of the parser and this is aggravated in an Intelligent Language Tutoring System (ILTS) because the grammar is unconstrained and admits even more analyses. NLP applications frequently incorporate techniques for selecting a preferred parse. Computational criteria, however, are insufficient for a pedagogic system because the parse chosen will possibly result in misleading feedback for the learner. Preferably, the analysis emphasizes language teaching pedagogy by selecting the sentence i. nterpretation a student most likely intended. In the system described in this paper, several modules are responsible for selecting the appropriate analysis and these are informed by the Student Model.

2500|$|A third {{step was}} the {{structure}} elucidation of organic substances: although the elemental composition of pure organic substances (irrespective {{of whether they}} were of natural or synthetic origin) could be determined fairly accurately, the molecular structure was still a problem. The urge to do structural elucidation resulted from a dispute between Friedrich Wöhler and Justus von Liebig, who both studied a silver salt of the same composition but had different properties. Wöhler studied silver cyanate, a harmless substance, while von Liebig investigated silver fulminate, a salt with <b>explosive</b> <b>properties.</b> The elemental analysis shows that both salts contain equal quantities of silver, carbon, oxygen and nitrogen. According to the then prevailing ideas, both substances should possess the same properties, {{but this was not}} the case. This apparent contradiction was later solved by Berzelius's theory of isomers, whereby not only the number and type of elements are of importance to the properties and chemical reactivity, but also the position of atoms in within a compound. This was a direct cause for the development of structure theories, such as the radical theory of Jean-Baptiste Dumas and the substitution theory of Auguste Laurent. [...] However, it took until 1858 before by August Kekulé formulated a definite structure theory. He posited that carbon tetravalent ad can bind itself to carbon chains as they occur in natural products.|$|E

60|$|It may {{be thought}} that this form of {{causation}} requires us to admit {{an exception to the}} doctrine that the conditions of a phenomenon—the antecedents required for calling it into existence—must all be found among the facts immediately, not remotely, preceding its commencement. But what we have arrived at is not a correction, it is only an explanation, of that doctrine. In the enumeration of the conditions required for the occurrence of any phenomenon, it always has to be included that objects must be present, possessed of given properties. It is a condition of the phenomenon explosion that an object should be present, of one or other of certain kinds, which for that reason are called explosive. The presence of one of these objects is a condition immediately precedent to the explosion. The condition which is not immediately precedent is the cause which produced, not the explosion, but the <b>explosive</b> <b>property.</b> The conditions of the explosion itself were all present immediately before it took place, and the general law, therefore, remains intact.|$|R

40|$|The {{detonation}} of a condensed explosive {{within a}} solid container and the detonation of a gaseous explosive within an inert‐gas boundary {{are found to}} be hydrodynamically similar situations. Experiments with hydrogen, methane, ethane, and propane‐oxygen mixtures confined by air or helium boundaries show that, as with condensed <b>explosives,</b> the <b>properties</b> of the boundary strongly influence the detonation characteristics of the explosive. Schlieren photographs of the interaction process between a gaseous detonation wave and an inert‐compressible‐gas boundary show that the detonation wave becomes curved, and in some cases is quenched, the quenching process being initiated at the compressible boundary. Either oblique or detached shocks are found to occur in the boundary. These observations parallel those made from experiments in which condensed explosives were confined by solid boundaries. With the use of an idealized‐flow model, the acoustic‐impedance ratio of the gaseous boundary to the explosive is determined to be the parameter which characterizes the confining ability of the boundary. Application of these results to condensed‐explosive detonations provides an understanding of some experimentally observed phenomen...|$|R
40|$|Thesis (MTech (Chemical Engineering)) [...] Cape Peninsula University of Technology, 2012. Emulsion {{explosives}} {{are classified}} as highly concentrated Water-in-Oil emulsions with an internal phase volume fraction of approximately 94 %, i. e. far beyond the close packing limit of spherical droplets of 74 %. These emulsions are thermodynamically unstable compounds and their instability {{is related to the}} crystallisation in the dispersed phase, which is a supersaturated solution of ammonium nitrate salt in water. This presents a problem, because the emulsion weakens or becomes unstable, which results in droplet crystallisation, so that the explosive generally loses at least some of its sensitivity to detonation. Considerable effort has been applied to the improvement of emulsion stability by explosive manufacturers, but important aspects such as the effect of salt and surfactant content/type in emulsions are not fully understood and described in the literature. The {{purpose of this study was}} to investigate these shortcomings and to focus on the effect of surfactant nature and concentration and electrolyte concentration/type on the interfacial properties and interactions in emulsion <b>explosives.</b> Interfacial <b>properties</b> (interfacial tension and interfacial elasticity), thermal behaviour (freezing temperatures) of emulsions and rheological aspects (viscoelastic and flow properties) were investigated in terms of surfactant-electrolyte interactions...|$|R
