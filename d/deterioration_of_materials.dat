50|$|There can be {{numerous}} {{causes of}} leaks. Leaks can occur {{from the outset}} even during construction or initial manufacture/assembly of fluid systems. Pipes, tubing, valves, fittings, or other components may be improperly joined or welded together. Components with threads may be improperly screwed together. Leaks {{can be caused by}} damage; for example, punctures or fracture. Often leaks are the result of <b>deterioration</b> <b>of</b> <b>materials</b> from wear or aging, such as rusting or other corrosion or decomposition of elastomers or similar polymer materials used as gaskets or other seals. For example, wearing out of faucet washers causes water to leak at the faucets. Cracks may result from either outright damage, or wearing out by stress such as fatigue failure or corrosion such as stress corrosion cracking. Wearing out of a surface between a disk and its seat in a valve could cause a leak between ports (valve inlets or outlets). Wearing out of packing around a turning valve stem or rotating centrifugal pump shaft could develop into fluid outleakage into the environment. For some frequently operating centrifugal pumps, such leakage is so expected that provisions are made for carrying away the leakage. Similarly, wearing out of seals or packing around piston-driven pumps could also develop into outleakage to the environment.|$|E

Deterioration mechanisms are specific for different groups of materials, for different types of pollution and their combinations. The definition of a generally valid critical level for all materials together on the base of scientific knowledge is therefore impossible.

Furthermore, many commercial chemicals are used on farmlands, grain and silage preservatives, pests and weed control, and as proprietary acid solutions for cleaning dairy equipment.

40|$|How to {{suppress}} the performance <b>deterioration</b> <b>of</b> thermoelectric <b>materials</b> in the intrinsic excitation region remains a key challenge. The magnetic transition of permanent magnet nanoparticles from ferromagnetism to paramagnetism provides an effective approach to finding {{the solution to this}} challenge. Here, we have designed and prepared magnetic nanocomposite thermoelectric <b>materials</b> consisting <b>of</b> BaFe 12 O 19 nanoparticles and Ba 0. 3 In 0. 3 Co 4 Sb 12 matrix.

BaFe 12 O 19 nanoparticles trap electrons below the Curie temperature (TC) and release the trapped electrons above the TC, playing an ‘electron repository’ role in maintaining high figure of merit ZT. BaFe 12 O 19 nanoparticles produce two types of magnetoelectric effect—electron spiral motion and magnon-drag thermopower—as well as enhancing phonon scattering.

50|$|Once begun, PD causes {{progressive}} <b>deterioration</b> <b>of</b> insulating <b>materials,</b> ultimately {{leading to}} electrical breakdown. The effects of PD within high voltage cables and equipment {{can be very}} serious, ultimately leading to complete failure. The cumulative effect of partial discharges within solid dielectrics is the formation of numerous, branching partially conducting discharge channels, a process called treeing. Repetitive discharge events cause irreversible mechanical and chemical <b>deterioration</b> <b>of</b> the insulating <b>material.</b> Damage {{is caused by the}} energy dissipated by high energy electrons or ions, ultraviolet light from the discharges, ozone attacking the void walls, and cracking as the chemical breakdown processes liberate gases at high pressure. The chemical transformation of the dielectric also tends to increase the electrical conductivity <b>of</b> the dielectric <b>material</b> surrounding the voids. This increases the electrical stress in the (thus far) unaffected gap region, accelerating the breakdown process. A number of inorganic dielectrics, including glass, porcelain, and mica, are significantly more resistant to PD damage than organic and polymer dielectrics.|$|R
