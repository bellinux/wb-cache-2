40|$|This study aims to {{show the}} {{direction}} of causalities between <b>imported</b> <b>production</b> goods (investment and intermediate) and foreign exchange rate, export, and gross national product, between export and gross national product (GNP) during import substitution and export oriented industrialization periods in Turkey, and the direction of causalities between the domestic or foreign terms of trade (FTOT), realized foreign direct investment and GNP, export, and <b>imported</b> <b>production</b> goods during the 1982 - 2004 period. It discusses associations and controversies between theoretical statements and real world with the aims of economic policies. The <b>imported</b> <b>production</b> good {{is one of the}} causal sources of GNP for the both periods. Export causes <b>production</b> good <b>import</b> change during the import substitution period, but the <b>imported</b> <b>production</b> goods supply causes export to increase during export oriented industrialization period. Foreign exchange rate causes <b>imported</b> <b>production</b> goods to change during import substitution period, but the direction of causality exists adversely during export oriented industrialization period. The foreign exchange rate directs export, export directs GNP, and GNP directs the foreign exchange rates after 1980. The foreign TOT (terms of trade) and realized foreign direct investment inflow into Turkey are not causal sources for the changes in gross national product and <b>production</b> goods <b>import.</b> Direction of causations, growth related policy variables, Turkish Economy. ...|$|R

Conversely, the economy {{in which the government}} finances endogenous public spending and transfers with fixed tariff rates is immune to indeterminacy. ...|$|R

Although production declined to 4.2 million tons in 1985, China was still by far the largest cotton producer in the world.
