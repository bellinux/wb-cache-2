5|$|The frailty of the {{argument}} is that <b>it</b> <b>implies</b> that God, a being which does not suffer from transworld depravity by the assumption of omnibenevolence, is unable to recreate a transworld-depravity-free being, which is seemingly contradictory to the assumption of omnipotence.|$|E
5|$|The Sandilya Upanishad lists ten forbearances: Ahimsa, Satya, Asteya, Brahmacharya, Daya, Arjava, Kshama, Dhriti, Mitahara and Saucha. According to Kaneda, {{the term}} Ahimsa is an {{important}} spiritual doctrine shared by Hinduism, Buddhism and Jainism. It literally means 'non-injury' and 'non-killing'. <b>It</b> <b>implies</b> the total avoidance of harming {{of any kind of}} living creatures not only by deeds, but also by words and in thoughts.|$|E
5|$|A {{limitation}} of the radial velocity method used to discover 55 Cancri d is that only a lower limit on the planet's mass can be obtained. In the case of 55 Cancri d, this lower limit was around 3.835 times the mass of Jupiter. In 2004, astrometric measurements with the Fine Guidance Sensors on the Hubble Space Telescope suggest that the planet's orbit is inclined by around 53° {{with respect to the}} plane of the sky. If this measurement is confirmed, <b>it</b> <b>implies</b> that the planet's true mass is 25% greater than the lower limit, at around 4.8 Jupiter masses; and it will not be coplanar with the innermost planets e and b (both 85°).|$|E

50|$|The {{concept of}} anxiety {{sensitivity}} expressed two ideas. First, <b>it</b> <b>implied</b> that {{the fear of}} fear is at least sometimes rooted in cognition or beliefs, not Pavlovian associations with prior panic experiences. Second, <b>it</b> <b>implied</b> that the fear of fear could precede panic experiences and even predict panic attacks, post-traumatic stress, phobias, and other anxiety conditions.|$|R
30|$|The charts {{generated}} {{were examined}} {{to see which}} boundary was crossed. If the upper boundary was crossed, <b>it</b> <b>implied</b> that knees with anterolateral incision were preferred by the patients. If the lower boundary was crossed, <b>it</b> <b>implied</b> that knees with midline incision were preferred. If none of the two boundaries were crossed, <b>it</b> <b>implied</b> that patients did not prefer any one knee over the other. This method allowed us to conclude the trial {{as soon as the}} boundary was crossed. The upper boundary was crossed after charting the preferences of 19 patients; however, at that point the last patient was already recruited and so was allowed to complete the trial.|$|R
5|$|Bede {{described}} Aldfrith as a scholar, and {{his interest}} in learning distinguishes him from the earlier Anglo-Saxon warrior kings, such as Penda. Irish sources describe him as a sapiens, a term from the Latin for wise that refers to a scholar not usually associated with a particular church. <b>It</b> <b>implies</b> a degree of learning and wisdom that led historian Peter Hunter Blair to compare Aldfrith to the Platonic ideal of the philosopher king. Bede also {{makes it clear that}} the church in Aldfrith's day was less subject to lay control of monasteries, a practice he dated from the time of Aldfrith's death.|$|E
5|$|Comparisons {{with the}} finds from the {{salvaged}} Mary Rose itself have {{provided an opportunity}} to compare {{the accuracy of the}} records provided in the Roll. The picture of the ship has provided clues about basic structural features, such as the number of masts and sails. When compared with an inventory of the ship from 1514, there is a close match, proving the illustration to be largely accurate. Examination of details in the construction, however, reveals that Anthony allowed himself some artistic licence. The armament in the painted ship appears clearly exaggerated. The heavy stern chasers (cannon placed in the stern aimed backwards) mounted through gun ports on the orlop deck, just about the waterline, would not have been feasible {{because of the lack of}} an orlop deck and the steep angle (sheer) of the ship in this area. The number of gunports in the broadside is inaccurate since <b>it</b> <b>implies</b> two slightly staggered rows of nine ports while the surviving starboard side of the Mary Rose has only one row of gunports on the main deck with seven ports. The accuracy of the forecastle has been more difficult to ascertain since none of it remains; conflicting interpretations of what it looked like have been suggested.|$|E
5|$|Einstein's {{theory has}} {{important}} astrophysical implications. For example, <b>it</b> <b>implies</b> {{the existence of}} black holes—regions of space in which space and time are distorted {{in such a way}} that nothing, not even light, can escape—as an end-state for massive stars. There is ample evidence that the intense radiation emitted by certain kinds of astronomical objects is due to black holes; for example, microquasars and active galactic nuclei result from the presence of stellar black holes and supermassive black holes, respectively. The bending of light by gravity can lead to the phenomenon of gravitational lensing, in which multiple images of the same distant astronomical object are visible in the sky. General relativity also predicts the existence of gravitational waves, which have since been observed directly by physics collaboration LIGO. In addition, general relativity is the basis of current cosmological models of a consistently expanding universe.|$|E

5|$|The Roda Codex, {{the sole}} source for Onneca's Christian marriage, places this union with her cousin Aznar Sánchez de Laron before her marriage, as a widow, to Abdullah of Córdoba. Based on this, French {{historian}} Évariste Lévi-Provençal developed a chronology for Onneca's life that placed her birth date around 835. Lévi-Provençal believed that Onneca did not accompany her {{father when he}} returned to Pamplona in 882, either because she had already died, or because she had converted to Islam and chose to remain in Abdullah's harem. However, such a chronology is problematic since <b>it</b> <b>implies</b> that Onneca's children by Aznar were born before or only shortly after her father's capture in 860, thus making Onneca's daughter Toda Aznárez a sexagenarian {{at the time of her}} son García Sánchez I's birth (which is known to have occurred in either 919 or 922), and nearly a centenarian at the time of her 958 visit to Cordoba. Therefore, most historians addressing the question have concluded that the Roda Codex was in error with regard to the order of Onneca's two marriages.|$|E
