The Church of the Living God, the Pillar Ground of Truth for All Nations is the oldest-known Black Hebrew group and the Church of God and Saints of Christ {{is one of the}} largest Black Hebrew organizations. The Commandment Keepers, founded by Wentworth Arthur Matthew <b>in</b> <b>New</b> <b>York,</b> <b>are</b> noted for their adherence to traditional Judaism.

5|$|Not {{far from}} CR39, the route enters the hamlet of West Conesville, another small {{community}} built up around NY990V's junction with CR59 (Bull Hill Road). The road continues northeastward from West Conesville, serving {{a handful of}} scattered homes separated by stretches of woodland and open fields. This sparsely developed section along the northern bank of Manor Kill ultimately leads to the hamlet of Conesville, located at an intersection with CR18 (Bear Kill Road). NY990V ends at the junction, and its right-of-way continues east toward NY145 in Durham as CR3 (Potter Mountain Road). Reference routes <b>in</b> <b>New</b> <b>York</b> <b>are</b> typically not signed with touring route markers, as most are short connector roads or are known by other, more prominent names. NY990V, however, is fully signed as a touring route.|$|E

25|$|In New York, a town is a {{municipal}} corporation, {{which is the}} major division of each county (excluding the five counties that comprise New York City), very similar to townships in other states such as Pennsylvania, Ohio, and Indiana. Towns <b>in</b> <b>New</b> <b>York</b> <b>are</b> classified by the U.S. Census Bureau as minor civil divisions. As in most Northeastern states, every square foot of New York is incorporated; all residents who {{do not live in}} a city or on an Indian reservation live in a town. Towns provide or arrange for the primary functions of local government. While some provide most municipal services for all town residents and selected services for residents of villages, some provide little more than road maintenance. There are 932 towns in New York. As of 2000, 45.8% of state residents were living in a town; 35.9% were living in a town but outside of a village. Whereas cities and villages can cross county boundaries, all towns <b>in</b> <b>New</b> <b>York</b> <b>are</b> within a single county.|$|E

25|$|In New York, {{each city}} is a highly {{autonomous}} incorporated area that, with the exceptions of New York City and Geneva, is contained within one county. Cities <b>in</b> <b>New</b> <b>York</b> <b>are</b> classified by the U.S. Census Bureau as incorporated places. They provide almost all services to their residents and have the highest degree of home rule and taxing jurisdiction over their residents. The main difference between a city and a village is that cities are organized and governed according to their charters, which can differ widely among cities, while most villages are subject to a uniform statewide Village Law (twelve villages still operate under charters issued by the state legislature prior to a revision of the State Constitution in 1874 that forbade chartering villages). Also, villages {{are part of a}} town (or towns; some villages cross town borders), with residents who pay taxes to and receive services from the town. Cities are neither part of nor subordinate to towns except for the city of Sherrill, which for some purposes is treated {{as if it were a}} village of the town of Vernon. Some cities are completely surrounded by a town, typically of the same name.|$|E
500|$|New York State Route990V (NY990V) is an east–west {{reference}} {{route in}} Schoharie County, New York, in the United States.

Reference routes <b>in</b> <b>New</b> <b>York</b> <b>are</b> typically unsigned; however, NY990V is fully signed with touring route markers. The road is a remnant of New York State Route342, a route assigned as part of the 1930 renumbering of state highways in New York. The NY342 designation was removed in the late 1940s; however, its former routing from Gilboa to Conesville remained a state highway and became NY990V when the modern reference route system in New York was created.|$|E
