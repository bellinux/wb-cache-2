40|$|The {{ball milling}} of Fe- 24 Mn and Fe- 24 Mn- 6 Si mixed powders has been {{performed}} by the {{high energy ball milling}} technique. By employing X-ray diffraction and Mossbauer measurements, the composition evolution during the milling process has been investigated. The results indicate the formation of paramagnetic Fe-Mn or Fe-Mn-Si alloys with a metastable fee phase as final products, which imply that the Fe and Mn proceed a co-diffusion mechanism through the surface of <b>fragmented</b> <b>powders.</b> The thermal stability and composition evolution of the as-milled alloys were discussed comparing with the bulk alloy.

40|$|AbstractThis paper {{presents}} {{a method for}} automatic identification of Herbal Plants Licorice and Rhubarb by microscopic image processing. This method is useful for identifying species from <b>fragments</b> or <b>powders</b> and for distinguishing species with similar morphological characteristics. In first step, desired region of the image is cropped by intensity based segmentation. After that Hu's moments and compactness parameters are calculated for cropped part which are rotational, scaling and shift invariant. In the final stage using SVM classifier, classify the herbal plants of licorice and rhubarb. Area under the ROC curve for licorice is 0. 7051 and for rhubarb it is 0. 9487...|$|R
40|$|Avian eggshell {{fragments}} {{recovered from}} both paleontological and archaeological deposits contain {{a cache of}} well-preserved ancient DNA. Here, we describe an extraction protocol that has been optimized to maximize the recovery of ancient DNA from fossil eggshell and minimize the co-purification of PCR inhibitors. In this method, fossil eggshell <b>fragments</b> are <b>powdered,</b> then digested and heated to release DNA from the calcite matrix. The digest then undergoes a concentration step before purification and washing using silica columns. The method {{has been used to}} recover aDNA from the eggshell of many avian species including moa, elephant birds, and emu, up to 19, 000 years old...|$|R
40|$|The {{focus of}} the study {{presented}} in this paper is to provide reliable criteria {{that can be used to}} estimate the degree of compatibility between the French limestone tuffeau and mortar. It is suggested through this study to use the same parent material (i. e., tuffeau) as mortar. The mortar used in this study is composed of non-hydraulic (hydrated) lime or hydraulic lime and aggregates obtained from <b>fragments</b> and <b>powder</b> of the tuffeau stone. Water transfer properties and mechanical behaviour of the mortars are evaluated and compared with the original stone Tuffeau. Based on these studies, some key guidelines are provided such that a mortar that is compatible with properties of Tuffeau and can be prepared and used as construction material of monuments and maintenance purposes.

40|$|A cube-like {{fragment}} with an approximately 4 mm edge {{was taken}} from the Yamato- 74659 meteorite for the mineralogical and crystallographic examination discussed in the present paper. An analysis of <b>powdered</b> <b>fragments</b> by a standard wet chemical method showed that it matched to weathered ureilite. The chemical composition was found to differ from other ureilites in that the FeO content (8. 83 wt%) is the lowest among known ureilites and it is richer in SiO 2 contents (42. 91 wt%) ...|$|R
50|$|The {{revolving}} cylinder design, while popular with pistols, {{did not work}} well for rifles. The cylinder would spray out burning powder when the weapon was fired. This {{was not a problem}} for pistols, as both hands were behind the cylinder when firing. In the rifle version, though, the shooter's left hand was in front of the cylinder, resulting in the burning <b>powder</b> <b>fragments</b> being sprayed into the shooter's left forearm at high velocity. This undesirable characteristic significantly limited the revolving rifle's popularity.|$|R
40|$|Two bronze sculptures, Ettore e Andromaca, a {{reproduction}} of a plaster model by Giorgio de Chirico, and Cardinale, a cast made from an original by Giacomo Manzù, stand outside the Carlo Bilotti contemporary art museum in Villa Borghese park (Rome). The composition of the artificial brown patina present on the statues’ surface, which was applied for aesthetic purposes, is unknown. This paper reports analysis carried out to identify {{the composition of the}} artificial patina and describe the corrosion products formed in outdoor conditions. Raman spectroscopy and scanning electron microscopy equipped with X-ray microanalysis were performed on sample <b>fragments</b> and <b>powder</b> scrapings taken from the bronze statues. X-ray powder diffraction was used whenever possible and subject to conservation priorities. Our data revealed, in the artificial brown patina, the formation of copper oxides (cuprite and tenorite) on the surface of both sculptures as possible result of oxidisation treatments performed with a blowtorch before the artificial patination process began. Furthermore, a copper nitrate (gerhardtite) was identified as an ingredient in the preparation applied to the bronze surfaces. The green areas revealed the presence of corrosion products as copper sulphate hydroxide (brochantite) and copper sulphate-chloride (connellite), which form under acid rains conditions...|$|R
50|$|The {{material}} may be solid, liquid, gas, {{material of}} some intermediate {{characteristics such as}} gel or sputum, tissue, organisms, {{or a combination of}} these. Even if a material sample is not countable as individual items, the quantity of the sample may still be describable in terms of its volume, mass, size, or other such dimensions. A solid sample can come in one or a few discrete pieces, or can be <b>fragmented,</b> granular, or <b>powdered.</b> A section of a rod, wire, cord, sheeting, or tubing may be considered a sample. Samples which are not a solid piece are commonly kept in a container of some sort. In the field of science, a representative liquid sample taken from a larger amount of liquid is sometimes called an aliquot.|$|R
40|$|ABSTRACT: The first {{results of}} Pb isotope {{compositions}} of the high-Ti Mesozoic dykes of the Southern Espinhaço are presented. The results {{do not show}} large variations and are significantly more radiogenic than the Pb isotope compositions of the high-Ti tholeiites from the Paraná Continental Flood Basalts. The data combined with published geochemical and Sr-Nd isotope results rule out crustal contamination processes in {{the genesis of the}} dykes, requiring magma generation in metasomatized subcontinental lithospheric mantle with the involvement of HIMU-type and carbonatite components. The magmas may have been also derived from a mantle source containing ~ 4 - 5 % of pyroxenite and ~ 1 % of carbonatite melts, agreeing with published Os isotope compositions of high-Ti rocks from the Paraná Continental Flood Basalts. These metasomatizing agents could be responsible for mantle source refertilization, as was also proposed in the literature to explain the characteristics of xenoliths of the Goiás Alkaline Province, which also occurs in the border of the São Francisco Craton. Additionally, to evaluate the risks of Pb contamination during sample preparation for analysis, several experimental tests were accomplished, which indicate the need of sawed surface removal and a careful washing of small-sized rock <b>fragments</b> before <b>powdering,</b> especially for rocks with [Pb] < 7 µg/g...|$|R
40|$|To {{investigate}} {{the phenomenon of}} high burn-up fuel pellet material potentially disintegrating into powder under a rapid temperature transient, such as in a LOCA-type accident scenario, two independent scoping studies were commissioned. The first was to {{investigate the}} effect of hydrostatic restraint pressure on Fission Gas Release (FGR) from small samples of highly irradiated fuel (71 MWd/kgU) during a series of rapid temperature ramps. Experimentally, when the FGR increased rapidly during the temperature transients, the fuel was assumed to be "pulverized", i. e., <b>fragmented</b> into <b>powder.</b> In the second series of experiments, laser heating of small samples was used to investigate the temperature at which fuel pulverization was initiated. Subsequent to fuel disintegration, there was always a spectrum of particle sizes present. The significance of this observation was recognized in the context of extended burn-up operation in commercial reactors. Based on the observation from these investigations, a fuel fragmentation threshold has been discussed and developed. We conclude that fuel disintegration could be of potential importance in limiting the performance and productive lifetime of nuclear fuel. However, since only fuel closely adjacent to ballooned or ruptured cladding would be released in a LOCA-type transient, expulsion of pulverized fuel from the ruptured fuel rod is not considered a safety issue; cooling of the defected assembly remains possible and there is no issue with respect to local criticality.

40|$|The instant {{release of}} fission {{products}} from high burn-up UO 2 fuels and one MOX fuel was investigated {{by means of}} leach tests. The samples covered PWR and BWR fuels at average rod burn-up {{in the range of}} 45 – 63 GWd/tHM and included clad fuel segments, fuel segments with opened cladding, fuel <b>fragments</b> and fuel <b>powder.</b> The tests were performed with sodium chloride – bicarbonate solutions under oxidizing conditions and, for one test, in reducing Ar/H 2 atmosphere. The iodine and cesium release could be partially explained by the differences in sample preparation, leading to different sizes and properties of the exposed surface areas. Iodine and cesium releases tend to correlate with FGR and linear power rating, but the scatter of the data is significant. Although the gap between the fuel and the cladding was closed in some high burn-up samples, fissures still provide possible preferential transport pathways. JRC. G. III. 8 -Waste Managemen...|$|R
40|$|To {{investigate}} {{the role of}} the islets of Langerhans in pancreatic carcinogenesis, freshly isolated islets from male Syrian hamsters were transplanted into the right submandibular glands of 50 female hamsters that were or were not pre-treated with streptozotocin. Thyroid gland <b>fragments,</b> cellulose <b>powder,</b> and immortal hamster pancreatic ductal cells were injected into the left submandibular gland of the same hamsters. All recipient hamsters were then treated with the potent pancreatic carcinogen N-nitrosobis(2 -oxopropyl) amine weekly at a dose of 40 mg/kg of body weight for 3 weeks. Between 3 and 8 weeks later, 18 of 75 (24 %) hamsters developed large ductal-type adenocarcinomas in the submandibular gland region, where islets were transplanted, but none developed tumors in the left submandibular gland. In 9 of 18 hamsters, tumors were multiple so that a total of 31 cancers were found. Eleven of these carcinomas were in the vicinity of transplanted islets, eight of which showed intra-insular ductular or cyst formation as seen in the pancreas of hamsters during pancreatic carcinogenesis. The formation of ductular structures within islets was also demonstrated in vitro. Some tumor cells in the vicinity of these islets were reactive with anti-insulin. Y chromosome message was found by polymerase chain reaction analysis in one of the three tumors examined. Also, like the induced pancreatic tumors, all three submandibular gland tumors that were examined had the mutation of the c-Ki-ras oncogene at codon 12 and all tumors expressed blood group A antigen. These and other findings strongly suggest that some components of islets, most probably stem cells, are the origin of ductal-type adenocarcinomas in this model...|$|R
60|$|Through countless {{thousands}} of years, perhaps, this gradual process went on. Nature, shifting its huge scenery, depressed the ocean beds and piled up the dry {{land of the}} continents. In place of the vast 'Continental Sea,' which once filled the interior of North America, there arose the great plateau or elevated plain that now runs from the Mackenzie basin to the Gulf of Mexico. Instead of the rushing waters of the inland sea, these waters have narrowed into great rivers--the Mackenzie, the Saskatchewan, the Mississippi--that swept {{the face of the}} plateau and wore down the surface of the rock and mountain slopes to spread their <b>powdered</b> <b>fragments</b> on the broad level soil of the prairies of the west. With each stage {{in the evolution of the}} land the forms of life appear to have reached a higher development. In place of the seaweed and the giant ferns of the dawn of time there arose the maples, the beeches, and other waving trees that we now see in the Canadian woods. The huge reptiles in the jungle of the Carboniferous era passed out of existence. In place of them came the birds, the mammals,--the varied types of animal life which we now know. Last in the scale of time and highest in point of evolution, there appeared man.|$|R
