Ingrid Sischy from Interview magazine said that the song felt like a ballad for the world, containing [...] "the sounds of a great big marching band. It's a giant dance song". Madonna agreed with Sischy and responded that the song was [...] "a funny paradox" [...] and was one of the inspirations behind her documentary I Am Because We Are (2008). The documentary dealt with the acute suffering and food shortage afflicting the African nation of Malawi.|$|E

In November 2008, on his official site, Jonathan Davis stated that they still plan on releasing the album.

500|$|After the Beatles' break-up, the two collaborated musically {{and formed}} Wings in 1971. They faced derision from some fans and critics, who {{questioned}} her inclusion. She {{was nervous about}} performing with Paul, who explained, [...] "she conquered those nerves, got on with it and was really gutsy." [...] Paul defended her musical ability: [...] "I taught Linda the basics of the keyboard... She {{took a couple of}} lessons and learned some bluesy things... she did very well and made it look easier than it was... The critics would say, 'She's not really playing' or 'Look at her—she's playing with one finger.' But what they didn't know is that sometimes she was playing a thing called a Minimoog, which could only be played with one finger. It was monophonic." [...] He went on to say, [...] "We thought we were in it for the fun... <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>just</b> <b>something</b> we wanted to do, so if we got it wrong—big deal. We didn't have to justify ourselves."

[...] These conflicts {{were going to be}} further explored in the first season; however, positive fan reaction to Sun and Jin as a couple and good chemistry between the actors playing Michael and Jin led to the abandonment of the love triangle. [...] Reuters announced in November that the mobisodes would premiere that month.

[...] A new mobisode would generally become available each Monday and would be released a week later as a free webisode on ABC's website.

After {{he dropped out of}} Chalmers, his parents refused to support him, and as a result he funded his early videos by selling prints of his Photoshop art, as well as working at a hot dog stand. On having to work at the stand, PewDiePie stated, [...] "the fact that I could make videos was so much more important to me than [...] I had to spend a few hours a day doing a job that wasn’t that prestigious." [...] Five years later, PewDiePie recalled, [...] "I knew people were big at other types of videos, but there was no one big in gaming, and I didn’t know you could make money out of it. It was never like a career that I could just quit college to pursue. <b>It</b> <b>was</b> <b>just</b> <b>something</b> I loved to do. And here we are five years later and it’s exploded." [...] By December 2011, PewDiePie's channel had around 60,000 subscribers. Around the time his channel earned 700,000 subscribers, PewDiePie spoke at Nonick Conference 2012. On 11 July 2012, the channel reached 1 million subscribers, and it reached 2 million subscribers in September. In October, OpenSlate ranked the PewDiePie channel as the #1 YouTube channel.

500|$|Final Destination was {{conceived}} by writers Jeffrey Reddick, James Wong, and Glen Morgan from Flight 180, a spec script {{intended for use}} in The X-Files. The film premiered across the United States and Canada on March 17, 2000, grossing $10,015,822 on its opening weekend and an overall gross of $112,880,294 internationally. The film's success inspired New Line Cinema then-President of Production Toby Emmerich to approach Reddick for a sequel, to which he responded positively. Reddick asserted that he [...] "wanted to expand on the mythology and not just tell the same story over again.” Unfortunately, Wong and Morgan weren't available for production since they had already signed on their respective projects The One and Willard. Instead, New Line hired second unit director and stunt coordinator David R. Ellis as director and writing partners Eric Bress and J. Mackye Gruber as co-writers. [...] "Second unit is like an extension of directing, you’re doing big action sequences on film and <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>just</b> <b>something</b> I was going after. Once I got the offer from New Line {{and we got a}} good script, {{it was kind of a}} natural transition," [...] Ellis professed. [...] "I wanted our film to be able to stand alone but I watched Final Destination to see what they did that was so successful. I tried to use some of that while trying to keep a stand-alone feel for our movie. I kind of took what worked and tried to improve on it," [...] Ellis added. [...] "We wanted to take what the first film did effectively, and add levels and layers that would come out through the characters. When we first started writing this, we were trying to think, 'How can we make Death just a total badass?' and to be perfectly honest, the first crack we ever took at this script had to be reined in!" [...] Bress uncovered. On the other hand, producers Craig Perry and Warren Zide from Zide/Perry Productions also returned and helped on financing the film.|$|E

5000|$|In {{the course}} of this controversy, Lopsang's actions during that summit climb, as that of others, came under some degree of scrutiny.

Lopsang later explained that he himself made such decisions, so as to provide assistance to any team member [...] "who was having trouble. This was to ensure that all group members would {{have a good chance of}} making the summit." [...] Lopsang acknowledged that on the day of this fateful summit push, he suffered from vomiting and fatigue, which Krakauer described as symptoms of overexertion; but Lopsang explained [...] "I have been over 8,000 meters many times, each time I vomit. <b>It</b> <b>is</b> <b>just</b> <b>something</b> I do. <b>It</b> means nothing. I have done it on all successful expeditions, when leading or following. I did it at camp I, II, etc. For me, it has nothing to do with altitude sickness." ...|$|R
2500|$|There's a word {{we used to}} use in Jamaica called 'streggae'.

This one morning me and my two friends were playing and I said, 'OK man, let's do the reggay.' <b>It</b> <b>was</b> <b>just</b> <b>something</b> that came out of my mouth. So we just start singing 'Do the reggay, do the reggay' and created a beat. People tell me later that we had given the sound its name.

2500|$|It {{is unknown}} whether {{the origins of}} the {{practice}} are purely superstitious. Hall of Famer Denis Potvin says that the Islanders of the 1980s would [...] "play four games in five nights in the first round and <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>just</b> <b>something</b> that kind of happened." [...] The 1980 Islanders included two Swedish players (Stefan Persson and Anders Kallur), so it is possible that tennis champion Björn Borg's custom of not shaving his beard during Wimbledon, which he had been doing for several years by that time, was an influence on the start of the practice in hockey. Some players have said the beard is both a reminder of team unity and a way to get a player thinking about the playoffs from the moment he looks in the mirror in the morning. The 2009 Red Wings used the slogan [...] "The beard is back" [...] for the final series of their 2009 Stanley Cup playoffs run. They played the Pittsburgh Penguins in the Stanley Cup Final that year (won by Pittsburgh) in which most of the players (and the owner of the team, Mario Lemieux) grew beards as well.|$|E

For us <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>just</b> music, <b>something</b> that <b>was</b> natural, but people somehow always needed a title, a label. We didn't want to give them something stale, that’s why we came up with the name. For us, 'Prognative' defined the album perfectly.
