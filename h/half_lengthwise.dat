25|$|Splitboard: A {{snowboard}} which splits in <b>half</b> <b>lengthwise,</b> {{and allows}} the bindings to be quickly connected to hinges aligning them longitudinally on the board, allowing the halves of the boards to function as cross country skis. Used with removable skins {{on the base of}} the board, which easily slide forward on snow but not backwards, they allow a snowboard to easily travel into the backcountry. Once the rider is ready to descend, the board halves can simply be joined back together.|$|E
25|$|Group Q5-2 {{features}} a large block of cut limestone {{that may have}} functioned as the base for a stela. The group is also notable for a small cave underneath the principal structure. Near the cave entrance was found a large shell that had been cut in <b>half</b> <b>lengthwise</b> in order {{to serve as a}} scribe's inkwell, as illustrated in Maya art. Because of this inkwell, the excavators have interpreted this group as the residence of a scribe. The group has been dated to the Late Classic.|$|E
25|$|Some {{researchers}} use chicken mash for feed. A {{plastic pipe}} {{can be cut}} in <b>half</b> <b>lengthwise</b> to make two troughs {{which can be used}} as feeders for mash. Mix laying mash (used for egg-producing hens) into the feed to provide calcium for the snails' shells. Commercial chicken feeding mash is around 16% to 17% protein, from fish meal and meat meal, making it good for growing snails. Supplying mash to hatchlings might reduce cannibalism. Two feeds that snails like and that promote good growth are: (A) broiler finisher mash consisting of 7% broiler concentrate, 58% corn, 16% soya, 18% sorghum, 7% limestone flour (40% Ca); and (B) chicken feed (pellets) for layers consisting of 5% layer concentrate, 10%, corn, 15% soya, 20% sorghum, 44% barley, 6% limestone flour (40% Ca).|$|E

5000|$|The covered bridge {{rests on}} the {{original}} stone abutments, which have since been reinforced with concrete made of cement. The bridge deck is made of crosswise planking, overlaid with runners in the western <b>half</b> and <b>lengthwise</b> planking in the eastern half. The {{upper part of the}} portals and the clapboard siding is made of pine boards, and stops 3 ft below the roof line. Although the bridge was painted red as part of its 1998 restoration, in 1964 it was described as unpainted, and {{it does not seem to}} have been painted in 1980, as the NRHP nomination form describes how [...] "its rough horizontal siding ... helps this small bridge blend into the surrounding forest". The roof was originally covered with wooden shingles. The bridge does not have parapets and has [...] "no steel reinforcements".|$|R
25|$|A banana split is an ice cream-based dessert. In its classic form it {{is served}} in a long dish called a boat. A banana is cut in <b>half</b> <b>lengthwise</b> (hence the split) and laid in the dish. There are many variations, but the classic banana split is made with scoops of vanilla, {{chocolate}} and strawberry ice cream {{served in a}} row between the split banana. Although the banana as an exotic fruit {{was introduced to the}} American public in the 1880s, it was later in 1904, that the banana split was invented in the town of Latrobe, Pennsylvania by 23-year-old pharmacy apprentice David Strickler, who was inspired to create a new sundae after seeing a soda jerk during a visit to Atlantic City. According to The Food Chronology, written in 1995 by James Trager, Strickler concocted his sundae to include three scoops of ice cream on a split banana, topped with chocolate syrup, marshmallow, nuts, whipped cream, and a cherry that sold for a dime. Other soda jerks soon imitated Strickler's banana split, albeit in other forms.|$|E
500|$|Immature fruiting {{bodies of}} L.periphragmoides start as round or oval [...] "eggs" [...] {{that may be}} up to [...] in diameter. On the {{underside}} of the egg are whitish rhizomorphs that anchor it to the substrate. The peridium is white to buff-colored on the external surface, and has a gelatinous layer inside. An egg cut in <b>half</b> <b>lengthwise</b> reveals internal layers, including a tough white outer peridium, and a thick layer of firm, translucent, gelatinous matter transversed by strands (trabeculae) of denser white tissue. The strands are anastomosing partitions, connecting with the peridium externally and with the bars of the receptaculum within. The gelatinous layer is therefore divided up into many irregular longitudinal chambers.|$|E
2500|$|Split-spoon / SPT Sampler. Utilized in the 'Standard Test Method for Standard Penetration Test (SPT) and Split-Barrel Sampling of Soils' (ASTM D 1586). This sampler is {{typically}} an 18"-30" [...] long, 2.0" [...] outside diameter (OD) hollow tube split in <b>half</b> <b>lengthwise.</b> A hardened metal drive shoe with a 1.375" [...] opening {{is attached to}} the bottom end, and a one-way valve and drill rod adapter at the sampler head. It is driven into the ground with a [...] hammer falling 30". [...] The blow counts (hammer strikes) required to advance the sampler a total of 18" [...] are counted and reported. Generally used for non-cohesive soils, samples taken this way are considered disturbed.|$|E
2500|$|Several {{methods are}} used for killing {{lobsters}}. [...] The most common way of killing lobsters is by placing them live in boiling water, sometimes after having been placed in a freezer {{for a period of}} time. [...] Another method is to split the lobster or sever the body in <b>half</b> <b>lengthwise.</b> Lobsters may also be killed or rendered insensate immediately before boiling by a stab into the brain (pithing), in the belief that this will stop suffering. However, a lobster's brain operates from not one but several ganglia and disabling only the frontal ganglion does not usually result in death. The boiling method is illegal in some places, such as in Reggio Emilia, Italy, where offenders face fines up to €495. Lobsters can be killed by electrocution prior to cooking, with one device, the CrustaStun, applying a 110-volt, 2 to 5 amp electrical charge to the animal.|$|E
60|$|So it {{was that}} Kwan-Yung-jin travelled. The headmen of the village were cringingly afraid of him, and for good reason, as we were not overlong in finding out. I stepped forward as interpreter, for already I had the hang of several score of Korean words. He scowled and waved me aside. But what did I reek? I was as tall as he, outweighed him by a full two stone, and my skin was white, my hair golden. He turned his back and {{addressed}} the head man of the village while his six silken satellites made a cordon between us. While he talked more soldiers from the ship carried up several shoulder-loads of inch-planking. These planks were about six feet long and two feet wide, and curiously split in <b>half</b> <b>lengthwise.</b> Nearer one end than {{the other was a}} round hole larger than a man's neck.|$|E

5000|$|The general {{assembly}} hereby establishes a recommended procedure for the folding {{of the state}} flag by two people. The procedure is as follows:With the flag unfolded, fold the flag in <b>half</b> <b>lengthwise</b> so that the points of the flag are aligned. Fold the flag in <b>half</b> <b>lengthwise</b> a second time to form a long strip with the red disc facing the ground. Next, fold the pointed end back onto itself to form a rectangle. These steps entail three folds.Starting on the end formed by the fold of the pointed end back onto itself, fold two inches of the flag onto itself for a flag with a three-foot hoist and a five-foot fly, or another appropriate width of fold for a flag of a different size. Repeat the folds a total of fourteen times, alternating the folds in a fan-like manner.The result is a total of seventeen folds symbolizing that Ohio was the seventeenth state admitted to the Union. Finally, neatly and snugly wrap the remaining length of flag around the fan-folds to form a compact rectangle.|$|E
50|$|While most puffballs are not poisonous, some often look {{similar to}} young agarics, {{especially}} the deadly Amanitas, {{such as the}} death cap or destroying angel mushrooms. It {{is for this reason}} that all puffballs gathered in mushroom hunting are cut in <b>half</b> <b>lengthwise.</b> Young puffballs in the edible stage, before maturation of the gleba, have undifferentiated white flesh within; whereas the gills of immature Amanita mushrooms can be seen if they are closely examined.|$|E
5000|$|In {{addition}} to their legendary tacos, Chico's Tacos are also known for their unique hot dogs. Unlike hotdogs commonly served in America, this menu item is served on a hamburger bun with two franks sliced in <b>half</b> <b>lengthwise,</b> topped with their chili, mustard, and pickles. Couple that with a side of crinkle cut fries (that some say taste best with Chico's special tomato sauce and a topping of cheese) makes for another tasty legend at Chico's Tacos.|$|E
5000|$|The leaves {{lining the}} slender but rough stems are uniform {{in size and}} distribution, not {{clustered}} or reduced in size near stem tips. They are lance-shaped with two parallel veins separating three raised areas on the upper surface (see closeup at left), each leaf measuring 5 to 8 millimeters (0.20-0.32 inches) long. [...] Leaves emerge curled slightly and folded in <b>half</b> <b>lengthwise.</b> Leaves have stipules which are widened into membranous ochrea wrapped around the leaf bases.|$|E
50|$|A bound seam has {{each of the}} {{raw edges}} of its seam {{allowances}} enclosed in a strip of fabric, lace or net 'binding' that has been folded in <b>half</b> <b>lengthwise.</b> An example of binding is double-fold bias tape. The binding's fold is wrapped around the raw edge of the seam allowance and is stitched, through all thicknesses, catching underside of binding in stitching.Bound seams are often used on lightweight fabrics including silk and chiffon and on unlined garments to produce a neat finish.|$|E
5000|$|The chorizo is sausage made of pork, {{may be used}} {{whole or}} cut in <b>half</b> <b>lengthwise.</b> Usually the sauce chimichurri is used as well as mayonnaise, {{sometimes}} Uruguayans tend to add tomatoes and lettuce.

50|$|The {{original}} Minories layout was 1 x 7 ft in size, {{with the}} fiddle yard additional to this. It folded in <b>half</b> <b>lengthwise,</b> using a removable girder road bridge {{to hide the}} hinges. A two-section folding baseboard was an obvious plan for a layout, as the sections could fold in on themselves to make a protected storage box. However this also required the hinges to be above 'ground level' to allow height for buildings etc., usually difficult to achieve for rural scenes, but easily done here with the retaining wall and bridge.|$|E

5000|$|One of {{the most}} common ways to prepare {{butternut}} squash is roasting. To do this, the squash is cut in <b>half</b> <b>lengthwise</b> (see pictures), lightly brushed with cooking oil or put in a thin layer of water and placed cut side down on a baking sheet. It is then baked for 45 minutes or until soft. Once roasted, it can be eaten in a variety of ways.The fruit is prepared by removing the skin, stalk, and seeds, which are not usually eaten or cooked. However, the seeds are edible, either raw or roasted, and the skin is also edible and softens when roasted.|$|E

50|$|Traditional {{clothing}} for women includes either a vest or long-sleeved jacket or long overcoat worn over a gown. An under dress and puffy pants is worn beneath the gown. Traditionally women wore Kurdish hats ornamented with valued coloured stones, beads and gold pieces. Usually younger women and young girls wear brightly coloured dresses adorned with many beads and sequins {{and the older}} women wear darker colours and white head-cover. Hawrami men generally wear a shirt; a vest with an open neck; and baggy trousers fitted at the ankles. A cotton sash 3-4 m long is folded in <b>half</b> <b>lengthwise</b> and wrapped tightly around the torso on waist. Men also wore traditional brown felt jackets with pointed shoulders called Kolabal.|$|E

50|$|The {{reason for}} this project was to {{preserve}} secrecy during development of the new model, the SAAB 99, which was the company's first radically new body shape since the first cars made in 1947. The Toad used {{the body of a}} SAAB 96, which was long enough for the purpose but had to be widened by 20 cm. This was achieved by cutting the body in <b>half</b> <b>lengthwise</b> and inserting 20 cm of steel 'spacer'. The windscreen (windshield) and rear window clearly showed the 'seam'. Of course, the bonnet (hood) and grille required widening in a different way, to prevent changing the appearance of the centrally-placed features, as the picture shows. The Triumph 'in-line four' engine of the future Saab 99 replaced the 'Ford Taunus V4 engine' of the SAAB 96.|$|E
50|$|The wooden lur {{of medieval}} Scandinavia (not to be {{confused}} with the much earlier bronze instrument to which it has lent its name) is referred to in the Icelandic sagas as an instrument of war, used to marshal troops and frighten the enemy. It is also mentioned by Saxo Grammaticus in his Gesta Danorum. This particular species of lur was a straight, end-blown natural trumpet, with a cylindrical tube about 1 m long. It was made of wood - typically by cutting a thick branch in <b>half</b> <b>lengthwise</b> and hollowing it out, and then rejoining the two-halves, which are secured with tar and willow osiers. A similar instrument, but secured with birch, known as the birch trumpet, has been used in Nordic countries since the Middle Ages as a signalling instrument and to call cattle.|$|E

5000|$|Morels can be {{preserved}} in several ways: They can be 'flash frozen' by simply running {{under cold water}} or putting them in a bucket to soak for a few minutes, then spread on a baking tray and placed into a freezer. After freezing, they keep very well with the frozen glaze {{for a long time}} in airtight plastic containers. However, when thawed they can sometimes turn slightly mushy, so they are best frozen after steaming or frying. Due to their natural porosity, morels may contain trace amounts of soil which cannot be easily washed out. Any visible soil should be removed with a brush, after cutting the body in <b>half</b> <b>lengthwise,</b> if needed. Mushroom hunters sometimes recommend soaking morels in a bowl of salt water briefly prior to cooking, although many chefs would disagree.|$|E
50|$|In {{its most}} {{primitive}} form, the barrel grill {{is nothing more}} than a 55 gal steel barrel sliced in <b>half</b> <b>lengthwise.</b> Hinges are attached so the top half forms the lid and the bottom half forms the charcoal chamber. Vents are cut into the top and bottom for airflow control. A chimney is normally attached to the lid. Charcoal grids and cooking grids are installed in the bottom half of the grill, and legs are attached. Like kettle grills, barrel grills work well for grilling as well as true barbecuing. For barbecuing, lit charcoal is piled at one end of the barrel and food to be cooked is placed at the other. With the lid closed, heat can then be controlled with vents. Fancier designs available at stores may have other features, but the same basic design does not change.|$|E
50|$|Svið is {{prepared}} by first burning off the hair, then cleaning the head under running cold water while paying {{special attention to}} the eyes and ears. The head must then be sawn in <b>half</b> <b>lengthwise</b> and the brain removed; if it is frozen first, this is less messy. The brains can be cooked with the skin. When it is ready for cooking, it is put into a cooking pot, sprinkled with coarse salt and partly covered with water. When the water boils, the scum is skimmed off. The head can then be cooked covered for 60 to 90 minutes, until the flesh is cooked through but before it has begun to separate from the bone. It can then be served immediately, hot, or can be left to cool down {{so that it can be}} served cold.|$|E
