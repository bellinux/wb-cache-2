40|$|In this Master's thesis was {{studied the}} {{feasibility}} of waste heat recovery in <b>data</b> <b>centres.</b> The aim was {{to address the problem}} with the continuously increasing electricity consumption in <b>data</b> <b>centres,</b> to explore the waste heat recovery opportunities in them and to find out which is the preferred alternative for waste heat recovery in the Finnish <b>data</b> <b>centres.</b> Also, to observe the role of management in influencing the waste heat recovery policies. The study was conducted through a mixed method research, using the concurrent embedded design type and consisting of a main part, and a complementary part. The main part was of a qualitative nature and was implemented through literature review, media review, observations, interviews and participation in social groups. The complementary part was in a supportive role and focused on revealing the choices of Finnish <b>data</b> <b>centres</b> through an online questionnaire. The latter part necessitated a mixed type of research with a prevailing qualitative aspect and some minor quantitative elements. According to the study, the waste heat recovery in <b>data</b> <b>centres</b> is a sensible thing to do, there are many ways for its implementation, it has a big potential and the number of <b>data</b> <b>centres,</b> having a waste heat recovery, is growing. Being a low temperature heat, the waste heat from <b>data</b> <b>centres</b> has its drawbacks, but with some upgrading technologies, it can be economically feasible. Based on the questionnaire, it was found that waste heat recovery in Finnish <b>data</b> <b>centres</b> is done mainly through a new technology adoption. Though, the difference between this option and the change process one was not big. Moreover, location and management of <b>data</b> <b>centres</b> were considered the most important factors for undertaking a waste heat recovery. Ownership was not found to have a great impact on waste heat recovery-related decisions. In Finland, the tendencies of reusing waste heat from <b>data</b> <b>centres</b> are following the international trends and the number of successful cases is growing. Despite of that, waste heat recovery is not yet a business in the country as it needs more motivation and change in the way of thinking. Being green is not undertaken unless it is a business case. Tax reliefs for smaller <b>data</b> <b>centres</b> and {{on the basis of the}} PUE values are recommendable for a better energy performance of Finnish <b>data</b> <b>centres.</b> Recommendable is also to research further the application of the "eight stage model" for creating major change, the reasons why waste heat recovery is not developing at the same speed with energy consumption in <b>data</b> <b>centres,</b> to analyse more the management work, the types of changes needed as well as the challenges of split incentives...|$|R
