50|$|Milyutin's {{concept of}} city {{development}} outlined in his 1930 book, Sotsgorod (Socialist City), was superficially similar {{to an earlier}} de-urbanist concept of a linear city put forward by Mikhail Okhitovich. Unlike Okhitovich, whose linear city was terminated with industrial hubs and thus limited in growth, Milyutin's concept allowed for practically unrestricted linear growth. Milyutin as an economist was very well aware of construction costs and shortage of funds {{in the period of}} rapid industrialisation, and carefully weighed costs and benefits of available growth scenarios. His concept was based on decentralisation of industry, which needed to be spread in a thin line along a mainline railroad route, ideally - according to the natural flow of production from raw supplies to finished goods (Milyutin concentrated on gigantic mass production plants like the GAZ or the STZ). The <b>housing</b> <b>zone,</b> separated from the industrial zone by a park strip, would develop concurrently, and ideally residents will be settled directly across their employers, eliminating the need for private or public transportation. In another departure from linear city, he did not insist on building housing in a continuous strip; on the contrary, Milyutin proposed a less expensive model of initially isolated housing hubs spread along the main line which might, eventually, merge into a continuous housing belt.|$|E

40|$|A clause {{entitled}} “Segregation of Races” {{was inserted}} in the St. Petersburg City Charter in 1931. It wasn’t until 1936, however, that the clause {{gave rise to the}} first segregated <b>housing</b> <b>zone</b> within the city. In this report we provide evidence to suggest that it was the Federal Government and not the St. Petersburg city council, as has been claimed, that was responsible for the implementation of this clause and the segregated commercial district that developed along 22 nd Street South. We then document the rise of this commercial district and present further evidence that city council showed little interest in preventing white store owners from operating businesses in the district long past the time when the segregation clause should have prevented them from doing so. Finally, we examine the reasons for the demise of the district in light of federal legislation that banned segregation in the 1960 s, and the suggestion that highway I- 275 may also {{have played a role in}} contributing to this demise...|$|E
40|$|AbstractCamici; {{which is}} a ward statute in Niksar city in Tokat province; is {{situated}} on an important route between Niksar and Unye, connecting Kelkit Basin to the Black Sea coast. It was established on the interior of forest grazing lands of Ardicli and Özdemir villages, and partially on mountain pasture land of Karabodur village. In addition to its natural and cultural richness Çamiçi has potentials of rural recreation and high plateau tourism. The settlements have developed in a dispersed manner with housing zones called “oba” and “site”. In Ilkoba, where the first settlement was established {{by the people of}} Niksar, we come across wooden mountain houses built in 1950 s. In the following years residental houses, have been built on valleys, lying on inner ranges of Canik Mountains. These kept on increasing by damaging forestlands. Today housing pressure is increasingly continuing on these areas. Houses, generally used as summer houses, were built in different architectural styles incompatible with nature. Although upper level plans of the region have strategic objectives related to developing high plateau tourism, no decisions were taken on the planning for Camici. According to the 2015 Implemantation Development Plan of Camici; prepared as a lower scale plan; housing pressure has increased. For developing settlements in the area new <b>housing</b> <b>zone</b> was offered threefold of the size of floured structuring and present <b>housing</b> <b>zone.</b> At the same time common use areas serving residents living in summer months were offered. Furthermore, to become an centre of attraction for tourism, bicycle paths and race tracks, recreation areas, fair ground – festival area, telepheric line and a musician-artist village was added to the plans of Camici High Plateau. The aim of this study thus was to evaluate development of physical settlements in the context of its relationship with the natural environment in Camici, determine the potential in terms of high plateau tourism, and suggest required constructure criteria. This was acheived by going through present written sources, statistical data, urban development plans, followed by the preparation of land surveys and interviews. The development of settlements from 1950 to present and its relationship with natural evnviroment were examined. The problems of settlement in high plateau related to local governments services were asserted and finally high plateau tourism potential was evaluated...|$|E
