After the performance, she exclaimed [...] "That was fun! First time ever. Hit a few bad notes, but <b>it</b> <b>felt</b> <b>good</b> <b>to</b> sing it." [...] The singer subsequently performed the song in the other cities during the Asian and Oceanian legs of the Rebel Heart Tour.

500|$|This episode reintroduces and {{resolves}} Veronica's rape, introduced {{earlier in}} the season. However, it had been largely ignored until {{this point in the}} series. The episode was the third and final episode of the series directed by Marcos Siega, after [...] "Drinking the Kool-Aid" [...] and [...] "Mars vs. Mars". In addition, the episode marks regular writer Diane Ruggiero's sixth writing credit for the show. After the episode aired, Rob Thomas called the episode [...] "our high-water mark". Commenting on Ruggiero writing the episode, he stated, [...] "She was really my right hand writing the series, and <b>it</b> <b>felt</b> <b>good</b> <b>to</b> have someone who knew the voices as well as I did. We were both in a comfort zone, both writing this show and writing with each other." ...|$|E
500|$|... "Commander" [...] is an electro-house-R song, set in {{a common}} time {{signature}} of 125beats per minute. It was written by Kelly Rowland, Rico Love, David Guetta and Sandy Vee with deliberate grammar errors such as [...] "there's no other who do it like I do it" [...] and [...] "you won't find no lady who does it like I does it". The lyrics have themes around hair, fashion and competing with other women. Guetta also produced the synthesized dance beats, {{which is similar to}} his other production, [...] "Sexy Bitch". The end portions of the song were compared to some of the works by hip-hop producer Timbaland. Rowland explained that the hook of the song, [...] "Commander", should be associated with dance instead of the military. [...] "When I command you to dance ... I want you moving, you know? <b>It</b> <b>felt</b> <b>good</b> <b>to</b> have a song that I could express that in." ...|$|E

500|$|John Tobias {{said that}} his inspirations for the game's story and {{characters}} came from the Chinese mythology {{and some of the}} stories and rumored events about the Shaolin monks. Regarding the film Big Trouble in Little China, Tobias wrote that although this movie [...] "kind of Americanized my obsession for supernatural kung fu films from China, it was not my biggest influence. My biggest influences came from Tsui Hark films -- Zu Warriors & The Swordsman. We had to get them from bootleggers in Chicago's Chinatown." [...] Tobias' writing and artistic input on the series ended in 1997. Fifteen years later, he said: [...] "I knew exactly what I was going to do with a future story. A few years ago I [...] a sort of sequel to the first MK film and an advancement to the game's mythological roots. The goal was to not runaway from what came before with a retelling, but to move the themes forward. I did it for fun as an exercise in screenwriting, but <b>it</b> <b>felt</b> <b>good</b> <b>to</b> get that out of my system." ...|$|E
500|$|Michael Liedtke and George Avalos of the Contra Costa Times {{were pleased}} with the episode and wrote, [...] "The latest episode also {{contained}} many {{of the elements of}} a classic mythology episode. The stakes were huge and the heroes faced the greatest of hazards. The use of the oil rig created a sense of isolation for Mulder and Doggett, and the paranoia levels were sky-high. We still can't figure out why we haven't seen more episodes along the lines of Vienen during the past three seasons." [...] Jessica Morgan from Television Without Pity awarded the episode a [...] "B–". Tom Kessenich, in his book Examinations, gave Vienen a positive review, and wrote, [...] "after watching 'Vienen', I can honestly say that for once of the few times this season, <b>it</b> <b>felt</b> <b>good</b> <b>to</b> be an X-Files fan again". Kessenich praised the significant development in Mulder and Scully's relationship and the return of the [...] "fourth season version" [...] of the black oil; the 1998 movie had dramatically altered the nature of the substanceinfected hosts gestate aliens inside their bodies rather than merely being taken over.|$|E
500|$|One of Lex's key {{characteristics}} is his curiosity for the unexplained. Lex's primary motive for his [...] "shady" [...] actions derives from his curiosity, specifically beginning {{from the moment}} he and Clark meet after Lex hits Clark with his Porsche. Clark always appearing when something strange happens in Smallville does nothing but fuel Lex's curiosity. Rosenbaum believes that Lex's only sees two options: [...] "For Lex, it's either take a nice ride to Metropolis and work with his dad, or find out what's going on with this strong, strange fellow, Clark Kent." [...] Another characteristic of Smallville 's Lex Luthor—one that is being developed {{over the course of the}} series—is his evilness. Rosenbaum believes that what the audience sees in Lex's dark side in the early seasons is merely a taste of what the character is truly capable of. In the season two premiere [...] "Vortex", Rosenbaum requested Greg Beeman to shoot a close-up of him after he shoots Nixon, in an effort to open a window into Lex's darker side. Rosenbaum intended to leave the interpretation of whether Lex enjoyed killing Nixon open to the audience. As Beeman explains Rosenbaum's thoughts, [...] "...either Lex is horrified and appalled, or he liked it, and <b>it</b> <b>felt</b> <b>good</b> <b>to</b> him". According to Rosenbaum, when Lex reaches that point where he uses all of his mind, and [...] "really flips out", that is the point where the [...] "world needs to hide". Television reviewer Brian Byun felt that it was this struggle between good and evil inside Lex that not only made him an anti-hero, but also, given that the audience familiar with Lex's mythology and the knowledge that he will end up being Superman's greatest enemy, make Smallvilles Lex Luthor a [...] "tragic figure [...] almost Shakespearean grandeur".|$|E
50|$|Historians have {{recorded}} that the Merchants of Baltimore including Jonathan Plowman Jr. made their ships into privateers and enriched {{them and the}} town with the spoils of British commerce. <b>It</b> must have <b>felt</b> <b>good</b> <b>to</b> get revenge for the 1771 seizure of his ship by the British.|$|R

2500|$|Bret {{tried to}} make amends with Owen, teaming {{with him on a}} regular basis. Bret even secured the two a shot at the WWF Tag Team Championship. They faced the Quebecers for the title at the Royal Rumble in January 1994. Initially {{everything}} was fine between the brothers, but when Bret hurt his knee (kayfabe) and was unable to tag Owen in {{for a long period of}} time, the younger Hart got frustrated. When the referee stopped the match due to Bret's damaged knee, Owen snapped; he kicked his brother in the knee and then walked off, berating Bret on the Titantron shortly after as Bret was being helped backstage. This started his run as a heel. After the act, an infuriated Owen accused his brother of being selfish and holding him down. Owen admitted that <b>it</b> <b>felt</b> <b>good</b> <b>to</b> take out his brother. The two brothers faced off for the first time at WrestleMania X, where Owen cleanly pinned his older brother. Later in the evening, Bret won the WWF World Heavyweight Championship while Owen stood by and watched in jealousy as Bret celebrated in the ring. Owen won the King of the Ring tournament with Jim Neidhart's help. After the victory, Owen took the nickname [...] "The King of Harts." ...|$|E

Mr. Coyote kept after him, yelping and howling, until he was sure that Mr. Lynx was so frightened that he wouldn't dare come back. Then Mr. Coyote returned to the dinner Mr. Lynx had left, and ate and ate until he couldn't hold another mouthful. His throat was very raw and sore because he had strained it trying to make his voice change so often, but he didn't mind this, because, you know, <b>it</b> <b>felt</b> so <b>good</b> <b>to</b> have all he could eat at one time once more.|$|R
2500|$|After the game, BYU quarterback Max Hall criticized Utah and its fans. He said, [...] "I don't like Utah. In fact, I hate them. I hate {{everything}} about them.

[...] When {{asked for a}} clarification and if he really hated Utah, he continued, [...] "I think the whole university and their fans and the organization is [...] classless. They threw beer on my family and stuff last year and did {{a whole bunch of}} nasty things. I don't respect them and they deserved to lose." [...] During the game, Hall had 12 completions out of 32 pass attempts for 134 yards. He had two touchdown passes and no interceptions.|$|R
5000|$|During the postgame press conference, Hall {{was asked}} if he felt he had {{redeemed}} himself for his performance in the previous year's game in which he had five interceptions and one fumble.

So, it feels <b>good</b> <b>to</b> send those guys home. They didn't deserve it. It was our time and it was our time to win. We deserved it.

5000|$|Regarding the {{decision}} to write and record an EP not long after Nocturnes release, Tatum noted: [...] "You {{can do whatever you}} want with EP, like it’s a free pass. People don’t really expect as much from an EP, so you’re free to do what you want to do. And that is what was so empowering about this particular experience for me. I never needed to take a step back and obsess over what kind of music I was making. I didn’t think that some people might think it’s weird that I’m making this electronic pop song or I’m making this really ambient, droney song. I just did what I wanted <b>to</b> do and <b>it</b> <b>felt</b> <b>good</b> not <b>to</b> think about the outside perspective. I do that so much. I spend a lot of time worrying about what other people think. But this EP was the most fun I’ve had writing and recording in a long time. ... A lot of times bands put out EPs with the leftover tracks that didn’t make it onto the album for some reason. But this was not like that for me." ...|$|R

Although their first choice for a drummer was Keltner - like Radle and Russell, a native of Tulsa - he was busy recording with jazz guitarist Gábor Szabó. Gordon, however, had been invited to London to work on Harrison's post-Beatles solo album All Things Must Pass. In May that year, Clapton, Whitlock, Radle and Gordon reunited in London at a session for P.P. Arnold, before going on to serve as the backing band on much of Harrison's album. In a 1990 interview, Clapton said, [...] "We made our bones, really, on that album with George", since the four musicians had [...] "no game plan" [...] other than living at Hurtwood Edge, [...] "getting stoned, and playing and semi-writing songs".|$|R
5000|$|On January 14, 2017 at the Barclays Center in Brooklyn on Showtime, Davis {{defeated}} José Pedraza (22-0, 12 KOs) in a seventh-round knockout {{to win the}} IBF junior lightweight title.

He said, [...] "I had a lot of experience the amateur ranks, but I learned how to keep my composure. Floyd told me to stay calm, and I studied Floyd Mayweather videos when he was 'Pretty Boy.'

60|$|The {{spring was}} {{pleasant}} there. It {{was a day}} upon which one <b>felt</b> <b>it</b> <b>good</b> merely <b>to</b> live. The young green of the trees was exquisite against the sky; and the sky, pale and blue, was dappled with little white clouds. At {{the end of the}} ornamental water was the gray mass of the Horse Guards. The ordered elegance of the scene had the charm of an eighteenth-century picture. It reminded you not of Watteau, whose landscapes are so idyllic that they recall only the woodland glens seen in dreams, but of the more prosaic Jean-Baptiste Pater.
