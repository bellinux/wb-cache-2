Small antennas are often resonant, {{so they can be}} characterised by a Q, {{except for the fact that}} the correct quality measure of an antenna is the inverse Q, that is the relative bandwidth, rather than Q.

Such a phase diagram can greatly facilitate the design of appropriate metasurfaces with tailored functionalities (e. g., perfect absorption, phase modulator, electric/magnetic reflector, etc.), demonstrated by our experiments and simulations in the Terahertz regime.

40|$|Transformation with ras oncogenes {{results in}} {{increased}} radiation sur vival in many {{but not all}} cells. In addition, prenyltransferase inhibitors which inhibit ras proteins by blocking posttranslational modification radiosensitize cells with oncogenic ras. These findings suggest that oncogenic ras contributes to <b>intrinsic</b> <b>radiation</b> resistance. However, because introduction of ras oncogenes does not increase radiation survival in all cells and because prenyltransferase inhibitors target molecules other than ras, these studies left the conclusion that ras increases the intrinsic radi ation resistance of tumor cells in doubt. Here we show that genetic inactivation of K- or N-ras oncogenes in human tumor cells (DLD- 1 and HT 1080, respectively) leads to increased radiosensitivity. Reintroduction of the activated N-ras gene into the HT 1080 line, having lost its mutant allele, resulted in increased radiation resistance.

40|$|We use a {{combination}} of analytic and numerical arguments to consider the impact of quasar photo-heating during He II reionisation on the thermal evolution of the intergalactic medium (IGM).

Although filtering of <b>intrinsic</b> quasar <b>radiation</b> through dense regions in the IGM does increase the mean excess energy per He II photo-ionisation, it also weakens the radiation intensity and lowers the photo-ionisation rate, preventing rapid heating over time intervals shorter than the local photo-ionisation timescale. Moreover, the hard photons responsible for the strongest heating are more likely to deposit their energy inside dense clumps, which cool rapidly and are furthermore invisible to most observational probes of the IGM temperature. The abundance of such clumps is, however, uncertain and model-dependent, leading to a fairly large uncertainty in the photoheating rates.
