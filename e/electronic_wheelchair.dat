40|$|A {{low-cost}} <b>electronic</b> <b>wheelchair</b> {{was designed}} and developed which can perform the similar functions and features as a commercially available wheelchair. It also provides obstacle avoidance capability as added value. The <b>electronic</b> <b>wheelchair</b> was   realized by modification of a lightweight manual wheelchair. It uses two electric motors each of 320 W 24 V DC, 5 - 24 VDC 6 A H-bride drivers, and a 12 V 17 Ah rechargeable lead acid battery. It equipped with switches, joystick, infrared sensors and ultrasonic sensors. A Gizduino AtMega 328 microcontroller is used to read and interpret commands. User’s acceptance evaluation results shows that the developed low - cost wheelchair is able to receive and interpret commands provided by the joystick, detect if a person  is seated on it, navigate to avoid obstacles {{as well as to}} detect edge and stairs. Technical evaluation result shows that on a flat surface it could move at the speed of around 39. 9 m/minute without load and 32 m/minute with 80 kg load. At 10 degrees inclined surface, the maximum weight limit is 30 kg with the speed of 12 m/min ute. At 20 degrees inclined surface, the maximum weight limit is 1 0 kg with the speed of 3 m/min ute. Regarding cost, it is just a fraction of a cost compared to the commercially available model. Therefore, the developed wheelchair offers an option for potential users who cannot afford to buy the commercially available one. </span...|$|E
40|$|We have {{designed}} and built a fuzzy logic controller which minimises the effect of Multiple Sclerosis (MS) hand tremors. The aim of our project has been to give people with Multiple Sclerosis better control of an <b>electronic</b> <b>wheelchair</b> by removing tremors from the joystick signal. The system intercepts the signal from the joystick and then passes it through the fuzzy logic controller. The fuzzy logic rules identify and reduce erratic or unusual movements, employing a history mechanism to determine what ``unusual'' is. The fuzzy logic then outputs a signal which most closely represents {{the intent of the}} user. This paper reports on the latest experiments conducted with our prototype wheelchair, using test volunteers with MS, {{as well as on the}} design of a new fuzzy logic controller...|$|E
50|$|The walking/cycling trail {{consists}} of 6.8 miles of paved concrete trails, stretching from either Ridgewood Duck Pond to Rochelle Park (6 miles total), or from Glen Rock Duck Pond to Rochelle Park (5 miles total). The trail is completely without cars, and prohibits all motorized vehicles, aside from <b>electronic</b> <b>wheelchairs</b> {{and other medical}} devices. There are benches laid out frequently on the trail, and water fountains and bathrooms {{in each of the}} parks. The trail has numerous path features, including 5 underpass bridges, which pass under existing roadways, and 5 bridges, which cross over various bodies of water.|$|R

40|$|This {{report has}} the {{objective}} of describing {{the process of creating}} a virtual reality game environment that allows the user to practice BCI (Brain Computer Interface) through controlling a BCI enabled wheelchair. It serves as a training platform for those who could possibly need a brain controlled wheelchair. The report also contains technical information on how various technologies such as Emotiv Epoc, A*, EEG (electroencephalography) and Unity 3 D work. The work is inspired by a condition known as ALS or Lou Gehrig's disease which gradually leaves the patient in a state of complete paralysis, this means conventional <b>electronic</b> <b>wheelchairs</b> won't be sufficient. With this in mind and the fact that BCI has emerged in recent years, the group is able to investigate future possibilities. To conclude the work the group investigated the process Emotiv would use to distinguish independent cognitive states. The result is an open world game environment which allows subjects to train and, become familiar with the equipment and the technology. In addition, during the BCI investigation the group discovered {{that it was possible to}} discern and classify different cognitive states via EEG using a neural network...|$|R

40|$|This study aims to find out/design and <b>electronic</b> <b>wheelchair</b> {{that can}} {{go up and down}} a slope, as an aid {{facility}} for people with disabilities and elderly people. The wheelchair uses a relay motor control program applied in a microcontroller controlling a DC Motor. This study is intended to inprove the writer???s skills in designing electric wheelchairs {{that can go}} up and down a slope. In terms of academic purpose, it is expected that this research can provide additional knowledge for students, especially the students of Mechanical Engineering Department, Faculty of Engineering, Hasanuddin University about wheelchair design that can be beneficial in increasing production through automation in the field of science and technology. The electric wheelchair is equipped with a microcontroller that can receive instructions from a mover stick. It also has a visual equipment that can facilitate the wheelchair user. The instruction from the mover stick will be directly sent because it is connected to the microcontroller by using a serial cable. The results reveal that the manual wheelchair stick / drive shaft driven directly by the user sends instructions to the microcontroller in accordance with the desired wheelchair movement. The signal will be forwarded to the driver that will drive the motor. In this system, the mover stick functions as a user interface connected to the control system. The control system consists of several electronic chains that function to control the electric wheelchair equipped with components of interface input/output and a driver as the actuator...|$|E
40|$|With the advancements in {{medicine}} and welfare systems, the average life span of modern human beings is expanding, creating a new market for elderly care and assistive technology. Along {{with the development of}} assistive devices based on traditional aids such as voice-readers, <b>electronic</b> <b>wheelchairs,</b> and prosthetic limbs, a robotic platform {{is one of the most}} suitable platforms for providing multi-purpose assistance in human life. This research focuses on the transference of environmental perception to a human user through the use of interactive multi-modal feedback and an assistive robotic platform. A novel framework for haptic telepresence is presented to solve the problem, and state-of-the-art methodologies from computer vision, haptics, and robotics are utilized. The objective of this research is to design a framework that achieves the following: 1) This framework integrates visual perception from heterogeneous vision sensors, 2) it enables real-time interactive haptic representation of the real world through a mobile manipulation robotic platform and a haptic interface, and 3) it achieves haptic fusion of multiple sensory modalities from the robotic platform and provides interactive feedback to the human user. Specifically, a set of multi-disciplinary algorithms such as stereo-vision processes, three-dimensional (3 D) map-building algorithms, and virtual-proxy based haptic volume representation processes will be integrated into a unified framework to successfully accomplish the goal. The application area of this work is focused on, but not limited to, assisting people with visual impairment with a robotic platform by providing multi-modal feedback of the environment.

40|$|This paper {{presents}} a recognition scheme for fine-grain ges-tures. The scheme leverages directional antenna and short-range wireless propagation properties {{to recognize a}} vocab-ulary of action-oriented gestures from the American Sign Language. Since the scheme only relies on commonly available wireless features such as Received Signal Strength (RSS), signal phase differences, and frequency subband se-lection, it is readily deployable on commercial-off-the-shelf IEEE 802. 11 devices. We have implemented the proposed scheme and evaluated it in two potential application scenar-ios: gesture-based <b>electronic</b> activation from <b>wheelchair</b> and gesture-based control of car infotainment system. The re-sults show that the proposed scheme can correctly identify and classify up to 25 fine-grain gestures with an average ac-curacy of 92 % for the first application scenario and 84 % for the second scenario...|$|R
40|$|Mobile {{technology}} is being adopted {{at a rapid}} pace by both schools and families, essentially being repurposed as assistive technology {{for students with disabilities}} (Gentry et al., 2010). This recent technology appears to have the potential to ameliorate many of the issues connected to the lack of sustainability of traditional forms of assistive technology implementation, which include: (a) stigmatisation; (b) cost; (c) maintenance; (d) sustainability; and (e) lack of alignment with the principles of Universal Design for Learning (Wehmeyer et al., 2008). As mobile technologies are being widely adopted as educational tools for all students, their potential importance as assistive technology for students with disabilities cannot be overstated. Many students with disabilities rely heavily on assistive technology to participate more fully in most environments in their lives. They use this technology for mobility (<b>wheelchairs,</b> <b>electronic</b> navigation systems), communication (Dynavox, PECS systems), social skills acquisition (video modelling), learning (computer software), literacy (screen readers, audiobooks), etc. (Merbler, Hadadian, 2 ̆ 6 Ulman, 1999). Some students require several different devices; this can be impractical when moving from one environment to another. Through the use of a variety of personalised applications, mobile technology may possess the capability to provide many kinds of support with one device. For example, a screen reader application could be used to assist with literacy, a communication app with communication, and a movie app for social skills lessons. Globally, students with disabilities have been included in the general education classroom in increasing numbers over the past few decades. The inclusion movement has left some general education teachers struggling to adapt their pedagogy to support an increasingly diverse student population. Global legislation such as the United States’ Individuals with Disabilities Education Improvement Act (2004), Australia’s Disability Standards for Education (2005), the United Kingdom’s Special Education Codes of Practice (2001), and the European Union’s Support for Children with Special Educational Needs (2013) all provide frameworks to ensure that students with disability can access education on the same basis as other students. These policies require all education providers to make reasonable adjustments to ensure that students with disabilities are treated equally with their non-disabled peers. Often this is accomplished through the use of accommodations and modifications to the environment, the curriculum, teaching, and learning. Accommodations and modifications are not always the optimal way to accomplish accessibility for all students. The environments and educational materials should be planned from the onset {{in such a way that}} they are accessible to all individuals (Edyburn, 2010). This underlines the importance of a teaching and learning framework that incorporates evidencebased practices that work for diverse populations of teachers and students from the outset. Accessibility is preferable over accommodation because it does not require extra effort in the form of time and resources, or moving to a special location, which is exclusionary. This type of built-in accessibility is an integral feature of Universal Design for Learning (UDL), which designs curricular materials and activities to be flexible in matching learner strengths and needs to assist students in reaching their learning goals (Gargiulo 2 ̆ 6 Metcalf, 2010). In order for assistive technology to be effective, it must be available across environments, and all individuals supporting the students must be well versed in the technology’s use (Brown, 2011). If these conditions are not present, students with disabilities experience distinct disadvantage and difficulties with full participation in inclusive environments. Therefore, it is imperative that both theoretical and operational frameworks are available to guide the collaboration between school personnel and home in all areas of technology implementation. Universal Design for Learning (UDL) lends itself well as a theoretical framework to support using mobile technology as assistive technology to allow students with disabilities to more fully participate in inclusive environments. This framework is supported by the pedagogical approaches differentiated instruction and explicit instruction in inclusive learning and teaching settings...|$|R
