5|$|Brolgas are gregarious creatures; {{the basic}} social unit {{is a pair}} or small family <b>group</b> <b>of</b> <b>about</b> three or four birds, usually parents {{together}} with juvenile offspring, though some of such groups are unrelated. In the non-breeding season, they gather into large flocks, which appear to be many self-contained individual groups rather than a single social unit. Within the flock, families tend to remain separate and to coordinate their activities with one another rather than with the flock as a whole.|$|E

5|$|Brolgas {{are well}} known for their ritualised, {{intricate}} mating dances. The performance begins with a bird picking up some grass and tossing it into the air before catching it in its bill. The bird then jumps a metre (yard) into the air with outstretched wings and continues by stretching its neck, bowing, strutting around, calling and bobbing its head up and down. Sometimes just one brolga dances for its mate; often they dance in pairs; and sometimes a whole <b>group</b> <b>of</b> <b>about</b> a dozen dance together, lining up roughly opposite each other before they start.|$|E

50|$|There is {{not much}} known <b>about</b> the {{behaviour}} <b>of</b> parti-coloured bats, as they are quite rare. Female bats live in small <b>groups,</b> <b>of</b> <b>about</b> 50 animals, sometimes up to several hundred adult females. In Western Europe, male <b>groups</b> consist <b>of</b> <b>about</b> 250 animals and are found only during the spring and early summer. These bats migrate, and flights of up to 900 km were found. The furthest migration was determined at 1780 km.|$|R

5|$|The antlions are a <b>group</b> <b>of</b> <b>about</b> 2,000 {{species of}} insect {{in the family}} Myrmeleontidae, known for the {{fiercely}} predatory habits of their larvae, which in many species dig pits to trap passing ants or other prey. The adult insects are less well known, as they mostly fly at dusk or after dark, and may be mistakenly identified as dragonflies or damselflies; they are sometimes known as antlion lacewings, and in North America, the larvae are {{sometimes referred to as}} doodlebugs because of the strange marks they leave in the sand.|$|E
5|$|When Laura's {{path was}} uncertain, forecasters advised {{fishermen}} {{to remain at}} port along the Yucatan Peninsula and southern Florida. Gale warnings were also issued for the Florida Keys, due to the uncertainty. No significant damage or casualties were reported in Central America, although heavy rainfall was reported across the region. On Glover's Reef {{off the coast of}} British Honduras (now Belize), the storm stranded a <b>group</b> <b>of</b> <b>about</b> 20scientists affiliated with the Smithsonian Institution; the group was affected by the strong winds and rains, and required rescue. The storm damaged several buildings along the mainland.|$|E
5|$|After the Glorious Revolution, Wright, a Jacobite, {{fell out}} of favour at the royal court. The Flemish-Spanish painter John Baptist Medina (1659–1710) came to Scotland in 1693 and became the leading Scottish {{portrait}} painter of his generation. Among his best known works are a <b>group</b> <b>of</b> <b>about</b> 30 oval bust-lengths, including a self-portrait, in Surgeons' Hall, Edinburgh. He trained his son, also John, and William Aikman (1682–1731), who became the leading Scottish portrait-painter of the next generation. Aikman migrated to London in 1723, and from this point until the late eighteenth century, most Scottish painters of note followed him.|$|E

5|$|Although the {{battalion}} undertook {{a series of}} local patrols after this, the fighting around Parramatta constituted {{the last of the}} 2/10th's major actions of the war. After the hostilities ended in mid-August following Japan's surrender, {{the battalion}}'s personnel were slowly repatriated back to Australia in drafts for demobilisation and discharge. Some chose to remain in the Army, with a <b>group</b> <b>of</b> <b>about</b> 70 being transferred to other units for subsequent service in the 34th Brigade, which had been formed to undertake occupation duties in Japan as part of the British Commonwealth Occupation Force. The battalion was finally disbanded on 29 December 1945 while still at Balikpapan; upon disbandment there were only 42 members of the battalion left for the 2/10th's final parade, during which the battalion flag was entrusted to the Militia 10th Battalion, which had served briefly in a garrison role in Australia during the war and which was subsequently re-raised in South Australia after the war.|$|E
5|$|Anderson {{arrived at}} the guerrilla camp and {{described}} the day's events, the brutality of which unsettled Todd. By mid-afternoon, the 39th Missouri Volunteer Infantry had arrived in Centralia. From the town, they saw a <b>group</b> <b>of</b> <b>about</b> 120 guerrillas and pursued them. The guerrillas heard that the cavalry was approaching, and Anderson sent a party to set an ambush. They drew the Union troops {{to the top of}} a hill; a group of guerrillas led by Anderson had been stationed at the bottom and other guerrillas hid nearby. Anderson then led a charge up the hill. Although five guerrillas were killed by the first volley of Union fire, the Union soldiers were quickly overwhelmed by the well-armed guerrillas, and those who fled were pursued. One Union officer reached Centralia and gave word of the ambush, allowing a few Union soldiers who had remained there to escape. However, most were hunted down and killed; Anderson's men mutilated the bodies of the dead soldiers and tortured some survivors.|$|E
5|$|By mid-afternoon {{of the day}} of the programme, protesters {{had begun}} {{gathering}} outside Television Centre and there were also protesters outside regional BBC offices. By 4.30pm (BST) police estimated there were 500 chanting protesters; around 25 people who reached the main entrance of Television Centre after breaking through a cordon were expelled. They were part of a <b>group</b> <b>of</b> <b>about</b> 40 people that had made a dash for an iron gate that had been left open. After this breach, stand-by officers reinforced the police cordon and protesters moved to block Wood Lane, hoping to prevent Griffin entering the studios. Griffin arrived at 5.17pm unnoticed and entered on foot through a rear entrance on Frithville Road. It was reported that around 600 people had turned up to protest against Griffin.|$|E

5|$|By {{the end of}} March {{or early}} in April 1916, the British {{presence}} in the Sinai was growing; 16 miles (26km) of track, including sidings, had been laid. Between 21 March and 11 April, the water sources at Wady Um Muksheib, Moya Harab and Jifjafa along the central Sinai route from southern Palestine were destroyed. In 1915, they had {{been used by the}} central <b>group</b> <b>of</b> <b>about</b> 6,000 or 7,000 Ottoman soldiers who moved across the Sinai Desert to attack the Suez Canal at Ismailia. Without these wells and cisterns, the central route could no longer be used by large forces.|$|E
5|$|By {{the seventeenth}} century the fashion for {{portraiture}} had spread down the social order to lairds such as Colin Campbell of Glenorchy and John Napier of Merchiston. The first significant native artist was George Jamesone of Aberdeen (1589/90-1644), who, having trained in the Netherlands, {{became one of the}} most successful portrait painters of the reign of Charles I. He trained the Baroque artist John Michael Wright (1617–94), who painted both Scottish and English subjects. The Flemish-Spanish painter John Baptist Medina (1659–1710) came to Scotland in 1693 and became the leading Scottish portrait painter of his generation. Among his best known works are a <b>group</b> <b>of</b> <b>about</b> 30 oval bust-lengths, including a self-portrait, in Surgeons' Hall, Edinburgh.
