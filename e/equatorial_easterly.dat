40|$|An open-ocean {{thermocline}} dome {{south of}} the equator is a striking feature of the Indian Ocean (IO) {{as a result of}} equatorial westerly winds. Over the thermocline dome, the El Nino-forced Rossby waves help sustain the IO basin (IOB) mode and offer climate predictability for the IO and surrounding countries. This study shows that a common <b>equatorial</b> <b>easterly</b> wind bias, by forcing a westward-propagating downwelling Rossby wave in the southern IO, induces too deep a thermocline dome over the southwestern IO (SWIO) in state-of-the-art climate models. Such a deep SWIO thermocline weakens the influence of subsurface variability on sea surface temperature (SST), reducing the IOB amplitude and possibly limiting the models' skill of regional climate prediction. To the extent that the <b>equatorial</b> <b>easterly</b> wind bias originates from errors of the South Asian summer monsoon, improving the monsoon simulation can lead to substantial improvements in simulating and predicting interannual variability in the IO...|$|E
40|$|The {{atmospheric}} {{heating and}} sea surface temperature (SST) anomalies during the mature phase of El Niño are observed to show both {{eastern and western}} Pacific anomaly patterns, with positive anomalies in the equatorial eastern/central Pacific and negative anomalies in the off-equatorial western Pacific. The detailed spatial patterns of the heating anomalies differ from the SST anomalies. The heating anomalies are more equatorially confined than the SST anomalies, and maxima {{of positive and negative}} heating anomalies are located farther to the west than the SST anomalies. The Gill–Zebiak atmospheric model assumes that the atmospheric initial heating has the same spatial patterns as the SST anomalies. This assumption results in some unrealistic model simulations for El Niño. When the model heating anomaly forcing is modified to resemble the observed heating anomalies during the mature phase of El Niño, the model simulations have been improved to 1) successfully simulate <b>equatorial</b> <b>easterly</b> wind anomalies in the western Pacific, 2) correctly simulate the position of maximum westerly wind anomalies, and 3) reduce unrealistic easterly wind anomalies in the off-equatorial eastern Pacific. This paper shows that off-equatorial western Pacific negative atmospheric heating (or cold SST) anomalies are important in producing <b>equatorial</b> <b>easterly</b> wind anomalies in the western Pacific. These off-equatorial cold SST anomalie...|$|E
40|$|The Atlantic Niño, an {{equatorial}} zonal mode {{akin to the}} Pacific El Niño–Southern Oscillation (ENSO), is phase-locked to boreal {{summer when}} the <b>equatorial</b> <b>easterly</b> winds intensify and the thermocline shoals in the Gulf of Guinea. A suite of satellite and in situ observations reveals a new mode of tropical Atlantic variability that displays many characteristics of the zonal mode but instead peaks in November–December (ND). This new mode {{is found to be}} statistically independent from both the Atlantic Niño in the preceding summer and the Pacific ENSO. The origin of this ND zonal mode lies in an overlooked aspect of the seasonal cycle in the equatorial Atlantic. In November the <b>equatorial</b> <b>easterly</b> winds intensify for the second time, increasing upwelling and lifting the thermocline in the Gulf of Guinea. An analysis of high-resolution climatological data shows that these dynamical changes induce a noticeable SST cooling in the central equatorial Atlantic. The shoaling thermocline and increased upwelling enhance the SST sensitivity to surface wind changes, reinvigorating equatorial ocean–atmosphere interaction. The resultant ocean–atmospheric anomalies are organized into patterns that give rise to positive mutual feedback as Bjerknes envisioned for the Pacific ENSO. This ND zonal mode significantly affects interannual rainfall variability in coastal Congo–Angola during its early rainy season. It tends to further evolve into a meridional mode in the following March–April, affecting precipitation in northeast Brazil. Thus it offers potential predictability for climate over the Atlantic sector in early boreal winter, a season for which local ocean–atmosphere variability was otherwise poorly understood. 1...|$|E

The SAMS data are shown to confirm the seasonal asymmetry in semiannual wind regimes previously noted in rocketsonde observations near the equator. Two explanations for the asymmetry are considered: (1) an improved Kelvin and gravity wave transmissivity in stronger <b>equatorial</b> <b>easterlies</b> (resulting from planetary Rossby wave momentum transport), implying stronger westerly mean flow acceleration in the first cycle than in the second; and (2) evidence of strong polar-tropical coupling in the northern winter indicating that mean meridional circulations are present on a global scale...|$|R
40|$|Data from 1953 to {{the present}} {{indicate}} that major warmings in the Northern Hemisphere winter have not occurred when the equatorial monthly mean zonal winds are deep westerly (i. e., westerly over more than about 5 / 8 of the 10 - 85 mb layer). Sixteen winters have had a major warming in the last 35 years. Six January-February periods had deep equatorial westerlies but did not experience a major warming. Major warmings do not require deep <b>equatorial</b> <b>easterlies,</b> nor is the occurrence of a major warming significantly correlated with {{the sign of the}} zonal mean wind at any particular level between 10 and 50 mb, although {{more than half of the}} observed major warmings have occurred when the <b>equatorial</b> flow is <b>easterly</b> at a given level between 10 and 50 mb. A more relevant quasi-biennial oscillation (QBO) statistic may be found in the depth of QBO wind regimes.

40|$|The {{dynamical}} {{state of}} the stratosphere influenced by radiative heating, with no internal sources or sinks of angular momentum, is examined. It is shown that there exists a nonlinear Hadley regime driven by antisymmetric (or more generally, asymmetric) thermal equilibria typical of the middle atmosphere at the solstices. This regime consists of a single mean meridional cell, <b>equatorial</b> <b>easterlies,</b> and strong winter westerlies. Outside of the circulation region the flow is in thermal equilibrium. The effect of one-sided friction, acting as a drag on midlatitude westerlies only, is to expand the Hadley cell into the winter hemisphere and increase the magnitude of cross-equatorial flow. This result is possible even in the steady state when the advection of angular momentum in the tropics is made small by reducing the gradient of angular momentum in this region instead of the advecting velocity...|$|R
40|$|Observations of {{sea surface}} {{temperature}} (SST), sea level pressure (SLP), surface wind, and outgoing longwave radiation (OLR) {{show that the}} El Nino-Southern Oscillation (ENSO) displays western Pacific anomaly patterns in addition to eastern Pacific anomaly patterns. During the warm phase of ENSO, warm;SST and low SLP anomalies in the equatorial eastern Pacific and low OLR anomalies in the equatorial central Pacific are accompanied by cold SST and high SLP anomalies in the off-equatorial western Pacific and high OLR anomalies in the off-equatorial far western Pacific. Also, while the zonal wind anomalies over the equatorial central Pacific are westerly, those over the equatorial far western Pacific are easterly. The nearly out-of-phase behavior between the eastern and western tropical Pacific is also observed during the cold phase of ENSO, but with anomalies of opposite sign. These western Pacific interannual anomaly patterns are robust features of ENSO, independent of data sets. It is argued that <b>equatorial</b> <b>easterly</b> (westerly) wind anomalies over the far western Pacific during the warm (cold) phase of ENSO are initiated by off-equatorial western Pacific cold (warm) SST anomalies, and that these winds are important {{for the evolution of}} ENSO. An atmosphere model is employed to demonstrate that small off-equatorial western Pacific cold (warm) SST anomalies (compared to those in the east) are sufficient to produce <b>equatorial</b> <b>easterly</b> (westerly) wind anomalies as observed over the far western Pacific. The coupled ocean-atmosphere model of Zebiak and Cane is then modified to investigate the evolution of the western Pacific interannual anomaly patterns in a coupled ocean-atmosphere system, by including a meridional structure to the subsurface temperature parameterization in the western Pacific. The modified model produces both western and eastern Pacific interannual anomaly patterns...|$|E

This analysis reveals a typical <b>equatorial</b> <b>easterly</b> circulation, with mean meridional circulation becoming significant only above 96 km. A periodogram analysis shows the diurnal tide to be the most significant feature of the wind field at these altitudes, with zonal amplitudes up to some 50 m/s and meridional amplitudes approximately half this value. The semidiurnal tide is well developed in both zonal and meridional directions only above 96 km.

40|$|Long-standing biases {{of climate}} models limit {{the skills of}} climate {{prediction}} and projection. Overlooked are tropical Indian Ocean (IO) errors. Based on the Coupled Model Intercomparison Project Phase 5 (CMIP 5) multi-model ensemble, the present study identifies a common error pattern in climate models that resembles the IO Dipole (IOD) mode of interannual variability in nature, with a strong <b>equatorial</b> <b>easterly</b> wind bias during boreal autumn accompanied by physically consistent biases in precipitation, sea surface temperature (SST), and subsurface ocean temperature. The analyses show that such IOD-like biases {{can be traced back}} to errors in the South Asian summer monsoon. Too weak a southwest summer monsoon over the Arabian Sea generates a warm SST bias over the western equatorial IO. In boreal autumn, Bjerknes feedback helps amplify the error into an IOD-like bias pattern in wind, precipitation, SST, and subsurface ocean temperature. Such mean state biases result in too strong interannual IOD variability. Most models project an IOD-like future change for the boreal autumn mean state in the global warming scenario, which woul...|$|E
40|$|Coupled general {{circulation}} model (GCM) simulations {{participating in the}} Coupled Model Intercomparison Project Phase 5 (CMIP 5) are analyzed {{with respect to their}} performance in the equatorial Atlantic. In terms of the mean state, 29 out of 33 models examined continue to suffer from serious biases including an annual mean zonal equatorial SST gradient whose sign is opposite to observations. Westerly surface wind biases in boreal spring play an important role by deepening the thermocline in the eastern equatorial Atlantic and thus reducing upwelling efficiency and SST cooling in the following months. Both magnitude and seasonal evolution of the biases are very similar to what was found previously for CMIP 3 models, indicating that improvements have only been modest. The weaker than observed <b>equatorial</b> <b>easterlies</b> are also simulated by atmospheric GCMs forced with observed SST. They are related to both continental convection and the latitudinal position of the Intertropical Convergence Zone (ITCZ).

Computations are also made to examine how the model wave disturbances in the wavenumber frequency domain are maintained by nonlinear interactions. Results are compared with observation. It is found that <b>equatorial</b> <b>easterlies</b> do not show up in this climate experiment at 200 mb. The zonal kinetic energy and momentum transport of stationary waves are too small in the model's Northern Hemisphere. The wavenumber and frequency spectra of the model are generally in good agreement with observation. However, some distinct features of the model's spectra are revealed. The wavenumber spectra of kinetic energy show that the eastward moving waves of low wavenumbers have stronger zonal motion while the eastward moving waves of intermediate wavenumbers have larger meridional motion compared with observation. Furthermore, the eastward moving waves show a band of large spectral value in the medium frequency regime...|$|R
40|$|The {{impact of}} {{variations}} of the Walker cell on the ocean carbon cycle is assessed using a coupled climate model. Idealized wind perturbations are investigated, with the trade winds increased/decreased by 10 %, 20 %, and 30 %. A global-mean reduction in oceanic carbon storage is found for increased <b>equatorial</b> <b>easterlies,</b> while moderately decreased trade winds give increased uptake. There is a nonlinear response to weakened tropical winds due to Pacific Ocean biological pump changes; with reduced nutrient upwelling resulting in decreased biological activity and remineralization in the deep ocean. This partially offsets the increased carbon uptake due to weaker trade winds. The overall change in net carbon storage reaches - 26. 2 PgC (12 ppm) in the 30 % increase case and 4. 2 PgC (- 2 ppm) in the 20 % decrease cases. Regional dissolved inorganic carbon (DIC) changes reach - 3. 3 mmol m(- 3) (2. 1 mmol m(- 3)) in the 10 % decrease (increase) case.

40|$|The recent Indian Ocean (IO) {{warming and}} its {{relation}} with the El Niño Southern Oscillation (ENSO) is investigated using available ocean and atmospheric reanalyses. By comparing the events before and after 1976 (identified as a threshold separating earlier and recent decades with respect to global warming trends), our {{results indicate that the}} IO had experienced a distinct change in the warming pattern. After 1976, during the boreal summer season the cold anomalies in the IO were replaced by warm anomalies in both warm (El Niño) and cold (La Niña) ENSO events. Strong sinking by upper level winds and the associated anomalous <b>equatorial</b> <b>easterly</b> winds created favourable conditions for the IO warming from 90 °E towards the western IO. Our study highlights that after 1976, atmospheric and oceanic fields changed mostly during La Niña, with both ENSO phases contributing to the warming of the IO. Warm anomalies of 0. 2 °C are seen over large areas of the IO in the post- 1976 La Niña composites. Our analysis suggests that the IO warming during La Niña events after 1976 may have a relation to the warm anomalies persisting from the preceding strong El Niño events...|$|E
40|$|The {{question}} of whether and how tropical Indian Ocean dipole or zonal mode (IOZM) interannual variability is independent of El Niño–Southern Oscillation (ENSO) variability in the Pacific is addressed in a comparison of twin 200 -yr runs of a coupled climate model. The first is a reference simulation, and the second has ENSO-scale variability suppressed with a constraint on the tropical Pacific wind stress. The IOZM can exist in the model without ENSO, and the composite evolution of the main anomalies in the Indian Ocean in the two simulations is virtually identical. Its growth depends on a positive feedback between anomalous <b>equatorial</b> <b>easterly</b> winds, upwelling equatorial and coastal Kelvin waves reducing the thermocline depth and sea surface temperature {{off the coast of}} Sumatra, and the atmospheric dynamical response to the subsequently reduced convection. Two IOZM triggers in the boreal spring are found. The first is an anomalous Hadley circulation over the eastern tropical Indian Ocean and Maritime Continent, with an early northward penetration of the Southern Hemisphere southeasterly trades. This situation grows out of cooler sea surface temperatures in the southeastern tropical Indian Ocean left behind by a reinforcement of the late austral summer winds. The second trigger is a consequence of a zonal shift in the center of convection associated with a developing E...|$|E
40|$|International audienceTen-year-long output series from {{a general}} {{circulation}} model forced by daily realistic winds {{are used to}} analyze the annual cycle of the Equatorial Undercurrent (EUC) in the Atlantic Ocean. Two well-defined transport maxima are found: One, present during boreal summer and autumn in {{the central part of the}} basin, is generally recognized and regarded as a near-equilibrium response to the <b>equatorial</b> <b>easterly</b> trades that culminate in this period. Another one, most pronounced near the western boundary, occurs in April–May when the trades relax. This second maximum is less patent in the observations, but concomitant signals in previously published analyses of the North Brazil Current and surface velocity seasonal variations might be indirect manifestations of its reality. Because this intensification appears at periods when the boundary between the tropical and equatorial gyres nears the equator, the authors relate its existence to wind stress curl variations at subequatorial latitudes. A link between the interannual variability of the spring transport maximum and that of the low-latitude wind stress curl is, indeed, found in the model. This diagnostic approach suggests that two different dynamical regimes shape up the EUC seasonal cycle: in summer and autumn, local forcing by the equatorial zonal wind component and main supply from the ocean interior; in winter and spring, remote forcing by the low-latitude rotational wind component and supply from the western boundary currents...|$|E
40|$|The {{record of}} eolian {{deposition}} on the Ontong Java Plateau (OJP) since the Oligocene (approximately 33 Ma) {{has been investigated}} using dust grain size, dust flux, and dust mineralogy, {{with the goal of}} interpreting the paleoclimatology and paleometeorology of the western equatorial Pacific. Studies of modern dust dispersal in the Pacific have indicated that the equatorial regions receive contributions from both the Northern Hemisphere westerly winds and the equatorial easterlies; limited meteorological data suggest that low-altitude westerlies could also transport dust to OJP from proximal sources in the western Pacific. Previous studies have established the characteristics of the grain-size, flux, and mineralogy records of dust deposited in the North Pacific by the mid-latitude westerlies and in the eastern equatorial Pacific by the low-latitude easterlies since the Oligocene. By comparing the OJP records with the well-defined records of the mid-latitude westerlies and the low-latitude easterlies, the importance of multiple sources of dust to OJP can be recognized. OJP dust is composed of quartz, illite, kaolinite/chlorite, plagioclase feldspar, smectite, and heulandite. Mineral abundance profiles and principal components analysis (PCA) of the mineral abundance data have been used to identify assemblages of minerals that covary through {{all or part of the}} OJP record. Abundances of quartz, illite, and kaolinite/chlorite covary throughout the interval studied, defining a mineralogical assemblage supplied from Asia. Some plagioclase and smectite were also supplied as part of this assemblage during the late Miocene and Pliocene/Pleistocene, but other source areas have supplied significant amounts of plagioclase, smectite, and heulandite to OJP since the Oligocene. OJP dust is generally coarser than dust deposited by the Northern Hemisphere westerlies or the <b>equatorial</b> <b>easterlies,</b> and it accumulates more rapidly by 1 - 2 orders of magnitude. These relationships indicate the importance of the local sources on dust deposition at OJP. The grain-size and flux records of OJP dust do not exhibit most of the events observed in the corresponding records of the Northern Hemisphere westerlies or the <b>equatorial</b> <b>easterlies,</b> because these features are masked by the mixing of dust from several sources at OJP. The abundance record of the Asian dust assemblage at OJP, however, does contain most of the features characteristic of dust flux by means of the Northern Hemisphere westerlies, indicating that the paleoclimatic and paleometeorologic signal of a particular source area and wind system can be preserved in areas well beyond the region dominated by that source and those winds. Identifying such a signal requires "unmixing" the various dust assemblages, which can be accomplished by combining grain-size, flux, and mineralogic data...|$|R

These transports are first employed to calculate the meridional divergence at different longitudes all across the ocean and then added up (starting from the African coast) to compute the cumulative transports. This cumulative divergent transport shows up to be comparable in size to the water transport by the Equatorial Undercurrent (EUC). This result emphasizes the large‐scale coupling between the <b>equatorial</b> <b>easterlies</b> and the ocean response: the winds build up pressure at the western margin, which is {{the origin of the}} EUC, and accommodate this zonal flow through the meridional Ekman divergence, the fate of the EUC. Our results also reveal substantial seasonal variability related to the meridional displacement of the Inter‐Tropical Convergence Zone (ITCZ). The ITCZ attains its northernmost position in August and September, allowing southern high pressures at about 32 °W to enter the Equatorial region.

40|$|International audienceClimate models {{participating}} in the third Coupled Model Inter Comparison Project (CMIP 3) suggest {{a significant increase in}} the transport of the New Guinea Coastal Undercurrent (NGCU) and the Equatorial Undercurrent (EUC, in the central and western Pacific) and a decrease in the Mindanao current and the Indonesian Throughflow. Most models also project a reduction in the strength of the equatorial Trade winds. Typically, on ENSO time scales, a weakening of the <b>equatorial</b> <b>easterlies</b> would lead to a reduction in EUC strength in the central Pacific. The strengthening of the EUC projected for longer timescales, can be explained by a robust projected intensification of the south-easterly trade winds and an associated off-equatorial wind-stress curl change in the Southern Hemisphere. This drives the intensification of the NGCU and greater water input to the EUC in the west. A 1 ½-layer shallow water model, driven by projected wind stress trends from the CMIP 3 models demonstrates that the projected circulation changes are consistent with a purely wind driven response. While the equatorial winds weaken for both El Niño events and in the projections, the ocean response and the mechanisms driving the projected wind changes are distinct from those operating on interannual timescales...|$|R
40|$|Hurricane and {{tropical}} storm statistics verify the modulation of eastern Pacific tropical systems by the Madden– Julian oscillation (MJO) as hypothesized by Maloney and Hartmann. Over {{twice as many}} named tropical systems (hurricanes {{and tropical}} storms) accompany equatorial 850 -mb westerly anomalies than accompany <b>equatorial</b> <b>easterly</b> anomalies, and the systems that do exist are stronger. Hurricanes are over four times more numerous during westerly phases of the MJO than during easterly phases. The current study constructs a composite life cycle of the MJO during May–November 1979 – 95 using an index based on the 850 -mb equatorial zonal wind. Equatorial Kelvin waves propagating eastward from convective regions of the western Pacific Ocean alter dynamical conditions over the eastern Pacific Ocean. Westerly (easterly) equatorial 850 -mb wind anomalies are accompanied by enhanced (suppressed) convection over the eastern Pacific hurricane region. Convection locally amplifies the wind anomalies over the eastern Pacific. Cyclonic horizontal shear of the low-level zonal wind and low vertical wind shear support tropical cyclogenesis. Periods of equatorial 850 -mb westerly wind anomalies associated with the MJO are accompanied by cyclonic low-level relative vorticity anomalies and near-zero vertical wind shear over the eastern Pacific hurricane region. Easterly periods are accompanied by anticyclonic vorticity anomalies and less-favorable vertical wind shear. The vorticity anomalies are associated with variations in the meridional shear of the zonal wind. 1...|$|E
40|$|We {{found that}} the {{adjacent}} continental monsoons (i. e., Asian-Australian monsoons and American monsoons) play important roles on rectifying the mean state and annual cycle of the equatorial Pacific (Fu and Wang 2003) with an intermediate air-sea-land coupled model. Without the effects of adjacent continental monsoons, the simulated mean SST in the western-central Pacific displays a warm bias; the SST annual cycle in the equatorial eastern Pacific exhibits an insufficient strength and two-month phase delay. The Asian-Australian monsoons act to cool {{the water in the}} equatorial western-central Pacific through enhancing the strength of the trades, thus drawing the model SST closer to the observations. The South American monsoon exerts profound impacts on the annual variations of the southeast trades, thus is an important external forcing of the SST annual cycle in the eastern Pacific. Through examining the outputs of 10 AGCMs, we further {{found that the}} <b>equatorial</b> <b>easterly</b> is systematically enhanced in almost all the models. The exaggerated easterly is primarily caused by too strong monsoons in the west of the Pacific basin and too weak monsoons in the east of the basin. The monsoon-error-induced wind bias in the equatorial Pacific could considerably cool the ocean after invoking the Bjerknes ’ positive atmosphere-ocean feedback (Jin 1998). Therefore, the cold biases existing in some CGCMs could be a projection of the systematic errors in representing the adjacent monsoon systems...|$|E

Warm eastern equatorial Pacific (EEqP) sea surface temperature anomalies (SSTAs) exceeded 4 °C {{at the event}} peak and lasted well into boreal spring of 1998, even though subsurface temperatures began cooling in December 1997. The oceanic processes that controlled this unusual termination are explored here and can be characterized by three features: (i) eastward propagating equatorial Pacific thermocline (Z tc) shoaling beginning in the central Pacific in November 1997; (ii) persistent warm EEqP SSTA between December 1997 and May 1998, despite strong EEqP Z tc shoaling (and subsurface cooling); and (iii) an abrupt cooling of EEqP SSTA in early May 1998 that exceeded 4 °C within two weeks.

The objective is to gain understanding of causes of climate variability and climate change by relating mechanisms that operate on timescales ranging from the intraseasonal to the glacial^interglacial. Our results suggest that, on all timescales, the climatic conditions on the Altiplano {{are closely related to}} the upper-air circulation, with an easterly zonal flow aloft favoring wet conditions and westerly flow causing dry conditions.

The annual cycle of dry winter and wet summer conditions is caused by the seasonal expansion of the <b>equatorial</b> <b>easterlies</b> in the upper troposphere, rather than direct insolation forcing over the Altiplano or moisture changes in the source area. Interannual variability is primarily related to changes in the mean zonal flow over the Altiplano, reflecting changes in meridional baroclinicity between tropical and subtropical latitudes, which in turn is a response to sea-surface temperature changes in the tropical Pacific.

40|$|Persistent superrotation {{is seen in}} the atmospheres {{of other}} {{terrestrial}} bodies (Venus, Titan) but not in that of present Earth, which is distinguished by <b>equatorial</b> <b>easterlies.</b> Nevertheless, superrotation has appeared in numerical simulations of Earth’s atmosphere, from two-layer models to multilevel comprehensive GCMs. Simulations of warm climates that generate enhanced tropical convective variability seem particularly prone to superrotation, which has led to hypotheses that the warmer atmospheres of the early Pliocene and Eocene may have been superrotating, and that the phenomenon may be relevant to future climate projections. This paper considers a positive feedback leading to superrotation based on an equatorial wave resonance that occurs in a westerly background flow. The authors present simulations with an idealized multilevel GCM forced with a zonally varying equatorial heating, which show abrupt transitions to strongly superrotating states. Linear shallow water theory is used to show that these transitions occur as the superrotating jet velocity approaches the phase speed of free equatorial Rossby wave modes, leading to a resonant amplification of the response to eddy heating and its associated equatorward momentum flux. The resonance and transition are most prominent in simulations where the meridional temperature gradient has been reduced, and hysteresis behavior is seen when the gradient is eliminated completely. No evidence is found in these simulations for the midlatitude wave feedback believed to drive abrupt transitions in two-layer models, and there is only a minor role for the axisymmetric feedback based on vertical advection by the Hadley circulation. 1...|$|R

One of the most prominent endeavours in this respect was ARTHUR BERSON’s aerological expedition to East Africa. Although the main target was the East African monsoon circulation, the expedition provided also other insights that profoundly changed meteorology and climatology. BERSON observed that the tropical tropopause was much higher and colder than that over midlatitudes. Moreover, westerly winds were observed in the lower stratosphere, apparently contradicting the high-altitude <b>equatorial</b> <b>easterly</b> winds that were known since the Krakatoa eruption (‘‘Krakatoa easterlies’’). The puzzle was only resolved five decades later with the discovery of the Quasi-Biennial Oscillation (QBO). In this paper we briefly summarize the expedition of BERSON and review the results in a historical context and in the light of the current research. In the second part of the paper we re-visit BERSON’s early aerological observations, which we have digitized. We compare the observed wind profiles with corresponding profiles extracted from the ‘‘Twentieth Century Reanalysis’’, which provides global three-dimensional weather information back to 1871 based on an assimilation of sea-level and surface pressure data. The comparison shows a good agreement at the coast but less good agreement further inland, at the shore of Lake Victoria, where the circulation is more complex.

40|$|This paper {{investigates the}} {{structure}} and dynamics of the Equatorial Undercurrent (EUC) of the Indian Ocean by analyzing in situ observations and reanalysis data and performing ocean model experiments using an ocean general circulation model and a linear continuously stratified ocean model. The {{results show that the}} EUC regularly occurs in each boreal winter and spring, particularly during February and April, consistent with existing studies. The EUC generally has a core depth near the 20 degrees C isotherm and can be present across the equatorial basin. The EUC reappears during summer-fall of most years, with core depth located at different longitudes and depths. In the western basin, the EUC results primarily from equatorial Kelvin and Rossby waves directly forced by <b>equatorial</b> <b>easterly</b> winds. In the central and eastern basin, however, reflected Rossby waves from the eastern boundary play a crucial role. While the first two baroclinic modes make the largest contribution, intermediate modes 3 - 8 are also important. The summer-fall EUC tends to occur in the western basin but exhibits obvious interannual variability in the eastern basin. During positive Indian Ocean dipole (IOD) years, the eastern basin EUC results largely from Rossby waves reflected from the eastern boundary, with directly forced Kelvin and Rossby waves also having significant contributions. However, the eastern basin EUC disappears during negative IOD and normal years because westerly wind anomalies force a westward pressure gradient force and thus westward subsurface current, which cancels the eastward subsurface flow induced by eastern boundary-reflected Rossby waves. Interannual variability of zonal equatorial wind that drives the EUC variability is dominated by the zonal sea surface temperature (SST) gradients associated with IOD and is much less influenced by equatorial wind associated with Indian monsoon rainfall strength...|$|E

A 20 ?yr loop of the global tropopause, defined in terms of potential vorticity (PV), is constructed using the NCEP?NCAR reanalysis dataset. This method of visualizing observed upper?tropospheric dynamics is useful for studying a wide range of phenomena. Examples are given of the structure of jet streams and planetary?scale tropopause folds, the propagation of a high?amplitude Rossby wave packet partway around a hemisphere, several subtropical wave breaking events, the similarities between exceptional cases of rapid cyclogenesis, favorable regions for cross?equatorial propagation of Rossby waves, the annual cycle of the tropical tropopause, the structure of the Tibetan anticyclone and <b>equatorial</b> <b>easterly</b> jet associated with the Asian monsoon, the meridional structure of the upper branch of the Hadley cell, the interaction of a hurricane and midlatitude trough to form the "perfect storm," and the upper?tropospheric PV changes associated with El Ni?o and La Ni?a. Plumes of anticyclonic potential vorticity are frequently seen to be pulled from the subtropical reservoir and roll up into large anticyclones. These previously undescribed plumes may be particularly relevant to jet streak dynamics and stratosphere?troposphere exchange. National Science Foundatio...|$|E
40|$|Climate models {{participating}} in the third Coupled Model Inter Comparison Project (CMIP 3) suggest {{a significant increase in}} the transport of the New Guinea Coastal Undercurrent (NGCU) and the Equatorial Undercurrent (EUC, in the central and western Pacific) and a decrease in the Mindanao current and the Indonesian Throughflow. Most models also project a reduction in the strength of the equatorial Trade winds. Typically, on ENSO time scales, a weakening of the <b>equatorial</b> <b>easterlies</b> would lead to a reduction in EUC strength in the central Pacific. The strengthening of the EUC projected for longer timescales, can be explained by a robust projected intensification of the south-easterly trade winds and an associated off-equatorial wind-stress curl change in the Southern Hemisphere. This drives the intensification of the NGCU and greater water input to the EUC in the west. A 1 1 / 2 -layer shallow water model, driven by projected wind stress trends from the CMIP 3 models demonstrates that the projected circulation changes are consistent with a purely wind driven response. While the equatorial winds weaken for both El Nino events and in the projections, the ocean response and the mechanisms driving the projected wind changes are distinct from those operating on interannual timescales.

40|$|Simply {{applying}} the divergence operator to the horizontal velocity equation in spherical-isobaric coordinates yields a more solvable linear geopotential equation (than the geopotential tendency and the omega equations) for diagnosing the geopotential and its anomalies responsible for global floods and droughts. This geopotential model is {{freed from the}} zero-denominator problem caused by the observed neutral stability which affects the geopotential tendency and omega equations. The geopotential equation's forcing terms 2 - 5 (the direct operation results of the horizontal advection term in the velocity equation) can identify the synoptic signals mixed up by the classical divergence equation's quadratic and Jacobian terms (the manipulated results of the above terms 2 - 5). Solving this geopotential equation with the successive-over-relaxation method and the neutral stability as calculated from the reanalysis data produces reasonably good reconstructions of the global and local geopotential fields. The additional advantages of the present geopotential model over the geopotential tendency. omega and divergence models are that the geopotential model reveals and explains the following mechanisms which received less attention in previous studies. (1) The saddle patterns favour the high systems. (2) The <b>equatorial</b> <b>easterlies</b> favour the low systems. (3) The contributions of ageostrophic processes associated with jets and saddle flows to the transitions of weather patterns might be overlooked by the geopotential tendency model in which neutral stability and static instability in cold domes as well as jet-induced inertial instability are smoothed out artificially.

40|$|We {{have found}} {{repeated}} illustrations in the maps of Total Tropospheric Ozone (TTO) of apparent transport of ozone from the Indian Ocean to the Equatorial Atlantic Ocean. Most interesting are examples that {{coincide with the}} INDOEX observations of late northern winter, 1999. Three soundings associated with the SHADOZ (Southern Hemisphere Additional Ozonesondes) network help confirm and quantify degree of influence of pollution, lightning, and stratospheric sources, suggesting that perhaps 40 % of increased Atlantic ozone could be Asian pollution during periods of maximum identified in the TTO maps. We outline recurrent periods of apparent ozone transport from Indian to Atlantic Ocean regions both during and outside the late-winter period. These are placed {{in the context of}} some general observations about factors controlling recurrence timescales for the expression of both equatorial and subtropical plumes. Low-level subtropical plumes are often controlled by frontal systems approaching the Namib coast; these direct mid-level air into either <b>easterly</b> <b>equatorial</b> plumes or westerly mid- troposphere plumes. Equatorial plumes of ozone cross Africa on an easterly path due to the occasional coincidence of two phenomena: (1) lofting of ozone to mid and upper levels, often in the Western Indian Ocean, and (2) the eastward extension of an <b>Equatorial</b> African <b>easterly</b> jet...|$|R
40|$|The {{relationship}} between Indian Ocean sea surface temperature and {{the transition of}} El Nino events into either La Nina or El Nino-Southern Oscillation neutral conditions is examined in both observations and the retrospective ensemble hindcasts of the National Center for Environmental Prediction Climate Forecast System. The southern Indian Ocean is shown to demonstrate a particularly robust and consistent relationship with the evolution of these transitions. These associations are described, and a physical mechanism involving air-sea interaction in the Indian and western Pacific Oceans is proposed. Observations suggest that easterly surface wind anomalies in the western Pacific Ocean {{are associated with the}} emergence of La Nina during boreal summer and fall. Here it is shown that these winds are significantly correlated to southern Indian Ocean sea surface temperature in the preceding spring that is characterized by a large-scale zonal dipole of cool and warm anomalies in the southwestern and southeastern Indian Oceans, respectively. These associations are particularly pronounced for strong El Nino conditions, during the dissipation of which a pronounced wavetrain-like atmospheric pattern accompanies sea surface temperature anomalies in the southern Indian Ocean. Together, the circulation and sea surface temperature anomalies increase the meridional cross-equatorial temperature gradient in the western Indian Ocean and mute intraseasonal variability while strengthening surface <b>equatorial</b> <b>easterly</b> winds in the Indo-Pacific warm pool. Collectively, these anomalies favor subsequent La Nina development. On the basis of these observed associations, a predictive model that demonstrates skill in anticipating the nature of El Nino transitions, involving the southern Indian Ocean, Asian monsoon, and El Nino-Southern Oscillation, is proposed. In the National Center for Environmental Prediction Climate Forecast System, the relationships described above are simulated both consistently and realistically, despite model weaknesses, further bolstering a key role of southern Indian Ocean and predictive relationship. Comparison of fully coupled and sea surface temperature-forced simulations suggests a key role for air-sea interaction in the observed associations. Moreover, it is demonstrated that coupled simulations of El Nino-Southern Oscillation may benefit substantially from improved representation of Indian Ocean variability and Indo-Pacific interaction...|$|E
40|$|Westerly wind events (WWEs) in {{the western}} {{equatorial}} Pacific have previously been shown to cause significant warming of sea surface temperature (SST) in the eastern equatorial Pacific. Observational sta-tistics compiled during and prior to the large El Niño event of 1997 / 98 link WWEs to substantial (up to 38 C) warming in the eastern Pacific cold tongue region. Since 1998, however, relatively little WWE-related cold tongue warming has been observed, and warm equatorial Pacific SST anomalies (SSTAs) {{have tended to be}} trapped near the date line rather than extending to the American coast as in a classical El Niño–Southern Oscillation (ENSO) composite. Here, the relationship between WWEs and cold tongue warming is revisited using in situ and operational forecast winds and in situ and satellite-based SST. Significant differences are found in the basin-scale zonal wind anomalies associated with WWEs that occurred before and after 1997 / 98. Although the post- 1997 / 98 composite WWE westerly anomalies are very similar to their predecessors within theWWE regions, conditions east of theWWE regions are different; there are enhanced <b>equatorial</b> <b>easterlies</b> in the post- 1997 / 98 cases. General ocean circulation model experiments are conducted to explore {{the extent to which the}} observed changes in the character of post- 1997 / 98 WWEs can explain the recent behavior of cold tongue SSTAs. It is found that the wind differences can account for the changes in the average cold tongue warming associated with pre- and post- 1997 / 98 WWEs. 1...|$|R
40|$|In this paper, zonal {{momentum}} balances of {{the tropical}} atmospheric circulation during the global monsoon mature months (January and July) are analyzed in three dimensions based on the ECMWF Interim Re-Analysis (ERA-Interim). It is found that the dominant terms {{in the balance of}} the atmospheric boundary layer (ABL) in both months are the pressure gradient force, the Coriolis force, and friction. The nonlinear advection term plays a significant role only in the Asian summer monsoon regions within the ABL. In the upper troposphere, the pressure gradient force, the Coriolis force, and the nonlinear advection are the dominant terms. The transient eddy force and the residual force (which can be explained as convective momentum transfer over open oceans) are secondary, yet cannot be neglected near the equator. Zonal-mean <b>equatorial</b> upper-troposphere <b>easterlies</b> are maintained by the absolute angular momentum advection associated with the cross-equatorial Hadley circulation. <b>Equatorial</b> upper-troposphere <b>easterlies</b> over the Asian monsoon regions are also controlled by the absolute angular momentum advection but are mainly maintained by the pressure gradient force in January. The equivalent linear Rayleigh friction, which is widely applied in simple tropical models, is calculated and the corresponding spatial distribution of the local coefficient and damping time scale are estimated from the linear regression. It is found that the linear momentum model is in general capable of crudely describing the tropical atmospheric circulation dynamics, yet the caveat should be kept in mind that the friction coefficient is not uniformly distributed and is even negative in some regions. 1...|$|R
40|$|As {{the word}} "monsoon" (derived from an Arabic word meaning seasons) indicates, the South Asian (SA) summer monsoon {{is part of}} an {{annually}} reversing wind system (Figure 2. 1 (b, e) (Ramage, 1971; Rao, 1976)). The winds at low levels during the summer monsoon season are characterized by the strongest westerlies anywhere at 850 hPa over the Arabian Sea, known as the low-level westerly jet (LLJ) (Figure 2. 1 e), and a large-scale cyclonic vorticity extending from the north Bay of Bengal (BoB) to western India known as the "monsoon trough" (Figure 2. 1 (e) (Rao, 1976)). The easterly jet (Figure 2. 1 (f)) centered around 5 °N and the Tibetan anticyclone centered around 30 °N are important features of upper level winds over the monsoon region during northern summer. Millions of inhabitants of the region, however, attach much greater importance to the associated seasonal changes of rainfall. Wet summers and dry winters (Figure 2. 1 (a, d)) associated with the seasonal changes of low-level winds are crucial for agricultural production and the economy of the region. The monsoon, or the seasonal changes of winds and rainfall, in the region could be interpreted as a result of northward seasonal migration of the east-west oriented precipitation belt (Tropical Convergence Zone, TCZ) from southern hemisphere in winter to northern hemisphere in summer (Gadgil, 2003). The largest northward excursion of the rain belt takes place over the Indian monsoon region where it moves from a mean position of about 5 °S in winter (Figure 2. 1 (a)) to about 20 °N in northern summer (Figure 2. 1 (d)) (Waliser and Gautier, 1993). In the upper atmosphere (200 hPa), the <b>equatorial</b> <b>easterlies</b> are weak and confined between 5 °N and 10 °S while the subtropical westerlies intrude all the way to 10 °N during northern winter (Figure 2. 1 (c)) ...|$|R
40|$|The {{nonlinear}} behaviour of quasi-stationary planetary {{waves that}} are excited by mid-latitude orographic forcing is considered {{in a global}} shallow-water model taken to represent the upper troposphere. The waves propagate toward low latitudes where the background flow is normally weak and the waves are therefore likely to break. Nonlinear pseudomomentum conservation relations are used to quantify the absorption-reflection behaviour of the wave-breaking region. Two different flow scenarios are represented: (i) initial states without {{a representation of the}} Hadley circulation, but where the axisymmetric equatorial background flow changes from being weak and easterly to moderate westerly; (ii) initial states that include a representation of the Hadley circulation and that have weak <b>equatorial</b> <b>easterlies.</b> Based on linear arguments, both (i) and (ii) are expected to influence the progression of the wave train. The nonlinear behaviour in the presence of low-latitude westerly background flows is different from linear predictions. For large-amplitude forcing, wave breaking takes place even though there is no zero-wind line in the initial slate, and the cross-equatorial wave propagation that look place for small-amplitude forcing is stopped before it can reach the equator. Nonlinear reflection is found to take place back into the hemisphere of origin but not across to the other hemisphere. In the presence of a Hadley circulation representative of winter conditions, the nonlinear reflection takes longer to get established, i. e. it requires more forcing, but a reflected wave train is still present in the numerical simulations, both for a longitudinally symmetric forcing and for the more realistic case of an isolated forcing. A summer Hadley circulation allows wave activity to get to the winter hemisphere. As the forcing is increased, wave breaking occurs and eventually nonlinear reflection...|$|R
40|$|The da Silva, Young and Levitus Surface Marine Atlas, {{based on}} {{observations}} from the Comprehensive Ocean Atmosphere Data Set (COADS) Release 1, {{has been used}} to investigate the relationship between evaporation and sea-surface temperature (SST) over the global oceans. For the period 1950 to 1987 SST, surface latent heat flux, and other related variables have been filtered to minimize data uncertainties and to focus upon interannual variations associated with warm (El Nino) and cold (La Nina) ENSO events. Compositing procedures have enabled identification of systematic variations in latent heat fluxes accompanying these events and the relationship to spatial anomalies in ocean surface wind speed and humidity. The evaporation response associated with ENSO sea surface temperature (SST) variability is systematic in nature and composed of offsetting contributions from the surface wind and humidity variations. During warm events exceeding 1. 0 S. D. delta SST, increases in the surface humidity deficit, delta(qs-qa), between the surface and 2 m height dominate regions of positive SST anomalies and lead to increases in evaporation of almost 2 Wm (exp - 2) at deltaSST = 0. 23 K. Despite the increases in specific humidity, relative humidity decreases slightly in regions of elevated SSTs. For the most part, variations in wind speed are consistent with previous investigations. Weakening of the <b>equatorial</b> <b>easterlies</b> (and generation of westerlies) between 160 degrees E and 140 degrees W dominates during the early phases of warm events. Elevated wind speeds in adjacent subtropical regions and in the eastern equatorial Pacific subsequently develop too. The net contribution of these winds, which reflect adjustments in Hadley and Walker circulation components is toward reduced evaporation. Results for cold periods are approximately similar, but opposite in sign to warm events, though evidence of different temporal evolution is noted...|$|R
