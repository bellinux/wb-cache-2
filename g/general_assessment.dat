[...] Writing for New York Magazine, the hard-to-please critic John Simon called the film [...] "unfunny comedy, poor moviemaking, and embarrassing self-revelation," [...] and wrote that Keaton's performance was [...] "in bad taste to watch and indecency to display," [...] saying the part should have been played by Robin Mary Paris, the actress who appears briefly in the scene where Alvy Singer has written a two-character play nakedly based on himself and Annie Hall.

500|$|Hazlitt's {{essay on}} Hamlet was later used by David Bromwich in an {{extensive}} comparison of Coleridge's and Hazlitt's critical views in general. Although, to Bromwich, Coleridge's criticism of Hamlet contained {{a greater number}} of original ideas, including the <b>general</b> <b>assessment</b> of Prince Hamlet's character, Hazlitt's view is notable in that it does not, like Coleridge, reduce that character to a single dominating flaw, his inability to act. In one of his lectures on Shakespeare, Coleridge claimed that [...] "Shakespeare wished to impress upon us the truth that action is the chief end of existence—that no faculties of intellect, however brilliant, can be considered valuable, or indeed otherwise than as misfortunes, if they withdraw us from or render us repugnant to action, and lead us to think and think of doing, until the time has elapsed when we can do anything effectually." [...] Hazlitt, on the other hand, instead of applying this moral, pointed to the necessity of each reader's identifying with Hamlet to understand him (which, he believed, occurred more readily than with any other of Shakespeare's characters) and the reader's judging of Hamlet in part {{on the basis of what}} that reader then saw in himself. This made it unlikely that Hamlet's entire character would be reduced to a single flaw that would provide the reader with a moral lesson.|$|E

Indeed, nuclear plants are so slow and costly to build that they reduce and retard climate protection".

40|$|Climate {{negotiation}} {{outcomes are}} difficult to evaluate objectively {{because there are no}} clear reference scenarios. Subjective assessments from those directly involved in the negotiations are particularly important, as this may influence strategy and future negotiation participation. Here we analyze the perceived success of the climate negotiations in a sample of more than 600 experts involved in international climate policy. Respondents were pessimistic when asked for specific assessments of the current approach centered on voluntary pledges, but were more optimistic when asked for <b>general</b> <b>assessments</b> of the outcomes and usefulness of the climate negotiations. Individuals who are more involved in the negotiation process tended to be more optimistic, especially in terms of <b>general</b> <b>assessments.</b> Our results indicate that two reinforcing effects are at work: a high degree of involvement changes individuals’ perceptions and more optimistic individuals are more inclined to remain involved in the negotiations...|$|R

Medical personnel involved are trained to assess and treat those assaulted or follow protocols established to ensure privacy and best treatment practices. Informed consent is always required prior to treatment unless {{the person who was}} assaulted is unconscious, intoxicated or does not have the mental capacity to give consent. Priorities governing the physical exam are the treatment of serious life-threatening emergencies and then a general and complete assessment. Some physical injuries are readily apparent such as, bites, broken teeth, swelling, bruising, lacerations and scratches. In more violent cases, the victim may need to have gunshot wounds or stab wounds treated. [...] The loss of consciousness is relevant to the medical history. [...] If abrasions are found, immunization against tetanus is offered if 5 years have elapsed since the last immunization.|$|E
2500|$|<b>General</b> <b>assessment</b> of Tejada's {{scholarly}} standing {{seems far}} from agreed.

Others consider him either mostly a law theorist or mostly a student of Hispanidad. His followers point also to his charming personality and acknowledging massive erudition, call him a genius monster. Others suggest {{that he was a}} little-minded, vindictive, impossible to deal with bigot of an overgrown ego, his career enabled by anti-democratic nature of the Francoist regime, dubbed [...] "reaccionario" [...] and the passion of his life, [...] "tradición española", referred to as [...] "ni es tradición ni es española".

2500|$|In September 2012, the Associated Press {{reported}} that Young had {{spent much of}} the $34 million salary he earned in the NFL and was facing financial problems after defaulting on a $1.9 million high interest payday loan. Young filed a lawsuit seeking to stop the lender, Pro Player Funding LLC, from enforcing a judgment of nearly $1.7 million with a claim that the loan documents were forged and he did not knowingly execute the loan. However, Young had authorized $1 million in loan payments to Pro Player directly from his Eagles salary prior to defaulting and Young's signatures on loan documents were notarized. Young also filed lawsuits against his former agent, Major Adams, and a North Carolina financial planner, Ronnie Peoples, alleging that they misappropriated $5.5 million of funds. When asked to give a <b>general</b> <b>assessment</b> of Young's finances, Young's attorney, Trey Dolezal, stated [...] "I would just say that Vince needs a job." [...] Young's financial problems have reportedly been a result of lavish spending and, by his account, the betrayal of trusted advisers.|$|E
40|$|In this study, novice drivers' {{safe driving}} {{performance}} {{was investigated in}} a prospective design. Driving performance during a 11 / 2 h driving session was, rated both by the drivers and their instructors. The results indicated that a model based on the Theory of Planned Behaviour predicted both self-reported performance (50 % of variance in <b>general</b> <b>assessments</b> and 33 % of variance in estimates of driving errors/violations explained) and instructors' <b>general</b> <b>assessments</b> (17 % variance explained). Instructors' assessments of driving errors and violations committed during the session was the only outcome not successfully explained by the model (0 % variance explained). The results indicate that self-reports on behavioural criteria are not without merit in tests concerning the contribution of social-cognitive determinants to safe driving. Self-efficacy emerged as the main predictor of performance. Interventions targeting novice drivers, could therefore emphasize mastery experiences {{in order to facilitate}} safe driving behaviour.

2500|$|Henry worked {{together}} with James Madison, a delegate {{after three years}} in Congress, on a [...] number of issues. They differed, though, on state support for Virginia's Protestant churches. [...] Madison, like Jefferson, desired a separation {{between church and state}} that meant no public financing of religion, but Henry believed that taxpayers who were Christians should be assessed for the maintenance of the Protestant church of their choice, financing an array of churches in the way that Anglicanism had been funded in Virginia until the start of the war. Henry was not alone in this belief; both Washington and Lee supported such plans. According to Thomas S. Kidd in his biography of Henry, [...] "the <b>general</b> <b>assessment</b> plan {{is one of the main}} reasons Henry is not more widely esteemed as a Founder, for in this debate, he seems to have diverted from the progressive flow of history." [...] The General Assembly might well have passed the bill, but on November 17, 1784, the legislators elected Henry as governor. Madison believed that Henry took the position for family reasons—his wife and children were likely quite happy to be in Richmond rather than in remote Henry County—but the cost was Henry's bill as Madison got it postponed to the following year and eventually defeated. Instead, Madison got Jefferson's Statute for Religious Freedom through the legislature. This law requiring a separation of church and state passed the General Assembly in 1786.|$|E
60|$|Two modes {{have been}} {{contemplated}} of paying off a national debt: either at once by a general contribution, or gradually by a surplus revenue. The first would be incomparably the best, {{if it were}} practicable; {{and it would be}} practicable if it could justly be done by assessment on property alone. If property bore the whole interest of the debt, property might, with great advantage to itself, pay it off; since this would be merely surrendering to a creditor the principal sum, the whole annual proceeds of which were already his by law, and would be equivalent to what a land-owner does when he sells part of his estate, to free the remainder from a mortgage. But property, it need hardly be said, does not pay, and can not justly be required to pay, the whole interest of the debt. Whatever is the fitting contribution from property to the general expenses of the state, in the same, and in no greater proportion, should it contribute toward either the interest or the repayment of the national debt. This, however, if admitted, is fatal to any scheme for the extinction of the debt by a <b>general</b> <b>assessment</b> on the community. Persons of property could pay their share of the amount by a sacrifice of property, and have the same net income as before.|$|E
