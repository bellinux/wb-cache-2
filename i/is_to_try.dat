In the end, the Rhoades are awarded $10,000 but the Bundys receive nothing, because the jury {{does not believe that}} sex occurred. After everyone exits the courtroom, Al attempts to prove that he can perform when he wants to and has sex with Peggy for hours on the judge's bench, unwittingly while being recorded by the courtroom camera.|$|E

Other species that practice mate avoidance are Calopteryx haemorrhoidalis, a species of damselfly, who often try to hide from large groups of males to avoid harassment.|$|E
25|$|This {{brings us}} back to Wittgenstein's {{reliance}} on indirect communication, and his reliance on thought-experiments. Some philosophical confusions come about because we aren't able to see family resemblances. We've made a mistake in understanding the vague and intuitive rules that language uses, and have thereby tied ourselves up in philosophical knots. He suggests that an attempt to untangle these knots requires more than simple deductive arguments pointing out the problems with some particular position. Instead, Wittgenstein's larger goal <b>is</b> <b>to</b> <b>try</b> to divert us from our philosophical problems long enough to become aware of our intuitive ability to see the family resemblances.|$|E

In 2014, Cameroonian para-sportspeople participated in the Queen's Baton Relay ahead of the 2014 Commonwealth Games.

For example, the 2012 ride saw seventeen riders hospitalised with fears of hypothermia due to the wet and cold on day four, while just a matter of days both before and after this many riders struggled with the heat when temperatures reached the high-30s.|$|E
25|$|Sledging is a {{term used}} in cricket to {{describe}} the practice whereby some players seek to gain an advantage by insulting or verbally intimidating the opposing player. The purpose <b>is</b> <b>to</b> <b>try</b> to weaken the opponent's concentration, thereby causing him/her to make mistakes or underperform. It can be effective because the batsman stands within hearing range of the bowler and certain close fielders; and vice versa. The insults may be direct or feature in conversations among fielders designed to be overheard. The term has also been used in other sports, as when the tennis player Nick Kyrgios insulted his opponent, Stan Wawrinka, by referring to a purported encounter between another player and the latter's girlfriend.|$|E
25|$|Because many {{encodings}} {{have only}} a limited repertoire of characters, they are often only usable to represent text in a limited subset of human languages. Unicode {{is an attempt to}} create a common standard for representing all known languages, and most known character sets are subsets of the very large Unicode character set. Although there are multiple character encodings available for Unicode, the most common is UTF-8, which has the advantage of being backwards-compatible with ASCII; that is, every ASCII text file is also a UTF-8 text file with identical meaning. UTF-8 also has the advantage that it is easily auto-detectable. Thus, a common operating mode of UTF-8 capable software, when opening files of unknown encoding, <b>is</b> <b>to</b> <b>try</b> UTF-8 first and fall back to a locale dependent legacy encoding when it definitely isn't UTF-8.|$|E

25|$|As {{sugar levels}} in the grape rise, acid levels fall. All wines need some degree of acidity {{in order to be}} {{balanced}} and avoid tasting flabby or dull. Acidity is also a key component in food and wine pairing so its presence in wine is important with winemakers trying to harvest grapes before acid levels fall too low. The stress to maintain acid levels is not as bearing {{due to the fact that}} winemakers can rectify the situation somewhat by later adding acids during the winemaking process (winemakers can also rectify deficiencies in sugar levels by chaptalization). However natural acids in the grape play other roles in the development of flavor and aroma compounds as well as fighting against the effects of spoilage organisms so the most ideal situation for winemakers <b>is</b> <b>to</b> <b>try</b> and harvest while acid levels are acceptable.|$|E
25|$|To {{obtain the}} {{behavior}} of the Yang–Mills theory at high energies, and so to prove asymptotic freedom, one applies perturbation theory assuming a small coupling. This is verified a posteriori in the ultraviolet limit. In the opposite limit, the infrared limit, the situation is the opposite, as the coupling is too large for perturbation theory to be reliable. Most of the difficulties that research meets is just managing the theory at low energies. That is the interesting case, being inherent to the description of hadronic matter and, more generally, to all the observed bound states of gluons and quarks and their confinement (see hadrons). The most used method to study the theory in this limit <b>is</b> <b>to</b> <b>try</b> to solve it on computers (see lattice gauge theory). In this case, large computational resources are needed to be sure the correct limit of infinite volume (smaller lattice spacing) is obtained. This is the limit the results must be compared with. Smaller spacing and larger coupling are not independent of each other, and larger computational resources are needed for each. As of today, the situation appears somewhat satisfactory for the hadronic spectrum and the computation of the gluon and ghost propagators, but the glueball and hybrids spectra are yet a questioned matter in view of the experimental observation of such exotic states. Indeed, the σ resonance(600) pole and scattering length |journal=Physical Review D |volume=76 |issue=7 |page=074034 |year=2007 |doi=10.1103/PhysRevD.76.074034|arxiv = hep-ph/0701025 |bibcode = 2007PhRvD..76g4034G }} is not seen in any of such lattice computations and contrasting interpretations have been put forward. This is a hotly debated issue.|$|E
