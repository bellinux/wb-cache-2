5000|$|In elastodynamics, Love waves, {{named after}} Augustus Edward Hough Love, are {{horizontally}} polarized surface waves. The Love wave {{is a result}} of the interference of many shear waves (S-waves) guided by an elastic layer, which is welded to an elastic half space on one side while bordering a vacuum on the other side. In seismology, Love waves (also known as Q waves (Quer: German for lateral)) are surface seismic waves that cause <b>horizontal</b> <b>shifting</b> of the Earth during an earthquake. Augustus Edward Hough Love predicted the existence of Love waves mathematically in 1911. They form a distinct class, different from other types of seismic waves, such as P-waves and S-waves (both body waves), or Rayleigh waves (another type of surface wave). Love waves travel with a lower velocity than P- or S- waves, but faster than Rayleigh waves. These waves are observed only when there is a low velocity layer overlying a high velocity layer/ sub-layers.|$|E

The results indicated that incorporating more filler causes lower relaxation values and rates, and stress retention and prescribed strain level were reversely correlated. Among the studied filler types, wood flour and kenaf fiber presented more similar behaviors, whereas newsprint resembled rice hulls performance.

30|$|To compare two iris images, we use {{the nearest}} {{neighbor}} approach as the classifier, and the Hamming distance as the similarity measure.

40|$|Ethylene Tetrafluoroethylene (ETFE) {{has been}} widely used in long-span {{buildings}} because of its light weight and high transparency. This paper studies the {{short and long term}} creep behaviour of ETFE foil. A series of short-term creep and recovery tests were performed, in which the residual strain was observed. A long-term creep test of the ETFE foil was also performed over 110 days. A viscoelastic-plastic model was then established to describe the short-term creep and recovery behaviour. The model contains a traditional multi-Kelvin part and an added steady-flow component to represent the viscoelastic and viscoplastic behaviour, respectively. The model successfully fit the data for three stresses and six temperatures. Additionally, time-temperature equivalency was adopted to predict the long-term creep behaviour of ETFE foil. <b>Horizontal</b> <b>shifting</b> factors were determined from the process of shifting creep-curves at six temperatures.

40|$|We have {{developed}} a single/double layer model to explain <b>horizontal</b> <b>shifting</b> of measured D-E hysteresis loops (imprint) for ferroelectric thin films. Such phenomenon {{can be explained by}} considering three mechanisms or their multiple effects: (1) stress induced by film/electrode lattice mismatch or clamping, (2) domain pinning induced by, e. g., oxygen vacancies, or (3) degradation of ferroelectric properties in film/electrode surface layers. First, it is found that hysteresis loops under the influence of stress exhibit large horizontal shifts with magnitudes comparable to those observed in experiments. Second, a pseudo-non-switching layer with a large coercive field is assumed to be present at the film/electrode interface in an otherwise homogeneous ferroelectric thin film, and in this case our simulation also shows a large imprint effect. Third, it is also found that time-dependent space-charge-limited conduction is likely to be one origin for the occurrence of imprint.

30|$|Two {{findings}} {{stand out}} from this experiment. First, that {{in the absence of}} degradation, older and younger participants are both capable of performing our lexical decision task at a high level of accuracy, even if older participants are slower to do so. Second, and much more interestingly, that degraded stimuli, both blurred and with added noise, have a greater detrimental effect on legibility for older participants than younger participants, and that this change can be best and most simply described as a <b>horizontal</b> <b>shift</b> of the function used to fit the data. The fact of this <b>horizontal</b> <b>shift</b> means that it is entirely possible, based on data collected under the low ambient illumination conditions used in this experiment, to simulate the difficulty an older observer has performing the task with a given stimulus and give a younger observer an intuitive appreciation of the differences in their respective perceptions.|$|R
40|$|The linear {{viscoelastic}} properties {{have been}} measured {{for a series}} of bisphenol-A-based epoxy resins cured with the diamine DDS. The linear viscoelastic master curves were constructed via time-temperature superposition of frequency dependent G-prime and G-double-prime isotherms. The G-double-prime master curves exhibited two sub-Tg transitions. Superposition of isotherms in the glass-to-rubber transition (i. e., alpha) and the beta transition at - 60 C was achieved by simple <b>horizontal</b> <b>shifts</b> in the log frequency axis; however, in the region between alpha and beta, superposition could not be effected by simple <b>horizontal</b> <b>shifts</b> along the log frequency axis. The different temperature dependency of the alpha and beta relaxation mechanisms causes a complex response of G-double-prime in the so called alpha-prime region.

40|$|As {{a result}} of its {{explosive}} rise since {{the second half of the}} 20 th century, the population of the world has tripled in comparison with 1950. In 2009, the number of inhabitants living in cities was over the number of people inhabiting rural areas, while from 75 in 1950 the number of cities with more than 1 million inhabitants is expected to increase to 553 by 2050. Nevertheless, the most evident forms of the march of urbanization are megacities, i. e. those urban agglomerations where extremely large populations are concentrated. One important problem of defining megacities is the determination of an optimum population threshold that is the establishment of the population value over which an urban agglomeration can be regarded to be a megacity. This article has been divided into two main sections: the first section relies on a relatively objective method to determine the optimum population threshold value of megacities, whereas the second section makes use of the World Bank and UN’s country classification to arrange the same cities into groups. With the help of the various classifications, the vertical and <b>horizontal</b> <b>shifting</b> of megacities in the period from 1950 to 2050 becomes clearly apparent...|$|E
40|$|In {{this work}} new {{insights}} are presented on {{the measurement of}} the tangent and secant moduli from stress–strain curves in polymeric systems. Expressions for the strain-rate and strain dependence of both moduli are derived for systems characterised by a distribution of relaxation times. The equivalent frequency of the stress–strain experiments is shown {{to be dependent on}} the strain rate and on the strain at which the measurements are carried out. Such considerations enable using quasi-static tensile stress–strain tests to study relaxational processes in polymeric materials. The tensile behaviour of a 30 % glass fibre reinforced polyamide 6 was characterised at different strain rates and temperatures, covering the glass transition region. A master curve of the tangent modulus as a function of strain rate was successfully constructed by simple <b>horizontal</b> <b>shifting</b> of the isothermal data. The temperature dependence of the shift factors was well described by the WLF equation.

40|$|A {{triangular}} flat {{shell element}} for large deformation analysis of linear viscoelastic laminated composites is presented. Hygrothermorheologically simple materials are considered {{for which a}} change in the hygrothermal environment results in a <b>horizontal</b> <b>shifting</b> of the relaxation moduli curves on a log time scale, in addition to the usual hygrothermal loads. Recurrence relations are developed and implemented for the evaluation of the viscoelastic memory loads. The nonlinear deformation process is computed using an incremental/iterative approach with the Newton-Raphson Method used to find the incremental displacements in each step. The presented numerical examples consider the large deformation and stability of linear viscoelastic structures under deformation-independent mechanical loads, deformation-dependent pressure loads, and thermal loads. Unlike elastic structures that have a single critical load value associated with a given snapping of buckling instability phenomenon, viscoelastic structures will usually exhibit a particular instability for a range of applied loads over a range of critical times. Both creep buckling and snap-through examples are presented here. In some cases, viscoelastic results are also obtained using the quasielastic method in which load-history effects are ignored, and time-varying viscoelastic properties are simply used in a series of elastic problems. The presented numerical examples demonstrate the capability and accuracy of the formulation...|$|E

40|$|Depth-image-based {{rendering}} (DIBR) is {{a method}} to represent a stereoscopic content. The DIBR consists of a monoscopic center view and an associated per-pixel depth map. Using these two components and given depth condition from a user, the DIBR renders left and right views. The advantages of DIBR are numerous.

However, {{in the view of}} copyright protection, since not only the center view but also each left or right view {{can be used as a}} monoscopic content when they are illegally distributed, the watermark signal which is embedded in the center view must have an ability to protect the respective three views.

We exploit the fact that the objects in the view are shifted only to horizontal way when the center view renders to the left and right views.

40|$|Actively bent grid shells are curved {{structural}} surfaces made {{of flexible}} members. The application is mainly in roof structures. The members, spanning between two supports on the perimeter, are connected at their intersections by joints, and assembled in an initially straight grid. By lifting at {{a sufficient number}} of points the straight grid is subsequently transformed into a bent shape and new geometry is preserved by fixing the supports. Subsequently, the curved surface is braced with a third layer of flexible members. According to this specific principle of construction, actively bent grid shells can be built within a short period of time. ThinkShell, a research team at École des Ponts ParisTech, has developed a number of actively bent Glass Fiber Reinforced (GFRP) grid shells over the last ten years. Due to mechanical properties such as lightweight, high elastic limit strain, and high stiffness, Carbon Fiber Reinforced Polymer (CFRP) becomes an interesting material choice for construction of long-span actively bent grid shells. In the actively bent members of the grid shells considerable amount of permanent stresses is present. The main source of stress is caused by the transformation of the straight grid into a bent shape during erection. Fiber Reinforced Polymer (FRP) is sensitive to creep behavior, which may lead to possible collapse mechanism due to creep-rupture or creep-buckling as a result of reduced stiffness of the material on a long-term. Limited knowledge is available of the time-dependent long-term creep behavior of CFRP, in the field of structural design of buildings. The main objective of this research was to define stress limits related to time-dependent long-term creep behavior of CFRP in members of actively bent grid shells, using the Stepped Isostress Method (SSM). The most important conclusion drawn from the experiments using the SSM is that, in actively bent grid shell design, it is crucially important to stay below the sustained stress limits to avoid creep-rupture, as the CFRP fails in a brittle manner. From the SSM analysis using test data from bending experiments it was concluded that if the permanent load in the CFRP is 55 % of the ultimate load, creep-rupture will happen in 40 days. This result does not seem realistic as the sustained stress limit from CUR 96 corresponds to a service life of 50 years. Out of the four steps in processing of raw test data using the SSM, the rescaling step is the most critical step. There is strong dependence between the rescaling step and the <b>horizontal</b> <b>shifting</b> step. To determine the rescaling values and <b>horizontal</b> <b>shifting</b> for the bending experiments, a corresponding conventional creep tests as a reference test is proposed. The SSM represents a promising method for accelerated creep testing and corresponding test data analysis for CFRP in members of actively bent grid shells. Sustained stress limits derived from the SSM may be used as more realistic, i. e. less conservative stress limit values to avoid creep-rupture, compared to the values defined in CUR 96, for the specific design parameters. <br/...|$|E

Test specimens were compression molded at 165 C, then quenched to room temperature and allowed to age for up to 30 days prior to testing. Stress relaxation curves measured after different aging times could be superposed to a single master curve for each aging temperature. Superposition was achieved by applying vertical and <b>horizontal</b> <b>shifts.</b> Hence, the shape of the response curves was not changed by aging. This is in accordance with observations made by Struik for tensile creep curves. Volume changes as a function of physical aging were also determined. Simple exponential relationships were observed between volume and both <b>horizontal</b> and vertical <b>shifts.</b> The <b>horizontal</b> <b>shift</b> implies a shift in the effective time scale caused by a change in free volume.
