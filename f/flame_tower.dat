50|$|Unlike {{in other}} tower defense games, turrets {{can be placed}} {{anywhere}} and the enemies will go around them, forcing them to walk along any path the player makes. It {{is not possible to}} block the path however. Fieldrunners offers three types of gameplay: Classic, Extended and Endless. Playing in Classic and Extended modes limits the number of rounds in which the player must defend to 100. Classic only lets players build the original four towers, Gatling, Goo, Missile, and Tesla (except Skyway which substitutes Laser for Tesla and Frostbite which substitutes Ice for Goo). Extended mode adds the two new towers, <b>Flame</b> <b>Tower</b> and Mortar Tower (except Skyway which adds Tesla instead of Mortar). In Endless mode, the player may defend indefinitely. In any mode, the player may play in Easy, Medium, or Hard mode.|$|E

50|$|On {{the evening}} of May 7, 1975, Toledo firefighters were called to the Tiedtke's {{building}} on a report of a fire breaking out in the structure. According to the May 8 edition of the Toledo Blade, the blaze grew to a three-alarmer within an hour. <b>Flames</b> <b>towered</b> hundreds of feet into the sky and could be seen for miles, also damaging a furniture store across Adams Street. A huge crowd gathered in the former Water Street parking lot to watch the blaze, and several times they tried {{to break through the}} cordon of police and firemen.|$|R
60|$|It {{had long}} been {{apparent}} that {{in the face of}} such a wind all the pigmy appliances that the populace could bring to act upon such a mass of combustion would be unavailing. As much as could burn that night was burnt, while some of that which would not burn crumbled and fell as a formless heap, whence new <b>flames</b> <b>towered</b> up, and inclined to the north-east so far as to singe the trees of the park. The thicker walls of Norman date remained unmoved, partly because of their thickness, and partly because in them stone vaults took the place of wood floors.|$|R
50|$|In 2003 Pyogenesis played co-headliner at the Summer Breeze Open Air, and {{delivered}} the first Metal show in years. They {{used a lot}} of pyrotechnics such as up to 12m high <b>flame</b> <b>towers</b> wherefore the fire service had to implement aluminum-sheets below {{the roof of the}} stage. From 2005 on the band played outside their homeland Germany, only. They were a couple of times in Russia, where they also played the very last shows in the capital Moscow and the Asian part of the country at the Russian leg of the Snowboard World Championship as the headliner in front of 25.000 people, before their concert break until 2014.|$|R
5000|$|The {{building}} {{was featured in}} Extreme Engineering, a documentary television series that airs on the Discovery Channel and the Science Channel. The episode called [...] "Azerbaijan's Amazing Transformation" [...] was broadcast on 22 April 2011 as part of Season 9. The <b>Flame</b> <b>Towers</b> also appeared prominently in trailers before many entries for the Eurovision Song Contest 2012 hosted in Baku (and, in the next 4 years, with the pre song trailer based in the singer's home area, features in the trailer before the Azerbaijan song). The towers are also a prominent landmark in Battlefield 4, with the first level of the single player campaign taking place in Baku. Additionally, the towers were shown frequently during coverage of the initial Formula 1 European Grand Prix held in Baku.|$|R

60|$|A faint flash {{was seen}} {{for an instant}} away to the southward. It was {{followed}} {{in a few seconds}} by the low boom of a distant gun. Almost at the same moment the black heavens seemed to be cleft by a sheet of vivid <b>flame,</b> which <b>towered</b> high into the sky, and then went out, leaving the darkness blacker than before.|$|R
60|$|Now {{and then}} it was {{possible}} to catch glimpses of the <b>flames,</b> which <b>towered</b> above the tops of the nearby trees; but we heard nothing of the enemy, which seemed to me strange until I mentioned the fact to Darius when he came up, after loitering in the rear with the lieutenant as if to show his contempt for the Britishers.|$|R
60|$|The men {{and women}} without a word rushed into the house. They too knew the danger, and the only hope there was for a life. The {{assurance}} of the Countess took the sting from the present loss. Before the minute, which she timed watch in hand, was over, all came forth bearing armloads of their lares and penates. Then one of the younger men ran in again and out bearing a flaming stick from the fire. Stephen nodded, he held it to {{the northern edge of}} the thatch. The straw caught in a flash and the flame ran up the slope and {{along the edge of the}} roof like a quick match. The squeaking of many rats was heard and their brown bodies streamed over the roof. Before another minute had passed a great mass of <b>flame</b> <b>towered</b> into the sky and shed a red light far out over the waste of sea.|$|R
60|$|At {{the end of}} the {{corridor}} a whole section of the fortress was in ruins. <b>Towering</b> <b>flames</b> leaped on all sides. One of the missiles had penetrated below ground level.|$|R

60|$|The {{brilliant}} {{lights and}} sooty shades which struggled upon {{the skin and}} clothes of the persons standing round caused their lineaments and general contours to be drawn with Dureresque vigour and dash. Yet the permanent moral expression of each face {{it was impossible to}} discover, for as the nimble <b>flames</b> <b>towered,</b> nodded, and swooped through the surrounding air, the blots of shade and flakes of light upon the countenances of the group changed shape and position endlessly. All was unstable; quivering as leaves, evanescent as lightning. Shadowy eye-sockets, deep as those of a death's head, suddenly turned into pits of lustre: a lantern-jaw was cavernous, then it was shining; wrinkles were emphasized to ravines, or obliterated entirely by a changed ray. Nostrils were dark wells; sinews in old necks were gilt mouldings; things with no particular polish on them were glazed; bright objects, such as the tip of a furze-hook one of the men carried, were as glass; eyeballs glowed like little lanterns. Those whom Nature had depicted as merely quaint became grotesque, the grotesque became preternatural; for all was in extremity.|$|R
5000|$|During the October 2003 Cedar Fires, part of KECR's rural {{transmitter}} site {{was destroyed by}} <b>flames.</b> Only one <b>tower</b> (out of seven) and an 'electrical doghouse' were completely destroyed. The station has been fully upgraded and repaired.|$|R
50|$|The blasts {{were fairly}} small, except when manhole covers were involved. At these points, {{the access to}} oxygen fueled <b>towering</b> <b>flames</b> that erupted through the manhole covers onto city streets. The covers {{themselves}} were blown high into the air.|$|R
5000|$|The Soviets' {{vehicles}} {{tend to be}} {{more durable}} and powerful than Allied vehicles, but are often slower moving and more expensive. The Soviets also have superior defensive capabilities against ground attacks, with the <b>Flame</b> <b>Towers</b> and Tesla coil, the latter able to destroy most Allied armor in 1-2 hits although it has high power consumption. The Soviets' weakness is at sea; their only offensive naval unit is the submarine, which exists to counter Allied warships and gain intelligence. It is normally invisible except when surfacing to attack, when it is vulnerable to destroyers and gunboats. The Soviets' secret weapon is the Iron Curtain, a device that renders a selected unit invulnerable to attacks {{for a short period of}} time. They also have a wide selection of air units for assault (the MiG-27 (though depicted as a MiG-29 in cut-scenes, Yak-7, and Mi-24 Hind) and map revelation through spy planes, and can deploy infantry by air through paratroops or by the Chinook transport helicopter (the latter only present in multiplayer). The Soviet [...] "tank rush" [...] was a popular strategy online, involving building many heavy tanks and overwhelming the opponent with sheer numbers.|$|R
5000|$|The Olympic Flame was lit by two Finnish heroes, runners Paavo Nurmi and Hannes Kolehmainen. Nurmi first lit the {{cauldron}} {{inside the}} stadium, {{and later the}} flame was relayed to the stadium tower where Kolehmainen lit it. Only the <b>flame</b> in the <b>tower</b> was burning throughout the Olympics.|$|R
2500|$|The last segment {{known as}} [...] "Invitation from the City of Flowers" [...] (花城之邀) {{started with a}} stage full of drummers. A group of hostesses joined the performance. China's Wei Wei (韦唯), Tang Jing (谭晶), Hong Kong's Joey Yung (容祖儿), Taiwan's David Tao (陶喆) and South Korea's Kim Hyun Joong (金贤重) {{performed}} the games theme song [...] "Sunshine Again" [...] (日出東方). The cauldron was then reveal when it emerged from the ground as a giant <b>flame</b> cauldron <b>tower.</b> Fireworks then lit up the area, followed by watercraft and boat exhibitions.|$|R
5000|$|The {{vertical}} launch {{area will}} include a hangar for horizontal launch vehicle processing—in which the transporter erector will be stored between launches—as well as a launch pad and associated <b>flame</b> duct, water <b>tower,</b> four lightning protection towers, propellant storage and handling areas, associated workshop/warehouse/utility structures, and a [...] "retention basin for deluge water." ...|$|R
50|$|As {{the vessel}} {{prepared}} {{to enter the}} docks of A Coruña, the wind speed was above , and visibility was under 100 m, {{causing her to lose}} her assigned course. Aegean Sea broke up and exploded with 50 m <b>flames</b> near the <b>Tower</b> of Hercules, spilling more than 70,000 tons of oil into the ocean.|$|R
40|$|The {{structure}} of wildfire flames {{in the presence}} of crossflow was analyzed by utilizing suitable non-reacting numerical experiments with low speed flow over a hot isothermal horizontal semi-infinite surface. FireFOAM, a Large Eddy Simulation (LES) based solver developed by FM Global for fire protection engineering applications, was employed for all the calculations. Early-time dynamics of Rayleigh-Taylor Instability (RTI) was first simulated using Direct Numerical Simulations (DNS) so that the solver could be verified against Linear Stability Theory (LST). Then attention was given to late-time dynamics in order understand the different stages (e. g., appearance of secondary instability, generation of larger scales due to interaction between structures) involved {{in the development of the}} instability. The onset of thermal vortex instability, in a configuration with low speed flow over a hot isothermal semi-infinite horizontal plate, predicted using DNS was compared with the literature. Spatial evolution of various terms in the streamwise vorticity equation was used to identify the dominant mechanisms responsible for the generation/evolution of vorticity. Streamwise evolution of the instabilities was studied and the effects of the changes in temperature and orientation of the plate on the thermal instabilities were also investigated. Finally, a configuration with low speed flow over a hot isothermal semi-infinite horizontal strip was used to understand the effects of upstream Boundary Layer (BL) height and the length of the strip on both the thin horizontal and larger structures (analogous to <b>Flame</b> <b>Towers</b> (FT) observed in real wildfires and laboratory experiments) ...|$|R
2500|$|Another {{substantial}} renovation, with a {{cost estimate}} of $5 million was undertaken beginning in December 2011. It included $170,000 in energy-efficiency upgrades {{to the building}} as well as improvements to the artificial <b>flame</b> atop the <b>tower.</b> After several months of dormancy, the flame was [...] "relit" [...] on February 1, 2013. Other portions of the overall renovation included security upgrades along with repairs to certain limestone sections and brush removal.|$|R
50|$|Summoned out of {{the ether}} by the occult rituals of the frog monsters and the Zinco Corporation's Mr. Pope, (also known as the Black <b>Flame)</b> Katha-Hem <b>towered</b> {{as large as a}} {{mountain}} and began marching across the Midwestern United States. Atop a tripod of spidery legs, Katha-Hem resembled a twisted, tentacled tree, its canopy an inferno of hellish blue fire, and numerous green-toothed maws lining its trunk. American artillery failed to make a dent in the mammoth creature, while any humans who ventured too close were turned into monsters by a strange green gas emitted from its body. Just as the President was about to resort to a nuclear strike, the BPRD's Liz Sherman managed to burn Katha-Hem to ashes, using an ancient artifact that mysteriously amplified her powers a thousand times.|$|R
60|$|Bob and {{his father}} soon became aware that the light was from the beacon. By {{the time that they}} reached the top it was one mass of <b>towering</b> <b>flame,</b> from which the sparks fell on the green herbage like a fiery dew; the forms of the two old men being seen passing and repassing in the midst of it. The Lovedays, who came up on the smoky side, {{regarded}} the scene for a moment, and then emerged into the light.|$|R
