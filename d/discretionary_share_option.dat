40|$|The {{main goal}} of this {{dissertation}} was to obtain an understanding as to the true economic nature of employee <b>share</b> <b>options</b> and the problems surrounding the accounting thereof. The main conclusion {{of this study is}} that employee <b>share</b> <b>options</b> should be expensed in the income statement as and when the employee's services are performed. The reason is that employee <b>share</b> <b>options</b> are valuable financial instruments which the employer has used to compensate the employee for his services. It was also concluded that exercise date accounting and classification of outstanding employee <b>share</b> <b>options</b> as liabilities on the balance sheet is the most appropriate accounting treatment. Such accounting treatment trues up the accounting of employee <b>share</b> <b>options</b> with that of cash-settled share appreciation rights, which are economically equivalent transactions. The measurement of employee <b>share</b> <b>options</b> should be based on their fair value using an option-pricing model adapted for the specific features of employee <b>share</b> <b>options.</b> AccountingThesis (M.

This research report examines the impact of executive <b>share</b> <b>options</b> on company performance and test {{if there is a}} significant difference in performance between companies with different levels of <b>share</b> <b>options.</b> The problem is defined in two parts, one looking at company performance and the other management decision making. It employ share price cumulative annual returns, average Tobin’s Q and average return on assets over five years to define company performance. While the influence of management decision making is defined through the average dividend yield and debt/equity ratio over five years. This research report ignored the variability and risk component associated with <b>share</b> <b>options</b> and the performance and management decision making variables. It also excludes any attempt to comment on the effectiveness of <b>share</b> <b>options</b> as part of executive compensation. A regression analysis and two T-tests were employed on a sample of 203 JSE listed companies. Reliable data was sourced directly from two financial market data specialist. With the exception of ROA there was a significant statistical relationship between <b>share</b> <b>options</b> and the respective variables. However, these findings cannot be accepted as conclusive due to the violation of many normality assumptions. There was no evidence of any significant statistical difference between companies with higher than the mean or lower than the mean <b>share</b> <b>option</b> ratio, with the exception of Tobin’s Q. In contrast to this a secondary T-test revealed evidence of a significant statistical difference between the mean return on assets and mean dividend yield for companies with and companies without <b>share</b> <b>options.</b> While {{there was no evidence of}} any significant statistical difference between the mean cumulative annual average returns, Tobin’s Q and debt/equity ratio of companies with <b>share</b> <b>options</b> and those without.

40|$|Includes bibliographical references. <b>Share</b> <b>options</b> {{have become}} a popular, {{frequently}} rewarding and incentive-providing form of remuneration for executive directors and other employees. Previous international {{research has shown that}} the firm's decision to grant <b>share</b> <b>options</b> may be influenced by its financial reporting situation; its tax position; the existence of conflicting interests between management and other stakeholders; as well as the firm's size and liquidity situation. The reasons why the conflict of interest {{has been found to be}} significantly associated with the granting of <b>share</b> <b>options</b> is because <b>share</b> <b>options</b> can align the interests of management with those of the shareholders and in so doing reduce the extent of agency costs. The lack of an accounting requirement to recognise <b>share</b> <b>options</b> as an expense has also been found to influence the firms' decision to grant <b>share</b> <b>options</b> depending on its financial reporting position. The firm's tax position has also been associated with the decision to grant options based on the fact that firms cannot obtain a tax deduction for the value of <b>share</b> <b>options</b> granted. Finally, large firms with liquidity constraints have been found to be more likely to grant <b>share</b> <b>options,</b> due to the lack of available cash reserves for the payment of salaries. There has been no research as to whether the above explanatory variables influence the granting of <b>share</b> <b>options</b> by South African firms. The objective of this study is to investigate whether the variables that were identified internationally as being associated with <b>share</b> <b>option</b> grants apply to grants made to South African executive directors. This study examines whether the extent of <b>share</b> <b>options</b> granted is associated with various financial reporting and tax indicators, proxies for agency costs, the firm's size and its liquidity. Data from 61 firms over 2000 and 2001 was obtained. A total of 33 firms that granted <b>share</b> <b>options</b> were examined together with 28 firms that did not. The value of <b>share</b> <b>options</b> was measured using the dividend-adjusted Black Scholes model, and the dependent variable was calculated to be the value of <b>share</b> <b>options</b> granted during the year divided by the sum of the value of <b>share</b> <b>options</b> granted and the annual cash salary paid to the executives. This variable was regressed against thirteen independent variables identified in previous research. The results of this research indicate strongly that the larger the finn and the greater the extent of future growth opportunities (represented by the ratio of research and development to total assets), the more likely it is that finns will grant options, both of which are consistent with existing theoty. Option granting behaviour was also found to differ across industries and there was some evidence that the more difficult it is to monitor executive's performance (represented by the ratio of the variance in return on equity to the variance in share price), the more likely it is that the finn will grant options. Variables that were statistically significant but in the opposite direction to what was expected were growth in assets and the market-to-book ratio, both of which were negatively correlated with option granting behaviour. TIlls inconsistency may however be due to the fact that the data from the sample may not be a true reflection of the population. Financial reporting incentives, tax disincentives, liquidity, and two proxies for agency costs (the variance of market-adjusted returns and the ratio of the variance of marketadjusted returns to total returns) were not found to be significantly associated with option granting. TIlls suggests that the lack of a requirement to recognise <b>share</b> <b>options</b> as an expense; no deductions of <b>share</b> <b>options</b> for tax purposes; the fact that executive's choose to invest in projects that yield highly variable returns; and that finns that have a large amount of noise in their share price relative to the market, do not influence the decision to grant <b>share</b> <b>options</b> in South Africa. It therefore appears that the key drivers for granting <b>share</b> <b>options</b> to South African executive directors are finn size, unclear signals between earnings performance and the quality of manager's decisions and the desire to reduce agency costs by encouraging managers to focus on long-term investment opportunities...|$|R

40|$|Equity {{and credit}} markets are often treated as {{independent}} markets. In this dissertation our objec- tive is to hedge {{a position in}} a credit default swap with either <b>shares</b> or <b>share</b> <b>options.</b> Structural models enable us to link credit risk to equity risk via the ¯rm's asset value. With an extended version of the seminal Merton (1974) structural model, we value credit default swaps, <b>shares</b> and <b>share</b> <b>options</b> using arbitrage pricing theory. Since {{we are interested in}} hedging the change in value of a credit default swap dynamically, we use a jump-di®usion model for the ¯rm's asset value in order to model the short term credit risk dynamics more accurately. Our mathematical model does not admit an explicit solutions for credit default swaps, <b>shares</b> and <b>share</b> <b>options,</b> thus we use a Brownian Bridge Monte Carlo procedure to value these ¯nancial products and to compute the delta hedge ratios. These delta hedge ratios measure the sensitivity of the value of a credit default swap with respect to either share or European <b>share</b> <b>option</b> prices. We apply these delta hedge ratios to simulated and market data, to test our hedging objective. The hedge performs well for the simulated data for both cases where the hedging instrument is either <b>shares</b> or <b>share</b> <b>options.</b> The hedging results with market data suggests that we are able to hedge the value of a credit default swap with shares, however it is more di±cult with <b>share</b> <b>options...</b>|$|R

40|$|This paper {{shows that}} settlement-date {{accounting}} for equity <b>share</b> <b>options</b> {{can be seen}} as an accounting method which implements a shareholder focused residually rewarded partners’ equity view. This equity view represents a simple, natural extension of the shareholder proprietary view. It implicates an equity and income sharing model for accounting which is characterized by specification of both shareholders’ and non-shareholders’ parts of total equity and income. When using this equity and income sharing model, the remeasurements of equity <b>share</b> <b>option</b> obligations made by settlement-date accounting are fully conceptually valid. They represent measurements of one partner group’s share of total equity with effect for another group’s share of total equity and income: the shareholders’ part. Partially, this equity and income sharing model is already the basis for existing accounting standards. It is shown that an intriguing implication of the equity and income sharing model is the fact that treasury shares can hedge present shareholders’ share price risk from the obligation to holders of equity <b>share</b> <b>options.</b> A special hedge accounting construct is needed to account for this hedge effect, and the construct of this model is shown. Numerical simulations are used to illustrate the long run expense effects for shareholders from equity <b>share</b> <b>options</b> by settlement-date accounting both when the expense effects are unhedged and when they are hedged with treasury share holdings. The results demonstrate that the expenses resulting from settlement-date accounting for equity <b>share</b> <b>option</b> awards are significantly higher on average than the expenses resulting from grant-date accounting. And they show that the cost of equity, the share price volatility and the lifetime of the equity <b>share</b> <b>options</b> are important determinants for the size of the differences in total expenses, which in a long run perspective is to be expected from the use of these two alternative accounting models for equity <b>share</b> <b>options.</b> The simulation results demonstrate that hedging with treasury share holdings is very effective to stabilize expenses resulting from options granted to employeesNo keywords;...|$|R
