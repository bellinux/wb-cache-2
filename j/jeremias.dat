5|$|Van Rensselaer had {{a marked}} {{effect on the}} history of the United States. The American Van Rensselaers all descend from Kiliaen's son <b>Jeremias</b> and the {{subsequent}} Van Rensselaer family is noted for being a very powerful and wealthy influence in the history of New York and the Northeastern United States, producing multiple State Legislators, Congressmen, and two Lieutenant Governors in New York.|$|E
5|$|Van Rensselaer's son <b>Jeremias</b> is {{the sole}} {{ancestor}} of the entire Van Rensselaer family in America, and only because of Kiliaen's purchase {{and development of the}} land in New Netherland. Included in the subsequent family tree is a very powerful and wealthy group of individuals over the course of American history. Within the paternal (Van Rensselaer) lineage, the family has produced numerous New York State Assemblymen and Senators, two Lieutenant Governors of New York, and five Congressmen from New York between 1789 and 1842.|$|E

5|$|Realistic {{religious}} painting, sometimes entire {{series of}} related works, served its didactic purpose. Nudity and mythological themes were banned, {{but other than}} that fancy collection of Western paintings were in vogue. Sigismund III brought from Venice Tommaso Dolabella. A prolific painter, he was {{to spend the rest of}} his life in Kraków and give rise to a school of Polish painters working under his influence. Danzig (Gdańsk) was also a center for graphic arts; painters Herman Han and Bartholomäus Strobel worked there, and so did Willem Hondius and <b>Jeremias</b> Falck, who were engravers. As compared with the previous century, even wider circles of the society participated in cultural activities, but Catholic Counter-Reformation pressure resulted in diminished diversity. Catastrophic wars in the middle of the century greatly weakened the Commonwealth's cultural development and influence in the region.|$|E
5|$|Angola {{held the}} first round of its 1992 presidential {{election}} on 29–30 September. Dos Santos officially received 49.57% of the vote and Savimbi won 40.6%. As no candidate received 50% or more of the vote, election law dictated a second round of voting between the top two contenders. Savimbi, along with eight opposition parties and many other election observers, said the election had been neither free nor fair. An official observer wrote that there was little UN supervision, that 500,000 UNITA voters were disenfranchised and that there were 100 clandestine polling stations. Savimbi sent <b>Jeremias</b> Chitunda, Vice President of UNITA, to Luanda to negotiate the terms of the second round. The election process broke down on 31 October, when government troops in Luanda attacked UNITA. Civilians, using guns they had received from police a few days earlier, conducted house-by-house raids with the Rapid Intervention Police, killing and detaining hundreds of UNITA supporters. The government took civilians in trucks to the Camama cemetery and Morro da Luz ravine, shot them, and buried them in mass graves. Assailants attacked Chitunda's convoy on 2 November, pulling him out of his car and shooting him and two others in their faces. The MPLA massacred over ten thousand UNITA and FNLA voters nationwide in a few days in what was known as the Halloween Massacre. Savimbi said the election had neither been free nor fair and refused to participate in the second round. He then proceeded to resume armed struggle against the MPLA.|$|E

25|$|On 17 November 1917 Britons {{captured}} Jaffa {{and most}} male parishioners of Austrian, German or Ottoman nationality from Jaffa and Sarona, including Rabenau, were interned in Wilhelma as enemy nationals. In 1918 the interned men were deported to a camp south of Gaza, while the parishioners remaining in Jaffa {{were subjected to}} strict police control. In August 1918 the internees were relocated to Sidi Bishr and Helwan near Alexandria in Egypt. Rabenau and the internees built up congregational life in their Egyptian exile, lasting three years. With the Treaty of Versailes becoming effective on 10 January 1920 the Egyptian camps were dissolved and Rabenau became the internees' coordinator of the closedown. Most internees returned to the Holy Land, except of those banned by a British black list, such as D. Dr. Friedrich <b>Jeremias,</b> Provost of Jerusalem. Rabenau went to Germany to reunite with his family, the Britons refused his return to Jaffa in July 1920. In April 1921 the Prussian Evangelical Supreme Ecclesiastical Council appointed Gustaf Dalman, formerly head of the German Protestant Institute of Archaeology in Jerusalem as Provost at the Evangelical Church of the Redeemer until Albrecht Alt arrived.|$|E

25|$|This {{situation}} {{continued for}} some time, {{and in the}} intervening years what is now Western and Central Ukraine came under the rule of the Polish-Lithuanian Commonwealth. The Polish king Sigismund III Vasa was heavily influenced by the ideals of the Counter-Reformation and wanted to increase the Catholic presence in Ukraine. Meanwhile, the clergy of the Ruthenian lands were ruled from distant Constantinople, and much of the population was loyal to Ruthenian Orthodoxy rather than to the Polish Catholic monarch. Persecution of the Orthodox population grew, and under pressure of Polish authorities the clergy of the Ruthenian Church agreed by the Union of Brest in 1595 to break from the Patriarchate of Constantinopole and unite with the Catholic Church under the authority of the ruler of the Commonwealth, Sigismund III Vasa, in exchange for ending the persecution. In an effort to stop further Polonization processes and recent recognition of the Moscow Patriarchate by <b>Jeremias</b> II of Constantinople, in 1596 the Ruthenian Orthodox Church signed the agreement with the Holy See. The union was not accepted by {{all the members of the}} Ruthenian Orthodox Church in these lands, and marked the creation of Uniate Church and separate eparchies that continued to stay Orthodox among which were Lviv eparchy, Peremyshel eparchy, Mukachevo eparchy and Lutsk eparchy that at first accepted the union but later oscillated back and forth.|$|E
