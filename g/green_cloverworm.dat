40|$|The {{effect of}} wild parsnip on parasitoids of soybean pests in central Iowa was {{examined}} in three components: {{assessment of the}} possible impact of parsnip on nearby crop-pest populations, confirmation of parasitoid visits at parsnip flowers, and assessment of the possible contribution of parsnip flowers to parasitoid longevity. Larval Lepidoptera in 7 soybean fields with parsnip borders and 4 fields without parsnip were sampled during two growing seasons. <b>Green</b> <b>cloverworms</b> (GCW), Plathypena scabra (F.), were 99 % of the caterpillars present in soybeans. GCW populations were 10 - 50 % higher in soybeans without nearby parsnip than in parsnip-bordered soybeans, but statistical anlyses showed no signficant differences between the numbers of insects in the 2 field types. Presence of parsnip had no significant effect on lepidopteran parasitization rates by the parasitoids tested;Yellow sticky traps caught many families of parasitoids in 7 parsnip plots near or distant from soybeans. Most identifiable Diptera were Tachinidae; 7 species were known GCW parasitoids. More of these species were trapped in the GCW outbreak year. More species, and generally larger numbers, of beneficial Diptera were trapped in soybean-associated wild parsnip than in parsnip alone, but the proximity of soybeans did not significantly affect trap catches of Diptera;More parasitic Hymenoptera were caught in soybean-associated wild parsnip. Five species of braconid GCW parasitoids were trapped in very low numbers, with {{no significant differences in}} numbers caught between plot types. Rogas nolophanae Ashmead, the braconid most commonly reared from GCW, was nearly absent on traps. Among the 14 subfamilies of Ichneumonidae trapped, only Vulgichneumon brevicinctor (Say) was known to attack GCW. More than 20 families of Hymenoptera-Parasitica (excluding Ichneumonoidea) were caught, but no species was a known GCW parasitoid. None of the Diptera and Hymenoptera parasitic on GCW differed significantly in abundance between types of parsnip plots;Live, reared adult GCW parasitoids were held in the laboratory in {{the presence or absence of}} wild parsnip flowers. Parsnip presence failed to significantly enhance survivorship in any species tested;These combined results suggest that wild parsnip fulfills a minor role in maintaining GCW parasitoids; thus, weed management practices directed at parsnip near soybeans should not have a significant impact on natural control of GCW populations exerted by parasitoids...|$|R

40|$|ABSTRACT Title of Document:	THE ROLE OF HOST-PLANT SPECIES IN THE DIFFERENTIATION OF SYMPATRIC POPULATIONS OF HYMENOPTERAN PARASITOIDS. 	 	Raul F. Medina, PhD, 2005 	 Directed By:	Professor, Pedro Barbosa, Department of Entomology The {{biology and}} ecology of insect parasitoids is {{strongly}} influenced by the host-plant species on which their herbivorous hosts occur. Hymenopteran parasitoids in particular, present a series of characteristics that made them good candidates for phenotypic and genotypic differentiation. Thus, parasitoid adaptation to plant traits may promote significant phenotypic and genotypic differences among sympatric populations of parasitoids associated with different host-plant species. The present study assessed phenotypic and genotypic differentiation in two braconid parasitoids ovipositing on the same host species, the <b>green</b> <b>cloverworm,</b> Plathypena scabra Fabricius (Lepidoptera: Noctuidae) feeding on alfalfa and soybean. 	Developmental time, adult weight, percent parasitism and preference for host-plant odors of the generalist parasitoid Cotesia marginiventris Cresson (Hymenoptera: Braconidae) and of the specialist parasitoid Aleiodes nolophanae Ashmead (Hymenoptera: Braconidae) were compared among individuals ovipositing in <b>green</b> <b>cloverworm</b> larvae feeding on alfalfa and soybean. In addition, amplified fragment length polymorphisms (AFLP) {{were used to assess}} if genotypic differentiation between parasitoids ovipositing on <b>green</b> <b>cloverworm</b> larvae feeding on different host-plant species (i. e., alfalfa or soybean) was present. 	Phenotypic differentiation in adult mass, adult longevity and percent parasitism between parasitoids ovipositing <b>green</b> <b>cloverworm</b> larvae on alfalfa and on soybean were found. These phenotypic differences between parasitoids associated with different host-plant species were observed in both the generalist and the specialist parasitoids. No evidence of parasitoids showing preferences for the host-plant species from which their host fed was found in the generalist nor in the specialist parasitoid. Contrary to the expectations and predictions from the literature, these parasitoid species did not show evidence of reproductive isolation when associated with different host-plant species (i. e., alfalfa or soybean), as evidenced by the lack of genetic differentiation in AFLP profiles between parasitoids associated with alfalfa and soybean. In order to ensure that the number of wasps and the number of AFLP bands used were enough to provide an accurate assessment of genetic differentiation among wasps ovipositing hosts on different host-plant species, a method for determining the minimum number of individuals and AFLP bands to include to obtain accurate genetic profiles of hypothesized populations was proposed...|$|E

40|$|Glyphosate is a broad-spectrum {{herbicide}} that {{ranks among}} the top ten herbicides used in the U. S. for agricultural and non-agricultural use. Glyphosate is sprayed on 100 % of the crop area planted with genetically engineered crops resistant to RoundUpRTM such as soybean (RoundUpRTM Ready Soybeans).;It has been determined that glyphosate has fungicidal properties on some pathogenic and saprophytic fungi. Studying the interaction of glyphosate with entomopathogenic fungi is important because a wider use of this herbicide is predicted with glyphosate-tolerant crops. Under normal weather conditions, entomopathogenic fungi are considered the most important mortality factor of several arthropod pests in Iowa (insects and spider mites), maintaining their populations below economic thresholds.;The main objective {{of this research was}} to determine if outbreaks of twospotted spider mite (Tetranychus urticae Koch) and <b>green</b> <b>cloverworm</b> populations (Hypena scabra (F.)) could be expected with the use of transgenic glyphosate-resistant soybeans and their herbicides in commercial fields.;Laboratory studies determined that some RoundUpRTM formulations, and not the active ingredient (glyphosate), had fungicidal properties on four entomopathogenic fungi important in Iowa crops (Neozygites floridiana Weiser and Muma, Nomuraea rileyi (Farlow) Samson, Beauveria bassiana (Balsamo) Vuillemin, and Metarhizium anisopliae (Metchnikoff) Sorokin). Host suitability studies showed that <b>green</b> <b>cloverworm</b> does equally well developmentally, and possibly reproductively, when fed traditional varieties and glyphosate treated and non-treated varieties.;Field studies conducted in 1999 (Iowa, Minnesota and Ohio) and 2000 (Iowa) showed that in drought conditions, commercial fields planted with RoundUp RTM Ready Soybeans had higher spider mite populations than fields planted with traditional varieties. Occurrence of N. floridiana (entomopathogen of spider mites) was lower in fields planted with RoundUp RTM Ready Soybeans than with traditional varieties. No statistical differences were detected in <b>green</b> <b>cloverworm</b> populations or occurrence of its entomopathogenic fungus (N. rileyi) between transgenic and traditional varieties.;Results from these studies suggest that outbreaks of twospotted spider mite are more likely to occur on RoundUpRTM Ready Soybeans than on traditional varieties under environmental conditions suitable for spider mites...|$|E
40|$|The {{separate}} and combined effects of velvetleaf competition and simulated <b>green</b> <b>cloverworm</b> (SGCW) defoliation were evaluated in a 3 -year field study (1979 through 1981). Statistical documentation of velvetleaf competition stress (3 duration intervals x 2 weed densities plus a weed-free soybean control) {{was limited to}} soybeans in weed-proximate locations at the tested densities. Pre-harvest weed-induced reductions in nodes with unrolled leaves (1981 only) and certain component and total dry weight (DWT), mean crop growth rate (CGR),(2 ̆ 7) and mean relative growth rate (RGR) fractions were determined from samples collected 6 or more weeks after emergence. The SGCW defoliation procedure (4 or 5 densities were simulated through a temperature-dependent defoliation-developmental model by hole-punching) reduced soybean leaf area, height, lodging, certain component and total DWTs, CGRs,(2 ̆ 7) and RGRs. Nodal development lagged slightly in 1980 defoliated plots. Little evidence of compensatory growth has noted in plots where stresses were terminated by weed removal or SGCW pupation. None of the 28 or 35 treatment combinations altered soybean stand counts, branching, reproductive development, or gravimetric soil moisture determinations significantly. Statistical confirmation of velvetleaf and <b>green</b> <b>cloverworm</b> treatment interactions was not realized through the analysis of soybean growth and development;A standardized system of describing velvetleaf vegetative and reproductive development was proposed. An undescribed beetle of the family Bruchidae (Abutiloneus new species) emerged from velvetleaf seed. Monocropped velvetleaf eventually exceeded velvetleaf intercropped with soybeans in most growth characteristics. Soybeans began stressing intercropped weeds within 4 weeks of emergence. Few velvetleaf growth characteristics increased in response to linear increases in SGCW defoliation of adjacent full-blown soybeans. Simulated <b>green</b> <b>cloverworm</b> defoliation of adjacent soybeans did not alter weed heights significantly, but did affect the development of weed soybean/canopy height differentials (by stunting the crop). Furthermore, an analysis of weed/soybean canopy height differentials indicated that the temporal feasibility of certain late-season weed control devices (rope-wick applicators and recirculating sprayers) may vary, depending {{on the level of}} insect defoliation previously tolerated...|$|E

40|$|Field {{experiments}} were conducted during 1988 - 1991 for quantifying interactions among soybean, Glycine max, stresses from {{soybean cyst nematode}} (SCN), Heterodera glycines, acifluorfen plus bentazon herbicides, and <b>green</b> <b>cloverworm</b> (GCW), Plathypena scabra (Lepidoptera: Noctuidae). SCN and soybean responses were evaluated. Treatments were combinations of SCN density, acifluorfen plus bentazon rate, and simulated GCW defoliation level. A method developed for infesting soil with an SCN-root-soil inoculum was used in 1990 and 1991. Herbicide applications and defoliation were imposed at V 6 and R 2 to R 4 stages of soybean development, respectively. Herbicides always stressed soybean, as indicated by visual evaluations of foliar injury. Likewise, defoliation reduced soybean leaf area in 1989, 1990, and 1991. No determinations of leaf area were made in 1988. Herbicides consistently decreased SCN soil densities, although applications never increased soybean seed yield. SCN soil densities generally were unaffected by defoliation. Because of extreme confounding from iron deficiency chlorosis and drought in 1988, data for that year were not used for evaluations of soybean response. Herbicides and defoliation limited soybean growth and yield in 1990 and 1991. Excessive injury from SCN likely precluded similar responses in 1989. Preharvest growth parameters reduced by herbicides included leaf area, plant height, pod number, and leaf, pod, and support (stem and petiole) dry weights; while defoliation reduced plant height and leaf dry weight. Moreover, herbicides and defoliation interacted to reduce seed yield over 1990 and 1991. Yield reductions primarily were attributed to decreases in pod number (defoliation) and weight per seed (herbicides). When desired stress from SCN was achieved (1990), interaction with herbicides decreased leaf stomatal conductance, increased visual crop injury, and reduced preharvest growth (leaf area, leaf number, pod number, and pod weight) and seed yield. Additionally, SCN and defoliation interacted in 1990, reducing seed yield. Canopy interception of photosynthetically active radiation was a key mechanism underlying yield reductions from SCN, herbicides, and defoliation. Management recommendations, including adjusted economic decision levels for GCW, were made to deal with SCN x herbicides, SCN x defoliation, and herbicides x defoliation effects...|$|E
40|$|Soybean {{response}} to simulated <b>green</b> <b>cloverworm</b> (Plathypena scabra (F.)) (GCW) defoliation {{was investigated in}} several experiments from 1980 to 1983. The primary goals of this research were: (1) to assess the fidelity of simulation methods to actual insect defoliation for one basic physiological process, transpiration; (2) to determine if soybean {{response to}} defoliation varies between simulation methods; and (3) to elucidate the general effects of defoliation at full bloom on soybean growth, development, yield, and yield components;Water loss from potted soybean after defoliation by simulation methods and actual insects demonstrated significant, but transitory, differences during the first 16 hours. Total water loss over three days did not differ between simulated and actual insect defoliation. Therefore, simulation methods produced acceptable fidelity in soybean water-loss to actual insect defoliation;Simulation methods elicited different responses to defoliation. Each component of a simulation method, technique and temporal pattern, affected remaining leaf area, height, yield, and yield components. Punch-defoliated plants possessed less leaf area, height, and yield than pick-defoliated plants. One-day defoliation resulted in more leaf area, taller plants, and greater yields than either insect-model or equal defoliation. Yield differentials between methods were sufficiently large to significantly affect yield-loss estimates and economic injury levels (EILs);Simulated GCW defoliation at full-bloom (R 2) produced linear reductions in leaf area, height, lodging susceptibility, and yield. Defoliation reduced leaf area in nodes 6 - 11, but reduced yields in nodes 4 - 9. This downward shift, presumably, involved downward translocation from upper undefoliated leaves. Defoliation primarily reduced yields through decreased pod and seed number and, secondarily, through smaller seed size;The EIL for first generation GCW larvae was established at 298, 500 larval equivalents per ha or 23 per m of row (76 cm row width). Comprehensive EILs, reflecting moisture stress on the crop, were also derived. A general theory on incorporating survivorship information into economic thresholds was developed and illustrated using the GCW in Iowa soybean...|$|E

(Lepidoptera:Noctuidae), populations and {{associated}} natural mortality agents, especially Nomuraea rileyi (Farlow) Samson (Hyphomycetes:Moniliales), were divided into six parts;In Part I, significantly fewer GCW larvae occurred in till-plant and no-till soybean plots than in fall moldboard plow and fall chisel plow plots {{during the first year}} of the study. Substantially more larvae occurred in plots that were fall moldboard plowed than in reduced-tillage plots in the second year. The differences in tillage plot GCW numbers were not explained by analysis of moth activity nor by the occurrence of natural biotic mortality agents, including N. rileyi. In Part II, consumption patterns of soybean leaf tissue by N. rileyi-infected larvae, up to the times of their deaths, were very similar to those of healthy larvae. The annual occurrence of N. rileyi-infected larvae and data presented in Part III suggested that N. rileyi conidia and stroma survive Iowa winters to initiate mycoses in host larvae the next season;Part IV compared GCW larval populations and incidences of biotic mortality agents in alfalfa and soybean habitats. In central Iowa, alfalfa fields may act as 2 ̆ 2 nurseries 2 ̆ 2 for biotic mortality agents. Early-season N. rileyi infections of alfalfa GCW larvae may supply inocula for infections of soybean GCW larvae later in the season. In Part V, analyses of 10 years of GCW collections in soybean provided several quantitative expressions that help explain GCW population dynamics in Iowa. The dates of first N. rileyi occurrence may be predicted by regression equations that use the accumulated number of larva-days during the season and the accumulated precipitation from 1 June as independent variables. Also, the seasonal increase in rate of N. rileyi-caused mortality in outbreak GCW populations is described as a function of the number of days after the date of initial detection of infected larvae. Part VI traced N. rileyi mycoses in infected GCW larvae. After cuticular penetration and hemocoel colonization, the pathogen invaded all body tissues and caused larval death in ca. 6 to 7 days.
