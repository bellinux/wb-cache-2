25|$|Direct ascents {{can be made}} via Levers <b>Hawse</b> to {{the south}} or Swirl <b>Hawse</b> to the east. Both can be gained from Coniston and Swirl <b>Hawse</b> is also a {{practicable}} objective from Little Langdale. The right of way shown up the western (Duddon) side of Levers <b>Hawse</b> does not exist as a path on the ground. Many walkers will arrive on Swirl How via one of the surrounding fells, all four ridges carrying fair paths.|$|E
25|$|The eastern arm of Swirl How leads {{down the}} stony slope of Prison Band to the {{depression}} at Swirl <b>Hawse.</b> From here it rises over the subsidiary top of Black Sails {{to the main}} summit of Wetherlam. Swirl <b>Hawse</b> Beck runs south from this ridge to feed Levers Water, whilst {{to the north of}} Wetherlam is Greenburn.|$|E
25|$|The ridge {{north from}} Brim Fell narrows to the {{depression}} at Levers <b>Hawse</b> (2,250ft) before climbing again over the rougher ground of Great How Crags {{to the summit}} of Swirl How. To the south, trending south east across a broad plateau is The Old Man of Coniston, the reascent being negligible. Halfway between Brim Fell and 'The Old Man' a further ridge branches off due west, dropping steeply to Goat's <b>Hawse</b> (2,130ft), before swinging south around Goat's Water to Dow Crag.|$|E
2500|$|On 7 and 9 April 1806 Moucheron, by this time, {{and perhaps}} earlier, again under <b>Hawse's</b> command, {{captured}} the Prussian galliot Jonge Cornelius {{and the ship}} Mercurius, which carrying eight cases of coffee. In between, on 8 April, she shared with the gun-brigs [...] and [...] in the capture of the Minerva.|$|R
60|$|From the top I had a {{good view}} of the offing, and of the coast for leagues. We were now quite a mile at sea, and, though the tide was no longer of any use to us, we were drawing through the water quite at the rate of two knots. I thought that the flood had made, and that it took us a little on our lee-bow, <b>hawsing</b> us up to windward. Just as I had got the last lanyard fastened, the canoes began to appear, coming round the island by the farther passage, and {{promising}} to overtake us in the course of the next twenty minutes. The crisis demanded decision, and I determined to get the jib on the ship. Accordingly, I was soon on deck.|$|R
60|$|These {{few words}} {{explained}} the reason of the change. Instead of setting to leeward, the schooner was now meeting a powerful tide of some {{four or five}} knots, which <b>hawsed</b> her up to windward with irresistible force. As if conscious of the danger she was in, the tight little craft receded from the rocks as she shot ahead, and rounded that second point, which, a minute before, had appeared to be placed there purposely to destroy her. It was handsomely doubled, at the safe distance of a hundred fathoms, Roswell believed he might now beat his schooner off the land far enough to double the cape altogether, could he but keep her in that current. It doubtless expended itself, however, a short distance in the offing, as its waters diffused themselves on the breast of the ocean; {{and it was this}} diffusion of the element that produced the eddy which had proved so nearly fatal.|$|R
25|$|From Swirl How {{the east}} ridge drops steeply down Prison Band to Swirl <b>Hawse,</b> before rising {{again to the}} summit of Black Sails. Black Sails has a {{descending}} southern spur which steps down over High and Low Wether Crags. Between this and the main Coniston range is the valley of Swirl <b>Hawse</b> Beck and Levers Water. This tarn has been raised by damming {{to a depth of}} 125ft, originally to supply water to the Coniston Copper Mines. Following the decline of mining a water treatment plant was built, and since the 1970s the tarn has supplied drinking water for Coniston and other local villages as far east as Sawrey.|$|E
25|$|The main ridge {{continues}} southward, {{stepping down}} Great and Little How Crags to the depression of Levers <b>Hawse.</b> From here it rises again to Brim Fell with Dow Crag and The Old Man Of Coniston beyond. To {{the west of}} the <b>Hawse</b> is the valley of Tarn Head Beck, the main feeder of Seathwaite Tarn, a reservoir in a side valley of the Duddon system. This was originally a much smaller waterbody, but was dammed early in the 20th century to provide drinking water for the Barrow-in-Furness area. The dam is almost 400yards long and is concrete cored with slate buttresses, the resulting depth of the tarn being around 80ft. Water is not abstracted directly from the tarn, but flows some distance downriver to an off-take weir. To the east of Levers <b>Hawse</b> is Levers Water. This smaller tarn has also been raised by damming, but in this case the original user was the Coniston Copper Mines. Following the decline of mining in the late 19th century a water treatment plant was eventually built and the tarn now supplies drinking water for Coniston village.|$|E
25|$|Walkers {{approaching}} from Little Langdale or Tilberthwaite can {{take any of}} a number of paths to Birk Fell <b>Hawse,</b> a small col to the north-east of the summit {{at the foot of the}} ridge of Wetherlam Edge. It is then a steep ascent (around 200 metres in half a kilometre) up the latter ridge to reach the summit.|$|E
25|$|The summit {{bears no}} cairn, being a rocky point perched {{directly}} above the crag. The view {{south and west}} to the coast is excellent, but much of Lakeland is blotted out by the flanks of the Coniston range. The Scafells are far enough west to put in an appearance and Skiddaw and the Helvellyn range can be seen through Fairfield and Levers <b>Hawse.</b>|$|E
25|$|The higher {{northern}} part of the range can be likened to an inverted 'Y' in plan. Brim Fell stands at the junction of the three arms with the northern branch continuing over Swirl How and Great Carrs. The south western branch traverses to Dow Crag and the south eastern to The Old Man of Coniston, with Goat's Water lying in a deep depression between the two. The connecting ridge from Dow Crag to Brim Fell crosses the depression of Goat's <b>Hawse</b> above the head of the tarn, the Dow Crag side in particular being steep and rough.|$|E
25|$|The vessels were {{designed}} {{with a single}} deck with a long raised quarter deck carried to the fore side of the trawl winch and also a raised top-gallant forecastle. On the forecastle deck a windlass for working the winch was fitted, and an anchor of the stockless type housed in a long <b>hawse</b> pipe. An iron breakwater was also fitted to divert the sea when the vessels are being driven in heavy weather. The crew was housed under the forecastle deck, the entrance being through a lobby on the starboard side over which the forecastle deck was carried affording ample protection to the crew when entering or leaving the forecastle in heavy weather.|$|E
25|$|The {{simplest}} direct routes {{begin at}} either end of the Walna Scar Road, making for the summit from the top of the pass. Ascents can be made from Seathwaite Tarn (pathless) or to the north of Goat's <b>Hawse,</b> but these give no clue to the grandeur of the crag on the eastern side of the ridge. For this the walker will leave the Walna Scar Road at The Cove, or climb to this point from Torver. From here Goat's Water is the next objective for a stunning view of Dow Crag. Two choices now present themselves- easy via Goat's Hause, or steep via the South Rake (see below). Many walkers will also reach the fell using the good paths from The Old Man of Coniston and Brim Fell.|$|E
500|$|On 1 September 2014, {{a larger}} search by a Canadian team {{under the banner}} of the [...] "Victoria Strait Expedition" [...] found two items on Hat Island in the Queen Maud Gulf near Nunavut's King William Island â€” a wooden object, {{possibly}} a plug for a deck <b>hawse,</b> the iron pipe through which the ship's chain cable would descend into the chain locker below; and part of a boat-launching davit bearing the stamps of two Royal Navy broad arrows.|$|E
2500|$|Direct ascents {{are perhaps}} unusual, most walkers {{traversing}} from [...] "The Old Man" [...] to Swirl How, but perfectly possible. The easiest access is from Coniston, climbing via Levers Water to Levers <b>Hawse.</b> Pathless ascents of Raven Tor {{can also be}} made from either side for a wilder finish. The Walna Scar Road (Byway open to all traffic) gives access to Goat's <b>Hawse</b> from {{either side of the}} ridge and this is the easiest route from the Duddon. Note that a right of way shown on Ordnance Survey maps descending west from Levers <b>Hawse</b> to Seathwaite Tarn does not exist as a path on the ground.|$|E
2500|$|The {{crew had}} to run {{up most of the}} sails to avoid being blown on shore. [...] Heeled over, the <b>hawse</b> plugs were washed in and the ship took on large amounts of water on the gun deck.|$|E
2500|$|A {{powerful}} steam windlass {{was situated}} {{forward on the}} shelter deck for working the anchors, which were arranged to be stowed in <b>hawse</b> pipes, and two large capstans were fitted aft on the shelter deck for warping purposes. A combined steam and hand steering engine was also located aft, and this was controlled by a telemotor gear from the navigating bridge. There was also a powerful steering gear situated forward, the purpose of which was to operate a bow rudder so as to facilitate the quick turning and manoeuvring of the vessel when entering or leaving port.For the stern rudder there was a combined steam and hand gear.|$|E
2500|$|After {{their ship}} trials, several changes were made. The four ships {{were given a}} {{retractable}} bow spar in 1938-1939, which changed their lengths, from 114m (374 ft) to [...] between perpendiculars, and 119m (390 ft) to [...] overall. All four ships were initially fitted with a staukeil, a short keel that had a shallow wedge shaped cross section, under their transoms, {{in order to improve}} their turning circles. These were removed in 1940-1942. Although they initially all had forecastle sheer strakes on each side, in 1938 this was changed to a narrow spray deflector on their undersides, between their forwardmost 12.7 cm gun, and their anchor <b>hawse.</b> During this time, their sterns were also changed, being raised by [...] and extended by [...] Between 1937 and 1938, Z2 Georg Thieles spray deflector was wider on its foreship, but after this it was the same as the other three ships of its class. The four ships had their original upper bridge with a half-round front face removed in 1938, which was replaced with a new bridge, which was vaguely pentagonal in shape. In mid-1941, Z4 Richard Beitzen was fitted with a FuMO 24/25 and a FuMO 63 Hohentwiel.|$|E
2500|$|Strong winds drove Hermes off station when near Beachy Head he {{discovered}} a large French lugger {{in the midst}} of a number of English vessels. The French privateer had already taken one prize and might have taken others had Hermes not arrived. After a chase of two hours, in which the lugger sustained some damage and had several men wounded, the privateer struck to Hermes. As Hermes slowed, the strong wind broke her maintop-sail-yard in the slings and her fore-sail split. The privateer immediately tried to escape on the opposite tack. Hermes managed to turn and by cramming on all sail caught up with the privateer although she had gotten a two-mile lead. Browne decided to run alongside, despite the gale to prevent the French vessel from escaping again. Unfortunately, as the lugger crossed Hermess <b>hawse</b> a heavy sea caused Hermes to run over the lugger, sinking her. [...] Hermes was unable to launch any boats and so was only able to save 12 out of the lugger's 51 men. (Another 10 men had been aboard the lugger's prize, which had escaped to France during the chase, taking with her the prize's crew.) The lugger turned out to be the Mouche of Boulogne, under the command of M. Gageux. She had carried fourteen 12-pounder and 6-pounder guns.|$|E
6000|$|... "In {{less than}} half-an-hour," [...] said Blood presently, [...] "we shall have her athwart our <b>hawse,</b> {{sweeping}} our decks with her guns." ...|$|E
6000|$|... 'Hoy there! Ahoy!' he bellowed, {{though his}} mouth was but {{a few yards from}} my ear. 'Would ye come across my <b>hawse</b> without slacking weigh? Clew up, d'ye see, clew up!' ...|$|E

60|$|In {{the midst}} of the noise and turbulence, a voice was heard, {{apparently}} issuing from the ocean, hailing the vessel by name, {{with the aid of a}} speaking-trumpet that had been applied to the outer circumference of a <b>hawse</b> hole.|$|E
6000|$|... "It is slack-water, Sir Gervaise, and {{the vessels}} are looking all ways at once. Most {{of us are}} {{clearing}} <b>hawse,</b> for there are more round turns in our cables, than I remember ever to have seen in so short a time." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Y-e-s, dat my {{judgment}} too," [...] {{put in the}} cook. [...] "We wishes you well, Jack, and we wishes Miss Rose well, and Mr. Mulford well, but we can't, no how, run ath'art <b>hawse,</b> as Josh says. Dat is {{my judgment}}, too." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I rather {{think she}} will to-day, Sir Wycherly, if Mildred is well enough to go; the good woman seldom lets her {{daughter}} stray far from her apron-strings. She keeps her, as I tell her, within the sweep of her own <b>hawse,</b> Sir Gervaise." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "See all clear," [...] {{called out}} Spike. [...] "D'ye hear there, for'ard! I shall make a half-board in the Gate, {{if the wind}} favour us, and the tide prove strong enough to <b>hawse</b> us to wind'ard {{sufficiently}} to clear the Pot--so mind your--" ...|$|E
6000|$|... 'Won't let me pass, won't ye?' he was shouting. 'Let me {{tell you}} I've held on my course when better men than you have asked me to veil topsails. I tell you I have the admiral's permit, and I won't clew up {{for a bit of}} a red-painted cock-boat; so move from athwart my <b>hawse,</b> or I may chance to run you down.' ...|$|E
6000|$|Little {{more than}} an hour before midnight another craft was {{observed}} driving down on the <b>hawse</b> of the Gull. There was greater danger now, because it happened to be near the turn of the tide, or [...] "slack water," [...] so that the rudder could not be used to advantage. All hands were once more turned out, and as the vessel drew near Mr Welton hailed her, but got no reply.|$|E
6000|$|... "He may {{say what}} he likes and do what he likes {{so long as he}} does not come athwart my <b>hawse</b> when I am working the ship," [...] said the captain. [...] "He is Governor of St. Kitt's, but I am Governor of the Morning Star. And, by his leave, I must weigh with the first tide, for I owe a duty to my employer, just as he does to King George." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Ay, ay, Guinea is {{like the}} launch {{of one of the}} coasters, always towing in your wake, master Harry; whereas I am often luffing athwart your <b>hawse,</b> or getting foul, in some fashion or other, on one of your quarters. Howsomever, we are both shipped, as you see, in this here cruise, with the {{particulars}} of which we are both well satisfied. So pass the word among us, {{what is to be done}} next, and no more parley." ...|$|E
60|$|Raoul did as {{the other}} desired, and after a short trial {{he found that the}} coaster had no {{perceptible}} motion ahead, while it was certain she was drifting down with the current directly athwart the lugger's <b>hawse.</b> This satisfied him that she must have drags astern; a circumstance that at once denoted a hostile intention. The enemy was probably on board the felucca, in force; and it was incumbent on him to make immediate preparations for defence.|$|E
6000|$|... "What I mean, young man," [...] {{said the}} Captain, sternly, [...] "is best known to myself. You and other College-bred coxcombs may call it day bwa, if you like, but I have {{overhauled}} the chart, and there it's spelt d-e-s, which sounds dez, and b-o-i-s, which seafarin' men pronounce boys, so don't go for to cross my <b>hawse</b> again, but rather {{join me in}} tryin' to indooce the Professor to putt off his trip to the Jardang, an' sail in company {{with us for the}} day." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Yes, your honour, that he is--that is {{just one}} of Sir Jarvy's weak p'ints, as a body might say.

6000|$|... "I tell you, Jack, you {{does n't}} know Cap'in Spike as well as I does," [...] Josh said, in {{continuance}} of the discourse.
