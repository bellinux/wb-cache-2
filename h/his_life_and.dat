5|$|Chatwin's {{writing was}} shaped by {{his work as a}} {{cataloguer}} at Sotheby's, which provided him with years of practice writing concise yet vivid descriptions of objects with the intention of enticing buyers. In addition, Chatwin's interest in nomads also influenced his writing. One aspect of nomadic culture that interested him was the few possessions they had. Their spartan way of life appealed to his aesthetic sense, and it was something he sought to emulate in both <b>his</b> <b>life</b> <b>and</b> his writing. He strove to strip unnecessary objects from <b>his</b> <b>life</b> <b>and</b> unnecessary words from his prose.|$|E
