Although New York {{was the center}} of the cartoon industry, he was {{attracted}} to Los Angeles because his brother Roy was convalescing from tuberculosis there. Disney's efforts to sell Alice's Wonderland were in vain until he heard from New York film distributor Margaret J. Winkler. She was losing the rights to both the Out of the <b>Inkwell</b> and Felix the Cat cartoons, and needed a new series. In October they signed a contract for six Alice comedies, with an option for two further series of six episodes each. Disney and his brother Roy formed the Disney Brothers Studiowhich later became The Walt Disney Companyto produce the films; they persuaded Davis and her family to relocate to Hollywood to continue production, with Davis on contract at $100 a month. In July 1924 Disney also hired Iwerks, persuading him to relocate to Hollywood from Kansas City.|$|E

25|$|On {{the fictional}} <b>Inkwell</b> Isle, Cuphead {{and his brother}} Mugman are two fun-loving kids who live {{under the watchful eye}} of Elder Kettle. Against the elder's warnings, the {{brothers}} wander into the Devil's Casino and play craps. When the brothers go on a winning streak, the casino's manager King Dice calls upon the Devil, who raises the stakes. If Cuphead and Mugman can win another time, they will own the entire casino; if not, the Devil will have their souls. Cuphead rolls snake eyes and he and Mugman must give up their souls. The brothers beg for mercy, so the Devil makes a deal with them: collect the contracts of other inhabitants of <b>Inkwell</b> Isle who have lost their souls by midnight the next day, and he might let them off the hook. They visit Elder Kettle, who gives them a potion that allows them to fire blasts from their fingers to aid in their quest.|$|E

This {{was done by the}} suspension of the <b>inkwell</b> at the center, which was mounted on a series of concentric metal rings so that it remained stationary no matter which way the pot is turned.|$|E

All items of kleinody except of kettledrum sticks were stored in the Sich's Pokrova church treasury and were taking out only on a special order of kish otaman. The kettledrum sticks were kept in the kurin with the assigned dovbysh. Sometimes part of kleidony was considered a great silver <b>inkwell</b> (kalamar), an attribute of a military scribe (pysar) of the Zaporizhian Host.

500|$|McCay's {{first three}} films were the {{earliest}} animated works {{to have a}} commercial impact; their success motivated film studios {{to join in the}} infant animation industry. [...] Other studios used McCay's combination of live action with animation, such as the Fleischer Studios series Out of the <b>Inkwell</b> (1918–1929) and Walt Disney's Alice Comedies series (1923–1927). [...] McCay's clean-line, high-contrast, realistic style set the pattern for American animation to come, and set it apart from the abstract, open forms of animation in Europe. [...] This legacy is most apparent in the feature films of the Walt Disney Animation Studios, for example in Fantasia(1940), which included anthropomorphic dinosaurs animated in a naturalistic style, with careful attention to timing and weight. [...] Shamus Culhane, Dave and Max Fleischer, Walter Lantz, Otto Messmer, Pat Sullivan, Paul Terry, and Bill Tytla were among the generation of American animators who drew inspiration from the films they saw in McCay's vaudeville act. Gerties reputation was such that animation histories long named it as the first animated film.|$|E
40|$|This {{study is}} focused on Roman lead-glazed <b>inkwells</b> from the archaeological site of the “Nuovo Mercato di Testaccio” (Rome, Italy) dated in the half 2 nd century AD. Optical {{microscopy}} (OM), X-ray powder diffraction (XRPD), Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy (FTIR), scanning electron microscopy (SEM) and electron microprobe analysis (EMPA) have been used. Petrographic analysis of the body indicated the occurrence of only one fabric. The reaction zone at the contact glaze/body is marked by the enucleating of euhedral Pb-bearing alkali feldspar from a felsic melt enriched in Pb as revealed by EMP analysis.

40|$|A {{category}} of small vessels fashioned in samian ware has conventionally been interpreted as representing <b>inkwells.</b> This identification seems valid given their typological characteristics. The type is fairly rare in Roman Britain, {{as in other}} western provinces. Nonetheless, {{it is well known}} through illustration and is sufficiently frequent to be familiar to those who study the period. Given the likely close form-function relationship of this type, its distribution is assessed in this paper as an archaeological index of the locations of writing and recording in Britannia using ink. Indeed, study of samian <b>inkwells</b> offers a seemingly reliable indicator of such activity. This prospect is almost unique given the rarity of other types of direct and indirect evidence for writing in ink from Roman Britain. Analysis shows, for the first time, that there is a clear pattern to the occurrence of samian <b>inkwells.</b> Most examples come from sites associated with the Roman military, with a sizeable proportion also recorded from major civil centres; elsewhere they are particularly infrequent. Examination of the spatial occurrence of these finds from within sites reveals a notable pattern. Many come from contexts at or close-by to locations where writing in ink might be expected. This is testimony to the rich potential of the archaeological record of this era to inform upon cultural practices...|$|R
