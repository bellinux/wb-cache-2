40|$|For the {{pharmaceutical}} industry, powder segregation {{can occur in}} many processes such as blending and compression solid dose unit operations. Yet {{it is important that}} the high quality standards of drug product manufacture are maintained throughout the whole processes. Powder segregation has been identified by {{the pharmaceutical}} industry as a potential issue, and in some cases it may cause variability in tablet assay and uniformity throughout a compression run. Early studies suggested for certain Direct Compression (DC) products, the separation of Active Pharmaceutical Ingredient (API) from excipients could arise due to air-induced segregation of the powders discharging from an <b>Intermediate</b> <b>Bulk</b> <b>Container</b> (<b>IBC)</b> to the tablet press via a vertical chute. Segregation tests were carried out on trial powder blend materials supplied by GlaxoSmithKline (GSK), using a laboratory-scale air elutriation test facility at The Wolfson Centre. Particle size analysis of the virgin and segregated sub-samples clearly indicated that powder segregation occurred as a result of aerodynamic effects. Subsequent chemical assay results concurred with the particle size results. Flowability testing of the powder blends indicated them to be free-flowing materials; this in addition to the presence of large particle size differentials within the powder blends is the likely cause of the susceptibility to air-induced segregation...|$|E
40|$|Aquaponic food {{systems have}} been gaining {{popularity}} {{over the last decade}} for their ability to simultaneously produce fish and vegetables within the confines of a single standalone system. Throughout the United States and Australia, organizations have implemented aquaponics on a large-scale for community food gardens. Most studies in this field focus on input requirements, productivity, and economic benefit of commercially-sized aquaponic systems. Little has been done on {{the opposite end of the}} spectrum, the personal, home-sized system and its potential to supply a family with low-cost food. This thesis investigates the feasibility of implementing a small-scale aquaponic system of 3 ̆c 200 gallons for household consumption. Feasibility was assessed on cost, construction process including tools and materials, productivity, and maintenance requirements. It is hypothesized that small-scale aquaponics systems can be easily constructed and maintained to augment household food supply, and that the use of recycled materials can reduce the startup costs and increase the rate of return for the aquaponics implementer. Research included the construction of two common aquaponic systems, the first with plastic 55 -gallon barrels using a design plan devised by Travis W. Hughey called barrel-ponics. The second, used an <b>Intermediate</b> <b>Bulk</b> <b>Container</b> (<b>IBC)</b> which acts as a grow bed and fish tank. Within both systems, tomatoes, bell peppers, jalapeno peppers, shishito peppers, kale, squash, and eggplant were grown. The fish species used to stock both tanks was Nile Tilapia (Oreochromis niloticus) with 20 in the IBC system and 5 in the barrel-ponic system. Over a three month grow period data was collected for productivity which included measurements of inputs, plant/fish growth and amount of produce harvested. Other factors that were analyzed included the construction process, cost to build and maintain each system, and the cost benefit of grown produce versus store bought produce. It was found that the IBC system was significantly easier to construct and maintain due it its simple design. The barrel-ponic system was cheaper and materials were somewhat more common although, there were many issues associated with its flood/drain system. At the observed level of productivity, both systems operating year-round would take several years to generate a positive return on investment. However, production trends were observed after the three-month period to continue to increase suggesting that a high output rate could be achieved and thus increase the rate of return. Small-scale aquaponic system such as these can be constructed relatively easily and maintained so long as there is access to informational documents, construction materials, reliable electrical grid, operational equipment, and adequate climate to support a yearlong grow season. Further research must be conducted on long term productivity levels for aquaponic systems at this scale as well as prices of materials to better determine the economic feasibility for household use...|$|E

40|$|Abstract—The use of {{flexible}} <b>intermediate</b> <b>bulk</b> <b>containers</b> (FIBCs), or “big bags ” {{as they are}} commonly known, is becoming widespread {{in a variety of}} industries, including chemical, phar-maceutical, and foodstuffs. Typically, FIBCs, roughly cubic in shape and constructed from woven polypropylene, are used to store and transport powdered or granular material in loads of between 300 – 1000 kg. In many cases, FIBCs are used in the vicinity of sensitive flammable atmospheres which may arise from the presence of dispersed combustible dusts or solvent vapors. Over the years, {{there have been a number}} of serious fires and explosions (particularly during the discharging of the bag con-tents) which have been attributed to static electricity. As a result, various “antistatic ” FIBC designs have been produced containing intrinsic features aimed at minimizing the risk of electrostatic ignition. This paper presents the results of a rigorous assessment of a variety of FIBC designs with regard to electrostatic ignition hazard in flammable atmospheres of minimum ignition energy 0. 12, 0. 25, and 1. 5 mJ. (The minimum ignition energy of methanol, a common industrial solvent, is 0. 14 mJ.) The study involved setting up a test rig to enable the FIBCs to be filled and emptied under controlled conditions of relative humidity. During these operations, the electrostatic activity in terms of surface potentials, electric field, and electrostatic discharge energy was carefully monitored. Incendiary discharges were quantified by using a calibrated propane/oxygen/nitrogen gas probe. The findings of this paper indicate which of the designs can be safely used in various industrial processes without risk of ignition.

40|$|Abstract: This paper {{describes}} {{the design and}} development ofa low cost indicator mechanism that is triggered by overloading. The method is applied to Flexible <b>Bulk</b> <b>Containers</b> (FJBCs) and detects overloading during handling. BACKGROUND Increasingly, packaging materials are being designed to satisfy complex multifunctional demands. this is in parallel with demands for cost reductions. In the area of agricultural materials. the response to this has been to develop Flexible <b>Intermediate</b> <b>Bulk</b> <b>Containers</b> (FIBCs). The industry standard some years past involved stacking low weight (50 - 100 kg) bags on wooden pallets and transporting these pallets from manufacturer to end-user site. With the advent of FIBCs these labour intensive methods of handling 0. 5 tonne, 1 tonne and 2 tonne loads have been superseded. In their place, single point lift and multiple point lift bags have reduced the cost of handling and storing bulk materials. These bags are simple to manufacture and yet provide a convenient medium to contain bulk materials. They are easily stacked and finally, do not require sophisticated lifting equipment during transportation. Their low cost of manufacture stems from {{the simplicity of the}} weaving and sewing methods used i...|$|R
40|$|Using a {{flexible}} <b>intermediate</b> <b>bulk</b> <b>container</b> (FIBC), also called a bulk bag, to ship and store dry bulk materials is Cost-effective, making the container increasingly popular for material suppliers and users, {{as well as}} custom packagers and shippers. This article discusses two industry trends- reusing and recycling FIBCs-as well as some cautions and guidelines you should know about. About FIBCs An FIBC is typically constructed of woven polypropylene and has a square or rectangular base. The inlet at the top is typicall) equipped with a filling spout, although other styles are used foi certain materials (Figure 1). The base can have a discharge out. let of various types (Figure 1) or be plain (requiring the bottom to be slit for discharge, which destroys the FIBC). The mos common FIBC (also called an inledoutlet FIBC) has both a fill ing inlet and a discharge outlet, rather than a plain bottom. T he Flexible <b>Intermediate</b> <b>Bulk</b> <b>Container</b> Association (FIBCA) includes regular members (US FIBC manufacturers and suppliers to these manufacturers) and associate members (foreign FIBC manufacturers who have a US representative). The FIBCA {{has been working with}} other associations and US regulatory agencies to recommend safety standards for handling hazardous and nonhazardous materials in FIBCs. Making this work especially challenging are two FIBC industry trends driven by the industry's desire to remain both competitive and ecologically responsible: reusing and recycling FIBCs that handle nonhazardous materials. If you use FIBCs, you're probably aware that more users are reusing or recycling FIBCs. But are these practices safe? And do they save money or provide other benefits? A look at some FIBC basics will provide useful background information for discussing these issues. Lifting loops are located at the FIBC's top four comers to permi lifting by a forklift truck. The FIBC can be lined to protect thl material or prevent the material from contaminating the envi ronment, workers, or the FIBC. Capacity ranges from 500 t' 8, 000 pounds. The fabric and construction provide the FIBC' safety factor (expressed as a ratio); the manufacturer tests th FIBC's safety factor to ensure it meets or exceeds performan...|$|R
25|$|Although {{the capital}} outlay can be high, it is {{desirable}} to use a meter-mix or dispense unit for even low-volume production operations that require a steady output of finished parts. Dispense equipment consists of material holding (day) tanks, metering pumps, a mix head, and a control unit. Often, a conditioning or heater-chiller unit is added to control material temperature {{in order to improve}} mix efficiency, cure rate, and to reduce process variability. Choice of dispense equipment components depends on shot size, throughput, material characteristics such as viscosity and filler content, and process control. Material day tanks may be single to hundreds of gallons in size, and may be supplied directly from drums, <b>IBCs</b> (<b>intermediate</b> <b>bulk</b> <b>containers,</b> such as totes), or bulk storage tanks. They may incorporate level sensors, conditioning jackets, and mixers. Pumps can be sized to meter in single grams per second up to hundreds of pounds per minute. They can be rotary, gear, or piston pumps, or can be specially hardened lance pumps to meter liquids containing highly abrasive fillers such as chopped or hammer milled glass fibres and wollastonite.|$|R

The report contains measures to stabilise the production processes for the key chemicals in 1 ppb-quality: hydrofluoric acid, ammonium hydroxide, ammonium fluoride solution, buffered oxide etchants (BOE), choline solution, hydrochloric acid and phosphoric acid. Lead elements are defined to monitor contamination levels and statistical methods are implemented to estimate process capability. For the production of 100 pp HF a special destillation process was developed in the frame of the project the process was optimised and resulted in the design and installation of a pilot unit. In the analytical field measures are reported to improve the analytical capabilities in the sub-ppb-range. Special achievements were made in the area of sampling and sample preparation. The determination limits for HF are well established below 50 ppt. Also new developments are reported in the field of packaging. Based on extensive material research guide lines were developed for the production of quality maintaining packages for 1 ppb- and 100 ppt-chemicals.
