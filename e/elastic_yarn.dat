40|$|Honeycomb {{woven fabric}} {{is a single}} layer of fabric exhibiting {{three-dimensional}} (3 D) cellular shape on both fabric sides due to the combination of periodic straight yarn floats and partial plain weave. In a fabric weave repeat, the triangle shape of increased yarn floats and crossed diagonal woven lines form two inverted pyramidal spaces on the fabric surfaces and a closed internal space. This particular 3 D architecture is bound to influence the fabric transfer and mechanical properties. This study investigated these properties for honeycomb weaves experimentally, including air resistance, thermal conductivity, water absorption and vapor transmission rate, bending rigidity, compressional energy and tensile behavior. The typical two-dimensional plain woven fabrics with the same yarns and density were set as references and <b>elastic</b> <b>yarns</b> were considered as a factor of effect on the fabric properties.

50|$|The {{number of}} ends per inch {{in a piece}} of woven cloth varies {{depending}} on the stage of manufacture. Before the cloth is woven, the warp has a certain number of ends per inch, which {{is directly related to the}} size reed being used. After weaving the number of ends per inch will increase, and it will increase again after being washed. This increase in the number of ends per inch (and picks per inch) and shrinkage in the size of the fabric is known as the take-up. The take-up is dependent on many factors, including the material and how tightly the cloth is woven. Tightly woven fabric shrinks more (and thus the number of ends per inch increases more) than loosely woven fabric, as do more <b>elastic</b> <b>yarns</b> and fibers.|$|R

Twelve fabric samples were knitted on an electronic flat knitting machine with three different linking distances and four diameters of spacer monofilaments. The compression tests were conducted to verify the negative stiffness effect of the fabrics after a steaming treatment.

They {{are widely used}} as power stretchable underwear, outerwear and sportswear for which the use of high elastic yarns is indispensable. For seamless garments knitted with circular seamless machines, polyurethane (PU) /polyamide (PA) core-spun yarn is commonly used as the base yarn in a plating fabric to enhance the elasticity of the garment. However, the use of PU/PA core-spun yarn has encountered some problems, such as the difficulty in size control and the ageing of PU <b>elastic</b> <b>yarn.</b> In this study, the polytrimethylene terephthalate (PTT) /polyester (PET) bi-component filament was used to replace the PU/PA core-spun yarn {{for the development of}} seamless garments due to its excellent extensibility and elastic recovery property. The manufacturing processes, including knitting, pre-treatment, dyeing and finishing, were developed, and the end-use performance of the fabrics, which were respectively produced with the PTT/PET bi-component filament and PU/PA core-spun yarn as the base yarn and PA fiber as the face yarn for seamless garments, was compared based on the five different mechanical and physical properties. The results show that the fabric made of the PTT/PET bi-component filament has much better dimensional stability, much better elastic recovery property and much better wrinkle resistance than those of the fabric made of PU/PA core-spun yarn. It is expected that this study could help us to further exploit the use of the PTT/PET bi-component filament in the development of seamless garments in the future.

This study developed 3 styles of seamless knitted bras with various loop length and <b>elastic</b> <b>yarn</b> tension based on a 2 2 full factorial experimental design with one additional centre level. Therefore, a total of 3 × 5 = 15 new seamless bra samples have been knitted. The skin pressure exerted by the new bras was compared with 4 commercial bras including 2 "cut and sewn" wired bras and 2 seamless knitted bras. Six women subjects of breast size 75 B*in our newly developed breast sizing system were invited to wear all the bra samples. The skin pressure exerted by the bra was measured by the Novel pliance-X pressure sensors on 11 body positions. The results indicated that newly developed seamless bras showed lower pressure than the commercial bras, but had a considerably higher pressure at the cup base point. The new seamless bras with the largest loop length presented the lowest pressure values. Furthermore, empirical equations were established to predict 2 critical pressure points at "apex" and "side bottom band" from two major knitting parameters.

Based on the position and crimp prediction of each yarn node, the architectures of the six fabrics were simulated numerically, which shows close agreement with the observed manufactured fabrics, indicating good accuracy of the geometrical model.

The goal of this research was to compare, in dry and wet states, the thermal comfort properties of elastic knitted fabrics with thermo-regulating yarns, namely Viscose Outlast® and Polyester Coolmax® to better understand thermal behavioral changes due to moisture content of the fabrics. Surface moisture transfer between the fabrics and a wet skin was also assessed and enabled to evaluate the level of the unpleasant contact feeling. Air permeability that is related to the thermal behavior was also investigated. The results obtained showed that at 22 % moisture content, which simulates a sweating sensation, the change in thermal properties is similar for both fabrics. Above the ‘sweating sensation’ moisture, significant differences on the thermal properties with the moisture content were registered between fabrics, Outlast® fabric being more prone to thermal properties changes due to moisture uptake than the Coolmax® one. When worn in conditions of wet skin, the unpleasant cool feeling increased for both fabrics, but the effect is more pronounced for Outlast® fabric.

40|$|In December 2003, the European Commission’s Joint Research Centre (JRC) was {{entrusted}} by DG Enterprise {{to verify}} the validity and applicability of the testing methods, proposed by DuPont, for the identification, characterisation and quantification of their new fibre (elastomultiester). This is an elastic bicomponent fibre made {{by a combination of}} two different polyesters (side-by-side structure). The elastic properties are due to crimps that are formed, after heat treatment, and due to the different shrinkage of the two components. The crimp is not mechanically induced and the yarn can be used directly, as no texturing or covering before weaving is needed. Experimental results confirmed that microscopy and differential scanning calorimetry (DSC) can identify both the multicomponent nature of the new fibre and its chemical composition, whereas Fourier Transform Infrared Spectroscopy (FT-IR) can confirm only its chemical composition. The normal pre-treatment, described in Directive 96 / 73 /EC, was proved to be applicable to the new bicomponent fibre and the agreed allowance value of 1. 50 % was adopted for the new fibre, in agreement with the European Network of National Experts on Textile Labelling (ENNETL). The solubility properties of elastomultiester were evaluated. In particular, the chemical methods 1, 2, 4, 6 – 9, 13 and 14 of Directive 96 / 73 /EC were tested and considered suitable for the quantification of elastomultiester in binary mixtures with other fibres. With the exception of method 14, the novel fibre was insoluble in all the mentioned methods and showed correction factors d equal to the ones of polyester (1. 00 for methods 1, 2, 4, 7, 9, 13 and 1. 01 for methods 6 and 8, respectively). In addition, also the manual separation method described in Directive 96 / 73 /EC was proved to be suitable for the quantification of elastomultiester in binary mixtures with other fibres. A new quantitative method based on DSC was developed and successfully applied to the quantification of binary mixtures of elastomultiester with polyester and cotton and to ternary mixtures with polyester/cotton, polyester/viscose and modal/viscose. The method is also applicable to mixtures of elastomultiester with nylon. It led to a good repeatability and results were generally as good as the ones obtained with chemical methods. The comparison with quantification based on the manual separation method showed differences usually lower than 1 %. The method shows two important advantages, the first being the rapidity of the analysis and the second being the possibility to avoid manual separation in the quantification of mixtures polyester/elastomultiester. The JRC developed a test method to measure the recoverable stretch and the permanent deformation of yarns and single filaments based on elongation. Experiments performed on single filaments of elastomultiester showed that, at 50 % elongation, the novel fibre is intrinsically elastic and proved that the elasticity is not due to the construction of yarns and {{to the fact that they}} contain several single filaments; on the contrary single filaments are as <b>elastic</b> as <b>yarns.</b> In fact, in these conditions the per cent permanent deformations were usually lower than or equal to 10 %. Based on experimental results, discussions during the 2 nd, 3 rd, and 4 th ENNETL meetings, the name and definition agreed and proposed for the new fibre were “elastomultiester: fibre formed by interaction of two or more chemically distinct linear macromolecules in two or more distinct phases (of which none exceeds 85 % by mass) which contains ester groups as dominant functional unit (at least 85 %) and which, after suitable treatment, when stretched to one and half times its original length and released, recovers rapidly and substantially to its original length”.
