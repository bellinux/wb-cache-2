40|$|Background: Incontinence is {{a common}} and {{embarrassing}} problem which has {{a profound effect on}} social and psychological well-being. Many people wear absorbent products to contain urine leakage and protect their clothes. It can be difficult to define light urinary incontinence because urine volumes, flow and frequency rates may vary substantially whilst still being considered 'light'. Light incontinence may encompass occasional (monthly) leaks of very small amounts (e. g. 1 g to 2 g) up to frequent leaks (several times per day) of larger amounts (e. g. 20 g to 50 g). A practical definition is urine loss that can be contained within a small absorbent pad (typically 50 g to 500 g; ISO 1996). Objectives: To assess the effectiveness of different types of absorbent product designs for women with light urinary incontinence. Search strategy: We searched the Cochrane Incontinence Group Specialised Trials Register (3 May 2006) and the reference lists of relevant articles were perused. Selection criteria Types of studies: All randomised or quasi-randomised trials of absorbent products for women with light urinary incontinence. Types of participants: Women with light urinary incontinence. Types of intervention: Absorbent products (<b>disposable</b> <b>insert</b> pads, menstrual pads, washable pants with integral pad, washable insert pads) suitable for light incontinence. Data collection and analysis: Two review authors assessed the methodological quality of potentially eligible studies and independently extracted data from the included trial. Main results: One study with 85 participants met the selection criteria. This trial studied all the absorbent product designs included in this review. Data were presented on all included outcomes. For preventing leakage, for preference and for overall acceptability <b>disposable</b> <b>insert</b> pads are better than disposable menstrual pads which are better than washable pants with integral pad which are better than washable insert pads. There is no strong evidence that either disposables or washables are better for skin health. The <b>disposable</b> <b>insert</b> is the most expensive design and there is no dominant design for cost-effectiveness. There is evidence that some women will prefer alternative designs which are all cheaper than disposable inserts. Authors' conclusions: Although data were available from only one eligible trial the data were sufficiently robust to make recommendations for practice. <b>Disposable</b> <b>insert</b> pads are typically more effective than the other designs considered. However, because they are the most expensive, providing choice of designs (or combinations of designs for different circumstances) is likely to be cost-effective...|$|E

40|$|Objectives: {{to compare}} the {{performance}} and cost-effectiveness of the key absorbent product designs {{to provide a more}} solid basis for guiding selection and purchase. Also to carry out the first stage {{in the development of a}} quality of life (QoL) instrument for measuring the impact of absorbent product use on users' lives. Design: three clinical trials focused on the three biggest market sectors. Each trial had a similar crossover design in which each participant tested all products within their group in random order. Setting, participants and intervention: in Trial 1, 85 women with light urinary incontinence living in the community tested three products from each of the four design categories available (total of 12 test products) : <b>disposable</b> <b>inserts</b> (pads); menstrual pads; washable pants with integral pad; and washable inserts. In Trial 2 a, 85 moderate/heavily incontinent adults (urinary or urinary/faecal) living in the community (49 men and 36 women) tested three (or two) products from each of the five design categories available (total of 14 test products) : <b>disposable</b> <b>inserts</b> (with mesh pants); disposable diapers (nappies); disposable pull-ups (similar to toddlers' trainer pants); disposable T-shaped diapers (nappies with waist-band); and washable diapers. All products were provided in a daytime and a (mostly more absorbent) night-time variant. In these first two trials, the test products were selected on the basis of data from pilot studies. In Trial 2 b, 100 moderate/heavily incontinent adults (urinary or urinary/faecal) living in 10 nursing homes (27 men and 73 women) evaluated one product from each of the four disposable design categories from Trial 2 a. Products were selected on the basis of product performance in Trial 2 a and, again, day time and night-time variants were provided. The first phase of developing a QoL tool for measuring the impact of using different pad designs was carried out by interviewing participants from Trials 1 and 2 a. Main outcome measures: product performance (e. g. comfort, discreetness) was characterised using a weekly validated questionnaire. A daily pad change and leakage diary was used to record severity of leakage, numbers of laundry items and pads. Skin health changes were recorded weekly. At a final interview preferences were ranked, acceptability of each design recorded, and overall opinion marked on a visual analogue scale (VAS) of 0 - 100 points. This VAS score was used to estimate cost-effectiveness. In addition, a timed pad changing exercise was conducted with 10 women from Trial 2 b to determine any differences between product designs. Results: <b>disposable</b> <b>inserts</b> are currently the mainstay of management for lightly incontinent women (Trial 1) and they were better for leakage and other variables (but not discreetness) and better overall than the other three designs. However, some women preferred menstrual pads (6 / 85) or washable pants (13 / 85), both of which are cheaper to use. Washable inserts were worse both overall and for leakage than the other three designs (72 / 85 found them unacceptable). For <b>disposable</b> <b>inserts</b> and <b>disposable</b> diapers, findings from the community (Trial 2 a) and nursing home trials (Trial 2 b) were broadly similar. Leakage performance of <b>disposable</b> <b>inserts</b> was worse than that of the other designs for day and night. Pull-ups were preferred over inserts for the daytime. The new T-shaped diaper was not better overall than the traditional disposable one. However, there were important differences in performance and preference findings for men and women from both trials. Pull-ups (the most expensive) were better overall than the other designs for women during the day and for community-dwelling women during the night. Although disposable diapers were better for leakage than <b>disposable</b> <b>inserts</b> (the cheapest), women did not prefer them (except in nursing homes at night), but for men the diapers were better both overall and for leakage and were the most cost-effective design. No firm conclusions could be drawn about the performance of designs for faecal incontinence. Nursing home carers found pull-ups and inserts easier to apply (in the standing position) and quicker (in the pad change experiment) than the diaper designs; the ability to stand was associated with preference for pull-ups or inserts. The T-shaped diaper was not easier or quicker to change than the diaper. The washable products (Trial 2 a) gave diverse results: they were better for leakage at night, but were worse overall for daytime than the other designs. Three-quarters of the women (27 / 36) found them unacceptable, but nearly two-thirds of men (31 / 49) found them highly acceptable at night. Findings from the two community trials (Trials 1 and 2 a) showed that there were many practical problems in dealing with washable products but, together with the less effective and less expensive products, such as menstrual pads, they were more acceptable at home (and, in the case of washables, at night). This suggests that cost-effective management may involve combining products by using more effective (for a given user) but more expensive designs (e. g. pull-ups) when out and less effective but less expensive designs when at home. The interviews examining the impact of pad use on QoL provided themes and domains that can be further developed into a tool for further evaluation of absorbent products. Conclusions: this study showed that there were significant and substantial differences between the designs of absorbent products and for moderate/heavy incontinence some designs are better for men/women than others. There was considerable individual variability in preferences and cost-effective management may best be achieved by allowing users to choose combinations of designs for different circumstances within a budget. Further research is needed into the feasibility of providing choice and combinations of designs to users, as well as into the development of more effective washables and of specifically male disposable products. QoL measurement tools are needed for users of absorbent products, as are clinical trials of designs for community-dwelling carer-dependent men and women with moderate/heavy incontinence <br/...|$|R

40|$|International audienceHigh-resolution magic-angle {{spinning}} (HR-MAS) nuclear {{magnetic resonance}} (NMR) is an essential tool to characterize a variety of semisolid systems, including biological tissues, with virtually no sample preparation. The "non-destructive" nature of NMR is typically compromised, however, by the extreme centrifugal forces experienced under conventional HR-MAS frequencies of several kilohertz. These features limit the usefulness of current HR-MAS approaches for fragile samples. Here, we introduce a full protocol for acquiring high-quality HR-MAS NMR spectra of biological tissues at low spinning rates (down to a few hundred hertz). The protocol first consists of a carefully designed sample preparation, which yields spectra without significant spinning sidebands at low spinning frequency for several types of sample holders, including the standard <b>disposable</b> <b>inserts</b> classically used in HR-MAS NMR-based metabolomics. Suppression of broad spectral features is then achieved using {{a modified version of}} the recently introduced PROJECT experiment with added water suppression and rotor synchronization, which deposits limited power in the sample and which can be suitably rotor-synchronized at low spinning rates. The performance of the slow HR-MAS NMR procedure is demonstrated on conventional (liver tissue) and very delicate (fish eggs) samples, for which the slow-spinning conditions are shown to preserve the structural integrity and to minimize intercompartmental leaks of metabolites. Taken together, these results expand the applicability and reliability of HR-MAS NMR spectroscopy. These results have been obtained at 400 and 600 MHz and suggest that high-quality slow HR-MAS spectra can be expected at higher magnetic fields using the described protocol...|$|R

40|$|This {{research}} article discusses the modelling and simulation results of carbon and eco-footprints of adult incontinence products. Four types of products are considered in this study: {{two types of}} diapers-commercial and new diapers and two types of pants-commercial and new type of pants. New types of diapers and pants were developed by our research team in the Institute of Textiles & Clothing of The Hong Kong Polytechnic University. Carbon and eco-footprints were modeled by using IPCC 2001 method (100 Years) and ecological footprint method (taken from Ecoinvent 2. 0) of SIMAPRO 7. 3. 2 version of LCA software. Datasets from Ecoinvent database inbuilt with SIMAPRO software were used to build the life cycle scenarios. Life cycle scenarios of four types of incontinence products were built for the entire life cycle of products from cradle to grave stages. In this research study, the contribution analysis (hot-spots in the life cycle stages) of carbon and eco-footprints of each type of product under consideration are highlighted. From the modeling and simulation results, it was noticed that the new reusable pants created the lowest carbon and eco-footprints compared to its counterparts. New type of diaper created slightly higher carbon and eco-footprints compared to the commercial diaper type. From the process contribution analysis, {{it was found that}} the production and disposal of SAP, generation of electricity for polypropylene, production processes of cotton were the contributors of major impacts in the order of hierarchy. From this detailed LCA study, it was understood that if the new type of reusable pants will be used without <b>disposable</b> <b>inserts,</b> it can bring carbon and eco-footprints significantly down.

Outcome measures: Product performance was characterised using validated questionnaires, which asked the participants (in Trials 1 and 2 a) or carers (all participants in Trial 2 b, except for the few who could report for themselves) to evaluate various aspects of pad performance (leakage, ease of putting on, discreetness, etc.) using a five-point scale (very good–very poor) at the end of the week (or 2 weeks for Trial 2 b) of product testing. In addition, participants/carers were asked to save individual used pads in bags for weighing and to indicate the severity of any leakage from them on a three-point scale (none, a little, a lot). These data were used to determine differences in leakage performance. Numbers of laundry items and pads used were recorded to estimate costs, and skin health changes were recorded by the participant or by the researchers (Trial 2 b). At the end of testing, participants were interviewed and ranked their preferences (with and without costs), stated the acceptability of each design (highly acceptable–totally unacceptable) and recorded their overall opinion on a visual analogue scale (VAS) of 0 – 100 points (worst design–best design).

40|$|Background: ncontinence is {{a common}} and {{embarrassing}} problem which has {{a profound effect on}} social and psychological well-being. Many people wear absorbent products to contain urine and/or faeces and protect their clothes and dignity. Users of absorbent pads are very diverse, including younger women, particularly those who have had children, older men with prostate disease, people with neurological conditions and older people with mobility and mental impairment. Whilst small absorbent pads for light incontinence are adequate for some users with low volumes of urine loss, for others with higher volumes more absorbent products are needed. A practical definition of moderate-heavy incontinence is urine or faecal loss that requires a large absorbent pad (typically with a total absorbent capacity of 2000 g to 3000 g) for containment. Objectives: to assess the effectiveness of the different types of absorbent product designed for moderate-heavy incontinence. Search strategy: we searched the Cochrane Incontinence Group Specialised Register for trials carried out between 1 January 1998 and 1 January 2008 (searched 7 February 2008), and the reference lists of relevant articles. Absorbent pads are subject to frequent modification by manufacturers and trials more than 10 years old were therefore not included in this review. Selection criteria: all randomised or quasi-randomised trials of absorbent products for moderate-heavy incontinence. Data collection and analysis: two review authors assessed the methodological quality of potentially eligible studies and independently extracted data from the included trials. Main results: two studies with a total of 185 participants met the selection criteria. These trials studied all the absorbent product designs included in this review. One trial took place in nursing homes, the other in people's own homes. Gender was found to be a significant variable in both trials, and accordingly the results were analysed in gender groups. Data were presented on all included outcomes, except for quality of life. The results show that there is no single best design (i. e. one design that is significantly better than all other designs and for all users). Of the disposable designs, the more expensive pull-up and T-shaped diaper designs were not better overall than the diaper for men, but the diaper was better than the insert (the cheapest), making the diaper the most cost-effective disposable design for men both day and night. For women, disposable pull-ups were better overall than the other designs (except for those living in nursing homes when disposable diapers are better when used at night), but they are expensive. Unlike men, women in the community did not favour diapers (or T-shape diapers) and insert pads are therefore the most cost-effective alternative. Washable diapers are the least expensive design but are unacceptable to most women at any time. However, some people (particularly men living at home) prefer them at night and for them they are a cost-effective design. No firm conclusions could be drawn about the performance of designs for faecal incontinence and there was no firm evidence that there are differences in skin health between designs. Authors' conclusions: although data were available from only two eligible trials the data were sufficiently robust to make some recommendations for practice.
