50|$|<b>Embedded</b> <b>{{computers}}</b> are {{computers that}} {{are a part of}} a machine or device. <b>Embedded</b> <b>computers</b> generally execute a program that is stored in non-volatile memory and is only intended to operate a specific machine or device. <b>Embedded</b> <b>computers</b> are very common. <b>Embedded</b> <b>computers</b> are typically required to operate continuously without being reset or rebooted, and once employed in their task the software usually cannot be modified. An automobile may contain a number of embedded computers; however, a washing machine and a DVD player would contain only one. The central processing units (CPUs) used in <b>embedded</b> <b>computers</b> are often sufficient only for the computational requirements of the specific application and may be slower and cheaper than CPUs found in a personal computer.|$|R

40|$|Lazy {{functional}} languages {{seem to be}} {{unsuitable for}} programming <b>embedded</b> <b>computers</b> because their implementations require so much memory for program code and graph. In this paper we describe a new abstract machine {{for the implementation of}} lazy functional languages on <b>embedded</b> <b>computers</b> called the X-machine. The X-machine has been designed so that program code can be stored compactly as byte code, yet run quickly using dynamic compilation. Our first results are promising [...] - programs typically require only 33 % of the code space of an ordinary implementation, but run at 75 % of the speed. Future work needs to concentrate on reducing the size of statically-allocated data and the run-time system, and on developing a more detailed understanding of throw-away compilation. 1 Introduction Today computers lurk everywhere, heavily disguised as digital diaries, mobile telephones, video cameras and countless other electronic devices.

50|$|Instead {{of using}} a single {{centralized}} point for collecting data from every sensor in a network, the ISHMP uses sensor platforms with <b>embedded</b> <b>computers,</b> such as Intel's Imote2. The Illinois Structural Health Monitoring Project has designed, developed, and tested various sensors that can stack onto these <b>embedded</b> <b>computers</b> and sense data such as vibrations, humidity levels, and wind speeds, to name a few. Using various power harvesting devices, {{there is no need}} for wiring the sensors to an electrical network. Initial tests for the sensor systems were run on a scale model of a truss bridge.|$|R

50|$|The {{project was}} {{initiated}} in 1981 by John L. Hennessy in response reports of similar projects at IBM (the 801) and the University of California, Berkeley (the RISC).

Hennessey founded MIPS Computer Systems {{in the same year}} to commercialize the technology developed by the project. In 1985, MIPS Computer Systems announced a new ISA, also called MIPS, and its first implementation, the R2000 microprocessor. The commercial MIPS ISA, and its implementations went on to be widely used, appearing in <b>embedded</b> <b>computers,</b> personal computers, workstations, servers, and supercomputers. As of May 2017, the commercial MIPS ISA is owned by Imagination Technologies, and is used mainly in <b>embedded</b> <b>computers.</b> In the late 1980s, a follow-up project called MIPS-X was conducted by Hennessy at Stanford.|$|R
40|$|Ada {{will most}} {{probably}} {{be used as}} the programming language for computers in the NASA Space Station. It is reasonable to suppose that Ada will be used for at least <b>embedded</b> <b>computers,</b> because the high software costs for these <b>embedded</b> <b>computers</b> were the reason why Ada activities were initiated about ten years ago. The on-board computers are designed for use in space applications, where maintenance by man is impossible. All manipulation of such computers has to be performed in an autonomous way or remote with commands from the ground. In a manned Space Station some maintenance work can be performed by service people on board, but {{there are still a lot}} of applications, which require autonomous computers, for example, vital Space Station functions and unmanned orbital transfer vehicles.
