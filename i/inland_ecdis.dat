50|$|Based on the {{findings}} of the European transport R&D project INDRIS (Inland Navigation Demonstrator for River Information Services) and the German project ARGO in 2001, both the Danube and the Rhine Commissions adopted an Inland Electronic Chart Display and Information Systems (<b>Inland</b> <b>ECDIS)</b> standard for IENC data and system requirements for the Rhine and the Danube Rivers. In 2001, the Economic Commission for Europe of the United Nations (UN ECE) adopted the <b>Inland</b> <b>ECDIS</b> Standard as a recommendation for the European inland waterway system.|$|E
50|$|Inland Electronic Navigational Charts (IENC) are {{electronic}} navigational charts for rivers, canals, {{lakes and}} other inland waters which are navigable. IENCs are displayed by an Inland Electronic Chart Display and Information System (<b>Inland</b> <b>ECDIS).</b>|$|E
50|$|As of November 2013, Inland ENC data {{conforming}} to the <b>Inland</b> <b>ECDIS</b> standard {{have been produced}} covering almost 10000 kilometers on European rivers/waterways including the: Rhine, Danube, Mosel, Neckar, Main, Scheldt, Garonne, Elbe, Sava and Drava Rivers and the Main-Danube Canal in Germany, the Netherlands, France, Belgium, Switzerland, Austria, Slovakia, Hungary, Croatia, Serbia, Bulgaria, Romania and the Ukraine.|$|E
40|$|Route {{monitoring}} {{is one of}} {{the most}} important functions in modern navigation systems. In case of marine merchant shipâ€™s it usually part of IMO-standardized solutions like ECDIS or INS. In inland waters <b>Inland</b> <b>ECDIS</b> is implemented. There is however large group of ships which do not have to follow standardized solution, like recreational ships. The skippers of these boats more and more often are using mobile devices. The paper presents considerations on implementation of voyage assistant module in mobile navigation system in inland waters. Main problems are defined solutions for them are proposed. In general proposed approach is based on mobile cartography like in car navigation and derives also from water navigation systems. The verification research are described and commented...|$|E
