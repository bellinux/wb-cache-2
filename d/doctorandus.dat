2500|$|Confusion can {{be caused}} by the {{original}} Dutch Master level title [...] "drs." [...] (for all non-engineering and non-law master's degrees). This abbreviation stands for the Dutch title <b>doctorandus</b> Latin for [...] "he who should become a doctor" [...] (female form is [...] "doctoranda"). Dutch drs. {{should not be confused with}} the plural 'doctorates': having a PhD in multiple disciplines. Once a doctorate is achieved the <b>doctorandus</b> is promoted to doctor, and no longer uses the drs. abbreviation.|$|E

The abbreviation Drs. can also refer to <b>doctorandus,</b> a Dutch academic title.|$|E
5000|$|In the Netherlands, the Bachelor of Arts and Master of Arts degrees were {{introduced}} in 2002. Until {{then there was a}} single program which led to the <b>doctorandus</b> degree. This comprised the same course load as the Bachelor and Master programs combined. (The title <b>doctorandus</b> was used in almost all fields of study; other titles were used for legal studies (meester) and engineering (ingenieur).) Those who had already started the <b>doctorandus</b> program could, on completing it, opt for the <b>doctorandus</b> degree (entitling them to use [...] "Drs." [...] in front of their name), or could use the master's degree (post-nominal letters) in accordance with the new standard.A similar practice has been introduced in other EU countries, according to the Bologna Process.|$|E

50|$|In Belgium's Flemish Community the <b>doctorandus</b> {{title was}} only used {{by those who}} {{actually}} started their doctoral work. <b>Doctorandus</b> is still used as a synonym for a Ph.D. student. The licentiaat (licensee) title was in use for a regular graduate until the Bologna reform changed the licentiaat degree to the master's degree (the Bologna reform abolished the two-year kandidaat degree and introduced a three-year academic bachelor's degree instead).|$|E

50|$|In the Netherlands, the Master of Arts and the Master of Science degrees were {{introduced}} in 2002. Until that time, a single program {{that led to the}} <b>doctorandus</b> degree (or the ingenieur degree in the case of technical subjects) was in effect, which comprised the same course load as the Bachelor and Master programs put together. Those who had already started the <b>doctorandus</b> program could, upon completing it, opt for the <b>doctorandus</b> degree (before their name, abbreviated to 'drs.'; in the case of ingenieur, this would be 'ir.'), or simply use the master's degree (behind their name) in accordance with the new standard (so, 'M.A.' or 'M.Sc.'). Because these graduates do not have a separate bachelor's degree (which is in fact - in retrospect - incorporated into the program), the master's degree is their first academic degree.|$|E

50|$|The {{traditional}} academic {{system of}} the Netherlands provided four basic academic diplomas and degrees: propaedeuse, kandidaat, <b>doctorandus</b> (drs.) (with equivalent degrees in engineering - ir. and law - mr.) and doctor (dr.). After successful completion {{of the first year}} of university, the student was awarded the propaedeutic diploma (not a degree). In some fields, this diploma was abolished in the 1980s: in physics and mathematics, the student could obtain directly a kandidaat (candidate) degree in two years. The candidate degree was all but abolished by 1989. It used to be attained after four or five years of academic study, after which the student was allowed to begin work on his <b>doctorandus</b> thesis. The successful completion of this thesis conveyed the <b>doctorandus</b> title, implying that the student's initial studies were finished. In addition to these 'general' degrees, specific titles were available for specific subjects, which are equivalent to the <b>doctorandus</b> degree: for law: meester (master) (mr.), and for engineering: ingenieur (engineer)(ir.). More recently the Dutch incorporated the Anglo-Saxon system of academic degrees into their own. The old candidate's degree was relabeled as the bachelor's degree and the doctorandus' by the master's degree. However, Dutch university programmes tend to include advanced subject matter that e.g., at Harvard is taught in Ph.D.-courses (for instance advanced quantum mechanics or general relativity in a Dutch course for the master's degree in theoretical physics).|$|E
50|$|Prior to the {{education}} reform, a single program leading to the <b>doctorandus,</b> ingenieur or meester degree was in effect, which comprised the same course load as the Bachelor and Master programs put together. Those who had already started the <b>doctorandus,</b> ingenieur or meester program could, upon completing it, opt for the old degree (before their name), or simply use the master's degree (behind their name) {{in accordance with the}} new standard.

5000|$|Those who {{received}} their master's degree from Dutch research universities after the Bologna process {{in other fields}} than agriculture, natural environment, technical field and law may also bear the title <b>doctorandus</b> and alternatively {{have the option of}} signing like A. Jansen, MA or A. Jansen, MSc, but only as specified on their diploma. In this case, either a MA or a MSc is granted, which entitles one to bear the title <b>doctorandus.</b> This means that people who have graduated soon after 1 September 2002 have no (separate) bachelor's degree, but only a master's degree, which is their first degree.|$|E

50|$|He studied {{economics}} and econometrics (1987-1992) and law (1990-1993) at the Vrije Universiteit in Amsterdam, {{which gave him}} the academic titles <b>doctorandus</b> or drs. (equivalent of Master of Science) and meester in de rechten or mr. (equivalent of Master of Laws).|$|E

Appelmans). Those who have multiple doctor titles may use dr.mult. before their name, although this is rarely used.|$|E

50|$|In the Netherlands, to be a {{licensed}} lawyer (Advocaat), one must complete an undergraduate law degree (Bacheloropleiding or LL.B, which is {{three years of}} study), the master of law degree (<b>doctorandus</b> in law before implementation of the Bologna Process and conferring the meester title, which is a one-year LL.M. program), and a three-year apprenticeship.|$|E
50|$|Similar to Germany. A {{graduate}} who is awarded the title Master of Science may still use the previously awarded Dutch title ingenieur (abbreviated as ir.) (for graduates who followed a technical or agricultural program), meester (abbreviated as mr.)

5000|$|According to Dutch legislation, the Dutch <b>doctorandus</b> {{degree is}} {{equivalent}} to the MA or MSc degree in English-speaking countries, with the difference that the coursework and comprehensive exams for a doctorate are included in the academic study.

A colloquial term for such degree would be all but dissertation.|$|E
5000|$|The {{abbreviation}} is drs. This {{means that}} Dutch graduates {{who received the}} <b>doctorandus</b> title may sign like drs. A. Jansen.

According to Art. 7.20 of the Dutch law on higher education and scientific research, a graduate of a master's degree granted through scientific education (i.e. by a Dutch research university) may sign as ir. for those who graduated a field of agriculture, natural environment or technical field, mr. for those who graduated in law and drs. by those who graduated in other fields. According to Art. 7.19a and the Dutch customs the degrees granted to such graduates are MSc for engineers, MA or MSc for doctoranduses and established by ministerial regulation for jurists (actually LLM).
