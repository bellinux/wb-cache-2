50|$|While not routine, <b>dealkalization</b> {{can also}} be {{measured}} {{in a variety of}} other ways. Since dealkalized surfaces are more chemically durable, they are also more resistant to weathering reactions, and appropriate evaluation of this parameter can give indirect evidence of a previously dealkalized surface. It is also possible to evaluate <b>dealkalization</b> through the use of advanced, surface analytical techniques such as SIMS or XPS, which give direct measurements of glass surface composition.|$|E

5000|$|... ===Testing for dealkalization=== Routine {{tests for}} surface <b>dealkalization</b> {{in the glass}} {{container}} industry all generally aim to evaluate the amount of alkali extracted from the glass when it is rinsed with or exposed to purified water. For example, <b>dealkalization</b> can be quickly checked by introducing a small volume of distilled water to a freshly made bottle and rolling the bottle gently to pass the water completely over its inside surface. The pH of the rinse water is then measured; untreated containers will tend to yield a slightly alkaline pH in the 8-9 range due to extracted alkali, while dealkalized containers tend to yield a pH that remains approximately neutral.|$|E
5000|$|Many {{commercial}} glass {{products such}} as containers are made of soda-lime glass, and therefore have a substantial percentage of sodium ions in their internal structure. Since sodium is an alkali element, its selective removal from the surface results in a dealkalized surface. A classic example of <b>dealkalization</b> is the treatment of glass containers, where a special process is {{used to create a}} dealkalized inside surface that is more resistant to interactions with liquid products put inside the container. However, the term <b>dealkalization</b> may also be generally applied to any process where a glass surface forms a thin surface layer that is depleted of alkali ions relative to the bulk. A common example is the initial stages of glass corrosion or weathering, where alkali ions are leached from the surface region by interactions with water, forming a dealkalized surface layer.|$|E
5000|$|<b>Dealkalization</b> (by Murat Agac) is {{a process}} of surface {{modification}} applicable to glasses containing alkali ions, wherein a thin surface layer is created that has a lower concentration of alkali ions than is present in the underlying, bulk glass. This change in surface composition commonly alters the observed properties of the surface, most notably enhancing corrosion resistance.|$|E
5000|$|For glass {{container}}s, {{the goal}} of surface <b>dealkalization</b> is to render the inside surface of the container more resistant to interactions with liquid products later put inside it. Since the treatment is directed primarily at changing {{the properties of the}} inside surface in contact with the product, it is also referred to as [...] "internal treatment." ...|$|E
5000|$|A dealkalized surface {{may have}} either no alkali {{remaining}} or may just {{have less than}} the bulk. In silicate glasses, dealkalized surfaces are also often considered “silica-rich” since the selective removal of alkali ions can be thought to leave behind a surface composed primarily of silica (SiO2). To be precise, <b>dealkalization</b> does not generally involve the outright removal of alkali from the glass, but rather its replacement with protons (H+) or hydronium ions (H3O+) in the structure {{through the process of}} ion-exchange.|$|E
5000|$|Historically, sulfur-containing {{compounds}} {{were the}} first materials used to dealkalize glass containers. <b>Dealkalization</b> proceeds through the interdiffusion/ion-exchange of Na+ out of the glass and H+/H3O+ into the glass, along with the subsequent reaction of the sulfate species with available sodium at the surface to form sodium sulfate (Na2SO4). The latter is left behind as water-soluble crystalline deposits, or bloom, on the glass surface that must be rinsed away prior to filling. On manufacturing lines, {{one way in which}} this process was done was by flooding the annealing lehr with sulfur dioxide (SO2) or sulfur trioxide (SO3) gases—especially in the presence of water, which enhances the reaction. However, this practice fell into disfavor due to environmental and health concerns regarding SOx-type gases. [...] An alternative method for sulfate treatment is with solid ammonium sulfate salt or aqueous solutions thereof. These materials are introduced inside the container after forming and decompose into gases in the annealing lehr, where the resulting sulfur-containing gas mixture carries out the <b>dealkalization</b> reaction. This method is purportedly safer than flooding the annealing lehr since the unreacted components in the gas mixture will tend not to escape to the atmosphere, but rather react with each other and recreate the original salt in the container that can later be rinsed away.|$|E

5000|$|A dealkalizer {{contains}} {{strong base}} {{anion exchange resin}} that exchanges chloride (the Cl ion of the NaCl) for carbonate, bicarbonate and sulfate. As water passes through the anion resin the carbonate, bicarbonate and sulfate ions are exchanged for chloride ions. [...] "Higher capacities can be realized by use of type II rather than type I strong base anion resins. Although bicarbonates are not held as tightly as chlorides on the SBA (strong base anion) resins in the hydroxide form, when the resin is predominantly in the chloride form the pH has been raised by a small addition of caustic to the brine regenerant, {{there will be a}} favorable exchange of bicarbonate for the chloride. This exchange works well only with high alkalinity waters (40% to 80%), with capacities of 4 to 10 Kg/CF being obtained. The advantages of SBA resin <b>dealkalization</b> is that low-cost salt is used in place of the acid necessary for the SAC (strong acid cation)and un-lined steel tanks can be used." ...|$|E

5000|$|The {{most common}} example of its use with {{containers}} is on bottles intended to hold alcoholic spirits. The {{reason for this}} is that some alcoholic spirits such as vodka and gin have an approximately neutral pH and a high alcohol content, but are not buffered in any way against changes in pH. If alkali is leached from the glass into the product, the pH will begin to rise (i.e. become more alkaline), can eventually reach a pH high enough that the solution begins to attack the glass itself quite effectively. [...] By this mechanism, initially neutral alcohol products can achieve a pH where the glass container itself begins to slowly dissolve, leaving thin, siliceous glass flakes or particles in the fluid. <b>Dealkalization</b> treatment hinders this process by removing alkali from the inside surface. Not only does this mean less extractable alkali in the glass surface directly contacting the product, but it also creates a barrier for the diffusion of alkali from the underlying bulk glass into the product.|$|E

40|$|Glass is {{generally}} considered to be a chemically stable material at the normal conditions. However, during dishwashing process the tableware glass surface is attacked by detergent water solution at elevated temperatures for different time. It results in different type of irreversible glass surface damage such as milky effect/white layer, iridescence and line corrosion. The goal {{of this study was to}} classify and identify different types of the glass surface damages after dishwashing process and find the mechanism of their creation. EDX indicated that the iridescence was characterized by a difference in composition due to the enrichment in Na and Al with S and depletion in Ca, Ba and K in comparison with surrounding glass. The white layer of corrosion products contained high and/or low amount of alkali/alkali earth elements, as originated from detergent washing solution. The following mechanism of glass corrosion was proposed (i) surface <b>dealkalization</b> and alkali leaching into water solution, (ii) glass network dissolution and (iii) precipitation reactions.

40|$|A {{description}} of mobile Ni contents in various subtypes of calcareous black soils {{from the area}} of the mountain massif of Rajac, is given in the present paper. A hundred soil samples were analysed in all, originating from four subtypes of calcareous black soil (organogenic, organo-mineral, brownized and loessivized black soils). The extraction of mobile Ni was carried out with 1. 0 N HCl and its content was determined by atomic absorption spectrophotometry. The obtained results indicate that mobile Ni content in the investigated soils varies within a wide range, from 5. 0 to 251. 3 mg/kg that it is very seldom (only in 3 % of the investigated samples) within the range from 5 to 7 mg/kg, that in over 90 % of the 100 investigated samples it is higher than 10 mg/kg, and in almost 3 / 5 of the samples it is higher than 20 mg/kg. Calcareous black soils of Rajac massif have much higher mobile Ni content than previously investigated black soils from calcareous massif of Rtanj, which is, by all means, only partly due to their more severe <b>dealkalization</b> and acidification.

40|$|The article {{presents}} the results of a research into various hydromechanical processes such as hindered falling of an individual ball in a liquid; suspension of a homogeneous monodispersed granular layer with ascending fluid flow; homogeneous liquid filtration in a porous granular layer. The authors generalize the results of theoretical and experimental studies, employ the theory of similarity, and establish that the laws of hydraulic friction for the mentioned hydromechanical processes share the common ground described by one general equation that provides basis for obtaining the individual formulae computing the studied hydromechanical processes. The formulae appear in dimensionless similitude parameters that reflect correlation of the essential action forces. The presented scientific results contribute to the theory development of the applied hydromechanical phenomena and the new obtained formulae enable enhancement of the calculation procedures for structures and installations that realize the studied hydraumechanical processes. Thus, the research results for the hindered falling of an individual ball in a liquid can apply in viscosimetry techniques and in handling the problems related to calculations of various movement types and separate units in technologies realizing the hydraulic processes of hindered falling of individual balls in liquids. Fluidization processes (pseudo-liquefaction) of the granular layers enjoy wide application in various segments of industry for instance in chemical engineering at adsorption, desorption, dissolution, <b>dealkalization,</b> ablution. A new general calculating formula incipiency provides a possibility for technological computations realization under any operational mode.

40|$|The {{objectives}} {{of this report}} are: (1) To investigate the development of Raman spectroscopy for remote, in-situ, real-time measurement of the processes underlying chemical corrosion of glasses, (2) To conduct Raman spectroscopy measurements and quantum mechanical modelling studies of the transition states, corrosion products, and transition state energies for the hydrate species of higher valence and multivalent ions formed in the reconstructed glass surface. (3) To use these results to model long-term corrosion behavior of complex borosilicate wasteform glasses. (4) To apply the Raman spectroscopy and modelling methods developed here for the remote analysis of leaching processes in waste glasses containing radioactive components, and for imaging of variations in leaching behavior due to composition inhomogeneities in large scale waste glass products. Results of First Year Research During the first year, the authors primarily addressed Objective (1) which {{is to develop a}} methodology for the remote monitoring of leaching processes in glasses by Raman spectroscopy. The authors assembled a micro and macro Raman system for examining surface structure in glass samples, in-situ within the leaching vessel. The Raman spectrometer was prepared for imaging by installing a CCD detector which gives 2 -dimensional information. The latter can be used to obtain spectrographic data in one dimension and to scan variations in materials behavior across the other dimension. By scanning the sample in a perpendicular direction, it is possible to conduct 2 -dimensional spectral analysis of the sample surface. The plan is to select one or several identifying Raman lines that follow the leaching process After that, {{it will be possible to}} introduce a slit configuration and use both dimensions of the CCD detector for scanning the sample surface while examining only the selected spectral feature. Glass samples consisting of alkali silicates were first examined. The samples were melted in a conventional electric furnace in 100 gr batches and poured into brass molds. The samples were cut and polished under water-free conditions and then immersed under water in petri dishes. By leaving the upper surface uncovered, the authors focused the objective lens of a microscope on the submerged glass surface. Light from an Argon laser operating at 514. 5 nm with approximately 100 mW of power was directed to the glass surface at a large angle of incidence (55). Raman spectra were collected in a 0. 6 m spectrometer with a 1, 200 line/mm grating using a supernotch filter to block the laser line. Typical data are shown in the attached figure. Samples of the following compositions were tested: 20 % Na,O [...] 80 % SiO, and 30 % L and O [...] 70 % SiO,. The attached figure reports the results from the Li,O-SiO, glass. The results show a significant difference between the unleached and water-exposed samples. This is evident in the relative amplitudes of the Raman peaks at 436 cm{sup - 2 } and 582 cm{sup - 2 }. These 2 peaks are associated with vibrations of the alkali coordinated non- bridging oxygen. In fact, the ratio of the 582 to the 436 peaks gives a measure of the alkali content of the material. By examining the sample surface only, and conducting the tests while the sample is submerged, the authors observed a decrease in the 582 cm{sup - 1 } peak and an increase in the 436 cm{sup - 1 } peak with increased exposure of the sample to the aqueous environment. This is shown in the attached figure and is clear indication of the progressive <b>dealkalization</b> of the glass surface by water. The peaks can be fitted to Gaussian shapes and the integrated intensity will yield a direct measure of the alkali content of the glass surface. In addition, the angle of incidence of the laser beam can be adjusted to provide more penetration into the sample and yield composition profiles. ...|$|E
