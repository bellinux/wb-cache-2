This neutrality is actually what makes Palomino an ideal grape because it is easily enhanced by the sherry winemaking style.|$|R
40|$|The grape {{was one of}} {{the first}} fruits to be {{cultivated}} by man. Since the dawn of civilisation, the fermented product of grapes, wine, has probably been an important way of consuming grapes (McGovern et al. 1995). Wine residues have been identified in 7000 -year-old jars in Iran (McGovern et al. 1996). However, consumption of the fresh and dried fruit has probably always been popular where the vines grew wild. This chapter provides some basic information about the cultivation of grapes (this section) before looking at the physiology and biochemistry of the developing and mature grape berry. The final three sections of the chapter deal with post-harvest aspects of grapes pertaining to the three main product types: beverages (wine and juice), fresh fruit (table grapes) and dried fruit (sultanas, raisins and currants). Although today most grapes are converted to wine, the development of the post-harvest technology <b>for</b> <b>grapes</b> has concentrated on the fresh fruit. This is because all the eating-quality parameters (appearance, texture and taste) must be high in the commercial product. The quality of <b>grapes</b> <b>for</b> wine, <b>drying</b> or <b>for</b> other <b>grape</b> products is primarily dependent on harvesting the right varieties at the right time and preventing unwanted chemical changes during processing. The topic of wine production is so huge that this chapter describes only the quality factors required in the harvested grape as the basis of a good wine. Details of processing are omitted but references are given for further reading on this topic. There is relatively little published on the specific post-harvest requirements <b>for</b> <b>grapes</b> used <b>for</b> <b>drying.</b> In the section entitled ‘Post-harvest technology <b>for</b> <b>dried</b> grapes’, a summary of the basic processing and product preservation is provided...|$|R

40|$|Abstract: In this paper, Considered <b>grapes</b> type <b>for</b> <b>drying</b> was Thompson {{seedless}} grapes using laboratory flatbed dryer. Effect of environmental factors (like humidity and temperature), Infrared energy exposer and pretreatment on grapes at constant air velocity were studied. Ethyl oleate (2 %), Potassium Carbonate (2. 5 %) and water (95. 5 %) were considered <b>for</b> pretreatment of <b>grapes</b> to get non-sticky and soft texture. A Standard cold dip emulsion pretreatment was used. Pretreatment increases drying rate because of cracks developed on pretreated grape’s surface. Constant, controlled and concentrated Infrared energy gives great appearance {{as well as}} taste within 9 hours to 12 hours. Drying rate was predicted by calculation and observed practically at 20 cm distances between Infrared energy source and grapes in flatbed dryer. <b>For</b> calculation of <b>Drying</b> rate, here considered only its water content and no other factors which are include in biomass structure of grape is consider. Energy intensity modeled using Özi�ik(1977) equation and polynomial expressions of Leckner (1972) to obtain the vapor emissivity. This work was done {{under the guidance of}} Dr. V. N.

The main <b>grape</b> varieties <b>for</b> the <b>dry</b> wine are Courbu and Petit Manseng, which together must make up at least 60%, and neither of which may exceed 80%. Accessory grape varieties (up to 40%) are Arrufiac, Gros Manseng and Sauvignon blanc, with Sauvignon blanc being limited {{to a maximum of}} 10%. The proportions of grape varieties allowed have been modified in recent years, with the most recent changes being implented in 2005. Previously, a certain proportion of Arrufiac was prescribed, and Sémillon was allowed.|$|R
50|$|A Danish winery, Vester Ulslev Vingaard, {{has made}} wine from dried grapes since 2007. The {{varieties}} used are Léon Millot and Cabernet Cantor. The <b>grapes</b> are <b>dried</b> <b>for</b> 4 - 5 weeks using forced ventilation. During {{that time the}} grapes lose up to 50% of their weight, the remaining juice being similarly more concentrated. The wines produced are red, dry wines {{with a level of}} alcohol of more than 15%.Vester Ulslev Vingaard sees the use of dried grapes as a means to make more powerful wines in a cool climate and also as a means to redress deficits in concentration and sugars in bad seasons. In 2010 a double-fermented (ripasso-method) wine was also produced using the pomace of the first wine.|$|R

40|$|Grape seed, {{which is}} an organic waste arise from {{production}} of wine, juice and molasses, is considered as a functional food ingredient in food formulations because of its rich content of bioactive compounds. This study was performed in order to evaluate the effect of air-drying temperature on the bioactive compounds of grape seeds. In the study, total phenolic content and antioxidant activity of grape seeds that are dehydrated at different drying temperatures (40, 50 and 60 °C) were determined. When comparing the fresh grape seeds with the corresponding dehydrated samples, it was shown that the drying operation led to reduction of total phenolic contents and the total phenolic contents decreased with an increase of the drying temperature. According to ABTS radical scavenging method, Trolox Equivalent Antioxidant Capacity (TEAC) {{was found to be}} highest <b>for</b> fresh <b>grape</b> seeds and presented lower values <b>for</b> <b>grape</b> seeds <b>dried</b> at three different temperatures. As a result of the study, it was demonstrated that grape seed is a powerful antioxidant source and it has still high antioxidant activity after drying process.

40|$|Abstract- This thesis {{attempts}} to present numerical simulation of solar collector developed exclusively <b>for</b> <b>grape</b> <b>drying.</b> Solar {{drying of grapes}} is much feasible technically and economically. There has been a remarkable achievement in solar drying of grapes due to sustained research and development associated with the adoption of advanced technologies. Simulation is an important tool for design and operation control. For the designer of a drying system, simulation {{makes it possible to}} find the optimum design and operating parameters. For the designer of the control system, simulation provides a means to device control strategies and to analyze the effects of disturbances. In the present thesis the computational fluid dynamics (CFD) tool has been used to simulate the solar collector for better understanding the heat transfer capability. 3 D model of the collector involving air inlet, wavy structured absorber plate,glass cover plate, and pebble block is modeled by ANSYS Workbench and the unstructured grid was created in ANSYS ICEM. The results were obtained by using ANSYS FLUENT software. The objective of this work is to compare theoretically and experimentally work done with the work done by using computational fluid dynamics (CFD) tool with respect to flow and temperature distribution inside the solar collector.
