It is made of evolved basalts (mainly trachybasalts), polimictic welded tuff and trachyandesytetrachysyenite annular dikes.

40|$|Microstructure and {{corrosion}} behaviour {{of plain}} carbon steel–B 4 C composite produced by GTAW method in 3 ? 5 wt-%NaCl solution S. H. Ettefagh Far* 1 and A. Davoodi 2 In this work, the corrosion behaviour of {{metal matrix composite}} plain carbon steel–B 4 C was studied in 3 ? 5 wt-%NaCl solution. The composite was locally produced as <b>weld</b> <b>band</b> on plain carbon steel by means of {{gas tungsten arc welding}} process and using nickel as wetting agent. Samples from <b>weld</b> <b>band,</b> <b>heat</b> affected zone and base regions were extracted precisely, and electrochemical techniques including open circuit potential, linear polarisation resistance, electrochemical impedance spectroscopy, potentiodynamic polarisation in combination with SEM-EDX surface analysis and microhardness were used for characterisation. The results showed that hardness value of made composite increased significantly to 642 HV 10. However, the corrosion resistance of composite region during 7 days (168 h) of exposure to 3 ? 5 wt-%NaCl solution was slightly reduced. This was attributed to the fact that B 4 C particles play as cathode site for oxygen reduction; therefore, they increase the corrosion rate slightly...|$|R
50|$|Jimbo Wallace is {{an upright}} and {{electric}} bass player, vocalist, and songwriter in the psychobilly and rockabilly genres. He has played bass in the Reverend Horton <b>Heat</b> <b>band</b> since 1989. He is the most-tattooed {{member of the}} band.He plays using the percussive rockabilly/psychobilly bass technique known as slap bass, in which the strings are {{pulled away from the}} fingerboard until they snap back, and the strings are rhythmically slapped against the fingerboard. This live solo performance demonstrates his rapid, virtuostic slapping technique. The German rockabilly bassist Didi Beck cites Wallace as one of his influences.|$|R

60|$|The {{charge that}} Sir James Lee {{had given to}} Myles to strike at his adversary's helm {{was a piece of}} advice he {{probably}} would not have given to so young a knight, excepting as a last resort. A blow perfectly delivered upon the helm was of all others the most difficult for the recipient to recover from, but then a blow upon the helm was not one time in fifty perfectly given. The huge cylindrical tilting helm was so constructed in front as to slope at an angle in all directions to one point. That point was the centre of a cross formed by two iron <b>bands</b> <b>welded</b> to the steel-face plates of the helm where it was weakened by the opening slit of the occularium, or peephole. In the very centre of this cross was a little flattened surface where the bands were riveted together, and it was upon that minute point that the blow must be given to be perfect, and that stroke Myles determined to attempt.|$|R

40|$|Abstract. The {{effect of}} drawing speed and heating length on {{deformation}} behavior was investigated by numerical approach for AZ 31 magnesium alloy tubes to realize high speed dieless drawing process. The length of deformation zone expands with increasing the feeding speed. The increase in heating length leads to expanding length of deformation zone. The mean strain rate increases with increasing the feeding speed firstly, and then {{rate of increase}} in the strain rate becomes gradual under condition of any length of <b>heating</b> <b>band.</b> Based on these results, a limiting reduction in area of 52. 5 % under higher speed and larger heating length conditions can be realized experimentally...|$|R
40|$|The thermoacoustic {{flashover}} detector {{is to be}} a helmet-mounted {{device that}} responds to deteriorating conditions in a compartment fire and produces an audible alarm to alert emergency personnel in time for an escape or change in tactics. An operational prototype device was designed at University of Maryland in 2011, and featured an aluminum, copper, and MACOR tube 178 mm long and 25. 4 mm in diameter. The prototype was powered by an external <b>heat</b> <b>band,</b> which provided 44 watts of power at 308 deg C. Optimization of the prototype is conducted across several parameters including power consumption and temperature gradient. To that end, two scaled-down models of diameters 22 mm and 17 mm are constructed, both of which fail to produce sustained sound. Adding water to the device reduces the onset power consumption to 22 watts and the maximum temperature to 285 deg C, which represents the most efficient prototype of the device. A system of radiant heat collector panels and copper-water heat pipes is designed to replace the external <b>heat</b> <b>band</b> as a power source. A heat transfer analysis is conducted to determine the necessary size of the collector panels for proper activation, as well as the response time of the system. Total required surface area will depend on future design parameters, but reasonable estimates suggest that it will be between 0. 02 - 0. 03 sq meters. An acoustic analysis of the optimized device is conducted, revealing a fundamental frequency of 500 Hz at 101 dB...|$|R
50|$|After {{promoting}} the self-titled album, longtime drummer Rob Kurth left the band in early 1998. To finish out the touring cycle for the self-titled album, the band replaced Kurth with Jose Medeles, {{who was out}} with them on a co-headlining US tour with the Reverend Horton <b>Heat</b> <b>band,</b> before taking a break to write and record their next album. After 25 different drummers were auditioned to replace Kurth, the band finally found Pete Parada. After the release of two more albums, Ignorance is Bliss (1999) and Reactionary (2000), Yaro departed from Face to Face in 2001. Instead of hiring a replacement for him, the band decided to continue as a three piece.|$|R

40|$|The heat pipe, {{a sealed}} chamber whose walls {{are lined with}} a "wick," a thin {{capillary}} network containing a working fluid in liquid form was developed for a heat distribution system for non-rotating satellites. Use of the heat pipe provides a continuous heat transfer mechanism. "Heat tubes" that improve temperature control in plastics manufacturing equipment incorporated the heat pipe technology. James M. Stewart, an independent consultant, patented the heat tubes he developed and granted a license to Kona Corporation. The Kona Nozzle for heaterless injection molding gets heat for its operation from an external source and has no internal <b>heating</b> <b>bands,</b> reducing machine maintenance and also eliminating electrical hazards associated with heater bands.

5000|$|Heat {{transfer}} in the HGB mainly occurs in [...] "heat bands", 30 to 50 km wide, within {{which there are}} at least 600 associated geothermal systems. These may be interpreted as segments of slip lines caused by deformation of the ductile crust in the Asian tectonic plate.In the eastern Himalayas the <b>heat</b> <b>bands</b> transfer two to three times as much heat as in the western Himalayas. This {{may be due to the}} Indian plate rotating in a counter-clockwise direction as it penetrates the Asian plate.The thermal waters in Tibet were thought to be meteoric in origin, and the heat source to be decaying radioactive nuclides. Due to studies in the 1990s and deep drilling results it is now thought that the heat source is granite that has remelted to magma due to the collision of the plates.|$|R
