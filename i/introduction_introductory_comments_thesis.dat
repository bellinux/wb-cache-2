40|$|This Research and Development paper {{contains}} {{a summary of}} the first regional conference by the Institute of Terrestrial Ecology (ITE) on the subject of Ecology in the 1980 s. It was concerned with northern England, with particular reference to the uplands, and was designed to develop a dialogue between research ecologists and the users of ecological information. The conference was held at the Cumbria Grand Hotel, Grange-over-Sands, Cumbria, on 13 and 14 April 1981. The conference was opened by Mr J N R Jeffers (Director, ITE) and Mr J C Dunning (Countryside Comissioner and Farmer). The number of major subject areas were identified and each was introduced by two speakers, one speaker representing the user interests and identified some of the problems which he considered relevant to ecology; the second speaker identified the contribution which can be made by ecological research. These <b>introductory</b> <b>comments</b> were followed by open discussion. The <b>introductory</b> <b>comments</b> and {{a summary of the}} discussions constitute the central part of this R & D paper. Mr Jeffers concluded the conference with a summary of ITE's approach to ecological research and Mr Dunning emphasised the importance of integrating our land use policies. ITE {{would like to thank the}} many people who participated so actively in the discussions and the staff who worked so efficiently to ensure the smooth running of the conference. ...|$|R

Thereby, user can see potential details of the image that were lost (clipped at bright intensities). There is no unique definition for the computation of a PW measurement. However, its result in terms of control should be that the overall intensity level is lowered globally, for the sake of visualization of important bright details. Let us first give some <b>introductory</b> <b>comments</b> about the use of PW measurement, after which we briefly discuss several definitions.|$|R
30|$|By {{retracing}} {{the proof}} of Theorem  3.1 we observe that, behind other technical reasons, the final expression of the solution σ derived in (18) is deeply tied to the requirement of the a.e. positivity definiteness of such a tensor; conversely, as announced in the <b>introductory</b> <b>comments</b> of Section  1, if this restriction is omitted, then for the same function z(x,y)=c_ 1 x^ 2 -c_ 2 y^ 2 n, the unique solution in Ω̄ exhibits a more general representation, precisely given by (16) and (17). Subsequently, we have this further result, which we state without further comments.|$|R

The main body of the essay analyses paradox in La moglie di Gogol (1954), Quattro chiacchiere in famiglia (1966), Un concetto astruso (1966), Parole in agitazione (1968), and Il bacio (1968). Some of these stories rarely receive close attention in criticism, and the goal is to bring to light new readings of Landolfi’s fantastic narrative...|$|R
