5|$|The Vlaams Blok {{continued}} to be particularly strong in and around Antwerp, where it received as much as 33% {{of the vote in}} the 2000 local elections. In 2001, the party was forced to alter its political program, as according to the laws for party financing, it was not compatible with the <b>European</b> <b>Treaty</b> on Human Rights. In the 2004 Flemish Parliament election, the party finally became the single largest party group in parliament. The party was invited by the formateur for government discussions, only to find that its differences with the other parties was insurmountable, resulting in the three traditional parties forming a majority government, retaining the cordon sanitaire. By this time, the party had nevertheless become the very most popular Flemish party in Belgium, being supported by about one in four of the Flemish electorate.|$|E

2500|$|The primary was {{initially}} fought primarily between Juppé and Sarkozy, {{the top two}} candidates in primary polls. Sarkozy's program emphasized the themes of Islam, immigration, security, and defense. He proposed to end family reunifications and reform the right to birthright citizenship, halt the flow of economic migrants, and increase residence requirements to secure French nationality. He reaffirmed {{his interest in the}} [...] "assimilation" [...] of immigrants, and intended to ban other menus for school canteens (i.e., options for Muslim students) as well as Muslim headscarves at universities. Sarkozy also suggested that radical imams be expelled and suspected terrorists be detained by authorities and tried by a special anti-terrorist court, in addition a reduction in the age of criminal responsibility from 18 to 16. He proposed to postpone the increase the retirement age to 64 until 2024, permit exemptions to the 35-hour workweek, cut 300,000 civil service jobs by increasing working hours to 37 per week, and abolish the wealth tax (ISF). Like Le Maire, he did not rule out the possibility of a referendum on the European Union (EU). He also sought a <b>European</b> <b>treaty</b> [...] "refounding", the creation of a European monetary fund, to commit 2% to defense spending by 2025, and to reduce public spending by €100 billion and taxes by €40 billion while reducing the budget deficit to under 3% of GDP.|$|E

This Chapter explores the ‘English paradox’, i. e. the United Kingdom’s ever-present demands for EU reforms paired with a relative compliance {{when it came to the}} ratification of the successive <b>European</b> <b>treaties.</b> It first deals with the Cameron’s demands for reforms in order to fix the UK-EU relationship and avoid a withdrawal from the EU.
