5|$|Back in the present, Lovett {{decides to}} abandon his search after hearing Rose's story. Alone on the stern of Keldysh, Rose takes out the Heart of the Ocean — in her {{possession}} all along — and drops it into the sea over the wreck site. While she is seemingly asleep or has died in her bed, photos on <b>her</b> <b>dresser</b> depict a life of freedom and adventure inspired by the life she wanted to live with Jack. A young Rose reunites with Jack at the Titanic Grand Staircase, applauded by those who died.|$|E
25|$|As a child, she {{was given}} a lifelike {{chimpanzee}} stuffed animal named Jubilee by her father; her fondness for the toy started her early love of animals. Today, the stuffed animal still sits on <b>her</b> <b>dresser</b> in London. As she writes in her book, Reason for Hope: “My mother’s friends were horrified by this toy, thinking it would frighten me and give me nightmares.” Goodall has a sister, Judith, who shares the same birthday, though the two were born four years apart.|$|E
25|$|They {{looked at}} the case as a murder, with the {{burglary}} staged to throw the police off the trail. Many aspects of the crime were improbable for a break-in, especially one committed in daylight: Rasmussen's jewelry box, an inviting target for a burglar, was in plain view atop <b>her</b> <b>dresser</b> and had not been touched. The condo {{was in the middle}} of a gated complex, surrounded by other units from which burglars could have expected to be easily observed. The front door had an alarm warning, and had not been forced open, as it might have been if the putative burglars had not expected anyone to be at home.|$|E
60|$|Madame Cerise was assuredly {{a skilled}} lady's maid. She bathed the girl, wrapped {{her in an}} ample kimono and then seated <b>her</b> before the <b>dresser</b> and {{arranged}} <b>her</b> coiffure with dextrous skill.|$|R
50|$|In {{addition}} to dressmaking, Keckley assisted Mrs. Lincoln each day as <b>her</b> personal <b>dresser.</b> She also helped Mrs. Lincoln prepare for official receptions {{and other social}} events. For the next six years, Keckley became an intimate witness to the private life of the First Family. Known for her love of fashion, the First Lady kept Keckley busy maintaining and creating new pieces for her extensive wardrobe.|$|R
5000|$|She {{was briefly}} married to John Parker, a window dresser. They married in 1960 and later divorced. As Andy Warhol {{observed}} {{in his book}} Popism: [...] "When Brigid brought <b>her</b> window <b>dresser</b> fiancé home to meet the family, her mother told the doorman {{to tell him to}} wait on a bench across the street in Central Park. Then she handed Brigid her wedding present - a hundred dollar bill - and told her to go to Bergdorf's and buy herself some new underwear with it. Then she added, 'Good luck with that fairy.'" ...|$|R
500|$|When Homer {{is chosen}} by the Republicans to pick their {{candidate}} for the next presidential election, his {{lack of interest in}} the current candidates leads him to choose Ted Nugent. He invites Nugent for a visit to the Simpsons' home, where Lisa complains that Homer has made the wrong pick since Nugent is [...] "out of his mind". Later that day, Homer has a dream in which James Madison shows him how ashamed past American presidents are of Homer. When he wakes up, he tells Lisa he will not be supporting Nugent for president anymore. He then sees a brochure on <b>her</b> <b>dresser</b> with a man posing as a president and offering help with fake dreams. Homer realizes the family faked his dream to convince him not to endorse Nugent. As a result, he angrily decides to go on television and express his support for Nugent. However, when he tries to bring out his ability to cry every time he discusses anything on television, he finds he cannot bring up those emotions because he does not truly believe in what he is saying. Homer [...] announces on television that he [...] "is full of crap" [...] and [...] reconciles with Lisa. As a result, Nugent is stripped of his position as the Republican presidential candidate. The episode ends as he sings a song about what his presidency would have been like.|$|E
60|$|Miss Lotta Lauriere was {{assisting}} {{nature with}} a powder puff, almost {{ready for her}} call at a crowded matinée, when <b>her</b> <b>dresser</b> mentioned the name of Mr. Gillian.|$|E
60|$|But {{now what}} to do with it was a {{question}} of vital importance. She dared not relight her lamp and she was helpless when out of her chair. So she put back the cushion, slid from the bed into the chair and wheeled herself in the dark to <b>her</b> <b>dresser,</b> which had a chenille cover. Underneath this cover she spread the letter, deeming that so simple a hiding-place was likely to be overlooked in a hasty search and feeling that the letter would be safe there for the night, at least.|$|E
50|$|Nine {{years later}} in September 1672, Charles made her another present of £2,150 as a {{marriage}} portion. Sometime before 14 July 1673, she married Thomas Wyndham, one of the King's equerries. Queen Catherine appointed <b>her</b> as a <b>dresser,</b> and she remained in Catherine's service until 1692, seven years {{after the death of}} King Charles.|$|R
50|$|She {{was born}} to the theater {{director}} Jeanne Du Londel and arrived in Sweden with her mother's theater in 1753. She {{became one of the}} most popular actors of the French court theater. She was described as a favorite of the royal court, was granted <b>her</b> own carriage, <b>dresser</b> and other privileges, and was appointed teacher in French for princess Sophia Albertina of Sweden.|$|R
60|$|But, {{assuming}} {{that we are}} again, some day, to become a civilized and governing race, deputing ironmongery, coal-digging, and lucre-digging, to our slaves in other countries, it is quite conceivable that, with an increasing knowledge of natural history, and desire for such knowledge, what is now done by careful, but inefficient, wood-cuts, and in ill-colored engravings, might be put in quite permanent sculptures, with inlay of variegated precious stones, {{on the outside of}} buildings, where such pictures would be little costly to the people; and in a more popular manner still, by Robbia ware and Palissy ware, and inlaid majolica, which would differ from the housewife's present favorite decoration of plates above <b>her</b> kitchen <b>dresser,</b> by being every piece of it various, instructive, and universally visible.|$|R
60|$|The squint-eyed {{woman was}} not so hard to manage. I talked to {{her as if she}} were some male friend of mine, only {{appealing}} to her womanliness with all the soft sadness I could press into the tones of my voice. In the end she was mollified, and even tender and motherly in her feelings toward the unfortunate family. I left on <b>her</b> <b>dresser</b> the half-crown I shrank from offering her, and, having reduced the comb-wearer also, I marched off, carrying the stewpot and the fragments of the ill-fated doe to the cottage of the widow, where George and the girls awaited me.|$|E
60|$|The {{night before}} Thanksgiving came. Maida hurried home, keen and bright with the {{thoughts}} of the blessed morrow. Her thoughts were of purple, but they were white themselves--the joyous enthusiasm of the young for the pleasures that youth must have or wither. She knew purple would become her, and--for the thousandth time she tried to assure herself that it was purple Mr. Ramsay said he liked and not red. She was going home first to get the $4 wrapped {{in a piece of}} tissue paper in the bottom drawer of <b>her</b> <b>dresser,</b> and then she was going to pay Schlegel and take the dress home herself.|$|E

5000|$|Katrin brags to Christine {{that their}} mother is going to buy <b>her</b> the <b>dresser</b> set she has long admired as a {{graduation}} present. As {{she is about to}} leave to perform in the school's production of The Merchant of Venice, Katrin learns that her mother traded her heirloom brooch for the gift. Distraught, the girl performs badly in the play and later retrieves the brooch after trading back the dresser set. Marta then gives the brooch to Katrin as a graduation present. Katrin's father presents her with her first cup of coffee, which she had been told she could drink once she was a grown-up. After taking a few sips of the [...] "adult" [...] beverage, Katrin is overcome with emotion by her parents' gesture, and she rushes out of the room.|$|R
50|$|Jean Carlisle {{returns to}} Stafford {{and she and}} Kimble are briefly reunited. However, because Kimble is {{unsuccessful}} in finding his evidence within the 24 hours he was given, {{he is about to}} leave with Gerard when Donna finds a bullet hidden in one of <b>her</b> sons's <b>dresser</b> drawers. Shown the bullet, Gerard identifies it as being identical to the one they found at the riding academy the night before. Donna tells her husband and the lieutenant that the bullet must have come from Chandler, who had taken a group of boys to a shooting range the day before. Kimble and Gerard head over to the Chandler residence and learn that Chandler has headed to an abandoned amusement park and is luring Johnson there so he can make up for his earlier unwillingness to talk by killing Johnson.|$|R
50|$|The roaring '20s {{are still}} in high gear, and Berlin {{is the center of}} high life. Guests come and go at the opulent Grand Hotel, as cynical Doctor Otternschlag, who still suffers from World War I wounds, injects his morphine. Assistant {{concierge}} Erik, busy at the front desk, waits to hear of his son’s birth; his wife is having a difficult labor. Baron Felix Von Gaigern, young, good-looking and destitute, uses his charisma to help him secure a room in the overbooked hotel while stiffing a tough gangster who pretends to be a chauffeur. Ageing Russian prima ballerina Elizaveta Grushinskaya arrives with her entourage who try to persuade her that she still can and must dance. <b>Her</b> confidante and <b>dresser,</b> Raffaela knows {{that they would have to}} come up with a lot of money if the dancer failed to show up for her contracted engagements. Raffaela has feelings for Elizaveta.|$|R
50|$|In 1886, in Grand Rapids, Michigan, Hindle married <b>her</b> <b>dresser</b> Annie Ryan {{while on}} a tour through the mid-west. Hindle dressed in male {{clothing}} and gave her name as Charles and a local Baptist minister performed the ceremony.|$|E

50|$|The cover design, by Hipgnosis and {{illustrator}} Colin Elgie, {{depicts a}} woman who has an apparent obsession with cats. She {{can be seen in the}} mirror dressing up as a cat for a costume party, and all of the items on <b>her</b> <b>dresser</b> have feline motifs.|$|E
50|$|One night, S.T. {{shows up}} to take out Claudelle and sees {{what he thinks is}} her in the shadows coming to his car and {{it turns out to be}} Jessie who on a whim is wearing Claudelle's white dress. S.T. is {{disappointed}} when Jessie tells him that Claudelle has stood him up again and gone out with Davy. S.T. tells Jessie how he thought she was Claudelle and how she reminds him of a young pretty girl wearing her white dress and asks her to go riding with him. Jessie by this time is completely indifferent to any feelings she had for her husband (who is sound asleep in the house), and she accepts S.T.'s offer. The two of them go riding down to the local make-out place by the lake where they are spotted by Claudelle and Davy who laughs hysterically at them. Back home, a sleeping Clyde wakes up to find Jessie gone and all the gifts in Claudelle's room from her various suitors. When she returns with Davy, she shows off the necklace he gave her to Clyde, who yanks it off her neck and throws it to Davy, ordering him to leave and never come back. Clyde angrily confronts her about all the gifts on <b>her</b> bedroom <b>dresser</b> and is further angered when Claudelle tells him she and Davy saw S.T. and Jessie down by the lake. In a fit of rage, Clyde slaps Claudelle over her promiscuous behavior.|$|R
5|$|In 1897, Victoria {{had written}} {{instructions}} for her funeral, {{which was to}} be military as befitting a soldier's daughter {{and the head of the}} army, and white instead of black. On 25 January, Edward VII, the Kaiser and Prince Arthur, Duke of Connaught, helped lift her body into the coffin. She was dressed in a white dress and her wedding veil. An array of mementos commemorating her extended family, friends and servants were laid in the coffin with her, at her request, by <b>her</b> doctor and <b>dressers.</b> One of Albert's dressing gowns was placed by her side, with a plaster cast of his hand, while a lock of John Brown's hair, along with a picture of him, was placed in her left hand concealed from the view of the family by a carefully positioned bunch of flowers. Items of jewellery placed on Victoria included the wedding ring of John Brown's mother, given to her by Brown in 1883. Her funeral was held on Saturday 2 February, in St George's Chapel, Windsor Castle, and after two days of lying-in-state, she was interred beside Prince Albert in Frogmore Mausoleum at Windsor Great Park.|$|R
50|$|Karasz's {{exploration}} of furniture and silverware was most intense {{in the late}} 1920s and 1930s. Her furniture was often rectilinear and strongly planar, inspired by the European De Stijl movement; she also designed a number of multifunctional pieces. In 1928, she was included in a European-American exhibition put on by Macy's department store in New York, alongside such prominent designers as Kem Weber, Bruno Paul, and Josef Hoffmann. In another 1928 exhibition, organized by American Designers' Gallery in New York, {{she was the only}} woman given responsibility for designing an entire room, and in fact she designed both a model studio apartment and a nursery. The latter is considered possibly the first modern nursery designed in America, and Karasz followed it up with several later nursery designs pragmatically featuring convertible furniture and washable fabrics. Her nursery designs focused on giving a child “an intimate sense of owning a room instead of being owned by it.” Rooms that allowed children to explore and develop intellectual, dramatic, and spatial capabilities. She also tried to incorporate elements that would help very young children learn, such as color-coded knobs on <b>dressers.</b> <b>Her</b> simple design aesthetic for furniture reflected the attention to designing for mass production.|$|R

50|$|Set in London in 1938, {{the film}} focuses on highly {{successful}} and extremely popular theatre actress Julia Lambert (Annette Bening), whose gradual disillusionment with {{her career as}} she approaches middle age has prompted her to ask her husband, stage director Michael Gosselyn (Jeremy Irons), and his financial backer Dolly de Vries (Miriam Margolyes) to close her current production to allow her time to travel abroad. They persuade her to remain with the play throughout the summer; and Michael introduces her to Tom Fennel (Shaun Evans), an enterprising American, who confesses his deep appreciation of her work. Seeking the passion missing from her marriage, and anxious {{to fill the void}} left when her close friend Lord Charles (Bruce Greenwood) suggested they part ways to avoid scandalous gossip, Julia embarks on a passionate affair with the young man and begins to support him so he may enjoy the glamorous lifestyle to which she has introduced him. Their relationship revives her, sparking a distinct change in her personality. Always hovering in the background and offering counsel is the spirit of her mentor, Jimmie Langton (Michael Gambon), the theatrical manager who gave Julia her start and made her a star, while flesh-and-blood Evie (Juliet Stevenson) serves as <b>her</b> personal maid, <b>dresser,</b> and confidante.|$|R

The Duchess' commercial interests have included an eleven-year endorsement with Weight Watchers, product development and promotion with Wedgwood and Avon.|$|E

5000|$|The film resumes with {{everyone}} onstage taking their bows to tremendous applause. Eva {{is a complete}} success.

Renewed, Eva readies herself to forge down the rocky road to stardom ahead of her. The film ends with some uncertainty, but on an upbeat note. Once again self-confident, dramatic to the heart, Eva declares to <b>her</b> <b>dresser,</b> [...] "I'm not afraid...to be a morning glory. I am not afraid!" ...|$|E
