5|$|Historically, {{the game}} was {{developed}} on natural grass turf. <b>However,</b> in 1976, the International Hockey Federation (FIH) made artificial pitches mandatory at all major competitions.

Although it is still permissible to play on natural turf all national competitions and international matches must be played on an artificial surface. Elite-level competitions, such as the Olympic Games and World Cup, require a water-based playing surface. <b>However,</b> due to water conservation efforts, this is not seen as a long-term sustainable option and alternative elite surfaces that do not require water are being researched.|$|E
