5|$|Many CAS family {{proteins}} {{have altered}} activity and functional roles in cancer progression and metastasis, with functional roles <b>in</b> <b>influencing</b> cellular adhesion, migration and drug resistance.

In addition, this study detected a significant difference in cytoplasmic accumulation of CASS4 protein between high (H1299 and BE1) and low (LTE and A549) metastatic potential lung cancer cell lines. These may suggest CASS4 as a possible prognostic marker in clinical management of NSCLC.|$|E

5|$|Cabernet Sauvignon {{is a very}} {{bold and}} {{assertive}} wine that has potential to overwhelm light and delicate dishes. The wine's high tannin content {{as well as the}} oak influences and high alcohol levels associated with many regional styles play important roles <b>in</b> <b>influencing</b> how well the wine matches with different foods. When Cabernet Sauvignon is young, all those elements are at their peak, but as the wine ages it mellows; possibilities for different food pairings open up. In most circumstances, matching the weight (alcohol level and body) of the wine to the heaviness of the food is an important consideration. Cabernet Sauvignons with high alcohol levels do not pair well with spicy foods due to hotness levels of the capsaicins present in spices like chili peppers being enhanced by the alcohol with the heat accentuating the bitterness of the tannins. Milder spices, such as black pepper, pair better due to their ability to minimize the perception of tannins—such as in the classic pairings of Cabernet Sauvignon with steak au poivre and pepper-crusted ahi tuna.|$|E
5|$|Changes in {{government}} may occur during the campaign, for example {{as a consequence}} of a rise in republicanism. The United States may only come into existence if the ruling British Empire is unable to maintain social order. In addition, nations with highly unpopular governments and a history of workers' unrest may experience revolutions similar to the French Revolution. When the middle or upper classes become disenchanted with a current government, a civil war or revolt may occur. Upon revolution, the player can choose to side with the rebels or with the loyalists. The type of government selected by the player will determine how other factions view the player and influence their diplomatic relations.

However, if Lodge was concerned about keeping a low profile regarding the coup, Khánh was not, arriving at Dunn's residence with seven jeeploads of aides before embracing Lodge. He told Lodge that he would go after the communists aggressively and that the coup would not disrupt the military in any significant way. Khánh vowed to intensify the war effort, ask Lodge for guidance constantly, introduce democracy and install a direct phone line between Vietnamese military headquarters and the US Embassy.

5|$|The government's {{creation}} of the Imperial Academy of the Fine Arts in the 1820s {{played a pivotal role}} <b>in</b> <b>influencing</b> and expanding the visual arts in Brazil, mainly by educating generations of artists but also by serving as a stylistic guideline. The Academy's origins lay in the foundation of the Escola Real das Ciências, Artes e Ofícios (Royal School of the Sciences, Arts and Crafts) in 1816 by the Portuguese King JoãoVI. Its members—of whom the most famous was Jean-Baptiste Debret—were French émigrées who worked as painters, sculptors, musicians and engineers. The school's main goal was to encourage French aesthetics and the Neoclassical style to replace the prevalent baroque style. Plagued by a lack of funds since its inception, the school was later renamed as the Academy of Fine Arts in 1820, and in 1824 received its final name under the Empire: Imperial Academy of the Fine Arts.|$|E

Quigley also argued that, although the Round Table still exists today, its position <b>in</b> <b>influencing</b> the policies of world leaders has been much reduced from its heyday during World War I and slowly waned after the end of World War II and the Suez Crisis. Today the Round Table is largely a ginger group, designed to consider and gradually influence the policies of the Commonwealth of Nations, but faces strong opposition. Furthermore, in American society after 1965, the problem, according to Quigley, was that no elite was in charge and acting responsibly.|$|E

40|$|A {{fundamental}} paradox {{in western}} societies has emerged: cases concerning trading <b>in</b> <b>influence</b> {{become more and more}} imminent and with it the necessity to deal effectively with this phenomenon. International conventions call for the criminalization of this form of corruption but many States are hesitant to establish this form of corruption as a criminal offence under their domestic law. Recent scandals such as the Duchess of York, Sarah Ferguson, promising access to her ex-husband Prince Andrew, who serves as a quasi-official trade envoy for Great Britain, to ‘rich businessmen' {{is just one of the}} more obvious cases in which a person promises to exert an improper influence over the decision-making process of a public official in return for an undue advantage. Current allegations of the illegal financing of Sarkozy's 2007 election campaign by L'Oreal's heiress Bettencourt and the influencing by the others involved in this case, are exemplary of the value of ‘having access to the decision maker'. Trading <b>in</b> <b>influence,</b> or influence peddling, is not something new in the debate on corruption. It found its way in the Council of Europe's Criminal Convention on Corruption (hereinafter ‘COE Convention') as early as 1999. The principal aim of the Convention is to develop common standards concerning certain corrupt offences, although it does not prescribe a uniform definition of corruption. By harmonising the definitions for specific corrupt offences, it aims at meeting the requirement of dual criminality. The COE Convention has been ratified by 43 States, over one fourth of these States have made a reservation against the undertaking to introduce criminal provisions for trading <b>in</b> <b>influence.</b> Among these are the United Kingdom, Denmark and the Netherlands. Nevertheless, allegations of trading <b>in</b> <b>influence</b> and unjustified <b>influencing</b> are omnipresent <b>in</b> media coverage. From the latest COE Convention Evaluation and Compliance reports, it becomes clear that many of the ratifying States face difficulties in providing adequate legal instruments in their anti-corruption policies to deal with trading <b>in</b> <b>influence.</b> The more surprising it is that the Council of Europe and its Member States were not actively discussing this topic in order to reach a common ground for a provision on trading <b>in</b> <b>influence.</b> Why does the Council of Europe persistently continue to stress the importance of criminalizing trading <b>in</b> <b>influence</b> while some of its Member States are determined in their refusal to criminalize trading <b>in</b> <b>influence</b> without seeking for further dialogue? Few analyses were to be found on this paradox although the topicality of this pressing matter is evident. In this paper I will explain how, considering the systemic character of trading <b>in</b> <b>influence</b> can help the Council of Europe and its Member States choosing the right instruments to tackle this form of corruption. influence peddling; corruption; trading <b>in</b> <b>influence...</b>|$|R
