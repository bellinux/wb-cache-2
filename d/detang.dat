5000|$|Legends of Wang Ze and his revolt, a {{historical}} event, were popular since the Yuan Dynasty and commonly embellished with elements from Chinese mythology. The novel attributed to Luo Guanzhong is a shenmo novel {{loosely based on}} Wang's revolt and published in the 16th century. It is not certain if Luo is the genuine author of the novel. The appearance of lijia, a social institution for local governance in rural areas, suggests that the text was written during or after the 15th century, but {{this may have been}} an alteration by a later editor. The original copies of the book attributed to Luo are lost. [...] The only surviving works of Luo's earlier story are a revised edition published by Wang Shenxiu and the Nanjing publishing house Shi <b>Detang.</b> Three copies of the revised novel are still extant. It contains twenty chapters, separated into four juan or sections.|$|E
