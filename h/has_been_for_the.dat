[...] Mohun stated [...] "we were all called upon to admire as an achievement of civilisation over barbarism" [...] the removal of the Arab slavers but that [...] "I believe the Arabs when they permanently occupied a country did a very great deal of good, much more than they will ever be given credit for". [...] It was then his, and Casement's, belief that [...] "slavery still exists ... For the native I believe the change <b>has</b> <b>been</b> <b>for</b> <b>the</b> worst as they certainly don't have the same respect for a dirty native chief as they had for the powerful Arab always clean, and even the worst of them with the manners of gentlemen". [...] Mohun also recounts the case of Nyangwe, a town of 3,000 houses and up to 45,000 inhabitants that he encountered, within a year of a Free State army post being established there the town had been completely destroyed. [...] In 1896 he noted that one of the Belgian generals had encouraged the cruelty and that the situation improved after he was recalled by King Leopold.|$|E
