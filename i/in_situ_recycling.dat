The European research project PARAMIX aims {{to improve the}} techniques for hot mix recycling in plant and cold mix <b>in</b> <b>situ</b> <b>recycling,</b> so as {{to increase the amount}} of reclaimed asphalt and develop competitive road pavement rehabilitation techniques. This paper deals with the design of hot mix asphalts for the project. The different phases in the design process are described: the characterization of the reclaimed asphalt and the new material components, the volumetric mix design procedure and the laboratory study. Two types of mixes were considered: stone mastic asphalt and asphalt concrete. The percentages of reclaimed asphalt in these mixes were high: up to 30 % for the SMA and 50 % for the asphalt concrete.

40|$|Pavement {{rehabilitation}} is {{a critical}} component to maintain pavement serviceability and performance. Riding surface of the pavement deteriorates over time due to environment, load, material and construction related distresses. In a society where funding and natural resources are scarce, sustainable pavement rehabilitations become the emerging trend to maximize pavement performance using the available funds. Cold In-Place Recycling with Expanded Asphalt Mix (CIREAM) is a very sustainable pavement rehabilitation technique currently available in the industry. CIREAM is an in-place recycling technique that utilizes expanded asphalt (also known as foamed asphalt) without pulverizing the existing pavement. It works similar to cold in-place recycling (CIR) in terms of milling existing pavement when CIR typically uses emulsified asphalt to provide additional adhesion to the recycled aggregates. Foamed asphalt and emulsified asphalt both use water as an additive to cause asphalt cement to foam. The potential benefit of CIREAM includes savings in asphalt cement, <b>in</b> <b>situ</b> <b>recycling</b> of aggregates, significant money and time savings in transportation cost and disposal cost, and low curing time after rehabilitation for traffic...|$|E

40|$|AbstractAccess to chiral {{alcohols}} of high optical purity {{is today}} frequently {{provided by the}} enzymatic reduction of precursor ketones. However, bioreductions are complicated by the need for reducing equivalents {{in the form of}} NAD(P) H. The high price and molecular weight of NAD(P) H necessitate <b>in</b> <b>situ</b> <b>recycling</b> of catalytic quantities, which is mostly accomplished by enzymatic oxidation of a cheap co-substrate. The coupled oxidoreduction can be either performed by free enzymes in solution or by whole cells. Reductase selection, the decision between cell-free and whole cell reduction system, coenzyme recycling mode and reaction conditions represent design options that strongly affect bioreduction efficiency.

40|$|ABSTRACT: An {{electrochemical}} DNA biogate {{was designed}} for highly sensitive homogeneous electrochemical immunoassay by combining target-induced proximity hybridization with a mesoporous silica nanoprobe (MSN). The electroactive methylene blue (MB) was sealed in the inner pores of MSN with single-stranded DNA. In the presence of target protein and two DNA-labeled antibodies, the formed proximate complex could hybridize with the DNA strand to form a rigid double-stranded structure and thus open the biogate, {{which led to the}} release of MB entrapped in the MSN. The target protein-dependent amount of released MB could be conveniently monitored with a screen-printed carbon electrode.

40|$|The {{work in this}} Thesis {{addresses}} the challenges associated with using redox enzymes for chemical synthesis. The use of enzymes as catalysts in the synthesis of fine chemicals is becoming more wide spread, in part due their ability to catalyse reactions with incredible selectivity under relatively mild conditions. In particular, enzymes are useful for selective reduction of ketones to enantiomerically pure alcohols or amines, and partial oxidations of alkanes to alcohols. However, a key limitation to exploiting redox enzymes in these reaction pathways is the requirement for a specialised electron source, usually the expensive nicotinamide cofactors NADH or NADPH. Existing cofactor regeneration methods use a second enzyme with a sacrificial substrate which is oxidised to generate a stoichiometric waste product; this complicates isolation of the desired product and prevents the environmental benefits of biocatalysis from being fully realised. In order to provide clean and efficient biocatalytic routes, improved recycling methods for these cofactors are crucial. This Thesis develops two novel methods for <b>in</b> <b>situ</b> cofactor <b>recycling.</b> The first is an electro-enzymatic system; an NAD + -reductase enzyme is shown to use electrons directly from an electrode for supply of NADH to a co-immobilised cofactor-dependent enzyme. The second uses a hydrogenase, NAD + reductase and cofactor-dependent enzyme immobilised on conducting particles for H 2 -driven NADH regeneration. This relies on the thermodynamically favourable reduction of NAD + by H 2 when the hydrogenase and NAD + -reductase are in electronic contact, provided by the conducting particle. The electro-enzymatic approach to NAD + reduction is then adapted for electrochemical devices; an enzyme catalysed fuel cell and a self-powered biosensor were considered.

In Italy, although the necessary know-how exists for the technology to be correctly applied, it has seldom been used.

The interaction between the flavin (FAD) containing HbpA enzyme and the corresponding biomimetic NADH compound, N-benzyl- 1, 4 -dihdronicotinamide, 1 b, for hydride transfers, was shown to readily occur. The <b>in</b> <b>situ</b> <b>recycling</b> of the reduced NADH biomimic 1 b from 1 a was accomplished with [Cp*Rh(bpy) H](Cl); however, productive coupling of this regeneration reaction to the enzymatic hydroxylation reaction was not totally successful, due to a deactivation process concerning the HbpA enzyme peripheral groups; i. e., -SH or -NH{sub 2 } possibly reacting with the precatalyst, [Cp*Rh(bpy) (H{sub 2 }O) ](Cl) {sub 2 }, and thus inhibiting the co-factor regeneration process.

In this study, the homotetrameric SuSy from Acidithiobacillus caldus (SuSyAc) was immobilized-stabilized on agarose beads activated with either (i) glyoxyl groups, (ii) cyanogen bromide groups, or (iii) heterogeneously activated with both glyoxyl and positively charged amino groups. The multipoint covalent immobilization of SuSyAc on glyoxyl agarose at pH 10. 0 under optimized conditions provided a significant stabilization factor at reaction conditions (pH 5. 0 and 45 °C). However, this strategy did not stabilize the enzyme quaternary structure. Thus, a post-immobilization technique using functionalized polymers, such as polyethyleneimine (PEI) and dextran-aldehyde (dexCHO), was applied to cross-link all enzyme subunits. The coating of the optimal SuSyAc immobilized glyoxyl agarose with a bilayer of 25 kDa PEI and 25 kDa dexCHO completely stabilized the quaternary structure of the enzyme. Accordingly, the combination of immobilization and post-immobilization techniques led to a biocatalyst 340 -fold more stable than the non-cross-linked biocatalyst, preserving 60 % of its initial activity. This biocatalyst produced 256 mM of UDP-glucose in a single batch, accumulating 1 M after five reaction cycles.

40|$|The need {{to apply}} <b>in</b> <b>situ</b> cold <b>recycling</b> {{techniques}} for flexible pavement rehabilitation arises in response to economic, environmental and operational issues. Where a pavement is in a distressed state there is always an option to recycle the existing material and obtain benefits in terms of lower construction costs, improved durability and reduction in the negative effects that construction has on the environment. The possibility offered by foam bitumen stabilized layer to allow immediate construction of the upper layers of the pavement is often in contrast with times requested by the traditional testing techniques. In this regards the use of Light Weight Deflectometer (LWD) systems offers the possibility to evaluate short term bearing capacity of cold recycled layers for quality control/quality assurance (QC/QA) activities. Moreover, this allows {{a large amount of}} data to be recorded rapidly, thereby guaranteeing a more detailed investigation and the possibility to identify homogeneous sections and, in extreme cases, to re-work the layer before the pavement is completed. This paper reports the results of several experiences on validation of innovative field testing systems for recycled layers. Different curing time periods were taken into account, as far as the influence of the anisotropic factor induced by compaction: different tracks for each lane were tested at different curing periods, both for lime-cement stabilized subbase and foamed asphalt recycled layers, to obtain the development of the stiffness and a higher resolution of bearing capacity mapping.

40|$|A single-step, {{extractive}} reaction for {{extraction of}} lipids such as biodiesel components, omega- 3 fatty acids, or other triglycerides from microbial cells was examined. Conventional methods for lipid extraction use toxic solvents, and require multiple steps and long processing times. When {{the goal is}} to produce fatty acid methyl esters or FAMEs, the extracted lipids are subjected to a separate transesterification reaction with simple alcohols in the presence of an acid or base catalyst. A simplified, single-step reactive extraction method can be applied that combines the sequential extraction followed by transesterification using acidified alcohols - a process known as <b>in</b> <b>situ</b> transesterification. It was hypothesized that the <b>in</b> <b>situ</b> transesterification could be scaled-up for industrial processing by a systematic understanding of fundamental reaction parameters including temperature, catalyst concentration, and biomass/solvent ratios. The hypothesis was tested using a marine fungus, Schizochytrium limacinum SR 21. Growth of SR 21 resulted in biomass yields of 0. 3 g-biomass/g-glycerol and accumulated high amounts of palmitic acid (C 16 : 0, 0. 255 g-FAME/g-biomass), docosahexaenoic acid (DHA, C 22 : 6, 0. 185 g-FAME/g-biomass), myristic acid (C 14 : 0) (0. 017 g-FAME/g-biomass), and pentadecanoic acid (C 15 : 0, 0. 012 g-FAME/g-biomass). The bulk phase separation characteristics of the FAMEs were evaluated at high biomass concentrations. Recyclability of the acidified methanol in the system was also tested. A significant finding was that automatic phase separation of the FAMEs could be achieved. When FAME concentration reaches critical solubility, 22. 7 mg-FAME ml- 1 methanol, all remaining FAMEs automatically phase separate. After FAME separation, the remaining methanol was recycled and used <b>in</b> subsequent <b>in</b> <b>situ</b> reactions.

40|$|Paper {{presented}} at the 21 st Annual South African Transport Conference 15 - 18 July 2002 "Towards building capacity and accelerating delivery", CSIR International Convention Centre, Pretoria, South Africa. The use of foamed bitumen treated materials {{in the construction of}} pavement layers is increasing both in South Africa and internationally. These materials are used as a method of cold treatment, and are particularly useful when used in conjunction with the Deep <b>In</b> <b>Situ</b> <b>Recycling</b> (DISR) technology. With the growing need to construct new roads for rural access in southern Africa and to rehabilitate existing roads, these materials are a viable option, because of the many advantages associated with their use, including: • The ability to open the rehabilitated road to traffic immediately after construction, thereby eliminating the need to construct temporary detours and minimizing traffic disruption; • Cheaper construction costs than standard methods of rehabilitation; • Lower quality aggregates can be effectively used in pavement layers when treated with foamed bitumen, and • Environmental savings through the reuse of natural materials. Although foamed bitumen treated materials have been successfully used for a number of years, the structural adequacy of these materials has not been quantitatively proven. Recently, research has been performed to assess the structural performance of foamed bitumen materials. The data used to develop the structural design models were obtained from both laboratory and Heavy Vehicle Simulator (HVS) testing. This paper discusses the development of these models. The paper begins with a discussion on the materials used to generate the data, then discusses the HVS and laboratory tests, and finally, presents the transfer functions. The models were developed from data on one material type and are most applicable to materials similar to this parent material. The models will be calibrated, modified and updated as more data become available. This paper was transferred from the original CD ROM created for this conference.

40|$|Oxidation of {{alcohols}} is {{a reaction}} of major interest for organic chemistry. However, {{the most common}} chemical routes developed so far involve the use of toxic or hazardous reagents or catalysts that often lack good chemoselectivity. In this respect, alcohol dehydrogenases (ADHs) represent a very valuable biocatalytic alternative, as they can operate in more sustainable conditions and with excellent selectivities. Another interesting class of oxidoreductases that catalyse the reduction of activated C¬C double bonds are the ene-reductases (ERs). Similarly to alcohol dehydrogenases, these are NAD(P) -dependent enzymes which {{do not have an}} actual chemical catalyst counterpart. For both enzyme groups one of the major hurdles en route to preparative applications is the need of nicotinamide cofactors. The most popular approach to tackle the cofactor-dependency issue is the use of regeneration systems able to catalyse the <b>in</b> <b>situ</b> <b>recycling</b> of NAD(P). Recently also increasing attention has been devoted to the use of NAD(P) -like molecules that potentially able to mimic the coenzymic activity of the native cofactor. This thesis is focused on the development of NAD(P) + regeneration systems for ADH-catalysed oxidations and on evaluation of electron donors others than the NADPH to be applied for the ene-reductases catalysis. Chapter 1 gives an introduction on the potential and limitations of both ADHs-catalysed oxidations and ERs-catalysed reductions. As a major focus the cofactor dependency issue in these enzymes is being addressed: in the case of alcohol oxidations, the use of regeneration systems for the NAD(P) + is discussed; the application of various reductants, including NAD(P) H-like structures, to promote ERs-catalysed reductions is also reviewed. In Chapter 2 a novel NAD(P) + regeneration system based on the use of photoexcited flavins is presented. The scope of this work was to develop a catalytic system able to regenerate both NAD+ and NADP+, thereby being able to promote alcohol dehydrogenases-catalysed oxidations. Irradiation of flavins with visible light resulted in a dramatic rate acceleration of the NAD(P) H oxidation. The system was used to promote some model oxidation reactions by the horse liver and the Thermus sp. ATN 1 enzymes. In Chapter 3, the further exploitation of the ADH from Thermus sp. ATN 1 (TADH) in combination with the Thermus scodoductus ER to setup a catalytic sequence for the isomerisation of allylic alcohols into saturated ketones is described. The system was developed with a model substrate and proved to be suitable for the production of enantiopure ketones from the corresponding unsaturated alcohols. The cofactor regeneration is accomplished here by means of an enzyme-coupled approach. The crystal structure of TADH is reported and analysed with particular respect to the interaction with the ([Cp*Rh(bpy) (H 2 O) ] 2 +) catalyst for the regeneration of NADH, in Chapter 5. A first basis towards understanding of the mechanisms leading to inactivation of the both enzyme and Rh-complex is discusses in here. Also structural features of this enzyme compared to other thermostable ADHs are highlighted. In Chapter 6 the use of ethylendiaminetetraacetic acid (EDTA) to promote ene-reductases catalysis upon illumination has been investigated and is reported together with the biochemical characterisation of two recently identified reductases. The Deinococcus radiodurans and the Ralstonia metallidurans enzymes have been characterised with respect to the substrate scope and cofactor preference. In Chapter 4 the use of synthetic nicotinamide analogs for the ene-reductases catalysis is reported. The investigated molecules proved to perform in the catalytic cycle just as good as the NADH. Additionally, a chemoselectivity advantage could be gained from the use of NADH analogs in the presence of contaminating ADHs. Overall this work dealt with the applicability of alcohol dehydrogenase and ene-reductases for biocatalytic applications. In ADHs catalysis the cofactor issue was addressed both by developing a novel regeneration system and by applying the concept of an enzyme coupled regeneration. On the other hand, in ERs catalysis the regeneration of the prosthetic group was tackled by the use of NADH or its synthetic analogs as reductants. A light-driven system was also used to promote the ER-reductions. Finally, the combination of an ER with an ADH for the isomerisation of allylic alcohols was developed which resulted in the setup of a promising new route for the production of saturated carbonyl compounds.

40|$|ABSTRACT: The <b>in</b> <b>situ</b> cosmogenic nuclide 14 C {{is unique}} {{compared}} with other nuclides because of its short half-life, and when combined with longer-lived isotopes (e. g. 10 Be), <b>in</b> <b>situ</b> 14 C {{can be a powerful}} tool for deciphering recent and complex surface exposure histories. Like all <b>in</b> <b>situ</b> cosmogenic nuclides, quantifying earth surface processes with <b>in</b> <b>situ</b> 14 C requires a well-constrained <b>in</b> <b>situ</b> 14 C production rate. We present a production-rate calibration from an independently dated moraine in West Greenland, previously used as an <b>in</b> <b>situ</b> 10 Be production-rate calibration site. The local <b>in</b> <b>situ</b> 14 C production rate is 22. 8 1. 4 atoms g 1 a 1 (69. 28 ˚N, 50. 76 ˚ W; 350 m asl) and when scaled to sea level/high latitude using time-dependent Lal/Stone scaling (Lm), we calculate a spallation-only <b>in</b> <b>situ</b> 14 C production rate of 12. 0 0. 9 atoms g 1 a 1 and a 14 C/ 10 Be production rate ratio of 3. 1 0. 2.

40|$|<b>In</b> <b>situ</b> concept(-based) {{computing}} {{is based}} on the notion that conceptual representations in the human brain are ‘in situ’. In this way, they are grounded in perception and action. Examples are neuronal assemblies, whose connection structures develop over time and are distributed over different brain areas. <b>In</b> <b>situ</b> concepts representations cannot be copied or duplicated because that will disrupt their connection structure, and thus the meaning of these concepts. Higher-level cognitive processes, as found in language and reasoning, can be performed with <b>in</b> <b>situ</b> concepts by embedding them in specialized neurally-inspired ‘blackboards’. The interactions between the <b>in</b> <b>situ</b> concepts and the blackboards form the basis for <b>In</b> <b>situ</b> concept computing architectures. In these architectures memory (concepts) and processing are interwoven, in contrast with the separation between memory and processing found in Von Neumann architectures.

40|$|KEY WORDS <b>in</b> <b>situ</b> straining; <b>in</b> <b>situ</b> compression; crack nucleation; crack propagation; {{metallic}} glasses; shear bands ABSTRACT In {{the field}} of transmission electron microscopy (TEM), fundamental and practical reasons still remain that hamper a straightforward correlation between microscopic structural in-formation and deformation mechanisms in materials. In this article, {{it is argued that}} one should focus in particular on <b>in</b> <b>situ</b> rather than on postmortem observations of the microstructure. This viewpoint has been exemplified with <b>in</b> <b>situ</b> straining and <b>in</b> <b>situ</b> compression studies on metallic glasses. <b>In</b> <b>situ</b> TEM straining of amorphous metals permits an evaluation of the thickness of the liquid-like layer (LLL) formed because of heat evolution after shear band development. The experi-mental evaluation confirms that the thickness of a LLL present at the last moment of fracture sub-stantially exceeds the generally accepted thickness of a shear band. <b>In</b> <b>situ</b> TEM and <b>in</b> <b>situ</b> SEM compression experiments on metallic glass pillars lead to the conclusion that smaller sized pillars deform more homogeneously than larger sized pillars.

40|$|ABSTRACT Ascorbic acid {{requirements}} {{are based on}} pre-venting the deficiency disease scurvy and on urinary excretion of vitamin C. We proposed the first quantitative approach to determining optimal requirements for ascorbic acid and other vitamins, called <b>in</b> <b>situ</b> kinetics. <b>In</b> <b>situ</b> kinetics biochemically {{is based on the}} application ofMichaeis-Menten reaction kinetics to ascorbic acid-dependent reactions <b>in</b> <b>situ.</b> Clinically <b>in</b> <b>situ</b> kinetics is based on determining vitamin availability to tissues so that cell-specific reactions can occur. The biochemical con-cepts of <b>in</b> <b>situ</b> kinetics are verified for the first time through studying ascorbic acid regulation ofnorepinephrine biosynthesis. The principles of <b>in</b> <b>situ</b> kinetics can now be applied to humans and human cells and for determining optimal requirements for ascorbic acid and for other vitamins.
