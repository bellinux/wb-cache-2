50|$|Glacial {{plucking}} is {{the main}} mechanism of other small scale mechanical glacial erosion such as striation, abrasion and <b>glacial</b> <b>polishing.</b> The heavier the sediment load, the more extreme {{the erosion of the}} downhill landscape. Erosion is largely dependent on the amount of water flow and its velocity, the clast size and hardness with relation to the stability of the slope.|$|R
5000|$|<b>Glacial</b> <b>polishing</b> is {{the result}} of clasts {{embedded}} in glacial ice passing over bedrock and grinding down the top of the rock into a smoother surface. The small rocks entrained by plucking act like sandpaper to the downhill slope. [...] This creates an almost mirror like surface in the rock. Polish indicates a more recent process as it is often lost to weathering of the rock surface.|$|R

50|$|<b>Glacial</b> <b>polish</b> is a {{characteristic}} of rock surfaces where glaciers have passed over bedrock, typically granite or other hard igneous or metamorphic rock. Moving ice will carry pebbles and sand grains removed from upper levels which in turn grind a smooth or grooved surface upon the underlying rock. The presence of such polish indicates that the glaciation was relatively recent (in geologic time scale) or was subsequently protected by deposition, as such polish will be subsequently lost due to weathering processes (such as exfoliation).|$|E
50|$|Although Indian Rock {{may appear}} to be several rocks piled together, it {{actually}} originated as a single boulder (18 ft by 9 ft by 15 ft). Weaknesses within the rock caused by foliation and naturally occurring fractures serve as avenues for moisture infiltration. With repeated freeze-thaw cycles, this moisture expands to exert forces up to 20,000 lbs/inch2 along the planes of weakness, thus wedging the rock apart. <b>Glacial</b> <b>polish,</b> striations and grooves commonly found on erratics of this size have for the most part been effaced by the normal process of decomposition called weathering.|$|E
40|$|Abstract：The {{timing and}} extent of glaciations during the Late Quaternary in the South Shetland Islands, West Antarctica were defined using field mapping, geomorphic {{analysis}} and radiocarbon dating. Landforms of glacial erosion and deposition, in particular subglacial meltwater channel erosion, suggest that at least three glaciations occurred during the late Quaternary within the study region. During the global LGM, glacial troughs (such as Maxwell Bay and Admiralty Bay) were overdeepened by an ice stream moving south from an~ 1000 m-thick ice cap centered on the present-day continental shelf to the north. This ice {{was responsible for the}} subglacial meltwater channel erosion, and <b>glacial</b> <b>polished</b> and striated bedrock on the Fildes Peninsula. The recent local glaciations occurred about 2, 000 years ago and during Little Ice Age (LIA). During these glaciations, glaciers were less extensive than the previous one and less erosive as a cold-based ice...|$|R
40|$|The main {{objective}} {{of this research is}} to improve knowledge of the deglaciation stages in Sierra Nevada (southern Spain) by applying 36 Cl cosmogenic exposure dating to 28 samples from moraine and fossil rock glacier boulders and <b>glacial</b> <b>polished</b> surfaces, in 5 glaciated valleys around Veleta Peak (3396 m asl; 37 0300200 N 3 2005400 W). The results show that shortly before the Last Glacial Maximum (LGM) and during the LGM, the heads of the glacial valleys were occupied by ice tongues, with possible glacial transfluence between the valleys. After 19 ka, a major glacial regression started, but glaciers during the Oldest Dryas (OD) expanded again and refilled the valley bottoms. The glacial advances of the pre-LGM, LGM and OD formed polygenic moraine systems. During the Bølling-Allerød the glaciers receded and probably disappeared. Thereafter, the valley bottoms remained ice-free. During the Younger Dryas (YD) small glaciers developed again, but only in cirques shaped on east-facing slopes. Subsequently, these glaciers started retreating towards their valley heads and finally disappeared completely. With the onset of the Holocene, rock glaciers developed inside the deglaciated cirques on the eastern slopes of some valleys, but only under the most active and protected headwalls did large complex rock glaciers develop and remained active until the mid-Holocene. info:eu-repo/semantics/publishedVersio...|$|R
50|$|The Hudson Plains Ecoregion soil has Paleozoic and Proterozoic {{rock with}} marine silty and clayey sediments on the coastal shore that are young, poorly developed, and saline. The marine soils were {{deposited}} by glacial and marine processes. Permafrost extends in continuous stretches in the Northwest to isolated patches in the Southwest. Glaciation and permafrost {{in the soil}} have made drainage slow to non-existent, decreasing rates of decay. In the south, the soil is partially decayed organic material, while in warmer drier locations, the soil is moderately weathered minerals. In other locations, the soil is frozen organic material. During the last ice age, the area was depressed {{by the weight of}} the ice and ocean water flooded inland past the current coastline. As the ice retreated, drainage to the Hudson Bay was blocked, creating expansive lakes such as Lakes Agassiz and Ojibway. In winter months, ice packs exist in the Hudson Bay that change the topography until the warmer months arrive, when the ice pack retreats, affecting animals such as polar bears and Arctic foxes that use the ice pack. Wetlands and peatlands cover the area due to its flat nature. In the region, coastal marshes and wide tidal flats. On the east coast of the Hudson Bay, <b>glacial</b> <b>polishes</b> and striations were formed from the erosion of glacial ice on exposed rock. Sandy strip-like features indicate beach ridges, marking the continuing isostatic rebound of the landscape. Over the landscape, there are alternating depressions, bogs, and fens. The major rivers are the Nelson and Hayes in Manitoba; the Severn, Winisk, Albany, and Abittibi in Ontario; and the Eastmain and La Grande in Quebec. Traveling west, the landscape becomes boreal forest. Vegetation varies latitudinally, following the poor drainage patterns of the soil. Peat-covered lowlands are waterlogged for prolonged periods, promoting and developing important habitats for waterfowl. Along with waterfowl, the high water concentrations give rise to massive populations of insects. In the rivers, streams, and lakes, fish species such as brook trout and walleye exist. As the summer arrives, the number and variety of wildlife increases greatly.|$|R

50|$|The Cadillac Mountain Intrusive Complex {{is part of}} the Coastal Maine Magmatic Province, {{consisting}} of over a hundred mafic and felsic plutons associated with the Acadian Orogeny. Mount Desert Island bedrock consists mainly of Cadillac Mountain granite. Perthite lends itself to the granite's pinkish color. The Silurian age granite ranges from 424 to 419 Ma. Diabase dikes trend north-south through the complex. Almost 300 Ma of erosion followed before the deposition of glacial features during the Pleistocene. These include <b>glacial</b> <b>polish,</b> glacial striations, and chatter marks. Other features include The Bubbles, two R%C3%B4che moutonn%C3%A9es, and the U-shaped valleys of Sargent Mountain Pond, Jordan Pond, Seal Cove Pond, Long Pond, Echo Lake and Eagle Lake.

2500|$|During the Pleistocene (approximately 1.8 to 0.001 Ma ago) climatic {{variations}} {{resulted in}} an extension of glacial fields to the mid-latitudes. While there are no remnants of glaciers now, their Ice Age products (U-shaped valleys, moraines, <b>glacial</b> deposits, <b>polished</b> and natural granite surfaces) are identified in the Serra da Peneda, Serra do Soajo and Serra do Gerês mountain ranges. The principal watersheds that cross the park {{are those of the}} Minho (occupying 2% of the park), Lima (47.8%) and Cávado [...] (50.2%), with brooks and waterfalls common on many of the mountain slopes, in addition to several secondary tributaries (such as the Homem, Rabagão, Castro Laboreiro, and Arado rivers). The Cávado cuts across the PNPG east to west, while the Lima serves the southern limits of the districts of Vila Real and Braga. Fractures in the landscape have confined the rivers to deep, straight valleys and are visible in the younger granite outcrops visible in the uncovered higher altitudes. Owing to the number tributaries, the construction of hydroelectrical dams has been undertaken to generate electricity across six locations: Alto Rabagão, Paradela, Caniçada, Vilarinho da Furna, Touvedo and Lindoso.|$|R
50|$|Cascade Canyon {{is located}} in Grand Teton National Park, in the U.S. state of Wyoming. The canyon was formed by glaciers which retreated {{at the end of}} the last glacial maximum {{approximately}} 15,000 years ago. Today, Cascade Canyon has numerous <b>polished</b> <b>glacial</b> erratics, hanging cirques and a U-shape as evidences that demonstrate that glaciers once filled the canyon to a depth of at least 2000 ft. Rock debris that was transported out of the canyon by glacial motion formed moraines which now impound the waters of Jenny Lake which is located at the base of the canyon. Cascade Creek now flows where the glaciers once did and the numerous waterfalls, such as the 100 ft tall Hidden Falls, found within the gorge are popular destinations with tourists.|$|R
5|$|The Itcha Range is the {{smallest}} shield volcano in the Anahim Volcanic Belt in terms of area covered. Unlike the Rainbow and Ilgachuz ranges, the Itcha Range is composed of small coalescing volcanic units rather than a stratiform volcanic pile. It is, in many respects, similar to the small alkaline shields found in Kenya and Ethiopia along the East African Rift. About 60% of the shield is exposed while roughly 40% of it remains buried under glacial drift deposits. This suggests that the Itcha Range was glaciated repeatedly during the Pleistocene epoch. <b>Glacial</b> striae on <b>polished</b> surfaces {{of some of the}} oldest volcanic rocks {{in the eastern part of}} the shield and the local presence of drift deposits throughout the stratigraphy indicate that glaciation and volcanism were contemporaneous through much of the volcanic history of the Itcha Range.|$|R
60|$|And if such be the {{attitude}} of the uneducated man towards the permanent terrors of nature, what will it be towards those which are sudden and seemingly capricious?--towards storms, earthquakes, floods, blights, pestilences? We know too well what it has been-- one of blind, and therefore often cruel, fear. How could it be otherwise? Was Theophrastus's superstitious man so very foolish for pouring oil on every round stone? I think {{there was a great deal}} to be said for him. This worship of Baetyli was rational enough. They were aerolites, fallen from heaven. Was it not as well to be civil to such messengers from above?--to testify by homage to them due awe of the being who had thrown them at men, and who though he had missed his shot that time might not miss it the next? I think if we, knowing nothing of either gunpowder, astronomy, or Christianity, saw an Armstrong bolt fall within five miles of London, we should be inclined to be very respectful to it indeed. So the aerolites, or <b>glacial</b> boulders, or <b>polished</b> stone weapons of an extinct race, which looked like aerolites, were the children of Ouranos the heaven, and had souls in them. One, by one of those strange transformations in which the logic of unreason indulges, the image of Diana of the Ephesians, which fell down from Jupiter; another was the Ancile, the holy shield which fell from the same place in the days of Numa Pompilius, and was the guardian genius of Rome; and several more became notable for ages.|$|R
40|$|The author {{carried out}} {{supplementary}} geomorphological field work on East Ongul Island and Rundvagshetta {{area on the}} Soya Coast in 1985 / 1986 summer season. A part of the results is reported here. It has been pointed out since the first expedition in 1956 / 1957 that the glaciated features of East Ongul Island had been formed by the former westward flowing ice sheet (T. YOSHIKAWA and H. TOYA : Nankyoku Shiryo, 1, 1, 1957). However, glaciated landforms {{which might have been}} carved by the former northward flowing ice sheet were found on the sea floor around East Ongul Island (K. MORIWAKI : Nankyoku Shiryo, 54, 101, 1975). The present field work showed that the wastage of perennial snow patch or drift-snow ice on the island progressed remarkably in recent years, and <b>glacial</b> striation and <b>polished</b> surfaces emerged from under the drift-snow ice near the coastline. These features clearly indicate that glaciation by the westward flowing ice sheet was followed by glaciation by the northward flowing ice sheet. Other geomorphic characteristics such as periglacial phenomena and raised beaches were also re-surveyed. The results will be presented on a geomorphological map of the Ongul Islands. In the Rundvagshetta area, glaciated features by the former westward flowing ice sheet develop in many places. The features indicate areal scouring by the wet-based ice sheet. This area has a triangular plane with a side of only 3 km. But it can be divided into two parts; the northern with a less-weathered surface and the southern with a relatively weathered surface. This fact suggests that the ice sheet margin had retreated intermittently from this small ice-free area...|$|R
40|$|Landforms in Val Mulix and the Albula {{region in}} eastern Switzerland offer a {{detailed}} {{insight into the}} period between the Oldest Dryas until the early Holocene. To better understand Lateglacial and Holocene climate change in the central Alps, <b>glacial</b> (moraines, <b>polished</b> bedrock) and periglacial (rock glacier) landforms were dated using a combined approach of numerical (cosmogenic 10 Be) and relative (Schmidt-hammer, weathering rind thickness) dating techniques. At high-elevation sites near the Last Glacial Maximum (LGM) trimline, 10 Be exposure ages of glacially modified bedrock are between 11. 2 ka and 13. 5 ka. This suggests the persistence of long-lasting small local ice caps after {{the breakdown of the}} LGM ice domes or, alternatively, a reformation of ice perhaps during the Younger Dryas. In Val Mulix we obtained one of the first ages for the Daun-stadial (> 14. 7 ka) moraines (14. 9 ± 1. 8 ka), supporting a pre-Bølling chronological position. The age is in excellent agreement with the age of a boulder from an Egesen I moraine located up-valley which we postulate may be a Daun moraine that was re-occupied during the Egesen stadial. A boulder from an Egesen II moraine gave an age of 10. 7 ka, which is similar to ages of Egesen II moraines at other sites in the Alps. 10 Be ages from boulders found on a relict rock glacier in Val Mulix indicate that the main active phase lasted from the Lateglacial until the early Holocene. The derived mean annual flow rate is of the order of decimetres, which is in accordance with values stated in the literature based on measuring active rock glaciers in the Alps. Exposure ages from a glacially polished rock barrier showed that this area was ice-free {{at the end of the}} Younger Dryas (9. 0 ± 0. 7 ka and 11. 9 ± 0. 9 ka). The polished bedrocks are located a few hundred meters down-valley from the Little Ice Age (LIA) moraines. This gives direct evidence of a fast ice retreat towards the end of the Younger Dryas, with glacier length variations that did not exceed the 1850 AD extension (Little Ice Age maximum). Surface exposure dating is, however, limited by several methodological constraints. The choice of suitable snow depths plays a crucial role in the calculation of the 10 Be ages. Shielding of surfaces from cosmic rays by snow can significantly influence the exposure age, and variations in the estimated annual snowfall in the Albula region since the LGM is therefore a potential source of considerable uncertainty in our measurements. While the measurement of weathering rind thicknesses turned out to be an appropriate tool to support the reconstruction of Lateglacial landscape evolution, Schmidt-hammer R-values were less helpful. The R-values enabled a temporal distinction of landforms within the Holocene (LIA moraine, active rock glaciers) but not within the Lateglacial. From a methodological point of view, the different dating methods enabled a cross-checking, an extended interpretation of the data and a more accurate estimate of the possible sources of error...|$|R
