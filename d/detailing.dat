5|$|A {{characteristic}} of Douglas's work is {{his attention to}} both external and internal <b>detailing.</b> Such <b>detailing</b> was not derived from any particular style and Douglas chose elements from whichever style suited his purpose for each specific project. His <b>detailing</b> applied particularly to his joinery, perhaps inspired by his experience in his father's workshop, and was applied both to wooden fittings and to the furniture he designed. A further Continental influence was his use of a Dutch gable. The most important and consistently used element in Douglas's vernacular buildings was his use of half-timbering, which was usually used for parts of the building. However, {{in the cases of}} Rowden Abbey and StMichael and All Angels Church, Altcar, the entire buildings were timber-framed.|$|E
