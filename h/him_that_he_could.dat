5|$|In 1953, Mainer and {{his wife}} settled in Flint, Michigan, where he found work at a General Motors factory. Although renouncing both the music {{industry}} and his trademark instrument, the banjo, he and Julia did continue to sing at gospel revival meetings. In the early 1960s, Molly O'Day convinced <b>him</b> <b>that</b> <b>he</b> <b>could</b> use the banjo in gospel recordings, which spurred a series of religiously themed banjo albums beginning in 1961. He also began to record and tour with his wife.|$|E

5|$|On 6 July 1553, {{at the age}} of 15, Edward VI {{died from}} a lung infection, {{possibly}} tuberculosis. He did not want the crown to go to Mary, because he feared she would restore Catholicism and undo his reforms {{as well as those of}} Henry VIII, and so he planned to exclude her from the line of succession. His advisers, however, told <b>him</b> <b>that</b> <b>he</b> <b>could</b> not disinherit only one of his sisters: He would have to disinherit Elizabeth as well, even though she was a Protestant. Guided by John Dudley, 1st Duke of Northumberland, and perhaps others, Edward excluded both of his sisters from the line of succession in his will.|$|E
5|$|García sent captain Pedro de Zubiaur, {{his senior}} officer, on towards the lake. He arrived at Lake Petén Itza with 60 musketeers, friar San Buenaventura and another Franciscan and allied Yucatec Maya warriors. They were also {{accompanied}} by about 40 Maya porters. On 2 February the expedition {{was approached by}} two Itza warriors who told them of a recent battle between a Guatemalan expedition and the Itza; these two Itzas guided the party to a nearby Itza settlement, and the letter from Avendaño was shown to captain Zubiaur, convincing <b>him</b> <b>that</b> <b>he</b> <b>could</b> advance safely. The port town of Ch'ich' was abandoned but {{a large number of}} canoes approached, judged to be as many as 300 by the Spanish captain, bearing perhaps 2,000 Itza warriors. The warriors began to mingle freely with the Spanish party and began to load the Spanish supplies into the canoes with a promise of transporting the expedition across to Nojpetén, with one soldier in each canoe. The Franciscans readily boarded the canoes, with two soldiers as an escort. A scuffle then broke out; a dozen more of the Spanish party were forced into canoes, and two porters were beaten to death. One of the captured Spanish soldiers was immediately decapitated. At this point the Spanish soldiers opened fire with their muskets, and the Itza retreated across the lake with their prisoners.|$|E

25|$|In {{the fall}} of 1785, Scheele began to suffer from {{symptoms}} described as kidney disease. In early 1786, he also contracted a disease of the skin, which, combined with kidney problems, so enfeebled <b>him</b> <b>that</b> <b>he</b> <b>could</b> foresee an early death. With this in mind, he married the widow of his predecessor, Pohl, two days before he died, {{so that he could}} pass undisputed title to his pharmacy and his possessions to her.|$|E

Although he originally sought only a legal separation from his wife, his research convinced <b>him</b> <b>that</b> <b>he</b> <b>could</b> convince the government to legalise divorce.|$|E
25|$|Robert Jordan credits Wollheim {{for helping}} to launch his (Jordan's) career. Wollheim made an offer for Jordan's first novel, Warriors of the Ataii, though he withdrew the offer when Jordan {{requested}} some {{minor changes to the}} contract. Jordan claims that Wollheim's first, 'laudatory' letter convinced <b>him</b> <b>that</b> <b>he</b> <b>could</b> write, and so he chose to remember the first letter and forget about the second. The novel was never published, but Jordan went on to write the immensely successful Wheel of Time series for a different publisher.|$|E

Almost 50 years later, in February 2009, the San Diego School District officially extended an apology to Seeger for the actions of their predecessors.|$|E
25|$|In 1975 Davis {{travelled}} to Australia {{to compete}} in the World Championship, where he played Dennis Taylor in an ordinary club billiard room in which a large number of one-armed bandits were in constant use. Hampered by such conditions, an unhappy Davis lost by a single frame, 15–14. The 1975 Watney Open in Leeds provided some consolation, and Davis beat Patsy Fagan 13–9 and John Spencer 13–12 before losing 17–11 in the final to Alex Higgins. Davis stated that a win over Spencer convinced <b>him</b> <b>that</b> <b>he</b> <b>could</b> still compete at the highest level of tournament play.|$|E

The police continued their investigation and discovered that on the night of May 1, 1897, the night Louisa disappeared, she was seen entering the factory with her husband at 10:30pm.

After the show, SAC Supian Amat lodged a police report against Patrick under the instruction of Rahim Noor, then the IGP of Malaysia, resulting in Patrick being called to the police station for interviews. The media went to town with this issue; famous local cartoonist Lat drew a satirical cartoon on the incident which was published in the New Straits Times.|$|E
