Its users can experiment at ease over the web with the integrated tools and functionalities, and build own prototypical problem solvers {{on the basis of}} components (tools and transformations) contained in the ETI repository. In this paper we describe the graph concept underlying ETIs flexibility, the significant role played by graphs in the ETI platform, and the kind of support ETI offers to deal with graph objects. This way we sketch the potential of a closer cooperation between the ETI community and the community of research on graph-based tools...|$|R
40|$|The MetaFrame tool <b>integration</b> <b>platform</b> is {{designed}} for the interactive combination and coordination of heterogeneous tools: complex tool combinations can be (semi-) automatically or interactively constructed and tested by on-line `meta-programming' in the interpreted, sequential tool coordination language HLL. The point of our design is the strict separation of a highly enhanced integration phase and a strongly supported coordination phase. This allows even non-experts to profitably coordinate the integrated tools to solve their own application-specific tasks. It is this profile which qualifies our coordination environment {{to serve as the}} <b>Electronic</b> Tool <b>Integration</b> (ETI) <b>platform</b> in the new international Springer Journal Software Tools for Technology Transfer (STTT) ...|$|R

40|$|Using the Coordination Theory, we {{explored}} {{the impact of}} <b>electronic</b> <b>integration</b> of intra-organizational and inter-organizational business processes on organizational performance in terms of logistics cost and service improvements. Our work extends knowledge on adoption of information technology (IT) in logistics operations, {{with a focus on}} examining the performance implications of <b>electronic</b> <b>integration</b> within and between firms in a supply chain. Data was collected from 227 trading firms in Hong Kong and analyzed to investigate the research issues. Our empirical findings revealed that <b>electronic</b> <b>integration</b> is positively associated with logistics performance in cost but not in service, suggesting that <b>electronic</b> <b>integration</b> is not sufficient for delivering superior logistics services.

40|$|<b>Electronic</b> <b>integration</b> [...] -a form of {{vertical}} quasi-integration achieved through {{the deployment of}} dedicated computers and communication systems between relevant actors in the adjacent stages of the value-chain [...] -is an important concept to researchers in the information systems field since it focuses {{on the role of}} information technology in restructuring vertical relationships. Drawing on theoretical and empirical research on transaction costs, we develop and test a model of the determinants of the degree of <b>electronic</b> <b>integration</b> in the commercial segment of the property and casualty (P&C) industry. Based on a sample of 120 independent agencies operating under dedicated information technology-mediated conditions, we provide empirical support for three hypotheses on the determinants of <b>electronic</b> <b>integration.</b> Implications and research extensions are identified to guide further research in this important area. information technology, vertical <b>integration,</b> <b>electronic</b> <b>integration,</b> interorganizational systems, organizational economics, transaction cost model, insurance industry, commercial lines...|$|R

This study elaborates {{on the concept of}} <b>electronic</b> <b>integration.</b> Studies on integration in general and <b>electronic</b> <b>integration</b> in particular adopt a loose definition of integration: they all agree in that integration is the opposite of markets, but they define this opposite in different terms: relationship contracting, long-term contracting, coordination, etc. Finally, the study also responds to Wathne and Heide’s (2004) call for a more comprehensive study of governance mechanisms in B 2 B, with emphasis on monitoring mechanisms...|$|R

40|$|A new {{application}} <b>integration</b> <b>platform</b> for an agile manufacturing environment is presented, {{which is based}} on agent and common request broker architecture (CORBA). CORBA enhances the system integration because it is an industry-standard for interoperable, distributed objects across heterogeneous hardware and software platforms. Agent technology is used to improve the intelligence of the <b>integration</b> system. The <b>platform</b> is open, distributed, and modular to enable the user to adapt its content to his requirements. This application <b>integration</b> <b>platform</b> supports the goals of agile manufacturing: rapid response to changing requirements, reduction in both time and cost of the product realisation process, and integration within a heterogeneous, wide-area-networked enterprise. In order to implement the application <b>integration</b> <b>platform,</b> we use a network integration server to integrate the network, design a generic database agent to integrate database, adopt a multi-agent based architecture to integrate application, and utilise a wrapper as a CORBA object to integrate the legacy code. Finally, a prototype framework is presented. link_to_subscribed_fulltex...|$|R
40|$|Our goal is {{to assess}} the {{strategic}} and operational benefits of <b>electronic</b> <b>integration</b> for industrial procurement. We conduct a field study with an industrial supplier and examine the drivers of performance of the procurement process. Our research quantifies both the operational and strategic impacts of <b>electronic</b> <b>integration</b> in a B 2 B procurement environment for a supplier. Additionally, we show that the customer also obtains substantial benefits from efficient procurement transaction processing. We isolate the performance impact of technology choice and ordering processes on both the trading partners. A significant finding is that the supplier derives large strategic benefits when the customer initiates the system and the supplier enhances the system's capabilities. With respect to operational benefits, we find that when suppliers have advanced electronic linkages, the order-processing system significantly increases benefits to both parties. business value of IT, empirical assessment, <b>electronic</b> <b>integration,</b> <b>electronic</b> procurement, B 2 B, strategic IT impact, operational IT impact...|$|R
