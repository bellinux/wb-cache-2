40|$|It is a {{challenge}} to retain the high stretchability of an elastomer when used in polymer composites. Likewise, the high conductivity of organic conductors is typically compromised when used as filler in composite systems. Here, it is possible to achieve <b>elastomeric</b> <b>fiber</b> composites with high electrical conductivity at relatively low loading of the conductor and, more importantly, to attain mechanical properties that are useful in strain-sensing applications. The preparation of homogenous composite formulations from polyurethane (PU) and poly(3, 4 -ethylenedioxythiophene) :poly(styrenesulfonate) (PEDOT:PSS) that are also processable by fiber wet-spinning techniques are systematically evaluated. With increasing PEDOT:PSS loading in the fiber composites, the Young 2 ̆ 7 s modulus increases exponentially and the yield stress increases linearly. A model describing the effects of the reversible and irreversible deformations {{as a result of the}} re-arrangement of PEDOT:PSS filler networks within PU and how this relates to the electromechanical properties of the fibers during the tensile and cyclic stretching is presented. Conducting elastomeric fibers based on a composite of polyurethane (PU) and PEDOT:PSS, produced by a wet-spinning method, have high electrical conductivity and stretchability. These fibers can sense large strains by changes in resistance. The PU/PEDOT:PSS fiber is optimized to achieve the best strain sensing. PU/PEDOT:PSS fibers can be produced on a large scale and integrated into conventional textiles by weaving or knitting. © 2014 WILEY-VCH Verlag GmbH & Co. KGaA, Weinheim...|$|E

40|$|AbstractBioinspired by the {{spinning}} of spider silks, the biomimetic preparation of <b>elastomeric</b> <b>fibers</b> with micro/nano structures on the surfaces was attempted, {{and as a}} result, three types of ultrafine full-vulcanized powdered nitrile-butadiene rubber (UFPNBR) /thermoplastic polyurethane (TPU) fibers were made. The first fiber was only decorated by the micron-sized grooves on the surface, and the second fiber was dotted by both the micron-sized grooves and nanometer-sized spheres on the surface, while the third fiber was helical and with a concave–convex surface. The biomimetic preparation mainly consisted of four steps, and the formation mechanism was described as an integrated mechanism of diffusion, coagulation, self assembly, and microphase separation. The micro/nano structures on the fibers were controlled by changing the mass ratio of UFPNBR to TPU and environment of vertical stretching. The UFPNBR/TPU <b>elastomeric</b> <b>fibers</b> were hoped to have an integrated function of superhydrophobicity, self cleaning, and mechanical improvement of toughness or strength...|$|R
40|$|A simple fiber {{spinning}} method used to fabricate <b>elastomeric</b> composite <b>fibers</b> with outstanding mechanical performance is demonstrated. By {{taking advantage of}} the large size of as-prepared graphene oxide sheets (in the order of tens of micrometers) and their liquid crystalline behavior, <b>elastomeric</b> composite <b>fibers</b> with outstanding low strain properties have been fabricated without compromising their high strain properties. For example, the modulus and yield stress of the parent elastomer improved by 80 - and 40 -fold, respectively, while maintaining the high extensibility of ∼ 400 % strain inherent to the parent elastomer. This outstanding mechanical performance was shown to be dependent upon the GO sheet size. Insights into how both the GO sheet size dimension and dispersion parameters influence the mechanical behavior at various applied strains are discussed...|$|R

40|$|AbstractBioinspired by the {{spinning}} of spider silks, the biomimetic preparation of nano-silica/polyurethane (nano-SiO 2 /TPU) <b>elastomeric</b> <b>fibers</b> with distinctive multi-scale microstructures was successfully implemented. The formation {{mechanism of the}} nano-SiO 2 /TPU fibers was considered as the integrated mechanism of diffusion, coagulation, self-assembly, and microphase separation, {{same as that of}} the native spider silks. The mass ratio of nano-SiO 2 to TPU greatly influenced the external and inner microstructures of the nano-SiO 2 /TPU fibers. The formation process of the nano-SiO 2 /TPU fibers was simply described as three main stages, and the second stage, such as the adding of the ethanol solvents and nano-SiO 2 in different diameters, was thought to be very crucial for the final external and inner microstructures of the prepared fibers. For example, the adding of the ethanol and the nano-SiO 2 spheres in diameter of 10 nm resulted in the existence of many TPU-self-assembled microspheres mostly spaced apart by the nano-SiO 2 aggregates in the nano-SiO 2 /TPU fibers, while the adding of the ethanol and the nano-SiO 2 spheres in diameter of 100 nm resulted in the existence of the nano-SiO 2 spheres, instead of the TPU-self-assembled microspheres, distributed in the nano-SiO 2 /TPU fibers...|$|R
40|$|An {{important}} {{class of}} biomaterials {{is composed of}} layered networks of <b>elastomeric</b> <b>fibers.</b> While {{there is a growing}} interest in modeling and simulation of the mechanical response of these biomaterials, a theoretical foundation for such simulations has yet to be firmly established. The present work addresses this issue in two ways. First, using methods of geometric probability we develop theoretical estimates for the linear and areal fiber intersection densities for two-dimensional fibrous networks. These are expressed in terms of the fiber density and orientation distribution function, both of which are relatively easy to measure properties. Secondly, we develop a random walk algorithm for geometric simulation of two-dimensional fibrous networks which can accurately reproduce prescribed fiber density and orientation distribution function. Furthermore, the linear and areal fiber intersection densities obtained with the algorithm are in agreement with the theoretical estimates. Both theoretical and computational results are compared with those obtained by post-processing of SEM images of actual scaffolds. These comparisons reveal difficulties inherent to resolving fine details of multilayered fibrous networks. We also note that one should think not in terms of sufficiently large specimens for analysis, but rather sufficiently fiber-filled specimens. Correctly identifying and matching key geometric features is a critically important first step for performing reliable mechanical simulations. The methods provided herein can provide a rational means to define and generate key geometric features from scaffold structural data...|$|R

40|$|Recent {{advances}} in wearable electronics, technical textiles, and wearable strain sensing devices {{have resulted in}} extensive research on stretchable electrically conductive fibers. Addressing these areas require the development of efficient fiber processing methodologies that do not compromise the mechanical properties of the polymer (typically an elastomer) when nanomaterials are added as conductive fillers. It is highly desirable that the addition of conductive fillers provides not only electrical conductivity, but that these fillers also enhance the stiffness, strength, stretchability, and toughness of the polymer.

40|$|Three {{dimensional}} scaffolds play {{an important}} role in tissue engineering as a matrix that provides the cells with a tissue specific environment and architecture. For cardiovascular applications in particular, the development of elastic scaffolds that can maintain their mechanical integrity while being exposed to cyclic mechanical strains is a necessary criterion. The main objective of this study was to demonstrate the feasibility of fabricating vascular tissue engineering scaffolds via two different approaches, namely; melt spinning and electrospinning. Small diameter tubes were fabricated from two different molecular weights of elastomeric biodegradable poly(L-lactide-co-ε-caprolactone) (PLCL) copolymers. Firstly, 6 mm length tubular constructs with the inner diameter of 3 / 16 inch were produced via melt spinning, and secondly, nanofibrous scaffolds with the inner diameters of 1 / 8 inch and 3 / 16 inch were produced via electrospinning. The melt spun tubes produced from the higher molecular weight copolymer contained fibers measuring 253 ± 36 μm in diameter, had a porosity of 76. 2 %, transverse tensile strength of 26. 1 ± 1. 3 MPa, transverse tensile peak strain of 578 ± 17 %, and initial transverse tensile elastic modulus of 23. 5 ± 0. 9 MPa. In comparison the electrospun tubes contained nanofibers measuring 540 ± 190 nm in diameter, had a porosity of 83. 6 %, average pore size of 2. 08 ± 1. 61 μm 2. The initial modulus of these 3 / 16 inch diameter nanofibrous scaffolds (24. 6 ± 1. 9 MPa) was similar to that of the melt spun tubes. However, the peak transverse tensile strength was lower at 17. 8 ± 2. 0 MPa and the peak strain was only 142 %. Overall, the mechanical properties of the produced tubes exceeded the transverse tensile values of natural arteries of similar caliber. This is the first report that PLCL copolymers can be melt spun into <b>elastomeric</b> <b>fibers.</b> In addition to spinning the polymer separately into melt spun and electrospun constructs, the novel approach in this study has been to successfully demonstrate that these two techniques can be combined to produce two layered tubular scaffolds containing both melt spun fibers (10 - 200 µm in diameter) and electrospun nanofibers (400 nm- 2 µm in diameter).

40|$|Scaffolds for {{engineering}} soft tissue would ideally be mechanically compliant and anisotropic while possessing inherent bioactivity and enzyme sensitivity {{similar to the}} native extracellular matrix. Biodegradable elastomers, such as cytocompatible poly(ester urethane) ureas, represent attractive alternatives to more common biodegradable polyesters utilized in tissue engineering. These materials can be processed by electrospinning into scaffolds suitable for in vivo placement and support of cellular adhesion and growth. This process, where an electric field overcomes surface tension to generate and draw nanoscale fibers, can create scaffolds with extracellular matrix-like morphologies that retain mechanical strength and flexibility while also permitting protein incorporation into spun fibers to impart bioactivity. Poly(ester urethane) urea (PEUU) was blended with collagen or urinary bladder matrix and processed with electrospinning into nanofibrous scaffolds. Protein incorporation into the matrices resulted in increased cellular adhesion and scaffold degradation rate. PEUU scaffolds were fabricated with various degrees of fiber alignment to more closely mimic soft tissue anisotropy {{such as that of}} the native pulmonary valve. The fabrication of mechanically anisotropic scaffolds is desired due to their ability to direct cell growth during tissue remodeling. PEUU elastomeric matrices could serve as mechanical support scaffolds for cell adhesion and growth but can require long seeding and culture times to achieve high density cellular in-growth. Therefore, a microintegration technique was developed where the <b>elastomeric</b> <b>fibers</b> are spun concurrently with electrospraying of cells. This process produced viable, high cell density constructs and lessened the time necessary for scaffold fabrication and seeding. The functionality of electrospun PEUU was evaluated for its ability to release bioactive basic fibroblast growth factor or the antibiotic tetracycline. These controlled release elastomeric matrices might be appropriate for application in wound repair or management. Electrospun PEUU was also evaluated in fabricating a functional tissue engineered blood vessel. Small diameter electrospun PEUU tubular conduits were implanted as rat aorta replacements and demonstrated patency and tissue remodeling at 2 wks. In addition, the cellular microintegration technology was extended as a means to incorporate cells into electrospun small diameter tubes in vitro. These materials possessed mechanical compliance similar to native vessels and demonstrated great potential for tissue engineering...|$|R

40|$|The {{aim of this}} {{dissertation}} was {{to investigate}} flexible polymer-nanoparticle composites with unique magnetic and electrical properties. Toward this goal, two distinct projects were carried out. The first project explored the magneto-dielectric properties and morphology of flexible polymer-nanoparticle composites that possess high permeability (µ), high permittivity (ε) and minimal dielectric, and magnetic loss (tan δε, tan δµ). The main materials challenges were the synthesis of magnetic nanoparticle fillers displaying high saturation magnetization (Ms), limited coercivity, and their homogeneous dispersion in a polymeric matrix. Nanostructured magnetic fillers including polycrystalline iron core-shell nanoparticles, and constructively assembled superparamagnetic iron oxide nanoparticles were synthesized, and dispersed uniformly in an elastomer matrix to minimize conductive losses. The resulting composites have demonstrated promising permittivity (22. 3), permeability (3), and sustained low dielectric (0. 1), magnetic (0. 4) loss for frequencies below 2 GHz. This study demonstrated nanocomposites with tunable magnetic resonance frequency, {{which can be used}} to develop compact and flexible radio frequency devices with high efficiency. The second project focused on fundamental research regarding methods for the design of highly conductive polymer-nanoparticle composites that can maintain high electrical conductivity under tensile strain exceeding 100 %. We investigated a simple solution spraying method to fabricate stretchable conductors based on <b>elastomeric</b> block copolymer <b>fibers</b> and silver nanoparticles.

The developed manufacturing method in this research could pave the way towards direct deposition of flexible electronic devices on any shaped substrate. The electrical and electromechanical properties of these dual silver nanoparticle network composites make them promising materials for the future construction of stretchable circuitry for displays, solar cells, antennas, and strain and tactility sensors...|$|R
