His botanical work was interpreted and popularised by various writers including Grant Allen and H. G. Wells, and [...] in the late C19 and early C20.

60|$|I {{have now}} (May 1, 1881) {{sent to the}} {{printers}} the MS. of a little book on 'The Formation <b>of</b> <b>Vegetable</b> <b>Mould,</b> through the Action of Worms.' This is a subject of but small importance; and I know not whether it will interest any readers (Between November 1881 and February 1884, 8500 copies have been sold.), but it has interested me. It is {{the completion of a}} short paper read before the Geological Society more than forty years ago, and has revived old geological thoughts.|$|R
5000|$|Charles Darwin was {{interested}} in worms and [...] "how far they acted consciously, and how much mental power they displayed." [...] In The Formation <b>of</b> <b>Vegetable</b> <b>Mould</b> through the Action of Worms, Darwin described complex behaviors by worms when plugging their burrows. He suggested that worms appear to [...] "have the power of acquiring some notion, however rude, of {{the shape of an}} object and of their burrows" [...] and if so, [...] "they deserve to be called intelligent; for they then act in nearly the same manner as would a man under similar circumstances." ...|$|R
60|$|It was in 1881 that Darwin {{published}} his last volume, 'The Formation <b>of</b> <b>Vegetable</b> <b>Mould</b> through the Action of Worms.' In this singularly fascinating and interesting monograph {{he took in}} hand one of the lowliest and humblest of living forms, the common earthworm, and by an exhaustive study of its habits and manners strove {{to show how the}} entire existence <b>of</b> <b>vegetable</b> mould--the ordinary covering of fertile soil upon the face of the earth--is due to the long but unobtrusive action of these little-noticed and ever-active architects. By the acids which they evolve, they appear to aid largely in the disintegration of the stone beneath the surface; by their constant practice of eating fallen leaves, which they drag down with them into their subterranean burrows, they produce the fine castings of soft earth, so familiar to everybody, and thus reinstate the coating of humus above the bare rock as often as it is washed away again in the course of ordinary denudation by the rain and the torrents. It is true that subsequent investigation has shown the possibility <b>of</b> <b>vegetable</b> <b>mould</b> existing under certain conditions without the intervention of worms to any marked extent; but, as a whole, {{there can be little doubt}} that over most parts of the world the presence of soil, and therefore <b>of</b> the <b>vegetable</b> growth rooted in it, is entirely due to the unsuspected yet ceaseless activity of these humble creatures.|$|R
50|$|Bioturbation's {{importance}} for soil processes and geomorphology was ﬁrst realised by Charles Darwin, who devoted his last scientiﬁc {{book to the}} subject (The Formation <b>of</b> <b>Vegetable</b> <b>Mould</b> through the Action of Worms, 1881). Modern research has provided further insight into the evolutionary and ecological role of bioturbation. In modern ecological theory, bioturbation is recognised as an archetypal example of 'ecosystem engineering', modifying geochemical gradients, redistributing food resources, viruses, bacteria, resting stages and eggs. From an evolutionary perspective, recent investigations provide evidence that bioturbation had {{a key role in}} the evolution of metazoan life at the end of the Precambrian Era.|$|R
50|$|The Power of Movement in Plants {{is a book}} by Charles Darwin on {{phototropism}} {{and other}} types of movement in plants. This book continues his work in producing evidence for his theory of natural selection. As it was one of his last books, followed only by the publication of The Formation <b>of</b> <b>Vegetable</b> <b>Mould</b> through the Action of Worms, he was assisted by his son Francis in conducting the necessary experiments and preparing the manuscript. The Power of Movement in Plants was published 6 November 1880, and 1500 copies were quickly sold by publisher John Murray.|$|R
5000|$|Before Easter he {{sent off}} his {{manuscript}} for The Formation <b>of</b> <b>Vegetable</b> <b>Mould</b> through the Action of Worms, and {{found he had}} no [...] "heart or strength... to begin any investigation lasting for years". [...] "Never happy except when at work", {{he was at a}} loose end until he remembered his autobiography. On 22 April 1881, exactly 30 years after Annie's burial, he re-read the passages about her and Emma's letter of that time, and added a note under his daguerreotype of Annie, [...] "When I am dead, know that many times, I have kissed & cryed over this." [...] sic.|$|R
6000|$|In {{the year}} 1869, Mr. Fish {5} {{rejected}} my conclusions {{with respect to}} the part which worms have played in the formation <b>of</b> <b>vegetable</b> <b>mould,</b> merely on account of their assumed incapacity to do so much work. He remarks that [...] "considering their weakness and their size, the work they are represented to have accomplished is stupendous." [...] Here we have an instance of that inability to sum up the effects of a continually recurrent cause, which has often retarded the progress of science, as formerly in the case of geology, and more recently in that of the principle of evolution.|$|R
50|$|The Formation <b>of</b> <b>Vegetable</b> <b>Mould</b> {{through the}} Action of Worms, with Observations on their Habits (sometimes {{shortened}} to Worms) is an 1881 book by Charles Darwin on earthworms. It {{was his last}} scientific book, and was published {{shortly before his death}} (see Darwin from Insectivorous Plants to Worms). Exploring earthworm behaviour and ecology, it continued the theme common throughout his work that gradual changes {{over long periods of time}} can lead to large and sometimes surprising consequences. It was the first significant work on soil bioturbation, although that term was not used by Darwin (it first appeared in the soil and geomorphic literature one hundred years later).|$|R

5000|$|These {{writings}} {{contributed to}} Darwin's pursuit {{of evidence that}} would support his theory of natural selection. There were only two more books to follow: The Power of Movement in Plants (1880) and The Formation <b>of</b> <b>Vegetable</b> <b>Mould</b> through the Action of Worms (1881). He conducted {{a wide range of}} experiments and observations and the results of these form the framework of the book. He was assisted in this work by his son, Francis Darwin who also wrote a preface for the second edition which was published two years after his father's death in 1882. The book was dedicated to his longtime friend and colleague, Harvard botany professor Asa Gray [...] "as a small tribute of respect and affection".|$|R

40|$|This {{bachelor}} thesis {{focuses on}} Charles Darwin's The Formation <b>of</b> <b>Vegetable</b> <b>Mould</b> through the Action of Worms, with Observations on their Habits {{and its impact}} on contemporary science. Descriptive parts and sections about morphology have been frequently mentioned in the literature, however, most often as a historical curiosity. Major immediate impact and lasting interest was sparked by thoughts about the behavior of earthworms. Ideas about mixing of soil by worms instigated the publication of scholarly papers analyzing the <b>distribution</b> <b>of</b> earthworms and the importance of soil mixing for archaeology. Ideas related to the impact of mixing on soil formation and its fertility received much less attention. Hypotheses about the impact of bioturbation on landscape level were largely ignored, only to be rediscovered and further explored {{at the end of the}} last century and the beginning of the current one...|$|R
5|$|Darwin was a {{prolific}} writer. Even without {{publication of his}} works on evolution, {{he would have had}} a considerable reputation as the author of The Voyage of the Beagle, as a geologist who had published extensively on South America and had solved the puzzle of the formation of coral atolls, and as a biologist who had published the definitive work on barnacles. While On the Origin of Species dominates perceptions of his work, The Descent of Man and The Expression of the Emotions in Man and Animals had considerable impact, and his books on plants including The Power of Movement in Plants were innovative studies of great importance, as was his final work on The Formation <b>of</b> <b>Vegetable</b> <b>Mould</b> through the Action of Worms.|$|R
50|$|Charles Darwin's book The Formation <b>of</b> <b>Vegetable</b> <b>Mould</b> {{through the}} Action of Worms (1881) {{presented}} the first scientific analysis of earthworms' contributions to soil fertility. Some burrow while others live {{entirely on the}} surface, generally in moist leaf litter. The burrowers loosen the soil so that oxygen and water can penetrate it, and both surface and burrowing worms help to produce soil by mixing organic and mineral matter, by accelerating the decomposition of organic matter and thus making it more quickly available to other organisms, and by concentrating minerals and converting them to forms that plants can use more easily. Earthworms are also important prey for birds {{ranging in size from}} robins to storks, and for mammals ranging from shrews to badgers, and in some cases conserving earthworms may be essential for conserving endangered birds.|$|R
2500|$|Sambourne's {{caricature}} {{deals in}} a playful manner with the topics [...] "evolution" [...] and [...] "descent of man." [...] The title alludes to {{a publication of}} Darwin entitled The Formation <b>of</b> <b>Vegetable</b> <b>Mould</b> through the Action of Worms, with Observations of their Habits which was issued in October 1881. In the caricature, evolution is associated with metamorphosis and portrayed as a gradual process which inevitably leads to advancement. This, however, conveys a reduced if not false picture of Darwin's theory in which competition, hereditary transmission, coincidence and selection play a major role. Besides, these circular images of evolutionary progression form a striking contrast to Darwin’s own linear and branching evolutionary trees. In The Origin of Species Darwin [...] "took pains to emphasize that evolution was neither progressive nor circular." ...|$|R
60|$|If {{it could}} be shown that worms {{generally}} excavate their burrows {{at right angles to}} an inclined surface, and this would be their shortest course for bringing up earth from beneath, then as the old burrows collapsed from the weight of the superincumbent soil, the collapsing would inevitably cause the whole bed <b>of</b> <b>vegetable</b> <b>mould</b> to sink or slide slowly down the inclined surface. But to ascertain the direction of many burrows was found too difficult and troublesome. A straight piece of wire was, however, pushed into twenty-five burrows on several sloping fields, and in eight cases the burrows were nearly at right angles to the slope; whilst in the remaining cases they were indifferently directed at various angles, either upwards or downwards with respect to the slope.|$|R
5|$|Puzzled by the {{geographical}} <b>distribution</b> <b>of</b> wildlife and fossils he {{collected on the}} voyage, Darwin began detailed investigations and in 1838 conceived his theory of natural selection. Although he discussed his ideas with several naturalists, he needed time for extensive research and his geological work had priority. He was writing up his theory in 1858 when Alfred Russel Wallace sent him an essay that described the same idea, prompting immediate joint publication of both of their theories. Darwin's work established evolutionary descent with modification as the dominant scientific explanation of diversification in nature. In 1871 he examined human evolution and sexual selection in The Descent of Man, and Selection in Relation to Sex, followed by The Expression of the Emotions in Man and Animals (1872). His research on plants was published {{in a series of}} books, and in his final book, The Formation <b>of</b> <b>Vegetable</b> <b>Mould,</b> through the Actions of Worms (1881), he examined earthworms and their effect on soil.|$|R
50|$|William Cunnington was {{the next}} to tackle {{the area in the}} early nineteenth century. He {{excavated}} some 24 barrows before digging in and around the stones and discovered charred wood, animal bones, pottery and urns. He also identified the hole in which the Slaughter Stone once stood. Richard Colt Hoare supported Cunnington's work and excavated some 379 barrows on Salisbury Plain including on some 200 in the area around the Stones, some excavated in conjunction with William Coxe. To alert future diggers to their work they were careful to leave initialled metal tokens in each barrow they opened. Cunnington's finds are displayed at the Wiltshire Museum. In 1877 Charles Darwin dabbled in archaeology at the stones, experimenting with the rate at which remains sink into the earth for his book The Formation <b>of</b> <b>Vegetable</b> <b>Mould</b> Through the Action of Worms.|$|R
50|$|Worms have {{preserved}} many ancient objects {{under the}} ground. Darwin describes an ancient Roman villa in Abinger, Surrey. Worms have penetrated the concrete walls and even mortar. Similar subsidence occurred at Beaulieu Abbey, Hampshire, with worms penetrating {{gaps between the}} tiles. His sons Francis and Horace visited Chedworth Roman Villa in Gloucestershire, while William reported on Brading Roman Villa, Isle of Wight. Darwin goes into some detail on the well preserved ruins of Silchester Roman Town, Hampshire, {{with the help of}} the Rev. J. G. Joyce. Finally he discusses the case of the Viroconium Roman town ruins at Wroxeter, Shropshire, with the help of Dr. H. Johnson, who made observations including depth <b>of</b> <b>vegetable</b> <b>mould.</b> He concludes that both worms and other causes, such as dust deposition and washing down of soil, have buried such ruins.|$|R
40|$|WOS: 000186022300003 International audienceIn 1881, Darwin (1809 - 1882) {{published}} his last scientific book entitled "The formation <b>of</b> <b>vegetable</b> <b>mould</b> through {{the action of}} worms with observations on their habits", the result of several decades of detailed observations and measurements on earthworms and the natural sciences. The work was considered a "best-seller" at the time, with 3500 copies sold immediately and 8500 in less than 3 years which, at the time, rivaled the sale of his most well known book "On the origin of species". The book covers the importance of earthworm activity {{on a variety of}} topics: pedogenesis and weathering processes, soil horizon differentiation and the formation <b>of</b> <b>vegetable</b> <b>mould</b> (topsoil), the role of earthworm burrowing and casting (bioturbation) in soil fertility and plant growth, the burial of organic materials and soil enrichment with mineral elements, the global cycle of erosion-sedimentation with hydrologic and aerial transfers of fine particles brought up to the soil surface by earthworms and the protection of archaeological remains through their burial. Finally, Darwin also performed a series of original experiments to determine if earthworms possessed, or not, a certain "intelligence". This part of the book was, among others, {{one of the main reasons}} for its success. In this article we analyze the success (past and present) of this book, Darwin's own opinion of his book and the general contents of the work. Throughout, we discuss the main lessons to be learned from his 'little' (as he called it) book and provide brief historic reviews of major literary works on earthworms, both contemporary and posterior to Darwin, emphasizing his role as precursor and/or founder of various scientific disciplines (ethology, soil ecology and pedology). However, despite Darwin's clear demonstrations of the importance of biological activities (earthworms) in the maintenance of soil fertility, his book on worms has been mostly neglected by agronomists and soil scientists, primarily due to the predominant soil fertility and management paradigms of the 19 th and 20 th centuries.

6000|$|The {{amount of}} fine earth {{brought to the}} surface under the form of castings, and {{afterwards}} transported by the winds accompanied by rain, or that which flows and rolls down an inclined surface, no doubt is small {{in the course of}} a few scores of years; for otherwise all the inequalities in our pasture fields would be smoothed within a much shorter period than appears to be the case. [...] But the amount which is thus transported in the course of thousands of years cannot fail to be considerable and deserves attention. E. de Beaumont looks at the <b>vegetable</b> <b>mould</b> which everywhere covers the land as a fixed line, from which the amount of denudation may be measured. {79} He ignores the continued formation of fresh mould by the disintegration of the underlying rocks and fragments of rock; and it is curious to find how much more philosophical were the views maintained long ago, by Playfair, who, in 1802, wrote, [...] "In the permanence of a coat <b>of</b> <b>vegetable</b> <b>mould</b> on the surface of the earth, we have a demonstrative proof of the continued destruction of the rocks."

5000|$|The {{earliest}} work {{related to}} biogeomorphology was Charles Darwin's 1881 book titled The Formation <b>of</b> <b>Vegetable</b> <b>Mould,</b> Through the Action of Worms, with Observations on their Habits. [...] Although {{the field of}} biogeomorphology hadn't yet been named, Darwin's work represents the earliest examination of a faunal organism influencing landscape process and form. [...] Charles Darwin begins his work on worms with an examination of behavior and physiology, which then moves towards topics related to geomorphology, pedogenesis, and bioturbation. [...] Observations and measurements of soil moved by earthworms, and emphasis {{on the role of}} earthworms in formation of humus, fertility of soils, and mixing of soils were all described in the book, which began to change the perspective on earthworms from pest to critical agent of pedogenesis. [...] Despite the popularity of Darwin's final work, the scientific community was slow to recognize the significance of examining the role of organisms in influencing landscapes.|$|R
40|$|Down House was Charles Darwin's {{home from}} 1842 {{until his death}} in 1882 and where he wrote “The Formation <b>of</b> <b>Vegetable</b> <b>Mould</b> through the Action of Worms”. The work {{described}} here is based upon passages from this book and from further observations on earthworms in this area. General observations were made in addition to systematic sampling in areas selected either from signs of earthworm activity, habitat type or in direct relation to Darwin's documented work. Greatest species richness (n = 9) was found in Middle Field. Greatest earthworm density was present in Darwin's Kitchen Garden (715 m− 2) with the largest associated biomass (261 g m− 2). Aporrectodea longa was the most abundant species. Lumbricus terrestris, described by Darwin in terms of its behaviour, but not directly named, was located in relatively low numbers, but its diagnostic middens and associated burrows were easily detected. Earthworms associated with Darwin's cinder and chalk application experiments were also examined. In total, 19 of Britain's 28 earthworm species were located within the nominated World Heritage Site...|$|R
