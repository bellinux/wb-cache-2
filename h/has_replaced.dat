5|$|Since the Hindenburg {{disaster}} in 1937, helium <b>has</b> <b>replaced</b> hydrogen as a lifting gas in blimps and balloons {{due to its}} lightness and incombustibility, despite an 8.6% decrease in buoyancy.|$|E
5|$|Oddfellows is {{the fourth}} studio album by musical {{supergroup}} Tomahawk. The album {{is the first to}} feature new bass player Trevor Dunn, who <b>has</b> <b>replaced</b> previous member Kevin Rutmanis. Oddfellows was recorded live in the Easy Eye Sound Studio in Nashville, Tennessee, after a brief period of rehearsal. Guitarist Duane Denison favored the location as its cheaper studio costs allowed for longer periods of song-writing.|$|E
5|$|Since 2009, VR {{has been}} {{repainting}} its fleet in new colours {{according to its}} changed visual identity. Green colour <b>has</b> <b>replaced</b> red, and each car now has two green parallelograms instead of one larger figure between carriages. Artwork showcasing Finnish nature decorates them. , Sm3 units 7x01 to 7x04, 7x06 to 7x10 and 7x12 have been repainted in the new livery.|$|E

50|$|There is {{a church}} in the village {{dedicated}} to St Margaret built in 1897. This <b>had</b> <b>replaced</b> a 1732 building that itself <b>had</b> <b>replaced</b> the earlier medieval church. The church is Grade II listed building.|$|R
5|$|Although {{machinery}} <b>has</b> <b>replaced</b> {{horses in}} many parts of the world, an estimated 100million horses, donkeys and mules are still used for agriculture and transportation in less developed areas. This number includes around 27million working animals in Africa alone. Some land management practices such as cultivating and logging can be efficiently performed with horses. In agriculture, less fossil fuel is used and increased environmental conservation occurs over time with the use of draft animals such as horses. Logging with horses can result in reduced damage to soil structure and less damage to trees due to more selective logging.|$|E
5|$|At the convention, Hoffman <b>has</b> <b>replaced</b> {{the heating}} {{elements}} for the chafing-dishes with his own. Olivia and Peter struggle with locating Hoffman before Walter and Astrid (Jasika Nicole) arrive. Walter uses a fogger to distribute his own chemical agent, this time specific to Hoffman, {{and soon the}} man is found dying. As the team regroups, Walter fully admits to killing Hoffman, a crime in itself, but Broyles (Lance Reddick) decides to let Walter go. Later, Peter {{has been able to}} recover the rest of his grandfather's work and returns it to Walter; Walter then goes through the files, finding an old photo of his father and Hoffman working together.|$|E
5|$|Improving {{opportunities}} for growing families of same-sex couples has shaped {{the political landscape}} within the past ten years. A push for same-sex marriage or civil unions in western countries <b>has</b> <b>replaced</b> other political objectives. , ten countries and six U.S. states offer same-sex marriage; civil unions are offered as an option in some European countries, U.S. states and individual municipalities. The ability to adopt domestically or internationally children or provide a home as a foster parent is also a political and family priority for many lesbians, as is improving access to artificial insemination.|$|E

5|$|In the aye-aye, which <b>has</b> <b>replaced</b> the toothcomb by {{evolving}} continually growing, rodent-like incisors, the hook-shaped {{tip of the}} sublingua fits precisely {{within the}} gap between the two lower incisors and keeps the area clean. Tarsiers lack a toothcomb, which may explain why their sublingua lacks the serrations typically found on the sublingua of lemuriforms. Although colugos also have a toothcomb, consisting of serrated edges on the tips of their incisors instead of finely spaced, elongated teeth, {{they do not have a}} sublingua. Instead, their toothcomb is cleaned by the tongue, which has serrated edges at the front that match the serrations on the incisors.|$|E
5|$|Mutambara, a {{robotics}} {{professor and}} former NASA robotics specialist <b>has</b> <b>replaced</b> Welshman Ncube {{who was the}} interim leader of MDC-M after the split. Morgan Tsvangirai {{did not participate in}} the Senate elections, while the Mutambara faction participated and won five seats in the Senate. The Mutambara formation has been weakened by defections from MPs and individuals who are disillusioned by their manifesto. , the Movement for Democratic Change has become the most popular, with crowds as large as 20,000 attending their rallies as compared to between 500–5,000 for the other formation.|$|E
5|$|Prior to 2007, the {{aircraft}} had been marketed under the designation EH101. The original designation was EHI 01 but a transcription error of a handwritten note changed this to EH101 and the designation stuck. In 2000, Westland Helicopters and Agusta merged to form AgustaWestland, {{leading to the}} type's redesignation as AW101. The type first flew in 1987, and entered into service in 1999. Since the AW101's introduction, it <b>has</b> <b>replaced</b> several older helicopter types, such as the Sea King, performing roles such as medium-sized transport, anti-submarine warfare, and ship-based utility operations.|$|E

Cardiff RFC continued as before to play at Cardiff Arms Park rugby ground, which <b>had</b> <b>replaced</b> the cricket ground in 1969.|$|R
5|$|SpongeBob SquarePants {{appears at}} the Mall of America's Nickelodeon theme park re-branded from the Mall of America's Park at MOA, {{formerly}} Camp Snoopy, to Nickelodeon Universe in the Minneapolis-St. Paul suburb of Bloomington, Minnesota. The new theme park features a SpongeBob-themed Gerstlauer Euro-Fighter custom roller coaster, the SpongeBob SquarePants Rock Bottom Plunge, which <b>has</b> <b>replaced</b> the Mystery Mine Ride and Olde Time Photo store on {{the west end of}} the theme park, which opened March 15, 2008.|$|E
5|$|The GR1A and GR4A were {{equipped}} with TIRRS (Tornado Infrared Reconnaissance System), consisting of one SLIR (Sideways Looking Infra Red) sensor {{on each side}} of the fuselage forward of the engine intakes to capture oblique images, and a single IRLS (InfrarRed LineScan) sensor mounted on the fuselage's underside to provide vertical images. TIRRS recorded images on six S-VHS video tapes. The newer RAPTOR reconnaissance pod <b>has</b> <b>replaced</b> the built-in TIRRS system.|$|E
5|$|The USB 3.1 Type-C {{connector}} is {{an emerging}} standard which <b>has</b> <b>replaced</b> legacy video connectors such as mDP, Thunderbolt, HDMI and VGA in mobile devices. USB-C connectors can transmit DisplayPort video to docks and displays using standard USB Type-C cables or Type-C to DisplayPort cables and adapters; USB-C also supports HDMI adapters which perform active conversion from DisplayPort to HDMI 1.4 or 2.0. DisplayPort Alternate Mode for USB Type-C specification {{was published in}} 2015. USB Type-C chipsets {{are not required to}} include Dual-mode trasnmitters and only support DisplayPort LVDS protocol, so passive DP-HDMI adapters would not work with Type-C sources.|$|E

50|$|Two-dimensional video <b>has</b> been <b>replaced,</b> {{apparently}} completely, by “holovids” {{in three}} dimensions. Live holovids <b>have</b> <b>replaced</b> phone calls, and pre-recorded holovids <b>have</b> <b>replaced</b> letters. Interactive holovids include maps and photo albums (portable on a holocube) and computer-generated scenarios such as battle projections. In Shards of Honor, Cordelia borrows a holovid reporter’s camera, {{but in most}} of the books a computer/holovid screen seems to have a built-in camera which can record an image or video.|$|R
5|$|The notable {{properties}} of germania (GeO2) are its high {{index of refraction}} and its low optical dispersion. These make it especially useful for wide-angle camera lenses, microscopy, and the core part of optical fibers. It <b>has</b> <b>replaced</b> titania as the dopant for silica fiber, eliminating the subsequent heat treatment that made the fibers brittle. At the end of 2002, the fiber optics industry consumed 60% of the annual germanium use in the United States, but this is less than 10% of worldwide consumption. GeSbTe is a phase change material used for its optic properties, such as that used in rewritable DVDs.|$|E
5|$|The {{painting}} {{has been}} linked both thematically and in its formal construction to Bacon's 1956 work Owls, and to preparatory sketches only brought to the art market in the late 1990s. The art critic Armin Zweite traces {{the origin of the}} lower figure to a photograph of an owl that Bacon found in a book on birds in motion; Bacon <b>has</b> <b>replaced</b> the bird's beak with a wide open human mouth.|$|E
5|$|The ride {{features}} more than 24 regular characters from The Simpsons and features {{the voices of the}} regular cast members, as well as Pamela Hayden, Russi Taylor and Kelsey Grammer. Harry Shearer, however, decided not to participate in the ride, so none of his characters have vocal parts and many do not appear in the ride at all. In homage to the Back to the Future ride that it <b>has</b> <b>replaced,</b> The Simpsons Ride's queue video features a brief animated cameo from Doc Brown who is voiced by Christopher Lloyd.|$|E

The boy shrugs this off and assumes that it is the same dog.|$|E
5|$|Two {{sections}} of the province are not dominated by forest. The province's northeast corner bordering Hudson Bay is above the treeline and is considered tundra. The tallgrass prairie once dominated the south central and southeastern parts including the Red River Valley. Mixed grass prairie {{is found in the}} southwestern region. Agriculture <b>has</b> <b>replaced</b> much of the natural prairie but prairie still can be found in parks and protected areas; some are notable for the presence of the endangered western prairie fringed orchid,.|$|E
5|$|A new {{parking lot}} has been {{constructed}} on college-owned land between Sullivan Arena and privately owned Clarke Farm in Bedford. This parking lot <b>has</b> <b>replaced</b> the former Joan of Arc parking lot, which was located between the Dana Center, Davison Dining Hall, and the Joan of Arc dormitory (JOA). The former {{parking lot was}} torn down, and a grassy open quadrangle was constructed {{during the summer of}} 2012. A grotto has been built between JOA and Gadbois Hall and was dedicated in late 2014, with the placement of a religious statue. The quadrangle is yet to be named, and has new lights and walkways; the centerpiece is a large granite seal of the college. The project is the first place on campus where electronic gates have been installed. The gates are used to cordon off the roads of the new quad during the regular semester and can be opened for emergency vehicles and during move in/out days.|$|E
