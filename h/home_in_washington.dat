5|$|In 1981, Fisher {{joined the}} faculty of George Mason University School of Law in Arlington, Virginia, {{teaching}} various seminars on negotiation tactics.

This commission reviewed the impact of Executive Order 9066 on Japanese-Americans and determined {{that they were the}} victims of discrimination by the Federal government. Fisher died on March 18, 1983, aged 69, from cancer at his <b>home</b> <b>in</b> <b>Washington,</b> D.C.|$|E

5|$|The {{marriage}} {{was not a}} success. By the 1840s, Natalie Benjamin was living in Paris with the couple's only child, Ninette, whom she raised as a Catholic. Benjamin would visit them annually. While a senator, in the late 1850s he persuaded Natalie to rejoin him and expensively furnished a <b>home</b> <b>in</b> <b>Washington</b> for all three to live in. Natalie and their daughter soon embarked again for France. Benjamin, publicly humiliated by his failure to keep Natalie, consigned the household goods to auction. There were rumors, never substantiated, both that Benjamin was impotent, and that Natalie was unfaithful.|$|E

5|$|Blaine {{received}} {{the news at}} his <b>home</b> <b>in</b> <b>Washington</b> and telegraphed Hayes his congratulations. In the subsequent contest of 1876, Hayes was elected after a contentious compromise over disputed electoral votes. The results of the convention had further effects on Blaine’s political career, as Bristow, having lost the nomination, also resigned as Treasury Secretary {{three days after the}} convention ended. President Grant selected Senator Lot M. Morrill of Maine to fill the cabinet post, and Maine’s governor, Seldon Connor, appointed Blaine to the now-vacant Senate seat. When the Maine Legislature reconvened that autumn, they confirmed Blaine’s appointment and elected him to the full six-year term that would begin on March 4, 1877.|$|E

5|$|Like her mother, Ellen Ewing Sherman was {{a devout}} Roman Catholic, and the Shermans' eight {{children}} were reared in that faith. In 1864, Ellen took up temporary residence in South Bend, Indiana, {{to have her}} young family educated at the University of Notre Dame and St. Mary's College. In 1874, with Sherman having become world-famous, their eldest child, Marie Ewing ("Minnie") Sherman, also had a politically prominent wedding, attended by President Ulysses S. Grant and commemorated by a generous gift from the Khedive of Egypt. (Eventually, one of Minnie's daughters married a grandson of Confederate general Lewis Addison Armistead.) Another of the Sherman daughters, Eleanor, was married to Alexander Montgomery Thackara at General Sherman's <b>home</b> <b>in</b> <b>Washington,</b> D.C., on May 5, 1880. To Sherman's great displeasure and sorrow, his oldest surviving son, Thomas Ewing Sherman, joined the religious order of the Jesuits in 1878 and was ordained as a priest in 1889.|$|E

5|$|Serving as Secretary of the Treasury in the {{administration}} of Rutherford B. Hayes, Sherman continued his efforts for financial stability and solvency, overseeing an end to wartime inflationary measures and a return to gold-backed money. He returned to the Senate after his term expired, serving there for a further sixteen years. During that time he continued his work on financial legislation, as well as writing and debating laws on immigration, business competition law, and the regulation of interstate commerce. Sherman was the principal author of the Sherman Antitrust Act of 1890, which was signed into law by President Benjamin Harrison. In 1897, President William McKinley appointed him Secretary of State. Failing health and declining faculties made him unable to handle the burdens of the job, and he retired in 1898 {{at the start of the}} Spanish–American War. Sherman died at his <b>home</b> <b>in</b> <b>Washington,</b> D.C. in 1900.|$|E
5|$|Taft {{insisted on}} going to Cincinnati to attend the funeral of his brother Charles, who died on December 31, 1929; the strain did not improve his own health. When the court reconvened on January 6, 1930, Taft had not {{returned}} to Washington, and two opinions were delivered by Van Devanter that Taft had drafted but {{had been unable to}} complete because of his illness. Taft went to Asheville, North Carolina for a rest, {{but by the end of}} January, he could barely speak and was suffering from hallucinations. Taft was afraid that Stone would be made chief justice; he did not resign until he had secured assurances from Hoover that Hughes would be the choice. Returning to Washington after his resignation on February 3, Taft had barely enough strength to sign a reply to a letter of tribute from the eight associate justices. He died at his <b>home</b> <b>in</b> <b>Washington</b> on March 8, 1930.|$|E
