Specialized chafing-dish cookbooks appeared from the 1880s. A book of chafing-dish recipes printed for the silversmiths, Gorham Manufacturing Co. in New York, (2nd edition, 1894), featured a brief history of chafing dishes, followed by proper <b>instruction</b> <b>for</b> <b>use,</b> suggesting its novelty. Fannie Farmers Chafing Dish Possibilities was published in Boston in 1898. Modern chafing dishes are made of light metal or ceramic casseroles with handles, sometimes covered with a Pyrex lid. Classic uses of a chafing-dish are in preparing Welsh rarebit or cheese fondue.|$|E

50|$|He {{was born}} in Mittelberg, Allgäu, Bavaria, and {{received}} his elementary training in the monastic school in Füssen. He studied classics in Augsburg, and in 1788 entered the clerical seminary in Dillingen, {{to take up the}} study of philosophy and theology. After his ordination to the priesthood, in 1792, he held the office of private tutor, and in 1796 was placed in charge of the parish church of Unterthalheim, near Horb, on the Neckar. As well as his parochial duties he found time to prepare several textbooks and other small works on Christian <b>instruction,</b> <b>for</b> <b>use</b> in elementary schools. He also entered the field of New Testament exegesis. In 1812 he published Neuer Versuch, die Entstehung der drei ersten Evangelien zu erklären (Stuttgart, 1812), in which he adopted the hypothesis of a Hebrew original as the basis of one of the Synoptic Gospels. This work attracted the attention of scholars, and won for him on 28 September of the same year the chairs of Greek language and Biblical hermeneutics in the University of Ellwangen. Recognizing his abilities, the University of Freiburg, in 1813, conferred on him the doctorate in theology.|$|E

40|$|The Endurant stent-graft (Medtronic, Inc., Minneapolis, MN, USA) is a latest {{generation}} device {{for the treatment}} of abdominal aortic aneurysm. The idea behind designing such a graft came from the intention to broad the <b>instruction</b> <b>for</b> <b>use</b> (IFU) and to enable it to treat more challenging anatomy including the 10 mm neck lengths, and more severe suprarenal and infrarenal angulations. Endurant stent-graft has active fixation through suprarenal stent with anchoring pins to provide migration resistance, optimized heights of stents and spacing between them for improved flexibility and conformability, low-profile delivery system with hydrophilic coating and controlled simple deployment mechanism. Short term results are excellent. Technical and clinical success is confirmed in Regulatory trials (EU and USA), as well as in ENGAGE and the Canadian registry. Many current publications record the use of Endurant stent-graft outside the <b>Instruction</b> <b>for</b> <b>use.</b> The results in a group of patients outside the <b>instruction</b> <b>for</b> <b>use</b> are comparable to those within instruction for use; with the exception of perioperative proximal endoleak type I.

30|$|Dr. Feri also {{suggests}} that our methodology cannot properly compare these devices {{in accordance with their}} clinical duration and that the oXiris device may have reduced adsorptive capacities in relation to a lower surface area. To the question of the experiment duration, a 2 -h session is the average treatment duration reported with the Toraymyxin cartridge in recent large-scale clinical studies [4 – 6]. CytoSorb may be used 6 [*]h per day according its <b>instruction</b> <b>for</b> <b>use</b> (not 24 [*]h as mentioned in the letter) [7]. The question of the experimental duration is interesting, and therefore, a calculation of clearance was proposed (Fig.  4), without any ambiguity on the respective instantaneous removal performances of each device.|$|E

30|$|Also, {{note that}} our study aims and {{procedures}} precluded any physician responses during baseline measures; therefore, comparisons between physicians and auditors were only available during the intervention phase, while compliance between baseline and intervention phases {{was assessed by}} auditor responses. Although concordance levels between physicians and auditors were acceptable (see Table  4), as highlighted in Additional file 4 : Table S 4, auditors recorded {{a higher rate of}} ‘NA’ responses than physicians, particularly for pain, DVT prophylaxis, nutrition and sedation management. The reason for this is not known; possible explanations include differences in checklist completion times and interpretation of ‘NA’ response; physicians might not have realised that ‘NA’ responses were subsumed under the ‘No’ category (i.e. as a reason why care was not delivered); or different interpretations for checklist definitions and <b>instruction</b> <b>for</b> <b>use,</b> despite a data dictionary being available. It is therefore unclear whether these systematic differences in responses influenced our findings.|$|E
40|$|This paper {{describes}} an {{implementation of a}} lossless digital waveform coder as a soft-core CPU custom <b>instruction</b> <b>for</b> <b>use</b> in portable electrocardiogram (ECG) recording systems. Holter monitors are portable ECG recorders that are de-signed to be worn by the patient for a typical period of 24 – 48 hours. Such systems can generate large quantities of data, necessitating some form of coding {{to reduce the size}} of the stored data. Traditionally, ECG coding methods em-ploy lossy approaches. While such methods can attain better compression than a lossless method, the reduction in signal fidelity may obscure important details in the signal. The coding algorithm implemented consists of a linear decorrelator selected from analysis of a block of samples, followed by entropy coding of the residual using Golomb-Rice codes. The implementation is designed as a custom instruction for the Altera Nios CPU, and when tested on signals from real ECG libraries, performed approximately seven times faster than a software implementation written in C and running on the same CPU...|$|E
