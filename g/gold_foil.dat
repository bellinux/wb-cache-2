5|$|During Borobudur excavation, archeologists {{discovered}} colour pigments of blue, red, green, black, {{as well as}} bits of <b>gold</b> <b>foil,</b> {{and concluded}} that the monument that we see today — a dark gray mass of volcanic stone, lacking in colour — was probably once coated with varjalepa white plaster and then painted with bright colors, serving perhaps as a beacon of Buddhist teaching. The same vajralepa plaster can also be found in Sari, Kalasan and Sewu temples. It is likely that the bas-reliefs of Borobudur was originally quite colourful, before centuries of torrential tropical rainfalls peeled-off the colour pigments.|$|E

5|$|Small {{pieces of}} <b>gold</b> <b>foil</b> {{featuring}} engravings {{dating from the}} Migration Period into the early Viking Age (known as gullgubber) have been discovered in various locations in Scandinavia, almost 2,500 at one location. The foil pieces have been found largely at sites of buildings, only rarely in graves. The figures are sometimes single, occasionally an animal, sometimes {{a man and a}} woman with a leafy bough between them, facing or embracing one another. The human figures are almost always clothed and are sometimes depicted with their knees bent. Scholar Hilda Ellis Davidson says that it has been suggested that the figures are partaking in a dance, and that they may have been connected with weddings, as well as linked to the Vanir group of gods, representing the notion of a divine marriage, such as in the Poetic Edda poem Skírnismál; the coming together of Gerðr and Freyr.|$|E

Mysore is known for rosewood inlay work; around 4,000 craftsmen were estimated to be involved in this art in 2002. The city lends its name to the Mysore silk saree, a women's garment made with pure silk and gold zari (thread). Mysore Peta, the traditional indigenous turban worn by the erstwhile rulers of Mysore, is worn by men in some traditional ceremonies.

5|$|While Seaborg {{applied for}} funding, Harvey {{worked on the}} {{einsteinium}} target, while Thomson and Choppin focused on methods for chemical isolation. Choppin suggested using α-hydroxyisobutyric acid to separate the mendelevium atoms {{from those of the}} lighter actinides. The actual synthesis was done by a recoil technique, introduced by Albert Ghiorso. In this technique, the einsteinium was placed {{on the opposite side of}} the target from the beam, so that the recoiling mendelevium atoms would get enough momentum to leave the target and be caught on a catcher foil made of gold. This recoil target was made by an electroplating technique, developed by Alfred Chetham-Strode. This technique gave a very high yield, which was absolutely necessary when working with such a rare and valuable product as the einsteinium target material. The recoil target consisted of 109 atoms of 253Es which were deposited electrolytically on a thin <b>gold</b> <b>foil.</b> It was bombarded by 41MeV alpha particles in the Berkeley cyclotron with a very high beam density of 6×1013 particles per second over an area of 0.05cm2. The target was cooled by water or liquid helium, and the foil could be replaced.|$|E

25|$|At the University of Manchester between 1908 and 1913, Rutherford {{directed}} Hans Geiger and Ernest Marsden in {{a series}} of experiments to determine what happens when alpha particles scatter from metal foil. Now called the Rutherford <b>gold</b> <b>foil</b> experiment, or the Geiger–Marsden experiment, these measurements made the extraordinary discovery that alpha particles would occasionally scatter to high angle when passing through a thin <b>gold</b> <b>foil.</b> The scattering indicated that the alpha particles were reflecting from a small, but dense, component of atoms. Based on these measurements, in 1911 Rutherford developed a model for the atom that consisted of a small massive nucleus with positive charge surrounded by a much larger cloud of negatively charged electrons. The concentrated atomic mass was required to provide the observed reflection of the alpha particles, and Rutherford developed a mathematical model that accounted for the scattering.|$|E

40|$|Using {{scanning}} probe microscopy, several studies {{were carried out}} to characterize surface topographies and properties. First, utilizing scanning tunneling microscopy (STM), we characterized fullerenes deposited onto <b>gold</b> <b>foils</b> and highly oriented gold films. On <b>gold</b> <b>foils,</b> we found that C₆₀ packed in hexagonally ordered overlayers and that the images showed internal buckyball features that arose from electronic interactions between the molecule and the substrate. On gold films, with an ordered overlayer of methyl isobutyl ketone (MIBK), the isolated C₆₀ molecules showed internal features in a "doughnut" shape, different than those seen previously. We also imaged <b>gold</b> <b>foils</b> on which a significant number of larger fullerene molecules were deposited, and found only spherical molecules in our images. A theoretical analysis of the optical beam deflection atomic force microscope (AFM) predicted sufficient sensitivity to measure atomic corrugations greater than 1 A. This agreed with experimental results showing atomically resolvable images. Another theoretical investigation probe the relative magnitude of the forces between the tip, sample, and an adsorbed atom on a surface. Experimentally, we investigated cleaved multiple quantum wells ans showed surface corrugations with a period equal to the quantum well spacing. The third technique used was magnetic force microscopy (MFM). We analyzed a novel system that combined the tunneling aspects of STM with the force-sensing attributes of force microscopy, and provided the ability to simultaneously image surface features as well as magnetic domains with a sensitivity that depended on the spring constant of the tunneling tip. Experimentally, we used this system to image magnetic domains and reveal the surface roughness of magnetic recording media. The second MFM technique involved spin-coating a magnetic surface with a ferrofliud, then over-coating with gold, and finally imaging the surface with STM. The STM revealed raised ridges where the ferromagnetic particles clumped in regions of high magnetic field gradient. The finally MFM we utilized imaged magnetic fields using a beam deflection force microscope by modulating a magnetic disk head and detecting the vibration of the magnetic tip. We were able to image the fields of a floppy disk head...|$|R
