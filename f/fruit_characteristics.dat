25|$|Commercially grown {{orange trees}} are {{propagated}} asexually by grafting a mature cultivar onto a suitable seedling rootstock {{to ensure the}} same yield, identical <b>fruit</b> <b>characteristics,</b> and resistance to diseases throughout the years. Propagation involves two stages: first, a rootstock is grown from seed. Then, when it is approximately one year old, the leafy top is cut off and a bud taken from a specific scion variety, is grafted into its bark. The scion is what determines the variety of orange, while the rootstock makes the tree resistant to pests and diseases and adaptable to specific soil and climatic conditions. Thus, rootstocks influence {{the rate of growth}} and have an effect on fruit yield and quality.|$|E

40|$|This {{study was}} {{conducted}} to investigate the effects of four drip irrigation treatments on five <b>fruiting</b> <b>characteristics</b> of cotton (Gossypium hirsutum L.) using periodic observations to gauge the relative impact of these effects over time.

The irrigation treatments included four levels that in total season applied irrigation equaled 60, 68, 76, and 83 cm of water. Periodic observations included three, 3 -week-intervals from the onset of flowering (26 June) to cutout (29 August). Results indicate that irrigation treatments had a significant effect on all characters measured, only in the later stages of development (later in the season) with higher amounts of irrigation applied producing higher levels of each character measured. Significant differences were found among periods of observation for all characters measured...|$|R

5000|$|Note. The term [...] "scion wood" [...] {{refers to}} {{the part of a}} tree that is grafted onto the roots or stem of another, known as the rootstock. This grafted branch or bud transmits the {{flowering}} or <b>fruiting</b> <b>characteristics</b> of the variety from which it is taken.

50|$|There are {{a number}} of <b>fruit</b> <b>characteristics</b> that seem to be {{adaptive}} characteristics to attract frugivores. Many animal-dispersed fruits advertise their palatability to animals with bright colors and attractive smells (mimetic fruits). Fruit pulp is generally rich in water and carbohydrates and low in protein and lipids. However, the exact nutritional composition of fruits varies widely. The seeds of animal-dispersed fruits are often adapted to survive digestion by frugivores. For example, seeds can become more permeable to water after passage through an animal's gut. This leads to higher germination rates. Some mistletoe seeds even germinate inside the disperser's intestine.|$|E
50|$|Ecological cost {{results from}} the {{disruption}} of the many symbiotic relationships that a plant has with the environment. For example, jasmonic acid {{can be used to}} simulate an herbivore attack on plants and thus, induce plant defences. The use of jasmonic acid on tomato (Lycopersicon esculentum) resulted in plants with fewer but larger fruits, longer ripening time, delayed fruit-set, fewer seeds per plant and fewer seeds per unit of fruit weight. All these features {{play a critical role in}} attracting seed dispersers. Due to the consequences of induced defences on <b>fruit</b> <b>characteristics,</b> L. esculentum are less able to attract seed dispersers and this ultimately results in a reduced fitness.|$|E

This study aims to assess flowering and <b>fruiting</b> <b>characteristics</b> and to determine pattern of mating system of a Calophyllum inophyllum plantation at Watusipat, Gunung Kidul. Flowering and fruiting were observed at 4 locations, 3 parts of crown, and 4 main directions to know the effects of sunlight, nutrition intake and phytohormone in the flowering process. Mating system was assessed by comparing genetic diversity values between parent trees and offsprings. The values of genetic diversity were analyzed using 5 RAPD primers with 17 polymorphic loci. Analysis of variant showed that the locations, crown parts, directions and interaction between a location and direction significantly affected to differences number of flowers and fruits. Values of genetic diversity (h) of parent trees ranged between 0. 1471 and 0. 3056. The values increased at almost overall offsprings; it ranged between 0. 2864 and 0. 3750. Values of genetic distance (Da) between parent trees were high and very high (0. 197 – 0. 364), but the values was decreased between parent trees and their offspring, even between offspring populations. A dendrogram showed two main clusters; first cluster consisted parent trees at up edge with rare trees and second cluster consisted sub cluster parent trees at up edge; sub cluster parent trees at down middle; and sub cluster parent trees at down edge and overall offsprings.

50|$|When it is {{difficult}} to match a plant to the soil in a certain field or orchard, growers may graft a scion onto a rootstock that is compatible with the soil.
