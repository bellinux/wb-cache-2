[...] The band released Till Death <b>Do</b> <b>Us</b> <b>Part</b> on March 23, 2004. The album saw the band experiment with reggae especially on the lead single [...] "What's Your Number".

2500|$|In 1975, while {{residing}} in the States, Slade was influenced by Southern boogie rock bands and as a result, Nobody's Fools featured a wide mixture of styles including soul, country, rock, funk, folk and blues. The album also featured some soulful female backing vocalists. After the band returned to the UK in 1977, they began to merge their American influences with a classic, hard rock. The resulting sound, in turn, became an influence to American grunge artists. [...] Return to Base (1979) featured elements of classic rock, acoustic rock, rock ballads, ambient rock and rock and roll. Two albums, released in 1981; We'll Bring the House Down and Till Deaf <b>Do</b> <b>Us</b> <b>Part</b> adopted a hard rock and heavy metal sound, {{as a result of}} the band's revival amongst heavy metal fans, following their success at the Reading Festival.|$|E
2500|$|The band's {{first full}} release on the RCA label was the European hit single [...] "Lock Up Your Daughters" [...] in late 1981.

It remains Slade's most metal-directed and heaviest sounding album to date. An article in NME shortly after release, claimed Slade were in trouble over the album cover, which featured an 'offensive' picture of a nail piercing an ear drum, and that many dealers were refusing to stock it. The cover was later changed on the CD reissue to {{a picture of the}} band in flames. In December, RCA released [...] "Merry Xmas Everybody" [...] {{for the first time since}} its initial outing.

5000|$|Many evangelical Protestants {{similarly}} reject creeds as definitive {{statements of}} faith, even while agreeing with some creeds' substance.
