The aim was to investigate the potential of an easily passable trail using mainly existing roads and trails, that at the same time, would pass many interesting nature areas around the town that could give the visitor nature experiences. Another aim was also to examine if there was any area fitting to create a shorter trail, about 10 kilometres long.   The passability of trails connecting some of 42 pre-marked areas was studied together with examination of the nature types and the experience these gave in terms of natural and cultural experiences.   The results showed that many trails east of the town was hard to pass and gave a low amount of experiences due to heavy forestry.

In verses 5-7, he speaketh a parable {{of a man}} that went to his friend to borrow three loaves, who, {{because he was in}} bed, denied him; yet for his importunity-sake, he did arise and give him, clearly signifying that though poor souls, through the weakness of their faith, cannot see that they are the friends of God, yet they should never leave asking, seeking, and knocking at God's door for mercy. Mark, saith Christ, [...] "I say unto you, though he will not rise and give him, because he is his friend; yet because of his importunity," [...] or restless desires, [...] "he will rise and give him as many as he needeth." [...] Poor heart! thou criest out that God will not regard thee, thou dost not find that thou art a friend to him, but rather an enemy in thine heart by wicked works (Col 1:21). And thou art as though thou didst hear the Lord saying to thee, Trouble me not, I cannot give unto thee, as he in the parable; yet I say, continue knocking, crying, moaning, and bewailing thyself. I tell thee, [...] "though he will not rise and give thee, because thou art his friend; yet, because of thy importunity, he will arise and give thee as many as thou needest." [...] The same in effect you have discovered, Luke 18, in the parable of the unjust judge and the poor widow; her importunity prevailed with him. And verily, mine own experience tells me, that there is nothing that doth more prevail with God than importunity. Is it not so with you in respect of your beggars that come to your door? Though you have no heart to give them anything at their first asking, yet if they follow you, bemoaning themselves, and will take no nay without an alms, you will give them; for their continual begging overcometh you. Are there bowels in you that are wicked, and will they be wrought upon by an importuning beggar? Go thou and do the like. It is a prevailing motive, and that by <b>good</b> <b>experience,</b> he will arise and give thee as many as thou needest (Luke 11:8).|$|E
