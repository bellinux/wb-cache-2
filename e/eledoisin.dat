40|$|The {{posterior}} {{salivary glands}} of Eledone, alone among the tissues of this molluscan species, contain <b>eledoisin,</b> an endecapeptide with activity on {{blood vessels and}} extravascular smooth muscles. The salivary glands of Octopus vulgaris and O. macropus lack the polypeptide. <b>Eledoisin</b> is present, in amounts ranging from 20 to 160 μg/g fresh tissue, at all stages of growth and in every season; however, conspicuous differences in the <b>eledoisin</b> content were observed in different groups of animals. <b>Eledoisin</b> is fairly stable in intact salivary glands stored on ice. The most suitable solvent for its extraction is 70 to 80 % methanol. Better results are also obtained with boiling diluted acetic acid, than with ethanol, whereas extraction with acetone gives unsatisfactory yields. <b>Eledoisin</b> is stable in neutral or slightly acid medium, but is rapidly destroyed by strong acids and even more rapidly by strong alkalis. It is quickly and completely inactivated by chymotrypsin, and somewhat more slowly and incompletely by trypsin. Carboxypeptidase is ineffective. Passage of crude salivary extracts of Eledone through an alumina column yields preparations of <b>eledoisin</b> which may be considered pure from a biological point of view...|$|E
40|$|The blood {{pressure}} response following parenteral administration of <b>eledoisin</b> varies conspicuously from one animal species to another. In the dog the polypeptide elicits a clear hypotension under all experimental conditions. <b>Eledoisin</b> is active at extremely low dose levels and hypotension is not appreciably affected by previous treatment with atropine, sympatholytic drugs, ganglion-blocking agents or reserpine. <b>Eledoisin</b> potently antagonizes the pressor effects of catechol amines and of angiotensin. Longlasting hypotension {{can be obtained}} by intravenous infusion or subcutaneous injection of the polypeptide. The mechanism of action of <b>eledoisin</b> in the dog is believed to be chiefly peripheral. The rabbit, the guinea-pig and the cat behave like the dog in the type but not in the intensity of their blood-pressure response to <b>eledoisin.</b> The rat gives variable responses to the polypeptide. After treatment with a ganglion-blocking drug, or in the pithed rat, a rise in {{blood pressure}} is the predominant effect. In the anaesthetized chicken <b>eledoisin</b> generally produces a diphasic response, but in the decapitated animal only hypertension. This last effect is believed to depend largely, if not entirely, on the release of catechol amines from body stores. The dog blood pressure may be used for the assay of eledoisin; suitable results may also be obtained from the pressor effects in decapitated chickens...|$|E
40|$|Some general {{effects and}} the action of <b>eledoisin</b> {{on a number of}} {{isolated}} smooth muscle preparations have been studied. It has been found that <b>eledoisin</b> possesses a potent stimulating action on all preparations of gastro-intestinal smooth muscle examined and also on the bronchial muscle of the guinea-pig in situ. Preparations of other smooth muscles were less sensitive. The rabbit colon, the guinea-pig ileum and, subordinately, the rabbit uterus and the frog stomach may be profitably used, owing to their sensitivity and the satisfactory dose/response relationship, for the quantitative bioassay of <b>eledoisin</b> in crude or pure preparations of the polypeptide. In parallel assays <b>eledoisin</b> could be easily distinguished from the biogenic amines and from all other known naturally occurring hypotensive polypeptides (bradykinins, wasp kinin, bradykinin-like polypeptides of the amphibian skin, physalaemin, substance P). In the unanaesthetized dog, subcutaneous doses of 25 to 100 μg/kg <b>eledoisin</b> caused a powerful stimulation of the motility and some secretions of the alimentary canal. This effect was much less pronounced in the rat and the rabbit...|$|E
40|$|Pulse intracerebroventricular {{injection}} of <b>eledoisin,</b> {{but not of}} substance P, markedly increases plasma vasopressin levels in the rat. Intracerebroventricular pretreatment with sarcosine 1, alanine 8 -angiotensin II, 1 microgram/rat, completely suppresses the effect of <b>eledoisin,</b> suggesting that it is mediated by angiotensin release and angiotensin II receptor activation. The vasopressin releasing effect of <b>eledoisin</b> is neither due to peripheral haemodynamic alterations, nor to activation of the peripheral renin-angiotensin system. It is apparently related to central angiotensin release in a specific neuronal pathway subserving vasopressin release. This effect is not secondary to inhibition by tachykinins of the brain mechanisms for angiotensin-induced drinking, but is probably expression of direct activation of specific tachykinin receptors controlling vasopressin release...|$|E
40|$|<b>Eledoisin,</b> an endecapeptide, {{has been}} {{reported}} to produce potent hypotensive and vasodilating effects in some species of animals (Anastasi and Erspamer, 1962; Olmst. ed and Page, 1962; St#{ 252 }rmer and Berde, 1963; Erspamer and Gl#{ 228 }sser, 1963) and in human subjects (Sicuteri at a!., 1963). The action of <b>eledoisin</b> on the systemic arterial blood pressure differs sharply from one species to another. The dog appears to be the most sensitive to the polypeptide (Erspamer and Gliisser, 1963; Stiirmer and Berde, 1963) and <b>eledoisin</b> produces much more potent hypo-tensive effects in this species than bradykinin (St#{ 252 }rmer and Berde, 1963).

40|$|The {{ontogeny}} of the antidipsogenic {{effect of}} the tachykinins <b>eledoisin</b> and physalaemin was studied in 1 - to 12 -day-old Wistar rats. Both peptides inhibited drinking evoked by ICV angiotensin II, cell-dehydration or fluid deprivation. The effect of <b>eledoisin</b> appeared earlier than that of physalaemin (third v. sixth day) and was evoked by lower doses (10 - 100 ng/rat vs 330 - 1000 ng rat). The two tachykinins also inhibited milk intake, but this effect occurred only in {{the earliest days of}} neonatal life. The results confirm the specificity of the antitipsogenic effect of <b>eledoisin</b> and physalaemin and give further support to the hypothesis that brain tachykinins play a physiological role in the control of fluid intake...|$|E
40|$|The {{effect on}} water intake, urine flow and {{vasopressin}} release of intracranial injections of substance P, physalaemin and <b>eledoisin</b> was studied in Wistar and Brattleboro, homozygous and heterozygous, rats. The tachykinins strongly inhibited water intake both in Wistar and in Brattleboro, homozygous and heterozygous, rats. Physalaemin and <b>eledoisin</b> reduced urine flow in Wistar and heterozygous, {{but not in}} homozygous, Brattleboro rats. Substance P never affected urine elimination. Physalaemin and <b>eledoisin</b> produced a dose-dependent, long lasting release of vasopressin in Wistar rats. Substance P {{did not affect the}} release of vasopressin. The results suggest that both substance P and physalaemin could influence brain mechanisms which control water intake, acting as thirst inhibitors, and that physalaemin could also participate in body fluid control by conserving water through vasopressin release...|$|E
40|$|The potencies {{of three}} tachykinin antagonists [D-Pro 4,D-Trp 7, 9, 10]SP(4 - 11), [D-Arg 1,D-Pro 2,D-Trp 7, 9,Leu 11]SP(1 - 11) and [D-Arg 1,D-Trp 7, 9,Leu 11]SP(1 - 11) (spantide) against <b>eledoisin</b> were {{examined}} in the guinea-pig ileum myenteric plexus, where a continuous superfusion system {{was employed to examine}} evoked release of [3 H]-acetylcholine [(3 H]-ACh]); effects on mechanical activity of the preparations were also measured. <b>Eledoisin</b> was chosen as the standard tachykinin agonist since the rank order of potency observed in evoking release was <b>eledoisin,</b> kassinin, substance P, physalaemin; on this basis is may be presumed that an 'SP-E' type receptor was involved in the release process. The two undecapeptide antagonists both significantly reduced the response to <b>eledoisin</b> (10 nM) as assessed by both [3 H]-ACh release and mechanical activity which under these conditions was largely dependent on ACh release, and the response levels could be restored by increasing the concentration of <b>eledoisin</b> to 100 nM. The pA 2 values for the two antagonists were estimated as 5. 3 for [D-Arg 1,D-Pro 2,D-Trp 7, 9,Leu 11]SP(1 - 11) and 5. 2 for [D-Arg 1,D-Trp 7, 9,Leu 11]SP(1 - 11). [D-Pro 4,D-Trp 7, 9, 10]SP(4 - 11) was markedly less potent with a pA 2 value of less than 4. 8. All three antagonists possessed considerable inherent stimulatory activity as measured both by [3 H]-ACh release and mechanical activity, [D-Pro 4,D-Trp 7, 9, 10]SP(4 - 11) being the most active in this respect, a 10 microM concentration producing 50 % of the response seen with 10 nM <b>eledoisin.</b> These findings are discussed both in relation to tachykinin receptor classifications and limitations in the use of such antagonists {{in the study of the}} role of tachykinins in neurotransmission...|$|E
40|$|Intracerebroventricular {{administration}} of <b>eledoisin,</b> the tachykinin peptide of the salivary glands of Eledone Moschata, exerts a potent and long-lasting inhibition of water intake {{induced by the}} subcutaneous {{administration of}} hypertonic NaCl in the rat. The inhibitory effect is statistically significant up to 6 hr following <b>eledoisin</b> treatment, while the 24 hr water intake in control and treated rats is essentially identical. The {{results of the present}} study demonstrate that the long-lasting effect is not due to increased renal excretion of the osmotic load, nor, likely, to larger production of metabolic water. Probably, <b>eledoisin</b> exerts an inhibitory effect of such a long duration by means of central actions which last well beyond its half-life, or, alternatively, by promoting an increased excretion of the osmotic load through elimination routes different from the kidney...|$|E

40|$|Tachykinin-stimulated {{inositol}} phospholipid hydrolysis {{was examined}} in slices of hamster urinary bladder. In {{the presence of}} lithium, to inhibit inositol monophosphatase activity, substance P, <b>eledoisin</b> and related tachykinins induced large, dose-dependent increases in [3 H]-inositol monophosphate accumulation. The responses to substance P and <b>eledoisin</b> were not antagonized by the cholinoceptor antagonist, atropine. The rank order of potency for various tachykinins was kassinin greater than neurokinin A greater than neurokinin B greater than <b>eledoisin</b> greater than physaelamin greater than substance P greater than substance P methyl ester. The synthetic analogue [p-Glu 6, D-Pro 9]SP (6 - 11) was considerably more potent than its L-prolyl stereoisomer at stimulating inositol phospholipid hydrolysis. These results suggest that in the hamster urinary bladder, tachykinin-induced inositol phospholipid breakdown is mediated via tachykinin receptors of the SP-E type, {{as opposed to the}} SP-P type...|$|E
40|$|The {{present study}} {{investigated}} {{the sensitivity of the}} medial region of the amygdala to the antinatriorexic action in the rat of the tachykinins <b>eledoisin,</b> substance P, neurokinin A and [Asp 5, 6, MePhe 8] substance P(5 - 11) (also referred to as amino-senktide; NH 2 -SENK), which is a highly selective agonist for NK- 3 receptors. The results obtained show that only the potent NK- 3 agonists <b>eledoisin</b> and NH 2 -SENK inhibit salt appetite when injected into the medial region of the amygdala. <b>Eledoisin</b> and NH 2 -SENK inhibited salt appetite induced by sodium depletion, that has been proven to be governed by the synergism of angiotensin and aldosterone. They inhibited also salt appetite evoked by central renin injection, that is due to production of angiotensin II. On the other hand, <b>eledoisin</b> and NH 2 -SENK did not inhibit salt appetite evoked by subcutaneous deoxycorticosterone treatment. These findings suggest that the medial region of the amygdala is a site of action for the antinatriorexic effect of tachykinins and that their action at this site is mediated by NK- 3 receptors. Moreover, our results show that in the medial amygdala, the antinatriorexic action of tachykinins appears to be directed toward the angiotensinergic component of the neural mechanism for salt appetite...|$|E
40|$|AbstractBoth the aqueous and the lipid-induced {{structure}} of <b>eledoisin,</b> an undecapeptide of mollusk origin, {{have been studied}} by two-dimensional proton nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy and distance geometry calculations. Unambiguous nuclear magnetic resonance assignments of protons have been made {{with the aid of}} correlation spectroscopy experiments and nuclear Overhauser effect spectroscopy experiments. The distance constraints obtained from the nuclear magnetic resonance data have been utilized in a distance geometry algorithm to generate a family of structures, which have been refined using restrained energy minimization and dynamics. These data show that, while in water and dimethyl sulfoxide, <b>eledoisin</b> prefers to be in an extended chain conformation, whereas in the presence of perdeuterated dodecylphosphocholine micelles, a membrane model system, helical conformation is induced in the central core and C-terminal region (K 4 -M 11) of the peptide. N terminus, though less defined, also displays some degree of order and a possible turn structure. The conformation adopted by <b>eledoisin</b> in the presence of dodecylphosphocholine micelles is similar to the structural motif typical of neurokinin- 2 selective agonists and with that reported for kassinin in hydrophobic environment...|$|E
40|$|The {{substance}} P antagonist [D-Arg 1,D-Pro 2,D-Trp 7, 9,Leu 11]-substance P produced parallel log {{dose-response curve}} shifts to both substance P and <b>eledoisin</b> on five in vitro smooth muscle preparations. The slope values of Arunlakshana-Schild plots {{were not significantly}} different from unity suggesting that it acts as a simple competitive antagonist on all five preparations with an association constant (Ka) in the range of 0. 3 - 1. 5 X 10 (6) M- 1. The Ka value of the antagonist was always slightly greater when tested against <b>eledoisin</b> than against substance P; however, this difference appears too small to suggest that these two agonists are acting on different receptor sub-types...|$|E
40|$|The site {{of action}} of {{substance}} P and related tachykinins with respect to isotonic contractions was examined on the isolated muscularis mucosae attached to the submucous plexus of the guinea-pig oesophagus. Substance P (greater than 30 nM) produced a concentration-dependent contraction of the muscularis mucosae (EC 50 1. 9 +/- 0. 5 microM, n = 10). The contractions were rapid in onset (2 min or less), sustained, reversible by washing and the preparation did not show tachyphylaxis. <b>Eledoisin</b> and physalaemin produced similar sustained contraction of the muscularis mucosae. The order of sensitivity was <b>eledoisin</b> greater than substance P greater than physalaemin. Contractions induced by 1 microM of each tachykinin were not significantly modified by incubation of the tissue with substance P or <b>eledoisin</b> (10 microM for 30 min). The contractile responses to tachykinins were unaffected by tetrodotoxin (0. 3 microM), atropine (0. 3 microM), phentolamine (1 microM), chlorpheniramine (1 microM), methysergide (1 microM), baclofen (100 microM) and verapamil (10 microM), but were abolished by the incubation of the tissue with calcium-free, EGTA (0. 1 mM) -containing Tyrode solution. A substance P antagonist, [D-Pro 2, D-Trp 7, 9]-substance P (greater than 0. 1 microM), produced a transient contraction of the muscularis mucosae and the smooth muscle regained its original tone within 6 to 10 min. Contractions to the tachykinins were now inhibited by the antagonist (0. 1 - 10 microM) in a concentration-dependent manner, the order of sensitivity being physalaemin greater than substance P = <b>eledoisin.</b> The cholinergically mediated electrically (0. 1 Hz, 0. 5 ms, supramaximal voltage) -induced twitch contractions of the muscularis mucosae were not significantly modified by substance P (0. 01 - 0. 3 microM).

40|$|We have {{prepared}} 125 I-labeled physalaemin and {{have examined the}} kinetics, stoichiometry, and chemical specificity with which the labeled peptide binds to dispersed acini from guinea pig pancreas. Binding of 125 I-labeled physalaemin was saturable, temperature-dependent, and reversible and reflected interaction of the labeled peptide with a single class of binding sites on the plasma membrane of pancreatic acinar cells. Each acinar cell possessed approximately 500 binding sites, and binding of the tracer to these sites could be inhibited by physalaemin [concentration for half-maximal effect (Kd), 2 nM], substance P (Kd, 5 nM), or <b>eledoisin</b> (Kd, 300 nM) but not by cholecystokinin, caerulein, bombesin, litorin, gastrin, secretin, vasoactive intestinal peptide, glucagon, somatostatin, neurotensin, bovine pancreatic polypeptide, leucine-enkephalin, methionine-enkephalin, atropine, or carbamylcholine. With physalaemin, substance P, and <b>eledoisin,</b> there was a close correlation between the relative potency for inhibition of binding of labeled physalaemin and that for stimulation of amylase secretion. For a given peptide, however, a 3 -fold higher concentration was required for half-maximal inhibition of binding than for half-maximal stimulation of amylase secretion, calcium outflux, or cyclic GMP accumulation. These results indicate that dispersed acini from guinea pig pancreas possess a single class of receptors that interact with physalaemin, substance P, and <b>eledoisin</b> and that occupation of 45 % of these receptors will cause a maximal biological response...|$|E
40|$|The hyperalgesic {{effect of}} intrathecally {{administered}} substance P (SP), physalaemin, <b>eledoisin</b> and eledoisin-related peptide (ERP) {{was investigated in}} the rat tail flick test. Hyperalgesia produced by SP (2. 5 - 15 micrograms, 1. 9 - 11 nmol) was maximal 10 - 20 min after injection, lasted 30 min and was dose-related. The effect was mimicked {{by all of the}} peptides examined. The rank order of potency was physalaemin greater than SP greater than <b>eledoisin</b> greater than ERP. Desensitization to the hyperalgesic effect of SP was produced by three repeated intrathecal injections. Rats desensitized to SP no longer responded to physalaemin or ERP, indicating cross-desensitization. Phentolamine continued to produce hyperalgesia following such desensitization. The demonstration of a hyperalgesic effect for SP provides further support for a role for SP in nociceptive transmission. The receptor mediating this effect appears to be a SP-P subtype. Cross-desensitization between peptides suggests an action on the same receptor...|$|E
40|$|The {{present study}} {{investigated}} the sensitivity of 12 forebrain and midbrain structures to the antidipsogenic effect of <b>eledoisin,</b> physalaemin and substance P on angiotensin-induced drinking. The three tachykinins elicited the most potent effects when injected into the nucleus preopticus medialis, the nucleus anterior hypothalami and the subfornical organ. In other sites (nuclei lateralis, ventromedialis and posterior hypothalami, nucleus septi lateralis, nucleus interpeduncularis and substantia grisea periventricularis) the effect was lower, {{and most of these}} sites showed different sensitivity to the three tachykinins. Finally, the nucleus septi medialis, the nucleus preopticus lateralis and the substantia nigra were refractory to the three tachykinins. These results show that: (1) the antidipsogenic effect of tachykinins can be elicited not only in forebrain, but also in midbrain structures such as the substantia grisea periventricularis and the nucleus interpeduncularis; (2) the distribution of brain sites sensitive to the antidipsogenic effect of substance P and physalaemin is always overlapping, while this is not true for <b>eledoisin.</b> This probably reflects selective distribution and/or activation of distinct subtypes of tachykinin receptors...|$|E

40|$|Background: To {{evaluate}} {{the effects of}} an eye drop containing eleidosin and carnitine in patients suffering from primary open-angle glaucoma (POAG) and ocular discomfort syndrome secondary to a chronically treated with eye drops containing benzalkonium chloride (BAK) as preservative. The dry eye disease {{was defined as a}} multifactorial drop disease concerning tears and ocular surface which brings to discomfort symptoms and visual disorders with potential damage to the ocular surface. Several studies underlined the beneficial effects of secretagogues drugs, such as <b>eledoisin.</b> It is a neuro-peptide extracted from the salivary glands of some shellfishes. Recently it has been also showed the protective role of carnitine in respect of the ocular surface exposed to the tear film hyperosmolarity. Materials and methods: This randomized double-blind pilot study has been evaluated by lubricant eye drop solutions containg <b>eledoisin</b> and carnitine in 40 patients with ocular discomfort syndrome secondary to POAG, since that the patients were chronically treated with eye drops which decrease eye pressure and contain BAK as preservative. The subjects filled out a questions form concerning the severity of the symptoms and their impact on daily activities. Subsequently Fluorescein Break-Up Time (FBUT), Schirmer Test 1 (ST), and Ocular Protection Index (OPI) were measured at baseline and after 15 days of treatment. Results: At the end of therapy it was possible to match the beneficial effects of eye drops with carnitin, taurine, sodium hyaluronate and <b>eledoisin.</b> In fact, after 15 days of treatment, patients of group 1 showed a decrease of approximately 50 % concerning the severity of symptoms and a significant improvement of the tests valued.

The hypotensive effect of NKA was slightly smaller in SHR, but no significant strain difference was observed. The NK- 2 -selective agonist [beta Ala 8]NKA(4 - 10) was a very weak hypotensive agent in WKY rats, while being completely inactive in SHR. The NK- 3 -selective agonists [Asp 5, 6,MePhe 8]substance P(5 - 11) and [MePhe 7]NKB did not modify blood pressure in both strains. Heart rate was essentially unmodified following the NK- 3 agonists, while it was increased after injection of substance P, [Sar 9,Met(O 2) 11]substance P, and neurokinin A, the increase being greater in WKY than in SHR. Surprisingly, <b>eledoisin</b> increased heart rate in SHR, but not in WKY rats, despite the greater hypotensive effect elicited in the latter strain. The present results confirm that the hypotensive effect of peripheral TKs is mediated by NK- 1 receptors and show that SHR are less sensitive than WKY rats to this effect...|$|E

Intraperitoneal {{injection of}} kassinin elicited drinking, but at doses about 1000 X larger than the i. c. v. ones. The angiotensin antagonist [Sar 1, Leu 8]angiotensin II did not reduce drinking induced by i. c. v. kassinin, suggesting that its effect is not due to interaction with the central renin-angiotensin system. Moreover, the effect is apparently independent of the mechanisms controlling hypovolaemic and hyperosmotic thirst since exact additivity was found in the dipsogenic response when i. c. v. kassinin was administered {{in the presence of a}} hypovolaemic (subcutaneous (s. c.), polyethylene glycol) or hyperosmotic (s. c. hypertonic NaCl) dipsogenic stimulus. The present findings show that kassinin, neurokinin A and B share with the tachykinins already tested (<b>eledoisin,</b> physalaemin, substance P) a common dipsogenic action in pigeons. However, marked differences exist in their dipsogenic potency.

40|$|The {{musculature}} of the Fallopian tube is hyperactive {{during the}} time of ovu-lation, but the mechanism which activates the tube is obscure. A humoral regulation of tubal motility is more probable than a nervous one, although it is not known to what extent biogenic compounds (tissue hormones) can stimulate the tubes. We have investigated this question on a quantitative pharmacological basis using eighty-four human tubes on the day of removal. Strips were cut from the infundibular end and suspended in 10 ml Krebs-Henseleit solution at 32 =deg and aerated with carbogen. The contractions of the preparations were recorded isotonically on smoked paper. The experiments were designed to yield dose-response curves from which the EC 50 -values and other parameters mentioned in Table 1 were determined.

Neurokinin B produced some features of the serotonin (5 -HT) syndrome, while substance P, neurokinin A and <b>eledoisin</b> failed to elicit any such behaviours. Senktide-induced head twitches were prevented by pretreatment with the 5 -HT 2 antagonists ketanserin and ritanserin, while forepaw treading was attenuated by the 5 -HT 1 antagonists (-) -pindolol and methysergide. These data suggest that NK- 3 agonists interact with central 5 -HT mechanisms...|$|E
40|$|The potencies of two tachykinin antagonists [D-Pro 4,D-Trp 7, 9, 10]-SP(4 - 11) and [D-Arg 1,D-Pro 2, D-Trp 7, 9,Leu 11]-SP(1 - 11) against four tachykinins were {{examined}} {{in a range of}} smooth muscle preparations, including guinea-pig ileum and bladder and rat colon muscularis mucosae and duodenum. Parallel shifts in the log dose-response curves of all the tachykinins tested were observed in all tissues, except {{in the case of the}} guinea-pig bladder where [D-Pro 4, D-Trp 7, 9, 10]-SP(4 - 11) was without effect at concentrations up to 32 microM. The slopes of the Schild plots for the two antagonists did not differ significantly from unity, with the exception of [D-Pro 4, D-Trp 7, 9, 10]-SP(4 - 11) in the rat duodenum, which may indicate a heterogeneous receptor population in this tissue. The antagonists displayed agonist selectivity in the case of the guinea-pig ileum where log dose-response curves to substance P and physalaemin were shifted less than those to <b>eledoisin</b> and kassinin. Rank orders of potency for <b>eledoisin,</b> kassinin, physalaemin and substance P in the five preparations studied allowed classification of the tissues by the predominant receptor type according to the 'SP-P' and 'SP-E' scheme. It is concluded that [D-Pro 4, D-Trp 7, 9, 10]-SP(4 - 11), in particular, displays tissue selectivity that may indicate different receptor populations, but classification of receptor and tissue types on this basis does not fully correspond with classifications based on agonist potencies. Such schemes should therefore be treated with caution at this stage...|$|E
40|$|In {{recent years}} {{interest}} in the production and description of kinin-type substances has been greatly intensified. So, for example, bradykinin, phyllokinin, physalaemin, ranatensin and caerulein could be extracted from the skin of amphibians as well as. <b>eledoisin</b> out of the salivary glands of Eledon moschata. An examination of lampreys seemed to us particularly profitable {{in the search for}} the incidence of further kinins. Ammocoetes of different sizes and also adults of both sexes of the species Eudontomyzon danfordi vladykovi were studied in this research. This species is found in many tributaries of the Danube. Skin extracts were tested on on isolated rat uterus, rat duodenum, guinea pig ileum and rabbit jejunum, further tests were done in order to determine a peptide character of the biologically active substance...|$|E
40|$|Residues in {{transmembrane domain}} (TM) -III, TM-V, TM-VI, and TM-VII {{believed}} to be facing the deep part of the presumed main ligand-binding pocket of the NK 1 receptor were probed by alanine substitution and introduction of residues with larger and/or chemically distinct side chains. Unaltered or even im-proved binding affinity for four peptide agonists, substance P, substance P-O-methyl ester, <b>eledoisin,</b> and neurokinin A, as well as normal EC 50 values for substance P in stimulating phosphatidylinositol turnover indicated that these mutations did not alter the overall functional integrity of the receptor. The alanine substitutions in general had only minor effects on non-peptide antagonist binding. However, {{the introduction of the}} larger and polar aspartic acid and histidine residues at posi-tions corresponding to the monoamine binding aspartic acid i...|$|E
40|$|The tachykinin peptide [Asp 5. 6, MePhe 8]substance P(5 - 11) (NH 2 -senktide), a senktide {{analogue}} {{lacking the}} N-terminal succinyl group, is a selective and metabolically stable NK- 3 receptor agonist. In {{the present study}} it potently inhibited salt appetite induced by sodium depletion in rats. Argo-neurokinin B, too, inhibited salt appetite, but was less potent than NH 2 -senktide. Neither peptide inhibited drinking behaviour induced by subcutaneous hypertonic NaCl. NH 2 -senktide slightly inhibited angiotensin-induced drinking, while Argo-neurokinin B was ineffective. On the other hand, <b>eledoisin</b> was a potent inhibitor in the 3 behavioural tests. Present results indicate that activation of NK- 3 receptors {{is involved in the}} antinatriorexic action of tachykinins, and that different receptor subtypes might be involved in the different effects of tachykinins on the rat ingestive behaviour...|$|E
40|$|Capsaicin at low {{concentrations}} {{increases the}} {{short circuit current}} (SCC) across frog skin. Simultaneous measurements of both transepithelial fluxes of 22 Na or 36 Cl demonstrate that the SCC increase is due to stimulation of sodium active absorption. Capsaicin acts through the liberation of several peptides; thus these peptides were tested on the SCC across frog skin. Those more active are, in order of potency: Cyclic Calcitonin Gene Related Peptide (CGRP), Kassinin and <b>Eledoisin,</b> Substance P (SP) and Neurokinin A. Neurokinin B and Vasoactive Intestinal Peptide (VIP) have no effect. Also the actions of SP and CGRP are due mainly to stimulation of Na+ active absorption. A strict parallelism regarding the sensitivity to inhibitors (Naproxen, SQ 22536 and CP 96345) between SP, CGRP and Capsaicin strengthens the hypothesis that SP and CGRP are liberated by Capsaicin in this tissue...|$|E
40|$|Abstractα-Bungarotoxin (αBgt) {{was shown}} to inhibit the binding of the 125 I-labeled {{substance}} P (SP) and <b>eledoisin</b> (EL) to the rat brain membranes with K 1 values of 8. 0 ± 5. 0 × 10 − 8 and 1. 1 ± 0. 5 × 10 − 6 M, respectively. Lower inhibitory activity was manifested by several other postsynaptically acting snake venom neurotoxins. The αBgt inhibition of SP binding with a K 1 value of 8. 5 ± 5. 5 × 10 − 8 M to solubilized preparations of the rat brain membranes was demonstrated. The capacity to displace SP was found for d-tubocurarine and phencyclidine, although at concentrations considerably higher than those affecting the nicotinic acetylcholine receptors (AChRs). The results obtained suggest {{that some of the}} αBgt-binding polypeptides, distinct from neuronal AChRs, may be functionally associated with the tachykinin receptors (TchR) ...|$|E
40|$|The tachykinin-dependent {{stimulation}} of ion transport across frog skin was studied. Tachykinin stimulation {{was due to}} interaction with an NK 1 -like receptor as [Sar 9 -Met(O 2) 11]-Substance P (a very selective NK 1 agonist) strongly stimulated SCC, whereas [beta-Ala 8]-Neurokinin A 4 - 10 (a very selective NK 2 agonist) did not. The rank order of tachykinin potency was: PG-KI > Uperolein > Hylambatin > Kassinin > Phyllomedusin > [Sar 9 -Met(O 2) 11]-Substance P > Ranatachykinin A > Physalaemin > Ranakinin > Substance P and <b>Eledoisin</b> > Neurokinin A. Neurokinin B, Scyliorhinin I, Urechistachykinin I and Urechistachykinin II had no effect. We conclude that the minimal structural requirements for stimulating SCC in the frog skin were the presence of: a) the C-terminal sequence Phe-X-Gly-Leu-Met-NH 2; b) at least one Pro residue in the N-terminal sequence...|$|E
40|$|The {{present study}} {{investigated}} the effect on vasopressin release of the intracerebroventricular injection of tachykinins in rats. The selective neurokinin (NK) - 3 receptor agonists [MePhe 7]neurokinin B and [Asp 5, 6 MePhe 8]substance P(5 - 11) evoked vasopressin release. Also <b>eledoisin,</b> physalaemin and kassinin, which show good affinity for central NK- 3 receptors, released vasopressin. On the other hand, neurokinin A, substance P and the selective NK- 1 agonist [Pro 9,Met(O 2) 11]substance P were devoid of activity. At doses releasing vasopressin, central injection of NK- 3 selective agonists and of the natural tachykinins never produced hypotension. Present results indicate that activation of central NK- 3 receptors is involved in vasopressin release induced by tachykinins, and {{rule out the possibility}} that the effect might be consequent to hypotension due to passage of tachykinins into the peripheral circulation...|$|E
