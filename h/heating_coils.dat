25|$|On the air side of HVAC coils a {{significant}} difference exists between those used for heating, and those for cooling. Due to psychrometrics, air that is cooled often has moisture condensing out of it, except with extremely dry air flows. Heating some air increases that airflow's capacity to hold water. So <b>heating</b> <b>coils</b> need not consider moisture condensation on their air-side, but cooling coils must be adequately designed and selected to handle their particular latent (moisture) {{as well as the}} sensible (cooling) loads. The water that is removed is called condensate.|$|E
25|$|The {{movement}} {{of crude oil}} by rail is far from new, but {{it is now a}} rapidly growing market for North American railroads. The growth is driven by several factors. One is that the transmission pipelines from Alberta are operating at or near capacity and companies who cannot get pipeline space have to move oil by rail instead. Another is that many refineries on the east, west, and Gulf coasts of North America are under-served by pipelines since they assumed that they would obtain their oil by ocean tanker. Producers of new oil in Alberta, North Dakota, and West Texas are now shipping oil by rail to coastal refiners who are having difficulty obtaining international oil at prices competitive with those in the interior of North America. In addition, crude bitumen can be loaded directly into tank cars equipped with steam <b>heating</b> <b>coils,</b> avoiding the need for blending it with expensive condensate in order to ship it to market. Tank cars can also be built to transport condensate on the back-haul from refineries to the oil sands to make additional revenue rather than returning empty.|$|E

25|$|One of the {{greatest}} operational problems with an evaporator is the build-up of scale. Its design is tailored to reduce this, and to make its cleaning as effective as possible. The usual design, as developed by Weir and the Admiralty, is for a vertical cylindrical drum, heated by steam-carrying drowned coils in the lower portion. As they are entirely submerged, they avoid the most active region for the deposition of scale, around the waterline. Each coil consists {{of one or two}} spirals in a flat plane. Each coil is easily removed for cleaning, being fastened by individual pipe unions through the side of the evaporator. A large door is also provided, allowing the coils to be removed or replaced. Cleaning may be carried out mechanically, with a manual scaling hammer. This also has a risk of mechanical damage to the tubes, as the slightest pitting tends to act as a nucleus for scale or corrosion. It is also common practice to break light scaling free by thermal shock, by passing steam through the coils without cooling water present or by heating the coils, then introducing cold seawater. In 1957 the trials ship , an obsolete heavy cruiser, was used for the first tests of the 'flexing element' distiller, where non-rigid <b>heating</b> <b>coils</b> flexed continually in service and so broke the scale free as soon as it formed a stiff layer.|$|E

2500|$|On {{the liquid}} side of these heat exchangers, the common fluids are water, a water-glycol solution, steam, or a refrigerant. For <b>heating</b> <b>coils,</b> {{hot water and}} steam are the most common, and this heated fluid is {{supplied}} by boilers, for example. For cooling coils, chilled water and refrigerant are most common. Chilled water is supplied from a chiller that is potentially located very far away, but refrigerant must come from a nearby condensing unit. When a refrigerant is used, the cooling coil is the evaporator in the vapor-compression refrigeration cycle. HVAC coils that use this direct-expansion of refrigerants are commonly called DX coils. [...] Some DX coils are [...] "microchannel" [...] type.|$|E

40|$|The VAV {{terminal}} unit with variable-speed (VS) fan and reheat coil is an air system {{terminal unit}} {{consisting of a}} variable speed fan in series with a <b>heating</b> <b>coil.</b> These units are usually employed in underfloor air distribution (UFAD) systems where the air is supplied at low static pressure through an underfloor plenum. The fan is used to control the flow of conditioned air that enters the space. When the fan is off the plenum pressure drives the minimum air flow through the terminal unit. At maximum cooling the fan runs at its maximum speed. At full heating the fan runs at its heating maximum – usually less than the cooling maximum flow rate. Thus this unit has two separate maximum flow rates – one for heating and one for cooling. For cooling, control is maintained simply by varying the fan speed. For heating, the unit first tries to meet the heating load by varying the <b>heating</b> <b>coil</b> output while keeping the air flow at minimum (fan off). If this is not adequate the fan turns on and operates in variable flow mode up to the heating maximum flow rate. This unit is modeled in EnergyPlus as a compound component – a variable speed fan and a <b>heating</b> <b>coil</b> in series in the air stream. The unit is blow through – the fan is upstream of the <b>heating</b> <b>coil.</b> ...|$|R
