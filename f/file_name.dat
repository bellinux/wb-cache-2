25|$|On May 27, 2010, Microsoft {{released}} Internet Explorer 8 {{optimized for}} Bing and MSN. The <b>file</b> <b>name</b> is BOIE8_ENUS_XP.exe.|$|E
25|$|To {{ensure that}} it {{automatically}} runs every time Windows starts, it drops a copy of itself or its EXE component using a random <b>file</b> <b>name</b> into the %APPDATA% folder.|$|E
40|$|This {{pamphlet}} by the South Carolina Department of Archives and History {{is one in}} {{a series}} titled Electronic Records Management Guidelines. This pamphlet addresses <b>file</b> <b>naming,</b> its uses and legal considerations including differences among <b>file</b> <b>names,</b> <b>file</b> paths, and addresses, challenges in <b>file</b> <b>naming</b> and Internet <b>file</b> <b>naming</b> protocols...|$|R
50|$|A user named 'torvalds' {{creates a}} <b>file</b> <b>named</b> 'tekken' under the {{directory}} named 'videogames'. A user named 'wozniak' attempts to delete the <b>file</b> <b>named</b> 'tekken' but he cannot, {{since he is}} not the owner.|$|R
50|$|Such usage {{is similar}} to {{multiword}} <b>file</b> <b>names</b> written for operating systems and applications that are confused by embedded space codes - such <b>file</b> <b>names</b> instead use an underscore (_) as a word separator, as_in_this_phrase.|$|R
25|$|A new {{major version}} of Dolphin shipped with KDE Applications 4.8. It has {{improved}} performance, better <b>file</b> <b>name</b> display, animated transitions, {{and many other}} new and improved features.|$|E
25|$|Mail {{transfer}} mode uses Netascii transfer, but the file {{is sent to}} an email recipient by specifying that recipient's email address as the <b>file</b> <b>name.</b> RFC 1350 declared this mode of transfer obsolete.|$|E
25|$|A {{filename}} (also {{written as}} two words, <b>file</b> <b>name)</b> {{is a name}} used to uniquely identify a computer file stored in a file system. Different file systems impose different restrictions on filename lengths and the allowed characters within filenames.|$|E
50|$|In many {{operating}} systems, {{programs have}} an associated working directory {{in which they}} execute. Typically, <b>file</b> <b>names</b> accessed by the program are assumed to reside within this directory if the <b>file</b> <b>names</b> are not specified with an explicit directory name.|$|R
50|$|On {{some old}} systems a <b>file</b> <b>named</b> {{networks}} is present that has similar to hosts <b>file</b> functions containing <b>names</b> of networks.|$|R
40|$|The dataset {{consists}} of 6 Zipped files and a Technical Report detailing the project. The original {{images from the}} drone survey are contained in the <b>files</b> <b>names</b> Images 1, Images 2, Images 3 and Images 4. The 3 D mesh model files are contained in the <b>file</b> <b>named</b> 3 d_mesh. The data points for the point cloud are contained in the <b>file</b> <b>named</b> point_cloud. A visualisation of the 3 D point cloud can be created using Potree: a free opensource webgl based point cloud renderer for large point clouds,? [URL]...|$|R
25|$|The DOS file {{names are}} in the current OEM {{character}} set: this can have surprising effects if characters handled in one way for a given code page are interpreted differently for another code page (DOS command CHCP) with respect to lower and upper case, sorting, or validity as <b>file</b> <b>name</b> character.|$|E
25|$|When {{renaming}} a file, {{even when}} extensions are being displayed, Explorer highlights only the filename without selecting the extension. Renaming multiple files is quicker as pressing Tab automatically renames the existing file or folder {{and opens the}} <b>file</b> <b>name</b> text field for the next file for renaming. Shift+Tab allow renaming {{in the same manner}} upwards.|$|E
25|$|Each {{disk drive}} was {{identified}} by a drive letter, for example drive A and drive B. To {{refer to a}} file on a specific drive, the drive letter was prefixed to the <b>file</b> <b>name,</b> separated by a colon, e.g. A:FILE.TXT. With no drive letter prefixed, access was to files on the current default drive.|$|E
50|$|The {{titles are}} taken from the Flash-video <b>file</b> <b>names.</b>|$|R

2500|$|Most popular {{command-line}} interfaces and scripting languages cannot easily handle <b>file</b> <b>names</b> {{that contain}} embedded spaces (usually requiring {{the name to}} be put in quotes). Therefore, users of those systems often resort to camel case (or underscores, hyphens and other [...] "safe" [...] characters) for compound <b>file</b> <b>names</b> like MyJobResume.pdf.|$|R
25|$|Each {{object is}} {{identified}} by a SHA-1 hash of its contents. Git computes the hash, and uses this {{value for the}} object's name. The object is put into a directory matching the first two characters of its hash. The rest of the hash is used as the <b>file</b> <b>name</b> for that object.|$|E
25|$|Donkey, often {{known by}} its <b>file</b> <b>name</b> DONKEY.BAS, is a {{computer}} game written in 1981 and included with early versions of the PC DOS operating system distributed with the original IBM PC. It is a driving game in which the player must avoid hitting donkeys. The game was written by Microsoft co-founder Bill Gates and Neil Konzen.|$|E
25|$|Due to the {{limitations}} of <b>file</b> <b>name</b> length and format, both the GNU and BSD variants devised different methods of storing long filenames. Although the common format does not suffer from the year 2038 problem, many implementations of the ar utility do and {{may need to be}} modified in the future to handle correctly timestamps in excess of 2147483647.|$|E

25|$|Because file {{names have}} to be {{exchanged}} between software environments (think network file transfer, file system storage, backup and file synchronization software, configuration management, data compression and archiving, etc.), {{it is very important}} not to lose <b>file</b> <b>name</b> information between applications. This led to wide adoption of Unicode as a standard for encoding file names, although legacy software might be non-Unicode-aware.|$|E
25|$|The generic URL (Uniform Resource Locator) syntax {{allows for}} a query string to be {{appended}} to a <b>file</b> <b>name</b> in a web address so that additional information can be passed to a script; the question mark, or query mark, ?, is used to indicate {{the start of a}} query string. A query string is usually made up of a number of different name–value pairs, each separated by the ampersand symbol, &. For example, http://www.example.com/login.php?username=test=blank.|$|E
25|$|If {{there are}} {{multiple}} LFN entries, required to represent a <b>file</b> <b>name,</b> firstly comes the last LFN entry (the {{last part of the}} filename). The sequence number also has bit 6 (0x40) set (this means the last LFN entry, however it's the first entry seen when reading the directory file). The last LFN entry has the largest sequence number which decreases in following entries. The first LFN entry has sequence number 1. A value of 0xE5 is used to indicate that the entry is deleted.|$|E
50|$|The above command {{uses the}} null {{character}} to delimit <b>file</b> <b>names.</b>|$|R

25|$|Compiled CIL code {{is stored}} in CLI assemblies. As {{mandated}} by the specification, assemblies are stored in Portable Executable (PE) file format, common on Windows platform for all dynamic-link library (DLL) and executable EXE files. Each assembly consists {{of one or more}} files, one of which must contain a manifest bearing the metadata for the assembly. The complete name of an assembly (not {{to be confused with the}} <b>file</b> <b>name</b> on disk) contains its simple text name, version number, culture, and public key token. Assemblies are considered equivalent if they share the same complete name.|$|E
25|$|A GIMP plug-in for {{creating}} animations. GAP can save animations in several formats, including GIF and AVI. The animation function relies on GIMP's layering and image <b>file</b> <b>name</b> numbering capability. Animations are created either by placing each frame {{on its own}} layer (in other words, treating each layer as an animation cel), or by manipulating each numbered file {{as if it were}} a frame in the video: moving, rotating, flipping, changing colors, applying filters, etc. to the layers by taking advantage of interpolation within function calls(plug-in usage), within a specified frame range. The resulting project can be saved as an animated GIF or encoded video file. GAP also provides programmed layer transitions, frame rate change, and move paths, allowing the creation of sophisticated animations.|$|E
25|$|Some filesystems {{restrict}} {{the length of}} filenames. In some cases, these lengths apply to the entire <b>file</b> <b>name,</b> as in 44 characters on IBM S/370. In other cases, the length limits may apply to particular portions of the filename, such as {{the name of a}} file in a directory, or a directory name. For example, 9 (e.g., 8-bit FAT in Standalone Disk BASIC), 11 (e.g. FAT12, FAT16, FAT32 in DOS), 14 (e.g. early Unix), 21 (Human68K), 31, 30 (e.g. Apple DOS 3.2 and 3.3), 15 (e.g. Apple ProDOS), 44 (e.g. IBM S/370), or 255 (e.g. early Berkeley Unix) characters or bytes. Length limits often result from assigning fixed space in a filesystem to storing components of names, so increasing limits often requires an incompatible change, as well as reserving more space.|$|E
