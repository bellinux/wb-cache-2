The judges knew very well, therefore, that if they should do what the king required of them, and then, if the friends of Lady Jane should fail of establishing her upon the throne, the end of the affair would be the cutting off of their own heads in the Tower. They represented this to the king, and begged to be excused from the duty that he required of them. Northumberland was in a great rage at this, and seemed almost ready to break out against the judges in open violence.

40|$|Ohara is {{the name}} given to the {{northern}} part of Kyoto, which was an area that traditionally supplied firewood to downtown Kyoto before World War II. There are a few old documents covering the economic history of the forestry sector in Ohara. Previous articles have introduced documents related to (1) the production and sale of fi rewood from the Edo Period to the early Meiji Period and (2) Kimura Sohemon, the Governor of the forests in Ohara through the Edo Period {{and the beginning of the}} Meiji Period. This article (3) introduces documents related to forest ownership by temples. In Ohara, there were two dominant temples in the Edo Period: the Shorinin and Raigoin temples. Each temple governed large areas of forest in Ohara during the Edo Period. This paper introduces old documents related to forest ownership by the temples, especially Shorinin. These documents are divided into three groups. Documents 1 to 4 are memoranda on the forest owned by Shorinin. These four documents were bound together, and only Document 2 includes the year 1752. Document 1 shows the location of the forests that Shorinin governed, with information on the dates when Shorinin obtained the forests and who Shorinin obtained them from. It also includes the amount of forest tax by location. Document 2 shows the number of forests that Shorinin owned in 1752. Document 3 outlines gifts from both temples to Kimura Sohemon. Document 4 shows the specifi c trees under the scrutiny of Kimura Sohemon; these were located within the forests governed by Shorinin. Documents 5 to 25 are <b>deeds</b> <b>of</b> <b>assignment</b> for the forest. In these deeds, the new forest owner is primarily Shorinin or temples affi liated with Shorinin. The years recorded range from 1724 to 1842. Over this period, the area of forest governed by Shorinin increased. The documents also include the amount of forest tax paid to Kimura Sohemon. Documents 26 to 62 are receipts of the forest tax,which the Shorinin and Raigoin temples paid to Kimura Sohemon, the governor of forests, from 1731 to 1835. As the amount paid by the two temples is combined, only a trend regarding the amount paid can be identifi ed. The total amount paid increased to about 1. 5 times the starting amount over the course of 104 years. It is possible that the area of forest governed by the two temples increased proportionally during this period...|$|R

40|$|Documents {{issued in}} one country often have to be legalised (authenticated) {{before they can be}} used in another country. Different types of {{documents}} (legal papers) such as birth, death and marriage records, <b>deeds</b> <b>of</b> <b>assignments,</b> powers <b>of</b> attorney, commercial invoices etc. need to be legalised by the Destination Country before they can be assumed legal. Legalising a document simply means confirming that official documents are sealed and signed either with an Apostille Certificate for countries {{that are part of the}} Hague convention 1961, or with a Certificate of Authentication where countries are not party to The Hague Convention. Legalising (authenticating) documents is a process of verification of signatures. The aim of this research is to critically examine the current processes of document legalisation, through analysing and establishing the opportunities that lie before the organisation to implement a new process in document legalisation to replace the prolonged historical process currently used in some countries, specifically the United Arab Emirates (UAE). Using enterprise network technology 1, this research will also produce a solution to the risks involved, the implementation and the security, and it will also analyse the impact of such implementation to the organisation. Considering the project, which explores a very sensitive area in the organisation and one of major change to the organisation’s business process, the authenticity of data must be given a high priority. Therefore, an online survey may not always be a legitimate approach. A paper survey may well fit the purpose but, on the other hand, a detailed interview and/ or telephone survey will be even more accurate. Hence I made use of a mixed method (qualitative/ quantitative) approach. The business of document legalisation goes back in history by more than two thousand years and, therefore, needs to be explored historically, establishing how the business of the document legalisation process has evolved alongside the established professions in government today, and defining the areas of concern such as security, availability, traceability and mobility. This will pave the way for an investigation to evaluate a new process that can utilise available technology to solve the areas of concern. The current process of Document Legalisation has been used for many years and a change in this process may take some time. There are many possible pitfalls that the programme may encounter, one of which is the change to a process that has not yet been established in any other area of the world, so there are no other occurrences in this subject for comparison. A clear and informative document explaining the project – a Specific, Measurable, Achievable, Realistic and Time Limit (SMART) description of the project – will solve any conflict. Considering that the research in th is complex topic runs in history for more than two thousand years, a mixed method approach should be used. However, to elaborate the methodology that can explore the underlying philosophical assumption taken by researchers a mixed methodology term should be more accurate, due to the history and composition of knowledge that have been accumulated in this topic. Hence clarification is needed to establish reasons and define a new approach in the document legalisation process. In addition to the historical literature, the main groups taken into consideration to form the data are the decision makers, interviews with senior staff and a survey for employees working in the field of document legalisation. To find reasons for every step in document legalisation, experiments should not be ignored. The reason for this is to clarify the area of data mismatch. The scope of the project will discuss the current risk involved in the current process of legalising documents, identifying its weaknesses, and the needs and requirements of the newly proposed process with recommendations to establish a solution utilising state of the art technology to provide a new secure, mobile and traceable process which is available 24 / 7...|$|R
