5|$|Reflecting Archaeoastronomy's {{development}} as an <b>interdisciplinary</b> <b>subject,</b> {{research in the}} field is conducted by investigators trained {{in a wide range of}} disciplines. Authors of recent doctoral dissertations have described their work as concerned with the fields of archaeology and cultural anthropology; with various fields of history including the history of specific regions and periods, the history of science and the history of religion; and with the relation of astronomy to art, literature and religion. Only rarely did they describe their work as astronomical, and then only as a secondary category.|$|E

His central argument was that physical geography, market economics and anthropology were related, yielding a “single chord of social life [...] all three combined”. Thus the <b>interdisciplinary</b> <b>subject</b> of sociology was developed into the science of “man’s interaction with a natural environment: the basic technique was the regional survey, and the improvement of town planning the chief practical application of sociology".|$|E

40|$|An {{increasing}} number of scientists of different fields is working together in <b>interdisciplinary</b> <b>subjects.</b> For school science {{it is difficult to}} bring these interdisciplinary developments into the classroom. Pupils thus get an outdated view of science and of possibilities in science and technology for their future career. Also there are indications that <b>interdisciplinary</b> <b>subjects</b> are more attractive to pupils than classical science subjects, even more so for females. In the Netherlands one remedy for this is {{the development of a new}} interdisciplinary subject: NLT (Natuur, Leven en Technologie). This subject is offered to science stream pupils in senior secondary schools in addition to the regular subjects physics, chemistry, biology and mathematics. A set of more than 50 modules is being developed as teaching materials for national use. Each module is developed by a team in which teachers of secondary schools and an expert of the subject work together. However this does not automatically lead to good teaching materials. For this reason a quality control procedure was developed for all NLT modules. In this procedure, teachers, pupils, scientists and science education experts all play a role in the evaluation of draft modules. The results of such a multi-perspective evaluation procedure are promising...|$|R

40|$|The paper {{addresses}} {{issues in}} establishing a user-friendly systematic collection arrangement following a merger of two {{high school and college}} library collections classified according to UDC. In the way it was used, this scheme presented some weaknesses with respect to collection usage. Due to the disciplinary nature of UDC, subjects and phenomena are dispersed in the scheme according to the disciplines in which they are the subject of study. At the same time students in a school library often seek <b>interdisciplinary</b> <b>subjects</b> and need access to clusters of documents which according to UDC may be classed in several different knowledge areas. The author illustrates how this problem was resolved by re-arranging the collection according to phenomena. This was achieved by interpreting UDC numbers as if they represented specific phenomena. Thus, by superimposing some local indexing rules onto a disciplinary knowledge organization system it was possible to collocate <b>interdisciplinary</b> <b>subjects</b> under a single class number. Furthermore, by reversing subject numbers and form auxiliaries (atlases, dictionaries, textbooks etc.) which is an option envisaged in the design of UDC, documents were collocated in the way they are most frequently used by students. The author suggests that, in practice, one often needs to overcome the constraints of disciplinary classification and he discusses the approach used in his school library collection...|$|R
