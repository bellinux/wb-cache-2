The main reason for choosing such a subject is contributing to analyse Kadi (Moslem judges) records of Bursa which had never been investigated before. Furthermore, it is aimed to analyse the physical, administrative, social and economic position of Hüdâvendigâr Region in Ottoman History. In this research the above-mentioned records are transcripted and analysed. In addition to this, the literature is investigated. First of all some information is given about Ottoman government and Hüdâvendigâr Region {{at the end of}} XVI. century, according to native and foreign investigators. After this Kadi records are analysed and then the importance and contents of records are explained. At the end, these records are transcripted. As a result; 1 - The administrative organization in this region is a sample of centralizative policy that is used by the government on the provinces. The administrative units of the Sultans are Sancakbeyi (Chief of subdivision of province), Tımarlı Sipahi (cavalry soldiers), Subaşı (police superintendents), Emin (superintendents) and the judgment units are Kadi (Moslem <b>judges).</b> These <b>units</b> with their assistants form the administrative group in provinces (sancak) and towns (kaza). 2 - Bursa, Kite, İznik and Yenişehir towns of the Hüdâvendigâr Region are the free fief towns of Sultan's properties (hâs). The management of these towns are given to Bursa Hâssa Harcı Emini. The main income of the people as townsman, villager or nomads comes from agricultural and industrial production and trading their products. 3 - There is no difference as social status between the Moslem non-Moslem people. Societies being managed in compliance with the Moslem religious and conventional laws. Moreover some advantages are given to non-Moslem people. The administrative class and the public problems in social life solved by Kadi (Moslem judge). 4 - At that time {{it can be seen that}} rebellion events that are called as [...] ...|$|R

40|$|The {{first chapter}} {{presents}} the geological and geomorphological {{framework of the}} Lower Tagus Tertiary Basin and the aims of this work. The chapter also describes all the previous work in the region. The second chapter starts the presentation and describes the methodologies and the techniques used to treat the data obtained during the field work. To describe clearly the stratigraphic sequence {{it is necessary to}} mention the significance of allostratigraphy and lithostratigraphy; comparing tectosedimentary units ("UTS") to depositional sequences (DS) in scalar terms, taking account of the relationships to the tectonism and to the eustatism. The techniques in this work are dominated by the profiles and the panel logs. These are prepared photographically using the Miall lithofacies code to describe sedimentological features. The spatial and temporal sequence of the associations of facies have made it possible to define the many depositional systems present in the sedimentogenesis of the Tagus Basin, by the operational meaning of the "architectural element". 1. The first sediments of the Lower Tagus Tertiary basin infill sinkings originated from horst/graben structure. This structuration results from tensional reworking of the NE-SW hercynian faults, by the suborthogonal orientation of the minimum stresses of the pyrenean stress acting on those faults. From here, was responsible for the separation of the Mondego and Tagus Basins from the Lusitanian Basin. This structural development occurred probably from eocene following the Prepyrenean and Pyrenean phases of the Alpine orogeny. This first stage is identified with the Gres de Monsanto which is less than 100 m thick. It probably ranges from the middle or upper Eocene to the oligocene. 2. The second stage is still a tensional phase. It is situated between the "Castelhana"(#approx# 30 M a) and "Inter-vallesian" (#approx# 10. 5 M a) "ruptures". The major infilling of the basin occurred during this stage building up 400 m to 1200 m of sediments <b>judging</b> by the <b>units</b> Arenitos de Ota and Argilas de Tomar/Calcarios de Almoster. This second stage ranges from the Lower Miocene {{to the base of the}} Upper Miocene (upper Vallesian) [...] Available from Fundacao para a Ciencia e a Tecnologia, Servico de Informacao e Documentacao, Av.
