Although {{he was a}} Liberal, {{he was not the}} {{official}} Liberal candidate, but once elected, took the Liberal whip in the House of Commons. He {{was a member of the}} London School Board (Finsbury), from 1888-90. While MP for Camborne, Conybeare, who was nicknamed the [...] "Miners' Friend", proposed changes to mining legislation including:(a) changes to the Stannaries Act, aimed at ending the system whereby miners had their pay shared out in a public house, and at protecting miners from mine agents who randomly broke contracts of <b>employment,</b> (<b>b)</b> renewal of China-clay leases and (c) the introduction of a mines' inspector drawn from working miners, aimed at reducing the mortality in Cornish mines, which was higher among Cornish miners due to [...] "unsanitary conditions". In 1889, Conybeare was imprisoned in Derry Jail for helping to distribute bread to destitute, evicted Irish tenants at Falcarragh, Donegal, which was regarded then as a criminal act under the Irish Coercion Act of 1887. He lost his seat in 1895 and failed in his attempt to be elected at St Helens in 1900. Conybeare was interested in women's suffrage and was a member of the Men's League for Women's Suffrage. In 1910 he made another unsuccessful attempt to re-enter parliament, standing as Liberal candidate at Horncastle. In 1914 he was chosen as Liberal candidate for Wells for the general election expected to take place in 1915, however, the outbreak of war postponed the elections and he never stood for parliament again.|$|E

40|$|Workers in {{flexible}} staffing arrangements—including temporary agency, direct-hire temporary, on-call, {{and contract}} workers—are {{much less likely}} than regular, direct-hire employees to be covered by laws mandating or regulating workplace benefits. Workers in such arrangements, in turn, are {{much less likely to}} receive pension, health insurance, and other benefits on the job. This paper documents these differences in coverage by benefits regulations and differences in benefits receipt. The paper also reviews evidence on the incentives employers have to use workers in these various flexible staffing arrangements. Although reducing benefits costs is not the only reason employers use flexible staffing arrangements, it is an important factor motivating many employers to use them, and te level of and growth in these arrangements would be lower in the absence of this incentive.

The 1930s [...] "encouraged women to fulfill what Stalin termed the [...] "great and honorable duty that nature has given" [...] them. Evident in the Soviet Union, [...] "an officially sponsored cult of motherhood, buttressed by anti-abortion legislation" [...] accompanied by a [...] "depression of living standards" [...] led to industry's immense demand for laborers which got women into the industrial workforce in unprecedented numbers". Urban women thus found themselves assuming the [...] "double burden" [...] (also known as the [...] "double shift") of waged {{work outside the home}} and the lion's share of unpaid labor within it." [...] The Second World War is typically seen as a catalyst for increasing female <b>employment.</b> <b>Best</b> exemplified by [...] Rosie the Riveter propaganda of an efficient, patriotic, woman worker, World War II increased demand for female labor to replace that of the [...] "16million men mobilized to serve in the Armed Forces". While a substantial number of women worked in war factories, the majority of jobs were in the service sector.

30|$|The {{variables}} {{for the analysis}} are constructed as follows. A plant’s revenue is its value of shipments deflated to 1987 dollars using 4 -digit SIC level industry price deflators from the NBER-CES Manufacturing Industry Database based on the 1987 SIC code definitions. 7 The deflated value added is also calculated as an alternative measure of revenue, which {{is used in the}} model’s estimation. Employment is a plant’s total number of workers engaged in production and non-production activities. The main wage variable, the total wage bill, is deflated to 1987 dollars using CPI from Bureau of Labor Statistics. Using a plant’s deflated revenue, its deflated wage bill, and its employment, three ratios were constructed for each plant-CM wave observation: (a) the average wage – the ratio of the total wage bill to <b>employment,</b> (<b>b)</b> labor productivity – the ratio of revenue to employment, and (c) the ratio of the total wage bill to revenue, equivalent to the ratio of (a) to (b). The empirical analysis describes the life-cycle evolutions of these three ratios.|$|E
40|$|Why did {{services}} {{become the}} dominant sector in industrialized economies? While abundant literature exists on the transition from agriculture to industry (i. e., the indus-trial revolution), there is no consensual explanation for the second wave of structural change. I argue that sectoral differences in regulation affecting the degree of com-petition in labor and goods markets explain: (a) {{the rise in the}} service sector share of output and <b>employment,</b> (<b>b)</b> international differences in sectoral structure, and (c) changes in relative sectoral wages. Using evidence on market imperfections, I cali-brate a two-sector model where household unions bargain with firms for wages. The least competitive sector pays higher wages, and employment is restricted accordingly. The model produces time series consistent with the service revolution as it happened in the Unites States and European economies between 1950 and 2000. In particular, while generating changes in shares of output and employment, the model offers an explanation for relative wage differences, which the standard literature misses.

A descriptive survey was used to collect data from 58 students enrolled in a “Leadership Programs in Agriculture ” course.

Significant positive relationships were found between participation in department clubs and leadership skills. Based on the findings, it was recommended that students be provided with opportunities for involvement in community activities and college departmental organizations. Introduction/Theoretical Framework In recent years, colleges of agriculture across the United States have initiated different forms of leadership courses in order to meet business and industry’s changing needs of the 21 st century.

The analysis also points out the ways in which participants orient themselves to a dilemma of stake and accountability, being concerned to position themselves as effortful subjects, while they are rhetorically constructing the banal regime of precarious labour.

We find that changes in the legal minimum wage affect only those workers whose initial wage (before the change in minimum wages) is close to the minimum. For example, increases in the legal minimum wage lead to significant increases in the wages and decreases in employment of private covered sector workers who have wages within 20 % of the minimum wage before the change, but have no significant impact on wages {{in other parts of the}} distribution. The estimates from the employment transition equations suggest that the decrease in covered private sector employment is due to a combination of layoffs and reductions in hiring. Most workers who lose their jobs in the covered private sector as a result of higher legal minimum wages leave the labor force or go into unpaid family work; a smaller proportion find work in the public sector. Our analysis of the relationship between the minimum wage and household income finds: a) increases in legal minimum wages increase the probability that a poor worker's family will move out of poverty, and b) increases in legal minimum wages are more likely to reduce the incidence of poverty if they impact the head of the household rather than the non-head. poverty, minimum wages, employment...|$|E
