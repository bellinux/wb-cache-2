25|$|A nuclear {{meltdown}} is {{a severe}} nuclear reactor accident {{that results in}} reactor core damage from overheating. It {{has been defined as}} the accidental melting of the core of a nuclear reactor, and refers to the core's either complete or partial collapse. A core melt accident occurs when the heat generated by a nuclear reactor exceeds the heat removed by the cooling systems to the point where at least one nuclear fuel element exceeds its melting point. This differs from a fuel element failure, which is not caused by high temperatures. A meltdown may be caused by a loss of coolant, loss of coolant pressure, or low coolant flow rate or be the result of a criticality excursion in which the reactor is operated at a power level that exceeds its design limits. Alternately, in a reactor plant such as the RBMK-1000, an <b>external</b> <b>fire</b> may endanger the core, leading to a meltdown.|$|E

40|$|Fire {{is among}} the most {{dangerous}} accident scenarios that may affect process industry. Vessels containing pressurized liquefied gases are vulnerable to <b>external</b> <b>fires,</b> which can cause the vessel failure and a significant escalation of accident severity. Passive Fire Protection (PFP) may be a robust and effective solution to reduce the probability of accident escalation. The behaviour assessment of the material exposed to fire is a critical issue for determining the effectiveness of the PFP system. In the present study, an approach to the assessment of the effectiveness of PFP systems is presented. The approach integrates experimental results (Thermogravimetric Analysis and lab-scale furnace tests) and Finite Element Modelling (FEM). This allowed predicting the expected behaviour of real scale pressurized tanks engulfed by fires. Preliminary results evidenced that the time to failure is clearly increased by PFP coating, but a detailed model for PFP properties prediction is required to enhance the results...|$|R

40|$|Methyl ethyl ketone {{peroxide}} (MEKPO) possesses complex structures {{which have}} caused many incidents involving fires or explosions by mixing with incompatible substances, <b>external</b> <b>fires,</b> and others. In this study, reactivities or incompatibilities of MEKPO with inorganic acids (HCl, HNO 3, H 3 PO 4 and H 2 SO 4) were assessed by {{differential scanning calorimetry}} (DSC) and vent sizing package 2 (VSP 2).

Mixing MEKPO with hydrochloric acid resulted in the lowest T- 0 among inorganic acids.

40|$|International audienceA {{bubbling}} {{fluidized bed}} membrane reactor for steam reforming of methane is mathematically investigated, with the permselective Pd membranes removing hydrogen from the reaction system {{to enhance the}} methane conversion.

A drop in the reactor temperature at the inlet of the reactor itself due to the high endothermicity and fast kinetics of the steam reforming reactions does not strongly support the idea of a higher feed temperature favoring the reaction conversion. Thereafter, in situ generation of heat by the combustion reactions is a more effective means to give better reactor performance, and a higher feed temperature can be used to supplement this performance. However, since higher oxygen-methane ratios also tend to consume more of the methane itself, this cannot be increased much and an optimum value exists with respect to the favorable production of pure hydrogen from the reactor permeate side...|$|R
