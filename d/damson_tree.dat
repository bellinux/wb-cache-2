"'Tis bliss to be a bachelor, sir," [...] he said, gazing on the {{resinous}} {{trunk of}} an old <b>damson</b> <b>tree.</b> [...] "I gorge, I guzzle; I am merry, am melancholy; studious, harmonical, drowsy,--and none to scold or deny me. For the rest, why, youth is vain: yet youth had pleasure--innocence and delight. I chew the cud of many a peaceful acre. Ay, I have nibbled roses in my time. But now, what now? I have lived so long far from courts and courtesy, grace and fashion, and am so much my own close and indifferent friend--Why! he is happy who has solitude for housemate, company for guest. I say it, I say it; I marry daily wives of memory's fashioning, and dream at peace." ...|$|E
40|$|Symptoms of sharka disease {{were first}} {{observed}} on plums in Chrudim district, Central Bohemia, in former Czechoslovakia {{in the forties}} of the last century. Plum pox virus (PPV) was first detected in the Bohemian part of Czechoslovakia in 1952 (SMOLÁK, NOVÁK 1956). An investigation into the diversity and distribution of natural sources of PPV in the Czech Republic began in 1995. Partial results were published by POLÁK (1997) and POLÁK and PÍVALOVÁ (2001) for the years 1999 – 2001. The results of distribution of PPV in naturally growing plum trees, myrobalans and blackthorns were presented completely in 2002 (POLÁK 2002). A small percentage of isolates of the PPV-M serotype in the Czech Republic was found by NAVRÁTIL et al. (1997). They identified it from different, not in greater detail characterised hosts, genetic resources, and experi-mental plants of institutions. The occurrence of PPV-M strain was investigated in our laboratory from 1999 to 2001 at various localities in naturally growing plums, myrobalans and blackthorns. 78 plum and damson trees, 32 myrobalans, and 8 blackthorns were investigated. By means of Mabs, PPV-M was detected only in two plum trees and one <b>damson</b> <b>tree</b> (POLÁK 2002). Furthermore, the presence of PPV-M strain was investigated in se-lected peach and apricot orchards. MATERIALS AND METHODS Plant material The incidence and distribution of PPV-M strain were investigated in two selected intensive orchards of ap-ricots and peaches in Southern Moravia and Central Bohemia. Large orchards (more than 20 hectares) were fifteen to twenty years old. The first orchard of apri-cots, Velké Pavlovice locality, was planted with tree...|$|E

50|$|Brachycaudus helichrysi is {{a species}} of aphid first {{described}} by the German naturalist Johann Heinrich Kaltenbach in 1843. Its common names include leaf curl plum aphid, and leaf-curling plum aphid, {{and it is a}} serious pest of plum and <b>damson</b> <b>trees.</b>|$|R
50|$|Brachycaudus helichrysi overwinters as fertilised eggs which hatch {{during the}} winter or early spring, before the plum and <b>damson</b> <b>trees</b> on which they are laid come into leaf. The fundatrices (viviparous {{parthenogenetic}} females produced on the primary host) feed at first {{at the base of}} buds but as the buds begin to expand, they move on to softer tissues, and later on to the new shoots and underside of the foliage. By May, some winged forms are beginning to appear and these fly to secondary hosts, such as Asteraceae, Chrysanthemum and Trifolium, where they found new colonies. The colonies on the primary host gradually die out. Further generations develop on the secondary hosts and in the autumn, winged forms fly back to the primary host. Here sexual forms develop, mating takes place and eggs are laid on twigs and spurs of the plum and <b>damson</b> <b>trees.</b> Natural enemies include ladybirds, lacewings, soldier beetles and hoverflies.|$|R
50|$|In 2012, Boxley Parish Council {{created an}} orchard to {{celebrate}} the Diamond Jubilee of Queen Elizabeth II. The orchard was planted on former orchard land, and contains apple, pear, cherry, and <b>damson</b> <b>trees,</b> amongst other varieties. The orchard is maintained by the community, and fruit is harvested by the local residents for their own use each autumn. The orchard was officially opened by the Earl and Countess of Wessex in April 2012.|$|R
50|$|In {{addition}} to providing fruit, the damson makes a tough hedge or windbreak, and it became the favoured hedging tree {{in certain parts of}} the country such as Shropshire and Kent. Elsewhere damsons were used in orchards to protect less hardy trees, though orchards entirely composed of <b>damson</b> <b>trees</b> were a feature of some areas, notably the Lyth Valley of Westmorland and the Teme Valley in the Malverns, and indeed damsons were the only plum planted commercially north of Norfolk.|$|R
5000|$|In the 19th century much brickearth-type land in west Middlesex, {{including}} in Heathrow, {{was used for}} orchards of fruit trees, often several sorts mixed in one orchard. Much [...] was grown, often in the orchards under the fruit trees. Sometimes vegetables, or flowers for cutting, were grown under the fruit trees. An author in 1907 reported [...] "thousands and thousands" [...] of plum, cherry, apple, pear, and <b>damson</b> <b>trees,</b> and innumerable currant and gooseberry bushes, round Harmondsworth and Sipson and Harlington and Heathrow. After World War I the amount of fruit growing in the area decreased due to competition from imports and demand for more market-gardening land, and by 1939 less than 10% of the orchard area was left.|$|R
40|$|Sensitivity {{of field}} tests (AgriStrip  and Immunochromato), DAS-ELISA, two step RT-PCR and {{real-time}} RT-PCR for Plum pox virus (PPV) detection was tested in various tissues of apricot, peach, plum and <b>damson</b> plum <b>trees</b> infected with isolates belonging to PPV-D, PPV-M or PPV-Rec, the three strains present in Slovenia. Flowers of apricot and plum {{in full bloom}} {{proved to be a}} very good source for detection of PPV. PPV could be detected with all tested techniques in symptomatic parts of leaves in May and with one exception even in the beginning of August, but it was not detected in asymptomatic leaves using field tests, DAS-ELISA and partly also molecular techniques. PPV was detected only in some of the samples of asymptomatic parts of the leaves with symptoms and of stalks by field tests and DAS-ELISA. Infections were not detected in buds in August using field tests or DAS-ELISA. Field tests are useful for confirmation of the PPV infection in symptomatic leaves, but in tissues without symptoms DAS-ELISA should be combined or replaced by molecular techniques...|$|R
