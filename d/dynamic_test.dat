40|$|Abstract. In {{this paper}} the {{application}} of wavelet in data detection of <b>dynamic</b> <b>testing</b> is chiefly researched, i. e., by applying the method of wavelet denoising to eliminate the non-stationary random noise which produced in data detection of <b>dynamic</b> <b>testing,</b> by analyzing <b>dynamic</b> <b>testing</b> data to define the optimal wavelet {{as well as the}} optimal decomposition scale. Based on actual requirements of <b>dynamic</b> <b>testing</b> system, to reconstruct the data accurately by using FIR filter with biorthogonal wavelet, the method has a favorable effect...|$|R
40|$|In this article, I {{reflect on}} {{potential}} {{reasons for the}} seemingly persistent impression that <b>dynamic</b> <b>testing</b> has not delivered on its promise. Potential reasons are embedded in a paradox. On the one hand, validity-related expectations toward <b>dynamic</b> <b>tests</b> seem too broad. This includes fuzziness in defining the diagnostic target constructs, simplistic quantitative focus on conventional validity indices, and overgeneralized expectations regarding incremental validity. At the same time, the focus on <b>dynamic</b> <b>testing</b> seems too narrow. By introducing three tests of cognitive flexibility, I exemplify that <b>dynamic</b> <b>testing</b> has potential which goes beyond the assessment of learning potential in specific subpopulations. My ambition is to help in addressing potential users' misconceptions about <b>dynamic</b> <b>testing</b> productively...|$|R
50|$|Static and <b>dynamic</b> <b>testing</b> {{approach}} {{may also be}} used. <b>Dynamic</b> <b>testing</b> involves running the software. Static testing includes verifying requirements, syntax of code and any other activities that do not include actually running the code of the program.|$|R
25|$|Many {{aspects of}} {{structural}} quality can be evaluated only statically through {{the analysis of}} the software inner structure, its source code, at the unit level, the technology level and the system level, which is in effect how its architecture adheres to sound principles of software architecture outlined in a paper on the topic by OMG. But some structural qualities, such as usability, can be assessed only dynamically (users or others acting in their behalf interact with the software or, at least, some prototype or partial implementation; even the interaction with a mock version made in cardboard represents a <b>dynamic</b> <b>test</b> because such version can be considered a prototype). Other aspects, such as reliability, might involve not only the software but also the underlying hardware, therefore, it can be assessed both statically and dynamically (stress test).|$|E
25|$|Following the {{conclusion}} of the ALT test flight program, on March 13, 1978, Enterprise was flown once again, but this time halfway across the country to NASA's Marshall Space Flight Center (MSFC) in Alabama for the Mated Vertical Ground Vibration Testing (MGVT). The orbiter was lifted up on a sling very similar to the one used at Kennedy Space Center and placed inside the <b>Dynamic</b> <b>Test</b> Stand building, and there mated to the Vertical Mate Ground Vibration Test tank (VMGVT-ET), which in turn was attached to a set of inert Solid Rocket Boosters (SRB) to form a complete shuttle launch stack, and marked {{the first time in the}} program's history that all Space Shuttle elements, an Orbiter, an External Tank (ET), and two SRBs, were mated together. During the course of the program, Enterprise and the rest of the launch stack would be exposed to a punishing series of vibration tests simulating as closely as possible those expected during various phases of launch, some tests with and others without the SRBs in place.|$|E
500|$|Dynamic tests came {{in three}} configurations, {{one for each}} phase of Saturn V-powered flight. [...] Configuration I focused on testing the entire stack, as if the vehicle had just launched. [...] Configuration II {{exercised}} the stack as if the first stage had jettisoned and the second stage were firing, and configuration III tested just the third stage and Apollo spacecraft. [...] Tests began with Configuration III in the Saturn IB <b>Dynamic</b> <b>Test</b> Facility, while the Saturn V <b>Dynamic</b> <b>Test</b> Stand, first, and second stages were still under construction. [...] Configuration I testing followed in the Saturn V <b>Dynamic</b> <b>Test</b> Stand, then Configuration II in the same place.|$|E
40|$|<b>Dynamic</b> <b>testing</b> {{includes}} {{procedures that}} {{examine the effects}} of brief training on test performance where pre- to post-training change reflects patients' learning potential. The objective of this systematic review was to provide clinicians and researchers insight into the concept and methodology of <b>dynamic</b> <b>testing</b> and to explore its predictive validity in adult patients with cognitive impairments. The following electronic databases were searched: PubMed, PsychINFO, and Embase/Medline. Of 1141 potentially relevant articles, 24 studies met the inclusion criteria. The mean methodological quality score was 4. 6 of 8. Eleven different <b>dynamic</b> <b>tests</b> were used. The majority of studies used dynamic versions of the Wisconsin Card Sorting Test. The training mostly consisted of a combination of performance feedback, reinforcement, expanded instruction, or strategy training. Learning potential was quantified using numerical (post-test score, difference score, gain score, regression residuals) and categorical (groups) indices. In five of six longitudinal studies, learning potential significantly predicted rehabilitation outcome. Three of four studies supported the added value of <b>dynamic</b> <b>testing</b> over conventional testing in predicting rehabilitation outcome. This review provides preliminary support that <b>dynamic</b> <b>tests</b> can provide a valuable addition to conventional tests to assess patients' abilities. Although promising, there was a large variability in methods used for <b>dynamic</b> <b>testing</b> and, therefore, it remains unclear which <b>dynamic</b> <b>testing</b> methods are most appropriate for patients with cognitive impairments. More research is warranted to further evaluate and refine <b>dynamic</b> <b>testing</b> methodology and to further elucidate its predictive validity concerning rehabilitation outcomes relative to other cognitive and functional status indices...|$|R

500|$|After the S-II-T/D destruction, a third {{article was}} {{assigned}} to <b>dynamic</b> <b>test</b> duties. [...] Facilities checkout article S-II-F became the <b>dynamic</b> <b>test</b> article designated S-II-F/D. [...] S-II-F was shipped from S, Seal Beach, California on February 20, 1966, to Kennedy Space Center where it arrived March 4. [...] It filled in the final part of SA-500F to check out facilities for processing the Saturn V, replacing a dumbbell-shaped temporary stage of the same length and weight as an S-II stage. SA-500F was assembled in the Vehicle Assembly Building where it was mated to S-IC-F on March 28 and S-IVB-F the next day.|$|E

40|$|Testing {{concurrent}} programs {{remains a}} difficult task due to the non-deterministic nature of concurrent execution. Many approaches have been proposed to tackle the complexity of uncovering potential concurrency bugs. Static analysis tackles the problem by analyzing a concurrent program looking for situations/patterns {{that might lead to}} possible errors during execution. In general, static analysis cannot precisely locate all possible concurrent errors. <b>Dynamic</b> <b>testing</b> examines and controls a program during its execution also looking for situations/patterns that might lead to possible errors during execution. In general, <b>dynamic</b> <b>testing</b> needs to examine all possible execution paths to detect all errors, which is intractable. Motivated by these observation, a new testing technique is developed that uses a collaboration between static analysis and <b>dynamic</b> <b>testing</b> to find the first potential error but using less time and space. In the new collaboration scheme, static analysis and <b>dynamic</b> <b>testing</b> interact iteratively throughout the testing process. Static analysis provides coarse-grained flow-information to guide the <b>dynamic</b> <b>testing</b> through the relevant search space, while <b>dynamic</b> <b>testing</b> collects concrete runtime-information during the guided exploration. The concrete runtime-information provides feedback to the static analysis to refine its analysis, which is then feed forward to provide more precise guidance of the <b>dynamic</b> <b>testing.</b> The new collaborative technique is able to uncover the first concurrency-related bug in a program faster using less storage than the state-of-the-art dynamic testing-tool Java PathFinder. The implementation of the collaborative technique consists of a static-analysis module based on Soot and a dynamic-analysis module based on Java PathFinder...|$|R

[...] Two such test articles were destroyed during testing after having been designated for the <b>dynamic</b> <b>test</b> phase.

50|$|There {{are many}} {{approaches}} available in software testing. Reviews, walkthroughs, or inspections {{are referred to}} as static testing, whereas actually executing programmed code with a given set of test cases is referred to as <b>dynamic</b> <b>testing.</b> Static testing is often implicit, as proofreading, plus when programming tools/text editors check source code structure or compilers (pre-compilers) check syntax and data flow as static program analysis. <b>Dynamic</b> <b>testing</b> takes place when the program itself is run. <b>Dynamic</b> <b>testing</b> may begin before the program is 100% complete in order to test particular sections of code and are applied to discrete functions or modules. Typical techniques for this are either using stubs/drivers or execution from a debugger environment.|$|R
