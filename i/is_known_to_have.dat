5|$|Sometime between 887 and 892, Alfred gave Asser {{the monastery}} of Exeter. Asser {{subsequently}} became Bishop of Sherborne, though {{the year of}} succession is unknown.

5|$|As of 2005 Uranus <b>is</b> <b>known</b> <b>to</b> <b>have</b> nine {{irregular}} moons, which orbit it at {{a distance}} much {{greater than that of}} Oberon, the furthest of the large moons. All the irregular moons are probably captured objects that were trapped by Uranus soon after its formation. The diagram illustrates the orbits of those irregular moons discovered so far. The moons above the X axis are prograde, those beneath are retrograde. The radius of the Uranian Hill sphere is approximately 73million km.|$|E
5|$|As of 2016, Uranus <b>is</b> <b>known</b> <b>to</b> <b>have</b> 13 inner moons. Their orbits lie {{inside that}} of Miranda.

The two innermost moons (Cordelia and Ophelia) are as shepherds of Uranus's ε ring, whereas the small moon Mab {{is a source of}} Uranus's outermost μ ring. There may be two additional small (2–7km in radius) undiscovered shepherd moons located about 100km exterior to Uranus' α and β rings.|$|E
