60|$|When March came, the bitterest {{month of}} all for the Wood Folk, even Wayeeses was often hard pressed to find a living. Small game grew scarce and very wild; the caribou had wandered far away to other ranges; and the cubs would dig for hours after a mouse, or stalk a snowbird, or wait with endless {{patience}} for a red squirrel to stop his chatter and come down to search under the snow for a <b>fir</b> <b>cone</b> that he had hidden there in the good autumn days. And once, when the hunger within was more nipping than the eager cold without, one of the cubs found a bear sleeping in his winter den among the rocks. With a sharp hunting cry, that sang like a bullet over the frozen wastes, he called the whole pack about him. While the rest lay in hiding the old he-wolf approached warily and scratched Mooween out of his den, and then ran away to entice the big brute into the open ground, where the pack rolled in upon him and killed him in a terrible fight before he had fairly shaken the sleep out of his eyes.|$|E

O' the five white men engaged upon the extraction o' tin ore and mercantile pursuits, there were three o' the sons o' Anak. Wait while I remember. Lammitter was the first by two inches--a giant in the land, an' a terreefic man to cross in his ways. From heel to head he was six feet nine inches, and proportionately built across and through the thickness of his body. Six good feet nine inches--an overbearin' man. Next to him, and I have forgotten his precise business, was Sandy Vowle. And he was six feet seven, but lean and lathy, and it was more in the elasteecity of his neck that the height lay than in any honesty o' bone and sinew. Five feet and a few odd inches may have been his real height. The remainder came out when he held up his head, and six feet seven he was upon the door-sills. I took his measure in chalk standin' on a chair. And next to him, but a proportionately made man, ruddy and of a fair countenance, was Jock Coan--that they called the <b>Fir</b> <b>Cone.</b> He was but six feet five, and a child beside Lammitter and Vowle. When the three walked out together, they made a scunner run through the colony o' Larut.

40|$|International audiencePhytophagous insects {{provide useful}} {{models for the}} study of {{ecological}} speciation. Much {{attention has been paid to}} host shifts, whereas situations where closely related lineages of insects use the same plant during different time periods have been relatively neglected in previous studies of insect diversification. Flies of the genus Strobilomyia are major pests of conifers in Eurasia and North America. They are specialized feeders in cones and seeds of Abies (fir), Larix (larch) and Picea (spruce). This close association is accompanied by a large number of sympatric Strobilomyia species coexisting within each tree genus. We constructed a molecular phylogeny with a 1320 base-pair fragment of mitochondrial DNA that demonstrated contrasting patterns of speciation in larch cone flies, as opposed to spruce and <b>fir</b> <b>cone</b> flies; this despite their comparable geographic distributions and similar resource quality of the host. Species diversity is the highest on larch, and speciation is primarily driven by within-host phenological shifts, followed by allopatric speciation during geographical expansion. By contrast, fewer species exploit spruce and fir, and within-host phenological shifts did not occur. This study illustrates within-host adaptive radiation through phenological shifts, a neglected mode of sympatric speciation. (c) 2006 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved...|$|E

40|$|Abstract‚ÄîThe type D valvular {{intestine}} of {{the extant}} elasmobranch Scyliorhinus canicula produces fecal ribbons that coil spirally within the colon. Spiral fecal masses are {{expelled from the}} body without distortion. These masses are similar in morphology and internal structure to heteropolar coprolites from the Wymore Shale of Permian age in Kansas, which were previously described as enterospirae (fossilized valvular intestines). FOSSILIZED FECES are called coprolites. Amstutz (1958) reviewed the literature defining copro-lites and provided criteria for their identifica-tion. One type of ' coprolite, a spirally coiled form, first gained attention in the early 19 th century.

The study {{investigated}} the discriminant interpopulational variability of the morphological characteristics of Silver fir (Abies alba Mill.) from central Bosnia. Four morphological characteristics of the cone, six characteristics of the seed, two characteristics of the cone scale, and certain quotients of the cone traits, were investigated. Variability was investigated by the application of multivariant analysis of five populations which differ by geological and pedological parent rock, different phytocoenoses and which belong to different seed zones. The investigated morphological characteristics of the cone, seed and cone scale of Silver fir (Abies alba Mill.) in populations of central Bosnia displayed significant individual, as well as interpopulational variability. Differences in altitude, pedological and geological soil structure between the populations {{had no effect on}} interpopulational variability of the investigated characteristics, or on the distance between populations.

40|$|Graduation date: 1979 Noble fir (Abies procera Rehd.) is {{an upper}} {{elevation}} timber species {{native to the}} Cascade Range and (occasionally) the Coast Ranges of Washington and Oregon. It {{has always been a}} commerical species; however, recent changes in forest practices to increase harvests in the elevations where this tree occurs has caused a substantial increase in its importance. Because of this increase, the demand for seed has also risen greatly. However, the species produces few filled and viable seeds, despite an apparently large seed potential. This study reports a new estimate of noble fir's seed potential, and investigates some relatively unknown factors affecting seed production, the objective being to provide useful information to those interested in increasing levels of seed production. The study was carried out at two sites in Oregon in 1977. The primary site was in the Cascade Mountains east of J 1 olalla, elevation 1100 meters. The secondary site, where corroborative observations were made, was on Marys Peak in ie Coast Range about 20 km west of Corvallis, elevation 1190 meters. Both sites were chosen for accessibility and availability of climbable, cone-bearing trees. A sample of 20 mature cones gathered from eight trees at the Cascade site was used to estimate seed potential and the effect of various seed and cone insects. The relationship of seed potential and cone size characters was also studied, as was the relationship of these characters with insect damage levels. Biological observations of insects were made at approximately weekly intervals throughout the summer, and a weekly bagging experiment was utilized to gain oviposition information. Insect identifications were tentatively established on the basis of previous reports of insects on similar hosts. Final determinations were made by taxonomists at the United States National I 1 useum. Results of the study showed a seed potential of 133 seeds per cone, which is larger than previous estimates. Cone size differed significantly among trees, and seed potential was positively related to cone size. These results are similar to those for other conifers. The most significant biotic factors reducing seed production were insects. They destroyed 36 percent of sample seed. However, unknown factors, probably including a physiological one related to pollination, had a much greater effect, with 63 percent of sample seed empty or flat. Less than one percent of one seed was filled. Of the nine insects identified as affecting seeds and cones of noble fir, a fir seed chalcid (Megastigmus pinus Parfitt), and two <b>fir</b> <b>cone</b> maggots (Earomyia spp. ficAlpine), caused about 95 percent of total insect damage. The incts showed no preference for any cone portion, which is significant in regard to sampling for insects or damage. Also, except for fir seed chalcids, damage was unrelated to cone size and was not significantly different between trees. A short summary of each insect's activity was prepared, utilizing study results and other literature. Also, a key to the damage for each species was constructed...|$|E
