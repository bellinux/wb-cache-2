5|$|By now, the {{division}} {{was too weak}} to attempt to reach Frost at the bridge. Of the nine infantry battalions, only one (1st Battalion, The Border Regiment) still existed as a unit, the rest were badly mauled or scattered. Urquhart made the difficult decision to form a defensive perimeter around Oosterbeek, abandoning the 2nd Parachute Battalion. By securing the Driel <b>Ferry</b> <b>Crossing,</b> Urquhart hoped to hold out until XXX Corps could reach them and establish a new bridgehead over the Rhine using the <b>ferry</b> <b>crossing</b> platforms.|$|E

50|$|Today, two <b>ferry</b> {{services}} <b>cross</b> the Hawkesbury River {{from the}} town of Wisemans Ferry. The eponymous Wisemans <b>Ferry</b> <b>crosses</b> the river to a point down-stream of its confluence with the Macdonald River, connecting with the old Great North Road. Webbs Creek <b>Ferry</b> <b>crosses</b> to a point upstream of the confluence, connecting with the St Albans Road that follows {{the west bank of the}} Macdonald River.|$|R

5|$|The {{importance}} of the crossing to vehicular traffic was underpinned when the Great Britain road numbering scheme was drawn up in the 1920s. The planners wished the arterial A9 road to be routed across the Forth here, although the unwillingness to have a <b>ferry</b> <b>crossing</b> {{as part of this}} route led to the A90 number being assigned instead.|$|E
5|$|Members of Task Force Manchu {{who escaped}} from Hill 209 brought back {{considerable}} intelligence information of North Korean {{activity in the}} vicinity of the Paekchin <b>ferry</b> <b>crossing</b> site. At the ferry site the North Koreans had put in an underwater bridge. A short distance downstream, each night they placed a pontoon bridge across the river and took it up before dawn the next morning. Carrying parties of 50 civilians guarded by four North Korean soldiers crossed the river continuously at night, an estimated total of 800-1,000 carriers being used at this crossing site.|$|E
5|$|The Mullan Road was {{constructed}} in 1862 and crossed the Snake River with a <b>ferry</b> <b>crossing</b> at Lyons Ferry until {{the construction of the}} Lower Monumental Dam downstream caused the water level to rise and longer wait times, resulting in the reconstruction of the Snake River Bridge. The current route of SR261 from Washtucna to Ritzville was designated during the creation of the Primary and secondary state highways in 1937 as SSH11E.|$|E
50|$|The Webbs Creek Ferry {{is one of}} two cable ferry {{crossings}} at Wisemans Ferry, {{the other}} being the eponymous Wisemans <b>Ferry,</b> which <b>crosses</b> the Hawkesbury River to a point downstream of the confluence with the Macdonald River.

5|$|The {{construction}} of the Alaska Railroad was completed in 1922, but by the 1930s, due to effects of the Great Depression, freight traffic declined on the railroad. In 1935, the Alaska Road Commission tried to force shippers to use the railroad, and raised the toll at the Tanana <b>ferry</b> <b>crossing</b> to almost 10 dollars a ton. The truckers rebelled at this, with some violent skirmishes. Pirate ferry operations were started, lasting until the start of World War II.|$|E
5|$|The first {{fighting}} between US troops and Yavapai came in early 1837, when the Tolkepaya joined with their Quechan neighbors {{to defend against}} Major Samuel Heintzelman over a Quechan <b>ferry</b> <b>crossing</b> on the Colorado River. The Quechan used the ferry to transport settlers over the river, into California. After they killed a group led by John Glanton, who {{had taken over the}} crossing, the US government retaliated by burning the fields of the Quechans, and taking control of the crossing.|$|E
5|$|With {{the coming}} of the war and {{construction}} of the ALCAN Highway, which connected to the Richardson south of Big Delta, road traffic waned further. The <b>ferry</b> <b>crossing</b> was replaced by a wooden bridge, and later, a larger steel bridge was constructed downriver. This caused rerouting of the highway away from the roadhouse, drawing off traffic and travelers. Wallen operated the roadhouse through the 1940s and early 1950s, although in later years guests were by invitation only. John Hajdukovich died in 1965, and Rika Wallen died four years later in 1969.|$|E

5|$|With Baker {{guarding}} the crossing at San Felipe de Austin, and Martin {{guarding the}} Morton <b>Ferry</b> <b>crossing</b> at Ford Bend, Santa Anna opted on April 12 {{to cross the}} Brazos halfway between at Thompson's Ferry, with Sesma's men and artillery crossing over the next day. The Mexican army attacked the steamer numerous times {{in an attempt to}} capture it, but Ross successfully used cotton bales to protect the steamer and its cargo, and was able to keep the Yellowstone away from Mexican control. Houston released the steamboat from service on April 14, and it continued to Galveston.|$|E

5|$|A {{number of}} new {{crossings}} have been proposed as relief for the Dartford Crossing. The proposed Thames Gateway Bridge to the west was given planning permission by Transport for London (TfL) in December 2004, but was cancelled in November 2008 when Boris Johnson became Mayor of London. Johnson subsequently proposed the Gallions Reach Ferry, a <b>ferry</b> <b>crossing</b> in the same location, as an alternative. The Lower Thames Crossing is a proposed tunnel to the east between Shorne, Kent and South Ockendon, Essex. Thurrock Council suggest that this crossing will be essential for managing congestion. A public consultation on the scheme ended in March 2016, with the route announced in April 2017, though Highways England {{do not expect to}} start construction before 2026.|$|E
5|$|Damage was {{widespread}} in the Philippines, particularly in Metro Manila, where the typhoon passed almost directly over. Power and water was lost in several provinces, while overflowing rivers caused flooding, landslides and made roads impassable. In {{some parts of the}} country, electricity was cut off for up to six days straight. Many trees and billboards were toppled by Xangsane, while Luzon suffered an island-wide power outage. Rough waters and seaport closures left at least 3,400people and nearly 270 vehicles stranded in ports and terminals, mainly at the primary <b>ferry</b> <b>crossing</b> between Samar Island and Bicol Region. Local and provincial officials described Xangsane as the worst typhoon to directly impact Manila since Typhoon Angela passed over the city eleven years ago.|$|E
5|$|Permanent {{habitation}} on {{this part}} of the St. Johns River came only during Florida's British period, when officials established a <b>ferry</b> <b>crossing</b> at the Cow Ford in 1760. The ferry docked on the river's southern bank, which was thus populated continuously long before what is now downtown Jacksonville. When the Spanish resumed control of Florida in 1783 they built Fort San Nicolas beside the ferry landing in present-day St. Nicholas. In 1793 the Spanish government issued a land grant for a slave plantation, which was eventually taken over by Isaac Hendricks. By 1850, Hendricks had married Elizabeth Hudnall, who owned a large adjacent tract, and his daughter Margaret married Albert Gallatin Philips, owner of the nearby Red Bank Plantation; as a result much of the area was owned by families connected to each other by marriage.|$|E

5|$|The Missouri was {{the reason}} Omaha was founded, and {{continued}} to be important to the city's growth for many years. In 1853 William D. Brown had the first vision for the city, leading him to found the Lone Tree <b>Ferry</b> <b>crossing</b> the Missouri River from Council Bluffs, Iowa. Later the Council Bluffs and Nebraska Ferry Company hired Alfred D. Jones to plat Omaha City, which {{was among the first}} settlements in the Nebraska Territory. Along with the Lone Tree Ferry Landing in Downtown Omaha, other ferries were established in the Omaha area at Florence, Saratoga and Bellevue. Large steamboats would carry provisions up the Missouri from St. Louis, stocking the warehouses in Jobbers Canyon and loading the trains of the Union Pacific and at the Omaha Quartermaster Depot, which in turn supplied the U.S. Army's Department of the Platte.|$|E
5|$|Upon leaving Port Penn, DE 9 heads through {{marshland}} {{with some}} fields and woods within the Augustine Wildlife Area. The route rises onto the Reedy Point Bridge, which carries {{it over the}} Chesapeake and Delaware Canal. After crossing over the canal, the road crosses over Fort DuPont State Park, curving northwest and passing to the southwest of Fort DuPont and the Governor Bacon Health Center. DE 9 continues into Delaware City and becomes 5th Street, crossing the Delaware City Channel on a drawbridge. Past the drawbridge, the road heads through residential {{areas of the city}} and intersects Clinton Street, which leads northeast to the Forts <b>Ferry</b> <b>Crossing</b> which provides access to Fort Delaware on Pea Patch Island, part of Fort Delaware State Park.|$|E
5|$|Sprotbrough Bridge is {{actually}} two bridges that carry Mill Lane, the southern one crossing the weir stream {{and the northern}} one crossing the lock cut. Replacing a <b>ferry</b> <b>crossing</b> of the river, the first bridge and associated toll house were built in 1849 for Sir Joseph William Copley of Sprotbrough Hall. The designers of the southern bridge were Benjamin Brundell and William Arnold, and the present structure has three segmental arches on each side, which originally formed the approaches to a central arch. The arch was replaced by an above-deck truss in 1897. The ironwork was manufactured by Newton Chambers & Co. Ltd., who were based at Thorncliffe Ironworks in Sheffield, as recorded by plates attached to the bridge. The northern bridge was a single-arched masonry structure, which {{has been replaced by}} a plate girder bridge resting on the original piers. The toll house, consisting of a single storey with a half basement, made of dressed sandstone with an asphalt roof, still survives on the northern bank of the lock cut. Tolls collected here for passage over Sprotbrough Bridge were said to have been given by the Copley family to the Doncaster Dispensary.|$|E
