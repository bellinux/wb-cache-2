Various flow patterns {{are produced by}} different groupings of the nodes, based on their random alternation between two possible states.

By Monte Carlo simulations we reveal how the time span until the occurrence of a splitting depends on the flow patterns. Increasing the <b>flow</b> <b>fluctuation</b> frequency shortens this time span which reaches a minimum before rising again due to inertia effects incorporated in the model.

Event-by-event treatments of the harmonic flow coefficients v_n (for n = 2, 3 and 4) are performed, in which event distributions of v_n for different orders are consistent with Gaussian shapes over all centrality bins.

40|$|LectureThe shop {{performance}} {{test of a}} hydrogen recycle gas compressor for refinery plant was conducted with the suction pressure of 50 barA based on ASME PTC- 10 Type- 2 test. During testing, a surge phenomenon was observed at a flow rate 15 % higher than the predicted surge flow. From the FFT results of the shaft vibration and the pressure pulsation at the discharge of the compressor, the peaks of sub-synchronous components were observed at two frequencies of 2 Hz and 30 Hz near surge flow. The sub-synchronous vibration at 30 Hz {{was considered to be}} caused by rotating stall, but the 2 Hz was too low to be attributable to rotating stall. As an assumption of the root cause, the acoustic characteristics of shop test loop were checked. The calculated and measured Helmholtz resonance frequency of the shop test loop was in agreement with the sub-synchronous frequency of 2 Hz. For further investigation, additional tests were carried out with a fully instrumented test loop. Many different test cases were carried out by changing the suction pressure and piping size, with and without installing a perforated plate near the compressor. The originating flow points of the surge were different in each case. The originating flow point of the surge was small when the suction pressure was high and/or the perforated plate was installed. From the investigation results, {{it was found that the}} mode of the acoustic characteristics of test loop was related with the originating flow point of surge. In case the compressor discharge is the node of pressure pulsation, it becomes the anti-node of <b>flow</b> <b>fluctuation.</b> In this case, if the flow approaches surge, the <b>flow</b> <b>fluctuation</b> at the compressor discharge is increased.

40|$|When {{the flux}} is steady and small without fluctuations, a {{vertical}} array of carbon nanotubes (CNTs) without branch junctions can be synthesized;[1 − 3] if the flux is much higher, {{the products are}} well-aligned CNT arrays oriented along the gas flow. [4, 5] However, only when we introduce sequential <b>flow</b> <b>fluctuation</b> to the growth can branched[1] or iron-encapsulating CNTs (Fig. 1) be synthesized. Therefore the <b>flow</b> <b>fluctuation</b> plays {{a pivotal role in}} the branching or encapsulating process. In a steady flow with small flux, the flow field is a stable laminar flow, in which only a tiny, oriented and steady force acts on the CNTs, so CNTs usually grow vertically on the substrate. [1 − 3] In a steady flow with much larger flux, a large, uniform and oriented force causes the CNTs to orient along the flow while growing. However, if we cause the gas flow to fluctuate by randomly turning the flow meter up and down, the stable laminar flow will break down and the flow will become disordered, randomly unsteady and apparently impossible to analyze exactly.

40|$|In {{addition}} to being renewable, hydropower {{has the advantage of}} allowing rapid load-following, in that the generation rate can easily be varied within a day to match the demand for power. However, the flow fluctuations that result from load-following can be controversial, in part because they may affect downstream fish populations. At Flaming Gorge Dam, located on the Green River in northeastern Utah, concern has been raised about whether flow fluctuations caused by the dam disrupt feeding at a tailwater trout fishery, as fish move in response to flow changes and as the flow changes alter the amount or timing of the invertebrate drift that trout feed on. Western Area Power Administration (Western), which controls power production on submonthly time scales, has made several operational changes to address concerns about <b>flow</b> <b>fluctuation</b> effects on fisheries. These changes include reducing the number of daily flow peaks from two to one and operating within a restricted range of flows. These changes significantly reduce the value of the power produced at Flaming Gorge Dam and put higher load-following pressure on other power plants. Consequently, Western has great interest in understanding what benefits these restrictions provide to the fishery and whether adjusting the restrictions could provide a better tradeoff between power and non-power concerns. Directly evaluating the effects of flow fluctuations on fish populations is unfortunately difficult. Effects are expected to be relatively small, so tightly controlled experiments with large sample sizes and long study durations would be needed to evaluate them. Such experiments would be extremely expensive and would be subject to the confounding effects of uncontrollable variations in factors such as runoff and weather. Computer simulation using individual-based models (IBMs) is an alternative study approach for ecological problems that are not amenable to analysis using field studies alone. An IBM simulates how a population responds to environmental changes by representing how the population's individuals interact with their environment and each other. IBMs represent key characteristics of both individual organisms (trout, in this case) and the environment, thus allowing controlled simulation experiments to analyze the effects of changes in the key variables. For the <b>flow</b> <b>fluctuation</b> problem at Flaming Gorge Dam, the key environmental variables are flow rates and invertebrate drift concentrations, and the most important processes involve how trout adapt to changes (over space and time) in growth potential and mortality risk. This report documents simulation analyses of <b>flow</b> <b>fluctuation</b> effects on trout populations. The analyses were conducted in a highly controlled fashion: an IBM was used to predict production (survival and growth) of trout populations under a variety of scenarios that differ only in the level or type of <b>flow</b> <b>fluctuation...</b>|$|E

Water level was measured at 30 min intervals over 29 months (942 d) and benthic macroinvertebrates were sampled 14 times over the study period. We performed wavelet analyses on water-level time series to identify temporal scales at which significant flow variation occurs, and calculated three indices: intensity, frequency and temporal clustering of the diurnal flow variation for periods from 2 d to 50 d. We determined the effect of temporal scaling (length of the periods considered) on relationships between benthic community dissimilarity (using Sorensen index) and differences in flow indices among the 14 sampling dates. Temporal scaling affected flow-variation frequency and temporal clustering and their subsequent relationships with benthic community dissimilarity. A time scale of 15 d before benthic sampling was relevant to the assessment of flow-biota relationships. Community dissimilarity significantly increased with increasing difference in flow-fluctuation intensity. This dissimilarity {{was associated with a}} decrease in the density of dominant taxa and a taxa turnover along the temporal gradient in flow-fluctuation intensity. Although flow fluctuations are frequent and highly predictable in equatorial glacier-fed streams, macroinvertebrate communities exhibited a temporal variability in taxon assemblage, which was linked to the intensity of <b>flow</b> <b>fluctuation.</b> We explain these patterns by downstream displacement during high flow events and upstream displacement during low flow periods, thereby highlighting the need of considering temporal scaling effects on benthic fauna to understand the ecological dynamics of lotic systems...|$|E
