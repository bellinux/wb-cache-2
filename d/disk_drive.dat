5|$|The only {{floppy disk}} drives that were readily {{available}} in 1975 were IBM compatible 8-inch drives. MITS selected the Pertec FD400 <b>disk</b> <b>drive</b> which could store over 300,000 bytes of data. The Altair disk controller occupied two boards and had over 60 ICs. The initial units were to be available in August, but were delayed {{until the end of}} 1975. The production version of Extended Disk BASIC was released in April 1976. The controller with one <b>disk</b> <b>drive</b> sold for $1,480 (kit) and $1,980 (assembled).|$|E
5|$|BitLocker is {{a logical}} volume {{encryption}} system. (A volume spans part of a hard <b>disk</b> <b>drive,</b> the whole drive or more than one drive.) When enabled, TPM and BitLocker can ensure {{the integrity of the}} trusted boot path (e.g. BIOS and boot sector), in order to prevent most offline physical attacks and boot sector malware.|$|E
5|$|The ZX Spectrum +3, {{released}} in 1987, looked {{similar to the}} +2A but featured a built-in 3-inch floppy <b>disk</b> <b>drive</b> (like the Amstrad CPC 6128) instead of the tape drive, and was in a black case. It was launched in 1987, initially retailed for £249 and then later £199 and was the only Spectrum capable of running the CP/M operating system without additional hardware.|$|E

5|$|First {{shown as}} a {{technical}} and thematic demonstration video at Nintendo's Shoshinkai trade show in December 1995, Ocarina of Time was developed concurrently with Super Mario 64 by Nintendo's Entertainment Analysis & Development (EAD) division. Both were the first free-roaming 3D game in their respective series. Nintendo planned to release Super Mario 64 as a launch game for the Nintendo 64 (N64) and later release Ocarina of Time for the 64DD, a <b>disk</b> <b>drive</b> peripheral for the system which was also still in development.|$|E
5|$|In 1996, {{a sequel}} for the Nintendo 64, Mother 3 (EarthBound 64 in North America), was announced. It was slated for release on the 64DD, a <b>disk</b> <b>drive</b> {{expansion}} peripheral for the Nintendo 64. Itoi's expansive ideas during development led the development team {{to question whether}} fans would still consider the game part of the series. The game entered development hell and struggled to find a firm release date and in 2000, despite its level of completion, was later cancelled altogether with the commercial failure of the 64DD.|$|E
5|$|Referred to during {{development}} as the ZX81 Colour and ZX82, it was launched as the ZX Spectrum by Sinclair {{to highlight the}} machine's colour display, compared with {{the black and white}} of its predecessor, the ZX81. The Spectrum was released as eight different models, ranging from the entry level with 16KB RAM released in 1982 to the ZX Spectrum +3 with 128KB RAM and built in floppy <b>disk</b> <b>drive</b> in 1987; together they sold over 5 million units worldwide (not counting clones).|$|E
40|$|Abstract—This paper {{considers}} {{the problem of}} efficiently managing storage space in a hybrid storage system employing flash and <b>disk</b> <b>drives.</b> The flash and <b>disk</b> <b>drives</b> exhibit different performance characteristics of read and write behavior. We propose a technique for balancing the workload properties across flash and <b>disk</b> <b>drives</b> in such a hybrid storage system. The presented approach automatically and transparently manages migration of data blocks among flash and <b>disk</b> <b>drives</b> based on their access patterns. This paper presents the design and {{an evaluation of the}} proposed approach on a Linux testbed through realistic experiments. I...|$|R
5000|$|IBM {{manufactured}} 8-inch floppy <b>disk</b> <b>drives</b> from 1969 {{until the}} mid-1980s, {{but did not}} become a significant manufacturer of smaller-sized, 5.25" [...] or 3.5" [...] floppy <b>disk</b> <b>drives</b> (the dimension refers to {{the diameter of the}} floppy disk, not the size of the drive). IBM always offered its magnetic <b>disk</b> <b>drives</b> for sale but did not offer them with original equipment manufacturer (OEM) terms until 1981. By 1996, IBM had stopped making hard <b>disk</b> <b>drives</b> unique to its systems and was offering all its HDDs as an original equipment manufacturer (OEM).|$|R
50|$|Hard <b>disk</b> <b>drives</b> {{started using}} turbo {{equalization}} for their read channel in 2008. By 2012 all hard <b>disk</b> <b>drives</b> used turbo equalization and this remains {{the case as}} of 2016.|$|R
5|$|However, {{the initial}} {{popularity}} of the PowerBook100 did not last. Sales decreased, and by December 1991 the 140 and 170 models had become more popular because customers {{were willing to pay}} more for a built-in floppy <b>disk</b> <b>drive</b> and second serial port, which the PowerBook100 lacked. By August 10, 1992, Apple quietly dropped the PowerBook100 from its price list but continued to sell existing stock through its own dealers and alternative discount consumer-oriented stores such as Price Club. In these stores, a 4MB RAM/40MB hard drive configuration with a floppy drive sold for less than $1,000 (more than $1,500 less than the similar 2MB/20MB configuration's original list price).|$|E
5|$|In 2002, Sony {{released}} the first useful and fully functioning operating {{system for a}} video game console, after the Net Yaroze experiment for the original PlayStation. The kit, which included an internal hard <b>disk</b> <b>drive</b> and the necessary software tools, turned the PlayStation 2 into a full-fledged computer system running Linux. Users can utilize a network adapter to connect the PlayStation 2 to the internet, a monitor cable adaptor to connect the PlayStation 2 to computer monitors {{as well as a}} USB Keyboard and Mouse which can be used to control Linux on the PlayStation 2.|$|E
5|$|On June 11, 2012, Apple showcased its {{upgraded}} Mac notebooks, OS X Mountain Lion, and iOS 6 at the Worldwide Developers Conference (WWDC) in San Francisco. The new MacBook Pro {{models were}} updated with Ivy Bridge processors and USB 3.0 ports, and the default RAM on premium models was increased to 8 GB. Following this announcement, the 17-inch model was discontinued. After a media event on October 22, 2013 Apple discontinued all second generation MacBook Pros {{except for the}} entry-level 2.5GHz 13-inch model. Apple discontinued the 13-inch 2nd generation MacBook Pro on October 27, 2016. Prior to its discontinuation it was Apple’s only product to still include an optical drive and a Firewire port, and only laptop with a hard <b>disk</b> <b>drive</b> and Ethernet port.|$|E
50|$|Hard <b>disk</b> <b>drives</b> for {{personal}} computers (PCs) were initially {{a rare and}} very expensive optional feature; however by the late '80s, hard <b>disk</b> <b>drives</b> were standard on all but the cheapest PC.|$|R

5|$|The NeXT Computer {{was based}} on the new 25MHz Motorola 68030 central {{processing}} unit (CPU). The Motorola 88000 RISC chip was originally considered, but was not available in sufficient quantities. It included between 8 and 64 MB of random-access memory (RAM), a 256 MB magneto-optical (MO) drive, a 40 MB (swap-only), 330 MB, or 660 MB hard <b>disk</b> <b>drive,</b> 10BASE2 Ethernet, NuBus and a 17-inch MegaPixel grayscale display measuring 1120 by 832 pixels. In 1989 a typical new PC, Macintosh, or Amiga computer included a few megabytes of RAM, a 640×480 16-color or 320x240 4000-color display, a 10 to 20 megabyte hard drive and few networking capabilities.|$|E
5|$|The PowerBook100 was {{the first}} PowerBook to {{incorporate}} SCSI Disk Mode, which allowed it {{to be used as}} an external hard disk on a desktop Macintosh. This provided a convenient method for software to be installed onto the PowerBook or transferred to the desktop, without the need for the 100's optional floppy <b>disk</b> <b>drive.</b> A specialized SCSI cable with a unique connector was required, however, to use any SCSI device on the PowerBook series. A second dedicated cable was required for SCSI Disk Mode. This feature was unique to the 100 until Apple introduced new PowerBooks more than a year later.|$|E
5|$|There were <b>disk</b> <b>drive</b> {{interfaces}}, {{such as the}} Abbeydale Designers/Watford Electronics SPDOS, Abbeydale Designers/Kempston KDOS and Opus Discovery. The SPDOS and KDOS interfaces {{were the}} first to come bundled with office productivity software (Tasword Word Processor, Masterfile database and Omnicalc spreadsheet). This bundle, together with OCP's Stock Control, Finance and Payroll systems, introduced small businesses to a streamlined, computerised operation. The most popular floppy disk systems (except in East Europe) were the DISCiPLE and +D systems released by Miles Gordon Technology in 1987 and 1988 respectively. Both systems had the ability to store memory images onto disk snapshots could later be used to restore the Spectrum to its exact previous state. They were both compatible with the Microdrive command syntax, which made porting existing software much simpler.|$|E
25|$|Smaller {{form factor}} (e.g., 2.5inch) hard <b>disk</b> <b>drives</b> often consume less power per {{gigabyte}} than physically larger <b>drives.</b> Unlike hard <b>disk</b> <b>drives,</b> solid-state drives store data in flash memory or DRAM. With no moving parts, power consumption {{may be reduced}} somewhat for low-capacity flash-based devices.|$|R
50|$|The server {{supported}} {{up to six}} 3.5 inch SATA or SAS {{hot swap}} hard <b>disk</b> <b>drives.</b> Upgrades to the server included conversion options to eight 2.5 inch hard <b>disk</b> <b>drives</b> or four 3.5 inch hard <b>disk</b> <b>drives</b> with an internal tape drive with external storage arrays. Power consumption was recorded as being 45W on standby, 203W with the OS on idle, and 289W with the processor’s capabilities tested intensively.|$|R

5|$|Starting {{with the}} release of WWE SmackDown! vs. Raw, online {{gameplay}} was made available for players who had a Sony Network Adapter and a Sony PlayStation 2. Online gameplay was kept at a minimum, as online players only had two game modes to compete in: one-on-one and a Bra and Panties match, in which a player competes as a WWE Diva and strips the opposition of her clothes, until she is left with only her undergarments. When WWE SmackDown! vs. Raw 2006 was released, the online gameplay was changed, and players were able to compete in more match types, defend the created championships, and compete with up to four players in each match. With the release of WWE SmackDown vs. Raw 2008 on the Xbox 360 console (PS3 would not see this feature until WWE SmackDown vs. Raw 2009), players were able to select music from their system's hard <b>disk</b> <b>drive</b> into the video game, where the music can be used in superstars' ring entrances.. WWE 2K18 adds Road to Glory as a continuation of MyCareer Mode in lieu of being the end part of the game. Backstage brawls and 8 man matches are also added to this feature.|$|E
5|$|When he auditioned, Hertzberg had no {{idea what}} Adam would look like in full costume and make-up. Buffy used a company named Optic Nerve to build the {{materials}} to make Hertzberg look like a demonoid. Almost immediately after Hertzberg got the part, Optic Nerve sketched and sculpted Adam's appearance. They had Hertzberg come in to have molds made for prosthetic parts to fit his head and face, arms, chest, and legs, then he was fitted for contact lenses. They also created separate hands and a chest to film for close-up shots. Adam has a floppy <b>disk</b> <b>drive</b> mounted on his chest which, when used, had to be filmed without Hertzberg behind it. The entire construction of Adam's appearance took about two weeks. Hertzberg's voice was also modified post-production. When he saw the full Adam prosthetic and costume, his biggest concern was being able to show nuanced facial expressions under so much latex. It took hours to get Hertzberg into his full costume, but even after it was fully applied on set, often he would have to wait even longer before he went in front of the cameras. He spoke of the need to stay focused during all the waiting while sweating underneath everything he wore for the part.|$|E

5|$|While visiting Nintendo {{for other}} business, Itoi {{approached}} Shigeru Miyamoto about making Mother. When approved for a sequel, Itoi increased his involvement {{as a designer}} in the five-year development of EarthBound. When the project began to flounder, producer and later Nintendo president Satoru Iwata rescued the game. EarthBound English localizers were given great liberties when translating the Japanese game's cultural allusions. The American version sold poorly despite a multimillion-dollar marketing budget. Mother 3 was originally slated for release on the Nintendo 64 and its 64DD <b>disk</b> <b>drive</b> accessory, but was cancelled in 2000. Three years later, the project was reannounced for the Game Boy Advance alongside a rerelease of Mother and Mother 2 in a combined cartridge: Mother 1 + 2, released in 2003. The new Mother 3 abandoned the 3D graphics progress for a 2D style, and became a bestseller upon its release. EarthBound was rereleased for the Wii U Virtual Console in 2013, and Mother received its English-language debut in 2015 for the same platform, retitled EarthBound Beginnings.|$|E
25|$|A hard <b>disk</b> <b>drive,</b> or hard drive, hard disk, or fixed <b>disk</b> <b>drive,</b> is a {{non-volatile}} storage device which stores digitally encoded data on rapidly rotating platters with magnetic surfaces.
