Named after Mariano Moreno, a key member of the first independent government of Argentina, the First Assembly (Primera Junta), Moreno was the second <b>dreadnought</b> of the , and the fourth built during the South American <b>dreadnought</b> race.|$|E

After retrieving the Sunfire, a weapon which can blow up the <b>Dreadnought,</b> they watch helplessly as an airship with Hilda on board is captured by the <b>Dreadnought.</b> When the <b>Dreadnought</b> lands to stock up on supplies, the party rescues Hilda and throws the Sunfire into the airship's engine. Before escaping from the explosion, the party encounters a dark knight whom Maria thinks she recognizes as Leon.|$|E

5|$|HMS Agincourt was a <b>dreadnought</b> {{battleship}} {{built in}} the United Kingdom in the early 1910s. Originally part of Brazil's role in a South American naval arms race, she held the distinction of mounting more heavy guns (fourteen) and more turrets (seven) than any other <b>dreadnought</b> battleship, {{in keeping with the}} Brazilians' requirement for an especially impressive design.|$|E
5|$|In 1897, {{before the}} {{revolution}} in design brought about by HMS <b>Dreadnought,</b> the Royal Navy had 62 battleships in commission or building, a lead of 26 over France and 50 over Germany. In 1906, the Royal Navy owned the field with <b>Dreadnought.</b> The new class of ship prompted an arms race with major strategic consequences. Major naval powers raced {{to build their own}} dreadnoughts. Possession of modern battleships was not only seen as vital to naval power, but also, as with nuclear weapons after WWII, represented a nation's standing in the world. Germany, France, Japan, Italy, Austria, and the United States all began <b>dreadnought</b> programmes; while Ottoman Turkey, Argentina, Russia, Brazil, and Chile commissioned dreadnoughts to be built in British and American yards.|$|E
5|$|Minas Geraes, spelled Minas Gerais in some sources, was a <b>dreadnought</b> {{battleship}} of the Brazilian Navy. Named {{in honor}} of the state of Minas Gerais, the ship was laid down in April 1907 as the lead ship of its class, making the country the third to have a <b>dreadnought</b> under construction and igniting a naval arms race between Brazil, Argentina, and Chile.|$|E

5|$|The Netherlands {{intended}} by 1912 to replace its fleet of pre-dreadnought armoured ships with a modern fleet composed of <b>dreadnoughts.</b> After a Royal Commission proposed {{the purchase of}} nine <b>dreadnoughts</b> in August 1913, there were extensive debates over {{the need for such}} ships and, if they were necessary, the actual number needed. These lasted into August 1914, when a bill authorizing funding for four <b>dreadnoughts</b> was finalized, but the outbreak of World War I halted the ambitious plan.|$|R
5|$|The {{armament}} of the {{new breed}} of ships was not their only crucial advantage. <b>Dreadnought</b> used steam turbines for propulsion, giving her a top speed of 21 knots, against the 18 knots typical of the pre-dreadnought battleships. Able both to outgun and outmaneuver their opponents, the <b>dreadnought</b> battleships decisively outclassed earlier battleship designs.|$|E

5|$|After {{the first}} Brazilian <b>dreadnought,</b> Minas Geraes, was launched, the Brazilian {{government}} began an extended campaign {{to remove the}} third <b>dreadnought</b> from the contract because of political—backlash from the Revolt of the Lash coupled with warming relations with Argentina—and economic reasons. After much negotiating and attempts from Armstrong to hold the Brazilian government to the contract, the Brazilians relented, {{due in part to}} lower bond rates that made it possible for the government to borrow the necessary money.

5|$|At this time, the <b>dreadnought</b> design had {{not been}} fully validated, despite {{the success of the}} British namesake; for example, there were still {{concerns}} that the Minas Geraes class' superfiring turret arrangement—which {{had not been}} utilized on the original <b>Dreadnought,</b> but was also being installed on the American —would cause blast to hurt the crew in the lower turret. Any immediate concerns, however, were mitigated during the firing tests when no ill effects were observed, though the Times (London) reported that there were still concerns registered during São Paulos gun trials in June 1910.|$|E
5|$|<b>Dreadnought</b> {{was put up}} {{for sale}} on 31 March 1920 and sold for scrap to Thos W Ward on 9 May 1921 {{as one of the}} 113 ships that the firm {{purchased}} at a flat rate of ₤2.50 per ton, later reduced to ₤2.20 per ton. As the <b>Dreadnought</b> was assessed at 16,650 tons she cost the shipbreaker ₤36,630 though another source states ₤44,750. She was broken up at Thos W Ward's new premises at Inverkeithing, Scotland, upon arrival on 2 January 1923.|$|E
5|$|From 1906, {{some of the}} Ashbury bogie {{stock was}} {{converted}} into electric multiple units. Some <b>Dreadnought</b> carriages were used with electric motor cars, although two-thirds remained in use as locomotive hauled stock on the extension line.|$|E

5|$|In {{common with}} all major {{warships}} of her day, <b>Dreadnought</b> was fitted with anti-torpedo nets, {{but these were}} removed early in the war, since they caused considerable loss of speed and were easily defeated by torpedoes fitted with net-cutters.|$|E

50|$|At {{the start}} of the war, Britain had 22 <b>dreadnoughts</b> in service {{compared}} to Germany's 15, but Britain also had 13 <b>dreadnoughts</b> under construction even without a Canadian contribution, and by then, the Germans were building only five additional <b>dreadnoughts.</b> With the additional naval strength of France in the Atlantic and Japan in the Pacific, later bolstered by the entry of Italy and eventually the United States, Allied control of the high seas was never seriously threatened and Germany was compelled to seek less costly alternatives (submarines in particular) to project a measure of power in the Atlantic sea lanes.|$|R
5000|$|J1 {{operated}} in patrols in the North Sea. In November 1916, a German force {{of half a}} destroyer flotilla, three <b>dreadnoughts,</b> and a battlecruiser set out from port to rescue two submarines [...] and [...] that were stranded in fog off Jutland. On the return, having only rescued one of the submarines, the force passed J1 off Horns Reef on 5 November 1916. Two of the <b>dreadnoughts,</b> [...] and , were torpedoed by J1, earning her commanding officer, Commander N. F. Laurence, a Bar for his Distinguished Service Order. The <b>dreadnoughts</b> did not sink, but reached port and underwent repairs.|$|R

5|$|The {{building}} of <b>Dreadnought</b> coincided with increasing {{tension between the}} United Kingdom and Germany. Germany had begun to build a large battlefleet in the 1890s, {{as part of a}} deliberate policy to challenge British naval supremacy. With the conclusion of the Entente Cordiale between the United Kingdom and France in April 1904, it became increasingly clear that the United Kingdom's principal naval enemy would be Germany, which was building up a large, modern fleet under the 'Tirpitz' laws. This rivalry gave rise to the two largest <b>dreadnought</b> fleets of the pre-war period.|$|E
5|$|The {{start of}} work on Minas Geraes meant that Brazil had become the third country—behind the United Kingdom and the United States but ahead of major powers such as Germany, France, Russia and Japan—to have a <b>dreadnought</b> under construction.|$|E
