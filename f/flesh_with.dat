5|$|Although {{the fruit}} bodies of P.bembae are roughly {{similar to those}} in Xerocomus, species in this genus do not have the powdery veil {{characteristic}} of P.bembae. Two similar species in the same area include P.annulus and P.croceus, described in 1951 by Belgian mycologist Paul Heinemann, based on specimens collected in the Congo. Although the identity of these two species is not fully clarified because of insufficient collections, P.bembae differs from both in its larger cystidia, its cream-colored <b>flesh</b> <b>with</b> pale reddish-brown to light brown tones under the cap cuticle (compared to white in P.annulus and P.croceus), its yellow mycelium (white in P.annulus and P.croceus), and differences in ecology.|$|E
5|$|The diet of the {{silvertip shark}} {{consists}} primarily of bony fishes, such as grouper, mackerel, tuna, escolars, lanternfish, flyingfish, wrasses, and soles. Eagle rays, smaller sharks, and octopus are occasionally taken. Larger sharks {{tend to be}} more sluggish and take more benthic prey. The differently shaped dentition in their upper and lower jaws allows them to tackle large prey, gripping and sawing off chunks of <b>flesh</b> <b>with</b> violent twists and turns. Silvertip sharks have been observed swimming around the periphery of groups of feeding sharks of other species, occasionally dashing in to steal food. This species often approaches ships, as they are attracted to certain artificial, low-frequency sounds.|$|E
5|$|There {{are several}} {{lookalike}} species found in North American {{with which the}} Appalachian waxy cap might be confused. Hygrocybe cantharellus is a bright red mushroom that has smaller fruit bodies and a more slender stipe than H.appalachianensis. It also has smaller spores, measuring 7–12 by 4–8µm. Hygrocybe reidii, found in Europe and northeastern North America, has <b>flesh</b> <b>with</b> a sweet odor that reminiscent of honey. This smell is sometimes weak and only noticeable when the tissue is rubbed, or when it is drying. Its scarlet cap initially has a narrow yellow-orange margin.|$|E

5|$|Mon thong is {{the most}} commercially sought after for its thick, {{full-bodied}} creamy and mild sweet tasting <b>flesh</b> <b>with</b> relatively moderate smell emitted and smaller seeds, while Chanee {{is the best in}} terms of its resistance to infection by Phytophthora palmivora. Kan Yao is somewhat less common, but prized for its longer window of time when it is both sweet and odorless at the same time. Among all the cultivars in Thailand, five are currently in large-scale commercial cultivation: Chanee, Mon Thong, Kan Yao, Ruang, and Kradum. There are more than 100 registered cultivars since the 1920s in Malaysia and up to 193 cultivars by 1992, and many superior cultivars have been identified through competitions held at the annual Malaysian Agriculture, Horticulture, and Agrotourism Show. In Vietnam, the same process has been achieved through competitions held by the Southern Fruit Research Institute. A recently popular variety is, Cat Mountain King or Musang King.|$|E
5|$|Soon thereafter, Martin leaves Finn and Jake to save {{himself and}} the Lich appears, {{ordering}} Finn to fall. He delivers a monologue, explaining his desire to extinguish all life in the universe. Finn, overcome by the Lich's power, feebly tries to fight back and ends up throwing some of the guardian blood on the Lich, which causes him to grotesquely begin growing <b>flesh.</b> <b>With</b> the Lich disposed of, Finn pursues his father, who is hitching a ride with escaping criminals on a loose piece of the Citadel, still held on by a vein. One of the criminals cuts the vein, but Finn holds on, causing his grass sword to envelope his arm and eventually rip away, severing it. Martin escapes, and Finn and Jake share a somber moment. Jake eventually reveals to Finn that the Lich has now {{been turned into a}} large humanoid baby; the two leave him on the doorstep of Tree Trunks (voiced by Polly Lou Livingston) and Mr. Pig's house.|$|E
5|$|There {{are a few}} greenish Stropharia {{with which}} S.caerulea might be confused. Stropharia pseudocyanea is an {{uncommon}} species that grows in meadows. It has a more slender form than S.caerulea, a soft, spongy stipe, and <b>flesh</b> <b>with</b> an odour similar to fresh pepper. Microscopically, it has a dense palisade of slender, capitate (with a spherical tip) non-staining cheilocystidia on the gill edge. This gives the gills of young, fresh fruit bodies a whitish edge, a feature that is absent from S.caerulea. Another lookalike, S.aeruginosa, is less common than S.caerulea. It is distinguished from the latter by the well-developed ring zone on its stipe, darker gills with white edges, and more numerous whitish scales around the cap margin. Additionally, S.aeruginosa has more stable colours than S.caerulea, the colouration of which tends to quickly wash out. However, collections of Stropharia often show characteristics that are intermediate between two or more species, making them difficult to identify accurately.|$|E

25|$|Striped bass has {{firm and}} flavorful <b>flesh</b> <b>with</b> a large flake. The hybrid striped bass yields more meat, {{has a more}} fragile texture, and a blander flavor than wild striped bass. The fish has a mild and {{distinctive}} flavor. In recipes, it can be substituted for milder fish like cod, {{as well as for}} stronger fish like bluefish. Other fish can substitute it, including weakfish, tilefish, blackfish, small bluefish, catfish, salmon, swordfish, and shark. Striped bass is easily grilled in fillets, and is therefore popular in beach communities.|$|E

25|$|Blue runner is also of high {{importance}} to recreational fisheries, with anglers often taking the species both {{for food and}} to use as bait. The blue runner {{has a reputation as}} an excellent gamefish on light tackle, taking both fish baits, as well a variety of lures including hard-bodied bibbed lures, spoons, metal jigs and soft plastic jigs. The species is also a target for light tackle saltwater fly fishermen, and can push 6-weight fly tackle to its limits. The blue runner is used extensively as live bait for larger fish, including billfish, cobia and amberjack. It is considered a fairly low-quality table fish, and larger specimens are known to carry the ciguatera toxin in their <b>flesh,</b> <b>with</b> several cases reported from the Virgin Islands.|$|E
