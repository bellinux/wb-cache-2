40|$|<b>Huyghens</b> <b>principle</b> and Planck law are {{studied in}} Maxwell and Maxwell-Chern-Simons {{frameworks}} in (2 + 1) dimensions. Contrary to (3 + 1) dimensions, massless photons are shown to violate <b>Huyghens</b> <b>principle</b> in planar world. In addition, we obtain that Planck law {{is no longer}} proportional to ν 3, but to the squared frequency, ν 2, of the planar photons. We also briefly discuss possible physical consequences of these results...|$|E
30|$|This is {{consistent}} with the expansion (1.2) for the free wave equation: the single pole is “responsible” for the failure of the sharp <b>Huyghens</b> <b>principle</b> in that case.|$|E
40|$|An {{analysis}} of the propagation of non stationary waves in the adiabatic region of stellar interior is presented. An equation of motion with an effective potential is derived, similar to the Zerilli equation known in the propagation of gravitational waves. The <b>Huyghens</b> <b>principle</b> is violated {{in this case and}} the energy diffusion outward null cones is expected. Numerical calculations demonstrate that the diffusion is weak for the case of standard Solar model; thus no significant effect corresponding to quasinormal modes can be expected. The likely reason for the absence of stronger features is the restriction of our analysis to adiabatic regions only, where the breakdown of the <b>Huyghens</b> <b>principle</b> is insignificant. 1...|$|E
40|$|An emitted {{radiation}} can be reprocessed in curved spacetimes, due to {{the breakdown}} of the <b>Huyghens</b> <b>principle.</b> A maximization procedure for the energy diffusion allows one to obtain wave packets (gravitational and electromagnetic) that are particularly strongly backscattered. Examples are shown with the backscattered part exceeding by one order remnants of initial signals. A robust ringing can be observed, with amplitudes exceeding leftovers of the main radiation pulse. The analysis of the obtained results allows one to set demands on some parameters in the numerical description of a realistic process of the collapse of two black hole...|$|E
40|$|The aim of {{this work}} is to compare the {{accuracy}} of numerical previsions of sound propagation in a quany obtained with different algorithms with {{particular attention to the}} diffracted waves over barriers. Comparison is between the IS 0 9613 Standard "Attenuation of sound during propagation outdoors", a new simplified algorithm based on the <b>Huyghens</b> <b>principle,</b> a pyramid beam tracing method. The IS 0 96 13 (parts 2) Standard proposes a method taking into account the meteorological conditions (Kmet). It also takes into account the effects caused by the propagation over soil with varying properties, shielding both from thin and thick obstacles as well as the effects of vegetation layers and excess attenuation. The new algorithm simplifies IS 0 codes proposing an easy method, specific for a quarry. Pyramid beam tracing, implemented in Ramsete, a sound propagation software, suited to simulate sound fields in large rooms and also outdoors. Experimental and simulated data have been used to built graphic plots, enabling a direct comparison of the results. © 2003 WIT Press...|$|E
40|$|When a {{listener}} {{is put in}} a shadow zone and "does not see" directly the source, the sound however reaches him. We can say waves reach the listener by four different ways: 1) scattering from {{the edges of the}} windows called diffraction; 2) scattering from the turbulence in the air above the window and near the external source; 3) refraction by atmospheric wind; 4) reflections in the room. If we put the listener quite close the window (1 m) and assume the room be constructed by adsorbent materials, edges diffraction has a dominant effect on the pressure in the shadow region. Most of the original work of diffraction theory has been reported for light diffraction; nevertheless there is no difference between the computation for light and for sound waves, as long as both are based on the assumption of a scalar potential. One of the most valuable theorems in acoustics is the <b>Huyghens</b> <b>principle</b> that permits the forecasting of sound pressure levels by assuming every point on a vibrating plane surface may be considered as the centre of an outgoing wave. Based on this principle the diffraction edge can be regarded to be consisting of many point sources (secondary sources) which are the centres of outgoing wave whose intensity is proportional to the primary incident wave and to the path length from the source to the secondary point source same. Using this powerful tool a case study is presented where the environmental impact of a quarry plant is considered...|$|E
40|$|From the {{customary}} view the Michelson-Morley experiment {{is used to}} expose {{the failure of the}} aether theory. The key point in this experiment is the fringe shift of the interference pattern. Regularly, the fringe shift calculations are only presented {{from the perspective of the}} inertial frame where the one-way speed of light is anisotropic which gives a partial vision of the problem. In a spirit of revision of these facts we have meticulously analyzed the physics behind them. As a result, an angular effect which is based on <b>Huyghens</b> <b>principle</b> and plays a fundamental role in the reflection of light waves at moving mirrors is incorporated. Moreover, under the assumption of a null result in the experiment, on the one hand, the fringe shift conditions demand actual relativistic effects; on the other, it is confirmed that Maxwell’s electrodynamics and Galilean relativity are incompatible formulations. From these two points at least three inertial theories follow: (1) the special theory of relativity (SR), (2) a new aether theory (NET) based on the Tangherlini transformations and (3) emission theories based on Ritz ’ modification of electrodynamics. A brief review of their physical content is presented and the problem of the aether detection as well as the propagation of light, within the context of SR and the NET, are discussed. Despite the overwhelming amount of evidences that apparently favors SR we claim that there are no strong reasons to refuse the aether which conceived as a continuous material medium, still stands up as a physical reality and could be physically associated with dark matter, the cosmic background radiation and the vacuum condensates of particle physics...|$|E
