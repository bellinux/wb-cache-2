5|$|After {{the deal}} closed in May 2006, Lasseter {{revealed}} that Iger had realized Disney needed to buy Pixar while watching a parade {{at the opening}} of Hong Kong Disneyland in September 2005. Iger noticed that of all the Disney characters in the parade, not one was a character that Disney had created within the last ten years since all the newer ones had been created by Pixar. Upon returning to Burbank, Iger commissioned a <b>financial</b> <b>analysis</b> that confirmed that Disney had actually lost money on animation for the past decade, then presented that information {{to the board of directors}} at his first board meeting after being promoted from COO to CEO, and the board, in turn, authorized him to explore the possibility of a deal with Pixar. Lasseter and Catmull were wary when the topic of Disney buying Pixar first came up, but Jobs asked them to give Iger a chance (based on his own experience negotiating with Iger in summer 2005 for the rights to ABC shows for the fifth-generation iPod Classic), and in turn, Iger convinced them of the sincerity of his epiphany that Disney really needed to re-focus on animation.|$|E

25|$|Wind power {{produces}} no {{greenhouse gases}} during operation, although inevitably some are produced during construction and transport. The precise amounts involved are {{a matter of}} controversy. Manufacturers typically state that carbon emissions are 'paid back' within 3–18 months of production, but recent research claims that turbines located on peat bogs create incidental emissions that may increase this to 8 years or more. A 2013 <b>financial</b> <b>analysis</b> of utility companies such as the SSE (formerly Scottish and Southern Electricity) concluded that utilities were haemorrhaging cash. Construction of wind farms by the electrical generating industry lead to duplication of existing power plants which were still needed as backup without increasing the utilities customer base or their output.|$|E
25|$|To ensure {{every single}} {{operation}} showed a clear profit {{on a full}} costing basis, i.e. inclusive of all overhead costs, the company required each operation to be budgeted in detail before deciding whether to accept it. The managing director's authorisation was required to dispense with this rule in exceptional cases where the risk of accepting a contract that was only marginally profitable, i.e. excluding overheads, was outweighed by {{the risk of having}} an aircraft sit idly on the ground. An immediate <b>financial</b> <b>analysis</b> that compared actual costs and revenues with their budgets followed the completion of each flight, thereby instantly gauging that flight's profitability and validating the effectiveness of the firm's pricing policy. A policy of requiring aircraft commanders to pay for all operating expenses other than fuel in cash proved to be an effective method to exercise instant cost control over fees and charges incurred for products and services supplied by third parties, such as ground handling fees, technical support services and catering supplies.|$|E
40|$|Abstract: Financial ratios {{have long}} {{been used as a}} tool to {{evaluate}} the overall financial performance of a company. However, in early 1990 s, a new method called Balanced Scorecard has been introduced by Robert Kaplan and David Norton to evaluate the overall controlling of a company. Problem statement: To {{the best of my knowledge}} at present there are no letrature review comparing between Financial ratios and Balanced Scorecard. Approach: This study is a conceptual paper comparing between the <b>financial</b> ratios <b>analysis</b> and balanced scorecard method. The objective of this paper is to compare between the benefits and problems of using <b>financial</b> ratios <b>analysis</b> and Balanced Scorecard method in evaluating the overall control of the company. Results: As a result, we found that the Balanced Scorecard is more efficient than <b>financial</b> ratios <b>analysis.</b> Conclusion/Recommendations: Both the balanced scorecard and <b>financial</b> ratios <b>analysis</b> are important tools for evaluating performance. So, we cannot ignore either of them...|$|R

25|$|Originally {{scheduled}} for first test flights in 2011, the independent {{analysis by the}} Augustine Commission found in late 2009 that due to technical and financial problems Ares I was not likely to have had its first crewed launch until 2017–2019 under the current budget, or late 2016 with an unconstrained budget. The Augustine Commission also stated that Ares I and Orion would have an estimated recurring cost of almost $1 billion per flight. However, later <b>financial</b> <b>analysis</b> in March 2010 showed that the Ares I would have cost $1 billion or more to operate per flight had the Ares I flown just once a year. If the Ares I system were flown multiple times a year the marginal costs could have fallen to as low as $138 million per launch. In December 2011, NASA administrator Charlie Bolden testified to congress that the Ares I would cost $4–4.5 billion a year, and $1.6 billion per flight. The Ares I marginal cost was predicted {{to have been a}} fraction of the Shuttle's marginal costs even had it flown multiple times per year. By comparison, the cost of launching three astronauts on a manned Russian Soyuz is $153 million.|$|E

It is observed that it is typical of <b>financial</b> ratio <b>analysis</b> research that there are several unexpectedly distinct lines with research traditions of their own. A common feature of all the areas of <b>financial</b> ratio <b>analysis</b> research seems to be that while significant regularities can be observed, they are not necessarily stable across the different ratios, industries, and time periods.

500|$|From the 1980s to {{the present}} there have been {{multiple}} accounting scandals that were widely reported on {{by the media and}} resulted in fraud charges, bankruptcy protection requests, and the closure of companies and accounting firms. The scandals were the result of creative accounting, misleading <b>financial</b> <b>analysis,</b> as well as bribery. Various companies had issues with fraudulent accounting practices, including Nugan Hand Bank, Phar-Mor, WorldCom, and AIG. One of the most widely reported violation of accounting ethics involved Enron, a multinational company, that for several years had not shown a true or fair view of their financial statements. Their auditor Arthur Andersen, an accounting firm considered one of the [...] "Big Five", signed off on the validity of the accounts despite the inaccuracies in the financial statements. When the unethical activities were reported, not only did Enron dissolve but Arthur Andersen also went out of business. Enron's shareholders lost $25billion {{as a result of the}} company's bankruptcy. Although only a fraction of Arthur Anderson's employees were involved with the scandal, the closure of the firm resulted in the loss of 85,000 jobs.|$|E
500|$|Some historians {{consider}} Scipione Borghese, cardinal-nephew to Pope Paul V, {{to be the}} [...] "prototypical representative" [...] of a cardinal-nephew, {{unlike those}} before him, created to [...] "provide for and oversee the permanent social and economic ascent of the reigning papal family {{into the ranks of}} the high Roman aristocracy". For example, in 1616, 24 of the 30 abbeys belonging to Borghese were rented out, a practice the Council of Trent had attempted to eliminate. A thorough <b>financial</b> <b>analysis</b> of Borghese's cardinalate by Reinhard Volcker (based on a series of extant account books) examines the strategies Borghese used to build up wealth during his uncle's pontificate and non-ecclesiastical assets before his uncle's death, which Volcker considers to be exemplary of Baroque papal families. It is estimated that Paul V Borghese had transferred to his family approximately 4% of the total income of the Holy See during his pontificate. Borghese's personal revenues in 1610 were 153,000 scudi compared to the mere 4,900 scudi that constituted his entire family's income in 1592.|$|E

[...] The state financial study, publicly released on December 2, 2010, indicated that the project would likely experience a $1.7billion overrun above the $5.3billion projected cost, and that collections from the General Excise Tax would be 30% below forecasts. [...] Then Mayor Peter Carlisle (Democrat) dismissed the study as [...] "damaged goods," [...] and [...] "a pre-determined anti-rail rant." [...] He also pointed to several conclusions as [...] "erroneous" [...] and [...] "inaccurate" [...] before concluding that [...] "spending a third of a million dollars for this shoddy, biased analysis is an appalling waste of our tax dollars." [...] Lingle's Democratic successor, Neil Abercrombie, publicly stated that the <b>financial</b> <b>analysis</b> would not affect his decision to approve or disapprove of the project, saying that the state's responsibility is limited to the environmental review process, and that decisions regarding the project's finances belong to the city and the FTA. [...] Governor Abercrombie subsequently approved the project's final environmental impact statement on December 16, 2010.
