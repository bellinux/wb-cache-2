25|$|The {{dominance}} {{continued in}} the 1990s, starting with a grand final loss in 1991, and a Challenge Yves du Manoir championship in 1993, defeating Castres 13 to 8 in the final. The mid-1990s saw Stade Toulousain become a major force yet again, as the club claimed four premierships in a row, winning the championship in 1994, 1995, 1996 and 1997, {{as well as the}} Challenge Yves du Manoir in 1995. The club emmulated its success in the <b>European</b> <b>Rugby</b> <b>Cup,</b> becoming the first ever champions in the 1995–96 season.|$|E
25|$|It was {{not until}} the late 1980s that BO, as it is nicknamed, was going to reach the top again. In 1989 Biarritz contested their first Challenge Yves du Manoir final since the 1937 season. However, they were {{defeated}} by RC Narbonne 18–12 in the final. In 1992, Biarritz made it to the national final, played at Parc des Princes in Paris. However, Biarritz went down to RC Toulon 19 points to 14. In the 1997–98 season, Biarritz competed in their first <b>European</b> <b>Rugby</b> <b>Cup</b> competition, playing in the European Challenge Cup. Biarritz won three of their six fixtures, and did not make it past the pool stages. The 1998–99 season was similar to the previous, though they were able to win one more of their pool fixtures, but finished third in the pool standings after other French clubs Agen and Brive.|$|E
500|$|The {{rarity of}} a penalty {{shoot-out}} in rugby meant that no standard format existed and tournament organisers {{were left to}} devise their own rules on the format a shoot-out would take in the event it was required, such as the positions the kicks would be taken from, the type of kick used and the number and order of players who would participate. In {{the case of the}} Heineken Cup, the rules set by organisers <b>European</b> <b>Rugby</b> <b>Cup</b> (ERC) prescribed a format closely resembling that used in soccer matches. Each team would alternately take five place kicks, each from the same position on the 22-metre line, {{directly in front of the}} posts. Each kick had to be taken by a different player from the 15 players that were present on the pitch at the end of extra time. In the event the scores were level after the five kicks, [...] "sudden death" [...] would take place, with each team alternately taking a kick until a round occurred where one team was successful with their kick and the other team missed. Again, each kick was required to be taken by a different player, starting with players that had yet to take a kick in the first part of the shoot-out. If no winner had been decided after all 15 players had attempted a kick, the process would continue with each player eligible to take a kick again until all 15 players had made another attempt.|$|E

2500|$|The {{late 1990s}} and the 2000s saw the club again reach great heights. The club won the Challenge Yves du Manoir in 1998, {{defeating}} Stade Français Paris, and the 1999 championship {{as well as}} the 2001 championship and were runners-up in the 2003 season, losing to Stade Français in the final. As the club had done in the mid-1990s, Stade Toulousain replicated this success in the <b>European</b> <b>Rugby</b> <b>Cup,</b> winning the 2002–03 championship and the 2004–05 championship. The club made it to the final of the 2005–06 Top 14, and despite only trailing Biarritz 9–6 at half time, Toulouse could not prevent a second-half whitewash, eventually going down 40–13. They ended their seven-year title drought with a 26–20 win over ASM Clermont Auvergne on 28 June 2008. [...] In 2008 they narrowly lost a Heineken Cup Final to Munster by 3 points. In 2010 Toulouse defeated Leinster to reach the final where they faced Biarritz Olympique at Stade de France in Paris on Saturday 22 May 2010. Toulouse won the game by 21–19 to claim their fourth Heineken Cup title, making them the only club to ever win the title four times. Stade Toulousain is also the only French club to have taken part in all the editions of Heineken Cup since its creation (17, with the 2011–12 season). [...] They won the French championship in 2011 against Montpellier (15–10) and 2012 against Toulon (18–12). Stade Toulousain reached the semi-finals of the French championship 20 consecutive years (from 1994 to 2013).|$|E
