50|$|Many FTP servers for POSIX systems use the chroot {{mechanism}} to sandbox untrusted FTP clients.

50|$|The TCP {{protocol}} has a three {{state system}} for opening a connection. First, the originating endpoint (A) sends a SYN packet to the destination (B). A {{is now in}} an embryonic state (specifically, SYN_SENT), and awaiting a response. B now updates its kernel information to indicate the <b>incoming</b> <b>connection</b> from A, and sends out a request to open a channel back (the SYN/ACK packet).|$|E
50|$|Within a few years, open relays became {{rare and}} spammers resorted to other tactics, most {{prominently}} {{the use of}} open proxies. A proxy is a network service for making indirect connections to other network services. The client connects to the proxy and instructs it to connect to a server. The server perceives an <b>incoming</b> <b>connection</b> from the proxy, not the original client. Proxies have many purposes, including Web-page caching, protection of privacy, filtering of Web content, and selectively bypassing firewalls.|$|E
5000|$|Winsock 2 was a backwards-compatible {{extension}} of Winsock 1.1. It added support for protocol-independent name resolution, asynchronous operations with event-based notifications and completion routines, layered protocol implementations, multicasting, {{and quality of}} service. It also formalized support for multiple protocols, including IPX/SPX and DECnet. The new specification allowed sockets to be optionally shared between processes, <b>incoming</b> <b>connection</b> requests to be conditionally accepted, and certain operations to be performed on socket groups rather than individual sockets. Although the new specification differed substantially from Winsock 1, it provided source- and binary-level compatibility with the Winsock 1.1 API. One of the lesser known additions was the Service Provider Interface (SPI) API and Layered Service Providers.|$|E
50|$|To connect {{from behind}} a firewall, one party must have the proper port {{forwarded}} to their computer; as WASTE networks do not depend on a central server {{there is no way}} around this. However, as long as one node accepts <b>incoming</b> <b>connections</b> it can act as a server, connecting nodes that cannot themselves accept <b>incoming</b> <b>connections.</b> Indeed, the long-term stability of a WASTE network depends on these hubs.|$|R
50|$|By default, WASTE {{listens to}} <b>incoming</b> <b>connections</b> on port 1337. This was {{probably}} chosen because of 1337's leet connotations.|$|R

50|$|ODMR {{works in}} the {{following}} way: to check their inbound mail, customers issue EHLO and AUTH commands to the ODMR service, followed by ATRN command (Authenticated TuRN); after a successful ATRN command the ODMR server begins {{to act as an}} SMTP client and starts to send all messages directed to the customer's domain (or domains) using SMTP protocol, via the same TCP connection. Since connections are initiated by customers, this protocol works well for machines having dynamically assigned IPs and/or are firewall protected (i.e. your ISP may block <b>incoming</b> <b>connection</b> on port 25 or may use NAT). Only the ODMR server, referred as the provider, must listen to SMTP connections on a fixed IP address.|$|E
50|$|Simple {{firewalls}} {{that are}} configured to allow all outgoing connections but to restrict which ports an <b>incoming</b> <b>connection</b> can reach (for example, allow incoming connections to a Web server on port 80 but restrict all other ports), work by blocking only incoming SYN requests to unwanted ports. If SYN cookies are in operation, {{care should be}} taken to ensure an attacker is not able to bypass such a firewall by forging ACKs instead, trying random sequence numbers until one is accepted. SYN cookies should be switched on and off on a per-port basis, so that SYN cookies being enabled on a public port does not cause them to be recognised on a non-public port.|$|E
30|$|We use NiRTT to {{represent}} the number of RTTs for the <b>incoming</b> <b>connection</b> of host hi, NoRTT the number of RTTs for the <b>incoming</b> <b>connection</b> of host hi, and ΔioRTT {{the difference between these}} numbers. The value of this difference can be used to determine the probability that the two connections are relayed. The larger ΔioRTT, the lower the probability that the two connections are relayed, and the lower the probability that the host hi is used as a stepping-stone.|$|E

Based on the estimated system capacity and network loads and QoS parameters, the BS will compute the admission criteria for the <b>incoming</b> <b>connection</b> with its specific QoS parameters.|$|E
30|$|We {{capture and}} analyze an {{interactive}} TCP connection that is established using the open source tool OpenSSH {{for a given}} period of time. We will capture all the send packets in the outgoing connection of a sensor and all the echo packets in the <b>incoming</b> <b>connection</b> and store them in two different sequences respectively represented by S (with n send packets) and E (with m echo packets).|$|E
30|$|The paper [12] {{proposed}} a new method {{to determine whether}} an <b>incoming</b> <b>connection</b> and an outgoing connection are a relayed pair using the number of RTTs in a connection together with the random-walk approach, instead of using the number of packets monitored. This new approach can defeat intruders’ chaff-perturbation and time-jittering manipulation without the two assumptions described above that were made in all prior work.|$|E

Routers must not forward packets with the unspecified address.Applications may be listening on one or more specific interfaces for <b>incoming</b> <b>connections,</b> which are shown in listings of active internet connections by a specific IP address (and a port number, separated by a colon).

30|$|Using a content-thumbprint {{is one way}} to find a relayed {{connection}} pair on a host. As {{shown in}} Fig.  1, we assume that Host i is used as a sensor. To determine whether Host i is used as a stepping-stone using content-thumbprint, it is necessary to sniff the TCP packets from the <b>incoming</b> <b>connection</b> of the sensor for a certain time interval, e.g., 5  min. Applying a hash method to the contents from all the sniffed packets, we can obtain a hashed result which is called a content-thumbprint Ctb-in for the <b>incoming</b> <b>connection.</b> In the same time interval, we sniff TCP packets on the outgoing connection of the sensor and get another content-thumbprint Ctb-out. We can determine whether Host i is used as a stepping-stone by comparing Ctb-in with Ctb-out to see if they are close enough. Of course, this approach to detect stepping-stone intrusion can only apply to unencrypted sessions. For the details about applying a content-thumbprint to detect stepping-stone intrusion, please refer to the paper [1].|$|E
30|$|In an {{interactive}} TCP session, the user will enter a command such a Linux command “ls” by typing {{a list of}} letters (for example, l, s, etc.) and then execute the command on the server machine. The result responses from the remote sever will {{be a number of}} packets containing the output generated by executing the command. In general, the user machine will receive an Echo packet as a response whenever the user enters one letter on his machine as a command or a part of a command. If the command is a single letter, the packet is called a single-letter send or a single-letter echo, respectively. To this end, we only consider the single-letter send packets of the outgoing connection and the single-letter echo packets of the <b>incoming</b> <b>connection.</b> If the two connections of the sensor are a relayed stepping-stone pair, then the number of the send packets in the outgoing connection should be very close to the number of the echo packets in the <b>incoming</b> <b>connection</b> of the sensor.|$|E
30|$|There {{are free}} {{connection}} resources {{at a given}} carrier for the new <b>incoming</b> <b>connection</b> request. A blocking {{due to the lack}} of free connection-resources will be called hard-blocking. In practice, the network operator can configure the maximum number of simultaneous connections that the SC can support. According to this, a hard-blocking will occur when a new connection request cannot be processed because the maximum number of simultaneous connections has already been reached.|$|E
