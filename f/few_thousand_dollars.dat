5|$|In the 15 {{years since}} he had left Red River, his {{megalomania}} had grown greater than ever. His ungovernable rages, delusions of grandeur, messianic claims, and dictatorial impulses had all become more extreme; but these violent excesses {{were not the only}} symptoms of his curious mental and moral decline. He had lost his shrewd appreciation of realities. His sense of direction was confused in his purposes were equivocal. He showed, at intervals, a cynical selfishness and the ruthless cupidity.... although in public he professed that his sole aim was the redress of the Métis grievances, and private he was quite ready to promise that if the government made him a satisfactory personal payment of a <b>few</b> <b>thousand</b> <b>dollars</b> he would induce his credulous followers to accept almost any settlement the federal authorities desired, and would quietly leave Canada forever.|$|E

25|$|Desperate union {{officials}} turned to violence {{to counter the}} setbacks they had suffered. Beginning in late 1906, national and local officials of the Iron Workers launched a dynamiting campaign. The goal of the campaign was to bring the companies to the bargaining table, and not to destroy plants or kill people. Between 1906 and 1911, the Iron Workers blew up 110 iron works, though only a <b>few</b> <b>thousand</b> <b>dollars</b> in damages was done. The National Erectors' Association was well aware {{who was responsible for}} the bombings, since Herbert S. Hockin, a member of the Iron Workers' executive board, was their paid spy.|$|E

25|$|Police officers, soldiers, or militiamen {{have been}} implicated {{in most of the}} hundred or so murders of journalists since {{democracy}} was restored in 1986. Employed by corrupt politicians or hired as contract killers, they usually target local radio presenters who have upset the people they are working for. The same modus operandi is nearly always used: two masked men on a motorcycle gun the journalist down as he is leaving his place of work. For a <b>few</b> <b>thousand</b> <b>dollars,</b> they eliminate the person who has been too outspoken. The cycle of violence has never ended because the culture of impunity is so strong, especially on Mindanao.|$|E

25|$|On July 13, {{the kidnappers}} {{contacted}} Sergio Cázares Garza, {{one of the}} family members who lived in Texas, and told him that his remaining relatives would be released if the family paid a ransom. Initially, the family said they could only pay a <b>few</b> <b>thousand</b> <b>dollars,</b> but the captors allowed for them to have at least two days to collect more money. In total, the Cázares made four different payments to the kidnappers in Matamoros in a sum of US$100,000. The first one was delivered at a grocery store parking lot and the second one was left behind a fast-food eatery. The kidnappers communicated with the Cázares family that was in hiding in Texas through telephone, and the cash deliveries were made by a trusted employee of the family in Matamoros. Each time the deliveries were made, the Gulf Cartel sent a different envoy to pick up the money from the Cázares at a disclosed location.|$|E
25|$|The Republic of Texas era {{with the}} Indians {{can be divided}} into three phases: the {{diplomacy}} of Houston during his first term, the hostility of Lamar, and the resumed diplomatic efforts of Houston's second term. Sam Houston led the Republic to negotiate with the Comanche. They said they would stop raiding if they were given sufficient amounts of what they considered prerequisites for peaceful relations: gifts, trade, and regular face-to-face diplomacy. Houston, who enjoyed a good reputation among Indians, had married a mixed-race woman of Cherokee descent. He had lived in Indian Territory for years and learned about their cultures. He was willing to meet with the Comanche on their terms and believed, as a matter of policy, that it was worth it to buy a <b>few</b> <b>thousand</b> <b>dollars</b> worth of presents. The Republic could not support the huge cost of a standing army for defense, and it {{might not be able to}} defeat the assembled might of the entire Comanche-Kiowa alliance, especially if they received Mexican help.|$|E
25|$|Following the film's success, the group, without Hardin, {{moved to}} Los Angeles. Upon arrival, they met {{a lawyer for}} the William Morris Agency who {{connected}} them with producer Scott Rudin. As a result, the duo acquired a lawyer, an agent, and a script deal. Despite initially believing themselves {{to be on the verge}} of success, the duo struggled for several years. Stone slept on dirty laundry for upwards of a year because he could not afford to purchase a mattress. They unsuccessfully pitched a children's program titled Time Warped to Fox Kids, which would have involved fictionalized stories of people in history. The trio created two separate pilots, spaced a year apart, and despite the approval of development executive Pam Brady, the network disbanded the Fox Kids division. While at Fox, executive Brian Graden cut Parker and Stone a personal check of a <b>few</b> <b>thousand</b> <b>dollars</b> to produce a video greeting card he could deliver to friends; the film would be a sequel to their earlier short Jesus vs. Frosty.|$|E

500|$|After the 1942 recordings, Sinatra {{believed}} {{he needed to}} go solo, with an insatiable desire to compete with Bing Crosby, but he was hampered by his contract which gave Dorsey 43% of Sinatra's lifetime earnings in the entertainment industry. [...] A legal battle ensued, eventually settled in August 1943. On September 3, 1942, Dorsey bid farewell to Sinatra, reportedly saying as Sinatra left, [...] "I hope you fall on your ass". He replaced Sinatra with singer Dick Haymes. Rumors began spreading in newspapers that Sinatra's mobster godfather, Willie Moretti, coerced Dorsey to let Sinatra out of his contract for a <b>few</b> <b>thousand</b> <b>dollars,</b> holding {{a gun to his}} head. Sinatra persuaded Stordahl to leave Dorsey with him and become his personal arranger, offering him $650 a month, five times the salary of Dorsey. Dorsey and Sinatra, who had been very close, never patched up their differences before Dorsey's death in 1956, worsened by the fact that Dorsey occasionally made biting comments to the press such as [...] "he's the most fascinating man in the world, but don't put your hand in the cage".|$|E

60|$|As yet {{no light}} has been shed upon {{the mystery of}} leprosy. When more is learned about the disease, a cure for it may be expected. Once an efficacious serum is {{discover}}ed, and leprosy, {{because it is so}} feebly contagious, will pass away swiftly from the earth. The battle waged with it will be short and sharp. In the meantime, how to discover that serum, or some other unguessed weapon? In the present it is a serious matter. It is estimated that there are half a million lepers, not segregated, in India alone. Carnegie libraries, Rockefeller universities, and many similar benefactions are all very well; but one cannot help thinking how far a <b>few</b> <b>thousands</b> of <b>dollars</b> would go, say in the leper Settlement of Molokai. The residents there are accidents of fate, scapegoats to some mysterious natural law of which man knows nothing, isolated for the welfare of their fellows who else might catch the dread disease, even as they have caught it, nobody knows how. Not for their sakes merely, but for the sake of future generations, a <b>few</b> <b>thousands</b> of <b>dollars</b> would go far in a legitimate and scientific search after a cure for leprosy, for a serum, or for some undreamed discovery that will enable the medical world to exterminate the bacillus leprae.

50|$|Together, the {{hardware}} and software provided a low-cost video editing suite for a <b>few</b> <b>thousand</b> U.S. <b>dollars</b> that rivaled the output of professional systems costing ten times as much at the time.

The Video Toaster won the Emmy Award for Technical Achievement in 1993. Other parts of the original software package were spun off as stand-alone products, notably LightWave 3D, and achieved success on their own.|$|R
500|$|Despite its notorious reputation, {{there were}} a few cases of honest and hardworking karung guni men who made good, and became millionaires. One was Poon Buck Seng who started his {{business}} with only a capital of S$50 by picking up junk, or paying small amounts for things people were throwing away in the 1980s. He would then take his goods to sell at the Sungei Road Thieves' Market. Within seven years, he had saved enough money to rent a shop space nearby, and expanded his business to sell bigger used items like computers, refrigerators, videotape recorders and television sets, in addition to old clothes, shoes and records. In 1993, he registered his second-hand goods trading business and began to focus his business in exporting used computer parts, as there were not many people doing that back then, and his business thrived. He made a <b>few</b> <b>thousand</b> <b>dollars</b> every month and five years later, Poon had saved enough money to buy a [...] freehold property worth S$730,000 and was offered S$1.4 million for the unit in a collective sale later. His export business lasted only 10 years. By 2002, Poon's business was declining as too many people had jumped onto the bandwagon. He decided to end his export business and went back to his old karung guni trade again that lasts to this very day.|$|E
