In the Reformation Martin Luther explained how Job's confession of sinfulness and worthlessness underlay his saintliness, and John Calvin's Job demonstrated the doctrine of the resurrection and the ultimate certainty of divine justice.|$|E
25|$|Many reports erroneously {{stated that}} Borel's room {{was full of}} Nazi-insignia, and rumors he was sympathizing with fascist {{ideologies}} were spurred even more {{by the fact that}} his stepfather had attended several meetings of the Front National in 1989. But besides a picture of Adolf Hitler cut out from a newspaper, graffiti displaying a swastika on his door, a few books on World War II, as well as a documentary about David Koresh and the Waco siege, no evidence was found after his death that he was interested in any kind of politics. Also, a girl from Cuers spread the story that Eric had told her about his relationship with his half-sister Caroline, {{who was supposed to be}} his pregnant girlfriend.

500|$|The video {{begins at}} a press conference where Spears, wearing a cropped Mickey Mouse top (paying homage to her days in The New Mickey Mouse Club), is being asked {{inappropriate}} questions by news reporters, such as [...] "Is <b>it</b> <b>true</b> you banned junk food, smiles, candy, sunshine and laughter from your Femme Fatale tour?" [...] Angered by the questions, Spears replies (albeit censored): [...] "Fuck you, fuck you, fuck you, you're cool, fuck you – I'm out", referencing a scene from the film Half Baked. After leaving the press conference, Spears walks out of the building and out into the street, wearing a white leather jacket and a black skirt with matching with studded combat boots. She signs a fan's copy of Femme Fatale and then blows a kiss to a baby as he whistles the melody of the chorus. As Spears walks along the street, she flashes several men, including a policeman (played by Adrien Galo). As a criminal offence, the policeman searches Spears, feeling up and down her legs, as she is bent over a car. Spears later walks away from the policeman, swinging handcuffs around her finger while he buttons his shirt.|$|E
500|$|By 1970, Northrup and Hollister {{had moved}} to Maui, Hawaii. Northrup's {{daughter}} Alexis, who was by now twenty-one years old, attempted to contact her father but was rebuffed in a handwritten statement in which Hubbard denied that he was her father: [...] "Your mother was with me as a secretary in Savannah in late 1948 [...] [...] [...] In July 1949 I was in Elizabeth, New Jersey, writing a movie. She turned up destitute and pregnant." [...] He said that Northrup had been a Nazi spy {{during the war and}} accused her and Hollister of using the divorce case to seize control of Dianetics: [...] "They obtained considerable newspaper publicity, none of <b>it</b> <b>true,</b> and employed the highest priced divorce attorney in the US to sue me for divorce and get the foundation in Los Angeles in settlement. This proved a puzzle since where there is no legal marriage, there can't be any divorce." [...] Despite clearly being written by Hubbard, who spoke in the first person in the letter, it was signed [...] "Your good friend, J. Edgar Hoover". Even his own staff were shocked by the contents of Hubbard's letter; he ended his instructions to them with the statement, [...] "Decency is not a subject well understood".|$|E

500|$|A few critics {{suggested}} {{freedom as}} a theme {{in light of}} the importance shown by the characters to <b>it.</b> <b>True</b> to its title, which is a Romani word for freedom, [...] Gatlif used his freedom to direct a tangential, poignant romantic story with the historical documents available to him, unlike other movies with similar themes, remarked Jacques Mandelbaum at Le Monde. The Village Voice review declared that it is [...] "a magnificent paean to the mad ecstasy of freedom". The Arizona Reporter review added that, for the Romani, freedom means [...] "being able to keep in motion, that is, the journey, not the destination, is the reward". It observed the importance the characters give to freedom, citing the scene where Taloche becomes concerned that water is being [...] "held against its will" [...] in the taps, and [...] "releases" [...] it to overflow the sink onto the bathroom floor, and then the stairs, with Taloche blissfully sliding down the stairs as if he were on a Disney ride. Alexis Campion at Le Journal du Dimanche remarked that Gatlif has refreshingly portrayed the Romani as [...] "free-spirited" [...] characters and added that this historic film is a tribute to those free souls who take to the streets even today. The Télérama review was of the opinion that the movie runs out of steam during the scenes depicting historic events, but gains momentum in the forests and on the roads, where its characters' passion for freedom, and hence Lavoine's and Croze's characters, get sidelined by that of Thierrée's, with his St. Vitus' dance and Dostoyevsky-like ruminations. It added that Taloche is the true [...] "incarnation" [...] of freedom.|$|E
