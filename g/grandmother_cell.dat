50|$|The <b>grandmother</b> <b>cell</b> hypothesis, is {{an extreme}} version {{of the idea of}} sparseness, and is not without critics. The {{opposite}} of the <b>grandmother</b> <b>cell</b> theory is the distributed representation theory, that states that a specific stimulus is coded by its unique pattern of activity over a large group of neurons widely distributed in the brain.|$|E
5000|$|Grandmother {{cells can}} be {{explained}} in a much simpler way. As Munevar proposes, grandmother cells are in fact the output cells of neural nets rather than cells acting independently. The existence of grandmother cells clashes with {{the model of the}} brain as a distributive system and is improbable because such neurons would have powers of representation across visuals angles and contexts. [...] The distributive explanation argues that the <b>grandmother</b> <b>cell</b> is nothing but the single-neuron output stage of a neural network trained to recognize a person. The hypothetical <b>grandmother</b> <b>cell</b> does not have any extraordinary binding properties. They are properties of the neural network instead.|$|E
5000|$|Konorski first {{proposed}} two key concepts in neuroscience (independently of Western scientists who also suggested them). The <b>grandmother</b> <b>cell</b> of the West which Konorski called [...] "gnostic unit." [...] This {{was developed in}} great detail in his 1967 book.|$|E
50|$|In PDP, <b>grandmother</b> <b>cells</b> are a {{thing to}} ridicule. Finkel called them infamous <b>grandmother</b> <b>cells,</b> and Connor said {{no one wants to}} be accused of believing in <b>grandmother</b> <b>cells.</b> 50 years of studies {{involving}} PDP and <b>grandmother</b> <b>cells</b> have not really found any <b>grandmother</b> <b>cells,</b> but rather that the brain codes information with a form of distributed coding. Localist models ignore the neuroscience data taken to support distributed coding schemes, specifically single cell electrophysiological recording studies. Localist models are instead often supported by neuropsychological data. Biologically, the PDP model is superior and can be supported using the many different methods and studies. This includes studies of PDP in the brain, as discussed by Bowers.|$|R
50|$|In {{a recent}} article Quiroga, Kreiman, Koch and Fried {{admitted}} they had in fact not found <b>grandmother</b> <b>cells,</b> rather they had found sparse coding. The main question was how information was represented in the upper stages of the hierarchy, and still made accessible to perceptual, cognitive and mnemonic processes. This is why sparse coding became an alternative to <b>grandmother</b> <b>cells.</b> The idea of sparse coding is that very small numbers of neurons respond to specific features, objects or concepts in an obvious manner.|$|R
50|$|One {{idea has}} been that such cells form {{ensembles}} for the coarse or distributed coding of faces rather than detectors for specific faces. Thus, a specific grandmother may be represented by a specialized ensemble of grandmother or near <b>grandmother</b> <b>cells.</b>|$|R
5000|$|A neuron {{normally}} fires when {{excited by}} one very specific feature of a stimulus. In a study performed by Logothetis and Pauls, this is {{seen with the}} spiking of a single macaque monkey neuron when presented with a paper clip bent {{in a certain way}} at a variety of angles. At a specific angle, the neuron fires rapidly. At different angles or shapes, it does not. A <b>grandmother</b> <b>cell,</b> by contrast, would seem to fire at many different shapes and angles. And {{it is very difficult to}} imagine what kind of mechanism [...] "will bind ... information from disparate sensory sources" [...] in a cell, which makes a <b>grandmother</b> <b>cell</b> [...] "a tremendous connectivity puzzle".|$|E
50|$|The presumed <b>grandmother</b> <b>cell</b> {{responds}} to a seemingly impossible {{large number of}} stimuli. If the stimulus is a photo of your grandmother looking straight into the camera, the cell fires. If the stimulus is a painting of your grandmother in profile, the same cell fires. If the stimulus is a sketch of your grandmother walking away, drawn by a street artist, the same cell fires.|$|E
50|$|Jerzy Konorski (December 1, 1903 in Łódź, Congress Poland - November 14, 1973 in Warsaw, Poland) was a Polish {{neurophysiologist}} who further {{developed the}} work of Ivan Pavlov by discovering secondary conditioned reflexes and operant conditioning. He also proposed the idea of gnostic neurons, a concept similar to the <b>grandmother</b> <b>cell.</b> He coined the term neural plasticity, and he developed theoretical ideas regarding it {{that are similar to}} those proposed soon after by Donald Hebb.|$|E
50|$|This neuron {{activates}} when {{a person}} identifies a specific entity, such as his or her grandmother. These neurons would activate not only when presented with a family member, but also when presented with celebrities such as Halle Berry. The term was coined by Jerry Lettvin around 1969. A similar concept had been proposed {{a few years earlier}} by Jerzy Konorski who called such cells gnostic units. Since <b>grandmother</b> <b>cells</b> are highly controversial it was very surprising when Kreiman announced in 2001 that he had discovered one. Since then, several explanations of such findings have been proposed which do not involve <b>grandmother</b> <b>cells.</b> One explanation is based on sparse coding and another on neural nets.|$|R
50|$|Being able to {{find one}} cell would be a {{difficult}} task. It seems implausible that <b>grandmother</b> <b>cells</b> have any extraordinary binding properties. They are the properties of sparse coding instead. It {{should also be noted}} that it is difficult to detect sparse firing neurons. Single electrode recordings with moveable probes are used to detect firing, but it is common to miss firing cells.|$|R
50|$|Overall, visual {{information}} {{goes through the}} ventral pathway. Evidence that was obtained from recordings of single-neuron activity in humans suggests that a subset of MTL neurons presents an invariant representation of perceived objects. This means that the neurons respond to abstract concepts rather than more basic metric details. This information favors sparse coding over <b>grandmother</b> <b>cells,</b> because the neurons fire only to very few stimuli, and are mostly silent {{with the exception of}} their preferred stimuli.|$|R
5000|$|The <b>grandmother</b> <b>cell</b> is a {{hypothetical}} neuron {{that represents a}} complex but specific concept or object. It activates when a person [...] "sees, hears, or otherwise sensibly discriminates" [...] a specific entity, such as his or her grandmother. The term was in use at least as early as 1966 amongst staff and students in the Department of Experimental Psychology, University of Cambridge, England. A similar concept, that of the gnostic neuron, was proposed two years later by Jerzy Konorski.|$|E
50|$|This account {{extends beyond}} the {{discrimination}} between two alternatives (mines and rocks) to that between different faces. Therefore, the distributive brain may have a single-cell output layer fire whenever a specific person, e.g. your grandmother, is presented to the eye; although many famous people, such as Jennifer Aniston or Halle Berry, may be of greater interest. Neural networks, then, explain very plausibly the otherwise paradoxical results of the recent <b>grandmother</b> <b>cell</b> experiments. Neural nets are a form of parallel distributed processing.|$|E
5000|$|In 2001, Kreiman {{announced}} that he had found a <b>grandmother</b> <b>cell.</b> This [...] "neuron in the human amygdala, for example, fires to a caricature, a portrait, and a group photo of President Clinton, but not to 47 other pictures of famous men, presidents, and a variety of objects". In 2004, Koch affirmed [...] "such cells do exist". In 2005, Quiroga and coworkers obtained similar results. However, in 2007, Quiroga, Kreiman, Koch and Fried rescinded their initial views, trying to explain their results with sparse coding.|$|E
50|$|Churchland {{explains}} that neural nets contain three basic levels. The levels are the input layer, hidden layer and output layer. Munevar, following the PDP theory, believes that output cells {{can explain the}} presumed <b>grandmother</b> <b>cells.</b> PDP involves the performance of {{hundreds of millions of}} individual computation simultaneously, instead of in a lengthy sequence. It takes 10 milliseconds for a visual impulse to go across a sign layer to layer transformation, and reaches the 3rd layer where buried information has been made explicit.|$|R
5000|$|Sparse coding {{often takes}} place in the hippocampus. The medial {{temporal}} lobe is critical for long term memory, particularly episodic memories. Both the hippocampus and the cortex may interact to produce sparse coding. This helps with numerous tasks, including word, object and facial identification. [...] Sparse representations are also associated with parallel distributed processing which proves to have great success with rapid learning. It does not have success with generalization, though. Compared to <b>grandmother</b> <b>cells,</b> an individual neuron in sparse coding is involved in coding two things, and two neurons code for a specific stimulus.|$|R
5000|$|An {{alternative}} to the ensemble hypothesis is the theory that there exist highly specialized neurons that serve as the mechanism of neuronal encoding. In the visual system, such cells are {{often referred to as}} <b>grandmother</b> <b>cells</b> because they would respond in very specific circumstances—such as when a person gazes at a photo of their grandmother. Neuroscientists have indeed found that some neurons provide better information than the others, and a population of such expert neurons has an improved signal to noise ratio [...] However, the basic principle of ensemble encoding holds: large neuronal populations do better than single neurons.|$|R
40|$|Introduction. The "grandmother cell" has a {{long history}} in vision. Sometimes it is being {{proposed}} as a serious model for recognition problems, 4 and, more often, it is given as a straw man for how recognition could not possibly work. 9 In its usual form, the <b>grandmother</b> <b>cell</b> is described detecting the presence of features in particular locations of an image and firing when enough evidence for a grandmother (or whatever other kind of object the cell is specific for) has been found. Recently, there has been renewed interest in the <b>grandmother</b> <b>cell</b> because it can be shown that a small collection of such cells, each specific for some 2 D view of a 3 D object, can collectively approximate well the visual appearance of a 3 D object viewed from different angles. 10, 1 Those theoretical results together with psychophysical support 5 suggest that a <b>grandmother</b> <b>cell</b> approach, when worked out properly, might account for som...|$|E
40|$|The term “grandmother cell ” {{refers to}} a neuron that would respond only to a specific, complex, and meaning-ful stimulus, that is, to a single per-cept or even a single concept. As {{originally}} conceived, a <b>grandmother</b> <b>cell</b> was multimodal, but the term came to be used mostly for repre-senting a visual percept. As we shall see, the term arose because the first such neuron was postulated to repre-sent a grandmother. There might be many grandmother cells responding to a specific stimulus, such as one grandmother, but their response properties would be the same. Because of this redundancy, {{the loss of a}} <b>grandmother</b> <b>cell</b> or two might not result in loss of the percept. “Coding by grandmother cells ” is at the other extreme from “ensemble,” “coarse, ” or “population ” coding in which a grandmother or other stimu-lus is coded by the pattern of activity over a group of neurons. In ensemble coding, there are no “grandmother cells ” that detect the unique collec-tion of features that characterize a grandmother. Rather, each member of the ensemble responds somewhat differently, for example, to a granny’s wrinkles, white hair, or to several different old women; the cod-ing of a specific grandmother is done by a unique pattern of activation across the ensemble. Starting in the early 1970 s, the term <b>grandmother</b> <b>cell</b> moved from laboratory jargon and jokes into neu-roscience journals and serious dis-cussions of the bases of pattern per-ception (e. g., Barlow 1972; Blake...|$|E
40|$|Bowers {{challenged}} the common view {{in favor of}} distributed representations in psychological modeling and the main arguments given against localist and <b>grandmother</b> <b>cell</b> coding schemes. He revisited the results of several single-cell studies, arguing {{that they do not}} support distributed representations. We praise the contribution of Bowers (2009) for joining evidence from psychological modeling and neurophysiological recordings, but we disagree with several of his claims. In this comment, we argue that distinctions between distributed, localist, and <b>grandmother</b> <b>cell</b> coding can be troublesome with real data. Moreover, these distinctions seem to be lying within the same continuum, and we argue that it may be sensible to characterize coding schemes with a sparseness measure. We further argue that there may not be a unique coding scheme implemented in all brain areas and for all possible functions. In particular, current evidence suggests that the brain may use distributed codes in primary sensory areas and sparser and invariant representations in higher areas. 4147...|$|E
50|$|Hubel and Wiesel's {{investigation}} of the cat visual cortex sparked interest in the feature detection hypothesis and its relevance to other sensory systems. In fact, T.H. Bullock contended in 1961 that the vestibular system was being ignored {{by most of the}} contemporary sensory system research, and he suggested that the equivalent stimulation of vestibular organs may yield similarly intriguing results. Hubel and Wiesel's work also raised the question: How far does the hierarchy of visual processing go? In one answer to this question, Lettvin coined the term <b>grandmother</b> <b>cells</b> in 1969 to describe hypothetical cells that are so specific that they only fire when your grandmother's face is viewed.|$|R
5000|$|Cottrell, in {{research}} at the University of California at San Diego, developed the artificial neural network which had a 64 X 64 pixel grid with 256 activation levels. The network consisted of recognizable representations of real faces. [...] Each input cell had a radiating set of axonal end branches to every cell in the middle layer. The middle layer is hidden and projects the coding from 80 cells to the eight output cells. These eight output cells could discriminate faces from non-faces just like <b>grandmother</b> <b>cells</b> are thought to do. Cottrell {{had no idea how}} synaptic connections should be configured in the artificial neural network. Cottrell overcame this issue by using a biologically realistic adjustment.|$|R
30|$|An {{example of}} a {{standard}} neuroscience flow explanation is the neuroscience of visual perception, which has been traced through the retina, the lateral geniculate body, a few rings of the visual cortex, and to the superior temporal lobe of various mammals, including humans. Cells at successive levels respond to increasingly abstract features of visual stimuli. Experience using connections is needed to maintain them, and connections may be inhibited (suppressed) by some sort of modulation (as occurs in strabismus-induced amblyopia, an interesting condition that I have myself). Although we are increasingly sure that complex visual recognition, such as your recognition of the words of this text, occurs in the temporal lobe, somehow, the search for <b>grandmother</b> <b>cells</b> has not yet completely succeeded.|$|R

40|$|A {{fundamental}} claim {{associated with}} {{parallel distributed processing}} (PDP) theories of cognition is that knowledge is coded in a distributed manner in mind and brain. This approach rejects the claim that knowledge is coded in a localist fashion, with words, objects, and simple concepts (e. g. “dog”), that is, coded with their own dedicated representations. One of the putative advantages {{of this approach is}} that the theories are biologically plausible. Indeed, advocates of the PDP approach often highlight the close parallels between distributed representations learned in connectionist models and neural coding in brain and often dismiss localist (<b>grandmother</b> <b>cell)</b> theories as biologically implausible. The author reviews a range a data that strongly challenge this claim and shows that localist models provide a better account of single-cell recording studies. The author also contrast local and alternative distributed coding schemes (sparse and coarse coding) and argues that common rejection of <b>grandmother</b> <b>cell</b> theories in neuroscience is due to a misunderstanding about how localist models behave. The author concludes that the localist representations embedded in theories of perception and cognition are consistent with neuroscience; biology only calls into question the distributed representations often learned in PDP models...|$|E

40|$|Abstract: 2 ̆ 2 BoltzCONS is a connectionist {{model that}} {{dynamically}} creates and manipulates composite symbol structures. These structures are implemented using a functional analog of linked lists, but BoltzCONS employs distributed representations and associative retrieval {{in place of}} a conventional memory organization. Associative retrieval leads to some interesting properties. For example, the model can instantaneously access any uniquely-named internal node of a tree. But the point of the work is not to reimplement linked lists in some peculiar new way; it is to show how neural networks can exhibit compositionality and distal access (the ability to reference a complex structure via an abbreviated tag), two properties that distinguish symbol processing from lower-level cognitive functions such as pattern recognition. Unlike certain other neural net models, BoltzCONS represents objects as a collection of superimposed activity patterns rather than as a set of weights. It can therefore create new stuctured objects dynamically, without reliance on iterative training procedures, without rehearsal of previously learned patterns, and without resorting to <b>grandmother</b> <b>cells.</b> 2 ̆...|$|R

And the whole cerebrum is a real-time statistical Turing Machine, with powerful representing and learning ability. This model can reconcile some important disputations, such as: temporal coding versus rate based coding, <b>grandmother</b> <b>cell</b> versus population coding, and decay theory versus interference theory.

40|$|Abstract—Gaze {{movement}} {{plays an}} important role in human visual search system. In literature, the winner-take-all method is wildly used to simulate the controlling of the gaze movement. The winner-take-all is a type of single-cell coding method, which uses one cell (<b>grandmother</b> <b>cell)</b> or one response to represent an object. However, eye movement is affected by the visual context which includes more than one object in images, especially in target search. Therefore, we propose to use the population coding with more than one response rather than the single-cell coding on gaze movement control. The proposed method is supported by the theoretical analysis and experiments on a real image database which show the population-cell-coding improves the target locating accuracy by 44. 4 % only at the cost of coding 22. 4 % more information than that of single-cell-coding.

40|$|In this article, I {{present the}} theory that localist {{representation}} is used widely in the brain starting from its earliest lev-els of processing.

However, neither Page (2000) nor Bowers (2009) claimed widespread use of local-ist representation in the brain. So this is a stronger position than that taken by either. To support the proposed theory, I present neurophysiological evidence, both old and new, and an analysis of localist and distributed representation definitions and models. “Meaning and interpretation ” on a stand-alone basis is the fundamental char-acter of a localist unit. In arguing for the proposed theory, I bring to the forefront the “meaning and interpretation ” aspect of localist cells and the evidence {{for it in the}} brain.

50|$|The Artificial Neural Network (ANN) was {{initially}} trained with 64 images, but was eventually pushed outside the training boundary. In a training session the facial recognition was performing at 100%. When the ANN performed facial recognition testing outside of training, {{the network was}} still performing at 100%. Even when one-fifth of the face {{was covered with a}} black strip the face was still 100% effective as long as the strip did not cover the forehead. The ANN proves another way in which a small number of cells can seem to do a big number of tasks. Previously, <b>grandmother</b> <b>cells</b> supposedly have a unique ability to complete these tasks. The input layer is variously activated by 80 holistic features which vector codes for the second layer. This vector code is an activation which allows the third layer to identify a known individual correctly. This is also the case in parallel distributed processing (PDP). PDP highlights the parallels between connectionist models and neural coding in the brain, while also dismissing localism.|$|R
40|$|Learning is {{of major}} {{interest}} for various fields, from human pathologies to artificial intelligence. Animal and biology experiments {{have provided a}} great amount of data in this area, especially in classical and operant conditioning. Reinforcement learning is largely used in computational models in order to reproduce and explain these observations. This method enables to model a wide range of phenomena from the neuronal level to the behavior of a whole organism. Studying how information about reward or punishment is processed in the brain is crucial in the understanding of the action selection and decision-making in normal and pathological conditions. Basal Ganglia are a group of nuclei playing a major role in processing motor, associative and limbic information [1] and could be specialized in resolving conflicts between these sub-systems that compete for access to limited cognitive ressources [2]. Dopaminergic neurons activity is believed {{to be related to the}} reward prediction error and is involved in long term potentiation (LTP) and depression (LTD) in the striatum [3]. We present here an abstract computational model of the Basal Ganglia using reinforcement learning and Bayesian inference. It is based on a dual pathway architecture similar to the direct / Go and indirect / NoGo pathways that have been found in biology [4]. The units could be seen as <b>grandmother</b> <b>cells,</b> with inputs consisting of states and outputs being actions. Thus as a result of the activity in both pathways, an action will be selected based on the state and the previous outcomes of the different actions when dealing with the same state, that is if a reward has been obtained or not.
