40|$|This study {{addressed}} {{the relationship among}} parent assertiveness, parent knowledge of special education and the <b>handicapping</b> <b>condition</b> of their child, and parent participation in {{the annual meeting of}} the School-Based Admissions and Release Committee (SBARC). Fifty-one (51) parents of learning disabled and mentally handicapped children in a suburban area of Kentucky participated in the study. The effects of the child’s <b>handicapping</b> <b>condition</b> and the number of years the child’s <b>handicapping</b> <b>condition</b> and the number of years the child had received special education on parent assertiveness, knowledge, and participation were also analyzed. Parents were given the Special Education Knowledge Survey, and experimenter developed measure of knowledge of special education and various handicapping conditions, and the Rathus Assertiveness Schedule. These parents’ interactions were observed during the annual SBARC meeting for their child and the amount of participation and topics of their contributions were recorded by an observer. It was found that the degree of parent assertiveness was significantly predictive of total parent participation in planning the handicapped child’s education, while parent knowledge (knowledge of special education and knowledge of the child’s <b>handicapping</b> <b>condition)</b> did not predict the total amount of participation by the parent. Parent knowledge and the actual number of years the child had received special education were predictive of parent participation in the discussion of some topics regarding the child. The child’s identified <b>handicapping</b> <b>condition</b> was also found to affect total parent participation in the SBARC meeting. The child’s <b>handicapping</b> <b>condition</b> and the number of years the child had received special education were found to have an interactive effect on parent assertiveness and parent discussion of the child’s past educational history. Parents of mentally handicapped children classified for two years or less and parents of learning disabled children classified for more than two years were more assertive than parents of mentally handicapped children classified for more than two years and parents of learning disabled children classified for more than two years were more assertive than parents of mentally handicapped children classified form more than two years and parents of learning disabled children classified for two years or less. The findings specified above were discussed as well as 1) topics in which parents were observed to participate most; 2) the relationship between parent participation and the request of information by professionals, the length of the conference, and the number of people present at the SBARC meeting; 3) the correlation between knowledge and assertiveness; and 4) suggestions for further research...|$|E
40|$|The {{primary purpose}} of this study was to {{investigate}} attitudes of parents of school-aged and preschool aged children with and without handicaps, toward the issue of mainstreaming. A sample of 212 individuals responded to a parent questionnaire which was mailed to each household to be completed by both parents. This questionnaire examined attitudes and concerns of parents across 14 mainstreaming issues (Appendix 2). Of the total sample, 123 responses were used for the final analysis. Cases were discarded because some were missing the age of their child, some we::e not qualified because of their child 2 ̆ 7 s age, and others had not completed the survey. Regarding overall attitudes toward mainstreaming, there was a significant interaction between <b>handicapping</b> <b>condition</b> and sex of parent. Fathers of handicapped children disagreed more with the attitude questions than mother-s of handicapped childr-en. Also, the <b>handicapping</b> <b>condition</b> of the child affected parental attitudes about problems which a handicapped child might encounter in a mainstreaming situation. Parents of nonhandicapped children disagreed more with these issues than parents of handicapped children. Fathers of handicapped and nonhandicapped children agreed more than mothers that there might be problems encounter-ed by handicapped children in a mainstreaming situation. Mothers of nonhandicapped children and fathers of handicapped children disagreed more with these statements. The interaction between sex of parents and <b>handicapping</b> <b>condition</b> of the child was found to be significant for the dependent variables of overall mainstreaming attitudes and attitudes toward problems which a handicapped child might encounter in a mainstreaming situation. Another significant independent variable was <b>handicapping</b> <b>condition</b> of the child which was found to be significant on attitudes toward problems which a handicapped child might encounter in a mainstreaming situation and attitudes toward safety issues of both handicapped and nonhandicapped children in a mainstreaming situation. In other words, parents of handicapped children were more children were more concerned about school related problems and safety issues for handicapped children in a mainstLeaming situation. Age of the child was not found significant for- any of the dependent variables. In addition, the interaction of <b>handicapping</b> <b>condition</b> and age of the child was found to be significant for the dependent var-iable which dealt with attitudes toward safety of both handicapped and dealt with attitudes toward safety issues of both handicapped and nonhandicapped children.

40|$|The {{effects that}} each sibling 2 ̆ 7 s {{relative}} cognitive and physical abilities {{may have on}} the quality of sibling interaction are not clearly understood in either nonhandicapped or handicapped sibling dyads. A measure of sibling authority based on behavioral observations of sibling interaction was developed that represents how sibling abilities are translated into sibling power within handicapped and nonhandicapped sibling dyads. This measure of sibling authority was related to the occurrence of prosocial and aggressive behaviors in sibling dyads with and without a child with handicaps. Ninety-three sibling dyads participated. Included were 34 nonhandicapped sibling dyads, 12 sibling dyads in which the older sibling had a <b>handicapping</b> <b>condition,</b> and 47 sibling dyads in which the younger sibling had a <b>handicapping</b> <b>condition.</b> The handicapping conditions were Down Syndrome, mental retardation, or severe hearing impairment. Results indicate that although the older sibling had greater authority overall, younger siblings had greater authority in over half of all sibling dyads. Sibling authority was not found to be dependent specifically on the presence of the handicapping conditions represented in this study nor upon the gender composition of the sibling dyads. Small differences in authority scores between siblings were associated with a greater frequency of prosocial behavior in both siblings. However, {{there were no significant differences}} between groups or siblings on the occurrence of either prosocial or aggressive behaviors.

40|$|Includes bibliographical {{references}} (pages 41 - 42) This study compared long-term adapted {{physical education}} (APE) goals {{as perceived by}} 77 {{parents of children with}} disabilities and 123 APE specialists from Minnesota. The Goals of Adapted Physical Education Scale (GAPES) and specific demographic items were administered. The GAPES, a paired comparison ranking, included nine long-term APE goals. Test-retest reliability was determined by administering GAPES to a different sample of 52 APE teachers. Intraclass reliability coefficients ranging from. 46 to. 79 were found using a subjects by treatment ANOVA. Results indicated that GAPES has moderate reliability. A MANOVA was used to compare goal means of parents and APE specialists. A Hotellings T Square Multivariate Test of Significance (posthoc) yielded an F (1, 198) = 9. 91 indicating a significant difference (. 01 level) between the goal priorities of parents and specialists. This significant difference in the means between parents and specialists occurred on the leisure time skills, play and game skills, and creative expression goals. APE specialists prioritized leisure time skills (M = 4. 64) second in importance and play and game skills (M = 3. 48) seventh, while parents ranked leisure time skills (M = 2. 84) eighth and play and game skills (M = 2. 78) ninth. However, parents prioritized creative expression (M = 3. 03) seventh as compared to specialists (M = 1. 54) who ranked it ninth. Overall, positive self- concept was ranked as the most important goal by both groups. Further analysis of the data using MANOVA'S revealed no significant differences in the means of goals by parents based on their child's age level and <b>handicapping</b> <b>condition.</b> The results should be interpreted with caution due to the reliability of GAPES; the difficulty experienced by parents in completing GAPES; and small samples of students when categorized by age level and <b>handicapping</b> <b>condition.</b> M.
