Walter (John Noble) puts forth various theories, such as astral projection, while Peter (Joshua Jackson) thinks it was still just a dream. Olivia is unconvinced, and goes with the Fringe team to investigate. An NYPD officer (April Grace) escorts them to the crime scene, and Peter sees a red balloon {{floating}} and begins to believe her, as Olivia had described the balloon to him previously.|$|E
5|$|Some {{scenes of}} the episode {{contained}} backgrounds that were added with digital effects. One such scene was on Danny's ex-wife's house, which did not have mountains in the background; the mountains were digitally added in post-production. The same technique was used again on the village of quonset huts, and again on the freighter assault scenes, only with {{the background of the}} sea when Hesse and McGarrett fight. After the episode was filmed, the producers discovered that it was too long and spent two weeks deciding what to cut out. One of the scenes involved the team deciding on a name of their task force, but that scene was cut in favor of another episode. Manning's scenes were also cut due from the final broadcast to the length, though viewers could still make out the top of <b>her</b> <b>head</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> finished episode.|$|E

5|$|Waray guerrillas under {{a former}} schoolteacher named Captain Nieves Fernandez fought the Japanese in Tacloban. Nieves {{extensively}} trained her men in combat skills and making of improvised weaponry, {{as well as}} leading her men in the front. With only 110 men, Nieves managed to take out over 200 Japanese soldiers during the occupation. The Imperial Japanese Army posted a 10,000 Pesos reward on <b>her</b> <b>head</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> hopes of capturing her but to no avail. The main commander of the resistance movement in the Island of Leyte was Ruperto Kangleon, a former Filipino soldier turned resistance fighter and leader. After {{the fall of the}} country, he successfully escaped capture by the Japanese and established a united guerrilla front in Leyte. He and his men, the Black Army, were successful in pushing the Japanese from the mainland province and further into the coastlands of Southern Leyte. Kangleon's guerrillas provided intelligence for the American guerrilla leaders such as Wendell Fertig, and assisted in the subsequent Leyte Landing and the Battle of Leyte soon after. The guerrillas in Leyte were also very instrumental not only in the opposition against Japanese rule, but also in the safety and aid of the civilians living in the island. In the book The Hidden Battle of Leyte: The Picture Diary of a Girl taken by the Japanese Military by Remedios Felias; a former comfort woman, revealed how the Filipino guerrillas saved the lives of many young girls raped or to-be raped by the Japanese. In her vivid account of the Battle of Burauen, she recounts how the guerrillas managed to wipe out entire Japanese platoons off the various villages in the municipality, eventually saving the lives of many.|$|E

500|$|Inspired by the {{cinematography}} of Leaving Las Vegas, {{the music}} video for [...] "Everytime" [...] portrays Spears {{as a star}} hounded by paparazzi, who drowns in her bathtub when she starts bleeding from a wound in <b>her</b> <b>head.</b> <b>In</b> <b>the</b> hospital, doctors fail to resuscitate her while a child is born in the next room, implying she has been reincarnated. The original treatment would have had Spears killing herself from a drug overdose, but the plot was removed after it received criticism by organizations such as Kidscape, who perceived it as a glamorization of suicide. Critics noted the video for its religious references to The Passion of the Christ, Kabbalah and stigmata, and for predicting Spears's future struggles with fame.|$|E

So deep was her admiration, Lear speculates the scene of Miss Moppet wrapping <b>her</b> <b>head</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> duster comes from a similar scene in an Uncle Remus tale in which Br'er Fox [...] "feigns illness in a rocking chair, wrapped up with flannel". Potter was modeling her sketches from a young kitten and, wanting not to show cruelty, she wrote of the kitten: [...] "She should catch him by the tail / less unpleasant". Children's literature scholar Peter Hunt writes that Potter was careful to protect her young audience from graphic details and she refused to depict death in her stories.|$|E
500|$|... "Everytime" [...] was {{the third}} single {{released}} from the album, on May 17, 2004. It received positive appreciation from contemporary critics.

500|$|A formal inquest in February 1944 {{returned}} a verdict of [...] "Suicide, motive unknown". In his report, the coroner found that Tatlock had eaten a full meal shortly before her death. She had taken some barbiturates, {{but not a}} fatal dose. Traces of chloral hydrate were found, a drug normally associated with a [...] "Mickey Finn" [...] when combined with alcohol, {{but there was no}} alcohol in her blood, despite damage to her pancreas that indicated she was a heavy drinker. As a psychiatrist working in a hospital, she had access to sedatives such as chloral hydrate. The coroner found that she had died at around 4:30 pm on January 4. The cause of death was recorded as [...] "acute edema of the lungs with pulmonary congestion" [...] — drowning in the bathtub. It seems likely that she knelt over the bathtub, took chloral hydrate, and plunged <b>her</b> <b>head</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> water.|$|E

In Phoebe’s hospital room, Ross and Rachel enter with bad news: her doctor fell and hit <b>her</b> <b>head</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> shower, meaning she's unable {{to make it to}} the birth. The replacement doctor, Dr. Harad assures Phoebe that she's in good hands, until he spontaneously declares his admiration for Fonzie, from Happy Days several times. Phoebe demands that Ross goes and find her another doctor, but when the replacement is too young for her liking, Dr. Harad returns. She moreover begs Rachel to talk to her brother Frank, and convince him to let her keep one of the triplets, after having second thoughts over the surrogate process. In the delivery room, Phoebe gives birth to two girls and a boy. Rachel breaks the news to Phoebe that she won’t be able to keep one of the babies. She asks her friends to leave, in order to have a moment alone with the triplets.|$|E
500|$|The episode {{features}} numerous cultural references. The song [...] "Gonna Make You Sweat (Everybody Dance Now)" [...] by C+C Music Factory {{is played}} twice during the episode: first as the steel mill transforms into a disco, and second over the closing credits. Homer's record collection includes music by The New Christy Minstrels and The Wedding of Lynda Bird Johnson, the albums Loony Luau and Ballad of the Green Berets by Staff Sgt. Barry Sadler. The song that John picks {{out and he}} and Homer dance to is [...] "I Love the Nightlife" [...] by Alicia Bridges, and the song that Bart dances to is [...] "The Shoop Shoop Song (It's in His Kiss)" [...] by Betty Everett. When John is introduced, there is a plastic pink flamingo lying in the background, a reference to John Waters's film Pink Flamingos. Items in John's store include several buttons endorsing political campaigns of Richard Nixon, Dan Quayle, and Bob Dole {{as well as an}} issue of TV Guide owned by Jacqueline Kennedy Onassis which features the title characters from the sitcom Laverne & Shirley on the cover. When John takes the Simpson family on a driving tour of Springfield's shopping district, he points out a store where he claims that the Mexican film actress Lupe Vélez bought the toilet she drowned in. This is a reference to the urban legend that Velez was found dead with <b>her</b> <b>head</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> toilet the night of her suicide in 1944.|$|E
500|$|Doctor 'Doc' Doccerson (instead of Reubens in the PSP version), is infuriated {{that all}} of his inventions failed, but today he 'shall surpass them all' with his latest invention, C.R.U.S.H. He uses a tape {{recorder}} for his scientific narrative on the experiment. With {{the help of his}} best friend and protégé, Danny (a running gag consists of him correcting Doc throughout the game), he enters his mind as his subject to C.R.U.S.H., but after a few tests, Danny is trapped inside C.R.U.S.H., where he can collect his lost marbles (which will unlock new dressing gowns/robe designs) and facing his fears in the form of monsters (i.e. cockroaches, slugs). At one point, Doc tells Danny that C.R.U.S.H. will not let Danny out due to [...] "unresolved feelings." [...] The two question that reasoning as they progress. Towards the end, C.R.U.S.H. interrupts contact between Danny and Doc, overly infatuated with Danny. Danny slowly admits to C.R.U.S.H. that she is simply a machine and compares it to [...] "flirting with a parking meter." [...] C.R.U.S.H., infuriated, sends Danny back to his childhood as a result. When Doc comes back into contact with Danny, Danny lashes out at Doc for building a machine [...] "with the heart of a teenage girl" [...] who [...] "LOLd" [...] at him. Doc, calming Danny down, explains how this [...] "subconscious" [...] is not really his, but old data, and suddenly Danny becomes shocked when he realizes he took the place of someone who underwent treatment with C.R.U.S.H. (being the PSP Danny), but [...] "she knows [...] not the same." [...] C.R.U.S.H. really wanted Danny to clear <b>her</b> <b>head.</b> <b>In</b> <b>the</b> ending, Danny finally escapes and is free out of C.R.U.S.H's mind. He and Doc discuss C.R.U.S.H's future, while Doc says that he'll fix her. In a sudden plot twist, it turns out that they were not in the real world at all, but all the levels throughout the game are outside Doc's lab. C.R.U.S.H. smiles and laughs into the camera, she winks and the screen cuts to black.|$|E

2500|$|Queen Aliens are {{significantly}} larger {{and stronger than}} the normal adults, being approximately [...] tall. Their body structure differs also, having two pairs of arms, one large and one small. The queen's head is larger than those of other adult Aliens, and is protected by a large, flat crest, like a crown, which varies from queen to queen. Unlike other aliens, the queen's external mouth is separately segmented {{from the rest of}} her head, allowing her to turn her mouth left and right almost {{to the point where it}} is facing perpendicular to the direction of the rest of <b>her</b> <b>head.</b> <b>In</b> <b>the</b> second film, Aliens, unlike other adults and queens, the queen had high-heel protrusions from her feet.|$|E
2500|$|On December 1, 2015, the Olongapo Regional Trial Court found Pemberton {{guilty of}} {{homicide}} with two mitigating circumstances {{in the death}} of Laude and sentenced him to 6 to 12 years in jail.

The court ruled Pemberton that [...] "in the heat of passion, he arm-locked the deceased, and dunked his (<b>her)</b> <b>head</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> toilet." [...] Harry Roque, the family's attorney, disagreed, saying “It is not right that these mitigating circumstances showed his bigotry towards a transgender woman and that the bigotry itself was the reason he killed her."

2500|$|Gamers who previewed {{the system}} at the Shoshinkai show in 1994 complained that the Mario demo was not {{realistic}} enough, was not in full color, and didn't allow for [...] "tracking" [...] (the movement of the image when the player turns his or <b>her</b> <b>head).</b> <b>In</b> <b>the</b> lead editorial of Electronic Gaming Monthly following the show, Ed Semrad predicted that the Virtual Boy would have poor launch sales due to the monochrome screen, lack of true portability, unimpressive lineup of games seen at the Shoshinkai show, and the price, which he argued was as low as it could get given the hardware but still too expensive for the experience the system offered. Next Generations editors were also dubious of the Virtual Boy's prospects {{when they left the}} show, and concluded their article on the system by commenting, [...] "But who will buy it? It's not portable, it's awkward to use, it's 100% antisocial (unlike multiplayer SNES/Genesis games), it's too expensive and - most importantly - the 'VR' (i.e. 3D effect) doesn't add to the game at all: it's just a novelty." ...|$|E
2500|$|The idyllic life of Duncan and Tessa is {{shattered}} {{by the arrival of}} a message from one of Mac's teachers, the priest Darius, in [...] "Band Of Brothers" [...] Darius' most powerful enemy, Grayson, was coming to Seacouver, to eliminate a mortal peacemaker and disciple of Darius, Viktor Paulus. Grayson was a lieutenant of Darius when they led an army across Europe in the 5th century but turned against him when Darius killed the then-oldest living Immortal at the gates of Paris and became a man of peace. [...] Determined to protect Tessa and Richie but uncertain of his ability to handle Grayson, he sends them to Darius for protection, then sets out to face Grayson. Grayson, a fellow Scot, offers MacLeod a position at his right hand, but Duncan refuses. Grayson takes MacLeod to the limit before the younger Highlander prevails. MacLeod follows his friends to Paris, where he and Tessa decide to stay, living on Duncan's barge; Tessa takes up a post as a curator, Duncan takes up the role of a kept man and Richie that of a fish out of water, in his role as a kept man, Duncan does the shopping, but as he is returning to the barge one morning, he sees a clown dressed as a mime kill an elderly man ("For Evil's Sake"). Helping the police, he tells them that he can identify the man. The police inspector, LeBrun, is convinced he has seen Duncan before. Later, mysterious men with guns stake out the barge and, when Duncan fells one, he finds that he is a policeman. LeBrun has remembered Duncan - {{when he was a young}} gendarme, they were chasing the assassin Kuyler and he saw Duncan then. LeBrun's assistant is in Kuyler's pay, but Duncan silences the mime forever and LeBrun arrests his assistant. Duncan hasn't finished with LeBrun, for when his old enemy Xavier St Cloud crosses his path again, Duncan throws one of Xavier's gas grenades into a cement mixer and LeBrun fishes it out ("For Tomorrow We Die"). Convinced MacLeod is the gas poisoner, LeBrun tries to run him in whilst Duncan has to stop Xavier from gassing an exhibition Tessa is organising. Frustrated, Xavier comes for Duncan, but Duncan cuts off Xavier's hand and he disappears into the Seine. The series also introduced two old Immortal lovers of Duncan’s to test Tessa's restraint. Grace Chandel, on the run both from the police, who want to arrest her for killing her husband, and the Immortal ex-lover who was the real killer, the possessive Carlo Sendaro ("Saving Grace") was welcomed by Tessa, when Duncan and Darius help her escape, Duncan making sure that Carlo will not trouble her again. The same was not true of Amanda, described by Duncan as [...] "a bad habit". In [...] "The Lady & The Tiger" [...] we met the unprincipled cat-burglar with a passion for circuses, robbery, and 400-year-old Scotsmen, here trying to set up MacLeod so that the Immortal thief she had double crossed, Zachary Blaine, would not take <b>her</b> <b>head.</b> <b>In</b> <b>the</b> end, she takes Zachary's, but not before Duncan has done all the hard work.
