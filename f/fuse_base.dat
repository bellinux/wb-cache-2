2500|$|The Wylex {{standard}} {{consumer unit}} was {{very popular in}} the United Kingdom until the wiring regulations started demanding residual-current devices (RCDs) for sockets that could feasibly supply equipment outside the equipotential zone. The design {{does not allow for}} fitting of RCDs or RCBOs. [...] Some Wylex standard models were made with an RCD instead of the main switch, but (for consumer units supplying the entire installation) this is no longer compliant with the wiring regulations as alarm systems should not be RCD-protected. [...] There are two styles of <b>fuse</b> <b>base</b> that can be screwed into these units: one designed for rewirable fusewire carriers and one designed for cartridge fuse carriers. Over the years MCBs have been made for both styles of base. In both cases, higher rated carriers had wider pins, so a carrier couldn't be changed for a higher rated one without also changing the base. [...] Cartridge fuse carriers are also now available for DIN-rail enclosures.|$|E

Below are brief descriptions of these submissions. • A Eurecom fuse base: this run fuses different visual features, including Bag-of-Visual-Words (BoW), Color Moment (CM), Wavelet Texture (WT), Edge Histogram (EH) and Local Binary Pattern (LBP). • A Eurecom rerank 1 : this run reranks {{the results of the}} previous run Eurecom <b>fuse</b> <b>base</b> based on the prior probability of the concept in shots and videos. • A Eurecom rerank 2 : this run updates the concept score of the run Eurecom <b>fuse</b> <b>base</b> based on context knowledge. • A Eurecom specific: this run updates the concept score of the run Eurecom rerank 2 with the output of several specific detectors for face, person and bicycle respectively. • A Eurecom visual audio: this run fuses the run Eurecom specific with two audio features, i. e. MFCC and Audio Spectral. With these runs, first we try to evaluate the performance of different visual and audio descriptors for high-level feature extraction; second, we investigate the use of context and video knowledge in reranking the detection results. The evaluation results show that the reranking schemes significantly improve the performance of the concept detectors, especially for those context-dependent concepts. Figure 1 illustrates the framework of our system and how the five runs are generated. In the following sections, we describe the details of descriptor extraction, and the approaches for classification and reranking. We also participated in the joint IRIM submission. Our contribution is covered in the IRIM notebook paper. BoW C...|$|E
40|$|Low-voltage (LV) fuse systems, which open {{a circuit}} by cutting the current when it exceeds a given value for an {{adequate}} period, {{are used in}} nonresidential, commercial, and industrial buildings. LV-fuse systems consist of a <b>fuse</b> <b>base,</b> fuse link, and a detachable operating handle. The fuse link is made of a ceramic alloy. In this study, a full-factorial experimental design with two levels was used to solve the fracture problem of fuse links. In this scope, performance criteria (compressive strength), factors affecting the performance criteria (moisture ratio, shaping duration, drying duration, and firing duration) and factor levels were determined in the initial stage. Main effects and interactions among factors were investigated, and factor-level combinations that maximize the compressive strength were determined according to results of analysis. Finally, the relationship between compressive strength and experimental factors was presented {{in the form of}} f = y(x) for prediction purposes...|$|E

25|$|Many radical {{views of}} transsaccadic memory exist. Some are favoured {{more than others}} because of the {{evidence}} that supports them. One less-accepted theory, Breitmeyer's spatiotopic fusion hypothesis, suggested that successive images are <b>fused</b> <b>based</b> on environmental coordinates and not retinal ones. In other words, our memory stores a sequence of images from our surroundings, and joins the images together to give us a full representation in our brain. The orientation of our retinas do not have an influence on this form of memory. This theoretical form of memory supposedly stores highly detailed representations of the world in a high capacity spatial buffer. Research and experiments by other psychologists provide empirical evidence against these claims.|$|R

40|$|We {{present a}} novel form of intra-volume {{directory}} layering with hierarchical, inheritance-like namespace unification. While each layer of an OLFS volume constitutes a subvolume {{that can be}} mounted separately in a fan-in configuration, the entire hierarchy is always accessible (online) and fully navigable through any mounted layer. OLFS uses a relational database to store its layering metadata and either a relational database or any (virtual) host file system as its backing store, along with metadata and block caching for improved performance. Because OLFS runs as a virtual file system in user-space, its capabilities are available to all existing software without modification or special privileges. We have developed a reference implementation of OLFS for <b>FUSE</b> <b>based</b> on MySQL and XFS, and conducted performance benchmarking against XFS by itself.

With the captured Standard Dynamic Range (SDR) images under different exposure settings, first the fine details are extracted based on guided filter. Next, the base layers (i. e., images obtained from NTF) across all input images are fused using multiresolution pyramid. Exposure, contrast, and saturation measures are considered to generate a mask that guides the fusion process of the base layers. Finally, the <b>fused</b> <b>base</b> layer is combined with the extracted fine details to obtain detail-enhanced fused image. The goal is to preserve details in both very dark and extremely bright regions without High Dynamic Range Image (HDRI) representation and tone mapping step.
