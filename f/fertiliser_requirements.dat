40|$|The Wet Tropics sugar {{industry}} experiences {{one of the}} highest levels of inter-annual climate variability in the world. This has a significant impact on cane yields and nitrogen losses and makes the task of applying the right amount of nitrogen fertiliser to optimise profitability and minimise environmental losses extremely challenging.

40|$|From the Introduction. The {{fertilisation}} of pineapples in the Eastern Cape Province {{is still}} a relatively new practice which started approximately twelve years ago. Even after this time many growers still insist that pineapples can be grown without fertilisation on virgin soils. As the available virgin soil decreased, however, so the interest in fertiliser application increased. Very little basic research on the <b>fertiliser</b> <b>requirements</b> of pineapples in the Eastern Cape was done {{to serve as a}} guide to growers. The available advisory literature by le Roux (1951), Malan (1954) and Lewcock (1956) were based on overseas experience. When pineapple research was started on a large scale, in 1955, it was realised that emphasis should be placed on the nutritional requirements on virgin as well as replanted soils. From initial experiments {{it was clear that the}} main response in plant growth and yield was obtained from nitrogenous fertilisers...|$|E
40|$|The {{results from}} seven North and South Sumatra oil palm field {{fertiliser}} trials, which were recorded from 1994 - 2009, {{were used to}} study nutrient uptake and efficiencies. The different trial sites allowed effects of different soil properties and climate (rainfall) on dry matter production and yield to be investigated. Additional information was also assessed from two nursery trials to support the field trial results. The {{results showed that the}} nutrient recovery efficiency (RE), which is defined as palm nutrient uptake per unit of given nutrient is subject to variation in site properties. However, the field and nursery trial results demonstrated that the physiological efficiency (PE), or yield increment per unit of nutrient uptake of oil palm, at a particular age and planting material, remains relatively constant over a range of environments. The increased yield per unit of given fertiliser known as agronomic efficiency (AE) is therefore solely dependent upon the RE for a specific planting material. However, a nursery fertiliser showed variation for dry matter production for the same unit of nutrient uptake. Assuming the current daily field management practices have been developed to meet optimal RE and yield then agronomists are able to assess PE of different oil palm planting materials to screen the most suitable for different environments. From a practical point of view agronomists can predict potential yield based on dry matter production which can be helpful in determining the oil palm <b>fertiliser</b> <b>requirement.</b> PE results {{can also be used to}} identify and evaluate problem fields in oil palm plantations. ...|$|R
40|$|Declining soil {{organic matter}} levels because of {{cropping}} {{have been shown to}} reduce crop growth and yield, but the effects of changing infiltration and soil hydraulic properties on crop productivity have not been widely evaluated. Cropping systems in south-eastern Queensland have, in the past, involved intense tillage, trafficking with heavy machinery, and changed organic matter cycling, affecting soil aggregation, permeability, water-holding characteristics, and organic matter. The aim {{of this paper is to}} determine how important infiltration and soil hydraulic condition has been to the water balance, crop growth, and yield in the past, and may be in the future if management is not changed. Change in physical and chemical condition of the 5 most commonly cropped soils in south-east Queensland (Sodosols, Vertosols with ≤ 55 % clay, Vertosols with > 55 % clay, Red Ferrosols and Red Chromosols/Kandosols) was measured over 0 - 70 years of cropping and estimated up to 200 years. The APSIM model was used to predict effects of changing soil condition in a rain-fed, fertilised, wheat-summer fallow cropping system with intense tillage. Decline in infiltration, restricted internal redistribution of water, and increased evaporation reduced water supply to the crop, causing simulated yield to decline by 29, 38, 25, 17, and 13 % for the 5 soils, respectively, after 50 years of cropping. Gross margin declined at a faster rate, falling by 36, 50, 40, 20, and 21 %, respectively after 50 years because of increasing <b>fertiliser</b> <b>requirement</b> to compensate for declining soil fertility. Crop productivity on most soils continued to steadily decline as period of cropping increased to 200 years. To arrest or reverse this downward trend, it is likely that substantial changes to current cropping systems will be needed, including reducing tillage and trafficking, and improving organic matter levels...|$|R
40|$|The {{incidence}} of potassium (K) deficiency is increasing in crops, pastures, and forestry in south-western Australia. Although soil K {{can be measured}} using soil sampling and analysis, γ-ray spectrometry offers a potentially cheaper and spatially more precise alternative. This could be particularly useful in precision agriculture, where inputs are applied according to need rather than by general prescription. In a study of topsoils near Jerramungup, Western Australia, strong relationships (r 2 = 0 · 9) were found between on-ground counts of γ-rays derived from 40 K (γ-K) and both total K and plant-available K. The success of γ-ray spectrometry in predicting available K relied on a strong relationship (r 2 = 0 · 9) between total K and available K which may not hold in all areas. Although the relationship between γ-K and available K held over the range of 36 – 1012 mg/kg, crop response to K fertilisers is only expected when the available K content is < 100 mg/kg. Estimates of available K from γ-K were unreliable at this {{lower end of the}} regression curve. Separate analysis with a subset of the data with available K < 100 mg/kg showed a poor relationship between γ-K and available K (r 2 = 0 · 05; d. f. 11). The usefulness of γ-ray spectrometry may therefore be restricted to defining areas where response to fertiliser K may occur, and where further soil sampling and analysis are required to predict the <b>fertiliser</b> <b>requirement.</b> Strong relationships (r 2 = 0 · 9) were also found between γ-K and a range of other soil attributes, including clay, silt, and organic carbon content. These relationships depended on the locally strong relationship between total K and these soil attributes. Since such relationships do not hold everywhere, the utility of γ-ray spectrometry will likewise be limited. Site-specific calibrations are required if γ-ray spectrometry is to be used for soil property mapping...|$|R

Owing to the limitations imposed by the information available, only provisional conclusions could be drawn. However, intensification in management through shorter rotations, closer utilisation, slash burning and windrowing must greatly increase nutrient removal particularly when two or more of these practices are used in conjunction. Other features of intensive management, such as thinning, clearfelling per se, and bedding in site preparation, have much smaller effects. Referring to nitrogen specifically, sufficient reserves and inputs are generally available for the next crop at present but, with intensified manage-ment, productivity will only be maintained through substantial fertilisation...|$|E

Fossil fuels {{need to be replaced}} with sustainable energy sources to decrease emissions of greenhouse gases. Production of bioenergy from herbaceous crops on agricultural land is one alternative. In Sweden, reed canary grass (Phalaris arundinacea L.) is considered an interesting species for this purpose, as it is perennial and well-adapted to the northern climate. This thesis evaluated different approaches to reduce the mineral <b>fertiliser</b> <b>requirement</b> in reed canary grass (RCG) production for bioenergy purposes in a spring harvesting system. Fertilisation effects and the risk of heavy metal enrichment were studied in a field experiment involving annual applications of ash for seven years. Three different treatments were applied: ash from co-combustion of RCG and municipal waste (mixed ash), pure RCG ash and, as a control, PK fertilisers. There {{were no significant differences between}} treatments in terms of RCG dry matter yield or biomass concentrations of heavy metals. Samples from the uppermost soil layer (0 - 5 cm) differed between treatments in terms of cadmium, chromium, copper, lead and zinc concentration, with higher concentrations in the mixed ash treatment compared with the control. The effects of intercropping RCG with different nitrogen (N) -fixing perennial legumes were examined in three field experiments, in combination with various fertilisation treatments. Two levels of N fertilisation combined with RCG ash or sewage sludge were applied in a delayed harvest system, which involved cutting the biomass in late autumn, leaving it on the field during winter and harvesting in spring. The estimated N fixation rate in red clover and alsike clover was high enough to compensate for lower N fertilisation. However, in most cases growth of the RCG in monoculture was not N-limited at half the recommended N fertilisation rate and intercropping with legumes was not beneficial. In order to determine the P and K requirements of RCG in a delayed harvest system, different levels of phosphorus (P) and potassium (K), supplied by mineral fertilisers or RCG ash are being compared in an ongoing study. No differences in biomass yield between treatments have been found after two harvest years. ...|$|R
40|$|Soil testing {{remains a}} most {{valuable}} tool {{for assessing the}} <b>fertiliser</b> <b>requirement</b> of crops. The relationship between soil tests (generally taken from surface soil) and relative yield (RY) response to fertiliser {{is subject to the}} influence of environment (e. g. water, temperature) and management (e. g. cultivation, sowing date). As such, the degree of precision is often low when the soil test calibration is based {{on a wide range of}} independent experiments on many soil types over many years by many different operators. Hence, the 90 % RY target used in soil test interpretation is best described by a critical range (critical concentration and confidence interval) for a given soil test rather than a single critical value. The present Better Fertiliser Decisions for Crops (BFDC) National Database, and the BFDC Interrogator that interacts with the database, provide a great advance over traditional formats and experiment-specific critical values because it allows the use of filters to refine the critical range for specific agronomic conditions. However, as searches become more specific (region, soil type) the quantity of data available to estimate a critical range becomes more vulnerable to data paucity, to outliers, and to clusters of localised experiments. Hence, appropriate training of the users of this database will ensure that the strengths and limitations of the BFDC National Database and BFDC Interrogator are properly understood. Additionally, the lack of standardised metadata for sites within the database makes it generally impossible to isolate the effects on critical values of the specific management or environmental factors listed earlier, which are therefore best determined by specific studies. Finally, the database is dominated (60 %) by responses of wheat to nitrogen and phosphorus, meaning that relatively few studies are available for responses by pulses (other than narrow leaf lupins) or oilseeds (other than canola), especially for potassium and sulfur. Moreover, limited data are available for current cropping systems and varieties. However, the identification of these gaps can now be used to focus future research on the crops, nutrients, soils, regions, and management practices where data are lacking. The value of metadata and the need for standardised protocols for nutrition experiments were key lessons...|$|R

The objective of this thesis was to develop guidelines on how to prevent grain yield losses due to competition from the perennial crops or to increase the yield of the main crops. The effects of species and time of undersowing of perennial crops in spring cereals, and the management of an intercropping system in which winter oilseed rape or consecutive crops of winter wheat were established in a remaining crop of white clover, were studied. The biomass of undersown cover crops {{by the time of}} the harvest of spring barley was significantly reduced with each delay in the undersowing, but the increase in biomass during autumn was generally not affected. Italian ryegrass (Lolium multiflorum Lam) and perennial ryegrass (Lolium perenne L.) reduced the grain yield by 6 and 1 %, respectively, but may both be suitable as cover crops with the appropriate main crop, time of undersowing and seed rate. Undersown white clover (Trifolium repens L.) /perennial ryegrass mixtures kept soil mineral N as low as pure ryegrass and improved the residual effect. This suggests that clover in the cover crops may reduce the N <b>fertiliser</b> <b>requirements</b> of the succeeding crop without increased N leaching. Grain yields were smaller in the wheat/clover system than with wheat alone when the wheat was direct drilled and larger when sown after stubble cultivation. Direct drilled wheat and rape yielded more with clover varieties less adapted to the cold climate than with varieties in common use in the area. Grain yield increased, weeds were efficiently controlled and the white clover crop maintained by applying herbicides that mainly act as germination inhibitors when a third consecutive wheat crop had 1 – 2 leaves. It was possible to conclude that (1) the tillage performed in conjunction with the sowing of wheat, (2) the weed control practice, and (3) the choice of clover variety, have large effects on the yield of the winter annuals in the intercropping system...|$|E

The results show that greater output per acre is consistently a paying proposition with our present-day knowledge of farming technology.

In the wheat and maize seasons, 15 N-labelled fertiliser was applied as conventional urea (CONV) and urea coated with a nitrification inhibitor (DMPP). In sorghum, the fate of 15 N-labelled urea was monitored in this crop following a legume ley pasture (L 70) or a grass ley pasture (G 100). The fertiliser N applied to sorghum in the legume-cereal rotation was reduced (70 kg N ha− 1) compared to the grass-cereal (100 kg N ha− 1) to assess {{the availability of the}} N residual from the legume ley pasture. Average crop N recoveries were 73 % (CONV) and 77 % (DMPP) in wheat and 50 % (CONV) and 51 % (DMPP) in maize, while in sorghum were 71 % (L 70) and 53 % (G 100). Data gathered in this study indicate that the intrinsic physical and chemical conditions of Oxisols can be extremely effective in limiting N losses via deep leaching or denitrification. Elevated crop 15 N recoveries can be therefore obtained in subtropical Oxisols using conventional urea while in these agroecosystems DMPP urea has no significant scope to increase fertiliser N recovery in the crop. Overall, introducing a legume phase to limit the <b>fertiliser</b> N <b>requirements</b> of the following cereal crop proved to be the most effective strategy to reduce N losses and increase fertiliser N recovery...|$|R

We {{assessed the}} spatial variability of optimal <b>fertiliser</b> <b>requirements</b> of cassava for enhanced nutrient use efficiency and increased yield using the balanced nutrition {{approach of the}} QUEFTS model. Two datasets comprised of five fertiliser experiments conducted at eight locations across Southern Togo, Southern Ghana and Northern Ghana from 2007 to 2012 were used. The ratio of storage roots dry matter yield over the sum of available N, P and K expressed in crop nutrient equivalent from the soil and nutrient inputs {{was used as a}} proxy to estimate nutrient use efficiency. Nutrient use efficiencies of 20. 5 and 31. 7 kg storage roots dry matter per kilo crop nutrient equivalent were achieved at balanced nutrition at harvest index (HI) values of 0. 50 and 0. 65, respectively. N, P and K supplies of 16. 2, 2. 7 and 11. 5 kg at an HI of 0. 50, and 10. 5, 1. 9 and 8. 4 kg at an HI of 0. 65 were required to produce 1000 kg of storage roots dry matter. The corresponding optimal NPK supply ratios are 6. 0 - 1. 0 - 4. 2 and 5. 3 - 1. 0 - 4. 2. Nutrient use efficiencies decreased above yields of 77 - 93 % of the maximum. Evaluation of the performance of blanket fertiliser rates recommended by national research services for cassava production resulted in average benefit:cost ratios of 2. 4 ± 0. 9, which will be unattractive to many farmers compared to 3. 8 ± 1. 1 for the balanced fertiliser rates. The indigenous soil supply of nutrients revealed that, at balanced nutrition, K was the most limiting nutrient to achieve storage roots yields up to 8 Mg dry matter ha - 1 at most sites, whereas N and P were needed at greater yields. Dry weight of storage roots measured on the control plots in our researcher managed experiment ranged from 5. 6 to 12. 2 Mgha - 1, and were larger than the average weight in farmers' fields in West Africa of 4 Mgha - 1.

40|$|The {{availability}} {{and quality of}} irrigation water has become an issue limiting productivity in many Australian vegetable regions. Production is also under competitive pressure from supply chain forces. Producers look to new technologies, including changing irrigation infrastructure, exploring new water sources, and more complex irrigation management, to survive these stresses. Often there is little objective information investigating which improvements could improve outcomes for vegetable producers, and external communities (e. g. meeting NRM targets). This has led to investment in inappropriate technologies, and costly repetition of errors, as business independently discover the worth of technologies by personal experience. In our project, we investigated technology improvements for vegetable irrigation. Through engagement with industry and other researchers, we identified technologies most applicable to growers, particularly those that addressed priority issues. We developed analytical tools for ‘what if’ scenario testing of technologies. We conducted nine detailed experiments in the Lockyer Valley and Riverina vegetable growing districts, as well as case studies on grower properties in southern Queensland. We investigated root zone monitoring tools (FullStop™ wetting front detectors and Soil Solution Extraction Tubes - SSET), drip system layout, fertigation equipment, and altering planting arrangements. Our project team developed and validated models for broccoli, sweet corn, green beans and lettuce, and spreadsheets for evaluating economic risks associated with new technologies. We presented project outcomes at over 100 extension events, including irrigation showcases, conferences, field days, farm walks and workshops. The FullStops™ were excellent for monitoring root zone conditions (EC, nitrate levels), and managing irrigation with poor quality water. They were easier to interpret than the SSET. The SSET were simpler to install, but required wet soil to be reliable. SSET were an option for monitoring deeper soil zones, unsuitable for FullStop™ installations. Because these root zone tools require expertise, and are labour intensive, we recommend they be used to address specific problems, or as a periodic auditing strategy, not for routine monitoring. In our research, we routinely found high residual N in horticultural soils, with subsequently little crop yield response to additional nitrogen fertiliser. With improved irrigation efficiency (and less leaching), it may be timely to re-examine nitrogen budgets and recommendations for vegetable crops. Where the drip irrigation tube was located close to the crop row (i. e. within 5 - 8 cm), management of irrigation was easier. It improved nitrogen uptake, water use efficiency, and reduced the risk of poor crop performance through moisture stress, particularly in the early crop establishment phases. Close proximity of the drip tube to the crop row gives the producer more options for managing salty water, and more flexibility in taking risks with forecast rain. In many vegetable crops, proximate drip systems may not be cost-effective. The next best alternative is to push crop rows closer to the drip tube (leading to an asymmetric row structure). The vegetable crop models are good at predicting crop phenology (development stages, time to harvest), input use (water, fertiliser), environmental impacts (nutrient, salt movement) and total yields. The two immediate applications for the models are understanding/predicting/manipulating harvest dates and nitrogen movements in vegetable cropping systems. From the economic tools, the major influences on accumulated profit are price and yield. In doing ‘what if’ analyses, {{it is very important}} to be as accurate as possible in ascertaining what the assumed yield and price ranges are. In most vegetable production systems, lowering the required inputs (e. g. irrigation <b>requirement,</b> <b>fertiliser</b> <b>requirement)</b> is unlikely to have a major influence on accumulated profit. However, if a resource is constraining (e. g. available irrigation water), it is usually most profitable to maximise return per unit of that resource...|$|R
40|$|A {{range of}} {{cultivar}} types, including two-row and six-row types {{as well as}} line and hybrid types, are used for winter barley production in Ireland. There is little information available on the <b>fertiliser</b> nitrogen (N) <b>requirements</b> or the N use efficiency of these different types, particularly under Irish conditions. The objectives of the work presented here were to compare the response to fertiliser N of a two-row line cultivar, a six-row line cultivar and a six-row hybrid cultivar in terms of grain yield and aspects of N use efficiency. Experiments were carried out over three growing seasons, in the period 2012 - 2014, on a light-textured soil comparing {{the response of the}} three cultivars of winter barley to fertiliser N application rates ranging from 0 to 260 kg N/ha. There was no evidence that cultivar type, regardless of whether it was a two-row or six-row line cultivar or a six-row hybrid cultivar, influenced the response to fertiliser N of winter barley. There were some indications that six-row cultivars were less efficient at recovering soil N but used accumulated N more efficiently than the two-row cultivar. This work provided no evidence to support adjustment of fertiliser N inputs to winter barley based on cultivar typ...|$|R
40|$|Understanding the P {{sorption}} {{and release}} characteristics of different soils {{can help in}} determining <b>fertiliser</b> P <b>requirements</b> {{for the growth of}} rice (Oryza sativa L.). Glasshouse and laboratory experiments were undertaken to observe the long-term release characteristics of P from added fertiliser for the early growth of rice, and also to determine P sorption-desorption behaviour of three contrasting lowland soils from Cambodia: Prateah Lang (Plinthustalf), Koktrap (Plinthaquult) and Toul Samroung (Endoaqualf). In the pot experiment, rice was treated with four P rates (0, 5, 10 and 20 mg/kg soil) and grown over five successive cropping cycles, each of six to eight weeks. Phosphorus sorption desorption isotherms were constructed by equilibrating with 0, 10, 20 and 40 mg P/ 1 in 0. 01 M CaCl 2 solution at 25 oC. On the sandy Prateah Lang (PL) and clayey Toul Samroung (TS) soils, addition of 10 mg P/kg soil was adequate in the first crop for maximum tiller number, plant height, total dry matter, P concentration, and total P uptake. By contrast, about 20 mg P/kg was needed for the maximum growth and total P uptake on the clayey acid Koktrap (KT) soil. After two crops, plant growth progressively declined at all P levels, but the decrease in yields and total P uptake on the clayey TS and KT soils was slower than for plants grown on the sandy PL soil. Resin-P extractable was the smallest P fraction compared to other major soil-P (NaOH-Pi, NaOH-Po and Residual-P) pools in all soil groups, but recovery from the Resin-P pool was higher in the sandy PL soil than in the clayey TS and KT soils. The declining amounts recovered from all the extractable soil P fractions, especially major soil P (NaOH-Pi and Po and Residual-P) pools with succeeding rice crops grown on all the soils could be attributed to continued reactions of the added P fertiliser by soils in addition to plant P uptake during each plant-growing cycle. The clayey KT and TS soils sorbed five-fold more P than the sandy PL soil in oxidized conditions. Phosphorus desorption was initially greatest from the sandy PL soil: but with increasing numbers of soil extractions, the release of sorbed P declined faster than in the clayey KT and TS soils. The cumulative desorbed P was greater from the clayey KT and TS soil than from the sandy PL soil. The greater P sorbed by the clayey soils should ensure a longer duration of the residual P effect...|$|R
40|$|In Côte d'Ivoire, soils in cacao {{plantations}} are depleted due to {{the absence}} or underuse of fertilisation. A digital map of 130 landunits was created from soil and climatic parameters. A soil diagnosis software was combined with GIS (geographical information system) to convert the current unique fertiliser “Engrais cacao” into {{a greater number of}} recommendations more adapted to local conditions, thus more actual. Cacao <b>fertiliser</b> <b>requirements</b> were calculated from soil samples taken in mature cacao plantations in each landunit. The relationships between nutrient requirements and soil chemical parameters enabled building a map of the actual cacao fertiliser recommendations. Soils with identical characteristics were compared regarding their cacao nutritional needs. Highly significant correlations between soil nutrients were found; particularly, Ca and Mg were highly correlated with K, making it possible to calculate the Ca and Mg amounts in fertiliser formulae as function of K (i. e. Ca = 8. 5 ×K and Mg = 3 ×K). The final map contains 23 N-P-K-Ca-Mg fertiliser formulae. Among them, the currently recommended blanket fertiliser represents 16. 5 % of the cacao areas. The comparison of our results with a previous study, done 40 years ago, evidenced that the soil nutrients under cacao have significantly decreased over the period, reinforcing the need for fertilizers.

40|$|Vegetable {{cultivation}} under shelters {{is gaining}} {{popularity in the}} humid tropics as a sure way to achieve good quality produce. Shelters prevent damage to crops from extreme climatic conditions, such as heavy rains, storm and strong sunlight. This guide brings together valuable information on shelter cultivation, based on research on Martinique, supplemented with data from other Caribbean Islands and Africa. It is a practical and comprehensive manual, covering both sheltered cultivation on soil and sheltered soil-less cultivation on substrates (hydroponic). It describes different types and traits of shelters rather briefly, but offers more on cultivation aspects, such as crop water and <b>fertiliser</b> <b>requirements,</b> pest control, sowing techniques and ventilation. Individual fact sheets are included on nine common vegetables under sheltered cultivation: courgette, cucumber, French bean, lettuce, melon, onions, pepper, strawberry and tomato.

40|$|The {{behaviour}} of Merino wether hoggets grazing {{an existing}} management experiment at Tara Hills High Country Research Station was studied during summer 1981 / 1982. The experiment compared three stocking rates and three management systems (continuous, two paddock intermittent grazing, six paddock rotational). The daytime distribution and {{activity of the}} hoggets, dung distribution, and Olsen-P levels of topsoils were recorded on ten altitudinal strata {{within each of the}} nine treatment areas. Dung frequency was more closely correlated to grazing distribution than to either resting or total animal distribution. This is contrary to the generally accepted belief that dung accumulation is associated with resting behaviour. Increasing stocking rate led to a more even grazing and dung distribution. Subdivision by itself did not improve the evenness of distribution although it may have enhanced the stocking rate influence. There was little correlation between dung frequency and soil Olsen- P levels, especially outside the night camp areas. This indicates the importance of factors such as plant uptake and herbage consumption in the phosphate nutrient cycle. Olsen-P levels were consistently higher in the high stocking rate paddocks relative to the low stocking rate. Levels in the medium stocking rate fluctuated between these two. The implications of these findings in regard to the effects of intensification of farming in the high country on nutrient cycling and <b>fertiliser</b> <b>requirements</b> are discussed...|$|E
40|$|Information on soil texture, soil {{organic matter}} content (SOM), {{nutrient}} status and pH is fundamental for efficient crop production and for minimising negative effects on the environment. Farmers obtain this information, on which decisions on <b>fertiliser</b> and lime <b>requirements</b> are based, through farm soil mapping. Although {{there is a general}} awareness that within-field and within-farm variations might not be adequately captured using conventional sample point density, simply increasing the number of sample pointes would increase the cost to unacceptable levels. In this thesis, near infrared reflection (NIR) spectroscopy was used to obtain more accurate information on within-field or within-farm variations in a number of soil properties. One central objective was to estimate the within-field variation in N mineralisation, to allow for improved N fertilisation strategies. Another was the development of economically feasible strategies for increasing sample point density in conventional farm soil mapping for improved decision support in precision agriculture. The results presented here show that NIR spectroscopy can be used to estimate N mineralisation (measured as plant N uptake) in fields with large variations in SOM, and that the additional predictive capacity of NIR compared with SOM is related to variations in soil texture. The results also demonstrate {{that it is possible to}} make small farm-scale calibrations with a very limited number of calibration samples for clay and SOM content, producing information at a considerably higher density than conventional farm soil mapping. Within-field calibrations for pH and easily available P, K and Mg-AL also proved possible, but more calibration samples were needed. Predictions for silt failed regardless of the number of calibration samples...|$|R
40|$|AbstractGrain legume {{production}} offers multiple {{environmental benefits}} and can enhance sustainability of European farming, but their production area is declining constantly. Grain legume competitiveness is frequently constrained by lower gross margins compared to agronomically suitable cropping alternatives, {{but it can}} be improved by appreciating their ability to increase yield of subsequent crop(s) and, potentially, to reduce input <b>requirements</b> (<b>fertiliser,</b> biocide, tillage). Information on the magnitude of grain legume pre-crop effects is diverse and has not been synthesised for European agriculture. This paper reviews research on pre-crop benefits to yield and input requirements of subsequent crops, and the farm-economic profitability of grain legumes in European cropping systems. This includes an analysis of the magnitude of pre-crop benefits to cereal yields measured in 29 experiments in Europe; and 19 studies on grain legume gross margins ranging from crop to cropping system level are assessed. In the available studies, yield benefits of legumes to subsequent crops are highest under low nitrogen fertilisation to subsequent crops and fertilisation can be reduced by 60 kgNha− 1 on average under maintenance of acceptable yields. With the aim at maximising yield potential, nitrogen fertilisation following grain legumes can be reduced by 23 – 31 kgha− 1, and cereal yields are mostly 0. 5 – 1. 6 Mgha− 1 higher than after cereal pre-crops. With adequate estimates of pre-crop benefits, gross margins of full crop rotations can better assess grain legume competitiveness. In the studies reviewed, 35 of 53 modelled crop rotations with grain legumes were competitive with comparable non-legume rotations. Grain legume rotations were more competitive under conservation tillage systems if gross margin calculations accounted for cost savings arising from adjusted machinery requirements. In conclusion, grain legume pre-crop value is a crucial component of their farm-economic profitability in European cropping systems, but further experimental research is required to ascertain its magnitude. Expanding profitability measures to consider pre-crop effects substantially increases the number of situations where grain legumes can compete with cereals, and has a small positive effect on their competitiveness with alternative break crops. Besides a better consideration of the pre-crop value, further genetic and agronomic improvement in legume cropping, supportive market development, and policy support are required if Europe is to utilise environmental benefits of legumes and increase the sustainability of its farming...|$|R
40|$|Dairy farms {{located in}} the {{subtropical}} cereal belt of Australia rely on winter and summer cereal crops, rather than pastures, for their forage base. Crops are mostly established in tilled seedbeds and the system is vulnerable to fertility decline and water erosion, particularly over summer fallows. Field studies were conducted over 5 years on contrasting soil types, a Vertosol and Sodosol, in the 650 -mm annual-rainfall zone to evaluate {{the benefits of a}} modified cropping program on forage productivity and the soil-resource base. Growing forage sorghum as a double-crop with oats increased total mean annual production over that of winter sole-crop systems by 40 % and 100 % on the Vertosol and Sodosol sites respectively. However, mean annual winter crop yield was halved and overall forage quality was lower. Ninety per cent of the variation in winter crop yield was attributable to fallow and in-crop rainfall. Replacing forage sorghum with the annual legume lablab reduced <b>fertiliser</b> nitrogen (N) <b>requirements</b> and increased forage N concentration, but reduced overall annual yield. Compared with sole-cropped oats, double-cropping reduced the risk of erosion by extending the duration of soil water deficits and increasing the time ground was under plant cover. When grown as a sole-crop, well fertilised forage sorghum achieved a mean annual cumulative yield of 9. 64 and 6. 05 t DM/ha on the Vertosol and Sodosol, respectively, being about twice that of sole-cropped oats. Forage sorghum established using zero-tillage practices and fertilised at 175 kg N/ha. crop achieved a significantly higher yield and forage N concentration than did the industry-standard forage sorghum (conventional tillage and 55 kg N/ha. crop) on the Vertosol but not on the Sodosol. On the Vertosol, mean annual yield increased from 5. 65 to 9. 64 t DM/ha (33 kg DM/kg N fertiliser applied above the base rate); the difference in the response between the two sites was attributed to soil type and fertiliser history. Changing both tillage practices and N-fertiliser rate had no affect on fallow water-storage efficiency but did improve fallow ground cover. When forage sorghum, grown as a sole crop, was replaced with lablab in 3 of the 5 years, overall forage N concentration increased significantly, and on the Vertosol, yield and soil nitrate-N reserves also increased significantly relative to industry-standard sorghum. All forage systems maintained or increased the concentration of soil nitrate-N (0 – 1. 2 -m soil layer) {{over the course of the}} study. Relative to sole-crop oats, alternative forage systems were generally beneficial to the concentration of surface-soil (0 – 0. 1 m) organic carbon and systems that included sorghum showed most promise for increasing soil organic carbon concentration. We conclude that an emphasis on double- or summer sole-cropping rather than winter sole-cropping will advantage both farm productivity and the soil-resource base...|$|R
