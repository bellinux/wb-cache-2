40|$|The thesis {{deals with}} the {{development}} of self-leveling cement screed with compensated shrinkage. It is a ternary binder system with the majority of portland cement, that in the beginning of setting and hardening form an <b>expandable</b> <b>folder</b> ettringite. At first there was a background research of volume changes of hydrating cement composites and methods for measuring these changes. Various sort of expansion additives were also introduced, the main emphasis was on concepts of calculated formation of ettringite, which are typical for self-leveling underlayment. Background research included the issues of formation of ettringite, influences on it’s nucleation and it’s stability. The practical development of the screed began by measuring volume changes of different pastes on a ternary composition. Selected formulations suitable for use are verified together with additives to semi-application tests. After the final configuration of the screed mixture, there was a test in real application of an representative area. Individual formulations were tested in terms of long-term stability of ettringite in dry and moist environments...|$|E

A Re-sort button forces the entire Start Menu to be sorted by name. The Taskbar introduces support for balloon notifications which can also be used by application developers. Windows 2000 Explorer introduces customizable Windows Explorer toolbars, auto-complete in Windows Explorer address bar and Run box, advanced file type association features, displaying comments in shortcuts as tooltips, extensible columns in Details view (IColumnProvider interface), icon overlays, integrated search pane in Windows Explorer, sort by name function for menus, and Places bar in common dialogs for Open and Save.|$|R

Nicholson Baker considers the notability standards arbitrary and essentially unsolvable:There are quires, reams, bales of controversy over what constitutes notability in Wikipedia: nobody will ever sort it out.Criticizing the [...] "deletionists", Baker then writes:Still, a lot of good work—verifiable, informative, brain-leapingly strange—is being cast out of this paperless, infinitely <b>expandable</b> accordion <b>folder</b> by people who have a narrow, almost grade-schoolish notion of what sort of curiosity an on-line encyclopedia will be able to satisfy in the years to come.... It's harder to improve something that's already written, or to write something altogether new, especially now that so many of the World Book-sanctioned encyclopedic fruits are long plucked. There are some people on Wikipedia now who are just bullies, who take pleasure in wrecking and mocking peoples' work—even to the point of laughing at nonstandard [...] "Engrish". They poke articles full of warnings and citation-needed notes and deletion prods till the topics go away.|$|R
