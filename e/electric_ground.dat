50|$|Electric {{discharges}} {{produced in}} the gas from the high voltage side of the piezoelectric transformer have properties found also in the corona discharges and in the dielectric barrier discharges. While the former mode occurs when the high voltage side of the piezoelectric transformer is operated far from the <b>electric</b> <b>grounds,</b> the latter mode occurs when it is operated close to the <b>electric</b> <b>grounds</b> separated by a dielectric. Near the open <b>electric</b> <b>grounds,</b> the piezoelectric transformer produces periodic sparks. Transition to the electric arc does not occur because of the limited power of the transformer. The typical power of such transformers is {{of the order of}} 10 W. The efficiency of the plasma generation reaches 90 %, while the remaining 10 % of the power is lost due to mechanical heating of the piezoelectric transformer.|$|R
5000|$|Corona {{discharges}} {{appear at}} atmospheric pressures in strongly non-uniform electric fields. Sharp edges of high voltage electrodes produce such fields in their vicinity. When {{the field in}} the rest space is negligible - this happens at large distances to the <b>electric</b> <b>grounds</b> - the corona discharge can be ignited. Otherwise, the high voltage electrodes may spark to the ground.|$|R
5000|$|Corona {{discharges}} {{occur in}} the regions of high electric fields with high field gradients, present near sharp edges of high voltage electrodes. To prevent sparking, such electrodes should be far from the <b>electric</b> <b>grounds.</b> While corona discharges require rather high voltages, the emitted electric currents are low, resulting in a low discharge power. Although the DC operation is standard for the corona discharge, the AC operation increases its power.|$|R

For instance, Zena-Lan can perform a whirlwind kick in light armor and an <b>electric</b> <b>ground</b> pound attack with the heavy armor. The armor can be torn off, however, removing these attacks, a gameplay feature previously used in Allumer's Blandia, while Sega would later use it in the decade for their Fighting Vipers games.|$|E
50|$|The main {{advantage}} of these vehicles is their clean, quiet operation. They do not use fossil fuels like coal or diesel fuel, emit no exhaust gases and do not require the railway to have expensive infrastructure like <b>electric</b> <b>ground</b> rails or overhead catenary. On the down side is {{the weight of the}} batteries, which raises the vehicle weight, and their range before recharging of between 300 and 600 kilometres. Currently, battery electric units have a higher purchase price and running cost than petrol or diesel railcars, needing one or more charging stations along the routes they operate.|$|E
5000|$|Piezoelectric direct {{discharge}} can {{be considered}} as a special technical realization of the dielectric barrier discharge, which combines the alternating current high voltage generator, high voltage electrode and the dielectric barrier into a single element. Namely, the high voltage is generated with a piezo-transformer, the secondary circuit of which acts also as the high voltage electrode. [...] Since the piezoelectric material of the transformer, such as lead zirconate titanate, is often a dielectric, the produced electric discharge resembles properties of the dielectric barrier discharge. In addition, when operated in far from the <b>electric</b> <b>ground,</b> it also produces corona discharges on the sharp edges of the piezo-transformer.|$|E

5000|$|Another {{location}} of the Bock's stories was the early 17th century stone fort in Kajaani. According to Bock, a castle was situated in the place already in the 13th century, when a royal treasure of Kings of Finland, including a golden buck statue, was hidden in a well {{in the courtyard of}} the castle. Some excitement arose when ground-penetrating radar investigations made in 1996 and 2000 suggested that a sizable metal item was located at 4 meters depth of the courtyard of the fort. According to the state archaeologist Henrik Lilius the item was probably an old cannon that could have fallen into the well during the destruction of the fort in 1716. A new investigation made in 2006 was not able to verify the earlier observations. [...] During an archaeological excavation made later in 2006, it was noticed that an <b>electric</b> <b>ground</b> cable had been dug in the courtyard at 40 cm depth. According to the project manager Selja Flink of the National Board of Antiquities, it was most probably the object noticed in the ground-penetrating radar investigations.

40|$|Torque {{vectoring}} in <b>electric</b> <b>ground</b> vehicles (EGV) with individually actuated in-wheel motors (IAIWM) {{presents the}} opportunity to implement {{a wide range of}} control strategies for controlling vehicle yaw rate to improve vehicle stability and performance. The use of IAIWMs allows for alternative vehicle layout configurations which previously would have been unavailable to conventional internal combustion engine vehicles. The use of higher level control architectures to distribute torque amongst the two front wheel-drive, rear wheel-drive or four wheel-drive in-wheel motors of an <b>electric</b> <b>ground</b> vehicle has presented {{the opportunity to}} design characteristics of <b>electric</b> <b>ground</b> vehicles through active control of power trains. Previously in internal combustion engine vehicles, these characteristics have been indirectly tuned via common chassis parameters. The use of modern components such as in-wheel motors in <b>electric</b> <b>ground</b> vehicles also provides additional benefits such as precise torque generation, fast motor response and the capability to produce forward and reverse torque as well as regenerative braking to improve energy efficiency, and enabling the estimation or measurement of useful feedback information. This feedback information can be applied to direct yaw-moment control (DYC) strategies which can be used to improve vehicle performance. The application of these new vehicle configurations can allow for differential torque output to the left and right hand side of vehicles, generating a yaw moment, and hence directly affecting the yaw rate of the vehicle in a practice known as direct yaw-moment control. In addition to the potential <b>electric</b> <b>ground</b> vehicles possess for superior vehicle stability and performance, they are also a viable solution for the environmental concerns pertaining to transport needs and meeting lower emissions targets. In this thesis the process of converting an internal combustion engine vehicle to a fully electric vehicle with IAIWM will be presented. The first aim of this thesis is to conduct a literature review in which control strategies available for allocating torque to individually actuated in-wheel motors on an <b>electric</b> <b>ground</b> vehicle are investigated, with the objectives of improving vehicle dynamics performance through control of yaw rate response. Secondly, this thesis will present the development of a simulation framework which models vehicle behaviour and addresses the major performance indicators relevant to evaluating vehicle dynamics performance with regards to torque vectoring(TV) /DYC strategies. Next, this thesis aims to show the effects of a traction control strategy, developed for active differentials, when adapted and extended for use as a direct yaw-moment control strategy on an <b>electric</b> <b>ground</b> vehicle with individually actuated in-wheel motors. This torque vectoring control strategy’s effect on a vehicle’s dynamic performance will be validated and analysed through use of simulations, using the platform developed as part of the work involved in this thesis. The simulation platform presented in this thesis is also intended for use as tool for investigation on future projects pertaining to the experimental electric vehicle. The next objective of this thesis is to establish the measurement and estimation techniques available and how they could be implemented through suitable hardware to measure and record the relevant performance indicators of vehicle dynamics in relation to a DYC strategy. Finally, this thesis aims to prove the accuracy of the simulation platform developed using experimental data acquired from sensors implemented on the experimental vehicle. The simulation platform is validated experimentally as an accurate representation of the experimental system and its performance in terms of realistic vehicle dynamics. Experimental data is used to recreate real-life driving manoeuvres in the simulation platform, and verify its performance by comparing results...|$|E
