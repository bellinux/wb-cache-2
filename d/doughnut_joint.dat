50|$|This type {{of joint}} {{has also been}} used on drive shafts. Farm {{tractors}} and lawn and garden equipment have often used them in this application, and even some higher-power applications, such as some 1960s race cars, featured them. In automobile and truck prop shaft designs, they have now mostly been replaced by constant-velocity joints or driveshafts with pairs of universal joints. Rear-wheel drive cars have commonly used a lengthwise propeller shaft with a rubber <b>doughnut</b> <b>joint</b> at the gearbox end (limited movement) and a universal joint at the rear axle (greater movement), or vice versa. This gives articulation where needed, but also stops some of the vibration being transmitted into the body.|$|E
