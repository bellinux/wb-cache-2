After being awarded a free ball Burnett took the brown as an extra red, then a brown, then added 15 reds and 12 blacks, two pinks and a blue. He then potted the colours to complete a historic and remarkable 148 break. He afterwards commented [...] "I didn't {{really know how to}} react afterwards.

50|$|The {{music video}} was {{directed}} by Michael Merriman, was filmed in California, instead of Tennessee, like in the song's lyric, and features actor Billy Bob Thornton, who plays the man. The woman comes up to him at a truck stop and asks for a ride. The woman then robs a convenience store, and asks the man to drive away as the clerk is chasing her down. The man tells her that robbing the store was a big deal, while the woman thought that <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>no</b> <b>big</b> <b>deal.</b> He wonders {{what she was doing}} with a gun, and he also wonders how much money is in one of her bags. Later that night, at a motel, they're counting all the money, and enjoying themselves, at least until the police arrives, and the man and the woman are both arrested. The woman tries to fool one of the cops into letting her go, but the cop doesn't buy it. Travis Tritt plays the tow truck driver, who tows the man's car away with the man looking at it being towed away, and looking ashamed.|$|E

György Ligeti, John Cage and Terry Riley all taught in Stockholm. <b>It</b> <b>was</b> <b>no</b> <b>big</b> <b>deal</b> to master all that - it was only a question of techniques, not of music, nothing about it was authentic. .... It was a time of unbearable self-denial. Metrical rhythms, melodies, even particular intervals were all taboo in contemporary music. This was a catastrophe for the human voice and the human ear - was then, and still is." [...] Anyone stepping out of line, he said, was immediately banished.

I consider several possible relations between the two faculties, bring conceptual arguments and empirical evidence to bear on them, and end up arguing for a version of co-evolution. To model this co-evolution, we must distinguish between different stages or levels of language and theory of mind, which fueled each other’s evolution in a protracted escalation process...|$|R

50|$|The {{traditional}} historiography or tambo of the Minangkabau {{tells of}} the development of the Minangkabau World (alam Minangkabau) and its adat.

50|$|<b>It</b> <b>is</b> {{interesting}} how in Jacquie Jones piece, Construction of Black Sexuality, “the Black male character, as defined through his sexual behavior, {{is not able}} to overcome the problematic of domination which begins with a denial of dependency. Instead, the Black male character can only define himself through violent separateness” (250). One very disturbing scene in the film was when Sister and her boyfriend Satin are lying together on a bed. To get a coat, Satin tells sister she has to crawl. Sister does not think he is serious, so he angrily says it again. Satin then begins to brutally punch Sister. When Sister goes to her next performance, her other sisters realize that she has been beaten by Satin.
