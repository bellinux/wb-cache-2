25|$|Velvet worms are {{segmented}} {{animals with}} a flattened cylindrical body cross-section {{and rows of}} unstructured body appendages known as oncopods or lobopods (informally: stub feet). The animals grow to between 0.5 and 20cm (.2 to 8in), with the average being about 5cm (2 <b>in),</b> <b>and</b> <b>have</b> between 13 and 43 pairs of legs. Their skin consists of numerous, fine transverse rings and is often inconspicuously coloured orange, red or brown, but sometimes also bright green, blue, gold or white, and occasionally patterned with other colours. Segmentation is outwardly inconspicuous, and identifiable by the regular spacing of the pairs of legs and in the regular arrangement of skin s, excretion organs and concentrations of nerve cells. The individual body sections are largely unspecialised; even the head develops only a little differently from the abdominal segments. Segmentation is apparently specified by the same gene as in other groups of animals, and is activated in each case, during embryonic development, at the rear border of each segment and in the growth zone of the stub feet. Although onychophorans fall within the protostome group, their early development has a deuterostome trajectory, (with the mouth and anus forming separately); this trajectory is concealed by the rather sophisticated processes which occur in early development.|$|E
500|$|In August 1835, Poe {{left the}} {{destitute}} family behind {{and moved to}} Richmond, Virginia {{to take a job}} at the Southern Literary Messenger. While Poe was away from Baltimore, another cousin, Neilson Poe, the husband of Virginia's half-sister Josephine Clemm, heard that Edgar was considering marrying Virginia. Neilson offered to take her <b>in</b> <b>and</b> <b>have</b> her educated in an attempt to prevent the girl's marriage to Edgar at such a young age, though suggesting that the option could be reconsidered later. Edgar called Neilson, the owner of a newspaper in Baltimore, Maryland, his [...] "bitterest enemy" [...] and interpreted his cousin's actions as an attempt at breaking his connection with Virginia. On August 29, 1835, Edgar wrote an emotional letter to Maria, declaring that he was [...] "blinded with tears while writing", and pleading that she allow Virginia to make her own decision. Encouraged by his employment at the Southern Literary Messenger, Poe offered to provide financially for Maria, Virginia and Henry if they moved to Richmond.|$|E

2500|$|A study {{conducted}} at the University of Zurich suggested that democracy and federalism bring well-being to individuals. [...] It concluded that the more direct political participation possibilities available to citizens raises their subjective well-being. [...] Two reasons were given for this finding. [...] First, {{a more active role}} for citizens enables better monitoring of professional politicians by citizens, which leads to greater satisfaction with government output. [...] Second, the ability for citizens to get involved <b>in</b> <b>and</b> <b>have</b> control over the political process, independently increases well-being.|$|E
2500|$|Trombicula is a genus of harvest mites [...] (also {{known as}} red bugs, scrub-itch mites, berry bugs, {{or in their}} larval stage, as chiggers or chigoe) in the Trombiculidae family.

[...] These relatives of ticks are nearly microscopic, measuring 0.4mm (0.01 <b>in)</b> <b>and</b> <b>have</b> a chrome-orange hue. A common species of harvest mite in North America is Trombicula alfreddugesi; in the UK, the most prevalent harvest mite is Trombicula autumnalis.|$|E

2500|$|Seeking to musically express Raekwon's {{blend of}} Five Percenter creed and inner-city experience, {{producer}} RZA worked intensively on a polished sound, slower and more layered {{than that of}} Wu-Tang's previous efforts, using strings, piano loops and vocal samples from Kung Fu movies, and Mafia films. Due to Raekwon's storytelling, mobster-minded approach, the producer set up Only Built 4 Cuban Linx... to play like scenes in a crime movie. RZA has cited soul musician Isaac Hayes as an influence on his orchestral approach to several of the album's tracks. He also later revealed {{that several of the}} album's beats, such as [...] "Incarcerated Scarfaces," [...] were originally intended for Wu-Tang member GZA's Liquid Swords album, but because of Raekwon's timely writing approach, were used last minute for Cuban Linx. In regard to this, Raekwon clarified [...] "RZA's house was more or less like a candy store. You come <b>in</b> <b>and</b> <b>have</b> all kinds of shit to choose from. I would take stuff that I felt would suit my album correctly; others would take their own beats too. The beats were like a grab bag. If I came in and heard a beat that someone already claimed, then I just had to fall back. We almost never fought over beats or nothing. I'd tell RZA if I liked a certain beat, and he'd see if it would fit me or not." ...|$|E
2500|$|Rick Santorum, who {{was enjoying}} {{a surge in}} the polls {{following}} his narrow second-place finish in the Iowa Caucuses, clashed with Mitt Romney over comments he had made that the country didn't need a CEO or manager as President. Santorum said, [...] "We need a leader... someone who, has the experience {{to go out and}} be the commander-in-chief... The commander-in-chief of this country isn't a CEO. It's someone who has to lead... being the president is not a CEO... You've got to lead and inspire." [...] Romney responded, [...] "I think people who spend their life in Washington don't understand what happens out in the real economy. They think that people who start businesses are just managers. The chance to lead in free enterprise is extraordinarily critical to also being able to lead a state, like I led in Massachusetts and, by the way, lead the Olympics. My experience is in leadership." [...] Newt Gingrich then criticised Romney's record at Bain Capital, saying [...] "I'm very much for free enterprise... I'm not nearly as enamored of a Wall Street model where you can flip companies, you can go <b>in</b> <b>and</b> <b>have</b> leveraged buyouts, you can basically take out all the money, leaving behind the workers." [...] Romney replied, [...] "I'm not surprised to have The New York Times try and put free enterprise on trial. I'm not surprised to have the Obama administration do that, either. It's a little surprising from my colleagues on this stage." ...|$|E
