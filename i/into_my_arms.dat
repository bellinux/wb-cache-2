2500|$|On July 13, 1996, Anselmo {{went into}} cardiac arrest {{due to a}} heroin {{overdose}} after a show at the Coca-Cola Starplex in Dallas, TX. Paramedics revived him and four days later he issued a press release stating, [...] "I, Philip H. Anselmo injected a lethal dose of heroin <b>into</b> <b>my</b> <b>arm,</b> and died for four to five minutes".|$|R
500|$|More {{than one}} scene proved {{problematic}} for Breezy {{during the filming}} of the episode, as the decontamination room set was an enclosed four wall set, meaning that in the scene where Archer rubs down Porthos with decontamination gel, Breezy's trainer Scott Rowe couldn't be on the set with her. Normally {{he would have been}} behind the camera assisting the director by ensuring the dog is looking wherever the scene required. He hoped that with him off the set, that Breezy would look where required and not directly at the camera. In order to prepare for the scene where Porthos leaps out of an immersion tank and into Archer's arms, Rowe had a mock-up created so he could practice it with Breezy. He said that [...] "By the time we went into it on that one day to prep on set with Scott, she was jumping out of it <b>into</b> <b>my</b> <b>arms,</b> but I had to make sure that she's going to jump out and do it into Scott's arms." [...] In the final scene, not only did Breezy leap into Bakula's arms, but she also licked him repeatedly on the face. This wasn't due to training, but because they wiped food on Bakula's face.|$|E
2500|$|During a {{break in}} filming of The Late Late Show with James Corden carpool karaoke segment which aired on June 14, 2016 and {{featured}} the band singing karaoke to their music with the host while driving through Los Angeles, Kiedis performed emergency CPR on a baby. [...] "a woman {{came out of her}} house, holding a child saying, 'My baby, my baby, my baby can't breathe!'" [...] Kiedis said. [...] "the woman thrust the baby <b>into</b> <b>my</b> <b>arms,</b> the baby was not breathing and I thought, 'I'm gonna try and do a little baby CPR real quick, see if I can get some air in this kid. So I started rubbing the belly, bubbles came out of the mouth, the eyes rolled back into place, the ambulance showed up and I handed the baby over, who was now breathing and fine, and we went back to Carpool Karaoke." ...|$|E
2500|$|At the 'Bloody Angle,' Spotsylvania, May 12th, our corps, the Sixth, {{supported}} the Second {{in the famous}} charge against [...] Johnson's Division of the Confederate Army. During the thickest of the fight, Lieutenant Wellman was badly wounded, and I was ordered {{to take him to}} the rear. It was about a mile to the hospital, and the shot and shell came so thick and fast that it was extremely hazardous to venture across with a wounded comrade, but I succeeded in carrying out the order, and after placing the lieutenant in the hospital, I came safely back through the fire. Upon reaching my company, Lieutenant Sparks congratulated me, saying: ' Tracy, I hope you will not have to cross that field on a like errand again.' Scarcely had he finished speaking, when a ball pierced his left breast and he fell <b>into</b> <b>my</b> <b>arms.</b> We thought he was mortally wounded, but discovering signs of life in him, decided {{to take him to the}} hospital, without waiting for orders.|$|E
60|$|But it was Lop-Ear and I {{who caught}} them. He looked at me, {{and then we}} made a dash for it. The puppies knew no place to run except into the lair, and we headed them off. One rushed between my legs. I squatted and grabbed him. He sank his sharp little teeth <b>into</b> <b>my</b> <b>arm,</b> and I dropped him in the suddenness of the hurt and surprise. The next moment he had scurried inside.|$|R
6000|$|... "Say 'sir' {{when you}} speak to a genelman," [...] said Belcher, and with a sudden tilt of the table he sent Berks flying almost <b>into</b> <b>my</b> uncle's <b>arms.</b>|$|R
60|$|And also I applaud, dearest Howard, your {{expression}} of attachment to him who holds this pen (and passes {{it at this}} moment over very dirty paper:) for he is extremely accessible to such demonstrations and touched by them--more than ever in his lonely (more than) maturity. Keep it up as hard as possible; continue to pass your hand <b>into</b> <b>my</b> <b>arm</b> and believe that I always like greatly to feel it. We are two who can communicate freely.|$|R
60|$|She swung {{herself down}} <b>into</b> <b>my</b> <b>arms,</b> and stood beside me face to face.|$|E
60|$|We {{exchanged}} no greetings. She slid {{from her}} saddle <b>into</b> <b>my</b> <b>arms,</b> {{and for one}} instant I held her.|$|E
60|$|She came {{a little}} closer <b>into</b> <b>my</b> <b>arms</b> {{with a sigh of}} content. My lady of the turquoises laughed outright.|$|E
6000|$|... 'I cannot tell,' replied Mrs. Lodge, {{shaking her}} head. 'One night when I was sound asleep, dreaming I was away in some strange place, a pain {{suddenly}} shot <b>into</b> <b>my</b> <b>arm</b> there, {{and was so}} keen as to awaken me. I must have struck it in the daytime, I suppose, though I don't remember doing so.' She added, laughing, 'I tell my dear husband that it looks just {{as if he had}} flown into a rage and struck me there. O, I daresay it will soon disappear.' ...|$|R
60|$|I stood swaying {{backward}} and forward for a moment, sick and dizzy with {{the horror of}} it. My eyes grew dim, and a mist seemed to fill the room. Then I felt myself sink back <b>into</b> <b>my</b> lover's <b>arms,</b> and memory became a blank. I had fainted.|$|R
6000|$|Victory had {{commenced}} the descent, but I {{called to}} her to stop just above the window, and, as the lion reappeared, growling and snarling, I put a [...] .33 bullet in his face, {{and at the same}} moment Victory slipped quickly past him, dropping <b>into</b> <b>my</b> upraised <b>arms</b> that were awaiting her.|$|R
6000|$|... "Here, captain," [...] cried Nat Grove, leaping {{into the}} life-buoy, [...] "lift him <b>into</b> <b>my</b> <b>arms.</b> The ropes {{are strong enough}} for both." ...|$|E
60|$|I {{gathered}} him <b>into</b> <b>my</b> <b>arms</b> at that, but my embrace drew a groan from him, for the poor, faithful knave {{was very}} sore.|$|E
6000|$|... 'He's not--he's not my cousin, Ellen!' {{she went}} on, {{gathering}} fresh grief from reflection, and flinging herself <b>into</b> <b>my</b> <b>arms</b> for {{refuge from the}} idea.|$|E
5000|$|On {{the morning}} of the battle, Forrest and his cavalry corps were {{approaching}} Sacramento when they were informed by a sympathizer named Mollie Morehead that the Union force led by Eli H. Murray was watering their horses nearby. Forrest, who had been wintering in camp near Hopkinsville with his family since Christmas, had already taken scouting reports that morning which stated that the enemy force had been nearby moving {{along the banks of the}} Green River, and was keen to attack. Despite cold weather and light rain, Forrest led his forces in pursuit. Morehead rode alongside Forrest, and the latter would later remark that [...] "her untied tresses, floating in the breeze, infused <b>into</b> <b>my</b> <b>arm</b> and kindled knightly chivalry in my heart." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Why, as to that matter, your Honour, {{schools were}} scarce in {{my part of}} the country; and in Africa, you know, there is no great matter of learning; so that, had her name been out of water, which it was not, {{we might have been}} bothered to read it. Howsomever, there was a horse-bucket kicking about her decks, and which, as luck would have it, got jammed-in with the pumps in such a fashion that it did not go {{overboard}} until we took it with us. Well, this bucket had a name painted on it; and, after we had leisure for the thing, I got Guinea, who has a natural turn at tattooing, to rub it <b>into</b> <b>my</b> <b>arm</b> in gunpowder, as the handiest way of logging these small particulars. Your Honour shall see what the black has made of it." ...|$|R
6000|$|... '"As you may guess {{from what}} you have seen," [...] said the young lady, [...] "the party were {{prepared}} to murder me if I appealed to any one for assistance. If their accomplices find us here, we are lost. Two minutes hence may be too late. The mail!" [...] With these words, overpowered by her feelings, and the exertion of sticking the young Marquess of Filletoville, she sank <b>into</b> <b>my</b> uncle's <b>arms.</b> <b>My</b> uncle caught her up, and bore her to the house door. There stood the mail, with four long-tailed, flowing-maned, black horses, ready harnessed; but no coachman, no guard, no hostler even, at the horses' heads.|$|R
6000|$|... "Ay, an' he's the gen'leman," [...] {{said another}} fireman, [...] "who shoved your missus, sir, <b>into</b> <b>my</b> <b>arms,</b> w'en she was bent on runnin' up-stairs." ...|$|E
6000|$|Her hands {{went to her}} throat. Her {{eyes seemed}} as though they would devour me. Yet she was not wholly sure! I took her <b>into</b> <b>my</b> <b>arms!</b> ...|$|E
60|$|When I heard this, {{making no}} answer, I swept her <b>into</b> <b>my</b> <b>arms</b> and kissed her, {{and there she}} lay upon my breast and kissed me back.|$|E
6000|$|... "As you please. They {{offered me}} their {{patronage}} {{on condition of}} my entering the Church; I declined both the terms and the recompence; I withdrew from my cold uncles, and preferred throwing myself <b>into</b> <b>my</b> elder brother's <b>arms,</b> from whose affectionate embrace I am now torn by the cruel intermeddling of a stranger--of yourself, in short." ...|$|R

6000|$|... "Every word," [...] replied Blair. [...] "Some kid!... She's {{like the}} girl in the motion-pictures. She comes along. She meets the fellow. She looks at him--she says 'good day'--then Wham, <b>into</b> his <b>arms....</b> <b>My</b> God!... Lane, is that kid good or bad?" ...|$|R
