40|$|One major {{constraint}} to plantain {{production has}} been inadequate healthy planting materials {{at the time}} of planting. Several technologies for multiplying healthy planting materials exist but could not meet farmers’ demand. A study was conducted to assess the performance of various landraces plantain to plants issus de bourgeons secondaires (PIBS) technique. Five cultivars of Musa sapientum (Apantu (False Horn), Asamienu (True Horn), Oniaba (intermediate <b>French</b> <b>plantain)</b> and FHIA- 21 (tetraploid hybrid plantain) were tested to determine their response to the PIBS technique. Sword suckers of each cultivar with weight of between 0. 2 - 0. 5 kg were prepared and buried in fine sawdust in a humidity chamber built using transparent polyethylene sheets. Results at harvest showed that removal of rooted sprouts started three weeks after planting and every week thereafter for eight weeks. The intermediate <b>French</b> <b>plantain</b> cultivar (Oniaba) produced the least average number (about 20) of healthy planting. Apantu (False Horn) produced an average of about 75 healthy planting materials. The hybrid FHIA- 21 on the other hand generated an average of about 85 healthy planting materials. Asamienu (True Horn) produced the highest healthy seedlings of about 90 healthy planting materials. The results revealed that the leaf scar carries a primary bud at the intersection of each leaf sheath and several eyes along {{the entire length of the}} leaf sheath which could not have developed into suckers. However, with this technique the eyes could be activated to sprout as healthy planting materials. The technique proved as an efficient method of multiplying healthy planting materials for plantain and could thus be recommended for adoption not only by peasant farmers but also to others who could become commercial seed producers. But there will be a need for certification guidelines for seed growing systems...|$|E
40|$|Field {{performance}} of two IITA plantain hybrids (‘PITA- 1 ’, ‘PITA- 4 ’) were assessed at two locations in Ghana alongside two local landraces (False Horn ‘Brodeyuo’, Intermediate French ‘Oniaba’) and a hybrid cultivar ‘Apem Hemaa’ (‘FHIA- 21 ’). The {{objective of the}} study was to identify high yielding and disease resistant hybrids for growers in Ghana. The hybrids were evaluated for their agronomic performance and yield, tolerance to Black Sigatoka disease, number of functional leaves at flowering and at harvest, crop cycle, plant height and pseudostem girth. The results showed that the hybrids were tolerant/resistant to the Black Sigatoka (Mycosphaerella fi jiensis) disease with high number of functional leaves at flowering and at harvest. This characteristic of the hybrids was an important feature that could fit well into the smallholder cropping system. The crop cycles were comparable to that of ‘False Horn’ plantains. The yield {{performance of}} the hybrids was better compared to the landraces. The number of hands per bunch produced by the hybrids was also higher than those of the landraces except the intermediate <b>French</b> <b>plantain</b> (‘Oniaba’). The finger lengths of the IITA hybrids were however shorter compared to the landraces and this could hinder their acceptance by consumers...|$|E
40|$|Plantain is an {{important}} staple in West and Central Africa, where it is predominantly grown by smallholder farmers. On-farm data are rare but yields {{are considered to be}} low. We collated actual yields in the region, reviewed regional plantain research published from 1976 to 2013, then estimated what yields would be attainable on smallholder farms if the proven, best-fit innovations were adopted. Mean actual yields reported ranged from 2. 9 to 8. 9 Mg ha− 1 with a mean of 5. 7 Mg ha− 1 for False horn plantain and 4. 5 to 10. 2 Mg ha− 1 with a mean of 7. 8 Mg ha− 1 for <b>French</b> <b>plantain.</b> Experiments found dealt with: cultural practices, particularly intercropping; abiotic factors such as fertiliser, mulch application and irrigation; biotic factors, predominantly sucker sanitation methods, but including three controlled yield loss studies on nematodes and black sigatoka; landrace comparisons and the introduction of improved cultivars, predominantly those exhibiting black sigatoka-tolerance. We conclude that intercropping should be retained according to farmer preference as {{there was no evidence of}} yield reductions for plantain. Boiling water treatment of suckers should be universally recommended. Inputs, whether mulch or K fertiliser up to 300 kg ha− 1 should be applied as both reduced plant losses and increased bunch mass. With the highest yielding local landrace type, on-farm yields could be increased from 7. 8 Mg ha− 1 to 35. 5 Mg ha− 1 with purchased inputs or to 23. 7 Mg ha− 1 without purchased inputs...|$|E
40|$|Growth {{indices are}} useful for {{interpreting}} plant reaction to environmental factor. Using Growing Degree Days (GDD) for estimating the phonological growth stages is more valid instead of calendar time. In order to study effect of salinity on growth analysis in three different plantago species, a greenhouse experiment was conducted in Vali-e-Asr University of Rafsanjan in 2009. The study was carried out factorial experiment based on RCBD design with 4 replications to {{determine the influence of}} salinity (9, 15, 21 dS/m and control with distilled water) and three plantago species (Isabgul, <b>French</b> psyllium, Great <b>plantain).</b> Polynomial equations with the 88 to 98 distinction coefficient (R 2) were known as the best indicator for interpreting of growth indices fluctuation to GDD. In all three species, the highest dry matter accumulation, leaf area, Crop growth rates (CGR) were observed in 900 - 1000 GDD at all salinity levels and in higher GDD, the decreeing trend of dry matter accumulation, leaf area and CGR were observed in all salinity levels. The lowest relative growth rate, crop growth rate, Leaf area ratio, dry matter accumulation were observed in 21 dS/m NaCl salinity. Results also indicated that maximum dry matter accumulation was observed in 800, 900 and 1100 degree day in Isabgul, <b>French</b> psyllium, Great <b>plantain,</b> respectively. No seed harvested from Isabgul and French psyllium in 21 dS/m. Among three species, great plantain could remain the highest leaf area consequently this species produced higher dry matter (0. 4 gr per plant) and relative growth rate (0. 06 g. g- 1. 10 GDD- 1) compared to other species. In general, among three species, great plantain was better species from a growth and seed yield point of view in salinity stress...|$|R
40|$|Plantain {{is a major}} {{staple food}} in the humid tropics of Africa {{providing}} more than 25 % of the carbohydrates required by about 70 million people. In addition to being an important staple food for rural and urban consumers, plantain provides {{an important source of}} revenue for smallholders who produce them in compounds or home gardens as well as in large-scale field production. In Nigeria three main plantain cultivars are grown; the <b>French</b> <b>plantain</b> the Horn plantain and the Falsehorn plantain. Each of these cultivars produces only one bunch of fruit and yet some farmers in Eastern Nigeria claim to have a plantain 'type' that produced two bunches at fruiting. A scientist from the Department of Crop Science of the University of Nigeria, conducted a survey in Southern Nigeria into the incidence of a phenomenon known as 'double bunching'. While the centre of origin or concentration of this plantain 'type' cannot yet be pinned down to any particular location of Southern Nigeria, it was observed that double-bunching was found in every part of Southern Nigeria where plantain is primarily cultivated. The reason for this double bunching, or dichotomy, is still unknown but it was observed that some 50 % of the suckers from double-bunching plantains reverted back to single bunching. The initial investigation has thrown up some interesting questions that need further research such as: - Is dichotomy of genetic origin, that is through mutation of the existing plantain cultivars? - Is the dichotomous plantain a naturally occurring but endangered plantain 'types that has not been noted scientifically nor fully domesticated and multiplied for wider cultivation? - Are there certain environmental factors (especially nutritional) that could induce dichotomy in plantain? The researchers are interested in proposals or funding that would enable more research to be conducted into the preservation and development of this potentially useful plantain.
