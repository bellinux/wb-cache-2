5|$|Helen Whittier had {{returned}} to <b>intercoastal</b> service by early 1934 when The New York Times reported that she had sailed from San Francisco on 23 March and arrived at New York on 25 April. In June that same year, Helen Whittier {{was one of the}} Matson ships added to carry food cargo to Hawaii. Shipments of food from the mainland—which accounted for up to 90% of Hawaii's needs—had been curtailed as a coastwise strike had affected all ports except Los Angeles. Helen Whittier sailed on her first food delivery on 23 June with 2,500 tons of food from Los Angeles to Honolulu.|$|E
5|$|In August 1933, the Los Angeles Times {{reported}} that the Shepard Line had secured a year-long charter of Exford for their expanded <b>intercoastal</b> service between North Atlantic ports and the Pacific ports of Los Angeles; San Francisco; Portland, Oregon; and Seattle. Later in 1933, the ship was renamed Pan Royal to reflect the naming style of her new owners, the Pan-Atlantic Steamship Company, a subsidiary of Waterman Steamship Company. The Pan-Atlantic Line sailed in coastal service along the Atlantic and Gulf coasts, {{and it is likely}} that Pan Royal called at typical Pan-Atlantic ports such as Baltimore, Miami, Tampa, New Orleans, Philadelphia, New York, and Boston from this time.|$|E
5|$|Heavy {{rainfall}} in Westgate flooded Okeechobee Road. In Riviera Beach, {{the storm}} destroyed 500homes and impacted another 1,000. About 100businesses were demolished and 50others suffered losses. Overall, damage in Riviera Beach reached approximately $750,000. The bridge linking Riviera Beach to Singer Island across the <b>Intercoastal</b> Waterway was partly destroyed. Kelsey City, {{now known as}} Lake Park, was inflicted with similar impact. During the storm, many residents sought refuge in city hall, which was nearly destroyed by the storm. However, it was later repaired and has been listed as a U.S. National Register of Historic Places since 1981. The gymnasium and auditorium collapsed. Throughout the city, 200homes were completely wrecked and 300others were damaged. A total of 75businesses were destroyed and an equal number suffered impact. The cost of damage in Kelsey City totaled $1million.|$|E
40|$|Since {{the return}} of the Long Duration Exposure Facility (LDEF) in January, 1990, members of the Meteoroid and Debris Special Investigation Group (M&D SIG) at the Johnson Space Center (JSC) in Houston, Texas have been {{examining}} LDEF hardware in an effort to expand the knowledge base regarding the low-Earth orbit (LEO) particulate environment. In addition to the various investigative activities, JSC is also the location of the general Meteoroid & Debris database. This publicly accessible database contains information obtained from the various M&D SIG investigations, as well as limited data obtained by individual LDEF Principal Investigators. LDEF exposed approximately 130 m(exp 2) of surface area to the LEO particulate environment, approximately 15. 4 m(exp 2) of which was occupied by structural frame components (i. e., longerons and <b>intercoastals)</b> of the spacecraft. The data reported here was obtained as a result of detailed scans of LDEF <b>intercoastals,</b> 68 of which reside at JSC. The limited amount of data presently available on the A 0178 thermal control blankets was reported last year and will not be reiterated here. The data presented here are limited to measurements of crater diameters and their frequency of occurrence (i. e., flux) ...|$|R

25|$|In {{the last}} 20 years, the dates and {{anatomical}} features of human remains found in Mexico and South America have led some archaeologists {{to propose that}} those regions were first populated by people who crossed the Pacific several millennia before the Ice Age migrations; according to this theory, these would have been either eliminated or absorbed by the Siberian immigrants. However, current archaeological evidence for human migration to and settlement of remote Oceania (i.e., the Pacific Ocean eastwards of the Solomon Islands) is dated to no earlier than approximately 3,500 BP; trans-Pacific contact with the Americas coinciding with or pre-dating the Beringia migrations of at least 11,500 BP is highly problematic, except for movement along <b>intercoastal</b> routes.|$|E

On September 27, 1954, the eastern terminus was extended to an intersection with the Bluewater Highway, while the western terminus was extended to FM 521 on September 29, 1954 when FM 1605 was combined with the route. On October 24, 1956, the route was redesignated to SH 332 and the western end was extended to SH 36 replacing part of FM 521. On August 15, 1989, a concurrency with SH 288 in Lake Jackson was created.|$|E

Trident Imports, opened on the pier around that time, had a decades-long run of importing everything from rattan furniture from Southeast Asia to chocolate from Belgium. Ted Griffin's Seattle Marine Aquarium was located at the west end of the pier. Its star attraction, Namu the killer whale, died in 1966.
