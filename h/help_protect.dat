5|$|In 1831, Mexican {{authorities}} {{gave the}} settlers of Gonzales a small cannon to <b>help</b> <b>protect</b> them from frequent Comanche raids. Over {{the next four}} years, the political situation in Mexico deteriorated, and in 1835 several states revolted.

5|$|A further {{cause of}} the Lombard {{migration}} into Italy {{may have been an}} invitation from Narses. According to a controversial tradition reported by several medieval sources, Narses, out of spite for having been removed by Justinian's successor Justin II, called the Lombards to Italy. Often dismissed as an unreliable tradition, it has been studied with attention by modern scholars, in particular Neil Christie, who see in it a possible record of a formal invitation by the Byzantine state to settle in northern Italy as foederati, to <b>help</b> <b>protect</b> the region against the Franks, an arrangement that may have been disowned by Justin II after Narses' removal.|$|E
5|$|At {{the ends}} of the linear {{chromosomes}} are specialized regions of DNA called telomeres. The main function of these regions is to allow the cell to replicate chromosome ends using the enzyme telomerase, as the enzymes that normally replicate DNA cannot copy the extreme 3′ ends of chromosomes. These specialized chromosome caps also <b>help</b> <b>protect</b> the DNA ends, and stop the DNA repair systems in the cell from treating them as damage to be corrected. In human cells, telomeres are usually lengths of single-stranded DNA containing several thousand repeats of a simple TTAGGG sequence.|$|E
5|$|Genetic {{diversity}} of crops {{can be used}} to <b>help</b> <b>protect</b> the environment. Crop varieties that are resistant to pests and diseases can reduce the need for application of harmfulpesticides.While crops that are more vigorous can better compete withweeds whichreduces the need for applyingherbicides. This is shown in a case study completed atAarhus Universityin Denmark which used more robust maize.Drought resistant plants can help save water and reduce the need forirrigation whiledeeper rooting varieties can help stabilize soils; and varieties that are more efficient in their use of nutrients require lessfertilizer.|$|E

5|$|Like {{all other}} {{non-human}} primates, strepsirrhines face an elevated risk of extinction due to human activity, particularly deforestation in tropical regions. Much of their habitat {{has been converted}} for human use, such as agriculture and pasture. The threats facing strepsirrhine primates fall into three main categories: habitat destruction, hunting (for bushmeat or traditional medicine), and live capture for export or local exotic pet trade. Although hunting is often prohibited, the laws protecting them are rarely enforced. In Madagascar, local taboos known as fady sometimes <b>help</b> <b>protect</b> lemur species, although some are still hunted for traditional medicine.|$|E

5|$|Bradley {{did much}} to {{advance the cause of}} blacks in Kentucky. He denounced racially {{motivated}} lynchings and demanded that county officials prosecute racial violence. He called a special legislative session in March 1897 to consider an anti-lynching bill that imposed penalties including a fine of up to $500 and removal from office for any peace officer who did not prevent a lynching or mob violence. It further empowered peace officers to recruit able-bodied men to <b>help</b> <b>protect</b> prisoners and fined them for failing to do so, if necessary. Despite the politically divided legislature, the bill quickly passed both houses of the General Assembly and Bradley signed it on May 11, 1897. In January 1898, Bradley accepted an invitation to speak before the Anti-Mob and Lynch Law Association in Springfield, Ohio. During Bradley's four-year term, twenty-five lynchings were committed in the state, down from fifty-six during the term of his predecessor.|$|E
5|$|Fady can {{not only}} <b>help</b> <b>protect</b> lemurs and their forests under stable {{socioeconomic}} situations, {{but they can also}} lead to discrimination and persecution if a lemur is known to bring bad fortune, for instance, if it walks through town. In other ways, fady does not protect all lemurs equally. For example, although the hunting and eating of certain species may be taboo, other species may not share that same protection and are therefore targeted instead. Fady can vary from village to village within the same region. If people move to a new village or region, their fady may not apply to the lemur species that are locally present, making them available for consumption. Fady restrictions on lemur meat can be relaxed in times of famine and drought.|$|E
5|$|German {{infantry}} {{began to}} advance near Losheim before the artillery barrage lifted, preparing {{to cross the}} front line {{as soon as it}} ended. They marched under the glow of massive searchlights, bouncing light off the clouds. The armor was located farther back, near Blankenheim, Germany. At 8:00, as the sun rose, the American platoon heard explosions and guns around Buchholz Station and Losheimergraben to the east and north where the 3rd and 1st Battalions of the 394th Infantry Division was located. The 55 soldiers of U.S. 2nd Platoon, Company A, 820th Tank Destroyer Battalion, 14th Cavalry Group was initially ordered south to <b>help</b> <b>protect</b> Manderfeld, but shortly afterwards were redirected to join the active battle near Buchholz Station.

Amid severe weather conditions, Hull scored the {{squadron}}'s first {{victory of the}} war on 30 January 1940, when he shot down a Heinkel He111 bomber of the Luftwaffe near the island of Coquet. On 26 February the squadron was transferred to RAF Wick in northern Scotland to <b>help</b> <b>protect</b> the Home Fleet at Scapa Flow. Hull, Carey and three others together downed another He111 on 28 March 1940. On 10 April 1940, Hull took part in the destruction of a reconnaissance He111.

5|$|On April 3, air {{search and}} rescue forces {{attempted}} a first light rescue which can successfully achieve surprise with minimal force. A {{search and rescue}} crew took off from the 37th AARS based at Nakhon Phanom, Thailand. It consisted of two HH-53 rescue helicopters, Jolly Green 65 and 67, and two A-1 Skyraiders, Sandy 07 and 08. Sandy 05 and 06 joined them on the scene. The area was covered in a solid overcast, preventing visual control of air strikes by the on-scene OV-10A FAC, Nail 25. Capt. Rocky Smith and Capt. Rick Atchison coordinated the work of several F-4s who were directed to drop CBU-42 anti-personnel cluster bombs around Hambleton to <b>help</b> <b>protect</b> his position. When Nail 25 ran low on fuel, it was replaced by an OV-10 (Nail 38) from the 23rd TASS flown by Capt. William J. Henderson (Nail 38 Alpha) and 1st Lt. Mark Clark (Nail 38 Bravo, and grandson of World War II General Mark Clark).|$|E
5|$|The 7th Division was {{assigned}} to III Corps of the Fourth United States Army, and transferred to Longview, Washington, in August 1941 to participate in tactical maneuvers. Following this training, the division moved back to Fort Ord, California, where it was located when the Japanese attack of Pearl Harbor caused the United States to declare war. The formation proceeded almost immediately to San Jose, California, arriving 11 December 1941 to <b>help</b> <b>protect</b> the west coast and allay civilian fears of invasion. The 53rd Infantry Regiment {{was removed from the}} 7th Division and replaced with the 159th Infantry Regiment, newly deployed from the California Army National Guard. For the early parts of the war, the division participated mainly in construction and training roles. Subordinate units also practiced boat loading at the Monterey Wharf and amphibious assault techniques at the Salinas River in California.|$|E

In May 1941, with World War II and the Battle of the Atlantic raging, Mississippi and her two sister ships were transferred to the Atlantic Fleet to <b>help</b> <b>protect</b> American shipping through the Neutrality Patrols. Two days after the Japanese attack on Pearl Harbor, Mississippi departed the Atlantic {{to return to the}} Pacific Fleet; throughout her participation in World War II, she supported amphibious operations in the Pacific. She shelled Japanese forces during the Gilbert and Marshall Islands and the Philippines campaigns and the invasions of Peleliu and Okinawa.

5|$|A {{year later}} in the United States, Charlie learns that Steve has resurfaced under a new {{identity}} and is laundering the gold through a Ukrainian jeweler named Yevhen to finance his lavish lifestyle in Los Angeles. Charlie gathers the team, and also recruits John's daughter Stella, a skilled private safe cracker, offering her {{the chance to get}} revenge on Steve for her father's death. They stake out Steve's mansion, and Stella, disguising herself as a cable technician, is able to map out its interior, allowing them to determine the location of Steve's safe containing the bullion. Coincidentally, Steve, unaware of Stella's identity, offers {{to go out on a}} date with her. Charlie devises a plan using explosives to blow the safe while Stella is on the date with Steve, using three heavily modified Mini Coopers to transport the gold out of the mansion. Charlie enlists the help of Skinny Pete for the explosives and Wrench to make the modifications on the cars. However, on the night of the planned heist, they find Steve's neighbors are having a party, and the explosives would draw their attention, and they abandon the plan.

5|$|Crowley's {{inheritance}} {{was running}} out. Trying to earn money, {{he was hired}} by George Montagu Bennett, the Earl of Tankerville, to <b>help</b> <b>protect</b> him from witchcraft; recognising Bennett's paranoia as being based in his cocaine addiction, Crowley took him on holiday to France and Morocco to recuperate. In 1907, he also began taking in paying students, whom he instructed in occult and magical practice. Victor Neuburg, whom Crowley met in February 1907, became his sexual partner and closest disciple; in 1908 the pair toured northern Spain before heading to Tangier, Morocco. The following year Neuburg stayed at Boleskine, where he and Crowley engaged in sadomasochism. Crowley continued to write prolifically, producing such works of poetry as Ambergris, Clouds Without Water, and Konx Om Pax, as well as his first attempt at an autobiography, The World's Tragedy. Recognising the popularity of short horror stories, Crowley wrote his own, some of which were published, and he also published several articles in Vanity Fair, a magazine edited by his friend Frank Harris. He also wrote Liber 777, a book of magical and Qabalistic correspondences that borrowed from Mathers and Bennett.|$|E
