They are represented in Europe, North and South America and Asia, close to customers' largest plants or logistic hubs. VLC have around 900 employees and their turnover during 2005 was SEK 8 billion. At the department Volvo Logistics Inbound Export Overseas in Gothenburg, they manage the shipment of production material from suppliers in Europe to Volvo do Brasil (VdB) in Brazil. The purpose of this thesis is to investigate if the VLC/VdB information set- up is advantageous and provide recommendations for an improved information set-up for the inbound material flow to Brazil from the European suppliers. In order to fulfill this purpose the author has performed a literature review about relevant areas involved {{in the field of}} international inbound transportation. The costs for two set-ups within VLC have been mapped and the possibilities given from Volvo Logistics do Brasil’s (VLdB) received status as freight forwarder have been investigated. Further the author has performed benchmarking studies against other companies working with export to Brazil. In the thesis it is concluded that VLC/VdB should include more containers to each Bill of Lading (B/L) since the costs related to customs clearance in Brazil is related to the number of B/Ls and not invoices. VLC should also, based on the findings from the cost mapping in this study, welcome VdB for a discussion whether the consolidation of invoices is to prefer. There is no cost saving potential from this at the customs clearance. If this is agreed upon it is recommended that VLC should make use of VLdB’s <b>freight</b> <b>forward</b> status in order to facilitate the debiting of their logistics services performed for VdB. Further it is recommended that, if the consolidation of invoices will continue, VLC should propose a change of responsibility in the VLC/VdB agreement. VLC should issue a consolidated invoice only based on information from the suppliers’ delivery note/invoice. All deviations should be handled by VdB since this would provide economies of scale and a more effective and clear communication within the inbound supply chain. Validerat; 20101217 (root...|$|E

40|$|LEAN {{thinking}} {{refers to}} waste (any activity that consumes resources without adding value) identification and its elimination from the system. Often introduction of quality management standards requires companies to investment heavily in existing systems but such investments are often perceived as unnecessary costs and therefore many companies in Lithuania {{do not consider}} application of such concepts. One possibility is to use existing internal resources for LEAN management systems in ocean <b>freight</b> <b>forwarding</b> companies in order to optimize internal processes. The efficiency of LEAN management has been analyzed in production and service industries, but its application in ocean <b>freight</b> <b>forwarding</b> in Lithuania as well as worldwide hasn’t been studied in detail in scientific literature. The idea that LEAN management {{could be applied to}} ocean <b>freight</b> <b>forwarding</b> companies is supported by its successful application in other service industries. This paper focuses on ocean <b>freight</b> <b>forwarding</b> companies process optimization using the LEAN concept, which would provide the Lithuanian transport and logistics sector with better results, both on individual company and country level. Research object: application of LEAN management in ocean <b>freight</b> <b>forwarding</b> companies. Research purpose: possibilities for process optimization using the LEAN management in ocean <b>freight</b> <b>forwarding</b> companies. Research tasks: 1. 	Analysis of challenges for optimization of ocean <b>freight</b> <b>forwarding</b> company process; 2. 	Theoretical analysis of LEAN management application solutions; 3. 	Preparation of theoretical model for implementation of LEAN management processes to optimize overall performance of ocean <b>freight</b> <b>forwarding</b> companies; 4. 	Explore applicability of LEAN management for process optimization in UAB,,Gelna”. Methodology: comparative, systematic literature analysis and synthesis was applied in order to explore successfully applied Lean Management techniques and tools. Empirical investigation was applied during a semi-structured interview with UAB,,Gelna” employees. Monitoring of business process to identify a waste, analysis of company documents consisting of company processes and mapping the process flow diagram. Research results: The investigation in UAB,,Gelna” confirmed the possibility of adapting the LEAN management for process optimization in ocean <b>freight</b> <b>forwarding</b> companies. Several LEAN management tools such as process map, process flow diagram and value streaming mapping were tested. As such companies can make better use of available competencies, eliminate errors, reduce waiting times and better define responsibilities. Application of LEAN management faces numerous challenges such as high complexity, standardization of processes and employee resistance. In this case success factors for LEAN management include management engagement and effective communication...|$|R
