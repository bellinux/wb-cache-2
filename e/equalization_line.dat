Given the cost and performance objectives, thisrepresents a very challenging design problem from an algorithmic and technology point of view. This survey paper describes the alternative design approaches concentrating on algorithmic issues as opposed to circuit design issues, {{in the context of}} the echo cancellation (EC) method of full duplex data transmission.

40|$|Lecturepg. 88 The {{majority}} of horizontally split multistage pumps were designed when packing {{was the only}} cost effective method of sealing the pumpage from atmosphere. As a result, even modern pumps employ a stuffing box pressure <b>equalization</b> <b>line</b> (balance line) to lower stuffing box pressures. This technique of pressure equalization has a major drawback: reduced pump efficiency. The work that is done on the fluid that is throttled back to suction through the balance line is lost and acts to reduce the useful work done by the pump. While this was an acceptable compromise in the 1950 s, {{it is now a}} true waste of very expensive electrical power. The modern solution to this problem is to eliminate the balance line and apply a correctly specified mechanical seal to the high pressure side of the pump. This paper serves to show that, with careful consideration of the effects of balance line removal, pump life can be maintained and efficiency gained...|$|E
40|$|The {{use of a}} new {{generation}} of blood oxygenator design using plastic fibers for the heat exchange material is growing. The benefits of a plastic heat exchange material are improved biocompatibility and performance over some of the traditional metals used. During the initial period of clinical use of one of these new oxygenators, there were reports of four blood-to-water leaks. No patient complications were associated with these leaks, but the product was withdrawn from the market. After a thorough evaluation, the cause of the leaks was found to be an electrostatic discharge that occurred within the heat exchanger during priming of the extracorporeal circuit. It was found that an electrostatic potential between the blood path and the water path of the heat exchanger is generated as the prime solution is recirculated by a roller pump with polyvinyl chloride (PVC) pumphead tubing. The magnitude of the potential generated was found to vary with the make and model of the roller pump. If this voltage exceeds the dielectric strength of the fiber, a discharge through the wall of a single heat exchange fiber will occur and produce a hole. Several solutions to this problem of roller pumps generating an electrostatic charge when used with PVC pumphead tubing were identified. Centrifugal blood pumps and roller pumps using silicone rubber pumphead tubing were found to generate no significant electrostatic potential between the blood path and the water path. Another solution, a charge <b>equalization</b> <b>line</b> (CEL), was designed to provide a conductive path for the charge t...|$|E

40|$|Abstract — Wireline signal {{processing}} circuits such as transversal equalizers rely on true time delay. An active analog delay stage is proposed {{that requires a}} sixteenth of the area of a comparable LC delay line. A delay reference loop is also presented to tune the delay stage against process, voltage, and temperature variations. A reference signal is introduced to tune the delay. The impact of non-idealities must be considered to {{understand the relationship between}} the reference frequency and the locked time delay. A SiGe BiCMOS implementation of the active analog delay stage and delay reference loop is presented that operates to 10 Gb/s. Index Terms — delay reference loop, delay locked loop, true time delay, analog delay, <b>equalization,</b> tapped-delay <b>lines</b> Accurate delay requires robustness to process, voltage, and temperature (PVT) variations. Proper delay tuning is achieved with a delay reference loop (DRL). The DRL employs a reference frequency to stabilize the time delay. This reference frequency might come from an off-chip source or the locally regenerated clock {{in the case of an}} equalizer. As opposed to delay-locked loops that shift the delay to align an unknown signal, the DRL adjusts the delay to a given reference tone. However, the relationship between the locked delay and the reference frequency is influenced by circuit non-idealities. I...|$|R
40|$|Abstract – Noise is an {{indispensable}} part in signal processing that we encounter every day. The study of reducing noise {{arises from the}} need to achieve stronger signal to noise ratios. It is any unwanted disturbance that hampers the desired response while keeping the source sound. The different sources may include speech, music played through a device such as a mobile, IPod, computer, or no sound at all. Active noise cancellation involves creating a supplementary signal that DE constructively interferes with the output ambient noise. The cancellation of noise can be efficiently accomplished by using adaptive algorithms. An adaptive filter is one that self-adjusts the coefficients of transfer function according to an algorithm driven by an error signal. The adaptive filter uses {{feedback in the form}} of an error signal to define its transfer function to match changing parameters. The adaptive filtering techniques can be used for a wide range of applications, including echo cancellation, adaptive channel <b>equalization,</b> adaptive <b>line</b> enhancer, and adaptive beam forming. In last few years, a lot of algorithms have been developed for eradicating the distortion from the signals. This paper presents analysis of two algorithms namely, Least Mean Square (LMS), Normalized Least Mean Square (NLMS) and gives comparative study on various governing factors such as stability, computational complexity, filter order, robustness and rate of convergence. It further represents the effect of error with alteration in amplitude of noise signal fixating reference signal and desired signal. The algorithms are developed in MATLA...|$|R

Intelligent modems provide automatic <b>line</b> <b>equalization,</b> transmission link diagnostics, and loopback testing. A microprocessor at the remote stations periodically refreshes the seismometer system gain settings to ensure data accuracy.

40|$|International Telemetering Conference Proceedings / October 14 - 16, 1975 / Sheraton Inn, Silver Spring, MarylandThe analog {{memory device}} is a {{combination}} of a bipolar and a MOSFET device which stores information in analog form for several hours or more with no degradation of data. The emitter base junction of a bipolar transistor is covered with an SiO₂ layer and a voltage is applied to this point. With zero volts applied, the unit acts as a bipolar transistor. Increasing the voltage at this point increases the emitter injection efficiency of the bipolar transistor, which in turn increases the current gain of the device. An SiO₂ layer with no leakage paths can retain the charge applied to it for long periods of time; thus the gain will remain at this level as long as the charge remains on the oxide layer. A large number of such devices can be fabricated on a single chip. Such devices combined with other integrated circuits can be used, for example, for automatic <b>equalization</b> of transmission <b>lines,</b> echo suppression, and correlation detection...|$|R

40|$|A {{local loop}} {{of a public}} {{switched}} telephone network (PSTN) has 3 kHz bandwidth, which is insufficient for high-speed data transmission. Nevertheless, for traditional network operators, it has become of great interest to research on copper loops in view of aggressive competition with cable operators. Adaptive <b>line</b> <b>equalization</b> in time and frequency domains, are focus of research in developing digital subscriber loop (DSL) modems that effectively use existing copper. It is known that inter - symbol interference (ISI), inter - carrier interference (ICI), and additive white Gaussian noise (AWGN) are major problems that limit the performance of fast DSL, such as very high - speed DSL (VDSL), modems [3]. As a research on this problem, we present an adaptive linear transversal filter frequency domain equalizer for the audio band using the Widrow least mean square (LMS) algorithm (cf. [4][5]). We developed model for a typical local loop from transmission line characteristics and derived the adaptive equalizer that undo the effect of ISI and AWGN. The work is found to have laid the foundation for further endeavors on combating the effect of ISI, ICI, and AWGN in multi - tone signaling in copper loops...|$|R
40|$|Abstract—The per-tone {{equalizer}} (PTEQ) {{has been}} presented as an attractive alternative for the classical time-domain equalizer (TEQ) in discrete multitone (DMT) based systems, such as ADSL systems. The PTEQ {{is based on a}} linear minimum meansquare-error (L-MMSE) equalizer design for each separate tone. In this paper, we reconsider DMT modulation and equalization in the ADSL context under the realistic assumption of an infinite impulse response (IIR) model for the wireline channel. First, optimum linear zero-forcing (L-ZF) block equalizers for arbitrary IIR model orders and cyclic prefix (CP) lengths are developed. It is shown that these L-ZF block equalizers can be decoupled per tone, hence they lead to an L-ZF PTEQ. Then, based on the L-ZF PTEQ, lowcomplexity L-MMSE PTEQ extensions are developed: the linear PTEQ extension exploits frequency-domain transmit redundancy from pilot and unused tones; alternatively, a closely related decision-feedback PTEQ extension can be applied. The PTEQ extensions then add flexibility to a DMT-based system design: the CP overhead can be reduced by exploiting frequency-domain transmit redundancy instead, so that a similar bitrate as with the original PTEQ is achieved at a lower memory and computational cost or, alternatively, a higher bitrate is achieved without a considerable cost increase. Both PTEQ extensions are also shown to improve the receiver’s robustness to narrow-band interference.

A substantial part {{is focused on}} the mathematical description of distribution network using the method, which uses chain parameter matrices describing the relation between input and output voltage and current of the twoport network. This method is used for modeling sample power line topology. Furthermore, taps length and taps impedance influence on the transfer functions for different topology are examined. In this thesis, a decision–directed method is proposed for channel estimation and <b>equalization</b> in Power <b>line</b> communication (PLC) based on orthogonal frequency division multiplexing (OFDM). This method does not require a priori knowledge on the power line. Simulations on a realistic indoor power-line system show that the method achieves very good channel estimation and equalization performances and that it is robust to impulsive noise and nonlinearities. Later multilayer perceptron (MLP) based algorithm called back propagation algorithm has been proposed in power line communication. The present method (back propagation algorithm) is a OFDM based model which exploited for the channel estimation. Simulations on a realistic indoor power-line system show that the results obtained from the channel estimation using present model are significantly improved when compared with competitive neural network.

40|$|International Telemetering Conference Proceedings / October 18 - 20, 1966 / Ambassador Hotel, Los Angeles, CaliforniaThe {{hardware}} and theory of a multi-threshold bit decision technique called Quarternary Decision Logic are described. Quartenary Bit Decision Logic results in two simultaneous decisions on each received {{bit of a}} binary digital transmission: (1) a binary status decision; and, (2) a reliability decision which reflects on the presence/absence of multilation in the bit. Both decisions {{are based on a}} Shannon Integration of the received information over the whole bit interval. The ability to assess bit mutilation is then used to develop adjustable security-enforcing restraints on error correction and the receiving process itself. These restraints are developed by a Word Security Logic which keeps a "mutilation count" on each received word, The "mutilation count" per word results in a "Correction Permit/Inhibit" and a "Receiving Permit/Inhibit" output on each word. The "Correction Permit/ Inhibit" output bars error correction when the risk of a spurious correction is high. The "Receiving Permit/Inhibit” output blocks receiving when the risk of a direct evasion of security is high. The improvement in bit decision security and the improvements in security against spurious correction and direct evasions of Error detection are evaluated quantitatively in comparison to conventional single-threshold techniques, These improvements enable secure operation with lower redundancy coding systems because of the information gain which Quarternary Decision Logic provides. The possible contributions of Quarternary Decision Logic to self-adaptive data transmission systems and to automatic <b>line</b> <b>equalization</b> are explored in the section entitled "Conclusions"...|$|R
