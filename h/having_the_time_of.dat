500|$|Neil McCormick of The Telegraph {{classified}} {{the track}} as [...] "equating clumsiness with bumping and grinding sex," [...] where [...] " [...] switches {{back and forth}} between the two approaches so frequently that it almost sound like a duet between sweet and tough alter egos." [...] The National Si Hawkins confessed that [...] "Clumsy" [...] is [...] "a return to quirky form," [...] while John Murphy of musicOMH emphasized that the song was an [...] "undoubted highlight". Jonathan Riggs, penning for Idolator, opined that [...] "although none of the more manic moments match the frenzied brilliance of 'Toxic' (but what could, really?), Britney keeps control of the pulsating 'Clumsy'." [...] While noting that [...] "Britney holds her own on the sexually charged 'Clumsy'," [...] Sal Cinquemani of Slant Magazine suggested that Christina Aguilera would match better with the recording. Entertainment Weekly Nolan Feeney observed that [...] "the generic bass drop" [...] of the track is a [...] "missed opportunity." [...] Alex Macpherson of The Guardian was largely positive towards [...] "Clumsy", mentioning that it [...] "brings out grinding, Justice-style metallic synths, verses that jitter and hop uncontrollably, beery chants and an absurd moment when Spears' voice gets pitch-shifted thither and yon. But if much of her post-Blackout work seems to have had an absence of character as its end goal, [...] Spears sounds like she’s <b>having</b> <b>the</b> <b>time</b> <b>of</b> her life sparring with and riding the kitchen-sink beat.|$|E
500|$|RCA Victor {{released}} Presley's eponymous {{debut album}} on March 23. Joined by five previously unreleased Sun recordings, its seven recently recorded tracks {{were of a}} broad variety. There were two country songs and a bouncy pop tune. The others would centrally define the evolving sound of rock and roll: [...] "Blue Suede Shoes"—"an improvement over Perkins' in almost every way", according to critic Robert Hilburn—and three R numbers that {{had been part of}} Presley's stage repertoire for some time, covers of Little Richard, Ray Charles, and The Drifters. As described by Hilburn, these [...] "were the most revealing of all. Unlike many white artists... who watered down the gritty edges of the original R versions of songs in the '50s, Presley reshaped them. He not only injected the tunes with his own vocal character but also made guitar, not piano, the lead instrument in all three cases." [...] It became the first rock-and-roll album to top the Billboard chart, a position it held for 10 weeks. While Presley was not an innovative guitarist like Moore or contemporary African American rockers Bo Diddley and Chuck Berry, cultural historian Gilbert B. Rodman argues that the album's cover image, [...] "of Elvis <b>having</b> <b>the</b> <b>time</b> <b>of</b> his life on stage with a guitar in his hands {{played a crucial role in}} positioning the guitar... as the instrument that best captured the style and spirit of this new music." ...|$|E
500|$|The {{song was}} one of the most well {{received}} on the album. Mikael Wood of Entertainment Weekly said [...] "Bieber's better on [...] "Love Me", where he riffs on the Cardigans' [...] "Lovefool" [...] atop a killer electro-glam groove." [...] Mark Hirsh The Boston Globe, which {{was one of}} the few reviewers that gave the album a mixed analysis, said that [...] "Love Me" [...] was the essential song on the set. Washington Post also cited the song as one of the album's best, referring to it as a [...] "modest club track." [...] The New York Times said the track is [...] "probably the only release in recent memory that owes debts to both the Cardigans." [...] Mike Diver of BBC Music called the song an [...] "electro-infused reinterpretation of The Cardigans' Lovefool, where Bieber exhibits the right kind of attitude, playful and endearing." [...] Diver preferred Bieber in the song and wanted more of [...] "the cheeky chap rightfully <b>having</b> <b>the</b> <b>time</b> <b>of</b> his young life", rather than the [...] "adolescent playboy". [...] "Love Me" [...] had debuted on the Canadian Hot 100 and Billboard Hot 100 at twelve and thirty-seven. It spent twelve non-consecutive weeks on the Canadian chart and four in the United States. On the week ending January 10, 2010, [...] "Love Me" [...] entered the UK Singles Chart at eighty-two, and later peaked at seventy-one. It also debuted and peaked on the UK R chart at twenty-three, remaining on the chart for three weeks. It debuted and peaked in Australia at 100.|$|E

500|$|The factory {{supervisor}} belatedly {{realizes that}} the gender disparity is impairing morale and productivity, so he arranges for an army officer to organize military maneuvers near the town {{in order for the}} factory to sponsor a big dance, at which the workers can find male companionship among the soldiery. [...] "They need what we needed when we were young", he explains to a sympathetic officer. Anticipation runs high on both sides, with the girls expecting to meet the young men of their dreams, while the recruits, many of whom are actually middle-aged reservists, out-of-shape and already married, look forward to a night of revelry and seduction. The night of the party is a disappointment for some members of both groups; Andula and her friends are repulsed by the unappealing soldiers, whom they call [...] "old buffers", and a trio of reservists are so nonplussed by the situation that they commit a series of comic faux pas, like sending a bottle of wine to the wrong table and dropping a wedding ring that one of them is trying to hide, only to watch it roll across the floor and land {{at the feet of the}} young women who are the objects of their lust. [...] For these people, the mixer is a huge flop, with the girls retiring to the lavatory to devise a way to escape their pursuers and the aging reservists arguing with each other over expenses (one points out that [...] "you can only get it [...] free at home") and speculating on the necessity of going to the woods in order to consummate their romantic plans ("Imagine, in this weather!"). For others, however, the dance is a success: the factory supervisor looks on in smug satisfaction as couples throng the crowded dance floor, one girl holds her hands together in a gesture showing her delight and gratitude when she is asked to dance, while an obese, balding soldier capers with a mismatched tall, thin brunette, both clearly <b>having</b> <b>the</b> <b>time</b> <b>of</b> their lives.|$|E
500|$|Opinions {{about the}} song have been mixed. AllMusic critic Thomas Ward calls it [...] "one {{of the great}} good-time songs in Dylan's canon". Ward {{comments}} that [...] "Dylan sings it {{as if he is}} <b>having</b> <b>the</b> <b>time</b> <b>of</b> his life", adding that [...] "rarely has he sung with such expressiveness". Anthony Varesi, author of The Bob Dylan Albums, similarly praises the song's [...] "breadth of feeling" [...] and [...] "unparalleled expressiveness", noting that [...] "it appears Dylan simply improvised the song on the spot, and the passion within him allows the song to flow forth naturally". Biographer John Nagowski has described the song as [...] "delightful", while a New York Times review rates it {{one of the highlights of}} Volume 2 of The Bootleg Series Volumes 1–3, commenting that it is one of only a couple of mid-60s songs on the compilation that [...] "live up to their vintage". Griffin describes it as [...] "catchy but slight" [...] and [...] "a slight if charming little ditty", but criticizes the decision to include it on The Bootleg Series Volumes 1–3 rather than the [...] "masterpiece" [...] composition [...] "Sign on the Cross". Heylin concurs, characterizing [...] "Santa-Fe" [...] in 1995 as a [...] "pleasant enough throwaway" [...] but suggesting that [...] "Sign on the Cross" [...] or another 1967 composition, [...] "I'm Not There", would have been much better choices ("I'm Not There" [...] was eventually released in 2007 on the I'm Not There soundtrack, and both it and [...] "Sign on the Cross" [...] were included on The Basement Tapes Raw and The Basement Tapes Complete in 2014). By 2009, Heylin's opinion had changed little and he writes that [...] "of all the 'missing' basement-tape originals that appear on that three-CD set, 'Santa Fe' hardly represented an A-list candidate. Just another discarded ditty, it relies on the usual wordplay and slurred diction to obscure any pretense to a deeper meaning". Marcus dismisses it as no more than [...] "a riff", while a review in Stereophile magazine calls it [...] "the most lightweight tune on all three CDs, with indecipherable lyrics". Author Peter James, referring to Dylan and the Band's Woodstock output, writes that [...] "many great songs were written and recorded in [...] basement in 1967, unfortunately 'Sante-Fe' is not one of them." [...] He goes on to describe the song's inclusion on The Bootleg Series Volumes 1–3 as [...] "little more than a joke".|$|E
2500|$|The Best Damn Thing {{garnered}} generally positive {{reviews from}} music critics. Stephen Thomas Erlewine of Allmusic gave the album 4.5 out of 5 stars, {{stating that the}} album [...] "feels even more adolescent than her aggressively catchy-n-shallow debut, 'Let Go', perhaps {{because this is an}} album where Avril is allowed to run wild," [...] calling it [...] "as exuberant, irreverent, and exciting as any other bubblegum pop, defiantly silly and shallow, but also deliriously hooky." [...] Alex Macpherson of The Guardian gave the album 4 out of 5 stars, calling it [...] "a triumphant comeback", describing it as [...] "a high-octane blast on which she is <b>having</b> <b>the</b> <b>time</b> <b>of</b> her life." [...] Alex Nunn of musicOMH called it [...] "a fun, engaging record", [...] "an exuberantly fun album, one that packs more than a fair punch and puts a delightfully perky twist on the direction of former releases 'Let Go' and Under My Skin." ...|$|E

After the first concert {{of the tour}} Sebastian spoke to Stuart Bocking from radio station 2UE about {{what it felt like}} to be on stage with the MGs, [...] "There were so many moments when I just had to take a step back and think 'This is unbelievable'. Like the history that is behind me, and I'm singing these songs. You know they start playing Dock Of The Bay, and the guys that played it are on the stage. You know the guy who wrote the song with Otis Redding is playing guitar. The same with Midnight Hour and Knock on Wood. All these songs that I keep starting. These guys played on the original and wrote the songs, and were the sound that created them."
