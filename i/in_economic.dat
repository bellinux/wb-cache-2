The increase in demand for one industry will lead to an increase in demand for another industry due to complementarity of demands. As Say's Law states, supply creates its own demand.|$|E

40|$|We {{find that}} Australian mutual fund investors should avoid high fee funds as these funds {{generate}} relatively low after-fee risk-adjusted returns both unconditionally and <b>in</b> weak <b>economic</b> conditions. This result {{is different from}} some of the previous findings which showed that US mutual funds with relatively high expense ratios may generate relatively higher risk-adjusted returns during recessions relative to non-recessions, although their unconditional alphas may be negative. We find some support for the Glode hypothesis in surviving Australian wholesale funds. High-fee surviving Australian wholesale funds perform relatively strongly <b>in</b> both weak <b>economic</b> conditions and unconditionally. High-fee funds in other types of Australian mutual funds generally do not perform strongly either <b>in</b> weak <b>economic</b> conditions or unconditionally. Amongst low-fee funds, we commonly find that those that perform well unconditionally and well <b>in</b> weak <b>economic</b> conditions do charge more than those that perform well unconditionally and poorly <b>in</b> weak <b>economic</b> conditions. Amongst low-fee funds, it is often true that those that perform poorly unconditionally but well <b>in</b> weak <b>economic</b> conditions can charge more than those that perform poorly unconditionally and poorly <b>in</b> weak <b>economic</b> conditions.

40|$|Economic status {{played an}} {{important}} role in the modulation of economic decision making. The present fMRI study aimed at investigating how economic status modulated behavioral and neural responses to unfairness in a modified Ultimatum Game (UG). During scanning, participants played as responders in the UG, and they were informed of the economic status of proposers before receiving offers. At the behavioral level, higher rejection rates and lower fairness ratings were revealed when proposers were <b>in</b> high <b>economic</b> status than <b>in</b> low <b>economic</b> status. Besides, the most time-consuming decisions tended to occur at lower unfairness level when the proposers were in high (relative to low) economic status. At the neural level, stronger activation of left thalamus was revealed when fair offers were proposed by proposers in high rather than <b>in</b> low <b>economic</b> status. Greater activation of right medial prefrontal cortex was revealed during acceptance to unfair offers <b>in</b> high <b>economic</b> status condition rather than <b>in</b> low <b>economic</b> status condition. Taken together, these findings shed light on the significance of proposers’ <b>economic</b> status <b>in</b> responders’ social decision making in UG...|$|R
