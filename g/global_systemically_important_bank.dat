In order to get a deep understanding of the internationalisation process of banks we applied a qualitative research method. To enable the aimed comparison of two different banks a multiple case design, involving Deutsche Bank AG and DNB ASA, was applied. The empirical results demonstrate that the main motive for internationalisation for both case companies was to follow their clients. Additionally, both case companies entered retail banking in different markets through acquisitions, because retail banking requires an extensive branch network and access to a wide customer base. The results also show that the G-SIB displays a higher degree of market commitment in comparison to the small to medium sized bank. In contrast to the G-SIB the small to medium sized bank developed knowledge internally and was not as active in acquisitions. ...|$|E

While reduced interconnectedness decreases welfare by restricting the ability of banks to insure against liquidity shocks, it also increases it by reducing contagion when an interconnected bank fails.

40|$|This study employs bank-level {{data for}} a global sample to examine the {{relationship}} between capital and profitability over 2000 - 2013. Our evidence suggests that bank capital is positively related to bank profitability, although the estimated impact is relatively marginal. However, more capitalised banks that are more profitable appear to have a higher traditional risk, a greater proportion of non-traditional activities in their balance sheets and they tend to be more effective at controlling their costs. The relationship depends on environmental conditions as well and bank size. It is typically stronger in crisis periods, in lower and middle income countries and for larger banks (but not for <b>Global</b> <b>Systemically</b> <b>Important</b> <b>Banks,</b> or GSIBs). Finally, for banks operating in less restricted, more unstable and corrupt environments, the same increase in capital is associated with more profitable institutions than banks operating in countries with lower corruption levels.

40|$|This paper {{provides}} {{evidence on}} how the new international regulation on <b>Global</b> <b>Systemically</b> <b>Important</b> <b>Banks</b> (G-SIBs) impacts {{the market value of}} large banks. We analyze the stock price reactions for the 300 largest banks from 52 countries across 12 relevant regulatory announcement and designation events. We observe that the new regulation negatively affects the value of the newly regulated banks, yet that the official designation of banks as “globally systemically important” itself has a partly offsetting positive impact. A cross-sectional analysis of the valuation effects with respect to, for example, government ownership of banks supports the view that the positive reaction to these designations can be attributed to a Too-Big-to-Fail (TBTF) perception by investors. The fact that these valuation effects emerge from a regulation specifically designed to reduce the costs and risks of Too-Big-to-Fail demonstrates the inherently paradoxical nature of the new regulation. These results further suggest that even though the individual components of the regulation have been effective, revealing the identities of G-SIBs eliminated ambiguity about the presence of government guarantees, and thereby may have run counter to the regulators’ intent to contain the effects of TBTF. status: publishe...|$|R
40|$|We {{propose a}} credit risk {{approach}} in which financial institutions, modelled as {{a portfolio of}} risky assets characterized by a probability of default and a correlation matrix, are the nodes of a network whose links are credit exposures that would be partially lost in case of neighbours' default. The systemic risk of the network is {{described in terms of}} the loss distribution over time obtained with a multi-period Montecarlo simulation process, during which the nodes can default, triggering a change in the probability of default in their neighbourhood as a contagion mechanism. In particular, we have considered the expected loss and introduced new measures of network stress called PDImpact and PDRank. They are expressed in monetary terms as the already known DebtRank and can be used to assess the importance of a node in the network. The model exhibits two regimes of 'weak' and 'strong' contagion, the latter characterized by the depletion of the loss distribution at intermediate losses in favour of fatter tails. Also, in systems with strong contagion, low average correlation between nodes corresponds to larger losses. This seems at odds with the diversification benefit obtained in standard credit risk models. Results suggest that the credit exposure network of the European <b>global</b> <b>systemically</b> <b>important</b> <b>banks</b> is in a weak contagion regime, but strong contagion could be approached in periods characterized by extreme volatility or in cases where the financial institutions are not adequately capitalized.

40|$|Financial market {{infrastructures}} (FMIs) are {{the backbone}} of the financial system, enabling market participants to transact with one another in an efficient manner. If an FMI were to cease operation, it could put a stop to payments and/or securities and derivatives transactions, which in turn could destabilise financial markets and possibly the economy at large. Given their systemic importance, policy-makers have recently turned their attention to FMIs and particularly {{to the question of how}} to respond when trouble arises in central counterparties (CCPs). The European Commission is expected to release a proposal on this subject very soon, but market participants are concerned that this proposal will further increase the requirements already set out in the rules on market infrastructures contained in EMIR. This new interim report by the CEPS Task Force on Implementing Financial Sector Resolution welcomes international efforts to devise guidelines to ensure that FMIs are resolvable, i. e. acknowledging that any FMI can fail, but if an FMI fails, critical operations will continue to be performed. The report argues that European rules in this area should focus on facilitating coordination between supervisors and encouraging restraint on the part of authorities from taking precipitous action. At the same time, however, it calls on supervisors to exercise strong vigilance to identify and remove obstacles to the resolution of an FMI if and when necessary. The latter should also ensure that the loss allocation (‘waterfall’) process, especially in a CCP, can be completed, if necessary, over a ‘resolution weekend’, and that the default fund can be replenished. According to the Task Force Chairman, Thomas Huertas: "Resolution of one FMI could impact all G-SIBs (<b>global</b> <b>systemically</b> <b>important</b> <b>banks),</b> other FMIs and the markets at large. Consequently, coordination is critical, not only within the EU but also between the EU and third countries, especially the United States. " The Task Force put forward three other recommendations for the resolution process of FMIs. First, FMIs should provide adequate time to a G-SIB in resolution to allow it to meet its obligations towards them. Second, and at the same time, FMIs should be given sufficient time for recovery. And finally, they should be prepared for potential resolution in a worst-case scenario. The report concludes: "Taken together, these recommendations would go a very long way towards ensuring that FMIs could continue to operate, even under extremely adverse circumstances. That in turn would make a significant contribution to financial stability.

40|$|The Basel III Leverage Ratio, as {{originally}} agreed upon in December 2010, has recently undergone revisions and updates – both {{in relation to}} those proposed by the Basel Committee on Banking Supervision – as well as proposals introduced in the United States. Whilst recent proposals have been introduced by the Basel Committee to improve, particularly, the denominator component of the Leverage Ratio, new requirements have been introduced in the U. S to upgrade and increase these ratios, and it is those updates which relate to the Basel III Supplementary Leverage Ratio that have primarily generated a lot of interests. This is attributed not only to concerns that many subsidiaries of US Bank Holding Companies (BHCs) will find it cumbersome to meet such requirements, but also to potential or possible increases in regulatory capital arbitrage: a phenomenon which plagued {{the era of the}} original 1988 Basel Capital Accord and which also partially provided impetus for the introduction of Basel II. This paper is aimed at providing an analysis of the recent updates which have taken place in respect of the Basel III Leverage Ratio and the Basel III Supplementary Leverage Ratio – both in respect of recent amendments introduced by the Basel Committee and proposals introduced in the United States. It will also consider the consequences – as well as the impact - which the U. S Leverage ratios could have on Basel III. There are ongoing debates in relation to revision by the Basel Committee, as well as the most recent U. S proposals to update Basel III Leverage ratios and whilst these revisions have been welcomed to a large extent, in view of the need to address Tier One capital requirements and exposure criteria, there is every likelihood, indication, as well as tendency that many <b>global</b> <b>systemically</b> <b>important</b> <b>banks</b> (GSIBS), and particularly their subsidiaries, will resort to capital arbitrage. What {{is likely to be the}} impact of the recent proposals in the U. S. ? The recent U.

This paper also adopts the approach of evaluating the causes and consequences of the most recent updates by the Basel Committee, as well as those revisions which have taken place in the U. S, by attempting to balance the merits of the respective legislative updates and proposals. The value of adopting leverage ratios as a supplementary regulatory tool will also be illustrated by way of reference to the impact of the recent legislative changes on risk taking activities, as well as the need to also supplement capital adequacy requirements with the Basel Leverage ratios and the Basel liquidity standard...|$|R
40|$|A {{primary goal}} of the Dodd-Frank Act is to end “too big to fail” (TBTF) bailouts for <b>systemically</b> <b>important</b> {{financial}} institutions (SIFIs) and their creditors. Title II of Dodd-Frank establishes the Orderly Liquidation Authority (OLA), which empowers the Secretary of the Treasury to appoint the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation (FDIC) as receiver for failed SIFIs. Title II requires the FDIC to liquidate failed SIFIs and to impose any resulting losses on their shareholders and creditors. Title II establishes a liquidation-only mandate because Congress did not want a failed megabank to emerge from an OLA receivership as a “rehabilitated” SIFI. The FDIC recognized Title II’s liquidation-only mandate in its early rulemakings under Dodd-Frank. However, megabanks quickly realized that a liquidation-only approach for resolving failed SIFIs would pose {{a major threat to}} their TBTF subsidy and would create a clear risk of imposing losses on their Wall Street creditors, including holders of commercial paper and securities repurchase agreements (repos). Accordingly, in 2011 Wall Street interests proposed a very different approach for resolving failed SIFIs. This new approach, called “recapitalization-within-resolution,” created a roadmap for resolving failed megabanks by using Chapter 11 -style reorganizations instead of liquidations. Wall Street’s reorganization plan helped to provide the conceptual foundation for the “single point of entry” (SPOE) resolution strategy. As described in the first section of this article, the SPOE strategy would place only the parent holding company of a failed megabank into an OLA receivership and would impose losses only on the holding company 2 ̆ 7 s shareholders and debtholders. Under SPOE, the operating subsidiaries of a failed SIFI (including banks, securities broker-dealers, swap dealers, and insurance companies) would remain in business, and all of the creditors of those subsidiaries (including Wall Street creditors) would be fully protected. Wall Street enthusiastically supports the SPOE concept, but the FDIC has not yet formally endorsed SPOE as its preferred strategy for resolving failed SIFIs under Title II of Dodd-Frank. As explained in the second section of this article, the Federal Reserve Board (Fed) recently proposed a new “total loss-absorbing capacity” (TLAC) requirement. The proposed TLAC requirement would apply to eight U. S. megabanks, which are currently designated as <b>global</b> <b>systemically</b> <b>important</b> <b>banks</b> (G-SIBs), as well as U. S. intermediate holding companies owned by foreign G-SIBs. The Fed’s proposal would require the parent holding company of each G-SIB to maintain a minimum level of Tier 1 shareholders’ equity and TLAC debt. If the parent holding company is placed in an OLA receivership, an SPOE resolution would follow and the parent company’s equity and TLAC debt would be written off to help recapitalize the G-SIB’s operating subsidiaries. The Fed’s TLAC proposal is expressly designed to establish SPOE as the preferred strategy for resolving failed U. S. megabanks. As shown in the third section of this article, most TLAC debtholders would probably be retail investors in mutual funds and pension funds, because federal regulators would strongly discourage financial institutions from purchasing TLAC debt. In addition, if a failed G-SIB’s subsidiaries could not be recapitalized by writing off the holding company’s equity and TLAC debt, the FDIC as receiver would fill the remaining gap by obtaining a taxpayer-financed bridge loan from the Treasury Department. Thus, SPOE and TLAC would impose the costs of resolving failed megabanks on ordinary citizens, either as investors or taxpayers, while giving 100...|$|R
