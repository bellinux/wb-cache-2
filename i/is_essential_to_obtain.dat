To avoid injury and aid comfort {{it is important to}} make sure the bio-mechanical position of the rider is correct. Group cycling bikes have a wide range of adjustment, and it <b>is</b> <b>essential</b> <b>to</b> <b>obtain</b> the correct setup prior to riding. The seat position must be right for the participant's height. The height of the seat should be in level with the hip when the participant is standing next to the cycle. Horizontally, the seat should be set in order for the front of the knee to be directly in vertical line with the ball of the foot when the pedal is pointing forward. This results in a position where the knee is slightly bent at an angle between 25% and 35% when the leg is extended with the foot resting flat {{at the bottom of the}} pedal stroke. Handlebar height can be adjusted for comfort; less experienced riders may want to set them higher to ease lower back discomfort. A reasonable reference point is to set it in level with the seat.|$|E

Thus, resistant cultivars {{can play an}} important role in the control of this disease. To select genotypes resistant to B. tulipae, a reliable screening assay is needed. A greenhouse test was developed to establish resistance at clonal level. Removal of the wax layer by soft rubbing of the leaves <b>was</b> <b>essential</b> <b>to</b> <b>obtain</b> a homogeneous distribution of the spore suspension on the leaves. Small lesions were found within 24 hr after inoculation. Continuous leaf wetness was obtained by regular water evaporation.

Large differences in resistance were found within tulip genotypes. Feeding additions to the inoculum suspension enhanced the infection process, but were unnecessary. Plants inoculated before flowering were less sensitive to B. tulipae than plants inoculated at flowering. Plants inoculated after flowering were most sensitive to infection. Ranking of resistance for the tested genotypes before or after flowering however remained nearly the same.
