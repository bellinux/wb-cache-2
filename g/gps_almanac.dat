50|$|The <b>GPS</b> <b>almanac,</b> {{as part of}} {{the data}} {{transmitted}} by each GPS satellite, contains coarse orbit and status information for all satellites in the constellation, an ionospheric model, and information to relate GPS derived time to Coordinated Universal Time (UTC). Hence the <b>GPS</b> <b>almanac</b> provide a similar goal as the ancient Babylonian almanac, to find celestial bodies.|$|E
50|$|Standalone/self-ruling GPS devices depend {{solely on}} {{information}} from satellites. A-GPS augments that by using cell tower data to enhance quality and precision when in poor satellite signal conditions. In exceptionally poor signal conditions, {{for example in}} urban areas, satellite signals may exhibit multipath propagation where signals skip off structures, or are weakened by meteorological conditions or tree canopy. Some standalone GPS navigators used in poor conditions can't fix a position because of satellite signal fracture and must wait for better satellite reception. A GPS unit may need as long as 12.5 minutes (the time needed to download the <b>GPS</b> <b>almanac</b> and ephemerides) to resolve the problem {{and be able to}} provide a correct location.|$|E
40|$|NASA Goddard Space Flight Center (GSFC) is {{developing}} a new space-borne GPS receiver that can operate effectively in {{the full range of}} Earth orbiting missions from Low Earth Orbit (LEO) to geostationary and beyond. Navigator is designed to be a fully space flight qualified GPS receiver optimized for fast signal acquisition and weak signal tracking. The fast acquisition capabilities provide exceptional time to first fix performance (TIFF) with no a priori receiver state or <b>GPS</b> <b>almanac</b> information, even in the presence of high Doppler shifts present in LEO (or near perigee in highly eccentric orbits). The fast acquisition capability also makes it feasible to implement extended correlation intervals and therefore significantly reduce Navigator s acquisition threshold. This greatly improves GPS observability when the receiver is above the GPS constellation (and satellites must be tracked from {{the opposite side of the}} Earth) by providing at least 10 dB of increased acquisition sensitivity. Fast acquisition and weak signal tracking algorithms have been implemented and validated on a hardware development board. A fully functional version of the receiver, employing most of the flight parts, with integrated navigation software is expected by mid 2005. An ultimate goal of this project is to license the Navigator design to an industry partner who will then market the receiver as a commercial product...|$|E
40|$|The German micro-satellite BIRD will be {{equipped}} with an autonomous navigation system that provides real-time onboard orbit determination and prediction functions based on GPS position fixes. The navigation system design is presented together {{with a description of}} the algorithms required to achieve a position and velocity accuracy significantly better than the performance of the GPS position fixes. The BIRD onboard navigation system enhances the spacecraft autonomy as it enables {{for the first time a}} geocoding of satellite images on-the-flight. Accordingly, the post-processing and ground operations workload is reduced, that renders the system especially attractive for future highly autonomous satellite missions. An integral part of the BIRD Attitude and Orbit Control System is the Rockwell Collins GEM-S (GPS embedded Module) five channel C/A- and L 1 P-code receiver. GEM-S provides instantaneous position fixes that are treated as measurements within the onboard orbit determination and pediction process. The GPS receiver is efficiently commanded making extensive use of macro commands, that significantly reduce the uplink data volume. In addition, an onboard <b>GPS</b> <b>almanac</b> storage will allow for a time-to- first-fix of about 20 s, even from a receiver cold start. The autonomous navigation system is furthermore equipped with a backup onboard orbit predictor based on NORAD twoline elements to guarantee the availability of orbit positions even for failures of the GPS receiver or the orbit determination process...|$|E
40|$|GPS is {{nowadays}} {{the most}} important GNSS {{and the only one}} fully operational. Nowadays, this navigation system is becoming omnipresent in our society. Cars, vessels and airplanes include a GPS receiver to travel. The GPS receivers are also found on cellular phones and laptop computers. The IT GPS monitoring station is continuingly receiving data from GPS system. All this received data is acquired with the aim of being used to support the research and development of navigation algorithms. This data includes, among others, the orbital parameters (ephemerides), the <b>GPS</b> <b>almanac</b> and the satellite status. However, the monitoring station does not store permanently this data. The aim of this project is to implement a database application to store all these values. This database uses the MySQL technology. Firstly, a reader programs are create to read these parameters and send it to the database. Users can access to the database using a website. Using it, users can create and send queries to the database. The results of these queries are shown on the website or it can be downloaded on a file. Furthermore, the application supports the real-time upload of the database as well as the download of data. A backup system is implemented to protect the data. This system creates each week a file that contains all received data. The project involves the integration of several navigation, communication and computing equipment. The first part of this report includes a study of GPS to understand this navigation system and the parameters that are used. After this study, all the parts that compose this project are presented. These parts are: the data acquisition, the database and the website...|$|E
40|$|In {{order to}} {{estimate}} {{the influence of a}} change in one component of the GNSS it is necessary to model the whole system (satellite constellation, signal transmission, receiver, environment etc.) not just parts of it. In view of future GNSS's (e. g. ENSS, GNSS- 2), their design and development, it is very important {{to estimate the}}ir performance, before they are built. Thus an end-to-end simulation of a generic GNSS is of great importance for existing and future GNSS's. SNSS is a software tool for simulating GNSS systems (satellite orbits, signal structure etc.) with the corresponding receiver (user segment) in a virtual environment (buildings). The main components of SNSS are: Satellite orbit generator and editor, Environment and way point editors, Reflection model, Ray-tracer, Receiver, Position processor. The satellite orbit generator calculates the satellite orbits using the standard <b>GPS</b> <b>Almanac.</b> With the environment editor buildings in the form of boxes can be entered into the program and converted to WGS- 84 co-ordinates. Using the way point editor the path of a land vehicle in an urban area can be entered. The reflection model describes the reflection of the satellite signal off of the building surfaces. The model considers the material properties of the reflector as well as the incident angle and polarization state of the incoming ray. The ray-tracer analyses reflection of off the buildings are rendered for a given reflection depth. The receiver is based on a rigorous, dynamic, non-linear mathematical model for a generic GNSS receiver. Results from simulations for three different user segments; land, oceanic and airborne users are presented. (orig.)
