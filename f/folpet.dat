5000|$|Captan was {{previously}} cited as Group B2, a probable human carcinogen by the US Environmental Protection Agency (EPA), but was reclassified in 2004. Since {{the mode of}} action has been established as a proliferative response (in mice only) after intestinal villi are disrupted, captan has been deemed not likely to cause tumors at doses that do not irritate the intestine. The EPA now states, [...] "The new cancer classification considers captan to be a potential carcinogen at prolonged high doses that cause cytotoxicity and regenerative cell hyperplasia. These high doses of captan are many orders of magnitude above those likely to be consumed in the diet, or encountered by individuals in occupational or residential settings. Therefore, captan {{is not likely to}} be a human carcinogen nor pose cancer risks of concern when used in accordance with approved product labels. A similar reclassification has been made for <b>folpet,</b> captan's sister fungicide, which shares a common mechanism of toxicity. A key finding for captan (and <b>folpet)</b> is these fungicides are not mutagenic in vivo; that is, they are not mutagenic in the intact animal.|$|E

40|$|The fate of <b>folpet</b> {{from the}} {{treatment}} on vine {{to the production}} of wine was studied. Sunlight degraded <b>folpet</b> to unknown products. Phthalimide was a minor metabolite formed on grapes from <b>folpet.</b> <b>Folpet</b> degraded in must, giving 80 % phthalimide; the results obtained with model solutions showed that in must <b>folpet</b> can also give small amounts of phthalic acid.

Owing to their related molecular structures, <b>folpet</b> emitted similar products to captan but at different yields, under the same experimental conditions. It appears that the availability of easily abstractable H atoms, {{in the structure of}} captan but not in that of <b>folpet,</b> defines the product distribution.

40|$|Abstract Background Pesticides, in {{particular}} <b>folpet,</b> {{have been found}} in rural and urban air in France in the past few years. <b>Folpet</b> is a contact fungicide and has been widely used for the past 50 years in vineyards in France. Slightly water-soluble and mostly present as particles in the environment, it has been measured at average concentration of 40. 1 μg/m 3 during its spraying, 0. 16 – 1. 2 μg/m 3 in rural air and around 0. 01 μg/m 3 in urban air, potentially exposing both the workers and the general population. However, no study on its penetration by inhalation and on its respiratory toxicity has been published. The objective {{of this study was to}} determine the physicochemical characteristics of <b>folpet</b> particles (morphology, granulometry, stability) in its commercial forms under their typical application conditions. Moreover, the cytotoxic effect of these particles and the generation of reactive oxygen species were assessed in vitro on respiratory cells. Results Granulometry of two commercial forms of <b>folpet</b> (Folpan 80 WG ® and Myco 500 ®) under their typical application conditions showed that the majority of the particles (> 75 %) had a size under 5 μm, and therefore could be inhaled by humans. These particles were relatively stable over time: more than 75 % of <b>folpet</b> remained in the particle suspension after 30 days under the typical application conditions. The inhibitory concentration (IC 50) on human bronchial epithelial cells (16 HBE 14 o-) was found to be between 2. 89 and 5. 11 μg/cm 2 for <b>folpet</b> commercial products after 24 h of exposure. <b>Folpet</b> degradation products and vehicles of Folpan 80 WG ® did not show any cytotoxicity at tested concentrations. At non-cytotoxic and subtoxic concentrations, Folpan 80 WG ® was found to increase DCFH-DA fluorescence. Conclusion These results show that the particles of commercial forms of <b>folpet</b> are relatively stable over time. Particles could be easily inhaled by humans, could reach the conducting airways and are cytotoxic to respiratory cells in vitro. <b>Folpet</b> particles may mediate its toxicity directly or indirectly through ROS-mediated alterations. These data constitute the first step towards the risk assessment of <b>folpet</b> particles by inhalation for human health. This work confirms the need for further studies on the effect of environmental pesticides on the respiratory system. </p...|$|E
40|$|Abstract In Brazil, leaf abscission in {{apple trees}} can occur prematurely due to {{infection}} by Glomerella leaf spot (Colletotrichum gloeosporioides). The extent of leaf fall is correlated with ethylene production {{resulting from the}} reaction by the host to prevent the dissemination of the pathogen. The {{aim of this study}} was to verify the impact of the aminoethoxyivinylglycine (AVG) on the process of leaf abscission in plants exhibiting Glomerella leaf spot symptoms. The experiment was conducted in the spring of 2011 in ?Maxi Gala?/M 9 young apple trees (2 years old) in pots under greenhouse conditions at 22 ± 2 °C, with 80 ± 5 % relative humidity, (28 ° 30 ? 52 ?S and 50 ° 52 ? 58 ?W, 950 m). Plants without disease symptoms were artificially inoculated with C. gloeosporioides, and treatments were applied when the leaves had symptoms of infection. The experiment included 7 treatments with AVG and/or the fungicide <b>Folpet</b> (mg L- 1 active ingredient ? a. i.) as follows: AVG 60, AVG 150, AVG 30 + <b>Folpet</b> 120, AVG 45 + <b>Folpet</b> 120, AVG 60 + <b>Folpet</b> 120, AVG 150 + <b>Folpet</b> 120, <b>Folpet</b> 120 alone and the untreated control. Assessments of percentage defoliation were made weekly until 68 days after spraying (das). The results indicated that AVG in doses 60 and 150 mg L- 1 resulted in a reduced level of defoliation, compared with the fungicide treated trees, and abscission was equivalent to control at 21 das. After the disease is established and is not controlled by fungicide there was an increase in leaf abscission compared to the control. 201...|$|E
40|$|Degradation of {{xenobiotics}} by microbial populations is {{a potential}} method to enhance the effectiveness of ex situ or in situ bioremediation. The propose {{of this study was}} to evaluate the impact of repeated metalaxyl and <b>folpet</b> treatments on soil microbial communities and to select soil fungal strains able to degrade these fungicides. Results showed an enhanced degradation of metalaxyl and <b>folpet</b> in vineyards soils submitted at repeated treatments with these fungicides. Indeed, highest degradation ability was observed in vineyard soil samples submitted at higher number of treatments. Respiration activities, determined in the presence of selective antibiotics in soil suspensions amended with metalaxyl and <b>folpet,</b> showed that the fungal population was the microbiota community most active in the degradation process. Batch cultures performed with a progressive increase of fungicide concentrations allowed the selection of five tolerant fungal strains: Penicillium sp. 1 and Penicillium sp. 2, mycelia sterila 1 and 3, and Rhizopus stolonifer. Among these strains, mycelium sterila 3 and R. stolonifer, presented only in vineyards soils treated with repeated application of these fungicides, showed tolerance higher than 1000 mg l- 1 against a commercial formulations of metalaxyl (10 %) plus <b>folpet</b> (40 %). Using specific methods for inducing sporulation, mycelium sterila 3 was identified as Gongronella sp. Since this fungus is rare, it was compared by csM 13 -PCR with the two known species G. butleri and G. lacrispora. The high tolerance to metalaxyl and <b>folpet</b> demonstrated by Gongronella sp. and R. stolonifer might be correlated with their degradation ability. Our results point out that selected strains have potential for the bioremediation of metalaxyl and <b>folpet</b> in polluted soil sites...|$|E
40|$|The time {{courses of}} key {{biomarkers}} {{of exposure to}} captan and <b>folpet</b> was assessed in accessible biological matrices of orally exposed volunteers. Ten volunteers ingested 1 [*]mg kg(- 1) body weight of captan or <b>folpet.</b> Blood samples were withdrawn at fixed time periods over the 72 [*]h following ingestion and complete urine voids were collected over 96 [*]h post-dosing. The tetrahydrophthalimide (THPI) metabolite of captan along with the phthalimide (PI) and phthalic acid metabolites of <b>folpet</b> were then quantified in these samples. Plasma levels of THPI and PI increased progressively after ingestion, reaching peak values ~ 10 and 6 [*]h post-dosing, respectively; subsequent elimination phase appeared monophasic with a mean elimination half-life (t(½)) of 15. 7 and 31. 5 [*]h, respectively. In urine, elimination rate time courses of PI and phthalic acid evolved in parallel, with respective t(½) of 27. 3 and 27. 6 [*]h; relatively faster elimination was found for THPI, with mean t(½) of 11. 7 [*]h. However, phthalic acid was present in urine in 1000 -fold higher amounts than PI. In the 96 [*]h period post-treatment, on average 25 % of <b>folpet</b> dose was excreted in urine as phthalic acid as compared with only 0. 02 % as PI. The corresponding value for THPI was 3. 5 %. Overall, THPI and PI appear as interesting biomarkers of recent exposure, with relatively short half-lives; their sensitivity to assess exposure in field studies should be further verified. Although not a metabolite specific to <b>folpet,</b> the concomitant use of phthalic acid as a major biomarker of exposure to <b>folpet</b> should also be considered.

Phthalimide (PI), phthalamic acid (PAA), and phthalic acid (PA) are the ring metabolites of this fungicide according to animal studies, {{but they have not}} yet been measured in human urine as metabolites of <b>folpet,</b> only PA as a metabolite of phthalates. The objective of this study was thus to develop a reliable gas chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry (GC-MS) method to quantify the sum of PI, PAA, and PA ring-metabolites of <b>folpet</b> in human urine. Briefly, the method consisted of adding p-methylhippuric acid as an internal standard, performing an acid hydrolysis at 100  °C to convert ring-metabolites into PA, purifying samples by ethyl acetate extraction, and derivatizing with N,O-bis(trimethylsilyl) trifluoro acetamide prior to GC-MS analysis.

In order to accommodate for the intended uses of <b>folpet</b> on table grapes in Europe, the EMS proposed to raise the existing MRL in grapes to 3 mg/kg for <b>folpet</b> and to 5 mg/kg for <b>folpet</b> and phthalimide, expressed as <b>folpet.</b> The EMS drafted an evaluation report in {{accordance with}} Article 8 of Regulation (EC) No 396 / 2005, which was submitted to the European Commission and forwarded to EFSA.

40|$|<b>Folpet</b> {{is one of}} {{the most}} widely {{employed}} fungicides in agriculture. It is typically used in the culture of vegetables, fruits and ornamental plants. Once absorbed in the human body, it has been found to be very reactive, especially in acid conditions. According to various in vitro and in vivo experiments in animals, <b>Folpet</b> is first fractioned at the N-S link when in contact with aqueous solutions and thiol groups. From this non-enzymatic process a phthalimide (PI) molecule is formed, which may be used as a biomarker of exposure, along with the short-lived thiophosgene. We have built a human toxicokinetic model to account for the biotransformation of <b>Folpet</b> into PI and its subsequent excretion while accounting for other non-monitored metabolites. The mathematical parameters of the model were determined accordingly from best-fits to the time courses of PI in blood and urine of five volunteers administered orally 1 mg/kg and dermally 10 mg/kg of <b>Folpet.</b> In both cases, the mean elimination half-life of PI from the body (either through faeces, urine or metabolism) was found to be 31. 6 h. The average final fractions of administered dose recovered in urine as PI were 0. 025 % and 0. 002 %, for oral and dermal administration, respectively after 96 h. According to the model, when orally administered, PI rapidly hydrolyzes to phthalamic and phthalic acids such that only 0. 04 % of the PI found in the gastrointestinal tract is absorbed into the blood stream. Likewise, after dermal application, model predicts that only 7. 4 % of the applied <b>Folpet</b> dose crosses the epidermis. In the model, the PI initial metabolite of <b>Folpet</b> is formed in the dermis and further metabolized prior to reaching systemic circulation, such that only 0. 125 % of PI formed at the site-of-entry reaches systemic blood. Our mathematical model is in accordance with both measures of blood (R 2 = 0. 57 for dermal and R 2 = 0. 66 for oral) and urine (R 2 = 0. 98 for dermal and R 2 = 0. 99 for oral) ...|$|E

The extraction performance of four different SPME coatings, polydimethylsiloxane (PDMS), PDMS/divinylbenzene (PDMS/DVB), carbowax/templated resin (CW/TPR), and polyacrylate (PA) was evaluated using an interface SPME–HPLC.

40|$|Zymoseptoria tritici causes Septoria leaf blotch (SLB), {{the most}} {{important}} foliar disease in winter wheat in Northern Europe and the UK. Chemical control of Z. tritici has seen a continuous introduction and substitution of fungicides with distinct mode of actions, due {{to the development of}} fungicide resistance. Emergence of diverse resistance mechanisms and their fixation in field populations of Z. tritici represents a constant threat to the control of SLB by fungicides. The aim of this research was to determine the biological potential of Z. tritici to adapt to the multi-site inhibitors chlorothalonil and <b>folpet,</b> and the single-site succinate dehydrogenase inhibitor (SDHI) fluxapyroxad. In vitro microtitre plate based fungicide sensitivity assays indicated that there was evidence for reduced sensitivity to chlorothalonil or <b>folpet</b> in the Z. tritici field isolates tested. Field isolates obtained from plots treated with solo applications of chlorothalonil or <b>folpet</b> were less sensitive to the fungicides compared with isolates sampled from non-treated plots. No evidence was found for reduced sensitivity to fluxapyroxad in the same set of field isolates. RNA sequencing analysis of the genome-wide transcriptional response of the reference Z. tritici isolate IPO 323 after exposure to chlorothalonil or <b>folpet</b> in the lag and log phase of growth revealed a compound-specific “functional gene expression signature”. In addition, several genes encoding glutathione S-transferase (GST), ATP-binding cassette (ABC) or major facilitator superfamily (MFS) efflux pumps were significantly overexpressed in response to chlorothalonil or <b>folpet</b> exposure. In vitro evolutionary studies determined the course of evolution of resistance to the succinate dehydrogenase inhibitor (SDHI) fluxapyroxad in replicate populations of Z. tritici derived from the sensitive isolate IPO 323. Resistance to fluxapyroxad arose mainly through alterations in the target protein that also often conferred cross-resistance to other SDHIs (e. g. fluopyram and carboxin). Additionally, overexpression of an ABC transporter or a GST gene was associated with resistance to fluxapyroxad and lower sensitivity to fluopyram or carboxin in a mutant without target-site alteration. The frequency of six amino acid substitutions in the target protein subunits sdhB, sdhC or sdhD – determined by SNP pyrosequencing assays – indicated that evolution of resistance was driven by a successive substitution of fitter mutants carrying distinct amino acid substitutions as selection at increasing concentrations of fluxapyroxad continued...|$|E

40|$|ABSTRACT The {{indiscriminate}} {{use of pesticides}} on grape crops is harmful for consumers´ healthin “in natura” consumption and in the ingestion of wine and grape juice. During winemaking, a rapid and efficient fermentation stage is critical to avoid proliferation of contaminating microorganisms and to guarantee the product´s quality. Polymerase chain reaction (PCR) {{has the advantage of}} detecting these contaminants {{in the early stages of}} fermentation. However,this enzymatic reaction may also be susceptible to specific problems, reducing its efficiency. Agricultural practices, such as fungicide treatments, may be a source of PCR inhibiting factors and may also interfere in the normal course of fermentation. The action of the pesticides captan and <b>folpet</b> on PCR and on yeast metabolism was evaluated, once these phthalimide compounds are widely employed in Brazilian vineyards. DNA amplification was only observed at 75 and 37. 5 µg/mL of captan concentrations, whereas with <b>folpet,</b> amplification was observed only in the two lowest concentrations tested (42. 2 and 21. 1 µg/mL). Besides the strong inhibition on Taq polymerase activity, phthalimides also inhibited yeast metabolism at all concentrations analyzed. Grape must containing captan and <b>folpet</b> residues could not be transformed into wine due to stuck fermentation caused by the inhibition of yeast metabolism. Non-compliance with the waiting period for phthalimide fungicides may result in financial liabilities to the viticulture sector. The use of yeasts with high fungicide sensitivity should be selected for must fermentation as a strategy for sustainable wine production and to assure that products comply with health and food safety standards...|$|E

The mathematical parameters of the model were then determined from best fits to the time courses of PI and PAeq in blood and urine of five volunteers administered orally 1 mg kg(- 1) and dermally 10 mg kg(- 1) of <b>folpet.</b> In the case of oral administration, the mean elimination half-life of PI from blood (through feces, urine or metabolism) was found to be 39. 9 h as compared with 28. 0 h for PAeq. In the case of a dermal application, mean elimination half-life of PI and PAeq was estimated to be 34. 3 and 29. 3 h, respectively. The average final fractions of administered dose recovered in urine as PI over the 0 - 96 h period were 0. 030 and 0. 002 %, for oral and dermal exposure, respectively. Corresponding values for PAeq were 24. 5 and 1. 83 %, respectively. Finally, the average clearance rate of PI from blood calculated from the oral and dermal data was 0. 09 ± 0. 03 and 0. 13 ± 0. 05 ml h(- 1) while the volume of distribution was 4. 30 ± 1. 12 and 6. 05 ± 2. 22 l, respectively. It was not possible to obtain the corresponding values from PAeq data owing to the lack of blood time course data...|$|E
40|$|To better assess {{biomonitoring}} data in workers {{exposed to}} captan and <b>folpet,</b> the kinetics of ring metabolites [tetrahydrophthalimide (THPI), phthalimide (PI) and phthalic acid] were determined in urine and plasma of dermally exposed volunteers. A 10 [*] mg kg(- 1) dose of each fungicide was applied on 80 [*]cm(2) of the forearm and left without occlusion or washing for 24 [*]h. Blood samples were withdrawn at fixed time periods over the 72 [*] h following application and complete urine voids were collected over 96 [*]h post-dosing, for metabolite analysis. In the hours following treatment, a progressive increase in plasma levels of THPI and PI was observed, with peak levels being reached at 24 [*]h for THPI and 10 [*]h for PI. The ensuing elimination phase appeared monophasic {{with a mean}} elimination half-life (t(½)) of 24. 7 and 29. 7 [*]h for THPI and PI, respectively. In urine, time courses PI and phthalic acid excretion rate rapidly evolved in parallel, and a mean elimination t(½) of 28. 8 and 29. 6 [*]h, respectively, was calculated from these curves. THPI was eliminated slightly faster, with a mean t(½) of 18. 7 [*]h. Over the 96 [*] h period post-application, metabolites were almost completely excreted, and on average 0. 02 % of captan dose was recovered in urine as THPI while 1. 8 % of the <b>folpet</b> dose was excreted as phthalic acid and 0. 002 % as PI, suggesting a low dermal absorption fraction for both fungicides.

40|$|Two N-trihalomethylthio {{fungicides}} {{were detected}} in {{the atmosphere in the}} Lower Fraser Valley agricultural region of Canada. Captan was detected in both the particle and gas phase with a dominant particle phase fraction observed in both 2005 and 2006 (only total captan atmospheric concentrations were available for 2004). This provides the first evidence of particle transport as a significant atmospheric transport pathway for captan in an agricultural region in Canada. Weekly captan air concentrations reached maximum levels of 13. 2 ng m- 3 in June 2006, while for <b>folpet</b> total atmospheric levels were lower with maximum reaching 1. 7 ng m- 3 in August 2004 and generally < 1 ng m 3 in 2005 and 2006. <b>Folpet</b> is {{detected in the}} atmosphere although not previously reported in usage inventories. In the three years examined (2004 – 2006) captan concentrations observed a seasonal maximum in atmospheric concentrations during spring to early summer coinciding with expected peak usage period on crops in the Lower Fraser Valley agricultural region located in British Columbia, Canada.

40|$|International audienceThis paper {{presents}} a field-study of real pesticide application conditions in a vineyard. The {{objective was to}} measure the exposure, the transfer {{and the effects of}} pesticides on a non-target soil invertebrate, the land snail Helix aspersa. There was no drift of the herbicides (glyphosate and glufosinate) whereas the fungicides (cymoxanil, <b>folpet,</b> tebuconazole and pyraclostrobin) were detected up to 20 m from the treated area. For <b>folpet</b> and particularly tebuconazole, spray deposits on soil (corresponding to losses for the intended target i. e. the vine leaves) were high (41. 1 % and 88. 8 % loss of applied dose, respectively). For herbicides, the target was the soil and losses (percentage of compounds which did not reach the soil) were of 22 % for glufosinate and 52 % for glyphosate. In the study plot, glyphosate was transferred to and accumulated in snail tissues (4 mg kg− 1 dry weight, dw), as was its metabolite AMPA (8 mg kg− 1 dw) which could be in relation with the reduced growth observed in snails. No effects on snail survival or growth were found after exposure to the other organic compounds or to copper and sulphur-fungicides, although transfer of tebuconazole, pyraclostrobin and copper occurred.

40|$|Background: The {{panel of}} patch test allergens {{used for the}} {{evaluation}} of patients with suspected photoallergy typically does not include plant and pesticide allergens. The prevalence of allergic contact dermatitis and pho-toallergic contact dermatitis to plant and pesticide aller-gens was determined for this subgroup of patients. Observation: Positive reactions were detected in 12 of 26 patients who were tested with our photoallergen se-ries: 5 with allergic contact dermatitis, 5 with photoal-lergic contact dermatitis, and 2 with both. Four of the 12 patients had positive patch and photo-patch test re-actions to plant allergens, pesticide allergens, or both. The positive patch test reactions were to the plants Taraxa-cum officinale (dandelion) and Tanacetum vulgare (tansy) and to the pesticides <b>folpet</b> and captafol. Positive photo-patch test reactions were to the pesticides <b>folpet</b> and cap-tan. The histories of the patients suggested that 2 or 3 of the 4 patients had clinically relevant reactions. In the other 8 patients, positive reactions to the patch and photo-patch tests included fragrances, sunscreens, and antibac-terial agents. Conclusion: Plant and pesticide allergens should be in-cluded in the patch and photo-patch test series used {{for the evaluation of}} patients with suspected photoallergy. Arch Dermatol. 1999; 135 : 67 - 70 T HE DERMATOLOGIC manifes-tations of the photosensi-tivity disorders, includingphotoallergic contact der-matitis (PACD), occur on exposed areas of the body. In addition, al-lergic contact dermatitis (ACD) to air-borne substances also is found on non-covered sites. Clinically, the distinction between airborne ACD and PACD may be difficult. Plant and pesticide allergens are known to cause airborne ACD and PACD; however, these allergens are not used rou-tinely in patch and photo-patch testing. The purpose of this prospective {{study was to determine the}} value of including plant and pesticide allergens in patch and photo-patch testing of photosensitive patients...|$|E
40|$|Studies {{assessing}} {{skin irritation}} to chemicals have traditionally used laboratory animals; however, such methods are questionable regarding their relevance for humans. New {{in vitro methods}} have been validated, such as the reconstructed human epidermis (RHE) model (Episkin®, Epiderm®). The comparison (accuracy) with in vivo results such as the 4 -h human patch test (HPT) is 76 % at best (Epiderm®). There {{is a need to}} develop an in vitro method that better simulates the anatomo-pathological changes encountered in vivo. To develop an in vitro method to determine skin irritation using human viable skin through histopathology, and compare the results of 4 tested substances to the main in vitro methods and in vivo animal method (Draize test). Human skin removed during surgery was dermatomed and mounted on an in vitro flow-through diffusion cell system. Ten chemicals with known non-irritant (heptylbutyrate, hexylsalicylate, butylmethacrylate, isoproturon, bentazon, DEHP and methylisothiazolinone (MI)) and irritant properties (<b>folpet,</b> 1 -bromohexane and methylchloroisothiazolinone (MCI/MI)), a negative control (sodiumchloride) and a positive control (sodiumlaurylsulphate) were applied. The skin was exposed at least for 4 h. Histopathology was performed to investigate irritation signs (spongiosis, necrosis, vacuolization). We obtained 100 % accuracy with the HPT model; 75 % with the RHE models and 50 % with the Draize test for 4 tested substances. The coefficients of variation (CV) between our three test batches were < 0. 1, showing good reproducibility. Furthermore, we reported objectively histopathological irritation signs (irritation scale) : strong (<b>folpet),</b> significant (1 -bromohexane), slight (MCI/MI at 750 / 250 ppm) and none (isoproturon, bentazon, DEHP and MI).

40|$|Resumen del trabajo presentado al XIV Congreso Luso-Español de Herpetología y XVIII Congreso Español de Herpetología: "Retos de la Herpetología en el siglo XXI", celebrado en Lleida (España) del 5 al 8 de octubre de 2016. [...] et al. Pesticide risk {{assessment}} on terrestrial vertebrates {{is based on}} oral exposure of birds and mammals, being such scenario considered to cover risks to reptiles. However, topic exposure during egg incubation, as well as dermal uptake and/or overspray of pesticides once hatchlings leave the nest could constitute relevant exposure ways for reptiles. We conducted a two-stage exposure of Podarcis muralis eggs and hatchlings to three pesticides in order to analyse the effects of pesticide exposure on each developmental stage and to compare {{the relative importance of}} dermal and oral exposure of juveniles through different exposure routes. Eggs were incubated in soils previously sprayed with a pesticide solution corresponding to 40 % of the field application rate (to consider relevant crop interception) of formulations of either glufosinate ammonium (herbicide), <b>folpet</b> (fungicide) or fenpyroximate (insecticide). Eggs exposed to <b>folpet</b> hatched with a lower body mass than controls, whereas fenpyroximate showed effects on morphological differentiation. Upon hacthing, animals were assigned to a juvenile treatment consisting in the exposure through spiked soil (dermal) or food (oral) in a factorial block design considering both in-ovo and hatchling exposure. Concentrations during the hacthling exposure corresponded to 25 % of the application rate. Interestingly, egg exposure but not hatching exposure determined the body mass gain during the post-hatch stage of lizards exposed to glufosinate ammonium, which highlights the importance of considering lagged effects in pesticide {{risk assessment}}. Effects of pesticides on juveniles exposed either dermally or orally were very similar, which suggests the convenience of considering dermal exposure in risk assessment for reptiles as an additional route of pesticide uptake. Financed by the EU’s FP 7 (IEF- 2012 - 328328). Peer reviewe...|$|E

Eight fungicides (vinclozolin, procymidone, iprodione, penconazole, fenarimol, <b>folpet,</b> nuarimol and hexaconazole), one insecticide (chlorpyriphos) and two acaricides (bromopropylate and tetradifon) can be quantified. Good linearity was observed for all the compounds in the range 5 – 100 µg/L. The reproducibility of the measurements was found acceptable (with RSD’s below 20 %). Detection limits of 11 µg/L, on average, are sufficiently below the proposed maximum residue limits (MRL’s) for these compounds in wine.

Mycorrhizal inoculation with either inoculum increased cardoon shoot biomass compared to non-inoculated control plants. The pesticide applications had a neutral or positive effect on cardoon seedling growth.
