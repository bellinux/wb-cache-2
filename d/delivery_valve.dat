50|$|A {{simplified}} {{hydraulic ram}} {{is shown in}} Figure 2. Initially, the waste valve 4 is open, and the <b>delivery</b> <b>valve</b> 5 is closed. The water in the inlet pipe 1 starts to flow under {{the force of gravity}} and picks up speed and kinetic energy until the increasing drag force closes the waste valve. The momentum of the water flow in the inlet pipe against the now closed waste valve causes a water hammer that raises the pressure in the pump, opens the <b>delivery</b> <b>valve</b> 5, and forces some water to flow into the delivery pipe 3. Because this water is being forced uphill through the delivery pipe farther than it is falling downhill from the source, the flow slows; when the flow reverses, the delivery check valve closes. Meanwhile, the water hammer from the closing of the waste valve also produces a pressure pulse which propagates back up the inlet pipe to the source where it converts to a suction pulse that propagates back down the inlet pipe. This suction pulse, with the weight or spring on the valve, pulls the waste valve back open and allows the process to begin again.|$|E

40|$|In {{the present}} work, a {{theoretical}} and computational investigation is {{conducted to examine}} {{the performance of a}} fuel injection system fitted with a constant pressure valve, used to power a high speed direct injection (DI) diesel engine. The <b>delivery</b> <b>valve</b> (conventional layout) in the fuel injection system of diesel engines is used to provide a residual pressure in the fuel pipeline for the next injection. However, this layout often results in secondary injections which have a serious effect on engine performance. This problem is more severe in the cases of maintaining high residual pressure values. The use of a secondary valve placed inside the <b>delivery</b> <b>valve,</b> called the constant pressure valve, eliminates this problem by relieving the fuel pipe from the high pressure fluctuations caused by the pressure waves reflected at the injector end and the <b>delivery</b> <b>valve</b> chamber. A relevant experimental investigation is conducted with such a fuel injection system on a high speed direct injection diesel engine, examining the effect of load and speed on the performance of the fuel injection system. The experimental results compare well with the theoretical results obtained from a comprehensive simulation model developed by the present authors. Also, results are presented using the simulation model for the same fuel injection system without being fitted with the constant pressure valve, revealing the occurrence of secondary injections at a high engine speed. The simulation model offers very useful information concerning the design of such a fuel injection system and may be used during the development procedure providing economy in time and {{a better understanding of the}} entire injection process...|$|E

A distinctive feature of the Humphrey pump, compared to others, is that the water only has to flow through this single set of valves: there are no non-return outlet valves, only the inertia of the delivered water within the outlet pipe is used to control its flow. As there are no <b>delivery</b> <b>valves</b> opening and closing suddenly, the water flow changes smoothly, avoiding water hammer and the usual problems for this type of pump.|$|R

In present competitive and challenging market, industries needs to improve their strength and must concentrate on to their process flows. Lean manufacturing is the solution to improve their quality and increasing profit for manufacturing over the international market. Lean manufacturing provides varieties of tools and strategies which can help in identification of waste, reduction or elimination of waste, manufacturing product with better quality, lowering the product cost, reducing human effort and reducing product manufacturing time. This paper demonstrates various lean manufacturing. Lean manufacturing is a precise approach for economical utilization of raw product and eliminating waste through continuous improvement, and aimed to provide qualitative product to the customers. Lead time is the time spent between the original customer order and final delivery of the product. Project work is being carried out at XYZ organization in Gaziabad,U. P,India. Lean manufacturing is a production practice that considers expenditure of resources for any goal other than creation of value for the end customer to be wasteful and thus a target for elimination. Lead time is calculated by adding value added time and non-value added time. <b>Delivery</b> <b>valve</b> is a non-return valve between the high pressure for the fuel injection system and pump plunger.

40|$|Understanding the exergy losses {{stemming}} from heat transfer in compressors and expanders {{is important for}} many energy storage applications such as compressed air and pumped thermal storage. In order to obtain {{a better understanding of}} these losses, CFD simulations were performed for simple gas springs, for a gas spring with an internal grid to mimic valve flow, and for a reciprocating compressor with functioning inlet and outlet valves. The wall heat exchanges for these three cases were examined and compared. The model adopted has previously been validated for a simple gas spring using experimental data from literature. For the gas spring with an internal grid it was found that increased mixing leads to higher heat-transfer-induced hysteresis losses and (at high piston speeds) to a significant pressure loss. These two types of loss can be distinguished by undertaking adiabatic-wall calculations. For a compressor (i. e., with valve flows) heat transfer over the cycle depends very much on valve timing. For example, at 1500 rpm, when the <b>delivery</b> <b>valve</b> is opened at 7 bar the heat transfer coefficient for the initial stages of compression is similar to that for a simple gas spring, whereas for the same speed at 6 bar it is more than doubled.

40|$|The fuel {{injection}} system {{is one of the}} most important parameters for the operation of diesel engines. It controls the combustion mechanism in the engine cylinder and the mechanisms that lead to the formation of pollutants. A great deal of effort has been made up to now to simulate the operation of the {{fuel injection}} system, using complicated simulation models.

40|$|Conventional {{methods of}} {{combining}} mammalian cells and synthetic polymers for tissue engineering applications are frequently problematic. This {{is due to}} the incompatibility between the sensitive cell component and the harsh polymer processing environments required to form the desired porous scaffold e. g. high temperatures and organic solvents. This results in the necessity for an often inefficient and time consuming two step scaffold seeding process, whereby mammalian cells are added to a pre-fabricated polymer scaffold. High pressure or supercritical CO 2 (scCO 2) processing is a method of fabricating porous polymer scaffolds at ambient temperatures and without using organic solvents. When pressurised, CO 2 becomes highly soluble in a variety of amorphous polymers such as poly(DL-lactic acid) (PDLLA) to produce a high viscosity liquid. Subsequent decompression causes the formation of gas bubbles that become permanent as the polymer vitrifies. Based upon technology at the University of Nottingham, we hypothesised that mammalian cells could be incorporated into poly(DL-lactic acid) (PDLLA) scaffolds using a single step scCO 2 process. This would not only make the process more rapid, but it would remove the inefficient scaffold seeding step required in most cell based tissue engineering strategies. Mammalian cells were subject to a range of high pressure CO 2 and N 2 processing conditions and assessed for cell survival. It was discovered that primary hepatocytes, meniscal fibrochondrocytes, myoblastic C 2 C 12 s and 3 T 3 fibroblasts could survive after exposure to both high pressure gases on a time and pressure dependent basis. Cells exposed to scCO 2 for one minute were then assessed for both gene and enzyme function. Using a microarray, it was found that only eight genes (out of 9000) in murine C 2 C 12 cells were significantly down-regulated when compared to untreated cells. Continued cell function was confirmed by measuring BMP- 2 induced alkaline phosphatase activity as a measure of osteogenic differentiation in myoblastic C 2 C 12 cells. Alkaline phosphatise activity was indistinguishable between untreated cells and cells exposed to scCO 2 for one minute. Additional enzyme and receptor function was confirmed by measuring cytochrome P 450 activity in primary hepatocytes after one minute of scCO 2 processing. In {{the second half of the}} study, these short processing times were found to be sufficient to plasticise and foam porous PDLLA scaffolds. Therefore, cells were incorporated into the biodegradable PDLLA foams by pre-mixing the cell suspension with the polymer powder and exposing to scCO 2. Subsequent decompression caused the polymer to foam with the cells trapped within the porous structure. Despite the presence of the plasticised PDLLA, cell survival was confirmed by both an Alamar B 1 ueTM assay and LIVE/DEADTM staining. Osteogenic differentiation on the scaffolds was confirmed by a stain and assay for BMP- 2 induced alkaline phosphatase activity. Finally, a second generation processing piece of processing apparatus was designed that permitted mammalian cells to be passed into a pressurised vessel containing preplasticised PDLLA using a novel high-pressure CO 2 injection system. This was made possible by constant optimisation of the high pressure apparatus and the introduction of a cell <b>delivery</b> <b>valve.</b> When injected at high pressures cell survival was found to be reduced when compared with previous experiments although this was likely to be due to the additional mechanical trauma caused by the injection process. Despite this, the live cell population was shown to retain its osteogenic differentiation capacity when induced with BMP- 2. With further optimisation of the delivery method, cells may survive this process in sufficient numbers to suggest that it could be used as a method of seeding tissue engineering scaffolds in the future. This development could remove the limitations place on polymer processing time by the finite survival period of the cells, permitting tuning of the scaffold structure to suit the application. In summary, this study has demonstrated that mammalian cells can be incorporated into biodegradable PDLLA scaffolds using a rapid, one-step scCO 2 process without the use of toxic solvents or elevated temperatures. Furthermore, the development of the high pressure injection system could allow cells to be incorporated during the fabrication step, removing the restrictions on polymer processing. This technique could be used for the rapid production of tissue cell loaded engineering scaffolds and other associated biotechnological applications where cells and synthetic polymers are combined, such as cell therapy and recombinant protein production.

40|$|Transaortic transcatheter {{aortic valve}} {{implantation}} (TAo-TAVI) is a recently developed approach that provides an alternative <b>delivery</b> route for <b>valve</b> replacement {{in patients with}} vascular abnormalities or existing comorbidities. While initial studies have shown the principal efficacy and safety, the real world effectiveness and safety of this approach remains to be fully assessed. In this regard, the Registry Of the Utilization of the TAo-TAVI approach using the Edwards SAPIEN Valve (ROUTE) represents the first multicenter, multinational prospective documentation of the course and outcome of patients with severe calcific aortic stenosis (AS) undergoing TAo-TAVI. ROUTE commenced in February 2013 {{with the goal of}} consecutively enrolling 300 patients at up to 22 sites across Europe. The primary objective of ROUTE is to determine the 30 -day mortality associated with TAo-TAVI using the Edwards SAPIEN THV (Edwards Lifesciences, Irvine, CA). In addition, ROUTE aims to quantify complications, predictors of patient outcome and the value of CT guided valve sizing. Findings from this landmark registry will provide important information regarding procedural success rates and early mortality in patients undergoing TAo-TAVI. Identifier: NCT 0199143...|$|R
