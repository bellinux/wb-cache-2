50|$|Herbert Alfred Humphrey MInstCE MIMechE MIEE FCGI (2 December 1868 - 9 March 1951) was a British engineer, {{inventor}} of the <b>Humphrey</b> <b>pump.</b>|$|E
5000|$|Few {{completed}} installations of <b>Humphrey</b> <b>pumps</b> {{are known}} and described: ...|$|R
50|$|The {{historic}} Cobdogla Homestead Ruins and the <b>Humphrey</b> <b>Pumps</b> at {{the former}} Cobdogla Pumping Station are listed on the South Australian Heritage Register.|$|R
50|$|King George V Reservoir, near Chingford in East London, {{had four}} <b>Humphrey</b> <b>pumps</b> {{installed}} when the pumping station was first constructed in 1912. Each pump {{was capable of}} pumping 40,000,000 gallons of water per day. A fifth, smaller, pump was added later. These were built by Beardmore's of Glasgow.|$|R
50|$|The <b>Humphrey</b> <b>pump</b> {{is a large}} {{internal}} combustion gas-fuelled liquid-piston pump. They were used for large-scale water supply projects. They were only popular for a short time, from around 1910 to the outbreak of World War I, but they continued in service {{for a long period}} afterwards, some lasting into the 1970s.|$|E
5000|$|The <b>Humphrey</b> <b>pump</b> {{could operate}} {{with either a}} {{four-stroke}} or two-stroke cycle. [...] Their normal operation was a four-stroke cycle. This required mechanical interlocks to the inlet valves, so that the exhaust and scavenge valves open once during the cycle to allow scavenging of the exhaust, but not during the compression cycle afterwards. A two-stroke cycle was also possible, if adequate scavenging could be achieved. The air trapped within the combustion chamber of a <b>Humphrey</b> <b>pump</b> has two roles: both for combustion and also as an air spring to maintain the oscillating water column. As this spring action involves a large volume of air, relative to the minimal air needed for combustion, the air cools easily to below the ignition temperature to pre-ignite the next charge. There {{would still be a}} risk of inefficient four-stroking though, unless the scavenging is effective enough to sweep out the previous exhaust gases. This was done by using a tall, thin combustion chamber so that the combustion air remained roughly isolated from the majority of the chamber's air and so was scavenged through the exhaust valves first. There was no separate scavenge air valve.|$|E
50|$|The {{pumps are}} an internal-combustion fluidyne engine. Although fluidynes are now {{considered}} to be a form of the external combustion Stirling engine, the <b>Humphrey</b> <b>pump</b> was an early example of one using internal combustion. A fluidyne has few moving parts: although they may include various valves, their key feature is that a mass of liquid acts as their piston, rather than the more usual mechanical piston. They are normally used for pumping liquids and use the pumped liquid as its own piston.|$|E
5000|$|A single 66" [...] {{diameter}} pump {{was installed}} at Del Rio, Texas in 1914. This was {{constructed by the}} <b>Humphrey</b> Gas <b>Pump</b> Co. of Syracuse, NY, who had licensed the Humphrey patents.|$|R
50|$|Cobdogla is {{the home}} of the Irrigation and Steam Museum, centred on a pair of <b>Humphrey</b> <b>pumps,</b> one of which is operable, and boasts a working 3 km railway with both a diesel and a steam {{locomotive}} (originally used by Humes Ltd. to transport pipes for the Loveday pipeline), a traction engine and numerous stationary engines, all in working order, maintained and operated by enthusiasts, as well as static displays on various river topics - Village Settlements, Loveday Internment Camp and Irrigation maintained by the National Trust. Open days are infrequent as a great deal of (voluntary) labour is involved.|$|R
50|$|A similar pump, the Joy pump, {{was also}} {{described}} at {{around the same}} time. This was much smaller, around six inches in diameter rather than six feet, and also had much smaller water pipe connections to it. This reduced water mass also reduced the compression ration available in the combustion chamber, leading to reduced efficiency. The pump's ability {{to work with a}} suction lift of a few feet, rather than needing to be submerged like the <b>Humphrey</b> <b>pump,</b> was a convenience though. This pump was thought to have some application for small-scale or portable tasks, where its convenience outweighed efficiency.|$|E
50|$|The first {{limitation}} of the <b>Humphrey</b> <b>pump</b> {{is that it has}} no suction capacity, in fact it must be installed in a dry sump several metres below the supply level. Given the pump's physical size and the need to protect the equipment against flood events, this is no small engineering exercise, requiring (in the Cobdogla example) several thousand tonnes of concrete. Also, it has a maximum lift of only around 10 metres. Its usual fuel, producer gas, contains very high levels of carbon monoxide, from which staff and visitors need to be protected in the event of accidental leakage. It is due to this concern that the Cobdogla demonstrations were halted.|$|E
50|$|Edith Humphrey was the {{youngest}} of the seven surviving children of John Charles Humphrey (1833-1903), a clerk at the London Metropolitan Board of Works, and his wife Louisa (n√©e Frost, 1831-1910), a teacher. John Humphrey had started life in poor circumstances, his father having been a bootmaker, and he was a great supporter of education for his daughters as well as his sons. Edith grew up in a middle-class household in Kentish Town, London. Her two elder sisters became teachers, and her brothers, including Herbert Alfred Humphrey (1868-1951), inventor of the <b>Humphrey</b> <b>pump,</b> and William Humphrey (1863-1898), head of the Fourah Bay College in Freetown, Sierra Leone, were educated to degree level.|$|E
50|$|Humphrey's pump {{consists}} of a large U-shaped tube, filled with water. One end is sealed by a heavy cast iron 'combustion head'. The combustion head contains the inlet and exhaust valves, the ignition source and withstands {{the pressure of the}} combustion chamber. Water enters the pump through sprung inlet valves below the combustion chamber. A distinctive feature of the <b>Humphrey</b> <b>pump,</b> compared to others, is that the water only has to flow through this single set of valves: there are no non-return outlet valves, only the inertia of the delivered water within the outlet pipe is used to control its flow. As there are no delivery valves opening and closing suddenly, the water flow changes smoothly, avoiding water hammer and the usual problems for this type of pump.|$|E
5000|$|The Flying Inn is {{the final}} novel by G. K. Chesterton, first {{published}} in 1914. It {{is set in a}} future England where the Temperance movement has allowed a bizarre form of [...] "Progressive" [...] Islam to dominate the political and social life of the country. Because of this, alcohol sales to the poor are effectively prohibited, while the rich can get alcoholic drinks [...] "under a medical certificate". The plot centres on the adventures of Humphrey Pumph (see also <b>Humphrey</b> <b>Pump)</b> and Captain Patrick Dalroy, who roam the country in their cart with a barrel of rum in an attempt to evade Prohibition, exploiting loopholes in the law to temporarily prevent the police taking action against them. Eventually the heroes and their followers foil an attempted coup by an Islamic military force.|$|E
