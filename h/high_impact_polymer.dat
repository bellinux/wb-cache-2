40|$|Statement of the Problem: Despite its {{popularity}} as a denture-base material, poly-methyl methacrylate exhibits inherently low resistance to impact and fatigue failure. This {{is reflected in}} the analyses of the prevalence of denture fracture which suggests that prosthesis failure remains an unsolved problem. Consequently, various approaches to improve the physical and mechanical properties of denture-base polymers have been proposed. These include incorporation of solid metal forms and various types of fibers to provide reinforcement to fracture prone areas. In recent years there has been considerable interest in glass fiber reinforcement of polymeric denture resins. Partial fiber reinforcement using glass fiber has been shown to improve the mechanical properties of removable prostheses. However, adequate impregnation of fibers often requires the use of excessive methyl methacrylate monomer which has a deleterious effect on the mechanical properties of the fiber composite material. Purpose: The aim {{of the present study was}} to determine the effect of glass fiber polysulphone composite reinforcement on the flexural characteristics of two commonly used denture-base polymers. Materials and methods: Prefabricated E-glass fiber polysulphone composite rods, ± 3 mm in diameter, with a continuous, unidirectional, non-silanized fiber concentration of ± 55 vol %, were employed as strengtheners. The reinforcement was incorporated axial to the neutral axis in standardized cylindrical heat polymerizing conventional and high impact resin test specimens 6 mm in diameter and 28 mm in length. The two reinforced pattern groups (n = 10) were compared with unreinforced resin control groups. A three point loading test was performed in air after storage of the specimens in water at 37 °C for a period of 8 weeks. The following values were measured : flexural modulus and flexural strength. The obtained data were subjected to relevant statistical analysis. Results: The flexural modulus of the glass fiber polysulphone reinforcement was 14, 106 MPa and the flexural strength 546. 6 MPa. The flexural modulus of conventional denture-base resin was 1746 MPa, reinforcement increased it to 2328 MPa, and the flexural strength increased from 164 MPa to 209 MPa. The flexural modulus of <b>high</b> <b>impact</b> <b>polymer</b> was 1684 MPa and reinforcement increased it to 2067 MPa. The flexural strength was increased from 171 MPa to 242 MPa with reinforcement. Statistical analysis using t test showed that reinforcement affected the flexural modulus and flexural strength of polymer brands (p < : 05). Conclusion: Novel glass fiber polysulphone composite reinforcement may considerably enhance the flexural properties of multi phase denture-base polymers.

40|$|The {{enhancement}} {{of the impact}} resistance of plastics through {{the introduction of a}} rubbery dispersed phase is one of the means to develop <b>high</b> <b>impact</b> strength <b>polymers</b> and has been exploited commercially on a large scale. Rubber-toughened PVC-U or <b>high</b> <b>impact</b> PVC-U is one such important class of rubber-toughened plastics material which has been developed and has a wide application in the building and furniture industries. The type of impact modifiers most commonly used for window frame applications are chlorinated polyethylene, ethylene-vinyl acetate and acrylate modifiers. The current trend shows the importance and popularity of high impact-acrylate-modified PVC. The objective of this research is to extend the existing understanding of toughness enhancement in rubber-toughened polymer materials to acrylate rubber-modified PVC. This paper reports on the effect of temperature on the impact strength of acrylate rubber-modified PVC-U using the instrumented falling weight impact test (IFWI) method. Toughening and fracture mechanism in acrylate-modified PVC were also investigated. The results show that all the acrylate rubber-toughened PVC blends have successfully shifted the ductileâ€“brittle transition points to a lower temperature. However, the impact modifiers were found to differ in their efficiency to shift the ductile to brittle transition. The findings from the SEM study shows that the fibrous yielding phenomenon observed is an indication of the transition of the brittle stage to ductile stage and correlates well with the large increases of the impact strength. ...|$|R

40|$|In practice, some bugs {{have more}} impact than others and thus deserve more {{immediate}} attention. Due to tight schedule and limited human resource, developers {{may not have}} enough time to inspect all bugs. Thus, they often concentrate on bugs that are highly impactful. In the literature, <b>high</b> <b>impact</b> bugs are used to refer to the bugs which appear in unexpected time or locations and bring more unexpected effects, or break pre-existing functionalities and destroy the user experience. Unfortunately, identifying <b>high</b> <b>impact</b> bugs from the thousands of bug reports in a bug tracking system is not an easy feat. Thus, an automated technique that can identify high-impact bug reports can help developers to be aware of them early, rectify them quickly, and minimize the damages they cause. Considering that only a small proportion of bugs are <b>high</b> <b>impact</b> bugs, the identification of <b>high</b> <b>impact</b> bug reports is a difficult task. In this paper, we propose an approach to identify <b>high</b> <b>impact</b> bug reports by leveraging imbalanced learning strategies. We investigate the effectiveness of various imbalanced learning strategies built upon a number of well-known classification algorithms. In particular, we choose four widely used strategies for dealing with imbalanced data and use naive Bayes multinominal as the classification algorithm to conduct experiments on four datasets from four different open source projects. We perform an empirical study on a specific type of <b>high</b> <b>impact</b> bugs, i. e., surprise bugs, which were first studied by Shihab et al. The results show that under-sampling is the best imbalanced learning strategy with naive Bayes multinominal for <b>high</b> <b>impact</b> bug identification...|$|R
