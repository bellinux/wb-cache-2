This paper investigates two different access selection strategies for three typical environments (hotspot, urban, and suburban) to establish when, and to what extent, the performance can be improved. In the first strategy users simply connect to the strongest access point (AP) whereas the users within the second strategy connect to the AP maximizing the instantaneous aggregated capacity according a greedy algorithm. Both strategies are compared to a reference case where users connect to the strongest AP belonging to their home operator. We investigated a two-operator scenario with APs using CSMA/CA and {{the results indicate that}} a significant improvement, both in terms of coverage and resource efficiency, can be achieved if users simply connect to the strongest AP. Moreover the results show that further improvement is possible, especially in urban and hotspot environments, with more complex strategies. 1 I...|$|E
30|$|Based on [12, 13], {{infrastructure}} sharing solutions can be categorised {{into three}} main types: geographical, passive and active sharing. In <b>geographical</b> <b>sharing</b> or national roaming, a federation of operators can achieve full coverage {{in a short}} time, by dividing the service area into several regions, over which each of the operators provides coverage [14]. Passive sharing refers to the sharing agreement of fundamental infrastructures, such as tower masts, equipment houses and power supply, {{in order to reduce}} operational costs. Active sharing, however, is the sharing of transport infrastructures, radio spectrum and baseband processing resources. In [15], two types of sharing are introduced: multi-operator RAN and multi-core network. In the former, operators maintain a maximum level of independent control over their traffic quality and capacity, by splitting BSs and their controller nodes into logically independent units over a single physical infrastructure. In the latter, however, operators give up their independent control, by sharing the aforementioned entities in conjunction with the pooling of radio resources. Although the cost items in multi-core network are identical to multi-operator RAN, radio resources pooling leads to further savings in extremely low-traffic areas over equipment-related costs. Moreover, a network-wide radio resource management framework is proposed [16], in order to achieve isolation in addition to the optimal distribution of resources across the network.|$|E

Scotland's public spending deficit in 2012–13 was £12bn, a £3.5bn increase on the previous year; over the same period, the UK's deficit decreased by £2.6bn. Over the past thirty years, Scotland contributed a relative budget surplus of almost £20billion to the UK economy.|$|R

40|$|Geographical {{information}} (GI), {{which is}} the key to effective planning and decision-making in a variety of application domains, not least in the Earth Sciences, shows its increasingly importance in E-government constructing and has been applied widely, as many GIS-based E-government systems have been constructed. The mode of <b>geographical</b> information <b>sharing</b> is important to E-government constructing as it has a direct effect on application extent and profundity of E-government. Ontology is the theory that uses a specific vocabulary to describe entities, classes, properties and functions related to a certain view of the world. As the convincing instrument on establishing the conceptual model, and its latent advantages in solving the heterogeneity of various data resources, interoperability and integration, ontology has held Scientists' interest internationally. This paper focuses on the application schema of ontology-based <b>geographical</b> information <b>sharing</b> in E-government constructing. The specifications provided by the OpenGIS-Consortium (OCC) enable syntactic interoperability and cataloguing of geographic information. However, while OGC-compliant catalogues support discovery, organization, and access of geographic information, the), do not yet provide methods for overcoming problems of semantic heterogeneity. These problems still present inconsistency between expanded rapidly geographical data and dissatisfaction of the user, and challenges for the GI sharing in the open and distributed environments of e-government. One possible approach to overcome the problem of semantic heterogeneity is the explication of knowledge by means of ontology, which can be used for the identification and association of semantically corresponding concepts. This paper describes the architecture for ontology-based geographic information sharing in e-government. The paper is structured as follows. We first introduce the actuality of the <b>geographical</b> information <b>sharing</b> in e-government and the problems existing; discuss the significance of the research on ontology-based <b>geographical</b> information <b>sharing</b> in e-government constructing. In section 2 we describe the analysis of semantic heterogeneity in e-government.

The steps of designing geographical information ontology is described in section 4. We conclude the paper by pointing out open questions to be dealt with in future research...|$|R

30|$|The {{prominent}} {{feature of}} multi-ethnic culture in Qinghai is that extensive acculturation {{has occurred in}} the context of ethnic coexistence. In order to investigate the phenomenon of one ethnic group absorbing cultural elements from another, as well as how this changes group members’ psychology, what dimension should we observe? We know that nationality “indicates a stable community with a <b>shared</b> language, <b>shared</b> <b>geographical</b> region, <b>shared</b> economic life, which is formed by human beings at a certain stage of historical development, and common psychological qualities that are expressed in shared ethnic cultural traits”. According to this, based on the characteristics of the multi-ethnic acculturation of Qinghai, we have determined that ethnic culture and its attached ethnic identity should be a main point of our investigation. 2 So, what are other points we shoud take into consideration within ethnic culture? In 1871, British anthropologist E. B. Tylor formulated the following classic definition of culture: Culture or civilization, taken in its wide ethnographic sense, is that complex whole which includes knowledge, belief, art, morals, law, custom, and any other capabilities and habits acquired by man as a member of society. Based on Tylor’s definition, combining the concrete circumstances of ethnic cultures in Qinghai that mutually absorb and borrow from each other, this paper highlights five dimensions to analyse the circumstances of acculturation of every ethnic culture. The five dimensions are: 1) language; 2) religion; 3) marriage; 4) ways of life; 5) ethnic identity.|$|R
