40|$|We {{investigated}} the combined effect of radiation and clinically relevant doses of <b>emitefur</b> (BOF-A 2), a newly developed anti-cancer agent {{consisting of a}} masked form of 5 -fluorouracil (5 -FU) and a potent inhibitor of 5 -FU degradation, in two types of murine tumours. In preliminary pharmacokinetic studies, the area under the curve for 5 -FU in plasma, after administration of 12. 5 mg kg- 1 and 25 mg kg- 1 <b>emitefur</b> in mice, appeared {{to be similar to}} that obtained on the first day and that on the seventh day, respectively, after starting administration of 400 - 600 mg day- 1 in humans. These doses (12. 5 and 25 mg kg- 1) of <b>emitefur</b> were evaluated either alone or in combination with single (15 Gy), five-fraction (4 Gy each) or ten-fraction (2. 8 Gy each) irradiation using a tumour growth delay assay for SCCVII tumours and in combination with four-fraction (5 Gy each) irradiation using an in vivo-in vitro assay for EMT 6 tumours. The anti-tumour and radiation-enhancing effects of 12. 5 mg kg- 1 <b>emitefur</b> were not significant in any except the ten-fraction experiment. On the other hand, multiple doses of 25 mg kg- 1 <b>emitefur</b> given either alone or in combination with radiation produced marked effects. The mean tumour growth delay time (the time to double in volume for treated tumours minus that for untreated tumours) was 8. 1 days for five administrations of 25 mg kg- 1 <b>emitefur.</b> 10. 4 days for five fractions of 4 Gy and 22. 1 days for five treatments with the combination of the two. Thus, the increase in growth delay afforded by this combination was at least additive. The effect of four fractions of 5 Gy with 25 mg kg- 1 <b>emitefur</b> in EMT 6 tumours was lower than that of four fractions of 7. 5 Gy, but the effect of five fractions of 4 Gy with this dose of <b>emitefur</b> in SCCVII tumours was similar to the effect of five fractions of 6 Gy, and the effect of ten fractions of 2. 8 Gy with 25 mg kg- 1 <b>emitefur</b> was much higher than that of ten fractions of 4. 2 Gy. In conclusion, <b>emitefur</b> given either alone or in combination with radiation appears to have a significant anti-tumour effect even at clinically relevant dose levels, although a threshold dose exists between 12. 5 and 25 mg kg- 1. Further clinical studies of this compound are warranted...|$|E
