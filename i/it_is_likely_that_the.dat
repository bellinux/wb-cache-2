5|$|Ecgberht {{was buried}} in Winchester, as were his son, Æthelwulf, his grandson, Alfred the Great, and his great-grandson, Edward the Elder. During the ninth century, Winchester began {{to show signs of}} urbanisation, and <b>it</b> <b>is</b> <b>likely</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> {{sequence}} of burials indicates that Winchester was held in high regard by the West Saxon royal line.|$|E
5|$|<b>It</b> <b>is</b> <b>likely</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> tonal {{lowering}} seen in {{this particular}} example {{is related to the}} low tone nasal prefix found in future tense constructions in some other Senufo languages. In fact, Supyire shows a similar phenomenon in future tense constructions with a direct object (in other future tense constructions, a low tone nasal is found).|$|E
5|$|<b>It</b> <b>is</b> <b>likely</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> {{traditional}} use of narcissi for {{the treatment}} of cancer was due to the presence of isocarbostyril constituents such as narciclasine, pancratistatin and their congeners. N. poeticus contains about 0.12g of narciclasine per kg of fresh bulbs.|$|E
50|$|Little {{is known}} about their fate after the early 8th century. <b>It</b> <b>is</b> <b>likely</b> <b>that</b> they became {{incorporated}} into the Khazar Khaganate. However, <b>it</b> <b>is</b> <b>likely</b> <b>that</b> they survived {{in some form or}} another for several centuries, possibly even until the 11th century.|$|R

5000|$|<b>It</b> <b>is</b> <b>likely</b> <b>that</b> wine has <b>been</b> {{produced}} in Sussex for around 2000 years. [...] <b>It</b> <b>is</b> <b>likely</b> <b>that</b> wine <b>was</b> produced {{either by the}} late Iron Age tribes such as the Belgae and Regnenses or by the Romans who governed {{what was to become}} Sussex.|$|R
5|$|Most of the {{surviving}} prehistoric stone monuments on Exmoor are located on those areas of moorland outside the limits of medieval and post-medieval agriculture. For this reason <b>it</b> <b>is</b> <b>likely</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> surviving sites are not a reliable indicator of the original extent of these sites.|$|E
5|$|Quality of {{life may}} be {{significantly}} reduced, {{even in those}} people on optimum medical therapy. Many report both physical and psychological problems. <b>It</b> <b>is</b> <b>likely</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> commonly used replacement therapies do not completely mimic the natural hormone levels in the body. Health costs remain about double those of the normal population.|$|E
5|$|The gods {{involved}} in a festival also received various offerings in much larger quantities than in daily ceremonies. The enormous amounts of food listed in festival texts are unlikely to have been divided among the priests alone, so <b>it</b> <b>is</b> <b>likely</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> celebrating commoners also participated in the reversion of these offerings.|$|E
5|$|Such long-distance {{high-speed}} railways are {{not included}} in the preliminary long-term plan for 2010–2040, and <b>it</b> <b>is</b> <b>likely</b> <b>that</b> railways Hamar–Trondheim and Drammen–Kristansand will be built first since they are easier to build. <b>It</b> <b>is</b> <b>likely</b> <b>that</b> a high-speed railway to Bergen will be built sometime in the period 2030–2060.|$|R

5|$|Through his daughter, {{he is an}} {{ancestor}} of the Beauchamp family of Elmley in Worcestershire, a scion of which, William de Beauchamp, became Earl of Warwick. <b>It</b> <b>is</b> <b>likely</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> Beauchamp family's symbol, a bear, derives from their relationship to Urse.|$|E
5|$|A second church, also {{dedicated}} to St Michael, was built of local sandstone in the 14th century by the Abbot Adam of Sodbury, incorporating {{the foundations of}} the previous building. It included stained glass and decorated floor tiles. There was also a portable altar of Purbeck Marble; <b>it</b> <b>is</b> <b>likely</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> Monastery of St Michael on the Tor was a daughter house of Glastonbury Abbey. In 1243 Henry III granted a charter for a six-day fair at the site.|$|E
5|$|An {{analysis}} {{conducted using}} X-ray fluorescence {{has found that}} the pendant was made from a highly debased gold alloy, with only 37% of the alloy consisting of gold and the remainder consisting of silver with some copper. <b>It</b> <b>is</b> <b>likely</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> gold came from melted-down coins of the Merovingian dynasty of Francia. The Frankish currency underwent a similar debasing at around this time. The link with Francia is illustrative of the trading and cultural links that existed between Anglo-Saxon England and continental Europe at the time.|$|E

60|$|If coal has {{all been}} {{vegetable}} soil, then <b>it</b> <b>is</b> <b>likely</b> <b>that</b> some of <b>it</b> has not <b>been</b> quite converted into shapeless coal. <b>It</b> <b>is</b> <b>likely</b> <b>that</b> there will <b>be</b> vegetable fibre {{still to be}} seen here and there; perhaps leaves, perhaps even stems of trees, as in a peat bog. Let us look for them.|$|R
5|$|Differences in songs, {{genetics}} and morphology {{suggests that the}} Azores were colonised in a single invasion in the late Pleistocene, about 100,000 years ago. <b>It</b> <b>is</b> <b>likely</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> initial colonisation was of the easternmost islands, with a subsequent spread to the central and western island groups from the western caldera of São Miguel, where both eastern and western song types are found.|$|E
5|$|<b>It</b> <b>is</b> <b>likely</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> {{long journey}} and the siege had a {{detrimental}} {{effect on the}} Sultan's health. His death meant that any advances were postponed as the Grand Vizier {{had to return to}} Constantinople for the succession of the new Sultan, Selim II. Even if Suleiman had lived his army could not have achieved much in the short time that remained between the fall of Szigeth and the onset of winter. The prolonged resistance at Szigeth delayed the Ottoman push to Vienna.|$|E
5|$|<b>It</b> <b>is</b> <b>likely</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> {{satellite}} site of Akte was {{the ruin}} that Spanish friar Andrés de Avendaño {{referred to as}} Tanxulukmul in early 1695. Teoberto Maler visited Motul de San José in May 1895, and described one of the stelae in his report Explorations in the Department of Peten, Guatemala, published by the Peabody Museum of Archaeology and Ethnology of Harvard University in 1910. Ian Graham and Arlen Chase have separately mapped portions of the site core.|$|E

5|$|Now, {{the match}} is {{recognised}} as the initial first-class match {{to be played}} in Australia. At the time, <b>it</b> <b>is</b> <b>likely</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> players realised that the game {{was the first to}} take place between two Australian colonies, and was therefore a historic occasion. Although there were attempts in Australia to identify first-class matches, no formal definition was applied in Australia until 1947. A meeting of the International Cricket Conference in 1981 agreed that all intercolonial and interstate matches played in Australia before 1947, including the 1851 match, should retrospectively be considered first-class.|$|E
5|$|Slaughter {{was elected}} {{lieutenant}} governor in 1808. In a four-man race, he {{received more than}} three times the number of votes as his nearest opponent. His four-year term under Governor Charles Scott was largely undistinguished. Although the exact date is unknown, <b>it</b> <b>is</b> <b>likely</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> death of Slaughter's second wife preceded his election as lieutenant governor. On October 3, 1811, he married his third wife, Elizabeth (Thompson) Rodes, a widow from Scott County.|$|E
5|$|Some of {{the stone}} taken from the castle was used to {{construct}} the mid-eighteenth-century grade II-listed buildings at 43 and 45 Castle Street, and other buildings known to have used the stone, but no longer extant, include old houses demolished to build the Castle Mill textile factory. The mill, now demolished, {{was said to have}} been built on castle foundations up to 4m (12ft) thick; 15 Castle Street also rests on the old foundation wall. <b>It</b> <b>is</b> <b>likely</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> former Melbourne Furnace and the Furnace Farm barn also used recycled castle material.|$|E

5|$|The 1224 carucage was a tax levied {{only on the}} clergy, and the {{revenues}} from it did not appear in that year's Pipe Roll. <b>It</b> <b>is</b> <b>likely</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> clergy who owed the carucage also collected the tax. Records indicate {{that the bulk of}} the money raised was paid into the Wardrobe, the king's personal treasury, rather than the Exchequer. The 1224 assessment was based on ploughteams, and was imposed to pay for the restitution of the lost lands in France.|$|E
5|$|The {{family name}} most likely {{derives from the}} Slavic kača (snake), the closest word to the name Kačić. Based on etymology, <b>it</b> <b>is</b> <b>likely</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> Hungarian Kačićs (Kacsics) are {{originally}} of Slavic rather than Hungarian origin. Latin sources also refer to the name as de genere Chacittorum, generatione Cacich, genus Chacittorum, nobiles de Cacich, Caçici, Cacicii, Cacicli, Caciki, Cazethi, Cazichi, Cazziki, Chacichi and Kazzeti. The Kačić name is distinct from the similar-sounding name of another noble family, Kašić (Chasich), and its derivations (Kasig, Kasige).|$|E
5|$|The plot of Sherlock Holmes Baffled is {{unrelated}} to Sir Arthur Conan Doyle's canonical Sherlock Holmes stories; <b>it</b> <b>is</b> <b>likely</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> character's name was used purely for its {{familiarity with the}} public. Shot from a single {{point of view on}} a stage set, the intention of Sherlock Holmes Baffled was probably to act as a showcase for basic film trickery and film editing effects, particularly the stop trick first developed four years earlier in 1896 by French director Georges Méliès.|$|E
