5|$|A {{volatile}} {{member of}} the team, undone by years of combat stress and alcohol abuse. Lundgren's personal history (including his chemical engineering degree) were incorporated into the character's story by Stallone. Lundgren was <b>hesitant</b> <b>to</b> participate in the film based on the first script draft; however, rewrites and additional content for his character changed his mind.|$|E
5|$|After {{discovering}} the burst's X-ray afterglow, the BeppoSAX team provided {{a more accurate}} localization, and what Metzger had {{assumed to be a}} variable star was still present in this smaller error box. Both the Caltech team and the Amsterdam team were <b>hesitant</b> <b>to</b> publish any conclusions on the variable object. On May10 Howard Bond of the Space Telescope Science Institute published his discovery, which was later confirmed to be the burst's optical afterglow.|$|E
5|$|After {{the success}} of Uyarndha Manithan, AVM Productions was keen to remake it in Hindi and {{approached}} Dilip Kumar. After watching the film, Kumar was <b>hesitant</b> <b>to</b> play the lead role as he felt he would not match Ganesan's performance in the original version. K. Balachander was signed {{up to be the}} director of the remake, which led to Kumar being initially convinced that he could be successful.|$|E

5|$|Bungie had {{previously}} released soundtracks for their games due to fan request, but Microsoft was <b>hesitant</b> <b>to</b> commit to producing a soundtrack for Halo; {{at the time}} most video games {{did not get a}} commercial soundtrack release.

5|$|Contemporary sources {{suggest that}} Morrone was <b>hesitant</b> <b>to</b> accept his {{election}} when {{word of the}} cardinals' decision reached his mountain-top hermitage. His ascetic life left him largely unprepared for the day-to-day responsibilities of the papacy, and he quickly fell {{under the influence of}} the Neapolitan monarchy of Charles of Anjou, to the dissatisfaction of even the pro-Angevin cardinals within the College. Celestine V resigned on 13 December 1294.|$|E
5|$|Gore was {{initially}} <b>hesitant</b> <b>to</b> accept {{a position as}} Bill Clinton's running mate for the 1992 United States presidential election, but after clashing with the George H. W.

Clinton stated that he chose Gore due to his foreign policy experience, work with the environment, and commitment to his family.|$|E

Feeling lonely, Principal Skinner eventually decides to re-enlist in the United States Army.|$|E
5|$|The 2nd Army's command {{structure}} fell apart as Bagration was evacuated {{from the battlefield}} and the report of him being hit quickly spread and caused morale collapse. Napoleon, who had been sick with a cold and was {{too far from the}} action to really observe what was going on, refused to send his subordinates reinforcements. He was <b>hesitant</b> <b>to</b> release his last reserve, the Imperial Guard, so far from France.|$|E
5|$|After September 1939, desperate {{efforts were}} made to improve the situation, but with very little result. Germany, for obvious reasons, delayed its deliveries; France was <b>hesitant</b> <b>to</b> equip an army that would not {{unequivocally}} take its side. The one abundant source of readily available weaponry, the Soviet Union, was inaccessible because the Dutch, contrary to most other nations, did not recognise the communist regime. An attempt in 1940 to procure Soviet armour captured by Finland failed.|$|E

50|$|The crimes {{considered}} {{to be part of}} the case took place between 22 August 1984 and 2 April 2005. The police have solved some of the murders, but with others, they are <b>hesitant</b> as <b>to</b> whether they are coincidences or the work of one or more serial killers.|$|R
50|$|The {{harmonic}} and stylistic {{structure of}} the piece {{may be viewed as}} a depiction of the journey from dusk till dawn. The piece evolves from uncertain and <b>hesitant</b> beginnings <b>to</b> an unequivocal C major finale, with its echoes of Wagner's Die Meistersinger von Nürnberg: indeed, at the premiere the overture to this opera was performed after the symphony.|$|R
5|$|After {{a costly}} legal battle over {{a real estate}} deal with William S. King and the {{financial}} downturn of the Panic of 1893, Menage's real estate empire collapsed and he fled the country to avoid prosecution on charges of embezzlement. The charges against Menage were eventually dropped after several key witnesses had died or become <b>hesitant</b> <b>to</b> testify against him. He spent the later portion of his life working in real estate in the New York City area and never worked in Minnesota again.|$|E
5|$|Another major {{childhood}} {{influence was}} Heigo Kurosawa, Akira's older brother by four years. In {{the aftermath of}} the Great Kantō earthquake of 1923, which devastated Tokyo, Heigo took the 13-year-old Akira to view the devastation. When the younger brother wanted to look away from the human corpses and animal carcasses scattered everywhere, Heigo forbade him to do so, instead encouraging Akira to face his fears by confronting them directly. Some commentators have suggested that this incident would influence Kurosawa's later artistic career, as the director was seldom <b>hesitant</b> <b>to</b> confront unpleasant truths in his work.|$|E
5|$|By 1972, McBride {{had made}} {{his way through the}} minor leagues to the Cardinals' Class AA {{affiliate}} in Little Rock. Though he was successful there and he received a promotion to the Class AAA team in Tulsa, he was initially <b>hesitant</b> <b>to</b> report there, wondering whether he was ready for Class AAA baseball. In his first at bat at the Class AAA level, McBride hit a ball off of the outfield wall and seemed to collect a triple, but he was called out for failing to touch second base.|$|E
40|$|Hesitant {{adaptive}} {{search is}} a stochastic optimisation procedure which accommodates hesitation, or pausing, at objective function values. It lies between pure adaptive search (which strictly improves at each iteration) and simulated annealing with constant temperature (which allows backtracking, or {{the acceptance of}} worse function values). In this paper we build on an earlier work and make two contributions; first, we link <b>hesitant</b> adaptive search <b>to</b> standard counting process theory, and second, we use this to derive the exact distribution {{of the number of}} iterations of <b>hesitant</b> adaptive search <b>to</b> termination. 8 page(s...|$|R
50|$|The march {{has sent}} a strong message <b>to</b> <b>hesitant</b> pro-democracy legislators <b>to</b> follow public opinion. The pro-government camp claims to have {{collected}} 700,000 signatures on a petition backing Mr. Tsang's reform package. This number, however, is widely seen as too small to influence pro-democracy lawmakers. The Reform Package debate has seen the return of key political figure and former Chief Secretary Anson Chan, raising speculations of a possible run up for the 2007 Chief Executive election, though she dismissed having a personal interest in standing for the next election.|$|R

5|$|Carroll was re-elected without {{opposition}} in 2008. In {{advance of the}} 2011 legislative session, he unsuccessfully ran for the open set of Senate Democratic floor leader, losing to R. J. Palmer of Winchester. Carroll blamed his contentious relationship with Senate President David L. Williams as the reason his colleagues were <b>hesitant</b> <b>to</b> choose him for the post. On November 6, 2012, he defeated Republican Frank Haynes to retain his seat for another four years. He was re-elected without {{opposition in}} 2016 from a district now comprising Anderson, Woodford, Franklin, Owen and Gallatin counties. His term expires December 31, 2019.|$|E
5|$|Deven {{approached}} Vadivelu in October 2005 {{and offered}} him the lead roles. Vadivelu was initially <b>hesitant</b> <b>to</b> accept the offer {{as he felt}} that the audience would not want to see him as the central character, but after Vadivelu read the script, he decided to take up the role. Regarding the selection of Vadivelu for the roles, Deven noted that one of the royal characters from his comic book strip in Ananda Vikatan closely resembled Vadivelu, including his complexion and nativity.|$|E
5|$|In 1952–53, South Africa's cricket {{authorities}} were <b>hesitant</b> <b>to</b> send their inexperienced team to Australia, fearing that the Test series would be uncompetitive. The Australian Board of Control's concern that—after losing {{money on the}} previous season's tour by the West Indies—the series would be another financial disaster resulted in South Africa offering an indemnity of ₤10,000 against any losses. Hassett began the season with two consecutive Sheffield Shield losses before the Tests, although he did manage 91 against South Australia before facing South Africa. He scored 123 in the return match {{later in the season}} and Victoria recorded two wins under his watch, against Queensland.|$|E

Mr. Harold quickly becomes irritated with the blind man. From that moment on, the macabre and dark-humored tale evolves into a bizarre journey of chaos and bedlam, with the once-routine life of Job Harold {{becoming}} a topsy-turvy disarray of self-survival.|$|R
5|$|In July 1992, the IOC {{voted to}} approve women's hockey as an Olympic event; {{it was first}} held at the 1998 Winter Olympics in Nagano. The Nagano Organizing Committee was <b>hesitant</b> <b>to</b> include the event because of the {{additional}} costs of staging the tournament, but an agreement was reached that limited the field to six teams, and ensured that no additional facilities would be built. The Canadian and American teams have dominated the event, typically losing only to each other. The United States won the first tournament in 1998. Canada won in 2002, 2006, 2010 and 2014.|$|E

Achara is <b>hesitant</b> <b>to</b> give him a tattoo, but she does so anyway and tells him there will be consequences. The next morning, he is beaten up by her brother and other locals and told to leave.|$|E
5|$|Later in 2010, Trenyce {{joined the}} Michael Jackson tribute concert revue Thriller – Live {{as the leading}} female vocalist during a European tour. She reprised her role when the show played at the Lyric Theatre in London's West End. She starred in the concert for three years, from 2010 until 2013, {{performing}} material from different periods in Jackson's career. In an interview with The Hollywood Reporter, Trenyce said that the audience was initially <b>hesitant</b> <b>to</b> hear a woman interpret Jackson's music. Theatreworld's Geoff Billingsley praised Trenyce's performance, writing that her voice sounded very similar to Jackson's and describing her as an improvement over the previous female lead Cleo Higgins.|$|E
