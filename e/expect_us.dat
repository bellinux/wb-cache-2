According to Morgan Lander, Spit is [...] "a dark album, but it's about every day life which isn't always peachy". According to Talena Atfield, the album's songs are about [...] "life experiences, basically. Oppression, people mistreating us, people putting you down because you're different, giving you a hard time because of who you are",which she said she experienced or saw in school. Spit was controversial because of its song titles, which made many people think that the album's songs are about sex. In an interview with NY Rock, Atfield said that none of the album's songs are about sex.|$|E

500|$|After {{less than}} five years as a judge, Denning was {{appointed}} a Lord Justice of Appeal on 14 October 1948. He was sworn in as a Privy Counsellor on 25 October 1948. As a Lord Justice of Appeal he continued to make reforming judgments in a variety of areas, particularly in family law and the rights of deserted wives. In 1952 the Court of Appeal heard Bendall v McWhirter [...] 2 QB 466 and ruled that a deserted wife occupying the marital home had a personal licence to stay there. The decision provoked disapproval among the judiciary and from the public; a correspondent wrote: Dear Sir: You are a disgrace to all mankind to let these women break up homes and <b>expect</b> <b>us</b> chaps to keep them while they rob us of what we have worked for and put us out on the street.

It's about temperament, and I just think the lad was too nervous for that today." [...] Despite losing their fourth consecutive Charity Shield match, Ferguson did not believe it would affect his team heading into the start of the season: [...] "We certainly hope we can go on to win the title again like we have in previous years. We just need to keep the standards up and show the desire we did in the second half." [...] He was also unsure whether Liverpool would be able to challenge for the Premier League: [...] "It's difficult to assess Liverpool at the moment. They started with confidence, but then you would expect that from a team that won three trophies a few months ago.
