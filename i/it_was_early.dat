5|$|Buckner had {{difficulty}} {{traveling to the}} West, and <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>early</b> summer before he arrived. He assumed command of the District of West Louisiana on August 4. Shortly after Buckner arrived at Smith's headquarters in Shreveport, Louisiana, Smith began requesting a promotion for him. The promotion to lieutenant general came on September 20. Smith placed Buckner {{in charge of the}} critical but difficult task of selling the department's cotton through enemy lines.|$|E

5|$|Double Dash {{was first}} shown at E3 2001 as a seven-second video clip. The clip {{featured}} Mario and Luigi driving their karts on a bump mapped 3D surface with no background. At the time, <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>early</b> in development, {{and the working}} title of the game was simply Mario Kart. In April 2003, Nintendo released the first pictures and details of the game, as well as revealing the title to be Mario Kart: Double Dash!!. At E3 2003, a playable demo of the game was available. New features, such as having two characters drive one kart, had been implemented. An updated demo with some new additions was shown at the Games Convention in August 2003. In September, Nintendo held a Gamers' Summit for the press, in which a nearly complete and more sped up version of Double Dash was displayed. The Gamers' Summit also announced the North American release date to be November 17, 2003.|$|E
5|$|Various feeding {{behaviours}} were proposed before {{more complete}} remains of Deinocheirus were known, and <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>early</b> on envisioned as a predatory, allosaur-like animal with giant arms. In their original description, Osmólska and Roniewicz {{found that the}} hands of Deinocheirus were unsuited for grasping, but could instead {{have been used to}} tear prey apart. In 1970, the Russian paleontologist Anatoly Konstantinovich Rozhdestvensky compared the forelimbs of Deinocheirus to sloths, leading him to hypothesise that Deinocheirus was a specialised climbing dinosaur, that fed on plants and animals found in trees. In 1988, Gregory S. Paul instead suggested that the claws were too blunt for predatory purposes, but would have been good defensive weapons. While attempting to determine the ecological niches for Deinocheirus and Therizinosaurus in 2010, Phil Senter and James H. Robins suggested that Deinocheirus had the largest vertical feeding range due to its hip height, and specialised in eating high foliage.|$|E

25|$|By January 1945 basic {{military}} training {{had become a}} comparatively minor part of Training Command's activities. Only three centers remained active--Amarillo, Sheppard, and Keesler.

25|$|Another {{three years}} later, the routing as it travels today, through Ball Ground {{to what is}} signed as SR5 Business, was {{designated}} as SR372; the northernmost portion of the route, connecting to what is I-575/SR5/SR515 today (which bypasses Ball Ground to its west), was still signed as SR5 at the time. <b>It</b> <b>was</b> <b>early</b> 1987 before this final stretch of SR372 was added to its designation and removed from a designation of SR5 Alternate.|$|E

25|$|Ullrich was {{inconspicuous}} in {{his first}} 18 months as a professional. In 1995 he became national time trial champion.

25|$|In Feb. 1992, {{he scored}} a memorable 131 against the touring West Bengal {{side in a}} 3-day match at Dhaka. Batting first the {{tourists}} scored 384/5 (decl.) left-handed No. 3 Raja Venkat scored 154, another more well known left-hander Sourav Ganguly made 129. In reply, the home side was struggling at 77/4. At this stage, Moni entered the wicket. With ever reliable Aminul Islam, he put on 104 for the 5th wicket. There was good understanding between the two, as {{they were involved in}} a number of vital partnerships down the order for Bangladesh. Aminul Islam went for 55, but Moni carried on ruthlessly demolishing the opposition bowling. Bangladesh eventually reached 302, thanks mainly to 131 by Moni. Aided by the tail enders, he went after the WB bowling. He was especially harsh on the slow bowlers, lofting them for a number of sixes. As the national stadium crowd were basking in afternoon sunshine (<b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>early</b> spring), they also enjoyed batting of the highest class.|$|E
25|$|The first American {{known to}} see the San Joaquin River was likely Jedediah Smith, a renowned {{mountain}} man, fur trapper and explorer. In 1826, Smith arrived in Mission San Gabriel Arcángel, California, when the region was under control of the Mexican government. As this was in violation of a law which prevented foreigners from entering California, {{and he could have}} been arrested for spying, he traveled north into the San Joaquin Valley, searching for populations of beaver. Smith noted the fertility and natural beauty of the area, and the apparent peace of the Native Americans living in the villages he passed. His expedition then turned east in an attempt to cross the Sierra Nevada. They tried to summit the range by way of both the Kings River and the American River (a tributary of the Sacramento), but <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>early</b> spring and the snow was too deep. Finally, they crossed the mountains along the Stanislaus River canyon, becoming the first recorded whites to cross the Sierra Nevada on foot. It is still disputed over whether Smith's party discovered gold on the San Joaquin or one of its tributaries. Although some of his men confirmed it, Smith did not make any mention of the precious metal in his journal.|$|E

500|$|On 31 May, Shackleton {{arrived in}} the Falkland Islands {{with the story of}} his escape after the loss of Endurance in the Weddell Sea. His first {{priority}} was to effect the rescue {{of the rest of the}} Weddell Sea party, stranded on Elephant Island, and <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>early</b> December before he arrived in New Zealand. He was too late to influence the organisation of the Ross Sea party's relief; the joint committee had appointed John King Davis to lead the expedition and had dismissed Stenhouse and Aurora's other officers. Davis was a veteran of Mawson's recent Australasian expedition, and had turned down Shackleton's offers in 1914 of the command of either Endurance or Aurora. As a gesture, Shackleton was permitted to sail as a supernumerary officer when the ship left on 20 December. On 10 January 1917, when Aurora reached Cape Evans, the survivors were astonished to see Shackleton approaching them; they then learned for the first time the futility of their labours. [...] After a further week spent in a vain search for the bodies of Mackintosh and Hayward, Aurora headed north for New Zealand, carrying the seven survivors of the original shore party.|$|E

2500|$|Not all {{the points}} of this {{traditional}} Thai story can be true as the entire northern campaign took just under five months (23 August 1765 to 20 January 1766). The Burmese chronicles do speak of [...] "petty chiefs" [...] stalling the northern army's advance but <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>early</b> in the campaign along the Wang river {{during the rainy season}} (August–October). The Burmese general who was actually stationed near Ayutthaya was not Thihapate but rather Maha Nawrahta, whose southern army waited for about a month for the northern army to show up. It appears that the three verified events—petty chiefs resisting Thihapate in the north, Thihapate's campaign period of five months, and Maha Nawrahta staking out by Ayutthaya—have merged to create this popular mythology.|$|E

2500|$|The French commanders {{disclosed}} {{that they knew}} that Racoon was {{in the area and}} that the three French vessels had sortied from Cumberland Harbour with the intent to take Racoon by boarding, using their superiority in numbers. Bissell was of the opinion that had the wind remained as calm as <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>early</b> in the morning, they might have succeeded, though at great cost. As it was, the French had over forty dead and wounded. Racoon had only one man injured. Though Racoon had little damage, only some shot to her sails, Bissell returned to port, stating that [...] "the very disabled State of the Prizes, and having expended nearly all the Shot on board, will, I hope, plead my excuse for returning to Port before I was regularly recalled." [...] The Lloyd's Patriotic Fund awarded Bissell an honour sword worth 100 guineas. Head money for 37 men, pronounced to have been aboard the Amitiė, was paid in December 1824.|$|E
2500|$|... "Conceived in the springtime of Italian hopes" [...] (as Budden {{describes}} the initial {{enthusiasm for the}} work), by the time Cammarano produced a final libretto <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>early</b> 1849 {{and it was also}} clear that the Austrians had not been permanently routed from Lombardy. The premiere was set for late January 1849, some last-minute adjustments were made, and Verdi traveled to Rome before the end of 1848. [...] At this point in the rise of Italian nationalism, Rome under Pope Pius IX was in turmoil and the Pope was held prisoner (without his Swiss guards), but he managed to escape to the south, hoping to negotiate his return. Within days of Battaglias totally sold-out premiere, Rome had become a republic, accelerated by the passions inflamed amongst its inhabitants by (amongst other things) the opera's final chorus of freedom: [...] "Italia risorge vestita di Gloria, invitta e regina qual'era sarà" [...] / [...] "Italy rises again robed in glory!, Unconquered and a queen she shall be as once she was!".|$|E
2500|$|<b>It</b> <b>was</b> <b>early</b> {{provided}} that, {{in seeking}} to remove one who wrongfully entered another's land with force and arms, a person could allege disseisin (dispossession) and demand (and pay for) a writ of entry. That writ gave him the written right to re-enter his own land and established this right {{under the protection of}} the Crown if need be, whence its value. In 1253, to prevent judges from inventing new writs, Parliament provided that the power to issue writs would thereafter be transferred to judges only one writ at a time, in a [...] "writ for right" [...] package known as a form of action. However, because it was limited to enumerated writs for enumerated rights and wrongs, the writ system sometimes produced unjust results. Thus, even though the King's Bench might have jurisdiction over a case and might have the power to issue the perfect writ, the plaintiff might still not have a case if {{there was not a single}} form of action combining them. Therefore, lacking a legal remedy, the plaintiff's only option would be petitioning the King.|$|E
