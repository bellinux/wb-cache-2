40|$|The <b>enhancement</b> of <b>sound</b> {{inside a}} two {{dimensional}} exponentially chirped crystal during the soft reflections of waves is experimentally and theoretically explored in this work. The {{control of this}} enhancement is achieved by a gradual variation of the dispersion in the system {{by means of a}} chirp of the lattice constant. The <b>sound</b> <b>enhancement</b> is produced at some planes of the crystal in which the wave is softly reflected due to a progressive slowing down of the sound wave. We find that the character of the <b>sound</b> <b>enhancement</b> depends on the function of the variation of dispersion, i. e., on the function of the chirp. A simple coupled mode theory is proposed to find the analytical solutions of the <b>sound</b> wave <b>enhancement</b> in the exponentially chirped crystal. Harmonic and time domain numerical simulations are performed to interpret the concept of the soft reflections, and to check the analytically calculated field distributions both in good agreement with experiments. Specially we obtain stronger <b>sound</b> <b>enhancement</b> than in linearly chirped crystals. This <b>sound</b> <b>enhancement</b> could motivate applications in energy harvesting, e. g., to increase the efficiency of detectors and absorbers. (C) 2014 Author(s).

40|$|Sound is an important, {{but often}} neglected, {{component}} {{for creating a}} self-motion illusion (vection) in Virtual Reality applications, for example, motion simulators. Apart from auditory motion cues, sound can provide contextual information representing self-motion in a virtual environment. In two experiments we investigated the benefits of hearing an <b>engine</b> <b>sound</b> when presenting auditory (Experiment 1) or auditory-vibrotactile (Experiment 2) virtual environments inducing linear vection. The addition of the <b>engine</b> <b>sound</b> to the auditory scene significantly enhanced subjective ratings of vection intensity in Experiment 1 and vection onset times but not subjective ratings in Experiment 2. Further analysis using individual imagery vividness scores showed that this disparity between vection measures was created by participants with higher kinesthetic imagery. On the other hand, for participants with lower kinesthetic imagery scores, the <b>engine</b> <b>sound</b> enhanced vection sensation in both experiments. A high correlation with participants' kinesthetic imagery vividness scores suggests {{the influence of a}} first person perspective in the perception of the <b>engine</b> <b>sound.</b> We hypothesize that self-motion sounds (e. g., the <b>sound</b> of footsteps, <b>engine</b> <b>sound)</b> represent a specific type of acoustic body-centered feedback in virtual environments. Therefore, the results may contribute {{to a better understanding of}} the role of self-representation sounds (sonic self-avatars), in virtual and augmented environments...|$|R

40|$|Abstract — This {{research}} uses an algorithm {{implemented by}} the use of a self-organizing feature map (SOFM) to analyze the similarities and differences between <b>engine</b> <b>sounds</b> to indicate their health status. A neural array feature map was subjected to variation of the parameters of the self-organizing map algorithm, improving map recognition quality. In this specific unsupervised computer learning study, we examined automobile <b>engine</b> <b>sounds</b> in varying degrees of health. With the results in the paper, we have shown how self-organizing feature maps can distinguish between engines of differing ages and health. With the results that were gathered from two tests with three sets each of <b>engine</b> <b>sounds</b> across three different domains, the clusters have shown that distinct differences between the engine sets contribute to the study of sound discrimination in a substantial way.

The chosen modes of operation are running in idle, at 2000 rpm and 3000 rpm with the vehicle stopped. Both gasoline and diesel engines were investigated.
