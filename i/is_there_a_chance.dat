How long will the strike last? Will strikers' jobs still be there if the strike fails? Are other strikers defecting from the strike?

40|$|On {{studying}} newly received {{material of}} Haplolobus, mostly from New Guinea, {{the key in}} Husson & Lam 1953 ¹) proved to be far from satisfactory in several respects. This is why all material now available {{has been given a}} critical consideration or reconsideration, as the case may be, and from this originated a new revision with a new key, which is presented here. Since the flowers of the various Haplolobus species are of the same type and very uniform, and since they are wanting in so many specimens either in one of the sexes or in both, it appeared, for the time being at least, unfeasible to use them for differential characteristics in the key. The same holds true for the fruits.

40|$|Efforts {{to improve}} {{schooling}} {{under the banner}} of raising standards are taking hold throughout New York State. The emphasis on standards means that all students must meet a range of expectations held by the standards designers. But <b>is</b> <b>there</b> <b>a</b> <b>chance</b> that the rhetoric about standards can improve the education of American Indian children? Given the enormous disparities in the cultural conditions of Aboriginal students, the attainment of standards suggests necessary structural changes in the curriculum, instructional methods and materials, and the standards used to judge performance. This paper looks more closely at the utilization of participatory research in a curriculum development and teaching project that addresses the intercultural or interethnic needs of American Indian students. The paper addresses itself to examining the crisis of the education of Aboriginal children and to developing a new school orientation that sees Aboriginal educational endeavors in a new light. The contexts and arguments suggest that whereas Aboriginal perspective to learning is useful in redefining old problems and proposing fresh alternatives, there are some grounds for careful optimism about what might be possible...|$|E
40|$|Oocyte {{freezing}} is {{an established}} technology but, {{in contrast to}} embryo freezing, it has very limited application in clinical IVF programmes. <b>Is</b> <b>there</b> <b>a</b> <b>chance</b> that oocyte freezing will become an integrated routine in assisted repro-ductive technology? The delicate cytological architecture of the oocyte with a cold-sensitive spindle and a hardening zona have made the frozen oocyte `unwanted ' in assisted reproductive technology. Nevertheless, empirical improve-ments in freezing protocols {{and the use of}} ICSI for fertilization have led to an increasing number of live births. This mitigates against a simple ban on oocyte freezing. While ef®ciency of oocyte freezing can certainly be further improved by basic research, it is clear that there are humanitarian reasons for considering oocyte freezing as a future fully utilized assisted reproductive technology. The storage of the female genome as a particulate entity can provide an alternative in case of moral, ethical, legal or religious concerns about embryo freezing. Oocyte freezing can also offer hope for oocyte donation and preservation of fertility for women facing ovarian loss. The message is one of cautious optimism when looking for a place for oocyte freezing in routine assisted reproductive technology.
