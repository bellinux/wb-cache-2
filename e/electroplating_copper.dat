Primary limitation of nanoindentation {{is that it does}} not measure quantitative mechanical properties such as yield strength, ultimate tensile strength and fracture strain unlike uni-axial tensile testing.

However, polymer packages are not hermetic and cannot be used for MEMS devices, which usually demand vacuum or low moisture environment inside the packages. This problem can be solved by applying atomic layer deposition (ALD) of nano-scaled Al 2 O 3 or other inorganic materials over the polymer packages. Defects and mechanical cracks in ALD coatings are major concerns for hermetic/vacuum sealing. Several techniques {{have been developed to}} inspect such defects and cracks. Assisted by the <b>electroplating</b> <b>copper</b> technique, we have reduced the defect density by 1000 times for an ultra-thin, 2 -nm ALD Al 2 O 3 film.
