When the lifebuoy was thrown overboard, the short cord pulled away two plugs, one to let sea water in and one to let gas out. For the mast-head distress signal light and the Deck Flare the two plugs were removed by hand and the units placed in a bucket of water.|$|R
5000|$|Diablo Cojuelo (Limping Devil): is {{the main}} {{character}} of the carnival. A tale on the island says that this devil was banished to earth because of his childish pranks. When he hit the earth he hurt his leg, causing him to limp. While most of the communities across the island represent this character in different ways, several common practices are {{the use of a}} mask, a satanic suit, sleigh bells, and a whip or [...] "Vejiga" [...] (an animal bladder <b>filled</b> <b>with</b> <b>air)</b> <b>to</b> hit people in the streets (other [...] "Diablos").

40|$|We perform direct {{numerical}} simulations (DNS) of tur-bulent Rayleigh-Bénard convection {{coupled with}} surface-to-surface radiation in a rectangular enclosure <b>filled</b> <b>with</b> <b>air</b> <b>to</b> investigate whether this interaction influences the heat trans-fer, temperature distribution {{and the flow}} structures. To do so, horizontal solid plates with finite conductivity are employed for the considered Rayleigh-Bénard cell.

5|$|The heavy dagger-like bill is evenly tapered and greyish, {{sometimes}} {{having a}} black tip. The bill colour and angle distinguish this species from the yellow-billed loon. The neck {{is short and}} thick. It swims very low in the water, with sometimes only its head held above and horizontal to water. It must run across the water surface to get in flight. During flight, its head is slightly lower than its body, with its feet trailing behind. It has a skeletal structure {{made up of a}} number of solid bones (this is usual for the Gaviiformes and penguins but unlike most flying birds which have bones with extensive pneumatization, hollow and <b>filled</b> <b>with</b> <b>air</b> <b>to</b> make the lighter), which adds weight but helps in diving.|$|R
5000|$|The {{following}} day, 40-year-old prisoner Gojko Vujičić, who {{had been}} wounded in the right thigh, swore blasphemous curses while demanding water {{to be given to}} him, and was subsequently taken to another room where he was shot and decapitated. The remaining prisoners were forced to kiss his head before it was hung on the wall for two days. Their legs were bound <b>with</b> an <b>air</b> hose, which prisoners later stated was <b>filled</b> <b>with</b> <b>air</b> <b>to</b> cause it to inflate, causing them great pain. Other prisoners allege they were administered electrical shocks. While bathing the prisoners, the Mujahideen were again met by members of the Bosnian Army who noted that there were [...] "about ten prisoners" [...] who were all able to walk to the bathing area on their own, and appeared to be in good health.|$|R

50|$|The task of {{creating}} a basic PAZ (Protivoatomnaya Zashchita) NBC protection system offering protection against the blast of a nuclear explosion and (radioactive) particulate filtration, but not against external gamma radiation or gas, {{was given to the}} KB-60 design bureau in Kharkov and was completed in 1956. The documentation was sent to Uralvagonzavod. It was decided to increase the tank's battle capabilities by changing the tank's construction and introducing new production technologies. Many of those changes were initially tested on the T-54M (Ob'yekt 139). The tank was fitted with the new V-55 12-cylinder 4-stroke one-chamber 38.88 litre water-cooled diesel engine developing 581 hp (433 kW). Greater engine power was accomplished by increasing the pressure of the fuel delivery and charging degree. The designers planned to introduce a heating system for the engine compartment and MC-1 diesel fuel filter. The engine was to be started pneumatically with the use of an AK-150S charger and an electric starter. This eliminated the need for the tank to carry a tank <b>filled</b> <b>with</b> <b>air.</b> <b>To</b> allow easier access during maintenance and repairs, it was decided to change hatches over the engine compartment. To increase the operational range, 300 L fuel tanks were added {{to the front of the}} hull, increasing the overall fuel capacity to 680 L.|$|R
50|$|The {{stacking}} of the bubblets {{is similar}} to aspirated fire fighting foam or compressed air foam systems, except that bubblets are water filled, whereas foam bubbles are only <b>filled</b> <b>with</b> <b>air.</b> Due <b>to</b> the high specific heat of water, it requires more energy to raise the temperature of water than air. Therefore, water-filled bubblets will absorb more heat than the air-filled foam bubbles (which are more effective for vapor suppression). When gel is applied to a surface such as an exterior wall, the water-filled bubblets can absorb much of the heat given off by the fire, thereby slowing the fire from reaching the wall.|$|R
50|$|To {{produce the}} {{traditional}} candy and coconut wraps, wafer slices, coconut flakes, sugar, water, cake flour are needed. First {{is to make}} the candy and coconut. Add white sugar to water, stir it and boil it until 120 degrees to make a syrup. Then pour the syrup into a bowl of cold water and cool it for a while. Use a round stick to drag the cooled syrup up and down for 10 minutes. <b>Fill</b> it <b>with</b> <b>air</b> <b>to</b> form the small tubes, then cool it again. Cut the cooled syrup into strips of 3 inches long, and add peanut powder; the candy and coconut is done.|$|R
50|$|Breeding {{generally}} {{occurs during}} flood season, {{during which time}} males prepare a pit nest. One or more females may use the same pit nest, into which they lay their eggs. The female(s) then leaves the nest and the male guards the nest from attack for the next 8 weeks; in addition, he regularly <b>fills</b> the nest <b>with</b> <b>air</b> <b>to</b> ensure that the newly-laid eggs survive.|$|R

50|$|Another {{important}} role of the larynx is abdominal fixation, a kind of Valsalva maneuver in which the lungs are <b>filled</b> <b>with</b> <b>air</b> in order <b>to</b> stiffen the thorax so that forces applied for lifting can be translated down to the legs.

60|$|I {{supposed}} {{that when the}} ship came near us she would stop and lower a boat, but {{there seemed to be}} no intention of the kind.

When the ship was just opposite to us, this man shouted something which I did not hear, and threw the life-preserver. It fell close to the raft. I thought, indeed, it was coming right into the midst of us. The red-faced man with the gold ear-rings was nearest to it. He made a grab at it, and missed it. On went the ship, and on went the life-preserver, skipping and dancing over the waves. They let out lots of line, but still the life-preserver was towed away.|$|R
5000|$|Balls are {{generally}} designated for indoor (generally made of leather or absorbent composites), or all-surface use (generally made of rubber or durable composites, {{also known as}} Indoor/Outdoor balls). Indoor balls tend to be considerably more expensive than all-surface balls due to cost of materials. In addition, brand new all-leather indoor balls must be [...] "broken in" [...] first to achieve optimal grip before use in competition. The abrasiveness of asphalt and the dirt and moisture present in an outdoor setting will usually ruin an indoor ball within {{a very short period}} of time, which is why an indoor/outdoor ball is recommended for recreational players.

5000|$|A sky anchor is {{a system}} of two {{balloons}} in tandem, with a [...] "zero-pressure" [...] lifting gas balloon tethered to a superpressure balloon [...] "anchor". The gas balloon is <b>filled</b> <b>with</b> a lifting gas and provides the buoyancy, while the superpressure balloon is <b>filled</b> <b>with</b> <b>air,</b> and pressurized <b>to</b> provide the desired ballast weight. In a passive sky anchor, the superpressure balloon is sealed, while in an active system, its pressure can be varied. Both versions have been tested in flight, but have had frequent failures with only occasional successful outcomes. The tandem arrangement makes launching difficult, and this complexity can lead to mission failure.|$|R
40|$|The {{shear wave}} {{velocity}} dependence on porosity was modelled using percolation theory model for the shear modulus porosity dependence. The obtained model is not a power law dependence (no simple scaling with porosity), but a more complex equation. Control parameters of this equation are {{shear wave velocity}} of bulk solid, percolation threshold of the material and the characteristic power law exponent for shear modulus porosity dependence. This model is suitable for all porous materials, mortars and porous rocks <b>filled</b> <b>with</b> liquid or gas. In the case of pores <b>filled</b> <b>with</b> gas the model can be further simplified: The term for {{the ratio of the}} gas density to the density of solid material can be omitted in the denominator (the ratio is usually in the range of (10 − 4, 10 − 3) for all solids). This simplified equation was then tested on the experimental data set for porous ZnO <b>filled</b> <b>with</b> <b>air.</b> Due <b>to</b> lack of reasonable data the scientists are encouraged to test the validity of proposed model using their experimental data...|$|R
500|$|Nigersaurus was [...] long, {{which is}} small for a sauropod, {{and had a}} short neck. It weighed around four tonnes, {{comparable}} to a modern elephant. Its skeleton was highly pneumatised (<b>filled</b> <b>with</b> <b>air</b> spaces connected <b>to</b> <b>air</b> sacs), but the limbs were robustly built. Its skull was very specialised for feeding, with large fenestrae and thin bones. It had a wide muzzle <b>filled</b> <b>with</b> more than 500 teeth, which were replaced at a rapid rate: around every 14 days. The jaws may have borne a keratinous sheath. Unlike other tetrapods, the tooth-bearing bones of its jaws were rotated transversely relative {{to the rest of}} the skull, so that all of its teeth were located far to the front.|$|R
50|$|Studies {{indicate}} that the city continues sinking at a relatively slow rate of 1-2mm per annum; therefore, the state of alert has not been revoked. In May 2003, Italian Prime Minister Silvio Berlusconi inaugurated the MOSE project (Modulo Sperimentale Elettromeccanico), an experimental model for evaluating the performance of hollow floatable gates; {{the idea is to}} fix a series of 78 hollow pontoons to the sea bed across the three entrances to the lagoon. When tides are predicted to rise above 110 centimetres, the pontoons will be <b>filled</b> <b>with</b> <b>air,</b> causing them <b>to</b> float and block the incoming water from the Adriatic Sea. This engineering work is due to be completed by 2018.|$|R
50|$|The Rothensee {{boat lift}} {{utilizes}} floats in float chambers {{in a similar}} manner to that at Henrichenburg. In this case only two float chambers were needed. The lift follows the patented plans of Rudolf Mussaeus.The trough is 85 metres long and 12.2 metres wide and is supported on two 36 metre long 10 metre in diameter cylindrical floats submerged in two 60 metre deep float chambers. The floats are internally sub-divided into three separate chambers. Each of these chambers is <b>filled</b> <b>with</b> <b>air</b> compressed <b>to</b> a pressure appropriate to its depth in the float chamber in order to prevent implosion. The floats provide buoyant lift equivalent to 5,400 tonnes, enough to balance the weight of the trough and its load of water and ship. The trough is set in motion using four worm geared shafts, 27.3 metres long and 42 centimetres in diameter moved by eight 44 kW electric motors. Because the trough and its load are in equilibrium with the floats only the friction opposing the troughs movement needs to be overcome by the motors. A complete lift can be achieved using less than 500 kW of power.|$|R

Haskin's plan was to excavate the tunnel, then <b>fill</b> it <b>with</b> compressed <b>air</b> <b>to</b> expel the water and to hold the iron plate lining in place.

30|$|The {{most common}} {{technique}} for measuring esophageal pressure employs an esophageal balloon <b>filled</b> <b>with</b> <b>air</b> connected <b>to</b> a long thin catheter [5, 6]. Appropriate filling volumes of <b>air</b> are required <b>to</b> minimize possible {{errors in the}} measurement of esophageal pressure [5, 6]. In addition, to limit possible pressure artifacts due to non-homogeneous compression of the esophagus by external structure, {{it has been suggested}} to place the esophageal balloon catheter in the lower two-thirds of the esophagus [11]. In spontaneously breathing patients, the conventional test to validate the correct position of esophageal balloon is performed during an end-expiratory occlusion maneuver with the simultaneous measurement of the changes in airway and esophageal pressure during an inspiratory effort (i.e., no air flow) (Baydur’s occlusion test) [12]. The position of the esophageal catheter is considered acceptable when the ratio between the changes in two pressures is close to unity. In healthy subjects with or without anesthesia, when the esophageal catheter was correctly positioned, it has been found that the difference between the changes in esophageal and airway pressure was lower than 15  % [12, 13]. Similarly, Milner et al. [14] found in spontaneous breathing babies that esophageal pressure well correlated with airway pressure supporting the validity of this occlusion test in infants too.|$|R
500|$|Because of her limited range, UB-8 {{would not}} have been able to make the entire journey to Turkey, so on 2 May, she was towed by the Austrian cruiser [...] from Pola down the Adriatic and through the Straits of Otranto. The duo {{continued}} until spotted by French forces near Kefalonia. UB-8 slipped the tow and Novara raced back into the Adriatic without incident. Two days after her departure, UB-8 was running on the surface when the stern of the boat suddenly dropped. The watch officer, on the conning tower with the helmsman and a lookout, was able to partially close the hatch before the entire submarine slipped below the waves, depositing the three men in the water. On board the submarine, water continued to pour in through the hatch and the boat was sinking by the stern. Voigt ordered the interior hatch to the control room sealed and all the ballast tanks <b>filled</b> <b>with</b> compressed <b>air</b> <b>to</b> increase buoyancy. The tactic returned UB-8 to the surface where the boat's diesel engines were restarted. Voigt circled back for the missing crewmen but only the watch officer and helmsman were recovered; the lookout had drowned.|$|R
