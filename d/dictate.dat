30|$|Equivalence-based {{instruction}} (EBI) {{can produce}} integration between verbal operants and derive one repertoire from another through {{the transfer of}} stimulus control (de Rose, de Souza, & Hanna, 1996; Mackay & Sidman, 1984; Sidman, 1986). Experimental studies have reported that populations with normal hearing first learn oral tacts (BD), and the accurate oral-textual operant (CD) is provided from equivalence relations that are formed (de Rose et al., 1996; Sidman, 1971). In an inverse route, children with CIs present improvements in oral-tact (BD) accuracy after EBI that includes oral-textual operants (CD) (Almeida-Verdu & Golfeto, 2016). In the study by Anastácio-Pessan et al. (2015), the participants were children with CIs who presented good oral-reading (CD) performance but inaccurate picture tacting (BD). Conditional relations between <b>dictated</b> words and pictures (AB) and between <b>dictated</b> words and printed words (AC word) were strengthened using an MTS procedure, including relations between <b>dictated</b> syllables and printed syllables (AC syllabic). The results showed that after strengthening equivalence relations (between <b>dictated</b> words, pictures, and printed words), accurate speech also started to occur under the presence of pictures. Analogously, Lucchesi et al. (2015) taught children with CIs who were not readers to relate pictures to <b>dictated</b> words (AB), printed words to <b>dictated</b> words (AC word), and printed syllables to <b>dictated</b> syllables (AC syllabic) using an MTS procedure. The training also included constructing printed words conditionally to <b>dictated</b> words using a constructed-response matching-to-sample (CRMTS) procedure. The participants learned to read and improved picture tacting.|$|R

5|$|Aided by his serve, Raonic employs an all-court {{style with}} an {{emphasis}} on short points. His groundstrokes are both good, but his forehand is stronger than his backhand.

He attempts to <b>dictate</b> play and is generally more aggressive than his opponent, as evidenced by usually having more winners and more unforced errors. To finish points quickly, Raonic occasionally approaches the net, with either a serve and volley or chip and charge strategy.|$|E
