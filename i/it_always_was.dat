25|$|This world, {{which is}} the same for all, no one of gods or men has made. But <b>it</b> <b>always</b> <b>was</b> and will be: an ever-living fire, with {{measures}} of it kindling, and measures going out. This latter phraseology is further elucidated:All things are an interchange for fire, and fire for all things, just like goods for gold and gold for goods.|$|E
25|$|At {{the start}} of the 21st Century, Oulton Park is still as popular as ever and still as {{demanding}} as it ever has been on drivers and riders, but, in common with so many circuits, it no longer hosts major international events. Gone are the glory days when all the major Formula One teams (including Scuderia Ferrari) came to Cheshire, now the major events on the circuit’s calendar are the twice-yearly visit of the British Superbike Championship and the annual visit of the British Touring Car Championship. This is no fault of the circuit management – it is just the way the sport has gone. But Oulton Park is still the great challenge <b>it</b> <b>always</b> <b>was.</b>|$|E
500|$|Part II: The [...] "Child of Our Time" [...] appears, {{enmeshed in}} the drama of his {{personal}} fate and the elemental social forces of our day. The drama is because the forces which drive the young man prove stronger than the good advice of his uncle and aunt, as <b>it</b> <b>always</b> <b>was</b> and always will be.|$|E

500|$|Reagan's {{health and}} {{well-being}} became a prominent concern in 2008. In February, she suffered a fall at her Bel Air home and was taken to Saint John's Health Center in Santa Monica, California. Doctors reported {{that she did not}} break her hip as feared, and she was released from the hospital two days later. News commentators noted that Reagan's step had slowed significantly, as the following month she walked in very slow strides with John McCain. NBC's Brian Williams, who attended a dinner with Reagan in mid-2008, recalled, [...] "Mrs. Reagan's vision isn't what <b>it</b> <b>always</b> <b>was</b> so she was taking very halting steps as a lot of folks her age do... It is so important for folks in her age bracket and in her bracket of life to remain upright and captain of their own ship. She very much is captain of her own ship." [...] As for her mental ability, Williams remarked, [...] "She's as sharp as ever and enjoys a robust life with her friends in California, but falling is always a danger of course. She's a very stoic, hardy person full of joy and excitement for life... She is not without opinions on politics and political types these days... She is, as most of her friends described her, a pistol." ...|$|E
2500|$|In 1962 Wascana Centre was begun, in {{an effort}} to make Regina as enjoyable and {{fulfilling}} for residents as it had long been the [...] "metropole" [...] for farmers and residents of small neighbouring towns.

2500|$|I {{recall a}} {{communal}} wash-room, I {{think it was}} at Kalgoorlie, which had several hand-basins, but a single mirror so that only one of us could shave at a time. The Australian patrons, unaccustomed to such intimate proximity to an Earl-Marshal and premier duke, let alone in pyjamas and before breakfast, made polite noises. [...] "After you, your Grace."

5000|$|After the film's release, Oz {{modified}} {{his earlier}} statements; [...] "I thought {{the film was}} really sweet and fun, a little too safe, a little retro. I prefer more cutting edge in the Muppets. But {{the main thing is}} everybody got back to appreciating The Muppets...it brought people back to The Muppets. Although they never really left, <b>it's</b> <b>always</b> <b>been</b> a kind of subculture, <b>it's</b> <b>always</b> <b>been</b> there in our popular culture a little bit.

2500|$|On 21 July, the German {{government}} told Jules Cambon, the French Ambassador in Berlin, and Bronewski, the Russian chargé d'affaires, {{that the}} German Reich {{had no knowledge}} of what Austrian policy was towards Serbia. In private, Zimmermann wrote that the German government [...] "entirely agreed that Austria must take advantage of the favourable moment, even at the risk of further complications", but that he doubted [...] "whether Vienna would nerve herself to act". Zimmermann ended his memo that [...] "he gathered that Vienna, timid and undecided as <b>it</b> <b>always</b> <b>was,</b> was almost sorry" [...] that Germany had given the [...] "blank cheque" [...] of 5 July 1914, instead of advising restraint with Serbia. Conrad himself was pressuring the Dual Monarchy for [...] "haste" [...] in starting a war, in order to prevent Serbia from [...] "smelling a rat and herself volunteering compensation, perhaps under pressure from France and Russia". On 22 July, Germany refused an Austrian request to have the German Minister in Belgrade present the ultimatum to Serbia because as Jagow had said, it would look too much [...] "as though we were egging Austria on to make war".|$|E

50|$|In May 1914, Fleischmann gave Fleischmanns Park to {{the village}} of Fleischmanns, New York. The park, which {{dominated}} the north side of Wagner Avenue in Fleischmanns, was formerly known as the Mountain Athletic Club. It was where the town's semiprofessional baseball players came to get in shape {{before the start of the}} regular season. (One of the town's players was the future Hall of Famer Honus Wagner.) Stipulations of Julius' gift <b>were</b> that <b>it</b> <b>always</b> <b>be</b> used as a park and athletic grounds, that <b>it</b> <b>always</b> <b>be</b> kept in good condition, that it never be sold or sublet, and <b>always</b> <b>be</b> of free access to the public.|$|R
