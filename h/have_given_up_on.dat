Bond appears to <b>have</b> <b>given</b> <b>up</b> <b>on</b> legal action for restraint of trade.|$|E
25|$|At Maltby Secondary School, Trueman had two {{teachers}} called Dickie Harrison and Tommy Stubbs who recognised his talent as a bowler and picked {{him for the}} school team, {{even though he was}} much younger than the other players. His school playing career was interrupted for two years after he was seriously injured by a ball that hit him in the groin. He started playing again in 1945 when he was fourteen but left school that summer to start work, initially in a newsagent's shop. He had several jobs before becoming a professional cricketer. Inhibited by his injury, Trueman might <b>have</b> <b>given</b> <b>up</b> <b>on</b> cricket at this time but instead, motivated by his family, he joined a nearby village club called Roche Abbey, playing regularly for them in 1946. He was successful at Roche Abbey and, before the 1947 season when he was sixteen, came to the notice of former Yorkshire player Cyril Turner who was coaching the Sheffield United Cricket Club which played at Bramall Lane, a ground then in regular use by Yorkshire for first-class cricket.|$|E
25|$|Rias {{develops}} {{feelings for}} Issei {{over the course}} of the series. In the storyline where she is to be Riser Phoenix's fiancee, she resigns her Rating Game against him in order to save Issei; however, after Issei subsequently defeats Riser, she kisses him and moves into his family's home. She does not mind being intimate with Issei, but gets upset when other girls want to steal him away. Later, Rias' mother, Venelana, encourages her to push her relationship further with Issei (in which Rias would attempt to seduce Issei), but gets upset when Issei could not call her by her name. Eventually, Issei finally professes his love for her and calls Rias by her first name instead of her President title. She cries tears of joy and tells him that she feels the same way and the two officially become a couple. Though it seems none of the other girls (Akeno, Xenovia, Asia, Koneko, Irina, Rossweisse and Ravel) <b>have</b> <b>given</b> <b>up</b> <b>on</b> Issei. She has also shown more tolerance towards Issei's dreams of becoming Harem King, even allowing everyone to make dates with Issei with the understanding that he will always return to her afterwards.|$|E

500|$|In 1870 he was {{appointed}} a judge of the Supreme Court of British Columbia and retired from his government post. Crease was suspicious of both Confederation and responsible government, largely because they threatened greater government control over judges and central Canadian domination of patronage. Like many British Columbians, he was disappointed that London seemed to <b>have</b> <b>given</b> <b>up</b> <b>on</b> BC as an independent colony, abandoning either it to annexation to the United States or confederation with Canada. [...] "I believe that England is sick of her Colonies," [...] he wrote, [...] "and to be a Colonist, whatever your POSITION & CHARACTER when at Home – is to lose Caste the moment you become a bona fide settler." [...] Regardless of his opposition to Confederation, Crease was chosen to prepare for it as {{the chair of the}} Royal Commission for the Revision of Laws of BC.|$|E
2500|$|Before {{the series}} finale, Gilligan {{said that it}} was {{difficult}} to write for Walter White because the character was so dark and morally questionable: [...] "I'm going to miss the show when it's over, but on some level, it'll be a relief to not have Walt in my head anymore." [...] Gilligan later said the idea for Walter's character intrigued him so much that he [...] "didn't really give much thought on how well it would sell," [...] stating that he would <b>have</b> <b>given</b> <b>up</b> <b>on</b> the premise since it was [...] "such an odd, dark story" [...] that could have difficulties being pitched to studios.|$|E
2500|$|Matxin and Gianetti {{travelled}} to Venezuela {{later in}} November, {{in the hope}} of instigating a sponsorship package from the country, primarily with the tourist board of the country. Venezuela – País de Sueño, had been reported to be interested about investing into the sport of cycling as a whole. Ten days later, Gianetti stated that the team had two concrete offers from potential backers, including the Venezuelans, and stated that he was hopeful of concluding a deal for the squad's continuation in 2012. On 6 December, team management were reported to <b>have</b> <b>given</b> <b>up</b> <b>on</b> finding a sponsor for the 2012 season, and decided to focus their attentions of finding their riders an alternative team to ride for. Matxin originally stated that he wished to continue looking for sponsors {{until the end of the}} year, but backtracked a week later, giving up on the search for a new backer. [...] team director Mike Tamayo later confirmed that Gianetti had approached him in November to consider a potential merger between the two teams, but plans did not materialise.|$|E

2500|$|Major's {{verdict on}} the ERM {{was that it}} was the {{medicine}} that cured Britain of inflation; [...] "it hurt but it worked." [...] Speaking a few days after Black Wednesday, the Governor of the Bank of England, Robin Leigh-Pemberton, argued that [...] "the decision to join the ERM two years ago in the circumstances; that, having joined, we were right to endeavour to stick it out; and that, in the circumstances which evolved, we were right to withdraw." [...] Lamont's view expressed in his memoirs was more nuanced: without the discipline of the ERM, the Major government would <b>have</b> <b>given</b> <b>up</b> <b>on</b> the fight against inflation before Black Wednesday; ERM membership delivered a sharp break in Britain's inflation performance; the judgment of the markets that the higher rates needed to maintain Britain's membership was undoubtedly correct; [...] "the ERM was a tool that broke in my hands when it had accomplished all that it could usefully do." [...] Sir Alan Budd, the Treasury's Chief Economic Adviser during the period and later appointed by Gordon Brown to the Monetary Policy Committee, in an economic assessment of Britain's membership of the ERM, has written, [...] "although it was certainly a political disaster, the case can be made that it was an economic triumph and marked the turning point in our macro-economic performance." ...|$|E
2500|$|Another {{trademark}} of the serial is its pre-occupation with {{the concepts of}} fate and soulmates. For {{the run of the}} series, the show established a few couples as [...] "fated" [...] and, with few short-lived exceptions, never mixed up any of the relationships. Some of the early [...] "fated" [...] couples were considered to be those of Luis and Sheridan, Ethan and Theresa, Miguel and Charity, and Chad and Whitney. Common indications of a couple's status as [...] "fated" [...] include (but are not necessarily limited to) Tabitha's desire to split said couple up, an unshakeable love that survives numerous break-ups and relationships with third parties, and/or an ability of one character, or perhaps both characters, to [...] "sense" [...] when his/her [...] "soulmate" [...] is in danger, as well as having shared past lives together in the case of Luis and Sheridan. However, despite the fact that each of these couples has existed as a storyline since the first episodes, the show seems to <b>have</b> <b>given</b> <b>up</b> <b>on</b> the [...] "fated" [...] angle as it approached its end. Ethan and Theresa are still in love and marry in the final episode, but Miguel is now in love with and marries Kay (not Charity), Luis falls in love with and marries Sheridan's niece Fancy, while Sheridan's formerly presumed dead husband Antonio returns to Harmony alive and well. Whitney left Chad after finding out about his affair with Vincent, and Chad later was shot dead by his father Alistair, leaving Whitney widowed and pregnant.|$|E
