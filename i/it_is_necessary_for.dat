Other elements in Zwingli's theology would lead him to deny that baptism {{is a means of}} grace or that <b>it</b> <b>is</b> <b>necessary</b> <b>for</b> salvation. His defence of infant baptism was not only a matter of church politics, but was clearly related to the whole of his theology and his profound sense of unity of the church.|$|E
5|$|Dancers in the United Kingdom {{have had}} success in hip-hop theater. In 2006, hip-hop dance company Boy Blue Entertainment won a Laurence Olivier Award for their show Pied Piper. In 2008, Into the Hoods {{became the first}} hip-hop theater show to perform in London's West End. It {{eventually}} {{went on to become}} the West End's longest running dance show ever. According to Clemente, the future of hip-hop dance is in theater; he believes <b>it</b> <b>is</b> <b>necessary</b> <b>for</b> the dance to make this transition in order for it to be legitimized as an art form.|$|E

5|$|Even if a {{differentiating}} {{measure is}} found, {{there is a}} strong presumption that it is constitutional. The legislature must necessarily have a wide power of classification in making laws that operate differently for different groups of people in order to give effect to its policy. Unless the law is plainly arbitrary, suggesting examples of arbitrariness are not ordinarily helpful in rebutting this presumption of constitutionality. It is presumed that Parliament knows best for its people, and is experienced in making laws directed at societal problems, hence its differentiation is based on adequate grounds. Therefore, to rebut this presumption <b>it</b> <b>is</b> <b>necessary</b> <b>for</b> the person challenging the law to adduce some material or factual evidence to show that it was enacted arbitrarily or had operated arbitrarily.|$|E
5|$|Stebbins and Edgar Anderson wrote a {{paper in}} 1954 on the {{importance}} of hybridization in adapting to new environments. They proposed novel adaptations would facilitate the invasion of habitats not utilized previously by either parent and that novel adaptations may facilitate the formation of stabilized hybrid species. Following this paper, Stebbins developed the first model of adaptive radiation. He proposed that a high degree of genetic variability was necessary for major evolutionary advances, that because of slow mutation rates, genetic recombination was the most likely source of this variation, and that variation could be maximised though hybridization. As of 2006, research is ongoing regarding whether hybridization is an accidental consequence of evolution or if <b>it</b> <b>is</b> <b>necessary</b> <b>for</b> the creation and evolution of plant species; {{it has been argued that}} contemporary studies are part of an intellectual lineage that started with the work of Stebbins and Anderson.|$|E
5|$|The player {{controls}} the protagonist from an overhead perspective and navigates him throughout the fictional region of Kanto in {{a quest to}} master Pokémon battling. The goal of the games is to become the champion of the Indigo League by defeating the eight Gym Leaders and then the top four Pokémon trainers in the land, the Elite Four. Another objective is to complete the Pokédex, an in-game encyclopedia, by obtaining the 150 available Pokémon. Red and Blue utilize the Game Link Cable, which connects two games together and allows Pokémon to be traded or battled between games. Both titles are independent of each other but feature the same plot, and while they can be played separately, <b>it</b> <b>is</b> <b>necessary</b> <b>for</b> players to trade among both games {{in order to obtain}} all of the first 150 Pokémon.|$|E
