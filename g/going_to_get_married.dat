50|$|Inheritance has a {{significant}} effect on stratification. Inheritance is an integral component of family, economic, and legal institutions, and a basic mechanism of class stratification. It also affects the distribution of wealth at the societal level. The total cumulative effect of inheritance on stratification outcomes takes three forms. The first form of inheritance is the inheritance of cultural capital (i.e. linguistic styles, higher status social circles, and aesthetic preferences). The second form of inheritance is through familial interventions in the form of inter vivos transfers (i.e. gifts between the living), especially at crucial junctures in the life courses. Examples include during a child's milestone stages, such as <b>going</b> <b>to</b> college, <b>getting</b> <b>married,</b> <b>getting</b> a job, and purchasing a home. The third form of inheritance is the transfers of bulk estates at the time of death of the testators, thus resulting in significant economic advantage accruing to children during their adult years. The origin of the stability of inequalities is material (personal possessions one is able to obtain) and is also cultural, rooted either in varying child-rearing practices that are geared to socialization according to social class and economic position. Child-rearing practices among those who inherit wealth may center around favoring some groups {{at the expense of others}} at the bottom of the social hierarchy.|$|R

The chorus was rewritten, and the line [...] "Skin tight jeans" [...] was taken from the early [...] "trying me on" [...] version. When the final version was finished, McKee said, [...] "We were all so pumped that it had paid off. I remember Max sitting back and saying 'I wish we could bottle this feeling'. It was really magical." [...] Perry commented that even though the song was rewritten many times, she was [...] "so happy <b>to</b> finally <b>get</b> somewhere that we all agreed on" [...] after it was finished.

It's intense being in love and being a teenager." [...] After confirming that [...] "Teenage Dream" [...] was also the title of the album, she explained that it was a throwback to her teenage years, as she thought back to her youth while contemplating marriage to her boyfriend Russell Brand.

Seeing that their daughter is adamant, and relieved that an elopement has been averted, Tanu's parents accepts the situation, albeit unwillingly.|$|R
