5|$|Salford's built <b>environment</b> <b>is</b> {{made up of}} a {{range of}} {{building}} stock. Some inner-city areas are noted for chronic urban decay. Salford's housing stock is characterised by an oversupply of older, smaller terraced housing and flatted accommodation that declined in value during the late 20th century. As demand fell, it left many owners in negative equity and often without the means to maintain their homes in reasonable condition. As a result, much of the built <b>environment</b> <b>is</b> poor.|$|E

5|$|An {{overhead}} or penetration diving <b>environment</b> <b>is</b> {{where the}} diver enters a space from {{which there is}} no direct, purely vertical ascent to the safety of breathable atmosphere at the surface. Cave diving, wreck diving, ice diving and diving inside other natural or artificial underwater structures or enclosures are examples. The restriction on direct ascent increases the risk of diving under an overhead, and this is usually addressed by adaptations of procedures and use of equipment such as redundant breathing gas sources and guide lines to indicate the route to the exit.|$|E

5|$|Camouflage {{in large}} {{bodies of water}} differs {{markedly}} from camouflage on land. The <b>environment</b> <b>is</b> essentially the same on all sides. Light always falls from above, and there is generally no variable background to compare with trees and bushes. Three main camouflage methods predominate in water: transparency, reflection, and counter-illumination. Transparency and reflectivity are most important in the top 100 metres of the ocean; counter-illumination is the main method from 100 metres down to 1000 metres; while camouflage becomes less important in the dark waters below 1000 metres.|$|E
5|$|Despite Hong Kong's {{reputation}} of being intensely urbanised, the territory has tried to promote a green environment, and recent growing public concern has prompted the severe restriction of further land reclamation from Victoria Harbour.

Approximately 80% of the city's smog originates {{from other parts of}} the Pearl River Delta.|$|E
50|$|Fourth generation. These <b>environments</b> <b>are</b> {{also known}} as 4GL {{standing}} for fourth generation language environments {{due to the fact}} that the early <b>environments</b> <b>were</b> designed around specific languages such as Visual Basic.

Flying through a nebula involves impaired vision, and occasional disruptions to flight electronics. Nebulae have become known as an eerie and suspenseful arena of play.|$|E

5|$|In {{ordinary}} circumstances, transduction, conjugation, {{and transformation}} involve transfer of DNA between individual bacteria {{of the same}} species, but occasionally transfer may occur between individuals of different bacterial species and this may have significant consequences, such as the transfer of antibiotic resistance. In such cases, gene acquisition from other bacteria or the <b>environment</b> <b>is</b> called horizontal gene transfer and may be common under natural conditions. Gene transfer is particularly important in antibiotic resistance as it allows the rapid transfer of resistance genes between different pathogens.|$|E

5|$|Promotion: A {{communication}} with the market should put stress on environmental aspects, for example that the company possesses a CP certificate or is ISO 14000 certified.

Third, sponsoring the natural <b>environment</b> <b>is</b> also very important. And last but not least, ecological products will probably require special sales promotions.|$|E
5|$|Sale's built <b>environment</b> <b>is</b> varied, with {{a mixture}} of modern and old buildings. Some terraces, semi-detached houses and villas, survive from the Victorian period, {{although}} many of the larger houses have been converted into flats. Many semi-detached houses survive from the 1930s, when there was a need for new housing in the town {{as a result of a}} growing population and an increasingly wealthy middle class. Interspersed with these older structures are newer housing developments, such as the estates built in Ashton upon Mersey and the east of Sale during the 1970s.|$|E

5|$|Seamounts are {{exceptionally}} {{important to}} their biome ecologically, but their role in their <b>environment</b> <b>is</b> poorly understood. Because they project out above the surrounding sea floor, they disturb standard water flow, causing eddies and associated hydrological phenomena that ultimately result in water movement in an otherwise still ocean bottom. Currents have been measured at up to 0.9knots, or 48centimeters per second. Because of this upwelling seamounts often carry above-average plankton populations, seamounts are thus centers where the fish that feed on them aggregate, in turn falling prey to further predation, making seamounts important biological hotspots.|$|E
