A key policy issue is that investment in many intangible assets, such as R&D, design and new business processes may produce spillovers in the economic system thus stimulating economic growth.

40|$|Why did the Great Recession lead {{to such a}} slow recovery? I build a model where {{heterogeneous}} firms {{invest in}} physical and in intangible capital, and can default on their debt.

This differential is exacerbated in a financial crisis, when default is more likely and aggregate risk bears a higher premium. The resulting fall in <b>intangible</b> <b>investment</b> amplifies the financial crisis, and gradual intangible capital spillovers to other firms contribute to its persistence. Using a rich panel dataset of Spanish manufacturing firms, I estimate the model by matching firm-level moments regarding physical and <b>intangible</b> <b>investment</b> and financing.

40|$|Investment {{in capital}} is {{important}} for economic growth. But capital is not just physical assets; firms also invest in 'soft' capital such as knowledge, firm-specific skills, and better ways of doing business. This investment results in accumulation of 'intangible assets'. Intangible assets have been categorised as computerised information, innovative property (including R&D) and economic competencies (including firm-specific human capital and organisational capital), and most are difficult to measure. These assets can depreciate more rapidly than physical capital, but they are investments nonetheless, delivering benefits over time, {{not just in the}} period the expenditure was made. Many elements of spending on intangibles are treated as a current expense in the national accounts rather than as an investment. This leads to an understatement of investment in the economy. It also may affect measures of multifactor productivity (MFP) growth. Applying the methodology of Corrado, Hulten and Sichel (2006) found that <b>intangible</b> <b>investment</b> currently is almost half the size of tangible investment in the market sector of the Australian economy. While experimental in nature, the estimates suggest that - market sector investment in intangibles was $ 57 billion in 2005 - 06, 80 per cent of which is currently not treated as investment in the national accounts; average annual growth in <b>intangible</b> <b>investment</b> has been about 1. 3 times that of tangibles since 1974 - 75; including <b>intangible</b> <b>investment</b> in total investment largely removes the past downward trend in the market sector ratio of investment to output (gross value added); investments in organisational capital (strategic planning, adaptation and reorganisation) and computerised information have grown at relatively high rates — making up 27 and 13 per cent of <b>intangible</b> <b>investment</b> in 2005 - 06. Treating investment in intangible assets as capital raises measured final output and measured capital inputs and alters the capital-labour ratio, hence the effect on measured MFP growth is complex. However, in Australia, adjusting for <b>intangible</b> <b>investment</b> not currently included in the national accounts does not have a large direct effect on the level or pattern of conventionally-measured MFP growth.

This difference in the market's information causes {{a change in the}} behavior of market prices, inducing changes in the firm's investments and cash flows. Thus, from a "real effects" perspective, measuring intangibles is not unambiguously desirable. We identify the conditions under which providing information on intangibles may be desirable. This study also shows the inadequacy of statistical associations between accounting numbers and prices as a basis for evaluating the desirability of measuring <b>intangible</b> <b>investments.</b> We show that the measurement of intangibles alters the very distribution of cash flows about which the measurement regime is seeking to provide information.
