40|$|This paper {{establishes}} {{the current state}} of the art in the subject of iceberg and bergy bit motion during interaction and impact with offshore structures. Our particular interest in the present case is the influence of hydrodynamic interaction on change in velocity as small ice masses approach a larger structure in open water. Iceberg impacts are a design driver for structures located in offshore regions subject to drifting glacial ice. It is found that although many studies note that near-field effects influence the velocity and trajectory of drifting bergs prior to impact, the understanding of near-field hydrodynamic effects such as negative wave drift force, <b>fluid</b> <b>cushioning,</b> shadowing, reduction in impact velocity, and hydrodynamic damping, is incomplete. These effects are more obvious for small ice masses and bergy bits and although they have been identified qualitatively, there is very little quantitative information available. The inability to properly account for these phenomena generally leads to overestimation in impact velocity and consequently input impact energy. Better understanding of hydrodynamic interaction between small icebergs and offshore structures in very close proximity could improve load predictions by improving the estimation of input energy.

40|$|The medium {{offering}} the greatest {{resistance to heat}} transfer from the freeze-drying shelf to the moving and subliming surface is {{the space between the}} flat shelf top and the concave vial bottom. The resistance to heat transfer can be greatly reduced by improving the thermal conductivity of the intervening space. Several heat transfer augmentation devices, including a multilayered corrugated aluminum quilt and a conformable <b>fluid</b> <b>cushion</b> device, which fill this gap are described. The devices are inexpensive and easy to use. Experimental data show that the resistance of the intervening space is reduced appreciably and the drying rate is greatly increased. The <b>fluid</b> <b>cushion</b> device is superior to the aluminum quilt as it reduces the consequences of spillage of solution and provides greater intervial uniformity among the same batch of vials. Drying times obtained in experiments with and without the <b>fluid</b> <b>cushion</b> device are compared here for different sizes and different types of vials. Product evaluation is conducted by measuring the reconstitution time and observing the product under a microscope. The solubilities of two univalent electrolytes, sodium chloride and potassium chloride, have been measured in eight cosolvent-water binary systems. The solubility of both the solutes {{has been found to be}} adequately described by the log-linear solubility equation, log S(m) = log S(w) + fσ. The rank order of the desolubilization slopes obtained for the electrolyte solutes is compared with the solubilization of nonelectrolyte solutes. These results indicate that a cosolvent which is most effective in solubilizing a nonelectrolyte is also most effective in desolubilizing an electrolyte. The solubility of oxacillin sodium in methanol-water mixtures has been determined at various temperatures ranging from + 21 to - 26 degrees centigrade. The data has been fitted to the log-linear relationship as proposed by Yalkowsky et. al. The heat of solution is determined using the van't Hoff equation and was found to be nearly constant at 1. 2 Kcal/mole. There appears to be no dependency of the slope of the log S(m) vs. fraction cosolvent plot to the temperature. The data suggests that there is a polymorphic or amorphic transition of oxacillin at - 14. 5 degrees centigrade...|$|R

40|$|CONTEXT: Endoscopic mucosal {{resection}} is {{an established}} modality for excision of sessile lesions in the gastrointestinal tract. Submucosal fluid injection creates a cushion and may prevent thermal injury and perforation. OBJECTIVES: This blind {{study investigated the}} performance of three different solutions to create submucosal <b>fluid</b> <b>cushions</b> in porcine stomach. METHODS: Three solutions were injected in the stomach of nine pigs BR 1 : normal saline solution, carboxymethylcellulose 0. 5 % and hydroxypropyl methylcellulose 0. 25 %. In each pig, submucosal injections with 6 mL per test-solution were performed. One drop of methylene blue was added to all injections for better visualization. The time for the bleb to disappear was recorded. RESULTS: The overall median time of visible submucosal cushion was 37 minutes (range 12 - 60 min) for hydroxypropyl methylcellulose, 31 minutes for carboxymethylcellulose (range 10 - 43 min) and 19 minutes for normal saline solution (range 8 - 37 min). There was {{no statistically significant difference}} neither between normal saline solution and carboxymethylcellulose (P = 0. 146) nor carboxymethylcellulose and hydroxypropyl methylcellulose (P = 0. 119) but the median duration of hydroxypropyl methylcellulose was significantly longer than normal saline solution (P = 0. 039). CONCLUSIONS: The length of hydroxypropyl methylcellulose submucosal <b>fluid</b> <b>cushion</b> is longer in comparison with normal saline solution. The median time for carboxymethylcellulose was not longer than normal saline solution. Hydroxypropyl methylcellulose, in the concentration of 0. 25 %, may be a durable alternative for submucosal injection...|$|R
40|$|Background and Aims: Submucosal {{injection}} of a viscoelastic solution prolongs submucosal lift, thus, facilitating endoscopic mucosal resection. Our {{objective was to}} assess the safety and clinical effectiveness of 0. 4 % hydroxypropyl methylcellulose (HPMC) as a submucosal injectant for endoscopic mucosal resection. Patients and Methods: A prospective, open-label, multicenter, phase 2 study was conducted at 2 academic institutions in Brazil. Eligible participants included patients with early gastrointestinal tumors larger than 10 mm. Outcomes evaluated included complete resection rates, volume of HPMC injected, duration of the submucosal cushion as assessed visually, histology of the resected leisons, and complication rates. Results: Over a 12 -month period, 36 eligible patients with superficial neoplastic lesions (stomach 14, colon 11, rectum 5, esophagus 3, duodenum 3) were prospectively enrolled in the study. The mean size of the resected specimen was 20. 4 mm (10 to 60 mm). The mean volume of 0. 4 % HPMC injected was 10. 7 mL (range 4 to 35 mL). The mean duration of the submucosal <b>fluid</b> <b>cushion</b> was 27 minutes (range 9 to 70 min). Complete resection was successfully completed in 89 %. Five patients (14 %) developed immediate bleeding requiring endoclip and APC application. Esophageal perforation occurred in 1 patient requiring surgical intervention. There were no local or systemic adverse events related to HPMC use over the follow-up period (mean 2. 2 mo). Conclusion: HPMC solution (0. 4 %) provides an effective submucosal <b>fluid</b> <b>cushion</b> and is safe for endoscopic resection of early gastrointestinal neoplastic lesions...|$|R

40|$|Endoscopic mucosal {{resection}} (EMR) and endoscopic submucosal dissection (ESD) {{have provided}} new alternatives for {{minimally invasive treatment}} of gastrointestinal adenomas and early-stage cancers that involve a minimum risk of lymph-node metastasis.

40|$|A 72 -year-old female with a colonic {{laterally}} spreading tumor (LST) {{was referred}} to our department. A total colonoscopy revealed a large nongranular LST, 30 mm in diameter, in the ascending colon.

After a circumferential incision around the lifted lesion with a submucosal <b>fluid</b> <b>cushion,</b> diffuse adipose tissue was observed in the submucosal layer beneath the lesion. The endoscopic view was blurred when dissecting the submucosal layer due to fat adhering to the lens. Since this {{made it difficult to}} continue the procedures, we infused water into the lumen and kept the endoscope tip immersed in the collected water. The resulting improved view made it possible to complete all procedures without withdrawing the endoscope to wipe the lens. The lesion was successfully resected en bloc without complications.

40|$|AbstractBackground and aimsEndoscopic mucosal {{resection}} (EMR) is {{a well-established}} method {{for the removal}} of neoplastic polyps throughout the GI tract. EMR typically involves insufflation of the lumen using air or CO 2, followed by submucosal lifting of a polyp to minimize the risk of deep tissue injury and perforation, followed by hot-snare polypectomy. Underwater endoscopic mucosal resection (UEMR) is a new technique that uses water to enable lesion visualization in a lumen that is not distended by air or CO 2, followed by piecemeal hot-snare resection of large mucosally-based neoplasms. UEMR does not require submucosal injection to create a <b>fluid</b> <b>cushion.</b> Very few published examples of UMER in the duodenum exist.

The gelatinous coat that encapsulated the egg is a characteristic of Silurifomes, a form of protection for the egg whether adhesive or not (da Rocha et al. 2009) and for attachment to substratum. The adhesive and non-adhesive natures of Siluriformes egg explain the chemical composition of the gelatinous coat (Rizzo et al. 2002; da Rocha et al. 2009).

40|$|Abstract: Owing to fluid pressure, the {{unsupported}} blank {{between the}} punch and the drawing ring is bulged {{in the direction}} opposite to the punch movement. The blank is thus drawn over a <b>fluid</b> <b>cushion</b> and does not contact the drawing ring profile radius. The bulge is hence advanta-geous for ensuring class A surface quality of the workpiece. The blank is stretched bi-axially in the bulged region owing to the acting fluid pressure. This can result in blank fracture at high-fluid counter pressures. High-fluid counter pressures are, however, necessary to achieve higher geometrical accuracies and lower springback. High pressure {{can also be used}} to transfer small contours from the punch to the drawn cup. A high-pressure die set for hydraulic bulging has been designed in order to emulate the bulge formation in hydromechanical deep drawing. A series of experiments have been carried out in order to determine the limiting bulge height for different sheet materials. Different punch diameters have been used to determine the influ-ence of drawing clearance on the limiting bulge height. The effect of fluid pressure on the smallest transferable radius has also been investigated. Results thus obtained can be used in determining the dedicated optimal counter pressure curve for a given workpiece geometry, material, and die set combination in order to design a robust computer-aided engineering (CAE) chain for the hydromechanical deep drawing process. Selected representative experi-mental results for hydromechanical deep drawing of complex part geometries have been shown. The counter pressure curve for hydromechanical deep drawing of the shown cups was selected in conformance to the allowable bulge height for the considered instantaneous sheet material, part shape, and process parameter combination...|$|R

In flat mucosal tumors, normal saline is frequently used for submucosal fluid injection {{in order to reduce}} the risk of complications during endoscopic resection. Recent studies have demonstrated longer-lasting mucosa elevation by injection of agents such as hyaluronic acid or glyceol, rather than normal saline. We investigated the efficacy of different blood components in comparison with other solutions for use as a submucosal <b>fluid</b> <b>cushion.</b> Methods: Normal saline, sodium hyaluronate, glyceol, hydroxyethyl starch, serum, plasma, and whole blood were evaluated for their effectiveness in creating a submucosal cushion. One milliliter of each solution was injected into the submucosa of 5 &times; 5 cm specimens of resected porcine stomach. Mucosa elevation was measured before and up to 60 minutes after injection. Results: The shortest duration of mucosa elevation was observed after injection of normal saline, glyceol, and 0. 125 % hyaluronic acid. A significantly longer duration was obtained after injection of hydroxyethyl starch, 0. 25 % and 0. 5 % hyaluronic acid, serum, and plasma. However, whole blood generated a longer-lasting mucosa elevation than all other agents. Conclusion: The results of the current study suggest that whole blood is more effective in generating long-lasting mucosa elevation than any other commonly used solution. Because autologous blood is readily available at almost no cost, this seems to be an optimal agent for creating the mucosa elevation needed for endoscopic resection. Further in vivo studies in humans are needed to clarify the potential role of autologous blood for long-lasting endoscopic mucosa resection or endoscopic submucosal dissection.

The centrifugation process, however, has potential deleterious effects, including reduction in sperm quality as well as loss of sperm numbers. Since centrifugation plays such a crucial role in semen processing, two experiments were designed to evaluate more efficient centrifugation methods to meet the demands of the equine industry. In Experiment 1, semen was centrifuged in two different tube types (nipple- or conical-bottom), using a cushioned technique (Eqcellsire? Component B) with two different extenders (opaque-INRA 96 or clear-HGLL). For Experiment 2, nipple-tube centrifugation was conducted at two different g forces (400 or 600) for 20 min, using three different iodixanol cushion media, Eqcellsire? Component B, OptiPrep?, or <b>Cushion</b> <b>Fluid?.</b> Regardless of tube or extender types, centrifugation of semen resulted in sperm recovery rates ? 90 %; however, centrifugation in INRA 96 extender yielded higher sperm motility values than did centrifugation in HGLL extender (P 0. 05).

An optically opaque extender, as is typically used in the equine breeding industry, can be used to achieve this goal.
