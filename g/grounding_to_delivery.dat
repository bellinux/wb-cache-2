40|$|Purpose: The aim of {{this study}} was to develop a {{computerised}} notation system to collect data from the same amount of group one day games played by each team in the 2016 Royal London one day cup competition. This computerised notation system was used to highlight possible causes of wickets from incidences that occurred prior to the dismissal. Method: Analysis was conducted on a total of 14 innings from seven games played in a season. These games met the inclusion criteria because all teams were of a similar level to avoid one sided games (Hughes et al., 2001). Analysis was conducted on the top seven batters during all batting innings. This is due to the general strategy used by cricket teams to place the better batsman near the beginning of the order and the weaker batsman near the end of the order (Swartz, Gill & Beaudoin, 2006). Data collection was conducted on SportsCode (V 10. 1, Sportstec Ltd, Warriewood, NSW, Australia). Results: A significant difference was found between; delivery outcome during the build up to dismissals (χ 2 (5) = 1818. 511, p < 0. 001), pitch map analysis during the build up to dismissals (χ 2 (5) = 393. 486, p < 0. 001), pitch map analysis of wicket taking deliveries (χ 2 (11) = 94. 620, p < 0. 001) and wagon wheel analysis during the build up to dismissals (χ 2 (5) = 393. 486, p < 0. 001) when compared to the uniform distribution expected by chance. There was no significant difference between the amount of deliveries spent on or off strike (χ 2 (1) = 0. 270, p = 0. 603) compared to the uniform distribution expected by chance. Conclusion: The findings are a tool for coaches and batters to highlight possible strategies to avoid losing wickets, as well as strategies for fielding teams to encourage wicket taking. The results of this study suggest bowlers should look to bowl a variety of lines and lengths while consistently bowling a good length on off stump most often, as this area leads to wicket taking. Bowlers should aim to bowl dot balls, bowl an off stump line and use the short ball as a surprise <b>delivery.</b> <b>To</b> avoid losing their wicket, batsman should look to be aggressive and hit boundaries more often, reduce dot balls and hit straight down the <b>ground</b> <b>to</b> <b>deliveries</b> that promote LBW and bowled dismissals...|$|R

Genotyping analysis of ADRB 2 gene (rs 1042713, rs 1042714, rs 1042717, rs 1042718, and rs 1042719) was performed on 137 patients with preterm labor. Survival analysis was conducted {{for the effects of}} SNPs on the median time <b>to</b> <b>delivery</b> as a primary outcome. The median time <b>to</b> <b>delivery</b> in the study patients was 349. 3 h. Gestational age at admission and modified Bishop scores revealed significant effects on time <b>to</b> <b>delivery</b> (p < 0. 001).

40|$|This study {{measured}} the decision <b>to</b> <b>delivery</b> time intervals in non-elective caesarean sections and compared {{them to the}} 30 -min interval suggested by international literature. It also evaluated fetal outcome. A 3 -month prospective evaluation of all (n= 178) non-elective caesarean sections was performed, using a structured time and data sheet, in a tertiary centre. Operations were divided into 'emergency', most pressing and 'urgent' where maternal or fetal compromise were not immediately life-threatening. The median interval for the 100 emergency cases was 48 min, and 59 min for the 78 urgent cases. Only 28 (15. 7 per cent) of decision <b>to</b> <b>delivery</b> intervals were within 30 min. Twenty-two babies (12. 4 per cent) had Apgar scores of below 7 at 5 min. Most decision <b>to</b> <b>delivery</b> intervals exceeded 30 min. It may be wiser to train staff to recognize and respond appropriately to emergencies than insisting on rigid decision <b>to</b> <b>delivery</b> intervals. © Oxford University Press 2005; all rights reserved.

40|$|Background: Early {{recognition}} of the {{signs and symptoms of}} preterm labor (PTL) is important in order to establish treatment. Our aim was to determine the relation between cervical dilatation and time interval from admission <b>to</b> <b>delivery</b> in women with preterm labor. Materials and Methods: A retrospective cohort study was conducted on 83 singleton gestations admitted for preterm labor between 24 weeks and 34 weeks, who subsequently delivered preterm. Women were categorized into three groups of cervical dilatation (0 - 2 cm, 3 - 6 cm, > 6 cm) and the time interval from admission <b>to</b> <b>delivery</b> was compared. Cox regression analysis was performed to assess the association between cervical dilatation and time interval from admission <b>to</b> <b>delivery.</b> The other variables examined were gestational age (GA) at admission and length of the cervix, when performed. Results: The time interval from admission <b>to</b> <b>delivery</b> was significantly shorter in women with higher dilatation of the cervix (p < 0. 02) and in those admitted at a more advanced gestational age (p < 0. 05). Forty-eight percent of women with cervical dilatation 0 - 2 cm delivered in the first 48 h compared to 85 % of the women with a dilatation of 3 - 6 cm. No significant association was found between the length of the cervix and the time interval <b>to</b> <b>delivery.</b> Conclusion: Dilatation of the cervix and gestational age at admission are associated with the time interval <b>to</b> <b>delivery</b> in women with preterm labor. The assessment of the length of the cervix is unlikely to add clinical information in women with an already dilated cervix...|$|R
