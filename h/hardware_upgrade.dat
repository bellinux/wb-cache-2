Benchmark tests conducted by Anandtech concluded that the upgraded variant is able to last longer by {{at least an hour}} and a half, depending on the task that is conducted on the device. The maximum temperature that the device heated up to was also less than original iPad 2, tests conducted by the same organisation revealed that the upgraded variant was able to operate at 1 degree lower when performing intensive tasks. Performance difference between the two variants, according to Anandtech is negligible.|$|E
2500|$|It {{was rumored}} that {{the launch of}} Project Natal would be {{accompanied}} {{with the release of}} a new Xbox 360 console (as either a new retail configuration, a significant design revision and/or a modest <b>hardware</b> <b>upgrade).</b> Microsoft dismissed the reports in public and repeatedly emphasized that Project Natal would be fully compatible with all Xbox 360 consoles. Microsoft indicated that the company considers it to be a significant initiative, as fundamental to Xbox brand as Xbox Live, and with a launch akin to that of a new Xbox console platform. Kinect was even referred to as a [...] "new Xbox" [...] by Microsoft CEO Steve Ballmer at a speech for Executives' Club of Chicago. When asked if the introduction will extend the time before the next-generation console platform is launched (historically about 5 years between platforms), Microsoft corporate vice president Shane Kim reaffirmed that the company believes that the life cycle of Xbox 360 will last through 2015 (10 years).|$|E
2500|$|Santiago is {{responsible}} for improving the status of Comerío to that of autonomous municipality, gaining fiscal liberty from the central government. This resulted in an investment approaching fifty thousand dollars. The performance of the municipality's finances earned it an [...] "A" [...] grade from the Controllership office, the entity responsible for the fiscalization of public institutions. Santiago is a supporter of Puerto Rican culture, organizing several activities to promote it at the Casa de la Cultura Cacique Comerío, a municipal atrium. He also hosts a competition between performers of trova, a traditional Puerto Rican music, at the town's commemoration of its jíbaro heritage, the Festival Jíbaro Comerieño. Santiago established an environment-protection program, assigning seven percent of Comerío's terrain for conservation {{in order to protect}} the Puerto Rican plain pigeon, an endangered bird species. An extension of this initiative was the production of biodiesel to run a citywide trolley array. The municipality also ranks first in Puerto Rico when ranking the performance of its recycling program. Following the application of the Fiscal Emergency Act (Law No.7) by governor Luis Fortuño, the municipality of Comerío suffered numerous cuts in personnel and services, which made the unemployment rate soar and prompted constant confrontation between the municipality and the central government. Upon taking office, the Fortuño administration went on to close the offices of Retirement Affairs, Electrical Energy Authority, Environmental and Health Affairs, the Superintendent of Schools, Agriculture Extension Initiative, the Center for Agricultural Affairs and a Head Start program. Santiago attended this by applying countermeasures, attempting to save the Industrial Cooperative by pursuing an alliance with the Puerto Rico Police Department which would make the official manufacturer of uniforms for the force. He arranged support from the Puerto Rico Department of Education and supported a vocation school, before also establishing an agreement with a private university in order to provide cheap nocturnal education for the unemployed inhabitants. Santiago spearheaded the construction of Hotel Media Luna, a hotel that he expects will help by offering employment. He {{is responsible}} for the establishment of the Biblioteca y Centro Cíbernetico Laura Arroyo Torrens, a cyber-library that offers online-classes supported by the Interamerican University of Puerto Rico. Under his incumbency, Comerío became the first municipality of the central-mountainous region to offer gratituous Wi-Fi connection in its recreation plaza and to receive a <b>hardware</b> <b>upgrade</b> allowing faster rates. After the municipality failed to receive funds from the central administration for road reppairs, Santiago secured external funds and attended a public bid to obtain additional vehicles to ensure maintenance. The municipal administration support the local AA Baseball franchise, the Pescadores del Plata de Comerío, which won the national championship in 2003. He {{is responsible for}} building the a new municipal auditorium, which has been used to host youth volleyball and basketball tournaments promoted by the municipality. Santiago also began an initiative to promote sports and combat childhood obesity, Jugando por tu Salud. He has also hosted a 10-kilometre marathon, the Maratón El Seco.|$|E
