5|$|Writer and co-producer Mike Sussman, {{wrote the}} script the episode, {{originally}} intending for <b>it</b> <b>to</b> <b>show</b> {{the origins of}} the Orion species. But this was changed to a new species, the Osaarians, during rewrites. The episode was shot over seven days, with the majority of filming taking place on standing ship sets for the Enterprise. The Command Centre set was used for the second time, having previously appeared in the first episode of the season. It had been introduced as a new set for the third season as an area on the Enterprise where the crew would plan their next move in the mission against the Xindi. A new set was created for the brig, where the Osaarian Orgoth was held prisoner. One day of filming was on sets to represent the Osaarian base, with the majority of those made up using green screens that would allow the sets to be digitally inserted in post production.|$|E

25|$|In 1894, Boyce {{was elected}} to the Idaho state senate as a Populist from Shoshone County, Idaho. Boyce battled for the eight-hour day for miners, the {{establishment}} of an arbitration board to settle labor disputes, and an investigation of the 1892 mining war. He objected to appropriations for the state militia, charging that it was a tool used by the state and mine owners to suppress labor. He called for legislation to forbid employment of aliens, to outlaw yellow-dog contracts and prohibit company stores. In {{one of the most dramatic}} speeches he ever made, Boyce denounced the blacklist:Senate bill fifty six provides for no class, no special legislation, but under its provisions those relentless persecutors, known as corporations, are prevented when they discharge an employee from following him with a blacklist and depriving him of the means of earning an honest living in another part of the state….Why do you not produce some argument against <b>it</b> <b>to</b> <b>show</b> that it should not become a law? No, it is not necessary: you of the Republican party have the votes to kill the bill and that is all you desire. But remember these words: the laboring men of Idaho have asked you for bread and you give them a stone: we ask you for justice and you treat us with scorn, but the day is fast approaching when your action will be condemned by every man who has one drop of manly blood in his veins.|$|E
500|$|Jakob Hermann was {{the first}} to show that A is conserved for a special case of the inverse-square central force, and worked out its {{connection}} to the eccentricity of the orbital ellipse. [...] Hermann's work was generalized to its modern form by Johann Bernoulli in 1710. [...] At the end of the century, Pierre-Simon de Laplace rediscovered the conservation of A, deriving it analytically, rather than geometrically. [...] In {{the middle of the nineteenth}} century, William Rowan Hamilton derived the equivalent eccentricity vector defined below, using <b>it</b> <b>to</b> <b>show</b> that the momentum vector p moves on a circle for motion under an inverse-square central force (Figure 3).|$|E

For us, as directors, it was scary and exciting at the same time—the energy and emotion were purely authentic.|$|E

500|$|Until {{the early}} 14th century, the {{interior}} of the cathedral was in a unified style, but it was to undergo two significant changes, to the tower and to the eastern end. Between 1315 and 1322 the central tower was heightened and topped by a spire, which caused the piers that supported <b>it</b> <b>to</b> <b>show</b> signs of stress. In 1338 the mason William Joy employed an unorthodox solution by inserting low arches topped by inverted arches of similar dimensions, forming scissors-like structures. These arches brace the piers of the crossing on three sides, while the easternmost side is braced by a choir screen. The bracing arches are known as [...] "St Andrew's Cross arches", in a reference to the patron saint of the cathedral. They have been described by Wim Swaan – rightly or wrongly – as [...] "brutally massive" [...] and intrusive in an otherwise restrained interior.|$|E

Charles Spencer remarked that his grandfather Albert was trying to say, [...] "This part of Althorp will never be lived in again; so we may as well use <b>it</b> <b>to</b> <b>show</b> off the treasures in an orderly way". Today, most of the collection has been moved to the China Museum which lies {{on the east side of}} the house, between the Sutherland Room and the Great Dining Room, and the passage now contains a series of busts and paintings in its place, including a self-portrait of Sofonisba Anguisciola, and portraits of the dramatist Molière and the actor David Garrick. Charles Spencer highlights a pair of late 17th century blue and white tulipieres, special vases to hold tulips which were fashionable at the time, as his favourite in the museum.|$|E

500|$|When 20th Century Fox {{acquired}} the film rights to Watchmen, the comic's writer Alan Moore was initially {{excited about the}} film adaptation. In a 1987 edition of Comics Interview, he revealed Sam Hamm, who was attached to write, visited him in Northampton for lunch and that he felt Hamm would provide an adaptation faithful to the comic's spirit. Ultimately, Hamm's script altered the ending, having Adrian Veidt die and Dr. Manhattan alter time so that Jon Osterman is not affected by the radiation. As a result, the remaining characters are teleported {{to the real world}} created as a result of time travel. In an interview with Varietys Danny Graydon, during Warner Bros.'s first possession of feature film rights for Watchmen, Moore changed his mind, adamantly opposing a film adaptation of his comic book. Moore felt that, contrary to others’ opinion, the comic book was not cinematic. When he was approached by Terry Gilliam on how to film the comic book, Moore stated that he [...] "didn't think it was filmable". Moore clarified for Graydon, [...] "I didn't design <b>it</b> <b>to</b> <b>show</b> off the similarities between cinema and comics, which are there, but in my opinion are fairly unremarkable. It was designed to show off the things that comics could do that cinema and literature couldn't." ...|$|E

The video was filmed completely on location, {{with none of the}} scenes shot on green screens. The video primarily consists of Spears, whilst wearing cowboy boots, performing the song whilst standing {{on the edge of a}} cliff, and inside a cave: despite her [...] "trepidation" [...] and heavy winds which [...] "almost dropped [...] over", she performed the scene without a safety cable. Isham praised Spears' attitude to the filming of the scene, claiming that she [...] "had not a blink of fear" [...] during the shoot, Spears is sitting on top of a cliff, surrounded by cliffs. Isham also considered the music video one of his favorites, commenting that he had [...] "nothing but positive things to say about my experience with her and what she's doing right now" [...] and that Spears [...] "stepped into it with positive energy. She ended up stepping out and kicking ass, There are 3 versions of the video, Version 1 and 2 has clips from the movie [...] "Crossroads" [...] and Version 3 is the original version." [...] The music video won the award for [...] "International Music Video of the Year Short-Form" [...] on the 2003 Japan Gold Disc Awards.|$|E
500|$|... "Blood Feud" [...] {{was written}} by George Meyer and {{directed}} by David Silverman. Executive producer Sam Simon and writers Al Jean and Mike Reiss {{came up with the}} idea for the episode while they were trying to fill up the rest of the production run. A co-worker had recently needed a blood transfusion, and the writers thought it would be funny if Mr. Burns had one. Although Meyer was credited with writing the episode, Jean and Reiss re-wrote and polished the script. Harry Shearer, the voice of Mr. Burns and Smithers, could not attend the table read for the episode, so his parts were read by Dan Castellaneta (the voice of Homer). [...] "Blood Feud" [...] includes a first act that is much longer than a normal episode of the show. The producers were going to end the act with Mr. Burns feeling better, but decided to extend <b>it</b> <b>to</b> <b>show</b> how the Simpson family was affected. [...] "Blood Feud" [...] ends with the family discussing what the message of the episode was, but decide that there was no message. The writers were having trouble conceiving an ending, but decided that since there was no point, they would discuss it. In his book Planet Simpson, Chris Turner writes that the ending is meant to openly mock the [...] "notion of the tidy sitcom-style moral" [...] and the [...] "formulaic plots of sitcoms".|$|E
