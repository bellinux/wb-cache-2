40|$|The {{molecular}} {{response to}} Cr(VI) is well understood in mammalian systems under normal physiological conditions, however, {{little is known}} about the effects of chromium in aquatic macro fauna.

40|$|Abstract—Chemicals {{released}} into the environment have a potential to affect on various species and evaluation of the impacts on ecosystems including aquatic organisms is urgent issue. In order to evaluate chemical effects on various species, {{it is important to}} understand their mode of action. Recent advances in toxicogenomics, the integration of genomics into toxicology is promising for understanding mode of action in responding to chemical pollutants. In this study, we applied the toxicogenomics to an aquatic organism, Daphnia magna. Among aquatic organisms, Daphnia magna has been used extensively in acute toxicity or reproductive toxicity tests. Although these types of tests can provide information on hazardous concentrations of chemicals, they provide no information about their mode of action. Thus we developed an oligonucleotide-based DNA microarray based on a Daphnia expressed sequence tag (EST) database and applied for ecotoxicogenomic assessment of Daphnia magna. The DNA microarray was used to examine gene expression profiles of neonate daphnids exposed to several different chemicals. Exposure to these chemicals resulted in characteristic gene expression patterns that were chemicalspecific. This result indicates that our newly developed DNA microarray can be useful for a mechanistic understanding of chemical toxicity on a common <b>freshwater</b> <b>organism,</b> Daphnia magna, and that the Daphnia genomics is useful for aquatic ecotoxicology...|$|E

MPs are shown to have a negative biological effect on several marine organisms via ingestion, which might cause internal damage. Persistent organic pollutants and metals are suspected to accumulate in MPs, and for metals causing an increased exposure in animals ingesting them, hereby acting as vectors. Amongst several other negative physiological effects, this is suggested to induce oxidative stress. This study examines the possible vector effect of MPs on the <b>freshwater</b> <b>organism,</b> Hyalella azteca, investigating the combined effect of MPs, Cu and Zn expressed by oxidative stress response (nmol MDA/mg protein), negatively affected swimming behavior and mortality. The levels of oxidative stress in H. azteca where measured by the two assays; TBARS and Bradford. Neither of the combined exposure of the two metals (Cu and Zn) and MPs showed any significant negative effect, opposed to the exposure of only Zn which had a slight effect inducing oxidative stress, whereas Cu did not. However, no significant tendencies were found due to unmonitored factors affecting the experiment, one scenario could be overfeeding leading to elevated stress response in all organisms. Therefore the suggested vector effect could not be supported or rejected by this study...|$|E

It is usually associated with submerged macrophytes or substrate and also {{plays a key role}} in food webs of both vertebrate (fish) and invertebrate predators. Not only is this species in most localities the most common chydorid, but it is quite often the most common filtering cladoceran. Moreover, due to its little morphological variation most small globular representatives of the genus Chydorus were in the past all incorrectly ascribed to Chydorus sphaericus. However, thanks to more detailed studies it was suggested that so called species Chydorus sphaericus was not in fact a single taxonomic entity, but a group of several closely related species. It is clear today that for correct taxonomic desision it is necessary to combine all ecological, morphological, and genetic methods. The aim of this study was to explore genetical and morphological variation in populations of Chyrodis sphaericus from localities representing different sets of environmental factors.

40|$|The study {{objectives}} were {{to shed light}} on the types of <b>freshwater</b> <b>organism</b> that are sensitive to triphenyltin acetate (TPT) and to compare the laboratory and microcosm sensitivities of the invertebrate community. The responses of a wide array of freshwater taxa (including invertebrates, phytoplankton and macrophytes) from acute laboratory Single Species Tests (SST) were compared with the concentration¿response relationships of aquatic populations in two types of freshwater microcosms. Representatives of several taxonomic groups of invertebrates, and several phytoplankton and vascular plant species proved to be sensitive to TPT, illustrating its diverse modes of toxic action. Statistically calculated ecological risk thresholds (HC 5 values) based on 96 h laboratory EC 50 values for invertebrates were 1. 3 ¿g/l, while these values on the basis of microcosm-Species Sensitivity Distributions (SSD) for invertebrates in sampling weeks 2 ¿ 8 after TPT treatment ranged from 0. 2 to 0. 6 ¿g/l based on nominal peak concentrations. Responses observed in the microcosms did not differ between system types and sampling dates, indicating that ecological threshold levels are not affected by different community structures including taxa sensitive to TPT. The laboratory-derived invertebrate SSD curve was less sensitive than the curves from the microcosms. Possible explanations for the more sensitive field response are delayed effects and/or additional chronic exposure via the food chain in the microcosm...|$|E

40|$|Methanogens use {{an unusual}} energy-conserving {{electron}} transport chain that involves reduction {{of a limited}} number of electron acceptors to methane gas. Previous biochemical studies suggested that the proton-pumping F 420 H 2 dehydrogenase (Fpo) plays a crucial role in this process during growth on methanol. However, Methanosarcina barkeri Δfpo mutants constructed in this study display no measurable phenotype on this substrate, indicating that Fpo plays a minor role, if any. In contrast, Δfrh mutants lacking the cytoplasmic F 420 -reducing hydrogenase (Frh) are severely affected in their ability to grow and make methane from methanol, and double Δfpo/Δfrh mutants are completely unable to use this substrate. These data suggest that the preferred electron transport chain involves production of hydrogen gas in the cytoplasm, which then diffuses out of the cell, where it is reoxidized with transfer of electrons into the energy-conserving electron transport chain. This hydrogen-cycling metabolism leads directly to production of a proton motive force that can be used by the cell for ATP synthesis. Nevertheless, M. barkeri does have the flexibility to use the Fpo-dependent electron transport chain when needed, as shown by the poor growth of the Δfrh mutant. Our data suggest that the rapid enzymatic turnover of hydrogenases may allow a competitive advantage via faster growth rates in this <b>freshwater</b> <b>organism.</b> The mutant analysis also confirms the proposed role of Frh in growth on hydrogen/carbon dioxide and suggests that either Frh or Fpo is needed for aceticlastic growth of M. barkeri...|$|E
40|$|Considering IPPC {{climate change}} scenarios, it is {{pertinent}} to predict situations where coastal ecosystems already impacted with chemical contamination became exposed to an additional stressor under a future scenario of seawater intrusion. Accordingly, {{the present study}} aimed at evaluating if a negative association between tolerance to a metal and to saltwater exists among genotypes of a <b>freshwater</b> <b>organism.</b> For this, five clonal lineages of the cladoceran Daphnia longispina O. F. Mu¨ ller, exhibiting a differential tolerance to lethal levels of copper, were selected. Each clonal lineage was exposed to lethal and sublethal concentrations of sodium chloride (assumed as a protective surrogate to evaluate the toxicity of increased salinity to freshwater organisms). Mortality, time to release the first brood and total number of neonates per female were monitored and the somatic growth rate and intrinsic {{rate of natural increase}} were computed for each clonal lineage. Data here obtained were compared with their lethal responses to copper and significant negative correlations were found. These results suggest that genetically eroded populations of D. longispina, due to copper or salinity, may be particularly susceptible to a later exposure to the other contaminant supporting the multiple stressors differential tolerance.

40|$|The {{inhibition}} of acetylcholinesterase (AChE) activity and energy allocation in the <b>freshwater</b> <b>organism</b> Daphnia magna exposed to carbaryl and potential {{recovery from the}} effects was examined. The binding of carbaryl-AChE was characterized through in vitro assays. To evaluate the recovery from inhibition and the alteration in energy budget, in vivo exposure and recovery regime tests were conducted. In comparison to diazoxon, the active metabolite of the insecticide diazinon, the stability of enzyme-carbaryl complex was fifteen times lower and the reactivity toward the active site was two times lower, resulting in approximately 30 times lower overall inhibition rate than for diazoxon. The in vitro reactivation rate constant of the inhibited enzyme and the in vivo recovery rate constant of AChE activity were 1. 9 h- 1 and 0. 12 h- 1 for carbaryl, respectively, which are {{much higher than the}} corresponding rate constants for diazoxon. The lower AChE inhibition and greater reactivation/recovery rates are in accordance with the lower toxicity of carbaryl compared to diazinon. Carbaryl exposure also altered the profile of the energy reserve: the decrease in lipid and glycogen and the increase in protein content resulted in the reduction of the total energy budget by about 45 mJ/gww. This corresponds to 26 percent of the available energy, which might allocate for external stressors. The mechanistic model of AChE inhibition is helpful to get an insight into (eco-) toxicological effects of AChE inhibitors on freshwater crustaceans under environmentally realistic conditions...|$|E
