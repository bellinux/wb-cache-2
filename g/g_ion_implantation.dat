The substitution of C for B and N {{atoms in the}} honeycomb lattice was demonstrated through electron energy loss spectroscopy, spatially resolved energy-filtered elemental mapping, and in situ electrical measurements. Substitutional C doping transformed BNNTs from electrical insulators to conductors. In comparison with the existing post-synthesis doping methods for nanoscale materials (e. <b>g.,</b> <b>ion</b> <b>implantation</b> and diffusion), the discovered electron-beam-induced doping is a well-controlled, little-damaging, room-temperature, and simple strategy {{that is expected to}} demonstrate great promise for post-synthesis doping of diverse nanomaterials in the future...|$|E

The method {{is based on}} the Rare Event Enhanced Domain following Molecular Dynamics (REED-MD) algorithm, which has been successfully applied to studies of, e. <b>g.,</b> <b>ion</b> <b>implantation</b> into crystalline semiconductor wafers. We discuss the strategies for parallelizing the method, and we settle on a host-client type polling scheme in which a multiple of asynchronous processors are continuously fed to the host, which, in turn, distributes the resulting feed-back information to the clients. This real-time feed-back consists of, e. g., cumulative damage information or statistics updates necessary for the cloning in the rare event algorithm. We finally demonstrate the algorithm for radiation effects in a nuclear oxide fuel, and we show the balanced parallel approach with high parallel efficiency in multiple processor configurations. ...|$|E
40|$|A unique {{process of}} {{fabricating}} a strained layer GexSi 1 -x on insulator is demonstrated. Such strained heterostructures {{are useful in}} the fabrication of high-mobility transistors. This technique incorporates well-established silicon processing technology e. <b>g.,</b> <b>ion</b> <b>implantation</b> and thermal oxidation. A dilute GeSi layer is initially formed by implanting Ge+ into a silicon-on-insulator (SOI) substrate. Thermal oxidation segregates the Ge at the growing oxide interface to form a distinct GexSi 1 -x thin-film with a composition that can be tailored by controlling the oxidation parameters (e. g. temperature and oxidation ambient). In addition, the film thickness can be controlled by implantation fluence, which is important since the film forms pseudomorphically below 2 × 1016 Ge/cm 2. Continued oxidation consumes the underlying Si leaving the strained GeSi film encapsulated by the two oxide layers, i. e. the top thermal oxide and the buried oxide. Removal of the thermal oxide by a dilute HF etch completes the process. Strain relaxation {{can be achieved by}} either of two methods. One involves vacancy injection by ion implantation to introduce sufficient open-volume within the film to compensate for the compressive strain. The other depends upon the formation of GeO 2. If Ge is oxidized in the absence of Si, it evaporates as GeO(g) resulting in spontaneous relaxation within the straine...|$|E

40|$|We analyze results {{generated}} by large-scale molecular-dynamics simulations of self-interstitial clusters in crystalline silicon using a recently developed computational method for probing the thermodynamics of defects in solids. In this approach, the potential-energy landscape is sampled with lengthy molecular-dynamics simulations and repeated energy minimizations {{in order to}} build distribution functions that quantitatively describe the formation thermodynamics of a particular defect cluster. Using this method, a comprehensive picture for interstitial aggregation is proposed. In particular, we find that both vibrational and configuration entropic factors play important roles in determining self-interstitial cluster morphology. In addition to the expected role of temperature, we also find that applied (hydrostatic) pressure and the commensurate lattice strain greatly influence the resulting aggregation pathways. Interestingly, the effect of pressure appears to manifest not by altering the thermodynamics of individual defect configurations but rather by changing the overall energy landscape associated with the defect. These effects appear to be general and are predicted using multiple, well-tested, empirical interatomic potentials for silicon. Our results suggest that internal stress environments within a silicon wafer (e. <b>g.,</b> created by <b>ion</b> <b>implantation)</b> could have profound effects on the observed selfinterstitial cluster morphology...|$|R

30|$|With {{the advent}} of modern times, higher {{performance}} devices are desired. In order to get more high-performance devices, the pivotal problem is how to get better quality materials. Generally, we dope some impurities into the materials as a solution. Traditional doping methods can be roughly divided into three classes: doping during growth, doping by diffusion, and <b>ion</b> <b>implantation.</b> Doping with few impurities into one-dimensional nanomaterials has been achieved already, but controllable and reproducible doping is still difficult to be achieved during growth. <b>Ion</b> <b>implantation</b> is an advanced technique that has been widely applied in material surface modification for nearly 30 years. As a method for industrial application, <b>ion</b> <b>implantation</b> is a controllable and rather exact manner. Compared with conventional doping method, the prominent advantage of <b>ion</b> <b>implantation</b> is that almost all elements {{can be used for}} implantation and it never draws into any other impurity elements. Lately, focus ion beam (FIB) system has been used to perform <b>ion</b> <b>implantation</b> process [7, 8]. In this method, the position of <b>ion</b> <b>implantation</b> becomes steerable. In this letter, we review literatures on the application of <b>ion</b> <b>implantation</b> on one-dimensional nanomaterials.

30|$|Many growth {{methods have}} been used to {{fabricate}} nanowires; with the development of technology, growth methods become outmoded, and various kinds of nanomaterials are developed. These nanomaterials have been applied in fabricating high-performance electronic or optical devices. With the purpose of getting higher performance devices, various elements were doped into the nanomaterials. Nevertheless, doping is not effortless; p-type doping of certain materials, such as CdS and ZnO, are rather knotty. Obviously, <b>ion</b> <b>implantation</b> is the most accurate and controllable method for doping, and theoretically, <b>ion</b> <b>implantation</b> can be appropriate for almost all the elements. We need not consider solubility limits and never fear to introduce impurity elements. After <b>ion</b> <b>implantation,</b> the electrical conductivity of nanowires can be increased by several orders of magnitude.
