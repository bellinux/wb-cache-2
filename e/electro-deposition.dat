50|$|Etched ion tracks can be {{replicated}} by polymers or metals. Replica and template {{can be used}} as composite. A replica can be separated from its template mechanically or chemically. Polymer replicas are obtained by filling the etched track with a liquid precursor of the polymer and curing it. Curing can be activated by a catalyst, by ultraviolet radiation, or by heat. Metal replicas can be obtained either by electroless deposition or by <b>electro-deposition.</b> For replication of through-pores, a cathode film is deposited {{on one side of the}} membrane, and the membrane is immersed in a metal salt solution. The cathode film is negatively charged with respect to the anode, which is placed on the opposite side of the membrane. The positive metal ions are pulled toward the cathode, where they catch electrons and precipitate as a compact metal film. During <b>electro-deposition,</b> the channels fill gradually with metal, and the lengths of the nano-wires are controlled by the deposition time. Rapid deposition leads to polycrystalline wires, while slow deposition leads to single crystalline wires. A free-standing replica is obtained by removing the template after deposition of a bearing film on the anode side of the membrane.|$|E

In 1871, he contributed a paper to the Philosophical Magazine, [...] "On Solutions for Depositing Copper and Brass by means of Electric Force," [...] and about the same time he conducted some experiments for the Government in <b>electro-deposition</b> of copper upon the bottom of an iron ship.|$|E
5000|$|Magnetic multilayers: Nano-wires {{consisting}} of alternating magnetic/nonmagnetic layers act as magnetic sensors. As an example, cobalt/copper nanowires are obtained from an electrolyte containing both metals. At low voltage, pure copper is deposited while cobalt resists <b>electro-deposition.</b> At high voltage, both metals are deposited as an alloy. If the electrolyte contains predominantly cobalt, a magnetic cobalt-copper alloy is deposited {{with a high}} fraction of cobalt. The electrical conductivity of the multilayer wire depends on the applied external magnetic field. The magnetic order of the cobalt layers increases with the applied field. Without magnetic field, neighboring magnetic layers prefer the anti-parallel order. With magnetic field, the magnetic layers prefer the orientation parallel with the magnetic field. The parallel orientation corresponds to a reduced electrical resistance. The effect is used in reading heads of magnetic storage media (the [...] "GMR effect").|$|E
40|$|The {{phenomenon}} of metal <b>electro-deposition</b> in thin-gap geometry leads to {{very interesting and}} diverse two dimensional morphologies. This varies from dense ramified growth to thin dendritic projections. In this paper, we have proposed a stochastic model that incorporates such diversity. We carried out thin-gap <b>electro-deposition</b> of Copper and Zinc with varying electrolytic concentrations. A well known model, that until this work was used to explain dielectric breakdown patterns, was employed to explain the variation in deposition morphology with concentration. The sole parameter in the model was varied and the numerically obtained patterns was seen to correlate well with those obtained from <b>electro-deposition.</b> A linear relationship between the parameter and molar concentration was established. The established relationship was then analysed and interpreted...|$|E

Exposure of molybdenum films to selenium vapour at 550 °C produces thin and chemically robust heterostructures of Mo/MoSe 2. These films exhibit {{the characteristics of}} a degenerate semi-conductor and provide close to metallic electrical conductivity for <b>electro-deposition</b> processes in both acidic and alkaline aqueous media.

40|$|The use of {{cross-flow}} ultrafiltration for {{the recovery}} of coating material from aqueous streams started about 30 years ago with <b>electro-deposition</b> paint in the automotive industry. This early success {{can be related to}} both environmental and economical advantages of using ultrafiltration. Ultrafiltration recovers and concentrates <b>electro-deposition</b> paint on the retentate side and produces purified water on the permeate side. Based on this success, the focus more recently moved to other coating materials, such as paper coatings, latex and flexographic ink. Similar to <b>electro-deposition</b> paint, the concept is to recover the diluted coating materials with ultrafiltration to obtain a solid-free permeate stream, which can be either recycled or easily treated, and a retentate stream, which contains the coating materials preferably at concentrations suitable for recycling or disposal. The advantages can be directly translated into very short payback times for ultrafiltration systems of typically less than two years. Application studies focusing on the coating recovery in a paper mill, the concentration of latex from the tank wash at a latex producer and {{the recovery of}} flexographic ink at a producer of printed cartons will highlight these benefits...|$|E

During the previous quarter, a specialized sample holder was developed towards this goal. Various techniques for the deposition of Chromium were investigated and <b>electro-deposition</b> {{was determined to be}} the most suitable approach due to the large aspect ratio of the pores. A challenge in using <b>electro-deposition</b> for porous alumina is the potential sealing of the pores in aqueous solutions at higher temperatures.

40|$|Novel {{cationic}} resins were synthesized for {{a direct}} application in automotive industry. A previous patent protocol with lower bath toxicity (i. e. no catalyst neither harmful compounds were employed), {{as compared to}} the current industrial methods based on polyurethane chemistry, was implemented. This includes the use of aliphatic polyketones as cross-linking agents for epoxy-based resins in <b>electro-deposition</b> (EPD) processes. Cross-linking takes place through the Paal-Knorr reaction of the amino groups on the epoxy-based materials with 1, 4 -dicarbonyl groups present on the polyketone backbone. The reaction kinetics can be finely tuned by the steric hindrance on both components. This was preliminarily investigated by using 2, 5, 8 -nonanetrione as model compound. The used amines (i. e. 4 -aminopiperidine (AP) and 4 -aminomethyl piperidine (AMP)) display higher steric hindrance with respect to the primary ones used in the original protocol. Application of these components during <b>electro-deposition</b> coating yields the desired high-quality coating layers on several metallic substrates as shown by optical microscopy and image processing. All the produced coatings scored higher adhesion and chemical resistance rating than the amine-based ones used in the previous protocol (i. e. diethylenetriamine, DETA). Afterwards, the same <b>electro-deposition</b> baths showed to have stable performance even after being reused 21 and 56 days later. (C) 2016 Published by Elsevier Ltd...|$|E
