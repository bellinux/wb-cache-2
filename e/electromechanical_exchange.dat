50|$|Since the {{replacement}} of <b>electromechanical</b> <b>exchanges</b> by modern digital ones, the function of a Class-5 switch in rural areas is often performed by a remote switch or Remote Digital Terminal installed at the original switch site to handle local switching or concentration, respectively. The Class-5 switching infrastructure is then physically located in a larger population center. Urban areas with extensive underground plant tend to keep the classic Class-5 office architecture.|$|R
50|$|Almon Brown Strowger (February 11, 1839 - May 26, 1902) was an American {{inventor}} {{who gave}} {{his name to}} the Strowger switch, an <b>electromechanical</b> telephone <b>exchange</b> technology that his invention and patent inspired.|$|R
50|$|Wire spring relays were {{primarily}} manufactured by the Western Electric Company {{for use in}} <b>electromechanical</b> telephone <b>exchanges</b> in the Bell System. The design was licensed for use around the world, and was commonplace in Japan.|$|R
50|$|Telecom Ã‰ireann {{rolled out}} digital {{telephone}} switching technology, {{across the country}} along with an extensive fibre optic and digital microwave backbone. Two digital switching systems were selected; CIT-Alcatel's E10 and Ericsson's AXE telephone exchange.Digital technology quickly replaced analogue systems at national and major regional switching centres and new international gateway switches were installed. The oldest <b>electromechanical</b> step-by-step <b>exchanges</b> and manual operator-manned local exchanges {{were the first to}} be converted to digital technology. More modern <b>electromechanical</b> crossbar <b>exchanges,</b> using Ericsson ARF technology dating from the 1960s and 1970s were converted to digital bit by bit through the late 1980s and early 1990s. These crossbar switches were capable of providing voice service that was comparable to digital switching technology.|$|R
5000|$|The {{high speeds}} of {{electronic}} equipment allowed {{the use of}} a single common control to deal with even the largest and most heavily loaded exchange and made possible the use of the [...] "one at a time" [...] principle in the setting up of connections. The control contained [...] "logical" [...] elements which controlled the sequences, and [...] "memory" [...] elements to store information relating to the switches and calls and permanent and semi-permanent information relating to the lines. These were basic requirements in any type of telephone <b>exchange.</b> In <b>electromechanical</b> <b>exchanges</b> the call memories are spread over the equipment in the form of mechanical spring sets and operated relays while the line information is stored in the form of jumpers on the IDF.|$|R
50|$|In 1979, Glenkindie {{telephone}} exchange, just North of Towie, {{became the}} UK's first digital telephone exchange. As part of general developments towards digital telephony, small rural exchanges {{of this size}} were seen as candidates for solid-state exchanges as they might be more reliable than the previous <b>electromechanical</b> Strowger <b>exchanges.</b>|$|R
5000|$|A sender was {{a special}} type of circuit in 20th-century <b>electromechanical</b> {{telephone}} <b>exchanges</b> which registered the telephone numbers dialed by the subscriber, and then transmitted that information to another exchange. In some American exchange designs, for example, the 1XB switch there were both originating senders and terminating senders.|$|R
50|$|This {{was once}} more {{important}} because outside broadcasts were carried over 'music circuits' that used telephone lines, with clicks from Strowger and other <b>electromechanical</b> telephone <b>exchanges.</b> It now finds fresh relevance {{in the measurement}} of noise on computer 'Audio Cards' which commonly suffer clicks as drives start and stop.|$|R
50|$|The first System X unit {{to enter}} public service was in September 1980 and was {{installed}} in Baynard House, London and was a tandem junction unit which switched telephone calls amongst around 40 local exchanges. The first local digital exchange started operation in 1981 in Woodbridge, Suffolk (near BT's Research HQ at Martlesham Heath). The last <b>electromechanical</b> trunk <b>exchange</b> (in Thurso, Scotland) was closed in July 1990 - completing the UK's trunk network transition to purely digital operation and becoming the first national telephone system to achieve this. The last <b>electromechanical</b> local <b>exchanges,</b> Crawford, Crawfordjohn and Elvanfoot, all in Scotland, were changed over to digital on 23 June 1995 and the last electronic analogue exchanges, Selby, Yorkshire and Leigh on Sea, Essex were changed to digital on 11 March 1998.|$|R
40|$|In this section, we {{describe}} {{the development of a}} complex multi-domain electromechanical system as an interconnection of simpler subsystems. We first give a global overview of the total system to be modelled, then describe the subsystems of the model, and conclude with final remarks on how network modelling was used in this problem, and to what benefit. Our <b>electromechanical</b> system <b>exchanges</b> energy between the power grid, a local mechanical source and a local general load, which may contain subsystems from any domain...|$|R
5000|$|A {{few million}} reed relays were used from the 1930s to the 1960s for memory {{functions}} in Bell System <b>electromechanical</b> telephone <b>exchanges.</b> Often a multiple-reed relay was used, {{with one of}} the reeds latching the relay, and the other or others performing logic or memory functions. Most reed relays in the crossbar switching systems of the 1940s through the 1970s were packaged in groups of five. Such a [...] "reed pack" [...] was able to store one decimal digit, encoded in a two-out-of-five code (74210 variant) for easy validity checking by wire spring relay logic.|$|R
50|$|The British Post Office (GPO) used such master clocks {{in their}} <b>electromechanical</b> {{telephone}} <b>exchanges</b> {{to generate the}} call timing pulses necessary to charge telephone subscribers for their calls, and to control sequences of {{events such as the}} forcible clearing of connections where the calling subscriber failed to hang up after the called subscriber had done so. The UK had four such manufacturers, all of whom made clocks to the same GPO specification and which used the Hipp Toggle impulse system; these were Gent and Co., of Leicester, Magneta Ltd of Leatherhead in Surrey, Synchronome Ltd of Alperton, north-west London, and Gillett and Johnson.|$|R
50|$|A Symbolic Analysis of Relay and Switching Circuits is {{the title}} of a master's thesis written by {{computer}} science pioneer Claude E. Shannon while attending the Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT) in 1937. In his thesis, Shannon, a dual degree graduate of the University of Michigan, proved that Boolean algebra could be used to simplify the arrangement of the relays that were the building blocks of the <b>electromechanical</b> automatic telephone <b>exchanges</b> of the day. Shannon went on to prove that it should also be possible to use arrangements of relays to solve Boolean algebra problems.|$|R
50|$|The <b>electromechanical</b> {{automatic}} telephone <b>exchange,</b> invented by Almon Strowger in 1888, gradually replaced manual switchboards in central telephone exchanges around the world. In 1919, the Bell System in the United States also adopted automatic switching as its future technology, {{after years of}} reliance on manual systems. Nevertheless, many manual branch exchanges remained operational into {{the second half of}} the 20th century in many enterprises. Later electronic devices and computer technology gave the operator access to an abundance of features. A private branch exchange (PBX) in a business usually has an attendant console for the operator, or an auto-attendant, which bypasses the operator entirely.|$|R
5000|$|The {{crossbar}} switch itself was simple: exchange design moved all the logical decision-making {{to the common}} control elements, which were very reliable as relay sets. The design criterion was to have two hours of [...] "downtime" [...] for service every forty years, which was a huge improvement on earlier <b>electromechanical</b> systems. The <b>exchange</b> design concept lent itself to incremental upgrades, as the control elements could be replaced separately from the call switching elements. The minimum size of a crossbar exchange was comparatively large, but in city areas with a large installed line capacity the whole exchange occupied less space than other exchange technologies of equivalent capacity. For this reason they were also typically the first switches to be replaced with digital systems, which were even smaller and more reliable.|$|R
