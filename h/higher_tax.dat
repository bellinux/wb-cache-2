40|$|It is well {{established}} in the economics literature that before-tax prices are not independent of sales-tax rates. This paper shows that a sales-tax imposed in a <b>high</b> <b>tax</b> region can decrease the tax-included price for a buyer in a low tax region who purchases from a seller in the <b>high</b> <b>tax</b> region. Therefore, {{it may be more}} profitable for Internet retailers to be located in <b>high</b> <b>tax</b> regions. An empirical analysis shows that automobile manufacturers in the European Union (EU) set higher before-tax recommended prices for countries with low indirect taxes.

25|$|Nearly {{two dozen}} local Pennsylvania jurisdictions, such as Harrisburg, use two-rate {{property}} taxation {{in which the}} tax on land value is higher and the tax on improvement value is lower. In 2000, Florenz Plassmann and Nicolaus Tideman wrote that when comparing Pennsylvania cities using a <b>higher</b> <b>tax</b> rate on land value and a lower rate on improvements with similar sized Pennsylvania cities using the same rate on land and improvements, the higher land value taxation leads to increased construction within the jurisdiction.|$|E
25|$|A Roth 401(k) plan is {{probably}} most advantageous {{to those who}} might otherwise choose a Roth IRA, such as younger workers who are currently taxed in a lower tax bracket but expect to be taxed in a higher bracket upon reaching retirement age. Higher-income workers may prefer a traditional 401(k) plan because they are currently taxed in a <b>higher</b> <b>tax</b> bracket but would expect to be taxed at a lower rate in retirement; also, those near the Roth IRA income limits may prefer a traditional 401(k) since its pre-tax contributions lowers Modified Adjusted Gross Income (MAGI) and thus increases eligibility for various other tax incentives (Roth IRA contributions, the Child Tax Credit, medical expense deduction, etc.). Another consideration for those currently in <b>higher</b> <b>tax</b> brackets {{is the future of}} income tax rates in the US: if income tax rates increase, current taxation would be desirable for a wider group). The Roth 401(k) offers the advantage of tax free distribution but is not constrained by the same income limitations. For example, in tax year 2013, normal Roth IRA contributions are limited to $5,500 ($6,500 if age 50 or older); up to $17,500 could be contributed to a Roth 401(k) account if no other elective deferrals were taken for the tax year, such as traditional 401(k) deferrals.|$|E

25|$|An {{expatriation}} tax {{is a tax}} {{on individuals}} who renounce their citizenship or residence. The tax is often imposed based on a deemed disposition of all the individual's property. One example is the United States under the American Jobs Creation Act, where any individual who has a net worth of $2 million or an average income-tax liability of $127,000 who renounces his or her citizenship and leaves the country is automatically assumed to have done so for tax avoidance reasons and is subject to a <b>higher</b> <b>tax</b> rate.|$|E
25|$|All {{wages of}} Connecticut {{residents}} {{are subject to}} the state's income tax, even if earned outside the state. However, in those cases, Connecticut income tax must be withheld only to the extent the Connecticut tax exceeds the amount withheld by the other jurisdiction. Since New York and Massachusetts have <b>higher</b> <b>tax</b> rates than Connecticut, this effectively means that Connecticut residents that work in those states have no Connecticut income tax withheld. Connecticut permits a credit for taxes paid to other jurisdictions, but since residents who work in other states are still subject to Connecticut income taxation, they may owe taxes if the jurisdictional credit does not fully offset the Connecticut tax amount.|$|E
25|$|Rhode Island's {{taxes were}} appreciably higher than {{neighboring}} states, because Rhode Island's income tax {{was based on}} 25% of the payer's federal income tax payment. Former Governor Donald Carcieri claimed that the <b>higher</b> <b>tax</b> rate had an inhibitory effect on business growth {{in the state and}} called for reductions to increase the competitiveness of the state's business environment. In 2010, the Rhode Island General Assembly passed a new state income tax structure that was then signed into law on June 9, 2010 by Governor Carcieri. The income tax overhaul has now made Rhode Island competitive with other New England states by lowering its maximum tax rate to 5.99% and reducing the number of tax brackets to three. The state's first income tax was enacted in 1971.|$|E

The deal cemented Pfizer's position as the largest pharmaceutical company in the world, with the merged company generating over US$20billion in cash each year, and was the largest corporate merger since AT and BellSouth's US$70billion deal in March 2006. The combined company was expected to save US$4billion annually through streamlining; however, as part of the deal, both companies must repatriate billions of dollars in revenue from foreign sources to the United States, which will result in <b>higher</b> <b>tax</b> costs. The acquisition was completed on October 15, 2009, making Wyeth a wholly owned subsidiary of Pfizer.|$|E
25|$|Roh's ambitious initial {{promises}} to establish Korea {{as an international}} business hub in Asia faded soon after his election. Instead, Korea under Roh suffered negative publicity in the foreign business community due to prosecutorial investigations on the purchase and sale of Korea Exchange Bank by the Lone Star Fund, spurring foreign investors to join their domestic counterparts in leaving the country. When housing prices soared, To prevent speculative bubble like Japanese asset price bubble crisis, Roh introduced additional 1~3% of property tax on real estate exceeding 600 million won(about 600,000US$). This efficiently slowed down the bubble, but this policy met high opposition by the riches who had to pay <b>higher</b> <b>tax.</b> At the same time, Roh also increased welfare spending by 18% a year, and drastically increased spending by increasing {{the size of the}} civil service by more than 95,700 new hires, or approximately 60 people a day.
