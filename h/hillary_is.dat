From August 1940 the conflict {{known as the}} Battle of Britain raged in the skies above the south coast of England. One of the busiest lifeboat crews during the Battle of Britain was the lifeboat Lord Southborough. On 3 September 1940 Lord Southborough was called out {{to search for a}} missing Spitfire pilot who had been shot down by a German Messerschmitt 109. The pilot was Richard Hillary, a descendant of Sir William Hillary, the founder of the RNLI in 1824. Unable to quickly escape from his burning aircraft, he suffered extensive burns to his face and hands, but did eventually escape the aircraft and bailed out into the North Sea where he was rescued by the lifeboat. He was taken ashore and was in considerable pain. After being admitted to Hospital the lifeboat crew made regular visits to see Hillary. His hands were so severely burnt that it was in question if he would ever fly an aircraft again. For three months he endured painful experimental reconstructive plastic surgery which attempted to repair the damage to his hands and face. Eventually he returned to combat duty. <b>Hillary</b> <b>is</b> one of the best known of McIndoe's [...] "Guinea Pig Club".
