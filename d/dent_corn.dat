5000|$|<b>Dent</b> <b>corn</b> {{also known}} as yellow <b>dent</b> <b>corn,</b> Reid's yellow <b>dent</b> <b>corn,</b> white <b>dent</b> <b>corn,</b> or field corn, is a variety of maize or corn with a high soft starch content. It {{received}} its name {{because of the small}} indentation ("dent") at the crown of each kernel on a ripe ear of corn. It is a variety developed by northern Illinois farmer James L. Reid. Reid and his father, Robert Reid, moved from Brown County, Ohio to Tazewell County, Illinois in 1846 bringing with them a red corn variety known as [...] "Johnny Hopkins", and crossed it with varieties of flint corn and floury corn. Most of today's hybrid corn varieties and cultivars are derived from it. This variety won a prize at the 1893 World's Fair.|$|E
50|$|The {{coloration}} of {{flint corn}} is often different from white and yellow <b>dent</b> <b>corns,</b> {{many of which}} were bred later. Most flint corn is multi-colored.

40|$|Historical {{records show}} t hat the Midwestern <b>dent</b> <b>corns</b> of the United States {{originated}} from hybridization of two landraces, Northern Flint and Southern Dent. We examined {{the origin of}} Southern and Midwestern Dents by means of isozyme electrophoresis. Isozyme genotypes were determined for 23 loci in 12 plants each of 32 accessions of Southern Dent. Previously published isozyme data for maize landraces of Mexico and North America and for U. S. Midwestern Dents were included for comparative purposes. The data show that Northern Flint and Southern Dent are among the isozymically most divergent maize landraces. Nei’s genetic identities between populations of these two landraces are very low for conspecific populations (ca. 0. 80). Southern Dent of the southeastern U. S. appears closely related to similar <b>dent</b> <b>corns</b> of southern Mexico, supporting a previously published hypothesis that U. S. Southern Dent is largely derived from the <b>dent</b> <b>corns</b> of southern Mexico. The Midwestern Dents, which resulted from crosses of Southern Dent and Northern Flint, are much more like Southern Dent than Northern Flint in their isozyme profile. Similarly, public inbreds show greater affinity to Southern Dent {{with the exception of}} sweet corn lines, which resemble Northern Flint in their isozyme allele frequencies.

40|$|The {{objective}} {{of this study was}} to evaluate the effect of corn texture and the particle size on broiler performance, carcass yield, nutrient digestibility, and digestive organ morphometrics. In Experiment I, 720 male Cobb chicks were distributed in a completely randomized experimental design with a 2 x 3 factorial arrangement, consisting two <b>corn</b> textures (<b>dented</b> and hard) and three corn particle sizes, was applied, with four replicates of 30 birds each. Corn particle size was classified according to geometric mean diameter (GMD) as fine - 0. 46 mm; medium - 0. 73 mm, and coarse - 0. 87 mm. In Experiment II, 120 broiler chicks were used to evaluate corn digestibility during the periods of 16 to 22 days and 35 to 41 days of age, using the method of total excreta collection. In Experiment I, corn particle size influenced body weight, average weight gain, feed intake and feed conversion ratio of 21 -day-old birds. Corn texture and particle size did not affect the performance of 42 -day-old broilers or carcass traits. In Experiment II, there was no influence of corn texture and particle size on digestive organ weights. <b>Dented</b> <b>corn</b> increased nitrogen excretion in the first trial, and hard corn improved dry matter digestibility in the second metabolic trial. Corn with fine particle size promotes better performance of broilers at 21 days of age. Hard corn results in higher dry matter digestibility and lower nitrogen excretion, and consequently higher production factor in 42 -day-old broilers...|$|R

40|$|A {{number of}} {{varieties}} of flint and <b>dent</b> <b>corns</b> {{have been successfully}} grown at the Experiment Station {{for the past ten}} years. A sufficiently large number of kinds have been under test to prove beyond question that all of the best flint varieties, the smaller dents and the semi-dents will fully mature in the locality of the Experiment Station, the extreme northern portion of the State; but the climatic conditions cannot be considered as especially favorable to corn growing, the seasons being rather too short and the general temperature too low for the medium and larger dents to be successfully cultivated. The most unfavorable condition comes from the regularity of the cool nights, one of suitable temperature for the best growth of corn being the exception. It is the tendency of all dents after being grown a few years in this climate to take on the appearance of flints. In the whole ten seasons {{there has not been a}} single failure of the flint and small dent varieties on the Station farm. This result comes no doubt partially from the fact that the seed has always been carefully selected and the ground put into the best possible condition before planting, and the tillage and irrigation given prompt and regular attention. It should be stated that this farm is located on upper bench land and is in direct line with the Logan River canyon. The regular night winds from this source undoubtedly delay the coming of the frosts of early fall. However, as a rule, the corn has been too far advanced when the first light frost came in less favored localities to have received any injury from this source. It is very probable that the seeming beneficial effects of the canyon winds in lengthening the season is more than counterbalanced by its injurious effects on the corn in splitting the leaves and breaking down some of the weaker stalks which must have reduced the yield decidedly...|$|R
40|$|During maize {{endosperm}} development, {{the cell}} cycle {{in the majority}} of cells switches from a mitotic to an endoreduplication cell cycle. This results in cells of varying ploidies within the tissue, and is presumed to be a factor in its rapid growth. Investigating the inheritance of variation in endoreduplication in maize endosperm will begin to elucidate the genetic mechanisms controlling it. It has been hypothesized that retinoblastoma-related proteins (RRBs) negatively regulate the G 1 /S transition during both mitotic and endoreduplication cell cycles. Testing this hypothesis in both mitotic cells and endoreduplicating endosperm cells will further our understanding of the molecular mechanisms regulating endoreduplication. Flow cytometry was used to assess the variability of endoreduplication in endosperms of maize inbred lines. High levels of endoreduplication were observed in popcorns relative to Midwestern <b>dent</b> <b>corns.</b> To study the genetic regulation of endoreduplication, four inbreds were crossed to B 73 and developing endosperms from parental, reciprocal F 1, and backcross generations were subjected to flow cytometric analysis. Maternal zygotic effects, often considered a form of parental imprinting, and maternal sporophytic effects were detected. To test the feasibility of introgressing a high endoreduplication phenotype into a Midwestern dent inbred line, a backcross population was generated using B 73 as the reciprocal parent and the popcorn Sg 18. The heritabilities calculated from an analysis of the backcross population generally agree with the values calculated in the larger crossing experiments. The Wheat Dwarf Virus RepA protein binds RRBs and is predicted to activate the cell cycle. RepA and the maize RRB, ZmRb 1, were tested for cell cycle regulatory activity in tobacco BY- 2 cells and determined to be an activator and repressor, respectively. The effect of RepA on endoreduplication was evaluated in both mitotically-active maize callus cultures and developing endosperms. Flow cytometric measurements of nuclear ploidy showed that RepA expression was sufficient to convert a mitotic into an endoreduplication cell cycle in calli but had no discernable effect on endopolyploidy in developing endosperm by 18 -days after pollination (DAP) ...|$|R

40|$|Maize was domesticated from {{teosinte}} in Mexico some 7, 000 to 10, 000 {{years ago}} and quickly spread through the Americas. It {{has become one of}} the most important crops at a local and global level. Two types, Northern Flint <b>corn</b> and Southern <b>Dent</b> <b>corns</b> provided the basis of the genetic background of modern maize hybrids. The development of hybrids, first double-cross and later single-cross hybrids, along with a transition to high input farming provided huge yield increases, which have continued to improve with improving technology. ^ Increase in maize production also caused a rise in Western corn Rootworm (Diabrotica virgifera virgifera LeConte). As maize cultivation increased it spread from Eastern Colorado into Nebraska in the 50 ’s, Indiana by the 70 ’s and the East coast by the 90 ’s, and even Europe in 1992. A broadcast soil application of organochlorine insecticides was a common control tactic beginning in the late 40 s. By 1959 control failures were noted and resistance spread with the concurrent corn rootworm range expansion. Resistance spread into areas where organochlorine insecticides had never been used. New modes of action were adopted and, more importantly, new management practices reducing selective pressure. In 2003 Bt traits for rootworm control were released, but by 2009 resistance was documented. The Western corn rootworm has proven highly adaptable to control measures, including rotation. ^ Many challenges face agriculture in the future include water use, soil degradation, pest and disease control issues, and stagnant yield potentials. Despite these challenges, a great deal of technological advances such as precision agriculture, improved molecular techniques, and better adoption and implementation of Integrated Pest Management will provide effective tools for addressing these challenges. ^ Addressing the challenges of the future is not an issue of technology. Maize is more than a commodity; it has been and continues to be an essential part of our culture. The objective of this work is to illustrate that addressing the human dimension of these challenges will be crucial to addressing the current and future issues in agricultural production. Two separate examples of how this is being addressed are discussed. ...|$|R

It has a large ear with grains that are more white, round, and tender than the typical field corn grain. The dried grains are soaked and/or cooked in water with lime or wood ash, then rinsed thoroughly to remove the outer seed coat as well as any traces of the alkali salts (from the lime or ash)—this is an ancient process called nixtamalization. This creates a fresh, wet hominy, which can be dried for later use or ground into a flour called masa to make tortillas, tamales, atole, pozole, etc... (the dry hominy can also be ground to make dry masa). When boiling the grains, they open by themselves like a flower, and a loose foam appears. The primary use of cacahuazintle grain is in the embodiment of the traditional Mexican dish pozole.

40|$|Compared with floury or high-moisture corns, dry corn with {{a greater}} {{percentage}} of vitreous endosperm has been demonstrated to be negatively related to starch digestibility and milk yield of lactating dairy cows. Starch granules in corn are encapsulated by hydrophobic prolamin proteins that are innately insoluble in the rumen environment. Corn prolamin proteins are named zein, and laboratory methods to quantify zein exist but are seldom employed in ruminant nutrition because of their arduous nature. In this study, advances in cereal chemistry were combined with rapid turbidimetric methods yielding a modified turbidimetric zein method (mTZM) to quantify zein in whole corn.

The ability of mTZM to differentiate corn endosperm types as defined by least significant difference was 2. 6 g of zein/ 100 g of starch. Ten high-moisture corns of varying moisture content were also evaluated using the mTZM. Zein content of high-moisture corns as defined by mTZM ranged from 8. 3 to 2. 8 g of zein/ 100 g of starch with a least significant difference of 1. 2 g of zein/ 100 g of starch.

The aim of our work was to obtain a good and reliable diagnostic method and to start to study the biodiversity of MDMV. We have obtained a good specific antiserum directed against the capsid protein of the virus. In 1991, we started a collec-tion now made up of more than 100 isolates from southern France, {{the northern part of}} Italy and some areas of north-ern Spain. The molecular weights of the capsid protein of all the isolates were determined by the immunoblot method. We have been able to classify the isolates in different groups. The behaviour of the isolates belonging to each group defined by Western blot was analysed by mechanical inoculation on several maize inbred lines. We have thus demon-strated a biodiversity in MDMV. This situation is important for the breeder and allows {{a better understanding of the}} behaviour of inbred lines of maize in different areas. maize dwarf mosaic virus A (MDMV-A) / Zea mays L = maize / biodiversity Résumé &mdash; Diversité biologique et sérologique des potyvirus infectant le maïs en zone méditerranéenne.
