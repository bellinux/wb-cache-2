25|$|Winston Churchill {{campaigned for}} the 1945 and 1950 general {{elections}} in the DB18 two-door <b>drophead</b> coupé he had ordered in 1939. The government ordered new limousines for the commanding officers of the occupying forces. New straight-eights were supplied to the former colonies for the planned royal tours.|$|E
25|$|Rover took a {{controlling}} interest in Alvis in 1965 and a Rover-designed mid-engined V8 coupé prototype named the P6BS was rumoured {{to be the}} new Alvis model but with the takeover by British Leyland this too was shelved. By the time the TF 21 was launched in 1966, (available, like its predecessors in both saloon and <b>drophead</b> form and with either manual or automatic gearbox), the model was beginning to show its age despite a top speed of 127mph – the fastest Alvis ever produced. With only 109 sold and with political troubles aplenty in the UK car manufacturing business at that time, production finally ceased in 1967.|$|E
500|$|Lucan's {{daily routine}} {{consisted}} of breakfast at 9:00am, coffee, {{dealing with the}} morning's letters, reading the newspapers, and playing the piano. He sometimes jogged in the park and, while he owned him, took his Doberman Pinscher for walks. Lunch at the Clermont Club was followed by afternoon games of backgammon. Returning home to change into evening dress, the earl typically spent {{the remainder of the}} day at the Clermont, gambling into the early hours, watched sometimes by Veronica. In 1956, while still working at Brandt's, he had written of his desire to have [...] "£2m in the bank", claiming that [...] "motor-cars, yachts, expensive holidays and security for the future would give myself {{and a lot of other}} people a lot of pleasure". He was described by his friends as a shy and taciturn man, but with his tall stature, [...] "luxuriant guardsman's moustache" [...] and masculine pursuits, his exploits made him popular. His profligacy extended to hiring private aircraft to take his friends to the races, asking a car dealer he knew to source an Aston Martin <b>drophead</b> coupé, drinking expensive Russian vodka and racing powerboats. In September 1966 he unsuccessfully screen tested for a part in Woman Times Seven, prompting him to automatically decline a later offer from film producer Cubby Broccoli, to screen test him for the role of James Bond.|$|E
2500|$|Between 1926 and 1937 Bertelli {{was both}} {{technical}} director and designer {{of all new}} Aston Martins, since known as [...] "Bertelli cars". They included the 1½-litre [...] "T-type", [...] "International", [...] "Le Mans", [...] "MKII" [...] and its racing derivative, the [...] "Ulster", and the 2-litre 15/98 and its racing derivative, the [...] "Speed Model". Most were open two-seater sports cars bodied by Bert Bertelli's brother , with {{a small number of}} long-chassis four-seater tourers, <b>dropheads</b> and saloons also produced.|$|R
25|$|Smith-Clarke {{retired in}} 1950 and Dunn {{took over as}} chief engineer. In 1950 a new chassis and six-cylinder 3–litre engine was {{announced}} and this highly successful engine became the basis of all Alvis models until production ceased in 1967. Saloon bodies for the TA 21, as the new model was called, again came from Mulliners of Birmingham as they had for the TA 14, with Tickford producing the <b>dropheads.</b> But with {{the first of these}} committing themselves in October 1954 to supply only Standard Triumph who purchased it in 1958 and the second being acquired by David Brown owner of Aston Martin Lagonda in late 1955, it was becoming clear that new arrangements would have to be made. Some of the most original and beautiful designs on the 3Litre chassis were being produced by master coachbuilder Carrosserie Herman Graber of Switzerland and indeed these often one-off–designed cars are highly sought after today. Graber had begun to use TA 14 chassis soon after the war building three Tropic coupés which were much admired. When the Three Litre chassis was introduced his bodies displayed at the Geneva Motor Shows in 1951 and 1952 attracted sufficient interest for Graber to set up a standing order of 30 chassis per year. Swiss-built Graber coupés were displayed on the Alvis stand at both Paris and London Motor Shows in October 1955.|$|R
500|$|A wooden {{boat was}} then carried in; on board was Annie Lennox who {{proceeded}} to sing [...] "Little Bird". Ed Sheeran followed and {{was joined by}} Richard Jones of The Feeling, Nick Mason of Pink Floyd and Mike Rutherford of Genesis and Mike + The Mechanics, to cover the Floyd's [...] "Wish You Were Here". Near {{the end of the}} song a performer appeared on a tightrope above the stadium, walked along it, and shook hands with a mannequin, which then burst into flames (referencing the cover of Floyd's 1975 album Wish You Were Here). A psychedelic bus then enters with Russell Brand sitting on top singing [...] "Pure Imagination" [...] from [...] "Willy Wonka & the Chocolate Factory" [...] then segues into [...] "I Am the Walrus"; before introducing Fatboy Slim, who played [...] "Right Here Right Now" [...] and [...] "The Rockafeller Skank"; as the bus slowly transformed into a large inflatable Octopus. Three convertible Rolls-Royce Phantom <b>Drophead</b> Coupés then arrived; the roof of the first was taken down to reveal Jessie J who sang her hit [...] "Price Tag", as the cars did a lap of the stadium. Jessie J provided guest vocals as the next car had its roof removed, to show Tinie Tempah who sang [...] "Written in the Stars". The third car carried Taio Cruz who sang [...] "Dynamite". All three then left the cars to combine to cover the Bee Gees' [...] "You Should Be Dancing".|$|E
2500|$|Due to {{increasing}} safety concerns, the last mass-produced car model with independently opening suicide doors {{sold in the}} United States was the Ford Thunderbird four-door sedan from 1967 to 1971. Similarly, the last mass-produced pickup truck with such doors was the Toyota Tundra from 2000 to 2002. [...] In 2003, the new Rolls-Royce Phantom (sold in the United Kingdom) reintroduced independent suicide doors in luxury vehicle applications. Other luxury models with classic suicide doors include the Spyker D8 and the Rolls-Royce Phantom <b>Drophead</b> Coupe four-seat convertible. However, the most recent mass-produced model with such doors has been the Rolls-Royce Phantom Series II introduced in 2012.|$|E

50|$|The Conquest Roadster {{was dropped}} from {{production}} in 1955. The dropheads had outsold them by over 3:1. Then a new <b>drophead</b> 4-seater and a <b>drophead</b> coupé {{version of the}} 2-seater Roadster were introduced at the 1955 Motor Show. This Mark II Conquest Roadster <b>drophead</b> coupé had a sideways-facing single rear seat, making the car a 2- or 3-seater and with wind-up side windows {{in place of the}} clip-on side-curtains of the continuing Mark II open 2-seater Conquest Roadster.|$|E
