5|$|In 1876 the Aylesbury and Buckingham Railway {{raised its}} prices for coal haulage. All coal hauled on the Tramway needed {{to pass along}} the A from Verney Junction or Aylesbury and Jones <b>had</b> <b>to</b> <b>raise</b> prices to cover the {{surcharge}} or keep prices stable despite the loss of profits. Road-hauled coal from Bicester was already undercutting the Tramway and the unreliable engines had given the Tramway a poor reputation. Jones kept prices fixed and absorb the increased costs, wrecking the Tramway's already declining business.|$|E
5|$|The society's {{offer was}} the only one to include an {{existing}} building on its grounds. The Board of Regents accepted the society's offer, and a formal transfer of the Romney Classical Institute's former campus was made. The society discovered that, in order to make good on its promise, it <b>had</b> <b>to</b> <b>raise</b> more than $1,000, a close to impossible task during the Reconstruction Era in Romney. Following a resolution on July 11, 1870, to raise between $1,200 and $1,300, a subscription of $1,383.60 was raised after 118 individuals and firms donated the needed funds, and shortly thereafter the formal transfer of the property was completed. At that time, the institute's property was valued at about $20,000.|$|E

5|$|Although {{the company}} had {{permission}} to construct the railway, it still <b>had</b> <b>to</b> <b>raise</b> the capital for the construction works. The BS was not alone; four other new tube railway companies were looking for investors– the Waterloo and City Railway (W), the Charing Cross, Euston and Hampstead Railway (CCE) and the Great Northern and City Railway (GN) (the three other companies that were put forward in bills in 1892) and the Central London Railway (CLR, which received royal assent in 1891). The original tube railway, the C, was also raising funds to construct extensions to its existing line. Only the W, which was the shortest line and was backed by the London and South Western Railway with a guaranteed dividend, was able to raise its funds without difficulty. For the BS and the rest, and others that came later, much of {{the remainder of the}} decade saw a struggle to find finance in an uninterested market.|$|E

5|$|By October 2007, Vildanden was {{in severe}} {{financial}} distress. An agreement {{was made with}} the municipal council, where the latter gave a credit loan to the airline. The route to Molde had given large deficits, and the company was forced to close it down. NOK2.3 million, equal to the airlines debt to the airport, was granted to the municipal-owned airport operator, and the company allowed to make an agreement where half the debt was deleted, {{and the other half}} made interest and principal-free for two years. At the same time, the management of Vildanden <b>had</b> <b>to</b> <b>raise</b> new capital equal to at least half the companies accounts payable, which was NOK8 million. The case raised local debate about whether it was the municipality's job to subsidize the airport and the airline. The Federation of Norwegian Aviation Industries announced that they would consider reporting the subsidies to the EFTA Surveillance Authority (ESA) for violation of the European Community competition law.|$|E

5|$|In 1985, Ma was {{appointed}} the Director of the Shanghai Museum. When {{the museum was}} omitted from Shanghai's five-year reconstruction plan in 1992, Ma lobbied Mayor Huang Ju for its rebuilding. After seeing the dilapidated rooms of the Zhonghui Building where the museum was then housed, Huang agreed to allocate a prime site on the People's Square, but the museum <b>had</b> <b>to</b> <b>raise</b> its own building funds. Ma raised US$25 million by leasing the old building to a Hong Kong developer. He also made many trips abroad to solicit donations, mainly from the Shanghai diaspora who had fled to Hong Kong after the Communist revolution, raising another US$10 million. The money still ran short, but he eventually persuaded the city government to allocate another 140 million yuan to complete the building.|$|E
5|$|The Hanzhong {{state was}} divided into 24 regions which were led by an official. Each {{district}} had a civil register which recorded people's names and ranks. Three times a year, the registers were updated {{at the same time}} as an important feast. While a child's rank rose automatically, adults <b>had</b> <b>to</b> <b>raise</b> their own rank through religious achievement or marriage. Higher ranked people had more divine generals at their command, which could be used to fight demons that caused bad luck or disease. The state had a system of law that encouraged confession and benevolence rather than strict punishment. Criminals were asked to confess their crimes and meditate, and were given public work to do as a sentence. Few texts written by the Hanzhong Celestial Masters survive, with the most important being the Xiang'er commentary to the Dao De Jing. While the Hanzhong state lasted for only twenty-five years, their beliefs influenced all subsequent Daoist movements.|$|E

On 5 December 1861 the New South Wales Parliament enacted a bill to form the Wagga Wagga Company Bridge to build a bridge not less than 25 feet wide and 7 feet in height. The Act gave the Company authority to receive a toll, not exceeding £5 for most persons using the bridge. The Company's directors <b>had</b> <b>to</b> <b>raise</b> loans because the shares were not readily purchased as many people feared the bridge would be washed away by floods.

The airport did not have any scheduled flights, but Norsk Hydro operated a number of charter flights, mostly to Oslo, operated by Coast Aero Center. At first, the airport did not have any employees, so the snow clearance was done by the municipality. In early 1986, the airport's two first employees were hired, both working with flight information service. The airport had no rights for any state grants, so the company <b>had</b> <b>to</b> <b>raise</b> additional capital to cover operating expenses and pay the NOK2.5 million the instrument landing system cost. In March 1986 the airport was granted NOK1.5 from the Ministry of Finance to cover parts of the cost.

25|$|The Romans {{simultaneously}} received news of Hannibal's {{crossing of}} the Ebro and of an uprising in northern Italy of the Gallic tribes Boii and Insubres. These had established diplomatic contact with the Carthaginians and joined them as allies against their common enemy, Rome. The first objective of the insurgents were the Roman colonies of Placentia and Cremona, causing the Romans to flee to Mutina (modern Modena), which the Gauls then besieged. In response, Praetor L. Manlius Vulso marched with two legions and allies, {{for a total of}} 1,600 cavalry and 20,000 infantry, to Cisalpine Gaul. This army was ambushed twice on the way from Ariminium, losing 1,200 men; although the siege of Mutina was raised, the army itself fell under a loose siege a few kilometers from Mutina. This event prompted the Roman Senate to send one of Scipio's legions and 5,000 allied troops to aid Vulso. Scipio <b>had</b> <b>to</b> <b>raise</b> fresh troops to replace these and thus could not set out for Iberia until September 218 BC, giving Hannibal time to march from the Ebro to the Rhone.|$|E
