5|$|Raëlism (also {{known as}} Raëlianism or the Raëlian movement) is a UFO {{religion}} that {{was founded in}} 1974 by Claude Vorilhon (b. 1946), now known as Raël. The Raëlian Movement teaches that life on Earth was scientifically created by a species of extraterrestrials, which they call the Elohim. Members of this species appeared human when having personal contacts with {{the descendants of the}} humans that they made. They purposefully misinformed early <b>humanity</b> <b>that</b> they were angels, cherubim, or gods. Raëlians believe that messengers, or prophets, of the Elohim include Buddha, Jesus, and others who informed humans of each era. The founder of Raëlism received the final message of the Elohim and that its purpose is to inform the world about Elohim and that if humans become aware and peaceful enough, they wish to be welcomed by them.|$|E

25|$|It is this {{commitment}} to man's dignity and relief of <b>humanity</b> <b>that</b> inspires the Ismā'īlī Imāmat's philanthropic institutions. Giving of one's competence, sharing one's time, material or intellectual ability with those among whom one lives, for {{the relief of}} hardship, pain or ignorance is a deeply ingrained tradition which shapes the social conscience of the Ismā'īlī Muslim community.|$|E
25|$|I {{wrote in}} {{detail about the}} Holocaust and said I {{did not want to}} discuss numbers. I quoted an {{argument}} between historians in which various numbers of casualties were mentioned. One wrote there were 12million victims and another wrote there were 800,000. I have no desire to argue with the figures. The Holocaust was a terrible, unforgivable crime against the Jewish nation, a crime against <b>humanity</b> <b>that</b> cannot be accepted by humankind. The Holocaust was a terrible thing and nobody can claim I denied it.|$|E
25|$|Judaism defines {{altruism}} as {{the desired}} goal of creation. The famous Rabbi Abraham Isaac Kook stated {{that love is}} the most important attribute in humanity. This is defined as bestowal, or giving, which is the intention of altruism. This can be altruism towards <b>humanity</b> <b>that</b> leads to altruism towards the creator or God. Kabbalah defines God as the force of giving in existence. Rabbi Moshe Chaim Luzzatto in particular focused on the 'purpose of creation' and how the will of God was to bring creation into perfection and adhesion with this upper force.|$|E

25|$|The Orthodox Church {{understands the}} death and resurrection of Christ Jesus to be real {{historical}} events, {{as described in the}} gospels of the New Testament. Jesus Christ, the Son of God, was in his <b>humanity</b> (<b>that</b> is, in history) crucified, and died, descending into Hades (Sheol), the place of the dead, as all humans do. But He, alone among humans, has two natures, one human, one divine, which are indivisible and inseparable from each other through the mystery of the incarnation. Hades could not restrain the infinite God. Christ in His divine nature captured the keys of Hades and broke the bonds which had imprisoned the human souls who had been held there through their separation from God.|$|E
25|$|The {{purpose of}} {{archaeology}} {{is to learn}} more about past societies and the development of the human race. Over 99% of the development of humanity has occurred within prehistoric cultures, who did not make use of writing, thereby no written records exist for study purposes. Without such written sources, the only way to understand prehistoric societies is through archaeology. Because archaeology is the study of past human activity, it stretches back to about 2.5 million years ago when we find the first stone tools - The Oldowan Industry. Many important developments in human history occurred during prehistory, such as the evolution of humanity during the Paleolithic period, when the hominins developed from the australopithecines in Africa and eventually into modern Homo sapiens. Archaeology also sheds light on many of humanity's technological advances, for instance the ability to use fire, the development of stone tools, the discovery of metallurgy, the beginnings of religion and the creation of agriculture. Without archaeology, we would know little or nothing about the use of material culture by <b>humanity</b> <b>that</b> pre-dates writing.|$|E

I did not lose interest in developing the Christian tradition so as to render it intelligible, convincing, and illuminating in a changing context.

I was persuaded that no problem could be more critical {{than that of a}} decent survival of a <b>humanity</b> <b>that</b> threatened to destroy itself by exhausting and polluting its natural context." ...|$|E

40|$|The aim of {{this essay}} is to through {{descriptive}} qualitative content analysis investigate how seven different {{institutions of higher education}} in Sweden present the Humanities, and what kind of brand identity that emerges from the texts. The essay also aims to investigate if the brand identity bears any of the characteristics of the challenge-driven <b>Humanities</b> <b>that</b> the think-tank Humtank promote (the analysed universities all have representatives in Humtank). The results show that {{there is a tendency to}} repetitiveness, and that there seems so be a certain insecurity about what the Humanities are supposed to be, and especially what their field of competence is, as well as what role the Humanities play in today’s society. Only one of the universities show clear traces of the challenge driven <b>Humanities</b> <b>that</b> Humtanks promote...|$|R

In July, over 30 governments recognized the NTC as the legitimate government of Libya; Gaddafi called on his supporters to [...] "Trample on those recognitions, trample on them under your feet...

500|$|J.C.A. Gaskin {{challenges}} the first {{premise of the}} argument from moral objectivity, arguing {{that it must be}} shown why absolute and objective morality entails that morality is commanded by God, rather than simply a human invention. [...] It could be the consent of <b>humanity</b> <b>that</b> gives it moral force, for example. American philosopher Michael Martin argues that it is not necessarily true that objective moral truths must entail the existence of God, suggesting that there could be alternative explanations: he argues that naturalism may be an acceptable explanation and, even if a supernatural explanation is necessary, it {{does not have to be}} God (polytheism is a viable alternative). Martin also argues that a non-objective account of ethics might be acceptable and {{challenges the}} view that a subjective account of morality would lead to moral anarchy.|$|E
500|$|The {{plant in}} front of John the Baptist has aspects of both hyssop and cornflower, yet is most likely a hyssop because it grows from a wall. Cornflower is an {{attribute}} of Christ and symbolizes Heaven while hyssop symbolizes both the humility of Christ and baptism. There is a citron tree in the background, which represents the Cedar of Lebanon. Michelangelo uses the hyssop and tree as a visual representation of a quote by Rabanus Maurus, [...] "From the Cedar of Lebanon to the hyssop which grows on a stony wall we have {{an explanation of the}} Divinity which Christ has in his Father and of the <b>humanity</b> <b>that</b> he derives from the Virgin Mary."
