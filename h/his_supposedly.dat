5|$|In the episode, Jack Donaghy (Alec Baldwin) {{begins to}} search for his {{biological}} father with help from Liz Lemon (Tina Fey). Meanwhile, Tracy Jordan (Tracy Morgan) introduces <b>his</b> <b>supposedly</b> illegitimate son (Washington) to {{the cast and crew}} of the fictitious show The Girlie Show with Tracy Jordan (TGS), but some question his intentions. At the same time, Jenna Maroney (Jane Krakowski) and Liz fight for attention when Jenna gets public recognition for a comedic sketch Liz wrote.|$|E
5|$|Homer gets a {{magazine}} loaded with personality tests and quizzes {{his friends and}} family with them. Later on, he takes his own test which reveals that has only three years left to live. Terrified of <b>his</b> <b>supposedly</b> impending death, he develops insomnia and goes insane. Homer visits the Springfield Nuclear Power Plant's psychiatrist, who suggests that he take a long vacation. The Simpsons go on a trip to Florida and find themselves {{in the middle of a}} raucous spring break when they get there. Marge wants Homer to stay in his hotel room, but he escapes to party and attends a concert featuring Joe C. and Kid Rock. Homer becomes the life of spring break until it ends and the wild college students return to their studies.|$|E
5|$|In early September, Levene {{was fired}} from the Clash. Strummer would claim that Levene's dwindling {{interest}} in the band owed to <b>his</b> <b>supposedly</b> extravagant use of speed, a charge Levene has denied. Levene and Lydon would form Public Image Ltd. in 1978. On 21 September, the Clash performed publicly {{for the first time}} without Levene at another seminal concert: the 100 Club Punk Special, sharing the bill with the Sex Pistols, Siouxsie and the Banshees and Subway Sect. Chimes left in late November; he was briefly replaced by Rob Harper as the Clash toured in support of the Sex Pistols during December's Anarchy Tour.|$|E

5|$|Randy Savage, who {{continued}} to sell <b>his</b> <b>supposedly</b> injured leg, lost the title to Ric Flair at a television taping on September 1, 1992 in Hershey, Pennsylvania. During the match Flair received help not only from Mr Perfect but also from newcomer Razor Ramon, igniting a feud between Savage and Ramon. Bret Hart claimed in a 2014 interview that WWF owner Vince McMahon had worked out the title-change match with Flair and Savage before hand, {{and that he was}} angry when they returned to the dressing room after the match because they had failed to do much of what was agreed upon. McMahon was that angry that he actually made them go straight back out and re-do the whole match. After producing much the same match that they had immediately prior, McMahon allegedly threw his headset onto the table and stormed off in frustration.|$|E
25|$|The plot {{centers around}} an orphan known as Tobei {{who lived in}} Japan 300 years ago and {{committed}} countless violent crimes {{until the age of}} 16, when he was beheaded by villagers and subsequently sent to Hell as punishment. During <b>his</b> <b>supposedly</b> eternal punishment, Tobei made repeated escape attempts and became known for a particularly fiery spirit, everlasting determination, and a continuing refusal to repent for his sins.|$|E
25|$|Later that year, Sade was tricked {{into going}} to Paris to visit <b>his</b> <b>supposedly</b> ill mother, who in fact had {{recently}} died. He was arrested there and imprisoned in the Château de Vincennes. He successfully appealed his death sentence in 1778, but remained imprisoned under the lettre de cachet. He escaped but was soon recaptured. He resumed writing and met fellow prisoner Comte de Mirabeau, who also wrote erotic works. Despite this common interest, the two came to dislike each other intensely.|$|E

25|$|Gustl Ferdinand Mollath (born 7 November 1956 in Nuremberg) is a German man who {{was acquitted}} during a {{criminal}} trial in 2006 {{on the basis of}} diminished criminal responsibility; he was committed to a high-security psychiatric hospital, as the court deemed him a danger to the public and declared him insane based on expert diagnoses of paranoid personality disorder. Mollath's forensic incarceration for seven years and the surrounding legal judgments became the basis of a public controversy in Bavaria and the whole of Germany when at least some underlying elements of <b>his</b> <b>supposedly</b> fabricated paranoid story about money-laundering activities at a major bank turned out to be true after all. Mollath himself had consistently claimed there was a conspiracy to have him locked up in a psychiatric care ward because of his incriminating knowledge; evidence turned up in 2012 made his claims appear plausible.|$|E
25|$|The strong {{majority}} {{held by the}} Conservatives gave Baldwin a full term {{during which}} the government {{had to deal with}} the 1926 General Strike. Unemployment remained high but relatively stable at just over 10% and, apart from 1926, strikes were at a low level. At the May 1929 election, Labour won 288 seats to the Conservatives' 260, with 59 Liberals under Lloyd George holding the balance of power. MacDonald was increasingly out of touch with <b>his</b> <b>supposedly</b> safe Welsh seat at Aberavon; he largely ignored the district, and had little time or energy to help with its increasingly difficult problems regarding coal disputes, strikes, unemployment, and poverty. The miners expected a wealthy man who would fund party operations, but he had no money. He disagreed with the increasingly radical activism of party leaders in the district, as well as the permanent agent, and the South Wales Mineworkers Federation. He moved to Seaham Harbour in County Durham, a safer seat, in order to avoid a highly embarrassing defeat.|$|E
25|$|The {{death of}} the Black Prince on 8 June 1376 and the onset of Edward III's last illness at the closing of Parliament on 10 July left John with all the reins of power. He {{immediately}} had the ailing king grant pardons to all the officials impeached by the Parliament; Alice Perrers too was reinstated {{at the heart of}} the king's household. John impeached William of Wykeham and other leaders of the reform movement, and secured their conviction on old or trumped-up charges. The parliament of 1377 was John's counter-coup: crucially, the Lords no longer supported the Commons and John was able to have most of the acts of 1376 annulled. He also succeeded in forcing the Commons to agree to the imposition of the first Poll Tax in English history — a viciously regressive measure that bore hardest on the poorest members of society. There was organised opposition to his measures and rioting in London; John of Gaunt's arms were reversed or defaced wherever they were displayed, and protestors pasted up lampoons on <b>his</b> <b>supposedly</b> dubious birth. At one point he was forced to take refuge across the Thames, while his Savoy Palace only just escaped looting. It was rumoured (and believed by many people in England and France) that he intended to seize the throne for himself and supplant the rightful heir, his nephew Richard, the son of the Black Prince, but there seems to have been no truth in this and on the death of Edward III and the accession of the child Richard II, John sought no position of regency for himself and withdrew to his estates.|$|E

5000|$|Note: The {{official}} time {{printed in}} the CD liner notes is 3:51, but the track actually extends to 6:32, and includes a little hidden audio clip of Sherinian and <b>his</b> friends <b>supposedly</b> celebrating the new album release.|$|R
500|$|Vanbrugh's {{preface to}} the first edition {{preserves}} a single fleeting concrete detail about the première performance: George Powell was drunk.

500|$|While Nash {{had great}} success in football, he faced {{opposition}} from the cricket establishment for <b>his</b> <b>supposedly</b> poor attitude towards authority. This led fellow cricketer Keith Miller to write that his non-selection as a regular Test player was [...] "the greatest waste of talent in Australian cricket history".|$|E
500|$|Moments later, Kujan {{realizes that}} Verbal's entire story was a lie, pieced {{together}} from details {{on a crowded}} bulletin board in the office. Meanwhile, Verbal walks outside, gradually dropping his limp and flexing <b>his</b> <b>supposedly</b> withered hand. As Kujan runs after Verbal, a fax comes in from the hospital where the gangster Kovash is being treated for his burns: a police sketch artist's rendering of Söze, dictated by Kovash, that looks exactly like Verbal. Kujan misses Verbal by moments, as the latter disappears into a car driven by [...] "Kobayashi".|$|E

500|$|In {{order to}} {{preserve}} {{the security of the}} upcoming South Vietnamese operation, General Abrams had imposed a rare press embargo on the reporting of troop movements, but it was to no avail. Communist and non-American news agencies released reports of the build-up and even before the lifting of the embargo on 4 February, speculation concerning the offensive was front page news in the U.S. As had been the case during the Cambodian campaign, the government of Laos was not notified in advance of the intended operation. Prime Minister Souvanna Phouma would learn of the invasion of the PAVN occupied portions of <b>his</b> <b>supposedly</b> [...] "neutral" [...] nation only after it was under way.|$|E
500|$|At first, Nielsen's works did {{not gain}} {{sufficient}} recognition {{for him to}} be able to support himself. During the concert which saw the premiere of his First Symphony on 14 March 1894 conducted by Svendsen, Nielsen played in the second violin section. The symphony was a great success when played in Berlin in 1896, contributing significantly to his reputation. He was increasingly in demand to write incidental music for the theatre as well as cantatas for special occasions, both of which provided a welcome source of additional income. Fanning comments on the relationship which developed between his programmatic and symphonic works: [...] "Sometimes he would find stageworthy ideas in <b>his</b> <b>supposedly</b> pure orchestral music; sometimes a text or scenario forced him to invent vivid musical imagery which he could later turn to more abstract use." ...|$|E
500|$|Apple Records issued Ringo on 2 November 1973 with [...] "I'm the Greatest" [...] sequenced as {{the opening}} track. Combined with the closing song, [...] "You and Me (Babe)", written by Harrison and Mal Evans, [...] "I'm the Greatest" [...] {{provided}} the album with a loose concept {{in the form}} of a stage show. The same theme was reflected in the painting used for the LP cover, which showed the album title spelt out in bright lights on a theatre stage, and Voormann, Ono, Lennon, Harrison and Perry among the characters along the front row of the theatre's balcony. Among his lithographs appearing in the LP booklet, Voormann represented [...] "I'm the Greatest" [...] with an image of Starr as a statue, with his fist raised, towering high above an open space filled with minuscule figures. Recalling the release in 1981, Woffinden said the lithograph reflected the album's [...] "quintessentially Ringo" [...] quality, whereby Starr's gifts were revealed in his ability to unite <b>his</b> <b>supposedly</b> more talented colleagues.|$|E

2500|$|As {{early as}} June 2015, FiveThirtyEight argued that Donald Trump [...] "isn't a real candidate" [...] and {{maintained}} that Trump could {{not win the}} nomination, {{until late in the}} election season. When Donald Trump became the presumptive Republican nominee in May 2016, New York Times media columnist Jim Rutenberg wrote that [...] "predictions can have consequences" [...] and criticized FiveThirtyEight for underestimating Trump's chances. He argued that by giving [...] "Mr. Trump a 2 percent chance at the nomination despite strong polls in his favor...they also arguably sapped the journalistic will to scour his record as aggressively as those of <b>his</b> <b>supposedly</b> more serious rivals".|$|E
2500|$|Clay was {{surprised}} by Van Buren's defeat but remained confident of his chances in the 1844 election, and Whigs mocked Polk for his relative obscurity. However, Polk, a former Governor of Tennessee, convinced Tyler {{to drop out of}} the race and effectively courted the various factions of Democrats. Clay's running mate, Theodore Frelinghuysen, was attacked for his affiliation with anti-Catholic groups. In July, Clay wrote two letters in which he attempted to clarify his position on the annexation of Texas, and Democrats attacked <b>his</b> <b>supposedly</b> inconsistent position. Because of Clay's appearance in three elections, his opponents dubbed him [...] "the same old coon." [...] Clay embraced the phase and used it in his campaign.|$|E
