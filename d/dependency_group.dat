40|$|Purpose: The {{purpose of}} this study was to analyze the effects of a quit smoking program using the Web and short message service on exhaled carbon monoxide, self-efficacy, and {{depression}} according to nicotine dependency level in undergraduate students. Methods: In this study a non-equivalent control group pretest-posttest design was applied. The participants included 90 students (52 in the low nicotine <b>dependency</b> <b>group</b> and 38 in the high nicotine <b>dependency</b> <b>group)</b> who succeeded in quitting smoking. Data were collected on 3 occasions, that is, before the program, immediately after the program, and 3 weeks after the program. Collected data were ana-lyzed using independent t-test, repeated measure ANOVA, and paired t-test with SPSS 20. 0. Results: Exhaled carbon monoxide was higher in the high nicotine <b>dependency</b> <b>group</b> than in the low nicotine <b>dependency</b> <b>group.</b> Self-efficacy significantly increased 3 weeks after the program in the low nicotine <b>dependency</b> <b>group</b> and significantly increased immediately after the program in the high nicotine <b>dependency</b> <b>group.</b> Depression significantly decreased 3 weeks after the program in the low nicotine <b>dependency</b> <b>group.</b> Conclusion: Self-efficacy may be enhanced when it is dealt with during an early phase of the quit smoking program for the high nicotine dependen...|$|E
40|$|AbstractIn this study, {{empirical}} {{analyses are}} performed {{to study the}} effects of oil price changes on inflation in two groups of countries, namely the high versus low oil dependency groups. In addition, we also compare the relative effect of oil price with other types of shocks such as real exchange rate, domestic output and exporters’ production cost. We model the pass-through equation in an autoregressive distributed lag (ARDL) format and the model is estimated using pooled mean group method. Our results reveal that oil price change has its direct effect on domestic inflation in low oil <b>dependency</b> <b>group</b> but its impact is indirect on affecting the domestic inflation in the high oil <b>dependency</b> <b>group</b> through changes on the exporter's production cost. The main determinants of domestic inflation are real exchange rate and exporter's production cost (high oil <b>dependency</b> <b>group)</b> and domestic output and exporter's production cost (low oil <b>dependency</b> <b>group).</b> We suggest the policymaker to stabilize the effects of these shocks through monetary policy accommodate...|$|E

Finally, the results of simulations for experiments of single piles subjected to lateral reversed or one-sided cyclic loading, and a large-scale shake table experiment of a pile-group, show that the proposed hysteretic p-y curve can account for the experimental results...|$|E
40|$|In {{the context}} of the {{continuing}} debate about how responsibility for the care of the disabled, chronically sick and elderly (collectively termed <b>dependency</b> <b>groups)</b> should be allocated as between the family and state and informal and formal caring agencies, this paper reports the basic findings of a survey of care preferences advocated by the public in three locations in Scotland, an urban metropolis, a large city and a small town in a rural setting. The results show that while there is little difference in preference patterns between the locations the public is discriminating in its support for care arrangements for patient/client groups with age-related physical and mental impairment. Overall, there is considerable support for a range of services termed community based professional care [...] day care centres, day hospitals and in respect of the elderly, sheltered housing. Residential care is less often preferred with the notable exception of senile dementia. Similarly, there is only limited support for informal care without professional involvement. The public, it seems, are not inclined to allocate the major responsibility for the care of <b>dependency</b> <b>groups</b> to the family and close kin preferring instead a continued policy of partnership between informal care systems and the welfare state in which the former does not replace the latter. ...|$|R

40|$|The {{transformation}} of groups of previously nonviolent individuals into repetitive killers of defenceless {{members of society}} has been a recurring phenomenon throughout history. This transformation is characterised {{by a set of}} symptoms and signs suggesting a common syndrome—Syndrome E. Affected individuals show obsessive ideation, compulsive repetition, rapid desensitisation to violence, diminished affective reactivity, hyperarousal, environmental <b>dependency,</b> <b>group</b> contagion, and failure to adapt to changing stimulus-reinforcement associations. Yet memory, language, planning, and problem-solving skills remain intact. The main risk factors are male sex and age between 15 and 50. A pathophysiological model—“cognitive fracture”—is hypothesised, where hyperaroused orbitofrontal and medial prefrontal cortices tonically inhibit the amygdala and are no longer regulated by visceral and somatic homoeostatic controls ordinarily supplied by subcortical systems. It is proposed that the syndrome is a product of neocortical development rather than the manifestation of a disinhibited primitive brain. Early recognition of symptoms and signs could lead to prevention through education and isolation of affected individuals. Repeatedly throughout history, groups of individuals, usually young men, have violently attacked other members of society, often with the approval of, or encouragement from, those in authority.

40|$|Learning Objectives: Alcohol related admissions to {{critical}} care are increasing. However, there is {{uncertainty about the}} optimum rehabilitation approach for this group of patients and the impact which alcohol use disorders have on recovery. This study aimed to explore the impact of alcohol use disorders on recovery from intensive care. Methods: Patients who had been ventilated for greater than 72 hours in one University teaching hospital were recruited. Data was collected using in depth semi structured interviews with patients three to seven months post ICU discharge. On admission to the ICU patients were allocated {{to one of three}} alcohol groups: low risk; harmful/hazardous or alcohol dependency. Patients from each of the three study groups were purposively sampled and data analysis was undertaken using Interpretative Phenomenological Analysis. Analysis explored both the similarities and differences between the three study groups. Results: 21 patients were interviewed over 12 months. six patients from the low risk group; six patients from the harmful/hazardous group and nine patients with from the alcohol <b>dependency</b> <b>group.</b> These interviews focused on the patient’s experience of intensive care and recovery from critical illness, including the impact of alcohol use disorders. Four themes which impacted on recovery from ICU were identified in this patient group: psychological resilience; impact and support for activities of daily living; social support and cohesion and the impact of alcohol use disorders on recovery. Conclusions: There is a significant interplay between alcohol misuse and recovery from critical illness, with haphazard approaches to rehabilitation. A more targeted rehabilitation pathway for all patients leaving critical care, with specific emphasis on alcohol misuse if appropriate, needs to be generated. </p...|$|E

STUDY DESIGN: Longitudinal cohort study. SETTING: Southern Alberta regional center located at high altitude. PARTICIPANTS: Preterm infants weighing ≤ 1250 grams with no BPD, BPD, and BPD with chronic oxygen dependency. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Neurodevelopmental and growth outcomes. RESULTS: Of 1563 preterm infants admitted from 1995 - 2007, 1212 survived. Complete follow-up data were available for 1030 (85 %) children. Children in BPD and BPD with chronic oxygen <b>dependency</b> <b>groups</b> had significantly lower birth weights, gestational ages, prolonged mechanical ventilation and oxygen supplementation and received more postnatal steroids, compared to those without BPD. Children with BPD and BPD with chronic oxygen dependency {{were more likely to}} be below the 5 th centile in weight and height compared to those without BPD but there was little difference between the BPD and BPD with chronic oxygen <b>dependency</b> <b>groups.</b> After controlling for confounding variables, children who had BPD and BPD with chronic oxygen dependency had higher odds of neurodevelopmental disability compared to those without BPD [OR (odds ratio) 1. 9 (95 %CI 1. 1 to 3. 5) and OR 1. 8 (1. 1 to 2. 9), respectively], with no significant difference between BPD and BPD with chronic oxygen dependency [OR 0. 9 (95 % CI 0. 6 to 1. 5) ]. CONCLUSIONS: BPD and BPD with chronic oxygen dependency in children predicts abnormal neurodevelopmental outcomes at 36 months CA. However, the neurodevelopmental disability rates were not significantly higher in BPD with chronic oxygen dependency children compared to children with BPD only. Compared to those without BPD, growth is impaired in children with BPD and BPD with chronic oxygen dependency, but no difference between the latter two groups...|$|R

40|$|Bayesian networks, and {{especially}} their structures, are powerful tools for representing conditional independencies and dependencies between random variables. In applications where related variables form a priori known groups, chosen to represent different "views" to or {{aspects of the}} same entities, one may {{be more interested in}} modeling <b>dependencies</b> between <b>groups</b> of variables rather than between individual variables. Motivated by this, we study prospects of representing relationships between variable groups using Bayesian network structures.

We also show that one cannot learn causal relations between groups using only groupwise conditional independencies, but also variable-wise relations are needed.
