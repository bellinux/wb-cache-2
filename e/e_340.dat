Cyclic nucleotide-gated channels {{have been found}} in a variety of cells and extensively investigated in the past few years. Glutamate residues at position 363 of the alpha subunit of the bovine retinal rod channel have previously been shown to constitute a cation-binding site important for blockage by external divalent cations and to control single-channel properties. It has therefore been assumed, but not proven, that glutamate residues at the corresponding position of the other cyclic nucleotide-gated channels play a similar role. We studied the corresponding glutamate (<b>E</b> <b>340)</b> of the alpha subunit of the bovine olfactory channel to determine its role in channel gating and in permeation and blockage by Ca 2 + and Mg 2 +. <b>E</b> <b>340</b> was mutated into either an aspartate, glycine, glutamine, or asparagine residue and properties of mutant channels expressed in Xenopus laevis oocytes were measured in excised patches. By single-channel recordings, we demonstrated that the open probabilities in the presence of cGMP or cAMP were decreased by the mutations, with a larger decrease observed on gating by cAMP. Moreover, we observed that the mutant <b>E</b> <b>340</b> N presented two conductance levels. We found that both external Ca 2 + and Mg 2 + powerfully blocked the current in wild-type and <b>E</b> <b>340</b> D mutants, whereas their blockage efficacy was drastically reduced when the glutamate charge was neutralized. The inward current carried by external Ca 2 + relative to Na+ was larger in the <b>E</b> <b>340</b> G mutant compared with wild-type channels. In conclusion, we have confirmed that the residue at position <b>E</b> <b>340</b> of the bovine olfactory CNG channel is in the pore region, controls permeation and blockage by external Ca 2 + and Mg 2 +, and affects channel gating by cAMP more than by cGMP...|$|E
40|$|The {{functional}} properties of {{dissolved organic matter}} (DOM) from Rough Sike, a stream draining blanket peat in the northern Pennines, UK, were investigated using a series of 12 standardised assays. Nine stream samples were collected at different discharges during 2003 - 2006, and DOM concentrates obtained by low-temperature rotary evaporation. Suwannee River Fulvic Acid {{was used as a}} quality control standard in the assays. Dissolved organic matter in high-discharge samples was more light-absorbing at 280 and 340 nm and adsorbed more strongly to alumina, than DOM characteristic of low streamflow, but was less fluorescent and hydrophilic, and poorer in proton-dissociating groups. No significant differences were found in light absorption at 254 nm, copper- or benzo(a) pyrene binding, or photochemical fading. Combination of the Rough Sike data with previously-published results for other streams and a lake yields totals of 20 - 23 values per assay, for a range of DOM types. Analysis of these data shows that DOM hydrophilicity and adsorption are well-predicted by linear relationships with the extinction coefficient at 340 nm (<b>E</b> <b>340),</b> while good quadratic relationships exist between <b>E</b> <b>340</b> and both buffering capacity and fluorescence.

40|$|Comparative {{molecular}} dynamics simulations of the 5 -HT 1 A receptor in its empty {{as well as}} agonist(i. e. active) and antagonist-bound (i. e. nonactive) forms have been carried out. The agonists 5 -HT and (R) - 8 -OH-DPAT {{as well as the}} antagonist WAY 100635 have been employed. The results of this study strengthen the hypothesis that the receptor portions close to the E/DRY/W motif, with prominence to the cytosolic extensions of helices 3 and 6, are particularly susceptible to undergo structural modification in response to agonist binding. Despite the differences in the structural/dynamics behavior of the two agonists when docked into the 5 -HT 1 A receptor, they both exert a destabilization of the intrahelical and interhelical interactions found in the empty and antagonist-bound receptor forms between the arginine of the E/DRY sequence and both D 133 (3. 49) and <b>E</b> <b>340</b> (6. 30). For both agonists, the chemical information transfer from the extracellular to the cytosolic domains is mediated by a cluster of aromatic amino acids in helix 61 following the ligand interaction with selected amino acids in the extracellular half of the receptor, such as D 116 (3. 32), S 199 (5. 42), Y 195 (5. 38), and F 361 (6. 51). A significant reduction in the bend at P 360 (6. 50), as compared to the empty and the antagonist-bound receptor forms, is one of the features of the agonist-bound forms that is related to the breakage of the interhelical salt bridge between the E/DRY arginine and <b>E</b> <b>340</b> (6. 30).

We now describe the structure and characteristics of a novel form of GlcCerase under investigation {{for the treatment of}} Gaucher disease, Gene-ActivatedTM human GlcCerase (velaglucerase alfa). In contrast to imiglucerase and prGCD, velaglucerase alfa contains the native human enzyme sequence. All three GlcCerases consist of three domains, with the active site located in domain III. The distances between the carboxylic oxygens of the catalytic residues, <b>E</b> <b>340</b> and E 235, are consistent with distances proposed for acid–base hydrolysis. Kinetic parameters (Km and Vmax) of velaglucerase alfa and imiglucerase, as well as their specific activities, are similar.

The predominant glycan on velaglucerase alfa is a high-mannose type, with nine mannose units, while imiglucerase contains a chitobiose tri-mannosyl core glycan with fucosylation. These differences in glycosylation affect cellular internalization; the rate of velaglucerase alfa internalization into human macrophages is at least 2 -fold greater than that of imiglucerase...|$|E

The red shift in the violet emission band of ceria i. e. from 368 nm to 396 nm with increasing excitation wavelength, {{has been attributed to}} the recombination of electrons trapped in the defect band and the deeply trapped holes in oxygen vacancies. This excitation wavelength dependence of ceria has noticeably been manifested in the PL response of FLC-CeO 2 nanocomposites as well.

Data with pentamerization-defective mutants suggested that none of these successive steps depended upon penton base pentamer status, indicating that the peptide domains responsible for these functions were carried by the monomer. Observations performed with wild-type (WT) and an integrin-binding-site double-mutant (K 288 <b>E</b> <b>340)</b> suggested that the penton base could enter the cell via an alternative, RGD- and LDV-independent, pathway.

No clear correlation exists between the ~ 200 GlcCerase mutations and disease severity, although homozygosity for the common mutations N 370 S and L 444 P is associated with nonneuronopathic and neuronopathic disease, respectively. We report the X-ray structure of GlcCerase at 2. 0 Å resolution. The catalytic domain consists of a (β/α) TIM barrel, as expected for a 8 member of the glucosidase hydrolase A clan.

In a previous comparison with two other highly soluble fusion partners, MBP was decidedly superior at promoting the solubility {{of a range of}} aggregation-prone proteins. To explain this observation, we proposed that MBP could function as a general molecular chaperone {{in the context of a}} fusion protein by binding to aggregation-prone folding intermediates of passenger proteins and preventing their self-association. The ligand-binding cleft in MBP was considered a likely site for peptide binding because of its hydrophobic nature. We tested this hypothesis by systematically replacing hydrophobic amino acid side chains in and around the cleft with glutamic acid. None of these mutations affected the yield or solubility of MBP in its unfused state. Each MBP was then tested for its ability to promote solubility when fused to three passenger proteins: green fluorescent protein, p 16, and E 6.

However, in contrast to the other known viral or cellular enhancers which are bidirectional, the Ad 2 enhancer is unidirectional, i. e. it potentiates the Ad 2 MLP element only when it is inserted in its "natural" orientation with respect to the direction of transcription. Using two convergent series of deletions, we have localized the Ad 2 enhancer element within a 24 bp segment located at approximately 160 bp from the Ad 2 left-end, i. <b>e.</b> <b>340</b> bp upstream from the E 1 A capsite. This 24 bp segment contains a sequence which exhibits a striking homology with the consensus sequence of several viral and cellular enhancers...|$|E
40|$|BACKGROUND: Some Anisakis simplex allergens, Ani s 4 among them, are {{reported}} to be resistant to freezing, heat and pepsin. However, the effect of conventional and microwave heating on live and frozen larvae, common conditions for fish preparation, and consecutive pepsin treatment have not been studied previously. In this study, live and frozen/thawed A. simplex larvae were subjected to conventional or microwave heating during time-temperature suffi{dotless}cient to kill live larvae, and digested with pepsin in the strong conditions used in fi{dotless}sh inspection. The antigenicity of A. simplex in the larvae extracts and in the incubation media fi{dotless}ltrates after all treatmentswas studied. RESULTS: The immunoblotting assay showed the presence of Ani s 4 in all the larvae extracts and all the incubation media filtrates. A. simplex crude antigenswere detected in all conditions; nevertheless, differenceswere observed among treatments, with lower values detected in the filtrates obtained after the strong acidic pepsin treatment. CONCLUSION: The results indicate that ingestion of A. simplex larvae can cause allergy in consumers already sensitised to this allergen, even if the parasitised fish is consumed well-cooked and after freezing in the recommended conditions selected for killing the larvae to avoid human anisakiasis. © 2009 Society of Chemical Industry.

This development should help reduce the region’s historical dependence on external financing. Although much progress has been made, vulnerabilities associated with refinancing risk remain and secondary markets still suffer from low liquidity. JEL classification: <b>E</b> 440, F <b>340,</b> G 150, G 180, H 630, O 160. Domestic bond markets have remained underdeveloped for much of Latin America’s modern history owing to a number of policy and structural impediments. These included a poor record of macroeconomic management; the absence of a deep and diversified investor base; regulatory restrictions that hampered the development of primary and secondary market activity; and the lack of an adequate infrastructure for the issuance of private sector debt securities. The resulting structure of domestic government and private sector debt, which was heavily biased towards short-term and/or dollar-indexe...|$|R
40|$|The apolipoprotein E (APOE) e 4 allele is {{the major}} genetic risk factor for Alzheimer’s disease, but an APOE effect on memory {{performance}} and memory-related neurophysiology in young, healthy subjects is unknown. We found an association of APOE e 4 with better episodic memory compared with APOE e 2 and <b>e</b> 3 in <b>340</b> young, healthy persons. Neuroimaging was performed in a subset of 34 memory-matched individuals to study genetic effects on memory-related brain activity independently of differential perfor-mance. E 4 carriers decreased brain activity over 3 learning runs, whereas e 2 and e 3 carriers increased activity. This smaller neural investment of e 4 carriers into learning reappeared during retrieval: e 4 carriers exhibited reduced retrieval-related activity with equal retrieval performance. APOE isoforms had no differential effects on cognitive measures other than memory, brain volumes, and brain activity related to working memory. We suggest that APOE e 4 is associated with good episodic memory and an economic use of memory-related neural resources in young, healthy humans...|$|R
40|$|Glucocerebrosidase (GBA) is a lysosomal) beta-glucosidase that degrades glucosylceramide. Its {{deficiency}} {{results in}} Gaucher disease (GD). We {{examined the effects}} of active site occupancy of GBA on its structural stability. For this, we made use of cyclophellitol-derived activity-based probes (ABPs) that bind irreversibly to the catalytic nucleophile (<b>E</b> <b>340),</b> and for comparison, we used the potent reversible inhibitor isofagomine. We demonstrate that cyclophellitol ABPs improve the stability of GBA in vitro, as revealed by thermodynamic measurements (T-m increase by 21 degrees C), and introduce resistance to tryptic digestion. The stabilizing effect of cell-permeable cyclophellitol ABPs is also observed in intact cultured cells containing wild-type GBA, N 370 S GBA (labile in lysosomes), and L 444 P GBA (exhibits impaired ER folding) all show marked increases in lysosomal forms of GBA molecules upon exposure to ABPs. The same stabilization effect is observed for endogenous GBA in the liver of wild-type mice injected with cyclophellitol ABPs. Stabilization effects similar to those observed with ABPs were also noted at high concentrations of the reversible inhibitor isofagomine. In conclusion, we provide evidence that the increase in cellular levels of GBA by ABPs and by the reversible inhibitor is in part caused by their ability to stabilize GBA folding, which increases the resistance of GBA against breakdown by lysosomal proteases. These effects are more pronounced {{in the case of the}} amphiphilic ABPs, presumably due to their high lipophilic potential, which may promote further structural compactness of GBA through hydrophobic interactions. Our study provides further rationale for the design of chaperones for GBA to ameliorate Gaucher diseas...|$|E
40|$|Background: High {{pressure}} (HP) {{ranging from}} 100 to 350 MPa (1 - 15 min) {{was applied to}} Anisakis simplex larvae and parasitised hake (Merluccius merluccius) muscle. The aim {{of the study was}} to kill the larvae to prevent human anisakidosis, to evaluate the effect on A. simplex allergens and to minimally alter fish muscle quality. Results: The larvae were killed at pressures ≥ 200 MPa and times ≥ 1 min, producing alterations in the larva body and ruptures in the cuticle when observed by scanning electron microscopy. Nevertheless, Ani s 4 and A. simplex crude antigens were recognised by immunoblotting and immunohistochemistry at all HPs assayed. Small changes in colour and texture were observed in fish muscle under all pressure/time conditions. Major changes were observed visually at 300 MPa, where the muscle appeared as slightly cooked. Apparent viscosity of muscle homogenates decreased significantly at longer times or higher applied pressure. No changes were detected at 200 MPa in the electrophoretic pattern of proteins treated with or without β-mercaptoethanol, suggesting that disulfide bonds were not formed. Conclusion: Application of HP at 200 MPa for up to 5 min would kill A. simplex larvae, avoiding infestation of the consumer and causing small changes in the hake muscle perceived sensorially. However, HP-treated A. simplex-parasitised fish would still be a potential hazard for consumers allergic to the larvae. © 2009 Society of Chemical Industry.

40|$|Deficiency of {{glucocerebrosidase}} (GBA) causes Gaucher disease (GD). In {{the common}} non-neuronopathic GD type I variant, glucosylceramide accumulates {{primarily in the}} lysosomes of visceral macrophages. Supplementing storage cells with lacking enzyme is accomplished via chronic intravenous administration of recombinant GBA containing mannose-terminated N-linked glycans, mediating the selective uptake by macrophages expressing mannose-binding lectin(s). Two recombinant GBA preparations with distinct N-linked glycans are registered in Europe for treatment of type I GD: imiglucerase (Genzyme), contains predominantly Man(3) glycans, and velaglucerase (Shire PLC) Man(9) glycans. Activity-based probes (ABPs) enable fluorescent labeling of recombinant GBA preparations through their covalent attachment to the catalytic nucleophile <b>E</b> <b>340</b> of GBA. We comparatively studied binding and uptake of ABP-labeled imiglucerase and velaglucerase in isolated dendritic cells, cultured human macrophages and living mice, through simultaneous detection of different GBAs by paired measurements. Uptake of ABP-labeled rGBAs by dendritic cells was comparable, {{as well as the}} bio-distribution following equimolar intravenous administration to mice. ABP-labeled rGBAs were recovered largely in liver, white-blood cells, bone marrow and spleen. Lungs, brain and skin, affected tissues in severe GD types II and III, were only poorly supplemented. Small, but significant differences were noted in binding and uptake of rGBAs in cultured human macrophages, in the absence and presence of mannan. Mannan-competed binding and uptake were largest for velaglucerase, when determined with single enzymes or as equimolar mixtures of both enzymes. Vice versa, imiglucerase showed more prominent binding and uptake not competed by mannan. Uptake of recombinant GBAs by cultured macrophages seems to involve multiple receptors, including several mannose-binding lectins. Differences among cells from different donors (n = 12) were noted, but the same trends were always observed. Our study suggests that further insight in targeting and efficacy of enzyme therapy of individual Gaucher patients could be obtained by the use of recombinant GBA, trace-labeled with an ABP, preferably equipped with an infrared fluorophore or other reporter tag suitable for in vivo imagin...|$|E

40|$|Hepatitis C virus (HCV) {{infection}} {{is a major}} worldwide problem. Chronic hepatitis C is {{recognized as one of}} the major causes of cirrhosis, hepatocellular carcinoma, and liver failure. Although new, directly acting antiviral therapies are suggested to overcome the low efficacy and adverse effects observed for the current standard of treatment, an effective vaccine would be the only way to certainly eradicate HCV infection. Recently, polyhydroxybutyrate beads produced by engineered Escherichia coli showed efficacy as a vaccine delivery system. Here, an endotoxin-free E. coli strain (ClearColi) was engineered to produce polyhydroxybutyrate beads displaying the core antigen on their surface (Beads-Core) and their immunogenicity was evaluated in BALB/c mice. Immunization with Beads-Core induced gamma interferon (IFN-γ) secretion and a functional T cell immune response against the HCV Core protein. With the aim to target broad T and B cell determinants described for HCV, Beads-Core mixed with HCV E 1, E 2, and NS 3 recombinant proteins was also evaluated in BALB/c mice. Remarkably, only three immunization with Beads-Core+CoE 1 E 2 NS 3 /Alum (a mixture of 0. 1 μg Co. 120, 16. 7 μg <b>E</b> 1. <b>340,</b> 16. 7 μg E 2. 680, and 10 μg NS 3 adjuvanted in aluminum hydroxide [Alum]) induced a potent antibody response against E 1 and E 2 and a broad IFN-γ secretion and T cell response against Core and all coadministered antigens. This immunological response mediated protective immunity to viremia as assessed in a viral surrogate challenge model. Overall, it was shown that engineered biopolyester beads displaying foreign antigens are immunogenic and might present a particulate delivery system suitable for vaccination against HCV.

40|$|An {{existing}} finite-element solver for steady, non-linear {{subsonic flow}} is extended {{in order to}} treat unsteady potential flow problems in the Laplace domain. The numerical formulation makes use of unstructured meshes including explicitly modelled, triangulated wake surfaces. Meshes can contain both linear and quadratic volume and surface elements, thus allowing to favor either very fast solution times or high spatial resolution. Aeroelastic problems are dealt with by modelling moving or deforming bodies by means of transpiration boundary conditions. Deformations of the aerodynamic mesh are computed either by projection of aerodynamic mesh nodes onto the finite elements of a structural shell model, or by radial basis function interpolation suitable for beam-type structural models.
