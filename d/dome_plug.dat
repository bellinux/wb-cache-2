40|$|This paper aims {{to provide}} a broad review and {{assessment}} of the feedstocks and applicable biogas technologies that are feasible in Sub-Saharan Africa (SSA). Biodigesters and feedstocks available in SSA were identified according to scale and application – household, community, institutional, and commercial. Aside from livestock manure, suitable feedstocks for household, community, and institutional biodigesters include crop residues, night soil/domestic sewage, and the organic fraction of municipal solid waste (OFMSW). Significant untapped feedstocks exist from SSA agro-processing and food production industries. Biodigesters available in SSA for household, community, and institutional installations include variations of fixed <b>dome,</b> <b>plug</b> flow, and floating cover digesters. Commercial digester designs applicable to the region include continuously stirred tank reactors and fixed film digesters. The key factors {{that need to be}} considered in selecting suitable biodigester designs for specific applications include: feedstock availability, water supply, energy demand, local materials and labour, and the level of commitment to operate and maintain the biodigester effectively...|$|E

The top of the salt mass is about 500 ft below the surface and above it are limestone, gypsum, and anhydrite. Petroleum was trapped around the salt dome in sandstone and limestone layers. Five million barrels of crude oil were extracted from 85 wells in the years up to 1924. In the year 1930 alone the mound yielded 224,000 barrels of oil.|$|R
5000|$|Mount Canobolas is an extinct {{volcanic}} complex which {{erupted in}} several phases between 13 and 11 million years ago, making the mountain {{a relatively recent}} geological feature. Earlier eruptions were less violent with free flowing lavas reaching a maximum coverage extent of approximately. Later eruptions became more violent, and producing increasingly viscous lavas with less extensive coverage. The contemporary landscape of Mount Canobolas exhibits erosional features dominated by several remnant peaks. Additional volcanic features are present within the zone of volcanic influence, including vents, dykes, peaks, <b>domes</b> and <b>plugs.</b>|$|R
5000|$|After {{reaching}} its maximum extent the Cheekye Glacier along {{with part of}} the area's ice sheet were covered with volcanic ash and fragmented debris from Garibaldi. This period of growth began with the eruption of the Atwell Peak <b>plug</b> <b>dome</b> from a ridge surrounded by the several thousand foot ice sheet. As the <b>plug</b> <b>dome</b> rose, massive sheets of broken lava crumbled as talus down its sides. Numerous Peléan pyroclastic flows (consisting of a super-heated mix of gas, ash, and pumice) accompanied these cooler avalanches, forming a fragmental cone [...] in volume and an overall slope of 12 to 15 degrees. (Erosion has since steepened this slope.) Some of the glacial ice was melted by the eruptions, forming a small lake against Brohm Ridge's southern arm. The volcanic sandstones seen today atop Brohm Ridge were created by ash settling in this lake.|$|R

50|$|Mount Malindang is {{a complex}} volcano located in the {{province}} of Misamis Occidental in the southern island of Mindanao, Philippines. It is the highest point in the province. The least studied mountain range was formed through several volcanic activities some of which could be historical, evident by the presence of two calderas, surrounded by high rock walls, cinder cones, <b>dome</b> volcano <b>plugs,</b> two sulfurous hot springs, and a crater lake named Lake Duminagat. The amphitheater structures have extensive distribution of volcanic rocks, carbonized wood that are found in pyroclastic deposits. The entire mountain range is dissected by several canyons and ravines making its terrain very rugged and the forested slopes covered with beautiful scenery.|$|R
25|$|The {{source of}} heat for {{volcanism}} in the Lassen area is subduction off the Northern California coast of the Gorda Plate diving below the North American Plate. The area surrounding Lassen Peak is still active with boiling mud pots, stinking fumaroles, and churning hot springs.

50|$|The volcano {{has been}} {{constructed}} in three main phases. First, {{a set of}} rhyolite lava <b>domes</b> and <b>plugs</b> was erupted and formed a platform beneath the edifice without evidence of explosive activity or caldera formation. This unit appears on the northern and western flanks of the volcano between 3500 - 4000 m and form about {{one third of the}} total volume, with the domes ranging 0.3 - 1 km in width and 250 m in height. They are heavily hydrothermally altered and deformed. A gap during which tectonic and climatic degradation of the earlier domes occurred separates this stage from the next. Subsequently, destruction of domes during eruptions generated a unit consisting of coarse dacite in pumice and breccia form spreading out from the centre. On top of this unit, an andesitic cone formed, dated at 9 mya. Some aphyric phenobasalts cover surfaces of the second unit.|$|R

5000|$|Soon {{before or}} after the buried ice had melted away, dacite lava quietly erupted from Opal Cone {{southeast}} of the Atwell Peak <b>plug</b> <b>dome</b> 10,700 to 9,300 years ago and flowed 20 km down Ring Creek on Garibaldi's southern and southwestern flanks without encountering any residual glacial ice.

This lava forms a thin layer of solid rock on the southern and western sides of the volcano and contains well-defined lava flow margin levees.

40|$|A new {{geological}} mapping of Raivavae island, Austral-Cook linear chain, French Polynesia, combined with 10 unspiked K/Ar ages measured on its lavas, {{shows that it}} was built during two successive volcanic phases : 10. 6 - 7. 4 Ma (dykes crosscutting Rairua submarine breccias and younger subaerial Rairua flows) and 6. 4 - 5. 4 Ma (Anatonu shield volcano and associated trachytic and phonolitic <b>domes</b> and <b>plugs).</b> Geochemical data {{from the present study}} and a previous one [Lassiter et al., 2003] demonstrate that the Rairua alkali basalts, picrobasalts and basanites are more enriched in incompatible elements (especially Th and Nb) than the predominantly tholeiitic Anatonu basalts. The isotopic signature of Rairua lavas displays a strong HIMU flavour, while that of Anatonu lavas is more subdued and intermediate between DMM, HIMU and EM end-members. Rairua mafic lavas show obvious petrologic and geochemical similarities with those of the neighbouring island of Tubuai. Both could result from the partial melting of a predominantly HIMU secondary plume, which formed sucessively Mangaia (19. 4 - 18. 4 Ma), the old lavas of Rurutu (12. 7 - 12. 1 Ma), Tubuai (10. 0 - 8. 8 Ma) and Rairua volcano. The geochemical signature of the younger Anatonu lavas is ascribed to the partial melting, within the same plume, of a distinct filament of more subdued composition. Alternatively, the proportion of pyroxenites with a HIMU character was lower as partial melting degrees increased, generating the Anatonu tholeiites...|$|R
40|$|Magma is transported through Earth 2 ̆ 7 s solid crust by two {{different}} processes, diking and diapirism, although other mechanisms, such as porous and channeled flow, can transport melt through partially molten crustal areas. Dikes are ubiquitous {{indicators of the}} transport of magma in the shallow crust by brittle fracture, and there is ample geological and geophysical evidence supporting diking as a magma-ascent mechanism through the crust. On the other hand, igneous diapirism, involving magma ascent by gravitational instability and requiring viscous or plastic flow of country rock (“hot Stokes” diapirs), is often invoked as a magma-transport mechanism restricted to the ductile upper mantle or lower crust. However, unequivocal geological field evidence for igneous diapirism has proven elusive {{and has been a}} matter of considerable debate. We report geological and geophysical evidence showing that Pliocene sills emplaced in the upper levels of brittle continental crust of the Colorado Plateau in the San Rafael subvolcanic field (Utah) became gravitationally unstable by mechanically altering the overlying sedimentary rocks. These sills grew into structures that we recognize as <b>domes</b> and <b>plugs</b> at the current level of exposure. Some of these plugs continued to transport magma to shallower levels of the continental crust and eventually acted as conduits feeding volcanic eruptions. Our geological and geophysical findings indicate that gravitational instability is a viable mechanism for the initiation of magma ascent in the upper continental crust for small volumes of basaltic magma under specific conditions...|$|R

Petrography [...] 3. Mineralogy [...] 4. Major and Trace Element Chemical Data [...] 5. Experimental Study on a Near-Saturated Hawaiite [...] 6. Petrogenesis and Conclusions. Mineralogical and geochemical data indicate that the Igneous rocks in the Lome Basin - Ccmboyne Plateau area on the midnorth coast of New South Wales consist primarily of alkaline and calc-alkaline types, with minor occurrences of tholeiitic andesite. Alkaline rocks are centred on the Comboyne Plateau, and include hawaiite, mugearite, benmoreite, mafic trachyte, anorthoclase trachyte and comendite. The rocks form <b>domes,</b> <b>plugs</b> and flows {{and there is a}} dominance of intermediate and silicic types. There are also rare occurrences of tholeiitic andesite on the Comboyne Plateau. The calc-alkaline rocks are predominantly high level intrusive granodiorites and granites and extrusive rhyolites. More basic types include basaltic andesite and diorite. Data presented in this study indicate that the Comboyne alkaline rocks represent a mildly alkaline-transitional association in which strong fractionation has resulted in the formation of peralkaline rhyolites. Geochemically the Comboyne association has tholeiitic affinities with normative hypersthene occurring in all rock types. Mineralogically they are alkaline, although analyses and normative components for clinopyroxenes in the more basic rocks confirm the mildly alkaline-transitional character of the host rocks. Textural and chemical criteria suggest that megacrysts and/or cumulates of orthopyroxene, olivine, clinopyroxene, plagioclase, ilmenite, titenomagnetite and apatite in the hawaiites, and less commonly, in the mugearites, crystallised at elevated pressures. Similarly, crystal aggregates of anorthoclase, olivine, edenitic amphibole, Fe-Ti oxides and apatite in the benmoreites indicate that these also formed at depth and that fractionation in nearsurface magma chambers was not significant, at least in obtaining compositions as evolved as benmoreite. lOOMg/Mg + Fe²⁺ valuss of less than 50 in the hawaiites indicate that these rocks do not represent primitive mantle melts, and that fractionation of magnesium-rich phases occurred prior to the crystallisation of the present megacryst/cumulate assemblage. The derivation of the hawaiites at elevated pressures is supported by experimental work undertaken in this study. Ths near-duplication of the natural megacryst/cumulate assemblage in runs at 6. 5 kb with 2 % H₂O indicates that the hawaiite megacryst/ cumulate assemblages precipitated at a depth of 20 - 24 km before rapid ascent to higher crustal levels. It is suggested that megacrysts of orthopyroxene and olivine, and gabbroic aggregates of plagioclase, clinopyroxene, olivine and ilmenite, in the Comboyne tholeiitic andesite precipitated at pressures up to 6 kb. This is supported by mineralogical and experimental data on similar compositions from other basaltic associations. Both major and trace element data indicate that the Lorne Basin granodiorites, granites and rhyolites are not genetically related to the more basic diorites and basaltic andesite. Partial melting of andesitic material in the crust best explains the origin of the silicic rucks, but the relatively high MgO, FeO and CaO in the diorites and basaltic andesite points to their origin from the mantle by a two-stage melting process.

40|$|Volcanism in Central Italy {{started from}} late Pliocene in extensional regime {{related to the}} opening of the Tyrrhenian back arc basin, {{involving}} the emplacement of acid dome complexes both in subaqueous (Northern Pontine Archipelago) and subaerial environments (Tolfa, Ceriti, Manziate, and Cimini dome complexes), and than allowing, during late Pleistocene, the emplacement of several alkali-potassic volcanic districts.

The local swelling produced radial and tangential fracture systems along which several domes emplaced with morphological characteristics related to their different location respect to the central area.

The ice was thickest in and thus cone distortion was greatest over the buried Cheekye valley. Later volcanism occurred from Dalton Dome, which forms Garibaldi's western summit. Lava flows mantled the landslide headwall on Garibaldi's western flank. Around the same time, a voluminous dacite lava flow from Opal Cone travelled [...] down Ring Creek on Garibaldi's southeastern flank without encountering any residual glacial ice. These latest eruptions of Mount Garibaldi occurred in the early Holocene shortly after remains of the Cordilleran Ice Sheet retreated in regional valleys between 10,700 and 9,300 years ago.|$|R

Bouguer anomalies of established impact structures (Chicxulub [170. km; 64. 98. ±. 0. 05. Ma], Woodleigh impact structure and Gnargoo probable impact structure display a unique structural architecture where pre-impact structural ridges are intersected and truncated by the outer {{ring of the}} circular structure. Seismic reflection data outline circular central uplift <b>domes,</b> basement <b>plugs</b> and rim synclines. Sharp circular seismic tomography anomalies indicate low velocity columns under both the Woodleigh impact structure and Warburton probable impact, hinting at deep crustal fracturing. Deformed, curved and clouded intra-crystalline planar deformation features in quartz (Qz/PDFs), displaying Miller indices ({ 10 - 11 }, { 10 - 12 }, { 10 - 13 }) diagnostic of shock metamorphism, abound around exposed established impact structures (Vredefort [298. km; 2023. ±. 4.

Deformed Qz/PDFs allow recognition of shock metamorphism in buried impact structures, where original Qz/PDFs were bent, recrystallized and/or clouded during formation of the central uplift and hydrothermal activity triggered by the impact. Planar deformation in quartz can also occur in explosive pyroclastic units but are limited to Boehm lamella (Brazil twins) with single lamella sets { 0001 }. It {{has been suggested that}} a class of microstructures in quartz, referred to as metamorphic deformation lamella (Qz/MDL), occur in endogenic tectonic-metamorphic terrains. However, no type locality has been established for Qz/MDL of non-impact origin...|$|R
5000|$|The most {{significant}} volcanic event in historical times was the simultaneous eruption of Mount Katmai and Novarupta in June 1912. Novarupta's eruption produced a pyroclastic flow that covered a nearby valley with ash {{as much as}} 300 ft thick. At {{the same time the}} summit of Katmai collapsed into a caldera. As the valley deposits cooled, they emitted steam from fissures and fumaroles, earning the name [...] "Valley of Ten Thousand Smokes." [...] As heat has dissipated from the deposits the steam vents have subsided and the valley has been eroded. At present streams have cut canyons as much as 100 ft deep, but only 5 to 10 ft wide. Katmai is a stratovolcano, 6716 ft in height, with a large summit caldera. Several glaciers originate from the mountain, and one in the caldera is the only glacier known to have formed in historical times. The caldera floor is about 250 m below the rim. The mountain stands on Jurassic sedimentary rocks, and its volcanic components are less than 1500 ft thick. Apart from the 1912 eruption, no significant activity has occurred in historical times. Novarupta is described as a Plinian pyroclastic vent with a <b>plug</b> <b>dome,</b> a 2000 m diameter crater with a 65 m, 400 m diameter dome in the middle. Its only historical activity was the 1912 eruption.|$|R
40|$|Realistic {{probabilistic}} hazard forecasts for re-awakening volcanoes rely {{on making}} an accurate estimation {{of their past}} eruption frequency and magnitude for a period long enough to view systematic changes or evolution. Adding an in-depth knowledge of the local underlying magmatic or tectonic driving processes allows development of even more robust eruption forecasting models. Holocene tephra records preserved within lacustrine sediments and soils on and surrounding the andesitic stratovolcano of Mt. Taranaki (Egmont Volcano), New Zealand, were used to 1) compile an eruption catalogue that minimises bias to carry out frequency analysis, and 2) identify magmatic processes responsible for variations in activity of this intermittently awakening volcano. A new, highly detailed eruption history for Mt. Taranaki was compiled from sediment sequences containing Holocene tephra layers preserved beneath Lakes Umutekai and Rotokare, NE and SE of the volcano’s summit, respectively, with age control provided by radiocarbon dating. To combine the two partly concurrent tephra records both geochemistry (on titanomagnetite) and statistical measures of event concurrence were applied. Similarly, correlation was made to proximal pyroclastic sequences in all sectors around the 2518 m-high edifice. This record {{was used to examine}} geochemical variations (through titanomagnetite and bulk chemistry) at Mt. Taranaki in unprecedented sampling detail. To develop an unbiased sampling of eruption event frequency, a technique was developed to distinguish explosive, pumice-forming eruptions from dome-forming events recorded in medial ash as fine-grade ash layers. Recognising that exsolution lamellae in titanomagnetite result from oxidation processes within lava <b>domes</b> or <b>plugs,</b> their presence within ash deposits was used to distinguish falls elutriated from blockand- ash flows. These deposits are focused in particular catchments and are hence difficult to sample comprehensively. Excluding these events from temporal eruption records, the remaining, widespread pumice layers of sub-plinian eruptions at a single site of Lake Umutekai presented the lowest-bias sampling of the overall event frequency. The annual eruption frequency of Mt. Taranaki was found to be strongly cyclic with a 1500 - 2000 year periodicity. Titanomagnetite, glass and whole-rock chemistry of eruptives from Mt. Taranaki’s Holocene history all display distinctive compositional cycles that correspond precisely with the event frequency curve for this volcano. Furthermore, the largest known eruptions from the volcano involve the most strongly evolved magmas of their cycle and occur during the eruptive-frequency minimum, preceding the longest repose intervals known. Petrological evidence reveals a two-stage system of magma differentiation and assembly operating at Mt. Taranaki. Each of the identified 1500 - 2000 year cycles represent isolated magma batches that evolved at depth {{at the base of the}} crust before periodically feeding a mid-upper crustal magma storage system...|$|R

40|$|Miocene {{volcanic}} activity constructed the Lyttelton composite cone 11 - 10 Ma ago. The Lyttelton volcano which forms the north western half of Banks Peninsula represents a significant volume of mafic volcanic rocks together {{with some of}} felsic and minor intermediate composition. In addition to these, the volcano is characterized by pyroclastic deposits (lahars and lithic-crystal tuffs). Lyttelton lavas are intruded by numerous radial dikes and also {{by a variety of}} lava <b>domes,</b> sills and <b>plugs.</b> The volcanism was mainly Hawaiian in style, with some Vulcanian and occasional Strombolian styles of activity. Within this composite volcano, two major phase of {{volcanic activity}} are recognized. These are the main phase (the older) and late phase (younger) Lyttelton volcanics defined on the basis of field relationships, petrography and geochemistry. The late phase volcanics are designated formally as the Mt Pleasant Formation. The main and late phase Lyttelton volcanics range from mafic to felsic rocks compositions. The dikes range from basalt to trachyte and intruded the volcano during the main and late phase of volcanic activity. Sills and intrusions have felsic compositions. The major valleys and the lahar deposits represent periods of degradation of the active cone. Both the main and late phase (Mt Pleasant Formation) Lyttelton volcanics are alkaline tending transitional in geochemical affinity. The alkaline, sodic series Lyttelton rocks are members of the alkali olivine basalt association and this designation is consistent with mineralogy. Some intermediate and felsic Lyttelton rocks are subalkaline and potassic in composition, but they are classified as alkaline olivine basalt associations {{on the basis of their}} mineralogy. There are geochemical distinctions in major oxides, trace -elements and normative mineralogy between the main and late (Mt Pleasant Formation) Lyttelton rocks. The petrogenesis of the main and late Lyttelton volcanics mafic lavas is best explained by low pressure crystal fractionation of the observed phenocryst phases. The intermediate and felsic rocks are derived by similar processes with minor crustal contamination. Tectonically, Lyttelton volcanics represent “within plate” alkaline mafic volcanism...|$|R
40|$|Approximately 180 diapirs {{define a}} 500 km belt {{coincident}} with the Flinders-Mount Lofty Ranges. New observations on these structures are prefaced by {{reviews of the}} concept of diapirism in general and of the history and regional geological setting of the province - the Adelaide 'Geosyncline'. The proposed model for diapirism in the 'Geosyncline' is based on a detailed map of the Arkaba Diapir. Primary control of diapir distribution in the trough can be related to fracture patterns in the pre-source-bed rocks. Outcrop of diapiric material is distinctive over a wide area, and may be accentuated by patterns of vegetation. Weathering is deep and intense but cap-rock or solution megabreccias arc absent. Typical forms are very complex, varying from massifs, <b>domes,</b> dykes, and <b>plugs,</b> shapes that have been controlled by host-rock anisotropy, notably patterns of fracture. Diapir/host-rock contacts are invariably abrupt and coincide with planes of weakness in the host. The contacts, despite sculpting and quarrying by invading diapiric material, can often be matched in 'continental drift' type reconstructions across the cores. Host strata are rarely brecciated or upturned against a diapir, Illustrating the passive nature of the intrusions. Where such deformation occurs, it usually pre-dates diapirism and is due to faulting. Permitted intrusion under local extension in the cover, plausibly induced by regional compression, is implied, Alteration of host-rock adjacent to contacts is absent but for minor dolomitization in certain zones. The intrusive material is an intensely mixed chaotic breccia but one which includes many well rounded and subsphericalxenoclasts, from kilometres across to the finest dust. The size spectrum appears to obey Rosin's Law of Crushing. The breccias, but for rare basement and host-rock xenoclasts, involve a restricted and characteristic range of shallow-marine lithologies including terrigenous clastics, carbonates (especially dolostones), and saline evaporites. This suite may well be assigned to the Callanna Beds of Late Precambrian age. Petrographic studies have revealed a suite of metamorphic minerals, notably carbonate, chlorite, clay, felspar, haematite, magnesioriebeckite, quartz, stilpnomelane, and talc, developed in the core rocks. All mineral components may reasonably have been derived by simple processes entirely from rocks of the type that comprise typical xenoclasts. Many reactions involved dedolomitization and/or saline evaporates. A low pressure, hypersaline, aqueous, oxidative metamorphic environment (zeolite facies) is indicated; replete with C 0 ₂, open-system, and low temperature (150 °C- 250 °C- 300 °C). Affinities are with natural hydrothermal and geothermal systems. Igneous rocks {{with a wide range of}} ages occur in the cores and include both intrusive and extrusive types, mainly basic to intermediate in character. They are essentially xenoclastic but include some in situ post-diapiric intrusions. The occurrence of igneous rock is fortuitous and non-essential to diapirism. Typical breccias have a banded fabric and other features such as the shaping, disruption, mixing, and alignment of xenoclasts that must be attributed to flow. Movement was slow, rather passive, and plug-like, described by non-Newtonian, Andradean law. Mobility of the source material, rather than factors such as density, was paramount to diapirism. The mobility is explained by the former presence of saline evaporites in the interstices of the breccias and by appeal to the concepts of dilatancy, fluidization, and rheidity. The overburden was relatively brittle, its weight the prime driving force to the intrusions. Emplacement was at least partly syn-tectonic, linked to pulses of deformation of the cover, as well as to basement evolution in the 'Geosyncline'. Decollement at the source layer is implied. The host was not explosively breached in the manner of a diatreme; the diapirs are not carbonatites. Although further problems have been outlined, a study of diapirs in the Flinders-Mount Lofty Ranges has clarified many aspects of the global theory. The essence of the new observations is embodied in a proposed classification of intrusions that includes diapirs. Thesis (Ph. D.) [...] University of Adelaide, Department of Geology, 197...|$|R
