For instantaneous imaging, strategies are required that must cope with time-gated information and that rely on assumptions on the local boundary conditions. A model-based analysis is performed to identify the dependence of LII particle-size imaging on the assumed boundary conditions such as bath gas temperature, pressure, particle heat-up temperature, accommodation coefficients, and soot morphology. Various laser-fluence regimes and gas pressures are considered. For 60 bar, fluences that lead to particle heat-up temperatures of 3400 – 3900 K provided the lowest sensitivity on particle-sizing. Effects of laser attenuation are evaluated. A combination of one <b>detection</b> <b>gate</b> starting at the signal peak and the other starting with 5 ns delay was found to provide the highest sensitivity at 60 bar.

40|$|Two-photon laser-induced {{fluorescence}} for {{detection of}} carbon monoxide (CO) frequently shows interferences by emission from photolytically produced C- 2 radicals encountered under fuel-rich combustion conditions. Reduced C- 2 interference for excitation with laser pulses in the picosecond regime is here demonstrated by comparison with excitation using nanosecond pulses for measurements in laminar premixed ethene-air flames. Compared with nanosecond pulses of 8 ns duration and 4 mJ pulse energy, picosecond pulses of 80 ps duration and around 0. 5 mJ pulse energy gave similar to 10 times higher peak power, which allowed for efficient CO excitation and resulted in stronger signal with lower C- 2 interference. CO fluorescence with picosecond excitation showed a linear to quadratic power dependence, indicating photoionization, whereas a more quadratic dependence was found for the C- 2 interference. A sub-nanosecond effective lifetime of CO resulted in a rapid fluorescence decay compared with C- 2 and allowed for efficient reduction in C- 2 interference by minimizing the <b>detection</b> <b>gate.</b> In addition, interference compensation using time-resolved detection could be demonstrated. Altogether, picosecond pulses provide efficient two-photon excitation of CO in terms of signal strength as well as reduced C- 2 interference. (C) 2012 The Combustion Institute.

40|$|Laser-induced {{incandescence}} (LII) is {{a well-established}} technique for tracking soot, potentially enabling soot volume fraction determination. To obtain crank angle resolved {{data from a}} single cycle, a multi-kHz system should be applied. Such an approach, however, imposes certain challenges in terms of application and interpretation. The present work intends to apply such a high-speed system to an optically-accessible, compression ignition engine. Possible problems with sublimation, local gas heating or other multishot effects have been studied on an atmospheric co-flow burner prior to the engine experiments. It was found that, in this flame, fluences around 0. 1 J/cm 2 provide the best balance between signal-tobackground ratio, and soot sublimation. This fluence is well below the plateau regime of LII, which poses additional problems with interpretation of the signal. This is especially true when a wide span of temperatures and gradients is present, as encountered in diesel combustion. The {{purpose of this study}} is to provide an initial investigation into the feasibility of high-speed LII in engine applications. Particular attention will be given to the late combustion phase, i. e. after the end-of-injection, where phase-averaged data might not provide sufficient information. The pitfalls related to engine data interpretation are briefly discussed and some qualitative results are shown, which have been verified with high-speed luminosity measurements. To apply high-speed LII in an engine one should take utmost care with the selection of detection equipment (e. g. filters and <b>detection</b> <b>gate)</b> and settings to suppress the strong background radiation. All in all, the technique is found to be feasible, but the balance between fluence, signal strength, and effects on soot morphology was shown to be extremely delicate, and proper detection equipment is a requirement...|$|E
40|$|Cotutelle de thèse This work {{focuses on}} {{measurements}} of soot particle size and volume fraction at Diesel engine conditions. A combination of laser-induced incandescence (LII) imaging, line-of-sight laser extinction, soot pyrometry, and {{transmission electron microscopy}} (TEM) measurements of thermophoretically-sampled soot was used. Particle sizing strategies were developed with LII model {{for the analysis of}} particlesize poly-dispersity with time-resolved LII signal that is suitable for point-wise measurements at atmospheric pressure, and for spatially-resolved characterization with two-time-step LII imaging. Measurements were performed with these strategies in a flame at atmospheric pressure and in Diesel engine combustion to investigate their applicability. Additional measurements were performed for temperature and soot volume fraction. A novel method, called two-exponential reverse fitting (TERF), is introduced to extract information about the size distribution. The method is based on mono-exponential fits to the LII signal decay at a delayed time. It approximates the particle-size distribution as a combination of one large and one small mono-disperse equivalent mean particle size and does not require a distribution assumption. It also provides a ratio of the contribution of both size classes. The systematic error caused by describing LII signals by mono-exponential decays was calculated as less than 2 % for LII signals simulated for mono-disperse aggregated soot with heat-up temperatures for which evaporation is negligible. The method was applied to LII data acquired in a laminar non-premixed ethylene/air flame at various heights above the burner. The particle size of the large particle-size class evaluated with the method showed good consistency with TEM results, however the size of the small particle-size class and its relative contribution could not be compared due to insufficient information in the TEM results for small particles. Simultaneous line-of-sight laser extinction measurements and LII imaging were performed to derive the soot volume fraction in a high-temperature high-pressure constant-volume pre-combustion vessel under the Engine Combustion Network’s (ECN) "Spray A" conditions with parametric variations of gas temperature and composition. Extinction measurements were used to calibrate LII images for quantitative soot distribution measurements. OH-chemiluminescence imaging was used to determine the lift-off length, and used to interpret the soot measurements. Maximum soot volume fractions around 2 – 3 ppm were obtained at the nominal ambient temperature defined for Spray A (i. e. 900 K) that rise to 12 ppm at elevated temperature (1030 K). Variations of ambient temperature and oxygen concentration were carried out showing effects on soot formation and oxidation that are consistent with the literature. The method for particle-size imaging is based on evaluating gated LII signals acquired with two cameras consecutively after the laser pulse and using LII modeling to deduce particle size from the ratio of local signals. A strategy was developed with a model-based analysis: the dependence of LII particlesize imaging on the assumed boundary conditions was identified such as bathgas temperature, pressure, particle heat-up temperature, thermal accommodation coefficients, and soot morphology. Various laser-fluence regimes and gas pressures were considered. Effects of laser attenuation were evaluated. A combination of one <b>detection</b> <b>gate</b> starting with the particle-heating and the other starting with 11 ns delay with twice as long gate width was found to provide the highest sensitivity for particle sizing at 60 bar. The optimum gate delays for different pressures were calculated. The effects of timing jitter for laser pulse and poly-dispersity were investigated. Systematic errors in pyrometry imaging at 60 bar was evaluated. Parallel to the model-based analysis, experiments were conducted in near Spray A conditions with parametric variations of injection pressure, gas temperature and composition. The results were compared to particle-size measurements from TEM of soot sampled at multiple axial distances from the injector. The discrepancies between the two measurement techniques are discussed to analyze uncertainties and related error sources of the two diagnostics methodologies. It is found that in such an environment where particles are small and pressure is high, LII signal decay times are such that LII suffers from a strong bias towards large particles...|$|E

Tissue-specific biomarkers have been studied to identify micrometastases in bone marrow and/or peripheral blood. Many studies, however, report conflicting results for detection sensitivity and specificity, forestalling translation into clinical use. Automated image cytometry has many potential advantages, and this dissertation explores the feasibility of identifying circulating tumor cells (CTCs) via high- throughput microscopy and automated cell-by-cell classification. We used a fully-automated microscope that is functionally equivalent to a Q 3 DM/Beckman Coulter EIDAQ /IC 100 image cytometer, including optics for high-content image acquisition of multiple fluorophores and robotics for stage movement and autofocus. Feature data (fluorometric as well as morphometric measurements) were collected from \textit}in vitro} spiked models of breast cancer in blood. Prestaining with CellTracker creates a gold standard for assessing cancer origin. Not all breast cancer cells stain for cytokeratins and EpCAM (two markers of epithelial origin). Genetic instability and heterogeneity of cancers makes finding an absolute set of differential expression markers difficult, if not impossible, to reliably identify all CTCs. We hypothesize that CTCs may be detected by morphology instead of biomarkers. In fact, pathologists often look for morphological changes and abnormalities when analyzing tissue biopsies to diagnose cancer. Clumped cells are a challenge for analysis. In flow cytometry, clumps are simply discarded.
