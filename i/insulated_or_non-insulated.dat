Tank cars can be pressurized or non-pressurized, <b>insulated</b> <b>or</b> <b>non-insulated,</b> and designed for single or multiple commodities. Non-pressurized cars have various fittings on the top and may have fittings on the bottom. Some of the top fittings are covered by a protective housing. Pressurized cars have a pressure plate, with all fittings, and a cylindrical protective housing at the top. Loading and unloading are done through the protective housing.|$|E
40|$|AbstractThe Belgian {{building}} stock is characterised by {{a vast amount}} of houses with non-insulated cavity walls, creating high potential for blown-in retrofit cavity wall insulation. Although retrofit insulation is becoming standard practice, there is a prevalent uncertainty about test procedures and evaluation standards. Moreover, hardly any information is available on the amount of water ingress through <b>insulated</b> <b>or</b> <b>non-insulated</b> cavity walls. In this paper, existing test procedures and measured leakage rates are discussed and related to the dimensions of the cavity wall and the characteristics of the insulation material...|$|E
