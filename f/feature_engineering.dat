50|$|Extracting or {{selecting}} features is {{a combination}} of art and science; developing systems to do so is known as <b>feature</b> <b>engineering.</b> It requires the experimentation of multiple possibilities and the combination of automated techniques with the intuition and knowledge of the domain expert. Automating this process is feature learning, where a machine not only uses features for learning, but learns the features itself.|$|E

50|$|Models of {{this kind}} have {{recently}} attracted much attention within the natural language processing (NLP) community.Formulating problems as constrained optimization problems over the output of learned models has several advantages. It allows one {{to focus on the}} modeling of problems by providing the opportunity to incorporate domain-specific knowledge as global constraints using a first order language. Using this declarative framework frees the developer from low level <b>feature</b> <b>engineering</b> while capturing the problem's domain-specific properties and guarantying exact inference. From a machine learning perspective it allows decoupling the stage of model generation (learning) from that of the constrained inference stage, thus helping to simplify the learning stage while improving the quality of the solutions. For example, in the case of generating compressed sentences, rather than simply relying on a language model to retain the most commonly used n-grams in the sentence, constraints can be used to ensure that if a modifier is kept in the compressed sentence, its subject will also be kept.|$|E

40|$|Abstract. <b>Feature</b> <b>engineering</b> {{deliberately}} stages {{the incorporation}} of elements of functionality into a system according to perceived user and market needs. Conventional refinement based techniques for <b>feature</b> <b>engineering</b> suffer from {{the need to have}} successive features build smoothly on their predecessors, since contradicting what has already been established is anathema for any refinement technique. Real <b>feature</b> <b>engineering</b> however must at times insist on such contradictions. Retrenchment offers a more flexible approach for capturing such less well behaved development steps within a formal framework that interworks smoothly with refinement, and a generic account of â€˜simple â€™ <b>feature</b> <b>engineering</b> (encompassing situations in which operations may be dealt with, one at a time) is given, using a simple language to express feature oriented descriptions (FODs) of operations, and a simple rewriting formalism to express changes in the FOD. The generic account shows that under a set of reasonable assumptions, the retrenchments belong to the class of neat, default retrenchments.
