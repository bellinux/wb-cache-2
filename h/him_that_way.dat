500|$|Ritchson {{described}} Arthur Curry {{as someone}} who will [...] "do anything to save what he loves". The actor {{goes on to say}} that Arthur is [...] "passionate about nature, about the earth, and about the seas", and is not afraid to use his abilities to save those things that are dear to him. When comparing his character to Clark, Ritchson stated that Arthur is more confident in his abilities, and already knows what he can do and what his path is in life. Another big difference the actor pointed out is that unlike Clark, Arthur is willing to sacrifice people and things if it means preserving the greater good. When he first appears, one of Victor Stone's key characteristics is that both he and Clark can relate to the fact that they feel their abilities inhibit them from having a true relationship with the women they love. The writers tried to create parallels between the characters to emphasize this more, like Victor's fear of telling his girlfriend the truth about what LuthorCorp did to his body, and Clark's fear of Lana Lang discovering he is an alien. Writer Tracy Bellomo characterized Oliver as a guy that does not take himself very seriously, and enjoys making fun of people that try to take <b>him</b> <b>that</b> <b>way.</b> Bellomo believed that this is one of the reasons that Oliver is attracted to Lois, with the other being that Lois provides a challenge for him. Oliver's relationship with Clark is designed to [...] "broaden Clark's rather limited horizons", and to teach Clark that a world exists beyond Smallville.|$|E
500|$|Konami {{video game}} {{developer}} Tomm Hulett described Kefka as a pure villain, stating [...] "Unlike most Japanese stories, Kefka {{did not have}} shades of gray. He didn't have a tragic past that {{turned him into a}} sadistic clown that you felt sorry for him over. He didn't have some greater purpose that he lost sight of. Yet, at the same time, he wasn't 'evil for evil's sake.' There was something twisted and nasty inside him that MADE <b>him</b> <b>that</b> <b>way...</b> and you could feel it... but you also knew there wasn't any good in there." [...] That he is a central villain of the entire game also serves to intensify a players negative fixation on him. In a review of Final Fantasy VI Advance, IGN stated [...] "it's the game's maniacal nihilist Kefka that really stands out. The most evil and destructive villain in the entire Final Fantasy franchise, Kefka's brutality and ruthlessness is unmatched and he has to be seen to be believed." [...] IGN also noted his ability to [...] "tap into primal, instinctive fears", including fears of clowns. CNet in their own review described him as [...] "the unrivaled star of the show...he's the kind of villain that you will love to hate", comparing him to Jack Nicholson's portrayal of the Joker and calling his laugh one of the greatest sound effects in any video game. Kotaku has called Kefka the greatest video game villain of all time, and attempted to explain players' lasting fascination by noting that he inspires such hatred that when his evil plans are finally thwarted, the sense of joy from victory is so much the greater. GameSpy compared Kefka's final form as a representation of Lucifer, highlighted by his powerful [...] "Fallen Angel" [...] attack. Another theory posited by GameSpot is that the intense reaction to Kefka {{stems from the fact that}} he is one of the few villains in Final Fantasy, or any game, that succeeds at his master plan before he is defeated.|$|E
2500|$|The film centres on Funshine Bear, a Care Bear {{who loves}} to laugh and tell jokes. [...] After one of his jokes backfires against Grumpy, another of the Bears, Funshine runs away {{to find a place}} where others can {{appreciate}} his talents better. [...] He discovers a town known as Joke-a-lot, where laughter and humour are the order of the day, and soon becomes the area's [...] "King". [...] Unknown to the Bear, a rat named Sir Funnybone is using <b>him</b> <b>that</b> <b>way</b> in order to possess an important object called the Royal Sceptre.|$|E

60|$|Mr. Buffin did {{not affect}} to misunderstand. Sid Marks was looking at <b>him</b> in <b>that</b> nasty <b>way.</b> Otto the Sausage was looking at <b>him</b> in <b>that</b> nasty <b>way.</b> Rabbit Butler was looking at <b>him</b> in <b>that</b> nasty <b>way.</b> This was an {{occasion}} where manly frankness was the quality most to be aimed at. To be misunderstood in the circles in which Mr. Buffin moved meant something more than the mere risk of being treated with cold displeasure.|$|R

2500|$|Former Prime Minister Jean Chrétien {{has come}} out criticizing Harper's {{leadership}} abilities, noting especially Harper's controlling ways with his cabinet ministers, saying he would have quit if former prime minister Pierre Elliott Trudeau had treated <b>him</b> <b>that</b> <b>way,</b> that [...] "Mr. Dion was a minister for nine years. And Mr. Harper arrived there with no experience and it shows", that the phrase 'Tory times are bad times', in use since the 1930s, was still true and that [...] "Harper destroyed 50 years of relationships with China", Canada's second biggest trading partner after the US, noting both past Liberal and Progressive Conservative governments sought to maintain its dealings with the key trading partner. Former Prime Minister Paul Martin has also supported Dion's plans and abilities, and many have noted Dion's ability to get both Chrétien and Martin to support him, despite Chrétien and Martin's ongoing feud.|$|E

60|$|RIDGEON. Precisely. To inject {{a vaccine}} into a patient without first testing his opsonin is as near murder as a respectable {{practitioner}} can get. If I {{wanted to kill}} s man I should kill <b>him</b> <b>that</b> <b>way.</b>|$|E
6000|$|... "You oughtn't, you know. When a man {{has taken}} a girl off with <b>him</b> in <b>that</b> <b>way,</b> he should go on with it. It's a deuced serious thing, you know." ...|$|R

6000|$|Then it {{came over}} her more poignantly {{that she should}} not see him again. She could not accept that; she could not part with <b>him</b> <b>that</b> <b>way.</b> [...] "If you should send for me I'd come," [...] she said at last.|$|E
60|$|EDSTASTON [sentimentally]. Don't say that. Don't {{think of}} <b>him</b> in <b>that</b> <b>way.</b> After all, {{he was your}} husband; and {{whatever}} his faults may have been, {{it is not for}} you to think unkindly of him.|$|R

60|$|And me? There is {{no danger}} of the working man ever reading my books, so I shan't hurt <b>him</b> <b>that</b> <b>way.</b> But oh, I would like to save him alive, in his living, spontaneous, {{original}} being. I can't help it. It is my passionate instinct.|$|E
