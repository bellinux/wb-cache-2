5|$|The {{striking}} electoral {{victory of}} Solidarity {{candidates in the}} limited elections, and the subsequent formation of the first non-communist government in the region in decades, encouraged many similar peaceful transitions from communist party rule <b>in</b> <b>Central</b> <b>and</b> <b>Eastern</b> <b>Europe</b> {{in the second half}} of 1989.|$|E
5|$|The Danube {{crested newt}} or Danube newt (Triturus dobrogicus) is {{a species of}} newt found <b>in</b> <b>central</b> <b>and</b> <b>eastern</b> <b>Europe,</b> along the basin of the Danube river {{and some of its}} tributaries and in the Dnieper delta. It has a smaller and more slender body than the other crested newts in genus Triturus but like these, males develop a {{conspicuous}} jagged seam on back and tail during breeding season.|$|E
5|$|East–West {{tensions}} rapidly subsided {{through the}} mid-to-late 1980s, culminating {{with the final}} summit in Moscow in 1989, when Gorbachev and George H. W. Bush signed the START I arms control treaty. During the following year it became apparent to the Soviets that oil and gas subsidies, along {{with the cost of}} maintaining massive troops levels, represented a substantial economic drain. In addition, the security advantage of a buffer zone was recognised as irrelevant and the Soviets officially declared that they would no longer intervene in the affairs of allied states <b>in</b> <b>Central</b> <b>and</b> <b>Eastern</b> <b>Europe.</b>|$|E

5|$|<b>In</b> <b>central</b> <b>and</b> <b>eastern</b> <b>Europe,</b> {{the state}} played {{a greater role}} in organising these pilgrimages. The National Orthodox Romanian Women's Society, {{supported}} by the church and the state, played an important part in enabling regular pilgrimages to important Romanian sites up until 1939. In Germany and Italy, the Fascist governments took a keen interest in organising such journeys. In Italy, these involved large, state-influenced organisations, and the government steadily discouraged private visits or unofficial groups from taking part in alternative ceremonies at these sites. In Nazi Germany, pilgrimages were organised to the new war memorials sponsored by the government in the 1930s.|$|E
5|$|During the {{subsequent}} Potsdam Conference in July–August 1945, {{the three major}} allied powers ratified the colossal westerly shift of Polish borders and approved its new territory between the Oder–Neisse line and Curzon Line. Following {{the destruction of the}} Polish-Jewish population in the Holocaust, the flight and expulsion of Germans in the west, resettlement of Ukrainians in the east, and the repatriation of Poles from Kresy, Poland became {{for the first time in}} its history an ethnically homogeneous nation-state without prominent minorities. The new government solidified its political power over the next two years, while the communist Polish United Workers' Party (PZPR) under Bolesław Bierut gained firm control over the country, which would become part of the postwar Soviet sphere of influence <b>in</b> <b>Central</b> <b>and</b> <b>Eastern</b> <b>Europe.</b>|$|E
5|$|However, the {{aftermath}} of the Cold War is not always easily erased, as many of the economic and social tensions that were exploited to fuel Cold War competition in parts of the Third World remain acute. The breakdown of state control {{in a number of areas}} formerly ruled by communist governments produced new civil and ethnic conflicts, particularly in the former Yugoslavia. <b>In</b> <b>Central</b> <b>and</b> <b>Eastern</b> <b>Europe,</b> the end of the Cold War has ushered in an era of economic growth and an increase in the number of liberal democracies, while in other parts of the world, such as Afghanistan, independence was accompanied by state failure.|$|E

5|$|In 1871, Germany {{became a}} nation state {{when most of}} the German states unified into the Prussian-dominated German Empire. After World War I and the {{revolution}} of 1918–19, the Empire was replaced by the parliamentary Weimar Republic. The Nazi seizure of power in 1933 led to the establishment of a dictatorship, World War II and the Holocaust. After the end of World War II in Europe and a period of Allied occupation, two German states were founded: the democratic West Germany and the socialist East Germany. Following the Revolutions of 1989 that ended communist rule <b>in</b> <b>Central</b> <b>and</b> <b>Eastern</b> <b>Europe,</b> the country was reunified on 3 October 1990.|$|E
5|$|The invasions {{brought new}} ethnic groups to Europe, {{although}} some regions received a larger influx of new peoples than others. In Gaul for instance, the invaders settled much more {{extensively in the}} north-east than in the south-west. Slavs settled <b>in</b> <b>Central</b> <b>and</b> <b>Eastern</b> <b>Europe</b> and the Balkan Peninsula. The settlement of peoples was accompanied by changes in languages. The Latin of the Western Roman Empire was gradually replaced by languages based on, but distinct from, Latin, collectively known as Romance languages. These changes from Latin to the new languages took many centuries. Greek remained {{the language of the}} Byzantine Empire, but the migrations of the Slavs added Slavic languages to Eastern Europe.|$|E
5|$|During Jean-Marie Le Pen's presidency, {{the party}} has also been active in {{establishing}} extra-parliamentary confederations. During the FN's 1997 national congress, the FN established the loose Euronat group, which consisted {{of a variety of}} European right-wing parties. Having failed to cooperate in the European Parliament, Le Pen sought in the mid-1990s to initiate contacts with other far-right parties, including from non-EU countries. The FN drew most support <b>in</b> <b>Central</b> <b>and</b> <b>Eastern</b> <b>Europe,</b> and Le Pen visited the Turkish Welfare Party. The significant Freedom Party of Austria (FPÖ) refused to join the efforts, as Jörg Haider sought to distance himself from Le Pen, and later attempted to build a separate group. In 2009, the FN joined the Alliance of European National Movements; it left the alliance since. Along with some other European parties, the FN in 2010 visited Japan's Issuikai ("right-wing") movement and the Yasukuni Shrine.|$|E

5|$|The Germanic {{tribes are}} thought to date from the Nordic Bronze Age or the Pre-Roman Iron Age. From {{southern}} Scandinavia and north Germany, they expanded south, east and west from the 1st centuryBC, coming {{into contact with the}} Celtic tribes of Gaul as well as Iranian, Baltic, and Slavic tribes <b>in</b> <b>Central</b> <b>and</b> <b>Eastern</b> <b>Europe.</b> Under Augustus, Rome began to invade Germania (an area extending roughly from the Rhine to the Ural Mountains). In 9AD, three Roman legions led by Varus were defeated by the Cheruscan leader Arminius. By 100AD, when Tacitus wrote Germania, Germanic tribes had settled along the Rhine and the Danube (the Limes Germanicus), occupying most of the area of modern Germany; Austria, Baden Württemberg, southern Bavaria, southern Hessen and the western Rhineland, however, were Roman provinces: Noricum, Raetia, Germania Superior, and Germania Inferior.|$|E
5|$|The game {{features}} {{about fifty}} 18th-century factions; however, only eleven {{of the most}} powerful and influential are playable. In western Europe, these are Great Britain, France, the United Dutch Provinces, Spain and Sweden, and <b>in</b> <b>central</b> <b>and</b> <b>eastern</b> <b>Europe,</b> Prussia, Austria, Russia and Poland–Lithuania. In the Balkans and Middle East, the Ottoman Empire is the principal faction, while the Maratha Confederacy and Mughal Empire are the major powers on the Indian subcontinent. The New World colonies of the major powers are represented as protectorates of their home nation. The establishment of new nations during the era, such as Revolutionary France and the United States, and the fall of native states to the larger empires, is reflected in the game, although these major events may be averted by player actions. Smaller factions, such as the German and Italian states, Native American tribes, and North African countries, are also represented.|$|E
5|$|The Battle of Grunwald, First Battle of Tannenberg or Battle of Žalgiris, {{was fought}} on 15 July 1410 during the Polish–Lithuanian–Teutonic War. The {{alliance}} of the Kingdom of Poland and the Grand Duchy of Lithuania, led respectively by King Władysław II Jagiełło (Jogaila) and Grand Duke Vytautas, decisively defeated the German–Prussian Teutonic Knights, led by Grand Master Ulrich von Jungingen. Most of the Teutonic Knights' leadership {{were killed or}} taken prisoner. Although defeated, the Teutonic Knights withstood the siege of their fortress in Marienburg (Malbork) and suffered minimal territorial losses at the Peace of Thorn (1411) (Toruń), with other territorial disputes continuing until the Peace of Melno in 1422. The knights, however, would never recover their former power, and the financial burden of war reparations caused internal conflicts and an economic downturn in the lands under their control. The battle shifted {{the balance of power}} <b>in</b> <b>Central</b> <b>and</b> <b>Eastern</b> <b>Europe</b> and marked the rise of the Polish–Lithuanian union as the dominant political and military force in the region.|$|E
