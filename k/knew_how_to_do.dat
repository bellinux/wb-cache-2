5|$|A major talking {{point at}} the conference was the {{discovery}} by Willis Lamb and his graduate student Robert Retherford shortly before the conference began {{that one of the}} two possible quantum states of hydrogen atoms had slightly more energy than predicted by the Paul Dirac's theory; this became known as the Lamb shift. Oppenheimer and Weisskopf suggested that this was a result of quantum fluctuations of the electromagnetic field. Pre-war quantum electrodynamics (QED) gave absurd, infinite values for this; but the Lamb shift showed that it was both real and finite. Hans Kramers proposed renormalization as a solution, but no one <b>knew</b> <b>how</b> <b>to</b> <b>do</b> the calculation.|$|E
25|$|An early {{problem in}} {{recruitment}} was the women's {{adjustment to the}} new agricultural life. As Saint Marie de L'Incarnation wrote, the filles du roi were mostly town girls, {{and only a few}} <b>knew</b> <b>how</b> <b>to</b> <b>do</b> manual farm work. This problem remained but, in later years, more rural girls were recruited.|$|E
25|$|Bernard also {{extensively}} enfeoffed {{his followers}} with Welsh land. Richard fitz Pons {{may have been}} enfeoffed at Cantref Selyff on the western border of Brycheiniog and immediately he began in miniature the process whereby Bernard had come to rule Brycheiniog. However, Richard's son Walter is the first recorded landholder at Cantref Selyff. Furthermore, Bernard enfeoffed {{the sons of the}} king he had displaced in the less habitable land, thereby creating a loyal Welsh aristocracy and extracting more out of his land than the Normans otherwise <b>knew</b> <b>how</b> <b>to</b> <b>do.</b> The Normans lived predominantly in the valleys and lowlands in an agrarian society while the Welsh kept to the hills and mountains living pastorally, thus creating an overall economic gain. Among Bleddyn's sons, Gwrgan received Blaen Llyfni and Aberllyfni while Caradog received an unnamed hill country, and Drymbenog, Bleddyn's brother, was given land neighbouring that of Richard fitz Pons.|$|E

500|$|Farrell {{notified}} Groves {{that the}} Little Boy bomb {{would be ready}} for use on or about 3 August, weather permitting. In {{the space of a}} week on Tinian, four B-29s crashed and burned on the runway. Parsons became very concerned. If a B-29 [...] crashed with a Little Boy, the fire could cook off the explosive and detonate the weapon, with catastrophic consequences. Parsons raised the possibility of arming the bomb in flight with Farrell, who agreed that {{it might be a good}} idea. Farrell asked Parsons if he <b>knew</b> <b>how</b> <b>to</b> <b>do</b> it. [...] "No sir, I don't", Parsons conceded, [...] "but I've got all afternoon to learn." [...] After the bombing of Hiroshima on 6 August, Farrell, along with Generals Carl Spaatz, Nathan Twining, Barney Giles and James H. Davies, debriefed Parsons, the aircrews and the observers, and sent Groves a detailed report.|$|E
500|$|In 1974, Mardas held an {{expensive}} {{party for the}} then {{heir to the throne}} of Spain, Prince Juan Carlos; this secured Mardas a contract. After the assassination of Admiral Carrero Blanco the Spanish royal family thought it ought to acquire more bullet-proof cars, although one car was shipped to England, where it was parked in Chobham for almost a year as nobody <b>knew</b> <b>how</b> <b>to</b> <b>do</b> the work needed to upgrade it. The second contract (worth over £1/2 million) allowed Mardas to set up new security companies: Alcom Devices Ltd, and Night Vision Systems Ltd (under the collective name of [...] "Project Alcom") in St Albans Mews off Edgware Road, London, to provide a sophisticated communications system for Juan Carlos, so he could be in constant contact with his security services. Mardas employed Arthur Johnson (known as Johnny Johnson), a former Ministry of Defence official.|$|E
500|$|It {{had long}} been a dream in the Scrubs writer's room to do a musical episode. Scrubs creator Bill Lawrence is a self-confessed musical theatre [...] "nerd," [...] as are many of the writers. In addition, many of the cast members have had {{backgrounds}} in musical theatre. According to Lawrence, [...] "I knew that Donald [...] and Judy [...] were Broadway-style singers and dancers. I knew Sarah [...] could dance, because she danced when she was young. I knew Zach [...] loved musical theater. I had actually seen Ken Jenkins in Big River on Broadway when I was a kid. Neil Flynn and John C. McGinley were the last two guys to admit that they'd {{done a lot of}} musicals and stuff, but being actors, they had.

500|$|In {{providing}} instrumentation for the record, Kurstin {{used all}} of his instruments, such as a Mellotron and a Chamberlin, taping them from a distance to simulate the Wall of Sound, a recording technique originally developed by Phil Spector that was popular in the early 1960s. He enlisted Clarkson to provide all the background vocals herself. Clarkson, who grew up singing in a choir, {{was pleased with the}} aspect, saying: [...] "Blending is something I <b>knew</b> <b>how</b> <b>to</b> <b>do</b> from childhood. Sometimes I'd have to do an alto instead of a soprano because they needed a bigger sound. But I've never had to do anything like this before—doing all my backup vocals, essentially being my own choir." [...] Together, they began to record in May 2013 and continued through the summer of that year, beginning by recording [...] "White Christmas" [...] with Clarkson in the vocal booth and with Kurstin on a piano. She commented: [...] "The production is all him. I would be just like 'Hey, can we make this more jazz? Hey, can we make this more bluesy. And he just, like Harry Potter, made this happen. It's so weird." ...|$|E
2500|$|Schembechler {{thought so}} much of Revelli’s {{performance}} that he invited him back every year to teach the freshmen what Michigan tradition was about. [...] Schembechler recalled, “He was absolutely great, and the freshmen absolutely loved it. [...] And let me tell you, {{every one of those}} freshmen came out of that session with Revelli knowing ‘The Victors.’ [...] They knew the words, they knew how to sing it, and they knew how to emphasize the right spots. [...] They flat out <b>knew</b> <b>how</b> <b>to</b> <b>do</b> it. [...] And it was only because he came over there with the idea that those guys were {{going to come out of}} that meeting room knowing how to sing this fight song the right way or else! [...] And they did. [...] That was Bill Revelli.” ...|$|E
2500|$|And I {{passed a}} house, {{and there was}} a woman, and I {{remember}} that she was a little tongue-tied, sitting on a step. And she saw what was happening, and she called me in. And she spent about 20 minutes treating me like an adult, teaching me how - of course the ends were gone off the shoestrings - to twist the end and put it through the hole. Then we laced and unlaced my shoes three or four times until I <b>knew</b> <b>how</b> <b>to</b> <b>do</b> it, and then she taught me how to tie a knot. And we sat there for a while, and then I went along. And, as little as I was, I thought, [...] "I'd like to be like that kind of person. I'd like to be like her." [...] I think it influenced my entire life, a little thing.|$|E

2500|$|Inspired by a {{performance}} of Japanese taiko drummers Witer formed Big Pig: [...] "When I saw them, the key to it was orchestration – that each guy had his own part. There was no improvisation at all. So from that point on, I <b>knew</b> <b>how</b> <b>to</b> <b>do</b> it. It {{was just a matter}} of getting the right people". The initial incarnation involved eight or nine drummers, with Witer trying to sing over the poly-rhythmic din; while members of the band came and went. At an early gig Witer's former band mate, Sherine Abeyratne, attended and subsequently joined the ensemble. As a vocalist, she had been a member of various groups: Grand Wazoo, The Editions, Bang, Big Choir, Bob Starkie Shape Up, Gospel Truth, Jo Jo Zep Band, Black Coffee, Dianna Boss and The Extremes, and The Rock Party. In 1988 Sherine recalled [...] "I started joining bands eight years ago, as long as the music was high-energy, really strong, that was the criterion". She had also toured with INXS as a backing vocalist. Another early member was Nick Disbray on vocals and percussion.|$|E
2500|$|Stephanie [...] "Hex" [...] Bendixsen (Series 5–12) {{took over}} the role from Junglist in time for series 5. Bendixsen had also auditioned for ABC3, but won the role on Good Game after {{approaching}} Bajo at Supanova as a fan, and being told Good Game was looking for someone. She sent {{in a series of}} reviews, the style of which she said she already <b>knew</b> <b>how</b> <b>to</b> <b>do</b> having already watched the show for a couple of years. She later did a screen test and ended up getting the job [...] "quite quickly". Her first episode was on 26 October 2009. Hex got into games relatively late as she did not have a gaming household. Her first games were MUDs – specifically the game Lensmoor which she started playing at age 15), and enjoyed as it was like [...] "collectively writing a book". Hex says she is okay with the harder parts of production as they are a part of her job. She said she finds great satisfaction in seeing a completed show go to air as so much time and love has gone into it. Hex states that, [...] "The only thing that's sometimes difficult is that I have less time to play the games that I want to play recreationally, because the games I'm reviewing for work take priority." [...] While she is happy to weigh in on gender-related issues, she also acknowledges that she {{does not want to be}} a [...] "poster girl" [...] for it and instead wants to be thought of as [...] "a PERSON who just enjoys gaming".|$|E
2500|$|His first work as {{writer and}} {{director}} was Norberto's Deadline (2010), about a shy and unemployed salesman named Norberto who start to study acting to gain confidence on himself. As screenwriter, he had previously collaborated on the script for Daniel Burman's El nido vacío (2008). The film was filmed in Uruguay and produced by both countries from the Río de la Plata, [...] "The crew that I chose is my 'dream team'; it's the people I dreamed to work with, beyond nationality, and ended up being a very mixed team, a mixture from Uruguay and Argentina," [...] said Hendler. He had never studied filmmaking before, he says, [...] "Many times {{we begin with the}} assumption that the problem of film is on the technical knowledge, but the technical rules are the quickest to learn and the least you use. Experience in the use of certain resources is what gives you the possible solutions or shortcuts at the time of transporting to the screen what you imagined. The more knowledge you have, the easier you reach it, but 'the truths' about cinematic technique are the easiest to solve as a director. There were things I already <b>knew</b> <b>how</b> <b>to</b> <b>do,</b> and some others I didn't, and depend on what you're looking in each movie." [...] By 2003, Hendler had started writing an ensamble story called [...] "The Day Ends at 10," [...] he dismissed the story but the characters were kept for another ensemble film, [...] "The Move", which included a character named Norberto, a role that started to have more and more prominence, until the story finally became Norberto's Deadline.|$|E
