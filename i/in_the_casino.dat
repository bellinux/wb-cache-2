5|$|In the mid 1960s, Sands and its {{adjacent}} properties {{were bought}} by the reclusive businessman Howard Hughes, who built a 500-room tower and modernized the hotel. After the 1970s it fell into decline until its final owner, Sheldon Adelson, {{made the decision to}} shut it down and to build a brand new resort. The last dice <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>casino</b> was rolled by Bob Stupak just after 6pm on June 30, 1996. On November 26 of that year, it was finally imploded and demolished, much to the dismay of longtime employees and sentimentalists. Today, The Venetian stands where the Sands once stood.|$|E

5|$|Bond calls Tree to enquire further {{about the}} payment of his fee and is told {{to go to the}} Tiara Hotel in Las Vegas. The Tiara is owned by Seraffimo Spang and {{operates}} as the headquarters of the Spangled Mob. Spang also owns an old Western ghost town, named Spectreville, restored to be his own private holiday retreat. At the hotel Bond finally receives payment through a rigged blackjack game where the dealer is Tiffany. After winning the money he is owed he disobeys his orders from Tree by continuing to gamble <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>casino</b> and wins heavily. Spang suspects that Bond may be a 'plant' and has him captured and tortured at Spectreville. With Tiffany's help he escapes from Spectreville aboard a railway push-car with Seraffimo Spang in pursuit aboard an old Western train. Bond changes the points and re-routes the train onto a dead-end, and shoots Spang before the resulting crash. Assisted by Leiter, Bond and Tiffany go via California to New York, where they board the RMS Queen Elizabeth to travel to London, a relationship developing between them as they go. Wint and Kidd observe their embarkation and follow them on board. They kidnap Tiffany, planning to kill her and throw her overboard.

40|$|The aim of {{the present}} study was to {{understand}} the clinical and social construction of pathological gamblers in Macau.

Some Paichais are “resident” gamblers <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>casinos</b> who live on the complimentary food and drinks that <b>the</b> <b>casinos</b> provide and sleep on the couches inside <b>the</b> <b>casino</b> premises. To finance their gambling, they hustle and sometimes beg for money. Fifteen participants, ranging in age from 24 to 53 years, were recruited from <b>the</b> <b>casinos</b> <b>in</b> Macau who were repeatedly observed and interviewed. The emphasis of the interviews were to explore the participants’ accounts of how their gambling problem had developed and how gambling influenced their lives and their significant others. The Canadian Problem Gambling Index Problem Gambling Severity Index (PGSI) (Ferris & Wynne, 2001) was used to assess their gambling status. Clinical assessment of the participants was based on the results of clinical interviews, observation notes and the scores on the PGSI. It was found that the majority of the participants could be classified as belonging to the antisocial-impulsive type according to the Blaszczynski and Nower (2002) pathways model of problem and pathological gambling. Paichais can be described as manipulative, cunning, impulsive, reckless and lacking the ability to reflect on their actions.

It's just that each person inherently has vastly different possibilities of life trajectory, a different version of which is explored and shown in the three iterations.)
