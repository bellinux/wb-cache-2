500|$|What Are You Going to Do with Your Life? is {{the eighth}} studio album by the English rock band Echo & the Bunnymen. The album saw the {{departure}} of bassist Les Pattinson from the group, partly due to disagreements with vocalist Ian McCulloch; McCulloch and the remaining band member, guitarist Will Sergeant, subsequently recorded the record with session musicians. The London Metropolitan Orchestra provided backing music and the American alternative hip hop band Fun Lovin' Criminals appeared as guest musicians on two tracks. The album was produced by Alan Douglas and Echo & the Bunnymen and it was recorded at various locations throughout England. Feeling sidelined during the recording of the album, Sergeant described it as [...] "probably the worst time <b>in</b> <b>my</b> <b>whole</b> life".|$|E
500|$|The {{song was}} played only once and {{received}} minor treatments afterwards, {{with the addition}} of a cello part in the introduction and some editing, which included removing a verse to reduce the song's length. Eno was outraged that U2 wanted to shorten the song, and he was adamant that the band not alter the original track too much, saying, [...] "These fucking guys, they're supposed to be so spiritual—they don't spot a miracle when it hits them in the face. Nothing like that ever happened to me in the studio <b>in</b> <b>my</b> <b>whole</b> life." [...] The band's original concept for No Line on the Horizon was to create an album of future hymns—songs that would be played forever. According to Eno and Lanois, [...] "Moment of Surrender" [...] is the closest the band came to reaching that concept.|$|E

500|$|Lynda Day (Julia Sawalha) is {{the editor}} of the Junior Gazette. She is strong and opinionated, and is feared by many of her team. Moffat has said that the {{character}} was partly based on the show's [...] "ball-breaking" [...] producer, Sandra C. Hastie. Although she appears very tough, she occasionally exposes her feelings. She quits the paper at the end of [...] "Monday-Tuesday", and in [...] "Day Dreams" [...] laments [...] "Why do I get everything <b>in</b> <b>my</b> <b>whole</b> stupid life wrong?" [...] Intimidated by socialising, she hiccups at the idea. She is so nervous at a cocktail party, in [...] "At Last a Dragon", that she attempts to leave on several occasions.

500|$|As with {{previous}} Echo & the Bunnymen albums, What Are You Going to Do with Your Life? used the London Metropolitan Orchestra to provide backing music. American alternative hip hop band Fun Lovin' Criminals {{appeared on the}} album as guest musicians on two tracks. Sergeant's guitar-work on the album was understated and he later said, [...] "It was probably the worst time <b>in</b> <b>my</b> <b>whole</b> life, doing that LP—I hated it [...] I'm on all the tracks here and there, but generally I just stayed in the tent! It was a horrible experience." [...] The album {{is a collection of}} ballads and {{has been described as a}} follow-up to McCulloch's 1989 solo album, Candleland. In a 2005 interview for Record Collector magazine, McCulloch said, [...] "Will [...] hated the album, and I can understand why. He'd ask me where his guitar was supposed to go on certain songs and I'd say, 'Well, nowhere, it doesn't really have a place'." ...|$|E
500|$|At Oxford, Tarwater {{found a new}} {{perspective}} on life: [...] "I {{used to be in the}} sport for Davis Tarwater. [...] Going to Oxford and seeing the selflessness and ambition of the students transitioned me to being in the sport as a mechanism to do good." [...] The Oxford swim team encouraged him to join its ranks, and he subsequently earned most valuable player honors and a Blue jacket, the British equivalent of a varsity letter. On his newfound perspective, Tarwater said, [...] "Missing the Olympics in 2008 was the best thing that's ever happened <b>in</b> <b>my</b> <b>whole</b> life... I would not have gone to Oxford; I would not have invested in my own personhood... being able to chase an Olympic dream is a gift... I made it a misery. [...] It doesn't have to be a misery." [...] He graduated from Oxford in 2010 with a master's degree in Latin American studies. He described the year at Oxford as the best time of his life.|$|E

500|$|The {{telecast}} {{also received}} unfavorable reaction from various public feminist figures. In {{an interview with}} Los Angeles Daily News author and activist Betty Friedan condemned the [...] "Year of the Woman" [...] theme commenting, [...] "It had no basis in reality. On behalf of women directors, cinematographer, and producers, I resent the travesty of calling that a tribute." [...] Likewise, President of the National Organization for Women's Los Angeles chapter Tammy Bruce chastised ceremony's feminist tribute as [...] "one of the most hypocritical, patronizing things I saw <b>in</b> <b>my</b> <b>whole</b> life." [...] In response, Gil Cates responded towards the criticism of the theme stating, [...] "The theme developed and raised consciousness {{in a way that}} I think is positive, not only for the individual in general but for individual women specifically."

500|$|In 1984, Bannon's {{books were}} {{featured}} in the documentary Before Stonewall about how {{gay men and lesbians}} lived prior to the 1969 Stonewall riots, wherein one woman remembered picking up one of Bannon's books for the first time: [...] "I picked up this paperback and I opened it up... and it sent a shiver of excitement <b>in</b> <b>my</b> <b>whole</b> body that I had never felt before." [...] She was {{featured in the}} Canadian documentary [...] in 1992, which recounted women's personal stories of living as lesbians from the 1940s to 1960s. The books were selected for the Quality Paperback Book Club in 1995. Bannon also provided the foreword for Strange Sisters: The Art of Lesbian Pulp Fiction 1949–1969 in 1999, discussing her reaction to the artwork on her own books and the other lesbian pulp fiction books she bought and read. Five of The Beebo Brinker Chronicles were reissued by Cleis Press again between 2001 and 2003—excluding The Marriage—with autobiographical forewords that described Bannon's experiences of writing the books and her reaction to their popularity, causing another wave of interest.|$|E

They were welcomed as heroes, given a civic reception, and treated to a banquet at the celebrated restaurant Delmonico's. Public interest in the Jeannette story had been high since the first news [...] of the ship's fate had been received from Yakutsk. [...] Bennett had dispatched several reporters to Russia, including John P. Jackson, who had reached the Lena Delta and found the tomb of De Long. [...] In his zeal for a story, Jackson had opened the tomb to search for papers or other records, an act of desecration that Emma De Long described to Bennett as [...] "the bitterest potion I had to swallow <b>in</b> <b>my</b> <b>whole</b> life".

500|$|... "Stupid in Love" [...] is a R power ballad which {{lasts for}} 4:01 (four minutes, one second).

500|$|At 21:30 on 12 September, the Japanese cruiser [...] {{and three}} destroyers shelled the Lunga {{perimeter}} for 20 minutes and illuminated the ridge with a searchlight. Japanese artillery began shelling the Marine lines, but did little damage. At the same time, scattered groups of Kawaguchi's troops began skirmishing with Marines around the ridge. Kawaguchi's 1st Battalion—led by Major Yukichi Kokusho—attacked the Raider's [...] "C" [...] company between the lagoon and the Lunga River, overrunning {{at least one}} platoon and forcing the Marine company to fall back to the ridge. Kokusho's unit became entangled with troops from Kawaguchi's 3rd Battalion under Lieutenant Colonel Kusukichi Watanabe, who were still struggling to reach their attack positions, and the resulting confusion effectively stopped the Japanese attack on the ridge that night. Kawaguchi, who was having trouble locating where he was {{in relation to the}} U.S. Marine lines as well as coordinating his troops' attacks, later complained, [...] "Due to the devilish jungle, the brigade was scattered all over and was completely beyond my control. <b>In</b> <b>my</b> <b>whole</b> life I have never felt so disappointed and helpless." [...] Twelve U.S. Marines were killed; Japanese casualties are unknown but perhaps somewhat greater. Although both Oka in the west and the Kuma unit in the east tried to attack the Marine lines that night, they failed to make contact and halted near the Marine lines at dawn.|$|E
500|$|Biographers Morecambe and Stirling {{believe that}} Cary Grant was the [...] "greatest leading man Hollywood had ever known".

David Thomson and directors Stanley Donen and Howard Hawks concurred that Grant was the greatest and most important actor {{in the history of the}} cinema. He was a favorite of Hitchcock, who admired him and called him [...] "the only actor I ever loved <b>in</b> <b>my</b> <b>whole</b> life", and remained one of Hollywood's top box-office attractions for almost 30 years. Wansell wrote: [...] "To millions of movie-goers around the world, Cary Grant will forever epitomize the glamour, and the style, of Hollywood in its golden years. With his dark hair, and even darker eyes, mischievous smile and effortless elegance, he was, is, and always will be indelibly one of the great movie stars. Since his death in 1986, the incandescence of his screen image has not dimmed for a single moment". Kael stated that the world still thinks of him affectionately, because he [...] "embodies what seems a happier time−a time when we had a simpler relationship to a performer." ...|$|E
