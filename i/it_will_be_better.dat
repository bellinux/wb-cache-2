500|$|At the time, it was {{unheard of}} for a debuting artist {{to receive the}} coveted rating. Author Matthew Gasteier writes, “It's {{difficult}} to overestimate the impact of receiving the five out of five mics, the first such rating given to any new release by the magazine since its then-editor Reginald Dennis put a moratorium on them." [...] Reginald Dennis, former music editor of the magazine and XXL co-founder, later recounted, [...] "Awarding records 5 mics – classic status – has always been, on some levels, troubling to me. I mean, we are not only saying that a particular piece of music is superior to everything that is out now, but <b>it</b> <b>will</b> <b>be</b> <b>better</b> than most things released {{in the future as}} well [...] I only gave one 5 under my watch and it went to Nas's Illmatic." [...] Dennis cited it as [...] "the only time I ever broke the 'no 5' rule" [...] and added, [...] "I told Jon that we'd work all of that stuff out {{when it was time to}} review the album. But everyday, Jon was like, 'yo, this album is 5 mics — seriously, Reg, 5 mics!' ...|$|E
2500|$|Professor Gerhard von Rad of Heidelberg University in the mid-20th-century {{argued that}} the Joseph {{narrative}} {{is closely related to}} earlier Egyptian wisdom writings. Von Rad likened Joseph's actions (for example in [...] ) to the admonition of Ptahhotep (an Egyptian vizier during the late 25th and early 24th centuries BCE): “If you are a tried counselor who sits in the hall of his lord, gather your wits together right well. [...] When you are silent, <b>it</b> <b>will</b> <b>be</b> <b>better</b> than tef-tef flowers. [...] When you speak, you must know how to bring the matter to a conclusion.

2500|$|From {{the outset}} of his rise to power, Hitler {{expressed}} admiration for Britain, and throughout the Battle period he sought neutrality or a peace treaty with Britain. In a secret conference on 23 May 1939, Hitler set out his rather contradictory strategy that an attack on Poland was essential and [...] "will only be successful if the Western Powers keep out of it. If this is impossible, then <b>it</b> <b>will</b> <b>be</b> <b>better</b> to attack in the West and to settle Poland at the same time" [...] with a surprise attack. [...] "If Holland and Belgium are successfully occupied and held, and if France is also defeated, the fundamental conditions for a successful war against England will have been secured. England can then be blockaded from Western France at close quarters by the Air Force, while the Navy with its submarines extend {{the range of the}} blockade." ...|$|E

They're just dudes." ...|$|R
2500|$|... "In {{most public}} seminaries {{textbooks}} are prescribed {{to each of}} the several schools, as the norma docendi in that school; and this is generally done by authority of the trustees. I should not propose this generally in our University, because I believe none of us are so much at the heights of science in the several branches as to undertake this, and therefore that <b>it</b> <b>will</b> <b>be</b> <b>better</b> left to the professors until occasion of interference shall be given. But there is one branch in which we are the best judges, in which heresies may be taught of so interesting a character to our own State and to the United States, as to make it a duty in us to lay down the principles which are to be taught. It is that of government... one of that school of quondam federalism, now consolidation. It is our duty to guard against such principles being disseminated among our youth and the diffusion of that poison, by a previous prescription of the texts to be followed in their discourses."—Thomas Jefferson to -----, 1825.
