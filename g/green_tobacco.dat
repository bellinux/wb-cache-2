The organization interviewed 44 teens, who worked full-time on farms during the 2007-8 growing season. The child-laborers complained of low pay and long hours, {{as well as physical}} and sexual abuse by their supervisors. They also reported suffering from <b>Green</b> <b>tobacco</b> sickness, a form of nicotine poisoning. When wet leaves are handled, nicotine from the leaves gets absorbed in the skin and causes nausea, vomiting, and dizziness. Children were exposed to 50-cigarettes-worth of nicotine through direct contact with tobacco leaves. This level of nicotine in children can permanently alter brain structure and function.|$|E

Go through severe acrobatic {{exercises}} in and about a tonga for four hours; then, having eaten and drank till you can no more, sprawl in the cool of a nullah bed with your head among the <b>green</b> <b>tobacco,</b> and your mind adrift with the one little cloud in a royally blue sky. Earth has nothing more to offer her children than this deep delight of animal well-being. There were butterflies in the tobacco--six different kinds, and a little rat came out and drank at the ford. To him succeeded the flight into Egypt. The white banks of the ford framed the picture perfectly--the Mother in blue, on a great white donkey, holding the Child in her arms, and Joseph walking beside, his hand upon the donkey's withers. By all the laws of the East, Joseph should have been riding and the Mother walking. This was an exception decreed for the Englishman's special benefit. It was very warm and very pleasant, and, somehow, the passers by the ford grew indistinct, and the nullah became a big English garden, with a cuckoo singing far down in the orchard, among the apple-blossoms. The cuckoo started the dream. He was the only real thing in it, for on waking the garden slipped back into the water, but the cuckoo remained and called and called for all the world as though he had been a veritable English cuckoo. [...] "Cuckoo--cuckoo--cuck;" [...] then a pause and renewal of the cry from another quarter of the horizon. After that the ford became distasteful, so the procession was driven forward and in time plunged into what must have been a big city once, but the only inhabitants were oil-men. There were abundance of tombs here, and one carried a life-like carving in high relief of a man on horseback spearing a foot-soldier. Hard by this place the road or rut turned by great gardens, very cool and pleasant, full of tombs and black-faced monkeys who quarrelled among the tombs, and shut in from the sun by gigantic banians and mango trees. Under the trees and behind the walls, priests sat singing; and the Englishman would have inquired into what strange place he had fallen, but the men did not understand him.|$|E

40|$|The chiral {{separation}} of minor alkaloids from tobacco {{is of interest}} because R and S isomers of these compounds have differences in their physiological activity. This difference is also reflected in the physiological properties of tobaccospecificN’-nitrosamines (TSNAs), in particular that of N’-nitrosonornicotine. This compound results mainly from nornicotinenitrosation. The previously reported analytical techniques for the enantiomer {{separation of}} minor alkaloids have various shortcomings, such {{as the need for}} bidimensional chromatography or poor enantiomer separation. A new method for the analysis of nornicotine, anabasine and anatabine has been developed, based on an original derivatization and a simple gas chromatography/ mass spectrometry (GC/MS) analysis. The method allows separate quantitation of S-nornicotine and R-nornicotine, and the analysis of anabasine and anatabine (without isomer separation). It was found that the proportion of S-nornicotine in the total nornicotine present in tobacco varies, depending on the tobacco type, between 52. 6 % for a flue-cured tobacco to 91. 4 % for a Burley. <b>Green</b> <b>tobaccos</b> (freeze dried) showed lower levels of minor alkaloids and S-nornicotine accounted for between 31. 6 % to 43. 8 % of the total nornicotine (in the analyzed samples) ...|$|R

The Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA) has set the legal limit (permissible exposure limit) for nicotine exposure in the workplace as 0.5 mg/m3 skin exposure over an 8-hour workday. The US National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health (NIOSH) has set a recommended exposure limit (REL) of 0.5 mg/m3 skin exposure over an 8-hour workday.

The distinct etiology of eosinophilic pneumonia is unknown, although the previous case series have indicated a relationship between acute eosinophilic pneumonia and the exposure to exogenous substances including the constituents of cigarettes. Case Summary: A 60 -year-old nonsmoking female, who had started to harvest and sort tobacco leaves two months before presentation, was admitted because of persistent coughing, breathlessness, and general malaise. Her laboratory findings revealed eosinophilia. Chest computed tomography showed nonsegmental airspace consolidations bilaterally.

40|$|Since ancient times, {{plants have}} been an {{exemplary}} source of medicine. Tobacco is an agricultural product processed from the leaves of plants in the genus Nicotiana. In Indian agriculture, tobacco has a prominent place. Tobacco could be developed as an important food crop in combination with its traditional use for smoking and chewing.

The chemistry of tobacco is unique with the presence of a wide spectrum of chemical compounds of which nicotine, solanesol, malic and citric acid were identified as potential chemicals which could be recovered and converted to value-added products. The alkaloid nicotine is popularly considered the most characteristic constituent of tobacco but nicotine is not highly addictive on its own.

I searched for the cassava root, which the Indians, in all that climate, make their bread of; but I could find none. I saw large plants of aloes, but did not understand them. I saw several sugar-canes, but wild; and, for want of cultivation, imperfect. I contented myself with these discoveries for this time; and came back, musing with myself what course I might take to know the virtue and goodness of any of the fruits or plants which I should discover; but could bring it to no conclusion; for, in short, I had made so little observation while I was in the Brazils, that I knew little of the plants in the field; at least, very little that might serve me to any purpose now in my distress.|$|R
