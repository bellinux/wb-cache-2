50|$|<b>Immunoglobulin</b> <b>D</b> (IgD) is an {{antibody}} isotype {{that makes}} up about 1% of proteins in the plasma membranes of immature B-lymphocytes where it is usually coexpressed with another cell surface antibody called IgM. IgD is also produced in a secreted form that is found in very small amounts in blood serum, representing 0.25% of immunoglobulins in serum. Relative molecular mass and half-life of sIgD is 185 kDa and 2.8 days, respectively. Secreted IgD is produced as a monomeric antibody with two heavy chains of the delta (δ) class, and two Ig light chains.|$|E

We report a case of <b>immunoglobulin</b> <b>D</b> multiple myeloma in a 53 -year-old Caucasian male patient with previous medical history of anaplastic oligodendroglioma status post-surgical resection who was evaluated for back pain while mowing the lawn. His physical examination showed tenderness over the lower thoracic vertebrae with no sensory or motor impairment. Initial lab investigations showed normocytic anemia and hypercalcemia with low parathyroid hormone. Magnetic resonance imaging of thoracic spine with and without contrast showed acute pathological fracture of the T 12 vertebral body with enhancing soft tissue which extended into the left ventral epidural space and left T 11 –T 12 neural foramen. Serum protein electrophoresis showed abnormal protein band in the gamma globulin. Free light chain assay showed serum free kappa which was elevated at 3, 090. 0 mg/L (reference range 3. 3 – 19. 4 mg/L). <b>Immunoglobulin</b> <b>D</b> was elevated at 566. 0 mg/dL (reference range &#x 3 c; 15. 3 mg/dL).

The restriction fragment length polymorphism of the hpd region in different strains was analyzed by Southern blot analyses of PstI- or EcoRI-digested genomic DNA from 100 H. influenzae strains. The analysis was performed by using isolated fragments of the cloned hpd gene, originating from the nontypeable H. influenzae 772, as probes.

The analysis also showed that restriction endonuclease sites within the gene were more conserved than sites adjacent to the hpd gene. An interesting difference between type b strains and unencapsulated strains was observed. The majority of type b strains seem to have a 1. 4 -kbp DNA fragment upstream of the hpd gene that is absent in nontypeable strains.

Criteria for the diagnosis include findings of: a) long term hypereosinophila (i.e. eosinophil blood counts >1,500/microliter) plus physical findings and symptoms associated with the disease; b) bone marrow analysis showing abnormally high levels of eosinophils; c) elevated serum levels of Immunoglobulin E, other <b>immunoglobulins,</b> and CCL17; <b>d)</b> eosinophil infiltrates in afflicted tissues; e) increased numbers of blood and/or bone marrow T cells bearing abnormal immunophenotype cluster of differentiation markers as defined by fluorescence-activated cell sorting (see above section on Pathogenesis); f) abnormal T cell receptor arrangements as defined by polymerase chain reaction methods (see above section on Pathogenesis); and g) evidence of excessive IL-5 secretion by lymphocytes (see above section on Pathogenesis).

40|$|To {{increase}} the inherently weak immunogenicity of synthetic peptide vaccines, we used recombinant DNA techniques to generate chimeras between immunogenic determinants of {{human immunodeficiency virus}} type 1 (HIV- 1) gp 120 and antibody Fab fragments reactive with surface structures displayed specifically on human antigen-presenting cells (APCs), including surface <b>immunoglobulin</b> <b>D</b> (sIgD) and class II major histocompatibility complex (MHC) molecules. Hybridomas producing anti-human MHC class II (HLA-DR) or surface <b>immunoglobulin</b> <b>D</b> monoclonal antibodies (MAbs) that recognize nonpolymorphic determinants were used to clone chimeric Fab gene fragments by employing an established procedure to generate antigen-binding Fab libraries in phagemid vector pComb 3. Molecular and immunochemical analysis indicated that the expected chimeric Fab fragments expressing the HIV- 1 epitopes were correctly cloned and expressed in Escherichia coli and retained the binding specificity of the native (hybridoma-derived) MAb. The chimeric Fab fragments targeted the linked HIV- 1 -derived antigenic determinants {{to the surface of}} human APCs in vitro, as evidenced by fluorescence-activated cell sorter analysis. Furthermore, such recombinant immunotargeted HIV- 1 peptide antigens demonstrated improved immunogenicity over equivalent nonimmunotargeted control antigens, as shown by their ability to stimulate interleukin- 2 production by CD 4 + T-helper cells from human donors exposed to HIV- 1 antigens. These data suggest that immunotargeting of recombinant peptide antigens via the attached Fab fragments facilitates uptake by human APCs with subsequent access to the MHC class II processing pathway, thereby validating the immunotargeting concept for such recombinant subunit vaccines in an in vitro human system...|$|E

This process required activation-induced cytidine deaminase (AID) and generated local and circulating IgD-producing plasmablasts reactive to respiratory bacteria. Circulating IgD bound to basophils through a calcium-mobilizing receptor that induced antimicrobial, opsonizing, inflammatory and B cell-stimulating factors, including cathelicidin, interleukin 1 (IL- 1), IL- 4 and B cell-activating factor (BAFF), after IgD crosslinking. By showing dysregulation of IgD class-switched B cells and 'IgD-armed' basophils in autoinflammatory syndromes with periodic fever, our data indicate that IgD orchestrates an ancestral surveillance system at the interface between immunity and inflammation...|$|E
40|$|The {{hyperimmunoglobulinemia}} D syndrome (HIDS) is an {{autosomal recessive}} disorder characterized by recurrent febrile attacks with abdominal, articular, and skin manifestations. Apart from elevated <b>immunoglobulin</b> <b>D</b> (IgD) levels (> 100 IU/ml), there are high IgA {{levels in the}} majority of cases. Mutations in the gene encoding mevalonate kinase constitute the molecular defect in HIDS. The cause of elevated IgA concentrations in HIDS patients remains to be elucidated. We studied the hyper-IgA response in serum of a group of HIDS patients. Elevated IgA concentrations result from increased IgA 1 concentrations. IgA and IgA 1 concentrations correlated significantly with IgD concentrations, and levels of IgA polymers were significantly higher than the levels in healthy donors.

We report here on the application of this method with a Fab domain directed against the major human rhinovirus receptor, intercellular adhesion molecule 1 (ICAM- 1). Multivalent anti-ICAM- 1 molecules were produced in bacteria and purified as soluble preassembled homogeneous proteins at high yield. These proteins successfully blocked rhinovirus infection in vitro, with the efficiency increasing from monomer to dimer, trimer, and tetramer.

40|$|Receptors for {{immunoglobulins}} {{on animal}} cells invariably show specificity for Fc {{regions of the}} protein and are hence called Fc receptors. The present study shows that <b>immunoglobulin</b> <b>D</b> receptors present an exception to this rule. Binding of IgD-coated erythrocytes to murine IgD-receptor-bearing T-helper cells is competitively inhibited by IgD, by its Fab delta fragments, and by deletion mutants of IgD lacking (i) the first constant domain of the delta heavy chain (KWD 1), (ii) that region plus the delta heavy-chain-hinge region (KWD 6), or (iii) the third constant domain of the delta heavy chain (Gen. 24). KWD 1, Gen. 24, or KWD 6 mutants bind to T-helper cells bearing receptors for IgD independently of each other. Furthermore, Gen. 24 and KWD 6 mutants also competitively inhibit binding {{of each other in}} cross-blocking experiments.

40|$|Prototypical class {{switching}} in mouse and human immunoglobulin heavy chains occurs through recombination of tandem blocks of short repeats located 5 ' to each heavy chain constant region (CH) except C delta. Deletion of C mu in <b>immunoglobulin</b> <b>D</b> (IgD) -secreting murine plasmacytomas occurs illegitimately. We demonstrate here that in human IgD-secreting myeloma cells freshly isolated from patient bone marrow and in normal peripheral blood B lymphocytes, an IgD switch can occur through homologous recombination {{of a direct}} repeat consisting of a 442 -bp sequence 1. 5 kbp 3 ' of the JH complex and a 443 -bp sequence that is duplicated almost perfectly (96 % similarity) 1. 7 kbp 5 ' of the C delta gene (442 / 443 -base-pair [bp] repeat). This homologous recombination mechanism is not exclusive for IgD switching, since C mu deletion endpoints in two established IgD-secreting myeloma cell lines fall outside the 442 / 443 -bp repeat. The 442 / 443 -bp mediated recombination shows cell type specificity, and we propose that it represents a unique mode for increased levels of IgD secretion in humans...|$|E
40|$|Although most {{immunoglobulin}} {{classes are}} {{represented on the}} surface of thymus-independent (B) lymphocytes 1 and as secreted products, <b>immunoglobulin</b> <b>D</b> (IgD) is expressed principally as a cell-bound molecule (1, 2) and is found on the vast majority of splenic B cells in the adult mouse (3 - 5). 2 This unique status among immunoglobulin classes and the widespread distribution strongly suggest that surface IgD (sIgD) has a critical role in B-cell activation or regulation. Such a role has yet to be demonstrated, however. In this paper we show that sIgD is important in the in vitro primary antibody response to the thymic-independent (T-I) antigen, trinitrophenyl-aminoethylcarbamylmethyl-Ficoll (TNP-AECM-Ficoll). Thus, an alloanti ~ reagent inhibits the primary anti-TNP response to TNP-AECM-Ficoll. By contrast, this reagent has no detectable effect on the anti-TNP response to a second T-I antigen, TNP-BruceUa abortus (TNP-BA).

40|$|Despite {{the role}} of {{secreted}} <b>immunoglobulin</b> <b>D</b> (IgD) remains still largely unknown, previous {{studies have suggested that}} secreted IgD could induce basophils degranulation in some allergic asthma patients. In the present study we have searched direct evidence of the action of IgD on KU 812 cells, generally classified as an immature basophilic cell line. We analyzed by flow cytometry the capacity of IgD, purified from IgD myeloma sera, to bind KU 812 cells. Biotinylated monomeric IgD (mIgD) and biotinylated oligomeric IgD (oIgD) could bind KU 812 cells. Blocking experiments with others immunoglobulin isotypes showed that KU 812 cells expressed an unspecific receptor for IgD. However, oIgD but not mIgD enhances the release of interleukin- 6 (IL- 6) from KU 812 cells. On the other hand, mIgD and oIgD failed to induce histamine release from KU 812 cells or from cord blood derived basophils. Since IL- 6 is known to induce basophil differentiation, we proposed that IgD could be implicated in allergic disorders by stimulating IL- 6 release by prebasophil cells, then IL- 6 could further induce an autocrine maturation of the cells...|$|E
40|$|We {{analyzed}} the regulatory {{basis for the}} lower expression of <b>immunoglobulin</b> <b>D</b> (IgD) in lymphocytes from neonatal mice of various ages.

Similar results were obtained from adult CBA/N mice whose spleens contain a large fraction of cells expressing low levels of IgD. On the other hand, the relative steady state level of mRNA in neonatal lymphocytes is approximately half of that in adults, suggesting that there may be differences in the processing or stability of the nascent transcript.

40|$|The {{marginal}} zone {{of human}} spleens {{is regarded as}} an organ-specific region harbouring sessile memory B cells. This opinion has arisen by extrapolating from results obtained in mice and rats. Detection of CD 27 + B cells in situ now revealed similarities among the most superficial region of B-cell follicles in human spleens, reactive lymph nodes, inflamed appendices, tonsils and terminal ilea. The follicular surface in these organs consists of small naïve <b>immunoglobulin</b> <b>D</b> (IgD) + CD 27 – B cells predominating in an inner area and larger IgD+/– CD 27 + B cells prevailing in a more superficial position. CD 27 + B cells may, however, also occupy the entire follicular periphery around the germinal centre. Together with additional peculiarities this distribution indicates a fundamental microanatomical difference among the human and rodent splenic white pulp. We hypothesize that the follicular periphery represents a recirculation compartment both for naïve and memory/natural reactive B cells in all human secondary lymphatic organs. This assumption implies a difference in recirculation behaviour among human and rodent B memory cells...|$|E
40|$|The {{function}} of <b>immunoglobulin</b> <b>D</b> (IgD) in the immune response {{is not yet}} clear; antibody activity in this immunoglobulin class has not been found as easily as in other classes and, so far, efforts to show a biological activity in IgD such as complement activation or reactivity with skin, mast cells, or neutrophiles have given negative results (1, 2). By contrast IgD {{has been found to}} be present on the membrane of a variable proportion of peripheral blood lymphocytes in human adults (3) and, recently, on a much higher percentage of newborn (cord) blood lymphocytes (4). The investigations to be reported here were performed to study the possible association of IgD with other immunoglobulin classes on the membrane of human lymphocytes and investigate whether IgD might be passively acquired as a cytophilic molecule. Our results show that IgD is usually associated with immunoglobulin M (IgM) on lymphocyte membranes and virtually eliminate the possibility that IgD is acquired by a cytophilic process. These findings provide support for the concept that IgD is a lymphocyte receptor. Materials and Method...|$|E
40|$|A mutant {{lacking the}} ability to express the surface-exposed {{lipoprotein}} protein D was constructed by linker insertion and deletion mutagenesis of a cloned DNA insert containing the protein D structural gene from a nontypeable Haemophilus influenzae strain (NTHi). An isogenic NTHi mutant was isolated after transformation of genetically competent bacteria. The transformant was unreactive to a protein D-specific monoclonal antibody in a colony immunoassay. In addition, the mutant lacked {{the ability to}} synthesize detectable levels of protein D by protein staining, immunoblot methods, glycerophosphodiester phosphodiesterase activity, and binding studies of radiolabelled <b>immunoglobulin</b> <b>D.</b> The isogenic protein D-deficient mutant was compared with its parental strain {{for its ability to}} induce experimental otitis media in rats challenged with bacteria. An approximately 100 -times-higher concentration of the mutant compared with that of the wild-type strain was required in order to cause otitis among all rats challenged with that given dose. The protein D mutant exhibited a generation time that was equal to that of the wild-type strain in complex broth medium. No difference in lipopolysaccharide expression was found between the mutant and the parental strain. These results suggest that protein D may influence the pathogenesis of NTHi in the upper respiratory tract...|$|E
30|$|B {{cells are}} derived from HSCs in the bone marrow and fetal liver. Pre-B cells are {{detectable}} in the fetal liver from week 7 of gestation and in the bone marrow around week 12 [19 – 21]. At the time B cells express immunoglobulin M (IgM) on their surface, they start to migrate from the bone marrow to the peripheral circulation. IgM-positive B cells {{are present in the}} peripheral circulation by week 12 of gestation. Between weeks 10 and 12 of gestation, different immunoglobulin isotypes start to appear in the peripheral circulation: B cells with surface <b>immunoglobulin</b> <b>D</b> (IgD), surface immunoglobulin G (IgG), and surface immunoglobulin A (IgA). During fetal life, the number of B cells increases to adult levels by week 22 of gestation. The amount of plasma cells is low until weeks 18 – 20 of gestation [19]. The fetus is already able to mount an antigen-specific antibody response; however, this response is at a lower intensity compared to that of adults. Neonatal antibody responses depend on the type of antigen, with better responses to proteins compared to polysaccharides. Antibody responses to polysaccharide antigens only reach mature levels after 2  years of age in childhood [22, 23].|$|E
