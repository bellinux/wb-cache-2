5|$|Assigned male at birth, she {{was given}} the name Joshua Alcorn and raised in Ohio by a family {{affiliated}} with the Churches of Christ movement. At age 14, she came out as transgender to her parents, Carla and Doug Alcorn, who refused to accept her female gender identity. When she was 16, they denied her request to undergo transition treatment, instead sending her to Christian-based conversion therapy {{with the intention of}} convincing her to reject her gender identity and accept her <b>gender</b> <b>as</b> assigned at birth. After she revealed her attraction toward males to her classmates, her parents removed her from school and revoked her access to social media. In her suicide note, Alcorn cited loneliness and alienation as key reasons for her decision to end her life and blamed her parents for causing these feelings. She committed suicide by walking out in front of oncoming traffic on the Interstate 71 highway.|$|E
5|$|Before 28 October 2011, the {{succession}} {{order in the}} American Commonwealth realms, {{as well as those}} American territories under the British crown, adhered to male-preference cognatic primogeniture, by which succession passed first to an individual's sons, in order of birth, and subsequently to daughters, again in order of birth. However, {{with the possible exception of}} Canada, following the legislative changes giving effect to the Perth Agreement, succession is by absolute primogeniture for those born after 28 October 2011, whereby the eldest child inherits the throne regardless of <b>gender.</b> <b>As</b> these states share the person of their monarch with other countries, all with legislative independence, the change was implemented only once the necessary legal processes were completed in each realm. Those possessions under the Danish and Dutch crowns already adhere to absolute primogeniture.|$|E

5|$|Clement {{argues for}} the {{equality}} of sexes, {{on the grounds that}} salvation is extended to all of mankind equally. Unusually, he suggests that Christ is neither male or female, and that God the Father has both male and female aspects: the eucharist is described as milk from the breast (Christ) of the Father. He is supportive of women playing {{an active role in the}} leadership of the church, and provides a list of women he considers inspirational, which includes both Biblical and Classical Greek figures. It has been suggested that Clement's progressive views on <b>gender</b> <b>as</b> set out in the Paedagogus were influenced by Gnosticism. However, later in the work, he argues against the Gnostics that faith, not esoteric knowledge , is required for salvation. According to Clement, it is through faith in Christ that we are enlightened and come to know God.|$|E
5|$|North & South is a British {{television}} drama serial, {{produced by}} the BBC and originally broadcast in four episodes on BBC One in November and December 2004.

The family struggles to adjust itself to the industrial town's customs, especially after meeting the Thorntons, a proud family of cotton mill owners who seem to despise their social inferiors. The story explores the issues of class and <b>gender,</b> <b>as</b> Margaret's sympathy for the town mill workers clashes with her growing attraction to John Thornton (Richard Armitage).|$|E
5|$|On {{the outer}} {{fringes of the}} few small gay {{communities}} were people who challenged gender expectations. They were effeminate men and masculine women, or people assigned male at birth who dressed and lived as women and people assigned female at birth who dressed and lived as men, respectively, either part or full-time. Contemporary nomenclature classified them as transvestites, {{and they were the}} most visible representatives of sexual minorities. They belied the carefully crafted image portrayed by the Mattachine Society and DOB that asserted homosexuals were respectable, normal people. The Mattachine and DOB considered the trials of being arrested for wearing clothing of the opposite <b>gender</b> <b>as</b> a parallel to the struggles of homophile organizations: similar but distinctly separate. Gay and transgender people staged a small riot at the Cooper Do-nuts cafe in Los Angeles in 1959 in response to police harassment.|$|E

40|$|This study {{sought to}} empirically {{identify}} and rank the important factors considered by southeast male and female bank customers in bank selection in Nigeria. A sample size of 368 bank customers was drawn from Enugu and Onitsha, major commercial cities in southeast Nigeria.

Statistical differences between the two genders were found for four factors. This study recommends that banks operating in the southeast should treat male and female <b>genders</b> <b>as</b> distinct market segments when crafting marketing strategies aimed at attracting them and emphasis should be on those factors that the potential bank customer considers most important.

40|$|Previous {{research}} has demonstrated that individuals can learn to inhibit category-based stereotypes, but feature-based biases may be harder to control. This study was conducted to determine the impact of gender appearance on perceptions of suitability for stereotypical professions. One hundred forty students from a university in central California indicated their impressions of how suitable 54 men and women were for employment in the medical field, both as a doctor and a nurse. Stimuli were computer-generated faces of nine men and nine women presented in three versions ??? the original, unaltered face, a version manipulated to appear more feminine, and a version manipulated to appear more masculine. It was predicted that perceivers would inhibit categorical-based stereotyping (i. e., rate males and females to be similarly suitable for employment as a doctor and nurse) but demonstrate feature-based stereotyping (i. e., rate feminized faces of both <b>genders</b> <b>as</b> more suitable for employment in nursing and masculinized faces of both <b>genders</b> <b>as</b> more suitable for employment as a doctor). As predicted, participants inhibited category-based stereotypes, but rated feminized faces of both <b>genders</b> <b>as</b> more suitable for nursing. Hypotheses regarding suitability for employment as a doctor were not confirmed: Ratings did not differ by gender appearance for males, and feminized female faces were rated as more suitable than masculinized female faces. A physical attractiveness bias may account for the unexpected results. These findings add to the converging evidence regarding the subtle, yet powerful influence of feature-based stereotyping...|$|R
