The most common defrosting technique is to reverse the cycle. Unfortunately it provokes {{a break in the}} heat production and the <b>defrosting</b> <b>energy</b> is drawn from the heat stock previously constituted. This article presents the design of a heat pump prototype for simultaneous heating and cooling (named HPS). Its refrigeration circuit involves a piece of refrigeration circuit that could be modified and implemented to standard air-source heat pumps during retrofit or maintenance in order to carry out defrosting with better performance. It uses a water tank that recovers the subcooling energy of the refrigerant at first and is subsequently used as a cold source for evaporation. The second part of the sequence liberates the air evaporator for defrosting. Between two evaporators (air-to-refrigerant and water-to-refrigerant) at different temperatures, a thermosiphon forms. A supplementary amount of vapour flows out of the water evaporator and migrates towards the colder inside surface of the air evaporator tubes in thermal contact with the frost layer. The vapour, while condensing, brings the <b>defrosting</b> <b>energy.</b> The liquid returns back to the water evaporator by gravity. This defrosting system was observed by means of infrared thermography and tested experimentally on a heat pump prototype. It proved very efficient as defrosting time was short. Using this defrosting technique ensures: - a continuous heat production with even better performance while defrosting thanks to the higher evaporating temperature, - more frequent defrosting sequences because more easily activated, impacting on lower frost thickness and higher mean heat transfer coefficients. A numerical study was carried out to assess the performance improvement achieved on a heating sequence. Simulations show a COP and an exergetic efficiency improvement respectively of 12 % and 18 %...|$|E
40|$|Abstract: Air/water {{heat pumps}} for heating systems are {{becoming}} increasingly popular. A major challenge for these systems is the formation of ice and frost in the fin-tube evaporator. Defrosting is usually accomplished by the reverse-cycle or hot-gas defrosting technique. In both defrosting modes, the compressor is in operation. An alternative method is ambient-air defrosting, where the heat pump’s compressor is simply turned off and defrosting is achieved by exposure to ambient air, which is conveyed through the fin tube evaporator by the fan. A model has been developed which permits the calculation of the simultaneous heat and mass transfer during the melting of ice and frost deposits. The theoretical results have been validated by numerous defrosting experiments. The theoretical and experimental investigations revealed that both temperature and humidity of the ambient air strongly influence the total heat flow and the time needed for defrosting. Already at an ambient air temperature of 2 °C and a dew point temperature of 0 °C, the heat flow of ambient-air defrosting is {{comparable to that of}} hot-gas defrosting; energy consumption is decreased by a factor of 8 – 10, however. On the other hand, ambient-air defrosting is less effective at air conditions below the extended fog-isotherm at 0 °C. The application of this technique can significantly reduce <b>defrosting</b> <b>energy</b> consumption and improve the overall efficiency of air/water heat pumps...|$|E
40|$|Reverse cycle {{defrosting}} is {{the most}} widely used standard defrosting method for air source heat pump (ASHP) units. It was suggested in previous experimental studies that downwards flowing of the melted frost over a vertical multi-circuit outdoor coil in an ASHP unit has negative effects on reverse cycle defrosting performance. To quantitatively study the negative effects, an experimental study and a modeling study on draining away locally the melted frost for an experimental ASHP unit with a three-circuit outdoor coil were carried out and separately reported. However, for exiting ASHP units, it is hardly possible to install water collecting trays between circuits. To alleviate uneven defrosting for a vertical multi-circuit outdoor coil in an existing ASHP unit, an effective alternative is to vary the heat supply to each refrigerant circuit by varying the opening values of modulating valves installed at an inlet pipe to each circuit. In this paper, a modeling study on varying heat (via refrigerant) supply to each refrigerant circuit in a three-circuit outdoor coil to alleviate uneven defrosting is reported. Finally, in the designed three study cases, <b>defrosting</b> <b>energy</b> use could be decreased to 94. 6 %, as well as a reduction of 7 s in defrosting duration by fully closing the modulating valve on the top circuit when its defrosting terminated.

40|$|This paper {{examines}} defrost performance {{issues associated}} with a finned-tube air chiller, utilised as a heat exchanger in an indirect multi-temperature transport refrigeration system, where a glycol antifreeze mixture is deployed as a secondary working fluid. Two approaches to defrost are examined: a direct electric defrost mode which effects defrost by localised resistance heating of the secondary working fluid; and a hot gas primary circuit, that indirectly heats the secondary working fluid {{by means of a}} primary to secondary heat exchanger. Investigation into the different defrost modes were carried out for chamber set point conditions of - 20, - 12, 0 oC, for a number of defrost rated inputs between 0. 5 and 3. 9 kW. For a unit mass of frost, the duration of defrost was found to be inversely proportional to <b>defrost</b> <b>energy</b> input, however this relation was found to be non-linear. Defrost efficiency was found to decrease with <b>defrost</b> <b>energy</b> input, whereas the required specific total <b>energy</b> for <b>defrost</b> was found to increase with <b>defrost</b> <b>energy</b> input...|$|R

This paper presents the moisture transfer of household refrigerator-freezer during the open and closed door conditions. Experiments were conducted in the controlled chamber to investigate the effects of the different variables on moisture transfer. When the refrigerator-freezer door is opened, the moist warm ambient air enters into the cooler cabinets. The warm moisture gets cool and forms ice. On the other hand, during the defrosting system, the ice is warm up and <b>defrosted.</b> The <b>energy</b> is needed to form ice and defrost ice that is increased the energy consumption of refrigerator-freezer.

40|$|When an {{air source}} heat pump (ASHP) unit {{is used for}} space heating at a low ambient {{temperature}} in winter, frost may be formed on its outdoor coil surface. Over time, frost accumulation on coil surface may become sufficient to restrict air passage through the coil and increase the heat transfer resistance between ambient air and coil surface, leading to performance degradation for the outdoor coil, or even the shutdown of the ASHP unit. Therefore, periodic defrosting is necessary. Currently, the most widely used standard defrosting method for an ASHP unit is reverse cycle defrosting. During a standard reverse cycle defrosting (SRCD) operation, the indoor coil in an ASHP unit actually acts as an evaporator. Because the indoor fan is usually turned off during defrosting, there is an insignificant amount of energy from indoor coil, leading to a number of associated operational problems such as a longer defrosting duration and the risk of having a lower air temperature inside a heated space during defrosting, etc. To solve the fundamental problem of insufficient heat available during defrosting while ensuring the efficient and safe system operation, a novel reverse cycle defrosting (NRCD) method which is thermal energy storage-based using sub-cooling energy of refrigerant for ASHPs has been developed. Comparative experiments using both the SRCD method and the NRCD method were carried out on an experimental ASHP unit with a nominal 2. 5 kW heating capacity. Experimental results clearly suggested that when using the NRCD method, the discharge and suction pressures were increased by 0. 56 and 0. 12 MPa, respectively. Furthermore, the defrosting duration and heating-resumption duration were shortened by 30. 8 % and 25. 0 %, respectively, and the <b>defrosting</b> <b>energy</b> consumption was reduced by 13. 9 %, compared to those when using the SRCD method. Practical application: ASHPs have been widely used worldwide due to their significant energy-saving potentials. However, frost can be formed on the outdoor coil surface when an ASHP unit operates for space heating. Frost accumulation on coil surface reduces the coil's efficiency, or causes even the shutdown of the ASHP unit. Reverse cycle defrosting is the most widely used standard defrosting method. This paper presents the reverse cycle defrosting performance for an ASHP unit with a PCM-HE acting as both a sub-cooler during heating operation and a heat source during defrosting operation, which could help to ensure the safe operation and achieve a higher defrosting efficiency of the ASHP unit.

40|$|This thesis {{consists}} of two different research problems. In the first one, {{the aim is to}} model and simulate a solar-powered, single-effect, absorption refrigeration system using a flat-plate solar collector and LiBr-H 2 O mixture as the working fluid. The cooling capacity and the coefficient of performance of the system are analyzed by varying all independent parameters, namely: evaporator pressure, condenser pressure, mass flow rate, LiBr concentration, and inlet generator temperature. The cooling performance of the system is compared with conventional vapor-compression systems for different refrigerants (R- 134 a, R- 32, and R- 22). The cooling performance is also assessed for a typical year in Tampa, Florida. Higher COP values are obtained for a lower LiBr concentration in the solution. The effects of evaporator and condenser pressures on the cooling capacity and cooling performance are found to be negligible. The LiBr-H 2 O solution shows higher cooling performance compared to other mixtures under the same absorption cooling cycle conditions. For typical year in Tampa, Florida, the model shows a constant coefficient of performance of 0. 94. In the second problem, a numerical model is developed for a typical food retail store refrigeration/HVAC system to study the effects of indoor space conditions on supermarket energy consumption. Refrigerated display cases are normally rated at a store environment of 24 ºC (75 ºF) and a relative humidity of 55 %. If the store can be maintained at lower relative humidity, significant quantities of refrigeration <b>energy,</b> <b>defrost</b> <b>energy</b> and anti-sweat heater energy can be saved. The numerical simulation is performed for a typical day in a standard store for each month of the year using the climate data for Tampa, Florida. This results in a 24 hour variation in the store relative humidity. Using these calculated hourly values of relative humidity for a typical 24 hour day, the store relative humidity distribution is calculated for a full year. The annual average supermarket relative humidity is found to be 51. 1 %. It is shown that for a 5 % reduction in store relative humidity that the display case refrigeration load is reduced by 9. 25 %, and that results in total store energy load reduction of 4. 84 %. The results show good agreement with available experimental data...|$|R
40|$|For a {{space heating}} {{air source heat pump}} (ASHP) unit, when its outdoor coil surface {{temperature}} is below both the air {{dew point temperature}} and the freezing point of water, frost will form on its outdoor coil surface. Frosting affects its operational performance and energy efficiency. Therefore, periodic defrosting is necessary. Currently, the most widely used standard defrosting method for ASHP units is reverse cycle <b>defrost.</b> The <b>energy</b> that should have been used for space heating is used to melt frost, vaporize the melted frost off outdoor coil surface and heat ambient air during defrosting. It is therefore necessary to study the sources of heat supplies and the end-uses of the heat supplied during a reverse cycle defrost operation. In this paper, firstly, an experimental setup is described and experimental procedures are detailed. This is followed by reporting the experimental results and the evaluation of defrosting efficiency for the experimental ASHP unit. Finally, an evaluation of defrosting heat supplies and energy consumptions during a revere cycle defrost operation for the experimental ASHP unit is presented. The experimental and evaluation results indicated that the heat supply from indoor air contributed to 71. 8 % of the total heat supplied for defrosting and 59. 4 % of the supplied energy was used for melting frost. The maximum defrosting efficiency could be up to 60. 1 %. Department of Building Services Engineerin...|$|R
40|$|A heat {{recovery}} ventilator (HRV) {{is used to}} create a balanced ventilation system in residential buildings and as an energy-saving measure. HRVs bring in outside air which is tempered with outgoing stale air, with only the small energy penalty of the blower power to overcome the pressure drop in the HRV. HRVs have been used in cold climates and have often performed poorly due to frosting failure. HRVs require de-icing in cold climate application, where the exhaust warm air is periodically recirculated during defrost cycles, interrupting the flow of the exhausting air and redirecting the stale warm air back into the house, to defrost the HRV core. This study was performed to assess the performance of a motorless air exchanger (MAE), in comparison to a conventional motorized HRV, and determine if it could perform in winter without frosting failure. The parameters that were compared for this study include sensible effectiveness, <b>defrost</b> occurrence and <b>energy</b> consumption.

40|$|Minimization {{of frost}} {{formation}} on the outdoor coils of residential heat pumps and subsequent defrost cycles {{to remove the}} frost in an energy efficient manner remains an active area {{of research and development}} in the HVAC industry. Inverting the cycle to reject heat from the outdoor coils is the most common method to run defrost cycles of the residential heat pumps. However, these <b>defrost</b> cycles are <b>energy</b> intensive. This research proposes a novel method that can substantially reduce the energy consumed in such defrost cycles. The method involves controlled use of reverse air flow on the outdoor coil surface during the defrost cycle, resulting in fewer defrost cycles needed for a given duration of heat pump operation. The method further provides better cleaning of the coil surface by improving the draining of the melted frost. It also allows part of the frost to be removed without the need to melt it. In this research, the proposed methods are evaluated experimentally by simulating the frost formation, and defrost cycle in a controlled environment. Defrost cycles were run with two of the most popular control strategies that are in use, time-based defrost and control-based defrost. Experimental results demonstrate that {{with the use of the}} proposed method, energy savings of 56 % and 31 % are possible for the above- and below-freezing environments respectively, as compared to a baseline that represents the ASHRAE recommended operating conditions...|$|R
40|$|Defrosting in the {{refrigeration}} industry {{is used to}} remove the frost layer accumulated on the evaporators {{after a period of}} running time. It is one way to improve the energy efficiency of refrigeration systems. There are many studies about the defrosting process but none of them use computational fluid dynamics (CFD) simulation. The purpose of this thesis is (1) to develop a defrost model using the commercial CFD solver FLUENT to simulate numerically the melting of frost coupled with the heat and mass transfer taking place during defrosting, and (2) to investigate the thermal response of the evaporator and the defrost time for different hot gas temperatures and frost densities. A 3 D geometry of a finned tube evaporator is developed and meshed using Gambit 2. 4. 6, while numerical computations were conducted using FLUENT 12. 1. The solidification and melting model is used to simulate the melting of frost and the Volume of Fluid (VOF) model is used to render the surface between the frost and melted frost during defrosting. A user-defined-function in C programming language was written to model the frost evaporation and sublimation taking place on the free surface between frost and air. The model was run under different hot gas temperatures and frost densities and the results were analyzed to show the effects of these parameters on <b>defrosting</b> time, input <b>energy</b> and stored energy in the metal mass of the evaporator. The analyses demonstrate that an optimal hot gas temperature can be identified so that the defrosting process takes place at the shortest possible melting time and with the lowest possible input energy...|$|R
40|$|Frost {{formation}} in heat/energy exchangers is undesirable {{because it may}} reduce air flow through the exchanger, increase the power consumption of fans, decrease {{the effectiveness of the}} exchanger, and in extreme cases, cause physical damage to the exchanger. Frosting is more critical in regions with arctic weather conditions, such as Canada and Northern Europe. Membrane-based energy exchangers are believed to be an important step towards frost free exchangers; however, {{at the beginning of this}} PhD study, there was no data available in the open literature documenting frosting in membrane energy exchangers. Therefore, the main goal of this PhD work is to determine if membrane energy exchangers are less susceptible to frosting than conventional heat exchangers. In this thesis, an in-depth study between conventional cross-flow air-to-air heat exchangers and membrane energy exchangers is conducted to (1) quantify the frosting limit; the operating conditions at which frost first begins in an exchanger, (2) develop a theoretical model to predict the frosting limit, and (3) quantify the energy impact of frosting and <b>defrosting</b> cycles on <b>energy</b> recovery. To meet these objectives, a test facility to test exchangers under frosting and defrosting cycles is developed and different strategies to detect frosting inside the exchangers are investigated. For the first time in the literature, it is shown that the temperature profile at the exhaust outlet can be used as a reliable and quick method to detect frosting. The frosting limit temperature of the energy exchanger is found to be 5 ℃ to 10 ℃ lower than the frosting limit of the heat exchanger under the same air flow rate and exhaust air relative humidity. Testing the exchangers under both frosting and defrosting conditions shows that the frost accumulation rate is nearly linear with time, while the frost removal rate decreases exponentially with time. Moreover, the frosting rate in the heat exchanger is found to be three times higher than that of the energy exchanger. A theoretical model to predict the frosting limit using the design parameters of the exchangers and the operating conditions is developed. The model is verified with experiments. Both the experimental and theoretical results show that the indoor air moisture content and the outdoor air temperature have significant effects on the frosting limit. Finally, a method to calculate the energy impact of frosting is introduced. Comparison between different frost control strategies in exchangers shows that frost prevention is preferred over repeated cycle of frosting followed by defrosting...|$|R
40|$|A {{method is}} {{described}} for fabricating controlled micro-scale, topographical features on aluminum surfaces {{for the purpose}} of exploiting those features to affect the surface wettability. Using a photolithographic approach, a photoresist-masked surface is subjected to a plasma etch in a mixture of gaseous BCl 3 and Cl 2. Parallel grooves, microns to tens of microns in width, depth and spacing are studied, because this geometry is scaleable for mass production by roll-to-roll micro-embossing, and because the anisotropic nature of these features provides a directional change in wettability that can reduce the retention of water on the surface. Aluminum was studied because it is naturally hydrophilic and widely used in wet-surface heat exchanger applications, because of its low cost and excellent mechanical and thermal properties. Water droplets placed on a micro-grooved aluminum surface using a micro-syringe exhibit significantly increased apparent contact angles, and for water condensed onto an inclined, micro-grooved surface, the droplet volume at incipient sliding is reduced by more than 50 % compared to droplets on a surface without micro-grooves. No chemical surface treatment is necessary to achieve this water repellency; it is accomplished solely through the anisotropic surface topography. The droplet geometry shows an elongated base contour relative to a surface without micro-grooves, and discontinuities in the three-phase contact line are also introduced by the grooves. A mechanistic model is presented for predicting the critical droplet size on micro-grooved surfaces. This model extends earlier work by accounting for the droplet geometry and contact-line changes caused by the micro-grooves. The model is validated through comparisons of predicted to measured critical droplet sizes, and it is then used to provide guidance for the development of surfaces with enhanced water drainage behavior. In a broad range of air-cooling applications, water retention on the air-side surface of metallic heat exchangers is problematic, because it can reduce the air-side heat transfer coefficient, increase core pressure drop, and provide a site for biological activity. In refrigeration systems, the accumulation of frost on metallic fins requires periodic <b>defrosting</b> and reduces <b>energy</b> efficiency. When water is retained on these surfaces following the defrost cycle, ice is more readily formed in the subsequent cooling period, and such ice can lead to shorter operation times before the next defrost is required. Thus the management and control of water droplets on heat-transfer and airhandling surfaces is vital to energy efficiency, functionality, and maintenance in air-cooling systems. The microstructured surfaces introduced in this work are proposed for use in air-cooling and dehumidifying applications, but they may have other applications where the management of liquids on a surface is important.

40|$|The {{capacities}} of performance improvements of low and mid-size heat pumps are studied in this project. For the new buildings market, {{the components of}} the heat pump match already well the requirements for high performance and monovalent heating. Minor improvements are to be expected on inverter driven compressors and on the integration of the domestic water in the heat pump cycle. This study is focused on the retrofit market (replacement of existing oil burners). For this case the existing air-water heat pumps are not economical and performance decrease rapidly at low air temperatures. A two-stage heat pump with two phase injection and an economiser vessel has been built in collaboration with Termogamma. It has been compared to a single-stage configuration (Pompe à chaleur biétagée à haute performance, Phase I). The measurements at steady state conditions show significant improvements on heat output and coefficient of performance for the refrigerants R 22 and R 407 C. In phase 2 of this project the tests are focused on a new <b>defrosting</b> scheme using <b>energy</b> stored at low exergy in the economiser. This method is compared to the reversed cycle defrosting at critical conditions A 2 /W 50 / 93 r. h. Both defrosting methods have equivalent performance reduction. Relative heat output reduction is - 12 % COP is reduced by - 4 % comparing to the steady state conditions (evaporator not frosted). Combining the two methods, reversed cycle and economiser, the overall performances are further improved (heat output - 7 % and COP - 3 %). The complete cycle length was limited by oil migration effects. The mechanisms of oil migration in two-stage heat pumps will be examined in a starting project at the Laboratory for Industrial Energy Systems (LENI). Several types of refrigerants are compared in the single-stage and two-stage case by simulation. The simulation includes real compressor and exchanger characteristics. The results show the important decrease of the coefficient of performance and the reduction of the heat output at low air temperatures. At higher temperatures the single stage mode is more adapted for the existing compressors. COP crossing occurs between 0 °C and 5 °C external air temperature. For the retrofit application, traditional heat pump design cannot be explored efficiently in the case of monovalent heating. This two stage concept is very promising, but oil migration problems have to be solved for commercialisation. The refrigerant cycle can be simplified, according to the refrigerant type used. The economiser did not show the expected improvement for the defrosting cycle. The major part of the energy potential could not be explored in the tests. For an air-air heat pump the increased refrigerant charge can be justified with the important improvements on the defrosting (only hot gas defrosting can be implemented in this case) ...|$|R
