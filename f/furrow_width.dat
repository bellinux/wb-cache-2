Soil erosion and sediment yield in furrow irrigation {{has not been}} fully evaluated in Samaru-Zaria. This study sought to establish {{the interactive effects of}} irrigation stream sizes (2. 5, 1. 5, and 0. 5 l/s); furrow lengths (90 and 45 m); and <b>furrow</b> <b>widths</b> (0. 75 and 0. 9 m) randomized in a split-plot design on soil erosion, growth, and yield of maize (Zea mays L.). The 90 - and 4 -m long furrows were herein referred to as long and short furrows respectively, while the 0. 75 - and 0. 9 -wide furrows were termed narrow and wide furrows for convenience sake. The field experiment involved irrigating maize on the normal straight furrow irrigation method on a sandy loam soil in the Irrigation Research Farm of Institute for Agricultural Research (I. A. R), Samaru-Zaria, in 2009 / 2010 and 2010 / 2011 dry irrigation seasons. Maize plants irrigated at 2. 5 l/s on long narrow furrows were most stunted (118. 396 m) while irrigating at 1. 5 l/s in long wide furrows produced tallest maize plants (169. 034 m). Irrigating at 2. 5 l/s in long narrow furrows delayed days to 50 % tasseling (77. 632 days) and days to 50 % plant maturity (79. 125 days). Highest average sediment concentration (41. 697 g/l) and runoff volume (147. 861 ltr) were recorded in short narrow furrows irrigated at 2. 5 l/s. The long narrow furrows irrigated at 2. 5 l/s produced largest soil erosion (0. 603 t/ha). Best grain yield (5. 19 t/ha) was achieved in long wide furrows irrigated at 1. 5 l/s. The severity of soil erosion and its impact on crop production were greater in long narrow furrow irrigated at 2. 5 l/s. Irrigation at 1. 5 l/s in long wide furrows trimmed down soil erosion and better maize growth and yields. Furrow irrigation should be designed and operated professionally to avert ecological deterioration, and sustain soil’s quality and crop productivity...|$|R

The natural forest area is approximately 4. 8 million hectares and for the near future there will be a need to increase the planted area. To avoid or minimize the impact of mechanized practices on forest soils, the reduced tillage has been developed. The aim of this work is to define the technical priorities of the reduced tillage for eucalyptus seedlings, using quality function deployment (QDF).

Speculation about how the stones move started at this time. Various and sometimes idiosyncratic possible explanations have been put forward {{over the years that}} have ranged from the supernatural to the very complex. Most hypotheses favored by interested geologists posit that strong winds when the mud is wet are at least in part responsible. Some stones weigh as much as a human, which some researchers, such as geologist George M. Stanley, who published a paper on the topic in 1955, feel is too heavy for the area's winds to move. After extensive track mapping and research on rotation of the tracks in relation to ice floe rotation, Stanley maintained that ice sheets around the stones either help to catch the wind or that ice floes initiate rock movement.|$|R
40|$|An {{automatic}} contour tracking {{procedure is}} illustrated over sequences of x-ray and echo images.

Once the contour is determined on the first image it is used as starting contour to determine the contour on the subsequent image and so on. Therefore, when an approximate starting contour is given on the first image, every contour of the sequence is automatically outlined.

40|$|Numerical {{simulations}} {{were performed}} to study two-dimensional infiltration from furrows. The simulations were carried out using the models SWMS_ 2 D, HYDRUS- 2 D and HYDRUS- 1 D. The first model {{was used to evaluate}} the individual effect of soil and furrow parameters on cumulative infiltration and deep seepage. Cumulative infiltration was found to be more sensitive to saturated hydraulic conductivity, wetted perimeter and furrow spacing than the other parameters for relatively long times, while cumulative deep seepage was more sensitive to the same parameters except to the furrow spacing. It was verified that two-dimensional cumulative infiltration can be approximated using one-dimensional models, for example HYDRUS- 1 D, by combining the vertical and horizontal infiltrations. The two-dimensional cumulative infiltration is underpredicted by no more than 35 % using this calculation. When steady state is reached the steady infiltration rate may be linearly related to the depth of the furrow. As a result, steady infiltration rate is dependent only on type of soil, water depth in the furrow and <b>furrow</b> <b>width.</b> Broocks-Corey soil hydraulic parameters were matched to the van Genuchten parameters by four different procedures. The method based on matching sorptivities produced the closest results to the van Genuchten solution for one- and two-dimensional cumulative infiltration.

40|$|Brazilian {{family farming}} has at its {{disposal}} planters whose furrowing mechanisms, whether disc or shank, require a large vertical force. In smaller planters, this is reflected in low efficiency when opening the furrow or in a high demand for mass (weight). Rotary furrowers require less vertical force for the same operation. This study aimed to evaluate the technical feasibility and performance of rotary furrowers mounted on the powertrain of a walking tractor working under direct seeding, and compare them with shank-type furrowers using bibliographic data. The parameters used in the comparison were the depth and width of the furrow, the area of disturbed soil and the cross-sectional area of the furrow with no soil after the operation. The experiment was carried out on wheat stubble that had lain fallow for six months. Twelve treatments were employed in a factorial design: three models of rotary furrowers, two values for revolutions per unit of linear displacement, and two forward speeds. The variable, cross-sectional area of the furrow with no soil, was statistically affected only by the factor, furrower. However there was significant interaction between the factors, furrower, revolutions per metre and speed, for the variables of depth, <b>furrow</b> <b>width</b> and area of disturbed soil.

The size of ridge is with the height of 20 cm and the width of 35 ? 40 cm, and the <b>furrow</b> <b>width</b> is 40 ? 45 cm.

40|$|Introduction Direct {{planting}} {{becomes more}} common in the recent years, because it conserves soil and water as well as it saves energy and time. However, this technology needs special implements such as seed planter. Given that direct planting is practiced in undisturbed lands, so it was needed to design a special furrow opener. In order to obtain a suitable furrow opener this experiment was conducted in rain-fed Agricultural Research Institute in Maragheh. Materials and Methods Most of seed planters that are used for cultivation in rain fed conditions are equipped by hoe-type furrow opener. Hoe-type furrow openers have good penetration in hard and dry soils. However, {{they do not have the}} ability for direct planting. Hoe-type furrow opener was chosen as a model. Then by changing the geometric form of the depth to width ratio (d/w), the two openers were designed. In the first design, which was called O 1 two wings and a narrow blade acting as a coulter were added in front of the hoe-type furrow opener. In the second design, which was called O 2, in addition to the O 1 modification, <b>furrow</b> opener <b>width</b> was decreased and a disk blade was added for seed sowing (Fig. 1). The performance of O 1 and O 2 openers were compared with the conventional hoe-type furrow opener (check) in soil bin and in field conditions. At three different forward speeds (1, 1. 5 and 2 m. s- 1) with 3 replications, the effects of the openers designs of vertical and horizontal soil forces were evaluated in soil-bin conditions. In order to evaluate the performance of the furrow opener in field conditions, an experiment was conducted using a split plot design based on RCBD at 4 replications. Furrow openers formed the main plots and forward speeds formed the sub plots. Each plot size was 22 meters long in two rows for each treatment. After germination of wheat crop, the numbers of seedlings in two rows were counted (along a one meter). After crop maturity, all plots were harvested by hand and grain and biological yield was measured. ANOVA test, uniformity test and mean comparison were conducted by using Genstat software. Results and Discussion The soil bin test results showed that opener design and forward speed both have significant influences on the horizontal force (p< 0. 01). Horizontal force was increased with increasing of forward speeds. The same result was reported by Wheeler and Godwin, 1996 and Astafford, 1979. The lowest horizontal force (average 1. 66 kN) occurred at 1 m. s- 1 and the highest (average 1. 94 kN) occurred at 2 m. s- 1 forward speeds. Horizontal force increased in O 2 (2. 8...|$|R
40|$|Several studies {{carried out}} in long furrows have shown that surge flow {{irrigation}} offers the potential of increasing the efficiency of irrigation. The effects of surge flow in short fields, such as in Egypt, are still not well known, however. To investigate the effect of surge flow irrigation in short fields a series of experiments {{have been carried out}} at two different locations in Egypt. The first location with a clay soil was situated at the Agriculture Experimental Station, Assiut University, Assiut. The second location with a sandy soil was situated at the Assiut University Experimental Station for Desert Land, El-Wadi El-Assuity, Assiut. The blocked end <b>furrow</b> lengths and <b>widths</b> were 70 and 0. 70 m respectively. Three discharges were selected for each soil type, namely 0. 46, 0. 74 and 0. 90 l s- 1 for clay soil and 0. 73, 1. 0 and 1. 4 l s- 1 for sandy soil. For each discharge two cycle times were investigated, namely 16 and 24 minutes. For each cycle time three cycle ratios were chosen, 1 / 4, 1 / 2 and 3 / 4 for the 16 -minute and 1 / 3, 1 / 2, and 2 / 3 for the 24 -minute cycle time. The water content was measured at three locations, namely at the beginning, middle and end of the furrow. In each location three points were measured in a vertical line at a depth of 0 - 0. 1, 0. 1 - 0. 3 and 0. 3 - 0. 7 m. The results show that surge flow irrigation leads to a more uniform water distribution along the furrows than continuous flow. This uniformity is more pronounced in clay soil than in sandy soil. Surge flow irrigation decreases the advance time in comparison to continuous flow. The reduction in advance time was more pronounced with the discharges of 0. 74 and 1. 0 l s- 1 in clay and sandy soil respectively. The 24 -minute cycle time is better than the 16 -minute cycle time. The reduction in advance time with a cycle time of 24 minutes is due to the effect of the off-time. Different cycle ratios can be used but the 1 / 3 cycle ratio may be the best. In conclusion, surge flow irrigation under the short field conditions as prevailing in Egypt decreases the advance time, increases uniformity and efficiency by decreasing deep percolation and reduces applied water volume by 15 - 35...|$|R

The study was conducted {{on a farm in}} Santa Maria (Brazil/RS), in soil classified as sandy loam Ultisol. The experiment consisted of 24 combinations of treatments with three replications in a 2 × 3 × 4 factorial experiment. The combinations were formed by the interaction of the factors including: two types of furrow openers (hoe and double-disc), three types of coulters (no-coulter, smooth and offset fluted) and four levels of forward speed (1. 11, 1. 67, 2. 22 and 2. 78 m/s). Soil elevation and soil disturbance area profiles were obtained {{with the use of a}} micro profilometer, and disturbance values were calculated with the aid of computer software program Auto Cad. The disturbance area was not affected by speed; it was greater when using the hoe opener, and in association with the offset fluted coulter. Speed was inversely proportional to the depth of the furrows made by the hoe opener. Furthermore, the hoe caused the greatest <b>furrow</b> <b>width</b> (0. 26 m) in comparison with the double-disc (0. 24 m). The use of different coulters associated with furrow openers increased this variable (0. 23 m for the no-coulter condition, 0. 25 m with smooth and 0. 26 m with offset fluted).

40|$|Detailed {{examination}} and description of structures in nature, {{relative to the}} environments in which they occur, provides evidence for the function of these structures. Here I describe the oberhautchen (outer skin surface) of 24 species of Australian carphodactyline (Squamata: Carphodactylidae) and diplodactyline gecko (Squamata: Diplodactylidae). Using methods specially adapted for the purpose, I describe details of skin microornamentations, examined at high magnification, of these geckos, and examine relationships between these skin characteristics and environmental conditions, substrate use, hydrophobic properties, and evaporative water loss (EWL), {{with a view to}} determining the function of these features. I used 24 species (and populations therein) of geckos collected from northern and western Queensland, and from the Great Victoria Desert, South Australia, as subjects for my descriptions. To examine the oberhautchen of living lizards, I adapted and tested a method for creating extremely detailed moulds of surfaces using polyvinylsiloxane impression material and epoxy resin (Epirez 123 ®, ITW Polymers & Fluids). This method produces exceptional quality reproductions of complex microornamentations within the oberhautchen of living lizards. Using scanning electron microscopy on the moulds I created, I examined scale characteristics (primary scale size, secondary scale size, spinule length and density, pit diameter and density, <b>furrow</b> <b>width</b> and depth, percentage of knobs covering scales, and hair sensor characteristics including hair sensors per scale, hair sensors per square millimeter, bristles per sensor, bristles per square millimeter, and hair sensor diameter), I related these to body size, substrate use, environmental conditions at the centre of each species’ geographic range, and phylogeny, using univariate statistics and canonical discriminant function analysis. Carphodactyline geckos are quite different from diplodactyline geckos, and have larger body size, larger primary scales, shorter spinules, greater numbers of hair sensors and bristles per square millimeter, knobs and larger hair sensor diameters. Examining both carphodactyline and diplodactylines together, I found that terrestrial geckos tend to be smaller, live in xeric conditions, and usually have smaller scales and higher numbers of bristles and hair sensors per square millimeter. Nonterrestrial geckos tend to be larger, and live in more mesic and hydric conditions, and usually have larger scales and fewer hair sensors and bristles per square millimeter. Because geckos in xeric habitats live in dry conditions, they may need more sensory information about their environment, to enable them to select appropriate shelter. I traced the character evolution of hair sensor bristle shape, and found that bottlebrush-shaped hair sensors with many hairs appear to be primitive, whereas tapered hair sensors of various shapes with fewer hairs appear to be derived. The causes of evolutionary differences in bristle shape and hair sensor number was not clear from the variables I examined. Hydrophobicity is thought to enhance the adhesiveness of geckos with adhesive toe pads, by keeping these surfaces clean. Because specialized adhesive foot scales are evolutionarily derived from the body scales, I examined the hydrophobic properties of body scales. To estimate hydrophobicity, I used a sessile drop technique to quantify contact angles of droplets of distilled water. Tiny (0. 25 μL) droplets of distilled water were incrementally increased in size and photographed at high resolution, and contact angles of droplets were used to predict the hydrophobic properties of the dorsal skin surface of geckos. I established which species were most hydrophobic and which dorsal scale characteristics had the strongest relationships with hydrophobic properties. Several species had superhydrophobic skin (advancing contact angles greater than 150 °), including Lucasium damaeum, Strophurus taeniatus, Diplodactylus conspicillatus (Winton population), Oedura rhombifer, and Lucasium steindachneri. Geckos with high hydrophobicity were characterized by skin characteristics that promoted rough surface adaptation, especially small primary scales and long spinules. The great range of variation in gecko oberhautchen is likely to have some functional significance. However, most functions suggested in the literature (ecdysis, coping with varying temperatures on different parts of the body, pheromone capture, retention, and dispersal, the creation or reduction of friction, the reflection or channeling of solar radiation, wear prevention) can be rejected as explanations for variation in the oberhautchen of Australian gecko skin. I provide evidence that high hydrophobic properties of the skin help geckos remain clean. Hydrophobicity was, on average, higher in terrestrial species and in species living closer to the ground (and hence, likely to come into contact with dust and dirt), than in non-terrestrial species living away from the ground. Terrestrial geckos, as a group, had longer spinules and smaller scales than saxicolous and arboreal geckos, enhancing their hydrophobic properties. With the effects of phylogeny removed hydrophobicity was related to distance from the ground, indicating that these two characters evolve together. Recent studies have linked evaporative water loss rates with scale characteristics of reptiles. I measured the EWL of Australian geckos gravimetrically, using the flow-through chamber technique, to examine patterns in water loss rates of Australian geckos in relation to scale characteristics, body size and habitat. Evaporative water loss was strongly correlated with body size, larger geckos had larger body surface area and lost more water than smaller geckos. Mass-specific water loss rates were correlated with habitat use; terrestrial species lost more water than arboreal and saxicolous species, which did not differ in their water loss. In addition, species with larger scales tended to have lower water loss rates, and the evolution of deeper scale furrows was correlated with the evolution of higher EWL. In summary, my work provides evidence that, not only are variations in Australian gecko skin morphology influenced by phylogenetic relationships, but at least some characters appear to have functional significance. Xeric-dwelling, terrestrial geckos have more sensory organs than do non-terrestrial mesic and hydric-dwelling geckos, likely because they require accurate information on environmental conditions. Terrestrial geckos tended to have smaller scales and longer spinules than non-terrestrial geckos, possibly to enhance their hydrophobicity. Terrestrial geckos also had higher EWL rates than saxicolous and arboreal geckos, but may be able to avoid high water loss by using burrows as shelter. Finally, terrestrial and xeric dwelling species tended to be smaller than non-terrestrial mesic and hydric dwelling species...|$|E
