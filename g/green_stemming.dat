50|$|Gongura {{comes in}} two varieties, <b>green</b> <b>stemmed</b> leaf and red stemmed. The red stemmed variety is more sour than the <b>green</b> <b>stemmed</b> variety. Gongura is {{popular in the}} state of Andhra Pradesh, Telangana, Karnataka, Manipur, Tripura and also Mizoram. A baby gongura leaf is a full leaf. As the leaf grows older, the leaf splits into four or more parts.|$|R

40|$|The ratio between area of <b>green</b> {{leaves and}} <b>stem</b> area for model {{photosynthetic}} plants of 23 Euphorbia L. species were determined. On {{the base of}} this ratio studied species were divided onto three groups: a) leaf surface area exceeds area of <b>green</b> <b>stems</b> more than in twice; b) leaf surface area exceeds area of <b>green</b> <b>stems</b> less than in twice; c) area of <b>green</b> <b>stems</b> exceeds leaf surface area more than in twice. Correlation between these groups and arid degree of native habitats of investigated species has been ascertained. It was established that current grouping method is more objective in sense of morphological characteristic stem-succulent representatives from the genus Euphorbia in context of their ecological specifications than simple statement of leaves presence and photosynthetic activity of the stem...|$|R

40|$|In {{the present}} study, total {{chlorophyll}} a, chlorophyll b, carotenoids, anthocyanin, carbohydrate, phenolic constituents, antioxidant activity and root formation percentage of MM 106 apple rootstock in etiolated and <b>green</b> <b>stem</b> cuttings were investigated.

50|$|Cleistocactus samaipatanus is {{a species}} in the cactus family with long, narrow {{columnar}} <b>green</b> <b>stems</b> and pale gold spines native to South America. It grows vigorously with large, pinky-red flowers.|$|R
40|$|Red-stemmed {{plants are}} {{extremely}} common, yet {{the functions of}} cauline anthocyanins are largely unknown. The possibility that photoabatement by anthocyanins in the periderm reduces the propensity for photoinhibition in cortical chlorenchyma was tested for Cornus stolonifera. Anthocyanins were induced in <b>green</b> <b>stems</b> exposed to full sunlight. PSII quantum yields (ФPSII) and photochemical quenching coefficients were depressed less in red than in <b>green</b> <b>stems,</b> both under a light ramp and after prolonged exposures to saturating white light. These differences were primarily attributable to the attenuation of PAR, especially green/yellow light, by anthocyanins. However, the red internodes also had less chlorophyll and higher carotenoid:chlorophyll ratios than the green, and when the anthocyanic periderm was removed, small differences in the ФPSII of the underlying chlorenchyma were retained. Thus, light screening by cauline anthocyanins is important, but {{is only part of}} a set of protective acclimations to high irradiance. Hourly measurements of ФPSII on established trees under natural daylight indicated a possible advantage of red versus <b>green</b> <b>stems</b> under sub-saturating diffuse, but not direct sunlight. To judge the wider applicability of the hypothesis, responses to high light were compared for red and <b>green</b> <b>stems</b> across five further unrelated species. There was a strong, linear, interspecific correlation between photoprotective advantage and anthocyanin concentration differences among red and green internodes. The photoprotective effect appears to be a widespread phenomenon...|$|R
5000|$|Collinsia greenei is {{an annual}} herb {{producing}} a very glandular-hairy purple-tinted <b>green</b> <b>stem</b> {{up to about}} 30 centimeters tall. The oppositely arranged leaves may be toothed or smooth on the edges.|$|R
40|$|Soybean growers {{this fall}} may have {{problems}} with <b>green</b> <b>stem</b> and mottled seed. Many of the problems {{may be caused by}} bean pod mottle virus (BPMV) or soybean mosaic virus (SMV). Both viruses cause the same leaf symptoms, <b>green</b> <b>stem</b> in the fall, and mottled seed coats. BPMV is transmitted primarily by bean leaf beetle; SMV is transmitted by at least 30 aphid species, including the newly introduced soybean aphid. Many soybean cultivars do not display obvious symptoms, and there is no positive correlation between severity of leaf symptoms and amount of seed coat mottling on fall-harvested seed...|$|R
50|$|Typical soybean foliage {{symptoms}} of BPMV include leaf mottling (if present), {{which is the}} appearance of yellow and green blotches on the leaf as well as leaf rugosity. Symptoms vary between different host species and virus strains. Mottling can be seen more severely on younger leaves with a distorted or blistery appearance. In stressful conditions such as hot weather and during the reproductive stages there are less symptoms. BPMV {{may also be a}} cause of <b>green</b> <b>stem</b> syndrome resulting in <b>green</b> <b>stems</b> and leaves while the pods and rest of the field has matured. Seed infected with BPMV can be discolored or mottled.|$|R
