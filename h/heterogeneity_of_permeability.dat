40|$|<b>Heterogeneity</b> <b>of</b> <b>permeability</b> is an {{important}} factor affecting the production of a carbonate reservoir. How to correctly characterize the <b>heterogeneity</b> <b>of</b> <b>permeability</b> has become a key issue for carbonate reservoir development. In this study, the reservoirs were categorized into four superimposed modes based on the actual logging data from a super-giant heterogeneous carbonate reservoir in the Middle East. A modified permeability formula in terms of the variogram method was presented to reflect the heterogeneity of the reservoirs. Furthermore, the models of oil production and water cut were established and the analytical solutions were obtained. The calculation results show that the present model can predict the productivity of wells with different heterogeneous layers more accurately and rapidly. The larger the varigoram value, the stronger the heterogeneity of the reservoirs, and the faster the decline of production owing to a quicker reduction of formation pressure. With the increase in variogram value, the relative permeability of the oil phase is smaller and the water phase larger, and the water cut becomes larger. This study has provided a quick and reasonable prediction model for heterogeneous reservoir...|$|E
40|$|The {{effect of}} {{vertical}} <b>heterogeneity</b> <b>of</b> <b>permeability</b> on the onset convection in a horizontal layer of magnetized ferrofluid-saturated Darcy porous medium is investigated. Four {{different forms of}} vertical heterogeneity permeability function (Formula presented.) are considered for discussion. The eigenvalue problem is solved numerically using the Galerkin method for three types of temperature boundary conditions namely, (i) isothermal, (ii) insulated to temperature perturbations, and (iii) lower insulated to temperature perturbations and upper isothermal. The general quadratic variation in the vertical <b>heterogeneity</b> <b>of</b> <b>permeability</b> is to hasten the onset of ferromagnetic convection compared with other forms of (Formula presented.). The measure of nonlinearity of magnetization and the magnetic susceptibility is found to influence the onset if the boundaries are either isothermal or lower insulated and upper isothermal. Increasing the magnetic number is to augment the onset of ferromagnetic convection. The system is more stabilizing when the boundaries are isothermal and least stable for insulated ones. Compared to the homogeneous porous medium case, the critical wave number is higher if the permeability of the porous medium is heterogeneous and the boundaries are isothermal.

The eigenvalue problem is solved numerically using the Galerkin method. The interaction of various types of permeability heterogeneity and non-uniform basic temperature gradient functions on the stability characteristics {{of the system is}} analyzed. It is observed that the linear variation (about the mean) of the permeability and the basic temperature gradient with depth has no added effect on the criterion for the onset of convection. However, the concurrent variation in heterogeneous permeability and non-uniform basic temperature gradient functions has more stabilizing effect on the system, while opposite is the trend when the effect of non-uniform basic temperature gradient alone is present.

30|$|Compared with {{conventional}} low-permeability sandstone reservoirs with permeabilities being 10 – 50  md, the tight gas sandstone reservoirs of Xujiahe Formation {{in the western}} Sichuan Foreland Basin have a greater heterogeneity, which {{can be divided into}} macro- and micro-heterogeneity. The macro-heterogeneity is mainly caused by sedimentation, and contains heterogeneity between layers, in the single layer and in the plane, shown as the varying of petrographic composition, grain size, sorting, sedimentary structure, rhythm, and the diversity of connectivity in the plane. Micro-heterogeneity is mainly caused by diagenesis, and often refers to the variation of pore type, pore throat size, and pore structure. Furthermore, the existence of fractures is a very important factor causing the <b>heterogeneity</b> <b>of</b> <b>permeability</b> in the tight gas sandstones. Because of the difference of development degree, apertures, and connectivity of different oriented fractures under the influence of current- and palaeo-stress field, the permeability of different oriented fractures varies greatly. For example, according to the calculation result by the Monte Carlo method, the permeability of the NW–SE, NE–SW, E–W, and N–S oriented fractures is, respectively, 43.4, 15.0, 11.6, and 10.4  md. The NW–SE oriented fractures which are parallel to the maximum principal stress direction of current stress field have the biggest permeability, and are the dominant seepage channels of the study area.|$|E
40|$|Mapping the {{horizontal}} distribution of permeability {{is a key}} problem for the coal seam gas industry. Poststack seismic data with anisotropy attributes provide estimates for fracture density and orientation which are then interpreted in terms of permeability. This approach delivers an indirect measure of permeability and can fail if other sources of anisotropy (for instance stress) come into play. Seismo-electric methods, based on recording the electric signal from pore fluid movements stimulated through a seismic wave, measure permeability directly. In this paper we use numerical simulations {{to demonstrate that the}} seismo-electric method is potentially suitable to map {{the horizontal}} distribution of permeability changes across coal seams. We propose the use of an amplitude to offset (AVO) analysis of the electrical signal in combination with poststack seismic data collected during the exploration phase. Recording of electrical signals from a simple seismic source can be closer to production planning and operations. The numerical model is based on a sonic wave propagation model under the low frequency, saturated media assumption and uses a coupled high order spectral element and low order finite element solver.

They {{pick up and}} move fluids, gases, solutes, colloids, particulate matter and heat from loading sites in recharge areas and/or {{on their way to}} the discharge areas and can deliver them “en route” or in discharge regions. Gravitational flow systems of various horizontal and vertical extents are organized into hierarchically nested complex patterns controlled by the configuration of the water table’s relief and modified by the rock framework’s <b>heterogeneities</b> <b>of</b> <b>permeability.</b> The systems are ubiquitous and act simultaneously on broad ranges of the spatial and temporal scales of measurement. Their universal geologic agency is manifest by numerous different, even disparate, natural processes and phenomena. Several of these are associated with geothermal heat flow.

The paper’s outline is based on this conceptual structure.

40|$|In {{this study}} we {{investigate}} the patterns of permeability anisotropy and multi-directional <b>heterogeneity</b> <b>of</b> <b>permeability</b> structure based on {{a large number of}} lithofacies-specific horizontal and vertical cylindrical plugs from Upper Santonian Virgelle Member sandstones at Writing-on-Stone Provincial Park, southern Alberta. Diagnostic lithofacies of sandstone-rich, upward-coarsening siliciclastic marine shorefaces and overlying estuarine coastal plain are very common in the geological record. Hence, corresponding permeability distributions are thought to be a good analogue for broadly similar lithofacies and marginal marine successions known to make-up important petroleum reservoirs in Alberta and worldwide (e. g. Belly River Formation, Misoa Formation, Brent Group). The use of permeability distribution types and vertical-to-horizontal permeability ratios (kv/kh) derived in this study can be readily transferred and tested on reservoir models in the subsurface. Highlighted among the results is the relative homo-geneity of vertical permeability (kv) distributions that may arise from the baffling effect of laminar, current-induced fabrics acting as filter. Cross-laminar fluid flow in such facies is expected to form a more uniform and efficient displace-ment front, bypassing fewer pores relative to a heterogeneous, ‘fingering ’ layer-parallel flow profile. Overall, the permeability anisotropy in major lithofacies is low, with mean ratios kv/kh of 0. 7 – 1, consistent with the absence of thick, continuous clay laminae, and only minor baffling by thin, discontinuous carbonaceous laminae or band...|$|E
40|$|International audienceCrystalline-rock {{aquifers}} generally yield limited groundwater resources. However, some highly productive aquifers may be encountered, typically near tectonic discontinuities. In this study, we used {{a multidisciplinary}} experimental field approach to investigate the hydrogeological behavior of a sub-vertical permeable fault zone identified by lineament mapping. We particularly focused our investigations on the hydrogeological interactions with neighboring reservoirs. The geometry of the permeable domains was identified from geological information and hydraulic test interpretations. The system was characterized under natural conditions and during a 9 -week large-scale pumping test. We used a combination of piezometric analysis, flow logs, groundwater dating and tracer tests to describe the interactions between permeable domains and the general hydrodynamical behaviors. A clear vertical compartmentalization and a strong spatial <b>heterogeneity</b> <b>of</b> <b>permeability</b> are highlighted. Under ambient conditions, the vertical permeable fault zone allows discharge of deep groundwater flows within the superficial permeable domain. The estimated flow across the total length of the fault zone ranged from 170 to 200 m 3 /day. Under pumping conditions, hydrological data and groundwater dating clearly indicated a flow inversion. The fault zone appears to be highly dependent on the surrounding reservoirs which mainly ensure its recharge. Groundwater fluxes were estimated from tracer tests interpretation. This study demonstrates the hydrogeological capacities of a sub-vertical fault aquifer in a crystalline context. By describing the hydrological behavior of a fault zone, this study provides important constrain about groundwater management and protection of such resources...|$|E
40|$|Dispersion” has two {{meanings}} in reservoir engineering: (1) {{the variety of}} arrival times at a production well for an injected tracer, which is mostly a function of <b>heterogeneity</b> <b>of</b> <b>permeability</b> in the reservoir, and (2) mixing of injected fluids in situ. It {{is very difficult to}} distinguish these two processes in situ, while the success of different processes depends on different aspects of dispersion. For instance: a geothermal producer depends on the arrival time of cold water, while low-salinity water and miscible-flood displacements are harmed by in situ mixing. Moreover, simulation studies need to contend with numerical dispersion, a purely artificial effect of numerical simulation. In this thesis we develop a first-order-accurate two-dimensional streamline-based simulator to model in-situ mixing of tracer particles. A coordinate transformation is performed from an (x,y) to an (x,?) domain, such that all streamlines are parallel, before applying the convection-diffusion equation. When using streamline methods, numerical dispersion mostly occurs in the longitudinal direction which effects particle distributions {{in the same way as}} longitudinal diffusion. Taylor (1953) described how the effect of transverse diffusion effects the distribution of particles more than longitudinal diffusion. The streamline model is used to simulate Taylor dispersion in a tube in order to study the effect of longitudinal numerical dispersion on the accuracy of the model. As predicted by (Taylor 1953), numerical dispersion is found to diminish in importance as higher transverse diffusion coefficients are introduced, increasing the accuracy of the model. This effect is further studied by comparing the first-order accurate model with a higher-order accurate model and analytical solutions. After establishing that the model works, it is compared to a particle-tracking simulator which is considered to be state-of-the-art. Particle-tracking simulators are free of numerical dispersion but cannot accurately model in-situ concentrations unless exceedingly large numbers of particles are included. Rather, they infer mixing has taken place from the variance of particles positions obtained from flow-reversal tests and assume part of this mixing has taken place in forward flow. The streamline-based model developed in this thesis shows similar results to the model developed by Berentsen et al. (2007) in the Taylor limit, but slightly different results in the convective limit and intermediate scenarios. The potential of the streamline-based simulator is shown by applying the model to a realistic, although only two-dimensional, scenario of a heterogeneous reservoir. Especially in the convective limit does the streamline based model show more accurate results than a conventional simulator. Finally, we apply the model to a situation which includes adsorption of particles by the solid phase. The adsorption and flow depend on local concentrations; a situation a particle-tracking model cannot easily model. Section Petroleum EngineeringCivil Engineering and Geoscience...|$|E

40|$|Growing {{stockpiles}} of industrial liquid waste stored in lagoons are an outstanding problem worldwide. Self-sustaining Treatment for Active Remediation (STAR) is an emerging technology based on smouldering combustion {{that has been}} successfully deployed for in situ remediation of field sites (Grant et al., 2016). STAR is currently being developed as an ex situ treatment system (STARx) for industrial wastes by intentionally mixing them with sand. One engineering concept for STARx is the “hotpad”, for which some initial experiments have been conducted. However, a thorough experimental investigation is challenging due to the cost and time associated with each experiment. This work employed a two-dimensional (vertical cross-section) numerical model to systematically explore sensitivity of STARx hotpad performance to system design, operational parameters, and environmental factors. The phenomenological model that was used uniquely combines a multiphase flow code and a front expansion routine (MacPhee et al., 2012; Hasan et al., 2015). First, the model was calibrated and validated against pilot-scale (~ 2 m width) hotpad experiments, providing confidence that the rate and extent of treatment were correctly predicted. Pilot-scale simulations then investigated the sensitivity of system performance to: injected airflow rate, organic liquid concentration, hotpad configuration, system dimensions, <b>heterogeneity</b> <b>of</b> intrinsic <b>permeability,</b> and <b>heterogeneity</b> <b>of</b> organic liquid concentration. The expected performance of two field-scale configurations (~ 10 m width) was also explored. Hotpad performance is predicted to be most sensitive to the injected air flux, with higher air fluxes achieving higher rates of organic liquid destruction and treating larger fractions of the initial mass. The uniformity of the advancing smouldering front was predicted to be highly dependent on the effective permeability ratio between untreated and treated materials. As a result, increased <b>heterogeneity</b> – <b>of</b> intrinsic <b>permeability</b> in particular – is predicted to degrade remedial performance. Full-scale systems were predicted to achieve treatment rates {{an order of magnitude}} higher than the pilot-scale for a similar organic liquid concentration and injected air flux. It is anticipated that this work will increase understanding of several key processes that impact STARx performance and help optimize hotpad design and operation...|$|R

40|$|Traditionally, {{the goal}} of nanoparticle-based {{chemotherapy}} has been to decrease normal tissue toxicity by improving drug specificity to tumors. The enhanced permeability and retention effect can permit passive accumulation into tumor interstitium. However, suboptimal delivery is achieved with most nanoparticles because <b>of</b> <b>heterogeneities</b> <b>of</b> vascular <b>permeability,</b> which limits nanoparticle penetration. Furthermore, slow drug release limits bioavailability. We developed a fast drug-releasing liposome triggered by local heat that has already shown substantial antitumor efficacy and is in human trials. Here, we show that thermally sensitive liposomes (Dox-TSL) release doxorubicin inside the tumor vasculature. Real-time confocal imaging of doxorubicin delivery to murine tumors in window chambers and histologic analysis of flank tumors illustrates that intravascular drug release increases free drug in the interstitial space. This increases both the time that tumor cells are exposed to maximum drug levels and the drug penetration distance, compared with free drug or traditional pegylated liposomes. These improvements in drug bioavailability establish a new paradigm in drug delivery: rapidly triggered drug release in the tumor bloodstream. Copyrigh...|$|R

40|$|Background: <b>Heterogeneity</b> <b>of</b> {{vascular}} <b>permeability</b> {{has been}} suggested for the coronary system. Whereas arteriolar and capillary segments are tight, plasma proteins pass readily into the interstitial space at venular sites. Fittingly, lymphatic fluid is able to coagulate. However, heart tissue contains high concentrations of tissue factor, presumably enabling bleeding to be stopped immediately in this vital organ. The distribution of pro- and anti-coagulatively active factors in human heart tissue has now been determined {{in relation to the}} types of microvessels. Methods and Results: Samples of healthy explanted hearts and dilated cardiomyopathic hearts were immunohistochemically stained. Albumin was found throughout the interstitial space. Tissue factor was packed tightly around arterioles and capillaries, whereas the tissue surrounding venules and small veins was practically free of this starter of coagulation. Thrombomodulin was present at the luminal surface of all vessel segments and especially at venular endothelial cell junctions. Its product, the anticoagulant protein C, appeared only at discrete extravascular sites, mainly next to capillaries. These distribution patterns were basically identical in the healthy and diseased hearts, suggesting a general principle. Conclusions: Venular extravasation of plasma proteins probably would not bring prothrombin into intimate contact with tissue factor, avoiding interstitial coagulation in the absence of injury. Generation of activated protein C via thrombomodulin is favored in the vicinity of venular gaps, should thrombin occur inside coronary vessels. This regionalization of distribution supports the proposed physiological <b>heterogeneity</b> <b>of</b> the vascular barrier and complies with the passage of plasma proteins into the lymphatic system of the heart.

The authors based our geological analysis of the sediment-basement interface on drilling, geological, and geophysical data available for the Soultz geothermal wells. The work concentrated on a detailed interpretation of the geophysical and geological logs from the Soultz geothermal wells GPK- 1 (3.6  km), GPK- 2 (5  km), GPK- 3 (5  km), and GPK- 4 (5  km), which extend mainly from the topographic surface to the Triassic formations between 0.8 - and 1.4 -km depth. The available drilling data include the lithology, rate of penetration of the drill bit, weight on bit, evidence of natural outflow (partial and total mud losses), occurrence of gas (helium and methane), and mud temperature variations. Additional well logging data, such as temperature, gamma ray, and caliper logs, were correlated with the drilling data. The methodology was extended to peripheral wells (EPS- 1 and 4550) of the Soultz field in which borehole images were available for sediments. Based on these well logging data, the location in the sedimentary cover of the fracture zones and their permeability were used to estimate the impact of the fracture system on the thermal regime. Properties of the fracture system itself limit hydrothermal circulation, and the authors tried to identify a sedimentary layer that could limit the upper part of the convective cells. Spatially correlating the fracture zones between different geothermal boreholes was an important focus of this study in order to explore the <b>heterogeneity</b> <b>of</b> the <b>permeability</b> <b>of</b> a given fault that crosses several wells at depth.|$|R

30|$|Cell {{junctions}} in the gastrointestinal (GI) tract {{are perhaps}} the most complex, with variation along the length as well as within crypt-villi axes, reflecting the variable functions of the gut (Table 1) [24]. The GI barrier is comprised of intimately related endothelial and epithelial cells which depend on numerous, tract-specific claudins to selectively allow nutrient absorption while excluding bacteria [19]. Additional claudin species are likely expressed under special circumstances such as acute disease [25]. The spatial and temporal <b>heterogeneity</b> <b>of</b> claudin expression permits the range <b>of</b> <b>permeability</b> essential to GI function and adaptability. Unfortunately, this wide range of expression may limit the utility of these proteins as tissue-specific biomarkers.|$|R
40|$|The {{coefficient}} <b>of</b> <b>permeability</b> <b>of</b> stratified soil deposits, {{when the}} flow is normal to {{the orientation of}} the bedding planes, has been observed to deviate from the value calculated theoretically. The coefficient <b>of</b> <b>permeability</b> is calculated by Darcy’s law. The present technical study deals with the results from the study <b>of</b> <b>permeability</b> behaviour <b>of</b> two layer soil system and three-layer soil system. For two layer soil system the coefficient <b>of</b> <b>permeability</b> <b>of</b> exit layer is considering as controlling factorfor three layer soil system the coefficient <b>of</b> <b>permeability</b> depends upon the relative positioning of soil. This study reinforces the point that the coefficient <b>of</b> <b>permeability</b> <b>of</b> a layered soil system, when the flow is normal to {{the orientation of the}} bedding planes, depends upon the relative positioning of the layers with different values <b>of</b> coefficient <b>of</b> <b>permeability</b> in the system...|$|R
40|$|Coal {{permeability}} models {{based on}} constrained {{conditions such as}} constant volume theory can successfully match unconstrained experimental data and field observations. However, these models have a boundary mismatch because the boundary <b>of</b> <b>permeability</b> models is constrained while experiment boundary is free displacement or unconstrained. What the mechanism is to require such a boundary mismatch has not been well understood. In this study, a full coupled approach was developed to explicitly simulate the interactions of coal matrixes and fractures. In this model, a matrix-fracture model is numerically investigated after incorporating heterogeneous distributions of Young 2 ̆ 7 s modulus, Langmuir strain constant {{in the vicinity of}} the fracture. The impact <b>of</b> these local <b>heterogeneities</b> <b>of</b> coal mechanical and swelling properties on the permeability evolution is explored. The transient permeability evolution during gas swelling process is investigated and the difference between the final equilibrium permeability and transient permeability is compared. With the heterogeneity assumption, a net reduction <b>of</b> coal <b>permeability</b> is achieved from the initial no-swelling state to the final equilibrium state. This net reduction <b>of</b> coal <b>permeability</b> increases with the fracture (injection) pressure and is in good agreement with laboratorial data under the unconstrained swelling conditions. Coal local <b>heterogeneity</b> in vicinity <b>of</b> fracture can therefore be the mechanism of the above mismatch...|$|R
40|$|Development and {{verification}} of a coefficient <b>of</b> <b>permeability</b> function for a deformable unsaturated soil Shangyan Huang, S. L. Barbour, and D. G. Fredlund Abstract: The modelling of flow through saturated/unsaturated soils has become routine in geotechnical and geo-environmental engineering. The analysis {{requires that the}} coefficient <b>of</b> <b>permeability</b> for an unsaturated soil be defined. The coefficient <b>of</b> <b>permeability</b> can be estimated based on currently available procedures. However, each procedure has limitations and consequently cares should be taken {{in the selection of}} a proper procedure. The coefficient <b>of</b> <b>permeability</b> <b>of</b> a saturated soil is a function of void ratio. The coefficient <b>of</b> <b>permeability</b> <b>of</b> an unsaturated soil of constant volume, {{is a function of the}} degree of saturation. However, soil is deformable and both the degree of saturation and the void-ratio influence the coefficient <b>of</b> <b>permeability</b> <b>of</b> a compressible, unsaturated soil. In this paper, the literature pertaining to the coefficient <b>of</b> <b>permeability</b> function for an unsaturated soil of constant volume and the coefficient <b>of</b> <b>permeability</b> for a deformable saturated soil are reviewed. A new coefficient <b>of</b> <b>permeability</b> function for a deformable unsaturated porous medium is then developed. A series of triaxial permeameter tests on unsaturated silty sand are described and the results from the experimental program are analyzed using th...|$|R
40|$|Abstract – A new {{approach}} to modeling injecting domain has been developed based on changing permeability coefficient in a certain form in theory of consolidation. The proposed model utilizes the variation of the coefficient <b>of</b> <b>permeability</b> {{with respect to the}} pore fluid pressure justifying flow characteristic below certain hydraulic gradients and void volume changes. A proposed numerical solution for <b>heterogeneity</b> <b>of</b> media with regards to the permeability coefficient also leads the results to a better grout extension solution. The potential of the proposed model is evaluated in predicting the propagation of grouting material due to a single injection bore hole. The general comparison indicates that this approach is capable of solving the injection boundary value problem...|$|R
