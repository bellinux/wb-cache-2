30|$|In this diagram the {{difference}} in mill equivalent percentage between alkaline earths (Ca + Mg) and alkali metals (Na + K), expressed as percentage reacting values, is plotted on the X axis and {{the difference}} in mill equivalent percentage between weak acidic anions (CO 3  + HCO 3) and strong acidic anions (Cl + SO 4) is plotted on the Y axis. The mill equivalent percentage differences between alkaline earth and alkali metals and between weak acidic anions and strong acidic anions would plot {{in one of the}} four possible sub-fields of the diagram. The square or rectangular field describes the overall character of the water. In order to define the primary character of water, the rectangular field is divided into eight sub-fields, each of which represents a water type: (1) alkaline earths <b>exceed</b> alkali metals; (2) alkali metals <b>exceed</b> alkaline earths; (3) weak acidic anions <b>exceed</b> strong acidic anions; (4) strong acidic anions <b>exceed</b> weak acidic anions; (5) alkaline earths and weak acidic anions <b>exceed</b> both alkali metals and strong acidic anions, respectively; such water has temporary hardness; (6) alkaline earths <b>exceed</b> alkali metals and strong acidic anions <b>exceed</b> weak acidic anions; such water has permanent hardness; (7) alkali metals <b>exceed</b> alkaline earths and strong acidic anions <b>exceed</b> weak acidic anions; (8) alkali metals <b>exceed</b> alkaline earths and weak acidic anions <b>exceed</b> strong acidic anions.|$|R
30|$|The Chadha diagram (Chadha 1999) {{was used}} to define the major water types in the areas. It is a {{modified}} version of the Piper (1944) diagram and plots the difference in milliequivalent percentage between alkaline earths (Ca + Mg) and alkali metals (Na + K) expressed as percentage and plotted on the x-axis. The difference in milliequivalent percentage between weak acidic anions (CO 3  + HCO 3) and strong acidic anions (Cl + SO 4) is plotted on the y-axis. The rectangular field resulting from this is similar to the diamond-shaped field in the Piper diagram and describes the overall character of the water. Thus, there are eight fields in the rectangular plot which represent eight different water types as in the case of Piper diagram. Those eight water types are: (1) alkaline earths <b>exceed</b> alkali metals; (2) alkali metals <b>exceed</b> alkaline earths; (3) weak acidic anions <b>exceed</b> strong acidic anions; (4) strong acidic anions <b>exceed</b> weak acidic anions; (5) alkaline earths and weak acidic anions <b>exceed</b> both alkali metals and strong acidic anions, respectively (such water has temporary hardness); (6) alkaline earths <b>exceed</b> alkali metals and strong acidic anions <b>exceed</b> weak acidic anions (such water has permanent hardness); (7) alkali metals <b>exceed</b> alkaline earths and strong acidic anions <b>exceed</b> weak acidic anions; (8) alkali metals <b>exceed</b> alkaline earths and weak acidic anions <b>exceed</b> strong acidic anions (Chadha 1999).|$|R
