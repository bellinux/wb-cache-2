40|$|In this paper, we analyze {{electric}} <b>deflection</b> <b>fields</b> for polar {{molecules in}} terms of a multipole expansion and derive a simple but rather insightful expression for the force on the molecules. Ideally, a <b>deflection</b> <b>field</b> exerts a strong, constant force in one direction, while the force in the other directions is zero. We show how, by a proper choice of the expansion coefficients, this ideal can be best approximated. We present a design for a practical electrode geometry based on this analysis. By bending such a <b>deflection</b> <b>field</b> into a circle, a simple storage ring can be created; the direct analog of a weak-focusing cyclotron for charged particles. We show that for realistic parameters a weak-focusing ring is only stable for molecules with a very low velocity.

40|$|The {{origin of}} ultra-high energy cosmic rays (UHECRs) and neutrinos {{is still a}} mystery. Hadronic {{acceleration}} theory suggests that they should originate in the same sources (astrophysical or cosmological), together with gammarays. While gamma-rays {{have been linked to}} astrophysical sources, no point source of UHECRs or neutrinos have been found so far. In this paper, the multimessenger combination of UHECRs and neutrinos as a new approach to the high energy particle point source search is suggested. A statistical method for cross-correlation of UHECR and neutrino data sets is proposed. By obtaining the probability density function of number of neutrino events within chosen angular distance from observed UHECRs, the number of neutrino events in the vicinity of observed UHECRs, necessary to claim a discovery with a chosen significance, can be calculated. Different angular distances (bin sizes) are considered due to the unknown deflection of cosmic rays in galactic and intergalactic magnetic fields. Possible observed correlation of the arrival directions of UHECRs and neutrinos would provide a strong indication of hadronic acceleration theory. Correlation of both types of messengers with the location of certain sets of observed astrophysical objects would indicate sites of acceleration.

The resiliency behavior of several candidate O-ring materials was evaluated for the effects of temperature and gap opening rates. The performance of three of the elastomeric materials was tested under the specific redesign gap opening requirement. Dynamic exure conditions unique to launch produce low-frequency vibrations in the gap opening.

Unfortunately, as {{yet there is no}} easy way to directly input the precise power profiles into ANSYS. A straight-forward {{way to do this is}} to hand-calculate the power of each node or element and then type the data into the code. Every time a change is made to the FE model, the data must be recalculated and reentered. One way to solve this problem is to generate a set of discrete data, using another code such as PHOTON 2, and curve-fit the data. Using curve-fitted formulae has several disadvantages. It is time consuming because of the need to run a second code for generation of the data, curve-fitting, and doing the data check, etc. Additionally, because there is no generality for different beamlines or different parameters, the above work must be repeated for each case. And, errors in the power profiles due to curve-fitting result in errors in the analysis. To solve the problem once and for all and with the capability to apply to any insertion device (ID), a program for ED power profile was written in ANSYS Parametric Design Language (APDL).

Pre-shock plasma density, shock compression ratio, speed and inclination angle are estimated from WL data, while pre-shock plasma temperature and outflow velocity are derived from UV data. The Rankine-Hugoniot (RH) equations for the general case of an oblique shock are then applied at three points along the front located between 2. 2 - 2. 6 R_ at the shock nose and at the two flanks. Stronger <b>field</b> <b>deflection</b> (by ∼ 46 ^∘), plasma compression (factor ∼ 2. 7) and heating (factor ∼ 12) occur at the nose, while heating at the flanks is more moderate (factor 1. 5 - 3. 0). Starting from a pre-shock corona where protons and electrons have about the same temperature (T_p ∼ T_e ∼ 1. 5 · 10 ^ 6 K), temperature increases derived with RH equations could better represent the protons heating (by dissipation across the shock), while the temperature increase implied by adiabatic compression (factor ∼ 2 at the nose, ∼ 1. 2 - 1. 5 at the flanks) could be more representative of electrons heating: the transit of the shock causes a decoupling between electron and proton temperatures. Derived magnetic field vector rotations imply a draping of field lines around the expanding flux rope. The shock turns out to be super-critical (sub-critical) at the nose (at the flanks), where derived post-shock plasma parameters can be very well approximated with those derived by assuming a parallel (perpendicular) shock.

The observational data are retrieved from the combination of white-light coronagraphic data (for the upstream values) {{and the application of}} the Rankine–Hugoniot equations (for the downstream values). The comparison shows a higher compression ratio X and Alfvénic Mach number MA at the shock nose, and a stronger magnetic <b>field</b> <b>deflection</b> d toward the flanks, in agreement with observations. Then, we compare the {{spatial distribution of}} MA with the profiles obtained from the solutions of the shock adiabatic equation relating MA, X, and θ_Bn (the angle between the upstream magnetic field and the shock front normal) for the special cases of parallel and perpendicular shock, and with a semi-empirical expression for a generically oblique shock. The semi-empirical curve approximates the actual values of MA very well, if the effects of a non-negligible shock thickness δ_sh and plasma-to magnetic pressure ratio β_u are taken into account throughout the computation. Moreover, the simulated shock turns out to be supercritical at the nose and sub-critical at the flanks. Finally, we develop a new one-dimensional Lagrangian ideal MHD method based on the GrAALE code, to simulate the ion-electron temperature decoupling due to the shock transit.

40|$|The aim of {{this thesis}} {{is to improve the}} {{understanding}} of the behaviour of Polyvinyl Butyral (PVB) laminated annealed glass façade panels subjected to blast loading. A full scale blast test was performed. During this, deflection and strain data were collected employing digital image correlation techniques (DIC). Local reaction forces were measured using several pairs of strain gauges on the support. The full <b>field</b> <b>deflection</b> and strain data obtained were in line with those observed in historical tests. The strain gauge data available showed that the reaction forces varied along the edge, with higher values being reached at the quarter length gauge locations. The results from this test and from other historical experiments were used to calculate the reaction forces along the entire perimeter of the glass pane. The results showed that the forces reach an early peak before the glass failure, and then rise gradually approaching a plateau at high central deflections. To explain the specific form of this force time history, the detailed behaviour of the laminated material after the glass skins failed was studied. Existing experimental data was employed to fit a material model to the PVB material. Two Prony series models with different hyperelastic springs and a model employing a full finite deformation viscoelastic law derivation were employed. It was found that the finite deformation viscoelastic model could represent the material’s behaviour more accurately and fully include its rate dependency. One of the PVB models was employed to study the delamination between the glass and the membrane. Delamination energies were found for different speeds of deformation, and these parameters were employed to study the delamination of samples presenting different crack arrangements. The results showed that these had only a limited influence on the behaviour of the composite. Open Acces...|$|E

We present in this paper 1420 MHz polarization, 1420 MHz total intensity (Stokes-I), and neutral hydrogen (H I) images of the region around Sh 2 - 174. The radio images address not only the nature of the object, but also the history of the relationship between Sh 2 - 174 and its surrounding environment. The H I images show that Sh 2 - 174 sits presently {{at the center of a}} 1 fdg 2 7 0 fdg 4 cloud (with peak hydrogen density n H = 4 1 2 cm 2 ̆ 0133). The Stokes-I image shows thermal-emission peaks (with electron densities ne = 11 1 3 cm 2 ̆ 0133) coincident with the R-band optical nebula, as well as low-surface-brightness emission from an ionized "halo" around Sh 2 - 174 and from an ionized "plateau" extending southeast from the cloud. The polarization images reveal Faraday-rotation structures along the projected trajectory of Sh 2 - 174, including a high-contrast structure with "arms" that run precisely along the eastern edge of the H I cloud and a wide central region that merges with the downstream edge of Sh 2 - 174. The high-contrast structure is consistent with an ionized tail that has both early-epoch (before Sh 2 - 174 entered the cloud) and present-epoch (after Sh 2 - 174 entered the cloud) components.

40|$|In a case study, we {{investigate}} transitions between fundamental magnetosphere–ionosphere (M-I) coupling modes during storm-time conditions (SYM-H between − 100 and − 160 nT) {{driven by an}} interplanetary coronal mass ejection (ICME). We combine observations from the near tail, at geostationary altitude (GOES- 10), and electrojet activities across the auroral oval at postnoon-to-dusk and midnight. After an interval of strong westward electrojet (WEJ) activity, a 3 h long state of attenuated/quenched WEJ activity was initiated by abrupt drops in the solar wind density and dynamic pressure. The attenuated substorm activity consisted of brief phases of magnetic field perturbation and electron flux decrease at GOES- 10 near midnight and moderately strong conjugate events of WEJ enhancements at the southern boundary of the oval, {{as well as a}} series of very strong eastward electrojet (EEJ) events at dusk, during a phase of enhanced ring current evolution, i. e., enhanced SYM-H deflection within − 120 to − 150 nT. Each of these M-I coupling events was preceded by poleward boundary intensifications and auroral streamers at higher oval latitudes. We identify this mode of attenuated substorm activity as being due to a magnetotail state characterized by bursty reconnection and bursty bulk flows/dipolarization fronts (multiple current wedgelets) with associated injection dynamo in the near tail, in their braking phase. The latter process is associated with activations of the Bostrøm type II (meridional) current system. A transition to the next state of M-I coupling, when a full substorm expansion took place, was triggered by an abrupt increase of the ICME dynamic pressure from 1 to 5 nPa. The brief <b>field</b> <b>deflection</b> events at GOES- 10 were then replaced by a 20 min long interval of extreme field stretching (B z approaching 5 nT and B x ≈ 100 nT) followed by a major dipolarization (Δ B z ≈ 100 nT). In the ionosphere the latter stage appeared as a "full-size" stepwise poleward expansion of the WEJ. It thus appears that the ICME passage led to fundamentally different M-I coupling states corresponding to different levels of dynamic pressure (P dyn) under otherwise very similar ICME conditions. Full WEJ activity, covering a wide latitude range across the auroral oval in the midnight sector, was attenuated by the abrupt dynamic pressure decrease and resumed after the subsequent abrupt increase...|$|E
40|$|With the {{publicly}} available astrophysical simulation framework for propagating extraterrestrial UHE particles, CRPropa 3, {{it is now}} possible to study realistic UHECR source scenarios including deflections in Galactic and extragalactic magnetic fields in an efficient way. Here we discuss three recent studies that have already been done in that direction. The first one investigates what can be expected in the case of maximum allowed intergalactic magnetic fields. Here is shown that, even if voids contain strong magnetic <b>fields,</b> <b>deflections</b> of protons with energies ≳ 60 EeV from nearby sources might be small enough to allow for UHECR astronomy. The second study looks into several scenarios with a smaller magnetization focusing on large-scale anisotropies. Here is shown that the local source distribution can have a more significant effect on the large-scale anisotropy than the EGMF model. A significant dipole component could, for instance, be explained by a dominant source within 5 Mpc distance. The third study looks into whether UHECRs can come from local radio galaxies. If this is the case it is difficult to reproduce the observed low level of anisotropy. Therefore is concluded that the magnetic field strength in voids in the EGMF model used here is too low and/or there are additional sources of UHECRs that were not taken into account in these simulations.

40|$|This {{invention}} comprises a new deflection structure which deflects {{a beam of}} charged particles, such as {{an electron}} beam, includes a serpentine set for transmitting a <b>deflection</b> <b>field,</b> and shielding frame for housing the serpentine set. The serpentine set includes a vertical serpentine deflection element and a horizontal serpentine deflection element. These deflection elements are identical and are interdigitatedly and orthogonally disposed relative to each other, for forming a central transmission passage, through which the electron beam passes and is deflected by the <b>deflection</b> <b>field</b> to minimize drift space signal distortion. The shielding frame includes a plurality of ground blocks and forms an internal serpentine trough within these ground blocks for housing the serpentine set. The deflection structure further includes a plurality of feedthrough connectors which are inserted through the shielding frame and which are electrically connected to the serpentine set...|$|R
