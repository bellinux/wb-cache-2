500|$|On December 12, 2007, Keyes {{participated in}} the Des Moines Registers Republican presidential debate, {{televised}} nationwide by PBS and the cable news networks. This {{was the first major}} presidential debate in which Keyes participated during the 2008 election season and the last Republican debate before the Iowa Caucuses. Although Keyes was not listed on the latest national CNN poll leading up to the debate, he registered with at least 1 percent of the Iowa vote in order to participate. During the debate, after the moderator began to ask a question of Texas Congressman Ron Paul, Keyes insisted he was not getting fair treatment. He interrupted the debate moderator at one point, saying that she had not called on him in several rounds and that he had to make an issue of it. He went on the offensive against his opponents during the debate, criticizing Rudy Giuliani's pro-choice position, as well as Mitt Romney's recent change in position on the same subject. In answering a question about global warming, he continued his criticisms of other candidates, saying, [...] "I'm in favor of reducing global warming, because <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>the</b> <b>most</b> <b>important</b> emission we need to control is the hot air emission of politicians who pretend one thing and don't deliver". He also advocated ending the income tax, establishing state-sanctioned prayer in public schools, and abolishing abortion. Toward the end of the debate, Keyes stated he could not support Giuliani if he were to win the nomination due to the former New York mayor's position on abortion.|$|E

You believe in the extreme moment of the facts that {{humanity}} has acquired and is acquiring; I think them of moment, but still of much less than those inherent or inherited brute principles and laws that sit upon us (in the character of conscience) as heavy as a shirt of mail, and that (in {{the character of the}} affections and the airy spirit of pleasure) make all the light of our lives.

Yes, truly, his insight is admirable; his truth is precious. Yet the secret of his effect is not even in these; it is in his temper. It is in the hopeful, serene, beautiful temper wherewith these, in Emerson, are indissolubly united; in which they work and have their being.... One can scarcely overrate the importance of holding fast to happiness and hope. It gives to Emerson's work an invaluable virtue. As Wordsworth's poetry is, in my judgment, the most important done in verse, in our language, during the present century, so Emerson's Essays are, <b>I</b> <b>think,</b> <b>the</b> <b>most</b> <b>important</b> work done in prose.... But by his conviction that {{in the life of the}} spirit is happiness, and by his hope that this life of the spirit will come more and more to be sanely understood, and to prevail, and to work for happiness,--by this conviction and hope Emerson was great, and he will surely prove in the end to have been right in them....

He was very important, as he was able to transmit to us precisely what he wanted. We hit rock bottom with defeat to Foggia, so Lippi said if we have to lose, we’ll go down fighting.

Lippi was excellent at motivating the squad and passing on his ideas. <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>the</b> <b>most</b> <b>important</b> thing for a Coach is to have a clear vision and transmit that clearly to his players.

The contrasting personal beliefs of Collin Simula and Jack Huston give Maranatha {{a unique and}} unfiltered perspective regarding spirituality, and as the record’s name indicates, Filth {{is really all about}} the filthy side of this world we live in. It’s a vitriolic call to arms, a rage-filled rally to fix this broken world, and an honest representation of our own broken humanity." [...] writes Aaron Lambert. Jeremiah Nelson reports [...] "Filth is as heavy as they come. Monstrous riffs combine with angry hardcore and intimate, bloody lyrics. The band that started as a one-man emotional outlet is growing into a fearsome beast. Maranatha is releasing Filth on New American Records on July 24. You can pre-order it here." [...] Shayne Mathis of FullMetalHipster writes [...] "Straight outta my home state of Ohio comes Maranatha. The band’s new album, Filth, hits like a ton of bricks. Bricks made of rage. It’s the musical equivalent of the Incredible Hulk during the World War Hulk storyline. Bottomless, unstoppable fury." [...] "With all that said, <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>the</b> <b>most</b> <b>important</b> part of the Maranatha is not so much their sound, but the lyrical tension between the injustice of this world and finding peace with in it. It’s a constant push and pull against black and white, depravity and morality, and the hypocrisy of those who claim to know the way and preach a message of love out of one side of their mouths and a doctrine of ignorance and sometimes pure hate out of the other. It’s a theme carried on from the very first releases and expounded upon and explored in further depth on Filth. My advice to the listener is to listen to what’s being said as well as letting the music pummel you.|$|E

40|$|Nelson's vision is, <b>I</b> <b>think,</b> <b>the</b> <b>most</b> <b>important</b> {{vision in}} the history of computing. That's a tall call, so I'll need to explain my reasoning. In my book Memory Machines (Barnet 2013) I argue that the idea of a {{universal}} digital publishing system, an 'open hypermedia' system, originated with Nelson. Bush's vision, though it was about connected items, was analogue. Engelbart's vision was also profoundly important. He was first to build many of the things we take for granted in modern computing (and I don't mean the mouse; I mean the whole concept of real-time, networked, interactive computing). His contributions would take hours to elaborate. But he was not thinking about hypertext as a domestic thing - something your mom and pop would consume over latte and a cheeseburger. Nelson saw that hypertext on a computer screen would spread around the globe like electronic kudzu vine. He wrote singing commercials for it; he even sketched a quirky interior for a Xanadu cafe...|$|E

40|$|Translation can {{be known}} through direct {{engagement}} with the practice or profession, through theoretical propositions, or through empirical applications of theoretical propositions. Here we {{make the argument that}} the repetition of theoretical propositions without empirical application leads to some unhelpful pieces of philosophy. This particularly concerns the following general postulates 1) “translation is difference”, tested on Walter Benjamin’s reference to the untranslatability of words for bread; 2) “translation is survival”, tested on Homi Bhabha’s use of Benjamin and Derrida (who do not survive the use); 3) “translators are authors”, tested on the “alien I”, pseudotranslations and process studies; and 4) “translation is cultural translation”, tested on the subject positions created by a piece of current Germanic theoretical discourse. On all four counts, the case is made that the practice of translation exceeds its theory, thus requiring an ongoing empirical attitude. <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>the</b> <b>most</b> <b>important</b> trend has been the shift from philosophical conceptual analysis towards empirical research.

40|$|Let {{me first}} {{illustrate}} what <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>the</b> <b>most</b> <b>important</b> {{aspect of the}} so-called Takenaka plan. By now, many policymakers and academics share a high praise for the Takenaka plan of October 30, 2002 as the decisive way of ending the decade-long banking crisis of Japan. 1 However, few remem-ber how its reputation has evolved from being too tough to being too com-promised, and finally to producing moral hazard by rescuing shareholders of a failing bank. Ironically, appearing too tough made the stock prices de-cline, and failure, nationalization, and bailing out shareholders of the Res-ona Bank produced a moral hazard rally in May 2003. Let me explain the evolution briefly. (See Hoshi and Ito [2004] for a re-view of the Financial Services Agency from 1998 to 2004.) In the spring to summer of 2002, a hot debate regarding the soundness of the Japanese banking system took place.
