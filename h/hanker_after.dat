5|$|I {{had it in}} my head {{to write}} an epic of it, but though I still <b>hanker</b> <b>after</b> it, I see clearly it would be foolish, for no verse could render {{the best parts of}} it, and it would only be a flatter and tamer version of a thing already existing.|$|E
25|$|It is {{the misfortune}} of small, precise men always to <b>hanker</b> <b>after</b> large and {{flamboyant}} women. Poirot {{had never been able}} to rid himself of the fatal fascination that the Countess held for him.|$|E
500|$|Wodehouse {{remained}} unsettled {{until he}} and Ethel left New York City for suburban Long Island. Bolton {{and his wife}} lived in the prosperous hamlet of Remsenburg, part of the Southampton resort area of Long Island, [...] east of Manhattan. Wodehouse stayed with them frequently, and in 1952 he and Ethel bought a house nearby. They lived at Remsenburg {{for the rest of}} their lives. Between 1952 and 1975 he published more than twenty novels, as well as two collections of short stories, a heavily edited collection of his letters, a volume of memoirs, and a selection of his magazine articles. He continued to <b>hanker</b> <b>after</b> a revival of his theatrical career. A 1959 off-Broadway revival of the 1917 Bolton-Wodehouse-Kern Leave It to Jane was a surprise hit, running for 928 performances, but his few post-war stage works, some in collaboration with Bolton, made little impression.|$|E

500|$|During {{preparations}} [...] for {{the first}} German performance of Noye's Fludde in Ettal, planned for May 1959, {{the problem of the}} scarcity of handbells [...] became acute. Britten suggested that in the absence of handbells a set of tubular bells in E flat in groups of twos and threes could be played by four or six children with two hammers each to enable them to strike the chords. Britten was not present in Ettal, but he learned from Ernst Roth, of Boosey & Hawkes, that the Ettal production had substituted glockenspiel and metallophone for the handbells; according to Roth the bells in Carl Orff's Schulwerk percussion ensembles were [...] "too weak" [...] for the purpose. Britten later wrote to a friend: [...] "I am rather relieved that I wasn't there! – no church, no bugles, no handbells, no recorders – but they seem to have done it {{with a great deal of}} care all the same. Still I rather <b>hanker</b> <b>after</b> doing it in Darmstadt as we want it – even importing handbells for instance." ...|$|E

6000|$|... "Good! I'd a <b>hankering</b> <b>after</b> adventures, and now {{it looks}} as if I'd be gratified. But you had better not give us clothes with a name on them." ...|$|R
6000|$|... (10) Quite {{right about}} Dryden. I had a <b>hankering</b> <b>after</b> Threnodia Augustalis; but I find it long and with very prosaic holes: though, O! what fine stuff between whiles.|$|R
6000|$|... "It passes my understanding, {{the way you}} <b>hanker</b> <b>after</b> that child," [...] cried Mrs. William impatiently. [...] "Why, she was {{a perfect}} {{stranger}} to you when she came here, and she was here only one summer!" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Oh 'tis true enough, faith. I cannot {{understand}} Farmer Boldwood {{being such}} a fool at his time of life as to ho and <b>hanker</b> <b>after</b> this woman in the way 'a do, and she not care a bit about en." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Peculiarness of Bob is," [...] {{inserted}} the Nueces Kid, [...] "he ain't had proper trainin'. He never {{learned how to}} git skeered.

60|$|DAVID. None of them wants her; that's what {{depresses}} her. I was thinking, father, I {{would buy}} her that gold watch and chain in Snibby's window. She <b>hankers</b> <b>after</b> it.|$|R

6000|$|... "You {{are welcome}} to your opinion, but I wouldn't cry about it. Play with chaps of your own size and don't <b>hanker</b> <b>after</b> men's property. Take the cars, {{if you want to}} go so much, and stop bothering me," [...] {{retorted}} Sid, getting cross because he was in the wrong and wouldn't own it.|$|E
60|$|Friends {{would come}} down {{to spend the day}} with us--elderly, {{irritable}} people, fond of warmth and comfort; people who did not, as a rule, <b>hanker</b> <b>after</b> jaunts, even under the most favourable conditions; but who had been persuaded by our silly talk that a day on the river would be to them like a Saturday to Monday in Paradise.|$|E
6000|$|...

60|$|His reveries {{had made}} Andrew quick-witted, {{and he had}} the {{judicial}} mind which prevents one's judging another rashly. Besides, his <b>hankering</b> <b>after</b> this man had already suggested an exculpation for him.|$|R

6000|$|... "Say, this {{is great}} gum. Listen to me {{cracking}} it. There ain't any gum spruces down at Four Winds," [...] said Mary. [...] "Sometimes I just <b>hanker</b> <b>after</b> a chew. Mrs. Elliott won't let me chew gum if she sees me. She says it ain't lady-like. This lady-business puzzles me. I can't get on to all its kinks. Say, Una, what's the matter with you? Cat got your tongue?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "There's nothin' Injin {{about me}} that water won't wash off. I kalkilated you wouldn't suspect {{anything}} so insignificant as an INJIN, when I fixed myself up. You saw Dawson didn't <b>hanker</b> <b>after</b> me much. But I didn't reckon on YOUR tumbling {{to me so}} quick. That's what gets me! You must hev been pretty low down for kempany when you took a man like me inter your confidence. I don't see it yet." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "What's {{the matter}} with Van Loo?" [...] he said, with a coarse laugh, enjoying his wife's discomfiture. [...] "He speaks French and Spanish, and you oughter hear the kid roll off the lingo he's got from him. He's got style, and knows how to dress, and you ought to see the kid bow and scrape, and how he carries himself. Now, Van Loo wasn't exactly my style, and I reckon I don't <b>hanker</b> <b>after</b> him much, but he served my purpose." ...|$|E

6000|$|... "Bah! I know all. That little coup of Tunbridge {{was played}} by the Aunt Bernstein with {{excellent}} skill. The old woman is the best man of our family. While you were arrested, your boxes were searched for the Mohock's letters to you. When you were let loose, the letters had disappeared, and you said nothing, like a wise woman, as you are sometimes. You still <b>hanker</b> <b>after</b> your Cherokee. Soit. A woman of your mature experience knows {{the value of a}} husband. What is this little loss of two or three hundred pounds?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I {{will never}} <b>hanker</b> <b>after</b> a dead man's shoes, neither for myself nor for another," [...] {{he had said}} to himself a hundred times; and as often did he accuse himself of doing so. One path, however, was plainly open before him. He would keep his peace as to the will; and would use such efforts as he might use for a son of his own loins to {{preserve}} the life that was so valueless. His wishes, his hopes, his thoughts, he could not control; but his conduct was at his own disposal.|$|E
6000|$|... "Well, it wasn't my fault," [...] he said slowly. [...] "If {{they wanted}} to look {{sideways}} at me {{it was up to}} them. And {{it was up to me}} to sidestep if I wanted to, wasn't it? You've no idea, Saxon, how a prizefighter is run after. Why, sometimes it's seemed to me that girls an' women ain't got an ounce of natural shame in their make-up. Oh, I was never afraid of them, believe muh, but I didn't <b>hanker</b> <b>after</b> 'em. A man's a fool that'd let them kind get his goat.|$|E
