A biofuel is a fuel, produced from living organisms. Biofuels include bioethanol, an alcohol made by fermentation—often used as a gasoline additive, and biodiesel, which is usually used as a diesel additive. Specific energy is energy per unit mass, which is used to describe the energy content of a fuel, expressed in SI units as <b>joule</b> <b>per</b> <b>kilogram</b> (J/kg) or equivalent units.

50|$|A {{capacitor}} (originally {{known as}} a 'condenser') is a passive two-terminal electrical component used to store energy electrostatically. Practical capacitors vary widely, but all contain at least two electrical conductors (plates) separated by a dielectric (i.e., insulator). A capacitor can store electric energy when disconnected from its charging circuit, {{so it can be}} used like a temporary battery, or like other types of rechargeable energy storage system. Capacitors are commonly used in electronic devices to maintain power supply while batteries change. (This prevents loss of information in volatile memory.) Conventional capacitors provide less than 360 <b>joules</b> <b>per</b> <b>kilogram,</b> while a conventional alkaline battery has a density of 590 kJ/kg.|$|R
50|$|The NPL in the UK {{operates}} a graphite-calorimeter for absolute photon dosimetry. Graphite {{is used instead}} of water as its specific heat capacity is one-sixth that of water and therefore the temperature rises in graphite are 6 {{times more than the}} equivalent in water and measurements are more accurate. Significant problems exist in insulating the graphite from the laboratory in order to measure the tiny temperature changes. A lethal dose of radiation to a human is approximately 10-20 Gy. This is 10-20 <b>joules</b> <b>per</b> <b>kilogram.</b> A 1 cm3 piece of graphite weighing 2 grams would therefore absorb around 20-40 mJ. With a specific heat capacity of around 700 J·kg−1·K−1, this equates to a temperature rise of just 20 mK.|$|R
50|$|The {{fundamental}} quantity is the {{absorbed dose}} (D), which {{is defined as}} the mean energy imparted ionising radiation (dE) per unit mass (dm) of material (D = dE/dm) The SI unit of absorbed dose is the gray (Gy) defined as one <b>joule</b> <b>per</b> <b>kilogram.</b> Absorbed dose, as a point measurement, is suitable for describing localised (i.e. partial organ) exposures such as tumour dose in radiotherapy. It may be used to estimate stochastic risk provided the amount and type of tissue involved is stated. Localised diagnostic dose levels are typically in the 0-50 mGy range. At a dose of 1 milligray (mGy) of photon radiation, each cell nucleus is crossed by an average of 1 liberated electron track.|$|R

2500|$|Nanoconcrete {{is created}} by high-energy mixing (HEM) of cement, sand and water. To ensure the mixing is {{thorough}} enough to create nano-concrete, the mixer must apply a total mixing power to the mixture of 30 - 600 watts <b>per</b> <b>kilogram</b> of the mix. [...] This mixing must continue long enough to yield a net specific energy expended upon the mix of at least 5000 <b>joules</b> <b>per</b> <b>kilogram</b> of the mix. A plasticizer or a superplasticizer is then added to the activated mixture which can later be mixed with aggregates in a conventional concrete mixer. In the HEM process, the intense mixing of cement and water with sand provides dissipation of energy and increases shear stresses {{on the surface of}} cement particles. This intense mixing serves to divide the cement particles into extremely fine nanometer scale sizes, which provides for extremely thorough mixing. [...] This results in the increased volume of water interacting with cement and acceleration of Calcium Silicate Hydrate (C-S-H) colloid creation.|$|R

5000|$|The unit {{of actual}} {{exposure}} is the röntgen, defined in ionisations per unit volume of air.

A deposit of 1 <b>joule</b> <b>per</b> <b>kilogram</b> has the unit of 1 gray (Gy). For 1 MeV energy gamma rays, an exposure of 1 röntgen in air produces a dose of about 0.01 gray (1 centigray, cGy) in water or surface tissue.

40|$|We {{investigated}} {{the relationship between}} mechanical and energy cost of transport and body mass in running humans. Ten severely obese (body mass ranging from 108. 5 to 172. 0 kg) and 15 normal-weighted (52. 0 - 89. 0 kg) boys and men, aged 16. 0 - 45. 8 years, participated in this study. The rate of O(2) consumption was measured and the subjects were filmed with four cameras for kinematic analysis, while running on a treadmill at 8 km h(- 1). Mass specific energy cost (C (r)) and external mechanical work (W (ext)) per unit distance were calculated and expressed in <b>joules</b> <b>per</b> <b>kilogram</b> <b>per</b> meter, efficiency (η) was then calculated as W (ext) × C (r) (- 1) × 100.

It necessarily follows that the efficiency is also independent of M (η = - 0. 062 M + 53. 3298, n = 25, R (2) = 0. 05). The results strongly suggest that the elastic tissues of obese subjects can adapt (e. g., thickening) to the increased mass of the body thus maintaining their ability to store elastic energy, at least at 8 km h(- 1) speed, at the same level as the normal-weighted subject...|$|R

40|$|Gelatinous {{zooplankton}} {{populations are}} well known {{for their ability to}} take over perturbed ecosystems. The ability of these animals to outcompete and functionally replace fish that exhibit an effective visual predatory mode is counterintuitive because jellyfish are described as inefficient swimmers that must rely on direct contact with prey to feed. We show that jellyfish exhibit a unique mechanism of passive energy recapture, which is exploited to allow them to travel 30 % further each swimming cycle, thereby reducing metabolic energy demand by swimming muscles. By accounting for large interspecific differences in net metabolic rates, we demonstrate, contrary to prevailing views, that the jellyfish (Aurelia aurita) {{is one of the most}} energetically efficient propulsors on the planet, exhibiting a cost of transport (<b>joules</b> <b>per</b> <b>kilogram</b> <b>per</b> meter) lower than other metazoans. We estimate that reduced metabolic demand by passive energy recapture improves the cost of transport by 48 %, allowing jellyfish to achieve the large sizes required for sufficient prey encounters. Pressure calculations, using both computational fluid dynamics and a newly developed method from empirical velocity field measurements, demonstrate that this extra thrust results from positive pressure created by a vortex ring underneath the bell during the refilling phase of swimming. These results demonstrate a physical basis for the ecological success of medusan swimmers despite their simple body plan.

40|$|This {{dissertation}} {{looks into}} the effects removing recyclable materials has on the calorific value (CV) of municipal solid waste (MSW) feedstock, {{which is due to}} be incinerated (combustion) within an energy from waste (EfW) facility. The removal of individual recyclable materials as well as overall mixed recyclables was considered. The increase of recycling was considered in particular quantities which are in-line with the government targets of 50 % recycling by 2020 and 70 % recycling by 2030. A hypothetical 90 % recycling was also considered following this trend. It was found that the removal of materials from the MSW stream with little energy (such as food and garden waste) allows for a higher CV (MJ/kg, mega <b>joule</b> <b>per</b> <b>kilogram)</b> within the remaining MSW. Alternatively the removal of materials such as plastic which have a higher CV, could cause a reduction in the overall CV of the remaining waste. Overall, if recycling is increased equally across all materials based on the current recycling rates, then the CV is predicted to decrease within the remaining waste in the MSW stream, but not by a substantial amount (less than 1. 2 % change with 70 % recycling). Results also showed that increasing recycling by these amounts decrease the mass of the remaining MSW by 4. 95 % (50 % recycling), 19. 09 % (70 %) and 33. 23 % (90 %) respectively. Financial and environmental factors also considered indicate that increasing recycling is the best overall option for waste disposal.
