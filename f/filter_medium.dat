40|$|The {{present study}} was devoted to the {{experimental}} and numerical investigation of the interaction of a fluid with a deformable <b>filtering</b> <b>medium.</b> Optical tools {{were used for the}} in-situ measurement of the flow-induced deformation of a flat <b>filtering</b> <b>medium</b> in a test channel. Based on a recently developed mathematical model for a poroelastic plate, a numerical method for the coupled simulation of flow and deformation was implemented and validated by comparison with the experimental data.

50|$|Turboswing filters {{can remove}} grease {{particles}} starting from 4μm, {{as opposed to}} 8μm for common filters. This is because the <b>filtering</b> <b>medium</b> is moving, and this increases the probability of collision between the filter and the particle.|$|R

500|$|The first step, {{where the}} wort is {{prepared}} by mixing the starch source (normally malted barley) with hot water, {{is known as}} [...] "mashing". Hot water (known as [...] "liquor" [...] in brewing terms) is mixed with crushed malt or malts (known as [...] "grist") in a mash tun. The mashing process takes around 1 to 2 hours, during which the starches are converted to sugars, and then the sweet wort is drained off the grains. The grains are now washed in {{a process known as}} [...] "sparging". This washing allows the brewer to gather as much of the fermentable liquid from the grains as possible. The process of filtering the spent grain from the wort and sparge water is called wort separation. The traditional process for wort separation is lautering, in which the grain bed itself serves as the <b>filter</b> <b>medium.</b> Some modern breweries prefer the use of filter frames which allow a more finely ground grist.|$|E

Bacteriol. 83 : 1119 – 1123. 1962. —Urease {{activity of}} a number of strains of four Proteus species was compared in a <b>filtered</b> <b>medium</b> and an autoclaved medium. Various amounts of saline suspensions of the organisms were used as inocula for the two media. In some experiments Seitz-filtered yeast extract was added to autoclaved basal urea medium. All tests were incubated at 35 C and read 8, 12, 24, and 48 hr after inoculation. The <b>filtered</b> <b>medium</b> appeared superior to the autoclaved medium, particularly when small inocula were employed. Under these conditions, many tests with all four species were negative in the autoclaved medium at 48 hr, in contrast to 100 % positive reactions in the <b>filtered</b> <b>medium</b> with all species except P. morganii. The experiments in which Seitz-filtered yeast extract was added to autoclaved basal urea medium suggested that both destruction of growth-promoting substances in the yeast extract and production of conditions inhibitory for growth during autoclaving might be involved in the differences observed between the two media...|$|R
50|$|The main {{difference}} between turboswing and most common filters {{is that in}} turboswing <b>filters</b> the <b>filtering</b> <b>medium</b> is not static.

2500|$|While fining clarifies wine by binding to {{suspended}} particles and precipitating out as larger particles, filtration works by passing the wine through a <b>filter</b> <b>medium</b> that captures particles {{larger than the}} medium's holes. Complete filtration may require a series of filtering through progressively finer filters. Many white wines require the removal of all potentially active yeast and/or lactic acid bacteria {{if they are to}} remain reliably stable in bottle, and this is usually now achieved by fine filtration.|$|E

The possibility that C. terreus is able to degrade lycorine and that a degradation product is able to stimulate budding in C. terreus and C. dimennae is discussed. Scanning electron microscopy analysis shows that cells in lycorine-treated cultures of C. terreus are round and smaller than those of the control. Similar differences are found in C. dimennae cells cultured in the <b>filtered</b> <b>medium</b> of C. terreus, whereas they appear identical if directly cultured either with or without lycorine...|$|R

The present research was undertaken with the aim of examining the influence of a conical filtering section made of three different materials on the performance of a Lapple design cyclone. The overall efficiency and pressure drops of the cloth cyclone and a conventional one were compared. The effect of the <b>filtering</b> <b>medium</b> on the behavior of the cyclone was also evaluated using an equation that correlates the cut size diameter with the operational conditions, the properties of the gas-solid system and the resistance of the <b>filtering</b> <b>medium.</b> The experimental results demonstrated that the overall efficiency of the conventional cyclone was similar to that of the proposed device, with the latter displaying a reduction in pressure drop. Consequently, energy costs are lowered when cloth cyclones are used...|$|R

40|$|The {{main purpose}} of {{research}} {{is to determine the}} influence by the small dispersive coal dust particles of the different fractional consistence on the technical characteristics of the vertical iodine air filter at nuclear power plant. The research on the transport properties of the small dispersive coal dust particles in the granular <b>filtering</b> <b>medium</b> of absorber in the vertical iodine air filter is completed in the case, when the modeled aerodynamic conditions are similar to the real aerodynamic conditions. It is shown that the appearance of the different fractional consistence of small dispersive coal dust particles with the decreasing dimensions down to the micro and nano sizes at the action of the air dust aerosol stream normally results in a significant change of distribution of the small dispersive coal dust particles masses in the granular <b>filtering</b> <b>medium</b> of an absorber in the vertical iodine air filter, changing the vertical iodine air filter aerodynamic characteristics. The precise characterization of the aerodynamic resistance of a model of the vertical iodine air filter is completed.
