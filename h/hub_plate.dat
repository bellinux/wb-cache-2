50|$|The {{top link}} is a fixed-length {{half-shaft}} universally jointed at each end. The universal joints act as {{inner and outer}} pivots for the top link, which rotates to transmit drive from its inner pivot at {{the output of the}} differential/brake unit to its outer pivot at the wheel carrier. The wheel carrier {{takes the form of a}} splined stub axle (for knock-off wheels) or a stub axle and <b>hub</b> <b>plate</b> (for 5-lug wheels). In later XJS models with outboard rear brakes, the wheel carrier, brake discs and parking brake drum were a single cast steel unit. In all cases the wheel carrier runs in bearings mounted in a large cast aluminium hub carrier.|$|E
40|$|A prematurely failed <b>hub</b> <b>plate</b> lower made of {{titanium}} alloy {{belonging to the}} tail rotor assembly of a helicopter {{was sent to the}} laboratory for analysis. Examination revealed that a fatigue crack initiated at the web radius region and propagated progressively through thickness. Non-uniform loading was observed on the blade-side surface of the <b>hub</b> <b>plate</b> around the bolt hole corresponding to blade-G. Damages in the form of rubbing were also observed on the inner surface of the <b>hub</b> <b>plate</b> indicating misalignment of this component with the tail rotor shaft. It appears most probable that this misalignment has resulted in assembly stresses leading to fatigue crack initiation. There were no evidences of metallurgical or mechanical abnormalities at the fatigue crack origin. The microstructure of the <b>hub</b> <b>plate</b> lower was found to be satisfactory...|$|E

Fretting was observed on the contacting surfaces of control tube - spider, tail rotor shaft – lower <b>hub</b> <b>plates</b> and <b>hub</b> <b>plates</b> – flex beams.

Analysis suggests that the damages were caused due to problems in the tail rotor side and the most probable reason appears to be vibration. The snubber bearings appear to have failed instantaneously due to sudden overload. This needs further confirmation...|$|R

30|$|Due to {{the lack}} of {{understanding}} in the flow mechanism of the <b>hub</b> <b>plate</b> crown, the current calculation of the disc friction loss and the axial thrust in the centrifugal pump often uses empirical formulas. Research on the flow characteristics of the <b>hub</b> <b>plate</b> crown is of practical significance. The shroud and hub cavities are respectively studied with regard to tangential and radial velocities at the four different angular positions (0 °, 90 °, 180 °, and 270 °) at the four different operational points (0.6 Qsp, 0.8 Qsp, 1.0 Qsp, and 1.2 Qsp). Results indicate that at the same operational point, the smaller the volute chamber sectional area is, the higher the tangential velocity of the fluid core zone of the shroud cavity is. Radial leakage flow from the volute to the seal ring at the same operational point appears in 0 ° and 90 ° direction; when the flow is large, the tangential and radial velocities of the shroud and hub cavities with the same radius tend to be equal with axial symmetry. The axial leakage flow through the balance holes significantly affects the radial distribution of both tangential and radial velocities of fluid flow in the hub cavity. The numerical calculation results of fluid leakage through the clearance of back sealing ring are in good agreement with the test results. Accordingly, the magnitude of leakage is closely related to the fluid pressure and velocity distribution in the <b>hub</b> <b>plate</b> crown of the centrifugal pump. The analysis of the flow characteristics in the <b>hub</b> <b>plate</b> crown of the centrifugal pump could reveal the cause of the disc friction loss from the mechanism, providing a significant guidance for improving the accuracy of calculation and balancing the axial thrust in the centrifugal pump.|$|E
30|$|The fluid {{within the}} flow core {{zone of the}} <b>hub</b> <b>plate</b> crown of a {{centrifugal}} pump was regarded as the research object in this study. Based on a comparative analysis of the numerical results on pump performance and the test results, investigations were conducted on {{the flow of the}} <b>hub</b> <b>plate</b> crown at the 0.6 Qsp, 0.8 Qsp, 1.0 Qsp, and 1.2 Qsp operational points to map the axial center fluid of the back shroud and hub cavities and the radial distribution curves of dimensionless tangential and radial velocities at the four different angular positions (0 °, 90 °, 180 °, and 270 °). The study was also aimed to analyze the radial distribution of the dimensionless tangential and radial velocities of the flow field in the back shroud and hub cavities. The test results of back sealing ring leakage of clearance are utilized to verify the accuracy and feasibility of the numerical research (Additional file 1).|$|E
30|$|In an {{impeller}} with balance holes of the double-sealing ring structure in a centrifugal pump, the <b>hub</b> <b>plate</b> crown of the impeller {{is divided into}} a shroud cavity and a hub cavity by the sealing ring. The calculation of round disk friction loss and axial thrust {{is closely related to}} the flow in the <b>hub</b> <b>plate</b> crown. Research on the shroud cavity, hub cavity, and sealing ring leakage has revealed the mechanism of the internal round disk friction loss and axial thrust of the centrifugal pump. Yang et al. [1] pointed out that disc friction loss calculated by the conventional method would produce more errors since it only considered the friction torque of the impeller at its periphery but ignored the major part at the <b>hub</b> <b>plate</b> crown and sealing ring. In the derivation of the axial thrust calculation formula, under the assumption that no fluid leakage flow exists in the <b>hub</b> <b>plate</b> crown and the fluid rotational angular velocity within the shroud cavity is half of the impeller rotational angular velocity, no rotating motion of the hub cavity fluid exists within the sealing ring [2 – 4]. Salvadori et al. [5] pointed out that the cavity flow behavior is a key parameter for the pressure field evaluation and then for the thrust calculation. Over the pump operating range the main contribution to the axial thrust is due to the impellers flow fields, the leakage flows through sealing rings and the pressure distribution that occurs inside the cavities between impeller shrouds and pump stationary walls. Test results on disk friction loss or axial thrust calculated in terms of the theoretical formula in fluid flow velocity in the shroud cavity did not match the results of practical tests [6]. To calculate the axial thrust of centrifugal pump with higher accuracy, Liu et al. [7, 8] developed a mathematical model of the shroud cavity liquid pressure on the design condition by simplifying the Navier–Stokes equations for the movement of cavity fluid. The results of liquid pressure test verified the reliability of the model. The study of Mu et al. [9] showed that the pump clearance leakage flow has significant influence on the flow field in the <b>hub</b> <b>plate</b> crown. The angular velocity of the fluid in the back shroud cavity is less than 0.5 times the angular velocity of impeller. Besides, compared with the experiment result, the axial thrust was found underestimated by the conventional formula. Research has shown that both cavities velocity field in the shroud and hub and the axial changing laws in the centrifugal pump are similar to the velocity field in the enclosed cylinder body [10 – 12]. That is, in the fluid flow velocity of the shroud and hub cavities, a turbulent boundary layer exists near the outer wall of the rotating impeller back shroud. Near the internal wall of the fixed motionless pump shroud, a flow core zone exists along the axial direction without significant changes between two boundary layers [13 – 15]. The flow core zone is the main region of fluid within the shroud and hub cavities. It occupies over two-thirds of the axial distance, whereby the fluid flow conditions within the shroud and hub cavities can be reflected.|$|E

When a back torque comes from the transmission, the splined hub slides up the bearing ramps, disconnecting from the clutch plates and allowing a limited slip between input and output.|$|R

Shortly after this the dashboard was redesigned to incorporate a (very small) glove box. For 1948 the wheels were embellished with chrome <b>plated</b> <b>hub</b> caps and the car received redesigned hydraulic shock absorbers (which {{turned out to be}} of the design recently finalised for the forthcoming new 203 model).|$|R
40|$|A {{rotatable}} disc {{is described}} {{that consists of}} parallel plates tightly joined together for rotation about a <b>hub.</b> Each <b>plate</b> is provided with several angularly projecting spaced lands. The lands of each plate are interposed in alternating relationship between the lands of the next adjacent plate. In this manner, circumferential displacement of adjacent sectors in any one plate is prevented {{in the event that}} a crack develops. Each plate is redundantly sized so that, in event of structural failure of one plate, the remaining plates support a proportionate share of the load of the failed plate. The plates are prevented from separating laterally through the inclusion of generally radially extending splines which are inserted to interlock cooperating, circumferentially adjacent lands...|$|R
40|$|Most modern {{vehicles}} have {{protective covers}} such as skid plates and belly pans {{that cover the}} majority of the undercarriage. Therefore, specific jack points exist on each corner of these vehicles. A jack can be placed on these points to safely lift the vehicle up without damaging any plastic covers. However, this poses a problem for the DIY mechanic. The jack point usually does not leave enough room for a jack and a jack stand. The objective of the Automotive Hub Stand Design project was to design an affordable alternative to the traditional jack stand that can be mounted directly to the hub of the vehicle using the factory lug pattern and nuts. The goal was to create a universal system that could be used on any vehicle. This was accomplished by utilizing an interchangeable <b>Hub</b> <b>Plate</b> Member that can be manufactured for specific vehicles. For the scope of this project, one <b>hub</b> <b>plate</b> member that incorporates both Subaru and Audi vehicles was manufactured. Column buckling and shear force calculations as well as material strength analysis was completed for this project. The Automotive Hub Stand was modeled using Solidworks and manufactured out of 6061 Aluminum. All of the parts were completed with the resources available at CWU’s machine and welding shops. The Hub Stand was designed to hold up 1. 5 tons and cost under $ 300. The project was a success in regards to the set requirements in cost, usability (ease of use), dimensions and load/capacity requirements...|$|E
40|$|Abstract. A {{pressure}} plate, {{a component}} of the clutch system, was analyzed by two-dimensional and three-dimensional finite element method under three major load conditions of thermal loading due to temperature distribution, centrifugal force and contact pressure of diaphragm spring. The results show that the effects of thermal loading and contact pressure of diaphragm spring are important, which suggests the direction of design improvement. A <b>hub</b> <b>plate</b> was also analyzed with finite element modeling. A stress concentration occurs around the fillet region around the window in the plate where the fracture analysis is executed to find the stress intensity factors. These results will be used as the fundamental data for design improvement of the shapes of pressure plates and hub plates...|$|E

40|$|Autonomous {{underwater}} vehicle propulsion has been primarily driven by conventional thruster arrangements and control fins. The {{development of a}} collective and cyclic pitch propeller system provides a highly maneuverable alternative to these conventional designs. Therefore, a computer controlled and fully actuated collective and cyclic pitch propeller was designed and fabricated to fulfill this need. [...] The new propeller was designed using a helicopter like linkage system. The swash plates mounted inside of the propeller housing, as opposed to propeller hub like a helicopter. Locating the linkages in the housing provided a more maintainable system of linkages, due to space limitations in the propeller <b>hub.</b> The swash <b>plate</b> was positioned using three ball screw electric actuators using absolute positioning feedback. The swash plate position was transmitted to the propeller hub {{by a set of}} four control rods, one for each blade. Four blades were chosen for the propeller to reduce pulsing of the propeller when operating in cyclic mode. [...] Initial testing of the prototype demonstrates the propeller's potential ability to control the {{underwater vehicle}} at little or no forward speed. While operating in the 50 % ahead, 100 % to port condition, a thrust value of 26. 7 N (6 lbf) with a turning moment of 18. 9 Nm (168 in-lb) was measured. The turning moment generated at a forward speed of 1. 6 m/s was sufficient to turn the C-SCOUT vehicle in 38 % of the present required turning circle using a conventional thruster and control fins...|$|R
50|$|A typical ship's {{wheel is}} {{composed}} of eight cylindrical wooden spokes (though sometimes as few as six or as many as ten) shaped like balusters and all joined at a central wooden hub or nave (sometimes covered with a brass nave plate) which housed the axle. The square hole at {{the centre of the}} hub through which the axle ran is called the drive square and was often lined with a brass plate (and therefore called a brass boss, though this term was used more often to refer to a brass <b>hub</b> and nave <b>plate)</b> which was frequently etched with the name of the wheel's manufacturer. The outer rim {{is composed of}} sections each made up of stacks of three felloes, the facing felloe, the middle felloe, and the after felloe. Because each group of three felloes at one time made up a quarter of the distance around the rim, the entire outer wooden wheel was sometimes called the quadrant. Each spoke ran through the middle felloe creating a series of handles beyond the wheel's rim. One of these handles/ spokes was frequently provided with extra grooves at its tip which could be felt by a helmsman steering in the dark and used by him to determine the exact position of the rudder—this was the king spoke and when it pointed straight upward the rudder was believed to be dead straight to the hull. The completed ship's wheel and associated axle and pedestal(s) might even be taller than the person using it. The wood used in construction of this type of wheel was most often either teak or mahogany, both of which are very durable tropical hardwoods capable of surviving the effects of salt water spray and regular use without significant decomposition.|$|R
