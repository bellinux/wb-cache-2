40|$|We {{study the}} {{dependence}} of the transport properties of square Josephson Junctions arrays with {{the direction of the}} applied dc current, both experimentally and numerically. We present computational simulations of current-voltage curves at finite temperatures for a single vortex in the array (Ha^ 2 /Φ_ 0 =f= 1 /L^ 2), and experimental measurements in 100 × 1000 arrays under a low magnetic field corresponding to f≈ 0. 02. We find that the transverse voltage vanishes only in the directions of maximum symmetry of the square lattice: the [10] and [01] direction (parallel bias) and the [11] direction (<b>diagonal</b> <b>bias).</b> For orientations different than the symmetry directions, we find a finite transverse voltage which depends strongly on the angle ϕ of the current. We find that vortex motion is pinned in the [10] direction (ϕ= 0), meaning that the voltage response is insensitive to small changes in the orientation of the current near ϕ= 0. We call this phenomenon orientational pinning. This leads to a finite transverse critical current for a bias at ϕ= 0 and to a transverse voltage for a bias at ϕ= 0. On the other hand, for <b>diagonal</b> <b>bias</b> in the [11] direction the behavior is highly unstable against small variations of ϕ, leading to a rapid change from zero transverse voltage to a large transverse voltage within a few degrees. This last behavior is in good agreement with our measurements in arrays with a quasi-diagonal current drive. Comment: 9 pages, 9 figure...|$|E
40|$|Tversky and Schiano (1989) found a {{systematic}} bias toward the 45 -deg line in memory for {{the slopes of}} identical lines when embedded in graphs, but not in maps, suggesting {{the use of a}} cognitive reference frame specifically for encoding meaningful graphs. The present experiments explore this issue further using the linear configurations alone as stimuli. Experiments 1 and 2 demonstrate that perception and immediate memory for the slope of a test line within orthogonal 'axes' are predictable from purely structural considerations. In Experiments 3 and 4, subjects were instructed to use a diagonal-reference strategy in viewing the stimuli, which were described as 'graphs' only in Experiment 3. Results for both studies showed the <b>diagonal</b> <b>bias</b> previously found only for graphs. This pattern provides converging evidence for the diagonal as a cognitive reference frame in encoding linear graphs, and demonstrates that even in highly simplified displays, strategic factors can produce encoding biases not predictable solely from stimulus structure alone...|$|E
40|$|OBJECTIVE—To {{determine}} whether stroke patients with diagonal neglect on cancellation may show diagonal neglect on line bisection, and hence {{to indicate whether}} diagonal neglect may be related solely {{to the type of}} test used or whether instead it may reflect a fundamental spatial disorder.  METHODS—Nine patients with subacute right hemispheric stroke who neglected targets primarily in the near left direction on line cancellation bisected diagonal lines of two opposing orientations: near left to far right and far left to near right. The errors were assessed to {{determine whether}} line orientation significantly affected bisection error.  RESULTS—Eight patients had significant bisection errors. One of these showed no effect of line orientation on error, consistent with lateral neglect. The remaining seven patients had a line orientation effect, indicating a net diagonal spatial bias. For the group, cancellation errors were significantly correlated with the line orientation effect on bisection errors.  CONCLUSIONS—A significant <b>diagonal</b> <b>bias</b> on two tests of spatial attention may appear in stroke patients, although the directions of the biases may differ within individual patients. None the less, diagonal neglect may be a fundamental spatial attentional disturbance of right hemispheric stroke. Greater severity of stroke deficit as indicated by cancellation error score may be associated with a greater degree of diagonal neglect on line bisection. ...|$|E

40|$|Oblique {{incidence}} {{performance of}} an active square loop frequency selective surface (FSS) is investigated. The design shows a stable frequency response for both parallel (TM) and perpendicular (TE) polarizations for incidence angles up to 60 �. Four PIN diodes have been placed orthogonal {{to each other in}} the FSS unit cell to provide a stable frequency response for both TE and TM. To minimise the effect of bias lines on the overall frequency response, a <b>diagonal</b> DC <b>bias</b> line, which is connected to the centre of the FSS unit cell, has been placed on the rear surface of the dielectric substrate. The design has good isolation between transmission and reflection states, which are controlled electronically by switching PIN diodes between ON and OFF states.

40|$|Graduation date: 1992 Mercury cadmium {{telluride}} {{is important in}} the detection of electromagnetic radiation in the eight to twelve micron atmospheric window for infrared imaging systems. High resolution infrared imaging systems use either large (256 x 256 element to 1024 x 1024 element) staring arrays or much smaller (1 - 6 element) scanned arrays in which the image is optically scanned across the detectors. In scanned arrays, high resolution and sensitivity may result in the scan direction not being parallel to the detector bias current. The response of an infrared detector to uniform illumination is investigated. It is found that variations in the detector thickness result in significant changes in output voltage. Scanned detectors are modeled in five different orientations; scan parallel to bias, scan opposite to bias, scan perpendicular to bias, and two orientations of the scan <b>diagonal</b> to the <b>bias.</b> The response is analyzed for two cases: 1) the size of the scanned radiation equal {{to the size of the}} detector and 2) when the pixel width is half of the width of the detector, but of equal length. Results of the simulation show that the fastest response occurs when the scan and bias are parallel. The largest response occurs when the scan direction is <b>diagonal</b> to the <b>bias,</b> but the response time is much slower than when the bias is parallel to the scan. Therefore, a tradeoff must be made between maximum signal and speed of response. Test detectors are being fabricated and will be tested at FLIR Systems Inc., Portland, Oregon, to confirm the model predictions...|$|R
40|$|In {{this thesis}} we study {{the roles of}} microtubules at the plasma {{membrane}} and the cellulose microfibrils in the cell wall {{and how they are}} organized. This topic is introduces in chapter 1. In chapter 2 we study the formation of the transverse cortical microtubule array that is characteristic for elongating plant cells. We found that the cortical microtubule array starts ordered, and that the first direction of microtubule order is not transverse to the axis of cell elongation but have a <b>diagonal</b> <b>bias.</b> Quantification of the orientation of microtubule nucleations revealed a significant <b>diagonal</b> <b>bias,</b> which we confirmed by simulations to be sufficient to explain the initial diagonal order. We found that during disassembly the microtubules also showed a <b>diagonal</b> <b>bias</b> and a significant amount of early microtubule nucleations were not generated from γ-TuRC microtubule nucleating complexes. This led to the idea that a proportion of the initial nucleations stem from small microtubule fragments of preexisting microtubules that remained at the cell cortex during cytokinesis or drug induced microtubule disassembly. We showed with simulations that this type of nucleation has the capacity to increase the speed with which the cortical microtubule array is reformed. In chapter 3 we investigate the trafficking of cellulose synthase complexes from assembly in the Golgi system to their insertion into the plasma membrane. We find that the actin cytoskeleton is important for the global distribution of Golgi bodies, which in turn is important for the global distribution of cellulose synthase complexes in the plasma membrane. Cellulose synthase complexes were inserted into the membrane preferentially at locations where cortical microtubules were present. We showed that osmotic stress and a number of cellulose synthesis inhibitors blocked cellulose synthase insertion into the plasma membrane. The cellulose synthase complex containing compartments were seemingly still being delivered to the cortical microtubules where they accumulated. These compartments tracked depolymerizing microtubule ends. When the osmotic stress was relieved, cellulose sythase complex insertion was resumed from these compartments. Rapid movement of proteins, organelles and metabolites in the cytoplasm of plant cells depends on the actin cytoskeleton, whereas microtubules are important in regulating the location of proteins and cellular processes. In chapter 4 we found physical interactions between cortical microtubules and actin. We also found that the formation of the actin cytoskeleton after washing out the actin depolymerizing drug latrunculin B was dependent on the presence of microtubules. In the presence of cortical microtubules, new actin filaments initiated on and in the direction of cortical microtubules. In chapter 5 we investigate the mechanism reorientation of the cortical microtubule array from transverse to longitudinal in response to light signaling. We found that cortical microtubule array reorientation in dark grown hypocotyl cells was regulated by phototropin a blue light photoreceptor. We found that microtubule reorientation was delayed in phot 1 phot 2 mutants. We also found that ktn 1 - 1, a null mutant of KATANIN P 60, and spr 3, a GCP 2 allele with impaired function, severely retarded microtubule array reorientation in response to light. spry has altered angles of microtubule nucleation relative to the mother polymer, and ktn 1 - 1 abolishes liberation of microtubules form their nucleation complexes to yield treadmilling polymers and microtubule severing at microtubule crossovers. We found that in response to blue light, the proportion of microtubule nucleations branching at 40 degrees from the mother microtubule to nucleation at 0 degrees from the mother microtubule was higher in wild type plant than in the phot 1 phot 2 mutant. We also found that the chance of microtubule severing at microtubule crossovers was significanlty higher in wild type than in the phot 1 phot 2 mutant. We propose that upregulation of the branching nucleations is needed to create a number of longitudinally oriented microtubules. These microtubules make a large number of crossovers with the existing transverse array and have an increased chance of being severed. Severing events that result in a stable new tip contribute to the increase in longitudinal microtubule order and ultimately lead to complete reorientation from transverse to longitudinal. The spatial organization of cortical microtubules and cellulose microfibrils are essential for plant morphogenesis, but the mechanism by which is unclear. Chapter 6 discusses the process of cell elongation and offers possible additional roles for cortical microtubules beyond guiding cellulose microfibril deposition in this process...|$|E
40|$|The ordered {{arrangement}} of cortical microtubules in growing plant cells {{is essential for}} anisotropic cell expansion and, hence, for plant morphogenesis. These arrays are dismantled when the microtubule cytoskeleton is rearranged during mitosis and reassembled following completion of cytokinesis. The reassembly of the cortical array has often been considered as initiating from a state of randomness, from which order arises at least partly through self-organizing mechanisms. However, some studies have shown evidence for ordering at early stages of array assembly. To investigate how cortical arrays are initiated in higher plant cells, we performed live-cell imaging studies of cortical array assembly in tobacco (Nicotiana tabacum) Bright Yellow- 2 cells after cytokinesis and drug-induced disassembly. We found that cortical arrays in both cases did not initiate randomly but with a significant overrepresentation of microtubules at diagonal angles {{with respect to the}} cell axis, which coincides with the predominant orientation of the microtubules before their disappearance from the cell cortex in preprophase. In Arabidopsis (Arabidopsis thaliana) root cells, recovery from drug-induced disassembly was also nonrandom and correlated with the organization of the previous array, although no <b>diagonal</b> <b>bias</b> was observed in these cells. Surprisingly, during initiation, only about one-half of the new microtubules were nucleated from locations marked by green fluorescent protein-¿-tubulin complex protein 2 -tagged ¿-nucleation complexes (¿-tubulin ring complex), therefore indicating that a large proportion of early polymers was initiated by a noncanonical mechanism not involving ¿-tubulin ring complex. Simulation studies indicate that the high rate of noncanonical initiation of new microtubules has the potential to accelerate the rate of array repopulation...|$|E
40|$|In this paper, {{the problem}} of {{designing}} an advanced sensor validation system (SVS) which is robust and fault-tolerant under faulty conditions is considered. Associative memories, which provide robust pattern recognition are investigated as an information processing technology {{that can be applied}} to sensor validation. Studies of Binary Associative Memories (BAM) and Continuous Associative Memories (CAM) yield many results including (1) the stability condition of exemplars and spurious memories in BAMs, (2) the formula of choosing <b>diagonal</b> weights and <b>bias</b> that eliminates spurious memories most effectively in BAMs, (3) the convergence theory of CAMs that have asymmetric weight matrix with non-zero diagonal elements and non-monotonically increasing activation functions, (4) the energy function that explores the convergence behavior of CAMs, and (5) the hybrid learning algorithm that reduces spurious memories effectively in CAMs. The concept of performability is introduced to the evaluation of SVS. A set of important performability variables is introduced. Stochastic Activity Networks are used as a modeling tool to evaluate the performability of SVS. An illustration example, the evaluation of the pressurizer SVS of a PWR, is provided...|$|R
40|$|The {{purpose of}} the present study is to discuss the {{practical}} seaming conditions when making clothings of knitted cotton cloth. The experimental conditions were as follows: the author used four seaming directions such as wale (crossing), course (horizontal), <b>bias</b> (<b>diagonal),</b> and a combination of wale and bias; a combination of two Kinds of threads; a combination of three kinds of thread elasticity; three kinds of seawing machine needles; three kinds of seams; five repetitions of testing; and two hundred and seventy trials per direction. The author measured the tearing strength and elongation on the seamed. parts according to the JIS Standards by using an elongation tester. The values of seaming effects* and at-test were calculated by variance analysis on the basis of the strength of original cloth. The results show that the numder of seams had a significant effect on seaming in each direction. And few tearings were found under such a condition as five seams/cm in which the threads of cotton and nylon were used, while any thread elasticity did not necessarily have a significant effect on seamig. Such a combination of different seaming directions as wale and bias had an effect of less than seventy percent on seaming. *Seamig effects (%) = (Strength of the seaming of testing cloth / Strength of original cloth) × 10...|$|R
