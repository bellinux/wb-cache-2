500|$|At {{the ball}} Ryder {{addresses}} the members and tells them 'Liza Jane's story. At the conclusion, he asks the attendees {{whether or not}} they think the man should acknowledge his wife. Everyone urges yes. He brings out 'Liza and says, [...] "Ladies and gentlemen, this is the woman, and I am the man, whose story I <b>have</b> <b>told</b> <b>you.</b> Permit me to introduce to you the wife of my youth." ...|$|E
500|$|The preview {{version of}} the episode {{supplied}} {{to the press and}} aired at the press launch omitted the scene that features Rose; before broadcast, only the production team, Tate, and Tennant had seen the scene. The scene contains Rose's departure theme, [...] "Doomsday". Tennant commented [...] "on the night of transmission... the Radio Times won't <b>have</b> <b>told</b> <b>you</b> it's coming, it'll come as a genuine prickle up the spine".|$|E
500|$|Also at WonderCon, {{a poster}} {{based on the}} season was made available, with art by Mike McKone. It {{features}} Johnson, her pose an homage to a well-known Secret Warriors cover depicting the comic version of the character, with other main characters paired behind her (Coulson and Price, the latter because [...] "she really {{was a big part}} of the first half of the season and...her death is the thing [...] drives Coulson", according to Bell; Fitz and Simmons; Hunter and Morse; May and Garner / Lash; and Mack and Elena Rodriguez). Lincoln is featured on his own, so as not to [...] "take a super strong female character [...] and reduce her to being a part of a relationship where she won't be fulfilled until she finds her man", as are Ward / Hive and Malick, the latter with the symbol of the former upon him: [...] "We <b>have</b> <b>told</b> <b>you</b> who Ward's become, and Hive is the person that Malick is really in a relationship with. So the fact that reflection is on him or in him or around him is pretty potent," [...] explained Bell.|$|E
6000|$|... "Daggett <b>has</b> <b>told</b> <b>you</b> this, Deacon Pratt"--said Gardiner, in his off-hand way. [...] "And {{he is the}} man who <b>has</b> <b>told</b> <b>you</b> {{of those}} sealing-islands too?" ...|$|R

2500|$|... "As I <b>have</b> <b>told</b> <b>you</b> before, {{the thing}} needed in this Age is work (karma). In every Age people have reached {{salvation}} through {{different types of}} action and sadhana (spiritual discipline), but in this Age one can reach liberation only through hard work. I want real, practical human beings and only he is a true human being who lives in accordance with this Age. We need not consider religion or caste, but look only to hard work." ...|$|E
2500|$|Mafia boss Tommaso Buscetta, whose testimonies as a collaborating witness {{during the}} Maxi Trial had been {{instrumental}} to convict many Mafia bosses, {{refused to talk}} about the relationship between Cosa Nostra and politicians. He told Giovanni Falcone one of the prosecutors at the Maxi Trial: [...] "I <b>have</b> <b>told</b> <b>you</b> repeatedly that I would not discuss it until and if the time is ripe. It would be extremely foolish to discuss this subject - which is the crucial knot of the Mafia problem - while the very people whom we would be discussing remain fully active on the political scene." ...|$|E
2500|$|My father, after I had {{finished}} saying what I have repeated above, {{looked at me}} a moment, raised his hand above his head and slowly said, with tears glistening in his eyes: [...] "My son, I can swear before high heaven that what I <b>have</b> <b>told</b> <b>you</b> {{about the origin of}} [...] is true. Your mother and sister, Mrs. Athalia Robinson, were present when that book was handed to me in Mentor, Ohio, and all I ever knew about the origin of [...] was what Parley P. Pratt, Oliver Cowdery, Joseph Smith and the witnesses who claimed they saw the plates have told me, and in all of my intimacy with Joseph Smith he never told me but one story." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "My father's {{confession}} <b>has</b> <b>told</b> <b>you</b> who I am; {{and my own}} confession <b>has</b> <b>told</b> <b>you</b> what my {{life has}} been," [...] he said, addressing Mr. Brock, without taking the chair to which the rector pointed. [...] "I promised to make a clean breast of it when I first asked leave to enter this room. Have I kept my word?" ...|$|R

2500|$|This theory {{contradicts the}} {{testimony}} of Rigdon to his son John, just prior to his death and long after he had ceased an affiliation {{with any of the}} sects of Mormonism: [...] "My father, after I had finished saying what I have repeated above, looked at me a moment, raised his hand above his head and slowly said, with tears glistening in his eyes: 'My son, I can swear before high heaven that what I <b>have</b> <b>told</b> <b>you</b> about the origin of [...] is true.

2500|$|Criticisms of the CoT {{began with}} its first tests, with the {{magazine}} Speedway Illustrated noting the car's {{poor performance in}} traffic (February 2006 issue). [...] The Winston-Salem Journal also noted extensive criticism of the project during 2006 testing, with drivers becoming more vocal by July 2007 and most fans rejecting the model, citing the falsity of many of its technical claims; one angle of criticism was the differing philosophies of NASCAR officials Gary Nelson and John Darby, with Darby a particularly ardent supporter of the CoT based on a misreading of the sport's competition packages. Jeff Gordon and Matt Kenseth were pointedly critical of the car's poor performance in traffic, with Gordon stating after the 2007 New England 300, [...] "I'd like to {{know who it was}} who said this car would reduce the aero push because I could <b>have</b> <b>told</b> <b>you</b> from when I first drove this car that it would be worse." [...] Kyle Busch, who won the very first race with the car at Bristol in 2007, proclaimed that the car [...] "sucks" [...] afterward and expanded on this criticism at Dover in 2008 in noting how the CoT was [...] "hitting a wall of air" [...] {{in the wake of a}} leading car, thus neutralizing ability to close up on leaders.|$|E
2500|$|The Court {{warned the}} {{students}} not to delay contacting their families because the Court {{was going to}} write them promptly. Dean Greenough wrote to Roberts: [...] "The letter that I am sending to your father this morning, although it does not tell him everything, necessitates your telling him everything." [...] To Kenneth Day he wrote: [...] "It {{would be better for}} them to hear it from you than from me." [...] The Dean's letters about students who had committed no overt act explained the circumstances at length and provided he Court's rationale for expulsion in such cases: [...] "The acts in question are so unspeakably gross that the intimates of those who commit these acts become tainted." [...] He made a clear distinction by not criticizing such a student's character, but his judgment, calling him [...] "no worse than ignorant, over-curious, and careless." [...] When it came to those who had engaged in homosexual sex, Greenough withheld details yet tried to underscore the significance of the violation. To Roberts' father, Greenough wrote that his son [...] "has promised to tell you all about the matter, and I hope he will tell you the whole truth. His offense {{has nothing to do with}} low scholarship; it is not gambling, or drink or ordinary sexual intercourse. If he does not confess to something worse than these things, he will not <b>have</b> <b>told</b> <b>you</b> the whole story." ...|$|E

6000|$|... "I {{dare say}} {{she knows what}} is good for you better than you know {{yourself}}. I suppose she <b>has</b> <b>told</b> <b>you</b> that you might do a great deal better than trouble yourself with a wife?" ...|$|R

6000|$|... 'And how did {{you know}} I was here?' inquired Mary. 'Who could <b>have</b> <b>told</b> <b>you</b> that I took another service at Ipswich, and that they {{afterwards}} moved all the way here? Who COULD <b>have</b> <b>told</b> <b>you</b> that, Mr. Weller?' ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I {{meant to}} <b>have</b> <b>told</b> <b>you,</b> of course, Mary,--to <b>have</b> <b>told</b> <b>you</b> everything; but I {{did not mean}} to tell it to-night; only it has somehow fallen from me. Out of the full heart the mouth speaks, they say." ...|$|E

Why does atherosclerosis develop in the first place? This disease is often the result of many factors. The 5 most im-portant risk factors are (1) tobacco smoking, (2) diabetes mellitus, (3) a familial tendency to develop this con-dition, (4) high blood pressure, and (5) an abnormally high cholesterol level in the blood.

6000|$|... "If I <b>have</b> <b>told</b> <b>you</b> once {{about your}} detestable habit of {{shouting}} in the house, Clarence, I <b>have</b> <b>told</b> <b>you</b> a hundred times.
