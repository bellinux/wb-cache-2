5|$|Shamanism was the {{dominant}} {{religion of the}} Jurchen people of northeast Asia and of their descendants, the Manchu people. As early as the Jin dynasty (1111–1234), the Jurchens conducted shamanic ceremonies at shrines called tangse. There were two kinds of shamans: those who entered <b>in</b> <b>a</b> <b>trance</b> and let themselves be possessed by the spirits, and those who conducted regular sacrifices to heaven, to a clan's ancestors, or to the clan's protective spirits.|$|E
5|$|There is a {{story about}} an aloviti man, who is {{described}} as unusually tall, thin, bony-faced, and with a long beard and moustache. When the weather was nice, he worked and behaved like the other people in his village, {{but as soon as the}} dark clouds covered the sky, he used to close himself in his house, put blinds on the windows, and remain alone and <b>in</b> <b>a</b> <b>trance</b> as long as the bad weather and thunder lasted. Historical persons believed to be aloviti men are Stefan Nemanja, and Stefan Dečanski.|$|E

Archer meets the merchant, Zjod, a slaver who tries to sell him a female called Rajiin. Archer refuses and leaves, but Rajiin chases after him. Following a fight between Archer and Zjod, the away team leave with Rajiin, and Archer promises to return her to her home planet. Later she approaches Archer in his quarters, and as she nears him she puts him <b>in</b> <b>a</b> <b>trance,</b> and he no longer remembers her visit. Meanwhile, T'Pol and Tucker attempt to replicate the chemical from B'Rat's formula but the first attempt fails.|$|E

5|$|The Sihanaka {{share the}} belief common {{throughout}} the island that {{the spirits of}} ancestors can possess the living, placing them <b>in</b> <b>a</b> <b>trance</b> state called a tromba. The Sihanaka traditionally believe that looking at a cuckoo roller (an indigenous bird) will induce the tromba. Communities look to ombiasy (wise men) for spiritual guidance, to commune with the ancestors, and to determine which days are auspicious for undertaking particular tasks or endeavors. By the 1600s, a uniform religious belief system had grown around a group of sampy (idols) believed to channel the protective spiritual power of 11 deities. The origin of these amulets {{is said to have}} been in the western territories under Sakalava control.|$|E
25|$|Professor Trelawney first {{appears in}} the third book of the series, when Harry, Ron, and Hermione start divination lessons. The friends {{generally}} believe Professor Trelawney is a fraud. However, Gryffindor students Parvati Patil and Lavender Brown are very fond of and impressed by her. According to Professor McGonagall, her credibility as a Seer is undermined by her habit of erroneously predicting, each year, {{the death of one}} of her students. Her more profound predictions seem only to happen when she is <b>in</b> <b>a</b> <b>trance</b> and unaware of what she is saying, with no memory of it afterward. However, almost all her predictions were later to be shown true in the books even if she was not <b>in</b> <b>a</b> <b>trance.</b>|$|E
25|$|Religious scriptures {{suggest that}} the Llü-bu were female shamans who practised divination, exorcism, and other rites <b>in</b> <b>a</b> <b>trance.</b> By the early nineteenth century, the Dongba priests had created a huge {{religious}} vocabulary accompanied {{by a variety of}} rituals, and had largely displaced the Llü-bu. This is certainly the case with Yi shamans, but the connection to dongba practices remains unclear.|$|E

25|$|Spiritualists often set March 31, 1848 as the {{beginning}} of their movement. On that date, Kate and Margaret Fox, of Hydesville, reported that they had made contact with the spirit of a murdered peddler. What made this an extraordinary event was that the spirit communicated through audible rapping noises, rather than simply appearing to a person <b>in</b> <b>a</b> <b>trance.</b> The evidence of the senses appealed to practical Americans, and the Fox sisters became a sensation. Demonstrations of mediumship (seances and automatic writing, for example) proved to be a profitable business, and soon became popular forms of entertainment and spiritual catharsis. The Foxes earned a living this way, as did many others.|$|E
25|$|In 1900, on the {{occasion}} of the festival of Eid ul-Adha, he is said to have delivered an hour-long sermon extempore in Arabic expounding the meaning and philosophy of sacrifice. This episode is celebrated as one of the important events of the history of Ahmadiyya. The sermon was simultaneously written down by two of his companions and came to be known as the Khutba Ilhamiyya, the revealed or inspired sermon. Ahmadiyya literature states that during this sermon, there was a change in his voice, he appeared as if <b>in</b> <b>a</b> <b>trance,</b> in the grip of an unseen hand, and as if a voice from the unknown had made him its mouthpiece. After the sermon ended, Ahmad fell into prostration, followed by the rest of the congregation, as a sign of gratitude towards God.|$|E
25|$|The {{tensions}} {{led to an}} rising named Ogun Olomiro (Salt Water War) by the Kosoko faction in July 1845. The Kosoko faction laid siege to the Oba's Palace {{for three}} weeks. Akitoye eventually accepted defeat, escaped up the lagoon to the north, and was granted safe passage through the Agboyi Creek by Oshodi Tapa, Kosoko's war captain. Oshodi Tapa explained Akitoye's escape to Kosoko by saying that Akitoye put his enemies <b>in</b> <b>a</b> <b>trance.</b> Akitoye thereafter arrived in Abeokuta where he was granted asylum. Recognizing Akitoye's escape as a threat, Kosoko demanded Akitoye's head from the Egbas who refused Kosoko's demands. In March 1945, the Egbas provided the now deposed Akitoye with an escort to Badagry, the traditional town of refuge for Lagosians where he rallied his followers and built a partnership with European missionaries and with the British through their Consul John Beecroft.|$|E

25|$|Casaubon has {{a romance}} with a Brazilian woman named Amparo. He leaves Italy {{to follow her}} and spends a few years in Brazil. While living there, he learns about South American and Caribbean spiritualism, and meets Agliè, an elderly man who implies {{that he is the}} mystical Comte de Saint-Germain. Agliè has a {{seemingly}} infinite supply of knowledge about things concerning the Occult. While in Brazil, Casaubon receives a letter from Belbo about attending a meeting of occultists. At the meeting Belbo was reminded of the Colonel's conspiracy theory by the words of a young woman who was apparently <b>in</b> <b>a</b> <b>trance.</b> Casaubon and Amparo also attend an occult event in Brazil, an Umbanda rite. During the ritual Amparo falls into a trance herself, an experience she finds deeply disturbing and embarrassing, as she is Marxist by ideology and as such disbelieves and shuns spiritual and religious experiences. Her relationship with Casaubon falls apart, and he returns to Italy.|$|E
25|$|In June 1985, tragedy strikes for the Osmans when Sue awakes to {{discover}} baby Hassan laying motionless in his cot. Sue and Ali rush his lifeless body to local nurse, Andy O'Brien (Ross Davidson), but Hassan is already dead. A postmortem reveals no definitive cause of death, {{so it is}} concluded that he died during his sleep from cot death. After discovering Hassan's body, Sue goes into shock. She remains <b>in</b> <b>a</b> <b>trance</b> like state for weeks, refusing to eat, sleep, cry or acknowledge her own grief. She later begins blaming herself unfairly for her son's sudden and unexplainable death. Her mental health continues to deteriorate and she becomes despondent towards Ali; their marriage disintegrates in a welter of depression. Sue eventually manages {{to come to terms}} with Hassan's death with the help of Dr Legg (Leonard Fenton), who takes the desperate measure of placing Mary's baby, Annie, in her lap, allowing her, finally, to acknowledge her pent-up sadness.|$|E

She dances <b>in</b> <b>a</b> <b>trance</b> and empties another cup, which is filled by the ghost of Candaules, who {{suddenly}} tears the crown from her head. Terrified, she swoons and Gyges hurries to her side and endeavours to lead her to her throne, but again, the ghost appears. Nisia, panic-stricken, runs among the dancers, who cannot see the reason for her fear. At last, exhausted, she falls in Gyges's arms, but the ghost points to his grave, where he awaits his guilty wife. A deathly pallor steals over her features and she sinks to the ground dead. Gyges, overcome with grief, tries to restore her to life. At this moment, Pythia appears. She tells Gyges not to grieve, but to thank Heaven for having preserved him from death and she indicates a cup of poison that Nisia had prepared for him.|$|E

Werner Laurie admitting: [...] "I dare say I delude myself in thinking this book my book of books".|$|E
500|$|Music is {{a common}} element of spiritual ritual and ceremonies {{throughout}} the island.

In coastal regions, music is crucial to helping a medium enter a trance state during a tromba ritual. While <b>in</b> <b>a</b> <b>trance,</b> the medium is possessed by an ancestral spirit. Each spirit is believed to prefer a particular tune or style of music and will not enter the medium unless the suitable piece of music is performed at the ceremony.|$|E

After attending a lecture in Maine in 1837 by the French mesmerist Charles Poyen, Quimby began to practise mesmerism himself. Mesmerism was named after Franz Mesmer (1734–1815), a German physician who argued {{for the existence of}} a fluid through which bodies could influence each other, a force he called animal magnetism. Quimby and an assistant, Lucius Burkmar, traveled around Maine and New Brunswick giving demonstrations; Burkmar, <b>in</b> <b>a</b> <b>trance,</b> would offer mind readings and suggestions for cures.|$|E
