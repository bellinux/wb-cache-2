25|$|Paralysis {{is one of}} {{the most}} {{pronounced}} effects of damage to α-MNs. Because α-MNs provide the only voluntary innervation to extrafusal muscle fibers, losing α-MNs effectively severs the connection between the brainstem and spinal cord and the muscles they innervate.

Voluntary muscle control is lost because α-MNs relay voluntary signals from upper motor neurons to muscle fibers. Loss of involuntary control results from interruption of reflex circuits such as the tonic stretch reflex. A consequence of reflex interruption is that muscle tone is reduced, resulting in flaccid paresis. Another consequence is the depression of deep tendon reflexes, causing hyporeflexia.|$|E
25|$|The cornea has unmyelinated {{nerve endings}} {{sensitive}} to touch, temperature and chemicals; {{a touch of}} the cornea causes an <b>involuntary</b> <b>reflex</b> to close the eyelid. Because transparency is of prime importance, the cornea does not have blood vessels. Instead, oxygen dissolves in tears and then diffuses throughout the cornea to keep it healthy. Similarly, nutrients are transported via diffusion from the tear fluid through the outside surface and the aqueous humour through the inside surface, and also from neurotrophins supplied by nerve fibres that innervate it. In humans, the cornea has a diameter of about 11.5mm and a thickness of 0.5–0.6mm in the center and 0.6–0.8mm at the periphery. Transparency, avascularity, the presence of immature resident immune cells, and immunologic privilege makes the cornea a very special tissue.|$|E

However, Michael Corballis has pointed out that it is supposed that primate vocal communication (such as alarm calls) cannot be controlled consciously, unlike hand movement, and thus is not credible as precursor to human language; primate vocalization is rather homologous to and continued in <b>involuntary</b> <b>reflexes</b> (connected with basic human emotions) such as screams or laughter (the fact that these can be faked does not disprove the fact that genuine involuntary responses to fear or surprise exist). Also, gesture is not generally less effective, and depending on the situation can even be advantageous, for example in a loud environment or where it is important to be silent, such as on a hunt. Other challenges to the [...] "gesture-first" [...] theory have been presented by researchers in psycholinguistics, including David McNeill.|$|R

40|$|Objective: To {{investigate}} the morphology, scalp topography and temporal relationship with orbicularis oculi muscle contraction ofbilateral blink related spikes (BRS) in a 7 -year-old boy with chromosomopathy, mild mental retardation and left spontaneous centrotemporal spikes (SS). Methods: The patient underwent video-polygraphic recordings with off-line analysis of SS and BRS {{by means of}} spike-averaging and orbicularis oculi contraction-locked averaging techniques respectively. EEG activity related to reflex blinking (evoked by glabellar tapping) was also studied. Results: SS and BRS presented the same morphology, characterised by four peaks (P 1, N 1, P 2, N 2). SS were located over the left centroparietal regions, while BRS were placed over both left and right centrotemporoparietal regions and constantly followed the contraction of orbicularis oculi with overlapping peak latencies over C 3 and C 4 electrodes (P 1 72 ms; N 1 115 ms; P 2 164 ms; N 2 236 ms). Refex blinking evoked a small waveform with the same features as BRS.

40|$|AbstractPrevious studies {{indicated}} that less motion smear is perceived when a physically stationary target is presented during voluntary eye movements than when similar retinal-image motion occurs during steady fixation. In this study, we assessed whether {{the perception of}} motion smear is attenuated also during the <b>involuntary</b> vestibulo-ocular <b>reflex</b> (VOR). Normal observers matched the length of perceived smear in two experimental conditions that were designed to produce similar trajectories of retinal image motion. In the fixation condition, a small bright target was presented for a duration of 50 – 200 ms in rightward or leftward motion, while the observer remained stationary and maintained fixation. In the VOR condition, the target moved along with the observer, who underwent full-body rotation around a vertical axis in darkness. Horizontal eye movement recordings during VOR trials allowed us to calculate the velocity of retinal image motion on each VOR trial. The principal result was that the extent of perceived motion smear was significantly less during VOR than fixation trials, particularly for target durations of 100 ms or longer. These findings support the conclusion that extra-retinal signals during the involuntary VOR contribute to a reduction of perceived motion smear...|$|R

40|$|Chronic {{alcoholism}} is a multi-factorial psychiatric disease manifested by re-occurring {{periods of}} relapse with frequent symptoms of cognitive impairments. There is no explanation {{to the extreme}} vulnerability to relapse, since this often occurs without evident molecular or biochemical changes remaining {{at the time of}} relapse. Epigenetic marks, such as DNA methylation, may represent a memory of molecular manifestations beyond evident genetic or biochemical signaling, in addition to its role as a gene activity regulator. The alcoholic genome could potentially possess an altered DNA methylation pattern by 1) DNA-methyltransferase blockage by acetaldehyde or 2) folate deficiency and aberrant methyl-donation by S-adenosyl-methionine (SAM). This thesis describes molecular and DNA methylation alterations in multiple alcoholic brain regions, with focus on a brain region important for reward related behavior and cognition the prefrontal cortex (PFC). First, an optimal normalization for quantitative expression analysis was established by analysis of a panel of endogenous control genes. This study demonstrated the importance of brain region specific normalization genes due to differences in expression stability between brain regions. Moreover, it reveals expression differences in a number of commonly used normalizing genes between controls and alcoholics. Furthermore, components involved in programmed cell death/cell survival were analyzed to examine a possible involvement in alcoholism. Several key pro- and antiapoptotic genes and proteins were found changed in the alcoholic PFC in a direction that supports a neuronal protective adaptation rather than an active cell death. This thesis further shows how the genome of alcoholics is deprived of DNA methylation. This is demonstrated to occur globally both in humans and in a rat model of alcohol dependence, by a technique developed during the thesis work, LUminometric Methylation Assay (LUMA), but it also occurs with gene specificity as shown in humans using a microarray based methylation technology. The results further indicate a specificity to brain regions involved in reward and cognition PFC and the striatum. DNA hypomethylation was also shown to be functionally important to investigate since a correlation (p = 0. 00001) between DNA hypomethylation and gene expression was found in 14 genes analyzed. Moreover, genes of expected functional groups, including alcohol metabolizing enzymes and genes regulating methylation processes were found differentially methylated, as well as the previously reported insulin signaling pathway and acetylcholine receptors. Finally, a neuronal atrophy pathway was associated to alcoholism by comparison analysis between DNA methylation microarray and previously reported gene expression microarrays. This pathway, Dentatorubral-pallidoluysian atrophy (DRPLA), is responsible for an autosomal neuronal atrophy disorder with clinical symptoms of epilepsy, cerebellar ataxia, dementia and <b>involuntary</b> <b>reflexes</b> and movements - symptoms also frequently found in alcoholics...|$|R

This is because neonatal imitation is extremely controversial, with debates focusing on whether the phenomenon even exists, what the mechanism is that drives it, and the function that it serves.

Unlike static procedures, muscle transfer surgery allows the restoration of <b>involuntary</b> blink <b>reflexes</b> of the orbicularis oris. As the platysma is like the orbicularis oculi in thickness, it is hypothesised the platysma would be an ideal candidate for muscle transfer surgery. The aim was to determine the neurovasculature of the platysma for reanimation of the orbit. Results were consistent between one platysma from cadaver A (A) and one platysma from cadaver B (B). The number of arterial branches identified in each platysma were as follows: facial artery A- 7, B- 2; submental artery A- 3, B- 1; and occipital artery A- 1, B- 1. The venous drainage branches identified were: anterior jugular vein A- 1, B- 2; external jugular vein A- 2, B- 1; and facial vein A- 2, B- 1. All nerves were identified as branches of the facial nerve: A- 7, B- 7. From the dissection it was found the posterosuperior lateral portion of platysma was more vascular rich; containing branches from the facial artery and facial vein, as well as the facial nerve. This portion of the muscle therefore has potential for use as a muscle transfer flap in surgery, as the rich neurovascular allows adequate rewiring for dynamic restoration.
