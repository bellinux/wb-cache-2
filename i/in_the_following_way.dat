25|$|If P and Q are {{two points}} on the curve, then we can uniquely {{describe}} a third point, P + Q, <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>following</b> <b>way.</b> First, draw the line that intersects P and Q. This will generally intersect the cubic at a third point, R. We then take P + Q to be −R, the point opposite R.|$|E
25|$|This arises <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>following</b> <b>way.</b> We {{never need}} four colors in a {{neighborhood}} unless there be four counties, {{each of which has}} boundary lines in common with each of the other three. Such a thing cannot happen with four areas unless one or more of them be inclosed by the rest; and the color used for the inclosed county is thus set free to go on with. Now this principle, that four areas cannot each have common boundary with all the other three without inclosure, is not, we fully believe, capable of demonstration upon anything more evident and more elementary; it must stand as a postulate.|$|E

25|$|One might {{attempt to}} reduce the second-order theory of the real numbers, with full second-order semantics, to the first-order theory <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>following</b> <b>way.</b> First expand the domain from the set of all real numbers to a two-sorted domain, with the second sort {{containing}} all sets of real numbers. Add a new binary predicate to the language: the membership relation. Then sentences that were second-order become first-order, with the formerly second-order quantifiers ranging over the second sort instead. This reduction can be attempted in a one-sorted theory by adding unary predicates that tell whether an element is a number or a set, and taking the domain to be the union of the set of real numbers and the power set of the real numbers.|$|E
25|$|On {{the second}} day of unleavened bread, that is to say the sixteenth, our people partake of the crops which they have reaped and which have not been touched till then, and esteeming it right first to do homage to God, to whom they owe the {{abundance}} of these gifts, they offer to him the first-fruits of the barley <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>following</b> <b>way.</b> After parching and crushing the little sheaf of ears and purifying the barley for grinding, they bring to the altar an assaron for God, and, having flung a handful thereof on the altar, they leave the rest {{for the use of the}} priests. Thereafter all are permitted, publicly or individually, to begin harvest. Since the destruction of the Temple, this offering is brought in word rather than deed.|$|E
