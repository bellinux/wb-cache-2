5|$|After {{the alarm}} had been raised, a major {{investigation}} commenced involving detectives from the Dublin Metropolitan North Central Division and the National Bureau of Criminal Investigation (NBCI). The {{house and the}} surrounding area were subject to a forensic examination by the Garda Technical Bureau. Gardaí performed house to house inquiries, took more than 1000 statements, and interviewed over 250 suspects. A postmortem <b>examination</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> bodies was made by the State Pathologist, Professor John Harbison; his first report was delivered on 13 March 1997. No material was found either by the forensic <b>examination</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> scene or by the postmortem examination that would have linked a suspect to the crime.|$|E

5|$|Birt–Hogg–Dubé can be {{difficult}} to diagnose from symptoms alone, because hereditary renal cancers, pneumothorax, and cutaneous tumors occur with other syndromes. Hereditary bilateral, multifocal kidney tumors similar to those seen in BHDcan occur with von Hippel–Lindau disease (clear cell renal cell carcinoma), hereditary papillary renal cancer (papillary renal cell carcinoma), and hereditary leiomyomatosis and renal cell cancer syndrome. They are differentiated with <b>examination</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> tumors' histology.|$|E

5|$|Dalton {{proposed}} that each chemical element {{is composed of}} atoms of a single, unique type, and though they cannot be altered or destroyed by chemical means, they can combine to form more complex structures (chemical compounds).

5|$|Depending {{on which}} bones are present, sex can be {{determined}} by looking for distinctive sexual dimorphisms.

5|$|Due to {{this shift}} in thought about the {{underlying}} mechanisms in plantar fasciitis, many in the academic community have stated the condition should be renamed plantar fasciosis.

5|$|<b>Examination</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> radar array {{also allowed}} British {{scientists}} {{to conclude that}} they would have to deploy a countermeasure that had recently been developed, code-named Window. <b>Examination</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Würzburg array showed that it was impervious to being jammed by conventional means used by the British during the early years of the conflict; thus Window would have to be deployed against German radars. The effectiveness of Window against Würzburg radar arrays was confirmed by a raid conducted by RAF Bomber Command on 24 July 1943 against Hamburg (Operation Gomorrah); when the bombers utilised Window, all of the radar arrays in Hamburg were blinded and their operators confused, unable to distinguish between the radar signature of a real bomber and several pieces of Window giving off a similar signature.|$|E

5|$|Physical <b>examination</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> {{nervous system}} is {{typically}} normal {{apart from the}} presence of papilledema, which is seen on <b>examination</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> eye with a small device called an ophthalmoscope or in more detail with a fundus camera. If there are cranial nerve abnormalities, these may be noticed on eye examination {{in the form of}} a squint (third, fourth, or sixth nerve palsy) or as facial nerve palsy. If the papilledema has been longstanding, visual fields may be constricted and visual acuity may be decreased. Visual field testing by automated (Humphrey) perimetry is recommended as other methods of testing may be less accurate. Longstanding papilledema leads to optic atrophy, in which the disc looks pale and visual loss tends to be advanced.|$|E
