The measurements {{are carried out}} in five supermarkets in Sweden. Using the field measurements, low and medium temperature level cooling capacities and COP's are calculated for ten-minute intervals, filtered and averaged to monthly values. The {{results indicate that the}} systems using trans-critical booster system with gas removal from the <b>intermediate</b> <b>vessel</b> have relatively the highest total COP. The reasons are higher evaporation temperatures, lower internal and external superheat and higher total efficiency of booster compressors. Another important factor is gas removal from the <b>intermediate</b> <b>vessel</b> which leads to higher COP of low temperature level. Comparing the older and newer installed systems, a trend in energy efficiency improvement has been seen. The study shows this improvement originates from both changes in the system design (e. g. two stage expansion) and components efficiency improvement (e. g. higher total efficiency of compressors - lower internal superheat and higher evaporation temperatures of cabinets).

40|$|Batch time {{requirements}} are {{provided for the}} separation of binary zeotropic mixtures in two different multivessel columns (with and without vapor bypass), a non-cyclic two-vessel column and a regular batch column based on dynamic simulations. The first three columns are operated as closed (total reflux) systems and the regular batch column is operated as an open (partial reflux) system. We analyze the effects of feed composition, relative volatility and product specification on the time requirements. The multivessel arrangements perform better than the regular batch column, which requires from 4. 00 to 34. 67 % more time to complete a given separation. The elimination of the vapor bypass in the multivessel column is impractical though it has {{a positive effect on}} the batch time requirements. Thus, the multivessel column, with the vapor stream bypassing the <b>intermediate</b> <b>vessel,</b> is proposed as the best candidate for a binary zeotropic mixture with low concentration of light component, low relative volatility and high product purity demand. Furthermore, an experimental multivessel column with vapor bypass is built and the corresponding experiments verify the simulations...|$|E

Objective: Evaluate the prevalence and anatomic characteristics of coronary artery disease (CAD) in type diabetic {{patients with}} chronic renal failure undergoing hemodialysis. Methods: This is a descriptive study of 20 patients with type diabetes mellitus undergoing hemodialysis without known CAD. CAD was assessed by quantitative coronary angiography (QCA) and intravascular ultrasound (IVUS). QCA was performed in all lesions ≥ 30 %, visually. All proximal 18 -mm segments of the coronary arteries were analyzed by IVUS. All other coronary segments with stenosis ≥ 30 % were also analyzed. Results: Angiography detected 29 lesions ≥ 30 % in 15 patients (75 %). Eleven (55 %) of the lesions were ≥ 50 % and 10 (50 %) ≥ 70 %. Thirteen patients had all 3 major arteries interrogated by IVUS. Atherosclerosis was present in all patients and in all 5 proximal 8 -mm segments analyzed. The mean vessel diameter of these segments was significantly larger at the IVUS than at the QCA, for all vessels. IVUS images of 25 (86. 2 %) of the 29 lesions ≥ 30 % were obtained.

40|$|Background: Abdominal donor-site flaps {{based on}} the deep {{inferior}} epigastric artery (DIEA) {{are the most common}} flaps used in autologous breast reconstruction. With significant variation in the vascular anatomy of the DIEA, preoperative imaging is desirable. Computed tomographic angiography, recently described for this purpose, uniquely demonstrates the branching pattern of the DIEA. The authors sought to correlate the DIEA branching pattern to the location and course of perforators as a preoperative planning tool for perforator flaps. Methods: Forty-five cadaveric hemi–abdominal walls were used for contrast injection of the DIEA with subsequent radiographic imaging. The branching pattern on radiography was thus correlated to the location and intramuscular course of perforators, from the main DIEA trunk to the point of the penetrating rectus sheath. Results: The DIEA branching pattern correlated closely with the course of perforators. A bifurcating (type II) branching pattern demonstrated a reduced transverse distance traversed by each perforator, whereas a trifurcating (type III) branching pattern demonstrated significantly greater transverse distances (p = 0. 0002). Type I vessels were <b>intermediate.</b> <b>Vessel</b> branching type, however, displayed no significant correlation with the number of perforators (p = 0. 56). Conclusions: The distances traversed by perforators were significantly reduced with a bifurcating branching pattern of the DIEA, particularly those originating from the lateral branch, and were greatest with a trifurcating branching pattern. Increased transverse distances correlate with greater rectus muscle sacrificed during perforator flap surgery. As computed tomographic angiography is the optimal modality for demonstrating this pattern preoperatively, the authors suggest its use for preoperative assessment in transverse rectus abdominis musculocutaneous and DIEA perforator flaps. 7 page(s...|$|E

60|$|Denham was the {{commander}} of the Chloe, which ship, a neat six-and-thirty, was pitching into the heavy seas that now came rolling in heavily from the broad Atlantic, the water streaming from her hawse-holes, as she rose from each plunge, like the spouts of a whale. This vessel, it has been stated, was fully a league ahead and to leeward of the Plantagenet, and consequently so much nearer to the French, who were approaching from that precise quarter of the ocean, in a long single line, like that of the English; a little relieved, however, by the look-out vessels, all of which, in their case, were sailing along on the weather-beam of their friends. The distance was still so great, as to render glasses necessary in getting any very accurate notions of the force and the point of sailing of Monsieur de Vervillin's fleet, the ships astern being yet so remote as to require long practice to speak with any certainty of their characters. In nothing, notwithstanding, was the superior practical seamanship of the English more apparent, than {{in the manner in which}} these respective lines were formed. That of Sir Gervaise Oakes was compact, each ship being as near as might be a cable's length distant from her seconds, ahead and astern. This was a point on which the vice-admiral prided himself; and by compelling his captains rigidly to respect their line of sailing, and by keeping the same ships and officers, as much as possible, under his orders, each captain of the fleet had got to know his own vessel's rate of speed, and all the other qualities that were necessary to maintain her precise position. All the ships being weatherly, though some, in a slight degree, were more so than others, it was easy to keep the line in weather like the present, the wind not blowing sufficiently hard to render a few cloths more or less of canvass of any very great moment. If there was a vessel sensibly out of her place, in the entire line, it was the Achilles; Lord Morganic not having had time to get all his forward spars as far aft as they should have been; a circumstance that had knocked him off a little more than had happened to the other vessels. Nevertheless, had an air-line been drawn at this moment, from the mizzen-top of the Plantagenet to that of the Warspite, it would have been found to pass through the spars of quite half the <b>intermediate</b> <b>vessels,</b> and no one of them all would have been a pistol-shot out of the way. As there were six intervals between the vessels, and each interval as near as could be guessed at was a cable's length, the extent of the whole line a little exceeded three-quarters of a mile.|$|R

That is a question which has been much debated amongst archæologists, and which cannot even now be considered as finally settled before the tribunal of science. He must have drunk out of something or other, but whether he drank out of earthenware cups is still uncertain.

40|$|A {{process for}} {{continuously}} regenerating absorbent recovering solvent from an effluent air stream, {{in which the}} solvent-containing absorbent is supplied to a desorber, and contacted by stripping gas to remove the solvent. The solvent-saturated stripping gas {{is fed to a}} vapour permeation module forming solvent-enriched permeate and a retentate stream with solvent-depleted stripping gas, the latter being re-supplied to the desorption unit via a closed circuit. In the permeate stream from the permeation module, a reduced pressure source follows and is transferred, via the vapour permeation module, into the feed stream. A condensation stage occurs in the permeate stream followed by a portion of solvent-depleted stripping gas being locked-out. The remaining solvent-depleted stripping gas is introduced into the retentate stream. Preferably the locked out fraction of solvent-depleted stripping gas from the condensation stage is supplied to the solvent-saturated effluent air stream, or is dispo sed of via an adsorption unit. A separator, partly in fluid form, follows the source of low pressure leading back to an <b>intermediate</b> condensate <b>vessel.</b> The gas stream leaving this stage is sent to the stripping gas-stream and saturated with solvent before entering the vapour permeation module. The gas stream leaving the condensate stage is at least partially sent to the retentate stream after the vapour permeation module. The vapour permeation module has a membrane exhibiting a selectivity between solvent and stripping gas not more than 10; preferably exceeding 30. Stripping gas is heated before or in the desorption unit and before arriving at the vapour permeation module, is cooled. The stripping gas being steam, air or inert gas. USE - To regenerate a solvent absorbent. ADVANTAGE - The process regenerates continuously and efficiently, increasing the absorption and/or the achievable throughput for given recovery.

40|$|Primary {{central nervous}} system lymphomas (PCNSL) are {{aggressive}} extranodal malignancies confined to the {{central nervous system}} (CNS), mostly of diffuse large B cell histotype. Despite improved understanding of the malignant B cells, little is known on the tumor microenvironment and on the response of the adaptive immunity against PCNSL. The majority of B-cell lymphomas, including PCNSL originate from germinal center (GC) B cells. The GC is the main source of memory B cells and plasma cell generation, which produce high affinity antibodies and are necessary to protect us against invading microorganisms. However, the beneficial role of GC B cells in immunity is counterbalanced by their detrimental role in lymphomagenesis. Germinal center B cells express a distinct set of chemokine receptors, which regulate their migration and positioning during and after germinal center reaction. Similar to centrocytes and centroblasts, malignant B cells derived from germinal centers can retain a particular set of chemokine receptors, which allows them to respond to their cognate ligands expressed in the microenvironment. Therefore investigation of lymphocyte chemoattractants in secondary lymphoid organs as well as in extranodal lymphomas does not only improve our understanding of B cell trafficking within secondary lymphoid organs, but also helps us understanding tumor cell distribution and dissemination of malignant B cells as well as tumor infiltrating lymphocytes. Gene expression analysis has previously shown, that malignant B cells in PCNSL resemble late germinal center B cells and express classical B cell chemokine receptors. This work focuses on the chemokine microenvironment and the potential role of bystander cells in PCNSL and their effects on malignant B cells as well as tumor infiltrating lymphocytes. The project includes four major sections: 1. Analysis of the expression of B cell attracting chemokines under normal and inflammatory conditions in human secondary lymphoid organs. 2. Analysis of T and B cell attracting chemokines in extranodal CNS lymphomas, 3. Analysis of type, density and localization of tumor infiltrating lymphocytes in PCNSL, 4. Analysis of the effect of coexpressed chemokines in PCNSL on the migratory responses of tumor-infiltrating lymphocytes and malignant B cells. We show by immunhistochemistry and in-situ hybridization, that there is a specific expression pattern of homeostatically expressed chemokines CXCL 12, CXCL 13 and CCL 21 in normal, non-inflamed human secondary lymphoid organs. Under inflammatory conditions, the expression pattern of macrophage- derived CXCL 12 and follicular dendritic cell- derived CXCL 13 within the germinal center changes significantly. Within the germinal center, macrophage-derived CXCL 12 and follicular dendritic cell-derived CXCL 13 build a meshwork in which germinal center B cells reside. While CXCL 13 shows a clear gradient between the dark and the light zone of the germinal center in human secondary lymphoid tissue, we could not detect a clear gradient for CXCL 12 between the two zones. Analysis of CXCL 12 and CXCL 13 in primary central nervous system lymphoma showed an expression pattern similar to the one in germinal centers of secondary lymphoid organs. In addition, we identified a fraction of CXCL 13 -expressing lymphocytes in PCNSL. CXCL 13 -expression is a hallmark of germinal center T cells known as follicular T helper cells (TFH), which provide help to germinal center B cells. Yet, the majority of tumor infiltrating lymphocytes in PCNSL are CD 8 + T cells, which show Granzyme B activity and vigorous proliferation. Tumor infiltrating CD 8 + T cells show a higher frequency in the perivascular areas of small and <b>intermediate</b> <b>vessels</b> in PCNSL. They accumulate in areas with high expression of the inflammatory chemokine CXCL 9. Perivascular CXCL 9 is upregulated by perivascular macrophages and pericytes under inflammatory conditions in the CNS, indicating an important role for pericytes and perivascular macrophages in the recruitment of tumor infiltrating lymphocytes. Moreover, CXCL 9 and CXCL 12 are coexpressed on the tumor vasculature within PCNSL and can form heterocomplexes. Our in-vitro experiments show, that in the presence of CXCL 9, CXCL 12 -induced migration is enhanced not only on CXCR 4 +/CXCR 3 +/CD 8 + T cells but also on CXCR 4 +/CXCR 3 - malignant B cells. Our findings indicate, that malignant B cells in PCNSL may encounter a germinal-center like chemokine environment, which traps malignant B cells within the CNS. In addition, our results reveal the presence of a strong chemoattractant stimulus in the perivascular microenvironment, which might serve as regulator for the recruitment of tumor infiltrating lymphocytes and for the angiocentric positioning of malignant B cells in the perivascular cuff. ...|$|R
40|$|AbstractPostnatal neovascularization is {{essential}} for wound healing, cancer progression, and many other physiological functions. However, its genetic mechanism is largely unknown. In this report, we study neovascularization in regenerating adult zebrafish fins using transgenic fish that express EGFP in blood vessel endothelial cells. We first describe the morphogenesis of regenerating vessels in wild-type animals and then the phenotypic analysis of a genetic mutation that disrupts blood vessel regeneration. In wild-type zebrafish caudal fins, amputated blood vessels heal their ends by 24 h postamputation (hpa) and then reconnect arteries and veins via anastomosis, to resume blood flow at wound sites by 48 hpa. The truncated vessels regenerate by first growing excess vessels to form unstructured plexuses, resembling the primary capillary plexuses formed during embryonic vasculogenesis. Interestingly, this mode of vessel growth switches by 8 days postamputation (dpa) to growth without a plexus <b>intermediate.</b> During blood <b>vessel</b> regeneration, vessel remodeling begins during early plexus formation and continues until the original vasculature pattern is reestablished at ∼ 35 dpa. Temperature-sensitive mutants for reg 6 have profound defects in blood vessel regeneration. At the restrictive temperature, reg 6 regenerating blood vessels first fail to make reconnections between severed arteries and veins, and then form enlarged vascular sinuses rather than branched vascular plexuses. Reciprocal temperature-shift experiments show that reg 6 function is required throughout plexus formation, but not during later growth.

40|$|The {{effect of}} anti-vascular agents {{on the growth}} of {{experimental}} tumors is well studied. Their impact on tumor vasculature, the primary therapeutic target of these agents, is not as well characterized, even though this primarily determines treatment outcome. Hypothesizing that the response of vessels to therapy is influenced by their stage of maturation, we studied vascular development and the vascular effects of therapy in several transplanted murine tumor models. Based on size, perfusion, endothelial cell (EC) proliferation, {{and the presence of}} pericytes, tumor vessels segregated into three categories. Least mature were highly proliferative, nonperfused EC sprouts emanating from functional <b>vessels.</b> <b>Intermediate</b> were small, perfused vessels which, like the angiogenic sprouts, were not covered by pericytes. Most mature were larger vessels, which were predominantly pericyte-covered with quiescent ECs and few associated sprouts. Thus, a developmental order, similar to that described during physiological neovascularization, was evident among vessels in growing tumors. This order markedly influenced tumor vessel response to anti-vascular therapy with recombinant interleukin- 12. Therapy reduced tumor vessel density, which was attributable to a decrease in angiogenic sprouts and induction of EC apoptosis in pericyte-negative vessels. Although the great majority of vessels in growing tumors lacked pericyte coverage, selective loss of less mature vessels with therapy significantly increased the fraction of pericyte-positive vessels after therapy. These data indicate that the therapeutic susceptibility of tumor vasculature to recombinant murine IL- 12 and, potentially, other anti-vascular agents is limited by its level of maturation. An implication is that tumor susceptibility is similarly limited, making pericyte coverage of tumor vasculature a potential indicator of tumor responsiveness...|$|R
40|$|Thermal {{stratification}} phenomena {{are very}} common in pool type reactor systems, such as the liquid-salt cooled Advanced High Temperature Reactor (AHTR) and liquid-metal cooled fast reactor systems such as the Sodium Fast Reactor (SFR). It is important to accurately predict the temperature and density distributions both for design optimation and accident analysis. Current major reactor system analysis codes such as RELAP 5 (for LWR’s, and recently extended to analyze high temperature reactors), TRAC (for LWR’s), and SASSYS (for liquid metal fast reactors) only provide lumped-volume based models which can only give very approximate results and can only handle simple cases with one mixing source. While 2 -D or 3 -D CFD methods {{can be used to}} analyze simple configurations, these methods require very fine grid resolution to resolve thin substructures such as jets and wall boundaries, yet such fine grid resolution is difficult or impossible to provide for studying the reactor response to transients due to computational expense. Therefore, new methods are needed to support design optimization and safety analysis of Generation IV pool type reactor systems. Previous scaling has shown that stratified mixing processes in large stably stratified enclosures can be described using one-dimensional differential equations, with the vertical transport by free and wall jets modeled using standard integral techniques. This allows very large reductions in computational effort compared to three-dimensional numerical modeling of turbulent mixing in large enclosures. The BMIX++ (Berkeley mechanistic MIXing code in C++) code was originally developed at UC Berkeley to implement such ideas. This code solves mixing and heat transfer problems in stably stratified enclosures. The code uses a Lagrangian approach to solve 1 -D transient governing equations for the ambient fluid and uses analytical or 1 -D integral models to compute substructures. By including liquid salt properties, BMIX++ code is extended to analyze liquid salt pool systems in the current AHTR design, to provide an example of its application. Similar analysis is possible for liquid-metal cooled reactors. The current AHTR baseline design uses a large buffer salt tank to provide more thermal inertial and safety margin. Reactor <b>vessel,</b> <b>intermediate</b> heat exchangers, pool reactor auxiliary cooling system heat exchangers (PHX), and direct reactor auxiliary cooling system heat exchangers (DHX) are all immerged in the buffer salt pool. These structures provide major driving sources for vertical mixing and thermal stratification. Predication of the temperature distribution within the buffer salt tank directly affects the major safety systems design, such as the PHX and DHX, safety analysis results, and structure thermal stresses analysis. The BMIX++ code is used to predict mixing and thermal stratification in this pool system. This example shows the potential of 1 -D analysis methods and BMIX++ to be included in system analysis codes for pool type of Gen-IV reactor systems...|$|R
