5|$|The size of {{the welding}} torch nozzle depends {{on the amount of}} {{shielded}} area desired. The {{size of the}} gas nozzle depends upon the diameter of the <b>electrode,</b> the <b>joint</b> configuration, and the availability of access to the joint by the welder. The inside diameter of the nozzle is preferably at least three times the diameter of the electrode, but there are no hard rules. The welder judges the effectiveness of the shielding and increases the nozzle size to increase the area protected by the external gas shield as needed. The nozzle must be heat resistant and thus is normally made of alumina or a ceramic material, but fused quartz, a high purity glass, offers greater visibility. Devices can be inserted into the nozzle for special applications, such as gas lenses or valves to improve the control shielding gas flow to reduce turbulence and introduction of contaminated atmosphere into the shielded area. Hand switches to control welding current can be added to the manual GTAW torches.|$|R

The influence of the obtained front electrode features on electrical properties of solar cells was estimated. The front electrode of photovoltaic cells was deposited using screen printing (SP) method and next to manufactured by two methods: convectional (1. co-fired in an infrared belt furnace) and unconventional (2. Selective Laser Sintering). Resistance of front electrodes solar cells was investigated using Transmission Line Model (TLM). Artificial neural networks were obtained {{with the use of}} Statistica Neural Network by Statsoft. Created artificial neural networks makes possible the easy modelling of contact resistance of manufactured front metallization and allows the better selection of production parameters. The following technological recommendations for the screen printing connected with co-firing and selective laser sintering technology such as optimal paste composition, morphology of the silicon substrate, co-firing temperature and the power and scanning speed of the laser beam to manufacture the front electrode of silicon solar cells were experimentally selected in order to obtain uniformly melted structure well adhered to substrate, of a small front <b>electrode</b> substrate <b>joint</b> resistance value.

40|$|Various {{aspects of}} redox protein {{integration}} with nano-electronic elements are addressed by a multi-technique investigation of different yeast cytochrome c (YCC) -based hybrid systems. Three different immobilization strategies on gold via organic linkers are explored, involving either covalent bonding or electrostatic interaction. Specifically, Au surfaces are chemically modified by self-assembled monolayers (SAMs) exposing thiol-reactive groups, or by acid-oxidized single-wall carbon nanotubes (SWNTs). Atomic force microscopy and scanning tunnelling microscopy are employed {{to characterize the}} morphology and the electronic properties of single YCC molecules adsorbed on the modified gold surfaces. In each hybrid system, the protein molecules are stably assembled, in a native configuration. A standing-up arrangement of YCC on SAMs is suggested, together with an enhancement of the molecular conduction, as compared to YCC directly assembled on gold. The electrostatic interaction with functionalized SWNTs allows several YCC adsorption geometries, with a preferential high-spin haem configuration, as outlined by Raman spectroscopy. Moreover, the conduction properties of YCC, explored in different YCC nanojunctions by conductive atomic force microscopy, indicate the effectiveness of electrical conduction through the molecule and its dependence on the <b>electrode</b> material. The <b>joint</b> employment of several techniques confirms the key role of a well-designed immobilization strategy, for optimizing biorecognition capabilities and electrical coupling with conductive substrates at the single-molecule level, {{as a starting point}} for advanced applications in nano-biotechnology...|$|R

Experimental welding, measurement of welding parameters, calculation of the melting rate, measurement and calculation of shielding flux consumption, a visual examination of the welds made, an analysis of macro sections, and an economic calculation of the respective {{total cost of the}} welding processes using single-wire, twin-wire and triple-wire electrodes were performed {{in order to make a}} comparative analysis of the processes concerned. The experimental results obtained showed that high quality welded joints could be produced using two wires or three wires, i. e. the twin- or triple-wire <b>electrode,</b> in a <b>joint</b> contact tube in submerged arc welding. The calculation of the cost-effectiveness of welding, including personnel, materials, overheads and other costs, showed that welding with the twin-wire electrode cuts the costs by 20 % and welding with the triple-wire electrode by around 30 %. Submerged arc welding with a triple-wire electrode is a new welding process variant suitable for thick and long workpieces and in cases where a larger quantity of the molten filler material is required. Three wires in a joint contact tube can be arranged in a line or in the shape of a triangle optionally with long sides depending on the shape of the joint assembly and the weld shape desired.

The principal {{aim of this study}} was to explore and compare the EEG power spectra during two n-back tests with different levels of difficulty (1 -back vs 3 -back). Fourteen healthy subjects were enrolled (7 men and 7 women, mean age 31. 21 &# 177; 7. 05 years, range: 23 - 48). EEG was recorded while performing the N-back test, by means of 19 surface <b>electrodes</b> referred to <b>joint</b> mastoids. EEG analysis were conducted by means of the standardized LOw Resolution brain Electric Tomography (sLORETA) software. The statistical comparison between EEG power spectra in the two conditions was performed using paired t-statistics on the coherence values after Fisher’s z transformation available in the LORETA program package. The frequency bands considered were: delta (0. 5 - 4 Hz); theta (4. 5 – 7. 5 Hz); alpha (8 – 12. 5 Hz); beta (13 – 30 Hz); gamma (30. 5 – 100 Hz). Significant changes occurred in the delta band: in the 3 -back condition an increased delta power was localized in a brain region corresponding to the Brodmann Area (BA) 28 in the left posterior entorhinal cortex (T = 3. 112; p< 0. 05) and in the BA 35 in the left peririnhal cortex in the parahippocampal gyrus (T = 2. 876; p< 0. 05). No significant differences were observed in the right hemisphere and in the alpha, theta, beta and gamma frequency bands.

40|$|This is {{the author}} {{accepted}} manuscript. The final version is available from IOP Publishing via the DOI in this record. This paper presents a sandwiched piezoelectric transducer (SPT) for energy harvesting in large force environments with increased load capacity and electric power output. The SPT uses (1) flex end-caps to amplify the applied load force so as to increase its power output and (2) a sandwiched piezoelectric-substrate structure to reduce the stress concentration in the piezoelectric material so as to increase the load capacity. A coupled piezoelectric-circuit finite element model (CPC-FEM) was developed, which is able to directly predict the electric power output of the SPT connected to a load resistor. The CPC-FEM was used to {{study the effects of}} various parameters of the SPT on the performance to obtain an optimal design. These parameters included the substrate thickness, the end-cap material and thickness, the <b>electrode</b> length, the <b>joint</b> length, the end-cap internal angle and the PZT thickness. A prototype with optimised parameters was tested on a loading machine, and the experimental results were compared with simulation. A good agreement was observed between simulation and experiment. When subjected to a 1 -kN 2 -Hz sinusoidal force applied by the loading machine, the SPT produced an average power of 4. 68 mW. The application of the SPT as a footwear energy harvester was demonstrated by fitting the SPT into a boot and performing the tests on a treadmill, and the SPT generated an average power of 2. 5 mW at a walking speed of 4. 8 km per hour.

40|$|Sparse {{signals are}} {{abundant}} among {{both natural and}} man-made signals. Sparsity implies that the signal essentially resides in a small dimensional subspace. The sparsity of the signal can be exploited to improve its recovery from limited and noisy observations. Traditional estimation algorithms generally lack {{the ability to take}} advantage of signal sparsity. This dissertation considers several problems in the areas of biomedical engineering and geosciences with the aim of enhancing the recovery of information by exploiting the underlying sparsity in the problem. The objective is to overcome the fundamental bottlenecks, both in terms of estimation accuracies and required computational resources. In the first part of dissertation, we present a high precision technique for the monitoring of human respiratory movements by exploiting the sparsity of wireless ultra-wideband signals. The proposed technique provides a novel methodology of overcoming the Nyquist sampling constraint and enables robust performance in the presence of noise and interferences. We also present a comprehensive framework for the important problem of extracting the fetal electrocardiogram (ECG) signals from abdominal ECG recordings of pregnant women. The multiple measurement vectors approach utilized for this purpose provides an efficient mechanism of exploiting the common structure of ECG signals, when represented in sparse transform domains, and allows leveraging information from multiple ECG <b>electrodes</b> under a <b>joint</b> estimation formulation. In the second part of dissertation, we adopt sparse signal processing principles for improved information recovery in large-scale subsurface reservoir characterization problems. We propose multiple new algorithms for sparse representation of the subsurface geological structures, incorporation of useful prior information in the estimation process, and for reducing computational complexities of the problem. The techniques presented here enable significantly enhanced imaging of the subsurface earth and result in substantial savings in terms of convergence time, leading to optimized placement of oil wells. This dissertation demonstrates through detailed experimental analysis that the sparse estimation approach not only enables enhanced information recovery in variety of application areas, but also greatly helps in reducing the computational complexities associated with the problems...|$|R
40|$|Flatwater sprint kayaking {{performance}} {{can be assessed}} through the analyses of average boat velocity a paddler can produce, which {{has been shown to}} be directly linked to the levels of force production. Furthermore kayaking has been the subject of substantial level of investigation, within which research has identified that the evolution of equipment and resultantly technique has a direct effect on performance. The focus of the previous research has revolved around the upper limbs, with the trunk and lower limbs viewed as an inconsequential base around which the upper limbs move. Therefore the current thesis attempts to identify the application of the entire body during kayak paddling and clarify the importance of trunk and leg contributions to performance. A notational analysis of technique was conducted comparing novice, national and international level paddlers. International paddlers displayed significantly (P < 0. 05) lower race and stroke times, as a result of significantly higher stroke rates. In addition aspects of technique were ranked from zero to five from which international paddlers displayed significantly (P < 0. 05) greater trunk rotation, leg motion, stroke width, and forward reach. These findings were supplemented by the international paddlers entering the paddle significantly closer to the centre line of the kayak, while holding a fixed forward lean position of the trunk. These findings provide important factors within technique that can be identified visually; however further investigation was required to identify their importance in the development of force and kayak velocity. Consequently the development of an on-water analysis system was required to ensure a comprehensive analysis of technique. This was conducted through the combination of kinetic, 3 -demensional kinematic, electromyographic and electrogoniometric analysis methods, using subjects (n = 8) with international experience. Subjects were prepared with passive surface <b>electrodes</b> and <b>joint</b> markers, and completed the testing protocol following completion of informed consent and a medical questionnaire. Statistical analysis identified that a moderate positive significant predictive relationship (R 1 = 0. 529, P< 0. 05) existed between peak force and mean velocity during the left paddle stroke. Separating the trunk into thoracic and lumbar regions revealed a significant negative predictive relationship (P < 0. 05) between velocity and range of lumbar spine rotation. Further significant (P < 0. 05) findings were identified between activation levels of the rectus abdominus, external obliques and the production of force and velocity. The combination of these findings indicated that the lower trunk acted as a strong stable base against which force was produced increasing average kayak velocity. The activation of the left rectus femoris displayed significant relationships (P < 0. 05) with force and velocity during both left and right strokes; indicating that the legs act as braces against which the force is transferred to the kayak. These findings reinforced those identified during the notational analysis, indicating that the legs and trunk play a fundamental role within the development of kayak velocity and therefore performance. It is therefore important that paddlers ensure that the musculature of the trunk and legs are used during performance and that the vital axial rotations occurring in the spine are produced in the thoracic region.

Quando o reparo de estruturas construÃdas com esse aÃo envolve soldagem convencional, ocorre a formaÃÃo de estrutura martensÃtica na zona afetada pelo calor (ZAC) bem como o estabelecimento de tensÃes residuais ao longo da junta. Os procedimentos de reparo para o aÃo ASTM A 516 Grau 60 estabelecem o uso de um tratamento tÃrmico para alÃvio de tensÃes logo apÃs a soldagem, tal tratamento vem como uma alternativa capaz de reduzir/minimizar efeitos danosos originados na regiÃo da solda. Todavia, algumas vezes podem ser tecnicamente impraticÃveis ou representar um aumento de custo significativo, de forma que um procedimento de soldagem sem tratamento tÃrmico pÃs soldagem (TTPS), que resulte em baixos nÃveis de tensÃes residuais e adequadas propriedades quÃmicas e mecÃnicas da junta Ã extremamente importante. Neste contexto, este trabalho foi proposto visando contribuir com os estudos de reparos por soldagem, com qualidade e sem a necessidade de um TTPS, atravÃs da aplicaÃÃo da tÃcnica da dupla camada. Os ensaios deste trabalho foram conduzidos em amostras do aÃo ASTM A 516 Grau 60 com 38 mm de espessura, soldados manualmente com eletrodos bÃsicos, em juntas chanfradas em K e em semi V, que foram avaliados na condiÃÃo como recebido; soldado com o procedimento convencional sem TTPS e com TTPS; e soldado com a tÃcnica da dupla camada.

Para todas as juntas foram avaliados os perfis de microdureza, a microestrutura, a energia absorvida ao impacto e os perfis de tensÃes residuais. Os resultados demonstraram que a aplicaÃÃo da tÃcnica de soldagem com dupla camada, usando combinaÃÃes adequadas de energia de soldagem, definidas pelo Teste de Higuchi, pode-se alcanÃar reduÃÃes dos nÃveis de dureza na ZAC; refinamento microestrutural; propriedades mecÃnicas finais melhoradas, porÃm com sinais evidentes de tensÃes residuais elevadas no Metal de Solda e no Metal Base. Steel ASTM A 516 Grade 60 is {{connected}} to a manganese structural steel, widely used in oil industry operations in storage, transport and processing of petroleum products in conditions that present requirements of toughness. When the repair of structures constructed with the conventional steel involves welding, there is the formation of martensitic structure in the heat affected zone (HAZ) {{and the establishment of}} residual stresses along the joint. The repair procedures for ASTM A 516 Grade 60 establish the use of a heat treatment for stress relieving after welding, such as an alternative treatment is able to reduce / minimize the harmful effects arising in the region of the weld. However, they can sometimes be technically impractical or represent a significant cost increase, so that a welding procedure without post weld heat treatment (TTPs), which results in low levels of residual stresses and adequate chemical and mechanical properties of the joint is extremely important. In this context, this work has been proposed to contribute to studies of repair by welding, quality and without the need for TTPs, by applying the technique of the double layer.
