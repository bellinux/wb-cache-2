40|$|A formal {{model for}} the {{coordination}} level of intelligent machines is established. The framework of the coordination level investigated consists of one <b>dispatcher</b> <b>and</b> a number of coordinators. The model called coordination structure {{has been used to}} describe analytically the information structure and information flow for the coordination activities in the coordination level. Specifically, the coordination structure offers a formalism to (1) describe the task translation of the <b>dispatcher</b> <b>and</b> coordinators; (2) represent the individual process within the <b>dispatcher</b> <b>and</b> coordinators; (3) specify the cooperation and connection among the <b>dispatcher</b> <b>and</b> coordinators; (4) perform the process analysis and evaluation; and (5) provide a control and communication mechanism for the real-time monitor or simulation of the coordination process. A simple procedure for the task scheduling in the coordination structure is presented. The task translation is achieved by a stochastic learning algorithm. The learning process is measured with entropy and its convergence is guaranteed. Finally, a case study of the coordination structure with three coordinators <b>and</b> one <b>dispatcher</b> for a simple intelligent manipulator system illustrates the proposed model and the simulation of the task processes performed on the model verifies the soundness of the theory...|$|R
