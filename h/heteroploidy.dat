40|$|Acute lymphoblastic leukemia is {{the most}} common type of cancer in children. It is a very {{heterogenous}} disease in which many recurrent chromosomal abnormalities have been described. The most important chromosomal abnormalities associated with a good prognosis are t(12; 21) (p 13;q 22) which result in ETV 6 /RUNX 1 fusion and hyperdiploidy. On the contrary findings suggesting a poor prognosis are t(9; 22) (q 34;q 11) leading to fusion gene BCR/ABL 1, MLL rearrangements or hypodiploidy. <b>Heteroploidy</b> is one of the most frequent findings in childhood ALL. It is characterised by nonrandom gain or loss of chromosomes from diploid cells. One of the most important findings in childhood ALL is hyperdiploidy where a non-random gain of chromosomes is present. Hyperdiploidy has a favorable prognosis and the impact of additional structural aberations requires further research. Another prognostically important group of <b>heteroploidy</b> is hypodiploidy. It is a quite rare finding and has a very poor outcome. There are non-random acquired chromosome losses observed in hypodiploid cells. Hypodiploid cell line may be masked with a doubled hyperdiploid clone which makes it difficult to identify. Proper and early cytogenetical analysis of heteroploid cells is very important as it contributes assigning correct diagnosis and risk stratification, [...] ...|$|E
40|$|Summary. A high {{incidence}} of haploid/diploid chimerism in chick embryos from strains of chickens selected for large size was postulated {{to be caused by}} the propensity of such hens to ovulate erratically. To test the hypothesis karyological analysis was made of embryos in eggs containing 1 or> 1 yolk. The eggs were from a line selected for multiple ovulation for 20 generations. Double and multiple-yolk eggs are a manifes-tation of an irregular ovulatory pattern. Ova in multiple yolk eggs were significantly less fertile and significantly fewer embryos survived to 18 h of incubation than single ovulated ova. In the sample of 342 embryos analysed, only 2 forms of <b>heteroploidy</b> occurred in frequencies of> 1 =. ...|$|E
40|$|Malignant melanomas are {{characterized}} by increased karyotypic complexity, extended aneuploidy and <b>heteroploidy.</b> We report a melanoma metastasis to the peritoneal cavity with an exceptionally stable, abnormal pseudodiploid karyotype as verified by G-Banding, subtelomeric, centromeric and quantitative Fluorescence in Situ Hybridization (FISH). Interestingly this tumor had no detectable telomerase activity {{as indicated by the}} Telomere Repeat Amplification Protocol. Telomeric Flow-FISH and quantitative telomeric FISH on mitotic preparations showed that malignant cells had relatively short telomeres. Microsatellite instability was ruled out by the allelic pattern of two major mononucleotide repeats. Our data suggest that a combination of melanoma specific genomic imbalances were sufficient and enough for this fatal tumor progression, that was not accompanied by genomic instability, telomerase activity, or the engagement of the alternative recombinatorial telomere lengthening pathway...|$|E

Nowadays, only few papers reporting cytogenetic or possible genotoxic effect of this insecticide on mammalian cells are available. In the present study 24 -hour exposure to bendiocarbamate at concentrations ranging from 20 to 160 μg/ml was used for investigation of unstable chromosomal aberrations (CA), sister chromatid exchanges (SCE) and stable chromosomal aberration induction in cultured bovine peripheral lymphocytes. The slight but no significant increase of chromatide breaks frequency was observed after the exposure of lymphocytes to 80 μg/ml of bendiocarb. At the highest concentration added to the cell cultures (160 μg/ml) mitotic index decrease was shown in both donors (p < 0. 05; p < 0. 01). Both statistically significant elevation of SCEs (p < 0. 05) and a reduction of proliferative indices (PI) (p < 0. 01) were shown at a dose of 80 μg/ml.

40|$|ABSTRACT-Sister {{chromatid}} exchange(s) (SCE) per {{cell and}} chromosome in five heteroploid cell lines and sublines of human melanoma origin were distinctly more numerous {{than those in}} the normal diploid control. The SCE per unit chromosome length was higher in stable heteroploid C 32 (0. 041 - 0. 047) and C 9 (0. 056) than in normal diploid control C 182 (0. 036), which suggested that the longer the total chromosome length of the cell genome, the higher the SCE per cell as well as per unit chromosome length. These malignant heteroploid lines had karyotypes ranging from hypodiploidy to hypotriploidy and were extremely heterogeneous in one cell line but unusually homog-enous and stable in others. However, none of these properties could be correlated to the increase in SCE frequency. As compared to C 32 -r 7, the subline C 32 -RO had more SCE per cell, chromosome, and unit chromosome length for the genome as well as for 9 of 11 individual chromosomes and chromosome groups. In contrast, the C 32 -RO specific ring marker chromo-some had only 40 % of the SCE of its nonring homologue in C 32 -r 7 cells. Interestingly, C 32 -RO and its ring marker were less stable than C 32 -r 7 and the nonring marker during in vitro growth. There was no noticeable difference between C 32 -r 7 and its derivative C 32 -r 7 -nu- 1, which implied that transplantation into nude mice did not alter the expression of SCE in this subline. -JNCI 1981; 66 : 273 - 277. SCE can be visualized by differential stammg tech-niques in chromatids unifilarly or bifilarly substituted with either BrdUrd (1 - 5) or IdUrd (5). In normal human lymphocytes, SCEF range from 4. 2 (6) to 16 (7) per cell. Content of BrdUrd, IdUrd, FdUrd, and dCyd in the growth media are known to affect SCEF (3, 7 - 9). However, under the same experimental conditions, SCEF within or between cell populations appear to be profoundly consistent, except that SCEF in Bloom's syndrome (6, 9, 10) and megaloblastic anemia (11) were significantly to moderately higher, respectively, than those of normal controls. <b>Heteroploidies</b> are generally considered genetically unstable (12) and chromosomally variable (13).

40|$|SUMMARY-We {{demonstrated}} that presumably virus-free {{cells from the}} germfree ALBM- 2 mouse undergo "spontaneous " neoplastic conversions in vitro. With these cells we showed that a shift from diploidy to <b>heteroploidy</b> is not essential for spontaneous neoplastic conversion in vitro, that the neoplastic cells under the culture conditions used are less adherent to surface substrate than control non-neoplastic cells, and that the growth-paHern change associated with neoplastic conversion may result from a loss of surface-substrate dependency {{rather than from the}} hypothetical loss of contact inhibition of mitosis. We extended the serum effect on neoplastic conversion to these presumably virus-free cells. In addition to delaying neoplastic conversion, fetal calf serum (FCS) as compared with horse serum (HS) reduced the percentage of lines converted and increased the latent periods for development of tumors from the cells in vivo. By applying cytologic criteria of neoplastic conversion, we made diagnoses that were 1000 / 0 consistent with results of in vivo assay. Electron microscope studie...|$|E
40|$|The link of {{aneuploidy}} and <b>heteroploidy</b> {{in human}} solid tumours with early genetic events is poorly understood. The {{study of human}} preneoplastic precursor lesions, i. e., colorectal adenomas, chronic ulcerative colitis lesions, and Barrett’s esophagus, as considered in this review, appears particularly useful to achieve this aim. Literature data examined here on aneuploidy were obtained by image and flow cytometry, classical cytogenetics, and in situ hybridization based cytogenetics. It appears that aneuploidy is linked with specific gene mutations, i. e., of the tumour suppressor gene p 53 in chronic ulcerative colitis and in Barrett’s esophagus, and of the protooncogene K‐ras in colorectal adenomas. These data and data from experiments using in vitro and mouse models, suggest that chromosome instability, tetraploidization, and asymmetrical chromosome segregation during cell division {{are the result of}} deregulated cell cycle genes with multiple functions that normally exert active checks on the cell cycle processes including apoptosis and chromosome stability...|$|E
40|$|Some {{fundamental}} {{aspects of}} cytogenetics, a {{brief review of}} work done with farm animals, and an assessment of the known effects of chromosomal aberrations on animal population are summarized in this paper. The basic chromosome number and other detailed features of the karyotype have been reliably established for all the farm animals within the past 10 years. Intra-species variants, i. e. chromosomal polymorphisms have been found in cattle, pigs, and goats. Two primary types of aberrations are recognized. The first, an alteration of numbers of whole chromosomes is known as <b>heteroploidy.</b> The second type, rearrangement of chromosomal segments, results following physical breaks of chromosomes. Factors affecting the frequency with which aberrations occur include both genetic and non-genetic elements. Among the most important in the latter category are certain virus groups, some drugs and other chemical compounds, ionizing radiations, age of gametes, particularly ova, and in some animals, maternal age. Presence of chromosomal aberrations are apparently responsible for a large proportio...|$|E
40|$|Primary human {{fibroblasts}} arrest {{growth in}} response to the inhibition of mitosis by mitotic spindle-depolymerizing drugs. We show that the mechanism of mitotic arrest is transient and implicates a decrease in the expression of cdc 2 /cdc 28 kinase subunit Homo sapiens 1 (CKsHs 1) and a delay in the metabolism of cyclin B. Primary human fibroblasts infected with a retroviral vector that drives the expression of a mutant p 53 protein failed to downregulate CKsHs 1 expression, degraded cyclin B despite the absence of chromosomal segregation, and underwent DNA endoreduplication. In addition, ectopic expression of CKsHs 1 interfered with the control of cyclin B metabolism by the mitotic spindle cell cycle checkpoint and resulted in a higher tendency to undergo DNA endoreduplication. These results demonstrate that an altered regulation of CKsHs 1 and cyclin B in cells that carry mutant p 53 undermines the mitotic spindle cell cycle checkpoint and facilitates the development of aneuploidy. These data may contribute {{to the understanding of the}} origin of <b>heteroploidy</b> in mutant p 53 cells...|$|E
40|$|ONLY {{limited success}} has been {{obtained}} in developing strains of human cells that can be cultivated {{for long periods of}} time in vitro and that still preserve the diploid chromosomal configuration [41, 47, 48, 58, 591. Indeed, <b>heteroploidy</b> may be a necessary corollary or even the cause of the altera-tion of primary or diploid cells in vitro to the status of a cell line. Such changes in chromosome number appear to be independent of the type of primary tissue since they have been observed in cells derived from both normal and malignant tissue [4, 22, 23, 311. These cell lines, of which over two hundred have been reported in the literature, have serious limitations for many kinds of biological studies. Chief among these is the exclusion of their use for the production of human virus vaccines. This limitation is based on the supposition that such hetero-ploid cell lines, whether of normal or malignant origin, share many of the properties of malignant cells [29, 30, 371. This objection would be even more important if viruses played a role in human neoplasia. In general, i...|$|E
40|$|Cultured {{epithelial}} cells from human skin generally had 3 - to 30 -fold more hydrocarbon-metabolizing activity than fibroblasts from {{skin of the}} same donor. This activity was constant for up to 55 days in primary culture but was lost rapidly upon physical subdivision of the cultures. Treatment of primary mixed fibroblasts and epithelial cell cultures with methylcholanthrene, but not phenanthrene, led to development of actively growing fibroblastic cultures with many heteroploid cells. Unique marker chromosomes, stable {{over a number of}} cell population doublings, were identified in several of the heteroploid cell strains. Pure cultures of fibroblasts from the same donors did not undergo heteroploid conversion in response to methylcholanthrene. Spontaneously occurring <b>heteroploidy</b> in logarithmic phase human fibroblasts is a rare event; thus, heteroploid conversion may be a useful marker for chemical transformation of human cells.

40|$|Graduation date: 1968 The Artemisia ludoviciana {{polyploid}} {{complex is}} a highly polymorphic assembledge of eight taxa in the Pacific Northwest, with a chromosome base number of x= 9. A cytogenetic analysis of this complex was carried out to determine the sources of its variation, the types of polyploidy present, and the genetic processes active in its evolution. Chromosome counts in the complex disclosed two diploid taxa, A. michauxiana and A. cavaticaulis, {{in addition to the}} previously counted diploids, A. suksdorfii and A. lindleyana. Results of meiotic analysis and artificial hybridization experiments strongly suggested the autoploid origin of the polyploid members of the complex. These results included the constancy of multivalent formation among the polyploids, the maximum number of multivalents formed in each taxon, the pairing relationships of the hexaploid and trisomic hexaploid A. douglasiana, the degree of homology between the included genomes of the artificial hybrids, and the presence of <b>heteroploidy</b> in at least five of the included taxa. The attributes of the complex that might have contributed to the origin and success of autoploidy were also examined. Observations indicate that the diploids produce a low but constant number of unreduced pollen grains. Introgression from the diploid to the tetraploid level, through tetraploid progeny, provides a source of variation for the newly formed autoploids. The complex has a broad physiological base.

40|$|The {{perception}} of African nightshades (Solanum section Solanum) as “healthy ” foods, supported by documentation {{of their high}} nutri-tional and medicinal benefits, {{has led to a}} sudden and steady upsurge in their consumption, demand and monetary value in Africa and most parts of South-East Asia. However, due to very low leaf yields, production of these vegetables remains on small-scales, resulting in acute shortages and escalating prices, especially in urban areas. Apart from local variants or landraces selected in some regions where these plants are utilized as food and/or medicinal plants, there are no improved cultivars developed through conventional plant breeding techniques. Species belonging to this section, generally referred to as “Solanum nigrum-complex ” are predominantly autogamous, favour-ing production of many small fruits and seeds, which compete with leaves for photosynthates. S. nigrum-complex constitutes a polyploid series, with diploid (2 n= 2 x= 24), tetraploid (2 n= 4 x= 48), hexaploid (2 n= 6 x= 72) and rarely, octoploid (2 n= 8 x= 96) species, a trait that can be exploited for cultivar development. This review outlines the possible evolutionary mechanisms and modes of origin of the polyploids, breeding strategies to produce heteroploids such as triploid (2 x= 3 x= 36), pentaploid (2 n= 5 x= 60) and heptaploid (2 n= 7 x= 84) from existing or induced polyploids and envisaged advantageous properties of the novel polyploids or heteroploids over their wild-type progenitors.

40|$|In {{this paper}} we examine DNA repair in the mouse. Using stringently applied inhibitors of DNA {{synthesis}} (hydroxyurea and l-/ 3 -D-arabinofuranosylcytosine) after ultraviolet irradiation we have quantitated an early {{step in the}} repair process- the frequency of single-strand DNA breaks, products of enzymic incision- in fibroblasts and epithelial cells grown in vitro from adults and embryos of different ages. We find that initial rates of incision are very similar in the earliest-passage fibroblasts, regardless of donor age, resembling the rates measured in other rodents while being considerably less than in diploid human fibroblasts. Consistently higher rates of incision are found in adult kidney epithelial cells. With increasing passage number the embryo cultures change with respect to growth rate and chromosome constitution, undergoing spontaneous transformation to established heteroploid cul-tures. This sequence is accompanied by characteristic changes in initial rates of inhibitor-sensitive incision. An early increase in incision rate, {{at a time when}} the cultures are enriched with tetraploid cells, is succeeded by progressive reduction in rate as the cultures become overtly transformed into permanent lines and <b>heteroploidy</b> is established. The lowest rate of incision occurs in a transformed line cloned from a late-passage culture. The decline in incision rate associated with transformation is accompanied by reduced unscheduled DNA synthesis (UDS). The sensitivity to inhibitors of UDS levels in the mouse cultures has been found to vary considerably; inhibitors are most effective in slowly proliferating cultures and apparently not at all when cultures are growing rapidly despite their ability to accumulate DNA breaks in these cells. Caution is needed, therefore, in the interpreta-tion of repair data obtained in the presence of these commonly used inhibitors of DNA synthesis...|$|E

Mycoplasmas were not detected {{in any of}} the cell lines. All cell lines exhibited <b>heteroploidy.</b> The CHSE 114, CHSE 214, and SSE 5 cell lines had hypodiploid modal chromosome numbers of 63, 67, and 64, respectively. The STE 137 and RTH 149 cell lines had hyperdiploid modal numbers of 66 and 64, respectively. The CSE 119 cell line had a hypotetraploid modal number of 110. The same modal number (67) was found at both transfer levels tested, 113 and 308, for CHSE 214 cell line. This indicated that the modal number for this cell line was no longer changing. Saturation density and optimum growth cell density were determined for all cell lines except CHSE 114. Saturation densities of cell lines ranged from 1. 7 X 10 ⁶ (RTH 149) to 6. 2 X 10 ⁶ (STE 137) cells per 35 X 10 mm dish. An optimum growth cell density of 2. 3 X 10 ⁴ 5. 0 X 10 ⁴, and 1. 4 X 10 ⁴ cells per 35 X 10 mm dish was obtained for CHSE 214 (transfer level 100 's), CSE 119, and STE 137 cell lines, respectively (t test, α. 05). No differences in cell growth rates were found for other cell lines at densities tested (t test, α. 05). Optimum growth temperature was determined for CHSE 214 and STE 137 cell lines grown at 8, 12, 16, 23, 27, and 34 °C (t test, α. 05). The CHSE 214 cell line exhibited exponential growth at 12, 16, and 23 °C. The STE 137 cell line exhibited exponential growth at 12 and 16 °C. Optimum growth temperatures for CHSE 214 cell line occurred at 16 and 23 °C. No difference (α. 05) between growth rates at 12 and 16 °C was found for STE 137 cell line. Maintenance growth occurred at 8 and 27 °C for CHSE 214 cell line, and at 8, 23, and 27 °C for STE 137 cell line. Neither cell line grew at 34 °C.
