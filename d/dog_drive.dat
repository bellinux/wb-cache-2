Teitur once again produced the album, which was recorded and engineered by his regular cohort Jonas Bloch Danielsen and mixed by George Tandero (Norway) who also recorded and mixed Stay Under the Stars. The song title that spawned the album title is a metaphor for relaxing and letting things just happen. The artwork for the album, is based on a series of drawings by Teitur of a dog character, reflecting some of the lyrics in the album; the graphic design being handled, as on all his albums, by London-based Bob McKie with direction by Christian Ulf-Hansen.|$|E

5000|$|Robert [...] "Bob" [...] Waldmire (April 19, 1945 - December 16, 2009) was an American {{artist and}} {{cartographer}} who {{is well known}} for his artwork of U.S. Route 66, including whimsical maps of the Mother Road and its human and natural ecology. Being the son of Ed Waldmire Jr., he is often associated with the Cozy <b>Dog</b> <b>Drive</b> In restaurant in Springfield, Illinois (on U.S. Route 66), the elder Waldmire (along with his friend Don Strand) created the Cozy Dog.His career as a professional artist began during his student days at Southern Illinois University. He returned home to draft a [...] "bird's-eye-view" [...] poster of his hometown; merchants paid to include their businesses in the posters, which he could then sell in the merchant's place of business at a profit. He extended the idea to 34 cities, then turned his attentions to the promotion of historic U.S. Route 66.|$|E
50|$|The second verse {{was based}} on an actual {{experience}} of Jay-Z in the 1990s in New Jersey. Jay-Z wrote that in 1994 he was pulled over by police while carrying cocaine in a secret compartment in his sunroof. Jay-Z refused to let the police search the car and the police called for the drug sniffing dogs. However, the dogs never showed up and the police had to let Jay-Z go. Moments after he drove away, he wrote that he saw a police car with the <b>dogs</b> <b>drive</b> by. Jay-Z's contention that he was pulled over for being black was later confirmed to have been common practice by the New Jersey police.|$|R

50|$|In April-May 2007, Clarkson and May {{teamed up}} to race Hammond from Resolute, Nunavut to the North Magnetic Pole, taking the route {{set out in the}} Polar Challenge. The terrain in between is some of the toughest in the world—a mix of mountainous land masses and jagged sea ice where {{temperatures}} can drop to -65 degrees Celsius (-85 degrees Fahrenheit). Jeremy and James used a specially adapted Toyota Hilux pick-up truck, while Richard used a sled pulled by a team of ten Canadian Inuit <b>dogs,</b> <b>driven</b> by American explorer Matty McNair. In the end the truck won, although the sled overtook them at one point while they were crossing the first of two fields of ice boulders.|$|R

5000|$|The Drever is a Swedish breed {{originating}} {{with the}} Westphalian Dachsbracke (a small hound for tracking deer), brought from Germany to Sweden around 1910, and crossbred with other hounds to adjust [...] "to Swedish terrain and game." [...] By the 1940s {{there were two}} distinctive sizes of the Dachsbracke, and a newspaper contest was held in 1947 to choose the new name for the slightly larger variety; Drever was chosen, from the Swedish word drev, referring to a type of hunt where the <b>dogs</b> <b>drive</b> the game towards the hunter. The Drever was then recognised by the Swedish Kennel Club as a separate breed in 1947. The breed is recognised internationally by the Fédération Cynologique Internationale, in Group 6 Scenthounds and related breeds, Section 1.3, Small-sized Hounds.|$|R

5000|$|After the Serum Run, Seppala {{and some}} 40 of his dogs toured the [...] "lower 48" [...] with an Eskimo handler. His tour ended in January 1927 with the dogsled race at Poland Spring, Maine, where he {{accepted}} the challenge to race against Arthur Walden, founder of the New England Sled Dog Club {{and owner of the}} famous lead dog [...] "Chinook." [...] Despite a series of time-consuming mishaps on the trail, Seppala won the race against the bigger, slower <b>dogs</b> <b>driven</b> by Walden and his followers. The enthusiasm for sled dog racing in New England together with the Serum Run publicity and the victory over Walden made it possible for Seppala and partner Elizabeth Ricker to establish a Siberian kennel at Poland Spring, Maine. This was the start of the spread of the Siberian Husky breed in the United States and Canada.|$|R
60|$|Smoke {{felt the}} sled heel {{up on one}} runner as it rounded an {{invisible}} curve, and from ahead came the snarls of beasts and the oaths of men. This was known afterward as the Barnes-Slocum Jam. It was the teams of these two men which first collided, and into it, at full career, piled Smoke's seven big fighters. Scarcely more than semi-domesticated wolves, the excitement of that night on Mono Creek had sent every dog fighting mad. The Klondike <b>dogs,</b> <b>driven</b> without reins, cannot be stopped except by voice, {{so that there was}} no stopping this glut of struggle that heaped itself between the narrow rims of the creek. From behind, sled after sled hurled into the turmoil. Men who had their teams nearly extricated were overwhelmed by fresh avalanches of dogs--each animal well fed, well rested, and ripe for battle.|$|R

50|$|In <b>dog</b> training, prey <b>drive</b> {{can be used}} as a performative {{advantage}} because {{dogs with}} strong prey drive are also willing to pursue moving objects such as toys, which can then be used to encourage certain kinds of behavior, such as that of greyhound racing or the speed required in <b>dog</b> agility. Prey <b>drive</b> can be an important component of pet dog training, obedience training and schutzhund as well. Games such as fetch and tug-of-war can be an effective motivator and reward for learning.|$|R

50|$|Heck's {{interest}} in <b>dogs</b> was <b>driven</b> {{in part by}} his passion for hunting, and in part by nationalism that was mixed {{with a desire to}} see what could be done with selective breeding.

Against our cell also (at Spalding) and our brethren, his neighbors, the prior and monks, who dwelt all day within his presence, he rages with tyrannical and frantic fury, lamed their oxen and horses, daily impounded their sheep and poultry, striking down, killing, and slaying their swine and pigs; {{while at the same time}} the servants of the prior were oppressed in the Earl's court with insupportable exactions, were often assaulted in the highways with swords and staves, and sometimes killed." ...|$|R

25|$|The flirt pole {{promotes}} {{physical activity}} and stimulates mental activity from the dog (running, jumping, watching, planning, changing direction) by stimulating the <b>dog’s</b> prey <b>drive</b> by offering a constantly moving lure.
