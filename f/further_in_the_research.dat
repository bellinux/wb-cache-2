40|$|ABSTRACT: This paper {{analyzes}} the factors explaining the aggregate fuel consumption for road transport in Spain in a dynamic panel data framework. Three features on {{this study are}} {{the use of a}} balanced panel using regional data, the distinction between gasoline and diesel and the specification of a dynamic panel data (DPD) model and estimate it by system Generalized Methods of Moments (GMM). Our results show that most explanatory variables are significant in explaining the evolution of gasoline consumption, while diesel consumption is found to be independent of most of these factors. The differences between the markets of the gasoline (most for passenger transport use) and the diesel (passenger and freight transport are important) could explain the results for the diesel model. Moreover, the intensive dieselization process that has taken place in Spain over the last decade, which has resulted in diesel consumption being exposed to factors- i. e., regulatory- which are not of a strictly economic nature. This finding highlights the need to consider different explanatory variables and models for gasoline and diesel consumption, and to go <b>further</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>research.</b> Finally, we find that traditional estimation procedures, such as fixed and random effect estimators, produce important differences with respect to system-GMM, which may even change policy recommendations...|$|E
40|$|In {{one way or}} another, {{knowledge}} and understanding of chemistry is generated, expressed, taught, and communicated at three different “levels ” known as the macro, submicroscopic and symbolic levels of representation (Johnstone, 1991; Johnstone, 1993). The submicroscopic level of representation concerns the world of atoms and their derivatives; ions and molecules, and this unobservable world is accessible only by imagination. Imagination is a key component of student understanding and its significance cannot be underestimated (Bucat & Mocerino, 2009). However, most students ’ knowledge resides almost exclusively at the symbolic level (Johnstone, 1991). The aims of this research include understanding how first year chemistry students imagine chemical processes at the submicroscopic level of representation.

40|$|The Advanced Envelope Research {{effort will}} provide factory homebuilders with high performance, {{cost-effective}} alternative envelope designs. In the near term, these technologies {{will play a}} central role in meeting stringent energy code requirements. For manufactured homes, the thermal requirements, last updated by statute in 1994, will move up to the more rigorous IECC 2012 levels in 2013, the requirements of which are consistent with site built and modular housing. This places added urgency on identifying envelope technologies that the industry can implement in the short timeframe. The primary goal of this research is to develop wall designs that meet the thermal requirements based on 2012 IECC standards. Given the affordable nature of manufactured homes, impact on first cost is a major consideration in developing the new envelope technologies. This work is part of a four-phase, multi-year effort. Phase 1 identified seven envelope technologies and provided a preliminary assessment of three selected methods for building high performance wall systems.

40|$|This master {{thesis is}} a case study, and deals with the {{business}} model’s role in the commercialization process of petroleum technology. The case being studied is Norwegian geophysical service company EMGS and their marine CSEM technology, a technology supporting oil companies {{in their search for}} oil and gas. EMGS was established in 2002, in order to commercialize this technology. Through the exploration of EMGS’s business model throughout the years, this thesis tries to identify why EMGS and the marine CSEM technology has not yet achieved the predicted commercial success. The theoretical basis is general literature on the business model concept, as well as literature on value creation, value delivery and value capture. The literature served as a basis to identify concepts and ideas that were interesting to study <b>further</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>research</b> process. The empirical data is collected through interviews with key employees at EMGS and supported through extensive written documentation. The thesis identifies characteristics of EMGS’s business model, and why the marine CSEM technology has not yet become an integrated part of oil companies’ exploration toolkit. One problematic area is the delivery of after-sales services. The oil companies lack knowledge about the technology, and need support in the interpretation phase. However, they are hesitant to share necessary information and data with EMGS. Another problem is the presales and marketing efforts. The technology has a potential 90 % success rate, but there are still large amounts of skeptics. This implies that the marketing procedures should be improved. Another key finding is the oil companies’ strong bargaining power, hindering EMGS’s value capture. It is also discovered through the thesis that outside events like the financial crisis have affected EMGS’s opportunities to deliver value. At the end, some recommendations for the further commercialization process of the marine CSEM technology are proposed. nhhma...|$|E

40|$|The current {{construction}} technology for PCB assembled power converters {{is based on}} the assembly of pre-manufactured discrete components. Fundamental limits of this construction method are steadily being reached as power converters tend to exploit higher processing speeds to gain advantages in both magnetic component size and overall power density. This thesis investigates a new design approach encompassing thermal management, geometrical packaging and electromagnetic integration (focussing on the PCB in particular) to push the limits <b>further.</b> <b>In</b> <b>the</b> <b>research,</b> a quantitative means to deal with component layout and the effect it has on the temperature characteristic of the converter is introduced as design tool. It incorporates the ability to define a design objective, such as high power density or increased reliability, and to weigh the respective trade-offs encountered during thermal design of a converter. Examples are provided. Furthermore, the inherent limitation of 2 D component layout (rigid PCB) often limits the freedom to arrange components with compatible shapes tightly together. A geometrical packaging approach is investigated to alleviate this limitation and thereby improve power density. Compatible components can be arranged tightly together in 3 D by implementing flexible PCB to fold the circuit, to accommodate the components. Electromagnetic integration has been identified as the enabling factor to realise structures that combine the functionality of several, otherwise discrete, components into a single structure, and combined with rigid-flex PCB technology these structures can be seamlessly embedded within the geometrically packaged converter system. The implementation of such multi-functional structures decreases the number of production and assembly steps during manufacturing and provides cost savings in material and assembly of the converter. The design procedure that encompasses the electrical, thermal and spatial aspects of compact PCB assembled converters is described and illustrated by working through the complete design of a 3 D PCB converter technology demonstrator.

40|$|When web {{applications}} are developed {{with a strong}} emphasis on time-to-market, the resulting development and trade-opractices are informal and make use of uncertain and fragmented knowledge. Developers and other stakeholders have to perform trade-os using imprecise speci cations, uncertain knowledge, and their beliefs, opinions and interests. In addition, this knowledge is fragmented between the stakeholders, since each one holds his own views, opinions and interests. Performing trade-os therefore involves sharing the stakeholders' knowledge and interests before a balanced decision can be made. The aim of this research is to understand how trade-os are performed in web application development and to improve the current trade-opractices. In this research we have studied the development and trade-opractices in industrial web application development by interviewing eight Norwegian companies. The interviews with the companies identi ed real world problems that have been used <b>further</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>research.</b> An analysis of the collected data has resulted in the discovery of several improvement opportunities for the applied trade-o practices. Working with these opportunities has resulted in a trade-ostrategy and several trade-otools. The trade-ostrategy deals with the observation that many companies are unaware that they are performing trade-os and that the trade-otools use qualitative assessments of the stakeholders' belief and opinion to perform such trade-os. Two trade-otools are tested experimentally by running a total of six experiments. The results of the experiments are used to improve a release planning method. By using real world problems from the interviewed companies the research has a realistic approach, yielding results that are relevant for industrial web application development. The following contributions are claimed: First, it describes development practices found in eight small Norwegian Web Application development companies, and focuses in particular on their trade-opractices. Second, a trade-o strategy to create awareness for trade-os, and to enable knowledge sharing between stakeholders, is developed. Third, qualitative assessments of trade-o options are applied and tested, thus enabling prioritisation of trade-ooptions. Fourth, trade-omethods for enabling and facilitating knowledge sharing are developed. These include a release planning method that uses qualitative assessments to express the stakeholders' beliefs and interests. Finally, a subprocess for managing change in web application development is provided, implementing a learning loop for knowledge management.

Then, the magnitude ratios of the harmonics at critical frequencies to the fundamental component of the stator current are determined by conducting a survey on previous faults found in Induction motors used in Kotmale Power Station and by carrying out an experiment on an Induction motor having a squirrel cage rotor with open rotor bars. The •defective Induction motor, which had been used in one of the gear pumps to pressurize the MIV pressure vessels of the three synchronous generators in Victoria Power Station, could be used for the measurements. Next, the results obtained from the case study and the survey are compared with the standards that have been evolved from the past studies and the researches in order to determine the feasibility of setting a limit or standard on the current harmonics at critical frequencies due to motor faults.

40|$|Building is an {{important}} enterprise concerning sustainable development. In order {{to contribute to the}} transformation, designers have to learn from existing building, not least successful demonstration projects. However, although findings {{on how to deal with}} for example the environmental effects have been available for a long time, the rate of implementation is alarmingly low. This paper is part of a research project that approaches the issues of sustainable architecture through contemporary design theory. The aim is to reach both a theoretical development and improved methodologies for implement ting sustainable strategies in integrated building design. The paper is a result of the initial phase in the project. It has been carried out through literature studies in design theory, discourse theory and ecological design. The investigation points out that information about sustainable building is not suitable for designers; mainly the place and project bound context and models from which you can learn from built examples. A framework has been developed, based on design theory and a systems approach. The basic features in the framework are the differences between ideological, open or compact concepts, and how they influence information about sustainable building. Furthermore, design processes are seen as related to complexity system levels instead of temporal phases. The framework has been used to analyse existing handbooks and guidebooks about ecological architecture, regarding their ability to function as guidelines and tools in the different complexity levels of design processes. The results are tentative, and will be investigated <b>further</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>research</b> project. They point out five possible explanations to why findings and experience about sustainable building are not used to their full extent among architectural designers. 1) 	Representations of sustainable development are ideological and open, but not clear enough concerning the cultural-esthetical dimensions and the long-term perspective, which both are of importance for architecture and building. 2) 	Information is not adapted to the difference in systems complexities in different design phases. Especially in the early phases, when the building is handled on a level of high complexity there is a lack of useful, open conceptual models. 3) 	Experience from the use and maintenance phases do not seem to be enough present in current pre-design and design phases. 4) 	The information about environmental design provides mainly solutions with a generic scope  space - independent of local prerequisites - place. There is a lack of models that focus on the more or less unique prerequisites in specific localities. Consequently, there is also a lack of models that combine the space and place approaches 5) 	Sustainable building calls for dialogues, within the design team and with participators and builders. Information is mostly focused on technical elements and less of moments of handling information in integrated design processes...|$|E
40|$|The {{purpose of}} this study was to develop and {{statistically}} analyse a conceptual model of contemporary developmental relationships in nursing. The conceptual model was formulated a priori and was based on both empirical and conceptual literature. No attempt was made to draw a distinction between concepts of preceptor and mentor and focused on all helping, supporting, developmental relationships that nurses form with their colleagues. The study population was selected by means of stratification by area of and random selection, and was drawn from the nursing population in hospitals and higher education institutions in New South Wales (n= 445). A nonexperimental retrospective research design was utilised for this study. of the conceptual model using structural equation modelling (SEM) was performed on data supplied by registered nurses (n= 349) on a questionnaire. Follow-up telephone interviews were also undertaken with a convenience sample drawn from the respondents willing to participate <b>further</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>research</b> study. An instrument was developed by the researcher to collect data on the professional values of nurses (16 nurturing and 16 achievement Items). Instrument evaluation using reliability and validity analysis measures is reported. The study aimed to: 1) develop a conceptual framework of developmental nursing relationships from a literature review of personality, preceptorship mentorship studies from both the conceptual and empirical literature; 2) identify reliable indicators to measure the above abstract concepts within context of developmental relationships in nursing; 3) statistically analyse conceptual model of developmental relationships in the occupation of nursing; and 4) expand the conceptual model through the development of the theoretical links between the abstract constructs based on the research findings from nursing study. The constructs examined in this study were: Individual Personality (IP) measured by Achievement Personality, Professional Values (PV) as measured by loading the Achievement and Nurturance factors of the Wright Professional Value Inventory, Work Context (WC) a composite measure of of nursing practice which was weighted by the number of years in the present position, and Developmental Relationships (DREL) as measured by loading the total number of relationships formed as a giver and as a receiver and type of relationship variable (collegial vs supervisory). Analysis of results confirmed the positive significance of paths from Individual Personality to Work Context, from Professional Values to Work Context, and from Work Context to Developmental Relationships. Professional Values was found to have a higher indirect effect on Developmental Relationships than Individual Personality. Although the hypotheses were supported, the predictive power of the model was relatively low (. 153) v the need for a search for more variables that are critical to the model to improve its predictive power. The data supplied from follow-up interviews indicated that even though registered nurses described the relationship in different terms, almost all saw the relationship as a developmental one...|$|E
40|$|Research of G-protein coupled {{receptor}} signaling (GPCR) for therapeutic applications {{have historically}} been a hot topic of research. In the past, GPCR studies have been primarily focused on the molecular mechanism of its signaling pathway debunking the components of either traditional G-protein signaling or by other novel and more complex signaling pathways. However, recent GPCR studies have transitioned to examining distinct behaviors exhibited by and physiological responses that are triggered by cell- and localization-specific GPCRs. These responses include inflammatory, anti-inflammatory, cell migration and metastasis. Further, research of GPCR signaling have extended to the utilization of "biased agonists" where these modified agonists activates a specific GPCR and {{have the ability to}} trigger the activation of a specific pathway and inhibit other pathways that otherwise is propagated via activation by the non-modified agonist. In the first study, we focus on the two distinct pools of protease-activated receptor- 2 (PAR- 2) present in intestinal epithelial cells: an apical pool facing the lumen, and a basolateral pool facing the bloodstream. Studies have demonstrated that introduction of PAR- 2 agonists such as 2 -furoyl-LIGRL-O-NH 2 (2 fAP) to the lumen can activate apical PAR- 2 while it has been predicted mast cells and recruited leukocytes release proteases that can activate basolateral PAR- 2. However, whether both pools of PAR- 2 are equally capable of signaling, and the possible distinction between apical and basolateral PAR- 2 induced responses have yet been addressed. Here we identified the expression of both apical and basolateral PAR- 2 in cultured CACO 2 -BBe monolayers, and in mouse proximal jejunum. We reveal apical and basolateral PAR- 2 in the intestinal epithelium are accessible by PAR- 2 agonist 2 fAP, and have both temporally and mechanistically signaling distinctions. Further, we demonstrate the apical and basolateral pools of PAR- 2 can trigger distinct physiological responses as well. Secondly, we illustrate that PAR- 2 activation enhanced bacteria uptake in cultured colonocytes via a clathrin and phosphotidyl-inositol- 3 -kinase dependent manner. Moreover, we show that PAR- 2 activation stimulated bacteria uptake in mice intestines. These results suggested that activation of the receptor plays a crucial role in gastrointestinal barrier dysfunction and is indeed a contributing factor to bacterial infection, further allowing for better understanding of PAR- 2 and its physiological role in the gastrointestinal system. On the whole these studies attempts to provide clarification for the characterization of PAR- 2 in the gastrointestinal system that can be used <b>further</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>research</b> for the usage of PAR- 2 as a therapeutic target. Lastly, findings for which I was a supporting author in a recent publication, we examined the differential effects of &# 946;-arrestins on internalization, desensitization and signaling of PAR- 2. We demonstrate here that &# 946;-arrestin- 1 and &# 946;-arrestins- 2 have distinctive roles in PAR- 2 signaling, including mechanistic and temporal distinctions in signaling, signal termination, cellular localization of signaling components and degradation...|$|E

Slowing in reaction time paradigms has been consistently documented in Schizophrenia such as in simple and choice reaction time tasks. In addition to slowing, the performance by individuals with Schizophrenia in choice reaction time tasks has also been documented to be more variable and error prone relatively to healthy participants. Executive functioning deficits in Schizophrenia are profound and as a result, response inhibition difficulties have been reported across various paradigms. Model-based analysis {{have not yet been}} conducted in regards to choice reaction time performance in Schizophrenia, and this method has the potential of uncovering further underlying cognitive processes in decision-making. Method: A meta-analysis was conducted to extend and expand the investigations by Schatz (1999) to include information of accuracy and standard deviation as well as reaction time, and performance of participants with Schizophrenia and health control groups was compared. An experiment was also conduced that took place across two sessions on separate days. Nineteen participants with Schizophrenia or Schizoaffective disorder, as well as control participants matched by age and gender were recruited. In the first session, participants completed a choice reaction task, completed measures of working memory and premorbid intelligence, and participants with Schizophrenia also completed a clinical interview.

The data from the choice reaction time task were fit by two cognitive models of choice processes: the Drift-Diffusion model (DDM, Ratcliff & McKoon, 2008) and the Linear Ballistic Accumulator model (LBA, Brown & Heathcote, 2008). Results: The meta-analysis revealed a consistent pattern of control groups performing faster and more accurately relative to participants with Schizophrenia in choice reaction time tasks. Reaction time and accuracy comparisons from the experiment indicated that participants with Schizophrenia were slower and less accurate in their responding, however this finding was not significant. Model-based analyses revealed that the LBA fit the data better than the DDM and produced a greater number of significant results, which are described in further detail. Sequential effects were found in the Schizophrenia group and model-based analyses further confirmed a bias towards participants with Schizophrenia repeating the immediately past response. A positive correlation was found between mean reaction time and negative symptoms in the Schizophrenia group. Furthermore, the combined effects of the threshold and rate parameters in the model-based analysis suggested a differential response strategy occurring in the group of participants with Schizophrenia relative to controls. Conclusions: The findings in the present study echo previous reports of slower and less accurate performance in Schizophrenia in choice reaction time tasks. A more in-depth discussion is provided regarding the possible interpretations of the threshold and rate parameter results. Relevant research findings regarding perseveration, flexibility in responding, as well as motion perception deficits in Schizophrenia are described and integrated with the results obtained. Finally, the strengths and limitations of the present study are highlighted and recommendations for future research and the potential implications of the present study are proposed...|$|E

A análise dos resumos de teses e dissertações que estudam a temática dos ciclos, no período de 2000 a 2011, demonstrou uma ausência de trabalhos que se preocuparam em analisar a teoria dos ciclos de aprendizagem de Phillipe Perrenoud, o que nos alertou para uma possível tendência a uma apropriação acrítica desta teoria. O trabalho foi dividido em três diferentes momentos. Na primeira seção, intitulada “Os ciclos no Brasil”, procuramos inserir o leitor na temática a ser aprofundada na pesquisa por meio de um “breve” histórico sobre a inserção dos ciclos no Brasil com o auxílio do estudo dos resumos de teses e dissertações levantadas sobre os ciclos no período de 2000 a 2011 que possuem como objeto de pesquisa os ciclos em suas diferentes manifestações. Na segunda seção “Philippe Perrenoud: o pensador dos ciclos de aprendizagem” procuramos elaborar uma síntese descritiva da teoria dos ciclos de aprendizagem de Perrenoud utilizando as suas centrais obras traduzidas no Brasil e, portanto, as que mais influenciam no país o debate sobre os ciclos de aprendizagem. E, por fim, a terceira e última seção foi intitulada “Os ciclos de aprendizagem em Perrenoud: quando afirmar é negar”, na qual procuramos efetuar uma análise sobre a proposta dos ciclos de aprendizagem de Philippe Perrenoud com o auxílio das reflexões dos teóricos clássicos da Escola de Frankfurt – Horkheimer, Marcuse e, especialmente, AdornoThis {{research}} {{aimed to}} analyze, through the negative dialectical method of the Frankfurt School, {{the theory of}} the cycles announced by author Phillipe Perrenoud, theorist who influenced the understanding of the cycles in Brazil since the nineties and proposed himself to theorize about how learning cycles should materialize in pedagogical practice and organizational structure in schools. The analysis of the abstracts of theses and dissertations studying thematic cycles, from 2000 to 2011, showed an absence of studies that have focused on analyzing the theory of learning cycles of Phillipe Perrenoud, which alerted us to a possible tendency to uncritical appropriation of this theory. The work was divided into three different moments. In the first section, entitled Cycles in Brazil, we seek to insert readers in the thematic to be discussed <b>further</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>research</b> through a brief history of the insertion of the cycles in Brazil aided by the study of abstracts of theses and dissertations achieved about the learning cycles in the period from 2000 to 2011, which have as research object the cycles in its different manifestations. In the second section, Philippe Perrenoud: the thinker of the learning cycle, we seek to develop a descriptive synthesis of Perrenoud's theory of the learning cycles using their central works translated in Brazil and, therefore, that most influence the debate in the country about the learning cycles. And finally, the third and final section is entitled The learning cycles in Perrenoud: when to state is to deny, in which we seek to make an analysis about the proposal of the learning cycle of Philippe Perrenoud {{with the assistance of the}} reflections of classical theorists of the Frankfurt School - Horkheimer, Marcuse and especially Adorn...|$|E
40|$|The {{discovery}} of novel light responsive adsorbents for carbon capture and release is reported {{here for the}} first time. These materials were found to exhibit dynamic or static photoswitchable properties in the broadband or visible light range during CO 2 adsorption measurements. Prior to the publication of my work, no dynamic photoswitchable adsorbent or full utilisation of visible light to trigger carbon capture and release was known. Thus the pioneering work presented in this thesis provides a significant breakthrough for the carbon capture technologies that could potentially allow the process to be operated at a significantly lower cost and energy than conventional methods. Commonly, the separation of CO₂ from a stream of gases involves the chemisorption of CO₂ by amines, the release from which is triggered by pressure and temperature. Although it is an effective process, amine degradation and regeneration are the main problems in post-combustion capture technologies. The regeneration of amines requires a large energy input which can result in ~ 30 % reduction in power plant capacity. Such limitations prompted research on different sorbent materials that display reversible adsorption using low cost triggers. While temperature, pressure, pH and microwave stimuli responsive materials have potential applications in gas adsorption technologies, light, particularly in the visible light range is the least disruptive stimulus for triggering carbon capture and release efficiently and it is highly abundant in nature, in the form of sunlight. New classes of porous materials: Metal-organic Frameworks (MOFs) and porous aromatic frameworks (PAFs) were explored as potential CO₂ sorbent materials due to their excellent performance in CO₂ apture and tunable properties. To achieve highly efficient utilisation of sunlight in carbon capture processes, porous materials with light responsive properties were developed according to the energy levels in the solar spectrum. The solar spectrum consists of 7 % ultraviolet, 47 % visible and 46 % infrared light. The concept of using non-filtered light as a practical approach was ideal. However, the use of filtered light to eliminate UV light and obtain visible light irradiation was also attractive as it constitutes the major fraction of solar radiation intensity. Furthermore, it is more environmentally friendly and greater exposure due to deeper light penetration could be achieved. Thus porous adsorbents that could respond to light in the broadband range or specifically in the visible light range were developed. In the course of the research project, four novel light responsive materials were successfully developed; two of which respond in the broadband light range and the other respond in the visible light range. The first dynamically photoswitchable MOF (Zn(AzDC) (4, 4 ’-BPE) 0. 5) for reversible carbon capture and release was reported. The MOF contained azobenzene and stilbene derivative linker molecules, in which photoirradiation resulted in the fast-bending motion of these molecules. Thus, up to 42 % and 64 % static and dynamic photoresponse were achieved respectively. This was the highest dynamic photoresponse obtained at the time of publication. The development of more broadband light responsive adsorbents was conducted <b>further</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>research.</b> The work led to the {{discovery of}} photoresponsive PAF containing diarylethene (DArE) guest molecules (DArE@PAF- 1). The dynamic carbon capture and release was triggered by the interaction between photoactive DArE molecules with the PAF. At high guest loading concentration, photoresponse can reach up to 24 %. As earlier work showed great promise for light triggered carbon capture applications, improvements were focused on using more penetrating light trigger, such as visible light. As a result, an adsorbent that could respond exclusively to visible light was developed. Furthermore, unique adsorption behaviour was obtained for a reversible carbon capture and release process. The introduction of visible light guest molecules (methyl red, MR) into the host (Mg-MOF- 74) displayed a pressure-gate system, in which light could be used to tune the gate-opening pressure. Photoirradiation of the sample resulted in the photoswitching of the guest molecules, whereby lesser contact with the host allowed more adsorption sites to be accessible. Thus upon irradiation, a significant increase in CO₂ uptake adsorption of up to 84 % was obtained. This is the highest photoresponse ever reported to date under static condition using visible light trigger. Further development led to the discovery of a water stable adsorbent that is visible light responsive. Again, methyl red (MR) was used as the visible light responsive molecule. The incorporation of the guest molecule into water stable MIL- 53 (Al) resulted in a similar photoresponse trend, in which prolonged irradiation resulted in the increase in CO₂ uptake adsorption of up to 9 % at lower guest loading (15 wt %) and 46 % at higher guest loading (50 wt %). The light responsive nature and recyclability of these adsorbents represents a new strategy for lowering the cost and energy for sorbent regeneration, a main problem associated with conventional carbon capture technologies...|$|E
