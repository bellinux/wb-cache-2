40|$|This paper {{describes}} the definitive acquisition system {{selected for the}} measurement of the closed orbit and trajectory in the CERN-LHC and its transfer lines. The system {{is based on a}} Wide Band Time Normaliser (WBTN) followed by a 10 -bit ADC and a Digital Acquisition Board (DAB), the latter developed by TRIUMF, Canada. The complete chain works at 40 MHz, so allowing the position of each bunch to be measured individually. In order to avoid radiation problems with the electronics in the LHC tunnel, all the digital systems will be kept on the surface and linked to the analogue front-ends via a single mode <b>fibre-optic</b> <b>connection.</b> Slow control via a WorldFIP field bus will be used in the tunnel for setting the various operational modes of the system and will also be used to check power supply statuses. As well as describing the hardware involved, some results will be shown from a complete prototype system installed on four pick-ups in the CERN-SPS using the full LHC topology...|$|R
25|$|In 1991, Telecom {{listed on}} the New Zealand, Australian and New York stock exchanges. The {{following}} year Telecom implemented a NZ$200 million <b>fibre-optic</b> cable <b>connection</b> between Australia and New Zealand. Also in this year, Roderick Deane was appointed CEO of the company. Then in 1993 Ameritech and Bell Atlantic reduced their share in Telecom to a combined 49.6% and BellSouth New Zealand Limited (BellSouth), subsequently acquired by Vodafone, set up the first mobile network to compete with Telecom.|$|R
40|$|An NIR {{reflectance}} sensor, {{with a large}} {{field of}} view and a <b>fibre-optic</b> <b>connection</b> to a spectrometer for measuring light backscatter at 980 nm, was used to monitor the syneresis process online during cheese-making {{with the goal of}} predicting syneresis indices (curd moisture content, yield of whey and fat losses to whey) over a range of curd cutting programmes and stirring speeds. A series of trials were carried out in an 11 L cheese vat using recombined whole milk. A factorial experimental design consisting of three curd stirring speeds and three cutting programmes, was undertaken. Milk was coagulated under constant conditions and the casein gel was cut when the elastic modulus reached 35 Pa. Among the syneresis indices investigated, the most accurate and most parsimonious multivariate model developed was for predicting yield of whey involving three terms, namely light backscatter, milk fat content and cutting intensity (R 2 = 0. 83, SEy = 6. 13 g/ 100 g), while the best simple model also predicted this syneresis index using the light backscatter alone (R 2 = 0. 80, SEy = 6. 53 g/ 100 g). In this model the main predictor was the light backscatter response from the NIR light back scatter sensor. The sensor also predicted curd moisture with a similar accuracy. ...|$|R
40|$|There are {{a number}} of avenues for the {{transmission}} of data to and from Australian households. The most common of these is the public switched telephone network (PSTN). Other mediums include cable (both coaxial and <b>fibre-optic),</b> satellite <b>connections</b> and microwave transmission. The term 2 ̆ 7 broadband 2 ̆ 7 can be used to describe any of these mediums when they provide a high speed connection greater than 200 kilobits per second (kbps). (1) Broadband thus offers Australians the opportunity to access the Internet and to obtain high volume data, such as audio or video material, at faster speeds...|$|R

40|$|The {{spectral}} {{range of the}} existing CL spectrometer (#approx# 300 nm - 850 nm) was extended to the near infrared region {{of the electromagnetic spectrum}} by adding a liquid nitrogen-cooled germanium (Ge) diode detector. A special adapter was constructed in order to use both the existing and the near infrared apparatus in quick succession. The {{spectral range}} of the modified CL spectrometer was between #approx# 300 nm (4. 13 eV) and #approx# 1800 nm (0. 69 eV). The efficiency of the spectrometer was increased by #approx# 3 orders of magnitude by replacing the inefficient <b>fibre-optic</b> based <b>connection</b> with a more efficient aluminium mirror-based connection, by introducing a GaAs photomultipliers (PMT) and by carefully aligning the optical components. The efficiency of the near infrared CL spectrometer was increased by #approx# 3 orders of magnitude by adding a phase sensitive detection apparatus. The monochromator wavelength error was measured to be between #approx# - 1. 1 nm and + 1. 9 nm. The absolute response of the spectrometer was measured for the first time using a novel calibration procedure which correctly reproduced the throughput occurring during routine CL analysis. Using this spectrometer, quantitative measurements of CL intensity may be made with a precision of up to #approx# 7 % in the near infrared region of the spectrum. The modified CL spectrometer had a spatial resolution of up to #approx# 200 nm and was able to detect up to #approx# 1 in 6300 photons/s in the near infrared region of the spectrum. This quantitative CL spectrometer was used to measure the black-body temperature of tungsten-strip lamps with a precision of #approx# 1 - 2 %. The lamps may be used as tertiary radiance standards to measure the absolute response of spectrometers between #approx# 500 nm and #approx# 1050 nm. The CL spectrometer was used to study MOVPE grown InGaAsP/InP-based mesa overgrowths and InGaAsP/InP-based butt-coupled laser-waveguide devices, to be used for the fabrication of opto-electronic integrated circuits (OEICs). Growth induced defects (threading dislocations) produced by 'Grappe' defect clusters present in the substrate were identified in the overgrowths using spectral CL analysis. The measurements also showed that non-radiative recombination centres were present in the lasers and that significant compositional variation and significant elastic strain were present in the devices. These deleterious processes caused considerable light and carrier leakage in the butt-coupled structures. They were also thought to accelerate the operation-induced degradation mechanisms and to be responsible for high threshold currents in the laser structures. The modified CL spectrometer was used {{for the first time to}} estimate the quantum efficiency of heavily- dislocated bulk InP material: by comparing experimentally measured CL efficiencies with CL efficiencies calculated from Monte Carlo simulations. The quantum efficiency, which was as low as #approx# 0. 05 % was found to vary strongly with the beam energy. The estimated quantum efficiencies could be accounted for by the presence of a high dislocation density (N_d #approx# 1. 5 x 10 " 9 cm"-" 2) or by an absorption coefficient which was #approx# 10 times higher than the literature value.

40|$|Only a year ago, East Africa was {{the last}} major region on Earth without <b>fibre-optic</b> {{broadband}} Internet <b>connections.</b> People were forced to rely on painfully slow and prohibitively expensive satellite connections. However, the recent arrival of three submarine fibre-optic cables into the Indian Ocean port of Mombasa has now fundamentally altered the connectivity of the region. The expectations for the cable are high. Tanzania‘s President, Jakaya Kikwete, for example, sees the cable {{as a way to}} allow East Africans to ―become part of the global economy. ‖ However, such projections are often made in the absence of data about current East African communications practices. This paper therefore aims to address the changing communications ecology and the effects of the region‘s newfound connectivity. It focuses on a sector of Kenya‘s economy that has been touted as a major growth area and has been assigned a central role in Kenya‘s long-term national development plan: business process outsourcing (BPO). The paper presents initial results from the first stage of a multi-year project. Three data sources are compared: discussions of the economic effects of the cables in local and foreign media, mentions of expected effects of the cables in Kenya‘s national development plan (Vision 2030), and a series of interviews with managers of small and medium enterprises in the BPO sector. The paper specifically addresses the following five research questions: (I) how are the potential effects of the East African fibre optic link represented in political and public discourse within Kenya and Rwanda?; (II) how are ICTs, including mobile devices, old satellite and new broadband Internet connectivity, variably integrated into value chains and flows of knowledge, commodities and capital?; (III) are there any observable innovative uses of broadband connectivity or unexpected challenges to broadband use?; (IV) how are changes in the use of methods of communication and Internet access linked to altered socio-economic conditions of economic actors?; and (V) how do those changes differ from academic, public and political discourses surrounding potential effects? While huge sums of money have been invested to bring broadband to East Africa, largely to encourage economic growth, very little empirical research has been conducted to examine the effectiveness of Internet connectivity as a tool of development. As such, it is hoped that this paper can contribute not only to debates surrounding connectivity and Internet access, but will also provide the beginnings of a robust evidence base crucial in shaping future rounds of ICT related development projects in low-income countries...|$|R
