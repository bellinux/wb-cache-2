Morrissey {{already knew the}} directors of the films, enjoyed reading the script and had either worked with his co-stars on other projects, or wanted to work with them. He liked the flaws in the Jobson character and that he differs from typical vigilante police officers portrayed on television. Morrissey said of Jobson, [...] "I think he sets out to be a <b>good</b> <b>cop,</b> he tries to do his job well but he gets involved in some corruption and realises that being a 'bit' corrupt is like being a 'bit' pregnant. You either are or you're not." [...] He received a Best Actor nomination from the Broadcasting Press Guild for the role. At the end of the year, Morrissey played Bobby Dykins in the John Lennon biopic Nowhere Boy (2009). As a self-confessed [...] "Beatles geek", Morrissey relished the opportunity to star in the film about Lennon's childhood.|$|E

40|$|Coping with {{academic}} difficulties {{at a university}} was based on six aspects: Motivation and Planning, Friends and Planning, Studying and Planning, Emotions, Spiritual Help and Coping by Doing Nothing. Stem-items for each aspect were conceptually ordered by difficulty. Each of the stem-items was answered from three perspectives, <b>Good</b> <b>Coping</b> Strategies, Actual Coping Strategies, and Stress Reduction Strategies. The three response categories were No, not on any occasion this semester; Yes, on 1 to 3 occasions this semester, and Yes, on 4 or more occasions this semester. The convenience sample was 337 students studying education at an Australian university and data were analysed with a Rasch measurement model. A scale was created in which the difficulties of the items were ordered from easy to hard and the student measures of Coping were ordered from low to high. Coping by Doing Nothing and Using Spiritual Help stem-items didn 2 Ì† 7 t fit the measurement model and were deleted. This left an effective item sample of 21 (7 stem-items times 3). The proportion of observed student variance considered true was 0. 88. The results supported the theory behind the construct of Coping as using Motivation and Planning, Friends and Planning, Studying and Planning, and Emotions, in which Expected <b>Good</b> <b>Coping</b> Strategies are easier than Actual Coping Strategies which, in turn, are easier than Stress Reducing Coping Strategies...|$|R

A contemporary reviewer for Popular Photography started by observing that [...] "the passionate photojournalistic essay of yesterday" [...] was [...] "an endangered species", before saying that it lived on in photobooks such as this one. The reviewer described Street Cops as [...] "celebrating the heroism, compassion, and humor of New York police professionals", and saying that the book [...] "is traditional and satisfying in that it accomplishes a blend rarely successful - or even attempted - these days: an organic fusion of words and photographs".|$|R
