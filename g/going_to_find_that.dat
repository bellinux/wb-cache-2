500|$|The ninth track [...] "The Hook Up" [...] has a reggae {{feel and}} {{features}} Spears {{singing in a}} Jamaican Patois accent. The ballad [...] "Shadow" [...] talks about how reminders of a lover can still linger after he’s gone. [...] "Brave New Girl" [...] lyrics talk about a young woman finding her passion and losing inhibitions. Backed by choppy, electro-funk beats, she sings in a bouncy near-rap, [...] "She's gonna pack her bags, she's going to find her way, she's going to get right out of this/ She don't want New York, she don't want L.A., she's <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>find</b> <b>that</b> special kiss." [...] The song incorporates elements of the music of No Doubt, Blondie and Madonna. [...] "Everytime" [...] begins with a piano introduction accompanying Spears's breathy vocals, which build from soft to strong throughout the song. [...] "Everytime" [...] lyrics are a plea for forgiveness for inadvertently hurting a former lover. In the song, the singer explains she feels unable to continue in lines such as [...] "Everytime I try to fly I fall / Without my wings I feel so small". During an interview with MTV, Spears said about the song, [...] "It's about heartbreak, it's about your first love, your first true love. That's something all people can relate to, because you all have that first love that you think you're {{going to be with}} the rest of your life." [...] When asked if [...] "Everytime" [...] was about Timberlake, she responded [...] "I'll let the song speak for itself." [...] The Rishi Rich's Desi Kulcha Remix of [...] "Me Against the Music" [...] removes the original melody of the song and adds a clattering backbeat and Punjabi shouts. In [...] "The Answer", Spears sings that her lover is the answer to all her needs: [...] "Who can hold me tight, keep me warm through the night? / Who can wipe my tears when it's wrong, make it right? / Who can give me love till I'm satisfied? / Who's the one I need in my life?". In [...] "Don't Hang Up", she pleads on the phone for her lover to keep her satisfied long-distance.|$|E
2500|$|Visconti, who {{accepted}} an interviewer's {{suggestion that he}} was Bowie's [...] "voice on earth", commented on the album to the international press and provided insights into the individual tracks. The songs cover {{a wide spread of}} subjects and are largely observational: most probe the mind-sets of different individuals. [...] "Valentine's Day" [...] is about a high school shooter. [...] "I'd Rather Be High" [...] related the story of a Second World War soldier. Visconti described the material as [...] "extremely strong and beautiful". He added [...] "if people are looking for classic Bowie they'll find it on this album, if they're looking for innovative Bowie, new directions, they're <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>find</b> <b>that</b> on this album too." [...] Visconti commented that 29 tracks were recorded for the album and suggested that some of the material left out of The Next Day could appear on a subsequent record. Visconti speculated that Bowie could return to the studio to produce a new album later in 2013, but this did not happen.|$|E

Here {{was a man}} who not only {{proposed}} to find this plantation on such a night, but to find either end of it you preferred. I dreadfully wanted to ask a question, but I was carrying about as many short answers as my cargo-room would admit of, so I held my peace. All I desired to ask Mr. Bixby was the simple question whether he was ass enough to really imagine he was <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>find</b> <b>that</b> plantation on a night when all plantations were exactly alike and all the same color. But I held in. I used to have fine inspirations of prudence in those days.|$|E

Yes, Sir, I have just as much right in this Old Pasture as he has, and if {{he thinks he can}} drive me out he is <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>find</b> <b>that</b> he was never more mistaken in his life!

[...] And I pointed at a spot closer to shore. [...] "See that, man!" [...] Some flowers and grasses and another leafy branch floated toward us. We both scanned {{the water and the}} coastline. Bradley evidently discovered something, or at least thought that he had. He called down for a bucket and a rope, and when they were passed up to him, he lowered the former into the sea and drew it in filled with water. Of this he took a taste, and straightening up, looked into my eyes with an expression of elation--as much as to say [...] "I told you so!" ...|$|E

All figures show that social media are a key factor in generating clicks for the traditional outlets, crushing the role of direct clicking and search engine mediation.

Is this process <b>going</b> endlessly <b>to</b> a fragmented milieu with the risk of killing the news consuming process, or the media are <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>find</b> patterns <b>that</b> in the near future will involve the audience with longer news format and more engagement? Are the media relentlessly degrading in the logic of “clickbait”, converting the information as a common good to sell, ignoring totally the quality of the news, and killing the relation with the consumers? How is the Albanian media landscape reacting, during the digital transition for implementing renewed business models needed to survive in the new reality?

40|$|The present paper {{examines}} Eugene O’Neill’s three selected plays, Anna Christie, The Iceman Cometh and The Hairy Ape, in {{the light}} of cultural studies by focusing on finding the notion of the "other", here women, blacks and the working class. The chosen groups here are among the ones that have been "otherized" by the white, male, bourgeois society. In this study, through the elements of cultural studies, it is shown that the mentioned groups are treated as Others because of their gender, class or race which are considered as inferior ones by the Power. We are <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>find</b> out <b>that</b> thinking in terms of binary oppositions is not an acceptable point of view in cultural studies. Therefore, the boundary between the superiority of the Power and inferiority of the Other is broken in this approach. O’Neill’s view point in the selected plays is in line with the core ideas in cultural studies. His wide point of view toward the events of his country and his pluralistic and skeptical outlook does not let any simple categorization or generalization takes place in his works. He criticizes the dominant discourses of the society and makes room for other voices to be heard...|$|R
