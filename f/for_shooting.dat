40|$|Micropropagation {{technique}} {{is applied to}} produce large number of plants. Juvenile explants and culture medium are two crucial factors that influence the success. The aims {{of this study were}} to determine culture medium that was effective to induce shoot and to produce plantlests from embryo culture of Pinus merkusii. Screening of five cytokines and five basal medium were carried aut. Then, explants wee cultured on the best cytokine and basal medium for plant regeneration. The results showed that BAP was the best cytokine type; LP and GD medium were the best medium compositions <b>for</b> <b>shoots</b> induction. GD medium supplemented by high consentration BAP showed the best medium <b>for</b> <b>shoots</b> induction. Solid GD medium containing 0, 25 uM BAO was effective <b>for</b> multiple <b>shoots.</b> Liquid GD medium without plant hormone was the best composition <b>for</b> <b>shoots</b> elongation.

5|$|In late November 2011, {{the site}} of a former BJ's Wholesale Club in Norcross, Georgia was {{converted}} in appearance to a Costco <b>for</b> <b>shooting.</b> On January 23, 2012, Hill announced that filming had concluded. Multiple scene takes were made, allowing the cast to follow the script as written and inject their own improvisations. Special effects company Legacy Effects provided creature designs and effects for the aliens. The alien costume featured an animatronic head, remotely controlled by three people. The suit was hot even in cold areas, and had to be unzipped to let Doug Jones cool off between takes. The costume was enhanced with CGI in a number of ways, including replacing arms and dilating pupils (which Schaffer thought made the creature seem more alive).|$|E
