40|$|In {{response}} to {{reports that the}} contamination of food can occur during the on-farm primary phase of food production, we report data that describes a possible cost-effective <b>intervention</b> <b>measure.</b> The effect of time before soil incorporation of livestock wastes spread {{to land on the}} rate of decline of zoonotic agents present in the waste was investigated. Fresh livestock wastes were inoculated with laboratory-cultured Salmonella, Listeria, and Campylobacter spp. and Escherichia coli O 157 before they were spead onto soil. Incorporation of the spread wastes was either immediate, delayed for 1 week, or did not occur at all. Bacterial decline was monitored over time and found to be significantly more rapid for all waste types when they were left on the soil surface. There {{were no significant differences in}} initial bacterial decline rates when wastes were spread in summer or winter. Our results indicate that not incorporating contaminated livestock wastes into soil is a potential <b>intervention</b> <b>measure</b> that may help to limit the spread of zoonotic agents further up the food chain. The implications of these findings are discussed in relation to current advice for livestock waste disposal. Food can become contaminated with pathogenic microor-ganisms at all stages of manufacture and processing (13). How-ever, there is a recognized potential for the on-farm transfer of pathogens to food during primary production (32). Livestoc...|$|E

40|$|Thesis (M. Ed) North-West University, Mafikeng Campus, 2012 Intervention for students' antisocial {{behaviour}} is {{a challenging}} issue for teachers {{in secondary schools}}. Even though Government has implemented <b>intervention</b> <b>measures</b> in secondary schools to assist teachers in interveni. ng in curbing antisocial behaviour by students, the problems of student misconduct still prevail. The {{purpose of this study}} was to investigate <b>intervention</b> <b>measures</b> employed to curb antisocial bebaviour by students in a secondary school in Lobatse Botswana. The researcher was interested in the types of <b>intervention</b> <b>measures</b> employed by teachers in the school and the effectiveness of those implemented by Government, which are the pastoral care and the guidance and counseling programmes. The researcher was interested in assessing the impact of these <b>intervention</b> <b>measures</b> in assisting teachers to curb antisocial behaviour by the students. To accomplish this aim seven teachers were purposively sampled as they were the relevant people affected by the area of study. The research was conducted in the form of a case study. It was based on the qualitative approach in research. Multi methods of collecting data, such as interviews, document analysis and observation were used in order to ensure validity and reliability. Based on the respc. nses from the empirical research, as well as personal observation, the results of the study revealed that, teachers mainly apply punitive measures to curb antisocial behaviour by students. The <b>intervention</b> <b>measures</b> of pastoral care and guidance and counseling experience challenges in implementing their interventions, teachers seem to rely more on the pastoral programme than on guidance and counseling to. assist in issues of student's problem behaviour. Teachers indicated dissatisfaction with the input by the guidance and counseling programme. They complained about the inactiveness of the guidance department in assisting them to curb students' antisocial behaviour. The research recommends that, the guidance and counseling programmes be upgraded. Teachers require in-service training on the application of <b>intervention</b> <b>measures</b> that are more positive and have a long term impact on students' behaviour. Teachers need to withdraw from implementing punitive measures like punishment, to curb students' antisocial behaviour. <b>Intervention</b> <b>measures</b> such as punishment have been seen to have a negative impact on the students as punitive measures may cause the students to become rebellious and stubborn. Positive <b>intervention</b> <b>measures</b> have a lasting impact on students' characters and behaviour. Positive interventions help to instill character traits such as responsibility and accountability in students'. So teachers need to adhere to such <b>intervention</b> <b>measures</b> when curbing students' antisocial behaviour. Master...|$|R

40|$|The {{objectives}} were {{to evaluate the}} use of surveillance results in hospitals participating in the PREZIES project. Methods: a questionnaire to determine distribution and use of surveillance results, influence on policy and/or decisions on infection prevention. From the 48 contacts asked to complete the questionnaire, 79 % responded. The results of the surveillance carried out in one's own hosptital were (partly) distributed in practically all cases to infection committee and to surgeons, as well as, in most cases, to nursing units and management. In comparison with the other PREZIES hospitals, the questionnaire was distributed in almost every case to the infection committee and surgeons, and less often to nursing units and management. The report on results was used in half the hospitals to provide information and, according to the contacts in all the hospitals, contributed to more awareness on infection prevention. In almost half the hospitals the results led to an <b>intervention</b> <b>measure.</b> A number of contacts in these hospitals stated that the measure led to decreased surgical site infections. In many hospitals, the time following the introduction of the <b>intervention</b> <b>measure</b> was too short to be able to assess the effect. In more than half the hospitals the surveillance supported the policy and/or decisions on infection prevention. Eighty-four per cent of the hospitals were pleased with the PREZIES project in its current form, and 89 % wish to continue their participation in the national surveillance...|$|E
30|$|The {{results from}} this study point to {{consistent}} and severe alterations in plant composition and diversity that are possibly attributable to the cumulative long-term consequences of piosphere-concentrated grazing. The impact could potentially be greater, owing to the proliferation of piospheres in the Kenyan rangelands as a water <b>intervention</b> <b>measure.</b> Range managers should therefore seek conservation measures that can sustainably protect forage species that are sensitive to grazing. Grazing exclusions have been known to preserve plant species composition in most rangelands of the world Todd (2006). This is because these rest periods allow for plant regeneration and seed bank restoration after seasons of intense trampling and defoliation.|$|E

Although significant gender differences {{have been found in}} bystander intervention research, the results have been incongruent with little explanation about the relationship between gender and bystander interventions. This study assessed the relationship between conformity to masculine role norms and bystander intervention behavior. In this study, 200 college students completed the Conformity to Masculine Norms Inventory- 46 (CMNI- 46) to determine the relationship between conformity to masculine norms and the level of bystander intervention selected on the Bystander <b>Intervention</b> <b>Measure</b> (BIM). It was hypothesized that a significant main effect would exist between conformity to masculine norms and the types of bystander interventions selected. Participants also completed surveys on bystander self-efficacy, bystander intervention decision making, and prosocial tendencies (Prosocial Tendencies Measure). Four hypotheses were developed for this study. It was hypothesized {{that there would be a}} statistically significant difference in scores on the five CMNI- 46 subscales of winning, emotional control, risk-taking, violence, and self-reliance and the degree of involvement and immediacy of bystander interventions the four subscales of the Bystander <b>Intervention</b> <b>Measure</b> (BIM); that the five CMNI- 46 subscales will still account for more variance regarding the degree of involvement and immediacy of bystander interventions even after controlling for prosocial tendencies from the PTM subscales; that there would be a statistically significant difference in scores on the five CMNI- 46 subscales and the six PTM subscales, and that the five CMNI- 46 subscales would predict bystander self-efficacy and decision making scores...|$|E
40|$|Dairy {{farming in}} western {{countries}} with cubicle housing is an efficient way of dairy farming. Though, a disadvantage is the high prevalence and incidence of foot disorders (clinical and subclinical), which cause high economic losses and also seriously impair the welfare of dairy cattle. To point out the importance of reducing the amount and severity of foot disorders, advice to farmers should include information about {{the scale of the}} problem and the consequences in terms of economics and animal welfare. To provide support in making decisions on implementing <b>intervention</b> <b>measures,</b> insight into costs and benefits of different measures should be available. The objective of this study, therefore, is to provide more insight into the costs and benefits, for farmer and cow, of different <b>intervention</b> <b>measures</b> to improve dairy cow foot health. <b>Intervention</b> <b>measures</b> were modeled when they were applicable on a dairy farm with cubicle housing and when sufficient information was available in literature. Net costs were calculated as the difference between the costs of the measure and the economic benefits resulting from the measure. Welfare benefits were calculated as well. Cost-effective measures are: improving lying surface (mattress and bedding, € 7 and € 1 /cow per year, respectively), reducing stocking density (break even) and performing additional foot trimming (€ 1 /cow per year). Simultaneously, these measures have a relative high welfare benefit. Labor costs {{play an important role in}} the cost-effectiveness of labor-intensive measures. More insight into cost-effectiveness and welfare benefits of <b>intervention</b> <b>measures</b> can help to prioritize when choosing between <b>intervention</b> <b>measures...</b>|$|R

40|$|This article {{investigates the}} reason for the {{continued}} scarce skills shortage, despite the recruitment of expatriates in academic institutions as an <b>intervention</b> <b>measure.</b> It argues that while the Human Resources Departments in South African universities motivate for the appointment of expatriates in the development of scarce skills, little monitoring is done to determine the effectiveness of this objective and, often, no performance instrument exists for such personnel. As such, the scarce skills to be developed continue to be wanting in the country. This article is conceptual and uses literature to argue about the hypothetical relation between the lack of a monitoring tool for expatriates and the continued scarce skills problems that universities cannot address. It concludes that the continued lack of a performance-monitoring instrument in South African universities for contracted expatriates will not solve the skills shortage problem experienced in South Africa...|$|E

One area in Sub Saharan Africa that continues to feel the devastating effects of malaria is in Nairobi, Kenya. This qualitative research study explored the attitudes of women in Nairobi, Kenya and how they view <b>intervention</b> <b>measures</b> already introduced by public health care experts in fighting malaria. The phenomenological research approach used purposeful sampling to recruit 16 women from Nairobi, Kenya to participate in semi-structured, open-ended interviews. The ecological systems theory was used as a lens of analysis to help illuminate the views of women on already-introduced malaria <b>intervention</b> <b>measures</b> in Nairobi, Kenya. Nvivo 10 helped manage data and the interpretative phenomenological analysis was used to analyze data and identify themes and subthemes through coding. The findings from this study indicate that (a) there is a disconnect within the systems, especially between public health officials and ordinary citizens, and (b) ordinary citizens felt that <b>intervention</b> <b>measures</b> already introduced have not been effectively implemented. The recommendations derived from the study will improve relationships between public health officials and ordinary citizens in order to effectively implement malaria control measures already introduced. This study will benefit public health officials, ordinary citizens in Nairobi, and other health care providers all over the world.

40|$|This thesis {{examines}} two Small Scale Irrigation Schemes in the Kassena Nankana West District of the Upper East Region of Ghana, as a poverty <b>intervention</b> <b>measure.</b> And {{the aim is}} {{to study}} how a relevant poverty <b>intervention</b> <b>measure</b> can be effectively introduced and made to empower the people as it has been designed to do. The study, through personal interviews using the questionnaire, Focus Group Discussions (FGDs) and personal observation, discovered that the people were generally satisfied with the performance of the schemes. However, {{within the framework of the}} Sustainable Livelihoods Approach (SLA), the study uncovered several obstacles to the optimum performance of the schemes. First, the implementation of the schemes was not properly done as stakeholders were not actively involved in the process. Issues of equitable distribution and access to land, water and inputs as well as technical support services were not adequately addressed. Second, the ability to operate and manage the schemes with some degree of efficiency for optimum results was missing in the various communities. The outcome was a minimum level of performance and the ultimate acceptance of the status qou. So despite claims by the people that they were satisfied with the performance of the schemes, which was also backed by statistics gathered in the field, the study concludes otherwise. This apparent divergent view is a result of the low expectations of the people in these communities regarding the performance of the schemes due partly to their inability to properly operate and manage the schemes. Third, there was no proper coordination between departments relating to the schemes. This meant challenges facing the schemes were not being addressed as roles were not clearly defined for the various departments. The study concludes that there is no substitute for building the capacity of the people to take control of their own affairs if poverty intervention measures are to yield a substantial benefit for the people concerned and be devoid of political talk...|$|E

40|$|AbstractThe aim of {{this study}} is to review current studies on the effect of {{acupuncture}} therapy on bone marrow suppression after chemotherapy. The authors of the present paper have searched related literature over the past 10 years at home and abroad, analyzing the features and the effects of acupuncture therapy (including acupuncture, moxibustion, point injection, point application, etc.) for treating myelosuppression after tumor chemotherapy. We also discuss the year of publication, document type, acupuncture therapy, acupoint selection, and adverse effects with figures. We analyzed 159 articles related to acupuncture therapy from 2004 to 2013, and the analysis revealed that point injection was the most frequently used therapy for clinical applications, and that Zusanli (ST 36) was the most frequently used acupoint.

40|$|Abstract In Tanzania, {{the first}} cases of {{schistosomiasis}} {{were reported in}} the early 19 th century. Since then, various studies have reported prevalences of up to 100 % in some areas. However, for many years, {{there have been no}} sustainable control programmes and systematic data from observational and control studies are very limited in the public domain. To cover that gap, the present article reviews the epidemiology, malacology, morbidity, and the milestones the country has made in efforts to control schistosomiasis and discusses future control approaches. The available evidence indicates that, both urinary and intestinal schistosomiasis are still highly endemic in Tanzania and cause significant morbidity. Mass drug administration using praziquantel, currently used as a key <b>intervention</b> <b>measure,</b> has not been successful in decreasing prevalence of infection. There is therefore an urgent need to revise the current approach for the successful control of the disease. Clearly, these need to be integrated control measures. </p...|$|E
