5|$|The sterile diploid <b>hybrid</b> <b>of</b> A.montanum and A.platyneuron, which resembles A.bradleyi {{except for}} its {{abortive}} spores and smaller sori, was not collected until 1972, at Crowder's Mountain, Georgia. Even though the diploid hybrid is rarely collected, allozyme {{studies show that}} A.bradleyi has multiple origins; that is, different populations of A.bradleyi have originated from the chromosome doubling of independently formed diploids. Despite their independent origins, these populations are probably interfertile and not reproductively isolated from one another.|$|E
