5|$|Though {{the weapon}} may be {{depicted}} as an inanimate gada, Kaumodaki sometimes appears personified {{as a woman}} known as Gadadevi or Gadanari in sculptures of Vishnu. In depictions that use this version, Vishnu rests one of his <b>hands</b> <b>on</b> <b>her</b> head, while she herself holds the gada, is seen emerging from it or has the gada carved on her head/crown.|$|E
5|$|The car {{stops in}} front of the club Crazy Horse. The {{following}} scenes show the singer emerging in a different set with a black background, as well as dancing atop a grand piano. Later, she is seen with female <b>hands</b> <b>on</b> <b>her</b> body as she dances seductively. Other scenes show her wearing lingerie and performing a pole dance with several other female dancers. Shortly afterwards, Beyoncé performs a choreographed chair dance across a purple background as Jay-Z is seen in the audience watching her while smoking a cigar. The end of the video shows the singer dancing with another woman next to her to a projected cheetah print. The last seconds cut to the breakfast table where Beyoncé is seen. For the video, the singer wears an archival corset by Christian Lacroix, lace gloves by Chanel, and a crystal mask by Atelier Swarovski.|$|E
25|$|Soon after, he is {{reported}} to have healed a sick woman by laying his <b>hands</b> <b>on</b> <b>her.</b> Dozens of apparent miracles were subsequently performed by Kimbangu, and he gained followers from surrounding villages and towns. The official Catholic organizations protested to the authorities, and the Protestant church abandoned him. The economic effects of Kimbangu's ministry were being felt, with thousands of Congolese leaving their work to listen to Kimbangu speak. In June the Belgians arrested him for inciting revolution and civil disobedience. Four months later he was sentenced to death. After an international outcry, Albert I of Belgium commuted the sentence to life imprisonment. He died 30 years later in prison, in 1951.|$|E

25|$|Abraham settled between Kadesh and Shur in {{the land}} of the Philistines. While he was living in Gerar, Abraham openly claimed that Sarah was his sister. Upon {{discovering}} this news, King Abimelech had her brought to him. God then came to Abimelech in a dream and declared that taking her would result in death because she was a man's wife. Abimelech had not laid <b>hands</b> <b>on</b> <b>her,</b> so he inquired if he would also slay a righteous nation, especially since Abraham had claimed that he and Sarah were siblings. In response, God told Abimelech that he did indeed have a blameless heart and that is why he continued to exist. However, should he not return the wife of Abraham back to him, God would surely destroy Abimelech and his entire household. Abimelech was informed that Abraham was a prophet who would pray for him.|$|E
25|$|The English fleet {{consisted}} of 5 ships: the Royal carracks Jesus of Lübeck (leased from Queen Elizabeth I) under John Hawkins, the Minion under John Hampton, and the barques Judith under Hawkins' cousin Francis Drake, Angel and Swallow. A captured Portuguese caravel joined the privateers near {{the coast of}} Ghana, where the English competed with Portuguese slave traders. The ship was renamed Grace of God. A seventh ship, the barque William and John, sailed back home before the battle, but after reaching Ireland on February 1569, she was lost with all <b>hands</b> <b>on</b> <b>her</b> way back to England. Following a full year of plundering and illegal trading, Hawkins decided to anchor his ships in the port of San Juan de Ulúa on 15 September for repairs and resupply before the return voyage to England. But while they were carrying out this reprovisioning, a Spanish escort fleet under command of Don Francisco Luján also arrived in the port.|$|E
25|$|Alec Smart (Ricky Diamond) - The sly and untrustworthy tenant {{who moves}} into the flat above Bodger's in Series 7. He was always {{thinking}} up schemes to make money, often tricking Mrs Dribelle and Bodger in the process. He sucks up to Mrs Dribelle while secretly trying to scam her. In the episode 'Mrs Dribelle's Big Day' he asks her to marry him, {{with the intention of}} getting his <b>hands</b> <b>on</b> <b>her</b> money. After Mrs Dribelle discovers his plan, she throws him out of the flat. A year later when Bodger and Badger move to Puddleford at the beginning of Series 8 to run a hotel, they are horrified to discover that Mr Smart is their next door neighbour once again. He is also running a hotel, but never seems to have any guests and is always trying to steal Bodger's or trying to outshine his rival in every despicable way possible. He was last seen in the episode 'Doggone' when he kidnapped China the dog in order to obtain a reward for finding him. As he is not seen or mentioned again in the series, it is assumed that he moved away from Puddleford or still lives next door but never mentioned.|$|E

25|$|Later, Lawrence Alamain {{comes to}} town. Jennifer {{believes}} that Lawrence thinks she is Katerina, the heiress to the Von Leuschner fortune, {{due to a}} confusion going back to when the real heiress (Carly Manning) and Jennifer were teenagers and they had switched dates. After a hurried wedding, Lawrence rapes Jennifer, admitting that he knew her real identity all along. Jack arrives to rescue Jennifer. Jack and Jennifer became engaged, but he calls off the wedding because he feels alienated from her. Jennifer is still unable to handle intimacy and is too ashamed to tell Jack that Lawrence raped her. Jack then marries Eve to help her get her <b>hands</b> <b>on</b> <b>her</b> $10 million inheritance. After Jennifer finally tells Jack the truth, she presses rape charges against Lawrence. Kimberly and Jack are able to record him confessing to the rape, and Lawrence is then sent to jail. Eve reluctantly grants Jack a divorce, and Jack and Jennifer are married. Soon after, a swindler named Hawk soon cheats {{them out of their}} money. He is caught, but the couple remains penniless. Jennifer then learns she is pregnant, but Jack's joy is not great. He thinks he is suffering a relapse of Hodgkin's disease. Though he is not ill, Jennifer goes to New York to do a TV show with Calliope. Jennifer gives birth later that year to a daughter, Abigail Johanna.|$|E
25|$|After a {{disastrous}} relationship with con man Ted Clayton, who brainwashes and drugs {{her in an}} attempt to get his <b>hands</b> <b>on</b> <b>her</b> fortune, Viki marries newspaper editor Clint Buchanan (Clint Ritchie) in 1982; he adopts both of her sons. Echo DiSavoy (Kim Zimmer), seeking revenge on Clint for her mother's murder, seduces him in 1983 to ruin his marriage, then fakes her own death and frames him for it. Clint is later exonerated after Echo is found alive, and he and Viki reunite. Viki is shocked to discover in 1985 that her former ward Tina Clayton (Evans) is in fact her half-sister, daughter of Viki's father Victor and not Ted. Thanks to the machinations of Tina's boyfriend Mitch Laurence (Roscoe Born), Viki succumbs to the pressure and Niki Smith returns. Posing as Viki, Niki divorces Clint; Viki later overcomes her illness with the realization that it had actually been triggered by her witnessing Victor and Irene in bed many years before. Clint and Viki remarry in 1986, and Viki gives birth to their daughter Jessica Buchanan in September 1986. Jessica is kidnapped shortly after birth by Allison Perkins (Barbara Garrick), a disciple of Mitch Laurence; Jessica is soon returned unharmed in December, and Allison institutionalized. In 1988, Viki learns that she married and gave birth to a child in high school with high school sweetheart Roger Gordon (Larry Pine), but father Victor had her hypnotized to forget the occurrences. With Viki's memory restored in 1989, she annuls her 1960s off-screen marriage to Roger and initiates a relationship with daughter Megan Gordon (Jessica Tuck), an actress on the soap opera (within a soap opera), Fraternity Row. Megan and Viki initially spar, but ultimately get past their initial conflicts and become close.|$|E
500|$|Dubh Artach {{lighthouse}} {{is located}} on a remote rock and warns seafarers away from the area itself and the nearby Torran Rocks. Originally it {{was considered to be}} an impossible site for a light, but the loss of the steamer Bussorah with all thirty-three <b>hands</b> <b>on</b> <b>her</b> maiden voyage in 1863 and of an astonishing 24 vessels in the area in a storm on 30–31 December 1865 encouraged positive action. Skerryvore is another remote lighthouse in the vicinity and at a height of [...] it is the tallest in Scotland.|$|E

500|$|In 2005, a {{director}} {{cut of the}} video leaked onto the Internet. It shows heavier scenes, like wounded and maimed soldiers, war scenes, images of poverty and death. In 2010, Slant Magazine placed this alternate video on the nineteenth place of decade's fifty best music videos list, stating: [...] "It isn't like either the video's message about viewing war {{as a form of}} popular entertainment or its striking, loaded images leave much room for misinterpretation. Prescient? Yes. Relevant? Surely. Subtle? Not so much." [...] This version of the video ends with the tossed grenade landing on the catwalk and Madonna putting her <b>hands</b> <b>on</b> <b>her</b> ears.|$|E
500|$|Between 1800 and 1854 thirty {{ships were}} wrecked on the reef; however, the {{requirement}} for a lighthouse was not only to warn seafarers away from Dhu Heartach itself, but also to guide them past the fearsome Torran Rocks, which lie between the Ross of Mull and Colonsay. Originally it {{was considered to be}} an impossible site for a light, but the loss of the steamer Bussorah with all thirty-three <b>hands</b> <b>on</b> <b>her</b> maiden voyage in 1863 and of an astonishing 24 vessels in the area in a storm on 30–31 December 1865 encouraged positive action under pressure from insurers Lloyd's of London and a Captain Bedford of the Admiralty. The engineering work was supervised by the famous Stevenson family of engineers, the brothers Thomas (father of Robert Louis) and David commencing work in 1866. Thomas noted that [...] "it would be a work of no ordinary magnitude".|$|E
500|$|The refrain {{is based}} on a Gm–E(add2)–B–F/A chord progression. Fraser McAlphine of the BBC wrote that Rihanna feels {{confined}} [...] "in a cell of [...] own creation". She sings without vibrato, a pulsating musical effect used to add expression. One commentator, The New York Times David Brownie, wrote that despite this, her voice subtly shows grief and regret. Eminem then [...] "zap out into a ballady rap": [...] "I can't tell you what it really is/ I can only tell you what it feels like." [...] The verses follow a Gm–E(add2)B–Fsus/A chord progression. Eminem regrets an end to an abusive, failed relationship, describing mutual violence and expressing both fondness and anger. The two artists' characters are portrayed in a romantic relationship when he responds to Rihanna by concluding the verse: [...] "I laid <b>hands</b> <b>on</b> <b>her.</b> I'll never stoop so low again/ I guess I don't know my own strength." [...] Rihanna sings the chorus again, backed by an electric guitar and a piano.|$|E

500|$|O'Neill {{states that}} bin Laden was {{standing}} behind a woman with his <b>hands</b> <b>on</b> <b>her</b> shoulders, pushing her forward. O'Neill immediately shot bin Laden twice in the forehead, then once more as bin Laden crumpled to the floor. Matt Bissonnette, who entered the room {{at about the same}} time, also claims to have fired shots into bin Laden's fallen body. Simultaneously, in these versions, one of bin Laden's wives, Amal Ahmed Abdul Fatah is said to have screamed at the SEALs in Arabic and motioned as if she were about to charge. The lead SEAL shot her in the leg, then grabbed both women and shoved them aside. The weapon used to kill bin Laden was an HK416 allegedly using 5.56mm NATO 77-grain OTM (open-tip match) rounds made by Black Hills Ammunition. The SEAL team leader radioed, [...] "For God and country—Geronimo, Geronimo, Geronimo" [...] and then, after being prompted by McRaven for confirmation, [...] "Geronimo E.K.I.A." [...] (enemy killed in action). Watching the operation in the White House Situation Room, Obama simply said, [...] "We got him." ...|$|E
500|$|The {{incident}} of the unwelcome band playing outside Marlinspike Hall, called the [...] "Marlinspike Prize Band" [...] (Harmonie de Moulinsart {{in the original}} French version), {{was based on a}} similar experience of Hergé's who was also obliged to serve a band with drinks. To add insult to injury, they gave a toast to [...] "Spirou", the cartoon character created by Robert Velter. Another influence for the band was a cutting of [...] "L'Orpheon France" [...] band. Whenever Castafiore fears her jewels her stolen, her expressions, which involve placing her <b>hands</b> <b>on</b> <b>her</b> face, were influenced by a photograph of her model in real life, Maria Callas, taken by Cecil Beaton in 1957. In page 43 of the book, Tintin is shown reading Robert Louis Stevenson's novel Treasure Island (1883), which was also one of Hergé's favourite books. The depiction of the Romani wagons and clothing was closely modelled on photographs of Romani communities that Hergé had consulted, and he depicted members of the group engaged in basket weaving and fortune telling after reading that the Romani engaged in such activities in the Oxford English Dictionary.|$|E
2500|$|His healing feats include {{getting rid}} of warts by wishing them on someone else, [...] "Someone who's already ugly with boil marks, I can fill up with warts." [...] He said he cured a man of heroin {{addiction}} and a woman of cystitis by laying his <b>hands</b> <b>on</b> <b>her</b> head and willing the affliction away. He is claimed to have cured a woman of cancer by sitting with her in a hospital {{for three days and}} nights, while holding her feet and pouring healing energy into her.|$|E

2500|$|In 1989, Unger curated a {{show called}} “In a Dark Vein,” at the Sculpture Center in New York. It {{featured}} work by women who used the human figure to shape feelings of fear, loss, and pain and was inspired by Unger's own struggle with cancer. [...] In this show, she {{tried to focus on}} a more naked and physical reality and the search for experience that is shared and elemental. [...] Unger included her bonded iron sculpture, Guardian, which both expresses and mediates suffering. [...] It shows a nude woman, cut off at the waist, with her <b>hands</b> <b>on</b> <b>her</b> hips. [...] The sculpture's mouth is like a pit facing the sky and her arms are like wings. [...] The earthly figure suggests a fertility goddess insisting on her ability to reproduce and crying to get out of her skin. “In a Dark Vein” was filled with representations of the female body shaped by a woman’s hand.|$|E
