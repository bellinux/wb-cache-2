5|$|The video {{features}} Beyoncé {{and her two}} companions dancing {{inside an}} infinity cove, which alternates {{between black and white}} and places the focus on the complex choreography. Throughout the video the women click their heels and shake their hips and legs. However, the main intention is to attract the viewers' attention toward their hands and ring <b>fingers</b> <b>as</b> they do the hand-twirl move. At one point during the video, the dancers run up to a wall, which, according to Frank Gatson Jr., pays homage to Shirley MacLaine's act in the 1969 film Sweet Charity. Toward the end of the video, Beyoncé flashes her own wedding ring on her finger.|$|E
5|$|Agents Scully and Doggett {{investigate}} the crash. Scully suggests a man {{stopped the car}} but Doggett points out {{that it would have}} required a dense block of steel to stop the car. Nora Pearce appears and asks what happened to Curtis Delario. Soon afterwards, Scully finds Delario’s body left in a garbage can nearby; his face has gaping holes in it. Autopsying the remains, Scully concludes that the five holes in the man’s face were made by human <b>fingers,</b> <b>as</b> someone reached into Delario’s head and pulled him out of the wrecked vehicle. Doggett finds a fresh fingerprint with the blood of Ray. Agent Doggett goes to see Nora Pearce and finds Harry Odell, who employed Ray Pearce at his salvage yard. Doggett asks about Ray, but Nora insists she saw Ray die; both do not believe Ray could be involved in Curtis’s death.|$|E

5|$|Athletes, {{including}} Stefan Effenberg, Ron Artest, Luis Suárez, Juan Pablo Montoya, Iván Rodríguez, Danny Graves, Jack McDowell, Natasha Zvereva, Josh Smith, Bryan Cox, and Johnny Manziel {{have been}} suspended or fined for making the gesture. José Paniagua was released by the Chicago White Sox after giving the middle finger to an umpire; he hasn't played in the majors since. Baseball executive Chub Feeney once resigned after giving the finger to fans on Fan Appreciation Night. Bud Adams, owner of the National Football League's Tennessee Titans, was fined US$250,000 for giving both middle fingers to the fans of the Buffalo Bills during a game.

25|$|The hand of God, which {{encompasses}} God's arm and <b>fingers</b> <b>as</b> well, {{is one of}} {{the most}} frequently employed anthropomorphisms of the Hebrew Bible. References to the hand of God occur numerous times in the Pentateuch alone, particularly in regards to the unfolding narrative of the Israelites' exodus from Egypt (cf. Exodus 3:19–20, Exodus 14: 3, 8, 31).|$|E

25|$|Another story {{surrounding}} the Fling {{claims that it}} is meant to imitate a stag; the story goes that a boy who saw a stag was asked to describe it by his father. He lacked the words, so danced instead; the position of the hands resembles the head and antlers of a stag. This urban legend hides the fact that Highlanders used to snap their <b>fingers</b> <b>as</b> they danced.|$|E

25|$|In the Susiya synagogue, {{the hand}} of God appears on the defaced remains of a marble bimah screen that perhaps once {{illustrated}} a biblical scene such as Moses Receiving the Law or the Binding of Isaac. Though the hand was subjected to intense iconoclastic hacking, the iconoclasts left some vestiges of the thumb and the receding fingers intact. A thumbnail has been carved into the thumb. Foerster asserts that {{the hand of}} God originally held a Torah scroll, identifying the small piece of raised marble located between the thumb and <b>fingers</b> <b>as</b> a Torah scroll.|$|E

25|$|An off {{break is}} bowled by holding the cricket {{ball in the}} palm of the hand with the seam running across under all the <b>fingers.</b> <b>As</b> the ball is released, the fingers roll down {{the right side of the}} ball (for a {{right-handed}} bowler), giving the ball a clockwise spin as seen from behind. When the ball bounces on the pitch, the spin causes it to deviate towards the right from the bowler's perspective, this is to the left from the batsman's point of view or towards the leg side of a right-handed batsman. The ball spins away from the off side.|$|E
25|$|Studies {{have also}} been {{performed}} on {{the components of the}} DNA translation mechanism. One desire of scientists creating synthetic biological circuits {{is to be able to}} control the translation of synthetic DNA in prokaryotes and eukaryotes. One study tested the adjustability of synthetic transcription factors (sTFs) in areas of transcription output and cooperative ability among multiple transcription factor complexes. Researchers were able to mutate zinc fingers, the DNA specific component of sTFs, to decrease their affinity for DNA, and thus decreasing the amount of translation. They were also able to use the zinc <b>fingers</b> <b>as</b> components of complex forming sTFs, which are the eukaryotic translation mechanisms.|$|E
25|$|The carillonneur or carillonist is {{the title}} of the {{musician}} who plays the carillon. The carillonneur usually sits in a cabin beneath the bells and presses down, with a loosely closed fist, on a series of baton-like keys arranged in the same pattern as a piano keyboard. The batons are almost never played with the <b>fingers</b> <b>as</b> one does a piano, though this is sometimes used as a special carillon playing technique. The keys activate levers and wires that connect directly to the bells' clappers; thus, as with a piano, the carillonneur can vary the intensity of the note according to the force applied to the key. In addition to the manual keys, the heavier bells are also played with a pedal keyboard. These notes can either be played with the hands or the feet.|$|E

25|$|In {{the course}} of a shift in low positions, the thumb of the left hand moves up or down the neck of the {{instrument}} so as to remain in the same position relative to the fingers (though the movement of the thumb may occur slightly before, or slightly after, the movement of the fingers). In such positions, the thumb is often thought of as an 'anchor' whose location defines what position the player is in. In very high positions, the thumb is unable to move with the <b>fingers</b> <b>as</b> the body of the instrument gets in the way. Instead, the thumb works around the neck of the instrument to sit at {{the point at which the}} neck meets the right bout of the body, and remains there while the fingers move between the high positions.|$|E
25|$|A leg {{break is}} bowled by holding the cricket {{ball in the}} palm of the hand with the seam running across under all the <b>fingers.</b> <b>As</b> the ball is released, the wrist is rotated to the left and the ball flicked by the ring finger, giving the ball an {{anti-clockwise}} spin as seen from behind. When the ball bounces on the pitch, the spin causes it to deviate towards the left from the bowler's perspective; this is to the right from the batsman's point of view, or towards the off side of a right-handed batsman. The ball spins away from the leg side, and this is where it gets the name leg break, meaning it breaks away from the leg. The turn is mostly when the ball pitches.|$|E
25|$|After he regains {{his body}} in the fourth book, Rowling {{describes}} Voldemort as having pale skin, a chalk-white, skull-like face, snake-like slits for nostrils, red eyes and cat-like slits for pupils, a skeletally thin body and long, thin hands with unnaturally long <b>fingers.</b> <b>As</b> mentioned in {{the first chapter of}} the seventh book, he also has no hair or lips. Earlier in life, as seen through flashbacks contained in the second and sixth books, Tom Marvolo Riddle was handsome and tall with pale skin, jet black hair, and dark brown eyes. He could charm many people with his looks. The transformation into his monstrous state {{is believed to have been}} the result of creating his Horcruxes and becoming less human as he continued to divide his soul. In the films, Voldemort's eyes are blue with round pupils.|$|E
