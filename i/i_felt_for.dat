Featured in the film are William Powell as Ziegfeld, Myrna Loy as Billie Burke, Luise Rainer as Anna Held, Nat Pendleton as Eugen Sandow, and Frank Morgan. Powell admitted to being [...] "amazed" [...] with the film after viewing it and was very grateful at having had the privilege to portray Ziegfeld, considering {{it to be a}} very important moment in his career. He said, [...] "After seeing this film I can see that most of the characters I have played before were contrived. They had no 'folks', as the character of Ziegfeld had in this picture. Their father was a pen and their mother was a bottle of ink. Here was a character with flesh, blood and sinews. <b>I</b> <b>felt</b> <b>for</b> {{the first time in my}} acting career I had tried the full measure of a man, regardless of my shortcomings in playing him." ...|$|E
500|$|The {{secondary}} crew of JAT Flight 367, {{flying from}} Stockholm to Belgrade with stopovers in Copenhagen and Zagreb, arrived in Denmark {{on the morning}} of 25 January 1972. According to Vulović, she was not scheduled to be on Flight 367 and JAT had confused her for another flight attendant also named Vesna. Nevertheless, Vulović says she was excited to travel to Denmark because it was her first time visiting the country. The crew had the entire afternoon and the following morning to themselves. Vulović wished to go sightseeing but her colleagues insisted that they go shopping. [...] "Everybody wanted to buy something for his or her family," [...] she recalled. [...] "So I had to go shopping with them. They seemed to know that they would die. They didn't talk about it, but I saw... <b>I</b> <b>felt</b> <b>for</b> them. And the captain was locked in his room for 24 hours. He didn't want to go out at all. In the morning, during breakfast, the co-pilot was talking about his son and daughter as if nobody else had a son or daughter." ...|$|E
500|$|Executive Producer Sara Colleton {{said it was}} {{difficult}} to kill off a long-standing character, but they felt [...] "this is where Dexter needed to be taken". She also felt the motives for Arthur killing Rita were deliberately made to be open to various interpretations, including that Arthur may have killed her [...] "in a bizarre way to trigger Dexter to deal with who he really is".s Season 5 Jump Ahead in Time? |work=TV Guide |date=December 14, 2009 |accessdate=December 20, 2009}} When asked whether Arthur told Rita about Dexter's secret life before killing her, Phillips said the answer had not been determined because the fifth season was not yet planned, but he added, [...] "I would think that he did not tell her". Michael C. Hall called the ending a [...] "really bold stroke" [...] that would reset the stage of the series just as the Dexter Morgan character began to feel he could live with an emotional connection to his wife and family. Hall also said of the ending, [...] "More than anything <b>I</b> <b>felt</b> <b>for</b> the audience. I think {{this is the kind of}} thing that's really going to tie people in knots." ...|$|E

500|$|Critical {{reaction}} {{towards the}} character was generally mixed. In a DVD {{review of the}} first series, Michael Mackenzie of Home Cinema thought Macfadyen {{was not a very}} good actor and believed [...] "he seems to be in some sort of contest with Keanu Reeves to see how long he can maintain the same lifeless facial expression," [...] but thought the character himself, particularly his personal life, mostly worked well for the most part as it continues [...] "as a standard soap opera." [...] In review of the second series, Dennis Landmann of MovieFreak praised the [...] "drama and intensity that builds around his character," [...] noting Tom's somewhat [...] "haunted soul" [...] and the last five minutes of the last episode [...] "were so powerful they affected how <b>I</b> <b>felt</b> <b>for</b> the next couple of days; I kept thinking about the character and the tragic events that happened to him." [...] In the third series, Mackenzie praised the episode where Tom tries to clear his name, but thought his exit was [...] "not particularly satisfying." [...] However, David Blackwell of Enterline Media thought that his farewell scene was [...] "one of [...] best moments of the first two episode (in addition to the way Tom acts in the opening episode)." ...|$|E
500|$|Sandra Gonzalez of Entertainment Weekly was {{generally}} positive {{on most of}} the songs featured in the episode. She gave the performance of [...] "Loser Like Me" [...] a [...] "B", and explained that [...] "This one took a little time to grow on me. I liked it better on the show than when I heard it by itself, which is weird because it's exactly the same thing. Goes to show how much of a difference a good performance [...] makes." [...] Gonzalez gave the highest grade to the cover versions of [...] "Misery" [...] and [...] "Raise Your Glass", both performed by the Dalton Academy Warblers. In her review for [...] "Misery", she praised the performance, and gave it an [...] "A". She opined, [...] "I'm a sucker for a Warbler-ized pop song, especially when it makes Blaine dance and make his weird, animated faces. They're simply adorable, and these Warblers are simply amazing." [...] Gonzalez gave the performance of [...] "Raise Your Glass" [...] an [...] "A". The lowest grade given by Gonzalez was a [...] "D" [...] for Santana's performance of [...] "Trouty Mouth". She explained [...] "If we're taking this song as a joke, it gets a 'B−' because Santana sounded great. But [...] I think about how bad <b>I</b> <b>felt</b> <b>for</b> Sam watching his utter mortification." [...] "Candles" [...] {{was generally}} well received by Gonzalez. She gave the performance a [...] "B" [...] and went on to write [...] "It’s really hard for this pair {{to live up to the}} awesomeness of 'Baby, It's Cold Outside'. I'm sure they could one day, but this one fell a bit short for me musically. [...] In the context of the show, however, it was a great moment." ...|$|E
2500|$|In July 1986, Bono and {{his wife}} Ali {{travelled}} to Nicaragua and El Salvador, where they saw firsthand the distress of peasants bullied by political conflicts and United States military intervention. The trip angered Bono and {{formed the basis of}} the song's lyrics. He said, [...] "I remember the ground shaking, and I remember the smell, I suppose, of being near a war zone. I don't think we were in danger, but I knew there were lives in danger or being lost close to us, and <b>I</b> <b>felt</b> <b>for</b> them. It upset me as a person who read the Scriptures, to think that Christians in America were supporting this kind of thing, this kind of proxy war because of these Communists." [...] In August, after reconvening with his bandmates in Dublin to resume work on The Joshua Tree, Bono instructed the Edge to [...] "put El Salvador through an amplifier", resulting in the song's feedback-based guitar part. The Edge said that his guitar playing was also informed by Bono's lyrics.|$|E

[...] <b>I</b> <b>felt</b> <b>for</b> it and found {{it was a bit of}} grass. I took it to look at. [...] There was a trail nearby and I followed it. [...] It led to water. [...] I went into the water. There the trail ended and I sat down in the water. [...] I was nearly out of breath. I started to rise out of the water, and when I came out I was born by my mother. When I was born I could know and see and understand for a time, but afterwards went back to it as a baby. [...] Then I grew up naturally. [...] At the age of seven I began to learn, and when twelve began to fight enemies. That was the reason I always refused to wear any war-dress. [...] Only a bit of grass in the hair. [...] That was why I always was successful in battles. The first fight was with the Shoshones. The Shoshones were chasing the Sioux. [...] I, with my younger brother riding double. [...] Two of the Shoshones came for us. [...] We started to meet them. [...] I killed one of them and took his horse. [...] We jumped on him, my brother and I double, and escaped." ...|$|E
2500|$|In June 2002, it was {{reported}} that Lucy Benjamin had quit her role of Lisa. She commented, [...] "I’ve had a wonderful five years and I’m terribly excited by the [...] storyline.” EastEnders executive producer Louise Berridge added, “This {{is going to be a}} very demanding story to play but I know Lucy will do a fabulous job. She’s an actress with a terrific future.” Despite initial claims that the actress had decided to leave, she later admitted that the producers had axed the character. Discussing Lisa's exit, Lucy Benjamin's boyfriend of the time, actor Steve McFadden who plays Phil Mitchell, said, [...] "Lucy didn’t feel comfortable with lying. There’s a stigma attached to being given the boot but she felt stupid pretending she’d decided to pack in a great job. It was hard for her and she was very upset but she’s come through it. <b>I</b> <b>felt</b> <b>for</b> her but soaps are led by storylines and Lucy was told that the writers had come up with a brilliant plot that was too good to say no to.I guess Lucy’s character was so central to the plot that eventually it blew up in her face. I’m proud of the fact that she was good enough to come to the forefront of the show. Lucy did so well to make her mark on EastEnders in the first place because Lisa arrived on the Square on her own. She wasn’t part of a family, which means she was more vulnerable to the chop. She was only on a three-month contract but she made it a success and ended up being part of the cast for four years. If you are part of a screen family on EastEnders you are practically bomb-proof, no matter what your ability is as an actor." ...|$|E
