He has a very pragmatic, creative attitude, recognising that factual error can still produce beneficial results.|$|E
500|$|Todd McCarthy of The Hollywood Reporter said Boyle's [...] "electric" [...] {{direction}} [...] "temperamentally complements Sorkin's highly theatrical three-act study" [...] {{and praised}} Fassbender in the role, who [...] "doesn't closely physically resemble the man, [...] he fully delivers {{the essentials of}} <b>how</b> <b>we</b> <b>have</b> come to perceive the man." [...] Justin Chang of Variety extolled the film as [...] "a wildly creative fantasia...a brilliant, maddening, ingeniously designed and monstrously self-aggrandizing movie." [...] Sasha Stone, writing for TheWrap, stated that Fassbender gives [...] "a stunning knockout" [...] performance as Jobs in a film that is [...] "a kind of talk opera", which to some {{might seem to be}} [...] "Sorkin overkill but {{the same could be said}} for the best of them: David Mamet, Edward Albee, Paddy Chayefsky and even William Shakespeare. Sorkin is not trying to do anything but write in his own style, thus this film and its exceptional dialogue leaves its mark as profoundly as Jobs himself left his." [...] Eric Kohn of IndieWire gave the film a [...] "B+", stating that [...] "the cast vanishes into their parts...buried under makeup and a distinctive Polish accent, Winslet's chameleonesque transformation is bested only by Fassbender, whose vivid expressions and constant movement turn him into a physical marvel." [...] He also noted that Boyle [...] "drops his usual whirlwind editing style and instead develops an engrossing chamber piece." ...|$|E
500|$|Tom Ewing of Pitchfork Media {{suggested}} that [...] "the hypertreatment of the voice, {{the way it}} edges into the music, suggests {{that the price of}} fame is identity erasure. We understand her through a filter, and that's <b>how</b> <b>we</b> <b>have</b> to hear her too. The multiple backing vox fragment identity further, turn the song more universal". Dave De Sylvia of Sputnikmusic also picked it as one of the album's highlights. Melissa Maerz of Rolling Stone named it the best track of the album along with [...] "Freakshow", deeming it as a [...] "tabloid-bashing banger". Jim Abbott of the Orlando Sentinel said that [...] "Musically, songs such as 'Piece of Me,' 'Radar' and 'Break the Ice' are one-dimensional, robotic exercises." [...] Stephen Thomas Erlewine of Allmusic commented that [...] "Bloodshy & Avant try desperately to craft a defiant anthem for this tabloid fixture, as she couldn't be bothered to write one on her own". Chris Wasser from the Irish Independent said the song [...] "drowns slowly under cloggy production and a lyrical theme that for all of its close connection with the trials and tribulations Spears has had to deal with, weren't even penned by the singer who could have very easily recorded her fairly unchallenging input on Blackout in less than a week." [...] The song was later included in Rolling Stones 100 Best Songs of 2007 at number fifteen.|$|E

That's <b>how</b> <b>we</b> <b>have</b> been successful. But some of the shot selection from our top six batsmen was not good enough today. The Indian bowlers bowled in the right areas, give them credit for that. But our batting performance was immature." ...|$|E
2500|$|Its {{emphasis}} {{is not on}} us (our sinfulness) but on God’s mercy and salvific action in Jesus Christ. [...] It could just as accurately be translated [...] "O Lord, you are merciful!" [...] Note that the sample tropes all mention what Christ has done for us, not <b>how</b> <b>we</b> <b>have</b> sinned. [...] For example, “you were sent to heal the contrite,” “you have shown us {{the way to the}} Father,” or “you come in word and sacrament to strengthen us in holiness,” leading to further acclamation of God’s praises in the Gloria.|$|E

2500|$|The Holocene began about 10,000 years ago. It is {{the current}} interglacial period, and it {{has proven to be}} a {{relatively}} stable environment of the Earth. There have been natural environmental fluctuations during the Holocene, but the key atmospheric and biogeochemical parameters have been relatively stable. This stability and resilience has allowed agriculture to develop and complex societies to thrive. According to Rockström et al., we [...] "have now become so dependent on those investments for our way of life, and <b>how</b> <b>we</b> <b>have</b> organized society, technologies, and economies around them, that we must take the range within which Earth System processes varied in the Holocene as a scientific reference point for a desirable planetary state." ...|$|E
2500|$|I learned quite a {{lot from}} him, I must say. I learned that {{you have got to}} work at it. You have to rehearse. When I came back and I got the band (Earth) back together, I made sure that {{everybody}} was up {{early in the morning and}} rehearsing. I used to go and pick them up. I was the only one at the time that could drive. I used to have to drive the bloody van and get them up at quarter to nine every morning; which was, believe me, early for us then. I said to them, [...] "This is <b>how</b> <b>we</b> <b>have</b> got to do it because this is how Jethro Tull did it." [...] They had a schedule and they knew that they were going to work from this time till that time. I tried that with our band and we got into doing it. It worked.

Arar, along with Sergeant Patrick Tower, was chosen a co-Nation Builder by The Globe and Mail for 2006. [...] In April 2007, Time magazine named Arar to the TIME 100, its annual listing of 100 influential people in the world. [...] Arar's entry, at No. 58 in the Heroes & Pioneers category, was written by US Senator Patrick Leahy and says his case [...] "stands as a sad example of <b>how</b> <b>we</b> <b>have</b> been too willing to sacrifice our core principles to overarching government power in the name of security, when doing so only undermines the principles we stand for and makes us less safe."

2500|$|Quine falls {{squarely}} {{into the}} analytic philosophy tradition while also being the main {{proponent of the}} view that philosophy is not conceptual analysis but the abstract branch of the empirical sciences. [...] His major writings include [...] "Two Dogmas of Empiricism" [...] (1951), which attacked the distinction between analytic and synthetic propositions and advocated a form of semantic holism, and Word and Object (1960), which further developed these positions and introduced Quine's famous indeterminacy of translation thesis, advocating a behaviorist theory of meaning. He also developed an influential naturalized epistemology that tried to provide [...] "an improved scientific explanation of <b>how</b> <b>we</b> <b>have</b> developed elaborate scientific theories {{on the basis of}} meager sensory input." [...] He is also important in philosophy of science for his [...] "systematic attempt to understand science from within the resources of science itself" [...] and for his conception of philosophy as continuous with science. This led to his famous quip that [...] "philosophy of science is philosophy enough." [...] In philosophy of mathematics, he and his Harvard colleague Hilary Putnam developed the [...] "Quine–Putnam indispensability thesis," [...] an argument for the reality of mathematical entities.|$|E
2500|$|... "Resonance" [...] is {{a central}} {{operative}} principle of the cosmos as conceived by the Huainanzi. The phrase itself means [...] "stimulus" [...] (gan 感) and [...] "response" [...] (ying 應), which is <b>how</b> <b>we</b> <b>have</b> translated it when the Huainanzi refers specifically to the discrete component processes that the term denotes. Fundamentally, [...] "resonance" [...] {{is a process of}} dynamic interaction that transcends the limits of time, space, and ordinary linear causality. Through the mechanism of resonance, an event in one location (the [...] "stimulus") produces simultaneous effects in another location (the [...] "response"), even though the two phenomena have no direct spatial or mechanical contact. They may indeed be separated by vast gulfs of space. For example, connections between celestial events (eclipses, planetary motions) and events in the human community were understood as examples of [...] "resonance." [...] For the authors of the Huainanzi, such connections were not coincidence or mere correspondence but dynamic influences exchanged through the energetic medium of qi. All phenomena are both composed of and impelled by qi, and since all currently differentiated qi emerged from an originally undifferentiated Grand One, all qi remains mutually resonantly linked. The pathways of resonance are not random, however. Objects are most sensitive to resonant influences emanating from other objects that share the same constituent form of qi.

I remember one of the men, a cowboy from Oklahoma, couldn't write, and he got so upset over this that every time somebody asked him for his autograph he would run away, saying he had forgotten {{to do something that}} he had been ordered to do. When I and some chums went down to New York to look around, all the folks stared at us, and many insisted on shaking hands and treating." ...|$|R
