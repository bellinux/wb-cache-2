500|$|Dylan's contemporaries in 1965 {{were both}} startled and {{challenged}} by the single. Paul McCartney remembered going around to John Lennon's house in Weybridge to hear the song. According to McCartney, [...] "It seemed {{to go on and}} on forever. It was just beautiful... He showed all of us {{that it was possible to}} go a little further." [...] Frank Zappa had a more extreme reaction: [...] "When I heard 'Like a Rolling Stone', I wanted to quit the music business, because I felt: 'If this wins and it does what it's supposed to do, I don't need to do anything else...' But it didn't do anything. It sold but nobody responded to <b>it</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>way</b> that they should have."

Reviewer David Browne of Entertainment Weekly considered that [...] " [...] songs pack the riffy wallop of unpolished Nirvana demos, {{and his voice}} has Kurt Cobain's lunging, over-the-top passion." [...] Writing for Spin, Terri Sutton stylistically compared the album to Nirvana's second album, Nevermind, saying that [...] "the album's first half [...] owes much to Nevermind, and it's tempting to hear <b>it</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>way</b> Nevermind taught us to hear." [...] Paul Rees of Kerrang! admitted that [...] "Foo Fighters cannot fail to evoke Kurt Cobain's memory, whether if through Grohl's ragged howl of a voice or the way a number of its songs go soft-soft-loud", but ultimately considered the record [...] "more than strong enough to stand or fall in its own merits". [...] Billboard complimented the [...] "inspired songwriting and passionate performances", adding the album could please grunge fans and [...] "also remind fans of other rock and punk taste makers, from Green Day and The Offspring to Better than Ezra." ...|$|E

2500|$|The philosopher John Stuart Mill liked Wordsworth's ode {{and found}} it {{influential}} {{to the formation of}} his own thoughts. In his Autobiography (1873), he credited Wordsworth's poetry as being able to relieve his mind and overcome a sense of apathy towards life. Of the poems, he particularly emphasised both Wordsworth's 1815 collection of poetry and the Ode: Intimations of Immortality as providing the most help to him, and he specifically said of the ode: [...] "I found that he too had had similar experience to mine; that he also had felt that the first freshness of youthful enjoyment of life was not lasting; but that he had sought for compensation, and found <b>it,</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>way</b> in which he was now teaching me to find it. The result was that I gradually, but completely, emerged from my habitual depression, and was never again subject to it." [...] David Mason followed Mill in an 1875 essay on literature, including Wordsworth's poetry. After quoting from the ode, Mason claimed of the poem: [...] "These, and hundreds of other passages that might be quoted, show that Wordsworth possessed, in a very high degree indeed, the true primary quality of the poet—imagination; a surcharge of personality or vital spirit, perpetually overflowing among the objects of the otherwise conditioned universe, and refashioning them according to its pleasure." ...|$|E
2500|$|Cruyff's footballing {{principles}} {{have significantly}} influenced the football career of many players and managers, including Frank Rijkaard and Pep Guardiola, two devoted disciples and successors of the Cruyffian (Barça-Ajax) school of football. Without Cruyff operating {{behind the scenes}} as the spiritual father of Barça, {{there could be no}} Joan Laporta presidency, and Rijkaard and Guardiola, two largely unproven managers, could never have been appointed. Guardiola, a typical product (graduate) of Cruyffian school, who was the manager of Barcelona between 2008 and 2012, stated: [...] "Throughout my career I've simply tried to instil what I learned from Johan Cruyff. He has had the biggest influence on football out of anyone in the world, first as a player and then as a coach. He taught me a lot {{and you can see that}} in the fact that so many of his former players are now coaches". Guardiola added, [...] "Johan Cruyff built the cathedral, our job is to maintain and renovate it." [...] In regards to how the football world will remember Cruyff's posthumous legacy, he said, [...] "As a player and as a manager he won a lot of titles, but that's not his legacy. The titles only help. Johan has changed two clubs. Not only did he change Ajax, but also Barcelona – and then the Dutch and Spanish national teams, too. Forget the titles. I've won more titles than him. Messi, for example, is someone runs less and in that he's the best of Cruyff's alumni. (...) I would not have been capable of doing what he did at Barcelona. He changed everything. He did it all. What Cruyff's done for football cannot be compared. The statue thing is superficial. He has made us love this sport so openly that there's no way we can forget him." [...] Jürgen Klinsmann, the head coach of the United States national team, said about Cruyff's overall impact on contemporary football, [...] "More than an athlete, Cruyff was also a great thinker, someone who reinvented the sport... Cruyff has left us now, but his vision and philosophy will hopefully live forever. You can see <b>it</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>way</b> Barcelona—one of two clubs Cruyff revolutionized, along with Ajax—still plays every week. It's a style that has admirers around the world. I think a lot of people share that [...] with him. You want to see this type of game, where you set the tone, you control the game, you make it fast, you make it attractive and attacking. He's always been famous for his version of the 4–3–3 with the wide wingers, all technically highly gifted and fast. This is his mark." ...|$|E
