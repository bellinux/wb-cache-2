In {{addition}} to her comments, Syed was credited to closing a deal with punters off the street that he managed to <b>draw</b> <b>into</b> the office.|$|E
25|$|By January 1945, Jagdgeschwader 7 (JG 7) {{had been}} {{formed as a}} pure jet fighter wing, {{although}} it was several weeks before it was operational. In the meantime, a bomber unit—I Gruppe, Kampfgeschwader 54 (KG 54)—had re-equipped with the Me 262 A-2a fighter-bomber {{for use in a}} ground-attack role. However, the unit lost 12 jets in action in two weeks for minimal returns. Jagdverband 44 (JV 44) was another Me 262 fighter unit, of squadron (staffel) size given the low numbers of available personnel, formed in February 1945 by Lieutenant General Adolf Galland, who had recently been dismissed as Inspector of Fighters. Galland was able to <b>draw</b> <b>into</b> the unit many of the most experienced and decorated Luftwaffe fighter pilots from other units grounded by lack of fuel.|$|E
500|$|The {{last thing}} Tallard {{expected}} that morning {{was to be}} attacked by the Allies – deceived by intelligence gathered from prisoners taken by de Silly the previous day, and assured in their strong natural position, Tallard and his colleagues were convinced that Marlborough and Eugene were about to retreat north-eastwards towards Nördlingen. Tallard wrote a report to this effect to King Louis that morning, but hardly had he sent the messenger when the Allied army began to appear opposite his camp. [...] "I could see the enemy advancing ever closer in nine great columns", wrote Mérode-Westerloo, [...] " ... filling the whole plain from the Danube to the woods on the horizon." [...] Signal guns were fired {{to bring in the}} foraging parties and picquets as the French and Bavarian troops tried to <b>draw</b> <b>into</b> battle-order to face the unexpected threat.|$|E
50|$|Teams {{from the}} same {{confederation}} were not <b>drawn</b> <b>into</b> the same group, therefore Egypt was <b>drawn</b> <b>into</b> Group B. Also as result, Italy and Spain were <b>drawn</b> <b>into</b> different groups.|$|R

2500|$|Unlike most positions, {{king and}} pawn endgames {{can usually be}} {{analyzed}} to a definite conclusion, given enough skill and time. [...] An error in a king and pawn endgame almost always turns a win into a draw or a <b>draw</b> <b>into</b> a loss – there is little chance for recovery. [...] Accuracy is most important in these endgames. [...] There are three fundamental ideas in these endgames: opposition, triangulation, and the Réti manoeuvre [...]|$|E
2500|$|Although the Peloponnesian fleet was numerically {{superior}} to the Athenian, many of its ships were rigged out as transports instead of fighting vessels. [...] Thus, as the Athenian fleet approached them, the Peloponnesian commanders (the names {{of all of these}} are not known, but the Corinthian commanders were Machaon, Isocrates, and Agatharchidas) ordered their 47 triremes to <b>draw</b> <b>into</b> a circle, prows outward, for defense. [...] In the center of the circle were gathered the smaller ships and the five fastest triremes, which were to plug any gap that opened in the circle.|$|E
2500|$|Thomas Sternhold {{published}} his first, short collection of nineteen Certayn Psalmes between mid-1547 and early 1549. In December 1549, his posthumous Al such psalmes of Dauid as Thomas Sternehold ... didde {{in his life}} time <b>draw</b> <b>into</b> English Metre was printed, containing thirty-seven psalms by Sternhold and, in a separate section at the end, seven psalms by John Hopkins. This collection {{was taken to the}} Continent with Protestant exiles during the reign of Mary Tudor, and editors in Geneva both revised the original texts and gradually added more over several editions. In 1562, the publisher John Day brought together most of the psalm versions from the Genevan editions and many new psalms by John Hopkins, Thomas Norton, and John Markant to make up The Whole Booke of Psalmes, Collected into English Meter. In addition to metrical versions of all 150 psalms, the volume included versified versions of the Apostles' Creed, the Magnificat, and other biblical passages or Christian texts, as well as several non-scriptural versified prayers and a long section of prose prayers largely drawn from the English Forme of Prayers used in Geneva.|$|E

2500|$|Channelers can {{direct the}} Power toward a desired purpose by {{creating}} {{one or more}} [...] "flows" [...] of the One Power and constructing [...] "weaves" [...] of these flows. An individual flow can only consist {{of one of the}} Five Powers, but a weave can combine any number of flows from any of the five. Flows can be of varying sizes, with larger flows involving greater strength. Channelers, especially novices, are very careful to control the amount of the One Power they <b>draw</b> <b>into</b> their flows. Drawing too much can be fatal, or can [...] "burn out" [...] the channeler, severing their ability to access the One Power forever. Channelers can sense the power in others and feel when a channeler has [...] "embraced" [...] saidar or [...] "seized" [...] saidin, for female channelers, this is limited only to other women, whereas male channelers are able to 'feel' when a female channeler has embraced saidar, this is generally felt by a tingling sensation. It is also possible, for women, to sense the strength of a fellow channeler—defined as the potential amount of the One Power the channeler can draw and successfully weave unaided without burning out. Men are limited to sensing the amount of saidin currently drawn, but cannot tell if it's the channeler's maximum potential.|$|E
