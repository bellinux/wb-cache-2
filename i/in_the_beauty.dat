Pavarotti {{was not at the}} concert to sing his part and so an antique gramophone was brought onto the stage in his place. Eno came on stage to sing backing vocals, and Bono invited Nogić on stage during the chorus. During the song, the video screen showed images from Carter's Miss Sarajevo documentary, including footage of the girls taking part <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>beauty</b> contest and the banner reading [...] "Please don't let them kill us".

500|$|Lancashire {{states that}} she was never driven by the ideas of fame and status. Her {{background}} had inspired an initial interest in working behind the scenes in television. She did not give serious thought to the performing arts {{until the age of}} 18. After winning a place at the Guildhall School of Music and Drama— where her contemporaries included Shirley Henderson, Maggie O'Neill and Niamh Cusack— Lancashire realised that she enjoyed acting. She graduated in 1986, describing her time as a student there as [...] "tremendous" [...] but [...] "seriously hard work and quite intimidating". After rejection from several repertory theatre companies, Lancashire was given her first acting role by Howard Lloyd-Lewis, artistic director of the Manchester Library Theatre Company, which provided her with an Equity Card. Lancashire performed two plays with the company, Pacific Overtures and The Beauty Game, which she states formed [...] "the start of my career as an actor". She found her first professional acting experience [...] "terrifying" [...] {{as a result of the}} live audiences, recalling that, [...] "because I wore a bathing costume in some of the scenes, I got heckled!" [...] She also realised that taking risks or underperforming could have had consequences for her acting career. Her role as Denise <b>in</b> <b>The</b> <b>Beauty</b> Game earned her a nomination for Best Supporting Actress at the Manchester Evening News Theatre Awards.|$|E

2500|$|Galvanic {{treatment}} <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>beauty</b> {{industry has}} been described {{since at least the}} 1970s and earlier.

This is achieved by the application of a small, constant, direct current.
