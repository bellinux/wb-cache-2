40|$|A {{few years}} since {{the worst of the}} Euro {{sovereign}} debt crisis, many nations, from Cyprus to Ireland, including South Africa are re-visiting their public debt management to avert or lessen the impact of similar such happenings in the future. There are a number of studies on risk assessments of fiscal sustainability; however, few focus on contingent liabilities and even fewer on <b>financial</b> <b>guarantees.</b> In South Africa, <b>financial</b> <b>guarantees</b> have consistently comprised just above or below 50 % of all contingent liabilities {{since the early days of}} majoritarian rule. In lieu of this, the paper analyses the risks posed by <b>financial</b> <b>guarantees</b> to fiscal sustainability in South Africa. We estimate the effect of <b>financial</b> <b>guarantees</b> on public debt in South Africa via the Engle Granger and causality model with quarterly time series data obtained from the South African Reserve Bank (SARB) as well as the National Treasury. The data covers the April 1997 to December 2011 period. All econometric methods were executed using the statistical software package E-Views 7. We found that no long run relationship exists between national net loan debt and <b>financial</b> <b>guarantees</b> in South Africa. The pass rate of <b>financial</b> <b>guarantees</b> significantly affects its present value. The pass rate of <b>financial</b> <b>guarantees</b> has a predicting ability in determining the present value of national net loan debt. These findings may be contrary to what would be expected in the case of South Africa considering that the country is managing the issuance of <b>financial</b> <b>guarantees</b> prudently and that at present levels, there is no need for a radical policy shift. The study therefore offers a lesson to similar merging economies on the good governance of contingent liabilities...|$|R

40|$|Across {{all types}} of higher {{education}} in the United States, tenure has been historically linked to the concepts of academic freedom and economic security. In medical schools, however, the link between tenure and a <b>financial</b> <b>guarantee</b> has changed appreciably over the past decade into something much more tenuous. In the current economic environment where medical schools operate with limited and, arguably, unstable bases of “hard” funding, the liability of a <b>financial</b> <b>guarantee</b> to tenured faculty presents schools with a fiscal risk they often must manage. Accordingly, schools continue to revise their policies and increasingly provide no <b>financial</b> <b>guarantee</b> at all, or when they do, it is on a much more limited basis.

40|$|In {{this paper}} we model the claim process of <b>financial</b> <b>guarantee</b> insurance, and predict the pure premium and the {{required}} amount of risk capital. The data used {{are from the}} <b>financial</b> <b>guarantee</b> system of the Finnish statutory pension scheme. The losses in <b>financial</b> <b>guarantee</b> insurance may be devastating during an economic depression (i. e.,Â deep recession). This indicates that the economic business cycle, and in particular depressions, {{must be taken into}} account in modelling the claim amounts in <b>financial</b> <b>guarantee</b> insurance. A Markov regime-switching model is used to predict the frequency and severity of future depression periods. The claim amounts are predicted using a transfer function model where the predicted growth rate of the real GNP is an explanatory variable. The pure premium and initial risk reserve are evaluated on the basis of the predictive distribution of claim amounts. Bayesian methods are applied throughout the modelling process. For example, estimation is based on posterior simulation with the Gibbs sampler, and model adequacy is assessed by posterior predictive checking. Simulation results show that the required amount of risk capital is high, even though depressions are an infrequent phenomenon.

40|$|In modern {{conditions}} of the Russian economy is particularly important for the sustainable functioning of the entire domestic tourism industry and the individual tourist enterprises. The need to improve strategic management of the enterprise is confirmed {{by a series of}} bankruptcies of travel companies of Russia: "Neva", "Ideal tour", "Expotour", "Wind Rose. World", "Labyrint" and others. By March 2015, according to the Association of tour operators of Russia (ATOR), the number of tour operators in outbound tourism in The Unified State Register decreased for 30 % in comparison with March 2014. For tour operators specializing in outbound tourism, the annual turnover of which does not exceed 250 million rubles, the amount of <b>financial</b> <b>guarantees</b> is 30 million rubles.

40|$|Equity-indexed annuity (EIA) {{insurance}} products {{have become increasingly}} sought after since their introduction in 1995. Some {{of the most important}} characteristics of these products are that they allow the policyholders to benefit from the equity market's potential growth and ensure that the principals can grow with a minimum guaranteed interest rate. In this thesis, we show how to derive the closed-form pricing formula of a point-to-point <b>financial</b> <b>guarantee,</b> using the Black-Scholes framework. Moreover, under the complete-market assumption, we construct a replicating portfolio that can hedge a point-to-point <b>financial</b> <b>guarantee.</b> However, in real financial markets, some of the assumptions required by a complete-market cannot be respected, particularly the continuous-time trading assumption. The replicating portfolio generates hedging errors because companies can only trade discretely. We will show the distribution of the present values of hedging errors for the <b>financial</b> <b>guarantee.</b> We also introduce the Lee-Carter stochastic mortality model. After presenting how to price a point-to-point equity-indexed annuity with fixed mortality rates, we then take the stochastic mortality rates into consideration to re-evaluate the point-to-point. In both cases, the pricing work for the point-to-point product is done under the assumption of independence between the equity market and the policyholder's time of death. Furthermore, the replicating portfolio of a point-to-point equity-indexed annuity can be derived based on the replicating portfolio of a point-to-point <b>financial</b> <b>guarantee</b> with the corresponding mortality rates. The distributions of the present values of hedging errors under both fixed and stochastic mortality rates will be presented. Indeed, the replicating portfolio can help companies reduce the risks of issuing EIA products, since it can hedge the EIA very well.

40|$|This work {{develops}} a simple framework to analyse how financial intermediaries' balance sheet problems combined with <b>financial</b> <b>guarantees</b> make an economy {{more vulnerable to}} financial crises. A 'double default' problem - that is, the default of financial intermediaries on their debt repayments and of the government on its guarantees to bailout intermediaries' losses - is modelled in this study. The possibility of multiple equilibria, including a crisis equilibrium where {{the government is not}} able or willing to honor its guarantees towards the domestic financial sector, arises from the interplay of all the above elements: financial intermediaries' level of indebtedness, government implicit guarantees and high-risk creditors' lending. This work also produces predictions concerning the vulnerability to a financial crisis: multiple equilibria are possible only in certain ranges of the fundamentals. <b>Financial</b> <b>guarantees,</b> risk premium, multiple equilibria,...|$|R
