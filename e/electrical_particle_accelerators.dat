40|$|This paper {{discusses}} {{the subject of}} power quality for power converters. The first part gives an overview {{of most of the}} common disturbances and power quality issues in <b>electrical</b> networks for <b>particle</b> <b>accelerators,</b> and explains their consequences for accelerator operation. The propagation of asymmetrical network disturbances into a network is analysed. Quantitative parameters for network disturbances in a typical network are presented, and immunity levels for users' electrical equipment are proposed. The second part of this paper {{discusses the}} technologies and strategies used in <b>particle</b> <b>accelerator</b> networks for power quality improvement. Particular focus is given to networks supplying loads with cycling active and reactive power.

40|$|Phenomena {{occurring}} {{in a particular}} class of nonlinear oscillatory systems-zero-dispersion systems-are reviewed for cases with and without damping while the system is driven either by random fluctuations (noise) or by a periodic force, or by both together. Zero-dispersion (ZD) systems are those whose frequency of oscillation omega possesses an extremum {{as a function of}} energy E. Oscillations at energies close to the extremal' energy E(m), where the "frequency dispersion" domega/dE is equal to zero, correlate with each other for very long times, to some extent like in a harmonic oscillator. But unlike the latter, the correlation time decreases as the energy shifts away from E(m). It is the combination of this local harmonicity, with the fact that a perturbation can cause transitions between strongly and weakly correlated behaviour, that gives rise to the rich manifold of interesting ZD phenomena that are reviewed. A diverse range of physical systems may be expected to exhibit ZD behaviour under particular circumstances. Examples considered in detail include superconducting quantum interference devices, the 2 D electron gas in a magnetic superlattice, axial molecules, <b>electrical</b> circuits, <b>particle</b> <b>accelerators,</b> impurities in lattices, relativistic oscillators, and the Harper oscillator. The ZD effects to be anticipated in quantum systems are also discussed. Each section ends with a suggested outlook for future research. (C) 2002 Published by Elsevier Science B. V...|$|R

40|$|Reliability {{has been}} {{identified}} as a key factor limiting the development of certain <b>particle</b> <b>accelerator</b> applications, for example Accelerator-Driven Systems (ADS) for energy production and waste-transmutation. Previous studies of <b>particle</b> <b>accelerator</b> reliability have been undertaken using conventional techniques, such as Reliability Block Diagrams (RBD), Fault Tree Analysis (FTA), etc. Although limited data surrounding components and their failure modes limits the applicability of conventional techniques for analysing the reliability of <b>particle</b> <b>accelerators.</b> In addition industrial applications of <b>particle</b> <b>accelerators,</b> i. e. energy production, require a real time response to failure. In this paper we exam- ine a holistic approach to accelerator reliability modelling using Electric Network Frequency (ENF) criterion to look for emergent behaviour of the <b>particle</b> <b>accelerator,</b> from com- plex datasets, such as beam current/charge, created by the diagnostics systems during the machines operation.
