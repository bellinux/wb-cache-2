40|$|Abstract. In RDF, a blank node (or {{anonymous}} resource or bnode) is a node in an RDF graph {{which is}} not identified by a URI {{and is not a}} literal. Several RDF/S Knowledge Bases (KBs) rely heavily on blank nodes as they are convenient for representing complex attributes or resources whose identity is unknown but their attributes (either literals or associations with other resources) are known. In this paper we show how we can exploit blank nodes anonymity {{in order to reduce the}} delta (diff) size when comparing such KBs. The main idea of the proposed method is to build a mapping between the bnodes of the compared KBs for reducing the delta size. We prove that finding the optimal mapping is NP-Hard in the general case, and polynomial in case there are not directly connected bnodes. Subsequently we present various polynomial algorithms returning approximate solutions for the general case. For making the application of our method feasible also to large KBs we present a signature-based mapping algorithm with n log n complexity. Finally, we report experimental results over real and synthetic datasets that demonstrate significant reductions in the sizes of the computed deltas. For the proposed algorithms we also provide comparative results regarding <b>delta</b> <b>reduction,</b> equivalence detection and time efficiency. ...|$|E

The spatial scale of river mouth is from ten to hundred kilometers and strongly depends on the river's capacity of sediment supply.

First longshore sediment transport rate is investigated by finding the representative wave condition for long-term beach changes. Secondly the erosion control measures are proposed by considering longshore sediment budget and beach stabilization. By considering total balance of longshore sediment transport, dynamically stable pocket beaches are calculated using the equation of equilibrium bay.

Campbell dam, which impounds nearly all river-borne sediment entering the reservoir (Tobin Lake) and modifies natural discharge fluctuations such that normally high spring and summer flows are significantly diminished. [...] Removal of sediment outflow by impoundment has caused enlargement of channels downstream of the dam and reduction of sediment-borne nutrients to the delta ecosystem. In addition, suppression of annual discharge peaks has reduced the frequency of overbank flooding and, consequently, the frequency at which water and nutrients are replenished in the <b>delta</b> wetlands. <b>Reduction</b> of peak flows to the delta is exacerbated by the Gardiner dam on the South Saskatchewan River whose impoundment, Lake Diefenbaker, is nearly five {{times larger than the}} Tobin Lake reservoir, with a commensurately larger influence on flow patterns in the SRD.

40|$|We {{evaluated}} {{the impact of}} landscape changes {{on the amount of}} delta outflow reaching San Francisco Bay. The natural landscape was reconstructed and water balances were used to estimate the long-term annual average delta outflow that would have occurred under natural landscape conditions if the climate from 1922 to 2009 were to repeat itself. These outflows are referred to as natural delta outflows and are the first published estimate of natural delta outflow. These natural delta outflows were then compared with current delta outflows for the same climate and existing landscape, including its re-engineered system of reservoirs, canals, aqueducts, and pumping plants. This analysis shows that the long-term, annual average delta outflow under current conditions is consistent with outflow under natural landscape conditions. The amount of water currently used by farms, cities, and others is about equal to the amount of water formerly used by native vegetation. Development of water resources in California’s Central Valley transferred water formerly used by native vegetation to new beneficial uses without substantially reducing the longterm annual average supply to the San Francisco Bay–Delta estuary.

40|$|Brain's {{waves are}} {{produced}} by spontaneous activity of neurons. These waves are changed by neurotransmitters in {{the central nervous system}} (CNS). Concentration of these neurotransmitters can be changed by various drugs and total power of brain waves also increase or decrease by these drugs. In this research effect of Quinpirol and Sulpiride on the brain waves was investigated. Male wistar rats (weight 190 - 230) were aneasthetized with thiopental and two holes were made into the frontal and occipital area and two Ag/AgCl electrodes were fixed into these holes. One week after recovery, two electrodes were connected to the physiograph and the results were analyzed before and after intraperitoneal and intracerebroventricular (ICV) injection of drugs by PC computer. Our results showed that intraperitoneal administration (5 mg/kg) of diazepam reduced the depth of anesthesia. Conversely, intracerebroventricular injection of sulpiride increased the depth of anesthesia which was manifested by an increase in relative power of <b>delta</b> waves and <b>reduction</b> of relative power of alpha waves. This drug had a biphasic effect on EEG, at high doses in increased the depth of aneasthesia and total sleep. Wehteas depth of anesthesia was decreased at low dose. Simutanuos administration of sulpiride and quinpirole produced an effect on EEG similar to diazepam. As a result, biphasic effect of D 2 agonist and antagonist drugs on brain waves are due to nonspecific action of these drugs on these receptors and this effect may be produced by other mechanism...|$|R
40|$|Cardiac {{resynchronization}} therapy (CRT) {{was shown}} to reverse left ventricular (LV) remodelling in heart failure (HF) patients. We aimed to investigate whether intraoperative electrical parameters (IEP) were predictive factors of LV reverse remodelling and were correlated with mechanical dyssynchrony indexes. Eighty-six patients with HF underwent CRT. At implant, several electrical and echocardiographic parameters were evaluated and, at 6 months, responders were defined by a relative increase in LV ejection fraction >= 25 % compared with baseline. Several IEPs were shown to predict LV reverse remodelling. Receiver operating curve analysis revealed the ratio between QRS duration during biventricular pacing (BVp) and right ventricular pacing (RVp) [QRS(BVp) /QRS(RVp) ] as {{the best predictor of}} LV functional recovery after CRT (AUC = 0. 72; 95 % confidence limit 0. 57 - 0. 82; P < 0. 001). Responders showed a lower value of QRS(BVp) /QRS(RVp) when compared with non-responders (0. 74 +/- 0. 05 vs. 0. 8 +/- 0. 1; P < 0. 005) and 0. 78 was the value associated with the best predictive accuracy. The interval between the onset of RV lead and LV lead electrograms (RVegm-LVegm) during baseline rhythm correlated directly with the interventricular mechanical delay (IVMD) (r = 0. 68; P < 0. 0001) and with its <b>reduction</b> (<b>delta</b> IVMD) at follow-up (r = 0. 66; P < 0. 0005). Intraoperative electrical parameters can predict LV functional recovery after CRT and they are correlated with interventricular mechanical resynchronization at follow-up...|$|R
40|$|Aim To {{measure the}} root canal {{area and the}} {{reduction}} of the mesial and buccal/lingual wall thickness {{at the level of the}} coronal interference in mesial roots of mandibular molars after instrumentation with a crown-down or a simultaneous root canal preparation technique. Methodology Twenty mesial roots of first mandibular molars with a moderate root canal curvature were embedded in resin and sectioned horizontally at the level of the coronal interference, using a modification of the Bramante technique. After scanning and processing, the sections were reassembled. One root canal of each root was prepared using ProTaper instruments, while Mtwo instruments were used in the other root canal of the same mesial root. After scanning and processing, the data obtained were analysed for two parameters: changes in root canal area after instrumentation (<b>Delta</b> A) and <b>reduction</b> of the mesial and buccal/lingual wall thickness (Delta T). The data were subjected to Student's t-tests for statistical analysis at a significance level of P < 0. 05. Results No statistically significant differences were found between the two groups with respect to the changes in the areas (Delta A) at the level considered (P = 0. 410). No statistically significant differences were noticed between the two groups for dentine thickness (Delta T) of both the mesial wall (P = 0. 077) and the buccal or lingual wall (P = 0. 171). Conclusions There was no difference between the ProTaper and Mtwo groups for the amount of dentine removed...|$|R
40|$|Fractional pixel motion {{compensation}} in high-efficiency video coding (HEVC) uses an 8 -point filter and a 7 -point filter, {{which are based}} on the discrete cosine transform (DCT), for the 1 / 2 -pixel and 1 / 4 -pixel interpolations, respectively. In this paper, discrete sine transform (DST) -based interpolation filters (DST-IFs) are proposed for fractional pixel {{motion compensation}} in terms of coding efficiency improvement. Firstly, a performance of the DST-based interpolation filters (DST-IFs) using 8 -point and 7 -point filters for the 1 / 2 -pixel and 1 / 4 -pixel interpolations is compared with that of the DCT-based IFs (DCT-IFs) using 8 -point and 7 -point filters for the 1 / 2 -pixel and 1 / 4 -pixel interpolations, respectively, for fractional pixel motion compensation. Finally, the DST-IFs using 12 -point and 11 -point filters for the 1 / 2 -pixel and 1 / 4 -pixel interpolations, respectively, are proposed only for bi-directional motion compensation in terms of the coding efficiency. The 8 -point and 7 -point DST-IF methods showed average Bjøntegaard <b>Delta</b> (BD) -rate <b>reductions</b> of 0. 7 % and 0. 3 % in the random access (RA) and low delay B (LDB) configurations, respectively, in HEVC. The 12 -point and 11 -point DST-IF methods showed average BD-rate reductions of 1. 4 % and 1. 2 % in the RA and LDB configurations for the Luma component, respectively, in HEVC...|$|R
40|$|The {{localization}} of sulfate reducing {{sites in}} forested catchments is of major importance, because dissimilatory sulfate reduction {{can be a}} considerable sink for deposited sulfate. To localize dissimilatory sulfate reduction sites in a forested catchment (northeastern Bavaria, Germany), three sites within the catchment (upland site, intermittent seep, fen) were investigated for delta S- 34 depth profiles of soil sulfur and potential sulfate reduction rates were measured with S- 35 radiolabeling. Stable sulfur isotopes indicate that aerobic metabolism is the dominant process on the upland site and the intermittent seep (delta S- 34 Of soil sulfur between + 1. 6 and + 9. 0 parts per thousand) and dissimilatory reduction is not a significant sink for sulfate. However, results of the S- 35 radiolabeling indicated for the upland site that the soil has potentially high sulfate reduction rates under laboratory conditions. Soil sulfur of the fen was markedly depleted in S- 34 (delta S- 34 between - 6 and + 2. 6 parts per thousand). Both, S- 34 and S- 35 data indicated that dissimilatory sulfate reduction is an ongoing process on this site. The S- 34 and S- 35 approaches are complementary. While measurements using S- 35 can show momentary potential for dissimilatory bacterial sulfate <b>reduction,</b> <b>delta</b> S- 34 data reflect long-term predominance of either assimilatory or dissimilatory S metabolism at a particular site.
