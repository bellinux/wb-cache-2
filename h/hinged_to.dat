5|$|Most {{art historians}} {{believe that there}} are a number of {{indicators}} that the panel was the left-hand wing of a dismantled diptych. The frame contains clasps, implying it was once <b>hinged</b> <b>to</b> a second panel. The work seems composed to be symmetrically balanced towards an accompanying right-hand wing: Mary is positioned slightly to the right of centre, while her downward, almost coy glance is directed at a space beyond the edge of the panel, suggesting that she is looking at, or in the direction of, a kneeling donor in a right-hand wing. The visible architectural features – with the exception of the niches, the crucifixion and the windows directly behind it, which are at a right angle to the nave and centre front, facing the viewer – are at the left of the panel, facing right.|$|E
5|$|The first {{axillary}} sclerite (lAx) is {{the anterior}} hinge plate {{of the wing}} base. Its anterior part is supported on the anterior notal wing process of the tergum (ANP); its posterior part articulates with the tergal margin. The anterior end of the sclerite is generally produced as a slender arm, the apex of which (e) is always associated with {{the base of the}} subcostal vein (Sc), though it is not united with the latter. The body of the sclerite articulates laterally with the second axillary. The second axillary sclerite (2Ax) is more variable in form than the first axillary, but its mechanical relations are no less definite. It is obliquely <b>hinged</b> <b>to</b> the outer margin of the body of the first axillary, and the radial vein (R) is always flexibly attached to its anterior end (d). The second axillary presents both a dorsal and a ventral sclerotization in the wing base; its ventral surface rests upon the fulcral wing process of the pleuron. The second axillary, therefore, is the pivotal sclerite of the wing base, and it specifically manipulates the radial vein.|$|E

25|$|Control was {{affected}} by wheels {{either side of the}} pilots seat for roll and pitch and a rudder bar for yaw. The pilot operated a triangular elevator <b>hinged</b> <b>to</b> the tailing edge of the large tailplane, rhomboidal ailerons hinged from the traiiling edges of the wing-tips and two triangular rudders above and below the tailplane.|$|E
25|$|The XT-37 had a low, {{straight}} wing, {{with the}} engines {{buried in the}} wing roots, a clamshell-type canopy <b>hinged</b> <b>to</b> open vertically to the rear, a control layout {{similar to that of}} contemporary operational USAF aircraft, ejection seats, and tricycle landing gear with a wide track of 14ft (4.3m). It first flew on 12 October 1954.|$|E
25|$|Little {{detail about}} the {{stabilization}} system is recorded. It is known that the horizontal tail surfaces were <b>hinged</b> <b>to</b> allow the dihedral to change and that such motions were coupled to lift-changing flaps. Together, these stabilized pitch. The wing tips could rotate to control roll. The system was pneumatically powered and could be turned on and off in flight to test its efficiency.|$|E

25|$|The {{landing gear}} of the 28VD had {{retractable}} mainwheels, mounted on shock absorbing forward-raked, parallel legs from the wing. These were <b>hinged</b> <b>to</b> the lower fuselage on opened U-shaped frames. Retraction was vacuum-powered; {{to raise the}} wheels {{the tops of the}} legs were translated outward, swinging frames and wheels upwards. The tailskid was fixed to a small ventral extension of the fuselage under the fin.|$|E
25|$|A {{biscuit cutter}} {{a tool to}} cut out a biscuit from bread dough in a {{particular}} shape before they are put into an oven to bake. On May 11, 1875, Alexander P. Ashbourne filed the first patent for the biscuit cutter that consisted of a board to roll the biscuits out on and <b>hinged</b> <b>to</b> a metal plate with various biscuit cutter shapes mounted to it. It was later issued on November 30, 1875.|$|E
25|$|A Slide Away Bed {{is a type}} of {{sofa bed}} that slides to the wall to form a sofa. The {{mattress}} is <b>hinged</b> <b>to</b> form a seating surface and back support. The bed frame support is a telescoping frame that allows the bed platform to recess below the seating cushion. The primitive version of the slide away bed was co-invented by Manning Lane, Warren J. Hauck and Roy O. Sweeney of Cincinnati, Ohio. U.S. patent #4,204,287 was filed on September 5, 1978 and issued on May 27, 1980.|$|E
50|$|The <b>hinging</b> {{referred}} <b>to</b> {{in these}} terms is mounting of the stamp in a stamp album by {{the application of a}} stamp <b>hinge</b> <b>to</b> the back of the stamp. The highest grade is unmounted mint or mint never hinged. The term mint never <b>hinged</b> has developed <b>to</b> provide reassurance to buyers that the stamp has not been tampered with to remove traces of mounting, as the term unmounted mint was thought to be ambiguous.|$|R
50|$|Since {{at least}} medieval times {{there have been}} <b>hinges</b> <b>to</b> draw bridges for {{defensive}} purposes for fortified buildings. Hinges are used in contemporary architecture where building settlement can be expected {{over the life of}} the building. For example, the Dakin Building in Brisbane, California, was designed with its entrance ramp on a large <b>hinge</b> <b>to</b> allow settlement of the building built on piles over bay mud. This device was effective until October 2006, when it was replaced due to damage and excessive ramp slope.|$|R

25|$|The Skywarrior had a 36° degree {{swept wing}} and two Pratt & Whitney J57 {{turbojet}} engines. Early prototypes {{had used the}} intended Westinghouse J40, a powerplant {{that proved to be}} disastrous and subsequently canceled. The turbojets could be supplemented by a provision for twelve 4,500lbf (20kN) thrust JATO bottles. The aircraft had a largely conventional semi-monocoque fuselage, with the engines in underwing nacelles. Flight controls were hydraulic, and for storage below deck, the A-3's wings folded outboard of the engines, lying almost flat, and its vertical stabilizer was <b>hinged</b> <b>to</b> starboard. Capacious internal fuel tanks provided long range.|$|E
25|$|The insect {{mouthparts}} {{consist of}} the maxilla, labium, {{and in some}} species, the mandibles. The labrum is a simple, fused sclerite, often called the upper lip, and moves longitudinally, which is <b>hinged</b> <b>to</b> the clypeus. The mandibles (jaws) are a highly sclerotized pair of structures that move {{at right angles to}} the body, used for biting, chewing, and severing food. The maxillae are paired structures that can also move at right angles to the body and possess segmented palps. The labium (lower lip) is the fused structure that moves longitudinally and possesses a pair of segmented palps.|$|E
25|$|In October 1916, Commodore Murray Sueter, the Air Department's Superintendent of Aircraft Construction, {{solicited}} Sopwith for a single-seat aircraft {{capable of}} carrying a 1,000lb torpedo and sufficient fuel to provide an endurance of four hours. The resulting aircraft, designated T.1 by Sopwith, was a large, three-bay biplane. Because the T.1 was designed to operate from carrier decks, its wings were <b>hinged</b> <b>to</b> fold backwards. The T.1 could take off from a carrier deck in four seconds, {{but it was not}} capable of making a carrier landing and no arresting gear was fitted. A split-axle undercarriage allowed the aircraft to carry a 1,000lb Mk. IX torpedo beneath the fuselage.|$|E

50|$|The arch {{has three}} <b>hinges,</b> {{allowing}} it <b>to</b> be built by cantilevering from each bank, whilst {{anchored to the}} pillars, until it was complete and the anchors could be slackened <b>to</b> allow the <b>hinges</b> <b>to</b> put the weight on the arch. This avoided the need for support from below, {{which might have been}} prone to flood damage.|$|R
25|$|The F-15 had {{a revised}} center pod with pilot and camera {{operator}} seated in tandem {{under a single}} bubble canopy. The first XP-61E, from which the first XF-15 was converted, had the canopy <b>hinged</b> <b>to</b> the side, while all subsequent XF-15 and production F-15 employed a sliding canopy. The aircraft's six cameras were placed in an elongated nose, replacing the XP-61Es four guns. Production F-15A were powered by the same turbosupercharged R-2800-73 engines as the P-61C. The aircraft had a takeoff weight of 32,145lb (14,580kg) and {{a top speed of}} 440mph (382kn, 708km/h) at 33,000ft (10,058m). In the end, only 36 of the 175 ordered F-15As were built, and all were constructed from aircraft originally contracted to be built as P-61C.|$|E
25|$|A {{gridiron}} is a metal grate with {{parallel bars}} typically used for grilling meat, fish, vegetables, or combinations of such foods. It {{may also be}} two such grids, <b>hinged</b> <b>to</b> fold together, to securely hold food while grilling over an open flame. Gridironing is often performed outdoors, using charcoal (real wood or preformed briquettes), wood, or propane gas. The earliest gridiron was a combination hinged gridiron and spider co-invented in 1836 by Amasa and George Sizer of Meriden, Connecticut. U.S. Patent #78 was issued to them jointly on November 14, 1836. The next advancement in the gridiron was a steel wire one was invented and patented in 1889 in New Haven, Connecticut, by William C. Perkins, of the New Haven Wire Goods Company, who received U.S. Patent #408,136 on July 30, 1889, for a hinged gridiron that would hold the meat in place while broiling.|$|E
25|$|The Griffon engine drove an 11ft (3.35 m) {{diameter}} five-bladed propeller, some 7inches (17.8cm) {{larger than}} that fitted to the Mk XIV. To ensure sufficient ground clearance for the new propeller, the undercarriage legs were lengthened by 4.5". The undercarriage legs also had a 7.75inch (19.7cm) wider track to help improve ground handling. The designers then devised a system of levers to shorten the undercarriage legs by about eight inches as they retracted, because the longer legs {{did not have enough}} space in which to retract. These same levers extended the legs as they came down. The larger diameter four spoke mainwheels were strengthened to cope with the greater weights; post-war these were replaced by wider, reinforced three spoke wheels to allow Spitfires to operate from hard concrete or asphalt runways. When retracted the wheels were now fully enclosed by triangular doors which were <b>hinged</b> <b>to</b> {{the outer edge of the}} wheelwells.|$|E
25|$|As {{polypropylene}} is {{resistant to}} fatigue, most plastic living hinges, {{such as those}} on flip-top bottles, are made from this material. However, {{it is important to}} ensure that chain molecules are oriented across the <b>hinge</b> <b>to</b> maximise strength.|$|R
50|$|The SLA was {{composed}} of four fixed 7 ft panels bolted to the Instrument Unit {{on top of the}} S-IVB stage, which were connected via <b>hinges</b> <b>to</b> four 21 ft panels which would open from the top similar to flower petals.|$|R
50|$|The lift {{stands between}} 7m and 8m high. Its main {{components}} are a single upright wooden mast, a wooden boom and a horizontal beam assembly. The horizontal beam assembly {{consists of two}} coupled timber beams. The boom is fixed via a <b>hinged</b> coupling <b>to</b> {{the bottom of the}} mast. The horizontal beam is fixed via a <b>hinge</b> <b>to</b> the top of the mast {{and the end of the}} boom, holding the boom in a diagonal attitude to the mast.|$|R

The second axillary, therefore, is the pivotal sclerite of the wing base, and it specifically manipulates the radial vein.|$|E
25|$|The {{hypopharynx}} is {{a median}} lobe immediately behind the mouth, projecting forwards {{from the back}} of the preoral cavity; it is a lobe of uncertain origin, but perhaps associated with the mandibular segment; in apterygotes, earwigs, and nymphal mayflies, the hypopharynx bears a pair of lateral lobes, the superlinguae (singular: superlingua). It divides the cavity into a dorsal food pouch, or cibarium, and a ventral salivarium into which the salivary duct opens. It is commonly found fused to the libium. Most of the hypopharynx is membranous, but the adoral face is sclerotized distally, and proximally contains a pair of suspensory sclerites extending upwards to end in the lateral wall of the stomodeum. Muscles arising on the frons are inserted into these sclerites, which distally are <b>hinged</b> <b>to</b> a pair of lingual sclerites. These, in turn, have inserted into them antagonistic pairs of muscles arising on the tentorium and labium. The various muscles serve to swing the hypopharynx forwards and back, and in the cockroach, two more muscles run across the hypopharynx and dilate the salivary orifice and expand the salivarium.|$|E
25|$|The Mle 1915 was a {{conventional}} design with a hydro-pneumatic recoil system mounted under the barrel, a gun shield {{to protect the}} crew and a box carriage with wooden wheels. It used an interrupted-screw breech with separate-loading ammunition; the shell being loaded first followed by the proper amount of propellant in a brass cartridge case. A loading tray was <b>hinged</b> <b>to</b> {{the left side of}} the cradle. It was swung into position after the breech had opened to hold the shell before it was pushed into the chamber, which had a catch to hold the shell in place until it could be rammed, but had to be moved out of the way before the breech could be closed for firing. It could be towed by a team of eight horses if a two-wheeled limber was placed under the trail and the barrel pulled back along the trail to move the center of gravity towards the limber. For (slow) motor-traction no limber was necessary and the trail was hooked directly to the tractor.|$|E
