This method is sensitive to changes in the system that change the mixing of the modes during propagation, such as changes in the bending of the fiber, and requires substantial computation resources to scale up to larger numbers of independent modes, but shows great promise.|$|E

40|$|We {{report for}} the first time the use of the {{relatively}} low index material SiON (n= 1. 56) for photonic crystal applications. With this system it is possible to enlarge the complete TE-band gap of a 2 D-photonic crystal by properly designing the unit cell filling. This may be practically realised because of the larger dimensions of photonic crystals in low index materials, which allows less stringent etch conditions when compared to traditional InP based materials. The optimal distribution of the refractive index is found by placing the displacement field in high or in low dielectric material. The structure is defined by two figures of merit, the width of the band gap and the smallest feature size, which is the key factor in etching the structure. In addition, we suggest the use of a graded-index profile to reduce out of plane scattering. This <b>graded</b> <b>index</b> <b>profile</b> can be realised by controlling the nitrogen flow during deposition of the SiON layer...|$|E

40|$|This thesis {{presents}} an original {{contribution to the}} field of planar silica optical waveguide devices. An integrated collimating lens pair is proposed which enables an optical signal to travel in free space between two opposing planar waveguides with minimal optical loss. Each lens in the lens pair consists of a convexly shaped front face to focus the optical beam in the horizontal plane, and a parabolically <b>graded</b> refractive <b>index</b> <b>profile</b> to focus the beam in the vertical plane. The lens pair has significant advantage over alternative means of collimation because the lens fabrication can be integrated with the planar silica waveguide fabrication. The lens pair has application in micro-optical systems which require free-space propagation such as planar waveguide MEMS optical switches and on-chip optical interconnects. This work provides a rigorous theoretical analysis of the lens pair. A design methodology is presented to determine the lens pair parameters required for zero optical power loss for any pre-set propagation distance (excluding reflection loss). The sensitivity of the lens pair to fabrication errors is investigated by using the Beam Propagation Method (BPM). The propagation of an optical beam is simulated under conditions of etch mask angular and lateral misalignment, deviation of the parabolically <b>graded</b> <b>index</b> lens from the desired refractive <b>index</b> <b>profile,</b> poor dimensional control of the planar silica waveguides, and non-vertical etching of the front face of the lens. A compensation scheme is proposed to minimise the optical loss caused by the non-vertical front face etch and the effectiveness of this technique is verified through further BPM simulation.

The proposed GP-index profile in this paper can obtain an extremely low average reflectance of 4. 61 × 10 − 7 % {{over a wide range}} of incident angles and wavelengths which is obviously superior to the average reflectance of 8. 09 × 10 − 3 %, 3. 29 × 10 − 4 % and 4. 35 × 10 − 5 % for linear profile, cubic profile and quintic profile. That means, Fresnel reflection almost can be eliminated by the optimal GP-index profile for omnidirectional incidence over a broad wavelength range. Moreover, it is demonstrated the proposed GP-index profile has better robustness, and it still has the best broadband and omnidirectional antireflection characteristics for the TiO 2 /SiO 2 graded-index AR coating. Therefore, the proposed GP-index profile is obviously superior to the conventional linear profile, cubic profile and quintic profile, and the design methodology presented in this paper that uses a genetic programming technique is a quite convenient means to pursue an optimal nonlinear refractive <b>index</b> <b>profile</b> with broadband and omnidirectional antireflection characteristics. 1...|$|R
