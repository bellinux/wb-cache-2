5|$|According to the International Energy Agency, {{cellulosic}} ethanol biorefineries {{could allow}} biofuels {{to play a}} much bigger role in the future than {{organizations such as the}} IEA previously thought. Cellulosic ethanol can be made from plant matter composed primarily of inedible cellulose fibers that form the stems and branches of most plants. Crop residues (such as corn stalks, wheat straw and rice straw), wood waste, and municipal solid waste are potential sources of cellulosic biomass. Dedicated energy crops, such as switchgrass, are also promising cellulose sources that can be sustainably produced <b>in</b> <b>many</b> <b>regions.</b>|$|E
5|$|Among {{the many}} ways of {{classifying}} plants are by regional floras, which, depending on the purpose of study, can also include fossil flora, remnants of plant life from a previous era. People <b>in</b> <b>many</b> <b>regions</b> and countries take great pride in their individual arrays of characteristic flora, which can vary widely across the globe {{due to differences in}} climate and terrain.|$|E

5|$|A {{number of}} {{traditional}} pastimes {{have emerged in}} Madagascar. Moraingy, a type of hand-to-hand combat, is a popular spectator sport in coastal regions. It is traditionally practiced by men, but women have recently begun to participate. The wrestling of zebu cattle, which is named savika or tolon-omby, is also practiced <b>in</b> <b>many</b> <b>regions.</b> In addition to sports, {{a wide variety of}} games are played. Among the most emblematic is fanorona, a board game widespread throughout the Highland regions. According to folk legend, the succession of King Andrianjaka after his father Ralambo was partially due to the obsession that Andrianjaka's older brother may have had with playing fanorona to the detriment of his other responsibilities.|$|E
5|$|Of the 22 {{species of}} {{albatross}} recognised by the IUCN, all {{are listed as}} at some level of concern; 3 species are Critically Endangered, 5 species are Endangered, 7 species are Near Threatened, and 7 species are Vulnerable. Numbers of albatrosses have declined in the past due to harvesting for feathers, but today the albatrosses are threatened by introduced species, such as rats and feral cats that attack eggs, chicks and nesting adults; by pollution; by a serious decline in fish stocks <b>in</b> <b>many</b> <b>regions</b> largely due to overfishing; and by longline fishing. Longline fisheries pose the greatest threat, as feeding birds are attracted to the bait, become hooked on the lines, and drown. Identified stakeholders such as governments, conservation organisations {{and people in the}} fishing industry are all working toward reducing this bycatch.|$|E

5|$|Although {{none of the}} Drosera {{species in}} the United States are federally protected, all are listed as {{threatened}} or endangered in some states. Additionally, many of the remaining native populations lie on protected land, such as national parks or wildlife preserves. Drosera species are protected by law in many European countries, such as Germany, Austria, Switzerland, the Czech Republic, Finland, Hungary, France, and Bulgaria. Currently, the largest threat in Europe and North America is habitat destruction for development projects, {{as well as the}} draining of bogs for agricultural uses and peat harvesting. <b>In</b> <b>many</b> <b>regions,</b> this has led to the extirpation of some species from parts of their former range. Reintroduction of plants into such habitats is usually difficult or impossible, as the ecological needs of certain populations is closely tied to their geographical location. Through increased legal protection of bogs and moors, as well as a concentrated effort to renaturalize such habitats, the threat to these plants' survival might be curbed, although most species would remain endangered. The relatively unimpressive image of these plants, as well as their small, low growth, makes them difficult to protect. As part of the landscape, sundews are often overlooked or not recognized at all.|$|E
5|$|Although zduhaći (plural) {{could be}} women and children, most were adult men. Their supernatural power {{was thought to}} be inborn. <b>In</b> <b>many</b> <b>regions</b> it was {{regarded}} that the zduhaći were born with a caul—white or red, depending on the regional belief. The mother would dry the caul and sew into a piece of garment always worn by the child, such as a pouch attached under the child's armpit. In the clan of Kuči, eastern Montenegro, the mother would preserve the caul hiding it from all eyes, and hand it to her son when he grew up. The caul was supposed to protect him when he flew as a zduhać. If the caul was destroyed, the child's supernatural power would be lost. A birthmark of a zduhać in Herzegovina could be a tuft of hair growing on his shoulder or upper arm. In Montenegrin Littoral, the caul played no role in the birth of zduhaći, who were rather born on certain Fridays at a set hour. There was also a belief in Herzegovina that male children who were conceived on the eves of great feast days would become zduhaći.|$|E

5|$|Safety {{features}} on Lexus models range from {{stability and handling}} programs (Vehicle Stability Control and Vehicle Dynamics Integrated Management) to backup cameras, swivel headlights, and sonar warning systems. The Lexus Pre-Collision System (PCS) integrates multiple safety systems. In 2007, Lexus introduced the first car safety systems with infrared and pedestrian detection capabilities, lane keep assist, a Driver Monitoring System with facial recognition monitoring of driver attentiveness, and rear pre-collision whiplash protection, {{as part of the}} LS 460 PCS. As a safety precaution, Lexus GPS navigation systems <b>in</b> <b>many</b> <b>regions</b> feature a motion lockout when the vehicle reaches a set speed; to prevent distraction, navigation inputs are limited, while voice input and certain buttons are still accessible. This safety feature has attracted criticism because passengers cannot use certain functions when the vehicle is in motion. Pre-2007 models came with a hidden manufacturer override option, and updated European models allow operation in motion.|$|E
5|$|The diverse {{origins of}} Malagasy culture {{are evident in}} its {{tangible}} expressions. The most emblematic instrument of Madagascar, the valiha, is a bamboo tube zither carried to Madagascar by early settlers from southern Borneo, and is very similar in form {{to those found in}} Indonesia and the Philippines today. Traditional houses in Madagascar are likewise similar to those of southern Borneo in terms of symbolism and construction, featuring a rectangular layout with a peaked roof and central support pillar. Reflecting a widespread veneration of the ancestors, tombs are culturally significant <b>in</b> <b>many</b> <b>regions</b> and tend to be built of more durable material, typically stone, and display more elaborate decoration than the houses of the living. The production and weaving of silk {{can be traced back to}} the island's earliest settlers, and Madagascar's national dress, the woven lamba, has evolved into a varied and refined art.|$|E
5|$|Major {{cities and}} {{regional}} rivalry {{played an important}} role in the wars. The disappearance of a central, imperial authority—and in some cases of even a local, viceregal authority (as in the cases of New Granada and Río de la Plata)—initiated a prolonged period of balkanization <b>in</b> <b>many</b> <b>regions</b> of Spanish America. It was not clear which political units which should replace the empire, and there were no new national identities to replace the traditional sense of being Spaniards. The original juntas of 1810 appealed first, to a sense of being Spanish, which was counterposed to the French threat; second, to a general American identity, which was counterposed to the Peninsula lost to the French; and third, to a sense of belonging to the major cities or local province, the patria in Spanish. More often than not, juntas sought to maintain a province's independence from the capital of the former viceroyalty or captaincy general as much as from the Peninsula itself. Armed conflicts broke out between the provinces over the question of whether some cities or provinces were to be subordinate to others as they had been under the crown. This phenomenon was particularly evident in South America. This rivalry also leads some regions to adopt the opposite political cause to that chosen by their rivals. Peru seems to have remained strongly royalist in large part because of its rivalry with Río de la Plata, to which it had lost control of Upper Peru when the latter was elevated to a viceroyalty in 1776. The creation of juntas in Río de la Plata allowed Peru to regain formal control of Upper Peru for the duration of the wars.|$|E
