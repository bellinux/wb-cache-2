Tissue swabs are taken from the inner eyelids, sinus, and trachea. Many serology tests can be performed to diagnose M. gallisepticum: serum plate agglutination (SPA) test, <b>hemagglutination</b> <b>inhibition</b> <b>test</b> (HI), or enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA).

Antiserum prepared in rabbits was found to be specific for S. necrophorus hemagglutinins when tested against 20 isolates of S. necrophorus and 117 other bacteria belonging to 22 genera.

40|$|Avian {{influenza}} viruses replicate in {{a variety}} of mammals and birds, yet <b>hemagglutination</b> <b>inhibition</b> <b>tests</b> show that postinfection sera from these animals (e. g., ferrets and ducks) have insignificant levels of antibodies (Hinshaw et al., Infect. Immun. 34 : 354 - 361, 1981). This suggested that avian influenza viruses, in contrast to mammalian viruses, may not induce a significant humoral response. Studies reported here indicate that avian influenza viruses do induce high levels of antibodies in ferrets, ducks, and mice and produce long-lived memory for cytotoxic T-cells in mice. The failure to detect hemagglutination-inhibiting antibodies to avian viruses was explained by the finding that antibodies to avian influenza viruses were not detectable in <b>hemagglutination</b> <b>inhibition</b> <b>tests</b> with intact virus yet were readily demonstrable when hemagglutinin subunits were used. In addition, these sera contained high levels of neutralizing antibodies to the avian virus. These findings suggest that the hemagglutinins of avian and mammalian influenza viruses may differ in their accessibility to antibodies or the biological consequence of antibody attachment or both. The practical consequence of these studies is that <b>hemagglutination</b> <b>inhibition</b> <b>tests</b> with intact avian viruses fail to detect antibody and do not correlate with virus neutralization. The avian virus used in these studies, A/Mallard/NY/ 6870 / 78 (H 2 N 2), replicated and caused mortality in BALB/c mice, emphasizing that the host range and virulence of avian viruses extends to mammals. The above findings suggest that avian viruses could infect mammals in nature, yet seroepidemiological studies with conventional <b>hemagglutination</b> <b>inhibition</b> <b>tests</b> could give misleading results...|$|R
40|$|A rotavirus, {{designated}} as the H- 1 strain, was isolated from a diarrheic foal in primary African green monkey kidney cells and MA 104 cells. This cell culture-adapted strain hemagglutinated erythrocytes of human group O, rhesus monkeys, guinea pigs, and sheep. It {{was found to be}} similar, if not identical, to porcine rotaviruses (strains OSU, EE, and A- 580) by plaque reduction neutralization and <b>hemagglutination</b> <b>inhibition</b> <b>tests,</b> and, in addition, it was found to belong to subgroup 1. This equine rotavirus has an RNA electrophoretic migration pattern which was distinct from those of the three strains of porcine rotavirus. The serological relationship established by plaque reduction neutralization and <b>hemagglutination</b> <b>inhibition</b> <b>tests</b> between the equine (H- 1) and porcine (OSU, EE, and A- 580) rotaviruses {{is an example of a}} rotavirus of the same serotype being isolated from different species. The H- 1 strain was distinct from four human rotavirus serotypes (Wa, DS- 1, P, and St. Thomas 4) as well as from bovine rotavirus NCDV, simian rotavirus MMU 18006, and canine rotavirus CU- 1 by plaque reduction neutralization tests.

The CLIA was compared with an enzyme-linked fluorescence assay and a <b>hemagglutination</b> <b>inhibition</b> <b>test</b> on a total of 40 serum specimens obtained from 29 donors with natural infection or vaccination. There was good correlation between the three methods, and {{the sensitivity of the}} CLIA was about 10 times higher than that of the <b>hemagglutination</b> <b>inhibition</b> <b>test,</b> although it was slightly inferior to that of the enzyme-linked fluorescence assay.

40|$|The rapidly sedimenting {{hemagglutinin}} (RHA) {{representing the}} purified virion and the slower-sedimenting hemagglutinin (SHA) of several flaviviruses were separated {{and used in}} <b>hemagglutination</b> <b>inhibition</b> <b>tests</b> with the 19 S (immunoglobulin M) and 7 S (immunoglobulin G) immunoglobulin fractions of rabbit antisera, prepared against purified viral antigens or against crude virus pools. The antibody specificity in tests with RHA was identical to the specificity in those employing SHA. 7 S antibody cross-reacted broadly with all flavivirus antigens, whereas 19 S antibodies were relatively specific in cross-reactions among flaviviruses (RHA or SHA). SHA was consistently inhibited by antibody {{to a greater extent}} than RHA. Anti-envelope protein, anti-RHA antibodies and anti-SHA antibodies were unable to discriminate between RHA and SHA. It was concluded that the relative amounts of RHA or SHA in crude hemagglutinin preparations have no influence on the result of <b>hemagglutination</b> <b>inhibition</b> <b>tests</b> with flaviviruses...|$|R
40|$|The fiber knob {{carries the}} type-specific gamma-antigen {{which can be}} {{demonstrated}} in <b>hemagglutination</b> <b>inhibition</b> <b>tests.</b> In order to characterize the gamma-determinant we selected subgenus DI adenovirus serotypes 9 and 19 (Ad 9 and Ad 19) which exhibited 29 amino acid exchanges in the knob domain. Like all subgenus DI adenoviruses they showed a complete hemagglutination pattern with rat and human erythrocytes. We constructed a total of 14 chimeric Ad 9 /Ad 19 and Ad 19 /Ad 9 fiber proteins, which possessed fiber knobs with progressively exchanged Ad 9 and Ad 19 amino acids. Furthermore, we created 39 fiber proteins with distinct amino acid exchanges in the knob regions by primer-directed mutagenesis. The proteins were expressed in Escherichia coli and tested in <b>hemagglutination</b> and <b>hemagglutination</b> <b>inhibition</b> <b>tests.</b> From our results we can conclude that the type-specific gamma-determinant is not restricted to a distinct region on the adenovirus fiber knob but is composed of at least 17 amino acids. Most of the amino acids contributing to the Ad 9 and Ad 19 gamma-determinants are located on the fiber knob loops...|$|R

40|$|We {{describe}} here a microneutralization {{procedure for}} conveniently testing {{large numbers of}} specimens for antibodies to enterovirus 70. The test utilized human rhabdomyosarcoma cells and was read by staining with crystal violet after 4 days of incubation. The test compares well with other serological assays, being more sensitive than the standard tube neutralization test and the complement fixation test, but less sensitive than the <b>hemagglutination</b> <b>inhibition</b> <b>test.</b> However, the <b>hemagglutination</b> <b>inhibition</b> <b>test</b> required concentrated, partially purified virus as antigen, as did the complement fixation test, and was difficult to read, so that its greater sensitivity may not be of practical significance.

40|$|Barmah Forest {{virus has}} been {{characterized}} {{in a number of}} ways including electron microscopy of infected cells; physical studies of the virion, its RNA, and associated proteins; N-terminal sequence analysis of the two envelope glycoproteins; studies of macromolecular species present in infected cells; and serological cross-reactions with alphaviruses and bunyaviruses. From these results Barmah Forest virus is clearly an alphavirus since the structure of the virion, the mode of replication, and the macromolecular species present in infected cells are typical of alphaviruses. The N-terminal regions of the two glycoproteins El and E 2 show extensive sequence homology (approximately 50 %) with those of other alphaviruses. Barmah Forest virus cross-reacts in <b>hemagglutination</b> <b>inhibition</b> <b>tests,</b> although not in complement fixation tests or infectivity neutralization tests, with other alphaviruses. In some of its properties Barmah Forest virus is unusual, however. It cross-reacts in complement fixation and <b>hemagglutination</b> <b>inhibition</b> <b>tests</b> with Umbre virus, a bunyavirus, which originally led it to be classified as a bunyavirus; the glycosylation pattern of E 2 of Barmah Forest virus appears to differ from that of other alphaviruses; and the sedimentation coefficient of the virion appears to be slightly less than that of other alphaviruses...|$|R

40|$|The {{accuracy}} and reproducibility of antibody levels obtained by single radial hemolysis with six internal reference sera were evaluated. The test {{was performed in}} a clinical laboratory for routine assessment of immunity to rubella infection {{over a period of}} 1 year. A linear relationship exists between the antibody titer (expressed in log dilution) and zone diameters. In 43 of 44 test runs the correlation coefficient of the standard curve was over 0. 990. Prediction limits of 95 % around the curve showed that on replication of the test, zone diameters could be found within less than half a doubling-dilution step. The antibody level can thus be determined more accurately by the single radial hemolysis test than in the conventional <b>hemagglutination</b> <b>inhibition</b> <b>test.</b> This is particularly important in assessing immunity when antibody titers are low, since the <b>hemagglutination</b> <b>inhibition</b> <b>test</b> is less reliable then.

40|$|In the 2004 - 2005 season, {{there was}} a large {{epidemic}} of the influenza B virus Yamagata group in Kobe, Japan. In <b>hemagglutination</b> <b>inhibition</b> <b>tests,</b> most of the clinical isolates from Kobe showed antigenicities similar to those of previous isolates (the vaccine-type virus). Only a few antigenic variants were isolated around the peak of the epidemic; however, Kobe residents developed antibodies against the variants during the season. The antigenic variants showed a one-point mutation of a nucleotide in the HA 1 gene (C 440 A or G 421 A), which resulted in the substitution of one amino acid in the 150 loop of the HA molecule (T 147 N or G 141 R). The 150 loop is one of four epitopes of the hemagglutinin molecule of the influenza B virus. We established a system to detect one-point differences in the nucleotides of the 150 loop by means of high-resolution melting curve analysis with LCGreen. With this system, the isolates were determined to be the vaccine-type virus, antigenic variants, or a mixture of both. Some isolates were shown to be mixtures although they had been recognized as the vaccine-type virus with the <b>hemagglutination</b> <b>inhibition</b> <b>tests.</b> Thus, the antigenic variants appeared in the early period of the epidemic and were cocirculating with the vaccine-type virus during the epidemic...|$|R

40|$|Approximately 7 % of the sera {{tested to}} {{determine}} the presence of rubella-specific antibodies by the <b>hemagglutination</b> <b>inhibition</b> <b>test</b> demonstrated abnormal patterns of reactivity, rendering the test unreadable. Another 3 % of sera were shown to have false-positive titers as high as 1 : 128. When these abnormally reacting and false-positive sera were heated at 56 degrees C for 30 min after chemical treatment they always converted to negative, indicating the absence of specific rubella hemagglutination-inhibiting antibody. These results were confirmed by fractionation of the sera after sucrose gradient centrifugation. It was established that manifestation of these nonspecific results was dependent on the concentration of Ca 2 + or Mn 2 +. The heat-labile inhibitor(s) responsible for abnormal and false-positive reactions was found not to be complement. This inhibitor(s) was detected in the light fractions of sera and when added to negative sera was capable of reproducing the abnormal patterns of reactivity. These results emphasize the necessity of heating sera for the rubella <b>hemagglutination</b> <b>inhibition</b> <b>test</b> after the chemical removal of nonspecific inhibitors...|$|E

The virus was typed as adenovirus type 22 in neutralization tests and was related closely to types 10, 19, and 37 in <b>hemagglutination</b> <b>inhibition</b> <b>tests.</b> The DNA cleavage patterns of the eight strains with nine restriction endonucleases were the same with one exception but {{different from those of the}} above serologically related species.

40|$|A {{radioimmunoassay}} {{procedure was}} developed for determining smallpox and vaccinia antibodies in human sera. The test detected and measured both primary and secondary immune responses in persons infected with variola virus or vaccinia virus.

In sequential serum specimens, the radioimmunoassay test indicated fourfold or greater increases {{in all of the}} smallpox patients and in six of eight vaccinated persons. Both the complement fixation and the <b>hemagglutination</b> <b>inhibition</b> <b>tests</b> were less effective. In persons who had been vaccinated, radioimmunoassay and plaque reduction neutralization tests appeared to measure the same immune response. However, in smallpox patients the immune response was readily detected by radioimmunoassay, whereas an immune response was not detected by the plaque reduction neutralization test when vaccinia virus was the antigen in the test system.
