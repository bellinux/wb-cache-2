5000|$|Big Muskie was {{powered by}} {{electricity}} supplied at 13,800 volts via a trailing cable, {{which had its}} own transporter/coiling units to move it. The electricity powered the main drives, eighteen [...] and ten [...] DC electric motors. Some systems in Big Muskie were electro-hydraulic, but the main drives were all electric. While working, Big Muskie used {{the equivalent of the}} power for 27,500 homes, costing {{tens of thousands of dollars}} an hour just in power costs and necessitating special agreements with local Ohio power companies to accommodate the extra load. The machine had a crew of five, and worked around the clock, with special emphasis on night work since the per <b>kilowatt-hour</b> <b>rate</b> was much cheaper.|$|E
40|$|Abstract: Solar PV panels {{generate}} electricity only during daylight hours and generate more electricity {{when the sun}} is shining more intensely. As a result, in summer-peaking electricity systems, such as California and most of the U. S., power from PVs is produced disproportionately at times when the value of electricity is high. Thus, a valuation of solar PV electricity production that uses only the average wholesale cost of electricity will tend to undervalue the power. Yet, that is what happens by default in many installations because solar PVs are generally located at the end-user’s premises and those end-users are often billed on a flat per <b>kilowatt-hour</b> <b>rate</b> that does not reflect time-varying valuation. As a result, the benefits to many owners of solar PV in reduced electricity bills do not reflect thetruetime-varyingvaluationofthepowerthepanelsproduce. IusesolarPVproduction information in conjunction with wholesale price data and simulations to estimate the actual wholesale value of power from solar PVs and the degree of bias that occurs from using a constant price to value electricity generated by solar PVs. I find that in the California locations I analyze, the most credible long-run valuation of solar PV power is 29 %- 48 % greater than results from valuation at a flat-rate tariff, depending on the location of the P...|$|E

25|$|In 1906, voters {{approved}} a $3.25 Million Dollar expenditure {{for development of}} a hydroelectric plan at Pointe du Bois. Immediately following the decision to build the Pointe du Bois plant, the price of electricity charged {{by the private sector}} in Winnipeg dropped from 20 cents per kilowatt-hour to 10 cents and subsequently to 7 1/2 cents. After completion of the plant in 1911, Winnipeg Hydro set its rate at 3 1/3 cents per <b>kilowatt-hour.</b> This <b>rate</b> remained unchanged until 1973. Customers of Winnipeg Hydro enjoyed among the lowest electricity rates in North America.|$|R
