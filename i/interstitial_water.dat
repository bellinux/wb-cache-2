25|$|When {{sedimentation}} continues, {{an older}} rock layer becomes buried deeper as a result. The lithostatic {{pressure in the}} rock increases due to {{the weight of the}} overlying sediment. This causes compaction, a process in which grains mechanically reorganize. Compaction is, for example, an important diagenetic process in clay, which can initially consist of 60% water. During compaction, this <b>interstitial</b> <b>water</b> is pressed out of pore spaces. Compaction can also be the result of dissolution of grains by pressure solution. The dissolved material precipitates again in open pore spaces, which means there is a net flow of material into the pores. However, in some cases, a certain mineral dissolves and does not precipitate again. This process, called leaching, increases pore space in the rock.|$|E

Little vegetation colonisation has occurred in the last 60â€“75 years and has been attributed to a combination of surface elevations too low for pioneer species to develop, and poor drainage from the compacted agricultural soils acting as an aquaclude. Terrestrial soils of this nature need to adjust from fresh to saline <b>interstitial</b> <b>water</b> by a change in the chemistry and the structure of the soil, accompanied with fresh deposition of estuarine sediment, before salt marsh vegetation can establish. The vegetation structure, species richness, and plant community composition of salt marshes naturally regenerated on reclaimed agricultural land can be compared to adjacent reference salt marshes to assess the success of marsh regeneration.|$|E

50|$|Equilibrium {{partitioning}} Sediment Benchmarks (ESBs) are {{a type of}} Sediment Quality Guideline (SQG) {{derived by}} the USEPA {{for the protection of}} benthic organisms. ESBs are based on the bioavailable concentration of contaminants in sediments rather than the dry-weight concentration. It has been demonstrated that sediment concentrations on a dry-weight basis often do not predict biological effects. <b>Interstitial</b> <b>water</b> concentrations, however, predict biological effects much better. This is true because the chemical present in the <b>interstitial</b> <b>water</b> (or pore water) is the uncomplexed/free phase of the chemical that is bioavailable and toxic to benthic organisms. Other phases of the chemical are bound to sediment particles like organic carbon (OC) or acid volatile sulfides (AVS) and are not bioavailable. Thus the <b>interstitial</b> <b>water</b> concentration is important to consider for effects to benthic organisms.|$|E
50|$|Equilibrium {{partitioning}} theory (EqP) {{forms the}} basis for ESBs developed to account for bioavailability of contaminants in sediments. The concentration of <b>interstitial</b> <b>water</b> reflects the chemical's activity and is a surrogate for bioavailability. EqP theory holds that a non-ionic chemical in sediment partitions between sediment OC, <b>interstitial</b> <b>water</b> and benthic organisms. For cationic metals, the chemical also partitions onto sediment AVS, as well as sedimentary OC. At equilibrium, if the partition coefficients are known along with the concentration {{in any one of}} the phases, then the concentrations of the other phases can be predicted.|$|E

The OC-normalized concentration of sediment concentrations is easily calculated by measuring total OC in sediments synoptically with dry weight concentrations.

Elevated concentration of dissolved iron (0. 34 mg/l) was observed only in highly reduced terrigenous sediments from the shelf and continental slope of Mexico.

Concentrations of dissolved constituents in <b>interstitial</b> <b>waters</b> varied according to land use in the two watersheds and to the effects of the mine spill. Levels of dissolved Co, Cu, Mo, Ti, and Zn were higher in pore waters from the Guadiamar River than in the Partido Stream, suggesting that concentrations of trace elements are still influenced by the spill. In contrast, concentrations of dissolved nutrients (NHC 4, NOK 2, NOK 3, POK 3 4) and some trace metals used in fertilizers (e. g. Al and Cr) were higher in the Partido Stream.
