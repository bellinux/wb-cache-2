50|$|Spider-Man's overall {{metabolic}} efficiency {{has been}} greatly increased, and the composition of his skeleton, connective tissues, muscles, and nervous system have all been enhanced. Originally, Peter Parker wore glasses, but after the spider bite, his vision became 20/20, allowing him to see perfectly after his spectacles were broken by Flash Thompson. Spider-Man is capable of healing injuries faster and more extensively than ordinary humans, including <b>injuries</b> <b>as</b> <b>severe</b> <b>as</b> broken bones {{within a matter of}} hours. During a battle with a villain called the Masked Marauder, Spider-Man is rendered completely blind. However, during a visit to an eye specialist, it is revealed that Spider-Man is already healing only hours later. After about two days, Spider-Man's 20/20 vision is restored, although his eyes are sensitive for about a day after, shown when Carrion flashed a bright light in his face. Afterwards, his eyes are completely healed. However, Spider-Man's healing factor has not been depicted as being anywhere near as rapid as that of Deadpool and Wolverine in as much as he has suffered life-threatening injuries that would not have endangered those other superhumans.|$|E
5000|$|Lobo first {{appeared}} {{on the small screen}} in the series Superman: The Animated Series, voiced by Brad Garrett. As in the comics, Lobo possesses exceptional strength and durability, as well as his usual over-the-top arsenal of weapons. The healing powers and advanced senses that he possesses in the comics are not shown, although he never sustains <b>injuries</b> <b>as</b> <b>severe</b> <b>as</b> he does in the comics. Lobo's gutting hook is used only twice in his appearances in Superman: The Animated Series episode [...] "The Main Man", and it is not used for combative purposes, due to SAP as well as difficulty animating the weapon. He mostly uses a crowbar, or simply his fists, for bludgeoning his opposition. In the episode [...] "The Main Man", Lobo is hired by an alien named the [...] "Preserver" [...] to capture Superman and add him to the Preserver's collection of rare and endangered species. Preserver decides to add Lobo to his collection as well, since Lobo was also the last of his own race. Superman and Lobo join forces to escape. In return, Lobo promises to leave Earth alone. Lobo briefly appears in [...] "Warrior Queen" [...] in which Maxima falls in love with Superman. After Superman leaves, Lobo arrives in Maxima's throne room with a bounty on De'Cine and Maxima starts to get obsessed with Lobo.|$|E
40|$|The aim of {{the study}} is to compare trends, {{circumstances}} and outcomes of single- versus multi-vehicle bicycle on-road crashes in Victoria, Australia, through the analysis of police records and hospital admissions between January 2004 and December 2008. The results show that over 80 % of on-road single-vehicle bicycle crashes occurred {{as a result of the}} cyclist losing control of the bicycle with the remainder involving collisions with objects. Compared with multi-vehicle crashes, single-vehicle crashes were more likely to occur in the dark, in wet conditions and in rural areas. Over half of the cyclists hospitalised as result of on-road crashes were injured in single-vehicle crashes and this proportion seems to be increasing over time. Single-vehicle crashes were associated with hospitalised <b>injuries</b> <b>as</b> <b>severe</b> <b>as</b> those resulting from multivehicle crashes. The findings highlight the significant burden of serious injury associated with single-vehicle bicycle road crashes. Further research is needed to investigate in greater detail the risk factors of these crashes and the effectiveness of countermeasures to reduce their burden. The increase in the popularity of cycling as a healthy and sustainable mode of transport 1 2 has resulted in a significant amount of research examin-ing the risk factors for crashes between cyclists and motor vehicles. 3 – 5 In contrast, very little is known about the characteristics of on-road single-vehicle bicycle crashes mainly due to their under-reporting in police crash data. 6 7 Studies based on healthcare services data have found that single-vehicle bicycle crashes make up the majority of injurious cyclist crashes. ...|$|E

50|$|Consent {{may be a}} {{complete}} or partial defense to assault. In some jurisdictions, most notably England, {{it is not a}} defense where the degree of <b>injury</b> is <b>severe,</b> <b>as</b> long as there is no legally recognized good reason for the assault. This can have important consequences when dealing with issues such as consensual sadomasochistic sexual activity, the most notable case being the Operation Spanner case. Legally recognized good reasons for consent include surgery, activities within the rules of a game (Mixed martial arts, wrestling, boxing, or contact sports), bodily adornment (R v Wilson), or horseplay (Jones and others). However, any activity outside {{the rules of the game}} is not legally recognized as a defense of consent. In Scottish Law, consent is not a defense for assault.|$|R
5000|$|At {{the time}} the D.C. Fire {{department}} was officially founded on September 23, 1871, there were five fire companies in all, but due to the increasing needs of the growing city, the fire department quickly expanded. In his annual report of 1883, Chief Engineer Cronin recommended that “a new company and a new engine house organized somewhere northward of M street, between 7th and 14th Streets, N. W.” Following this recommendation, the firehouse located at 931 R St, N. W. was built during 1884, and first put into service on January 23, 1885 as Engine House No. 7. The firehouse was considered a model of efficient design, and was equipped with an 1885 450 GPM (gallon per minute) Clapp & Jones steam engine with an 1879 McDermott Bros. hose reel carriage. Installed just one month before {{the dedication of the}} newly completed Washington Monument, the Engine Company at 931 R Street was witness to some of the more spectacular and notorious fires and disasters of the District’s history. Within weeks after their establishment, Engine Co. No. 7 was called into service in February 1885 to help fight the National Theater fire. The 1885 fire was the third major fire at the National Theater site, and proved to be such a difficult fire to tame that the entire building burned down. The fire nearly killed multiple members of the fire department, but none of the <b>injuries</b> were <b>as</b> <b>severe</b> <b>as</b> those incurred by “Frank Wagner, the foreman of No. 7 Engine company, who, while directing a stream of water from the Harris house roof, was very badly burned about the hands and face.” ...|$|R
40|$|Purpose: To {{evaluate}} {{the return to}} work (RTW) rate, time and predictors among trauma patients using survival analysis. Methods: This cohort {{study was conducted with}} a three-month follow-up on 300 trauma patients hospitalized in Shahid Beheshti Hospital, Kashan, Iran in 2014. The data were collected through conducting interviews and referring to patients' medical records during their hospital stay and follow-up information at one & three months after discharge from hospital. Final analysis was conducted on the data retrieved from 273 patients. Data were analyzed by chi-square test, Mann–Whitney U test and survival analysis method. Results: The rate of RTW {{at the end of the}} first and the third follow-up months was respectively 21. 6 % and 61. 2 %. Survival analysis showed that the RTW time (Time between admission to first return to work) was significantly longer among patients with illiteracy, drug abuse, hospitalization history in the intensive care unit, low socioeconomic status, non-insurance coverage, longer hospital stay, multiple and <b>severe</b> <b>injuries</b> <b>as</b> well <b>as</b> <b>severe</b> disability. Conclusion: Our findings indicated that trauma has profound effects on the rate and time of RTW. Besides disability, many personal and clinical factors can affect the outcome of RTW...|$|R
2500|$|The main feud {{heading into}} In Your House 13 was between Bret Hart, Stone Cold Steve Austin, The Undertaker, and Vader over the finish of the Royal Rumble. As per stipulation, {{the winner of}} the Rumble match would face the WWF Champion for his title at WrestleMania 13. At the Royal Rumble event, Shawn Michaels won the title from Sycho Sid in the main event {{following}} the Rumble match and avenged the loss he suffered at the hands of Sid at Survivor Series the previous November. According to Bret Hart, Michaels was scheduled to drop the title to him at WrestleMania in return for Hart having dropped the title to Michaels at the same event one year earlier. Michaels later suffered a legitimate knee injury during a three-way match with Sid and Bret Hart two weeks after the Royal Rumble, and on the February 13, 1997 edition of Raw, known as Thursday Raw Thursday, Michaels vacated the title by speaking to the fans, telling them that he was told by doctors that he suffered a very bad knee injury and that he should at least consider retirement. He stated that he [...] "had to find his smile again", which he had [...] "lost" [...] somewhere down the line. Michaels spent time rehabbing his knee at the same time Steve Austin was rehabbing his knee injury at HealthSouth in San Antonio. This did not sit well with Hart, who had legitimate backstage problems with Michaels at this time and who also thought Michaels' <b>injury</b> was not <b>as</b> <b>severe</b> <b>as</b> he was claiming it to be.|$|R
40|$|Objectives: The {{stomach is}} a {{sensitive}} digestive organ that {{is susceptible to}} exogenous pathogens from the diet. In response to such pathogens, the stomach induc-es oxidative stress, which {{might be related to}} the devel-opment of both gastric organic disorders such as gas-tritis, gastric ulcers, and gastric cancer, and functional disorders such as functional dyspepsia. This study was accomplished to investigate the effect of Ganoderma lucidum pharmacopuncture (GLP) on chronic gastric ulcers in rats. Methods: The rats were divided into 4 groups of 8 an-imals each: the normal, the control, the normal saline (NP) and the GLP groups. In this study, the modified ethanol gastritis model was used. The rats were admin-istrated 56 % ethanol orally every other day. The dose of ethanol was 8 g/kg body weight. The normal group received the same amount of normal saline instead of ethanol. The NP and the GLP groups were treated with injection of saline and GLP respectively. The control group received no treatment. Two local acupoints CV 12 (中脘) and ST 36 (足三里) were used. All laboratory rats underwent treatment for 15 days. On last day, the rats were sacrificed and their stomachs were immediately excised. Results: Ulcers of the gastric mucosa appeared as elongated bands of hemorrhagic lesions parallel to the long axis of the stomach. In the NP and GLP groups, the injuries to the gastric mucosal <b>injuries</b> were not <b>as</b> <b>severe</b> <b>as</b> they were in the control group. Wound healings of the chronic gastric ulcers was promoted by using GLP and significant alterations of the indices in the gastric mucosa were observed. Such protection was demonstrated by gross appearance, histology and immunehistochemistry staining for Bcl- 2 -associated X (BAX), B-cell lymphoma 2 (Bcl- 2) and Transforming growth factor-beta 1 (TGF-β 1). Conclusion: These results suggest that GLP at CV 12 and ST 36 can provide significant protection to the gas-tric mucosa against an ethanol induced chronic gastric ulcer. 1...|$|R
