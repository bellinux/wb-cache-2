He also said it was the first penalty shoot-out he had ever won as a manager: [...] "I won the Charity Shield that way, but that doesn't really count. The European Cup? The FA Cup? The Scottish cups? Never. I've lost three with Aberdeen and three with United, so seventh time lucky — magnificent." [...] Ferguson later apologised to Park Ji-sung for not including him in the matchday squad. Cristiano Ronaldo expressed his relief at his side's shoot-out victory, saying, [...] "In my opinion I played well in the game, scored a goal, and then missed the penalty. It would have been the worst day of my life. We deserved to win as we played better in the whole game. It means <b>everything</b> <b>to</b> <b>me,</b> we have won both trophies, it is the best day in my life."

2500|$|In June 1970, {{after one}} season at Miami, Bo Schembechler offered Burton an {{assistant}} coaching position at Michigan, and Burton accepted. [...] Despite his {{strong ties to}} Miami, Burton recalled {{that he could not}} pass on the opportunity to coach at Michigan: [...] "I left Miami to coach at Michigan because of the challenge and an upward move in the profession." [...] Burton remained an assistant coach at Michigan for 22 years from 1970 to 1991. He began in 1970 as the coach of the freshman football team, coached receivers from 1972 to 1980 and then took over as the running backs coach from 1980 to 1992. [...] Burton was the position coach for All-American receivers Jim Smith and Anthony Carter and to running back Jamie Morris. [...] In 1990, Burton said that Morris was favorite Michigan player. Morris gave credit to Burton for his development: [...] "Tirrel was <b>everything</b> <b>to</b> <b>me.</b> He was like my father and mother. He always was in my corner. Bo would get on me, and he would take some of the blame for me. He handled each individual the way he needed to be handled." [...] Burton reported that coaching under Schembechler had been a huge honor: [...] "Bo Schembechler was a great coach. He was from the same mold as Ara ... Bo was demanding of his coaches and his players. I learned most of what I know about football from Bo." ...|$|E

2500|$|Working {{with some}} of Spain's best-known actresses {{including}} Carmen Maura, Victoria Abril, Marisa Paredes and Penélope Cruz, Almodóvar has become famous for his female-centric films, his [...] "sympathetic portrayals of women" [...] and his elevation of [...] "the humdrum spaces of overworked women". He was heavily influenced by classic Hollywood films in which everything happens around a female main character, and aims to continue in that tradition. Almodóvar has frequently spoken {{about how he was}} surrounded by powerful women in his childhood: [...] "Women were very happy, worked hard and always spoke. They handed me the first sensations and forged my character. The woman represented <b>everything</b> <b>to</b> <b>me,</b> the man was absent and represented authority. I never identified with the male figure: maternity inspires me more than paternity". His portrayal of women in his films have been admired by most critics, but some representations have led to accusations of misogyny. A critic from Popmatters wrote that what [...] "many of the women in Almodóvar's films do have in common, despite their characterization as victim or martyr or heroine, is that they are survivors", noting that Almodóvar is interested in depicting women overcoming tragedies and adversities and the power of close female relationships. Ryan Vlastelica [...] from AVClub wrote: [...] "Many of his characters track a Byzantine plot to a cathartic reunion, a meeting where all can be understood, if not forgiven. They seek redemption". Almodóvar stated that he does not usually write roles for specific actors, but after casting a film, he custom-tailors the characters to suit the actors; he believes his role as a director is a [...] "mirror for the actors - a mirror that can't lie".|$|E
