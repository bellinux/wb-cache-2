60|$|February 9,[Abbotsford].--A {{heavy and}} most <b>effective</b> <b>thaw</b> coming on I got home about five at night, {{and found the}} haugh covered with water, dogs, pigs, cows, {{to say nothing of}} human beings, all who slept at the offices in danger of being drowned. They came up to the mansion-house about midnight, with such various clamour, that Anne thought the house was {{attacked}} by Captain Swing and all the Radicals.|$|E
40|$|T HE {{repeated}} {{freezing and}} thawing {{of water in}} rock crevices and soil material is recognized as {{an important factor in}} mechanical weather-ing. The comparative importance of the process in northern and southern Canada has been examined in this preliminary study, which is not concerned with weathering under alpine conditions, and only indirectly with the role of freezing and thawing in the creation of patterned ground. Mechanical weathering is defined as the disintegration of rock in place, as opposed to chemical decomposition or to erosion, which requires a transporting agent. The freeze-thaw frequency at a particular station is the annual number of times the recorded temperature falls below the point of effective freeze following a period when the temperature was at or above the point of <b>effective</b> <b>thaw.</b> Scattered through the descriptive literature pertaining to arctic and subarctic regions are references (Tarr 1897, Eakin 1916, Jenness 1952, Bird 1955) to the widespread occurrence of frost-riven rock materials. rock deserts (felsenmeere), talus concentrations and comminuted erratics.

40|$|Microwave {{tempering}} {{experiments were}} conducted on frozen blocks of shrimp (FSB) {{and the results were}} used to help determine if microwave tempering of FSB is an improved thawing method over the current, traditional method, water immersion. Results of the microwave tempering experiments were also used to help determine which microwave tempering method amongst those explored by this study is most <b>effective.</b> Complete <b>thawing</b> of a FSB in a microwave oven was found to be impractical; however, using a combination of microwave tempering followed by water immersion can successfully thaw a FSB. After a microwave tempering experiment was conducted, the final stages of thawing were completed by using the traditional water immersion method. The amount of time to complete the thawing was recorded and {{is referred to as the}} additional thawing time. The amount of shrimp cooked during microwave tempering was also recorded and calculated as a percent. The additional thawing time and the percentage of shrimp cooked were used as criteria to compare microwave tempering experiments and also to compare microwave tempering experiments with the current method. The first set of microwave tempering experiments explored the advantages of freezing...|$|R
40|$|Glass waste, {{which is}} dumped {{around the world}} in huge amounts, {{can be used as a}} partial {{replacement}} of mineral aggregate in concrete industry. This would not only contribute to reducing pollution extent but also enhancing physical properties and durability of concrete. This article reports the mechanical performance of concrete with different replacement percentages of crushed glass waste of cement or fine aggregates before and after being subjected to standard cycles of freezing and thawing. Mechanical performance was evaluated in terms of compressive and flexural strengths. Furthermore, internal damage extent was evaluated using ultrasonic pulse velocity and dynamic modulus of elasticity. The results (average of six specimens for each test) revealed the feasibility of incorporating glass waste in concrete mixtures for the purpose of improving strength and durability; especially in environments where concrete is being exposed to an <b>effective</b> freezing and <b>thawing</b> cycles...|$|R
40|$|ABSTRACT Changes to the Beaufort Sea {{shoreline}} occur due to {{the impact}} of storms and rising relative sea level. During the open-water season (June to October), storm winds predominantly from the north-west generate waves and storm surges which are <b>effective</b> in eroding <b>thawing</b> ice-rich cliffs and causing overwash of gravel beaches. Climate change is expected to be enhanced in Arctic regions relative to the global mean and include accelerated sea-level rise, more frequent extreme storm winds, more frequent and extreme storm surge flooding, decreased sea-ice extent, more frequent and higher waves, and increased temperatures. We investigate historical records of wind speeds and directions, water levels, sea-ice extent and temperature to identify variability in past forcing and use the Canadian Global Coupled Model ensembles 1 and 2 (CGCM 1 and CGCM 2) climate modelling results to develop a scenario forcing future change of Beaufort Sea shorelines. This scenario and future return periods of peak storm wind speeds and water levels likely indicate increased forcing of coastal change during the next century resulting in increased rates of cliff erosion and beach migration, and more extreme flooding. RÉSUMÉ [Traduit par la rédaction] Des changements dans la ligne de rivage de la mer de Beaufort se produisent sous l’effet des tempêtes et de la hausse relative du niveau de la mer. Durant la saison d’eau libre (de juin à octobre), les vents des tempêtes, principalement du nord-ouest, produisent des vagues et des marées de tempêtes qui parviennent à éroder les falaises riches en glace fondante et à produire un ennoiement des plages de gravier...|$|R
