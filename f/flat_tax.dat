5|$|Senate Majority Leader Dole and Gingrich {{appointed}} Kemp {{to head a}} {{tax reform}} commission, (the Kemp Commission), in response to voter concern that the tax code had become too complicated. Kemp championed many issues including the <b>flat</b> <b>tax,</b> which he formally proposed after he was appointed. The proposal included some politically popular income tax deductions, such as mortgage interest, but it remained fairly general.

40|$|ISER Working Paper Series www. iser. essex. ac. ukNon-technical summary Two {{types of}} income taxes can be {{distinguished}} by the tax rate schedule: graduated rate <b>taxes</b> and <b>flat</b> rate <b>taxes.</b> While graduated rate taxes apply a different tax rate at different income levels, <b>flat</b> rate <b>taxes</b> apply a single tax rate to the whole income range. Until mid- 1990 s most {{of the countries in}} the world relied on graduated rate income <b>taxes</b> and <b>flat</b> income <b>tax</b> was used only in a few countries. Since then <b>flat</b> income <b>tax</b> has gained popularity, especially in Eastern Europe. Such reform proposals are also discussed in Western European countries, however, none of them has adopted it yet with the only exception of Iceland. While <b>flat</b> <b>taxes</b> are considered (among else) to improve peoples’ incentive to work, one may argue that they receive less political support in countries with well-established middle class due to their distributional effects. This paper tries to answer the question what would be the impact on income distribution, e. g. in terms of inequality and poverty, of implementing a <b>flat</b> income <b>tax</b> in Western European countries.

40|$|The paper formalizes the {{relation}} between <b>flat</b> <b>taxes</b> and growth {{when there is a}} competitive equilibrium tax evasion. A decentralized tax evasion service is supplied by the banking sector. The bank production function follows the financial intermediation microfoundation approach, with deposits as an input. Across a class of endogenous growth models, tax evasion decreases the effective tax rate, and thereby lessens the negative effect of taxes on growth. And as the tax rate rises, tax evasion causes the growth rate to fall by less. Underlying the results is a fiscal principle whereby tax evasion creates, or magnifies, a rising demand price sensitivity to higher tax rates.

5|$|Thomas Piketty, French {{economist}} {{and author of}} the bestselling book Capital in the Twenty-First Century regards taxes on capital as a more favorable option than austerity (inefficient and unjust) and inflation (only affects cash but neither real estates nor business capital). According to his analysis, a <b>flat</b> <b>tax</b> of 15 percent on private wealth would provide the state with nearly a year's worth national income, which would allow for immediate reimbursement of the entire public debt.|$|E
5|$|Other {{important}} legislation involved {{two measures}} to raise revenues for the Federal government: tariffs (a policy with long precedent), {{and a new}} Federal income tax. In 1861, Lincoln signed {{the second and third}} Morrill Tariff, the first having become law under James Buchanan. Also in 1861, Lincoln signed the Revenue Act of 1861, creating the first U.S. income tax. This created a <b>flat</b> <b>tax</b> of 3 percent on incomes above $800 ($ in current dollar terms), which was later changed by the Revenue Act of 1862 to a progressive rate structure.|$|E
5|$|During the campaign, Kemp's {{endorsement}} {{was highly}} coveted. Forbes {{had tried to}} get Kemp {{to run in the}} 1996 campaign, but Kemp declined and in fact endorsed Forbes just as Dole was closing in on the nomination, and just after Dole gained the endorsements of former contenders Lamar Alexander and Richard Lugar. Some feel the primary reason for the endorsement was to keep the <b>flat</b> <b>tax</b> idea and other supply-side views alive. Many thought Kemp had destroyed his own political future with the endorsement, and Kemp profusely apologized to Dole's campaign offices. After it became clear Dole would be the nominee, Kemp attempted to form a bipartisan seminar with Felix Rohatyn to produce a fiscal plan that could be endorsed by both parties.|$|E

25|$|A capped <b>flat</b> <b>tax</b> is one {{in which}} income is taxed at a flat rate until a {{specified}} cap amount is reached. For example, in 2014, the United States Federal Insurance Contributions Act tax is 6.2% of gross compensation up to a limit of $117,000 of gross compensation (resulting in a maximum Social Security tax of $7,254). This cap has the effect of turning a nominally <b>flat</b> <b>tax</b> into a regressive tax.|$|E

25|$|Where {{deductions}} are allowed, a 'flat tax' is {{a progressive}} tax {{with the special}} characteristic that, above the maximum deduction, the marginal rate on all further income is constant. Such a tax {{is said to be}} marginally flat above that point. The difference between a true <b>flat</b> <b>tax</b> and a marginally <b>flat</b> <b>tax</b> can be reconciled by recognizing that the latter simply excludes certain types of income from being defined as taxable income; hence, both kinds of tax are flat on taxable income.|$|E
2500|$|Modified <b>flat</b> <b>taxes</b> {{have been}} {{proposed}} which would allow deductions for a very few items, while still eliminating {{the vast majority of}} existing deductions. Charitable deductions and home mortgage interest are the most discussed examples of deductions that would be retained, as these deductions are popular with voters and are often used. Another common theme is [...] a single, large, fixed deduction. This large fixed deduction would compensate for the elimination of various existing deductions and would simplify taxes, having the side-effect that many (mostly low income) households will not have to file tax returns.|$|R
