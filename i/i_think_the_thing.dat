But with All or Descendents, it's basically these ugly dork people playing music. They thought they could market {{it because it was}} the right music, but the fact of it is that the music doesn't {{have anything to do with}} anything, really. We knew that.|$|E
500|$|The ninth {{season of}} the show was {{produced}} by Reveille Productions and Deedle-Dee Productions, both in association with Universal Television. The show {{is based on the}} British comedy series of the same name, which was created by Ricky Gervais and Stephen Merchant for the BBC. In addition, the two are executive producers on the show. On May 11, 2012, NBC renewed The Office for a ninth season. Series developer Greg Daniels returned as showrunner this season. Daniels stated that the season would feature more big season arcs, saying [...] "I'll tell you that the last couple of years, I don't think we did any big arc-type things in the way that we used to in the beginning, <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>the</b> <b>thing</b> we're going to do is bring back a lot of arcs."

[...] "New Guys" [...] was written and directed by Daniels. This is his first writing credit for the series since the seventh season entry, [...] "Goodbye, Michael", and his first directing credited since season seven's [...] "PDA". This also marks the third time he has both written and directed an episode, after the first season episode [...] "Basketball" [...] and the fourth season opener, [...] "Fun Run". Daniels later revealed that [...] "New Guys" [...] would be the inception of big season arcs. He went on the record saying [...] "I'll tell you that the last couple of years, I don't think we did any big arc-type things in the way that we used to in the beginning, <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>the</b> <b>thing</b> we're going to do is bring back a lot of arcs".

2500|$|After Oscar Wao, Diaz {{began work}} on a second novel, a science-fiction epic with the working title Monstro. Diaz had {{previously}} attempted to write a science fiction novel twice prior to Oscar Wao, with earlier efforts in the genre [...] "Shadow of the Adept, a far-future novel in the vein of Gene Wolfe's The Shadow of the Torturer, and Dark America, an Akira-inspired post-apocalyptic nightmare" [...] remaining incomplete and unpublished. Part {{of the appeal of}} science fiction to Diaz, he explained in an interview with Wired, is that science fiction grapples with the idea of power in a manner other genres do not: [...] "I didn't see mainstream, literary, realistic fiction talking about power, talking about dictatorship, talking about the consequences of breeding people, which of course is something that in the Caribbean is never far away." [...] In an interview with New York Magazine prior to the release of This Is How You Lose Her, Diaz revealed that the work-in-progress novel concerns [...] "a 14-year-old 'Dominican York' girl who saves the planet from a full-blown apocalypse". but he also warned that the novel may never be completed: [...] "I'm only at {{the first part of the}} novel, so I haven't really gotten down to the eating," [...] he says, [...] "and I've got to eat a couple cities before <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>the</b> <b>thing</b> will really get going." [...] As of June 2015, the novel-in-progress appears to be abandoned– in a June 2015 interview for Words on a Wire, when asked about his progress on Monstro, Diaz said [...] "Yeah, I'm not writing that book anymore..." [...] Diaz's next book, Islandborn, is to be a children's book, due for publication in March 2018.|$|E

60|$|Governor Shepley has {{informed}} me that Mr. Durant is now taking a registry, {{with a view to}} the election of a constitutional convention in Louisiana. This, to me, appears proper.

6000|$|I {{afterwards}} {{came to be}} Berry's fag, and, though {{beaten by}} him daily, he allowed, of course, {{no one else to}} lay a hand upon me, and I got no more thrashing than was good for me. Thus an intimacy grew up between us, and after he left Slaughter House and went into the dragoons, the honest fellow did not forget his old friend, but actually made his appearance one day in the playground in moustaches and a braided coat, and gave me a gold pencil-case and a couple of sovereigns. I blushed when I took them, but take them I did; and <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>the</b> <b>thing</b> I almost best recollect in my life, is the sight of Berry getting behind an immense bay cab-horse, which was held by a correct little groom, and was waiting near the school in Slaughter House Square.

60|$|<b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>the</b> <b>thing</b> that pleased me best at Dijon was {{the little}} old Parc, a charming public garden, {{about a mile from}} the town, to which I walked by a long, {{straight}} autumnal avenue. It is a jardin fran- cais of the last century, - a dear old place, with little blue-green perspectives and alleys and rondpoints, in which everything balances. I went there late in the afternoon, without meeting a creature, though I had hoped I should meet the President de Brosses. At the end of it was a little river that looked like a canal, and on the further bank was an old-fashioned villa, close to the water, with a little French garden of its own. On the hither side was a bench, on which I seated myself, lingering a good while; for this was just the sort of place I like. It was the furthermost point of my little tour. I thought that over, as I sat there, on the eve of taking the express to Paris; and as the light faded in the Parc the vision of some of the things I had seen became more distinct.|$|E
6000|$|... "My {{uncle was}} the spy who stole the papers," [...] replied Fisher, [...] "or {{who tried to}} steal the papers when I stopped him--in the only way I could. The papers, that should have gone west to reassure our friends {{and give them the}} plans for {{repelling}} the invasion, would in a few hours have been {{in the hands of the}} invader. What could I do? To have denounced one of our friends at this moment would have been to play into the hands of your friend Attwood, and all the party of panic and slavery. Besides, it may be that a man over forty has a subconscious desire to die as he has lived, and that I wanted, in a sense, to carry my secrets to the grave. Perhaps a hobby hardens with age; and my hobby has been silence. Perhaps I feel that I have killed my mother's brother, but I have saved my mother's name. Anyhow, I chose a time when I knew you were all asleep, and he was walking alone in the garden. I saw all the stone statues standing in the moonlight; and I myself was like one of those stone statues walking. In a voice that was not my own, I told him of his treason and demanded the papers; and when he refused, I forced him to take one of the two swords. The swords were among some specimens sent down here for the Prime Minister's inspection; he is a collector, you know; they were the only equal weapons I could find. To cut an ugly tale short, we fought there on the path in front of the Britannia statue; he was a man of great strength, but I had somewhat the advantage in skill. His sword grazed my forehead almost at the moment when mine sank into the joint in his neck. He fell against the statue, like Caesar against Pompey's, hanging on to the iron rail; his sword was already broken. When I saw the blood from that deadly wound, everything else went from me; I dropped my sword and ran as if to lift him up. As I bent toward him something happened too quick for me to follow. I do not know whether the iron bar was rotted with rust and came away in his hand, or whether he rent it out of the rock with his apelike strength; but the thing was in his hand, and with his dying energies he swung it over my head, as I knelt there unarmed beside him. I looked up wildly to avoid the blow, and saw above us the great bulk of Britannia leaning outward like the figurehead of a ship. The next instant I saw it was leaning an inch or two more than usual, and all the skies with their outstanding stars seemed to be leaning with it. For the third second it was as if the skies fell; and in the fourth I was standing in the quiet garden, looking down on that flat ruin of stone and bone at which you were looking to-day. He had plucked out the last prop that held up the British goddess, and she had fallen and crushed the traitor in her fall. I turned and darted for the coat which I knew to contain the package, ripped it up with my sword, and raced away up the garden path to where my motor bike was waiting on the road above. I had every reason for haste; but I fled without looking back at the statue and the body; and <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>the</b> <b>thing</b> I fled from was the sight of that appalling allegory.|$|E
6000|$|... "The Christian church {{knows no}} {{distinction}} of nations. In that church there is neither Greek nor Jew, Barbarian, Scythian, bond nor free, but all are one in Christ; and whatever affects {{one part of}} the body affects the other, and the whole Christian church every where is bound to help, and encourage, and rebuke, as the case may require. The Christian church is every where bound to its corresponding branch in every other country; and thus you have, not only a right, but it is your duty, to consider the case of the American slave with just the same interest with which you consider the cause of the native Hindoo, when you send out your missionaries there, or with which you consider Madagascar; and to express yourselves in a Christian spirit, and in a Christian way continually, till you see that your admonitions have had a suitable influence. I do not doubt what you say, that you will receive with great pleasure men who come from the United States to promote the cause of temperance, and you may have the opportunity of showing your sincerity before long; {{and the manner in which}} you receive them will have a very important bearing on the subject of slavery. [Cheers.] I have not the least doubt you will hail with joy those who will come across the Atlantic to advance and promote still more earnestly those noble institutions, the ragged schools and the ragged churches. [Cheers.] The men who want to do good at home are the men who do good abroad; and the same spirit of Christian liberality that leads you to feel for the American slave will lead you to care for your own poor, and those in adverse circumstances in your own land, I would ask, Is it possible, then, that admonition and reproof given in a Christian spirit, and by a Christian heart, can fail to produce a right influence on a Christian spirit and a Christian heart? <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>the</b> <b>thing</b> is utterly impossible; and that if such admonitions as are contained in the resolution, conceived in such a spirit, and so kindly expressed--if they are not received in a Christian spirit, it is because the Christian spirit has unhappily fled. I can answer for myself, at least, and many of my brethren, that it will be so; and, so far from desiring you to withhold your expressions on account of any bad feeling that they might excite, I wish you to reiterate them, and reiterate them in the same spirit in which they are given in this resolution; for I believe that these expressions of impatience and petulance represent the feelings of very few. Who is it that always speaks first? The angry man, and it comes out at once; but the wise man keeps it in till afterwards; and it will not be long before you will find, that whatever you say in a Christian spirit will be responded to on the other side of the water. Now, I believe our churches have neglected their duty on this subject, and are still neglecting it. Many do not seem to know what their duty is. Yet I believe them to be good, conscientious men, and men who will do their duty when they know what it is. Take, for example, the American Board of Foreign Missions. There are not better men, or more conscientious men, on the face of the earth, or men more sincerely desirous of doing their duty; yet, in some things, I believe they are mistaken. I think it would be better to throw over the very few churches connected with the Board which are slaveholding, than to endeavor to sustain them, and to have all this pressure of responsibility still upon them. But yet they are pursuing the course which they conscientiously think to be right. Christian admonition will not be lost upon them.[H] I will say the same of the American Home Missionary Society. They have little to do with slavery, as I have already remarked. Many think they ought not to say any thing upon the subject, because they cannot do so without weakening their influence. But then this question comes: If good men do not speak, who will?--[Hear, hear!]--and, as our Savior said in regard to the children that shouted, Hosannah, 'If these should hold their peace, the stones would immediately cry out.' It is in consequence of their silence that stones have begun to cry out, and they rebuke the silence and apathy of good men; and this is made an argument against religion, which has had effect with unthinking people; so I think it absolutely necessary that men in the church, on that very ground, should speak out their mind on this great subject at whatever risk--[cheers]--and they must take the consequences. In due time God will prosper the right, and in due time the fetters will fall from every slave, and the black man will have the same privileges as the white. [Applause.]" ...|$|E
