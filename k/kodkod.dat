Remains of Irenomys have been found in owl pellets of the great horned owl (Bubo virginianus), rufous-legged owl (Strix rufipes), and barn owl (Tyto alba); other potential predators include another owl, the Austral pygmy-owl (Glaucidium nanum), and the South American gray fox (Pseudalopex griseus), Darwin's fox (Pseudalopex fulvipes) and <b>Kodkod</b> (Leopardus guigna).|$|E
50|$|The <b>kodkod</b> was {{formerly}} considered {{a member of}} the genus Oncifelis, which consisted of three small feline species native to South America. All of these species have been moved into the genus Leopardus. Along with the <b>kodkod,</b> the former members of Oncifelis were the colocolo and Geoffroy's cat.|$|E
50|$|Genetic {{studies have}} shown that Geoffroy's cat is most closely related to the <b>kodkod.</b> At times it has been placed in the {{separate}} genus Oncifelis, together with the <b>kodkod</b> and colocolo, but it is now more commonly placed in Leopardus, a larger genus of small South American cats, which also includes the ocelot.|$|E
50|$|Male <b>kodkods</b> {{maintain}} exclusive territories 1.1 to 2.5 km2 in size, while females occupy smaller {{ranges of}} just 0.5 to 0.7 km2.|$|R
50|$|This trail {{lies on the}} {{south-western}} edge of Puyehue National Park in Los Lagos Region. It runs {{between two}} small lakes, Toro Lake and Paraiso Lake, {{and on to the}} 1,500 meter Cerro Sarnoso mountain. It is possible to view wildlife including pudús, <b>kodkods</b> and long-nosed caenolestids, as well as the native Valdivian rainforest.|$|R
50|$|The coat has a base color {{ranging from}} brownish-yellow to grey-brown. The body is {{decorated}} with dark spots, with a pale underside and a ringed tail. The ears are black with a white spot, while the dark spots on the shoulders and neck almost merge to form a series of dotted streaks. Melanistic <b>kodkods</b> with spotted black coats are quite common.|$|R
5000|$|The IUCN {{has only}} rated the [...] "combined" [...] species (including Pantanal and Pampas cats), {{in which case}} the {{colocolo}} is considered Near Threatened. Whether the colocolo will receive a higher rating if the Pantanal and Pampas cats are treated as separate species is unclear, but it may be Endangered, and its range is smaller than that of the <b>kodkod,</b> rated as Vulnerable by the IUCN. However, unlike the <b>kodkod,</b> the colocolo is not associated with the highly threatened temperate rainforests found in the region.|$|E
50|$|Some of the {{endangered}} fauna {{that can be seen}} in the Las Vertientes nature reserve includes: Monito del monte (Dromiciops gliroides), Southern pudú, Puma (Puma concolor), <b>Kodkod</b> (Leopardus guigna), and the Magellanic Woodpecker.|$|E
50|$|Like {{most other}} small cats, the {{colocolo}} was formerly {{included in the}} genus Felis, but together with Geoffroy's cat and the <b>kodkod,</b> some have placed it in Oncifelisinstead. Today, all major authorities place it in Leopardus.|$|E
50|$|Popular Conguillío National Park {{is located}} {{approximately}} 70 km {{east of the}} city of Temuco and this trail runs 54 km round Llaima Volcano north from the Salto de Truful Truful waterfall to the Laguna Captren lake. It is possible to see a wide variety of wildlife in the park, including pumas, South American grey foxes, culpeos, lesser grisons, <b>kodkods,</b> pudús, viscachas and coypos. Birds living in the area include eagles, condors and Magellanic woodpeckers.|$|R
50|$|<b>Kodkods</b> are {{strongly}} associated with mixed temperate rainforests of the southern Andean and coastal ranges, particularly the Valdivian and Araucaria forests of Chile, which {{is characterized by the}} presence of bamboo in the understory. They prefer evergreen temperate rainforest habitats to deciduous temperate moist forests, sclerophyllous scrub and coniferous forests. They are tolerant of altered habitats, being found in secondary forest and shrub as well as primary forest, and on the fringes of settled and cultivated areas.|$|R
50|$|<b>Kodkods</b> {{are equally}} active {{during the day}} as during the night, {{although}} they only venture into open terrain {{under the cover of}} darkness. During the day, they rest in dense vegetation in ravines, along streams with heavy cover, and in piles of dead gorse. They are excellent climbers, and easily able to climb trees more than a meter in diameter. They are terrestrial predators of birds, lizards and rodents in the ravines and forested areas, feeding on southern lapwing, austral thrush, chucao tapaculo, huet-huet, domestic geese and chicken.|$|R
50|$|In 2011 ZooBorns {{released}} ZooBorns Cats!, which showcased kitten and cub {{photos of}} 30 {{species of the}} 36 known feline species, including rare photos of the critically endangered Iriomote cat and vulnerable <b>kodkod,</b> {{also known as the}} guiña.|$|E
50|$|The {{park has}} about 25 mammal species, {{including}} native {{as well as}} exotic species. Among them are the cougar, <b>kodkod,</b> lesser grison, chilla fox, American mink, coypu, pudú and Chilean huemul. The park is home to 18 threatened species.|$|E
50|$|The local mammals in {{the area}} are mainly pumas, culpeos, chillas, the quique (kind of weasel) and the <b>kodkod</b> (wild cat). The bird species found in the park goes from a large {{varieties}} of ducks, condors, traros, eagles, and wood pigeon.|$|E
50|$|The <b>kodkod</b> {{has a small}} head, large feet, and a thick tail. Typical adult {{length is}} 37 to 51 cm, with a short 20 to 25 cm tail and a {{shoulder}} height of about 25 cm. Weight ranges between 2 to 2.5 kg.|$|E
50|$|Mammal species {{found in}} the park include the cougar (Puma concolor), coypu (Myocastor coypus, river rat or nutria), the South American gray fox (Lycalopex griseus), the <b>kodkod</b> or güiña (Leopardus guigna). Frog Alsodes igneus is found only in Tolhuaca National Park, its type locality).|$|E
50|$|The western {{mountains}} {{are home to}} animals including the llama, guanaco and vicuña which {{are among the most}} recognizable species of South America. Also in this region are the fox, viscacha, Andean mountain cat, <b>kodkod,</b> and the largest flying bird in the New World, the Andean condor.|$|E
50|$|The {{major threat}} to the <b>kodkod</b> is logging of its {{temperate}} moist forest habitat, {{and the spread of}} pine forest plantations and agriculture, particularly in central Chile. In 1997 to 1998, two out of five radio-collared kodkods were killed on Chiloé Island while raiding chicken coops.|$|E
50|$|Mammals {{present in}} the Valdivian forest include an {{arboreal}} marsupial, the monito del monte (Dromiciops gliroides), the world's smallest deer, the southern pudú (Pudu pudu), and South America's smallest cat, the <b>kodkod</b> (Leopardus guigna). The giant snail (Macrocyclis peruvianus), with a shell length of 6.5 cm, is also found here.|$|E
50|$|Felinine is {{excreted}} by selected Felidae species including bobcats, Chinese desert cats, the <b>kodkod,</b> {{and domestic}} cats. Felinine synthesis {{occurs in the}} liver through a condensation reaction of glutathione and isopentenyl pyrophosphate to form 3-mercaptobutanolglutathionine (3-MBG). In the kidney 3-MBG is hydrolysed and felinine partly acetylated. Cauxin assists in the hydrolysis of the dipeptide (felinylglycine) to increase the concentration of urinary felinine.Urine of domestic cats may contain a series of felinine-containing compounds including free felinine, acetylfelinine, felinylglycine and 3-MBG.|$|E
50|$|Some of the {{threatened}} mammals of the Valdivian forests include the monito del monte (Dromiciops gliroides), an arboreal marsupial, the southern pudú (Pudu pudu) the world's smallest deer, and the <b>kodkod</b> (Leopardus guigna), South America's smallest cat. Since {{the beginning of}} the 20th century, there have also been nonnative wild boars living in the Valdivian forests. Hummingbirds are common on Valdivian forests {{because of the presence of}} plants like the maqui (Aristotelia chilensis) and the copihue.|$|E

Remains of Irenomys have been found in owl pellets of the great horned owl (Bubo virginianus), rufous-legged owl (Strix rufipes), and barn owl (Tyto alba); other potential predators include another owl, the Austral pygmy-owl (Glaucidium nanum), and the South American gray fox (Pseudalopex griseus), Darwin's fox (Pseudalopex fulvipes) and <b>Kodkod</b> (Leopardus guigna).|$|E
5000|$|The <b>kodkod</b> (Leopardus guigna) (...) , {{also called}} güiña, is the {{smallest}} cat in the Americas. It lives primarily in central and southern Chile and marginally in adjoining areas of Argentina. Its area of distribution is small {{compared to the other}} South American cats. Since 2002, it has been listed as Vulnerable on the IUCN Red List as the total effective population may comprise less than 10,000 mature individuals, and is threatened due to persecution and loss of habitat and prey base.|$|E
50|$|In the {{southern}} {{portion of the}} park (Queulat mountain pass), wildlife includes mammals such as pudú, <b>kodkod,</b> {{and a variety of}} birds species including chucao tapaculo, Chilean pigeon, Magellanic woodpecker, black-throated huet-huet and thorn-tailed rayadito. The northern sections of the park are home to nearshore wildlife including semi-aquatic mammals as are southern river otter and coypu. Birds found in this area include Magellan goose, Chiloe wigeon, yellow-billed pintail, red shoveler, flying steamer duck, rosy-billed pochard, red-gartered coot, ringed kingfisher, great egret, cocoi heron, black-crowned night heron, torrent duck, sedge wren, Chilean flicker and black-necked swan.|$|E
50|$|Through version 3.0, the Alloy Analyzer {{incorporated}} {{an integral}} SAT-based model-finder {{based on an}} off-the-shelf SAT-solver. However, as of version 4.0 the Analyzer makes use of the <b>Kodkod</b> model-finder, for which the Analyzer acts as a front-end. Both model-finders essentially translate a model expressed in relational logic into a corresponding boolean logic formula, and then invoke an off-the-shelf SAT-solver on the boolean formula. In {{the event that the}} solver finds a solution, the result is translated back into a corresponding binding of constants to variables in the relational logic model.|$|E
50|$|Leopardus is a genus of spotted small cats mostly {{native to}} Middle and South America. Very few range into the {{southern}} United States. The genus {{is considered the}} oldest branch of {{the part of the}} cat family to cross into the Americas, followed by the genera Lynx and Puma. (The jaguar is the other extant cat native to the Americas.) The largest species in Leopardus is the ocelot; most of the other species resemble domestic housecats in size, with the <b>kodkod</b> (L. guigna) being the smallest cat in the Americas. The margay (L. wiedii) is more highly adapted to arboreal life than any other cat in the Americas.|$|E
50|$|About 30 {{species of}} mammals {{live in the}} Park. These species are shy and {{difficult}} to observe. This Park and the geographically contiguous Puyehue, Nahuel Huapi and Lanin parks provide habitat to the puma, Puma concolor. The local sub-species is relatively small, usually not more than 30 or 40 kg, and preys on pudu Pudu puda, a tiny deer of solitary and reclusive forest habitat. Huiña, <b>kodkod,</b> Leopardus guigna, often mistaken for a stocky, short wild cat, is actually {{a member of the}} family of the leopards, a tiny ocelot. Of the group of the Canidae, the dogs, the Park is inhabited by chilla, Pseudalopex griseus, an animal that looks like a small fox but is not actually a fox.|$|E
40|$|Abstract. <b>Kodkod,</b> the backend of Alloy 4, {{incorporates}} {{new features}} for solving models where {{part of the}} solution, that is, a partial instance, is already known. Although <b>Kodkod</b> has had this functionality for some time, it is not explicitly available to the modeller through the Alloy lan-guage syntax. We propose an extension to the Alloy language to make partial instances explicitly available to the Alloy user. Explicit partial instances are helpful for the Alloy user {{in a number of}} capacities, includ-ing test-driven development, regression testing, modelling by example, and combined modelling and meta-modelling. The proposed syntax also gives the modeller explicit access to the performance benefits of Kodkod’s partial instance features. ...|$|E
40|$|The {{generality}} of Alloy's relational {{logic and}} the full automation of its analysis have prompted several attempts to use Alloy as a backend engine for other tools. However, these e#orts have been hampered by the Alloy Analyzer's lack of 1) a clean API, 2) support for partial instances, and 3) a mechanism for sharing subformulas and subexpressions. Designed expressly as a plugin component, the <b>Kodkod</b> relational engine overcomes these limitations. Unlike the Analyzer, <b>Kodkod</b> provides a simple interface for constructing and analyzing Alloy formulas; it accepts user-provided partial instances of these formulas; and it employs a robust scheme for exploiting shared formulas and expressions...|$|E
40|$|Abstract. Languages like UML and OCL {{are used}} to {{precisely}} model systems. Complex UML and OCL models therefore represent {{a crucial part of}} model-driven development, as they formally specify the main system properties. Consequently, creating complete and correct models is a critical concern. For this purpose, we provide a lightweight model validation method based on efficient SAT solving techniques. In this paper, we present a transformation from UML class diagram and OCL concepts into relational logic. Relational logic in turn represents the source for advanced SAT-based model instance finders like <b>Kodkod.</b> This paper focuses on a natural transformation approach which aims to exploit the features of relational logic as directly as possible through straitening the handling of main UML and OCL features. This approach allows us to explicitly benefit from the efficient handling of relational logic in <b>Kodkod</b> and to interpret found results backwards in terms of UML and OCL. ...|$|E

40|$|The <b>kodkod</b> (Leopardus guigna) {{is one of}} {{the least}} known {{endangered}} felid species. In order to find an adequate anaesthetic association to handle safely <b>kodkod</b> individuals during ecological studies and veterinary procedures, we onducted 10 chemical immobilizations in 7 animals using a combination of ketamine hydrochloride (KH) and xylazine hydrochloride (XH) at the Laguna San Rafael National Park (Chile). A mean (±SE) dosage of 15. 4 ± 3. 2 mg/kg KH and 1. 7 ± 0. 3 mg/kg XH resulted in mean induction time of 4. 6 ± 2. 9 min and a mean recovery time of 63. 9 ± 31. 9 min. There was a direct relationship between KH dosage and the duration of the immobilization, with the combination of drugs leading to a shorterinduction time. No secondary effects were observed. Based on our preliminary results, we recommended dosages of 11 - 12 mg/kg KH and 1. 6 - 1. 7 mg/kg XH...|$|E
40|$|Nitpick is a {{counterexample}} generator for Isabelle/HOL {{that builds}} on <b>Kodkod,</b> a SAT-based firstorder relational model finder. Nitpick supports unbounded quantification, (co) inductive predicates and datatypes, and (co) recursive functions.

Our experimental results on Isabelle theories and the TPTP library indicate that Nitpick generates more counterexamples than other model finders for higher-order logic, without {{restrictions on the}} form of the formulas to falsify. ...|$|E
40|$|Abstract. SAT based {{analysis}} of code consists on providing an appropriate translation of code to a SAT problem, {{and using a}} SAT solver to analyze properties of the source program. This process can be improved if bounds for relations modeling class fields are introduced ala <b>KodKod.</b> In this article we present a distributed algorithm for automated inference of tight field bounds. From a technical point of view, the algorithm relies on a novel symmetry breaking predicate for program heaps. We present experimental results that support our claims. ...|$|E
40|$|There {{is a large}} {{conceptual}} {{gap between}} end-to-end infrastructure requirements and detailed component configuration implementing those requirements. Today, this gap is manually bridged so large numbers of configuration errors are made. Their adverse effects on infrastructure security, availability, and cost of ownership are well documented. This paper presents ConfigAssure to help automatically bridge the above gap. It proposes solutions to four fundamental problems: specification, configuration synthesis, configuration error diagnosis, and configuration error repair. Central to ConfigAssure is a Requirement Solver. It takes as input a configuration database containing variables, and a requirement as a first-order logic constraint in finite domains. The Solver tries to compute as output, values for variables that make the requirement true of the database when instantiated with these values. If unable to do so, it computes a proof of unsolvability. The Requirement Solver is used in different ways to solve the above problems. The Requirement Solver is implemented with <b>Kodkod,</b> a SAT-based model finder for first-order logic. While any requirement can be directly encoded in <b>Kodkod,</b> parts of it can often be solved much more efficiently by non model-finding methods using information available in the configuration database. Solving these parts and simplifying can yield a reduced constraint that truly requires the power of modelfinding...|$|E
