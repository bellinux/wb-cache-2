500|$|Early cricketers {{played in}} their {{everyday}} clothes and had no protective equipment such as gloves or pads. A 1743 painting of a game in progress at the Artillery Ground depicts two batsmen and a bowler dressed alike in white shirt, breeches, white <b>knee-length</b> <b>stockings</b> and shoes with buckles. The wicket-keeper wears the same clothes {{with the addition of}} a waistcoat. An umpire and scorer wear three-quarter length coats and tricorn hats. Apart from the shirts and stockings, none of the clothes are white and no one wears pads or gloves. The ball is bowled underarm along the ground, as in bowls, at varying speed towards a wicket consisting of two stumps mounted by a single crosspiece. The batsman addresses the delivery with a bat that resembles a modern hockey stick, this shape being ideal for dealing with a ball on the ground. The modern straight bat evolved in the 1760s after bowlers began to [...] "give the ball air" [...] by pitching it. As a result, [...] "the game changed completely and evolved from its pioneering phase into what may be termed its pre-modern phase".|$|E
2500|$|The Norfolk jacket {{remained}} fashionable {{for shooting}} and rugged outdoor pursuits. It {{was made of}} sturdy tweed or similar fabric and featured paired box pleats over the chest and back, with a fabric belt. [...] Worn with matching breeches or (U.S. knickerbockers), it became the Norfolk suit, suitable for bicycling or golf with <b>knee-length</b> <b>stockings</b> and low shoes, or for hunting with sturdy boots or shoes with leather gaiters.|$|E

40|$|Venous ulcers {{are related}} to {{incompetence}} of the direct calf and ankle perforating veins, the majority of which follow deep vein thrombosis. Prevention of the latter by intravenous micro-dose heparin (1 unit/kg/hour) is effective, safe and inexpensive. Its efficacy has been proved in two controlled clinical trials. Venous ulcers have been treated by perforating vein ligation, with saphenous ligation and stripping where necessary, and {{with the addition of}} permanent <b>knee-length</b> elastic compression <b>stockings</b> in patients with femoro-popliteal incompetence. This regimen has achieved a 92 % long-term success rate in patients without rheumatoid arthritis...|$|R
2500|$|In {{the early}} 19th century, during the Regency {{of the future}} King George IV, the blue suit was revolutionised by a courtier named George Beau Brummel. Brummel created a suit that closely fitted the human form. [...] The new style had a long tail coat cut to fit the body and long tight {{trousers}} to replace the <b>knee-length</b> breeches and <b>stockings</b> of the previous century. He used plain colours, such as blue and grey, to concentrate attention on {{the form of the}} body, not the clothes. Brummel observed, [...] "If people turn to look at you in the street, you are not well dressed." [...] This fashion was adopted by the Prince Regent, then by London society and the upper classes. [...] Originally the coat and trousers were different colours, but in the 19th century the suit of a single colour became fashionable. By the late 19th century the black suit had become the uniform of businessmen in England and America. In the 20th century, the black suit was largely replaced by the dark blue or grey suit.|$|R
5000|$|In late 1971 music {{industry}} publicist Rodney Bingenheimer moved to London after becoming {{fed up with}} the American {{music industry}}. While in England he saw the birth of the glam rock movement and David Bowie suggested Bingenheimer open a glam club in Los Angeles. In October 1972 he and his record producer partner Tom Ayers opened the E Club at 8171 Sunset Boulevard, which is nearby the Chateau Marmont Hotel. In late December they moved the club further down the strip to 7561 Sunset Boulevard with the new name, Rodney Bingenheimer’s English Disco. Kim Fowley later recalled, [...] "The English Disco was more a public-toilet version of the E Club. The new location gave it the teenage stench it needed. Everybody had great hair and great make-up, and there were Lolita girls everywhere. People worked at it." [...] It soon became the center of the new glitter rock movement in Los Angeles. Bowie's biography noted, [...] "The crowd at the club ranged in age from twelve to fifteen... nymphet groupies were stars in their tight little world. Some dressed like Shirley Temple; others wore dominatrix outfits or 'Hollywood underwear,' a <b>knee-length</b> shirt, nylon <b>stockings,</b> and garter belts. These stargirls streaked their hair chartreuse and like to lift their skirts to display their bare crotches. As they danced they mimed fellatio and cunnilingus in tribute to David's onstage act of fellatio on Ronno's guitar." ...|$|R
50|$|Shoes, socks, {{and other}} {{accessories}} are sometimes included {{as part of}} the uniform. The socks are typically navy or white. The shoes are typically brown or black penny loafers. Although not part of the prescribed uniform, alternate forms of legwear (such as loose socks, <b>knee-length</b> <b>stockings,</b> or similar) are commonly matched by more fashionable girls with their sailor outfits.|$|E
5000|$|Jacqueline Hyde (Alaine Kashian) - Jacqueline Hyde is a split personality, one ("Jacqueline") being sweet-tempered and {{innocent}} {{with the other}} ("Hyde") being vindictive and insane. She repeatedly alternates between her personalities, with each surfacing for a few seconds. She wears a red blazer, a pink blouse, a red miniskirt and <b>knee-length</b> <b>stockings,</b> perhaps to suggest a traditional schoolgirl uniform of the early-to-mid-20th century. Her getaway was becoming a sphere and floating from sight. In the first season, she assaulted the Chronoskimmer by throwing an orb of electricity; whereas in the second season, she physically sabotaged the craft at an open maintenance panel. Her name is an obvious play on [...] "Dr. Jeykll & Mr. Hyde".|$|E
50|$|In central Bosnia {{however, the}} Ottoman {{influence}} is more prominently shown. For women, the dress is mainly white heavy cotton with puckered vertical stripes, while the collar is embroidered with a crocheted trim and dotted with sequins. The vest is generally dark in color {{with a golden}} trim embroidered along the edges, and the apron is made of wool, dyed usually red, black, or dark green with minimal designs. If no apron is worn, than the dress may consist of special embroidery and crocheted lace, and pantaloons (gače) are worn with white, <b>knee-length</b> <b>stockings</b> (čarape). The sash (tkanica) worn around the waist is black with green and gold wool handwoven within. The headscarf can be a kerchief (krpa) with various geometric designs and/or floral embroidery, or more elaborate kind (čember) with a crocheted edge with a wide band of multi-colored geometric embroidery {{on one side and}} half of opposite side.|$|E

40|$|In a room richly {{decorated}} with autumnal colours and Chinese patterns, two women stand in line. One is blonde and more mature than her smaller red-haired colleague. Both have lifted their chemises to reveal naked buttocks and thighs and black <b>knee-length</b> <b>stockings.</b> The blonde has {{a look of}} resignation. Her eyes are downcast and her dress gathered in front to preserve what remains of her dignity. Her younger colleague seems more assertive. With her bright red hair, rouged cheeks and chemise hoisted high, she approaches her assignation with some boldness. A third women in a turquoise kimono (probably another colleague) walks away from them towards {{a group of people}} below a large window through which can be seen a clock tower (perhaps a church or the nearby Bib-liotèque Nationale) ...|$|E
40|$|Four girl scouts are parading on Beyazıt meydanı {{in front}} of Darülfünun (İstanbul Üniversitesi). Their uniform {{consists}} of a blouse, skirt, <b>knee-length</b> <b>stockings,</b> scout tie, belt and scout hat worn tipped back on the neck. They are gravely carrying musical instruments: the girl marching ahead with a trumpet has a sash with the motto ‘Ameli Hayat’ (practical life)  across her chest, the three following her carry small drums hanging from leather straps strung over their shoulders. In the background, more participants of the parade are lined up {{in front of}} Darülfünun (İstanbul Üniversitesi), which is decorated with a Turkish flag at the main entrance. The parade most likely took place on the occasion of Cumhuriyet bayramı. With the exception of 1934, when the parade was restricted to Taksim Square, the participants would gather and line {{up in front of}} Darülfünun (İstanbul Üniversitesi) before starting the parade on Beyazıt meydanı. The motto ‘Ameli Hayat’ on the sash indicates that the scouts were affiliated with the school of that name. With the exception of 1934 and 1938, when the official parade was restricted to Taksim Square, the parade in Istanbul during the twenties and thirties followed a well-established scheme: The parading soldiers and students would gather and form up in front of Darülfünun (İstanbul Üniversitesi), thereafter starting the parade on Beyazıt meydanı at around 11 a. m. The parade would then set out to Hagia Sophia, cross Galata Bridge and finally reach Taksim Square via İstiklal Caddesi...|$|E
40|$|Background: In a {{university}} hospital, disparate and unsatisfactory thromboprophylaxis in surgical patients was found. No hospital consensus {{was in place}} for the prevention of postoperative deep vein thrombosis (DVT). Literature review suggested low molecular weight heparin (LMWH) and anti-embolic stockings were the best prophylaxis, however the optimal length of stocking was unknown. Method: Audit of thromboprophylaxis in surgical patients and surgical doctors was performed. A randomised controlled trial investigated the efficacy and safety of a new single protocol of LMWH and the best length of stocking, for every patient requiring surgery under general anaesthesia. Of 426 patients interviewed, 376 were randomised into three stocking groups, Medi Thrombexin® Climax™ thigh-length, Thrombexin® Climax™ knee-length and Kendall TEDTM thigh-length. All patients received LMWH. DVT incidence was assessed by duplex ultrasonography. Complications of thromboprophylaxis were recorded. Compliance and health outcome measures were developed to assess patient stocking acceptability. Results: Audit revealed inadequate surgical thromboprophylaxis. A simple 'single protocol' improved doctors' thromboprophylaxis compliance on replicate audit. The randomised trial assessing the 'single protocol' showed no postoperative DVT occurred in the low or moderate-risk patients (n= 85). Twenty-one DVT occurred in nineteen patients, all were high-risk patients (n= 291) : two with Thrombexin® Climax™ thigh-length stockings and eleven with Thrombexin® Climax™ kneelength (p<O. 05). Six patients wearing TEDTM thigh-length stockings developed DVT. Groups were similar for age, gender, thromboembolic risk, surgical type and protocol compliance. One significant bleeding complication occurred. A validated health outcome measure showed patient satisfaction with <b>knee-length</b> <b>stockings</b> was significantly greater than with thigh-length. However, stocking compliance for in-patients was equal. Whereas patients' compliance with knee-length was significantly greater after hospital discharge. Conclusion: A single protocol employing LMWH and thigh-length stockings abolished DVT (diagnosed by duplex) in low and moderate-risk patients and reduced DVT to 2 % in high-risk patients. The 'Blanket LMWH-thigh-length stocking protocol' was effective, safe and the length of stocking proved significant. A new single protocol and hospital consensus to prevent postoperative DVT was achieved. EThOS - Electronic Theses Online ServiceGBUnited Kingdo...|$|E
