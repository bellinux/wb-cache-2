5|$|Eon again {{turned to}} Richard Maibaum for the script, {{although}} Paul Dehn was later introduced for rewrites. After missing From Russia with Love, Ken Adam returned as production designer. Adam's imagination provided {{the idea of}} gold stacked upon gold behind iron bars for the scenes in the United States Bullion Depository. Saltzman disliked the design's resemblance to a prison, but Hamilton liked <b>it</b> <b>enough</b> that it was built.|$|E
5|$|Most high-energy particles, beside {{displacing}} carbon atom {{from the}} lattice site, also pass <b>it</b> <b>enough</b> surplus energy for a rapid migration through the lattice. However, when relatively gentle gamma irradiation is used, this {{extra energy is}} minimal. Thus the interstitials remain near the original vacancies and form vacancy-interstitials pairs identified through optical absorption.|$|E
5|$|After the film's mainly {{negative}} reviews Akshay Kumar {{lashed out}} at critics, accusing them of lacking {{an understanding of the}} audience and the basic ideas of filmmaking. There were rumours about a feud between Kumar and Ekta Kapoor about the former's distancing himself from the project and not promoting <b>it</b> <b>enough.</b> The three leads attended the inaugural 2013 Indian Premier League match between Kolkata Knight Riders and Delhi Daredevils to promote the film, but the match organisers asked their cameramen not to focus on the actors. After this, a disappointed Kumar asked Kapoor to re-arrange the film's marketing schedule.|$|E

5|$|Artist and {{inventor}} Bill Lishman created two sculptures {{for this}} section of the park, as well as some smaller works for application to the buildings. The most prominent is a dragon {{at the entrance to the}} Dragon Fire, which had originally been intended to hold a sign, but the park management decided they liked <b>it</b> <b>enough</b> for it to be a standalone sculpture. Lishman was allowed to design it from scratch, as opposed to follow preset designs established before he was hired, taking him and assistant Richard Van Heuvelan two months to complete. The other main sculpture was the wild boar at Wild Beast, both this and the dragon being built at his home in Blackstock, Ontario, for about $75,000. Signs by Lishman included Sherwood Florist, Boo Boo's Buggys, an ice cream cone, and for a popcorn counter.|$|E
5|$|Quentin Tarantino {{had been}} working at Video Archives, a video store in Manhattan Beach, California, and {{originally}} planned to shoot the film with his friends on a budget of $30,000 in a 16mm black-and-white format, with producer Lawrence Bender playing a police officer chasing Mr. Pink. Bender gave the script to his acting teacher, whose wife gave the script to Harvey Keitel. Keitel liked <b>it</b> <b>enough</b> to sign as a co-producer so Tarantino and Bender would have an easier job finding funding; with his assistance, they raised $1.5 million. Keitel also paid for Tarantino and Bender to host casting sessions in New York, where the duo found Steve Buscemi, Michael Madsen, and Tim Roth.|$|E
5|$|The SABRE engine design aims {{to avoid}} the {{historic}} weight-performance issue by {{using some of the}} liquid hydrogen fuel to cool helium within a closed-cycle precooler, which quickly reduces the temperature of the air at the inlet. The air is then used for combustion in a similar manner to a conventional jet engine; once the helium has left the pre-cooler, it is further heated by the products of the pre-burner, giving <b>it</b> <b>enough</b> energy to drive the turbine and the liquid hydrogen pump. As a consequence of the air being cooled at all speeds, the jet can be built of light alloys and the weight is roughly halved. Additionally, more fuel can be burnt at high speeds. Beyond Mach5.5, the air would normally become unusably hot despite the cooling; accordingly, the air inlet is closed upon attaining this speed and the engine instead is solely fed via on-board liquid oxygen and hydrogen fuel, as in a traditional rocket.|$|E

50|$|In February 2017, Čabraja {{and two of}} her {{parliamentary}} colleagues {{left the}} <b>It's</b> <b>Enough</b> - Restart group and started a new organization called the Civic Platform. In making her decision, Čabraja said that <b>It's</b> <b>Enough</b> - Restart did not deal well with dissenting opinions. The new group supported Saša Janković's bid for the Serbian presidency in the 2017 election, and its three representatives currently sit in caucus with two other parliamentarians as an Independent MPs parliamentary group.|$|R
5|$|The group goes to IBF {{in search}} for a cure, but starts showing signs of Tief Blau. An {{exception}} is Tsugumi, as the Cure virus has made her immune; the group injects themselves with her antibodies. They get contact with the surface, and a rescue pod is sent down, but is only able {{to stay for a}} short period of time. Tsugumi disappears to find Chami, who has gone missing; Takeshi chases after her, and saves Sora's data onto a disk, to save her memories. Returning to IBF, they have missed the rescue vessel. They find a submarine and escape, but its batteries die; Takeshi exits it, giving <b>it</b> <b>enough</b> buoyancy to save Tsugumi, while he dies on the ocean floor. Coco dies in IBF, as she had been looking for Pipi, and the rescue team could not find her.|$|E
5|$|There is {{evidence}} that humans who participate in bushmeat activities, either as hunters or as bushmeat vendors, commonly acquire SIV. However, SIV is a weak virus, and it is typically suppressed by the human immune system within weeks of infection. It is thought that several transmissions of the virus from individual to individual in quick succession are necessary to allow <b>it</b> <b>enough</b> time to mutate into HIV. Furthermore, due to its relatively low person-to-person transmission rate, it can only spread throughout {{the population in the}} presence of one or more high-risk transmission channels, which are thought to have been absent in Africa prior to the 20th century.|$|E

25|$|The {{argument}} that unionized workers raise their own wages above their natural rate {{at the expense}} of their businesses or other workers assumes that unions never raise productivity to compensate for higher wages. Unions are capable of raising productivity by reducing turnover, by increasing coordination between workers and management, and by increasing workers' motivation. Many unions raise the productivity of their workers, and some even raise <b>it</b> <b>enough</b> to make up for wage increases.|$|E

25|$|Amritsar — At 17:45 hrs, four Mirages {{flying from}} Sargodha {{and led by}} Wing Commander Hakimullah {{attacked}} Amritsar AB. Hakimullah's flight was armed with two 500kg bombs each, which the strike used efficiently hitting the first 300m of the runway and cratering <b>it</b> <b>enough</b> to leave it nonoperational for several hours. However, the Amritsar runway was repaired within the same night to receive detachments of Mig 21s and Su-7 that flew against Rafiqui AB the next morning. A second strike of two F-104 Starfighters, led by Wing Commander Amjad H Khan hit the P-35 radar station at Amritsar, rendering it inoperational for nearly an hour. Two Sukhois then took off from the one remaining serviceable lane of the runway, moments before it was bombed by a passing B-57.|$|E
25|$|As {{the village}} {{continued}} to change governments, {{the social and}} economic trends affecting downtown continued. All three bank buildings eventually became vacant. The preeminence of automobiles and roads took a direct toll on the district when a widening of Route 9 cost 217 Main Street several of its bays. It was rebuilt with its overall appearance retained, but the project cost <b>it</b> <b>enough</b> of its historic character that it could no longer be considered contributing when the district, originally called the Main Street Crescent Historic District, was created in 1989. Many businesses that closed or moved out were replaced by new ones, particularly restaurants, that catered to a growing Latin immigrant population that had settled in the neighborhoods nearby. The designation of the aqueduct as a state historic park and creation of a trailway along the route in 1983 was also a positive development for downtown. In 1988 its upper portion was reopened to provide some of the village's northern neighborhoods with water.|$|E
25|$|The launch {{from the}} {{submarine}} occurs below the sea surface. The missiles are ejected from their tubes by igniting an explosive charge {{in a separate}} container which is separated by seventeen titanium alloy pinnacles activated by a double alloy steam system. The energy from the blast is directed to a water tank, where the water is flash-vaporized to steam. The subsequent pressure spike {{is strong enough to}} eject the missile out of the tube and give <b>it</b> <b>enough</b> momentum to reach and clear the surface of the water. The missile is pressurized with nitrogen to prevent the intrusion of water into any internal spaces, which could damage the missile or add weight, destabilizing the missile. Should the missile fail to breach the surface of the water, there are several safety mechanisms that can either deactivate the missile before launch or guide the missile through an additional phase of launch. Inertial motion sensors are activated upon launch, and when the sensors detect downward acceleration after being blown out of the water, the first-stage motor ignites. The aerospike, a telescoping outward extension that halves aerodynamic drag, is then deployed, and the boost phase begins. When the third-stage motor fires, within two minutes of launch, the missile is traveling faster than 20,000ft/s (6,000m/s), or 13,600mph (21,600km/h).|$|E
