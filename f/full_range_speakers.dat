50|$|The {{approximately}} logarithmic {{relationship between}} power and perceived loudness {{is an important}} factor in audio system design. Both amplifier power and speaker sensitivity affect the maximum realizable loudness. Standard measurement practice of speaker sensitivity is driving 1 watt electrical power to the source, with the receiver 1 meter away from the source, and measuring the resulting acoustical power in dB relative to the threshold of hearing (defined as 0 dB). Sensitivity is typically measured either suspended in an anechoic chamber in 'free space' (for <b>full</b> <b>range</b> <b>speakers),</b> or with the source and receiver outside on the ground in 'half space' (for a subwoofer).|$|E
50|$|During the 4 {{days of the}} Festival, several seminars, workshops, shootouts {{and musical}} {{performances}} are organised. A flee market for audio gear and typically a sizable selection of vinyl is open at all times. Previous seminar speakers have included people like Jean Hiraga, Morgan Jones, Lynn Olson, Per Lundahl (Lundahl Transformers), Brian Sowter (Sowter Transformers of England), Steve Bench, Guido Tent (Tentlabs), Allen Wright (VSE), Peter van Willenswaard of Stereophile magazine, Pieter Treurniet (Tribute Transformers) and John Broskie (GlassWare and Tube CAD Journal). Previous workshops have included subjects such as power supplies (shunt/series/passive/regulated), the sound of distortion, noise and hum, speaker crossovers and digital jitter. Audio gear listening competitions are held for items such as phono stages, <b>full</b> <b>range</b> <b>speakers,</b> single-ended triode amplifiers and output transformers. ETFs have been reviewed in several magazines, including Revue du Son, MJ, TNT Audio, 6Moons and Prestige Audio Video. A recurring item with each Festival is a Special Guest that is {{invited to join the}} Festival and hold a presentation about a high-end audio subject of their own choice.Another highlight is the annual ETF auction, with proceeds going into the fund that sponsors the next event. Items auctioned are voluntary donations of vintage gear and curio brought by the attendees.|$|E

5000|$|Keyboardists {{who want}} {{powerful}} low end may use a powered subwoofer cabinet {{designed for use}} in a PA system. Some keyboard combo amps have a [...] "sub out" [...] jack, so that the amp can be plugged into an external powered subwoofer cabinet for extra bass. Subwoofers can only produce deep bass frequencies up to about 150 or 200 Hz, so a subwoofer cabinet must be paired with a <b>full</b> <b>range</b> <b>speaker</b> to obtain the <b>full</b> tonal <b>range</b> of an electric piano or organ. Keyboard players who use subwoofers for on-stage monitoring include electric organ players who use bass pedal keyboards (which go down to a low [...] "C" [...] which is about 33 Hz) and synth bass players who play rumbling sub-bass parts that go as low as 18 Hz. Of all of the keyboard instruments that are amplified onstage, synthesizers can produce some of the lowest pitches, because unlike a traditional electric piano or electric organ, which have as their lowest notes a low [...] "A" [...] and a low [...] "C", respectively, a synth does not have a fixed lowest octave. A synth player can add lower octaves to a patch by pressing an [...] "octave down" [...] button, which can produce pitches that are at the limits of human hearing.|$|R
5000|$|Many {{manufacturers}} abbreviate {{the number}} and size of speakers {{in the name of}} their equipment. For example, a Fender bass combo amp with two 10" [...] speakers may be called the [...] "Fender 210". Similarly, a Fender cabinet with two 12" [...] speakers may be called the [...] "Fender 212". Another abbreviation that is used is to add the wattage to the name. Thus a 500 watt Yamaha combo amp with two 12" [...] speakers may be called the [...] "Yamaha 212-500". Bassists who want a more powerful low end may use a subwoofer cabinet. Subwoofers are specialized for very low frequency reproduction, with typical maximum useful high frequencies of about 150 or 200 Hz, so a subwoofer cabinet must be paired with a <b>full</b> <b>range</b> <b>speaker</b> cabinet to obtain the <b>full</b> tonal <b>range</b> of an electric bass or upright bass. In addition, subwoofers intended for PA system use have much higher power handling requirements than do subwoofer designs for high fidelity home use. Bass guitar players who use subwoofer cabinets include performers who play with extended range basses with include notes between B0 (about 31 Hz); and C#0 (17 Hz) and bassists whose style requires a very powerful sub-bass response {{is an important part of}} the sound (e.g., funk, Latin, gospel, R & B, etc.).|$|R
5|$|Another of {{the early}} subwoofers was {{developed}} during the late 1960s by Ken Kreisel, {{the former president of}} the Miller & Kreisel Sound Corporation in Los Angeles. When Kreisel's business partner, Jonas Miller, who owned a high-end audio store in Los Angeles, told Kreisel that some purchasers of the store's high-end electrostatic speakers had complained about a lack of bass response in the electrostatics, Kreisel designed a powered woofer that would reproduce only those frequencies that were too low for the electrostatic speakers to convey. Infinity's <b>full</b> <b>range</b> electrostatic <b>speaker</b> system that was developed during the 1960s also used a woofer to cover the lower frequency range that its electrostatic arrays did not handle adequately.|$|R

40|$|The {{construction}} of discourse is a challenging field where many discourse structures and interactional effects remain poorly understood. This analysis provides a systematic {{explanation for the}} way in which discourse participants (speaker and hearer) are construed in Spanish through a corpus-driven analysis of informal conversation, TV-debates and parliamentary debates. It deals not only with person deixis, but with the <b>full</b> <b>range</b> of possibilities <b>speakers</b> choose from when profiling their self or their relationship with the interlocutor. This analysis also offers new insights into the operationalization of the concepts of subjectivity and intersubjectivity as tools for the analysis of person reference and genre comparison. The comparative and corpus-driven approach offers methodological tools for genre analysis that can be transposed to other languages and/or genres. The detailed description of three socially highly relevant discourse types from a cognitive-functional perspective makes this book a useful resource not only for pragmatists but also for researchers in political and media discourse...|$|R
50|$|Another early {{subwoofer}} enclosure {{made for}} home and studio use was the separate bass speaker for the Servo Statik 1 by New Technology Enterprises. Designed as a prototype in 1966 by physicist Arnold Nudell and airline pilot Cary Christie in Nudell's garage, it used a second winding around a custom Cerwin Vega 18-inch (45 cm) driver to provide servo control {{information to the}} amplifier, and it was offered for sale at $1795, some 40% more expensive than any other complete loudspeaker listed at Stereo Review. In 1968, the two found outside investors and reorganized as Infinity. The subwoofer was reviewed positively in Stereophile magazine's winter 1968 issue as the SS-1 by Infinity. The SS-1 was reviewed very highly in 1970 by High Fidelity magazine.Another of the early subwoofers was developed during the late 1960s by Ken Kreisel, {{the former president of}} the Miller & Kreisel Sound Corporation in Los Angeles. When Kreisel's business partner, Jonas Miller, who owned a high-end audio store in Los Angeles, told Kreisel that some purchasers of the store's high-end electrostatic speakers had complained about a lack of bass response in the electrostatics, Kreisel designed a powered woofer that would reproduce only those frequencies that were too low for the electrostatic speakers to convey.

40|$|The {{comparative}} correlative or CC construction 1 {{refers to}} sentences {{of the type}} which are expressed in English as The more we eat, the fatter we get. In Swedish these occur most commonly as correlations of the degree adverbs ju and desto. In English such sentences have been noted for their apparently idiosyncratic syntactic properties (Fillmore 1987, McCawley 1988, Culicover and Jackendoff 1999). This study of the Swedish comparative correlative is based on corpus data from the online Språkbanken corpus available through the University of Göteborg and extends the existing body of cross-linguistic knowledge about the CC construction. Recent studies have either focused on English exclusively or have not considered Swedish. Den Dikken's 2005 cross-linguistic study of the CC includes data on close relatives of English in the Germanic family such as Dutch and German, but only mentions Swedish in a footnote. The Swedish CC is a robust construction occurring in both written and spoken Swedish. There is variation among speakers, with some using a ju [...] . ju [...] . combination and others preferring ju [...] . desto [...] These two forms may also occur {{together in the same}} text. Corpus data makes it possible to present the <b>full</b> <b>range</b> of <b>speaker</b> variation {{in the form of the}} Swedish CC. While most work on comparative correlatives limits discussion to a basic biclausal type of CC, this study establishes the existence of multiclausal CC structures in Swedish. It also demonstrates that the ju [...] . ju [...] . form has a long history and is not merely part of the informal spoken language register, as prescriptive grammars have claimed. 1...|$|R

5000|$|Critics of <b>full</b> <b>range</b> drivers cite their {{inability}} to reproduce the <b>full</b> <b>range</b> of audio frequencies at similar amplitudes, leading to inaccurate reproduction of the audio signal sent to it. Reproducing multiple frequencies with the same diaphragm causes intermodulation distortion, a non-linear effect that occurs when one surface attempts to reproduce both frequencies simultaneously. The audible severity of modest intermodulation distortion is not well established. The result is a degree of [...] "frequency mixing", albeit at a relatively low level. A <b>full</b> <b>range</b> driver may have reduced output {{at both ends of}} its frequency range, or a more severely limited frequency response, resulting in a more compromised sound. Partisans of full-range loudspeakers claim superior phase coherence, while some critics describe them as midrange speakers working at or beyond their limits. Some <b>full</b> <b>range</b> drivers have been developed using 12" [...] and 15" [...] drivers, e.g. Audio Nirvana, and have overcome the bass limitations of smaller drivers using bass reflex cabinets. Also, as most adults cannot hear above 15 kHz the lack of high end frequency is generally not an issue with modern well designed <b>full</b> <b>range</b> drivers.|$|R
