5|$|The TSR-2 {{was to be}} {{powered by}} two Bristol-Siddeley Olympus reheated turbojets, {{advanced}} variants of those used in the Avro Vulcan. The Olympus would be further developed and would power the supersonic Concorde. The design featured a small shoulder-mounted delta wing with down-turned tips, an all-moving swept tailplane and a large all-moving fin. Blown flaps were fitted across the entire trailing edge of the wing to achieve the short takeoff and landing requirement, something that later designs would achieve with the technically more complex swing-wing approach. No ailerons were fitted, control in roll instead being implemented by <b>differential</b> <b>movement</b> of the slab tailplanes. The wing loading was high for its time, enabling the aircraft to fly at very high speed and low level with great stability without being constantly upset by thermals and other ground-related weather phenomena. The EE Chief Test Pilot, Wing Commander Roland Beamont, favourably compared the TSR-2's supersonic flying characteristics to the Canberra's own subsonic flight characteristics, stating that the Canberra was more troublesome.|$|E
25|$|A {{major issue}} in {{whiplash}} prevention {{is the lack of}} proper adjustment of the seat safety system by both drivers and passengers. Studies have shown that a well designed and adjusted head restraint could prevent potentially injurious head-neck kinematics in rear-end collisions by limiting the <b>differential</b> <b>movement</b> of the head and torso. The primary function of a head restraint is to minimize the relative rearward movement {{of the head and neck}} during rear impact. During a rear-end collision, the presence of an effective head restraint behind the occupant’s head can limit the <b>differential</b> <b>movement</b> of the head and torso. A properly placed head restraint where one can sufficiently protect his/her head lower the chances of head injury by up to 35% during a rear-end collision.|$|E

2500|$|A severe {{earthquake}} is {{more likely}} to disable the offshore causeway portions of Interstate Highway 80 (the Eastshore Freeway), since it is built on fill placed in the 1930s atop mudflats whose upper layers were deposited in the 19th century as a result of extensive hydraulic gold mining in the distant Sierra Nevada mountain foothills. This soft mud is expected to amplify earthquake shaking, and the mud supporting the heavy fill may liquefy, and so possibly cause major disruption of the highway due to failure by sinking of the highway and by <b>differential</b> <b>movement</b> of large sections. (More modern construction for these conditions employs linked and [...] "floating" [...] – in mud – lightweight concrete and plastic foam box structures to support a road.) Similar conditions underlie the eastern approach roads to the Bay Bridge. Better, but still locally poor soils underlie the portion of Interstate Highway 880 that extends to the South Bay region from the eastern terminus of the San Francisco–Oakland Bay Bridge. As the bulk of cargo containers from the Port of Oakland travel on these two roads, the disabling of both would cause severe disruption of West Coast import and export goods, owing to the consequent overloading of other West Coast container handling ports.|$|E

40|$|Seismic {{design of}} {{structures}} with long dimensions {{located at the}} ground surface such as bridges, pipelines, are usually controlled by strains and <b>differential</b> <b>movements</b> caused by body and surface waves generated by earthquakes. Based on the observed strong motion array data, in particular the SMART-l array, a theoretical model is developed to estimate the ground strains and <b>differential</b> <b>movements.</b> · With the use of conversion factors by which structural strains are derived from ground strains, methods for assessing the potential damage and safety of a lifeline system under strong ground shaking during an earthquake are studied. A cross-spectrum model for surface waves is developed based on the SMART-l data. Numerical evaluation of parameters shows the attenuation {{is less important than}} the loss of coherence as waves propagate from the source to the. site. The dynamic response (deterministic as well as stochastic) of structures subject to spatial seismic waves is also studied. The contribution of both in-phase and out-of-phase input motions to the response of an extended structure (such as a lifeline) is calculated. The sensitivity of lifeline longitudinal response to change in epicenter direction was also examined. The root-mean-square response is evaluated for the purpose of reliability assessment.
