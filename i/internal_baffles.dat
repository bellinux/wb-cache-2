25|$|The {{water or}} {{retardant}} is carried in three center-line belly tanks. The tanks have <b>internal</b> <b>baffles</b> to prevent fluid shift (and consequent shift {{in center of}} gravity) while in flight, and sit with a 15-inch (38cm) ground clearance. All three tanks can be filled simultaneously {{on the ground in}} eight minutes. The retardant is gravity-fed out of the tanks, and the entire load can be dumped in eight seconds, although the actual drop rate is computer controlled by the flight crew in order to produce the desired retardant spread over the fire lines. The aircraft is capable of applying a line of retardant 300ft (91m) wide by 1 mile (1.6km) long.|$|E
25|$|One popular {{configuration}} for {{the mixing}} tube {{is a large}} bore tube {{with a series of}} <b>internal</b> <b>baffles</b> which create turbulence in the mixture after the injection point, which causes fairly rapid mixing to a homogenous mixture, which may then be continuously analysed by a monitoring instrument before further processing, or may be directly processed and analysed later from the storage cylinder. Continuous analysis allows adjustment of flow rate of the added gases to correct the mixture if it deviates from the specification. Post-analysis makes correction more difficult. Addition of components may be done in sequence or together. Adding them together means that mixing is done once, and this reduces the pressure loss in the intake system. It is important that the gases are thoroughly mixed before analysis as the analysis will then be more reliable. It is also highly desirable to ensure that the intake gases do not vary significantly in oxygen content over time for safety reasons, as the compressor will probably only be safe for a limited oxygen fraction.|$|E
2500|$|The Weteye {{bomb was}} {{developed}} for the United States Navy during the early 1960s. The US Navy at China Lake, California attempted to develop a massive chemical bomb with a high fill efficiency (~70%).

50|$|Dice towers {{have been}} used {{since at least the}} fourth century. The Vettweiss-Froitzheim Dice Tower is a {{surviving}} example, used by Romans in Germany and has essentially the same design as modern examples with <b>internal</b> <b>baffles</b> to force the dice to rotate more randomly.|$|E
50|$|The brick-built {{setting was}} {{replaced}} with a box-like steel housing, lined with firebrick. The water-tube diameter was reduced to between 2 and 2½ inches (51-64 mm). To avoid problems with the water levels shifting as the ship rolls, the water drums were arranged crosswise to the hull and provided with <b>internal</b> <b>baffles.</b>|$|E
50|$|The {{tower was}} used in the removal of tar and ammonia from raw coal gas. Gas was piped into the base of the tower, from where it rose to the top via a series of <b>internal</b> <b>baffles</b> over which water was sprayed from a header tank {{at the top of the}} tower, {{stripping}} the gas of coal tar and ammonia in the process. The liquid was drained via a water seal at the bottom, and sold as ammonia liquor.|$|E
5000|$|The Streamer has {{a double}} surface wing covered in Dacron sailcloth. The Hazard 12S 9.8 m span wing has {{supporting}} struts and uses an [...] "A" [...] frame weight-shift control bar.

25|$|The Yarrow {{superheater}} {{consisted of}} hairpin tubes, {{parallel to the}} existing steam generator tubes. One bank of the generator tubes was separated in two, with individual lower water drums for them. The superheater {{was placed in the}} gap formed between these, with both ends of its tubes connected to a single superheater header drum, and an <b>internal</b> <b>baffle</b> to separate wet and dry steam.|$|R
50|$|Vacuum Type is {{the most}} common form of degasser. It can be horizontal, {{vertical}} or round vessel. A vacuum action is created to pull in the gas cut mud. When the liquid enters the tank it will flow and be distributed to a layer of <b>internal</b> <b>baffle</b> plates designed for the mud to flow in thin laminar film and is exposed to a vacuum that forces the gas to escape and break out of the mud.The vacuum pump moves the escaping gas from the vessel discharging it to the rig's flare or environmental control system.|$|R
5000|$|The M49 fuel tanker and M50 {{water tanker}} {{variants}} were initially {{based on the}} M44 chassis. The M49C series, however, were vehicles converted from C series drop-side cargo variants. M49's have 1200-gallon tanks. Early models had triple compartments (200g front, 400g mid, baffled 600g rear), but most models have two 600-gallon baffled tanks. The M50 had a [...] water tank, of which later variants had <b>internal</b> <b>baffles</b> to combat weight transfer during motion. In some areas the M35 is still used today as a wildland firefighting truck with a portable water supply and fully operational pump.|$|E
5000|$|The [...] {{overhead}} cam engine had a redline of 9000 rpm and contrasted sharply from the low-revving European and American bikes of the day. Running straight pipes with small <b>internal</b> <b>baffles,</b> CL77s featured a loud and very distinct sound from the 180 degree firing order of this parallel twin. Many of these motorcycles featured aftermarket snuff-or-nots (commonly misspoken as [...] "snuffer nuts"), which featured a flat washer like piece of metal which pivoted just inside {{the tips of the}} exhaust pipes to quiet or increase the sound of the motor at any time during operation simply by twisting the external knob.|$|E
50|$|The XM177 uses {{a unique}} flash {{suppressor}} sometimes called a flash or sound moderator for its 10 in barrel. This device is 4.2 in long and was designed {{primarily as a}} counterbalance measure as the shorter barrel makes the weapon unwieldy. This device reduces flash signature greatly and sound signature slightly, making the normally louder short barreled carbine sound like a longer barreled M16A1. Although it has no <b>internal</b> <b>baffles</b> and does not completely reduce the sound signature to subsonic levels, because it alters the sound level of the weapon, the US Bureau of Alcohol Tobacco Firearms and Explosives has declared this muzzle device to be a sound suppressor and regulates its civilian purchase in the United States.|$|E
5000|$|Trixon also {{pioneered the}} {{development}} of fiberglass drum shells, introducing the [...] "Jet" [...] series in 1968. These single-headed drums featured an <b>internal</b> parabolic <b>baffle</b> which radiated the sound through concentric openings.|$|R

Results demonstrate 1) an <b>internal</b> <b>baffle</b> provides a modest improvement in the rate at which stored heat is extracted from a tank with an immersed heat exchanger, 2) for polyolefins (a low cost commodity polymer) the mechanical performance and lifetime will depend on the rate at which antioxidants are lost to the surrounding potable water and 3) scale formation on polymer tubes is 30 % less than that on copper tubes after 2 months exposure to flowing tap water...|$|R
50|$|The {{original}} method from Hocus Pocus Junior was {{a single}} large barrel that is modified with <b>internal</b> <b>baffles</b> to create three sections. A single spigot {{on one of the}} flat ends of the barrel is extended with three pipes, one leading into each of the different partitions. The flow is controlled through a bunghole on the top that is likewise modified to run to three hoses, one into each partition. By turning the stopper in the bunghole to uncover one of the pipes, air can flow into the selected partition. When the spigot is opened, only the liquid from the selected partition can flow out, the partial vacuum in the other chambers prevents the flow.|$|E

5000|$|A {{loudspeaker}} enclosure or loudspeaker cabinet is an enclosure (often box-shaped) in which speaker drivers (e.g., loudspeakers and tweeters) and associated electronic hardware, such as crossover circuits and, in some cases, power amplifiers, are mounted. Enclosures may range in design from simple, homemade DIY rectangular particleboard boxes to very complex, expensive computer-designed hi-fi cabinets that incorporate composite materials, <b>internal</b> <b>baffles,</b> horns, bass reflex ports and acoustic insulation. Loudspeaker enclosures {{range in size}} from small [...] "bookshelf" [...] speaker cabinets with 4" [...] woofers and small tweeters designed for listening to music with a hi-fi system in a private home to huge, heavy subwoofer enclosures with multiple 18" [...] or even 21" [...] speakers in huge enclosures which are designed for use in stadium concert sound reinforcement systems for rock music concerts.|$|E
5000|$|A single {{partially}} filled {{tank that}} extends across the full {{breadth of the}} vessel. Its shape, size and <b>internal</b> <b>baffles</b> allow the liquid inside to slosh {{from side to side}} in response to the roll motion of the ship. The phasing of the roll moments acting on the ship and the resultant liquid motion will be such that it reduces the roll motion. This type of tank was first investigated by William Froude, but did not receive much attention until the 1950s when it was revived and used in many naval vessels. They have the added advantage {{that it is possible to}} vary tank natural frequency by changes in water level and thus accommodate changes in ships metacentric height. Free surface tanks are commonly referred to as [...] "flume" [...] tanks.|$|E
40|$|A Computational Fluid Dynamics (CFD) {{prediction}} {{procedure for}} computing the internal hydrodynamic behaviour of final clarifiers is presented. Calculations {{are carried out}} and presented for comparison with experimental measurements of point velocities in a shallow circular clarifier in operation at a UK waste water treatment works. The calculations compare favourably with the data and the model has subsequently been used for many design studies. A separate study is described where CFD predictions are used to investigate the influence of introducing energy dissipating influents (EDI), varying the stilling well diameter, adding Stamford baffles at the side wall or placing an influent floor baffle (McKinney baffle) below the stilling well. From the study {{it is possible to}} determine the sizes and combinations of <b>internal</b> <b>baffling</b> likely to give the best clarification performance across a range of operating conditions. The success of the optimum design is judged by the depth of the settling sludge bed and the magnitude of the effluent suspended solids (ESS) for the state points considered...|$|R
40|$|An {{artificial}} source of stable, hemispherical illumination {{has been developed}} to facilitate the collection of reflectance factor measurements of targets of interest in a laboratory environment. The light source consists of a 76 cm (30 in.) aluminum hemisphere which has been coated internally with barium sulfate paint. Illumination is provided by two banks of lamps, each consisting of eight 62 -W quartz halogen bulbs which have tungsten filaments. An <b>internal</b> <b>baffle</b> precludes the viewing of any direct beam of light. A simple metal structure has been developed to hold the hemisphere and all peripheral equipment, such as spectrometers, radiometers, and cameras, in place during data collection. The entire setup can be easily disassembled and packed in airline approved shipping cases to facilitate transportation to remote laboratory facilities. This illumination system has been used {{during the past three}} years to collect spectral reflectance factor data of tree branch samples and seedlings in support of an on-going study to investigate the effect of acidic deposition on forest vegetation...|$|R
40|$|The Advanced Neutron Source (ANS), in its {{conceptual}} design phase at Oak Ridge National Laboratory, {{was to be}} a user-oriented neutron research facility producing the most intense steady-state flux of thermal and cold neutrons in the world. Among its many scientific applications, the production of cold neutrons was a significant research mission for the ANS. The cold neutrons come from two independent cold sources positioned near the reactor core. Contained by an aluminum alloy vessel, each cold source is a 410 -mm-diam sphere of liquid deuterium that functions both as a neutron moderator and a cryogenic coolant. With nuclear heating of the containment vessel and <b>internal</b> <b>baffling,</b> steady-state operation requires close control of the liquid deuterium flow near the vessel`s inner surface. Preliminary thermal-hydraulic analyses supporting the cold source design were performed with heat conduction simulations of the vessel walls and multidimensional computational fluid dynamics simulations of the liquid deuterium flow and heat transfer. This report presents the starting phase of a challenging program and describes the cold source {{conceptual design}}, the thermal-hydraulic feasibility studies of the containment vessel, and the future computational and experimental studies that were planned to verify the final design...|$|R
50|$|To {{compensate}} for any wind, new evacuation slides contain <b>internal</b> <b>baffles,</b> which cause the ends nearest the aircraft to inflate first, which are constructed {{to come out}} like four elbows and press against the fuselage of the aircraft to the forward and aft sides of the exit door. There are also half-tie restraints which keep the inflating slide from drooping or blowing under the aircraft. These restraints are constructed {{so that when the}} slide becomes fairly rigid, around 1.5 - 2.0 psi, they detach very quickly (there are usually two), and since the header tubes are already against the fuselage, the slide pops almost horizontally out from the door, then drops relatively gently to the ground. Tests in 25 kn cross winds have shown these deployment systems to be very effective.|$|E
50|$|There exist {{two main}} passive control types for satellites. The first one uses gravity gradient, and {{it leads to}} four stable states with the long axis (axis with {{smallest}} moment of inertia) pointing towards Earth. As this system has four stable states, if the satellite has a preferred orientation, e.g. a camera pointed at the planet, some way to flip the satellite and its tether end-for-end is needed. The other passive system orients the satellite along Earth's magnetic field thanks to a magnet. These purely passive attitude control systems have limited pointing accuracy, because the spacecraft will oscillate around energy minima. This drawback is overcome by adding damper, which can be hysteretic materials or a viscous damper. The viscous damper is a small can or tank of fluid mounted in the spacecraft, possibly with <b>internal</b> <b>baffles</b> to increase internal friction. Friction within the damper will gradually convert oscillation energy into heat dissipated within the viscous damper.|$|E

50|$|The 508 mm {{diameter}} telescope tube {{is made of}} {{graphite fiber}}/cyanate ester in two sections. The outer graphite fiber layup is designed to minimize the longitudinal coefficient of thermal expansion, whereas the inner composite tube is lined internally with an aluminum foil vapor barrier to guard against outgassing of water vapor or epoxy contaminants into the telescope interior. The telescope has a forward tube which encloses the mirrors and supports the door assembly and star trackers, and an aft tube which supports the focal plane camera and <b>internal</b> optical <b>baffles.</b>|$|R
2500|$|Other {{directional}} {{patterns are}} produced by enclosing {{one side of the}} ribbon in an acoustic trap or baffle, allowing sound to reach only one side. The classic RCA Type 77-DX microphone has several externally adjustable positions of the <b>internal</b> <b>baffle,</b> allowing the selection of several response patterns ranging from [...] "figure-eight" [...] to [...] "unidirectional". Such older ribbon microphones, some of which still provide high quality sound reproduction, were once valued for this reason, but a good low-frequency response could be obtained only when the ribbon was suspended very loosely, which made them relatively fragile. Modern ribbon materials, including new nanomaterials have now been introduced that eliminate those concerns, and even improve the effective dynamic range of ribbon microphones at low frequencies. Protective wind screens can reduce the danger of damaging a vintage ribbon, and also reduce plosive artifacts in the recording. Properly designed wind screens produce negligible treble attenuation. In common with other classes of dynamic microphone, ribbon microphones don't require phantom power; in fact, this voltage can damage some older ribbon microphones. Some new modern ribbon microphone designs incorporate a preamplifier and, therefore, do require phantom power, and circuits of modern passive ribbon microphones, i.e., those without the aforementioned preamplifier, are specifically designed to resist damage to the ribbon and transformer by phantom power. Also there are new ribbon materials available that are immune to wind blasts and phantom power.|$|R
