Similar rights are afforded to EU Residents, who gain protection under European Directive 97/7/EC.

40|$|The {{mail order}} {{business}} was once a traditional method of selling and distributing clothes, and other commodities, to customers. Now, the e-commerce trend, with more sophisticated techniques of marketing, selling, and distributing goods, has not only challenged the traditional mail order system, it seems also that the traditional retail chain and even fashion chains are being challenged. This change not only affects how sellers compete (be they long-distance or not), it has probably affected us as consumers - our requirements and how we purchase. This work contributes to this development through extensive empirical investigations into how and why customers return what they have previously ordered. The primary conclusions are that consumer requirements tend to vary, and therefore the standard solution of delivering goods to a vast variety of consumers without engaging in discussion about the individual customer service requirements (et cetera) is most probably the central cause behind the increasing return trends seen in the business. The purpose of this thesis is to identify and to characterise important factors causing returns. Further, to assist the development of Returns Management research, the intention {{is to develop a}} theoretical model of a Supply/Demand Chain returns system that incorporates an application of avoidance and gatekeeping in a <b>distance</b> <b>sale</b> context with the aim to improve overall systems performance. The research design used in the thesis was a case study performed at one of the largest mail order organisation in Sweden, with a long tradition in the business. The main data used in the thesis has been collected from interviews, a questionnaire, and secondary data exported from the case organisation. Sales and returns data covering approximately one year of sales and returns in the Swedish market was quantitatively analysed, and the results were regularly discussed and presented to key informants at the case organisation to substantiate authenticity and trustworthiness. The overall conclusion is that the distance-sales trade is affected by the trends that are seen in other areas, namely increased competition - not only from within the distance trade but also from the traditional retail trade. This is probably due to the ease of shopping via e-commerce, and the vast supply of products that even exceeds that of the retail chains. This attracts new customer groups with new demands and requirements. This, in many ways, is an archetypal difference between today’s e-commerce business and yesterday’s {{mail order business}}, and could explain why customers from the different channels behave and return differently. The use of the Internet affects how we purchase, and therefore the result of the purchase. It is quite likely that we are far more spontaneous when purchasing over the Internet in comparison with telephone and mail orders.

30|$|During the {{sampling}} process we first identified potential participating companies, before identifying interviewees from these companies. We used theoretical sampling in four steps until we reached preliminary theoretical saturation {{with regard to}} insights from additional interviews (Glaser and Strauss 1967). The target retailers had to fulfill four criteria: (1) OC retailers, (2) operating in non-food retailing, (3) with significant experience in the business (i.e., at least one year in distance retailing via an online shop and at least five years in bricks-and-mortar business), and (4) of a significant size in terms of sales and number of outlets (i.e., at least EUR 200 m. annual sales and at least ten outlets in German-speaking countries). The scope of the investigation covers OC retailers only. Retailers {{are referred to as}} belonging to OC retailing if they have a <b>distance</b> <b>sales</b> channel as well as bricks-and-mortar outlets. Furthermore, the retailers had to have been active at least for one year in both channels. OC retailing is more advanced among non-food retailers (see e.g., PwC 2013). To get a broad understanding and avoid looking only at product-specific phenomena, we invited non-food retailers across multiple sectors, namely fashion, consumer electronics, DIY, and specialty retailers. The challenges for integrating on- and offline distribution concepts are especially relevant for large retailers with established distribution networks and economies of scale in this area. The company sample was, therefore, derived based on the latest industry rankings of official statistical data, which use annual sales as a criterion.|$|E

They include details about textile production in large workshops, and in the domestic sphere. This contribution focuses on the private textile production at Aššur during the 19 th century BCE, (Old Assyrian period). Old Assyrian levels have not been excavated at Aššur, so we lack texts and archaeological remains for this city. To reconstruct the textile production there, we rely on the hundreds of letters sent by the Assyrian women to their family members in Anatolia, especially at Kültepe, the ancient city of Kaneš. There, excavations also provided textile tools. The textile production of the Aššur women had two goals: clothing household members, and fueling the long <b>distance</b> trade.

You might be worried about the latest trends, delivery modalities, the newest technologies… But you might also attach importance {{to the impact of}} your purchase on the environment or to the labour conditions of the workers that have manufactured your new gadget. Some of you may know how it feels when you realize that your favourite brand has 'betrayed' you because their production methods are not that 'ecological' or human rights-friendly. Thus, a fundamental question that arises is: how can European (EU) consumer contract law protect the legitimate expectations of the ethical consumer in a digital era? Firstly, {{it is important to note}} that the EU has set the objective for a 'green and circular economy' and 'sustainable consumption and production'. Also with regard to digital (consumer) law, things are evolving. After abandoning a 28 th sales regime 'the CESL', the Commission proposed, among others, a Directive concerning online and other <b>distance</b> <b>sales</b> contracts of goods. It introduces e. g. rules about conformity of goods and the remedies in case of non-conformity. How can we use these elements of 'non-conformity' and 'remedies' to enhance the protection of ethical consumers? The European Consumer Organisation (BEUC) suggested for example in its response to the Commission of 3 September 2015 that the latter should implement, with regard to non-conformity, criteria such as 'durability'. This contribution aims to contribute to the debate about ethical consumerism in a digital era. Therefore it is of fundamental importance to explore all possible mechanisms (and their necessity) in the (proposed) EU contract (soft) law instruments to enhance the protection of ethical consumers, and especially the instruments aimed at online sales contracts. status: publishe...|$|E
40|$|The {{present study}} aims at {{describing}} the state-of-play of short food supply chains (SFSC) in the EU understood {{as being the}} chains in which foods involved are identified by, and traceable to a farmer and for which the number of intermediaries between farmer and consumer should be minimal or ideally nil. Several types of SFSCs can be identified, for example CSAs (Community-Supported Agriculture), on-farm sales, off-farm schemes (farmers markets, delivery schemes), collective sales in particular towards public institutions, being mostly local / proximity sales {{and in some cases}} <b>distance</b> <b>sales.</b> Such type of food chain has specific social impacts, economic impacts at regional and farm level as well as environmental impacts translating themselves into a clear interest of consumers. SFSCs are present throughout the EU, although there are some differences in the different MS in terms of dominating types of SFSCs. In general, they are dominantly small or microenterprises, composed of small-scale producers, often coupled to organic farming practices. Social values (quality products to consumers and direct contact with the producer) are the values usually highlighted by SFSCs before environmental or economic values. In terms of policy tools, there are pros and cons in developing a specific EU labelling scheme which could bring more recognition, clarity, protection and value added to SFSCs, while potential costs might be an obstacle. Anyhow, a possible labelling scheme should take into account the current different stages and situations of development of SFSCs in the EU and be flexible enough accommodate these differences. Other policy tools, in particular training and knowledge exchange in marketing and communication, are considered important and should continue to be funded by Rural Development programmes, as well as possibly other EU funds in view of the positive social and not specifically rural impact...|$|E

The chapeau, that is the legal instrument putting into effect the eventual CESL, concerns such fundamental questions as legal basis, namely Art. 114 TFEU on the internal market, importance of the subsidiarity and proportionality principles, personal, territorial and substantive scope of the proposal, the mechanism of “opting-in” in cross-border B 2 C (business to consumer) transactions, its relation to the “acquis”, in particular the recently adopted “Consumer Rights Directive” (CRD) 2011 / 83 /EU of 25. 10. 2011, to existing Member State law under conflict-oflaw provisions of Art. 6 on consumer protection of Regulation (EU) 593 / 2008, and to options left to them. The second part, written by Hans Micklitz, analyses the substantive provisions of the so-called Annex I, namely the text of the CESL itself which with some modifications took over over the results of the EU expert group on a “feasibility study on an optional instrument” of 3. 5. 2011. It is concerned with B 2 C provisions on so-called “off-premises” and distance contracts with respect to information obligations of traders and withdrawal rights of consumers which are particularly relevant in ecommerce. Also the new proposals on unfair terms are discussed which go beyond the existing acquis of Dir. 93 / 13 /EEC. The third part, written by Norbert Reich, is concerned with provisions on consumer sales and related service transactions, also based on the feasibility study with an extension to “digital content”. Some of them go beyond the existing acquis of Dir. 99 / 44 /EC, while the concept of “related service contracts” remains rather obscure and controversial.

40|$|Prior {{studies have}} argued and {{regularly}} found that cultural distance is {{negatively related to}} bilateral export flows, which are the sum of arm’s length and intra-firm exports. However, these macro-level studies overlook the firm-level insights that arm’s length exports are a substitute for arm’s length affiliate sales, and that firms’ choices between these substitutes are influenced by cultural distance. Moreover, intra-firm exports are a complement to arm’s length affiliate sales and hence likely to respond {{in the same way}} to cultural <b>distance</b> as such <b>sales.</b> The inclusion of intra-firm exports in export flows has thus obscured the effect of cultural distance on aggregate arm’s length exports. We overcome these conceptual and methodological deficiencies by examining how cultural distance influences aggregate arm’s length exports, while simultaneously considering its impact on aggregate arm’s length affiliate sales. Drawing on several strands of firm-level international business (IB) research, we argue that while arm’s length affiliate sales are likely to decline with cultural distance, this is not necessarily the case with arm’s length exports, whichmay in fact increase with cultural distance. Analyzing a panel dataset of US foreign affiliate sales and US exports to unaffiliated parties, we find that cultural distance negatively affects arm’s length affiliate sales but positively affects arm’s length exports. Our study thus shows that the explicit consideration of firm-level entry mode choices helps us better understand and explain macro-level IB activity...|$|R

"These programmes strengthen the bond between parents and infants {{in the first two years}} of life. Research consistently shows that these parenting programmes offer the best value for money in giving a child the emotional skills to deal with life and diverting them from a later pattern of antisocial behaviour. " STOP SALE OF PRESCRIPTION DRUGS ON CITY STREETS "There is a serious problem with the sale and swapping of prescription drugs in Dublin city centre", he went on. "Empower the Gardaí to prosecute in cases where offenders are found to be trading prescription drugs and introduce a national protocol on the prescription of benzodiazepines, as a matter of urgency to address problematic issues like repeat prescriptions. Care for drug users locally. Methadone treatment must be made promptly available, where the user lives. Implement local services for methadone treatment for local people in local areas, rather than forcing people to access services in the city centre.

The goal {{of this research was}} to investigate economic components of harvesting operations not previously studied for steep slope thinning harvests in Douglas-fir (Pseudotsuga menziesii) stands. This research explored three important issues affecting Pacific Northwest costs and revenues. On the expense side, mobilization costs associated with wildlife protections restricting harvest operating seasons were modeled for nine Siuslaw National Forest timber sales. Mobilization costs resulting from seasonal restrictions imposed for nesting of northern spotted owl (Strix occidentalis) and marbled murrelet (Brachyramphus marmoratus) were 1. 48 to 2. 60 per 100 cubic feet (1 Ccf) for an array of sale volumes, cut tree sizes, and one-way mobilization <b>distances.</b> Total <b>sale</b> costs ranged from 7000 to 43000, depending on the number of mobilizations required. With respect to income, two studies were performed to evaluate revenue improvement through bucking-to-value strategies. The first evaluated a reduced set of log lengths that approach computer-generated optimal values and the potential for development of a bucking decision tool. The second sought value optimization with a log allocation constraint through the application of a combinatorial heuristic approach for the reduced set of log lengths to create the bucking pattern cutting card. A reduced set of five log lengths, two mill-length logs and three woods-lengths resulting from combinations of the mill-lengths, was evaluated for value recovery. Resulting values obtained 96 to 98 percent of full set optimal values for 45 and 65 year old stands, respectively. Value recovery exceeded current unaided bucking practices. A modified Simulated Annealing heuristic achieved 99. 93 to 100 percent of known maximum for the unconstrained optimization. The SA generated bucking solutions improved value recovery by 2. 61 to 2. 73 per Ccf while meeting the preferred log allocation. The resulting bucking patterns were easily incorporated into a cutting card based on length to merchantable top. This approach reduced the number of logs handled, increased mill preferred long logs, decreased pattern count, and increased recovered value. Improved revenues exceeded estimated mobilization costs...|$|R
40|$|The {{cornerstones}} of Oregon 2 ̆ 7 s 1973 Senate Bill 100 are {{the preservation}} of farm, forest, and other resource lands and the containment of urban development within urban growth boundaries (UCB). The UCB is a boundary around each incorporated city containing enough land to meet projected needs until the year 2000. The Land Conservation and Development Commission (LCDC), charged with adopting and implementing state planning policy, sought to keep UGBs small enough to contain urban sprawl. To avoid the potential effects of land price inflation, LCDC allowed UGBs to include more land supply than the forecasted demand. The Portland-Metropolitan region was allowed to have a 15. 3 -percent surplus. Policy makers are unsure what effect UGBs have on housing costs. The common belief is that by restricting the amount of land available for residential construction the market drives prices up. Contrasting opinions suggest that by substituting low-density with high-density development, per-unit construction costs are lower, thus reducing the costs of owning a home. Efforts to dispel some of the mystery {{about the relationship between}} UGBs and housing prices are needed. The objective of this research is to provide empirical evidence {{of the relationship between the}} Portland-Metropolitan area 2 ̆ 7 s UGB and housing prices. The study uses a hedonic model to conduct a time-series analysis for the years 1978 to 1990 for Washington County. This study found no relationship between housing price and the imposition of the UGB. In fact, the rate of increase in price for single-family housing after UGB implementation was found to be much less than before. Proximity as measured by <b>distance</b> of <b>sale</b> to the UGB was the only variable that was associated with a higher rate of increase in housing prices. All of these results, with the exception of those related to proximity, were unexpected but may be explained by several factors: imposition of the Metropolitan Housing Rule in 1981, a severe recession during the 1980 s, and excess land supply. These influences do not support a conclusion that UGBs lead to an increase in housing prices, at least prior to 1990, when the UGB did not constrain the supply of land...|$|R
40|$|Metadata onlyThe {{purpose of}} this paper is to develop and test a model of the factors that explain the level of {{interpersonal}} conflict between marketing managers and sales managers. The paper aims to establish the overall level of interpersonal conflict in the full sample and in the two sampled countries (UK and Australia). Design/methodology/approach – The study draws on two theoretical frameworks to develop the model, namely structural contingency theory and the interaction approach. More specifically, the conceptual framework uses three groups of variables to explain interpersonal conflict: structural, individual, and communication. Importantly, the study developed and tested nine hypotheses. Confirmatory factor analysis was used to test the validity of the measures while OLS regression was used in testing the hypotheses. The data were collected from 200 sales managers in the UK and Australia. Findings – Overall, the study finds that there was a surprisingly low level of interpersonal conflict between marketing managers and sales managers and that there were no differences across the two countries. Of the three groups of variables, the two communication variables – frequency and bidirectionality – had the strongest effects on interpersonal conflict. The next strongest effects were from the individual-level variables – psychological <b>distance</b> and the <b>sales</b> manager's formal education. The findings also reveal that the level of the sales manager's marketing training and the marketing manager's sales experience had no influence on interpersonal conflict. Two of the three structural variables – use of lateral linkages and being part of a corporation – had the hypothesized negative impact on interpersonal conflict. Originality/value – This is the first study to use a large empirical survey to examine the marketing and sales dyad. Also, it is one of the few studies to test the effects of communication behviours on peer manager conflict...|$|R
