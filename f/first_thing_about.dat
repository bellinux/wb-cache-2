2500|$|Dolphy and John Coltrane {{knew each}} other long before they {{formally}} played together, having met when Coltrane was in Los Angeles with Miles Davis. They would often exchange ideas and learn from each other, and eventually, after many nights sitting in with Coltrane's band, Dolphy was asked to become a full member. Coltrane had gained an audience and critical notice with Miles Davis's quintet, but alienated some jazz critics {{when he began to}} move away from hard bop. Although Coltrane's quintets with Dolphy (including the Village Vanguard and Africa/Brass sessions) are now well regarded, they originally provoked Down Beat magazine to brand Coltrane and Dolphy's music as 'anti-jazz'. Coltrane later said of this criticism: [...] "they made it appear that we didn't even know the <b>first</b> <b>thing</b> <b>about</b> music (...) it hurt me to see [...] get hurt in this thing." ...|$|E

50|$|The <b>first</b> <b>thing</b> unique <b>about</b> {{this village}} {{is that it}} is {{naturally}} divided into two parts, the naturally untouched forest where herder mostly take their livestock for grazing and there are also some different types of wild animals such as lion, hyena and springbok. On {{the other side of the}} village is the town area where there are the clinic, church, electricity, open market or shopping area and the councilor's office.|$|R
60|$|Striped Chipmunk, Johnny Chuck, Jimmy Skunk, and Danny Meadow Mouse {{looked as}} though they felt very foolish, as indeed they did. You see, all their lives Miner the Mole {{had been one of}} their nearest neighbors, and yet they didn't know the <b>first</b> <b>thing</b> <b>about</b> him.|$|E
60|$|Work! I, who {{had worked}} with men, found that I didn't know the <b>first</b> <b>thing</b> <b>about</b> real work. A ten-hour day! I had to pass coal for the day and night shifts, and, despite working through the noon-hour, I never {{finished}} my task before eight at night. I was working a twelve-to thirteen-hour day, and I wasn't being paid overtime as in the cannery.|$|E
6000|$|... "Never, on your principality!" [...] exclaimed {{the young}} man, hopelessly. [...] "You don't know Marian--of course. She's always on time, to the minute. That was the <b>first</b> <b>thing</b> <b>about</b> her that {{attracted}} me. I've got the mitten {{instead of the}} scarf. I ought to have known at 8.31 that my goose was cooked. I'll go West on the 11.45 to-night with Jack Milburn. The jig's up. I'll try Jack's ranch awhile and top off with the Klondike and whiskey. Good-night--er--er--Prince." ...|$|E

50|$|The {{song was}} {{originally}} {{going to be}} a blues-style song, but guitarist Steve Cradock came up with the opening riff and decided to use that instead.

60|$|So, hurriedly enough, {{for these}} {{subjects}} {{seemed to be}} uncomfortable, even dangerous in a sense, I began {{to talk of the}} <b>first</b> <b>thing</b> <b>about</b> Africa that I remembered--namely, of the legend of the Holy Flower that was guarded by a huge ape, of which I had heard from a white man {{who was supposed to be}} rather mad, who went by the name of Brother John. Also I told her that there was something in it, as I had with me a specimen of the flower.|$|E
6000|$|Babbitt boomed, [...] "Fine! Sure! Just let me know. And {{the wife}} and I want to have you at the house." [...] He forgot it, but {{unfortunately}} Ed Overbrook did not. Repeatedly he telephoned to Babbitt, inviting him to dinner. [...] "Might as well go and get it over," [...] Babbitt groaned to his wife. [...] "But don't it simply amaze you the way the poor fish doesn't know the <b>first</b> <b>thing</b> <b>about</b> social etiquette? Think of him 'phoning me, instead of his wife sitting down and writing us a regular bid! Well, I guess we're stuck for it. That's the trouble with all this class-brother hooptedoodle." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "You {{might make}} the jacket a little tighter," [...] I whispered. [...] "It's too loose for comfort. I get lost in it. Hutchins is stupid. He is also a fool. He doesn't know the <b>first</b> <b>thing</b> <b>about</b> lacing the jacket. Warden, you ought {{to put him in}} charge of the loom-room. He is a more {{profound}} master of inefficiency than the present incumbent, who is merely stupid without being a fool as well. Now get out, all of you, unless you can think of worse to do to me. In which case, by all means remain. I invite you heartily to remain, if you think in your feeble imaginings that you have devised fresh torture for me." ...|$|E

5000|$|Video {{reviewer}} Denny Recob similarly {{enjoyed the}} show: [...] "The <b>first</b> <b>thing</b> I noticed <b>about</b> this year's {{show is the}} comedian was outstanding. Her jokes were funny and topical and she actually knew the correct porn slang and knew the correct pronunciation of the stars' names. This is a big improvement from previous years." ...|$|R
60|$|I sought odd jobs. I worked days, and half-days, at {{anything}} I could get. I mowed lawns, trimmed hedges, took up carpets, beat them, and laid them again. Further, I took {{the civil service}} examinations for mail carrier and passed first. But alas! there was no vacancy, and I must wait. And while I waited, and in between the odd jobs I managed to procure, I started to earn ten dollars by writing a newspaper account of a voyage I had made, in an open boat down the Yukon, of nineteen hundred miles in nineteen days. I didn't know the <b>first</b> <b>thing</b> <b>about</b> the newspaper game, but I was confident I'd get ten dollars for my article.|$|E
6000|$|... "Just the same, you're {{wrong on}} general principle," [...] Grimshaw would oar in. [...] "I {{said at the}} time that the only reason we took Captain Doane in with us on the deal was because we needed a {{navigator}} and because you and me didn't know the <b>first</b> <b>thing</b> <b>about</b> it. You said, 'Yes, sure'; and right away knew more about it than him when you wouldn't stand for buying three chronometers. What was the matter with you was that the expense hurt you. That's about as big an idea as your mind ever had room for. You go around looking for to dig out ten million dollars with a second- hand spade you call buy for sixty-eight cents." ...|$|E
6000|$|Mark Warren came up {{and asked}} her to dance. Rilla went, knowing Kenneth didn't care whether she went or stayed. An hour ago on the sand-shore he had been looking at {{her as if she were}} the only being of any {{importance}} in the world. And now she was nobody. His thoughts were full of this Great Game which was to be played out on bloodstained fields with empires for stakes--a Game in which womenkind could have no part. Women, thought Rilla miserably, just had to sit and cry at home. But all this was foolishness. Kenneth couldn't go--he admitted that himself--and Walter couldn't--thank goodness for that--and Jem and Jerry would have more sense. She wouldn't worry--she would enjoy herself. But how awkward Mark Warren was! How he bungled his steps! Why, for mercy's sake, did boys try to dance who didn't know the <b>first</b> <b>thing</b> <b>about</b> dancing; and who had feet as big as boats? There, he had bumped her into somebody! She would never dance with him again! ...|$|E
5000|$|The <b>first</b> and {{immediate}} <b>thing</b> <b>about</b> the European decision is the enlargement {{of dignity and}} freedom for gay people - but I think a decision like this enhances the dignity and freedom {{of all the people}} of Ireland because it pushes us towards a more tolerant and plural society. Norris's reaction to the European ruling, 1988.|$|R
25|$|The <b>first</b> <b>thing</b> to note <b>about</b> the cybernetic {{theory of}} {{organizations}} encapsulated in the VSM is that viable systems are recursive; viable systems contain viable systems {{that can be}} modeled using an identical cybernetic description as the higher (and lower) level systems in the containment hierarchy (Beer expresses this property of viable systems as cybernetic isomorphism).|$|R

6000|$|The yellow glow that {{flooded the}} room {{disclosed}} a short, stocky youth of obviously Bowery extraction. A shock of vivid red hair was the <b>first</b> <b>thing</b> <b>about</b> him {{that caught the}} eye. A poet would have described it as Titian. Its proprietor's friends and acquaintances probably called it [...] "carrots." [...] Looking up at Jimmy from under this wealth of crimson was a not unpleasing face. It was not handsome, certainly; but there were suggestions of a latent good-humor. The nose had been broken at one period of its career, {{and one of the}} ears was undeniably of the cauliflower type; but these are little accidents which may happen to any high-spirited young gentleman. In costume, the visitor had evidently been guided rather by individual taste than by the dictates of fashion. His coat was of rusty black, his trousers of gray, picked out with stains of various colors. Beneath the coat was a faded red-and-white sweater. A hat of soft felt lay on the floor by the table.|$|E
60|$|And it so happened. And in stolen half-hours {{of meeting}} I {{came to know}} all the sweet madness of boy's love and girl's love. So {{far as it goes}} it is not the biggest love in the world, but I do dare to assert that it is the sweetest. Oh, as I look back on it! Never did girl have more {{innocent}} boy-lover than I who had been so wicked-wise and violent beyond my years. I didn't know the <b>first</b> <b>thing</b> <b>about</b> girls. I, who had been hailed Prince of the Oyster Pirates, who could go anywhere in the world as a man amongst men; who could sail boats, lay aloft in black and storm, or go into the toughest hang-outs in sailor town and play my part in any rough-house that started or call all hands to the bar--I didn't know the first thing I might say or do with this slender little chit of a girl-woman whose scant skirt just reached her shoe-tops and who was as abysmally ignorant of life as I was, or thought I was, profoundly wise.|$|E
6000|$|... "Willard {{is a nice}} boy," [...] said Miss Sally suddenly. [...] "I don't think I {{ever did}} him justice before. The finer qualities of his {{character}} come out in these simple, homely little doings and tasks. He is certainly very thoughtful and kind. Oh, I suppose he'll make a good husband, as husbands go. But he doesn't know the <b>first</b> <b>thing</b> <b>about</b> managing. If his wife isn't a good manager, I don't know what they'll do. And perhaps she won't like the way we've done up Eden. Willard says she will, of course, because he thinks her perfection. But she may have dreadful taste and want the lace curtains and that nightmare of a pink rug Willard admired, and I dare say she'd rather have a new flaunting set of china with rosebuds on it than that dear old dull blue I picked up for a mere song down at the Aldenbury auction. I stood in the rain for two mortal hours to make sure of it, {{and it was really}} worth all that Willard has spent on the dining room put together. It will break my heart if she sets to work altering Eden. It's simply perfect as it is--though I suppose I shouldn't say it." ...|$|E
50|$|Those who had met Place {{claimed the}} <b>first</b> <b>thing</b> they noticed <b>about</b> her {{was that she}} was strikingly pretty, with a very nice smile, and that she was cordial, refined and an {{excellent}} shot with a rifle. She was said to have spoken in an educated manner, and she indicated she was originally from the East Coast, although she never revealed an exact location.|$|R

6000|$|... 'Oh, most extraordinary!' said Laura, as {{they went}} in. The old lady however {{concealed}} such surprise as she may have felt, and greeted Mr. Wendover {{as if he were}} any one of fifty familiars. She took him altogether for granted and asked him no questions about his arrival, his departure, his hotel or his business in England. He noticed, as he afterwards confided to Laura, her omission of these forms; but he was not wounded by it--he only made a mark against it as an illustration of the difference between English and American manners: in New York people always asked the arriving stranger the <b>first</b> <b>thing</b> <b>about</b> the steamer and the hotel. Mr. Wendover appeared greatly impressed with Lady Davenant's antiquity, though he confessed to his companion on a subsequent occasion that he thought her a little flippant, a little frivolous even for her years. 'Oh yes,' said the girl, on that occasion, 'I have no doubt that you considered she talked too much, for one so old. In America old ladies sit silent and listen to the young.' Mr. Wendover stared a little and replied to this that with her--with Laura Wing--it was impossible to tell which side she was on, the American or the English: sometimes she seemed to take one, sometimes the other. At any rate, he added, smiling, with regard to the other great division it was easy to see--she was {{on the side of the}} old. 'Of course I am,' she said; 'when one is old!' And then he inquired, according to his wont, if she were thought so in England; to which she answered that it was England that had made her so.|$|E
60|$|They {{all knew}} Tom Perkins. The <b>first</b> <b>thing</b> <b>about</b> {{him was that}} he was not a gentleman. They remembered him quite well. He was a small, dark boy, with untidy black hair and large eyes. He looked like a gipsy. He had come to the school as a day-boy, with the best {{scholarship}} on their endowment, so that his education had cost him nothing. Of course he was brilliant. At every Speech-Day he was loaded with prizes. He was their show-boy, and they remembered now bitterly their fear that he would try to get some scholarship at one of the larger public schools and so pass out of their hands. Dr. Fleming had gone to the linendraper his father--they all remembered the shop, Perkins and Cooper, in St. Catherine's Street--and said he hoped Tom would remain with them till he went to Oxford. The school was Perkins and Cooper's best customer, and Mr. Perkins was only too glad to give the required assurance. Tom Perkins continued to triumph, he was the finest classical scholar that Dr. Fleming remembered, and on leaving the school took with him the most valuable scholarship they had to offer. He got another at Magdalen and settled down to a brilliant career at the University. The school magazine recorded the distinctions he achieved year after year, and when he got his double first Dr. Fleming himself wrote a few words of eulogy on the front page. It was with greater satisfaction that they welcomed his success, since Perkins and Cooper had fallen upon evil days: Cooper drank like a fish, and just before Tom Perkins took his degree the linendrapers filed their petition in bankruptcy.|$|E
50|$|Irigoyen's {{date and}} place of birth are unknown. The <b>first</b> <b>thing</b> <b>about</b> him is when he was {{appointed}} governor of Texas in 1798. In his years of service, he never got to hold the office.|$|E
5000|$|Political expert Anders Åslund {{commented on}} this aspect: [...] "Revolutionary times {{have their own}} logic that is very {{different}} from the logic of ordinary politics, as writers from Alexis de Tocqueville to Crane Brinton have taught. The <b>first</b> <b>thing</b> to understand <b>about</b> Ukraine today is that it has entered a revolutionary stage. Like it or not, we had better deal with the new environment rationally." ...|$|R
6000|$|I {{have never}} {{disguised}} it from myself, {{and nobody has}} ever disguised it from me, that I am not a handsome dog. Even mother never thought me beautiful. She was no Gladys Cooper herself, but she never hesitated to criticize my appearance. In fact, I have yet to meet anyone who did. The <b>first</b> <b>thing</b> strangers say <b>about</b> me is, 'What an ugly dog!' ...|$|R
50|$|The <b>first</b> <b>thing</b> to note <b>about</b> the cybernetic {{theory of}} {{organizations}} encapsulated in the VSM is that viable systems are recursive; viable systems contain viable systems {{that can be}} modeled using an identical cybernetic description as the higher (and lower) level systems in the containment hierarchy (Beer expresses this property of viable systems as cybernetic isomorphism).A development of this model has originated the theoretical proposal called viable systems approach.|$|R
