A unit of Russia’s state-owned JSC Russian Railways signed a contract Thursday with the <b>design</b> <b>unit</b> of China’s state-controlled China Railway Group {{to come up with the}} plans for a 770 kilometer high-speed rail between the two Russian cities. The Chinese firm will work alongside two Russian companies for on the designs for a total cost of 20.8 billion rubles ($383 million) over the next two years, according to Russian Railways.|$|E
25|$|In June 1944 a {{decision}} was made to transfer No. 61 Wing from the Darwin area to New Guinea, where it would support the Allied advance towards the Philippines. This was opposed by the Air Officer Commanding North-Western Area, Air Vice Marshal Adrian Cole, who wanted the wing to take part in an operation being planned to capture Selaru island in the Netherlands East Indies (NEI); this operation was effectively cancelled on 7 June, however. No. 61 Wing left Darwin in August and arrived at Morotai in the NEI on 18 September, three days after United States Army forces had first landed on the island in the Battle of Morotai. No. 14 Airfield Construction Squadron landed on Morotai on 18 September and began work on building airfields the next day. Shortly before this operation began No. 12 Survey and <b>Design</b> <b>Unit</b> was absorbed into No. 61 Wing's headquarters on 12 September.|$|E

2500|$|The {{university}} has 104 undergraduate majors and 96 graduate programs. It has a Department of Viticulture and Enology (concerning the {{scientific study of}} grape-growing and winemaking) that has been and continues to be responsible for significant advancements in winemaking utilized by many Californian wineries. The campus claims to be noted for its top-rated Agricultural and Resource Economics programs [...] and the large Department of Animal Science through which students can study at the university's own on-campus dairy, meat-processing plant, equestrian facility, and experimental farm. Students of Environmental Horticulture and other botanical sciences have many acres of campus farmland and the University of California, Davis, Arboretum at their disposal. The Department of Applied Science was founded and formerly chaired by physicist Edward Teller. The arts are also studied extensively on campus with subjects such as studio art, design, music, theater and dance. The Design Department at UC Davis is the only comprehensive academic <b>design</b> <b>unit</b> of the University of California system. [...] There is also the Mondavi Center for the Performing Arts which features artists from all over the globe.|$|E
2500|$|No. 61 Wing was {{established}} at Camp Pell in Royal Park, Melbourne, on 7 January 1943. It was intended that the wing would command No. 1, No. 3, No. 8 and No. 9 Mobile Works Squadrons {{as well as}} No. 11 Works Supply Unit and No. 12 Survey and <b>Design</b> <b>Unit.</b> Several of these units were either being formed or were planned to be established in the future. At the end of January the Wing's Headquarters had a strength of 7 officers and 52 airmen {{and was in the}} process of moving to the vicinity of Darwin. By April 1943 No. 61 Wing had several airfield construction squadrons under its command in the Darwin area. All of the wing's units arrived at Darwin by July 1943, though No. 1 Mobile Works Squadron was redeployed to Victoria shortly afterwards as it had completed twelve months service in the tropics. Before departing the squadron was split to form No. 14 Mobile Works Squadron on 20 July, which remained at Darwin. During early 1944 No. 61 Wing built a [...] long runway at Darwin to accommodate a proposed deployment of one hundred USAAF B-29 Superfortress heavy bombers. While the airfield was completed, no B-29s were ever based in Darwin as they were instead deployed to India to attack targets in Japan and East Asia as part of Operation Matterhorn.|$|E
