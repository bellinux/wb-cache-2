40|$|The {{geographic}} range analysis of 59 {{species of the}} family Vespidae (Hymenoptera) of northern Mongolia was performed using published sources and our own data. The longitude-latitudinal approach is supported for the chorological division. Chorological component of vespid fauna of northern Mongolia is mainly composed of Palaearctic polyzonal and sub-boreal species associated especially with sub-boreal semi-humid and sub-boreal semi-arid landscapes. Northern Mongolia together with Trans-Baikal region act as barrier to the latitudinal and longitudinal distribution of vespid wasps, {{and it can be}} called, as the BaikalMongolian <b>faunal</b> <b>barrier.</b> Four sub-endemic vespid species, Onychopterocheilus turovi (Kostylev, 1937), O. kiritshenkoi (Kostylev, 1940), Ancistrocerus rufopictus (Kostylev, 1940), Eumenes transbaicalicus Kurzenko, 1984 were defi ned to Mongolia...|$|E
40|$|Abstract: The Aztec fauna {{is one of}} {{the most}} diverse fossil {{vertebrate}} faunas from Antarctica, with over 30 taxa belonging to the four major groups of jawed fishes (acanthodians, placoderms, osteichthyans, chondrichthyans), and one group of agnathans (thelodontids). Biogeographically the strongest affinity is with eastern Australia, as part of the East Gondwana Province. Biostratigraphically the Aztec succession i cludes probably the youngest known non-marine thelodont agnathans at the base, and the oldest known phyllolepids at the top. This transition, and an association of species of Turinia and Bothriolepis, is not seen in any other sequence. Most or all of the Aztec sequence is regarded as Givetian (late Middle Devonian) in age. The Aztec fauna contains older and/ or more primitive representatives of several groups typical of younger (late Palaeozoic) strata in Euramerica, suggesting a biotic dispersal episode between Gondwana and Euramerica in the Late Devonian. Centres of origin and dispersal hypotheses in Palaeozoic biogeography can be related to disappearance of faunal barriers as manifested indifferent stratigraphic ranges in different areas. The change for Devonian vertebrates from the endemic patterns een in the Early Devonian to the close similarity of Famennian faunas between East Gondwana and Euramerica suggests disappearance of a major <b>faunal</b> <b>barrier</b> in the Late Devonian, presumably the ocean between Gondwana nd Euramerica. History of discovery Fish remains of Devonian age were the first vertebrates to be discovered as fossils on the Antarctic continent. The fauna from the Aztec Siltstone of the Beacon Supergroup in southern Victoria Land (Fig. 1), first collected from moraine of the Mackay Glacier near Granite Harbour (Taylor 1913), is now the best known Palaeozoic vertebrate assemblage fro...|$|E
40|$|The ocelot (Leopardus pardalis) and margay (L. wiedii) are sister-species of Neotropical cats which {{evolved from}} a lineage that {{migrated}} into South America during {{the formation of the}} Panamanian land bridge 3 – 5 million years ago. Patterns of population genetic divergence of each species were studied by phylogenetic analyses of mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) control region sequences in individuals sampled across the distribution of these taxa. Abundant genetic diversity and remarkably concordant phylogeographic partitions for both species were observed, identifying parallel geographic regions which likely reflect historical <b>faunal</b> <b>barriers.</b> Inferred aspects of phylogeography, population genetic structure, and demographic history were used to formulate conservation recommendations for these species. In addition, observed patterns of sequence variation provided insight into the molecular evolution of the mtDNA control region in closely related felids...|$|R

They are: G. andersoni sp. n. (type locality: Chiapas, Chiapas Highlands, Cerro Huitepec) and G. vignatagliantii sp. n. (type locality: Chiapas, Motozintla, Sierra Madre de Chiapas, Benito Juárez) from Mexico; G. antigua sp. n. (type locality: Sacatepéquez, 5 km SE of Antigua), G. balini sp. n.

(type locality: Jalapa Department, 4 km E of Mataquescuintla), G. longinoi, sp. n. (type locality: El Progreso Department, Cerro Pinalón), and G. minimus sp. n. (type locality: Sacatepéquez Department, 5 km SE of Antigua) from Guatemala; and G. celaquensis sp. n. (type locality: Lempira Department, Celaque National Park), G. comayaguanus sp. n. (type locality: Comayagua Department, 18 km ENE of Comayagua), G. disjunctus sp. n. (type locality: Francisco Morazán, La Tigra National Park), and G. lencanus sp. n. (type locality: Lempira Department, Celaque National Park) from Honduras. For {{all members of the}} group, adult structural characters, including male and female genitalia, are described, and a taxonomic key for all members of the integripennis species group is presented based on these characters. Behavioral and biogeographical aspects of speciation in the group are discussed, based on the morphological analysis. In all cases of sympatry, pairs of closely related species show greater differences in sizes than pairs of more remotely related species. Integripennis group species occupy six different montane areas at elevations above 1300 m, with no species shared among them. Major <b>faunal</b> <b>barriers</b> in the region limiting present species distributions include the Motagua Fault Zone and a gap between the Guatemalan Cordillera volcanic chain and the Honduran Interior Highlands no higher than 900 m in elevation. Highest species diversity is in the Guatematan Cordillera (six species), second highest in the Honduran Interior Highlands area (four species) ...|$|R
40|$|The Azores Front-Current System, {{south of}} the Azores Islands, has been studied in order to reveal the direct impact of an open oceanic thermohaline front on the {{distribution}} of the calcareous plankton. Planktic foraminifers, pteropods, heteropods, and coccolithophorids were sampled from the upper 2500 m of the water column during August 1997 and January 1999. In addition, the hydrography was recorded across the frontal jet on combined CTD and XBT transects. In August 1997, a strong seasonal thermocline capped the Azores Front (AF) at about 60 – 90 m water depth. Below the thermocline a distinct hydrographic front was indicated by temperature and salinity gradients. The central AF was an area of low planktic foraminiferal, gastropod, and coccolithophorid production, and was a <b>faunal</b> <b>barrier</b> for shallow- and deep-dwelling species. Highest numbers of planktic foraminifers, gastropods, and coccolithophores were recorded from above the thermocline north of the AF. The most frequent planktic foraminiferal and pteropod species were Globigerinoides ruber (white) and Limacina inflata, respectively. Below 100 m, planktic foraminifers were most frequent north of the AF and gastropod shells were rare. In particular, the deep-dwelling planktic foraminifer Globorotalia scitula was frequent only at sampling sites north of the AF. In January 1999, the surface water temperature of the Azores Front-Current System was lower and the thermocline was deeper than in August 1997. The planktic foraminiferal standing stock was three times higher than in August 1997, and no water depth related faunal changes occurred. The fauna was dominated by Globorotalia truncatulinoides, and Turborotalita humilis was frequent. During both January and August, the fauna from {{south of the}} Azores was different from that to the southeast, recording the occurrence of two different water masses. In this study we present a micropaleontological definition of the AF, in order to provide a paleoceanographic tool that may be used to decipher the late Quaternary current system of the North Atlantic Ocean...|$|E
40|$|Little {{is known}} about the fauna that inhabits non-chemosynthetic environments {{associated}} with mid-ocean ridges. This thesis investigates a ridge and fracture zone system to assess its influence as a barrier to faunal dispersal, and as a unique bathyal habitat. It also describes the ecology of megabenthic communities inhabiting a ridge. Sites were chosen on the Mid-Atlantic Ridge {{in the vicinity of the}} Charlie-Gibbs Fracture Zone, at a target depth of 2, 500 m. Four superstations were chosen north and south of the Fracture Zone, on either side of the ridge. Different productivity levels and hydrographic features were characteristic for the northern and southern sites. In order to characterise the benthic megafauna 50 ha were trawled and 32, 000 m 2 of seafloor were sampled with HD video footage, targeting both flat and 10 ? sloped habitats. Holothurians were the most abundant megafauna. In order to assess their evolutionary relationship 43 holothurian specimens were genetically studied by modelling five of their genes (16 S, 18 S, 28 S, COI, H 3) in a phylogenetic analysis. All four sites exhibited noticeably different faunal characteristics. The biomass was highest at the SE, and lowest at the NW site. Body sizes differed between sites for most taxa, that were sufficient in numbers to be compared between sites, most likely as a result of different adaptations to food supply. Differences in species richness were observed between the sampling methods, with the highest richness at the SE site in trawl samples, and highest at the NW and SW sites in the video survey. Species densities were highest at the northern sites with both methods. Differences in diversity were also observed, with trawl samples providing a higher taxonomic resolution than the video survey and showing highest diversity at the SE site and lowest at the NE site. Community composition was significantly different between sites. Variations in the composition of megabenthic assemblages were observed between flat and 10 ? sloped habitats, although the effect of slope appears to be site dependent. The genetic analyses revealed a close relationship between individuals from different families. The extent to which the Ridge acts as a <b>faunal</b> <b>barrier</b> was unclear as the southern sites lacked an obvious difference in community composition. Faunal differences to the north and south of the Fracture Zone, however, suggest that this feature is a barrier to dispersal. The contrasting megafaunal assemblages of the sites probably reflect a combination of environmental drivers including sediment type, phytodetrital quality, hydrography, and habitat complexity...|$|E
40|$|The Karakorum Block is {{regarded}} as a microplate of "Gondwanan" origin and was part of the Cimmerian continent ("Mega Lhasa") which rifted away from the northern margin of Gondwana during the Late Palaeozoic/Early Mesozoic. From the Northern Karakorum Range (Yarkhun and Karambar River Valleys: structurally belonging to the Northern Sedimentary Belt) an Upper Givetian to Lower Frasnian rugose coral fauna of the Shogram Formation is described. The fauna is dominated by cosmopolitan genera such as Hexagonaria, Disphyllum, Macgeea and the Temnophyllum / Spinophyllum group, generally showing a geographically wide distribution, although being absent from the Eastern Americas Realm in the Upper Givetian/Lower Frasnian. Therefore its components are of little use for biogeographical deductions at sub-realm level, and in explaining the relation between the Karakorum Range and other Cimmerian crustal blocks. A remarkable exception is the first record of the genus Pseudopexiphyllum outside of Turkey, indicating a connection to {{the western part of the}} Cimmerides. On species level, the coral fauna of the Shogram Formation is characterized by the development of a diverse and rather unique fauna including about 35 taxa, that differs from the faunas known from neighbouring crustal blocks. So far, faunistic links to the Central Iranian Microcontinent (Yazd-, and Tabas-Block), the northwest Iranian Plate (Elburz), Central Pamir, the Lhasa Block and Western Qiangtang are not clear, and although each of these fragments are believed to be closely connected they were apparently not in direct contact during the Devonian. However, the Karakorum fauna is remarkably close to one known from the Helmand Block in Afghanistan, showing a very similar generic composition that includes numerous morphologically closely related, although not identical species. Accordingly, the restricted faunal exchange led to the development of new taxa. Distribution of the new species of Spinophyllum, Pseudopexiphyllum and Pseudozaphrentis is limited to the Karakorum Mountains. Reasons for this individual faunistic development and the missing faunal exchange are unexplained, but suggest that some kind of active <b>faunal</b> <b>barrier</b> must have existed during the Devonian, which led to the development of the specific Karakorum fauna. With the exception of Phillipsastrea orientalis Smith, 1930, which is elsewhere only known from the Burmese Devonian, the occurrence of some other species suggest a connection to regions which are regarded as biogeographically unrelated. A weak relation to central European faunas is indicated by the occurrence of characteristic species of Macgeea and Hexagonaria known from the Ardennes and the Holy Cross Mountains. More unusual are the faunistic affinities to the Altai-Sayan region shown by the surprising occurrences of species of Spinophyllum and siphonophrentid corals morphologically very close to those known from the Altai Mtns. and Kazakhstan. { 1 } PDF { 2 }</p...|$|E
40|$|A {{phylogenetic tree}} for acrodont lizards (Chamaeleonidae and Agamidae) is {{established}} based on 1434 bases (1041 informative) of aligned DNA positions from a 1685 - 1778 base pair {{region of the}} mitochondrial genome. Sequences from three protein-coding genes (ND 1, ND 2, and COI) are combined with sequences from eight intervening tRNA genes for samples of 70 acrodont taxa and two outgroups. Parsimony analysis of nucleotide sequences identifies eight major clades in the Acrodonta. Most agamid lizards are placed into three distinct clades. One clade is composed of all taxa occurring in Australia and New Guinea; Physignathus cocincinus from Southeast Asia is the sister taxon to the Australia-New Guinea clade. A second clade is composed of taxa occurring from Tibet and the Indian Subcontinent east through South and East Asia. A third clade is composed of taxa occurring from Africa east through Arabia and West Asia to Tibet and the Indian Subcontinent. These three clades contain all agamid lizards except Uromastyx, Leiolepis, and Hydrosaurus, which represent three additional clades of the Agamidae. The Chamaeleonidae forms another clade weakly supported as the sister taxon to the Agamidae. All eight clades of the Acrodonta contain members occurring on land masses derived from Gondwanaland. A hypothesis of agamid lizards rafting with Gondwanan plates is examined statistically. This hypothesis suggests that the African/West Asian clade is of African or Indian origin, and the South Asian clade is either of Indian or Southeast Asian origin. The shortest tree suggests a possible African origin for the former and an Indian origin for the latter, but this result is not statistically robust. The Australia-New Guinea clade rafted with the Australia-New Guinea plate and forms the sister group to a Southeast Asian taxon that occurs on plates that broke from northern Australia-New Guinea. Other acrodont taxa are inferred {{to be associated with}} the plates of Afro-Arabia and Madagascar (Chamaeleonidae), India (Uromastyx), or southeast Asia (Hydrosaurus and Leiolepis). Introduction of different biotic elements to Asia by way of separate Gondwanan plates may be a major theme of Asian biogeography. Three historical events may be responsible for the sharp <b>faunal</b> <b>barrier</b> between Southeast Asia and Australia-New Guinea, known as Wallace's line: (1) primary vicariance caused by plate separations; (2) secondary contact of Southeast Asian plates with Eurasia, leading to dispersal from Eurasia into Southeast Asia, and (3) dispersal of the Indian fauna (after collision of that subcontinent) to Southeast Asia. Acrodont lizards show the first and third of these biogeographic patterns and anguid lizards exhibit the second pattern. Modern faunal diversity may be influenced primarily by historical events such as tectonic collisions and land bridge connections, which are expected to promote episodic turnover of continental faunas by introducing new faunal elements into an area. Repeated tectonic collisions may be one of the most important phenomena promoting continental biodiversity. Phylogenetics is a powerful method for investigating these processes...|$|E
