In 2 -year {{seasonal}} experiments (cultivation in peat), {{the effect}} of chelated and mineral forms of zinc on the yield of <b>greenhouse</b> <b>lettuce</b> and {{on the content of}} zinc, cop-per, manganese and iron in lettuce leaves were compared. The following zinc doses were applied: 10, 20, 30, and 60 mg dm- 3 of substrate. Using both forms of zinc in the studied range, good and similar yields were obtained.

40|$|Aim of the {{research}} was to compare innovative substrates as blast furnace and recycled plastic residues with traditional substrates as peat, perlite, and expanded clay, and to investigate the effects of substrate temperature on <b>greenhouse</b> <b>lettuce</b> cultivation. Substrates temperatures, solar radiation, air temperature and relative humidity were measured. Heat capacity of the substrates was determined on dry and irrigated samples. Experiments showed that lettuce marketable yield ranged from 24. 4 t/ha for recycled plastic, to 37. 1 t/ha for peat. Differences were observed in substrate daily temperature fluctuations. The standard deviation of the substrates temperature fluctuations ranged from the lowest value of 5. 1 °C for perlite, to the highest value of 11. 4 °C for expanded clay. The results obtained showed that lettuce higher productivity was related to lower daily substrates temperature fluctuations, with the other greenhouse environmental conditions being equal...|$|E

40|$|Bacterial midrib rot, {{caused by}} Pseudomonas cichorii, {{has become a}} serious threat to the {{production}} of <b>greenhouse</b> butterhead <b>lettuce</b> (Lactuca sativa L. var. capitata) in Belgium. Currently, there are no strategies for controlling this pathogen. Therefore, greenhouse experiments were conducted to obtain more knowledge about the epidemiology of P. cichorii on butterhead <b>lettuce.</b> <b>Greenhouse</b> butterhead <b>lettuce</b> becomes susceptible to lettuce midrib rot infections at head formation, and a single overhead irrigation with water containing 102 CFU/ml P. cichorii was sufficient to cause disease. The use of surface drip irrigation instead of overhead sprinkler irrigation significantly reduced midrib rot incidence in the greenhouse. P. cichorii isolates can be divided into subgroups based on BOX-PCR genomic fingerprinting, with isolates belonging to subgroup C 1 and C 2 being more virulent than those of (or related to) subgroup C 3. P. cichorii infections with distinct symptoms comparable to midrib rot have also been observed on field-grown crisphead lettuce in California and Japan which, respectively, are referred to as 'varnish spot' or 'tar'.

40|$|A simple two-state-variable {{model was}} {{developed}} to describe the nitrate concentration in lettuce when nitrate supply is unlimited. A central element of the model is a negative correlation between the concentrations of soluble carbohydrates and nitrate in the cell sap, a correlation which reflects the equivalent roles of nitrate and organic solutes in the maintenance of cell turgor. A conventional carbon balance model was used to predict the fluctuations of soluble carbohydrates {{as a function of}} time. The carbohydrate-to-nitrate correlation was then used to compensate for these fluctuations by adjusting the nitrate concentration. The concentration of carbohydrates in the non-structural buffer (vacuoles) is determined by the balance between source activity (supply of carbohydrates by photosynthesis, controlled by light and CO 2) and sink activity (demand for carbohydrates by growth and maintenance, controlled by temperature). As a result, winter conditions, characterized by source-limited growth, result in a depletion of carbon from the cell sap and, via the negative correlation, in a high nitrate concentration. Conversely, summer conditions result in low nitrate levels. A fair agreement was obtained when the model was tested with an available experimental data set for all-year-round production of <b>greenhouse</b> <b>lettuce</b> in Northern Germany...|$|E

40|$|Plant-derived {{protein hydrolysates}} {{represent}} new biostimulant products able to improve crop tolerance to abiotic stresses. The {{aim of the}} study was to determine growth, root morphology, SPAD index, chlorophyll fluorescence, leaf mineral composition, and metabolic profiling of <b>greenhouse</b> <b>lettuce</b> either untreated or treated (root or leaf-root application) with a plant-derived protein hydrolysate. For foliar application, plants were sprayed with 2. 5 ml L- 1, whereas for root application, 100 ml of solution with the same concentration was applied to the growing medium at weekly intervals. Lettuce plants were supplied with two nutrient solutions: non-salt control (1 mM NaCl) or 25 mM NaCl. Salt stress decreased shoot and root dry biomass, SPAD index, chlorophyll fluorescence, leaf mineral composition and increased foliar proline concentration. Root and leaf-root application of the biostimulant increased fresh yield, dry biomass and root dry weight of lettuce under salinity conditions. This was associated with an improvement of plant nitrogen metabolism and an increase of the Fv/Fm-ratio efficiency in biostimulant-treated plants. Oxidative stress mitigation, increase in osmolytes, changes in sterols and terpenes composition, as well as the less expected increase in glucosinolates were also observed in biostimulant-treated plants grown under saline conditions. The present study proves that the application of plant-derived protein hydrolysate increases plant performance when plants are grown under salinity conditions. The most favourable metabolic profile was obtained when biostimulant was applied to both roots and leaves...|$|E
40|$|Two growing factors (light and nitrogen) {{supplied}} at optimal and sub-optimal {{levels were}} studied {{with the aim}} of evaluating their effects on greenhouse-grown lettuce' biomass and quality performances. According to a split-plot design with three replications, <b>greenhouse</b> <b>lettuce</b> was subjected to sixteen experimental treatments consisting of four photosynthetically active radiation (PAR) availability levels (0, 50, 65 and 85 % PAR reduction) and four nitrogen fertilization rates (0, 75, 150 and 300 kgNha - 1). Response surface methodology (RSM) allowed to predict the highest achievable dry biomass (10. 54 gplant - 1) at 0. 9 % PAR reduction and 185. 4 kgNha - 1. This optimal light/N combination induced a nitrate concentration of 1176 and 1826 mgkg - 1 fresh weight (FW) in the inner and outer leaves, respectively. Shading decreased both the total phenolic content (TPC) and antioxidant activity. High N rates lowered both TPC in fully light condition and antioxidant activity in shading environment. The highest chlorophyll (Chl) concentrations were obtained with the combination shading/high N availability (at 85 % PAR reduction and 300 kgNha - 1) with values of 1. 938 and 1. 716 mgg - 1 FW for Chla and Chlb, respectively. In general, the results highlighted the potential for sustainable lettuce production, considering both economic and nutritional yields, i. e. providing high nutritionally dense products, slightly affecting the harvested biomass...|$|E
40|$|Leafy {{vegetables}} {{are the major}} source of dietary nitrate intake of humans. Nitrates can have many detrimental effects on human health besides some beneficial effects. A further reduction in nitrate concentration thus can represent added value for vegetable products rich in carotenoids, vitamins C and E, selenium, dietary fiber, plant sterols, and so on. Though nitrate accumulation is governed by a plenitude of factors (i. e., genetic setup, environmental conditions and nutrients), the factor most readily controllable is nitrogen nutrition. This study examined the dependence of butterhead lettuce crops' nitrate concentration on soil mineral nitrogen (N) content. It was shown that the effect of the soil's mineral N content at harvest was strongly associated with the nitrate concentration of lettuce at a low to intermediate mineral N content (100 kgNha- 1). This demonstrates the importance of N-fertilization practices. Results of 24 comparative experiments, based on two different N-fertilization recommendation procedures, did show that an N application difference {{at the start of the}} growing period has an effect on the nitrate concentration at harvest. A lower N application at either recommendation resulted in 71 % of the experiments (17 / 24) having a lower leaf nitrate concentration. The head weight was negatively affected in only 2 of these 17 experiments. Minimizing the N input and hence lowering the soil N content at harvest points to the possibility of further reducing the nitrate concentration level in <b>greenhouse</b> <b>lettuce,</b> while having no significant negative effect on economic yield...|$|E

40|$|This {{thesis is}} about optimal <b>greenhouse</b> <b>lettuce</b> cultivations such that lettuce nitrate {{accumulation}} above EU imposed maximum concentrations is prevented at maximum profits. This case {{is an example}} of two general classes of problems: firstly, crop quality improvement through adjustment of environmental conditions during cultivation and secondly, optimal control of processes that are carried out with a significant number of limitations on process variables while being affected by disturbances. Finding solutions for this problem will be interesting for people working in the area of horticulture as well as for people working in the area of optimal control.    This problem can be solved mathematically through the computation of optimal trajectories of greenhouse climate variables and their affecting controls. The variables of interest are greenhouse air temperature, relative humidity ratio and greenhouse air CO 2 -concentration while the control inputs are heating pipe temperatures, CO 2 -enrichment flow rates and ventilation rates. A so-called closed-loop suboptimal control algorithm is presented eventually. To build this algorithm, equations, cost functions, constraints and disturbances are presented first. Then results of open loop optimisations with perfect a-priori knowledge of disturbances are presented. These results are analysed for characteristic patterns. These patterns and necessary optimality conditions are applied to obtain operational modes for the design of the algorithm. Symbolic computations are also employed here. The modes can be evaluated very efficiently, which makes the algorithm highly efficient computationally...|$|E
40|$|The NICOLET {{model has}} been {{developed}} to predict the growth and nitrate content of <b>greenhouse</b> <b>lettuce.</b> Four single-organ versions have been developed: [1] abundant supply of nitrogen (1998), [2] mild N-stress (1999), [3] severe N-stress (2003), and [4] ontogenetic changes of organic-N and water content (in preparation). The `abundant-N¿ model [1] and the `mild-stress¿ model [2] have two compartments: `structure¿ and `vacuole¿, while the `severe-stress¿ model [3] requires a third compartment: `excess-carbon¿, and the `ontogenetic¿ model [4] has separate `metabolic¿ and `support¿ structural sub-compartments. The main special features of the NICOLET model are [1] the osmotica balance of the `vacuole¿, where nitrate and hydrocarbons play a complementary role in maintaining a constant osmotic potential, [2] the excess-carbon compartment, where `dry¿ carbon compounds are stored, and [3] the sub-division of the `structure¿ into sub-compartments of different compositions. Loosely speaking, the first feature controls the nitrate concentration, the second controls the organic-N and water contents, and the third controls the ontogenetic changes. The NICOLET {{model has been}} able to mimic `normal¿ seasonal variations of nitrate content, as well as the effects of drastic N-stress treatments. These results are illustrated by comparing measured data with model-simulations. Accurate prediction of nitrate concentration is difficult, due to its sensitivity to changes in the environment. Exact control of nitrate under commercial conditions may require transient corrective measures, such as N-interruption, in conjunction with a good plant-nitrate monitoring system...|$|E
40|$|Ultraviolet (UV) -absorbing plastic {{films are}} {{being used as a}} photoselective barrier to control insect vectors and {{associated}} virus diseases in different horticultural crops. A 2 -year experiment was carried out in northeastern Spain (Navarra) to evaluate the impact of a UV-blocking film (AD-IR AV) on the population density of insect pests and the spread of insect-transmitted virus diseases associated with head lettuce [Lactuca sativa (L.) ]. Results showed that the UV-absorbing plastic film did not loose its ability to filter UV radiation after three lettuce crop cycles (14 months). The UV-absorbing plastic film was effective in reducing the abundance and in delaying the colonization of lettuce by aphids [Macrosiphum euphorbiae (Thomas) and Acyrthosiphum lactucae (Passerini) ]. A significant increase in the percentage of marketable plants was achieved under UV-absorbing films due to a {{reduction in the number of}} plants infested by aphids and by insect-transmitted virus diseases (mainly potyviruses). Also the UV-absorbing plastic films were effective in reducing the population density of Frankliniella occidentalis (Pergande) and the spread of tomato spotted wilt virus (TSWV) as well as the population density of the lepidopteran pest, Autographa gamma (L.), a common pest of lettuce in Spain. However, no effective control of the greenhouse whitefly Trialeurodes vaporariorum (Westwood) was achieved.

40|$|Beginning in 2000 and {{continuing}} into 2004, a previously undescribed disease caused significant damage to romaine lettuce (Lactuca sativa) {{in the coastal}} Salinas Valley of California. Symptoms were brownish black, sunken cavities on the crown and upper taproot. Cavities were firm, lacked signs of fungal growth, and resulted in cracking and weakening of the crown. Affected plants were stunted, uneven in growth, and unmarketable. Crisphead lettuce also developed these symptoms, although disease incidence was always lower than that for romaine. A fungus was consistently isolated from cavities. Using morphological features and molecular methods, the fungus was identified as Phoma exigua. Pathogenicity of isolates from romaine and crisphead lettuce was demonstrated on both of these lettuce types. Replicated field studies showed that azoxystrobin, boscalid, and cyprodinil + fludioxonil fungicides effectively controlled the disease.

40|$|Earlier {{studies in}} the horticultural {{production}} area around Buenos Aires (Argentina) indicated that field grown leaf lettuce fertilised with 150 kg N ha- 1 accumulated NO 3 -N in the leaves up to concentrations well above the reference limits adopted by European countries. Previous studies also showed that the planning of sowing dates and a sound management may help overcome nutritional quality problems, reduce risks of environmental pollution and increase {{the efficiency of the}} system. As an aid to crop planning, a management decision-tool is being developed following a modelling approach to predict growth and quality (i. e. NO 3 content) of field-grown lettuce in the area. The model was conceptually based on that of Seginer et al. (1997) for <b>greenhouse</b> <b>lettuce,</b> in which a negative correlation between C assimilates and NO 3 concentrations in vacuole is used. The first step {{in the development of the}} model was to asses the simplest (and satisfactorily accurate) approach to model growth of a leaf lettuce crop under field conditions relying on few, easily available parameters, and then to identify source-limited conditions along the year. The model was calibrated with data from several experiments in the area. The model predicted crop (R 2 = 0. 97) and plant (R 2 = 0. 98) growth quite accurately when compared with independent data. A first analysis revealed that since leaf lettuce does not need to form a ¿head¿ to be commercially mature, growth can be fairly described by a simple exponential model. NO 3 contents varied widely (from 990 to 7590 ppm) under different growing conditions, suggesting that there is room to model the interaction of factors creating source-limited conditions that eventually lead to NO 3 accumulation in leaves...|$|E
40|$|Latent B. cinerea was {{detected}} in nine symptomless wild host species from the families Asteraceae and Brassicaceae, {{in addition to}} greenhouse grown lettuce. Conventional testing methods revealed that latent B. cinerea was equally prevalent in the root system as the above ground parts. Incidence of latent infection was moderate in some species (Achillea milleforlium, Arabidopsis thaliana, Centraurea nigra, Cirsium vulgare, Senecio jacobaea, Senecio vulgaris and Taraaxacum agg.) and rare in others (Tussilago farfara and Bellis perennis). In <b>greenhouse</b> <b>lettuce,</b> latent infection was activated by prolonged water stress and artificial inoculation. Despite inoculation, unstressed, vigorously growing lettuce and Arabidopsis plants remained asymptomatic throughout the growing period. Fungicide seed treatment did not significantly affect the amount of latent B. cinerea recovered from the lettuce plants. Introduction of antagonistic micro-organism Trichoderma harzianum T- 39 into the soil decreased the amount of latent infection recovered from lettuce leaves but increased it in the stem. A weak negative correlation was found between photosynthesis {{and the amount of}} B. cinerea recovered from the leaves. Weight of the plants was reduced due to inoculation of B. cinerea even though latent infection was unaltered. There was no relation between plant weight and total endophytic B. cinerea. A marginal increase of the phenolic contents of the leaf was observed due to inoculation, but no changes to the antioxidant activity, chlorophyll content or carotenoids were found. The high incidence of latent infection found in greenhouse grown lettuce plants with or without successful inoculation may have been due to the presence of several genetically distinct isolates of B. cinerea. Eight different haplotypes were identified among the 32 isolates assessed. A single very common haplotype presumably originated from seed borne infection, because it was rare in plants grown from fungicide treated seed. Latency may be attributed to a mild strain defence response by the presence of several genetically different strains of the pathogen present within the plant as endophytes.

The application of plant biostimulants such as beneficial microorganisms and plant-derived protein hydrolysates (PHs) may represent an interesting approach for increasing crop tolerance to alkalinity and salinity. The current research aimed at elucidating the agronomical, physiological, and biochemical effects as well as the changes in mineral composition of <b>greenhouse</b> <b>lettuce</b> (Lactuca sativa L.) either untreated or treated with a microbial-based biostimulant (Tablet) containing Rhizophagus intraradices and Trichoderma atroviride alone or in combination with a PH. Plants were sprayed with PH at weekly intervals with a solution containing 2. 5 ml L(- 1) of PH. Lettuce plants were grown in sand culture and supplied with three nutrient solutions: standard, saline (25 mM NaCl) or alkaline (10 mM NaHCO 3 + 0. 5 g l(- 1) CaCO 3; pH 8. 1). Salt stress triggered a decrease in fresh yield, biomass production, SPAD index, chlorophyll fluorescence, leaf mineral composition and increased leaf proline concentration, without altering antioxidant enzyme activities. The decrease in marketable yield and biomass production under alkali stress was not significant. Irrespective of nutrient solution, the application of Tablet and especially Tablet + PH increased fresh marketable yield, shoot and root dry weight. This was associated with an improvement in SPAD index, Fv/Fm ratio, CAT and GPX activities and a better nutritional status (higher P, K, and Fe and lower Na with NaCl and higher P and Fe with NaHCO 3) via an increase of total root length and surface. The combination of microbial biostimulant with foliar application of PH synergistically increased the marketable fresh yield by 15. 5 and 46. 7 % compared to the Tablet-treated and untreated plants, respectively. The improved crop performance of Tablet + PH application was attributed to a better root system architecture (higher total root length and surface), an improved chlorophyll synthesis and an increase in proline accumulation. Combined application of Tablet and PH could represent an effective strategy to minimize alkalinity and salinity stress in a sustainable way...|$|E
40|$|AbstractThe {{environmental}} {{consequences of the}} decision to urbanise and displace peri-urban (PU) food production are not typically evaluated within a comprehensive, cross-sectoral approach. Using a novel application of life cycle assessment (LCA) within exploratory scenarios, a method for integrating housing and food production land uses in PU regions is proposed, based on relative environmental impacts. Using two housing types (greenfield and infill) and two types of food production (field and high-technology <b>greenhouse</b> (HTG) <b>lettuce</b> production), environmental impacts for five exploratory land-use scenarios are compared for PU land in a developed and growing city. Each scenario is able to house an equivalent residential population whilst delivering equal quantities of fresh food to a city market. The results clearly indicate that infill housing and food production has less environmental impact than greenfield development. The environmental impact categories of climate change, freshwater eutrophication, photochemical oxidant formation, particulate matter formation and human toxicity are reduced by 25 – 43 percent under infill scenarios. Sparing PU land through infill housing development combined with sustainable food intensification using HTG production, enabled multifunctional PU land-use including food production, housing and afforestation while delivering lower relative environmental impacts. Urban afforestation on PU land made available by these measures reduces the effect of climate change by up to 5 percent per hectare per year...|$|R

40|$|Subirrigation {{systems in}} which water and {{nutrients}} are supplied to the substrate through wick strips for upward nutrient solution (NS) movement {{can be a}} feasible alternative to improve lettuce quality with low environmental pollution, enabling production with reduced labor and electricity or in regions with high air temperature. The objective {{of this study was}} to compare the performance of two wick irrigation systems using self- compensating troughs filled with either pine bark (WPB) or coconut coir (WCC) with nutrient film technique (NFT) hydroponic system for <b>greenhouse</b> <b>lettuce</b> production. The daily monitoring of electrical conductivity (EC) and pH allowed the experiment management according to the recommended values for optimal lettuce growth. The EC showed variation among troughs and salt accumulation in substrates, with WPB exhibiting two times greater EC than WCC (ranging from 0. 95 to 7. 57 and from 0. 68 to 3. 67 dS. m(- 1), respectively), while the pH values were stable over time. The WCC promoted greater root length and shoot diameter, while WPB produced shorter plants compared to the other two treatments. NFT resulted in an 83 % lower leaf area and 44 % lower root volume than WPB and WCC. The fresh and dry shoot masses with NFT were 58 % and 24 % lower than with WPB and WCC, respectively. The fresh root mass was also reduced in NFT plants, which was 67 % smaller than WCC and 59 % smaller than WPB. Root dry mass of NFT was 35 % lower than the average of WPB and WCC. Nitrate (NO 3) - nitrogen (N), ammonium (NH 4) - N, phosphorus (P), potassium (K), calcium (Ca), magnesium (Mg), sulfur (S), boron (B), copper (Cu), iron (Fe), manganese (Mn), and zinc (Zn) concentrations in plant shoot and root at the end of the experiment as well as the same nutrients, chloride, sodium, and bicarbonate concentrations in substrate and NS determined weekly differed among the treatments (P < 0. 01). The EC and nutrient concentration in the substrates increased over time. The wick irrigation system with both substrates resulted in higher productivity than NFT, with higher yield and plant quality in WCC, indicating its feasibility as an alternative system for lettuce production in greenhouses. However, due to the salinity buildup, water and nutrition management needs to be optimized for self- compensating troughs to avoid an increase in substrate EC over time...|$|E
40|$|The {{mandate of}} CTA is to diffuse information, {{which it has}} been doing {{in a variety of}} ways ever since it was established. In this {{interview}} with Thiendou Niang, Documentation Chief, we learn more about the role that the Question and Answer Service (QAS) plays in this regard. Niang: CTA itself is really one big QAS at the disposal of ACP countries. As you know, the Third Lome Convention stipulates that CTA must ensure, at the request of ACP countries, the diffusion of agricultural information (Article 37), and this is the basis of all our activities. In establishing this information service, CTA wanted to be able to respond to specific requests originating from ACP countries. Our seminars and publications are excellent ways of diffusing information, but they must be complemented by a service that can satisfy the needs of special target groups. SPORE: Wasn't your establishment of a QAS an implicit acknowledgement that traditional information centres have not been able to meet the real demand from people in the field? Niang: I would prefer to talk about the problems that these centres face. They don't always have the means, given often insufficient budgets and limited staffs, to do all that is expected of them. Some were created without being able to benefit from a preliminary analysis of the needs in the field and so may not be adapted to real needs. SPORE: CTA's QAS is currently expanding. How do you account for its success in view of the failure of other services? Niang: It's true that there has been an exponential growth. In 1986, we received 761 publication requests and 325 questions compared with 3, 664 publication requests and 1, 962 questions in 1987, five times more! CTA's success in this field is based primarily on its ability to make use of existing information sources. Another satisfying result is that users of our QAS give us good publicity, which makes us believe that they appreciate our services. SPORE: What resources do you have to work with? Niang: First of all, we have a team of advisers experienced in the fields of research, technology, training, extension work and documentation. We have also gradually built up a network of outside experts that we rely on for specific advice. We have also established a reference library that includes files on the main information sources in this field. At the technical level, CTA is tied in with the main agricultural data bases (AGRIS, AGRICOLA, CABI IBISCUS, etc.) through both the DIMDI and ESA systems. This is made possible by a substantial budget that has been allocated to our QAS: 150, 000 ECU in 1987 and 225, 000 ECU in 1988. SPORE: Who makes use of your service and what kind of questions do they ask? Niang: An analysis of the requests shows that our users are very diverse in terms of their jobs, origin and interests. The questions are put by professional categories as varied as researchers, extension workers, trainers, farmers, documentalists, planners and decision-makers. Their fields of interest revolve mainly around crop and livestock production, agroforestry, rural economics and sociology, teaching and agricultural equipment. The specific subjects deal with vegetable plants (yams, cassava, African sorrel) oil plants (oil palm, butter tree), f;uits (papaya, melon) and cereals (maize and wheat). While the QAS is at the disposal of the 66 ACP countries and citizens of the 12 EEC countries who are working in these areas, some countries make more use of it than others. Benin, Cote d'lvoire, Ghana, Kenya Nigeria, Senegal and the Sudan are our main clients. That is probably the result of word of mouth contact. Most questions are asked in order to solve a practical problem, assist a research programme, or improve a development project. Some of the information provided is also used to expand or improve basic knowledge, in which case it can be considered as part of a continuing education programme. SPORE: How do you set about answerinq questions? Niang: There are numerous ways in which we provide information. First, a reception service analyses the question and sends it on to the most appropriate information source. Second, a bibliographic service uses our documentation and data bank resources to provide references, by subject or author. Access to basic documents is a third type of service, through which copies of original articles are provided thanks to the cooperation of the British Library Document Supply, the French Office for the Development of Agricultural Products (BDPA), CABI in the UK, the French National Centre for Scientific Research (CNRS), and PUDOC in the Netherlands. Finally there is the technical advice provided by our team of advisers and outside consultants mentioned above. SPORE: How much does it cost to use your service and how long does it take? Niang: Although it costs between 35 - 185 USD per question, CTA provides this service free of charge to eligible users (see above) and the turn-around time, which depends on the complexity of the question, can be up to six weeks. SPORE: Some questions must be difficult to answer! Niang: That's true, and I wouldn't want our success to hide the fact. The major problem is in the formulation of the question. In certain cases, we have very little information on either the person asking it (educational level, experience, profession, languages used, etc.) or the project that it is designed to help. In order to respond well, it is important to know what information has already been used, the region concerned, and any deadlines involved. SPORE: Has such direct contact with people in the field affected the direction of CTA's other work? Niang: Of course. The QAS is one of the barometers of information needs in ACP countries. The analysis of questions posed enables us to orient our programme development. In 1987, for example, we received numerous requests dealing with subjects as diverse as water supply, jojoba, snails and other molluscs the breeding of small ruminants, and the motivation of local groups. Our Technical Division also bears this in mind for the selection of feature articles published by SPORE, for CTA's other publications and for organising technical workshops. The QAS can also influence the direction of research programmes. A request from Trinidad for information on Scatella, an insect which threatens <b>greenhouse</b> <b>lettuce,</b> revealed the near-absence of references on this subject and thus identified a useful research area SPORE: Is it really cost-effective to invest so much time and energy to respond to a single request? Have you thought about disseminating your answers to a larger audience? Niang: Of course. In 1987, for example, CTA received many questions on row cropping. As a result, I published an article on agroforestry in The Courier (No. 103, May/June 1987) to direct those interested to the appropriate information sources and to encourage more dialogue between researchers and practitioners of agricultural development. We sometimes get the same question from different people. For example, questions on mango processing were received from an NGO in Mali, a government agency in Senegal and a West German expert. In this case, our research efforts were spread between three clients which, of course, was very cost-effective. SPORE: Are you not afraid that you may be creating more demand than you will be able to handle? Niang: I certainly don't want to see CTA submerged by requests. That is why we are also working on improving the information services of ACP countries, both at the training and documentation use levels. In this regard, we organise an annual course on agricultural information sources whose objective is to teach documentalists where and how to find information, thereby improving the quality and capacity of such services. In conjunction with CABI and CIRAD, CTA is now preparing a directory of Agricultural Information Services in ACP countries as a follow-up to the directory of European Information Sources on Tropical Agriculture. It is designed to encourage South/South communication in this field As you can see, CTA now plays an intermediary role, but our long-term goal is to facilitate direct contact between information sources and users. In this regard, the QAS is sort of a catalyst, or even better, an 'enzyme'that provokes and accelerates such interactionThe mandate of CTA is to diffuse information, which it has been doing {{in a variety of ways}} ever since it was established.

40|$|In {{this paper}} {{influence}} of greenhouses' structure was estimated for four different double plastic covered <b>greenhouses</b> in winter <b>lettuce</b> production. Plastic coverings are introduced as mean {{of making this}} kind of plant production more efficient. Also, as a mean of lowering energy consumption, the tunnel structures are proposed. Four different double plastic covered greenhouses were used for energy analysis. Two tunnel types, 9 x 58 m and 8 x 25 m covered with double PE folia, and two gutter connected plastic covered greenhouses. One greenhouse is 2 x 7 m wide and 39 m long and the other 20 x 6. 4 m wide and 42 m long. Results have shown the lowest energy consumption for gutter connected greenhouses. Energy out/in ratio was also higher in gutter connected greenhouse. Highest energy consumption was obtained in tunnel greenhouse 8 x 25 m...|$|R
40|$|Many naturally-derived {{products}} {{are used as}} growth promoters or biostimulants on vegetables, even if their mechanisms of action are not still now completely clarified. Among them, seaweeds and seaweed {{products are}} inserted as admissible organic fertilizers in the Annex I of the Reg. (EC) No. 889 / 2008, even if their biostimulant properties are not recognized in organic farming. After a previous bioassay on maize germination for defining the optimal water dilution ratios of the filtrate seaweed extract (FSE), in the present research we applied the FSE at two diluted doses to a <b>greenhouse</b> organic <b>lettuce,</b> for assessing its biostimulant effect on vegetable growth and nutrient uptake. The greenhouse pot trials were conducted on Lactuca sativa L., by applying FSE at 1 / 250 and 1 / 500 v/v water dilutions. After 90 days, root fresh/dry weight, shoot fresh/dry weight and dry matter, number of leaves, LAI, specific leaf fresh/dry weight, total dry biomass, leaf macro and micro elements (P, K, Ca, Mg, Fe, Na, Mn, Cu, Zn, B) content and total chlorophyll were determined. Obtained results indicated that FSE {{plays a role in}} promoting the increase of lettuce shoot dry weight and related nutrient uptake, with particular efficacy in relation to P and K macroelements. This property is better expressed at the highest dilution, confirming that the biostimulating activity of the formulate acts without any nutritional effect: thus, the FSE appears to be a good opportunity for promoting the early-stage development for organic nursery production...|$|R
40|$|Nickel (Ni) is {{the most}} {{recently}} discovered essential element for higher plants. But there is limited information {{about the effect of}} this element on yield and nitrogen (N) metabolism of different plants. In this research, the interaction of Ni supplement and N source was studied on nitrate accumulation and growth of lettuce (Lactuca sativa L. cv. Baker) in solution culture. In a <b>greenhouse</b> experiment, <b>lettuce</b> plants were exposed to two Ni levels (0 and 0. 04 µM in the form of NiCl 2) and three N levels (5, 10, and 20 µM in the form of urea and ammonium nitrate). The plants were harvested 6 weeks after transplanting and the fresh weight of shoots and roots, total N concentration, nitrate concentration and Fe content of shoots were determined. The results indicated that shoot and root fresh weight of nitrate-fed plants were higher than urea-fed plants. Ni nutrition significantly enhanced the yield of urea-fed plants. The shoot nitrate concentration in nitrate-fed plants was significantly greater in comparison with urea-fed plants. On the other hand, nitrate concentration in the shoots of lettuce plants decreased significantly with Ni nutrition. Ni supplementation in urea-fed plants increased the shoot Fe content. The shoot concentration of total-N in the urea-fed plants increased with the Ni supplement. While, Ni had no significant effect on shoot concentration of total-N in the nitrate-fed plants. Addition of low levels of Ni to the nutrient solution, particularly to the urea-containing solution, improved the yield of lettuce. In addition, these plant leaves are safer for human consumption because the shoot nitrate content is significantly reduced by application of Ni...|$|R
40|$|Investigations {{were carried}} out under <b>greenhouse</b> {{conditions}} on <b>lettuce</b> cv. Ilanka. Seeds were sown in January 1982 and 1984. Lettuce was cultivated to middle of June up to full flowering time. It {{was found that the}} preparation fenoprop (2, 4, 5 -trichlorofenoxypropionic acid as a dimethylamine salt) in concentrations of 10, 20 and 50 mg·dm - 3 significantly decreased latex tipburn symptoms. Fenoprop increased the healthiness of the plants because treated plants were also less attacked by grey mould Botritis sp. Fenoprop also inhibited head formation in lettuce, but the weight of these plants was never smaller than control ones. Sometimes the weight of plants treated with fenoprop was significantly higher than of the control plants. Lettuce plants without heads had bolted earlier. Only the concentration of 100 mg·dm - 3 of fenoprop retarded plant growth. The effect of K-NAA (potassium salt of α-naphthaleneacetic acid) on lettuce was weaker than the effect of fenoprop. After K-NAA treatment at a concentration of 25 mg·dm - 3, lettuce plants formed normal heads but latex tipburn symptoms were retarded...|$|R
