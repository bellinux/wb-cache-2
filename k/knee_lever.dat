5000|$|The <b>knee</b> <b>lever</b> {{to replace}} the hand stop for the damper control was {{developed}} in Germany sometime around 1765. According to David Crombie, [...] "virtually all the fortepianos {{of the last three}} decades of the eighteenth century were equipped with a <b>knee</b> <b>lever</b> to raise and lower the dampers ...|$|E
5000|$|Mark II Thinline: EC, 10 strings, E9 {{chromatic}} tuning, 1 <b>knee</b> <b>lever,</b> 3 foot pedals, Roman numeral position markers, chrome tuners, {{one single}} coil pickup, 1/4" [...] output jack, {{red and black}} covering ...|$|E
5000|$|Opening {{and closing}} the bellows {{reportedly}} engage an effect {{similar to the}} [...] "tone boost" [...] <b>knee</b> <b>lever</b> on Combo Compact model organs. The Transicord can also be equipped with the same volume pedal used for many other Farfisa organs.|$|E
50|$|After their invention, pedals did not {{immediately}} become the accepted form for piano stops. German and Viennese builders continued to use the <b>knee</b> <b>levers</b> {{for quite some time}} after the English were using pedals. Pedals and <b>knee</b> <b>levers</b> were even used together on the same instrument on a Nannette Streicher grand built in Vienna in 1814. This piano had two <b>knee</b> <b>levers</b> which were Janissary stops for bell and drum, and four pedals for una corda, bassoon, dampers, and moderator.|$|R
50|$|The {{first step}} up from this is a {{professional}} S-10 with three or more pedals and four or five <b>knee</b> <b>levers,</b> and the most common next step up is to a D-10 with eight pedals and five <b>knee</b> <b>levers.</b> The D-10 {{is the most common}} configuration for professional players.|$|R
5000|$|In about 1948, Paul Bigsby {{began making}} custom pedal steel guitars that {{featured}} pedals mounted to a rack between the front {{legs of the}} instrument. Speedy West got the second of Bigsby's creations, {{the first of his}} guitars to feature pedals, and used it extensively in his work with Jimmy Bryant. Zane Beck began adding <b>knee</b> <b>levers</b> to console steel guitars, and in 1952, added a set of four <b>knee</b> <b>levers</b> to Ray Noren's console steel. [...] Beck's <b>knee</b> <b>levers</b> lowered the pitches of the strings they operated, which was an action opposite of what the pedals accomplished.|$|R
50|$|A device {{similar to}} the sustain pedal in effect was invented by the piano pioneer Gottfried Silbermann; it was {{operated}} by the player's hands rather than a pedal. A later eminent early builder, Johann Andreas Stein, {{may have been the}} first to allow the player to lift the dampers while still playing; his device was controlled by a <b>knee</b> <b>lever.</b>|$|E
50|$|Stein {{may have}} been the first to produce a fully {{functional}} damper pedal, in which the player can lift all the dampers from the strings. Such a device had been devised by Stein's predecessor Gottfried Silbermann, but Silbermann's device required the use of the player's hands to work, and thus could only be deployed during pauses in the music. Stein's device was controlled by a <b>knee</b> <b>lever,</b> pushing upward on the lower surface of the instruments, permitting the full equivalent of modern piano pedaling.|$|E
50|$|The Pianet L has a stepped {{rectangular}} case profile with no lid. It has black {{tubular steel}} legs that mount to {{the underside of}} the case. It has a black painted aluminium fascia panel below the keys. This panel also performs the key levelling function. The keys are injection moulded plastic. It has a transistorised pre-amplifier and amplifier and a <b>knee</b> <b>lever</b> for volume control. It plays through two small internal speakers or through an external amplifier.Available as model L - mains voltage, and model LB - powered by 5 'D' batteries.|$|E
5000|$|Emmons {{incorporated}} a third pedal to his setup, {{based on a}} change Ralph Mooney made to his instrument. In 1957, Emmons joined forces with another steel-playing machinist named Harold [...] "Shot" [...] Jackson to form the Sho-Bud company, the first pedal steel guitar manufacturer. Sho-Bud guitars {{incorporated a}}ll the innovations from the 1950s, including ten strings, Emmons's third pedal, and Beck's <b>knee</b> <b>levers.</b> The single-neck pedal steel guitar was now standardized with three pedals and (up to) four <b>knee</b> <b>levers.</b>|$|R
50|$|The {{standard}} student pedal steel guitar is a single-neck ten-string instrument {{with three}} pedals and {{from one to}} five <b>knee</b> <b>levers,</b> tuned to E9 tuning.|$|R
50|$|Fortepianos {{from the}} start often had devices similar to the pedals of modern pianos, but these were not always pedals; {{sometimes}} hand stops or <b>knee</b> <b>levers</b> were used instead.|$|R
50|$|The Cembalet C has a case profile with a taper {{towards the}} front. It has tapered {{cylindrical}} legs that mount to {{the underside of}} the case. It has a gold hammertone painted aluminium fascia panel below the keys with a lock fitted centrally. This panel also performs the key levelling function. The keys are injection moulded plastic. The word 'Cembalet C & CH' appears in gold facing upward on the left hand end of the music support ledge. The ledge includes a formed recess for the bottom of the music. It has a transistorised pre-amplifier and a <b>knee</b> <b>lever</b> for volume control.|$|E
50|$|The {{essential}} {{function of}} the soft pedal was invented by Bartolomeo Cristofori, {{the inventor of the}} piano. On some of his pianos, it was possible to move the hammer mechanism so that the hammers struck just one of the two strings per note. Cristofori's mechanism was a hand stop, necessitating a free hand for its use. By Mozart's time (see Fortepiano), mechanisms had been invented that permitted the same function to be carried out by a <b>knee</b> <b>lever</b> (located below the keyboard), and in the late 18th century the pedal mechanism familiar to us today was introduced.|$|E
50|$|The Cembalet LH has a case profile with a taper {{towards the}} front. It has tapered {{cylindrical}} legs that mount to {{the underside of}} the case. It has a gold hammertone painted aluminium fascia panel below the keys with a lock fitted centrally. This panel also performs the key levelling function. The keys are injection moulded plastic. The word 'Cembalet LH' appears in gold facing upward on the left hand end of the music support ledge. The ledge includes a formed recess for the bottom of the music. It has a transistorised pre-amplifier, a small transistorised power amplifier, two small speakers like Pianet L and a <b>knee</b> <b>lever</b> for volume control.|$|E
50|$|The pedals and/or <b>knee</b> <b>levers</b> (engaged {{by moving}} the knees left, right or vertically) on the {{underside}} allow the performer to tighten or relax one or more strings in combination to specific tuned notes, changing the instrument's tuning during performance.|$|R
5000|$|The {{distinctive}} feature of pedal steel guitars are the namesake pedals {{as well as}} <b>knee</b> <b>levers.</b> The pedals are mounted on a cross bar below {{the body and the}} <b>knee</b> <b>levers</b> extend {{from the bottom of the}} guitar's body and stretch or slacken the strings to change pitch as the guitar is played. The most common uses for the pedals and <b>knee</b> <b>levers</b> are raising the chord up a fourth without moving the bar, lowering the third of the chord to change the chord from a major to a minor, and lowering one of the root notes a whole step to produce a diminished seventh chord. Before the introduction of pedals on steel guitars these effects could only be created by carefully slanting the steel bar in the left hand.The action of the pedals may be fixed or may be configurable by the player to select which strings the pedals affect. While there are some fairly standard pedal assignments, many advanced players devise their own setups, called copedents. The range of copedents that can be set up varies considerably from guitar to guitar. Aftermarket modifications to make additional copedents possible are common.|$|R
50|$|Fender began {{producing}} the 1000 in 1957. It was marketed alongside its single-neck sibling, the Fender 400 At {{the time it}} was an innovative instrument but was quickly made obsolete as pedal steel players began to standardize on Emmons and Day setups requiring ten strings and <b>knee</b> <b>levers</b> in addition to pedals.|$|R
50|$|The Pianet C has a case profile with a taper {{towards the}} front. It has tapered {{cylindrical}} legs that mount to {{the underside of}} the case. It has a gold hammertone painted aluminium fascia panel below the keys with a lock fitted centrally. This panel also performs the key levelling function. The keys are injection moulded plastic. The word 'Pianet' or 'Pianet C' appears in gold facing upward on the left hand end of the music support ledge. The ledge includes a formed recess for the bottom of the music. It has a transistorised pre-amplifier, a <b>knee</b> <b>lever</b> for volume control and optional vibrato effect.|$|E
50|$|Dipl. Ing. Ernst Zacharias, {{inventor}} of the Cembalet, Pianet & Clavinet told us the very first Pianet series was called just Pianet. It has a case profile with a taper towards the front. It has tapered cylindrical legs that mount to {{the underside of the}} case. It has a gold hammertone painted aluminium fascia panel below the keys. This panel also performs the key levelling function. The keys are injection moulded plastic. The word 'Pianet' appears in gold facing upward on the left hand end of the music support ledge. The ledge includes a formed recess for the bottom of the music. It has a valve pre-amplifier and a <b>knee</b> <b>lever</b> for volume control.|$|E
5000|$|As a {{composer}} and pianist, Beethoven experimented extensively with pedal. His first marking to indicate {{use of a}} pedal in a score was {{in his first two}} piano concertos, in 1795. Earlier than this, Beethoven had called {{for the use of the}} <b>knee</b> <b>lever</b> in a sketch from 1790-92; [...] "with the knee" [...] is marked for a series of chords. According to Joseph Banowetz, [...] "This is the earliest-known indication for a damper control in a score". Haydn did not specify its use in a score until 1794. All in all, there are nearly 800 indications for pedal in authentic sources of Beethoven's compositions, making him by far the first composer to be highly prolific in pedal usage.|$|E
50|$|Professional {{instruments}} are normally custom-made to order. Even {{in the case}} of an S-10, while the first three pedals and five <b>knee</b> <b>levers</b> are fairly standard in function, there are variations to the order of these and many players add others. Advanced players of all configurations tend to design their own individual setups, known as copedents, specifying the exact string tunings and gauges and the actions of the pedals and levers.|$|R
5000|$|A {{variable}} volume {{foot pedal}} contributes to various sonic effects. A prominent technique {{is to eliminate}} the attack of the string. The player plucks a string with the volume pedal in the off position, then quickly rocks the pedal forward to create a smooth violin-like sound. The player uses the pedals and <b>knee</b> <b>levers</b> to raise and lower the pitch of certain strings [...] "on the fly" [...] while playing.|$|R
5000|$|Electric lap steel guitars : {{which include}} the first commercially {{successful}} solid body instruments. These were originally marketed as electric Hawaiian guitars. In addition to the lap-played model, a closely related version called a console steel guitar is supported on legs (but {{does not include the}} pedals or <b>knee</b> <b>levers</b> of the pedal steel guitar). Electric lap steels typically have six or 8 and up to ten strings.|$|R
50|$|In 1974-5, Michigan steel guitarist Larry Bell adopted Maurice Anderson's tuning {{and quickly}} made changes toward {{incorporating}} {{more of the}} Nashville E9 sound by including pedal and <b>knee</b> <b>lever</b> changes (e.g., the 'C' pedal from E9 which Anderson had not incorporated into Bb6) and raising the entire tuning 1/2 step to B6/E9. Once the Winston/Keith book was published, Bell was influenced to continue modifying his tuning by changing the 4th and 8th strings from D# to E, developing a 12 string E9/B6 tuning which had elements of Maurice Anderson's tuning and also elements of what Jeff Newman eventually published in his series of teaching materials. See http://www.larrybell.org for a more in-depth treatment of the tuning as used by Larry Bell.|$|E
5000|$|Americus's other {{innovation}} was {{to mount}} his instrument {{on a dedicated}} three-legged trestle stand. The two front legs of this stand incorporated linkages to the instrument from two pedals. The left pedal when depressed caused the whole keyboard and action to slide to the right against a return spring mounted inside the case. This caused the hammers to strike {{only one of the}} strings in its normal trichord and is now generally known as the [...] "una corda". (In Cristofori's original design and in the Viennese pianos of the 18th Century, the una corda was operated by a <b>knee</b> <b>lever</b> since many pianos, like harpsichords, were not supplied with a dedicated stand and might be mounted on a convenient chest or cupboard).|$|E
50|$|The Cembalet & Cembalet I has a {{rectangular}} case profile with no taper towards the front. It has a gold lid lift bar fitted {{to the front}} of the lid. It has tapered cylindrical wooden legs with gold ferrules at the foot that mount to angled blocks on the underside of the case. It has a wooden fascia panel below the keys with a central lid lock. The keys are wood with conventional plastic laminates for the top and front. Later Cembalet I used plastic keys. The word 'Cembalet I' appears in gold facing upward on the left hand end of the music support ledge. The ledge includes a formed recess for the bottom of the music. It has a valve pre-amplifier and a <b>knee</b> <b>lever</b> for volume control.|$|E
50|$|Silbermann is {{credited}} with {{the invention of the}} forerunner of the sustain pedal, which removes the dampers from all the strings at once, permitting them to vibrate freely. Silbermann's device was in fact only a hand stop, and thus could be changed only at a pause in the music. Throughout the Classical era, even when the more flexible <b>knee</b> <b>levers</b> or pedals had been installed, the lifting of all the dampers was used primarily as a coloristic device.|$|R
5000|$|Sometime around 1777, Mozart had an {{opportunity}} to play a piano built by Johann Andreas Stein, who had been an apprentice of Gottfried Silbermann. This piano had <b>knee</b> <b>levers,</b> and Mozart speaks highly of their functionality in a letter: [...] "The machine which you move with the knee is also made better by Stein than by others. I scarcely touch it, when off it goes; and as soon as I take my knee the least bit away, you can't hear the slightest after-sound".|$|R
50|$|Jean Germain II (1735 - c.1795) was {{the eldest}} son of the above, and became known as a dealer of {{harpsichord}}s and harps {{as well as a}} harpsichord teacher. He lived in Paris. He dealt mainly in Flemish ravalements of Ruckers instruments, popular in France at the time; the adaptations to the original harpsichords included <b>knee</b> <b>levers</b> for changing stops, and an enlarged range. In 1778 he advertised a Ruckers ravalement which went as far as 'producing the effect of the Flute, Oboe and Vox humana'.|$|R
50|$|Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart {{bought a}} Walter piano in about 1782, and {{employed}} {{it in one}} of the most important phases of his career, the composition and highly successful premieres of his mature piano concertos (see: Mozart piano concertos). In 1800 (nine years after Mozart's death), this instrument was modified by Walter. It survives today (and is kept in Mozart's birth home in Salzburg), but cannot provide reliable testimony for Mozart's own performance practice, due to Walter's modifications. Most pertinently, we cannot know whether Mozart was able to raise the dampers during playing using a <b>knee</b> <b>lever</b> (the equivalent of the modern damper pedal) or had to make use of a hand stop at keyboard level, which would have necessitated a free hand. A Walter instrument in Nuremberg, dated 1790 by Kottick and Lucktenberg, uses hand stops.|$|E
5000|$|Érard's {{grand piano}} action (English patent no 4,631, 1821) is the {{predecessor}} {{to those used}} in modern grands. The repetition lever in these [...] "double escapement" [...] actions allows notes to be repeated more easily than in single actions. It {{is just one of}} many Érard innovations still found on modern pianos - for example, Érard was the first maker in Paris to fit pedals on the piano, and his instrument had several pedals. There was the usual sustaining pedal, an action shift, a celeste, and a bassoon pedal (which put leather against the strings to make them buzz). A <b>knee</b> <b>lever</b> moved the action further than the action-shift pedal, making the hammers strike only one string. Other Érard piano patents deal mainly with technicalities of the keyboard action, soundboard, and tuning mechanism; virtually all of these innovations are retained in modern piano design.|$|E
50|$|One {{measuring}} device is {{placed at the}} surface of the sonde, the identical second of the pair is placed a necessary distance off the body of the sonde by unfolding a 1 m long boom (carbon composite tube). Two redundant pyrotechnical cutters cut one loop of thin rope to free the power of metal springs. The driven <b>knee</b> <b>lever</b> rotates the boom perpendicularly outwards and latches it in place. Only the use of a pair of sensors together with the rotation of the sonde allows to resolve the small natural magnetic field beneath the fields of the disturbing fields of the probe itself. The measurements to identify the fields produced by the craft took place on the route from Earth to Venus. The lack of magnetic cleanness was due to the reuse of the Mars Express spacecraft bus which did not carry a magnetometer. By combining the data from two-point simultaneous measurements and using software to identify and remove interference generated by Venus Express itself, it was possible to obtain results of a quality comparable to those produced by a magnetically clean craft.|$|E
50|$|Some {{advanced}} players {{prefer to}} remain on an S-10 configuration, perhaps adding more pedals and/or <b>knee</b> <b>levers.</b> Other advanced players progress from the S-10 to a single neck instrument with twelve strings, either a U-12 which uses a universal tuning, or an S-12 which uses an extended E-9 tuning. Single neck instruments with more than twelve strings also exist, such as the fifteen-string universal tuning U-15, and double-neck with more than ten strings per neck, notably the D-12 with two twelve-string necks and various tunings most commonly based on extended E9 and extended C6 tunings.|$|R
40|$|Before World War II, most composers notated {{relatively}} few pedal indications, usually to create unsuspected effects. Mutations (Veranderungen) {{on the early}} pianos and the uses of hand stops, <b>knee</b> <b>levers,</b> and pedals are discussed based on information from extant instruments, composers 2 ̆ 7 autographs, and comments in tutors by such teachers as Johann Milchmeyer and Louis Adam. Pedaling techniques and uses of the damper, una corda, and sostenuto pedals on the changing instruments of the 19 th and 20 th c. are described, with particular attention to compositions of Beethoven, Schumann, Chopin, Brahms, Debussy, Villa-Lobos, Boulez, Cage, and Stockhausen...|$|R
50|$|A pedal steel guitar is {{typically}} rectangular {{and has no}} specific resonant chamber or conventional guitar body but only one or more guitar necks. These are mounted on a stand and equipped with foot pedals and usually <b>knee</b> <b>levers.</b> Many models feature two necks, the nearer to the player most often using a C6 tuning and the farther away using an E9 tuning. The most common configuration is one or two necks of ten strings each, but eight-string and twelve-string necks are also popular, and even models with 14 strings on one neck can be found. Three-neck instruments are less common than those with one or two, but are not unknown.|$|R
