40|$|Discovery {{of complex}} Ca II H and K <b>interstellar</b> <b>line</b> {{profiles}} towards stars {{embedded in the}} giant H II region surrounding Eta Carinae led to a reconnaissance of the richer ultraviolet (UV) <b>interstellar</b> <b>line</b> spectrum. Single International Ultraviolet Explorer (IUE) spectra were secured for those stars exhibiting the greatest variety of structure in the optical interstellar lines, namely, HD 93130, 93160, 93162, 93204, 93205, 93206 and HDE 303308. Appraisal of the spectra suggests that: (1) longwards of Lyman Alpha many of the interstellar lines, including an unidentified one, in the spectrum of Zeta Oph seem {{to be present in}} the Carina Nebula spectra; (2) <b>interstellar</b> <b>line</b> structure varies widely in both velocity and intensity throughout the region, as well as along a given line of sight as the species change; (3) new high velocity components of UV lines appear to extend the total range of velocities in the nebular interstellar lines to about 400 m/s; and (4) lines of the high excitation species Si IV and C IV are strong and also structured in velocity space...|$|E

40|$|Observations {{of optical}} <b>interstellar</b> {{absorption}} <b>lines</b> of Ti II, Ca II, and/or Na I acquired at an instrumental resolution typically of 5. 6 km/s are reported for 29 stars. The data were recorded primarily with a Digicon detector and achieve 2 sigma detection limits generally near an equivalent width of 1 mA. The {{primary purpose of}} the observations is, in combination with previously published data, to provide a comprehensive, high-sensitivity survey of Ti II, Ca II, and Na I absorption at all velocities, toward 41 stars for which a correspondingly complete survey of certain ultraviolet <b>interstellar</b> <b>lines</b> also is available.

40|$|It {{is shown}} that the {{combined}} equivalent widths for a large population of Gaussian-like <b>interstellar</b> <b>line</b> components, each with different central optical depths tau(0) and velocity dispersions b, exhibit a curve of growth (COG) which closely mimics that of a single, pure Gaussian distribution in velocity. Two parametric distributions functions for the line populations are considered: a bivariate Gaussian for tau(0) and b and a power law distribution for tau(0) combined with a Gaussian dispersion for b. First, COGs for populations having an extremely large number of nonoverlapping components are derived, and the implications are shown {{by focusing on the}} doublet-ratio analysis for a pair of lines whose f-values differ by a factor of two. The consequences of having, instead of an almost infinite number of lines, a relatively small collection of components added together for each member of a doublet are examined. The theory of how the equivalent widths grow for populations of overlapping Gaussian profiles is developed. Examples of the composite COG analysis applied to existing collections of high-resolution <b>interstellar</b> <b>line</b> data are presented...|$|E

Results are presented for observations of <b>interstellar</b> <b>lines</b> of C III, C IV, N V, Si III, and Si IV. Strong lines of Si IV or C IV are seen toward 11 stars. The strengths of these lines are inconsistent with their formation in the same hot gas responsible for the <b>interstellar</b> O IV <b>lines</b> observed with the Copernicus ultraviolet spectrometer. Comparison with simple models of the ionization structures of H II regions around hot stars suggests that the observed column densities of Si III, Si IV, and C IV are in harmony with those expected in normal photoionized nebulae. The line of sight to HD 93250, and O 3 V star near Eta Carinae, passes through highly ionized gas that shows features spanning 250 km/s in radial velocity.

40|$|Spectroscopy {{has been}} crucial for our {{understanding}} of physical and chemical phenomena. The interpretation of <b>interstellar</b> <b>line</b> spectra with radiative transfer calculations usually requires two kinds of molecular input data: spectroscopic data (such as energy levels, statistical weights, transition probabilities, etc.) and collision data. This contribution describes how such data are collected, stored, and which limitations exist. Also, here we summarize challenges of atomic/molecular databases and point out our experiences, problems, etc., which we are faced with.

The motions of the low-ionization gas is focused on. Large systematic velocities are found, and a pronounced asymmetry in the absorption characteristics of halo gas toward the Galactic poles is indicated. In the north, substantial amounts of material are falling toward the disk at velocities up to about 120 km/s in the most extreme case. Toward the south, low-ionization material shows no extreme or systematic motions...|$|E
40|$|Interstellar spectra toward zeta Oph {{acquired}} {{with the}} Goddard High-Resolution Spectrograph {{were used to}} obtain oscillator strengths for approximately two dozen S I lines. This analysis was possible because precisely determined experimental oscillator strengths are available for several multiplets, including one with a weak <b>interstellar</b> <b>line.</b> The self-consistent set of oscillator strengths then was obtained from a curve of growth based on line strengths spanning a range of a factor of 100. The derived f-values {{for a number of}} multiplets differ from values quoted by Morton (1991) but are generally consistent with the suite of available experimental and theoretical results...|$|E

A complex set of interactive computer programs has been developed for the efficient analysis of the IUE data, which is described along with results on Si II column densities toward two moderately reddened stars. Silicon depletions are inferred in the cases of the two stars, HD 42088 and HD 151804, and their H I column density determinations are used to estimate the total hydrogen column density...|$|E
40|$|Observations are {{reported}} of optical interstellar absorption lines of Ti II, Ca II, and Na I in {{the spectrum of}} HD 14633, a probable runaway O star ejected from the Perseus spiral arm. Unusually high gas-phase abundances of the normally depleted elements Ca and Ti are found in three high-velocity <b>interstellar</b> <b>line</b> components; the light paths to only a few other stars are known to show a comparably strong Routly-Spitzer effect. The greatly reduced heavy-element depletions in these parcels of gas presumably reflect the disruption of interstellar grains in gas which may {{be located in the}} lower galactic halo at an absolute value of 2 of about 1 kpc...|$|E

Variations in gas phase abundance from region to region are found for Fe and Si, similar to variations now known to exist for Ca and Ti based on visible spectra. A new generation of space instruments, with higher efficiency and resolution, in particular for 920 - 1400 A, can provide detailed <b>interstellar</b> <b>line</b> profiles...|$|E

The N V lines can arise in the same gas {{that is responsible for}} the ubiquitous <b>interstellar</b> <b>lines</b> of O VI, observed previously with a Copernicus spectrometer, but the lines of Si IV and C IV must be formed in a cooler gas.

40|$|Abstract. The profile, radial {{velocity}} and equivalent {{width of the}} <b>interstellar</b> <b>lines</b> of Na I (5890. 0, 5895. 9 ˚A) and K I (7699. 0 ˚A) have been obtained from Echelle+CCD observations at resolving power λ / △ λ ∼ 16, 500 for 32 O and early B stars suffering from a reddening between EB−V = 0. 06 and 1. 57. The data {{have been used to}} search for and calibrate a relation between equivalent width and reddening. When the <b>interstellar</b> <b>lines</b> show a single and sharp component, useful relations to estimate reddening from equivalent widths have been derived. The relation for Na I is most sensitive in the range 0. 0 ≤ EB−V ≤ 0. 4, and the one for K I takes over at higher reddening. Good quality equivalent width measurements allow EB−V to be estimated with an accuracy of about 0. 05 mag. For multi–component profiles of Na I and K I lines the estimate of reddening is more ambiguous with a general scatter of 0. 15 mag. Close blends of multiple components allow only an estimate of an upper limit to EB−V. Key words: interstellar medium: atoms – interstellar medium: dust, extinction 1...|$|R

It is probably a blend of a stellar and an <b>interstellar</b> <b>line.</b> The lines suggest turbulence of an appreciable amount. A line at λ 4469. 71 is probably a blend of O II and forbidden He I.

40|$|Observations of {{interstellar}} absorption {{lines in the}} spectra of five stars {{in the direction of}} Tycho's Supernova Remnant are presented. The profiles show significant absorption at large negative velocities, - 50 to - 60 km/s (LSR). This information, together with the distances of the background stars, permits limiting distances to be assigned to the corresponding velocity components in the H I 21 -cm line absorption spectrum of the supernova remnant itself. The 21 -cm absorption line data for Tycho's Supernova Remnant are entirely consistent with a distance as small as 2 kpc. Distances based upon simple kinematic models of galactic rotation can be confused by well-known noncircular motions in this direction.

The line at 5797 A is weak relative to 5780 A in all of the program stars. The suggestion by others that 5780 and 5797 A are due to different sources is confirmed.

The absorption features arising due to photospheric lines are distinctly different from the <b>interstellar</b> <b>lines.</b> The <b>interstellar</b> <b>lines</b> consist of three relatively narrow components at LSR velocities of - 20, 260 and 540 km/s and include absorption by neutral atoms, singly ionized atoms and atoms in higher ionization states. The analysis {{presented in this paper}} consists of (1) a list of all interstellar absorption features with > 3 sigma significance and their measured equivalent widths and (2) plots of the lines in the various atomic species together with the results of non-linear least square fit profiles to the observed data and (3) unpublished 21 -cm maps from the Wakker & van Woerden survey showing the large-scale HI distribution in the region near the NGC 1705 sightline and high velocity cloud HVC 487. Further, I report weak N I 1200 A triplet absorption for the supershell component, which in the absence of dust depletion and ionization corrections implies a low N abundance. A low N abundance for the supershell is consistent with an interpretation of nucleosynthetic enrichment by time-delayed "primary" nitrogen production, the age estimate of 10 - 20 x 10 ^ 6 years for the central superstar cluster NGC 1705 - 1 (Heckman and Leitherer, 1997) and the underabundance of Fe reported by Sahu and Blades (1997) ...|$|R
