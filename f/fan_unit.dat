40|$|Abstract: Alluvial fans in arid and {{semi-arid}} regions {{can provide}} important evidence of geomorphic and climatic changes, which reveal {{the evolution of}} the regional tectonic activity and environment. Synthetic aperture radar (SAR) remote sensing technology, which is sensitive to geomorphic features, {{plays an important role in}} quickly mapping alluvial <b>fan</b> <b>units</b> of different ages. In this paper, RADARSAT- 2 (Canada’s C-band new-generation radar satellite) and ALOS-PALSAR (Japan’s advanced land observing satellite, phased array type L-band SAR sensor) data, acquired over the Shule River Alluvial Fan (SRAF), are used to extract backscattering coefficients, scattering mechanism-related information, and polarimetric characteristic parameters. The correlation between these SAR characteristic parameters and <b>fan</b> <b>units</b> of the SRAF of different ages was studied, and the spatial distribution of <b>fan</b> <b>units,</b> since the Late Pleistocene, was extracted based on the Maximum Likelihood classification method. The results prove that (1) some C-band SAR parameters can describe the geomorphic characteristics of alluvial <b>fan</b> <b>units</b> of different ages in the SRAF; (2) SAR data can be used to map the SRAF’s surface between the Late Pleistocene and the Holocene and to extract the spatial distribution of fan units; and (3) the time-spatial distribution of the SRAF can provide valuable information for tectonic and paleoenvironmental research of the study area...|$|R

Each <b>fan</b> <b>unit</b> comprises a pair of electric motors, one driving a carbon-fibre composite rotor above and the other driving a similar rotor below. A circular duct surrounds both rotors. The batteries and associated control and radio link systems are housed in a central hub at the top of the column, in order to minimise the weight of copper used for the electrical power cabling.

50|$|A second fire {{incident}} {{took place}} in August 2012 when a Karma caught fire while stopped at a parking lot in Woodside, California. According to Fisker engineers, the area of origin for the fire {{was determined to be}} outside the engine compartment, as the fire was located at the driver's side front corner of the car. The evidence suggested that the ignition source was not the lithium-ion battery pack, new technology components or unique exhaust routing. The investigation conducted by Fisker engineers and an independent fire expert concluded that the cause of the fire was a low temperature cooling fan located at the left front of the Karma, forward of the wheel. An internal fault caused the fan to fail, overheat and started a slow-burning fire. Fisker announced a recall to repair the faulty cooling <b>fan</b> <b>unit.</b>|$|E

5000|$|The General Electric X353-5 was an unusual, high bypass ratio, liftfan system {{developed}} for the Ryan XV-5 Vertifan V/STOL research aircraft [...] (known earlier as the VZ-11). Two General Electric J85-5 turbojets were used for propulsion in wing-borne flight. During lift, the exhaust from these turbojets was diverted through ducting {{to a pair of}} vertically mounted turbine/fan units buried in the aircraft wings (one in the starboard wing, the other in the port wing). These turbine/fan units were similar in concept to the aft fan units on the General Electric CJ805 -23, the main difference being that the turbine blades of the X353-5 were outboard of the fan, rather than inboard. Each engine supplied half the exhaust gas needed to drive each <b>fan</b> <b>unit.</b> A cross-over duct kept both fans turning uniformly in the event of either engine failing. The aircraft also had a smaller turbine/fan mounted in the aircraft nose, which was used to control pitch. This pitch fan was similar in design to the main fan units and utilised 10.5% of the gas generator exhaust gas flow. Beneath each fan was a series of spanwise exit louvres, ganged together, which were used to vector the fan thrust in lift mode. Effectively, the bypass ratio was 12.16:1 in lift mode.|$|E

40|$|Abstract—This {{paper was}} {{to study the}} clothes dryer using waste heat from a split type air {{conditioner}} with a capacity of 12, 648 btu/h. The drying chamber had a minimum cross section area {{with the size of}} 0. 5 x 1. 0 m 2. The chamber was constructed by sailcloth and was inside folded with aluminium foil.

The experiment was carried out in two aspects which were the clothes drying with and without auxiliary <b>fan</b> <b>unit.</b> The results showed that the drying rate of clothes in the chamber installed with and without auxiliary <b>fan</b> <b>unit</b> were 2. 26 and 1. 1 kg/h, respectively. In case of the chamber installed with a auxiliary <b>fan</b> <b>unit,</b> the additional power of 0. 011 kWh was consumed and the drying rate was higher than that of clothes drying without auxiliary <b>fan</b> <b>unit.</b> Without auxiliary <b>fan</b> <b>unit</b> installation, no energy was required but there was a portion of hot air leaks away through the punctured holes at the wall of the drying chamber, hence the drying rate was dropped below. The drying rate of clothes drying using waste heat was higher than natural indoor drying and commercial dryer which their drying rate were 0. 17 and 1. 9 kg/h, respectively. It was noted that the COP of the air conditioner did not change during the operating of clothes drying. Keywords—Drying Rate, Clothes Dryer, COP, Air Conditioner. I...|$|E
