40|$|This paper {{describes}} a new application of two laser interferometry techniques into the non-destructive <b>inspection</b> <b>of</b> <b>coated</b> surfaces. The {{purpose is to}} detect interfacial disbond between the coating and the substrate. Debonding is detected by properly exciting {{the surface of the}} object under inspection {{in such a way that}} the interference fringe pattern is modified rendering the disbond readily visible. The fringe patterns resulting from the associated images were captured using Electronic Speckle Pattern Interferometry (ESPI) and Shearography. Image processing techniques are applied to enhance the detection and better definition of the debonded layer. Some results and discussions are presented to illustrate the applicability of these two optical techniques to thermal barrier coatings...|$|R

40|$|The {{knowledge}} of morphological features of species {{can help to}} understand other related biological aspects. In Italy the European pine marten Martes martes seems to show a recent expansion of its distribution, however information on this species in our Country are scarce. Very few data on biometric measurements are available, mainly referred to the Sardinian population, and the only published study on peninsular populations was based exclusively on cranial morphology. For this reasons we aimed to provide external morphological data on thirty-three pine marten in Tuscany, central Italy. In addition, we found that pine marten appear to be quite distinguishable from the sibling species stone marten M. foina by <b>inspection</b> <b>of</b> <b>coat</b> colour and marking pattern, showing that qualitative diagnosis of external morphological traits can be very useful to identify this species in central Italy. In fact, genetic analyses on samples of hair confirmed the correct attribution. Download the complete issue...|$|R
40|$|The disbondment of {{protective}} organic coatings under excessive cathodic protection potentials {{is a widely}} reported coating failure mechanism. Traditional methods of evaluating cathodic disbondment are based on ex situ visual <b>inspection</b> <b>of</b> <b>coated</b> metal surfaces after being exposed to standard cathodic disbondment testing conditions {{for a long period}} of time. Although electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS) has been employed as an effective means of evaluating various anti-corrosion properties of organic coatings; its application for assessing the cathodic disbondment resistance of coatings has not been sufficiently exploited. This paper reports an experimental study aimed at developing EIS into a tool for in situ measurement and monitoring of cathodic disbondment of coatings. A clear correlation between EIS parameters and the disbonded coating areas has been confirmed upon short term exposure of epoxy-coated steel electrodes to cathodic disbondment conditions; however the degree of this correlation was found to decrease with the extension of exposure duration. This observation suggests that EIS loses its sensitivity with the propagation <b>of</b> <b>coating</b> disbondment, and that in order to achieve quantitative determination <b>of</b> the <b>coating</b> cathodic disbondment localized EIS measurements are required to measure the parameters related to local disbonded areas...|$|R
40|$|In this paper, we {{describe}} the <b>inspection</b> <b>of</b> <b>coated</b> particle nuclear fuel using optical microscopy. Each ideally spherical particle possesses four coating layers surrounding a fuel kernel. Kernels are designed with diameters of either 350 or 500 microns and the other four layers, from the kernel outward, are 100, 45, 35, and 45 microns, respectively. The <b>inspection</b> <b>of</b> the particles is undertaken in two phases. In the first phase, multiple particles are imaged via back-lighting in a single 3900 x 3090 image at a resolution of about 1. 12 pixels/micron. The distance transform, watershed segmentation, edge detection, and the Kasa circle fitting algorithm are employed to compute total outer diameters only. In the second inspection phase, the particles are embedded in an epoxy and cleaved (via polishing) to reveal the cross-section structure of all layers simultaneously. These cleaved particles are imaged individually at a resolution of about 2. 27 pixels/micron. We first find points on the kernel boundary and then employ the Kasa algorithm to estimate the overall particle center. We then find boundary points between the remaining layers along rays emanating from the particle center. Kernel and layer boundaries are detected using a novel segmentation approach. From these boundary points, we compute and store layer thickness data...|$|R
40|$|<b>Inspection</b> <b>of</b> <b>coated</b> {{material}} is vital {{in order to}} ensure the integrity of the protective barrier. In some cases, the inspection process is {{complicated by the fact that}} the surface <b>of</b> the protective <b>coating</b> may not be accessible, thus the inspection must proceed with only access to the surface of the opposite side (this will be referred to as the inner surface). One method which can be applied in such a situation is the excitation of guided waves or Lamb waves in the coated material. Lamb waves excited from the inner surface will sense the variation in the coating conditions as well as flaws in the steel plate. Therefore for a correct and unambiguous interpretation of Lamb wave data for corrosion-related flaws, the effects <b>of</b> the <b>coating</b> and how they differ from the effects of corrosion-related flaws must be understood. To this end this paper will concentrate on the effects <b>of</b> the <b>coating</b> and its influence on dispersive characteristics of a soft layer bonded to a steel plate. By calculating the dispersion relations for a bare and coated steel plate and comparing the calculated results, unique new modes are seen to emerge in the coated plate. In addition, the coated plate is also modeled as a thin layer on a halfspace allowing a comparison between the problem <b>of</b> a <b>coated</b> halfspace and a coated plate. The comparison demonstrates that only limited information can be obtained by treating the problem as a layered halfspace. More detailed information can be obtained by treating the problem as a <b>coated</b> plate <b>of</b> finite thickness...|$|R

A deep study {{on the development of}} the decolouration processes of these coatings, applied on rolled steel specimens exposed to total immersion conditions in aqueous solutions with different salinity, has been carried out. The relationship between external salinity and contamination by sodium chloride of the steel/coating interface in the bleaching processes has been analysed.

Periodic visual <b>inspections</b> <b>of</b> the <b>coating</b> films, together with a deep analysis <b>of</b> the <b>coating</b> microstructure, by means of optical microscopy and scanning electron microscopy provided with microsonde analysis, were used.

40|$|Eight {{sites were}} {{selected}} for field evaluation in coperation with the Harbors Division of the Hawaii Department of Transportation. Seven of the sites used a calcium nitrite based admixture as a corrosion inhibitor. The eighth site used epoxy coated reinforcing steel to combat corrosion. Each site was tested for permeability, chloride ion concentration, half-cell potential, polarization resistance, resistivity, and pH. Corrosion activity identified by the half-cell potential measurements, polarization resistance measurements, and visual <b>inspection</b> <b>of</b> bars taken from cores indicated that high dosages of calcium nitrite (4. 0 to 4. 5 gal/yd 3) provided the steel with significantly greater 3 protection than lower dosages (2. 5 gaVyd).

Dissolution tests confirmed that although the nanocoat reduced the dissolution of nanoparticles proportional to the coat thickness; they still dissolved much faster than commercially available micronized powders of the drugs. In addition, increasing the layer thickness (still less than 50 nm thick) by adding more LbL bilayers produced sustained release nanoparticles.
