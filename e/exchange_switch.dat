Ports with 100 Gbit/s are available, for example, at the AMS-IX in Amsterdam and at the DE-CIX in Frankfurt.|$|E
50|$|Strowger also {{filed the}} first patent for a rotary dial in 1891. The first dials worked by direct, forward action. The pulses were sent as the user rotated the dial to the finger stop {{starting}} {{at a different}} position for each digit transmitted. Operating the dial error-free required smooth rotary motion of the finger wheel by the user, but was found as too unreliable. This mechanism was soon refined to include a recoil spring and a centrifugal governor to control the recoil speed. The user selected a digit to be dialed by inserting a finger into the corresponding hole and rotated the dial to the finger stop. When released from this position, the dial pulsing contacts were opened and closed repeatedly, thus interrupting the loop current in a pattern on the return to the home position. The <b>exchange</b> <b>switch</b> decoded the pattern for each digit thus transmitted by stepping relays or by accumulation in digit registers.|$|E

50|$|The {{original}} {{reason for}} adopting CALEA was the Federal Bureau of Investigation's worry that {{increasing use of}} digital telephone <b>exchange</b> <b>switches</b> would make tapping phones at the phone company's central office harder and slower to execute, {{or in some cases}} impossible. Since the original requirement to add CALEA-compliant interfaces required phone companies to modify or replace hardware and software in their systems, U.S. Congress included funding for a limited time period to cover such network upgrades.

During this study period, the number of local <b>exchange</b> <b>switches</b> remained fairly constant in the public switched telephone network. The major result {{of this study is}} that, as a total population, local telecommunication switches exhibited reliability growth during this period, and failure event arrivals may be classified as a nonhomogeneous Poisson process (NHPP).

50|$|In the {{evolution}} of modern telecommunications systems there was a requirement to connect large numbers of low-speed access devices with large telephone company 'central office' switches over common paths.

40|$|<b>Exchanges</b> of <b>switches</b> {{is a time}} {{consuming}} and costly procedure that entails high risks for the contractor while the profit margin is low. The high cost is partly linked to the machine costs, where especially the cranes that lifts switchparts represent a major cost item. The cranes major drawback lies beyond the cost of these, in essence, the cranes can not perform any other activity than lifting, {{making it more difficult}} to reduce setup times. To reduce the cost of <b>switch</b> <b>exchanges,</b> this study intended to investigate the possibilities of using large construction machinery and, for the task specially adapted, a load distributing beam to lift the precast switch components. Construction machinery has historically been used to lift switches often without load distributing measures which can directly be contrary to the quality of deflection of the switch components, which the swedish transport administration regulations specify. Construction machinery can, unlike cranes, carry out other activities than just lifting where setup times are reduced and overall machine cost of the <b>switch</b> <b>exchange</b> should reduce. The study is thus designed to examine and clarify the conditions required for an alternative <b>switch</b> <b>exchange</b> method to be used. The conditions are based on the requirements that arise related to production, quality and contract aspects where the study also have included three traditionally utilized methods, gantry crane, rail-mounted crane and mobile crane. This is to enable to compare {{the pros and cons of}} the alternative method in comparison to the established <b>switch</b> <b>exchange</b> methods. The alternative method is also, along with the other <b>switch</b> <b>exchange</b> methods, tested against two real projects, the rebuilding of the meeting railyards Kaisepakte and Rensjön, with the intention to verify the study’s theoretically generated demand profiles. The study shows that the overall premise of using an alternative transmission shift method is based on the ability of the contractor to plan and prepare for using the method. Projects based on the swedish transport administration regulations and standards must create a good enough opportunity for the contractor to plan and prepare for the method. Which can be created by:• Continuity and sustainability of the client• Clearer quality requirements• Increased cooperation between client, contractor and construction planner• Focus on planningThe study of comparative analyzes also show that the <b>switch</b> <b>exchange</b> project have a tendency to change and comes with a high level of complexity, which makes it very difficult to argue that a single <b>switch</b> <b>exchange</b> method is fitted to meet the demands of all types of projects. Clear however is that the methods complement each other in regards to being able to master each other's weaknesses. The exception is the alternate <b>switch</b> <b>exchange</b> method and mobile cranes which impose similar requirements on the projects. Which could lead to the alternative method could be able to acquire the mobile cranes place as <b>switch</b> <b>exchange</b> method.

40|$|Abstract: This study {{investigates the}} effect of stock trading volume as a long-term, {{environmental}} variable on observed stock volatility. The motivation is that volumes of U.

We investigate a number of settings, including a mix of natural experiments (<b>exchange</b> <b>switches,</b> S&P 500 changes, dual-class shares), the aggregate time-series of U.

The conclusion is that stock trading produces its own volatility above and beyond that based on fundamentals. Preliminary. Comments welcome, please send to...|$|R
