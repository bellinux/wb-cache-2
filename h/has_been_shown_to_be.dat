5|$|In the {{periodic}} table of the elements, copernicium is a d-block transactinide element. During reactions with gold, it <b>has</b> <b>been</b> <b>shown</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> an extremely volatile metal and a group 12 element, {{so much so that}} it is probably a gas at standard temperature and pressure.|$|E
5|$|However, some {{research}} in parallel algorithms {{has studied the}} problem of finding a maximal clique. In particular, the problem of finding the lexicographically first maximal clique (the one found by the algorithm above) <b>has</b> <b>been</b> <b>shown</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> complete for the class of polynomial-time functions. This result implies {{that the problem is}} unlikely to be solvable within the parallel complexity class NC.|$|E
5|$|In general, {{researchers}} in the field focus on development of cognitive flexibility {{between the ages of}} three and five. However, cognitive flexibility <b>has</b> <b>been</b> <b>shown</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> a broad concept that can be studied with all different ages and situations. Thus, with tasks ranging from simple to more complex, research suggests that there is a developmental continuum that spans from infancy to adulthood.|$|E
50|$|PI3K and phosphoinositide {{phospholipase}} C activation <b>have</b> <b>been</b> <b>shown</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> {{necessary for}} macropinosome formation in fibroblasts. Members of the SNX family <b>have</b> also <b>been</b> <b>shown</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> important in macropinosome formation.

50|$|GLUT4 <b>has</b> <b>been</b> <b>shown</b> <b>to</b> {{interact}} with death-associated protein 6, {{also known as}} Daxx. Daxx, which is used <b>to</b> regulate apoptosis, <b>has</b> <b>been</b> <b>shown</b> <b>to</b> associate with GLUT4 in the cytoplasm. UBX-domains, {{such as the one}} found in GLUT4, <b>have</b> <b>been</b> <b>shown</b> <b>to</b> associate with apoptotic signaling. So this interaction aids in the translocation of Daxx within the cell.|$|R
50|$|The {{olfactory}} tubercle <b>has</b> <b>been</b> <b>shown</b> <b>to</b> play a {{large role}} in behavior. Unilateral lesions in the olfactory tubercle <b>have</b> <b>been</b> <b>shown</b> <b>to</b> alter attention, social and sensory responsiveness, and even locomotor behavior. Bilateral lesions <b>have</b> <b>been</b> <b>shown</b> <b>to</b> reduce copulatory behavior in male rats. The olfactory tubercle <b>has</b> also <b>been</b> <b>shown</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> especially involved in reward and addictive behaviors. Rats <b>have</b> <b>been</b> <b>shown</b> <b>to</b> administer cocaine into the olfactory tubercle more than the nucleus accumbens and ventral pallidum, other reward centers in the brain. In fact, they will administer cocaine into the olfactory tubercle at about 200 times per hour and even till death.|$|R
5|$|In the past, it {{was thought}} that {{consumption}} of protein even at normal levels increased the risk of hepatic encephalopathy. This <b>has</b> <b>been</b> <b>shown</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> incorrect. Furthermore, many people with chronic liver disease are malnourished and require adequate protein to maintain a stable body weight. A diet with adequate protein and energy is therefore recommended.|$|E
5|$|Individual {{components}} of the 19S particle have their own regulatory roles. Gankyrin, a recently identified oncoprotein, {{is one of the}} 19S subcomponents that also tightly binds the cyclin-dependent kinase CDK4 and {{plays a key role in}} recognizing ubiquitinated p53, via its affinity for the ubiquitin ligase MDM2. Gankyrin is anti-apoptotic and <b>has</b> <b>been</b> <b>shown</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> overexpressed in some tumor cell types such as hepatocellular carcinoma.|$|E
5|$|Since Darwin's On the Origins of Certain Instincts (quoted above) in 1873, path {{integration}} <b>has</b> <b>been</b> <b>shown</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> {{important to}} navigation in animals including ants, rodents and birds. When vision (and hence {{the use of}} remembered landmarks) is not available, such as when animals are navigating on a cloudy night, in the open ocean, or in relatively featureless areas such as sandy deserts, path integration must rely on idiothetic cues from within the body.|$|E
5000|$|Beta-actin <b>has</b> <b>been</b> <b>shown</b> <b>to</b> {{activate}} eNOS, {{thereby increasing}} NO production. An eight-amino acid residue (326-333) in actin <b>has</b> <b>been</b> <b>shown</b> <b>to</b> mediate {{the interaction between}} actin and eNOS ...|$|R

50|$|Bub3 <b>has</b> <b>been</b> <b>shown</b> <b>to</b> form {{complexes}} with Mad1-Bub1 {{and with}} Cdc20 (the interaction of {{which does not}} require intact kinetochores). Additionally, it <b>has</b> <b>been</b> <b>shown</b> <b>to</b> bind Mad2 and Mad3. Bub3 directs the localization of Bub1 at the kinetochore in order to activate the SAC. In both Saccharomyces cerevisiae and metazoans, Bub3 <b>has</b> <b>been</b> <b>show</b> <b>to</b> bind BubR1 and Bub1.|$|R
5|$|The Anthology of Pliny's Natural History is an {{epitome of}} Pliny the Elder's Natural History {{dedicated}} to King Henry II of England. It is of some {{importance in the}} transmission of Pliny's ideas to medieval Europe, although it <b>has</b> <b>been</b> <b>shown</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> less important as a witness to Pliny's text than once thought.|$|E
5|$|The New South Wales waratah {{had been}} {{considered}} to be protandrous (that is, with male parts concluding sexual activity before female parts become receptive on the same plant), but analysis of the timing of pollen viability and stigma receptivity has shown significant overlaps. The species <b>has</b> <b>been</b> <b>shown</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> self-incompatible, requiring cross-pollination with plants of other genotypes to reproduce successfully.|$|E
5|$|The hawksbill {{sea turtle}} <b>has</b> <b>been</b> <b>shown</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> biofluorescent {{and is the}} first reptile {{recorded}} with this characteristic. It is unknown if this {{is derived from the}} turtle's diet, which includes biofluorescent organisms like the hard coral Physogyra lichtensteini. Males have more intense pigmentation than females, and a behavioural role of these differences is speculated.|$|E
50|$|TNIK <b>has</b> <b>been</b> <b>shown</b> <b>to</b> {{interact}} with KIAA0090, although the significance <b>is</b> unclear. TNIK <b>has</b> <b>been</b> <b>shown</b> <b>to</b> phosphorylate Gelsolin, a protein involved in F-actin depolymerisation thus inducing cytoskeletal changes.|$|R

5|$|The {{prognosis}} {{of these}} patients is grim with untreated patients having an extremely short survival. The severity of liver disease (as evidenced by the MELD score) <b>has</b> <b>been</b> <b>shown</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> a determinant of outcome. Some patients without cirrhosis develop HRS, with an incidence of about 20% seen in one study of ill patients with alcoholic hepatitis.|$|E

Key {{nutrients}} are calcium, iron, magnesium, phosphorus, potassium, zinc, copper, manganese, vitamin C, thiamine, pantothenic acid, vitamin B, and folate. Phytochemicals include beta-carotene. Falafel is high in soluble fiber, which <b>has</b> <b>been</b> <b>shown</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> effective in lowering blood cholesterol.|$|E
5|$|Strontium <b>has</b> <b>been</b> <b>shown</b> <b>to</b> inhibit sensory {{irritation}} {{when applied}} topically to the skin. Topically applied, strontium <b>has</b> <b>been</b> <b>shown</b> <b>to</b> accelerate the recovery {{rate of the}} epidermal permeability barrier (skin barrier).|$|R

5|$|Aspirin is a {{first-line}} {{treatment for}} the fever and joint-pain symptoms of acute rheumatic fever. The therapy often lasts for one to two weeks, and is rarely indicated for longer periods. After fever and pain have subsided, the aspirin is no longer necessary, since it does not decrease the incidence of heart complications and residual rheumatic heart disease. Naproxen <b>has</b> <b>been</b> <b>shown</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> as effective as aspirin and less toxic, but due to the limited clinical experience, naproxen is recommended only as a second-line treatment.|$|E
5|$|Before 1995, no peer-reviewed {{studies had}} been {{published}} investigating the safety of genetically modified food using human or animal feeding trials. In 1995 the Scottish Agriculture Environment and Fisheries Department commissioned a £1.6 million three-year research study to assess the safety of genetically engineered Desiree Red potatoes. The potatoes had been developed by biochemist John Gatehouse at Cambridge Agricultural Genetics (later renamed Axis Genetics) and had recently completed two years of field trials at Rothamsted Experimental Station. The GNA gene from the Galanthus (snowdrop) plant was inserted into the potato, allowing the GNA lectin protein to be synthesised. This lectin <b>has</b> <b>been</b> <b>shown</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> toxic to some insects.|$|E
5|$|Darmstadtium is {{the eighth}} {{member of the}} 6d series of {{transition}} metals. Since copernicium (element 112) <b>has</b> <b>been</b> <b>shown</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> a transition metal, {{it is expected that}} all the elements from 104 to 112 would continue a fourth transition metal series, with darmstadtium as part of the platinum group metals and a noble metal. Calculations on its ionization potentials and atomic and ionic radii are similar to that of its lighter homologue platinum, thus implying that darmstadtium's basic properties will resemble those of the other group 10 elements, nickel, palladium, and platinum.|$|E
25|$|Rectopexy <b>has</b> <b>been</b> <b>shown</b> <b>to</b> improve anal {{incontinence}} (fecal leakage) {{in patients}} with rectal intussusception.
