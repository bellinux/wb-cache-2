To this end we develop and study a mathematical model with torsional and lateral bending modes that are coupled through a wheel-mounted <b>elastic</b> <b>tyre.</b> The geometric effects of a positive rake angle are fully incorporated into the resulting five-dimensional ordinary differential equation model. A bifurcation analysis {{in terms of the}} forward velocity and the vertical force on the gear reveals routes to different types of shimmy oscillations. In particular, we find regions of stable torsional and stable lateral shimmy oscillations, as well as transient quasiperiodic shimmy where both modes are excited...|$|E

The current state-of-the-art tyre models tend to be demanding in parameterisation terms, typically requiring extensive and expensive testing, and computational power. Consequently, an alternative parameterisation approach, which also allows for the separation of model fidelity from computational demand, is essential. Based on the above, a tyre model is introduced in this work. Tyre motion is separated into two components, the first being the non-linear global motion of the tyre as a rigid body and the second being the linear local deformation of each node. The resulting system of differential equations of motion consists of a reduced number of equations, depending {{on the number of}} rigid and elastic modes considered rather than the degrees of freedom. These equations are populated by the eigenvectors and the eigenvalues of the <b>elastic</b> <b>tyre</b> modes, the eigenvectors corresponding to the rigid tyre modes and the inertia properties of the tyre. The contact sub-model consists of bristles attached to each belt node. Shear forces generated in the contact area are calculated by a distributed LuGre friction model while vertical tread dynamics are obtained by the vertical motion of the contact nodes and the corresponding bristle stiffness and damping characteristics. To populate the abovementioned system of differential equations, the modal properties of the rigid and the elastic belt modes are required. In the context of the present work, rigid belt modes are calculated analytically, while in-plane and out-of-plane elastic belt modes are identified experimentally by performing modal testing on the physical tyre. To this end, the eigenvalue of any particular mode is obtained by fitting a rational fraction polynomial expression to frequency response data surrounding that mode. The eigenvector calculation requires a different approach as typically modes located {{in the vicinity of the}} examined mode have an effect on the apparent residue. Consequently, an alternative method has been developed which takes into account the out-of-band modes leading to identified residues representing only the modes of interest. The validation of the proposed modelling approach is performed by comparing simulation results to experimental data and trends found in the literature. In terms of vertical stiffness, correlation with experimental data is achieved for a limited vertical load range, due to the nature of the identified modal properties. Moreover, the tyre model response to transient lateral slip is investigated for a range of longitudinal speeds and vertical loads, and the resulting relaxation length trends are compared with the relevant literature...|$|E
40|$|Abstract: The vertical, {{longitudinal}} {{and lateral}} dynamic behaviour of road vehicles is largely inu-enced by the dynamic characteristics of tyres. The tyre characteristics have been modelled by research-ers as {{functions of the}} <b>tyre</b> <b>elastic</b> properties which are characterized by tyre vertical, lateral, longitudinal and torsional stiVnesses. Design details of an experimental rig for measurement of tyre static stiVnesses are presented, and experimental data on these stiVness values {{in the form of}} a power law as functions of tyre size, ply rating, normal load and ination pressure are reported. Using tyre models, the tyre force and moment characteristics necessary for vertical dynamic simulation can be predicted...|$|R
