2500|$|When Taishi Ci {{finally reached}} Luoyang after {{travelling}} day and night, {{he saw the}} provincial administration's courier near the city gate. He approached him and asked, [...] "Sir, are you delivering a document?" [...] The courier replied, [...] "Yes." [...] Taishi Ci asked again, [...] "Where is the document?" [...] The courier replied, [...] "In the carriage." [...] Taishi Ci said, [...] "Are you sure there is no mistake in the addressee's details on the document? Let me see it." [...] The courier {{did not know that}} Taishi Ci was from Donglai Commandery so he showed him the letter. Taishi Ci took out a knife and destroyed the letter. The courier started shouting, [...] "This man destroyed my document!" [...] Taishi Ci pulled him into the carriage and said, [...] "If you didn't show me the document, I wouldn't have been able to destroy it. Regardless of the consequences, neither of us can say he is not responsible for what happened. <b>I</b> <b>suggest</b> <b>we</b> remain silent and escape. By doing this, we can avoid punishment and keep our heads. Otherwise, both of us will be executed." [...] The courier asked, [...] "Your master sent you to destroy this document. Now that you have accomplished your mission, why do you still need to go on the run?" [...] Taishi Ci replied, [...] "He ordered me to only check whether the document has been delivered. However, I went too far and ended up destroying the document. If I go back, I am afraid that my master will blame me, so <b>I</b> <b>suggest</b> <b>we</b> escape together." [...] The courier was persuaded by Taishi Ci so they fled from Luoyang together.|$|E
60|$|I {{did not see}} {{how that}} was possible; though, as <b>I</b> <b>suggested,</b> <b>we</b> might have somehow got into the weir stream, and be making for the falls.|$|R
6000|$|... "That's {{the way to}} get on. The rest of {{this town}} is afraid of new things. 'Member when <b>I</b> <b>suggested</b> <b>we</b> all chip in on a dynamo with a gas engine and have {{electric}} lights? The hicks almost died of nervousness." ...|$|R
5000|$|Eric Fry recalled: “The {{airport is}} {{actually}} {{located on the}} plateau at {{the west end of}} Terrington Basin but it is only five miles inland from the narrows between Goose Bay and Terrington Basin. Having a Gander air base in Newfoundland <b>I</b> <b>suggested</b> <b>we</b> call the Labrador site Goose Bay airport and the suggestion was accepted.” ...|$|R
60|$|So we fall on our food, and devour the {{excellent}} little beef-steaks and rolls and boiled eggs, {{apples and oranges}} and dates, and drink the good red wine, and wildly discuss plans and the latest news, and are altogether thrilled about things. So thrilled that we are well away among the romantic mountains of the south-centre before we realise {{that there are other}} passengers besides ourselves in the carriage. Half the journey is over. Why, there is the monastery on its high hill! In a wild moment <b>I</b> <b>suggest</b> <b>we</b> shall get down and spend a night up there at Montecassino, and see the other friend, the monk who knows so much about the world, being out of it. But the q-b shudders, thinking of the awful winter coldness of that massive stone monastery, which has no spark of heating apparatus. And therefore the plan subsides, and at Cassino station I only get down to procure coffee and sweet cakes. They always have good things to eat at Cassino station: in summer, big fresh ices and fruits and iced water, in winter toothsome sweet cakes which make an awfully good finish to a meal.|$|E
6000|$|... "Mr. Paynter," [...] {{he said at}} last, [...] "I admit {{you have}} scored, in the spirit if not in the letter. In strict logic, this greater puzzle is not a reply to my case. If this ax has not been dipped in water, it has been dipped in blood; and the water jumping out of the well is not an {{explanation}} of the poet jumping out of the wood. But I admit that morally and practically it does make a vital difference. We are not faced with a colossal contradiction, and we don't know how far it extends. The body might have been broken up or boiled down to its bones by the murderer, though it may be hard to connect it with the conditions of the murder. It might conceivably have been so reduced by some property in the water and soil, for decomposition varies vastly with these things. I should not dismiss my strong prima facie case against the likely person because of these difficulties. But here we have something entirely different. That the bones themselves should remain dry in a well full of water, or a well that yesterday was full of water--that brings us to the edge of something beyond which we can make no guess. There is a new factor, enormous and quite unknown. While we can't fit together such prodigious facts, we can't fit together a case against Treherne or against anybody. No; there is only one thing to be done now. Since we can't accuse Treherne, we must appeal to him. We must put the case against him frankly before him, and trust he has an explanation--and will give it. <b>I</b> <b>suggest</b> <b>we</b> go back and do it now." ...|$|E
6000|$|It {{comes back}} to me, the whole [...] "job," [...] as wonderfully amusing and delightfully {{difficult}} from the first; since amusement deeply abides, I think, in any artistic attempt the basis and groundwork of which are conscious of a particular firmness. On that hard fine floor the element of execution feels it may more or less confidently DANCE; in which case puzzling questions, sharp obstacles, dangers of detail, may come up for it by the dozen without breaking its heart or shaking its nerve. It is the difficulty produced by the loose foundation or the vague scheme that breaks the heart--when a luckless fatuity has over-persuaded an author of the [...] "saving" [...] virtue of treatment. Being [...] "treated" [...] is never, in a workable idea, a mere passive condition, and I hold no subject ever susceptible of help that isn't, like the embarrassed man of our proverbial wisdom, first of all able to help itself. I was thus to have here an envious glimpse, in carrying my design through, of that artistic rage and that artistic felicity which I have ever supposed to be intensest and highest, {{the confidence of the}} dramatist strong in the sense of his postulate. The dramatist has verily to BUILD, is committed to architecture, to construction at any cost; to driving in deep his vertical supports and laying across and firmly fixing his horizontal, his resting pieces--at the risk of no matter what vibration from the tap of his master-hammer. This makes the active value of his basis immense, enabling him, with his flanks protected, to advance undistractedly, even if not at all carelessly, into the comparative fairy-land of the mere minor anxiety. In other words his scheme HOLDS, and as he feels this in spite of noted strains and under repeated tests, so he keeps his face to the day. I rejoiced, by that same token, to feel MY scheme hold, and even a little ruefully watched it give me much more than I had ventured to hope. For I promptly found my conceived arrangement of my material open the door wide to ingenuity. I remember that in sketching my project for the conductors of the periodical I have named I drew on a sheet of paper--and possibly with an effect of the cabalistic, it now comes over me, that even anxious amplification may have but vainly attenuated--the neat figure of a circle consisting of a number of small rounds disposed at equal distance about a central object. The central object was my situation, my subject in itself, to which the thing would owe its title, and the small rounds represented so many distinct lamps, as I liked to call them, the function of each of which would be to light with all due intensity one of its aspects. I had divided it, didn't they see? into aspects--uncanny as the little term might sound (though not for a moment did <b>I</b> <b>suggest</b> <b>we</b> should use it for the public), and by that sign we would conquer.|$|E

"The {{notion of}} the cistron ... must be {{replaced}} by that of a transcription unit containing regions which will be lost from the mature messenger - which <b>I</b> <b>suggest</b> <b>we</b> call introns (for intragenic regions) - alternating with regions which will be expressed - exons."

5000|$|For {{this year}} <b>I</b> <b>suggest</b> <b>we</b> give the {{questions}} of drill, skills, art, music, the teaching of languages, mathematics and other symbols, physical, aesthetic, moral and religious training and development, a rest, and that we concentrate on the inquiry: What are we telling young people directly about {{the world in which}} they are to live? ...|$|E
50|$|During the Russian revolution, {{political}} dictatorship was used, {{everything else}} can be discarded, the only aim was {{the success of}} the revolution... its success was due to the party (Communist Party of the Soviet Union) being on top of the state. <b>I</b> <b>suggest...</b> <b>we</b> should reorganise, by putting the party (Kuomintang) on top of the state (ROC).|$|E

5000|$|About {{the album}} title, bassist Markus Grosskopf {{explained}} in 2003 that [...] "It's {{based on that}} English saying, pulling a rabbit out of the hat. Pulling this rabbit album out of this hat reference to recent line up changes wasn't that easy this time. That gave us the idea of just calling the album Rabbit Don't Come Easy. Laughs It's {{not to be taken}} too seriously. We were joking that statement around, and then <b>I</b> <b>suggested</b> <b>we</b> actually call the album that".|$|R
5000|$|The {{album is}} Eno's sixth for Warp, and was {{recorded}} following {{the announcement of}} his first collaboration with Karl Hyde. Eno was quoted saying, [...] "when Someday World was finished I {{felt like we were}} still on a roll and I wasn't ready to stop working and get into 'promotional mode' for that record. So <b>I</b> <b>suggested</b> <b>we</b> immediately start on another album, a different one, where we extended some of the ideas we'd started, and attempted some of the ideas we hadn't." ...|$|R
5000|$|The term exon {{derives from}} the {{expressed}} region and was coined by American biochemist Walter Gilbert in 1978: [...] "The notion of the cistron… must be replaced by that of a transcription unit containing regions which will be lost from the mature messengerwhich <b>I</b> <b>suggest</b> <b>we</b> call introns (for intragenic regions)alternating with regions which will be expressedexons." ...|$|E
5000|$|In July 2015, Christensen {{suggested}} on {{his website}} that Australia should consider corporal punishment for drug traffickers, writing that [...] "It's {{time to do}} things differently, and <b>I</b> <b>suggest</b> <b>we</b> {{take a look at}} how they address the problem in Singapore. Their use of corporal punishment seems to be a highly effective deterrent." [...] In November 2015, Christensen again called for the bringing back of the death penalty.|$|E

40|$|Abstract: We have {{experienced}} the reality of globalization, both in its positive and negative attributes. A global future is unavoidable. From examples drawn from the trade in services, <b>I</b> <b>suggest</b> that <b>we</b> need a global ethic {{to deal with the}} ethical problems faced by modern business. Further, <b>I</b> <b>suggest</b> that <b>we</b> work towards developing such a global ethic by drawing on the experiences of East and West to find the best practice. Underpinning such a global ethic must be spiritualities which have one common factor: a global vision which is wide enough to include all people and their issues and their hopes. This requires leadership in business beyond simply local issues...|$|R

50|$|Nobody {{could call}} {{the whole nation}} a criminal, nor the {{individuals}} that have aired their political views. If the right of conquest belongs by right to the conquering country, {{it would be fair}} for Spain to quit resisting the French and submit to them, by the same principles for which it is expected that the Americans submit themselves to the peoples of Pontevedra. The reason and the rule must be equal for everybody. Here there are no conquerors or conquered; here there are only Spaniards. The Spaniards of Spain have lost their land.

5000|$|The [...] "Stories of the Childhood Stalin", {{was a book}} {{of stories}} {{supposedly}} of Stalin's childhood life. On 16 February 1938, within days of its release on bookshelves, Stalin {{wrote a letter to}} the Central Committee of the All Union Komsomol to tell them of his disdain for the book they promoted:I am absolutely against the publication of [...] "Stories of the childhood of Stalin". The book abounds with a mass of inexactitudes of fact, of alterations, of exaggerations and of unmerited praise. Some amateur writers, scribblers, (perhaps honest scribblers) and some adulators have led the author astray. It is a shame for the author, but a fact remains a fact. But this is not the important thing. The important thing resides in the fact that the book has a tendency to engrave on the minds of Soviet children (and people in general) the personality cult of leaders, of infallible heroes. This is dangerous and detrimental. The theory of [...] "heroes" [...] and the [...] "crowd" [...] is not a Bolshevik, but a Social-Revolutionary theory. The heroes make the people, transform them from a crowd into people, thus say the Social-Revolutionaries. The people make the heroes, thus reply the Bolsheviks to the Social-Revolutionaries. The book carries water to the windmill of the Social-Revolutionaries. No matter which book it is that brings the water to the windmill of the Social-Revolutionaries, this book is going to drown in our common, Bolshevik cause. <b>I</b> <b>suggest</b> <b>we</b> burn this book.|$|E
