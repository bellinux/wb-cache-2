500|$|Cheri Montesanto-Medcalf, the make-up {{department}} head for The X-Files, {{was responsible for}} making Benrubi appear mauled and bloody. It took four hours {{to get all of}} his make-up on him, which included prosthetic appliances and a [...] "head-to-toe" [...] application of dirt and a thickening agent, giving him a [...] "cracked and crusty" [...] appearance. Benrubi wore the make-up for almost twelve hours straight. Costume designer Christine Peters was tasked with designing the outfits for Mulder and Scully. Mulder's outfit was composed largely of [...] "Lacoste Izod alligator shirts, Dockers, Bass Weeguns," [...] and Scully's outfit was [...] "jeans and a sweatshirt [...] <b>khakis</b> <b>and</b> sneakers." [...] Peters noted that Scully's outfit was harder to design because Scully's character has [...] "a 'look' that she doesn't want to give up." ...|$|E

[...] Preppy fashions are associated with classic and conservative style of dressing and clothing brands such as Izod Lacoste, Brooks Brothers, and Polo Ralph Lauren. An example of preppy attire would be a button-down Oxford cloth shirt, Ascot tie, cuffed <b>khakis,</b> <b>and</b> tasseled loafers, Keds, or Boat shoes. Throughout the 1980s and 1990s, preppy fashions featured a lot of pastels, turtleneck sweaters for girls, and polo shirts with designer logos. It was also considered [...] "preppy" [...] to wear a cable knit cardigan or argyle pattern sweater tied loosely around the shoulders. The European equivalent, known as Sloane Rangers, dressed similarly but frequently incorporated tweed cloth British country clothing, burberry mackintoshes, mustard corduroy pants, rain boots, padded hairbands, and ancestral jewellery such as pearl necklaces.|$|E
2500|$|On Friday, May 10, in Atoka, Oklahoma, a {{man walked}} up to a woman's house and opened her screen door. He asked Mrs. Harmon {{if he could have}} some {{turpentine}}, food, and money. Mrs. Harmon told the man that she had very little turpentine and had no money or food. The man then grabbed Mrs. Harmon by the hair and dragged her out onto the porch. He told her that he might as well kill her since he had already killed three or four people and {{that he was going to}} rape her. He then heard a horse galloping towards them and told her, [...] "There comes a man on a horse. If you report this to officers I'll come back and kill you." [...] After the man ran off, the woman took her child with her to a neighbor's house further up the street and reported it to the police. Soon after her report, a widespread search for the man included 20 officers and 160 residents.

[...] Harry Ashmore, editor of the Arkansas Gazette newspaper, who won the Pulitzer Prize for Editorial Writing [...] "for the forcefulness, dispassionate analysis and clarity of his editorials on the school integration conflict in Little Rock", said that no one, whatever their beliefs on school integration, could feel anything but admiration for the way the Arkansas Guardsmen went calmly about their duties, steering clear of partisan pressure. [...] Superintendent of Little Rock Schools, Virgil Blossom, was also quoted as saying, [...] "I have nothing but praise for the Guardsmen and the manner in which they performed a trying job under difficult circumstances." [...] They were not, however, applauded by at least one member of the Little Rock Nine. [...] In her memoir about her experience at Central High, Melba Pattillo Beals recalls demanding a meeting with General Sherman T. Clinger of the Arkansas National Guard after the guardsmen [...] "stood by, socializing and flirting, while we were being beaten within an inch of our lives." [...] According to Beals, Clinger did not deny the charges, but merely explained that his men had to live in the community. [...] She further described the eighteen guardsmen selected as bodyguards after this meeting as the [...] "biggest, dumbest, most disheveled hayseeds I'd ever seen."Others recall the inside-the-school guardsmen as neat with starched and pressed <b>khakis,</b> <b>and</b> dispute the allegation of beatings.|$|E

[...] We left the mail at the P. O., had lunch at the hotel, and about 1.50 set out westward {{to the place of}} tryst. This was by a little {{shrunken}} brook in a deep channel of mud {{on the far side of}} which, in a thicket of low trees, all full of moths of shadow and butterflies of sun, we lay down to await her ladyship. Whiskey and water, then a sketch of the encampment for which we all posed to Belle, passed off the time until 3.30. Then I could hold on no longer. 30 minutes late. Had the secret oozed out? Were they arrested? I got my horse, crossed the brook again, and rode hard back to the Vaea cross roads, whence I was aware of white clothes glancing in the other long straight radius of the quadrant. [...] I turned at once to return to the place of tryst; but D. overtook me, and almost bore me down, shouting 'Ride, ride!' like a hero in a ballad. Lady Margaret and he were only come to shew the place; they returned, and the rest of our party, reinforced by Captain Leigh and Lady Jersey, set on for Malie. The delay was due to D.'s infinite precautions, leading them up lanes, by back ways, and then down again to the beach road a hundred yards further on.|$|E
