Then, collision free formation transition trajectories are computed using discrete event scheduling techniques that have been well-established in the manufacturing systems domain. The main contribution {{of this paper is}} a unified formation control framework that explicitly takes obstacles into account. Using discrete event system analysis tools we show that our approach guarantees convergence to the desired formation while avoiding obstacles and inter-agent collisions...|$|R

The definitions of critical points (peak, pit and saddle points) for this type of data is a very important issue for definitions and stable algorithms of areal texture parameters. Many of the published algorithms for critical points fail to meet some very simple topological properties which are always true for continuous data. Thus the collection of critical points produced from these published algorithms could not have come from a genuine continuous surface giving difficulties with interpretation of the results. An algorithm for critical points from lattice height data is presented which satisfies these topological properties and represents genuine features from the measured surface...|$|R

40|$|This {{research}} is particularly focused on studying heat transfer enhancement of a photovoltaic (PV) panel by putting an obstacle at the panel’s windward edge. The heat transfer enhancement is performed by disturbing the airflow {{over the surface}} and increasing the heat and momentum transfer. Different objects such as triangular, square, <b>rectangular,</b> and <b>discrete</b> <b>rectangular</b> ribs and partial grids were applied {{at the leading edge}} of a surrogate PV panel and flow and the heat transfer of the panel are investigated experimentally. This approach was selected to expand understanding of effect of these different objects on the flow and turbulence structures over a flat surface by analyzing the flow comprehensively. It is observed that, a transverse object at the plate’s leading edge would cause some flow blockage in the streamwise direction, {{but at the same time}} creates some velocity in the normal and cross stream directions. In addition to that, the obstacle generates some turbulence over the surface which persists for a long downstream distance. Also, among all studied objects, <b>discrete</b> <b>rectangular</b> ribs demonstrate the highest heat transfer rate enhancement (maximum Nu/Nu 0 of 1. 5). However, ribs with larger gap ratios are observed to be more effective at enhancing the heat transfer augmentation at closer distances to the rib, while at larger downstream distances from the rib, discrete ribs with smaller gap ratios are more effective. Furthermore, this work attempted to recognize the most influential flow parameters on the heat transfer enhancement of the surface. It is seen that the flow structure over a surface downstream of an object (flow separation-reattachment behaviour) has a significant effect on the heat transfer enhancement trend. Also, turbulence intensities are the most dominant parameters in enhancing the heat transfer rate from the surface; however, flow velocity (mostly normal velocity) is also an important factor...|$|R
