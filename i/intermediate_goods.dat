5|$|Opponents of the FairTax {{argue that}} {{imposing}} a national retail sales tax would drive transactions underground {{and create a}} vast underground economy. Under a retail sales tax system, the purchase of <b>intermediate</b> <b>goods</b> and services that are factors of production are not taxed, since those goods would produce a final retail good that would be taxed. Individuals and businesses {{may be able to}} manipulate the tax system by claiming that purchases are for <b>intermediate</b> <b>goods,</b> when in fact they are final purchases that should be taxed. Proponents point out that a business is required to have a registered seller's certificate on file, and must keep complete records of all transactions for six years. Businesses must also record all taxable goods bought for seven years. They are required to report these sales every month (see Personal vs. business purchases). The government could also stipulate that all retail sellers provide buyers with a written receipt, regardless of transaction type (cash, credit, etc.), which would create a paper trail for evasion with risk of having the buyer turn them in (the FairTax authorizes a reward for reporting tax cheats).|$|E

In the 1940s, only 31.3% of Brazil's 41.2million inhabitants resided in towns and cities; by 1991, of the country's 146.9million inhabitants 75.5% lived in cities, and Brazil had {{two of the}} world's largest metropolitan centers: São Paulo and Rio de Janeiro. The share of the primary sector in {{the gross national product}} declined from 28% in 1947 to 11% in 1992. In the same 1947–92 period, the contribution of industry to GNP increased from less than 20–39%. The industrial sector produces a wide range of products for the domestic market and for export, including consumer goods, <b>intermediate</b> <b>goods,</b> and capital goods.|$|E
25|$|In 2009, a {{study by}} the Cato Institute, a free market think tank, found that legalization of low-skilled illegal {{resident}} workers in the US would result in a net increase in US GDP of $180 billion over ten years. The Cato Institute study did not examine the impact on per capita income for most Americans. Jason Riley notes that because of progressive income taxation, in which the top 1% of earners pay 37% of federal income taxes (even though they actually pay a lower tax percentage based on their income), 60% of Americans collect more in government services than they pay in, which also reflects on immigrants. In any event, the typical immigrant and his children will pay a net $80,000 more in their lifetime than they collect in government services according to the NAS. Legal immigration policy is set to maximize net taxation. Illegal immigrants even after an amnesty tend to be recipients of more services than they pay in taxes. In 2010, an econometrics study by a Rutgers economist found that immigration helped increase bilateral trade when the incoming people were connected via networks to their country of origin, particularly boosting trade of final goods as opposed to <b>intermediate</b> <b>goods,</b> but that the trade benefit weakened when the immigrants became assimilated into American culture.|$|E

However, when the <b>intermediate</b> <b>good</b> is non-traded, the impact of a tax on labour in either of the two sectors is negative.

40|$|This paper {{examines}} {{the impact of}} exogenous capital inflow on prices, production, labour supply, and welfare {{in the presence of}} specialisation-based externalities. The paper utilises a simple model of an economy that produces one-final good by means of capital, labour, and a large number of varieties of an <b>intermediate</b> <b>good.</b> The <b>intermediate</b> <b>good</b> is produced by means of capital and labour. The supply of capital is exogenous but the supply of labour is endogenous. The presence of internal economies of scale in the <b>intermediate</b> <b>good</b> industry gives rise to specialisation-based external economies in the production of the final good. Perfect competition prevails in the final good industry whereas the <b>intermediate</b> <b>good</b> industry operates under Chamberlinian monopolistic competition. It is shown that exogenous capital inflow decreases labour supply and increases welfare only if the elasticity of substitution between leisure and the final good is equal to or less than unity. The paper also shows that, if trade opens up between two otherwise similar economies, a capital rich country would be a net importer of varieties of the <b>intermediate</b> <b>good...</b>|$|R
