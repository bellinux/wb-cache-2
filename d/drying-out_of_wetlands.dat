50|$|Desertification {{is defined}} as the process of fertile land {{becoming}} desert, and is characterized by loss vegetation cover, increase of sand area, and <b>drying-out</b> <b>of</b> <b>wetland</b> areas. At least 90% of Mongolia's pastureland has experienced some level of desertification. Between 1996 and 2009 up to a third of rivers dried out or were impacted by drought conditions. It has been found that desertification is predominantly (approximately 87%) caused by human factors rather than natural factors. These anthropogenic factors include overgrazing of livestock, erosion of farmland soils, burning, and climate change.|$|R

To maintain these functions, wetlands need {{to be protected from}} rapid transformation and overuse. Spatially-explicit information is required for sustainable <b>wetland</b> management. Development <b>of</b> <b>wetland</b> maps based on remote sensing requires a clear-cut definition <b>of</b> <b>wetlands.</b> This review was undertaken to improve the understanding of these habitats from a remote sensing perspective and to determine available wetland map layers for the East African countries of Kenya, Rwanda, Tanzania and Uganda.

Wetland amenities have negative impacts on the sales price of nearby single family homes. Forested <b>wetlands,</b> the size <b>of</b> the nearest <b>wetland,</b> and wetland proximity negatively impact the sales price of the properties.
