Although this solution is not ideal for the long term, text indexers may be adapted for compatibility of this encoding with the recommended encoding exposed in the previous paragraph, by considering this character triple as semantically equivalent as the previous character pair; and future fonts and text layout engines could also render this triple by implementing a non-discretionnary ligature between the two graphemes, so that it will render exactly like the standard character pair (which uses a single grapheme cluster).|$|E
50|$|Adobe Originals fonts tend {{to offer}} an {{extensive}} feature set through the OpenType font format, such as optical sizes, automatic ligature insertion, small capitals, swashes, text and lining figures and <b>kerning</b> <b>pair</b> sets to fine-tune character spacing. They are accordingly common choices in fine printing and book design.|$|E

50|$|The table below {{contains}} a few exemplifying <b>kerning</b> <b>pairs</b> and their values. These values {{are based on}} 1000 units/em and the <b>kerning</b> <b>pairs</b> are ordered from the most negative to the most positive kerning value. The samples are taken from the kerning tables of the Minion Pro font. In other fonts the kerning may be very different.|$|R

50|$|Each {{member of}} the family is {{composed}} of more than 720 glyphs and feature around 26700 <b>kerning</b> <b>pairs.</b>|$|R

40|$|This class {{makes it}} easy to {{generate}} tables that show many different <b>kerning</b> <b>pairs</b> of an arbitrary font, usable by L ATEX. It shows the kerning values that are used by the the font by default. In addition, this class enables the user to alternate the kernings and to observe the results. <b>Kerning</b> <b>pairs</b> can be defined for groups of similar glyphs at once. Automatically, an mtx file is generated that can be loaded by fontinst to introduce the user-made kernings into the virtual font for L ATEX...|$|R
50|$|A few desktop {{publishing}} systems allow {{the user to}} change or add <b>kerning</b> <b>pairs</b> without modifying the font file itself. The system merely applies to the user's document the new kerning values, instead of the values found in the font file.|$|R
50|$|Rather {{than using}} <b>kerning</b> <b>pairs</b> or relying on simple side-bearing measurements, Calamus’ native fonts encode {{left and right}} bounds for each {{character}} at eight different latitudes. Unlike the kerning information in other formats, the resulting jigsaw-pieces {{can be used to}} fit characters together, even if those characters are from different fonts or if they are set at different sizes.|$|R
40|$|This note {{introduces}} {{the basics of}} font metrics. units used in typography are presented. Traditional notions such as body size are introduced. A rapid overview over formatting and printing functions shows where metric information is needed. Metrics related to horizontal ans vertical placement of characters are described in detail, as well as problems related to <b>kerning</b> <b>pairs</b> and composite characters. A detailed explanation of AFM metrics files is provided...|$|R
50|$|In December 1984, James R. Von Ehr II {{founded the}} Altsys Corporation to develop {{graphics}} applications for personal computers. The first foray by Altsys into commercial font editing software was a bitmap font editor called Fontastic, {{released in the}} mid-1980s for the Apple Macintosh. The program, developed by Altsys founder Von Ehr, was able to edit the native bitmap font format of the Mac. It introduced many of the interface elements that would carry over into Fontographer. Fontastic Plus was later introduced with new editing tools and <b>kerning</b> <b>pairs.</b>|$|R
40|$|Abstract. We {{present a}} method for {{creating}} a PostScript type one Bézier outline font from a scanned bitmap of all characters. The number and positions of the Bézier sections are found by a random search method in which the search parameters are learned on-line. The criterion we use in the minimization {{takes into account the}} curvature, an error for deviating from the original pixel bitmap, and a penalty for the number of Bézier sections. The output consists of a type one PostScript font file and corresponding afm and tfm files with full sets of <b>kerning</b> <b>pairs.</b> The process is virtually fully automatic...|$|R
25|$|Digital fonts {{may also}} contain data {{representing}} the metrics used for composition, including <b>kerning</b> <b>pairs,</b> component creation data for accented characters, glyph substitution rules for Arabic typography and for connecting script faces, and for simple everyday ligatures like ﬂ. Common font formats include TrueType, OpenType and PostScript Type 1, while Metafont is still used by TeX and its variants. Applications using these font formats, including the rasterizers, appear in Microsoft and Apple Computer operating systems, Adobe Systems products {{and those of}} several other companies. Digital fonts are created with font editors such as FontForge, RoboFont, Glyphs, Fontlab's TypeTool, FontLab Studio, Fontographer, or AsiaFont Studio.|$|R
50|$|Many fonts have <b>kerning</b> <b>pairs</b> which {{implements}} better spacing {{in between}} the characters. Fonts also include embedded special orthographic rules to output certain combinations of letterforms (an alternative symbols for the same letter) be combined into special ligature forms (mixed characters). Operating systems, web browsers (user agent), and other software that extensively use typography, utilise a font to display text on the screen or print media, and can be programmed to use those embedded rules. Alternatively, they may use external script-shaping technologies (rendering technology or “smart font” engine), and {{they can also be}} programmed to use either a large Unicode font, or use multiple different fonts for different characters or languages.|$|R
50|$|When {{rendered}} {{with the}} same engine and without making adjustments for the different font metrics, the glyphs that appear in both Arial and Arial Unicode MS appear to be slightly wider, and thus rounder, in Arial Unicode MS. Horizontal text may also appear to have more inter-line spacing in Arial Unicode MS. This is due to larger bounding boxes (Arial Unicode MS needs more room for some of its extended glyphs) and the limitations of renderers, not changes in the glyph shapes. The lack of <b>kerning</b> <b>pairs</b> in Arial Unicode MS may also affect inter-glyph spacing in some renderers (for example the Adobe Flash Player).|$|R
5000|$|In digital typography, the TrueType font Arial Unicode MS is an {{extended}} {{version of the}} font Arial. Compared to Arial, it includes higher line height, omits <b>kerning</b> <b>pairs</b> and adds enough glyphs to cover a large subset of Unicode 2.1—thus supporting most Microsoft code pages, but also requiring much more storage space (22 megabytes). [...] It also adds Ideographic layout tables, but unlike Arial, it mandates no smoothing in the 14-18 point range, and contains Roman (upright) glyphs only; there is no oblique (italic) version. Arial Unicode MS is normally distributed with Microsoft Office, {{but it is also}} bundled with Mac OS X v10.5 and later. It may also be purchased separately (as Arial Unicode) from Ascender Corporation, who licenses the font from Microsoft.|$|R
50|$|Whether {{modifying the}} font file with a font editor or {{overriding}} it {{in a particular}} system, the user {{is limited to the}} existing kerning features. Thus, if one needs features like optical kerning, or contextual kerning, or <b>kerning</b> a <b>pair</b> of characters that belong to different fonts, and if the system lacks these features, other means must be employed.|$|R
50|$|The word-processing {{packages}} OpenOffice.org Writer and Microsoft Office Word do not, , support microtypography. They allow <b>pair</b> <b>kerning</b> {{and have}} limited support for ligaturing, but automatic ligaturing is not available.|$|R

He won re-election in 1989, 1991, 1993, 1995, 1997 and 1999 with David C. Russo as his running mate. Felice served in the General Assembly from 1982 to 2002, with posts as Assistant Majority Leader from 1986 to 1989, as Assistant Minority Leader in 1990 and 1991, as Deputy Speaker from 1992 to 1995 and as Speaker Pro Tempore starting in 1996. He served as Chair of the Health Committee, on the Environment Committee and on the Legislative Services Commission.|$|R
