5|$|The {{greatest}} number of fatalities involving one aircraft occurred in 1985 when 520 {{people died in the}} crash of Japan Airlines Flight 123. The most fatalities in an aircraft collision occurred during 1977 in the Tenerife airport disaster when 583 people were killed. The {{greatest number}} of fatalities from a midair collision occurred at the Charkhi Dadri mid-air collision, to the west of New Delhi, India on 12 November 1996 when a Saudi Arabian Airlines Boeing 747-100B en route from Delhi to Dhahran, Saudi Arabia, collided with Kazakhstan Airlines Ilyushin Il-76 en route from Chimkent, Kazakhstan to Delhi, killing all 349 people aboard both the airplanes. The 11 September 2001 (9/11) coordinated attack of the World Trade Center claimed not only 157 passengers and crew, but an estimated additional 2,500 victims. In 2012, Boeing released a study of worldwide commercial <b>jet</b> <b>airplane</b> accidents between 1959 and 2011 reporting 1,798 accidents, 603 categorized as fatal, which accounted for 29,025 on-board fatalities and an additional 1,173 ground or non-commercial aircraft collision deaths.

25|$|The Sylvania {{started on}} her maiden voyage from Greenock to Montreal on 5 June 1957. On 26 June 1957 she joined her sisters on their {{northern}} hemisphere summer service from Liverpool to Montreal via Greenock and Québec. By {{the time she}} entered service the growth of passenger numbers in transatlantic liner service had ceased, while the amount of passenger transported by the <b>jet</b> <b>airplane</b> was growing. In 1958 the Saxonia made one crossing from Liverpool to New York via Cobh and Halifax. In April 1961 she was moved permanently to the Liverpool—New York service, replacing the RMS Britannic. At some point during her career with Cunard, the Sylvania also served on the Rotterdam—Southampton—Le Havre—Québec—Montreal -route and winter crossings between Liverpool and Halifax via Greenock.|$|E

2500|$|The {{visual effects}} for Stargate SG-1 and Stargate Atlantis are {{predominantly}} produced by [...] Rainmaker Digital Effects, a notable visual-effects studio. [...] However, some effects, including the entire Ori battle sequence in the episode , were done [...] "in-house". [...] The unstable vortex effect, {{both in the}} film and the early seasons of the series, on account of being [...] "difficult to achieve" [...] was generated only once and recorded from various angles; this recording was the same used for all gate opening shots early in the series. [...] Rather than being a jet of water, it is actually the image of high-pressure air being blasted into a tank of water. The effect was achieved by mounting a <b>jet</b> <b>airplane</b> engine two feet above a water tank, and using its [...] windstream to create the sufficient water displacement. In post production, the surrounding water was removed with computer editing, {{and the image of}} the air-jet pasted {{into the center of the}} opening stargate. This technique was only used for earlier episodes, and the effect was replicated digitally soon after to allow more flexibility in shots.|$|E
