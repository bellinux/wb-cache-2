40|$|Two {{pairs of}} small {{stagnant}} ice bodies on the Hazen Plateau of northeastern Ellesmere Island, the St. Patrick Bay <b>ice</b> <b>caps</b> and the Murray and Simmons <b>ice</b> <b>caps,</b> are rapidly shrinking, and {{the remnants of}} the St. Patrick Bay <b>ice</b> <b>caps</b> are likely to disappear entirely within the next 5 years. Vertical aerial photographs of these Little Ice Age relics taken during August of 1959 show that the larger of the St. Patrick Bay <b>ice</b> <b>caps</b> had an area of 7. 48  km 2 and the smaller one 2. 93  km 2; the Murray and Simmons <b>ice</b> <b>caps</b> covered 4. 37 and 7. 45  km 2 respectively. Outlines determined from ASTER satellite data for July 2016 show that, compared to 1959, the larger and the smaller of the St. Patrick Bay <b>ice</b> <b>caps</b> had both been reduced to only 5  % of their former area, with the Murray and Simmons <b>ice</b> <b>caps</b> faring better at 39 and 25  %, likely reflecting their higher elevation. Consistent with findings from other glaciological studies in the Queen Elizabeth Islands, ASTER imagery in conjunction with past GPS surveys documents a strikingly rapid wastage of the St. Patrick Bay <b>ice</b> <b>caps</b> over the last 15  years. These two <b>ice</b> <b>caps</b> shrank noticeably even between 2014 and 2015, apparently in direct response to the especially warm summer of 2015 over northeastern Ellesmere Island. The well-documented recession patterns of the Hazen Plateau <b>ice</b> <b>caps</b> over the last 55 + years offer an opportunity to examine the processes of plant recolonization of polar landscapes...|$|R
50|$|Ice {{sheets and}} <b>ice</b> <b>caps</b> cover vast areas and are {{unconstrained}} by the underlying topography having a radial flow. The main {{distinction between the}} two is the size of their surface, with <b>ice</b> <b>caps</b> covering areas less than 50,000 square kilometers, while ice sheets span larger areas. Ice sheets and <b>ice</b> <b>caps</b> can be classified further.|$|R
50|$|Much of the {{highlands}} {{of the park}} are covered in <b>ice</b> <b>caps.</b> These <b>ice</b> <b>caps,</b> and the glaciers that descend from them, date {{back at least to}} the last episode of glaciation.|$|R
5|$|The volcano {{is covered}} by a thick <b>ice</b> <b>cap,</b> the second largest in the tropics, that has existed {{since at least the}} Pliocene and has {{undergone}} several phases of expansion and reduction. , the <b>ice</b> <b>cap</b> is in retreat; one estimate predicts that it will disappear by 2045. The retreat of the Coropuna glaciers threatens the water supply {{of tens of thousands of}} people, and interaction between volcanic activity and glacial effects has generated mudflows that could be a hazard to surrounding populations if the mountain returns to volcanic activity.|$|E
5|$|A polar <b>ice</b> <b>cap,</b> or {{polar ice}} sheet, is a high-latitude region {{of a planet}} or moon that is covered in ice. Ice caps form because high-latitude regions receive less energy as solar {{radiation}} from the sun than equatorial regions, resulting in lower surface temperatures.|$|E
5|$|During the ice ages, a {{substantial}} <b>ice</b> <b>cap</b> covered the Patagonian and Fuegian Andes. Two stages of glaciation {{have been identified}} in southern Tierra del Fuego; four more have been found north of the Magellan Strait. After about 10,000 years ago, Nothofagus woods developed in the region.|$|E
50|$|Lake Vostok in Antarctica {{may have}} {{implications}} for liquid water still existing on Mars, because if water existed before the polar <b>ice</b> <b>caps</b> on Mars, {{it is possible that}} there is still liquid water below the <b>ice</b> <b>caps.</b>|$|R

5|$|During the ice ages of {{the last}} two million years the Tibetan plateau and the Himalayas have been covered by the {{expanded}} polar <b>ice</b> <b>cap</b> several times. As the ice moved it eroded the rock, filling the river canyons with gravel. In some sections the rivers have cut through the gravel and flow swiftly over bedrock, and in some areas large boulders have fallen into the rivers and formed rapids.|$|E
5|$|The {{report also}} {{confirmed}} that the United States stockpiled nuclear weapons in Greenland until 1965, contradicting assurances by Danish foreign minister Niels Helveg Petersen that the weapons were in Greenland's airspace, but never on the ground. The DUPI report also revealed details of Project Iceworm, a hitherto secret United States Army plan to store up to 600 nuclear missiles under the Greenland <b>ice</b> <b>cap.</b>|$|E
40|$|Mass-balance {{measurements}} {{have been}} renewed on two small <b>ice</b> <b>caps</b> on north-eastern Ellesmere Island. Original stake networks {{were established in}} 1972 and 1976. Since then, both <b>ice</b> <b>caps</b> have experienced significant mass losses averaging - 70 to - 140 kg m- 2 a-I. They have also decreased in area. The equilibrium line in this area has averaged around 1150 m {{for the last decade}} or so. 2 ̆ 7 The <b>ice</b> <b>caps</b> are remnants of former climatic conditions and are out of equilibrium with contemporary climate...|$|R
40|$|This is an {{interactive}} module {{to explain to}} a wide audience the simulating of <b>ice</b> <b>caps.</b> Sea levels are rising for various reasons related to global warming. The glaciers of Antarctica and Greenland, known as <b>ice</b> <b>caps</b> or <b>ice</b> sheets, {{play a major role}} in sea level rise. Is it possible to predict future changes in these <b>ice</b> <b>caps,</b> and particularly the calving of icebergs into the ocean?The module answers to this question by showing numerical simulations of ice sheet dynamics.

50|$|Earth's polar caps {{have changed}} {{dramatically}} over the last 12,000 years. Seasonal variations of the <b>ice</b> <b>caps</b> takes place due to varied solar energy absorption as the planet or moon revolves around the Sun. Additionally, in geologic time scales, the <b>ice</b> <b>caps</b> may grow or shrink due to climate variation.|$|R
5|$|Triton's south {{polar region}} is covered by a highly {{reflective}} cap of frozen nitrogen and methane sprinkled by impact craters and openings of geysers. Little {{is known about the}} north pole because it was on the night side during the Voyager 2 encounter, but it is thought that Triton must also have a north polar <b>ice</b> <b>cap.</b>|$|E
5|$|As this {{scenario}} continues, by 100 million {{years from the}} present the continental spreading will have reached its maximum extent and the continents will then begin to coalesce. In 250 million years, North America will collide with Africa while South America will wrap around {{the southern tip of}} Africa. The result will be the formation of a new supercontinent (sometimes called Pangaea Ultima), with the Pacific Ocean stretching across half the planet. The continent of Antarctica will reverse direction and return to the South Pole, building up a new <b>ice</b> <b>cap.</b>|$|E
5|$|Berge Meere und Giganten (Mountains Seas and Giants) is a 1924 {{science fiction}} novel by German author Alfred Döblin. Stylistically and {{structurally}} experimental, the novel follows {{the development of}} human society into the 27th century and depicts global-scale conflicts between future polities, technologies, and natural forces, culminating in the catastrophic harvesting of Iceland's volcanic energy in order to melt Greenland's <b>ice</b> <b>cap.</b> Among critics, Berge Meere und Giganten has {{the reputation of being}} a difficult and polarizing novel, and has not received nearly as much attention as Döblin's following novel, Berlin Alexanderplatz (1929).|$|E

5|$|In 2005 {{an island}} {{was found in}} {{the central part of the}} lake. Then, in January 2006, the {{discovery}} of two nearby smaller lakes under the <b>ice</b> <b>cap</b> was published; they are named 90 Degrees East and Sovetskaya. It is suspected that these Antarctic subglacial lakes may be connected by a network of subglacial rivers. Centre for Polar Observation & Modelling glaciologists propose that many of the subglacial lakes of Antarctica are at least temporarily interconnected. Because of varying water pressure in individual lakes, large subsurface rivers may suddenly form and then force large amounts of water through the solid ice.|$|E
5|$|Several phylogenetic studies, {{based on}} {{morphological}} characters and mitochondrial DNA sequences, have established the sister species {{relationship between the}} porbeagle and the salmon shark (L.ditropis), which occurs in place {{of it in the}} North Pacific. The genus Lamna evolved 65–45 Ma. When its two extant species diverged from each other is uncertain, though the precipitating event was likely the formation of the <b>ice</b> <b>cap</b> over the Arctic Ocean, which would have isolated sharks in the North Pacific from those in the North Atlantic.|$|E
5|$|The Köppen {{classification}} {{depends on}} average monthly values of temperature and precipitation. The {{most commonly used}} form of the Köppen classification has five primary types labeled A through E. Specifically, the primary types are A, tropical; B, dry; C, mild mid-latitude; D, cold mid-latitude; and E, polar. The five primary classifications can be further divided into secondary classifications such as rain forest, monsoon, tropical savanna, humid subtropical, humid continental, oceanic climate, Mediterranean climate, steppe, subarctic climate, tundra, polar <b>ice</b> <b>cap,</b> and desert.|$|E

5|$|Gannett Glacier, on the {{northeast}} slope of Gannett Peak, is the largest single glacier in the U.S. Rocky Mountains. It has reportedly lost over 50percent of its volume since 1920 with 25percent of that occurring between the years 1980–1999. Upper Fremont Glacier has been studied {{more than any other}} glacier in the Wind River Range. Scientist have obtained ice cores from the Upper Fremont Glacier and found that there have been measurable changes in the atmosphere over the past several hundred years. The Upper Fremont Glacier and the Quelccaya <b>Ice</b> <b>Cap</b> in the Andes of South America both show nearly identical atmospheric records, which indicate a global linkage of atmospheric conditions over time.|$|E
5|$|The {{seasonal}} frosting {{of areas}} near the southern <b>ice</b> <b>cap</b> {{results in the}} formation of transparent 1-metre-thick slabs of dry ice above the ground. With the arrival of spring, sunlight warms the subsurface and pressure from subliming CO2 builds up under a slab, elevating and ultimately rupturing it. This leads to geyser-like eruptions of CO2 gas mixed with dark basaltic sand or dust. This process is rapid, observed happening {{in the space of a}} few days, weeks or months, a rate of change rather unusual in geology – especially for Mars. The gas rushing underneath a slab to the site of a geyser carves a spiderweb-like pattern of radial channels under the ice, the process being the inverted equivalent of an erosion network formed by water draining through a single plughole.|$|E
