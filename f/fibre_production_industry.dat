40|$|Abstract: This paper reviews {{genetics}} of <b>fibre</b> <b>production</b> and fleece {{characteristics in}} small ruminant, Angora rabbit and South American camelids {{with a special}} distinction between single coat and double coat species. About biology of <b>fibre</b> <b>production</b> there are variations in coat composition and structure, fibre growth pattern and fibre structure and quality between these two main kinds of fibre producing animals. In single coat species all fibres are nearly similar in dimensions and grow permanently while in double coat species coat comprises a coarse outer-coat and a fine inner-coat with variations of coat composition and structure, and fibre growth pattern according to {{the season with a}} well defined duration of fibre growth. Genetic basis of hair growth pattern, coat composition and fibre structure are different between species. In small ruminants, these coat characters are additive and due to several genes while in rabbit, several autosomal recessive genes are determining fibre growth, coat composition and structure. In alpaca, the fleece type (Suri or Huacaya) is determined by a single dominant gene. This paper also reviews genetic parameters of <b>fibre</b> <b>production</b> traits in angora goat, angora rabbit and alpaca in which many aspects of the genetic basis of <b>fibre</b> <b>production</b> are analogous. There are many traits controlling both fibre quality and fibre quantity, and most of these traits tend to be moderately to strongly inherited with differences between species so that a rapid genetic progress in any traits is possible and indeed has been achieved. However there are differences in breeding programmes between the double-coated Angora rabbit and the single-coated species Angora goat and alpaca. In double coat species, selection for one single trait, the easy measurable total fleece weight has general beneficial effects on fleece quality. On the opposite, due to antagonistic relations between qualitative and quantitative traits, achieving this goal requires a multi-trait selection index approach. Gene mapping studies have recently identified several putative QTL’s and major genes affecting <b>fibre</b> <b>production</b> and fleece characteristics in sheep, goat and rabbit and were reviewed. The whole genome sequence of sheep and rabbit which will be available in the near future and the use of high-density SNP chip will allow fine mapping and dissection of the genetic basis of many <b>production</b> traits including <b>fibre</b> and fleece characteristics and thus will contribute to improving the efficiency, profitability and sustainability of small ruminant and rabbit <b>fibre</b> <b>production...</b>|$|R
40|$|This paper reviews {{genetics}} of <b>fibre</b> <b>production</b> and fleece {{characteristics in}} small ruminants, Angora rabbit and South American camelids {{with a special}} distinction between single-coated (SC) and double-coated (DC) species. Considering the biology of <b>fibre</b> <b>production,</b> there are variations in coat composition and structure, fibre growth pattern and fibre structure and quality between these two main kinds of fibre-producing animals. In SC species, all fibres are nearly similar in dimensions and are produced from individual follicles that have a very long period, essentially permanent, of active growth without a synchronous phase of rest between follicles. In contrast, in DC species the fleece comprises a coarse outer coat and a fine inner coat with variations of coat composition and structure, and fibre growth pattern according to {{the season with a}} well-defined duration of fibre growth. Genetic basis of hair growth pattern, coat composition and fibre structure are different between species. In small ruminants, these coat characters are additive and because of several genes whereas in rabbit, several autosomal recessive genes determine fibre growth, coat composition and structure. In alpaca, the fleece type (Suri or Huacaya) is determined by a single dominant gene. This paper also reviews genetic parameters of <b>fibre</b> <b>production</b> traits in Angora goat, Angora rabbit and alpaca in which many aspects of the genetic basis of <b>fibre</b> <b>production</b> are analogous.

40|$|Sisal {{fibre can}} {{potentially}} replace glass fibre in natural fibre composites. This study {{focuses on the}} environmental performance of sisal <b>fibre</b> <b>production</b> by quantifying the greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions and energy use of producing sisal fibre in Tanzania and Brazil using life cycle assessment (LCA), based on region-specific inventory data. The results show that sisal <b>fibre</b> <b>production</b> has much lower GHG emissions (75 – 95 %) and non-renewable energy use (85 – 95 %) compared to glass fibre on a kg-basis, which {{is in line with}} published LCAs on natural fibres. Sisal fibre's GHG emissions are strongly influenced by potential methane emissions arising from the wet disposal of sisal leaf residues. Furthermore, because the direct energy and material requirements of sisal <b>fibre</b> <b>production</b> are low, its environmental performance is shown to vary strongly based on local practices such as residue disposal and fertiliser use, and is also sensitive to transportation distances. Several improvement options are explored to understand potential improvements in environmental sustainability. The most attractive option is limiting inadvertent methane emissions occurring at residue disposal sites, for instance by using them for the production of biogas. © 2017 Elsevier Lt...|$|R

In the absence of cattle <b>fibre</b> <b>production</b> data for southern Australia, Angus, Hereford, Simmental and Limousin cows and crosses between these breeds grazing perennial pastures at Hamilton, Victoria were sampled in late winter. The fibre-growing area {{on the sides of}} cattle was measured, fibre sampled at the mid-side site and the sampling area determined. Fibre was tested for fibre diameter distribution, clean washing yield and fibre length measured. Cows were 3 - 7 years of age, liveweights were 412 - 712 kg and the mean fibre-growing area was 2. 2 m 2. This produced an average 682 g of total fibre (range 3461 - 175 g). The mean fibre diameter of all fibres was 51. 7 μm (range 43 - 62 μm) and 18 % of fibres were 36 μm (range 6 - 39 %). The clean washing yield was 92. 4 % (range 87. 4 - 95. 8 %). Fibre length averaged 21 mm. Increasing the age, liveweight and condition score of cows and increasing weight of clean fibre were associated with significant increases in mean fibre diameter. Breed of cattle did not affect <b>fibre</b> <b>production</b> (P > 0. 1) but did affect mean fibre diameter (P < 0. 05). The quantity of <b>fibre</b> <b>production</b> indicates potential for low value textile production.

40|$|It is {{supposed}} that the acid hydrolysis taking {{place during the}} thermal-mechanical disintegration is accelerated {{by the use of}} recycling water influencing the fibre properties and as a result also the bonding quality of the MDF. Thus, mainly the influence of the recycling of condensation products at the <b>fibre</b> <b>production</b> on the properties of MDF made from different wood species (poplar, beech, spruce, pine) was investigated. The properties of MDF bonded with urea resin were hardly influenced by the recycling of condentation products. The differences in the chemical fibre properties are too slight as to significantly influence the bonding quality of the boards. Therefore, recycling water can be used for the <b>fibre</b> <b>production</b> without any negative effect on the quality of MDF...|$|R
40|$|Abstract Electrospinning generates nanofibres {{at speeds}} that often surpass those of {{conventional}} man-made <b>fibre</b> <b>production.</b> This makes control and manipulation of these nanofibres {{that much more}} difficult and challenging. However, {{to take full advantage}} of the superior properties of electrospun nanofibres, their production process must be clearly understood and all possible means of fibre formation and hence fibre control explored. This article attempts to explain electrospun <b>fibre</b> <b>production</b> from first principles and uses schematics to follow the electrospinning process from inception, i. e. in the nozzle, to collection with respect to electrostatic behaviours. The complex interrelationship between the charged species in the moving solution and their subsequent polarization and the induced internal field by the applied external electric field are systematically explored and explained. ...|$|R
40|$|This paper {{presents}} the results of an investigation into the fine <b>fibre</b> <b>production</b> from domestic and wild Argentine South American Camelids (ASAC), carried out within a cooperation programme between the Argentine Republic and European Union, started in 1992 and financed by European Commission,- DG 1 -, Economic Cooperation Program. The programme has been planned for the following main reasons: the great potential for development of ASAC fine <b>fibre</b> <b>production</b> and genetic resources, the opportunity for the poorest land resources (Puna) to develop alternative livestock production systems, the existence of Argentine projects in the same field (PROMECAD- PROgrama MEjora CAmelidos Domestico- and INTA research activity- Instituto Nacional de Tecnología Agropecuaria-), the current low volume of <b>fibre</b> <b>production</b> due to the reduced number of animals reared in Argentina (150, 000 heads), the low product valorisation, the lack of marketing knowledge, and the low technological level of fibre processing. The main objectives of the programme have been: 1) to set up a methodology for the genetic improvement of ASAC and for the optimal management of fibre production; 2) to analyse the international market for camelid fibres and to identify new trading opportunities, 3) to study technical, economic and financial problems associated with the commercial exploitation of camelid fibres. Among the benefits resulting from this project, there has been an improvement in the level of cooperation between public and private operators {{for the development of the}} sector and the opportunity for the economic valorisation of ASAC fibres, while new possibilities for the commercial cooperation between Europe and Argentina have been identified.
