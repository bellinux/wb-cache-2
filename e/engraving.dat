5|$|An <b>engraving</b> by Samuel and Nathaniel Buck from 1727 {{is one of}} the {{earliest}} depictions of the castle, with later depictions from antiquarian William Close (1805), artist William Green (1809), and Edwin Waugh (1860). The Buck brother’s <b>engraving</b> showed the castle in a state of ruin, and Waugh's depiction in particular shows that from the mid-19th century the castle has remained in a similar state of ruin until the present.|$|E
5|$|Boxwood {{cut across}} the end-grain is hard enough for fine <b>engraving,</b> {{allowing}} greater detail than in normal woodcutting. This been the dominant method used since Bewick's time. In addition, since a wood <b>engraving</b> is inked on the face, it requires only low pressure to print an image, so the blocks last for many thousands of prints, and importantly can be assembled into a page of metal type for ordinary printing in a single run. In contrast, a copper plate <b>engraving</b> is inked in the engraved grooves, the face being wiped clean of ink before printing, so much higher pressure is required, and images must be printed separately from the text, at far greater expense.|$|E

5|$|The {{draft was}} then {{transferred}} by pencil on white-primed panels of hardwood end grain. Not {{only was it}} hard work, but {{the quality of the}} printing block was crucial. Everything left white on the block, around Busch's drawn lines, was cut from the plate by skilled engravers. Wood <b>engraving</b> allows a finer differentiation than woodcut and the potential tonal values are of almost the quality of intaglio printing, such as copper <b>engraving.</b> Sometimes the result was not satisfactory, leading Busch to rework or reproduce plates. The wood <b>engraving</b> technique did not allow for fine lines, which is why Busch's drawing, especially in his illustrated tales up to the mid-1870s, are boldly drawn, giving his work its particular characteristic.|$|E
