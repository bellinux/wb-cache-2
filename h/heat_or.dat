5|$|Early thermal {{weapons were}} devices or {{substances}} used in warfare during the classical and medieval periods (approx 8th century BC until the mid-16th century AD) which used <b>heat</b> <b>or</b> burning action to destroy or damage enemy personnel, fortifications or territories.|$|E
2500|$|Thermostats use {{different}} types of sensors to measure the temperature. In one form, the mechanical thermostat, a bimetallic strip {{in the form of}} a coil directly operates electrical contacts that control the <b>heating</b> <b>or</b> cooling source. Electronic thermostats, instead, use a thermistor or other semiconductor sensor that requires amplification and processing to control the <b>heating</b> <b>or</b> cooling equipment (or even both, through the use of relays). A thermostat is an example of a [...] "bang-bang controller" [...] as the <b>heating</b> <b>or</b> cooling equipment output is not proportional to the difference between actual temperature and the temperature setpoint. Instead, the <b>heating</b> <b>or</b> cooling equipment runs at full capacity until the set temperature is reached, then shuts off. Increasing the difference between the thermostat setting and the desired temperature therefore does not change the time to achieve the desired temperature. The rate at which the target system temperature can change is determined both by the capacity of the <b>heating</b> <b>or</b> cooling equipment to respectively add <b>or</b> remove <b>heat</b> to <b>or</b> from a target system and the capacity of the target system to store heat.|$|R

5|$|Highly {{concentrated}} {{sources of}} oxygen promote rapid combustion. Fire and explosion hazards exist when concentrated oxidants and fuels are brought into close proximity; an ignition event, such as <b>heat</b> <b>or</b> a spark, {{is needed to}} trigger combustion. Oxygen is the oxidant, not the fuel, but nevertheless the source {{of most of the}} chemical energy released in combustion.|$|E
5|$|Promethium is {{also used}} to measure the {{thickness}} of materials by evaluating the amount of radiation from a promethium source that passes through the sample. It has possible future uses in portable X-ray sources, and as auxiliary <b>heat</b> <b>or</b> power sources for space probes and satellites (although the alpha emitter plutonium-238 has become standard for most space-exploration-related uses).|$|E
5|$|Proteins were {{recognized}} as a distinct class of biological molecules {{in the eighteenth century}} by Antoine Fourcroy and others, distinguished by the molecules' ability to coagulate or flocculate under treatments with <b>heat</b> <b>or</b> acid.

5|$|Most {{end users}} of {{forecasts}} {{are members of}} the general public. Thunderstorms can create strong winds and dangerous lightning strikes that can lead to deaths, power outages, and widespread hail damage. Heavy snow or rain can bring transportation and commerce to a stand-still, as well as cause flooding in low-lying areas. Excessive <b>heat</b> <b>or</b> cold waves can sicken or kill those with inadequate utilities, and droughts can impact water usage and destroy vegetation.|$|E
5|$|Plutonium, {{like most}} metals, has a bright silvery {{appearance}} at first, much like nickel, but it oxidizes {{very quickly to}} a dull gray, although yellow and olive green are also reported. At room temperature plutonium is in its α (alpha) form. This, the most common structural form of the element (allotrope), is about as hard and brittle as gray cast iron unless it is alloyed with other metals to make it soft and ductile. Unlike most metals, {{it is not a}} good conductor of <b>heat</b> <b>or</b> electricity. It has a low melting point (640°C) and an unusually high boiling point (3,228°C).|$|E

5|$|The delay {{caused the}} entire {{production}} schedule to be revised, and cinematographer Carlo Carlini, {{who had a}} prior commitment, had {{to be replaced by}} Otello Martelli, a long-time favorite of Fellini's. When filming resumed in February 1954, it was winter. The temperature had dropped to -5°C, often resulting in no <b>heat</b> <b>or</b> hot water, necessitating more delays and forcing the cast and crew to sleep fully dressed and wear hats to keep warm.|$|E
5|$|Unlike the Great Sand Sea, {{the coastal}} {{portion of the}} Libyan Desert is stony rather than sandy, {{but it is no}} less arid, and {{supports}} little vegetation. Close to the coast, the ground was broken by wadis. Military vehicles could traverse the stony desert with little difficulty, although the heat, dust and wind caused their rapid deterioration. Because it was so thinly populated, bombs and shells could be used with minimal risk of civilian casualties. Winter nights could be bitterly cold, yet the days could still be uncomfortably hot. There was almost no food or water, and little shelter from the cold, the <b>heat</b> <b>or</b> the wind. The desert was, however, relatively free from disease.|$|E
5|$|Welding is a {{fabrication}} or sculptural {{process that}} joins materials, usually metals or thermoplastics, by causing fusion, which {{is distinct from}} lower temperature metal-joining techniques such as brazing and soldering, which do not melt the base metal. In addition to melting the base metal, a filler material is typically added to the joint to form a pool of molten material (the weld pool) that cools to form a joint that is usually stronger than the base material. Pressure may also be {{used in conjunction with}} <b>heat,</b> <b>or</b> by itself, to produce a weld. Welding also requires a form of shield to protect the filler metals or melted metals from being contaminated or oxidized.|$|E

5|$|A {{white dwarf}} is very hot when it forms, {{but because it}} has no source of energy, it will {{gradually}} radiate its energy and cool. This means that its radiation, which initially has a high color temperature, will lessen and redden with time. Over a very long time, a white dwarf will cool and its material will begin to crystallize (starting with the core). The star's low temperature means it will no longer emit significant <b>heat</b> <b>or</b> light, and {{it will become a}} cold black dwarf. Because the length of time it takes for a white dwarf to reach this state is calculated to be longer than the current age of the universe (approximately 13.8 billion years), it is thought that no black dwarfs yet exist. The oldest white dwarfs still radiate at temperatures of a few thousand kelvins.|$|E
5|$|Animals {{adapted to}} live in deserts are called xerocoles. There is no {{evidence}} that body temperature of mammals and birds is adaptive to the different climates, either of great <b>heat</b> <b>or</b> cold. In fact, with a very few exceptions, their basal metabolic rate is determined by body size, irrespective of the climate in which they live. Many desert animals (and plants) show especially clear evolutionary adaptations for water conservation or heat tolerance and so are often studied in comparative physiology, ecophysiology, and evolutionary physiology. One well-studied example is the specializations of mammalian kidneys shown by desert-inhabiting species. Many examples of convergent evolution have been identified in desert organisms, including between cacti and Euphorbia, kangaroo rats and jerboas, Phrynosoma and Moloch lizards.|$|E
5|$|Increasing general {{physical}} activity has been recommended, but no clear relationship to pain or disability {{has been found}} when used {{for the treatment of}} an acute episode of pain. For acute pain, low- to moderate-quality evidence supports walking. Treatment according to McKenzie method is somewhat effective for recurrent acute low back pain, but its benefit in the short term does not appear significant. There is tentative evidence to support the use of heat therapy for acute and sub-chronic low back pain but little evidence for the use of either <b>heat</b> <b>or</b> cold therapy in chronic pain. Weak evidence suggests that back belts might decrease the number of missed workdays, but there is nothing to suggest that they will help with the pain. Ultrasound and shock wave therapies do not appear effective and therefore are not recommended.|$|E

5|$|The {{volatile}} oil, oleum cubebae, was {{the form}} in which cubeb is most commonly used as a drug, the dose being 5 to 20 minims, which may be suspended in mucilage or given after meals in a wafer. The drug exhibited the typical actions of a volatile oil, but exerted some of these to an exceptional degree. As such, it was liable to cause a cutaneous erythema {{in the course of}} its excretion by the skin, had a marked diuretic action, and was a fairly efficient disinfectant of the urinary passages. Its administration caused the appearance in the urine of a salt of cubebic acid which was precipitated by <b>heat</b> <b>or</b> nitric acid, and was therefore liable to be mistaken for albumin, when these two most common tests for the occurrence of albuminuria were applied.|$|E
5|$|Uranium-235 was {{the first}} isotope that {{was found to be}} fissile. Other {{naturally}} occurring isotopes are fissionable, but not fissile. On bombardment with slow neutrons, its uranium-235 isotope will most of the time divide into two smaller nuclei, releasing nuclear binding energy and more neutrons. If too many of these neutrons are absorbed by other uranium-235 nuclei, a nuclear chain reaction occurs that results in a burst of <b>heat</b> <b>or</b> (in special circumstances) an explosion. In a nuclear reactor, such a chain reaction is slowed and controlled by a neutron poison, absorbing some of the free neutrons. Such neutron absorbent materials are often part of reactor control rods (see nuclear reactor physics for a description of this process of reactor control).|$|E
5|$|Weapons {{range from}} pistols to shotguns, assault rifles, and sniper rifles. Although {{all of them}} have {{unlimited}} ammunition, they overheat if fired continuously for prolonged periods. In addition, the player can use grenades which latch onto targets or flat surfaces to be remotely detonated. Shepard and the squad members are protected by a health bar and damage-absorbing shields. The health bar only takes damage once the shields have been destroyed, but environmental hazards like <b>heat</b> <b>or</b> toxic agents may directly affect the health bar if they are not negated entirely by wearing appropriate armor. The health bar can be restored with the use of items called Medi-gels, while shields automatically regenerate when not taking fire for a brief period. Some talents and equipment items can improve the healing rate or shield regeneration. The player can revive fallen squad members {{with the use of the}} Unity talent. However, if Shepard dies, the player must start the game again from the last saved point.|$|E
