2500|$|As an Illinois State Senator, Obama {{supported}} Senate bill 0099 for [...] "age and developmentally appropriate" [...] sex education, {{which would}} have allowed parents to choose to withdraw their children from the classes. The bill was endorsed by the Illinois Parent Teacher Association, the Illinois State Medical Society, the Illinois Public Health Association, and the Illinois Education Association. In a debate in 2004, when questioned by Alan Keyes {{about what kind of}} sex education was [...] "age appropriate" [...] for kindergarteners, Obama said, [...] "I'll <b>give</b> <b>you</b> <b>an</b> <b>example,</b> because I have a six-year-old daughter and a three-year-old daughter, {{and one of the things}} my wife and I talked to our daughter about is the possibility of somebody touching them inappropriately, and what that might mean. And that was included specifically in the law, so that kindergarteners are able to exercise some possible protection against abuse...." [...] In 2007, in response to a similar attack from Mitt Romney, an Obama spokesperson stated his position that communities should determine the curriculum. The Illinois bill did not call for addressing all sex-related issues in kindergarten classes, and Obama has said that he [...] "does not support teaching explicit sex education to children in kindergarten." ...|$|E

Many a man have I seen in that prison, fast bound with misery though not with iron, and how he was to pay his debt and escape out of it I know not, though I hope that God does know.|$|E

[...] "Every honest man has a duty to the State, and it is {{certainly}} going to cost him more than he gains if he won't discharge it. There are probably more honest men than rogues everywhere, and yet one usually sees the rogues uppermost, for this reason: the honest man won't worry so long as they don't rob him, and his neighbour can't make a fight alone. Nobody is anxious to face the first blow {{for the benefit of the}} rest, and so the rogue gets bolder, until he becomes intolerable. Then the honest man stirs himself, and the rogues go down, though it causes ever so much more trouble than it would have done if the thing had been undertaken earlier. I'll <b>give</b> <b>you</b> <b>an</b> <b>example.</b> Begbie hung a man in British Columbia, the first one who wanted it, and there was order at once.

Reviewer Dean Brown called it [...] "a lengthy jaunt which touches upon the grandiose vocal gymnastics of King Diamond galloping upon hellbound '80s-inspired thrash metal riffs, before descending into the Crypts of Rays with a spiteful Celtic Frost groove".

5000|$|... 2008 saw {{the change}} of England's youth {{national}} women's team moved to the U-23 level. The move {{was made by the}} FA in response to age-level changes FIFA had made to its oldest women's youth competition, now named FIFA U-20 Women's World Cup. The age limit was raised from being a U-19 tournament to a U-20 tournament. This adjustment, coupled with a newly introduced U-23 age limit to the Nordic Cup, prompted the FA to rethink and eventually change the youth development team. The team continues to serve as a stepping-stone for players to the England women's national team. Brent Hills explained that it had become more of a challenge to break into the senior team: [...] "When I started, if you were an extremely talented 18-year-old you may {{have been able to get}} into the senior team.

Many other Chinese dialects have more, for example, Cantonese has six (often numbered as nine, but three are duplicates). In most Western languages, tones are only used to express emphasis or emotion, not to distinguish meanings as in Chinese. A French Jesuit, in a letter, relates how the Chinese tones cause a problem for understanding: I will <b>give</b> <b>you</b> <b>an</b> <b>example</b> of their words. They told me chou in modern Pinyin signifies a book: so that I thought whenever the word chou was pronounced, a book was the subject. Not at all! Chou, the next time I heard it, I found signified a tree. Now I was to recollect, chou was a book, or a tree. But this amounted to nothing; chou, I found, expressed also great heats; chou is to relate; chou is the Aurora; chou means to be accustomed; chou expresses {{the loss of a}} wager, &c.
