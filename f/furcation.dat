25|$|Measuring disease {{progression}} {{is carried out}} by measuring probing pocket depth (PPD) and bleeding indices using a periodontal probe. Pockets greater than 3mm in depth {{are considered to be}} unhealthy. Bleeding on probing {{is considered to be a}} sign of active disease. Discharge of pus, involvement of the root <b>furcation</b> area and deeper pocketing may all indicate reduced prognosis for an individual tooth.|$|E
2500|$|Although periapical {{changes will}} be in {{response}} to pulpal changes {{the majority of the}} time, it is still important to determine the disease process sequence. [...] When the disease process is of pulpal origin, the pulpal infection and necrosis may drain not only through the apical foramen, but also through an accessory canal, which may present radiographically as a periradicular or <b>furcation</b> radiolucency. [...] This may further lead to furcal involvement through loss of clinical attachment and alveolar bone. [...] A cursory clinical examination and radiographic analysis can easily lead the clinician off the right course and pulpal involvement might be overlooked when the tooth is asymptomatic. [...] Similarly, a periodontal abscess may very well appear to be pulpal in origin, when in fact it is not. [...] Notwithstanding the tissue of origin, though, when it is determined that there is a pulpal involvement to the periodontal lesion, the endodontic infection should be controlled prior to beginning definitive management of the periodontal lesion, especially when regenerative or bone grafting techniques are planned.|$|E

50|$|The {{distance}} between the cementoenamel junction (CEJ) and the <b>furcation</b> entrance is called the root trunk length. This distance {{plays an important role}} in <b>furcation</b> defects because the deeper the <b>furcation</b> entrance is within the bone, the more bone loss necessary before the <b>furcation</b> becomes exposed.|$|E
50|$|A tooth with a <b>furcation</b> defect {{typically}} {{possessed a}} more diminished prognosis {{owing to the}} difficulty of rendering the <b>furcation</b> area free from periodontal pathogens.

Here, the possible col- lision of a non-hyperbolic equilibrium with the boundary in a two- parameter framework and the nonlinear phenomena associated with such collision are considered. By dealing with planar discontinuous (Filippov) systems, some of such phenomena are pointed out through specific representative cases.

50|$|Because of its {{importance}} {{in the assessment of}} periodontal disease, a number of methods of classification have evolved to measure and record the severity of <b>furcation</b> involvement; most of the indices are based on horizontal measurements of attachment loss in the <b>furcation.</b>|$|E
5000|$|Grade III - Bone is {{no longer}} {{attached}} to the <b>furcation</b> of the tooth, essentially resulting in a through-and-through tunnel. Because of an angle in this tunnel, however, the <b>furcation</b> {{may not be able}} to be probed in its entirety; if cumulative measurements from different sides equal or exceed the width of the tooth, however, a grade III defect may be assumed. In early grade III lesions, soft tissue may still occlude the <b>furcation</b> involvement, thus, making it difficult to detect.|$|E
50|$|The dental {{professional}} {{with the}} use of a periodontal probe can measure and record a numerical value for various areas on each tooth. These numbers, often referred to as probe measurements, can be assigned to the depth of the gingival sulcus, the location and depth of root <b>furcations,</b> the size and length of oral pathology, the loss of periodontal fiber, the clinical attachment loss (CAL), alveolar bone loss, and help in assessing and determining a periodontal disease classification associated and classified by the American Academy of Periodontology (AAP). Probe measurements are recorded on the periodontal chart in millimetres.|$|R
40|$|The {{purpose of}} this study was to {{determine}} the prevalence of third molars in terms of respondents’ age. Furthermore it was desired to determine the extent of the manifestation of pathological changes, such as caries, apical lesions, and al- veolar bone resorption. This study was based on 500 OPGs of patients from the Faculty of Dentistry, University of Zagreb. Patients were divided into seven age groups. The total number of molars, the number of cavities on remaining molars, the quality of endodontic treatment and the evaluation of their performance and presence of periapical lesions was ana- lyzed. As a part of the periodontal status, the number of inadequate fillings, the number of damaged <b>furcations</b> and bone resorption was analyzed. The statistical analysis was performed by means of STATISTICA 7 statistical package (Stat- Soft, Tulsa, USA). The correlation between the total number of molars and the age of patients was analyzed by means of Spearman’s correlation to the level of significance of 0. 05. The number of first, second and third molars significantly de- creased in higher age groups. The prevalence of caries in third molars as compared to first and second molars was gener- ally lower, third molars were endodontic treated at least. Assessment of involved <b>furcations</b> showed that the lowest per- centage of 8 % was found in third molars. The majority of all remaining molars had bone resorption of 1 – 3 mm...|$|R

40|$|Aims Our {{objectives}} were to 1) examine the ecological adaptability of Potentilla acaulis to grassland degradation {{from the perspective}} of root architecture, 2) reveal why it can be a dominant species in extremely degraded grassland and 3) discuss its important roles in vegetation restoration or succession and preventing grassland fromdesertification. Methods We collected relatively complete P. acaulis roots by trenching. The numbers of first vertical roots, length of horizontal root tillering and number of plant tillers were recorded in the field. The root analysis system of WinRHIZO was used to determine total root length, root surface area, total root volume, root average diameter, number of <b>furcations,</b> average branching angle, number of root axes, length of root axes, number of root tips, number of first lateral roots, length of first lateral roots, number of secondary lateral roots, length of secondary lateral roots, root diameters along root length, root surface area and root volume. The data were analyzed by one-way ANOVA and principal component analysis. Important findings In degraded grassland typified by Stipa grandis, the function of P. acaulis became more important in the community and its root range, root depth, the number of first vertical roots, the number of plant tillers and the length of horizontal root tillering increased significantly. The parameters of root surface area, length of secondary lateral roots, total root length and the number of <b>furcations</b> explained the adaptability of P. acaulis to grassland degradation. Roots with a diameter < 2 mm had a significant effect on root surface area and total root length of single plants of P. acaulis. The three-dimensional root architecture of a broad-waist-inverted centrum was an advantageous configuration for P. acaulis to adapt for grassland degradation and can explain P. acaulis as a constructive species in extremely degraded grassland...|$|R
30|$|Periodontal {{disease is}} a {{heterogeneous}} group of disorders affecting the periodontium, the most common are gingivitis and chronic periodontitis. Substantial evidence indicates that susceptibility to periodontal disease varies among patients and {{is a function of}} both acquired and intrinsic risk factors [21 – 23]. Periodontitis is an irreversible periodontal attachment loss – destruction of periodontal ligament and/or alveolar bone – in some patients [24]. The causal agents of periodontal disease may be appointed as local and systemic factors. Local factors typically include, but are not limited to, dental plaque, gingival inflammation, prior attachment loss, <b>furcations,</b> pocket formation, occlusal trauma and defective restorations. Systemic factors include conditions that result in suppression of the immune system, alterations in endocrine status, and certain medications that specifically affect the gingiva. In addition, specific genetic markers have been linked to susceptibility to periodontitis [21, 24 – 26].|$|R
40|$|Mechanical and {{chemical}} antimicrobial intervention is {{the mainstay of}} preventive periodontal therapy. Successful periodontal maintenance care depends upon the ability of dental professionals to combat periodontal infections and patient compliance with prescribed follow-up care. Since tooth brushing, flossing and oral rinsing do not reach pathogens residing in <b>furcations</b> and at the depths of deep periodontal pockets, adequate oral hygiene should include subgingival treatment with home irrigators or other appropriate self-care remedies in patients with increased pocket depths. I'ovidonc-iodine for professional use and diluted bleach for self-care are iue and antimicrobial agents in periodontal maintenance. The present article outlines the prudent use of antimicrobial therapy in periodontal maintenance therapy.

40|$|Abstract. We {{propose a}} novel trace-based method to extract vessel axes from gray-scale angiograms without {{preliminary}} segmentations. Our method traces the axes on an optimization framework with the bounded spherical projection images and {{the sum of}} squared difference metric. It does not take alternate steps to search the next axial point and its tangent as in other trace-based algorithms, instead the novel method finds the solution simultaneously. This helps avoid U-turns of the trace and large spatial discontinuity of the axial points. Another advantage of the method is that it enables interactive user guidance to produce continuous tracing through regions that contain <b>furcations,</b> disease portions, kissing vessels (vessels {{in close proximity to}} each other) and thin vessels, which pose difficulties for the other algorithms and make re-initialization inevitable as illustrated on synthetic and clinical data sets. ...|$|R
