[...] His first experimental machine, the VS-300, was test flown by Sikorsky on 14 September 1939, tethered by cables. In developing the concept of rotary-wing flight, Sikorsky was the first to introduce a single engine to power both the main and tail rotor systems. The only previous successful attempt at a single-lift rotor helicopter, the Yuriev-Cheremukhin TsAGI-1EA in 1931 in the Soviet Union, used a pair of uprated, Russian-built Gnome Monosoupape rotary engines of 120hp each for its power.

Expansion was rapid, with around 70 machines, mainly hydraulic lifts, connected to the system {{by the end of}} 1889, and a third steam engine had to be installed in mid-1890, which more than doubled the capacity of the system. A fourth pumping engine was added in 1891, by which time there were 100 customers connected to the mains. The mains were a mixture of [...] and [...] pipes.

The Birmingham company agreed, but imposed heavy tolls on traffic using the junction, {{to compensate for}} the loss of revenue of goods which would formerly have travelled via Aldersely Junction. Lord Dudley agreed to sell his tunnel to the Dudley Canal Company, but never received any payment, as the beneficial tolls and usefulness of the new canal were deemed to be adequate compensation. An Act of Parliament was obtained in July 1785 to authorise the work, which had been surveyed by John Snape and John Bull, and checked by Dadford, who then became consulting engineer. Abraham Lees was the on-site <b>engineering</b> <b>manager,</b> and the main contract for the tunnel went to John Pinkerton. Its width was to be , with [...] of headroom and [...] of water.

It is difficult to monitor all the supply chain performance metric for managers in supply chain. It is necessary to identify actual value metric for all supply chain stakeholders and define correlation between them. There is a lack of definition for supply chain value metrics to create value for all stakeholders. Managers usually continue to pursue supply chain metrics as a means to increase value without attention on what really mean value in supply chain. We defined actual supply chain value metrics according to proposed framework. According to the results, <b>engineering</b> <b>managers</b> can identify the most important metrics and their effects on other BSC perspectives for applying lean manufacturing, line balancing, and dynamic facilities layout approaches to improve supply chain performance. High quality, low price, product development and, etc., are the competitive metrics in turbulent market place to survive, therefore business practices are essential fields for engineering function. Applying a proposed framework can guide <b>engineering</b> <b>managers</b> to redesign supply chain process according to value metrics.
