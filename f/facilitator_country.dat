40|$|Abstract Background The Integrated Management of Childhood Illness Strategy (IMCI), {{developed}} by WHO/UNICEF, aims {{to contribute to}} reducing childhood morbidity and mortality (MDG 4) in resource-limited settings. Since 1996 more than 100 countries have adopted IMCI. IMCI case management training (ICMT) {{is one of three}} IMCI components and training is usually residential over 11 consecutive days. Follow-up after ICMT {{is an essential part of}} training. We describe the barriers to rapid acceleration of ICMT and review country perspectives on how to address these barriers. Methods A multi-country exploratory cross-sectional questionnaire survey of in-service ICMT approaches, using quantitative and qualitative methods, was conducted in 2006 - 7 : 27 countries were purposively selected from all six WHO regions. Data for this paper are from three questionnaires (QA, QB and QC), distributed to selected national focal IMCI persons/programme officers, course directors/facilitators and IMCI trainees respectively. QC only gathered data on experiences with IMCI follow-up. Results 33 QA, 163 QB and 272 QC were received. The commonest challenges to ICMT scale-up relate to funding (high cost and long duration of the residential ICMT), poor literacy of health workers, differing opinions about the role of IMCI in improving child health, lack of political support, frequent changes in staff or rules at Ministries of Health and lack of skilled <b>facilitators.</b> <b>Countries</b> addressed these challenges in several ways including increased advocacy, developing strategic linkages with other priorities, intensifying pre-service training, re-distribution of funds and shortening course duration. The commonest challenges to follow-up after ICMT were lack of funding (93. 1 % of respondents), inadequate funds for travelling or planning (75. 9 % and 44. 8 % respectively), lack of gas for travelling (41. 4 %), inadequately trained or few supervisors (41. 4 %) and inadequate job aids for follow-up (27. 6 %). Countries addressed these by piggy backing IMCI follow-up with routine supervisory visits. Conclusions Financial challenges to ICMT scale-up and follow-up after training are common. As IMCI is accepted globally as one of the key strategies to meet MDG 4 several steps need to be taken to facilitate rapid acceleration of ICMT, including reviewing core competencies followed by competency-driven shortened training duration or 'on the job' training, 'distance learning' or training using mobile phones. Linkages with other 'better-funded' programmes e. g. HIV or malaria need to be improved. Routine Primary Health Care (PHC) supervision needs to include follow-up after ICMT. </p...|$|R
40|$|Collaborative {{programmes}} typically {{involve a}} combination of face-to-face and online collaborative engagement between organisations. Individuals and groups within those organisations need to effectively work together across distance, time and cultural norms. The core competencies needed by group leaders to effectively facilitate the online aspects of these communication activities is an emerging area within our expanding knowledge of intercultural collaborative exchange between institutions. Drawing {{on a number of}} facilitated online discussions, involving 65 practicing group <b>facilitators</b> from 18 <b>countries,</b> this paper presents an initial series of Online Facilitator Competencies that were synthesised from conversations within a series of online facilitation skills training programmes held over five years. These competencies provide a new framework for an expanding awareness of the complexity and skills required of group leaders in intercultural collaborative programmes. The framework presents six areas of online facilitator competencies and the skills, knowledge, and attitudes necessary to demonstrate those competencies...|$|R
40|$|The goal of {{this study}} is to examine how to {{facilitate}} cross-cultural groups in problem-based learning (PBL) using online digital tools and videos. The PBL consisted of two video-based cases used to trigger student-learning issues about giving bad news to HIV-positive patients. Mixed groups of medical students from Canada and Hong Kong worked with <b>facilitators</b> from each <b>country</b> along with an expert facilitator. The study used AdobeConnect to support the international model through synchronous video interaction and shared applications. This study examines strategies and challenges in facilitating PBL across distance and cultures. Discourse was analyzed using both an inductive and deductive approach where the later used the Community of Inquiry coding scheme. The international context provides a way to facilitate multiple perspectives about how to communicate bad news to patients from different cultural backgrounds. In addition, we present the results of an exploratory analysis of pre and post tests using a standardized patient that demonstrate that the students’ pattern of communication showed qualitative change. Several conjectures were developed for future research...|$|R
40|$|Bibliography: p. 95 - 108. Land {{restitution}} is {{an inevitable}} {{consequence of the}} new dispensation in South Africa. Restitution aims to return people to land dispossessed because of racial laws corresponding to the Land Act of 1913. An alternative is to compensate the victims in other appropriate mechanisms. In facilitating this aspiration the present study proposes, as a solution, the biblical Jubilee as in (Leviticus 25) reiterated by Jesus in (Luke 4 : 16 - 30) and further adopted by the Christian Tradition as a theological submission. The Jubilee concept, from its biblical inception, was designed to resolve the landlessness experienced by deprived Jews in ancient Israel. This model has been adopted by various scholars as a guideline in solving similar problems in modern societies. A theological view is deemed necessary since the legal, political, economic, and agricultural systems have failed to emphasise the moral dimension in reparation and land restitution. The Christian Church in South Africa is identified as the prime <b>facilitator</b> in this <b>country's</b> nation building process. It should therefore assume {{a leadership role in}} this process through, in this instance, translating the Jubilee concept in the transformation in our modern society...|$|R
40|$|Objectives: The {{implementation}} of new health services {{is a complex}} process. This study investigated {{the first phase of}} the adaptive {{implementation of}} the Dutch Meeting Centres Support Programme (MCSP) for people with dementia and their carers in three European countries (Italy, Poland, the UK) within the JPND-MEETINGDEM project. Anticipated and experienced factors influencing the implementation, and the efficacy of the implementation process, were investigated. Findings were compared with previous research in the Netherlands. Method: A qualitative multiple case study design was applied. Checklist on anticipated facilitators and barriers to the implementation and semi-structured interview were completed by stakeholders, respectively at the end and at the beginning of the preparation phase. Results: Overall, few differences between <b>countries</b> were founded. <b>Facilitators</b> for all <b>countries</b> were: added value of MCSP matching needs of the target group, evidence of effectiveness of MCSP, enthusiasm of stakeholders. General barriers were: competition with existing care and welfare organizations and scarce funding. Some countries experienced improved collaborations, others had difficulties finding a socially integrated location for MCSP. The step-by-step implementation method proved efficacious. Conclusion: These insights into factors influencing the implementation of MCSP in three European countries and the efficacy of the step-by-step preparation may aid further implementation of MCSP in Europ...|$|R
40|$|This {{dissertation}} {{focuses on}} the need of professionalizing family managed firms and it also study’s the financial structure of these firms. To empirically show the benefits of recruiting professional managers, financial comparison of family and non-family managed firms {{has been done in}} this paper. The subject firms were opted from the textile sector of India because {{it is one of the}} world’s largest sectors, with huge raw material and manufacturing base. Today this sector is highly globalized but it is further organizing itself due to deregulation of world textile quotas in the year 2005. Though this sector has carved out a niche for itself as a <b>facilitator</b> of the <b>country’s</b> economic growth, but still a lot is to be done to face the competition. The study elucidates review of the literature on professionalization of family managed firms and its sources of finance. The importance and concerns of both these issues are also examined. Then both qualitative and quantitative methods are employed to test the predetermined hypothesis. Ratio analyses, surveys, interviews and an internship were conducted by the author to conclude the results. This study is an attempt to compare existing family controlled management structure with innovative professionalized approach. The benefits and dilemmas of both the techniques are analysed. At the end it is concluded that hiring professional managers is a must to achieve growth but control of owners over the firm is equally significant...|$|R

40|$|Poster Presentations: {{abstract}} no. P- 35 A {{case study}} is presented of an international technology rich learning module that uses a problem based learning video based approach to trigger student learning issues about giving bad news to HIV patients. The role of emotion and culture is explored in this context. Mixed groups of medical students from Canada and Hong Kong work with <b>facilitators</b> from each <b>country.</b> Technology supports PBL {{through the use of}} transparent examples of how experts solve cases involving physician-patient communication. Adobe connect supports the international model through synchronous video interaction and shared applications. After the instructional sessions, each student practices giving bad news to standardized patients using video-conferencing tools. Students receive feedback on their physician-patient communication from experts assessing their performance. The case study supports several types of data analyses. Pre-post test measures address students’ motivation and ability to identify the important aspects of physician-patient communication. The instructional discourse will be analyzed for: the type of affective content considered pertinent to each case, cultural differences between Canada and Hong Kong students, and types of instructor facilitation. The practice discourse with standardized patients examines student ability to transfer what they have learned from the instructional models to patient communication skills. We anticipate that medical students will improve their ability to regulate physician-patient communication. Such regulation will include cognitive, metacognitive, and emotional regulation of knowing what to do and when to do it, and knowing how to communicate {{in a manner that is}} most appropriate given a set of circumstances. postprintThe 2011 Simulation Summit of the Royal College of Physicians and Surgeons of Canada (RCPSC), Montreal, QC., 3 - 4 November 2011...|$|R

Maradeka {{push for}} {{resumption}} of peace negotiations between Philippines and Moro Islamic Liberation Front (MILF) which was impeded {{caused by the}} diplomatic impasse over the disagreement on the choice of third <b>country</b> <b>facilitator</b> and the facilitation process. See the article: Muslims want government to break impasse. In another tussles in Mindanao peace process, Mindanao peace advocates, on the other hand, had decried the public quibbling over the proposed Bangsamoro substate as counter-productive at this crucial stage of the peace negotiations. Maradeka secretary general Nash Pangadapun also cautioned the public against such premature comments pending the government's submission of its counter-proposal, and called for sobriety. In a very recent development, Maradeka lauded the pronouncement of Secretary Teresita Quintos Deles for the formal signing of peace pact by the Philippine government with the largest Moro rebel front, Moro Islamic Liberation Front (MILF) on March 27, 2014 adding, “After 17 long years of arduous negotiations, we are finally arriving at a political settlement that will seal enduring peace and progress in Mindanao,” Presidential Adviser on the Peace Process Teresita Quintos Deles said Friday. “The signing of the CAB is expected to benefit not only the Bangsamoro but the entire country, and will radiate beyond our borders to the regional community, and perhaps the whole world.” In a step up for massive information drive thru government controlled Television Network, Maradeka Secretary General Nash Pangadapun urged the spoilers who are out to obstruct the peace deal from coming to fruition to back off and called on the enemies of peace to have [...] "change of heart" [...] as this historic signing to be attended by mediating countries and international communities hoped to end violence against women and children.|$|R
40|$|OBJECTIVE: Conduct {{a global}} {{situational}} analysis {{to identify the}} current facilitators and barriers to improving quality of care (QoC) for pregnant women, newborns and children. STUDY DESIGN: Metareview of published and unpublished systematic reviews and meta-analyses conducted between January 2000 and March 2013 in any language. Assessment of Multiple Systematic Reviews (AMSTAR) is {{used to assess the}} methodological quality of systematic reviews. SETTINGS: Health systems of all countries. Study outcome: QoC measured using surrogate indicators [...] effective, efficient, accessible, acceptable/patient centred, equitable and safe. ANALYSIS: Conducted in two phases (1) qualitative synthesis of extracted data to identify and group the facilitators and barriers to improving QoC, {{for each of the three}} population groups, into the six domains of WHO's framework and explore new domains and (2) an analysis grid to map the common facilitators and barriers. RESULTS: We included 98 systematic reviews with 110 interventions to improve QoC from <b>countries</b> globally. The <b>facilitators</b> and barriers identified fitted the six domains of WHO's framework [...] information, patient-population engagement, leadership, regulations and standards, organisational capacity and models of care. Two new domains, 'communication' and 'satisfaction', were generated. Facilitators included active and regular interpersonal communication between users and providers; respect, confidentiality, comfort and support during care provision; engaging users in decision-making; continuity of care and effective audit and feedback mechanisms. Key barriers identified were language barriers in information and communication; power difference between users and providers; health systems not accounting for user satisfaction; variable standards of implementation of standard guidelines; shortage of resources in health facilities and lack of studies assessing the role of leadership in improving QoC. These were common across the three population groups. CONCLUSIONS: The barriers to good-quality healthcare are common for pregnant women, newborns and children; thus, interventions targeted to address them will have uniform beneficial effects. Adopting the identified <b>facilitators</b> would help <b>countries</b> strengthen their health systems and ensure high-quality care for all...|$|R
40|$|Background: Implementation of World Health Organization case {{management}} guidelines for serious childhood illnesses remains {{a challenge in}} hospitals in low-income <b>countries.</b> <b>Facilitators</b> of and barriers to implementation of locally adapted clinical practice guidelines (CPGs) have not been explored. Methods. This ethnographic study based on the theory of participatory action research (PAR) was conducted in Kenyatta National Hospital, Kenya's largest teaching hospital. The primary intervention consisted of dissemination of locally adapted CPGs. The PRECEDE-PROCEED health education model {{was used as the}} conceptual framework to guide and examine further reinforcement activities to improve the uptake of the CPGs. Activities focussed on introduction of routine clinical audits and tailored educational sessions. Data were collected by a participant observer who also facilitated the PAR over an eighteen-month period. Naturalistic inquiry was utilized to obtain information from all hospital staff encountered while theoretical sampling allowed in-depth exploration of emerging issues. Data were analysed using interpretive description. Results: Relevance of the CPGs to routine work and emergence of a champion of change facilitated uptake of best-practices. Mobilization of basic resources was relatively easily undertaken while activities that required real intellectual and professional engagement of the senior staff were a challenge. Accomplishments of the PAR were largely with the passive rather than active involvement of the hospital management. Barriers to implementation of best-practices included i) mismatch between the hospital's vision and reality, ii) poor communication, iii) lack of objective mechanisms for monitoring and evaluating quality of clinical care, iv) limited capacity for planning strategic change, v) limited management skills to introduce and manage change, vi) hierarchical relationships, and vii) inadequate adaptation of the interventions to the local context. Conclusions: Educational interventions, often regarded as 'quick-fixes' to improve care in low-income countries, may be necessary but are unlikely to be sufficient to deliver improved services. We propose that an understanding of organizational issues that influence the behaviour of individual health professionals should guide and inform the implementation of best-practices. © 2014 Irimu et al.; licensee BioMed Central Ltd...|$|R
40|$|The {{purpose of}} this study was to {{determine}} the characteristics of effective facilitators of nonformal education (NFE) in Ecuador in order to (a) more completely understand the nature of NFE; (b) evaluate the success of the Project; and (c) develop guidelines for training <b>facilitators</b> in other <b>countries.</b> Thirteen experts (six Ecuadorian and seven North American staff members of the Project) brainstormed a list of skills, knowledge areas, and attitudes, of effective facilitators of NFE in community-based learning groups. The responses combined with items found in a review of literature of NFE, the Ecuador project, community development, and teacher effectiveness, became the Preliminary List of Facilitator Characteristics. This list, consolidated into sixty general characteristics, was divided into (a) criteria for selecting facilitator trainees and (b) characteristics of facilitators after training. The sixty items became a second questionnaire. Each expert rated the appropriateness and importance of each item. The results of this second questionnaire were resubmitted to the experts to reconsider and rate a second time. At least one-half of the experts agreed to the degree of importance of all except one item. Weighting the expert 2 ̆ 7 s responses resulted in a rank order of the relative importance of each item. Two comparison groups with similar experience but little or no knowledge of the Ecuador Project also rated each item. The comparison groups confirmed the ratings of importance given by the experts. Variations between groups which occurred in the rank order of items are apparently a result of experience with the Ecuador Project. A process was also used to demonstrate how the general skills, knowledge areas, and attitudes, can be stated as observable behaviors for particular settings. Through this process, the operationalization of the goal or intent, the results of the study can be adapted to diverse settings and facilitator training programs can be elaborated for particular geographic and cultural situations. The study also confirmed the utility of the Delphi in clarifying a group opinion. By providing feedback on the response to a previous questionnaire and by asking the respondents to reevaluate their individual opinions, a group consensus develops which research has shown to be more useful than an individual opinion, a single questionnaire, or a group discussion...|$|R
