500|$|The film {{received}} positive {{reviews in}} trade publications. The Moving Picture World review said. [...] "Probably {{the story of}} Rip Van Winkle as told by Washington Irving {{will always be a}} delight. Surely the Rip Van Winkle, as depicted by the late Joseph Jefferson, will linger long in the memory of those fortunate enough to have seen it. Unquestionably, however, the third in the list of delights is this film from Thanhouser which tells the story over again {{in much the same way}} that Jefferson told it. The Rip of Jefferson and the Rip of Irving are two different versions, though both do substantially the same things. ... It is a good piece of work from every standpoint. The actors have entered into the spirit of the story and have depicted it with close adherence to the facts as they are related in the original. The stage manager understood what was required to make the background appear natural, while the photographer handled the camera with full knowledge of the requirements." [...] The New York Dramatic Mirror reviewer also agreed and commended the film by stating, [...] "The Thanhouser Company has done very well with this old legend, paying particular attention to details. ... The acting is exceptionally good for a story representing that era of time, and the adaption <b>is</b> <b>very</b> <b>clear</b> to the spectator." ...|$|E
500|$|As {{reported}} by The Korea Times, {{the thought of}} Gothel being a villain who is both a [...] "greedy, selfish woman and a mother figure to Rapunzel" [...] was initially [...] "perplexing" [...] for animator Jin Kim, and it wasn't until after Kim heard Gothel's [...] "Mother Knows Best" [...] {{for the first time}} that he [...] "came up with the 1940s Hollywood screen siren motif" [...] for the character. The directors also strived to make it obvious that Mother Gothel and Rapunzel are not related. Greno told Animation World Network, [...] "When they're standing together, it <b>is</b> <b>very</b> <b>clear</b> that this is not a mother and daughter, just by the frames of their bodies, their hair, the pigments of their skin," [...] as opposed to when Rapunzel is in close proximity with her true parents, the King and Queen. Howard added that, in comparison to Rapunzel, [...] "Gothel is very tall and curvy, she’s very voluptuous, she’s got this very exotic look to her. Even down to that curly hair, we’re trying to say visually that this is not this girl’s mother." [...] The animators studied footage of Murphy in order to get [...] "ideas about facial expressions" [...] and [...] "gestures." [...] After much speculation, the directors finally admitted that, in addition to Murphy, Gothel's physical appearance was in fact influenced by American singer Cher. Howard explained that this was [...] "because Cher is very exotic and Gothic looking," [...] continuing that the singer [...] "definitely was one of the people we looked at visually, as far as what gives you a striking character." ...|$|E
