5|$|In {{addition}} to his music career, Keenan has ventured into fields such as acting, improvisational sketch comedy, and winemaking. He currently owns Merkin Vineyards and the associated winery Caduceus Cellars.

5|$|The rolls {{were written}} in Latin until 1733, except {{for a short time}} around 1650. During the reign of Henry II, a {{duplicate}} copy of the year's Pipe roll was made for the Chancellor, and was called the Chancellor's roll. This was created {{at the same time as}} the regular Pipe roll, and was written by a clerk of the Chancellor. The Chancellor rolls survive from 1163 to 1832, but are basically duplicates of the corresponding Pipe rolls, except <b>for</b> <b>the</b> <b>occasional</b> addition of a private charter or other material.|$|E

5|$|In {{its last}} two years of operation, wartime rises in costs made the fixed fare {{structure}} untenable, and between July 1939 and January 1941 there were five slight adjustments to the fares. The live passenger rates rose to 7s5d in first class and 2s6d in third class, with equivalent changes to the fares for coffins. These fares remained far cheaper than the equivalent fares from Waterloo to Brookwood for both living and dead passengers on the Southern Railway (SR), which had absorbed the LSWR in the 1923 restructuring of Britain's railways. The fare structure of January 1941 remained in use following the April 1941 suspension of London Necropolis Railway services, <b>for</b> <b>the</b> <b>occasional</b> funerals conducted by the LNC using the SR's platforms at Waterloo station, but the SR only allowed mourners attending funerals to use these cheap fares and not those visiting the cemetery.|$|E
5|$|Shepard {{attended}} Adams School in Derry, {{where his}} academic performance impressed his teachers; he skipped the sixth grade, {{and proceeded to}} middle school at Oak Street School in Derry, where he skipped the eighth grade. In 1936, {{he went to the}} Pinkerton Academy, a private school in Derry that his father had attended, and where his grandfather had been a trustee. He completed years 9 to 12 there. Fascinated by flight, he created a model airplane club at the Academy, and his Christmas present in 1938 was a flight in a Douglas DC-3. The following year he began cycling to Manchester Airfield, where he would do odd jobs in exchange <b>for</b> <b>the</b> <b>occasional</b> ride in an airplane or informal flying lesson.|$|E
5|$|To his supporters, Quisling was {{regarded}} as a conscientious administrator of the highest order, knowledgeable and with an eye for detail. Balanced and gentle to a fault, they believed he cared deeply about his people and maintained high moral standards throughout. To his opponents, Quisling was unstable and undisciplined, abrupt, even threatening. Quite possibly he was both, at ease among friends and under pressure when confronted with his political opponents, and generally shy and retiring with both. During formal dinners he often said nothing at all except <b>for</b> <b>the</b> <b>occasional</b> cascade of dramatic rhetoric. Indeed, he did not react well to pressure and would often let slip over-dramatic sentiments when put on the spot. Normally open to criticism, he was prone to assuming larger groups were conspiratorial.|$|E

25|$|Village {{tradition}} had it {{that the}} current St Catherine's Church was predated by an older building which was destroyed by fire.

He {{is thought to have}} benefited from the sale of dance music written in his role as Imperial chamber composer. Mozart no longer borrowed large sums from Puchberg, and made a start on paying off his debts.|$|E
25|$|The {{municipality}} {{is located}} in the Sierra Papanteca, which is a series of low mountains with numerous valleys. The most notable peaks are the La Jarana, Pelón, El campanario, La Palma, De la Cruz, Del Jazmín, del Grillo, de Dolores and Del Clavel. Small rivers which feed into the Tecolutla, and Texistepec Rivers pass through here, such as the Tlahuanapa, Santa Agueda and the Poza Verde. The area is heavily forested with subtropical perennial foliage with trees such as the heliocarpus, laurel, cedar and ceiba. It contains 17km of mostly virgin beaches. The coastline includes the Boquila Estuary, Playa Chichinit, Rancho Playa, Playa Olmo, Tenixtepec and Boca de Lima. Most of the animal life consists of small mammals such as rabbits, raccoons and coyotes along with various species of birds and snakes. The area is considered to be tropical rainforest with most rain falling between May and August. September and October are notable <b>for</b> <b>the</b> <b>occasional</b> hurricane.|$|E
25|$|Undaunted by career setbacks, Miller tried {{her hand}} with smaller studios such as Monogram and Republic Pictures, though she would still work <b>for</b> <b>the</b> <b>occasional</b> big studio. Miller also made further incursions in the then-new medium of television, which she began before her {{contract}} with Paramount was dropped. Despite {{the demands of}} raising a family, the 1950s would be Miller's most prolific years, seeing her as a television regular. Throughout the '50s, {{she was able to}} display a broader acting range than when under Paramount and Hal Wallis. Although she missed out on playing Lizabeth Scott's character's younger sister in Paid in Full, she played a younger sister in the noirish Shadow on the Wall (1950), which also involved two sisters competing over the same man. The elder sister, played by Ann Sothern, discovers that her younger, married sister is having an affair with Sothern's fiancé, which leads to murderous results and short screen-time for Miller. Production ran April 11–mid-May 1949. Though never leaving the noir genre, Miller would begin her reputation for Westerns with Young Daniel Boone (1950), but as the female lead. Production ran mid-October–late October 1949.|$|E

25|$|The 2013–14 season {{marked the}} Jupiler League debut of the Ajax reserves' squad, Jong Ajax. Previously {{playing in the}} Beloften Eredivisie (a {{separate}} league for reserve teams, {{not included in the}} Dutch professional or amateur league structure), players were allowed to move around freely between the reserve team and the first team during the season. This is no longer the case as Jong Ajax now registers and fields a separate squad from that of Ajax first team for the Eerste Divisie, the second tier of professional football in the Netherlands. Their home matches are played at Sportpark De Toekomst, except <b>for</b> <b>the</b> <b>occasional</b> match in the Amsterdam Arena. Now regarded a semi-professional team in their own respect, the only period in which players are able to move between squads are during the transfer windows, unless the player has made less than 15 appearances for the first team, then he is still eligible to appear in both first team and second team matches during the season. Furthermore, the team is not eligible for promotion to the Eredivisie or to participate in the KNVB Cup. Jong Ajax were joined in the Eerste Divisie by Jong Twente and Jong PSV, reserve teams who have also moved from the Beloften Eredivisie to the Eerste Divisie, in place of VV Katwijk, SC Veendam and AGOVV Apeldoorn, increasing the total number of teams in the Jupiler League from 18 to 20.|$|E
25|$|Although the {{political}} capital of Chiapas {{was moved to}} Tuxtla {{at the end of}} the 19th century, San Cristóbal is considered to be the “cultural capital” of the state. Designated a “Pueblo Mágico” (Magical Village) in 2003, it was further recognized as “The most magical of the Pueblos Mágicos” by President Felipe Calderón in 2010. Much of this culture is associated with the city’s and municipality’s large indigenous population, which is mostly made up of Tzotzils and Tzeltals. One aspect of traditional culture associated with these indigenous groups is the making of textiles, with amber another important product. Ceramics, wrought iron and filigree jewelry can be found as well. The best known area for crafts is the tianguis at Santo Domingo. The city hosts an annual Amber Expo at the Centro de Convenciones Casa de Mazariegos. The event exhibits and sells amber and amber pieces from the area of the state. A more traditional Mexican market is located just north of the Santo Tomas Church. It is open each day except Sunday, when its vendors go to the surrounding communities in the municipality to sell at their markets. On the days that it is open, the large building, which mostly houses traditional butcher shops, is surrounded by stalls which crowd the nearby streets. There are very few tourists here, except <b>for</b> <b>the</b> <b>occasional</b> backpacker. Markets like this serve traditional dishes such as saffron tamales, sopa de pan, asado coleto, atole de granillo and a drink called posh made from sugar cane.|$|E
500|$|Before {{the white}} {{settlement}} of the region, the area that is now East Lansing {{was a combination of}} dense virgin oak forest and tamarack swampland. In July 1855 a 677-acre site just north of the Red Cedar River was recommended to the State Board of Education, the report to the board noted that except <b>for</b> <b>the</b> <b>occasional</b> clearing the land was dense hardwood forest. It was in one of these [...] "oak openings" [...] that the school built its first three buildings in 1856: a multipurpose building called College Hall, a dormitory building later known as [...] "Saints' Rest," [...] and a barn. College Hall contained classrooms, offices, laboratories, a library/museum, and a multifunctional lecture hall/chapel.

5000|$|One {{generation}} after Aristotle, Epicurus argued that as atoms {{moved through the}} void, there were occasions when they would [...] "swerve" [...] (clinamen) from their otherwise determined paths, thus initiating new causal chains.

500|$|When {{creating}} a character, his process was to draw their {{face and body}} type first, and then the clothes, while thinking if the fighters can move around in them.

Toriyama was not concerned about consistency with the color of characters' clothes <b>for</b> <b>the</b> <b>occasional</b> color pages, having sometimes used different ones than he had before. He even specifically asked Torishima to produce as few color pages as possible. Character names are almost always puns sharing a theme with characters related to them, most commonly food.

500|$|Critics {{applauded the}} growing {{relationship}} between Andrea and Shane, {{as well as}} Dale's confrontation with Shane.

[...] "There's {{something to be said}} <b>for</b> <b>the</b> <b>occasional</b> post-apocalyptic tryst, which allows two characters who've experienced almost nothing but misery to have, even for a moment, something that resembles joy," [...] he articulated. Meslow retorted that it was wise to underplay the tryst between Shane and Andrea, which he predicted would not lead to anything serious. Venable wrote: [...] " [...] Dale’s lack of personality traits, beyond being the wise sage who gets in everyone’s business, makes him an unpredictable foe in my book, and could be as interesting as Shane’s violent selfishness." [...] Morgan Jeffrey of Digital Spy avouched that Shane continued to be an interesting character; [...] "Just as we were beginning to like him again, he murdered Otis in cold blood. And it seems like his downward spiral is set to continue—he's threatening poor Dale and embarking on an ill-advised affair with Andrea." ...|$|E
