6000|$|... "Ran, did he? H'm! Well, it's {{considerably}} {{later than}} his usual {{time to go}} home to his Alfuro wife; but to be seen running is a sort of degradation for Wang, who has mastered the art of vanishing. <b>Do</b> <b>you</b> <b>think</b> <b>he</b> <b>was</b> startled out of his perfection by something?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I see he's {{giving you}} a long rope," [...] said the Captain. [...] "But that can't change a man's convictions. I know the Author respects me; I feel it in my bones: when you and I had that talk at the {{blockhouse}} door, who <b>do</b> <b>you</b> <b>think</b> <b>he</b> <b>was</b> for, my man?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "But she doesn't. Mamma isn't {{afraid of}} anything. That's why she lets me play out here alone when I want. Why, {{we had a}} robber once. Mamma got right up and found him. And what <b>do</b> <b>you</b> <b>think!</b> <b>He</b> <b>was</b> only a poor hungry man. And she got him plenty to eat from the pantry, and {{afterward}} she got him work to do." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Well, what <b>did</b> <b>you</b> <b>think</b> of his urging {{us to go}} to the race? <b>Do</b> <b>you</b> <b>think</b> <b>he</b> meant it? <b>Do</b> <b>you</b> <b>think</b> <b>he</b> {{intended}} it for an invitation?" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Don't for {{a moment}} think, dearest, that what he said, made me uneasy as {{regarded}} you: but whom <b>do</b> <b>you</b> <b>think</b> <b>he</b> selected for you--of whom <b>do</b> <b>you</b> <b>think</b> <b>he</b> is jealous?" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "But {{you know}} him well, Watson. He is such an inscrutable fellow that I never quite {{know what to make}} of him. <b>Do</b> <b>you</b> <b>think</b> <b>he</b> is hopeful? <b>Do</b> <b>you</b> <b>think</b> <b>he</b> expects to make a success of it?" ...|$|R
60|$|One jump! Would {{he be able}} {{to reach}} it? Two jumps! There was a hole in it! Three jumps! With another frightened squeak, Danny dived into the opening just in time. And what <b>do</b> <b>you</b> <b>think</b> <b>he</b> <b>was</b> in? Why, an old tomato can Farmer Brown's boy had once used to carry bait in when he went fishing at the Smiling Pool. He had dropped it there on his way home.|$|E
6000|$|... "Mother, I don't {{believe the}} Good Old Man had a grea' deal of courage. All the way Over the Mountains, he'd seem to scare at any little noise, even in broad daylight. Oncet, when we was goin' along through the woods, a pig {{jumped out of}} some hazel-nut bushes, and scared him so that he yelled and fell down in a fit, and they was a good while fetchin' him to. <b>Do</b> <b>you</b> <b>think</b> <b>he</b> <b>was</b> God, mother?" ...|$|E
60|$|Unc' Billy Possum lay {{curled up}} under the hay in the highest nest in the darkest corner in Farmer Brown's hen-house. Unc' Billy didn't dare go to sleep, because {{he was afraid that}} Farmer Brown's boy might find him. And, anyway, he wanted to see just what Farmer Brown's boy was doing. So peeping out, he watched Farmer Brown's boy, who seemed to be very busy indeed. What <b>do</b> <b>you</b> <b>think</b> <b>he</b> <b>was</b> doing? Unc' Billy knew. Yes, Sir, Unc' Billy knew just what Farmer Brown's boy was doing. He was setting traps.|$|E
6000|$|... "Do {{you mean}} about the lawsuit? I don't care for that! <b>Do</b> <b>you</b> <b>think</b> <b>he</b> will hate me when <b>he</b> sees me? <b>Do</b> <b>you</b> <b>think</b> <b>he</b> will believe me when I {{tell him that}} I never meant to leave him, and that I'm sorry for what I did to drive him away?" ...|$|R
6000|$|But again, we {{read that}} the Spirit of God takes of the things of Christ, and shows them unto us. And what are the things of Christ? They must be eternal things, {{unchangeable}} things, for Christ is unchangeable--Jesus Christ, the same yesterday, to-day, and for ever. He is over all, God blessed for ever. To Him all power is given in heaven and earth. He reigns, and <b>He</b> will reign. <b>Do</b> <b>you</b> <b>think</b> <b>He</b> is less a Saviour now, than He was when He spoke those things to John's disciples? <b>Do</b> <b>you</b> <b>think</b> <b>He</b> is less able to hear and to help than He was in John's time? <b>Do</b> <b>you</b> <b>think</b> <b>He</b> used to care about people's bodies then, but that He only cares about their souls now? <b>Do</b> <b>you</b> <b>think</b> that <b>He</b> is less compassionate, and less merciful, as well as less powerful, than He was when He made the blind see, and the lame walk, and the deaf hear, in Judaea of old? ...|$|R
6000|$|... "But <b>do</b> <b>you</b> <b>think</b> <b>he</b> {{suspects}} me?" [...] {{asked the}} captain, with anxiety, after pausing {{to listen to}} Caesar's opinion of the Skinners.|$|R
6000|$|The {{whistling}} stopped. Everything was quiet. Grandfather Frog {{waited and}} listened, {{but not a}} sound could he hear. Then he saw a little ray of light creeping into his prison. He squirmed and pushed, {{and all of a}} sudden he was out of the pocket. The bright light made him blink. As soon as he could see, he looked to see where he was. Then he rubbed his eyes with both hands and looked again. He wasn't at Farmer Brown's house at all. Where <b>do</b> <b>you</b> <b>think</b> <b>he</b> <b>was?</b> Why, right on the bank of the Smiling Pool, and a little way off was Farmer Brown's boy fishing! ...|$|E
6000|$|... 'Look! he's beckoning {{the rest}} of you to come; he's got a fine buffalo!' And others who were {{doubtful}} would jump in, until not one was left. Then the cunning goldsmith went back and took all the village for himself, and became very rich indeed. But <b>do</b> <b>you</b> <b>think</b> <b>he</b> <b>was</b> happy? Not a bit. Lies never made a man happy yet. Truly, he got the better of a set of wicked and greedy people, but only by being wicked and greedy himself; and, as it turned out, when he got so rich he got very fat; and at last was so fat that he couldn't move, and one day he got the apoplexy and died, and no one in the world cared the least bit.|$|E
60|$|Reddy chuckled at his thoughts, {{and what}} <b>do</b> <b>you</b> <b>think</b> <b>he</b> <b>was</b> {{thinking}} about? Why, {{about how he}} had seen Farmer Brown's boy carrying off Unc' Billy Possum by the tail the afternoon before. He knew how Farmer Brown's boy had caught Unc' Billy in the hen-house, and with his own eyes he had seen Unc' Billy carried off. Of course Unc' Billy was dead. There could be no doubt about it. And Reddy was glad of it. Yes, Sir, Reddy was glad of it. Unc' Billy Possum had made altogether too many friends in the Green Forest and on the Green Meadows, and he had made Reddy the laughing-stock of them all {{by the way he}} had dared Reddy to meet Bowser the Hound, and actually had waited for Bowser while Reddy ran away.|$|E
6000|$|... "Tom, <b>do</b> <b>you</b> <b>think</b> <b>he</b> {{could have}} fallen over some cliff and {{rolled to the}} bottom of the mountain?" [...] {{questioned}} Sam, anxiously.|$|R
6000|$|... "Very true--I will {{remember}} that an Indian {{likes to do}} one thing at a time. Which way, then, <b>do</b> <b>you</b> <b>think</b> <b>he's</b> travelling?" ...|$|R
6000|$|... 'Do <b>you</b> <b>think</b> <b>he</b> won't?' cried Miss Petowker, really showing great {{capability}} for the stage. 'Oh, <b>do</b> <b>you</b> <b>think</b> <b>he</b> won't? <b>Do</b> <b>you</b> <b>think</b> Lillyvick {{will always remember}} it--always, always, always?' ...|$|R
60|$|Buster Bear {{was having}} the finest time he had had since he {{came down from the}} Great Woods to live in the Green Forest. To be sure, he wasn't in the Green Forest now, but he wasn't far from it. He was in the Old Pasture, one edge of which touches one edge of the Green Forest. And where <b>do</b> <b>you</b> <b>think</b> <b>he</b> <b>was,</b> in the Old Pasture? Why, {{right in the middle of}} the biggest patch of the biggest {{blueberries}} he ever had seen in all his life! Now if there is any one thing that Buster Bear had rather have above another, it is all the berries he can eat, unless it be honey. Nothing can quite equal honey in Buster's mind. But next to honey give him berries. He isn't particular what kind of berries. Raspberries, blackberries, or blueberries, either kind, will make him perfectly happy.|$|E
6000|$|There was one {{wonderful}} little fellow, too, who peeped {{out of the}} top of a {{house built}} of round bricks. He had two big wheels, and one little one, all over teeth, spinning round and round like the wheels in a thrashing-machine; and Tom stood and stared at him, to see {{what he was going to}} make with his machinery. And what <b>do</b> <b>you</b> <b>think</b> <b>he</b> <b>was</b> doing? Brick-making. With his two big wheels he swept together all the mud which floated in the water: all that was nice in it he put into his stomach and ate; and all the mud he put into the little wheel on his breast, which really was a round hole set with teeth; and there he spun it into a neat hard round brick; and then he took it and stuck it on the top of his house- wall, and set to work to make another. Now was not he a clever little fellow? ...|$|E
60|$|That {{is how he}} {{happened}} to hear a little cry, a very faint little cry. If he had been whistling, he wouldn't have heard it at all. He stopped to listen. He never had heard a cry just like it before. At first he couldn't make out just what it was or where it came from. But one thing he was sure of, {{and that was that}} it was a cry of fright. He stood perfectly still and listened with all his might. There it was again--"Help! Help! Help"--and it was very faint and sounded terribly frightened. He waited a minute or two, but heard nothing more. Then he put down his pail and began a hurried look here, there, and everywhere. He was sure that it had come from somewhere on the ground, so he peered behind bushes and peeped behind logs and stones, and then just as he had about given up hope of finding where it came from, he went around a little turn in the old cow-path, and there {{right in front of him}} was little Mr. Gartersnake, and what <b>do</b> <b>you</b> <b>think</b> <b>he</b> <b>was</b> doing? Well, I don't like to tell you, but he was trying to swallow one of the children of Stickytoes the Tree Toad. Of course Farmer Brown's Boy didn't let him. He made little Mr. Gartersnake set Master Stickytoes free and held Mr. Gartersnake until Master Stickytoes was safely out of reach.|$|E
6000|$|... "About Sir Francis Clavering's paper, sir? <b>Do</b> <b>you</b> <b>think</b> <b>he's</b> {{any longer}} any good, sir? Will my Lady pay on 'em, any more, sir?" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Yes--but <b>do</b> <b>you</b> know him? That is--why <b>do</b> <b>you</b> <b>think</b> <b>he</b> has the power? Or {{what reason}} have you for believing he will {{remember}} his word?" ...|$|R
6000|$|The next morning, {{when the}} King awoke, what <b>do</b> <b>you</b> <b>think</b> <b>he</b> saw? The wall stood there before his eyes, {{exactly as he}} had bespoken it! ...|$|R
6000|$|... 'Thank you, Mrs. King; I will {{certainly}} try {{to speak to}} him. You said nothing of Alfred; <b>do</b> <b>you</b> <b>think</b> <b>he</b> will not be well enough?' ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Here's {{the letter}} from dad, and what <b>do</b> <b>you</b> <b>think?</b> <b>He</b> sent me a check for ten dollars more than I asked for! Isn't that fine?" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I am bothered about Engleton," [...] Forrest said. [...] "I didn't {{like his}} insisting upon cutting last night. What <b>do</b> <b>you</b> <b>think</b> <b>he</b> meant by it?" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Ah! true; who the deuce {{can this}} Colonel be then, for young Jarvis {{is only a}} captain, I know; who <b>do</b> <b>you</b> <b>think</b> <b>he</b> is, Jane?" ...|$|R
6000|$|... 'Oh yes! And where <b>do</b> <b>you</b> <b>think</b> <b>he</b> is? At Darminster--editing a paper there. It {{is called}} the Darminster Politician. He said he sent a copy here.' ...|$|R
6000|$|... "And {{what about}} Baxter, father? If he has those papers, <b>do</b> <b>you</b> <b>think</b> <b>he</b> or his confederate {{will go up}} the Larkspur to locate the Eclipse Mine?" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Oh, Dick, Dick! <b>do</b> <b>you</b> <b>think</b> <b>he</b> really <b>did</b> it? The {{horror of}} it, Dick! to be kissed by a--a--man {{who has been}} dead a hundred years!" ...|$|R
6000|$|They {{will come}} back--come back again, {{as long as}} the red Earth rolls. He never wasted a leaf or a tree. <b>Do</b> <b>you</b> <b>think</b> <b>He</b> would squander souls? ...|$|R
6000|$|He {{says not}} a word, but passes, [...] Staring {{at what he}} sees. What ghost of us both <b>do</b> <b>you</b> <b>think</b> <b>he</b> saw [...] Under the olive trees? ...|$|R
6000|$|Guy thanked Sir Eustace {{for having}} so spoken {{of him to}} the English king, and asked: [...] "What <b>do</b> <b>you</b> <b>think</b> <b>he</b> meant by those last words, my lord?" ...|$|R
6000|$|... 'He is gone to Allonby,' said Philip, 'to {{announce}} it; saying, he must persuade {{his father}} to put off their going to Brighton. <b>Do</b> <b>you</b> <b>think</b> <b>he</b> will succeed?' ...|$|R
6000|$|... "But <b>do</b> <b>you</b> <b>think</b> <b>he</b> {{gets better}} on the whole, Master Edmund? Do the doctors say there is much {{likelihood}} of his being well again, and coming among us?" ...|$|R
