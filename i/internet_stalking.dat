40|$|The {{focus of}} this article will be on {{existing}} preventative measures that aim to restrict unacceptable activities of sexual offenders on the Internet. An Information Technology theory, namely the gratification approach of Blumler and Katz will be employed explaining why some paedophiles will make use of the <b>Internet</b> to <b>stalk</b> potential child victims. Since many parents and caregivers are unaware of existing aids to help them to prevent sexual predators to communicate with children via the Internet, an exposition of existing filtering and blocking software is highlighted in this contribution. An overview of current legislation pertaining to Internet paedophilia as well as an outline of the importance of parental awareness with regards to this phenomenon will be put forward. Before engaging into the above mentioned aspects, the concepts that are central to this article are defined...|$|R
40|$|This article {{contributes}} to {{a growing body of}} research investigating the phenomenon of cyberstalking. Participants consisted of 100 students from a state university and 656 students from a large private university. Data were gathered from students about responses to a cyberstalking scenario and their use and experiences with the Internet. Furthermore, an analysis and comparison of students who reported having been stalked to those who had been cyberstalked was completed. An unexpected finding was that male students were statistically more likely than female students to have been cyberstalked, and Caucasian males had the highest correlation. The conclusion indicates that for those individuals who were cyberstalked, the stalking perpetrator was most likely to be a former intimate partner. Recommendations for mental health professionals are provided.

40|$|Although {{it seems}} to be a global phenomenon, the {{internet}} is a part of human society for relatively short time. Existing in different forms there are phenomena that are present in human society for decades, and that we might not expect in cyberspace. In addition to a mutation of social pathologies such as bullying, child pornography and <b>stalking,</b> <b>internet</b> is used by extremist movements and terrorist groups for their activities such as propaganda, mutual communication, but also for invasive activities. This thesis is focused among other things on terrorism in cyberspace. The introduction places the issue in the current state of society, connecting it with technological and social changes. The second section presents a brief overview of the relevant literature, which is focused on the issue of conventional terrorism and terrorism in cyberspace. The following chapters attempt to define its form, find its essence, and describe the similarities and differences especially in relation to conventional terrorism. These findings are achieved by confrontating both forms of terrorism, its fundamental aspects and classification criteria. This work provides an unusual insight into the relationship of technology and society, which despite its relative youth requires more and more attention. It shows that [...] ...|$|R

40|$|Victims of {{stalking}} suffer dreadfully, and {{the nature}} of the response to their plight varies across jurisdictions. To add to traditional forms of stalking, there have been experience of email stalking, <b>Internet</b> <b>stalking</b> and computer stalking. The Australian Institute of Criminology has been a pioneer in the analysis of cyber crime, and this paper adds to that body of knowledge. This paper examines cyberstalking as an example of a crime that is simultaneously both amenable to, and resistant of, traditional forms of legislation, depending upon the way in which the possibilities of the Internet are exploited. Cyberstalking is analogous to traditional forms of stalking, in that it incorporates persistent behaviours that instil apprehension and fear. However, with the advent of new technologies, traditional stalking has taken on entirely new forms through mediums such as email and the Internet. Cyberstalking dramatically signals the potential of the Internet to facilitate some types of crimes, as well as pointing to the interventions available and likely to prove effective. To date, there is no empirical research to determine the incidence of cyberstalking. Arguments as to whether Internet-based technologies have created entirely new types of crime requiring equally new legislative and other responses, or provided new expressions of traditional crimes requiring the adaptation of current legislative strategies, are hotly debated by the proponents of both views...|$|E
40|$|Victimization {{through the}} Internet is {{becoming}} more prevalent as cyber criminals have developed more effective ways to remain anonymous. And as more personal information than ever is stored on networked computers, even the occasional or non-user is at risk. A collection of contributions from worldwide experts and emerging researchers, Cyber Criminology: Exploring Internet Crimes and Criminal Behavior explores today’s interface of computer science, Internet science, and criminology. Topics discussed include: •	 The growing menace of cyber crime in Nigeria •	 Internet gambling and digital piracy •	 Sexual addiction on the Internet, child pornography, and online exploitation of children •	 Terrorist use of the <b>Internet</b> •	 Cyber <b>stalking</b> and cyber bullying •	 The victimization of women on social networking websites •	 Malware victimization and hacking •	 The Islamic world in cyberspace and the propagation of Islamic ideology via the Internet •	 Human rights concerns that the digital age has created Approaching the topic from a social science perspective, the book explores methods for determining the causes of computer crime victimization by examining an individual’s lifestyle patterns. It also publishes {{the findings of a}} study conducted on college students about online victimization. Advances in information and communications technologies have created a range of new crime problems that did not exist two decades ago. Opportunities for various criminal activities to pervade the Internet have led to the growth and development of cyber criminology as a distinct discipline within the criminology framework. This volume explores all aspects of this nascent field and provides a window on the future of Internet crimes and theories behind their origins.
