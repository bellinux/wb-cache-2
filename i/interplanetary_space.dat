Outer space is used to distinguish it from airspace (and terrestrial locations). There is no discrete boundary between the Earth's atmosphere and space, as the atmosphere gradually attenuates with increasing altitude.

30|$|Physics {{of dusty}} plasma studies the {{properties}} of charged dust {{in the presence of}} electrons and ions [31]. These media have been observed in lower and upper mesosphere, planetary magnetosphere, cometary tails, planetary rings, <b>interplanetary</b> <b>spaces,</b> interstellar media, etc. [17, 18, 26, 39]. The importance of studying such task appears also in the laboratory and plasmas technology such as low temperature physics (radio frequency), plasma discharge [5], and fabrication of modern materials such as semi conductors, optical fibres, nanostructural materials, and dusty crystals [6, 45].|$|R
40|$|Abstract: Kepler’s laws of {{planetary}} motion and the Titus-Bode formula are results of observational {{data on the}} solar system. The latter points towards a definite geometry that governs the location of orbits of the planets and the former shows a definite geometric conservation law at work. Observational data [1] once again reveals {{the presence of a}} phenomenological but definite working of the solar system that fixes the locations {{of planetary}} orbits in pairs across the asteroid belt. Keywords: numerical-solar system geometry, planetary systems, Titus-Bode formula, Kepler’s laws, <b>interplanetary</b> <b>spacing.</b> <b>Interplanetary</b> <b>spacing</b> or planetary distribution in the solar system has provoked much speculation but a perfect theory or model has been elusive. Kepler’s laws [2] make it quite certain that planetary orbits follow a geometric conservation law because the square of the time period for the revolution of the planets is equal to the cube of their respective distances from the sun while the Titus-Bode formula [3] quite certainly predicts the mean distance of every planet’s orbit including the asteroids but is unfortunately wrong by 29 % for Neptune and 95 % for Pluto. The good part is that the Titus-Bode formula is extremely simple and determines the distances of planetary orbits by assigning a fixed whole number n to each planet in this formula...|$|R
2500|$|The Catholic writer Léon Bloy {{praised the}} novel, {{describing}} Huysmans as [...] "formerly a Naturalist, but now an Idealist capable {{of the most}} exalted mysticism, and as {{far removed from the}} crapulous [...] Zola as if all the <b>interplanetary</b> <b>spaces</b> had suddenly accumulated between them." [...] In his review, Barbey d'Aurevilly compared Huysmans to Baudelaire, recalling: [...] "After Les Fleurs du mal I told Baudelaire it only remains for you to choose between the muzzle of the pistol and the foot of the Cross. But will the author of À rebours make the same choice?" [...] His prediction eventually proved true when Huysmans converted to Catholicism in the 1890s.|$|R
5|$|<b>Interplanetary</b> <b>space</b> {{contains}} {{the magnetic field}} generated by the Sun. There are also magnetospheres generated by planets such as Jupiter, Saturn, Mercury and the Earth that have their own magnetic fields. These are shaped by {{the influence of the}} solar wind into the approximation of a teardrop shape, with the long tail extending outward behind the planet. These magnetic fields can trap particles from the solar wind and other sources, creating belts of magnetic particles such as the Van Allen radiation belt. Planets without magnetic fields, such as Mars, have their atmospheres gradually eroded by the solar wind.|$|E

5|$|The {{volume of}} <b>interplanetary</b> <b>space</b> is a nearly total vacuum, {{with a mean}} free path of about one astronomical unit at the orbital {{distance}} of the Earth. However, this space is not completely empty, and is sparsely filled with cosmic rays, which include ionized atomic nuclei and various subatomic particles. There is also gas, plasma and dust, small meteors, and several dozen types of organic molecules discovered to date by microwave spectroscopy. A cloud of interplanetary dust is visible at night as a faint band called the zodiacal light.|$|E

5|$|Within our Solar System, <b>interplanetary</b> <b>space</b> {{is filled}} with the plasma {{expelled}} via the solar wind, extending from the Sun's surface out to the heliopause. Furthermore, all the distant stars, and much of interstellar space or intergalactic space is also likely filled with plasma, albeit at very low densities. Astrophysical plasmas are also observed in Accretion disks around stars or compact objects like white dwarfs, neutron stars, or black holes in close binary star systems. Plasma is associated with ejection of material in astrophysical jets, which have been observed with accreting black holes or in active galaxies like M87's jet that possibly extends out to 5,000 light-years.|$|E
5|$|Io plays a {{significant}} role in shaping Jupiter's magnetic field, acting as an electric generator that can develop 400,000 volts across itself and create an electric current of 3 million amperes, releasing ions that give Jupiter a magnetic field inflated to more than twice the size it would otherwise have. The magnetosphere of Jupiter sweeps up gases and dust from Io's thin atmosphere at a rate of 1tonne per second. This material is mostly composed of ionized and atomic sulfur, oxygen and chlorine; atomic sodium and potassium; molecular sulfur dioxide and sulfur; and sodium chloride dust. These materials originate from Io's volcanic activity, but the material that escapes to Jupiter's magnetic field and into <b>interplanetary</b> <b>space</b> comes directly from Io's atmosphere. These materials, depending on their ionized state and composition, end up in various neutral (non-ionized) clouds and radiation belts in Jupiter's magnetosphere and, in some cases, are eventually ejected from the Jovian system.|$|E

25|$|The Sun's major {{component}} of magnetic field reverses direction every 11 years (so the period is about 22 years), resulting in a diminished magnitude of magnetic field near reversal time. During this dormancy, the sunspots activity is at maximum (because {{of the lack of}} magnetic braking on plasma) and, as a result, massive ejection of high energy plasma into the solar corona and <b>interplanetary</b> <b>space</b> takes place. Collisions of neighboring sunspots with oppositely directed magnetic fields result in the generation of strong electric fields near rapidly disappearing magnetic field regions. This electric field accelerates electrons and protons to high energies (kiloelectronvolts) which results in jets of extremely hot plasma leaving the Sun's surface and heating coronal plasma to high temperatures (millions of kelvin).|$|E

40|$|We {{compute the}} {{strengths}} of zero-th order (in eccentricity) three-body resonances for a co-planar and low eccentricity multiple planet system. In a numerical integration we illustrate that slowly moving Laplace angles are matched by variations in semi-major axes among three bodies with the outer two bodies moving {{in the same direction}} and the inner one moving in the opposite direction, as would be expected from the two quantities that are conserved in the three-body resonance. A resonance overlap criterion is derived for the closely and equally spaced, equal mass system with three-body resonances overlapping when interplanetary separation is less than an order unity factor times the planet mass to the one quarter power. We find that three-body resonances are sufficiently dense to account for wander in semi-major axis seen in numerical integrations of closely spaced systems and they are likely the cause of instability of these systems. For interplanetary separations outside the overlap region, stability timescales significantly increase. Crudely estimated diffusion coefficients in eccentricity and semi-major axis depend on a high power of planet mass and <b>interplanetary</b> <b>spacing.</b> An exponential dependence previously fit to stability or crossing timescales is likely due to the limited range of parameters and times possible in integration and the strong power law dependence of the diffusion rates on these quantities.

25|$|Both GCRs and SPEs are {{of concern}} for CNS risks. The major GCRs are {{composed}} of protons, α-particles, and particles of HZE nuclei with a broad energy spectra ranging from a few tens to above 10,000 MeV/u. In <b>interplanetary</b> <b>space,</b> GCR organ dose and dose-equivalent of more than 0.2 Gy or 0.6 Sv per year, respectively, are expected. The high energies of GCRs allow them to penetrate to hundreds of centimeters of any material, thus precluding radiation shielding as a plausible mitigation measure to GCR risks on the CNS. For SPEs, the possibility exists for an absorbed dose of over 1 Gy from an SPE if crew members are in a thinly shielded spacecraft or performing a spacewalk. The energies of SPEs, although substantial (tens to hundreds of MeV), do not preclude radiation shielding as a potential countermeasure. However, the costs of shielding may be high {{to protect against the}} largest events.|$|E
