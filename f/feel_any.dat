5|$|According to {{consolidated}} {{figures the}} episode was watched by 3.28 million viewers on its BBC two debut, aggregated to 4.74 million viewers after {{taking into consideration}} two repeat broadcasts the same week. Reviews of the episode ranged from mostly negative to very positive. Most commentators praised the larger role of Rhys in the episode, the performance of actor Kai Owen and the realism of the acting and dialogue overall. However, {{a large proportion of}} reviewers criticised the special effects used to create the alien and it was subsequently compared by some to resembling a sock puppet or hand puppet. Whilst some reviewers identified with the plight of the alien, others felt that its poor realisation meant that it was hard to <b>feel</b> <b>any</b> sympathy for it.|$|E

25|$|On no ideological, theoretic or {{political}} ground, then, can I recognize, or do I <b>feel,</b> <b>any</b> bond or {{allegiance to the}} Workers Party (or to any other Marxist party). That is simply the case, and I can no longer pretend about it, either to myself or to others.|$|E
30|$|The user cannot shape a {{positive}} perception of usefulness until {{he or she}} <b>feels</b> <b>any</b> practical worth of BDA in healthcare organizations. According to the theoretical principle of the TAM model, the study hypothesized that PU had {{a positive}} relationship with BIs.|$|R
5000|$|Though {{he never}} <b>feels</b> <b>any</b> guilt {{for his first}} act as a vigilante, he still felt {{transformed}} by it, {{to the point where}} he decided that he had no place in his old world.

50|$|Through it all, {{the only}} person Harold <b>feels</b> <b>any</b> love for is his mother; he {{develops}} an Oedipal complex and an inability to sexually relate to anyone without resorting to his alter-ego, Madden. In the guise of this other self, he rapes a local girl, Iris, with whom he later falls in love.|$|R
25|$|As a consequence, any {{perception}} of the exterior reality becomes nondual. It becomes possible to live submerged in a continuous state of union with Shiva even while performing regular day-to-day activities. This form of extroverted, all inclusive samādhi is the pinnacle of spiritual evolution, bhairavi mudra, jagadananda or bhava samadhi. The yogi experiences everything as pure light and ecstasy (cit-ananda) and does not <b>feel</b> <b>any</b> difference between interior and exterior any more.|$|E
25|$|One {{practical}} {{result of}} this among Open Brethren is that, should a member be disciplined in one assembly, other Open assemblies aware of that disciplining would not automatically <b>feel</b> <b>any</b> binding obligation to deny that person participation in their breaking of bread service, {{as long as their}} leadership does not consider whatever caused the disciplinary action a serious issue. A numerically small movement known as the Needed Truth Brethren emerged from the Open Brethren around 1892, partly in an attempt {{to address the problem of}} making discipline more effective.|$|E
25|$|Todd's {{spiritual journey}} was crafted {{as a man}} who wanted {{forgiveness}} for his past misdeeds. In the story, he reasons that he does not deserve forgiveness; this contributes to him embracing his worst qualities. Malone was intrigued by telling this type of character aspect, and felt that it worked better due to Howarth being an actor who would not let Todd acquire redemption easily. Malone felt {{the most important part of}} Todd's redemption was to have him re-confront Marty in order to better deal with the fact that he initiated a gang rape on her. Despite the character's eagerness to be thought of as a decent human being, the writers felt that these good deeds should never make Todd <b>feel</b> <b>any</b> less horrible for having raped Marty.|$|E

25|$|The blade may {{not have}} {{imperfections}} in it. All blades are assumed by Jewish law to be imperfect, so the knife must be checked before each session. In the past the knife was checked {{through a variety of}} means. Today the common practice is for the shochet to run his fingernail up and down both sides of the blade and on the cutting edge to determine if he can <b>feel</b> <b>any</b> imperfections. He then uses a number of increasingly fine abrasive stones to sharpen and polish the blade until it is perfectly sharp and smooth. After the slaughter, the shochet must check the knife again in the same way to be certain the first inspection was properly done, and to ensure the blade was not damaged during shechita. If the blade is found to be damaged, the meat may not be eaten by Jews. If the blade falls or is lost before the second check is done, the first inspection is relied on and the meat is permitted.|$|E
25|$|Dīkṣā (Sanskrit: दीक्षा). Reṇukā {{does not}} <b>feel</b> <b>any</b> weight, nor is {{troubled by the}} pregnancy. Jamadagni {{performs}} the Puṃsavana ceremony of Reṇukā, traditionally performed in the eighth month of pregnancy. All good omens happen for Reṇukā. The seven seers (Saptarṣi) bless her and the nine planets become favourable. Reṇukā gives birth to a child {{on the third day}} of the bright half of Vaiśākha month, known as Akṣayatṛtīyā. The deities, seers, and devotees rejoice. On the instruction of Bhṛgu, the child is named as Rāma by Jamadagni. Rāma is very fond of a toy-axe, and so he is also called Paraśurāma. The child tames and plays with wild animals like lions and tigers. Five years pass by, and ten Saṃskāras ("rites of passage") of the child are completed. Then the Upanayana ("sacred thread ceremony") ceremony of Paraśurāma is performed. Brahmā is the giver of the sacred thread, Śiva initiates the child in the Gayatrī Mantra, and Paraśurāma begs Reṇukā for alms. The canto ends with Paraśurāma going to the Kailāsa mountain to learn from his guru Śiva.|$|E
25|$|In {{response}} to these results, an uncontrolled clinical trial was carried out at the Petrov Research Institute of Oncology in St. Petersburg {{over a period of}} 17 years, and a controlled trial was carried out at the Harbor-UCLA Medical Center in California over period of 10 years, respectively. The Russian trial reported complete tumor regression in about 1% of cases, a partial response in about 3% of cases and some subjective improvement of symptoms in about half of the patients. The National Cancer Institute analysis of this trial notes that interpretation of these data is difficult, due to the absence of controls, the lack of information on prior treatment and the study's reliance on subjective assessments of symptoms (i.e. asking patients if the drug had made them <b>feel</b> <b>any</b> better). Overall, the trials in California saw no statistically significant effect on survival from hydrazine sulfate treatment, but noted increased calorie intake in treated patients versus controls. The authors also performed a post-hoc analysis on one or more subgroups of these patients, which they reported as suggesting a beneficial effect from treatment. The design and interpretation of this trial, and in particular the validity of this subgroup analysis, was criticized in detail in an editorial in the Journal of Clinical Oncology.|$|E
2500|$|In May, she competed at the U.S. Classic in Chicago {{and won the}} {{all-around}} with a {{score of}} 60.350. National Team Coordinator Márta Károlyi said: [...] "I was very impressed by Raisman’s general manner of how she handled this competition. You could not tell that she <b>feels</b> <b>any</b> pressure, and we really, really need that. At the Olympics…we need the girls to believe that they're ready, and then they are successful, so that was very good." ...|$|R
6000|$|Mildred hesitated about replying; but {{a generous}} feeling {{got the better}} of her diffidence. [...] "I have never seen any thing in the conduct of Mr. Wycherly Wychecombe to induce me to think that he <b>feels</b> <b>any</b> such weakness," [...] she said, earnestly. [...] "He seems rather to take pride in, than to feel ashamed of, his being a colonial; and you know, we, in England, hardly look on the people of the colonies as our equals." ...|$|R

"If {{the object}} of this delay (to which I was obliged to submit) is to offer a chance of escape to Mr. Percy, the same chance {{necessarily}} includes Mr. Bowmore, whose name {{is also in the}} warrant. Trust me to keep a watchful eye on both these gentlemen; especially on Mr. Bowmore. He is the most dangerous man of the two, and the most likely, if he <b>feels</b> <b>any</b> suspicions, to slip through the fingers of the law.|$|R

She detailed her diagnosis, surgeries, and personal experiences, and described her decision to undergo preventive surgery as a proactive measure for the sake of her six children. Jolie further wrote, [...] "On a personal note, I do not <b>feel</b> <b>any</b> less of a woman. I feel empowered that I made a strong choice that in no way diminishes my femininity." ...|$|E
500|$|After {{seeing the}} first three episodes, Maxwell Zachs called the series [...] "a disappointment". One reason for this, he says, is that {{although}} [...] "we see... lovely, endearing transsexuals" [...] portrayed in the show, [...] "what I don’t see is anything {{that is going to}} make people think or <b>feel</b> <b>any</b> differently about what gender is or how it limits us all in one way or another." [...] He lamented that their expressions of nuance in gender identity and discussions of genderqueerness were absent from the broadcast edit of the show.|$|E
60|$|They murmured languid concurrence, for, as he said, clothes must {{be washed}} and mended now and then, {{and the man}} who has just {{finished}} a long day's arduous toil seldom <b>feels</b> <b>any</b> great inclination for the task.

500|$|As a child, Laurer {{learned to}} play both the violin and cello. She later said that in seventh grade she was sexually kissed by a much older teacher who worked at her school. [...] At age thirteen, while {{attending}} Penfield High School, she began purging after she ate. She left home at age sixteen after her mother tried to force her into a drug rehabilitation facility, going instead {{to live with her}} biological father. That same year, she began working out, and because her abdominal muscles were so strong, she did not <b>feel</b> <b>any</b> pain when she developed an ovarian tumor. She finished her last year of high school in Spain.|$|E
500|$|Luxating patella {{is another}} health {{issue in the}} Pomeranian breed. It occurs when, through either {{malformation}} or trauma, the ridges forming the patellar groove in the knee are not prominent and are too shallow to allow the patella to properly sit securely. This can cause the patella to [...] "luxate" [...] (jump out of the groove) sideways which will cause the leg to lock up with the foot off the ground. While the muscles are contracted the patella cannot return to the correct position. The initial pain {{is caused by the}} knee cap sliding across the ridges of the femur. Once out of position, the dog does not <b>feel</b> <b>any</b> pain caused by the slipped disc.|$|E
500|$|IGN's Matt Risely rated [...] "The Almost People" [...] 8 out of 10, {{noting that}} [...] "As a {{traditional}} two-parter, Matthew Graham wrote a tight and coherent {{but not entirely}} scintillating script that managed to 'flesh' out the themes of morality and humanity {{with a couple of}} interesting touches". Though he called the cliffhanger a [...] "perfectly pitched WTF moment", he too believed that it [...] "detracts from the episode as a whole". Richard Edwards of SFX was more critical of the episode, giving it three out of five stars. He stated he did not <b>feel</b> <b>any</b> [...] "genuine threat" [...] and considered the Gangers to be [...] "uninteresting" [...] and [...] "predictable". However, he did praise Smith's performance and the cliffhanger. Digital Spy listed the cliffhanger among five best of Doctor Who since its revival in 2005, explaining, [...] "it changes everything you thought you knew about the latest series, and it's damn creepy".|$|E
25|$|While {{it works}} in {{preventing}} speech, {{a person who has}} been stuff gagged can easily spit it out by pushing it with his/her tongue. However, {{it is for this reason}} that the stuff gag is one of the safest gags to use during self bondage, as the person with his/her hands tied can still spit the gag out if he/she <b>feels</b> <b>any</b> kind of discomfort. However, the risks of asphyxiation and choking are still present for someone who is not careful.|$|R
50|$|After Ma recovers, she and Jack {{move into}} an {{independent}} living residence, where they begin making {{plans for the}} future. Ma's growing independence conflicts with Jack's desire to keep her for himself, just {{as they used to}} be. At the same time, Jack himself is growing and changing as his world expands. Finally, Jack requests to visit Room. He and Ma return to the scene of their captivity, but Jack no longer <b>feels</b> <b>any</b> emotional attachment toward it and is able to say his goodbyes before he and Ma leave Room for the final time.|$|R
50|$|The town then {{witnesses}} several dark omens, {{including the}} disappearance of the Sudarshana Chakra, the Panchajanya (Krishna's conch), Krishna's chariot and the plough weapon of Balarama. Pests multiply. Sinful acts multiply, yet no one <b>feels</b> <b>any</b> shame. Wives deceive their husbands, and husbands deceive their wives. Everyone has the same terrifying dreams. People insult and humiliate their seniors and teachers. Krishna gets concerned, asks everyone to go on a pilgrimage to the sacred waters of the Prabhas sea. They do. When they arrive, the Yadavas revel in merry making, dance and drink lots of alcohol.|$|R
500|$|After Jade {{challenged}} Mark {{to a game}} of pool, [...] "sparks of {{a different}} kind" [...] began to fly between them. McGregor explained the situation: [...] "Mark has had a really bad day at work, so he's out for a fun night. To his surprise, he enjoys Jade's company. Lucas goes home early - and Mark and Jade end up sharing a kiss." [...] The next morning it was made clear that Mark and Jade {{had spent the night}} together and Mark was full of regret. Mark was [...] "terrified" [...] that Kate would find out and even though Jade agreed to keep quiet, he does not <b>feel</b> <b>any</b> less guilty. Mark's problems at work continued and he became a victim of harassment when his car tyres were let down. Despite talking to his superior officer, nothing happens and Mark felt like he had no support from the people at his work place.|$|E
500|$|Residente o Visitante was {{recorded}} in various countries, as the band was on tour during {{the making of the}} album. [...] Residente explained that the group did not <b>feel</b> <b>any</b> pressure to compete with the success of Calle 13, and felt that the recording of Residente o Visitante was a smoother process than the first: [...] "The main difference for us this time around was that we had more opportunities, more tools and more money. We were also on tour at the same time, unlike the first. I spent my time writing during the travels, while my brother would write the music." [...] Residente was invited by La Mala Rodriguez to come to Spain to collaborate on a song. [...] He agreed, as he greatly admired La Mala's work, and the two met for drinks where they discussed the kind of song they wanted to create before going to the studio to record what would later become [...] "Mala Suerta Con el 13".|$|E
500|$|Will and Terri (Jessalyn Gilsig) {{finalize}} their divorce. Attempting to {{deal with}} his sorrow and cheerleading coach Sue Sylvester's (Jane Lynch) incessant bullying, Will seduces Sue with a performance of [...] "Tell Me Something Good" [...] and asks her out on a date, standing her up to humiliate her. Sue withdraws the cheerleading squad from the upcoming Nationals competition and becomes bed-bound. Will sees the negative impact on the cheerleaders and realizes that some of them might lose their college scholarships. Will knows that hurting his nemesis did not make him <b>feel</b> <b>any</b> better, and encourages her to be there for her girls. Sue reenters and wins Nationals, but later gives Will two options: either house her new trophy inside New Directions' choir room, or kiss her. As Will is about to kiss her, Sue backs out and decides she prefers that the trophy be set up in the choir room as a reminder of her superiority.|$|E
