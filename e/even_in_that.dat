5|$|The prince {{began to}} be {{perceived}} as a unifier towards the middle of the 19th century. Such an interpretation is completely lacking in the historiography of the 17th-century chroniclers, and <b>even</b> <b>in</b> <b>that</b> of the Transylvanian School around 1800. What they emphasized, apart from the exceptional personality of Michael himself, were the idea of Christendom and his close relations with Emperor Rudolf. The conqueror's ambition is likewise frequently cited as a motivation for his action, occupying in the interpretative schema the place that was later to be occupied by the Romanian idea.|$|E
25|$|It is the {{standards}} of civilized men not of beasts that must be kept in mind, for it is good men not beasts {{who are capable of}} real courage. Those like the Spartans who concentrate on the one and ignore the other in their education turn men into machines and in devoting themselves to one single aspect of city's life, end up making them inferior <b>even</b> <b>in</b> <b>that.</b>|$|E
25|$|In 1931, though already forty-eight - an age {{at which}} most cricketers <b>even</b> <b>in</b> <b>that</b> era had already retired - Charlie Parker equalled Jack Hearne's record of taking 100 wickets by 12 June and his total {{aggregate}} was the second highest of his career. However, age {{finally caught up with}} Parker in 1932 after a promising beginning. Though he still spun the ball considerably, he lost his accuracy of length and consequently was expensive. Because Gloucestershire had no support for him and Goddard, Parker continued to play until 1935, but never recovered his former powers.|$|E

25|$|In {{addition}} to the compound forms for completed past actions, Portuguese also retains a synthetic pluperfect: so, ele tinha falado and ele havia falado ("he had spoken") can also be expressed as ele falara. However, the simple (one-word) pluperfect is losing ground to the compound forms. While pluperfect forms like falara are generally understood, their use is limited mostly to some regions of Portugal and to written language. In Brazilian Portuguese they are used nearly exclusively in the printed language, though <b>even</b> <b>in</b> <b>that</b> environment the -ra synthetic pluperfect has been losing ground to the compound form using tinha in the last decades.|$|E
25|$|Mercury {{might have}} helped on the musical {{arrangements}} {{based on the fact}} that (as it has been recalled by former bassists and the band themselves) they were in a more collaborative period in the pre-studio days and he was usually the one getting his way with structural ideas. While it is highly possible that he contributed ideas to the song (the modulation types and the expanded form are closer to his style than to May's), the bottom line is that <b>even</b> <b>in</b> <b>that</b> case Mercury would be more a co-arranger than a co-writer per se (like George Martin on The Beatles' songs).|$|E
25|$|In modern times, Idaho {{has been}} a {{reliably}} Republican state in presidential politics as well. It has not supported a Democrat for president since 1964. <b>Even</b> <b>in</b> <b>that</b> election, Lyndon Johnson defeated Barry Goldwater in the state by fewer than two percentage points, compared to a landslide nationally. In 2004, Republican George W. Bush carried Idaho {{by a margin of}} 38 percentage points and with 68.4% of the vote, winning in 43 of 44 counties. Only Blaine County, which contains the Sun Valley ski resort, supported John Kerry, who owns a home in the area. In 2008 Barack Obama's 36.1percent showing was the best for a Democratic presidential candidate in Idaho since 1976. However, Republican margins were narrower in 1992 and 1976.|$|E

25|$|That {{same night}} Menéndez {{returned}} to St. Augustine; {{and when the}} event became known, there were some, <b>even</b> <b>in</b> <b>that</b> isolated garrison, living in constant dread of a descent by the French, who considered him cruel, an opinion which his brother-in-law, Merás, the very man who helped to kill Ribault, {{did not hesitate to}} record. And when the news eventually reached Spain, even there a vague rumor was afloat that there were those who condemned Menéndez for perpetrating the massacre against his given word. Others among the settlers thought that he had acted as a good captain, because, with their small store of provisions, they considered that there would have been an imminent danger of their perishing by hunger had their numbers been increased by the Frenchmen, even had they been Catholics.|$|E
25|$|Being descendents {{of divine}} unions with privileged mortals, mythical heroes are an {{intermediate}} group between gods and men, {{and they are}} sympathetic to human ambitions. Thus, for example, Pindar not only invokes Zeus for help {{on behalf of the}} island of Aegina, but also its national heroes Aeacus, Peleus and Telamon. Unlike the gods, however, heroes can be judged according to ordinary human standards and they are sometimes shown in the poems to demean themselves. <b>Even</b> <b>in</b> <b>that</b> case, they receive special consideration. Thus Pindar refers obliquely to the murder of Phocus by his brothers Peleus and Telamon ("I am shy of speaking of a huge risk, hazarded not in right"), telling the audience that he will not talk of it ("silence is a man's wisest counsel"). The Theban hero Heracles was a favourite subject but in one poem he is depicted as small in order to be compared with a small Theban patron who had won the pankration at the Isthmian Games: a unique example of Pindar's readiness to shape traditional myths to fit the occasion, even if not always flattering to the mythical hero. A hero's status is not diminished by an occasional blemish but rests on a summary view of his heroic exploits.|$|E
500|$|Mick LaSalle, {{writing in}} the San Francisco Chronicle, criticized Burton's {{perceived}} image as a creative artist. [...] "All Sleepy Hollow has going for it is art direction, and <b>even</b> <b>in</b> <b>that</b> it falls back on cliché." [...] Doug Walker linked the film to the Hammer Films style of horror cinematography, considering it an homage to those movies, comparing the usage of dignified British actors, choices in color and movie sets and character relations. Walker gave it the merit of recreating the [...] "very specific genre" [...] of Hammer Films, citing the skill and [...] "clever casting" [...] Burton used to manage this.|$|E

500|$|Critic Greil Marcus argues that, {{given the}} truly {{distinctive}} breadth {{and complexity of}} Morrison's work, {{it is almost impossible}} to cast his work among that of others: [...] "Morrison remains a singer who can be compared to no other in the history of rock & roll, a singer who cannot be pinned down, dismissed, or fitted into anyone's expectations." [...] Or in the words of Jay Cocks: [...] "He extends himself only to express himself. Alone among rock's great figures—and <b>even</b> <b>in</b> <b>that</b> company he is one of the greatest—Morrison is adamantly inward. And unique. Although he freely crosses musical boundaries— R, Celtic melodies, jazz, rave-up rock, hymns, down-and-dirty blues—he can unfailingly be found in the same strange place: on his own wavelength." ...|$|E
500|$|Having fallen foul of the censors {{with some}} of their earlier films, Hammer had an {{informal}} agreement to submit scripts in advance of shooting to the BBFC for comment. When the draft script for The Quatermass Xperiment was submitted, Board Secretary Arthur Watkins replied, [...] "I must warn you at this stage that, while we accept this story in principle for the ‘X’ category, we could not certificate, <b>even</b> <b>in</b> <b>that</b> category, a film treatment in which the horrific element was so exaggerated as to be nauseating and revolting to adult audiences”.

When he joined Chelsea, his decision to remain living in the area had upset Drake. In addition, he bought a newsagent's shop in Hove, so {{not only did he}} have to travel by train from the south coast– as did teammates Stan Willemse and Eric Parsons– he further annoyed the Chelsea management by getting up even earlier each morning to open the shop before coming in to training. His wife Connie, whom he had known since childhood, ran the business in his absence.

500|$|RCA, {{which had}} enjoyed {{a steady stream}} of product from Presley for over a decade, grew anxious as his {{interest}} in spending time in the studio waned. After a December 1973 session that produced 18 songs, enough for almost two albums, he did not enter the studio in 1974. Parker sold RCA on another concert record, Elvis Recorded Live on Stage in Memphis. Recorded on March 20, it included a version of [...] "How Great Thou Art" [...] that would win Presley his third and final competitive Grammy Award. (All three of his competitive Grammy wins—out of 14 total nominations—were for gospel recordings.) Presley returned to the studio in Hollywood in March 1975, but Parker's attempts to arrange another session {{toward the end of the}} year were unsuccessful. In 1976, RCA sent a mobile studio to Graceland that made possible two full-scale recording sessions at Presley's home. <b>Even</b> <b>in</b> <b>that</b> comfortable context, the recording process was now a struggle for him.|$|E
500|$|The Indian Mahayana {{schools were}} {{divided on the}} issue of the {{possibility}} of reflexive awareness (svasaṃvedana). Dharmakīrti accepted the idea of reflexive awareness as expounded by the Yogacara school, comparing it to lamp that illuminates itself while also illuminating other objects. This was strictly rejected by Mādhyamika scholars like Candrakīrti. Since in the philosophy of the Mādhyamika all things and mental events are characterized by emptiness, they argued that consciousness could not be an inherently reflexive ultimate reality since that would mean it was self validating and therefore not characterized by emptiness. These views were ultimately reconciled by the 8th century thinker Śāntarakṣita. In Śāntarakṣita's synthesis he adopts the idealist Yogācāra views of reflexive awareness as a conventional truth into the structure of the two truths doctrine. Thus he states: [...] "By relying on the Mind-Only system, know that external entities do not exist. And by relying on this Middle Way system, know that no self exists at all, <b>even</b> <b>in</b> <b>that</b> [...]" ...|$|E
500|$|By mid-1858 the {{problems}} with the Thames had been building for several years. In his [...] novel Little Dorrit—published as a serial between 1855 and 1857—Charles Dickens wrote that the Thames was [...] "a deadly sewer... in the place of a fine, fresh river". In a letter to a friend, Dickens [...] said: [...] "I can certify that the offensive smells, <b>even</b> <b>in</b> <b>that</b> short whiff, have been of a most head-and-stomach-distending nature", while the social scientist and journalist George Godwin wrote that [...] "in parts the deposit is more than six feet deep" [...] on the Thames foreshore, and that [...] "the whole of this is thickly impregnated with impure matter". In June 1858 the temperatures in the shade in London averaged —rising to [...] in the sun. Combined with an extended spell of dry weather, the level of the Thames dropped and raw effluent from the sewers remained {{on the banks of the}} river. Queen Victoria and Prince Albert attempted to take a pleasure cruise on the Thames, but returned to shore within a few minutes because the smell was so terrible. The press soon began calling the event [...] "The Great Stink"; the leading article in the City Press observed that [...] "Gentility of speech is at an end—it stinks, and whoso once inhales the stink can never forget it and can count himself lucky if he lives to remember it". A writer for The Standard concurred with the opinion. One of its reporters described the river as a [...] "pestiferous and typhus breeding abomination", while a second wrote that [...] "the amount of poisonous gases which is thrown off is proportionate to the increase of the sewage which is passed into the stream".
