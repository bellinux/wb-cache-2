[...] Expanding on this, Rosenberg said that [...] "we start off with [...] incredible source material and Jessica Jones isn’t as {{well known in the}} universe obviously as Daredevil and everyone else, so it really allows for a lot of freedom in there.

2500|$|Developed by Parroty Interactive, the self-professed National Lampoon of the {{interactive}} media industry, Microshaft Winblows 98 became the company's fourth interactive comedy video game, after Pyst, Star Warped, and The X-Fools, which parodied adventure video game Myst, science fiction film series Star Wars, and supernatural television series The X Files, respectively. Ed Bernstein, founder and CEO of Palladium Interactive had long-wanted to create works that emulated the parody found in Mad Magazine, and felt this game {{could be his}} [...] "piece de resistance", further commenting that his company {{would have been able}} to [...] "sell the empty boxes" [...] due to the game cover humour alone. Elizabeth Wasserman of Knight Ridder/Tribune Business News cited various examples of this including the tagline [...] "Who does he want to own today?", a parody of Microsoft's own [...] "Where <b>do</b> <b>you</b> <b>want</b> <b>to</b> <b>go</b> to today?", and the version, listed as [...] "98 or 99 or 00 or 01". The game was written by Tony Camin, Ian Deitchman, J. P. Manoux and Kristin Rusk. In addition to containing a series of minigames for the player to explore, the software also offered enhancements to Windows 95, while additional content was available via the game's official website. Microshaft Winblows 98s animation and programming were outsourced to WayForward Technologies while Chronic Music handled the music and sound effects. The product was also released in the French language.|$|E
