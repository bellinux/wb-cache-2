5|$|Alexis Helmer, a close friend, {{was killed}} during the battle on May 2. McCrae {{performed}} the burial service himself, at which time <b>he</b> <b>noted</b> how poppies quickly grew around the graves {{of those who died}} at Ypres. The next day, he composed the poem while sitting in the back of an ambulance at an Advanced Dressing Station outside Ypres. This location is today known as the John McCrae Memorial Site.|$|E
5|$|British {{ichthyologist}} Charles Tate Regan described Spheroides liosomus in 1909 from specimens {{collected in}} Melbourne, Hobart, Flinders Island and Port Phillip. <b>He</b> <b>noted</b> {{its lack of}} spines compared with specimens of Tetrodon hamiltonii, and hence {{argued that it was}} a distinct and separate species. Australian biologist Gilbert Whitley equated Regan's description with Fréminville's original naming and gave it the combination Spheroides glaber in 1955, and later Gastrophysus glaber in 1964.|$|E
50|$|Lichtenstein {{says that}} he cleaned up Van Gogh's version and jokes {{that it would be}} to Van Gogh's liking, {{although}} <b>he</b> <b>notes</b> that the vast contrast between his cartoonish style and the original is in and of itself humorous. <b>He</b> <b>notes</b> that his work is meticulous, while Van Gogh's was spontaneous. <b>He</b> also <b>notes</b> that his translation is no more debasing to the master than were Pablo Picasso's translations of Diego Velázquez.|$|R

5|$|Captain John Saris {{may have}} brought back {{examples}} of toy spaniels from his voyage to Japan in 1613, a theory proposed by Commodore Matthew C. Perry during his expeditions to Japan {{on behalf of}} the United States in the mid-19th century. <b>He</b> <b>noted</b> that dogs were a common gift and thought that the earlier voyage of Captain Saris introduced a Japanese type of spaniel into England.|$|E
5|$|In 1935, Einstein {{returned}} {{to the question of}} quantum mechanics. He considered how a measurement on one of two entangled particles would affect the other. <b>He</b> <b>noted,</b> along with his collaborators, that by performing different measurements on the distant particle, either of position or momentum, different properties of the entangled partner could be discovered without disturbing it in any way.|$|E
5|$|In May 2010, an Elderly manager {{told the}} {{publication}} TWICE that economic recession had affected {{the business and}} forced layoffs of part-time employees, and that Elderly's being in Michigan worsened the effects. <b>He</b> <b>noted</b> that as the consumer electronics business began to recover, the musical instrument business followed.|$|E

5|$|In {{another example}} of {{evolution}} of culture, Durkheim pointed to fashion, although in this case <b>he</b> <b>noted</b> a more cyclical phenomenon. According to Durkheim, fashion serves to differentiate between lower classes and upper classes, but because lower classes {{want to look like}} the upper classes, they will eventually adapt the upper class fashion, depreciating it, and forcing the upper class to adopt a new fashion.|$|E
5|$|In {{contrast}} to the pessimistic view of the south taken by the Khartoum administration, he was enthusiastic about the wealth and diversity of plants. <b>He</b> <b>noted</b> that the people had adapted to cultivating non-native plants such as cassava, maize, sweet potato and groundnuts. He {{also noted that the}} government was restricting commercial development of sugarcane, tobacco and coffee, which grew wild, and thus preventing economic development.|$|E
5|$|Jaz Rignall of USgamer {{revisited}} Titanfall in late 2015 {{and found}} the game still worthy of its original praise, though <b>he</b> <b>noted</b> that its technical details—namely graphics and framerate—showed some age. He felt that the game's content issues, apart from the light campaign, were resolved by the free additional maps. Overall, Rignall said that Titanfall {{had been replaced by}} newer shooter games.|$|E

5|$|Justice John Paul Stevens wrote a {{concurring opinion}} that {{argued that the}} Indian tribes have a {{stronger}} claim on inherent sovereign powers than do individual states. <b>He</b> <b>noted</b> that the Indian tribes governed themselves since before Columbus arrived, and that most states never governed themselves outside of the United States.|$|E
5|$|Justice Stephen Breyer {{delivered}} {{the opinion of}} the court on April 19, 2004. Breyer believed that the question the Court needed to answer was whether Congress had the authority to relax restrictions that had been imposed on an Indian tribe's inherent sovereignty. <b>He</b> <b>noted</b> that the intent of Congress was clear, not only based on the plain language of the statute, but also from its legislative history.|$|E
5|$|Music {{journalist}} Charles Thomson noted {{a continued}} media bias against Jackson after the Chandler suicide. Thomson {{said he was}} contacted by a British tabloid to supply information about the 1993 allegations, only to have them replace his carefully researched information with the common myths he advised them to avoid and that the same misinformation was in every article he read about the suicide. <b>He</b> <b>noted</b> when Jackson's FBI file was released the following month, the contents were portrayed by the media as giving an impression of guilt even though the file strongly supported his innocence. <b>He</b> <b>noted</b> how Gene Simmons' allegations in 2010 about Jackson molesting children received over a hundred times more coverage than his interview with Jackson's long-time guitarist, Jennifer Batten, who rebutted Simmons' claims.|$|E

5|$|Vaccines {{have been}} made using animals since their {{discovery}} by Edward Jenner in the 18th century. <b>He</b> <b>noted</b> that inoculation with live cowpox afforded protection against the more dangerous smallpox. In the 19th century, Louis Pasteur developed an attenuated (weakened) vaccine for rabies. In the 20th century, vaccines for the viral diseases mumps and polio were developed using animal cells grown in vitro.|$|E
5|$|Although both Malaysia and Singapore {{had agreed}} to respect and accept the ICJ's decision, Malaysian Foreign Minister Rais Yatim later said his country had renewed its search for the letters written by Governor Butterworth to the Sultan and Temenggung of Johor seeking {{permission}} to build Horsburgh Lighthouse on Pedra Branca. <b>He</b> <b>noted</b> that {{the rules of the}} ICJ allowed a case to be reviewed within ten years if new evidence was adduced. In response, Singapore's Law Minister K. Shanmugam said that the city-state would wait to see what new evidence the Malaysian government could come up with.|$|E

5|$|Bates {{put forward}} the {{hypothesis}} that the close resemblance between unrelated species was an antipredator adaptation. <b>He</b> <b>noted</b> that some species showed very striking coloration, and flew in a leisurely manner, almost as if taunting predators to eat them. He reasoned that these butterflies were unpalatable to birds and other insectivores, and were thus avoided by them. He extended this logic to forms that closely resembled such protected species, mimicking their warning coloration but not their toxicity.|$|E
5|$|Biko saw white {{racism in}} South Africa as {{the totality of}} the white power structure. He argued that under apartheid, white people not only participated in the oppression of black people but were also the main voices in {{opposition}} to that oppression. He thus argued that in dominating both the apartheid system and the anti-apartheid movement, white people totally controlled the political arena, leaving black people marginalised. He believed white people were able to dominate the anti-apartheid movement because of their access to resources, education, and privilege. <b>He</b> <b>noted</b> that white South Africans were poorly suited to this role because they had not personally experienced the oppression that their black counterparts faced.|$|E
5|$|Bowman {{argued that}} the {{authorized}} sale of the seeds extinguished the patent, and that Bowman merely used seeds legitimately purchased from the silo. He claimed that the Federal Circuit had created {{an exception to the}} exhaustion doctrine, and that this decision was properly for Congress to decide. Monsanto {{argued that the}} second-generation seeds were not subject to exhaustion because they had not existed until Bowman created them and had not been sold at the time of infringement. <b>He</b> <b>noted</b> that even when exhaustion applied, it did not allow one to create new copies of the patented product, which the second-generation seeds were.|$|E
25|$|Łojek {{notes that}} historiography {{of the fall}} of the Triple Alliance is sparse, as it was overshadowed by the {{interest}} in issues related to the French Revolution; as <b>he</b> <b>notes,</b> a war that never started is much less interesting than the revolution that changed the world. <b>He</b> <b>notes</b> {{that the end of the}} alliance was a triumph of the Russian diplomacy, and failure of the British one, as well as a personal failure of Pitt, who since this defeat removed himself from the British foreign policy. From the Polish perspective, <b>he</b> <b>notes</b> that the failure of the Polish diplomacy to pursue an alliance with the Triple Alliance was another major factor which resulted in its weakening, and by correspondingly strengthening Russia, this Polish inactivity contributed to the fall of Poland. <b>He</b> <b>notes</b> that although some Poles, like Antoni Augustyn Deboli, argued for an alliance with Great Britain, king Stanisław August Poniatowski, who controlled most of Polish diplomacy, refused to stand in opposition to Russia, which in hindsight was a major blow for Poland.|$|R
