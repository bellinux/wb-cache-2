25|$|Sequoyah {{was born}} in the Cherokee town of Tuskegee circa 1770. James Mooney, a {{prominent}} anthropologist and historian of the Cherokee people, quoted a cousin as saying that as a little boy, he spent his early years with his mother. Estimates of his birth year ranged from 1760 to 1776. His name is believed to come from the Cherokee word siqua meaning 'hog'. However, <b>Davis</b> <b>says</b> the name may have been derived from sikwa (either a hog or an opossum) and vi meaning a place or an enclosure. This is a reference either to a childhood deformity or to a later injury that left Sequoyah disabled.|$|E

Jeb Haught of Game Revolution opined, [...] "when I add the micro-transaction advantage to the post apocalyptic mix, the result puts a sour taste in my mouth". Daniel Tack claimed that [...] "the cash shop option in this free-to-play game is completely unobtrusive and unnecessary". In contrast, Justin <b>Davis</b> <b>says</b> that [...] "virtually every other gameplay element must be earned the old-fashioned mobile way – by just waiting around." ...|$|E

500|$|Davis is a Christian. Growing up, {{his parents}} {{took him to}} First Baptist Church in Longview, but Davis {{said it was not}} until after his {{difficult}} 2010 season that he [...] "finally grasped true faith", according to Joshua Cooley. <b>Davis</b> <b>says,</b> [...] "It's not about how hard you’re working to go against the grain. It's just about surrendering every day. Give God the glory no matter what happens.

500|$|Writer Brian Michael Bendis {{has stated}} that he favors {{incorporating}} Miles into the Spider-Man feature films in some way, as did actor Andrew Garfield who played Spider-Man in The Amazing Spider-Man feature film series. Producers Avi Arad and Matt Tolmach have indicated in 2014 {{that they did not}} intend to have Miles or any other character replace Peter Parker in the role. However, after Marvel brokered a deal with Sony, that resulted in the addition of Peter Parker to the films of the Marvel Cinematic Universe (MCU), producer Kevin Feige stated in that while Miles Morales would not be appearing in the MCU for the foreseeable future, he was interested in opportunities to explore the character. In 2017 Feige confirmed that Miles Morales does exist in the MCU, and that [...] alludes to him. In that film, Aaron <b>Davis</b> <b>says</b> [...] "I got a nephew living out here" [...] to Peter Parker. who is revealed in a deleted post-credits scene to be named Miles.|$|E
2500|$|Thor Heyerdahl {{proposed}} in the mid-20th century that the Polynesians had migrated from the northwest coast of Canada by large whale-hunting dugouts, and from South America on balsa-log boats. Many anthropologists have criticised Heyerdahl's theory, including Wade Davis in his book The Wayfinders. <b>Davis</b> <b>says</b> that Heyerdahl [...] "ignored the overwhelming body of linguistic, ethnographic, and ethnobotanical evidence, augmented today by genetic [...] and archaeological data, indicating that he was patently wrong." ...|$|E

5000|$|The {{animation}} {{was carried}} out in Indiana, with <b>Davis</b> <b>saying</b> animators sought to achieve a [...] "swirly, cross-dissolve" [...] effect to portray the ghosts. The animators also sought to give the ghosts a glowing affect. Workman's character was designed to emphasize his advanced age, with one staff artist urging the addition of warts and different-looking eyes. For the musical score, Ed Bogas and Desiree Goyette were employed, having previously worked on Garfield television specials.|$|R

Despite this, the Franks did not break. The well-trained [...] Frank soldiers accomplished what was not thought possible at that time: infantry withstanding a heavy cavalry charge.

2500|$|Davis {{was born}} in Illinois {{and grew up in}} New Jersey and Columbia, Maryland. Her father, Virgil, was an {{aeronautical}} engineer and her mother, Connie, a school teacher. Davis describes herself as an unathletic child; she was a straight-A student and very musical. She grew up playing the piano from the age of three using the Suzuki method. By the time she was 18, she practiced six hours a day; she also played the flute and sang. In the documentary A Perfect Circle, <b>Davis</b> <b>says</b> that she learned [...] "discipline" [...] and [...] "how to project things" [...] from her 15 years of playing the piano. Her own self-description has been mirrored by others. In one Outside profile, for example, her [...] "greatest assets" [...] are described as [...] "sheer will and a brainy, methodical work ethic" [...] rather than [...] "natural athletic talent and flawless technique".|$|E
2500|$|In Britain, America, Portugal and {{in parts}} of Europe, {{opposition}} developed against the slave trade. <b>Davis</b> <b>says</b> that abolitionists assumed [...] "that an end to slave imports would lead automatically to the amelioration and gradual abolition of slavery". In Britain and America, opposition to the trade was led by the Religious Society of Friends (Quakers) and establishment Evangelicals such as William Wilberforce. Many people joined the movement {{and they began to}} protest against the trade, but they were opposed by the owners of the colonial holdings. Following Lord Mansfield's decision in 1772, slaves became free upon entering the British isles. Under the leadership of Thomas Jefferson, the new state of Virginia in 1778 became the first state {{and one of the first}} jurisdictions anywhere to stop the importation of slaves for sale; it made it a crime for traders to bring in slaves from out of state or from overseas for sale; migrants from other states were allowed to bring their own slaves. The new law freed all slaves brought in illegally after its passage and imposed heavy fines on violators. Denmark, which had been active in the slave trade, was the first country to ban the trade through legislation in 1792, which took effect in 1803. Britain banned the slave trade in 1807, imposing stiff fines for any slave found aboard a British ship (see Slave Trade Act 1807). The Royal Navy moved to stop other nations from continuing the slave trade and declared that slaving was equal to piracy and was punishable by death. The United States Congress passed the Slave Trade Act of 1794, which prohibited the building or outfitting of ships in the U.S. for use in the slave trade. In 1807 Congress outlawed the importation of slaves beginning on 1 January 1808, the earliest date permitted by the United States Constitution for such a ban.|$|E

2500|$|In 2006, Christensen {{commented on}} the four {{automated}} depots introduced by <b>Davis,</b> <b>saying</b> [...] "not a single day went by without one, {{if not all of}} them, breaking down... The systems were flawed. They have to stop for four hours every day for maintenance. But because they were constantly breaking down you would be playing catch up. It was a vicious circle." [...] Christensen said a fundamental mistake was to build four such depots at once, rather than building one which could be thoroughly tested before progressing with the others.|$|R

2500|$|Since {{the break}} room was located {{immediately}} behind the main nurse's station in obstetrics, others overheard {{all or part}} of it.

5000|$|During the 1930s, Davis {{participated in}} the {{development}} of electroencephalography and was the first person in the United States to have his brain waves scanned by an EEG device. He focused on the physiology of the inner ear, investigating how neurological impulses are transmitted to the brain via the cochlear nerve. His studies {{led to the development of}} electrical-response audiometry, which allowed diagnosis of hearing difficulties in infants. Robert Galambos credited Davis with coining the word [...] "audiology" [...] in the 1940s, with <b>Davis</b> <b>saying</b> the then-prevalent term [...] "auricular training" [...] sounded like a method of teaching people how to wiggle their ears.|$|R
