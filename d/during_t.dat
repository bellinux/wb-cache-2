25|$|Initially, a T. gondii {{infection}} stimulates {{production of}} IL-2 and IFN-γ by the innate immune system. Continuous IFN-γ production {{is necessary for}} control of both acute and chronic T. gondii infection. These two cytokines elicit a CD4+ and CD8+ T-cell mediated immune response. IL-12 is also produced <b>during</b> <b>T.</b> gondii infection to activate natural killer (NK) cells. Tryptophan is an essential amino acid for T. gondii, which it scavenges from host cells. IFN-γ induces the activation of indole-amine-2,3-dioxygenase (IDO) and tryptophan-2,3-dioxygenase (TDO), two enzymes {{that are responsible for}} the degradation of tryptophan. Immune pressure eventually leads the parasite to form cysts that normally are deposited in the muscles and in the brain of the hosts.|$|E
25|$|Inflammation of {{the colon}} is a {{characteristic}} symptom of ulcerative colitis, and {{a new series of}} drugs in development looks to disrupt the inflammation process by selectively targeting an ion channel. A crucial step involved in the inflammation signaling cascade involves an intermediate conductance calcium activated potassium channel (IK channel) known as KCa3.1; a protein coded for in the human gene KCNN4. Ongoing research seeks to prevent T-cell activation and inflammation by inhibiting the KCa3.1 channel, selectively. Since there is an upregulation of IK channel activity <b>during</b> <b>T</b> cell activation, inhibition of the KCa3.1 is able to disrupt the production of Th1 cytokines IL-2 and TNF-∝. Production of these cytokines decreases because inhibition of KCa3.1 reduces the efflux of K+, which in turn diminishes the influx of Ca2+. By lowering elevated intracellular Ca2+ in patients with ulcerative colitis, these novel drug candidates can inhibit the signaling cascade involved in the inflammation process and help relieve many of the symptoms associated with ulcerative colitis.|$|E

40|$|To obtain {{basic data}} for risk management, the {{influence}} on blood pressure of pain when stretching leg muscles during passive exercise was examined. Ten healthy subjects, 19 - 22 years of age, performed {{two kinds of}} Straight Leg Raise Tests with their left legs. In one test, the leg was raised as high as possible without any pain(Test 1). In the second test, the leg was raised until subjects complained of pain because of muscle stretching(Test 2). During the tests, systolic(SBP) and diastolic blood pressure(DBP) were monitored continuously at the right radial artery using a non-invasive blood pressure measuring apparatus. No {{significant differences were found}} in maximal and minimal SBP and DBP values <b>during</b> <b>Test</b> 1 when compared with those during the resting period. However, maximal SBP and DBP values <b>during</b> <b>Test</b> 2 were significantly higher than those <b>during</b> <b>Test</b> 1 and the resting period. In addition, minimal DBP values <b>during</b> <b>Test</b> 2 were significantly higher than those during the resting period. These results indicate that occupational and physical therapists should manage the risk of changes in blood pressure more carefully when patients complain of muscle stretching pain during passive exercise...|$|R

50|$|An {{important}} feature of JSRV infection {{is the absence of}} any specific immune response from the host.

Another hypothesis is that tumor cells downregulate their major histocompatibility class-I expression, possibly being the reason for the absence of any virus-specific cytotoxic T cell response (CTL).|$|E

50|$|A {{reconciliation}} {{of the two}} models was offered later on suggesting that both co-receptor and germline predisposition to MHC binding play significant roles in imposing MHC restriction. Since only those T cells {{that are capable of}} binding to MHCs are selected for during positive selection in the thymus, to some extent evolutionary pressure selects for germline TCR sequences that bind MHC molecules.

Foreign peptides are brought {{to the surface of}} the cell and presented to T cells by proteins called the major histocompatibility complex (MHC). <b>During</b> <b>T</b> cell development, T cells go through a selection process in the thymus to ensure that the T cell receptor (TCR) will not recognize MHC molecule presenting self-antigens. The selection process results in developed T cells with specific TCRs that might only respond to certain MHC molecules but not others. The fact that the TCR will recognize only some MHC molecules but not others contributes to [...] "MHC restriction".|$|E
50|$|CD79 (Cluster of Differentiation 79) is a {{transmembrane protein}} that forms a complex with the B-cell {{receptor}} (BCR) and generates a signal following recognition of antigen by the BCR. CD79 {{is composed of}} two distinct chains called CD79A and CD79B (formerly known as Ig-alpha and Ig-beta); these form a heterodimer {{on the surface of}} a B cell stabilized by disulfide bonding. CD79a and CD79b are both members of the immunoglobulin superfamily. Human CD79a is encoded by the mb-1 gene that is located on chromosome 19, and CD79b is encoded by the B29 gene that located on chromosome 17. Both CD79 chains contain an immunoreceptor tyrosine-based activation motif (ITAM) in their intracellular tails that they use to propagate a signal in a B cell, in a similar manner to CD3-generated signal tranduction observed <b>during</b> <b>T</b> cell receptor activation on T cells.|$|E
50|$|This gene was {{identified}} by its oncogenic transforming activity in cells. The encoded protein {{is a member}} of the serine/threonine protein kinase family. This kinase can activate both the ERK1/2 and p38 MAP kinases. This kinase was shown to activate IkappaB kinases, and thus induce the nuclear production of NF-kappaB. This kinase was also found to promote the production of TNF-alpha and IL-2 <b>during</b> <b>T</b> lymphocyte activation. Studies of a similar gene in rat suggested the direct involvement of this kinase in the proteolysis of NF-kappaB1,p105 (NFKB1). This gene may also start transcription at a downstream in-frame translation start codon, and thus produce an isoform containing a shorter N-terminus. The shorter isoform has been shown to display weaker transforming activity. In mice, this gene is known as Tpl2 and it is a tumor suppressor gene whose absence contributes to the development and progression of cancer.|$|E

5000|$|Central {{tolerance}} is {{the mechanism}} by which newly developing T cells and B cells are rendered non-reactive to self. The concept of central tolerance was proposed in 1959 by Joshua Lederberg, {{as part of his}} general theory of immunity and tolerance, and is often mistakenly attributed to MacFarlane Burnet. [...] Lederberg hypothesized that it is the age of the lymphocyte that defines whether an antigen that is encountered will induce tolerance, with immature lymphocytes being tolerance sensitive. Lederberg's theory that self-tolerance is 'learned' during lymphocyte development was a major conceptual contribution to immunology, and it was experimentally substantiated in the late 1980s when tools to analyze lymphocyte development became available. Central tolerance is distinct from peripheral tolerance in that it occurs while developing immune cells are still present in the primary lymphoid organs (the thymus and bone-marrow), prior to export into the periphery. Such peripheral tolerance is generated after the cells reach the periphery by regulatory T cells. Such regulatory T cells can be considered both central tolerance and peripheral tolerance mechanisms, as they can be generated from self(or foreign)-reactive T cells in the thymus (<b>during</b> <b>T</b> cell differentiation), but can also exert immune suppression in the periphery on other self(or foreign)-reactive T cells.|$|E
50|$|T {{cell receptors}} {{recognize}} foreign antigens {{which have been}} processed as small peptides and bound to major histocompatibility complex (MHC) molecules at the surface of antigen presenting cells (APC) (APC). Each T cell receptor is a dimer consisting of one alpha and one beta chain or one delta and one gamma chain. In a single cell, the T cell receptor loci are rearranged and expressed in the order delta, gamma, beta, and alpha. If both delta and gamma rearrangements produce functional chains, the cell expresses delta and gamma. If not, the cell proceeds to rearrange the beta and alpha loci. This region represents the germline organization of the T cell receptor gamma locus. The gamma locus includes V (variable), J (joining), and C (constant) segments. <b>During</b> <b>T</b> cell development, the gamma chain is synthesized by a recombination event at the DNA level joining a V segment with a J segment; the C segment is later joined by splicing at the RNA level. Recombination of many different V segments with several J segments provides {{a wide range of}} antigen recognition. Additional diversity is attained by junctional diversity, resulting from the random addition of nucleotides by terminal terminal deoxynucleotidyl transferase. Several V segments of the gamma locus are known to be incapable of encoding a protein and are considered pseudogenes. Somatic rearrangement of the gamma locus has been observed in T cells derived from patients with T cell leukemia and ataxia telangiectasia.|$|E
