40|$|Abstract. We {{describe}} {{the first instance}} of an approach for control programming of humanoid robots, based on evolution as the main adaptation mechanism. In an attempt to overcome some of the difficulties with evolution on real hardware, we use a physically realistic simulation of the robot. The essential idea in this concept is to evolve control programs from first principles on a simulated robot, transfer the resulting programs to the real robot and continue to evolve on the robot. The Genetic Programming system is implemented as a Virtual Register Machine, with 12 internal work registers and 12 <b>external</b> <b>registers</b> for I/O operations. The individual representation scheme is a linear genome, and the selection method is a steady state tournament algorithm. Evolution created controller programs that made the simulated robot produce forward locomotion behavior. An application of this system with two phases of evolution could be for robots working in hazardous environments, or in applications with remote presence robots. ...|$|E
40|$|This paper {{describes}} the synchronization and communication primitives of the Cray T 3 E muhiprocessor, a shared memory sys-tem scalable to 2048 processors. We discuss {{what we have}} learned from the T 3 D project (the predecessor to the T 3 E) and the ratio-nale behind changes made for the T 3 E. We include performance measurements for various aspects of communication and synchro-nization. The T 3 E augments the memory interface of the DEC 21164 micro-processor with a large set of explicitly-managed, <b>external</b> <b>registers</b> (E-registers). E-registers are used as the source or target for all remote communication. They provide a highly pipelined interface to global memory that allows dozens of requests per processor to be outstanding. Through E-registers, the T 3 E provides a rich set of atomic memory operations and a flexible, user-level messaging facility.

40|$|Ecologically {{sustainable}} development {{has become a}} major feature of legal systems at the international, national and local levels throughout the world. In Australia, governments have responded to environmental crises by enacting legislation imposing obligations and restrictions over privately-owned land. Whilst these obligations and restrictions may well be necessary to achieve sustainability, the approach to management of information concerning these instruments is problematic. For example, management of information concerning obligations and restrictions in Queensland is fragmented, with some instruments registered or recorded on the land title register, some on <b>external</b> <b>registers,</b> and some information only available in the legislation itself. This approach is used in most Australian jurisdictions. This fragmented approach has led to two separate but interconnected problems. First, the Torrens system is no longer meeting its goal of providing a complete and accurate picture of title. Second, this uncoordinated approach to the management of land titles, and obligations and restrictions on land use, has created a barrier to sustainable management of natural resources. This is because compliance with environmental laws is impaired in the absence of easily accessible and accurate information. These problems demonstrate a clear need for reform in this area. To determine how information concerning these obligations and restrictions may be most effectively managed, this thesis will apply a comparative methodology and consider three case studies, which each utilise different models for management of this information. These jurisdictions will be assessed according to a set of guidelines for comparison to identify which features of their systems provide for effective management of information concerning obligations and restrictions on title and use. Based on this comparison, this thesis will devise a series of recommendations for an effective system for the management of information concerning obligations and restrictions on land title and use, taking into account any potential legal issues and barriers to implementation. This series of recommendations for reform will be supplemented by suggested draft legislative provisions...|$|E
40|$|We {{propose a}} novel {{energy-efficient}} memory architecture which {{relies on the}} use of cache with a reduced number of tag bits. The idea behind the proposed architecture is based on moving a large number of the tag bits from the cache into an <b>external</b> <b>register</b> (Tag Overflow Buffer) that identifies the current locality of the memory references; additional hardware allows to dynamically update the value of the reference locality contained in the buffer. Energy efficiency is achieved by using, for most of the memory accesses, a reduced-tag cache. This architecture is minimally intrusive for existing designs, since it assumes the use of a regular cache, and does not require any special circuitry internal to the cache such as row or column activation mechanisms. Average energy savings are 51 % on tag energy, corresponding to about 20 % saving on total cache energy, measured on a set of typical embedded applications. 1...|$|R

The choice of the maximum correlation length was based on the required performance in 802.16 e and 3 GPP-LTE release 8. Inputs to the memory system is connected to a Memory Input Generator in Figure 3, which is controlled by the instruction decoder. Memory could accept inputs from the <b>external</b> ports, <b>Register</b> File 2, main CU output or the memory itself in a MOV operation. Memory controller handles the write operations and prevent any racing conditions. The two banks are running on the same operating frequency of the core unit. No special addressing modes are required, and hence, address generators are basically counters. Time sharing between different tasks running on the processor allowed further optimization in the memory system by increasing the memory reuse option.|$|R
