40|$|Heavy shading is {{commonly}} applied during production of pot-plants {{in order to}} avoid damage caused by high light intensities; usually the daily light integral (DLI) is limited to 5 – 8 mol m- 2 d- 1 photosynthetically active radiation (PAR). However, shading carries a production penalty as light is the driving force for photosynthesis. <b>Diffuse</b> <b>glass</b> has been developed to scatter the incident light in greenhouses. This study aims at investigating the effect of <b>diffuse</b> <b>glass</b> cover and high DLI under <b>diffuse</b> <b>glass</b> cover on the growth of pot-plants; furthermore, to systematically identify and quantify the yield components which are influenced by these treatments. Experiments were carried out with two Anthurium andreanum cultivars (Royal Champion and Pink Champion) in a conventional modern glasshouse compartment covered by clear glass with DLI limited to 7. 5 mol m- 2 d- 1 (average realized DLI was 7. 2 mol m- 2 d- 1), and another two glasshouse compartments covered by <b>diffuse</b> <b>glass</b> with DLI limited to 7. 5 (average realized DLI was 7. 5 mol m- 2 d- 1) and 10 mol m- 2 d- 1 (average realized DLI was 8. 9 mol m- 2 d- 1). <b>Diffuse</b> <b>glass</b> cover resulted in less variation of temporal photosynthetic photon flux density (PPFD) distribution compared with the clear glass cover. Under similar DLI conditions (DLI limited to 7. 5 mol m- 2 d- 1), <b>diffuse</b> <b>glass</b> cover stimulated dry mass production per unit intercepted PPFD (RUE) in ‘Royal Champion’ by 8 %; whilst this stimulating effect did not occur in ‘Pink Champion’. Under <b>diffuse</b> <b>glass</b> cover, biomass production was proportional to DLI in both cultivars (within the range 7. 5 – 9 mol m- 2 d- 1). Consequently higher DLI led to more flowers, leaves and stems. Furthermore, high DLI resulted in more compact plants without light damage in leaves or flowers in both cultivars. ‘Pink Champion’ produced more biomass than ‘Royal Champion’ in all treatments because of higher RUE which resulted from a more advantageous canopy architecture for light capture and more advantageous leaf photosynthetic properties.

The crops were planted mid-December 2010 and grown to the middle of November 2011. The influence of diffuse light on light interception, crop morphology, photosynthesis and growth was measured and analysed. Light penetrated deeper into the crop resulting in a higher photosynthetic capacity in the lower canopy, but only in winter. Tomato grown under <b>diffuse</b> <b>glass</b> was more generative, transferring more into fruit production than vegetative growth, in comparison to standard glass or coated glass. The production under the three <b>diffuse</b> <b>glass</b> coverings showed a 7 - 9 % increase in June relative to that under standard glass, and retained this increased production to the end of the year, ending with 8 - 11 % more production.

40|$|SUMMARY A large {{increase}} in agricultural production {{is needed to}} feed the increasing world population with their increasing demand per capita. However, growing competition for arable land, water, energy, and the {{degradation of the environment}} impose challenges to improve crop production. Hence agricultural production efficiency needs to increase. Greenhouses provide the possibility to create optimal growth conditions for crops, thereby improving production and product quality. Light is the driving force for plant photosynthesis and in greenhouse horticulture, light is often the most limiting factor for plant growth. Therefore, improving radiation use efficiency (RUE) in greenhouse production systems is imperative in order to improve plant growth and production. The objective of this thesis is to obtain insight in improving RUE in greenhouse production systems through better understanding of crop physiology. Three aspects related to RUE have been studied in this thesis, 1) improving light distribution in the crop canopy; 2) allowing more light in the greenhouse during summer; and 3) balancing the source and sink strength during plant growth. Light is heterogeneously distributed in the crop canopy. Due to the saturating response of leaf photosynthesis rate to light, a more homogeneous light distribution in the canopy will result in a higher crop photosynthesis. In Chapter 2, the effect of <b>diffuse</b> <b>glass</b> on spatial light distribution in a fully developed tomato canopy and its direct and indirect effects on crop photosynthesis were explored. <b>Diffuse</b> <b>glass,</b> which transforms a portion of direct solar light into diffuse light without influencing the light transmissivity of the glass, was applied as greenhouse cover. Under <b>diffuse</b> <b>glass</b> cover, light was more evenly distributed (in both horizontal and vertical direction) within the canopy compared with plants grown under conventional clear glass cover. Besides a more uniform light distribution, <b>diffuse</b> <b>glass</b> also resulted in higher leaf photosynthetic capacity {{in the middle of the}} crop canopy and in a higher leaf area index (LAI). The higher leaf photosynthetic capacity was positively correlated with a higher leaf total nitrogen and chlorophyll content. Moreover, lower leaf temperature and less photo-inhibition of top canopy leaves were observed under <b>diffuse</b> <b>glass</b> cover when global radiation was high. Total crop photosynthesis between 1 st April and 1 st October was enhanced by 7. 2 % under <b>diffuse</b> <b>glass.</b> This enhancement mainly resulted from four factors (in order of decreasing importance) : a more homogeneous horizontal light distribution, a higher leaf photosynthetic capacity, a more uniform vertical light distribution and a higher LAI. In summer growers of shade tolerant pot-plants often apply shading screens in the greenhouse or white wash on the greenhouse cover in order to avoid leaf or flower damage caused by high light. Shading carries a penalty on potential crop growth which is positively related to the amount of light that can be captured. Considering the advantageous properties of <b>diffuse</b> <b>glass</b> cover, i. e. a more homogeneous light distribution, a lower leaf temperature and less photo-inhibition when global radiation is high, in Chapter 3 we tested the feasibility of allowing more light (i. e. less shading) via <b>diffuse</b> <b>glass</b> cover for cultivation of shade tolerant pot-plants during summer. Two Anthurium andreanum cultivars (Pink Champion and Royal Champion) were grown in 3 greenhouse compartments. Under similar DLI [7. 5 mol m- 2 d- 1 PAR (photosynthetic active radiation) ], <b>diffuse</b> <b>glass</b> cover resulted in 8 % higher crop RUE (i. e. dry mass production per unit intercepted light) in ‘Royal Champion’ compared with clear glass cover treatment, which consequently resulted in higher total biomass production. This effect was not observed in ‘Pink Champion’. Under <b>diffuse</b> <b>glass</b> cover, high DLI (10 mol m- 2 d- 1 PAR) resulted in 20 - 23 % higher total biomass production in both cultivars compared with low DLI (7. 5 mol m- 2 d- 1 PAR), this mainly resulted from the higher cumulative intercepted light. No flower or leaf damage was observed in these treatments. High DLI even resulted in more compact plants as indicated by a higher ratio of aboveground fresh mass to plant height. In Chapter 4, we addressed a question resulting from Chapter 3, i. e. why the stimulating effect of diffuse light on crop RUE in anthurium pot-plants is cultivar specific? We excluded the fraction of canopy light interception and steady-state leaf photosynthesis as potential explanations, and explained it from instantaneous leaf photosynthesis which closely correlates with the temporal light distribution. <b>Diffuse</b> <b>glass</b> cover smoothed the variation of temporal light distribution at a given point on a leaf during a clear day, which consequently resulted in less temporal variation of stomatal conductance in ‘Royal Champion’ which had stomata showing a fast-response to the variation in light intensity. As stomata are the gateway for CO 2 uptake, less variation in stomatal conductance imposed less limitation for leaf photosynthesis under <b>diffuse</b> <b>glass</b> cover, thereby resulting in a higher crop RUE. For ‘Pink Champion’, however, stomata were less responding to variations in light intensity. Therefore, stomata imposed only a marginal limitation on leaf photosynthesis even under clear glass cover where the temporal incident light intensity varied substantially due to the shadow cast by the greenhouse construction parts and equipment. Application of supplementary assimilation light in greenhouses is rapidly increasing. The beneficial effect of supplementary assimilation light is determined by the balance between assimilate production in source leaves and the overall capacity of the plant to use these assimilates. Therefore, it is important to identify the source-sink balance during plant growth. In Chapter 5, three tomato cultivars with different potential fruit size [‘Komeett’ (large size); ‘Capricia’ (medium size); ‘Sunstream’ (small size, cherry tomato) ] were grown under commercial crop management. We estimated the source-sink ratio from the early growth stage to fully fruiting stage through experimentation and model simulation. Carbohydrate content of leaves and stems were periodically determined. Tomato plants showed a period of sink limitation (‘Komeett’ and ‘Capricia’) or came close to sink limitation (‘Sunstream’) during the early growth stage under ample natural irradiance (early September) as indicated by a source-sink ratio higher than or close to 1. Fruiting tomato plants were source-limited as indicated by an extremely low source-sink ratio (average source-sink ratio from 50 days after planting onwards was 0. 17, 0. 22 and 0. 33 for ‘Komeett’, ‘Capricia’ and ‘Sunstream’, respectively). During the fully fruiting stage, the source-sink ratio was negatively correlated with the potential fruit size when commercial fruit load was maintained. Carbohydrate content in tomato stems and leaves increased linearly with plant source-sink ratio. The experiments and results described in this thesis provide insights for improving RUE in greenhouse production systems. The main achievements and limitations as well as practical applications are discussed in Chapter 6.  ...|$|R

40|$|Abstract: Photosynthetically active solar {{radiation}} {{can be either}} direct or diffuse. Due to atmospheric scattering, {{solar radiation}} is never fully direct. Under heavy overcast conditions however, it can be fully <b>diffuse.</b> Screens and <b>glass</b> that transform direct light into diffuse light are used {{under the assumption that}} diffuse light is more evenly distributed over the canopy, increasing crop photosynthesis rate. The Intkam crop growth model computes leaf photosynthesis rate in 5 leaf layers, for the sunlit and shaded leaf area and for the leaf areas receiving direct and diffuse light. It integrates instantaneous leaf photosynthesis rates to the crop photosynthesis rate. Instantaneous canopy photosynthesis is used to compute the seasonal growth of organs. This process approach enables a detailed analysis of the effects of variations in natural light. An analytical comparison was made between 100 % direct and 100 % diffuse light for a representative day in winter (day 24) and in summer (day 202). Sunlit leaf area is illuminated by both direct and diffuse light, whereas a shaded leaf area is illuminated by diffuse light only. These components vary within and among leaf layers, and were all quantified. On both days, a higher instantaneous crop photosynthesis was computed under fully diffuse light than under fully direct light. This difference is caused by the more homogeneous distribution of diffuse light than direct light at a certain canopy depth, in combination with a declining response to increasing light intensities of the photosynthesis rate. Experiments with three types of <b>diffuse</b> <b>glass</b> and a whitewash were conducted in 2011. Light scattering of the glass (haze) varied from 45 - 71 %, with at least the same transmission as the reference. Tomato production under <b>diffuse</b> <b>glass</b> was increased by 8 - 11 % in early June, and was maintained to November.

40|$|Measuring {{the light}} {{transmittance}} of greenhouse covering materials {{has become a}} standard procedure for the horticultural industry. This measurement is based on dry materials. However, transmittance changes (strongly) when water condenses {{on the inside of}} the material. For example, transmittance of traditional clear non-diffusing greenhouse glass usually decreases because the condensed droplets tend to reflect the light instead of transmit it, while some varieties of <b>diffuse</b> <b>glass</b> could increase light transmittance. Because a greenhouse is wet on the inside during a large period of the year it is important to be able to measure transmission with a standardized protocol. In this research a measurement protocol and associated equipment are developed for determining the effect of condensation on the hemispherical light transmission in a standardized way. The protocol is based on natural condensation on a material under a slope according to common greenhouse roof slopes, which is forced by a combination of temperature and humidity. In this way the natural process of draining of condensate is taken into account. The results show that the transmission of traditional clear uncoated (new) horticultural glass drops with about 3 %-points while the effects on the behaviour of the tested types of <b>diffuse</b> <b>glass</b> vary between - 1 %- point up to + 1. 5 %-point...|$|R
40|$|During {{the last}} years {{it has been shown}} that diffuse light is {{advantageous}} for many greenhouse crops. Modern greenhouse covering materials are able to transform direct sunlight into diffuse light. After entering the greenhouse sunlight is scattered and penetrates into the crop, where it is absorbed and used for photosynthesis. Experimental research with different crops (e. g., tomato, cucumber, roses) over {{the last years}} showed an improved production under diffuse light conditions, expressed in growth rate or yield of up to 10 % in The Netherlands. In the last five years different glass producers have put a lot of effort in devel-opment of diffusing greenhouse covering materials. Different structures have been developed and applied on glass for greenhouse application. Glass surface treatments result in regular or irregular patterns on glass such as matt/matt, prismatic, satin, texture and v-grooves. Next to that micro structures are combined with nano-structures, such as anti-reflection treatments (AR), in order to improve light transmission into the greenhouse. It can be shown that material development was able to improve hemispherical light transmission of <b>diffuse</b> <b>glasses</b> by at least 5 % in 2013 compared to before 2007, glasses with larger hemispherical transmission and highly diffusing properties are available. Earlier an evaluation method for diffuse materials had been proposed. That method is mainly based on a measurement of the so-called hemispherical light trans-mission and haze. New possibilities in material technology and increasing knowledge of the relation of diffuse light and crop reactions caused a need to extend evaluation methods. Measuring spatial distribution of transmitted light is suggested next to measuring angular and spectral light transmission. Different new diffuse materials of different producers are measured and evaluated. The results show that <b>diffuse</b> <b>glasses</b> differ in haze and hemispherical light transmission. As well, the choice of basic glass material as the type of anti-reflection treatment are main causes of light spectrum changes. Diffuse structures alone do not cause differences in spectral light transmission. Different structures and AR treat-ments result in different angular light transmission, which explains differences in hemispherical light transmission.

METHODS [...] The chest radiographs of more than 1600 patients with sarcoidosis evaluated in our service between 1976 and 1991 were reviewed to determine the prevalence of this pattern on chest radiography at presentation, and to assess the clinical characteristics of these patients. RESULTS [...] Ten patients (0. 6 %) were identified with <b>diffuse</b> ground <b>glass</b> abnormalities on the chest radiography (eight men); all had associated hilar or mediastinal adenopathy. All patients were white and nine were smokers or former smokers. Nine patients were symptomatic and six had inspiratory crackles on physical examination.

Nine patients were followed for more than three years. All were treated with oral corticosteroids because of significant symptoms or physiological abnormalities, or both. Symptoms and radiological abnormalities disappeared or improved in all patients, but recurred in a high proportion when steroids were tapered or discontinued. By December 1992 only three patients had been withdrawn from treatment.

[...] Most of the effects shots in his earliest films were created via Harryhausen's careful frame-by-frame control of the lighting of both the set and the projector. This dramatically reduced much of degradation common in the use of back-projection or the creation of dupe negatives via the use of an optical printer. Harryhausen's use of <b>diffused</b> <b>glass</b> to soften the sharpness of light on the animated elements allowed the matching of the soft background plates far more successfully than Willis O'Brien had achieved in his early films, allowing Harryhausen to match live and miniature elements seamlessly in most of his shots. By developing and executing most of this miniature work himself, Harryhausen saved money, while maintaining full technical control.A few years later, when Harryhausen began working with color film to make The 7th Voyage of Sinbad, he experimented extensively with color film stocks to overcome the color-balance-shift problems. Ray's producer/partner Charles H. Schneer coined the word Dynamation as a [...] "merchandising term" [...] (modifying it to [...] "SuperDynaMation" [...] and then [...] "Dynarama" [...] for some subsequent films).|$|R
40|$|During winter product {{prices are}} usually high in {{combination}} with natural light as a limiting growth factor. Therefore {{it is important to}} use all the available sunlight for crop production. Important factors which influence light transmission are the structure of the greenhouse (construction elements, orientation, roof slope, symmetrical or asymmetrical design) and the greenhouse roof material (base material, coating(s), diffuse or clear). In {{the first phase of the}} project a simulation model is used for analysing a number of promising new concepts. A combination of these concepts will be integrated in a prototype greenhouse which will be built as part of the IDC Energy. In order to validate the simulation model a practical experiment with scale models in the open field is carried out. During the winter the transmission of these scale models is measured. Despite a number of factors which could not be controlled or modelled, such as rain and condensation, in general there was a good match between measurement and calculation. As an overall conclusion, the simulation model shows no consistent differences with the measurements. It is also proved that an asymmetric cover (saw tooth) {{in combination with}} <b>diffuse</b> <b>glass</b> does not constitute significantly to the light transmission in comparison with a Venlo cover. This supports the decisions made during the design of the final full scale demo greenhouse...|$|R
40|$|Pulmonary {{alveolar}} microlithiasis (PAM) is a {{rare disease}} characterized {{by the presence of}} small calculi in the alveolar space. The authors report a case of a 21 -year-old man with a 2 -year history of shortness of breath on exertion and dry cough. Physical examination was altered only for crackles at auscultation. Pulmonary function revealed a mild restrictive ventilatory defect and the chest radiograph demonstrated paracardiac confluence of dense micronodular infiltrate. High-resolution CT scan revealed <b>diffuse</b> ground <b>glass</b> attenuation and septal thickening, more pronounced in lower pulmonary regions, with calcifications along the interlobar septa and subpleural regions. A transbronchial lung biopsy confirmed the diagnosis of PAM...|$|R

A 55 -year-old previous healthy woman, who consumed half a bottle of alcohol daily, presented with respiratory failure after one week of upper respiratory infection symptoms. Radiography revealed bilateral, <b>diffuse</b> ground <b>glass</b> opacity with patchy consolidation in the whole lung field; bronchoalveolar lavage fluid analysis indicated that rhinovirus was the causative organism. After five days of conservative support, the symptoms and radiographic findings began to improve. We report this rare case of rhinovirus pneumonia in an otherwise healthy host along with a review of references...|$|R

40|$|A 43 -year-old {{woman with}} breast cancer who was on neoadjuvant {{chemotherapy}} presented with cough, sputum and mild fever. High-resolution computed tomography showed <b>diffuse</b> ground <b>glass</b> opacities in bilateral lungs and subpleural patchy consolidations. Initially, she was thought to have pneumonia or interstitial lung diseases such as drug-induced pneumonitis and treated with antibiotics and steroids. She subsequently got breast cancer surgery because of disease progression, and concurrent thoracoscopic lung biopsy revealed metastatic carcinoma of the lung from breast cancer. The diagnosis of suspected interstitial lung disease can be made without lung biopsy, but malignancy should always be considered and lung biopsy should be performed {{in the absence of}} a definitive clinical diagnosis...|$|R
40|$|Abstract: The {{chemical}} composition and the valence state of elements {{on the surface}} of ZrO 2 thin films deposited on glass substrates have been studied by X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy. Results show that: elements of Na, Mg, Zr, Ca exist in the form of their respective stable state, such as Na 2 O, MgO, ZrO 2, CaO, when heat treated at 500 °C for 0. 5 h; but Si is unstable, and exhibit stoichiometrical disturbances. Results of {{chemical composition}} and their content by atom percent of ZrO 2 thin films surface reveal that: Si, and Ca <b>diffuse</b> from <b>glass</b> to the thin films in scale; Na diffuses few and Mg collects to the thin films surface. The diffusion of M...|$|R
