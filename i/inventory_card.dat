In this project, Afif collects and archives every single publication {{in which he}} finds a reproduction of Duchamp's urinal. As a found object, every page containing {{a picture of the}} urinal is torn out and then carefully framed. The frame, used both for its preservative and decorative purposes, is also part of the artistic process. Every step of the archiving process follows meticulous rules which form a part of this artistic process. Each new archived image has its own <b>inventory</b> <b>card,</b> which acts as a certificate of authenticity. Publications which discuss Afif's project (and therefore reproduce images of Duchamp's urinal) are also included in the Fountain Archive project: these, though, are treated as special objects as they constitute a historical echo of the original work. This is the only exception to the generally strict rule that each photograph can only be included in the Fountain Archive once.|$|E

40|$|Issues, met by {{scientists}} {{during the process}} of research on museum documentation (<b>inventory</b> <b>cards,</b> scientific and standardized passports, cards of catalogues) on museum objects, related to themes «History of Ukraine in the 20 th century» and «Rites and everyday life of the Jewish community in Ukraine in 19 - 20 centuries», have been studied in the article. Consideration of the abovementioned situations allowed describing the museum documentation as phenomena which has to evolve together with the access to information in the 21 st century. It has been emphasized that due to the modernization (transformation of <b>inventory</b> <b>cards</b> into the format of scientific and standardized passports, review of ideological clichés and correction of erroneous information in these documents, additional attribution and (re) attribution of exhibits), even better use of museum collections will be provided with minimal time expenditures. Gathering of accurate information about historic attractions will be continued. The accent of the research is the necessity of museum workers’ training (researches and employees of museum funds) within the non-formal education by means of museum’s internal resources. The purpose and relevance of the research has been defined by the given thesis. By generalizations of historiography, it has been found that the suggested topic, including awareness of the obsolescence by museum community (extreme ideological stance, emptiness, falsity) of certain blocks of museum documentation and the criteria of their systematic and complete replacements have not been subjects of the discussion in the museum field yet. In order to expand the research, the list of required types of museum documentation - <b>inventory</b> <b>cards,</b> scientific and standardized passports, catalogs, descriptions, а systematic card index, has been created. It has been determined that the actual museum legislation never uses the word «revision» and uses the word «correction» only in exceptional cases. It has been generalized that a cards of the catalogue, a meaningful source of information about museum objects, is not required, and there are no requirements for its formation. It has been additionally determined that the <b>inventory</b> <b>cards,</b> directories and additional descriptions, stacked on their base before 2000 year, can form now that «confusing» heritage of the Soviet museum sphere, which is referred to by  contemporaries. So, taking into account the fact that a huge part of the exhibits were registered {{at the time of the}} USSR, the information, which was available 30 - 50 years ago, is outdated now. Thus, the <b>inventory</b> <b>cards</b> and cards of catalogues, compiled before 2000 year, have been chosen as a subject of the research.

40|$|This {{research}} develops {{within the}} framework of a recent, widespread, need to give space to the popularization of Earth Sciences and to highlight the scientific work in these disciplines. The geological heritage {{is an essential part of}} the cultural heritage of a territory and it needs land planning, conservation, valorisation and dissemination. In the context of sustainable development, different forms of "thematic" tourism have grown in recent years, including the geotourism. The scientific community is increasingly involved in the economic development of the territory, through the research on geological heritage too. Different aspects are being studied: -the analysis of the territory for the recognition of geological aspects of scientific interest; -their evaluation; -the analysis of the risks to which they are subject and the conservation strategies; -the strategies for the use of the sites, the understanding of scientific aspects by users and tools for the mediation of knowledges. Aim of the research Through the scientific literature and the direct knowledge of an area it is possible to understand the geological heritage value, depending on its conservation and enhancement. For this reason institutions, public and private structures involved in land management often address to the universities and to the research to develop territories potential through the use of geo-environmental information, education, dissemination and sustainable management of the landscape. The aim of this thesis was to prepare a methodological procedure for the geoheritage enhancement, that defines the steps for the analysis of an area, beginning from the geomorphological survey to the creation and dissemination of instruments to popularize the geological heritage. The procedure has been developed starting from pure research, but aimed to its direct application as a guideline for the institutions and structures mentioned above. Study areas The development of the methodological procedure is supported by verifying its functionality through the application on two areas. A natural area, the mountain range of Monti Ernici (Southern Lazio) of known geomorphological interest and of interesting cultural aspects related to karst phenomenon; and an urbanized area, the city of Rome, characterized by the enormous knowledge accumulated in bibliography and the great potential of its geological and cultural heritage. The application of the method involved the geomorphological survey of the areas and the production of thematic cartography. Were inventoried and evaluated the geosites and geomorphosites characterizing the two territories and their data were organized in a relational database, functional to the processing for the automathic choice of geotourist trails. For each area was developed an enhancement proposal. This PhD thesis presents the research work describing it in three parts and an appendix. Part I The first part develops in three chapters introducing the context in which the work fits in. In Chapter 1, summarizing the remarkable bibliography consulted, are introduced the terms of geological heritage and the definitions adopted among the various developed in the history of this kind of studies. In particular geological goods are described as part of the cultural heritage and the definition of geosite is explained through its historical evolution (Strasser et al., 1995; Grandgirard, 1997, 1999; Wimbledon et al., 1999), its increasing specificity depending on the fields of application (Panizza & Piacente, 1999, 2003; Panizza, 2001) and through the definition of descriptive attributes of the quality of a geological site (Reynard, 2004, 2005). Some important concept are introduced such as geodiversity and geoconservation, and the application concepts of “geodiffusione” (spreading geological knowledges, Piacente, 2003) and geotourism (Hose, 1995, 2000; Newsome & Dowling, 2010; Gray, 2011; Arouca Declaration, 2011). The Chapter 2 is a retrospective of the projects, the research and the legislation about geological heritage, starting from the understanding of the need to safeguard geodiversity such as biodiversity. This excursus is a pan of the national and international initiatives. It is highlight the importance of Geoparks initiative, under the auspices of UNESCO, and the Italian Geological Service's role in launching the national-level projects. Particular attention was paid to the state of the art in the Latium region, to mark the starting point of the work on the study areas. The Latium regional geosites inventory was arranged by the Regional Park Agency-ARP (Cresta et al., 2005), in the context of initiatives undertaken by the Geological Survey, in collaboration with it and with the Latium Region. The ARP provided the geosites evaluation too, developing an evaluation model that indexes the Intrinsic Value of Sites of Geological Interest (VISIG). This index allows to give a priority order to the protection and preservation of geosites. The Regional Park Agency also contributed to the promulgation of regional laws for the geosites protection (D. G. R. Lazio 859 / 09). In the Chapter 3 are described the interventions of the research on geological heritage, in particular the axis on which the studies develop (evaluation, protection, popularization) and the problems they face. The first paragraph introduce the results of international and national research on the evaluation models of geological heritage goods. There are different models depending on the purpose of the evaluations, which can be summed up in three kinds: awareness and conservation of geosites (Panizza & Piacente, 1993; Serrano & Gonzales Trueba, 2005; Pereira et al., 2007; Fattori & Mancinella, 2010; Coratza et al., 2012), environmental impact assessments (Rivas et al., 1997; Coratza & Giusti, 2005; Bruschi & Cendrero, 2005), education and/or local development through thematic tourism (Reynard, 2007; Bollati, 2012). The same type of description is made of the tools developed for the protection, legislation and management of geosites, which concerns the administration of the territory. Management is also the issue of the vulnerability of the sites, exposed to flows of visitors, but also the vulnerability of the visitors in the presence of active geosites and, in particular, active geomorphosites (Reynard, 2004). Finally, are described the geo-heritage enhancement strategies on which the majority of studies concentrate: geotourist trails planning (Coratza et al., 2004; The Via Geoalpina VVAA, 2010; Del Monte et al., 2013; Magagna et al., 2013) virtual and non-virtual ones, static mapping (Carton et al., 2005; Castaldini, 2005; Coratza & Regolini-Bissig, 2009; Regolini-Bissig & Reynard, 2010 and bibliography inside; Regolini, 2012) and dynamic (Ghiraldi et al., 2009, 2010), the preparation of informational supports, panels, guides and smartphones applications (Small, 2005; Qiu & Hubble, 2012 e bibliography inside; Magagna et al., 2010; divulgando. eu), methods for the scientific information interpretation (Cayla, 2009; Dowling, 2010; Calonge, 2010; Cardozo Moreira, 2012) and in conclusion the evaluation of the efficacy of these products (Sellier, 2009; Martin et al., 2010). The chapter closes by raising issues like the need for a uniform methodology of analysis, the disclosure of evaluations and the need to use the environmental interpretation, particularly in the geotourist cartography. Part II In this part of the thesis are shown the purpose of the work, the methods chosen to built the enhancement procedure and the integrations improved on the methods, to optimize the purposes. The Part II develops in two chapters in which it deals with the revision of several existing methods for the inventory, evaluation and enhancement of the geological heritage (methods chapter). The other chapter (materials chapter) describes the instruments chosen for enhancement and summarize the work in the proposal for a methodology that allows to start from the territory to get to its usability in geotourist terms. The chapter 4 refers to methods consulted for each step of the analysis and geotourist enhancement of an area, then arousing the interest on the integretions. Bibliographic consultation, for example, based on scientific publications, is complemented by tourist and popularization ones, such as data about the historical-archaeological heritage. This informations are needed for the enhancement of cultural landscapes in which the geosites are inserted. Among the methods for the analysis and the representation of the areas there are the geomorphological survey and mapping. In the paragraph related to the materials of enhancement the geotourist mapping methods are described and the proposal of a model for geotourist map legend. The selection and integrations of the inventory and evaluation methods constitute the fundamental element of the chapter. The methods have been analyzed and dismantled in their parts to build a new inventory and evaluation card: it contains informations open to every kind of reader and it shows the significance of a site for geotourism. The card is based on two models: the geosite <b>inventory</b> <b>card</b> by ISPRA (Italian insitute for Environmental Protection and Research, isprambiente. it) and the geosite evaluation model proposed by the ARP (Latium Regional Park Agency; Fattori & Mancinella, 2010). The integrations to this methods are described below. Geosite inventory card: •	the information given is useful and essential (the document is simple, easy to read and it uses a non-specialist language); •	the iconographic and representative aspects of the geological site are widely highlighted (images, maps, explanatory schemes of genetic processes); •	the scientific description is in non-specialist terms and it is based on the interpretation of scientific language (Ham, 1984); •	in the card are described scientific interests of the site and additional (contextual) too; •	the informations given are useful for the approach to the site (land use, conservation status, guidance on usability and accessibility). Geosite evaluation card: The use of a site of geological interest for economic development through geotourism need to evaluate different aspect of a geosite. Among the several attributes which could be quantified, can't miss the attributes summarized in the new index proposed in this thesis, the Value of a Site for Geotourism (VSG) index: VSG= RP+RR+SCE+SAC+AC the attributes are representativeness (RP), rarity (RR), scenic value (SCE), historical-cultural-archeological value (SAC) and accessibility (AC). The card allows to confer a value to each attribute identifing the characteristics of the geosite and recognizing them in the descriptions in the card. Each description try to remove the subjectivity of the selection and confers a value to the analysis of the geosite characteristics. The integrations to the base model lie in: •	some aspects included in representativeness (RP) evaluation has been redefined; the relationship between frequency of a geological aspect and the geographical setting of analysis is a new proposal for rarity (RR) evaluation; sub-attributes describing the scenic value (SCE) of a site are integrated from other models (Reynard et al, 2007; Ghiraldi, 2011) and “peculiarity of the forms” has been introduced as a new characteristic; the evaluation of historical, archaeological and cultural value (SAC) of the site has been included in the geosite evaluetion; the difficulty to reach a site and the presence of nearby services are the sub-attributes for the accessibility (AC); •	the card has been reviewed in order to make possible to understand the evaluation of a geological good to "non-specialists" users. •	finally, when compared to other evaluation models, the Value of a Site for Geoturism doesn’t present weights of the attributes. Infact, scientific attributes of the geosite are as important as additional ones, as the definition of geotourism wants (Arouca Declaration, 2011). The chapter 5 describes the materials of this research, consisting of geoturist enhancement tools. Chief among these a relational database in G. I. S. environment, for storage, management and analysis of all data (results of the survey, the geosite inventory and evaluation, network of touristic attractors of the analyzed areas, etc.). The geographical characterization of geomorphosites (forms present in geographic space, which are mapped and spatially georeferenced), linked to a number of attributes, makes them ideal objects to be managed by G. I. S systems. The database consists of 3 types of data: raster files, vector files, tables. The tables are structured on the basis of the assessment model of the VSG. Using the potential of relational database (connections between tables with one-to-one relationships and many to one and/or query formulation) it is possible to get the selection of geosites that respond to specific needs (Gregori & Melelli, 2005). The geographic properties of the data (georeferencing) also allows to create connection paths between sites, which take into account additional features such as usability or accessibility (geotourist itineraries). This is the procedure used to develop geoturist itineraries, described in the paragraph dedicated to enhancement tools. It is shown how to set a query, from the choice of a set of specific requirments for the itinerary: -choosing data from query -joining tables -queries of type ‘select by attributes [...] . ' and ' select by location [...] . '. Geosites with requested attributes and the closest traces (paths or roads) are selected in this way and joined to build the itinerary. The popularization of the geotourist itinerary consists in the description by stops, which is combined to the geoturist map. The problems of geoturist mapping (Regolini, 2012) are analyzed in this chapter to propose simplifications, changes and integrations of a geomorphologic map used to develop a the geoturist one. In particular, integrations include: the theme of the map, the base, the scale, the legend and the geo-morphological symbology. Each map product in this thesis is the synthesis of digital georeferenced data, which constitute the G. I. S environment relational database. The data stored in the database will appear as a paper geoturist map or as digital frame, via a web-gis that works on computerized platforms with a user-friendly interface. At the moment, the work still lack of the web-GIS implementation and interface. The last paragraph of chapter 5 summarizes in a flowchart the procedure proposed for the geoturist enhancement of an area, which may have application as a guideline for the institutions and public and private structures involved in the management and development of the territory. Part III The last part of the thesis is divided into three chapters, focusing on the areas of application of the methodology proposed. The chapter 6 briefly describes the landscapes of the Lazio region and places Rome and the Ernici Mountains within their variety, reflecting the distribution of the litostructural units and hence the regional geo-diversity. It also mentions the tourism dynamics in Lazio and the fusion of natural and cultural aspects of the territories represented in the selected areas. It gives an added value for Lazio classic tourism. The chapter 7 introduce the geographical and geological framework of Rome, followed by a description of the geomorphologic detection. Rome has been the subject of numerous studies, some of which about geomorphological setting (Bellotti et al., 1997, Della Seta & Del Monte, 2006; Ascani et al., 2008; Del Monte et al., 2013). Data avalaible in bibliography are not homogeneous, beacause of the different subjects and objectives of the studies. The analysis of different aspects did’nt include the geomorphological survey and the description of results, traditionally structured in the genetic classification of forms and data representation on a geomorphological map. For this reason, the geomorphological survey was conducted, at 1 : 10, 000 scale and produced the geomorphologic map of Rome. The geosite inventory was supported by this analysis and the geomorphological map is the basis for the geoturist map. The geosites inventory allowed to add two new geosites (geomorphosites) to the regional inventory: the Tiberina Island, a fluvial bar arosed where the Velabrum Maius merge into the Tevere counter flow and with an almost flat confluence angle; and the Testaccio Mount, an example of human morphogenesis, with its 48 m s. l. m. consisting of testae, broken Roman amphoras. The VSG (Value of a Site for Geotourism) of these geomorphosites, and the geosite reported by ARP (Regional Park Agency), has been evaluated. The results data, stored in ESRI ArcMap ® (ArcGIS software), were interrogated through specific queries, selecting the geosites of " mid-high VSG, linked to historical and archaeological aspects of high importance and quoting Roman legends or traditions, with high scenic value (SCE attribute) due to grandeur and presence of naturality colors ". Queries are the translation of this sentence. The enhancement proposal of the area consists of a geotourist itinerary, developed linking the selected geosites. The geotourist map includes the itinerary description with suggested stops of natural and cultural interests. Text and diagrams allow the scientific explanation of geological and geomorphological aspects and refer to historical-archeological ones (Coarelli, 2001; Insolera, 2001; Puliga & Panichi, 2009; Touring Club Italiano, 1999). The structure of chapter 8 is the same of the previous one: Ernici Mountains geographical and geological framework, geomorphological survey, geosites inventory and evaluation, enhancement. The literature about geomorphological setting of this area is very lacking. The mountain chain extension is about 550 km 2, this wide area demanded the choice of two sub-areas representative of the morphological aspects, on which concentrate the 1 : 10, 000 scale geomorphologic survey. An area includes Lazio and Abruzzi slopes of Viglio Mount and the ridges towards Campo Catino, including the homonimous hollow; the second sub-area insists on the Fiume river valley, Trisulti of Collepardo, including the foothills of the Rotonaria and Monna Mountains. The geosites inventory for these areas has identified three new geomorphosites unreported in regional inventory: the Viglio Mount wreck glacial cirque, fine example of the last glacial maximum glacialism forms on the Lazio-Abruzzi Apennines; the Madonna delle Cese (Our Lady of Meadows) Cave, a karst open cave that now houses a chapel; and the Arch in the rock of Trisulti, the wreck of a pressured karstic pipe of an ancient karstic underground grid. The superficial streaming reached and intruded by erosion the underground one, so nowadays the Fiume river flows thorugh the ancient pipe track. The VSG (Value of a Site for Geotourism) of these geomorphosites, and the geosite reported by ARP (Regional Park Agency), has been evaluated. The procedure of automatic selection of sites to develop the geotourist itinerary was not applied, because of the geographical separation of the two sub-areas and the related difficulty to develop an itinerary connecting them. The enhancement proposal of the Ernici Mounts consits of the geoturist map (paper) of the Rotonaria Mount-Trisulti of Collepardo sub-area, which includes a geoturist itinerary described by stops, schematic scientific aspects explanation and images. The itinerary tells about the cultural landscape (Sauer, 1925; Andreotti, 1998, 2008; Unesco, 2005) of the area, through Karst, hermitages and spirituality.

The {{aim of this study}} is to document, analyze, and evaluate social, architectural and enviromental characteristics of the historic Değirmendağı District of İzmir, Turkey. Değirmendağı is located near the city center, providing a silhouette to the city. This ninteenth-century residential area was settled by refugees immigrating after the 1877 - 1878 Russo-Turkish War. Later, Değirmendağı District began to lose its integrity owing to lack of care and interest, and demographic changes in the neighborhood. Documentation methods used are sketches, photography. Documentation architectural and social questionnaires. <b>Inventory</b> <b>cards</b> were prepared to collect architectural characteristics of each building. Data gathered at the site was analyzed and evaluated to develop conservational approach, including historical review of the ancient era. The variables of the study are composed of two groups. The first is architectural characteristics: disposition of buildings, land use, number of storeys, plan and façade typologies, exterior architectural elements, period of buildings, construction technique, structurnal condition, types of alterations, and visual values. The second group is comprised of socio. economic characteristics: ownership and rent groups, origin, density, education, profession, income and sanitary conditions.

40|$|A presente pesquisa busca entender o programa iconográfico desenvolvido nas igrejas das Veneráveis Ordens Terceiras do Carmo, do Brasil, a partir dos sete Passos da Paixão de Cristo: Cristo no Horto, Cristo da Prisão, Cristo da Flagelação, Cristo da Coroação de espinhos, Ecce Homo, Senhor dos Passos e Cristo Crucificado. Trata-se, portanto, de estudar as sete esculturas devocionais dos diferentes momentos da Paixão de Cristo, que cumpriam uma dupla função: participar do programa iconográfico das igrejas brasileiras e da Procissão do Triunfo, realizada pelos irmãos terceiros carmelitas, nos séculos XVII e XVIII. Essa procissão fechava o tempo da Quaresma, aberto pelos irmãos leigos franciscanos, com a Procissão das Cinzas. Tem ainda como objetivo tecer considerações sobre a Ordem de Nossa Senhora do Carmo, Antiga Observância e Descalços, partindo da origem no Monte Carmelo, na Palestina, a sua introdução no território português e, a partir do século XVI, a sua instalação no Brasil. A seguir, determinar a origem das Ordens Terceiras do Carmo, como reflexo da sociedade da Península Ibérica, e o envolvimento dos leigos na encomenda e confecção dos seus altares e na própria construção das suas Igrejas. Buscou-se também valorar a importância das procissões na religiosidade popular e, em particular, da Procissão do Triunfo, com a devoção aos Passos da Paixão de Cristo, pelos irmãos leigos carmelitas, {{principal}} festividade da Ordem Terceira. O tema da Paixão de Cristo ganhou importância no final da Idade Média, a partir da espiritualidade desenvolvida pelas ordens mendicantes e pela Devotio Moderna, que certamente favoreceu o desenvolvimento de um forte caráter narrativo nas cenas retratadas nas igrejas carmelitas. Procurou-se, então, relacionar as esculturas às respectivas fontes textuais e imagéticas que pudessem ter servido de fonte de inspiração, principalmente a partir do século XV, com as novas tecnologias de reprodução gráfica. Por fim, pretendeu-se estudar as esculturas a partir das leituras cabíveis à História da Arte: técnica, iconográfica e estilística. O acervo foi inventariado e fotografado em fichas de inventário, tornando-se o volume II desta tese. A partir da inventariação, as esculturas foram agrupadas e estudadas entre si e comparativamente a similares de outras igrejas, a partir das características que apresentavam, tentando enquadrá-las nos estilos de época: barroco e rococó, com alguns exemplares alcançando o neoclassicismo, de princípios do século XIX. The {{present research}} seeks {{to understand the}} iconographic program developed at the churches of the Venerable Third Orders of Carmo in Brazil, focused on the seven Steps of Christ’s Passion: Christ at the Garden of Olives, Christ Imprisioned, Christ Whipped, Christ Crowned with Thorns, Ecce Homo, Lord of Steps and Crucified. Therefore, the work deals with studying the seven liturgical sculptures of the different moments of Christ’s Passion, which bore a double role: participating in the iconographic program of Brazilian churches and in the Procession of Thriumph, developed by the Third Order of Carmelite brothers in the 17 th and 18 th centuries. That Procession closed the Lent season, opened by the lay Franciscan brothers with the Procession of Ashes. This study also aims at establishing insights on the Order of Our Lady of Carmo, formely Observance and Barefeet, starting from its origin in Mount Carmel, in Palestine, through its introduction into the Portuguese territory and, as the 16 th century, its setting up in Brazil. Then it seeks to determine {{the origin of the}} Third Orders of Carmo as a reflex of the society in the Iberic Peninsula and the laymen’s envolvement in ordering and erecting their altars and in the construction of their churches itself. The research also seeks to value the importance of the processions in popular religiousness and, in particular, of the Procession of Triumph, with the devotion of the lay Carmelite brothers to the Steps of the Passion of Christ, the main festivity of the Third Order. The Passion of Christ theme became important {{at the end of the}} Middle Ages, from the spirituality developed by the Begging Orders and by Devotio Moderna, which certainly favored the development of strong narrative character in the scenes portrayed in the Carmelite churches. It seeks then to relate the sculptures to the corresponding textual and imagery sources tha could have served as inspiration, mainly from the 15 th century, with the new graphic reproduction technologies. The final purpose is studying the sculptures based on applicable readings to Art History: technical, iconographic and stylistic. The colection was surveyed and photographed in very simple <b>inventory</b> <b>cards,</b> becoming the second volume of this thesis. As from <b>inventory,</b> the <b>cards</b> were grouped and studied among themselves, and comparatively, with similar ones from other churches, based on their features, attempting to fit them into the styles of the period: Baroque and Rococo, with some instances reaching the neoclassical period of the beginning of the 19 th century...|$|R

40|$|A {{business}} process, such as {{the process}} followed when ordering a book, describes the order of executing tasks (e. g., check <b>inventory,</b> verify credit <b>card,</b> and ship book). Business applications implement the business processes for the daily operations of an organization. Organizations must continuously modify their business applications to accommodate changes to business processes. However, business applications are often designed and developed without referring to the documented definitions of business processes. Modifying business applications is a time-consuming and error-prone task. To correctly perform this task, developers require an in-depth understanding of multi-tiered applications and the definitions of the business processes which they implement. In this paper, we present an approach which automatically recovers business process definitions from multi-tiered business applications. Given the starting UI screen of a particular business process, the approach recovers the process definition by tracing the flow of control throughout the different tiers of the business application. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach through a case study using 15 business applications from three large open-source projects.

40|$|Abstract Introduction. Low {{functioning}} {{variants of}} 5 HTTLPR {{have been associated}} to {{an increased risk of}} depression in subjects who experienced stressful events, to altered cognitive functioning and decisional processes, and functional and structural neural patterns. Contrasting evidence is available up to now in Eating Disorders (ED), and no study has evaluated the polymorphism effect on brain connectivity according to graph theory in Anorexia Nervosa (AN). Methods. We recruited up to 735 patients with life-time history of AN or bulimia nervosa (BN) according to DSM-IV criteria and up to 241 healthy controls (HC) for the assessment of the association between 5 HTTLPR polymorphism and ED. We merged our Biobank data from BIO. Ve. D. A. and meta-analyzed 22 former studies. Patients underwent a structured diagnostic interview for present or life-time ED, an interview for presence and severity of stressful events, Edinburgh Handedness <b>Inventory,</b> Wisconsin <b>Card</b> Sorting Test, Trail A making test, Trail B making test, Iowa Gambling Task, Cognitive Bias Task, psychopathology rating scales for ED and general symptoms. Finally patients with AN and HCs underwent a Magnetic Resonance; their brains’ connectivity integration and segregation measures were then measured with Graph Analysis Toolbox, according to 5 HTTLPR polymorpshim. Results. Our results from a meta-analysis including data from BIO. Ve. D. A. and 22 previous studies, suggest that 5 HTTLPR polymorphism does not have a role per se in determing ED onset. However it may moderate the effect of SEs in increasing the risk of ED onset, and the influence of SEs on ED severity, anxious, depressive and obsessive symptoms. When we tested both a multiplicative and an additive model, which is considered to be more representative of a real-world gene by environment interaction, such a 5 HTTLPR by SE interaction was not confirmed instead. S allele was associated with worse performance at Cognitive Bias Task and Trail Making B, and with increased ED psychopathology, general psychopathology, anxious, depressive, and obsessive symptoms. Finally S allele was associated with decreased segregation measures at brain connectivity analysis according to graph theory compared with L allele in AN; this was an opposite association compared with healthy controls who had higher modularity associated with S allele instead. Conclusions. 5 HTTLPR polymorphism {{does not seem to be}} a causal factor of ED per se, but it seems to play a role in moderating the role of stressful events in increasing ED risk. Such a moderation however did not reflect a gene by environment interaction according to either a multiplicative or additive model.

40|$|Introduction In {{the last}} years, {{cognitive}} functioning in eating disorder patients has received increased {{attention in the}} literature. However, few studies have investigated the neuropsychological characteristics of bulimia nervosa (BN) and the results {{reported in the literature}} are often ambiguous and inconclusive. The aim {{of this study was to}} investigate the main executive functions in a sample of patients with BN and address similarities and differences with patients with anorexia nervosa (AN) and healthy controls. In addition, it has been explored the difference between the acute diagnosis and lifetime diagnosis in relation to neurocognitive performance. Methods The subjects of the study were 459 female patients divided into 62 patients with a diagnosis of acute BN, 143 patients with acute AN, 50 patients in remission from AN, and 204 healthy control subjects. All subjects were administered a battery of neuropsychological tests for the investigation of the main executive functions: Edinburgh Handedness <b>Inventory,</b> Wisconsin <b>Card</b> Sorting Test, Rey-Osterrieth Complex Figure, Block Design Test, Memory test with Interference 10 "and 30 ", Iowa Gambling Task and Stop Signal Task. The sample was further classified into patients with lifetime diagnosis of BN with no history of AN (n = 18), patients with a history of restrictive AN (AN-R, n = 135) and patients with a history of AN with binge eating or purging behavior and BN with a history of AN (n = 112). Results The acute BN patients showed poor performance in the task investigating set shifting and decision-making. A higher rate of patients BN reported impaired scores in visuo-spatial memory. No impairment was found in relation to working memory, inhibitory control and central coherence. All DCA patients were significantly more likely to be left-handed than healthy controls. The analysis of the variance showed no significant cognitive impairment for BN patients without a lifetime diagnosis of AN, but a higher rate of these patients than controls reported impaired scores in visual-spatial memory and in set shifting tasks (lower WCST global performance and greater number of perseverative errors). A higher number of patients AN-R and AN + BN reported deficit scores in flexibility and perseverative errors, decision-making, visuo-spatial ability and inhibitory response. Conclusions Even the BN in the acute phase of illness is characterized by poor set shifting and impaired decision-making. In addition, some BN patients have perseverative deficits and visual-spatial difficulties in greater proportion than healthy controls, also if these deficits are not common feature in all patients. The BN patients do not seem to have difficulties in motor control and in executive functions in general (non-perseverative errors), probably due to their greater ability to maintain the attention. The presence of a poor performance in patients BN and AN patients in remission support the hypothesis that alterations are not only the consequences of nutritional status and low weight. The visual-spatial difficulties and poor set shifting may not only represent important predisposing and maintenance factors to BN, but they may also interfere with treatment curse and outcome of the diseas...|$|R

The letters were written between 1892 and 1934, mostly from Berlin and Wannsee. Prominent events of the time such as World War I, the revolutionary years after the war, German inflation and the rise of National Socialism are reflected in the correspondence. Liebermann also discusses art questions, exhibits and publications. All the letters are bound in an album. In addition, there are letters to Bruno and Paul Cassirer and letters on Liebermann's election as president of the Preussische Akademie der Kuenste. The collection also contains various photocopies and transcripts of letters by Max Liebermann as well as materials about him such as clippings, family trees, exhibition catalogues, and photos of him, his studio and his works. Also included is a manuscript by Julius Elias titled "Max Liebermann zu Hause (1847 - 1935) ", which is a description of the painter's life at home. It was published by Paul Cassirer in Berlin in 1918. A copy is available in the LBI library r (f) ND 588 L 52 E 45. Max Liebermann was born in Berlin in 1847. He first studied law and philosophy, but later turned to painting and drawing. He studied and worked in Weimar in 1869, in Paris in 1872, and in the Netherlands from 1876 through 1877. After residing and working in Munich for some time, he returned to Berlin in 1884 and was active there for the rest of his life. Although he was himself a rather conservative artist, he helped to found the Sezession, an organization of progressive artists in Berlin in 1899. In 1920, he was elected president of the Preussische Akademie der Kuenste. He resigned in 1933, after he was forbidden to paint and the academy decided to no longer exhibit paintings by Jewish painters.
