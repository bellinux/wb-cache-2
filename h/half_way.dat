5|$|About <b>half</b> <b>way</b> between Englefield and Linwood was Holy Trinity Avonside, at {{the time}} a cob church. Guise Brittan was its churchwarden. The whole Brittan family had a close {{connection}} to the church, with Joseph Brittan helping to raise money for its construction, and his daughter Mary singing in the church choir. They faithfully attended church on Sundays.|$|E

Bletchley was relegated to the status of suburb.|$|E
5|$|No. 1 Squadron (AFC) patrols {{found the}} Shunet Nimrin {{garrison}} {{still in place}} {{on the morning of}} 22 September, but Rujm el Oshir camp (to the east of Jericho, <b>half</b> <b>way</b> between the Jordan River and the Hedjaz railway) had been broken up, and fires burned west of the Amman railway station. Ain es Sir camp (south east of Es Salt, <b>half</b> <b>way</b> between the Jordan River and Amman) was found to be full of Ottoman troops, but at about midday the Ottoman garrison at Es Salt was hastily packing. Australian airmen reported the whole area east of the Jordan to be on the move towards Amman by between 15:00 and 18:00, when two Bristol Fighters bombed a mass of traffic at Suweile, half-way between Es Salt and Amman, and fired nearly 1,000 machine-gun rounds.|$|E
5|$|By early December 1916, {{construction}} of the railway had reached the wells at Bir el Mazar, the last water sources available to the EEF before El Arish. Bir el Mazar was about <b>half</b> <b>way</b> between Kantara on the Suez Canal and the Egyptian-Ottoman territorial border. British intelligence had reported Ottoman Army plans to strengthen the garrison at Magdhaba, by extending the railway (or light rail) south east from Beersheba (and Hafir el Auja) towards Magdhaba.|$|E

5|$|Despite The Big Room being {{critically}} acclaimed, {{it was not}} as commercially {{successful as}} their first album, which Verdens Gang attributed to a lacklustre promotion campaign by Atlantic Records. <b>Half</b> <b>way</b> through their tour with Jewel in mid July, M2M were removed as the opening act by Atlantic who cited disappointing sales of The Big Room, which at that time had sold around 100,000 units in America. Shocked and disappointed by the decision, M2M returned to Norway, and ceased performing together. Raven was immediately offered a solo record contract from Atlantic, though she later withdrew from the offer.|$|E
5|$|Kh. Fusail {{was about}} <b>half</b> <b>way</b> to the Jisr ed Damieh bridge, and after {{waiting for the}} {{dismounted}} sections of Meldrum's Force to arrive, the consolidated force advanced to attack Jisr ed Damieh. The 2nd Battalion, British West Indies Regiment remained to garrison Kh. Fusail, occupying a position at Talat Armah to protect Meldrum's right flank and rear, and if necessary to block the track from Mafid Jozele. Aerial reconnaissance flights during the evening of 21 September, confirmed that Shunet Nimrin {{in the rear of}} Meldrum's Force was still strongly garrisoned, and that the roads and tracks running west from Amman were carrying normal traffic.|$|E

5|$|The Ridge Route, officially the Castaic-Tejon Route, was a two-lane highway between Los Angeles and Kern counties, California. Opened in 1915 and {{paved with}} 15-ft {{concrete}} between 1917 and 1921, {{the road was}} the first paved highway directly linking the Los Angeles Basin with the San Joaquin Valley over the Tejon Pass and the rugged Sierra Pelona Mountains ridge south of Gorman. Much of the old road runs through the Angeles National Forest, and passes by many historical landmarks, including the National Forest Inn, Reservoir Summit, Kelly's <b>Half</b> <b>Way</b> Inn, Tumble Inn, and Sandberg's Summit Hotel. North of the forest, the Ridge Route passed through Deadman's Curve before ending at Grapevine.|$|E
5|$|The {{first major}} {{undertaking}} for Task Force 113 (now redesignated TF.57) was Operation Iceberg-offshore {{support for the}} US landings at Okinawa-which got under way on 1 April 1945. The force was subjected to sporadic Japanese kamikaze attacks, but the two ships emerged unscathed from these actions. Howe's anti-aircraft batteries also succeeded in shooting down an attacking kamikaze plane. The two ships' principal roles were air defence and land bombardment, the latter being carried out very accurately, particularly by Howe against anti-aircraft installations {{on the island of}} Miyako, <b>half</b> <b>way</b> between Okinawa and Formosa.|$|E

5|$|While the Muslims were {{occupied}} at Fahl, Heraclius, sensing the opportunity, quickly sent an army under General Theodras to recapture Damascus.

The Byzantine army met the Muslims <b>half</b> <b>way</b> to Emesa, at Maraj-al-Rome. During the night Theodras sent half of his army towards Damascus to launch a surprise attack on the Muslim garrison.|$|E
5|$|After a drawn first Test {{the second}} match {{was a game}} of two halves. England {{developed}} a 233 run lead at the <b>half</b> <b>way</b> stage and had the West Indies on 204/5 when Butcher was caught. This dismissal caused a riot and from this point onwards England struggled with the spin bowling of Sobers and Gibbs, narrowly avoiding defeat by two wickets. The third Test saw another drawn match due to the slow batting of the West Indies, taking over two days to score 349 runs which included a spell of four runs in one hour. England took a 1–0 lead after the fourth Test, {{in a game that}} they seemed least like winning. The win was mainly due to Sobers' decision to declare on 92/2 in the West Indies second innings. Good batting by Alan Knott and a 127 sixth wicket partnership ensured the final game ended in a draw as England maintained their 1–0 lead to win the series.|$|E
5|$|Late on June2, the National Hurricane Center (NHC) {{highlighted}} {{the potential for}} an {{area of low pressure}} to form well south of the coasts of Guatemala and El Salvador over subsequent days. This forecast came to fruition early on June7, when shower and thunderstorm activity began to increase in association with a trough south of the Gulf of Tehuantepec. Steered steadily northwestward by a subtropical ridge, the disturbance acquired organized, deep convection near the center, prompting the NHC to upgrade it to a tropical depression at 18:00UTC on June10. Following the formation of a spiral band that wrapped more than <b>half</b> <b>way</b> around the center, the depression was upgraded to Tropical Storm Carlos at 12:00UTC the following day while positioned about 230miles (370km) south of Acapulco, Mexico.|$|E

50|$|It is {{the script}} that {{shoulders}} the film, but its formulaic structure {{adds to the}} drawbacks. The initial reels have lighter moments that keep the viewers engaged. The second <b>half</b> stretches <b>way</b> too long with a predictable climax. Editing could have been tighter.|$|R
5|$|The English {{played the}} first half with the wind behind them and their nine-man scrum {{dominated}} the smaller Welsh pack. At half time Wales were 7–0 down following tries from Frederick Lohden and Howard Marshall and a conversion from England captain Andrew Stoddart. The second half started poorly for Wales when Marshall scored a second try following excellent English forward pressure. The game turned not long after: the English forwards could not maintain the pace they had set in {{the first half}} of the game, and began to slow. Then Welsh forward Charles Nicholl broke through a line-out with the ball, transferred it to Hannan, who passed to Gould at the <b>half</b> <b>way</b> line. Gould evaded both Alderson and Lockwood before outpacing Edwin Field to score beneath the posts. Bancroft converted. A near identical move resulted in Conway Rees then releasing Cardiff wing Norman Biggs who scored with a run from the half-way line, though this time the conversion missed.|$|E
5|$|The Ottoman attackers dug {{themselves}} in {{on a line}} through Balin and Berkusie while the line {{taken up by the}} Australian Mounted Division began with the 3rd Light Horse Brigade facing east on a line running due north from about <b>half</b> <b>way</b> between Iraq el Menshiye and Summil. The line then turned westward so the 5th Mounted Brigade faced northwards in front of Summil with the 4th Light Horse Brigade to their left in front of Ipseir and connecting with the right of the infantry division; the 75th Division at Suafir esh Sharqiye. A critical situation created by the strong Ottoman attacking forces had been controlled by the coolness and steadiness of the troops, especially the machine-gun squadrons of the 5th Mounted and the 4th Light Horse Brigades. The Australian Mounted Division suffered about 50 casualties mainly from the 5th Mounted Brigade.|$|E
5|$|Though the Earl {{had come}} out as homosexual, on 14 September 1984 he married Francesca Fisher, then 20, the day before his 30th birthday. In sharp {{contrast}} to the Earl, Fisher was a teetotaler and a vegetarian, and he hoped she would be a calming influence on his life. He also wanted to give up drug use and homosexuality and produce an heir. His father refused to attend the wedding, going as far as to place an advertisement in The Times that he had a prior engagement. The marriage lasted for three years, but quickly fell apart after he started freebasing cocaine and using rent boys. During the marriage, the Earl accidentally drove a car <b>half</b> <b>way</b> over a cliff while Francesca was a passenger. They had no children. He later formed a close friendship with James Whitby, who became a companion for most of the remainder of his life.|$|E
