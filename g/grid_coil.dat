The production of ultra-short electromagnetic waves by the retarding field method is analyzed. It is found that to generate oscillations of {{very short wave}} lengths, it is more effective {{to reduce the size}} of the electrodes of the vacuum tube and to design the tubes to oscillate higher orders than to increase the grid potential. Experiments were made with the Pliotron FP- 126 tubes as retarding field oscillators. These tubes generated strong normal and higher order oscillations. The wave length of the normal oscillations differed considerably from the values calculated from the Barkhausen and Scheibe equations. For the higher order oscillations, the observed wave lengths were approximately equal to values calculated according to Potapenko’s formula: [ [...] . ]. It was found that the predominating higher order oscillations were generated by the <b>grid</b> <b>coil</b> at its natural frequency. Its wave length agrees with that calculated from its dimensions. Tubes with plate diameters as small as 0. 05 cm. were made. They generated normal as well as higher order oscillations. They were designed so that the grid had a natural wave length of about 1 cm. The grid potentials calculated agree fairly well with the values observed. The energy of oscillations with these tubes was exceedingly small. The wave length of 1 cm. is about the shortest limit that can be obtained by the retarding field method...|$|E

The Meissner Signal Shifter used plug-in <b>grid</b> <b>coils</b> wound for amateur radio frequencies. Later on, the station began using Collins 30K transmitter rated for about 300 watts. Since the transmitter only covered 3.5 mHz and higher, it {{a new set of}} plug-in coils with the aid of Schneider's Millen grid dip meter. In 1976, WJDI received a warning from the FCC for running a pirate station. In 1977, when Schneider moved to Arizona to work for Motorola Research on the Voyager II project, WJDI ceased its operations.|$|R
50|$|Flat-plate collectors, {{developed}} by Hottel and Whillier in the 1950s, {{are the most}} common type. They consist of (1) a dark flat-plate absorber, (2) a transparent cover that reduces heat losses, (3) a heat-transport fluid (air, antifreeze or water) to remove heat from the absorber, and (4) a heat insulating backing. The absorber consists of a thin absorber sheet (of thermally stable polymers, aluminum, steel or copper, to which a matte black or selective coating is applied) often backed by a <b>grid</b> or <b>coil</b> of fluid tubing placed in an insulated casing with a glass or polycarbonate cover. In water heat panels, fluid is usually circulated through tubing to transfer heat from the absorber to an insulated water tank. This may be achieved directly or through a heat exchanger.|$|R
40|$|The living {{spermatozoa}} of the flatworm Mesostoma georgianum have a sperm body about 100 μ {{long and}} 0. 5 μ wide, and two motile free flagella, ca. 200 μ long. In sections examined with the electron microscope, these flagella have the usual nine pairs of peripheral doublet microtubules {{and have a}} single central core unit which {{is connected to the}} A members of the doublets by spokelike structures. There are also short connections between the doublets and the flagellar membrane. In material negatively stained with phosphotungstic acid, the doublet microtubules seem to have very different elastic properties than the core; they tend to fall on the copper <b>grids</b> in <b>coils</b> of rather uniform diameter (2 - 4 μ), while the core is much more rigid and is often found extending alone, along a relatively straight course, for very long distances (up to 73 μ). After negative staining, the core has a striking appearance with a dense center around which are wound two hollow structures in a double helix of 45 ° pitch. The center-to-center distance of each gyre is approximately 650 Å, and the hollow structures are ca. 180 Å in diameter...|$|R
40|$|Abstract—Different {{approaches}} for heating of stirred tanks, coils and jackets, are investigated using {{computational fluid dynamics}} (CFD). A time-dependant sliding mesh approach is applied to simulate the flow in both conditions. The investigations are carried out under the turbulent flow conditions for a Rushton impeller and heating elements are considered isothermal. The flow behavior and temperature distribution are studied for each case and heat transfer coefficient is calculated. Results show different velocity profiles for each case. Unsteady temperature distribution is not similar for different cases. In {{the case of the}} coiled stirred vessel more uniform temperature and higher heat transfer coefficient is resulted. Keywords—CFD, Coil & Jacket, Heat transfer, Stirred tank. experimental data was employed as boundary conditions at the surface of impeller, which is named as Impeller “Boundary Condition”. In the middle of 90 ’s, fully predictive methods such as Sliding Mesh (SM), Inner-Outer Method (IO), and Multiple Reference Frame (MRF) were developed, which provided simulation of impeller without experimental data. A. Simulation Geometry For modeling the geometry and generating grids, Gambit preprocessor is applied. An unstructured tetrahedral grid is used in both cases. The number of <b>grids</b> in <b>coiled</b> stirred tank is 344740 and in jacketed one is 300967. The studied model is a stirred tank with a Rushton impeller.

40|$|A {{mathematical}} model is presented that permits {{to simulate the}} effect of the cooling coils of the pool upper section on the reactor thermal-hydraulic behaviour of Ghana research reactor- 1. The model is based on a lumped parameter description solved numerically using Matlab/Simulink tool which is a commercial software package with the capability of modelling dynamical and control systems. The model incorporates fuel <b>grids</b> and cooling <b>coil</b> models as well as radiating energy from the clad. In this model, the reactor tank and the pool is divided into three sections. The model predictions are qualified by comparing the results with experimental data. The effect of cooling the upper section of the pool on reactor thermal-hydraulic parameters using the cooling coil is presented and discussed. It was observed that all maximum values of the reactor thermalhydraulic parameters decrease when the cooling coil power is increased. Good agreement is found between the model predictions and the experimental results...|$|R
40|$|Internet-of-things (IoT) {{architectures}} connecting {{a massive}} number of heterogeneous devices need energy efficient, low hardware complexity, low cost, simple and secure mechanisms to realize communication among devices. One {{of the emerging}} schemes is to realize simultaneous wireless information and power transfer (SWIPT) in an energy harvesting network. Radio frequency (RF) solutions require special hardware and modulation methods for RF to direct current (DC) conversion and optimized operation to achieve SWIPT which are currently in an immature phase. On the other hand, magneto-inductive (MI) communication transceivers are intrinsically energy harvesting with potential for SWIPT in an efficient manner. In this article, novel modulation and demodulation mechanisms are presented in a combined framework with multiple-access channel (MAC) communication and wireless power transmission. The network topology of power transmitting active coils in a transceiver composed of a <b>grid</b> of <b>coils</b> is changed {{as a novel method}} to transmit information. Practical demodulation schemes are formulated and numerically simulated for two-user MAC topology of small size coils. The transceivers are suitable to attach to everyday objects to realize reliable local area network (LAN) communication performances with tens of meters communication ranges. The designed scheme is promising for future IoT applications requiring SWIPT with energy efficient, low cost, low power and low hardware complexity solutions.

40|$|Abstract. The RFX-mod reverse field pinch (RFP) {{experiment}} applies {{active control}} on the MHD instabilities by acting on the magnetic field configuration at the boundary. These studies aim at acquiring expertise on the control of MHD modes that is also relevant for high beta discharges in tokamaks. To control the MHD activity, 192 saddle coils are installed, covering the entire torus surface. A large number of field and current measurements are acquired and processed in real-time (3 x 192 = 576 channels). Excellent results have been achieved by exploiting the real-time MHD mode control system, especially on MHD mode suppression at the boundary, toroidal loop voltage reduction, particle and energy time increase and duration of the plasma discharge. The paper discusses the technological enhancement developed {{in the last two}} years. Two new techniques have been introduced recently. The first one is referred to as Clean Mode Control (CMC). It consists in the correction of the aliasing, due to the sidebands produced by the discrete <b>grid</b> of <b>coils,</b> which determines a systematic error on the Fourier analysis of the measurements. As the CMC correction requires the simultaneous availability in the same real-time station of all acquired channels, a significant upgrade of the architecture of the real-time feedback system was necessary. The second technique consists in the introduction of a Multiple Input Multiple Output (MIMO) approach to substitute the Single Input Single Output model used so far, whose dynamic behaviour is not satisfactory. The MIMO approach relies on a full electromagnetic model of the coil and sensor system in the presence of passive structures. The MIMO controller has been developed following the concept of model decoupling. To compute the new algorithms without exceeding the real-time constraints, faster CPUs have been introduced and the data throughput in the real-time network has been optimized. 1...|$|R
40|$|Located {{within the}} {{cultural}} {{centre of the}} city, alongside the grand Plaza Mayor, the Casa de la Panadería, the City Hall complex {{is one of the}} capital’s most symbolically important new projects. It expresses the transparency of the democratic process and demonstrates the potential for a sustainable democratic forum; with a commitment to public accessibility; a sensitivity to history; and a rigorous environmental agenda. Emphasising values of clarity and precision, the glazed structure is a new landmark for Madrid, and a symbol of the vigour of the Spanish democracy. A simple palette of materials and straightforward detailing reinforce the direct character of the architecture. Structure {{played a major role in}} creating an efficient and integrated network of systems encouraging multiple public entries. A diagrid construction supports the west facing façade, and the skin is composed of banded, triple-glazed triangular panels, with fritting and solar blinds. Heritage buildings on adjacent streets envelop the building and tie the site to the city grid and Madrid’s history. The spaces in-between the three primary drums, are open and a part of the urban streetscape adjoining the building. The series of elliptical ring overpasses linking the elevated levels, unifies the space. At the top floor, there are balconies terraces overlooking the city, which can be used for public exhibitions and events. The cafeteria in the atrium is also open to the public and the assembly chamber on the second level, is surrounded by a tiered public gallery. The distorted concavity of the glass sheet cladding over the chamber, opens the building to the canal, and at night, lights reflect off the water creating rippled undulating patterns across the building’s façade. Light, <b>gridded</b> glass and <b>coiled</b> aluminium work together dynamically to create a structure that, although unfamiliar and daring, invites exploration and enables social interaction.
