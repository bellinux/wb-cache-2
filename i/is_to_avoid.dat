5|$|Solitary animals {{defend a}} {{territory}} and avoid social {{interactions with the}} members of its species, except during breeding season. This <b>is</b> <b>to</b> <b>avoid</b> resource competition, as two individuals of the same species would occupy the same niche, and to prevent depletion of food. A solitary animal, while foraging, can also be less conspicuous to predators or prey.|$|E
5|$|Coughlan {{has been}} criticized for {{allowing}} the doctrine of proportionality to affect administrative law, as the court has to judge the merits of a case when granting a review on grounds of substantive legitimate expectation and, in a sense, usurp the discretion of the executive branch of government. This is arguably inconsistent with the court's traditional role in judicial review which <b>is</b> <b>to</b> <b>avoid</b> examining the merits of administrative decisions and only scrutinize them for compliance with the law.|$|E
5|$|The {{reason for}} the {{presence}} of these non canonical bases in DNA is not known. It seems likely that {{at least part of the}} {{reason for the}}ir presence in bacterial viruses (phages) <b>is</b> <b>to</b> <b>avoid</b> the restriction enzymes present in bacteria. This enzyme system acts at least in part as a molecular immune system protecting bacteria from infection by viruses.|$|E

5|$|Prevention of {{schizophrenia}} is difficult {{as there are}} no reliable markers for the later development of the disorder. There is tentative evidence for the effectiveness of early interventions to prevent schizophrenia. While {{there is some evidence}} that early intervention in those with a psychotic episode may improve short-term outcomes, there is little benefit from these measures after five years. Attempting to prevent schizophrenia in the prodrome phase is of uncertain benefit and therefore as of 2009 is not recommended. Cognitive behavioral therapy may reduce the risk of psychosis in those at high risk after a year and is recommended in this group, by the National Institute for Health and Care Excellence (NICE). Another preventative measure <b>is</b> <b>to</b> <b>avoid</b> drugs that have been associated with development of the disorder, including cannabis, cocaine, and amphetamines.|$|E

50|$|Loss and {{avoidance}} is the Core Drive that motivates us <b>to</b> <b>avoid</b> something negative from happening. On a small scale, it could <b>be</b> <b>to</b> <b>avoid</b> losing previous work or changing one's behaviour. On a larger scale, it could <b>be</b> <b>to</b> <b>avoid</b> admitting that everything you did up <b>to</b> this point <b>was</b> useless {{because you are}} now quitting. Opportunities that are fading away have a strong utilization of this Core Drive, because people feel if they didn't act immediately, they would lose the opportunity to act forever ("special offer for a limited time only!").|$|R
25|$|In western countries, {{instructions}} {{have been}} put up in some public toilets on the correct use of a sitting-style toilet. This <b>is</b> <b>to</b> <b>avoid</b> breaking the toilet or seat if someone attempts to squat on the edges.|$|E
25|$|A {{recommended}} {{prevention measure}} for infant botulism <b>is</b> <b>to</b> <b>avoid</b> giving honey to infants less than 12 months of age, as botulinum spores are often present. In older {{children and adults}} the normal intestinal bacteria suppress development of C. botulinum.|$|E
25|$|Another {{challenge}} for pilots who {{are forced to}} fly an aircraft without functioning control surfaces <b>is</b> <b>to</b> <b>avoid</b> the phugoid instability mode (a cycle in which the aircraft repeatedly climbs and then dives), which requires careful use of the throttle.|$|E

25|$|Zoroastrian {{exposure}} of the dead is first attested in the mid-5th century BCE Histories of Herodotus, {{but the use of}} towers is first documented in the early 9th century.

25|$|The {{literature}} {{indicates that}} diving during pregnancy does {{increase the risk}} to the fetus, but to an uncertain extent. As diving is an avoidable risk for most women, the prudent choice <b>is</b> <b>to</b> <b>avoid</b> diving while pregnant. However, if diving is done before pregnancy is recognised, there is generally no indication for concern.|$|E
25|$|While many mooring buoys are privately owned, {{some are}} {{available}} for public use.
