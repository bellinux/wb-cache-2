5|$|Calostoma cinnabarinum {{was thought}} to be saprotrophic, and has been {{described}} in this manner in both scholarly and popular discussions of the species. However, this classification was the result of its taxonomic history and comparisons with saprotrophic fungi that are not closely related. After its assignment to the Sclerodermatineae, a suborder whose members are ectomycorrhizal, its ecological role came into question. In 2007, Andrew Wilson and David Hibbett of Clark University and Eric Hobbie of the University of New Hampshire employed isotopic labeling, DNA sequencing, and morphological analysis to determine that this species is also ectomycorrhizal. Like all mycorrhizal fungi, C.cinnabarinum establishes a mutualistic relationship with the roots of trees, allowing the fungus to exchange minerals and amino acids extracted from the soil for <b>fixed</b> <b>carbon</b> from the host. The subterranean hyphae of the fungus grow a sheath of tissue around the rootlets of the tree. This association is especially beneficial to the host, as the fungus produces enzymes that mineralize organic compounds and facilitate the transfer of nutrients to the tree. The only host trees identified for C.cinnabarinus are Quercus oaks, although related members of Calostoma have been observed to associate with other trees in the Fagaceae family, such as beech.|$|E
25|$|The <b>fixed</b> <b>carbon</b> {{content of}} the coal is the carbon found in the {{material}} which is left after volatile materials are driven off.

When peat forest burnt, a lot of carbon emissions are acumulated in the atmosphere, which stimulate global warming. This study aims to estimate biomass and <b>fix</b> <b>carbon</b> contain in ex-burned merang peat forest and make models between biomass and <b>fix</b> <b>carbon</b> of various tree component (stems, branches, twigs and leaves) and also to calculate <b>fix</b> <b>carbon</b> and biomass stock in burned merang peat forest. The results show that biomass and <b>fix</b> <b>carbon</b> in burned merang peat forest can be estimated using allometric equation models: Wtotal = 0. 153108 D 2, 40 and Ctotal = 0, 0302 D 2, 35. <b>Fix</b> <b>carbon</b> stock in the trees very related to biomass and it can be calculated using formula Ctotal = 0. 188799 W 0, 980.

This system of replicating clays and their metabolic phenotype then {{evolved into the}} sulfide rich region of the hotspring acquiring the ability to fix nitrogen. Finally phosphate was incorporated into the evolving system which allowed the synthesis of nucleotides and phospholipids. If biosynthesis recapitulates biopoiesis, then the synthesis of amino acids preceded the synthesis of the purine and pyrimidine bases. Furthermore the polymerization of the amino acid thioesters into polypeptides preceded the directed polymerization of amino acid esters by polynucleotides.|$|E
25|$|Coke {{is a solid}} {{carbonaceous}} residue derived from coking coal (a low-ash, low-sulfur bituminous coal, also known as metallurgical coal), which is used in manufacturing steel and other iron products. Coke is made from coking coal by baking in an oven without oxygen at temperatures as high as 1,000°C (1,832°F), driving off the volatile constituents and fusing together the <b>fixed</b> <b>carbon</b> and residual ash. Metallurgical coke {{is used as a}} fuel and as a reducing agent in smelting iron ore in a blast furnace. The result is pig iron, and is too rich in dissolved carbon, so it must be treated further to make steel.|$|E

500|$|Boletus edulis is mycorrhizal—it is in a mutualistic {{relationship}} with the roots of plants (hosts), in which the fungus exchanges nitrogen and other nutrients extracted from the environment for <b>fixed</b> <b>carbon</b> from the host. Other benefits for the plant are evident: {{in the case of}} the Chinese chestnut, the formation of mycorrhizae with B.edulis increases the ability of plant seedlings to resist water stress, and increases leaf succulence, leaf area, and water-holding ability. The fungus forms a sheath of tissue around terminal, nutrient-absorbing root tips, often inducing a high degree of branching in the tips of the host, and penetrating into the root tissue, forming, to some mycologists, the defining feature of ectomycorrhizal relationships, a hartig net. [...] The ectomycorrhizal fungi are then able to exchange nutrients with the plant, effectively expanding the root system of the host plant to the furthest reaches of the symbiont fungi. Compatible hosts may belong to multiple families of vascular plants that are widely distributed throughout the Northern Hemisphere; according to one 1995 estimate, there are at least 30 host plant species distributed over more than 15 genera. Examples of mycorrhizal associates include Chinese red pine, Mexican weeping pine, Scots pine, Norway spruce, Coast Douglas-fir, mountain pine, and Virginia pine. The fungus has also been shown to associate with gum rockrose, a pioneer early stage shrub that is adapted for growth in degraded areas, such as burned forests. These and other rockrose species are ecologically important as fungal reservoirs, maintaining an inoculum of mycorrhizal fungi for trees that appear later in the forest regrowth cycle.|$|E

The relation of δD in plant leaf waxes to δ13C has been empirically measured and results in a negative correlation of δD to water use efficiency. This can be explained in part by lower water use efficiency being associated with higher transpiration rates. Transpiration exhibits a normal isotope effect, causing enrichment of deuterium in plant leaf water and therefore enrichment of leaf waxes.|$|E
2500|$|A {{group of}} mostly desert plants called [...] "CAM" [...] plants (Crassulacean acid metabolism, after the family Crassulaceae, which {{includes}} the species in which the CAM process was first discovered) open their stomata at night (when water evaporates more slowly from leaves for a given degree of stomatal opening), use PEPcarboxylase to fix carbon dioxide and store the products in large vacuoles. The following day, they close their stomata and release the carbon dioxide fixed the previous night into the presence of RuBisCO. This saturates RuBisCO with carbon dioxide, allowing minimal photorespiration. This approach, however, is severely limited by the capacity to store <b>fixed</b> <b>carbon</b> in the vacuoles, so it is preferable only when water is severely limiting.|$|E
