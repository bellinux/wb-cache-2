5000|$|Voice <b>intercept</b> <b>operators,</b> who {{are usually}} {{linguists}} with MOS 98G (plus a four character suffix (pLnn) to indicate proficiency level and language code), morse code high speed <b>intercept</b> <b>operators</b> ("Ditty Boppers", MOS 058 and later [...] "Hogs" [...] for their 05H designation), non-morse (teletype and voice) <b>intercept</b> <b>operators</b> (05K), communications security/signal security specialists (05G, [...] "Goofies") direction-finding equipment operators ("Duffys" [...] for their 05D designation), computer system operators (74E) who operated equipment at the NSA headquarters {{and out in}} the field; A K3 attached to the primary MOS meant the person was qualified to operate Jamming equipment. There was an additional MOS known as a 93G-Microbarograph specialist. The last class for this MOS was taught at Ft. Devens 1968-1969.|$|R
50|$|By 6 July 1942 the <b>intercept</b> <b>operator</b> {{numbers at}} Central Bureau had {{increased}} {{from six to}} twenty nine.|$|R
50|$|Before ordination, Richardson {{served in}} the Air Force as an enlisted man, working as a Russian {{interpreter}} and <b>intercept</b> <b>operator.</b>|$|R
50|$|For each message, {{the first}} line is {{provided}} by the <b>intercept</b> <b>operator,</b> giving call signs, frequency, time, and reference number. The rest of the message is a transcript of the Morse code transmission.|$|R
50|$|In the past, {{the call}} would be {{forwarded}} to an <b>intercept</b> <b>operator</b> after usually two {{readings of the}} message; today, however, this procedure is not observed, and a fast busy signal follows the second reading of the message instead.|$|R
50|$|After the War {{he became}} Chief of Staff for I (BR) Corps in 1959 and Director of Military Intelligence in June 1962, in which {{capacity}} {{he dealt with}} the defection of the <b>intercept</b> <b>operator</b> Brian Patchett, before retiring in 1965.|$|R
5000|$|Individual airmen—stationed at {{locations}} {{scattered across}} the globe, ranging from Northeast Cape Air Force Station, Alaska to Pacific Islands to The Far East to Mediterranean Countries to The Middle East to Western Europe to North Africa—did a variety of jobs, {{almost all of them}} related to listening to and interpreting Eastern Bloc, Communist Chinese, and North Vietnamese military communications. Some airmen were linguists who listened to voice communications. Others—known as morse <b>intercept</b> <b>operators,</b> or [...] "ditty-boppers"—monitored Soviet and other nations' military Morse code broadcasts. Others, such as non-morse <b>intercept</b> <b>operators,</b> were engaged in monitoring other types of radio signals such as single and multi-channel radio printer signals and facsimile transmissions. All communications were reviewed and interpreted by analysts.|$|R
50|$|Before automation, {{calls to}} a {{disconnected}} or non-working number would be diverted to an <b>intercept</b> <b>operator.</b> The operator would ask what number the subscriber {{was attempting to}} call, determine {{the reason for the}} intercept and relay the information to the calling party.|$|R
50|$|Patchett was an <b>intercept</b> <b>operator</b> at RAF Gatow in West Berlin, {{and as a}} {{consequence}} he had a comprehensive knowledge of the deployment of British signals units in West Germany. Patchett took part in propaganda broadcasts following his defection, in which he condemned British espionage.|$|R
5000|$|Telecommunications Center Specialist (teletype) - Tape Ape - (72B w/D1 designator), Radio Teletype (RTTY) w/Morse Code {{qualifier}} (05C), Cryptanalysis/Cryptanalytic Technician (crippies),(98B), communications traffic analysts (98C), voice <b>intercept</b> <b>operators</b> (Monterey-Marys)(98G) non-communications intercept/analysts (98J - {{radar and}} telemetry) electronic cryptographic maintenance technicians(32F-G, and 33S), and Specialized Teletypewriter Equipment Repairman (31J B3).|$|R
50|$|In August 1939, {{shortly before}} the {{outbreak}} of war with Germany, the FECB moved to Singapore on HMS Birmingham for fear of Japanese attack. A skeleton staff of a codebreaker (Alf Bennett) and four <b>intercept</b> <b>operators</b> were left at Hong Kong, and they were captured by the Japanese on Christmas Day 1941.|$|R
50|$|After preministerial {{college in}} Milwaukee and Fort Wayne, Indiana he {{enlisted in the}} U.S. Air Force, where he trained as a {{language}} specialist at Indiana University and a radio <b>intercept</b> <b>operator</b> at Goodfellow AFB, Texas. Afterwards, he completed a two-year tour at Misawa Air Base and later at Yokota Air Base in Japan, where he was first exposed to the teachings of Eckankar.|$|R
5000|$|Jubeck {{was born}} to parents of Czech origin in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania in 1936. He served with the United States Air Force, North Sea, West Germany with the Air Force Security Service as a Radio <b>Intercept</b> <b>Operator</b> in the 1950s. Jubeck went to Ball State University in Muncie, Indiana, on a {{football}} scholarship attaining Bachelor of Arts; Physical Education and Social Science.|$|R
50|$|The {{purpose of}} Direction Finding units was to locate enemy {{stations}} {{which had been}} identified and where wireless interception was occurring. The site chosen by the D/F unit had to be favourable for good radio reception and minimum magnetic declination. Each unit included two operators, one of whom received messages from other D/F teems, while the second acted as <b>intercept</b> <b>operator,</b> relaying <b>intercepts</b> back to the NAAS.|$|R
25|$|Born in Berlin, New Hampshire, {{the son of}} Leon and Louise Durant, {{he entered}} the U.S. Army in August 1979. Following basic training, he {{attended}} the Defense Language Institute, and was then assigned to the 470th Military Intelligence Group at Fort Clayton in Panama as a Spanish voice <b>intercept</b> <b>operator.</b> He then completed helicopter flight training at Fort Rucker, Alabama. During flight school, he flew the TH-55 trainer and UH-1 helicopters.|$|R
50|$|Country music icon Johnny Cash was a USAFSS {{member and}} Morse code <b>intercept</b> <b>operator</b> {{stationed}} in Germany {{in the early}} 1950s. Adrian Cronauer was an Air Force DJ at AFRTS in 1964 at the USAFSS installation, Iraklion Air Station, Crete, Greece. Cronauer, unlike Cash, was in a radio-TV support squadron, attached to the security service operation. Cronauer's life was depicted by Robin Williams in the film Good Morning, Vietnam.|$|R
50|$|A United States Air Force Security Service {{detachment}} of the 6981st Radio Group Mobile (RGM), Elmendorf Air Force Base, was co-located on the site. The detachment's Morse code <b>intercept</b> <b>operators</b> and Russian language linguists were tasked with the surveillance and collection of voice and electronic signals, to be forwarded to the National Security Agency for intelligence analysis. A direction finding receiver was also manned, both for surveillance and search and rescue.|$|R
2500|$|The F-102, a supersonic, high {{altitude}} fighter interceptor designed to intercept Soviet bombers {{was given the}} mission of intercepting, identifying and, if necessary, destroying small aircraft, flying from tree top level to 2000ft at speeds less than the final approach landing speed of the F-102. [...] The TF-102, employing two pilots with one acting solely as radar <b>intercept</b> <b>operator,</b> {{was considered to be}} safer and more efficient as a low altitude interceptor.|$|R

25|$|In {{the middle}} 20th century in North America when a call {{could not be}} completed, for example because the phone number was not assigned, had been disconnected, or was {{experiencing}} technical difficulties, the call was routed to an <b>intercept</b> <b>operator</b> who informed the caller. In the 1970s this service was converted to Automatic Intercept Systems which automatically choose and present an appropriate intercept message. Disconnected numbers are reassigned to new users after the rate of calls to them declines.|$|R
5000|$|In 1940, Barnes {{released}} his first solo recording, [...] "I'm Forever Blowing Bubbles" [...] and [...] "I Can't Believe That You're in Love with Me" [...] on Okeh Records. He was drafted in 1942 {{and served with}} the U.S. Army as an <b>intercept</b> <b>operator</b> in the Pentagon. After his discharge in 1946, he formed the George Barnes Octet and was given a fifteen-minute radio program on the ABC network. On January 17, 1947, he married Evelyn Lorraine Triplett in Chicago.|$|R
5000|$|The Germans overcame {{pockets of}} {{resistance}} throughout the day, gaining {{control of the}} northern bridge approaches and permitting reinforcements to cross the span and reinforce units further south near Nijmegen. The remaining British troops continued to fight on, some with just fighting knives but by early Thursday morning almost all had been taken prisoner. The last radio message broadcast from the bridge - [...] "Out of ammo, God save the King" [...] - was heard only by German radio <b>intercept</b> <b>operators.</b>|$|R
5000|$|Alexander {{headed the}} Army Intelligence and Security Command, where in 2001 {{he was in}} charge of 10,700 spies and eavesdroppers worldwide. In the words of James Bamford who wrote his {{biography}} for Wired, [...] "Alexander and the rest of the American intelligence community suffered a devastating defeat when they were surprised by the attacks on 9/11." [...] Alexander's reaction was to order his <b>intercept</b> <b>operators</b> to begin to monitor the email and phone calls of American citizens who were unrelated to terrorist threats, including the personal calls of journalists.|$|R
25|$|In 1934 the Gold Star {{was a bit}} of {{a veteran}} Q-Ship dealing with {{communications}} intelligence as she moved from port to port and while in port. As a station ship she was assigned to monitor 1) Internal Japanese Fleet frequencies 2) Frequencies measurements and DF or direction finder azimuths. She had three <b>intercept</b> <b>operators</b> and one chief radioman supervised by an officer. This all started in 1933 during the reconstruction of the Japanese fleet by Tokyo. The Gold Star along with ground stations in Guam, Olongapo and Beijing provided significant intelligence before the Japanese attack on Pearl Harbor on December 7, 1941.|$|R

5000|$|Born in Bellingham, Washington to Mildred and Volney Robison, Ed Robison is {{the middle}} of three siblings. The family {{eventually}} moved to Los Angeles where Robison spent {{the majority of his}} childhood. After graduating from high school, he held several jobs, including working for the Los Angeles County Superior Court. When the Korean War broke out in 1950, he enlisted in the United States Air Force. A year later Robison went to Korea where he served as a radio <b>intercept</b> <b>operator.</b> Upon discharge in 1954, Robison returned to Southern California and {{began his career as a}} computer programmer for aerospace manufacturer Rockwell International. At the same time, he attended UCLA [...] where he studied writing under Leonardo Bercovici, the noted screenwriter and educator.|$|R
50|$|Experienced <b>intercept</b> Kana <b>operators</b> from a Royal Australian Air Force unit at Townsville were {{assigned}} to the new Central Bureau. The RAAF at the time had a number of Kana operators being trained and were about to train a further 13 WAAAF personnel. (Katakana is one of the syllabic forms of written Japanese).|$|R
5000|$|In 1968, Sieben {{joined the}} United States Army Reserve, {{where he served}} seven years with the Military Intelligence Branch working as a Morse code <b>intercept</b> <b>operator</b> and platoon leader. He then {{received}} a direct commission in the Minnesota Air National Guard in April 1975. He served in the Judge Advocate General's Corps for the 133rd Airlift Wing, 148th Fighter Wing and Headquarters Minnesota Air National Guard. In 1990, he was appointed as the state judge advocate for the Minnesota National Guard. In 1997 {{he was promoted to}} brigadier general and assistant adjutant general in the Minnesota Air National Guard, and later as acting adjutant general for the State of Minnesota. He was promoted to major general in 2003. After retiring from the military, Sieben became a civilian aide to the Secretary of the Army for Minnesota on October 27, 2006.http://www.odcmp.org/0107/default.asp?page=SIEBEN ...|$|R
50|$|On July 11 at {{approximately}} 21:45, the signals intelligence <b>intercept</b> <b>operator</b> in Eilat reported two Egyptian missile boats {{were about to}} sortie. The Israeli torpedo boats picked up a target on radar shortly thereafter. The Egyptians were about 15 miles from the MTBs and 12 miles from Eilat, moving east at 15 kn. The Israelis marked a course to intercept. Eilat closed from the north, Aya and Daya from the east. The Egyptian vessels, later identified as P 6-class torpedo boats, discovered the Israeli MTBs approaching at full speed and commenced fire. The Israelis returned fire with Bofors and Oerlikons. The initial run scored no hits but the Egyptian MTBs dispersed. The separation enabled Eilat to close one and the two MTBs the other. Twenty minutes later, both P 6s were ablaze. The fire caused their torpedoes to explode. There were no Israeli losses and no known Egyptian survivors.|$|R
50|$|The {{personnel}} of each intercept station {{consisted of}} one officer, who was Chief of the station, one radio mechanic, eighteen or twenty Non-commissioned officers and {{six or eight}} civilian employees used as clerks, administrators, interpreters and couriers. In 1933, five technicians {{were added to the}} personnel. Major Feichtner of the Luftwaffe (German Air Force), Air Signals Regiment 352 (LN Regiment 352), stated under interrogation that these units had no tables of organization (Order of battle), their personnel being detached from signal battalions and signal platoons of the Infantry and Cavalry. Not until 1932 did the Fixed Intercept Stations (German:Feste Horchstelle) (Abbr. Feste) receive their tables of organization. Only the finest and most experienced radio operators of the signal battalions and platoons were accepted as <b>intercept</b> <b>operators.</b> The chief of an intercept station, by having the direct support of the Reichswehr Ministry, was certain always to receive the best qualified personnel.|$|R
50|$|The first kill {{aided by}} GCI {{did not come}} until December 6. During their tour in the Pacific, the {{squadron}} operated out of fields in the Russell Islands, Vella Lavella and Bougainville. They accounted for 12 enemy planes shot down by 5 different crews, all at night, {{with a loss of}} 6 of their own aircraft and 17 crew members, none of them a result of enemy fire.The squadron returned to MCAS Cherry Point on September 1, 1944 and was quickly deactivated only to be reactivated a short time later on October 13 at Marine Corps Auxiliary Airfield Kinston (MCAAF Kinston), North Carolina and reassigned to MAG-53, 9th Marine Aircraft Wing. A short time later the squadron moved to Marine Corps Air Station Eagle Mountain Lake near Fort Worth, Texas to operate as a training squadron for replacement pilots and ground control <b>intercept</b> <b>operators</b> being sent overseas.|$|R
5000|$|The USAFSS had {{two major}} areas of operations: {{ground-based}} and airborne. Ground-based units were {{scattered throughout the}} globe and collected information from fixed sites with large antenna arrays. Airborne units flew from bases around the world, skirting sensitive areas and collecting data {{in a variety of}} aircraft, including C-47s, RB-47s C-130s, EC-121s, and RC-135s. Some airborne units were associated with the strategic reconnaissance units of Strategic Air Command, and flew aboard SAC (and non-SAC) reconnaissance flights to collect data from shorter range communication systems and other types of signals. A primary job of USAFSS airborne linguists and Morse <b>Intercept</b> <b>Operators</b> aboard SAC reconnaissance aircraft was to provide self-protection early warning of impending fighter or missile response by a target nation's air defense system. Of equal value were the [...] "ferret missions" [...] flown into Soviet Bloc countries to gather intel on their air defense systems.|$|R
50|$|On {{the evening}} of November 23, 1953, Air Defense Command Ground <b>Intercept</b> radar <b>operators</b> at Sault Ste. Marie, Michigan {{identified}} an unusual target near the Soo Locks. An F-89C Scorpion jet from Kinross Air Force Base was scrambled to investigate the radar return; the Scorpion was piloted by First Lieutenant Moncla with Second Lieutenant Robert L. Wilson acting as the Scorpion's radar operator.|$|R
