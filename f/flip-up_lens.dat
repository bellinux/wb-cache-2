50|$|A keychain {{camera is}} a very small and {{inexpensive}} digital camera. Keychain cameras typically have a plastic <b>lens,</b> <b>flip-up</b> viewfinder and, as the name implies, a keyring. Due to their low cost, they are frequently used as promotional giveaways, sometimes imprinted with the name of a company or product. In the 20th century, the same term was used to refer to 110 film cameras of similar specification, in which often the 110 film cartridge formed part of the camera body.|$|R
