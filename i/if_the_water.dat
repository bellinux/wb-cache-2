5|$|At the 500hPa level, the air {{temperature}} averages −7°C (18°F) within the tropics, but {{air in the}} tropics is normally dry at this level, giving the air room to wet-bulb, or cool as it moistens, to a more favorable temperature that can then support convection. A wetbulb temperature at 500hPa in a tropical atmosphere of −13.2°C is required to initiate convection <b>if</b> <b>the</b> <b>water</b> temperature is 26.5°C, and this temperature requirement increases or decreases proportionally by 1°C in the sea surface temperature for each 1°C change at 500hpa.|$|E

5|$|Numerous {{other birds}} can be seen, {{especially}} during the spring and autumn migration. Sand martins (Riparia riparia) arrive early and can usually be seen hawking over the water for insects in {{the second or third}} week of March. Flocks of tits (Paridae), swallows (Hirundinidae) and terns (Sternidae) can regularly be seen. Waders, such as lapwings (Vanellus vanellus), dunlin (Calidris alpina) and common snipe (Gallinago gallinago), are attracted to the muddy shores <b>if</b> <b>the</b> <b>water</b> level drops in autumn. By midwinter up to 55,000 gulls, mostly black-headed gull (Chroicocephalus ridibundus) and common gull (Larus canus), may be roosting. Good numbers of reed warblers (Acrocephalus scirpaceus) and sedge warblers (A. schoenobaenus) nest in the fringing reeds, along with grebes (Podicipedidae) and Eurasian coots (Fulica atra).|$|E
25|$|In active {{volcanic}} zones such as Yellowstone National Park, {{water may}} be heated by coming {{into contact with}} magma (molten rock). The high temperature gradient near magma may cause water to be heated enough that it boils or becomes superheated. <b>If</b> <b>the</b> <b>water</b> becomes so hot that it builds steam pressure and erupts in a jet above {{the surface of the}} Earth, it is called a geyser. <b>If</b> <b>the</b> <b>water</b> only reaches the surface in the form of steam, it is called a fumarole. <b>If</b> <b>the</b> <b>water</b> is mixed with mud and clay, it is called a mud pot.|$|E

25|$|Water in {{the tank}} is {{slightly}} pre-heated by the boiler, which reduces the loss of pressure found when cold feedwater is injected into the boiler. However, <b>if</b> <b>the</b> <b>water</b> becomes too hot, injectors lose efficiency and can fail. For this reason, the tanks often stopped short of the hotter and uninsulated smokebox.|$|E

25|$|One {{possible}} {{means of}} averting such a catastrophe {{would be to}} strengthen the lake wall, though this would take much time and money.

25|$|The {{cooling water}} used to {{condense}} the steam in the condenser returns to its source without having been changed other than having been warmed. <b>If</b> <b>the</b> <b>water</b> returns {{to a local}} water body (rather than a circulating cooling tower), it is often tempered with cool 'raw' water to prevent thermal shock when discharged into that body of water.|$|E

25|$|During operation, the boiler's {{water level}} is {{constantly}} monitored, normally via a transparent tube {{referred to as}} a sight glass, or with a gauge. Maintaining a proper water level is central to the efficient and safe operation of the boiler. <b>If</b> <b>the</b> <b>water</b> level is too high, steam production is decreased, efficiency is lost and in extreme cases, water will be carried out with the steam into the cylinders, possibly causing mechanical damage. More seriously, <b>if</b> <b>the</b> <b>water</b> level gets too low, the crown (top) and/or side sheets of the firebox may become exposed. Without sufficient water to absorb the heat of combustion, the firebox sheets may soften and melt, with the possible result of high-pressure steam being ejected with tremendous force through the firebox and into the locomotive's cab. The development of the fusible plug, a device to release pressure in conditions of excessively high temperature and low water levels was intended to protect against this occurrence.|$|E
25|$|Heavy {{water is}} 10.6% denser than {{ordinary}} water, and heavy water's physically different properties {{can be seen}} without equipment if a frozen sample is dropped into normal water, as it will sink. <b>If</b> <b>the</b> <b>water</b> is ice-cold the higher melting temperature of heavy ice can also be observed: it melts at 3.7°C, and thus does not melt in ice-cold normal water.|$|E
