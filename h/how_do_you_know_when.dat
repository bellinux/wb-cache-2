But the worms Welcome Robin got were always close to the surface, while these worms were so deep in the earth that Peter couldn't understand how it was possible for any one to know that they were there. Welcome Robin could see when he got hold of a worm, but Longbill couldn't. [...] "Even if you know there is a worm down there in the ground, <b>how</b> <b>do</b> <b>you</b> <b>know</b> <b>when</b> you've reached him?

The Indians told me he gave poor Four Eyes an awful talking to. Then there were Tristan and Iseult--two Iseults. It was very sad. But I should like to love that way. Do all the young {{men and women in the}} world do that? They do not here. They just get married. They do not seem to have time. I am English, and I will never marry an Indian--would you? That is why I have not lighted my maiden's fire. Some of the young men are bothering father to make me do it. Libash is one of them. He is a great hunter. And Mahkook comes around singing songs. He is funny. To-night, if you come by my tent after dark, you will hear him singing out in the cold. But father says I can do as I please, and so I shall not light my fire. You see, when a girl makes up her mind to get married, that is the way she lets young men know. Four Eyes always said it was a fine custom. But I noticed he never took a wife. Maybe he was too old. He did not have much hair, but I do not think he was really very old. And <b>how</b> <b>do</b> <b>you</b> <b>know</b> <b>when</b> you are in love?--like Paolo and Francesca, I mean." ...|$|E

He was appointed by Virginia Governor Douglas Wilder to the Task Force for Promotion of the Arts and by Governor George Allen to the Virginia Art and Architecture Review Board. The VCU Brand Centerproduced five Vimeo video interviews with Joseph Seipel, each addressing a different question posed to him. The questions were: 1) What's your process when you start a sculpture? 2) Do you see advertising as an art or a science? 3) Do you think creativity can be learned or are you born with it? 4) <b>How</b> <b>do</b> <b>you</b> <b>know</b> <b>when</b> a piece is finished? and 5) Who do you feel {{is the most important}} artist of the past 25 years?

How do you decide what to teach and what not to teach? <b>How</b> <b>do</b> <b>you</b> <b>know</b> <b>when</b> your students understand a concept in class?) were the more likely to be coded as “traditional” in the pre-development interviews. When asked about when {{to move on to}} a new topic, the responses ranged from an instructor-centered response from Hilary during her pre-development interview that focused on schedule and time constraints “I really can’t spend more than the…on whatever topic we are scheduled before there is just so much material that needs to be covered”. Moving along the coding spectrum, we can examine a transitional response from Tyler’s pre-development interview that included the students in the decision about when to move on “I pause when they are producing some results…So there are sort of intermediate steps along the way that I can see if they identify this rock sample correctly…” Unlike Hilary’s response, Tyler based his decision to move on partly on the students. An example of a reformed, student-centered reply can be read in Ellen’s post-development interview response “In that case I might run the lecture over into the next time or have a couple of slides, because that’s the point is to get it and the that obviously helps me next time to redesign the lecture”. Ellen is not only considering whether or not students “get” the information but also verbalized the option of revisiting concepts and redesigning future lessons based on her current students’ experiences with the content.|$|E

This work proposes an innovative World Wide Web agent that uses a model of collaboration that leverages the natural incentives for individual users to easily provide for collaborative work. KEYWORDS: computer-supported cooperative work, CSCW, social filtering, collaboration, World Wide Web INTRODUCTION Collaborative efforts to discover Internet resources, such as interesting Web pages, require work by users. Unfortunately, users often will not do the extra, altruistic work, leading to adoption failures for social filtering systems. In the work described below, individuals engage in resource discovery for themselves. Without extra work, other individuals can use that effort. We do this by using a naturally reoccurring problem with the Web.

40|$|About the book: Change is {{the stock}} in trade of historians. If we have no concept of change, and no sense of the past as {{different}} from the present, then consequently we cannot have an historical sense in the deepest meaning of the term. However, historians rarely discuss change per se in very explicit terms. What constitutes change? <b>How</b> <b>do</b> <b>you</b> <b>know</b> <b>when</b> change has happened? How do you define or measure it? Are there different kinds of change? These {{are some of the}} issues explored in this book. Ireland has been in a process of extremely rapid cultural change in recent decades - whether in the precipitate decline in the influence of the Catholic Church or in the rapid adoption of globalised market culture. Reflecting on the general nature of such change is a prerequisite for understanding Ireland's place in a new cultural economy. This collection is based on papers presented to the 25 th biennial Irish Conference of Historians, held at the National University of Ireland, Galway, May 2001...|$|E
