40|$|Production {{of poultry}} {{meat in the}} Republic {{and in the world}} has upward trend. This is {{primarily}} due to the highly <b>fattening</b> <b>ability,</b> reproductive short interval, dietetic properties of meat, good efficiency of conversion of feed nutrients and by independences food production of soil. Every year across the European Union is produced about 5. 9 billion broiler chickens. The subject of my bachelor´s dissertation was to develop a literature search and analysis of broiler production in the farm Čejetice Agro Ltd. Collection of input data was realised in chronological period of 3 years (2008 - 2010). The dissertation is focused on the gains of broiler chickens and the consumption of complete feed in this company...|$|E
40|$|Thirty two ram lambs were {{included}} from the on-going selection breeding programme. These lambs {{consisted of the}} Adal and Black Head Somali (16 each) and were used to study the <b>fattening</b> <b>ability</b> of the two breeds and to compare the concentrate ratio. The average initial weights and age were 14. 2 Kg and 123 days (SD = 11) respectively. The trial lasted for 97 days. Ration had highly significant affect on ADG and dressing percentage and significant effect on tail weight. Breed had no {{significant effect on the}} weights, ADG and all carcass traits. Breed ration interaction had no significant affect on all traits except on Kidney fat. Kilogramme feed consumed per kg liveweight gain for Adal and Black Head Somali fed on ration A was 6. 26 and 6. 16, and 8. 28 and 8. 65 for the two breeds on ration B respectively...|$|E
40|$|Production {{of poultry}} {{meat in the}} Republic {{and in the world}} has upward trend. This is {{primarily}} due to the highly <b>fattening</b> <b>ability,</b> reproductive short interval, dietetic properties of meat and good efficiency of conversion of feed nutrients. Every year across the European Union is produced about 9, 6 billion broiler chickens. Broiler chicknes are specialized type of chicken bred and consume for meat. In a global comparison of the largest share of the production of poultry meat is provided by the United States and countries of the European Union. Czech Republic belongs to the volume of production to less dynamically developing countries. Chicken meat is cheaper than the other kinds of meat and this has significantly increased its market share. This {{is due to the fact}} that chicken meat contains many valuable protein and its cuisine is very simple. The subject of the master thesis was to evaluate selected influences on increment of broiler chickens in the farm Agro Čejetice s. r. o. in a time sequence of five years (2008 - 2012). The thesis was focused on the index calculation and observation of the effectiveness of the fattening period during each batch and on detailed observation of growths and loss in each of the locations. Also on the consumption of KKS and link to average selling weight of chicks...|$|E
5000|$|The Dutch Belted (Lakenvelder) {{breed of}} dairy cattle is, {{according}} to records, the only belted breed of cattle tracing back {{directly to the}} original belted or [...] "canvassed" [...] cattle which were described in Switzerland and Austria. These [...] "Gurtenvieh" [...] were evidently moved by Dutch nobility from the mountain farms of canton Appenzell and County of Tyrol Mountains during or soon after the feudal period. The Dutch were very protective of their belted cattle and would generally not part with them. The cattle were highly prized for their milking and <b>fattening</b> <b>abilities.</b> The breed began to flourish in the Netherlands around 1750. Now, the cow is too rare to become a popular type of beef.|$|R
50|$|By the 1930s, {{selective}} breeding had developed its <b>fattening</b> <b>abilities,</b> and large specimens were exported to Russia and other countries, including Hungary. The breed, however, dwindled {{in the period}} after the Second World War, possibly partly due to changing farming patterns and a taste for leaner meat. The principal cause of the decline was the publication in 1955 of the Howitt report, which found breed diversity to be a handicap to the pig industry in Britain, and established a policy of concentrating production on three breeds only: the Welsh, the British Landrace and the Large White. Of the sixteen British pig breeds, four - the Cumberland, the Dorset Gold Tip, the Lincolnshire Curly Coat and the Yorkshire Blue and White - became extinct. The Lincolnshire Curly Coat {{was the last of}} these to disappear; a survey conducted in 1970 by the University of Reading found none.|$|R
40|$|The {{objective}} {{of this study was}} to find the mathematical model which gives the best results in estimation of biological growth maximum of fattening chicken. Used models were: general exponential function, von Bertalanffy´s model, logistic function and generalized logistic function. In the investigations of growth characteristics Avian 24 K, Arbor Acres and Ross 208 proveniencies of broilers were used. The results of the research show that the best data for estimation of biological maximum of chicken growth in relation to sex ensures generalized logistic function with γ = 0. 18 (asymmetric S-function) γ γ / 1) 1 () (t cbeAt f−+=. The asymptotic value of A for male chicken was, respectively: 5. 72 kg, 5. 90 kg and 4. 47 kg, and for female chicken: 4. 06 kg, 4. 75 kg, 4. 46 kg. In case of segregated <b>fattening</b> regarding gender, <b>ability</b> of live weight estimation of chicken at certain age is of great importance for optimal utilization of genetic potential and obtaining higher flock uniformity at delivery and slaughtering of the chickens...|$|R
40|$|A {{growing number}} of {{pure-bred}} herds of beef breeds began to grow a herd of cows with a dual-purpose efficiency type, farmers often use their crosses with beef breeds of cattle to increase their meat performance. The aim of this diploma work was to analyse results of <b>fattening</b> <b>ability</b> and carcass value of Czech Pied Cattle bulls (C) and their crosses with beef breeds. In evaluation selected indicators were included 907 slaughtered bulls dividing according their genotype. The software programs Microsoft Excel and Statistica {{has been used for}} processing calculations and the statistic data. An important indicator is achieved dressed carcass weight (DCW), which was highest in bulls Meat Siemental (SI) 370. 1 kg, Aberdeen Angus (G) 359. 0 kg and crossbreeds Charolais and Czech Pied Cattle (TxC) 354. 2 kg. Lowest DCW had extensive breed Highland (E) and Galloway (W) 318. 8 kg. The difference between SI and E + W was 51. 3 kg and was highly statistically significant (P ≤ 0. 001). The group of TxC and TxH and breed Piemontese (P) had the highest intensity of growth, net gain was 671. 5 g, resp. 669. 6 g for T and crosses and 652. 5 g for the breed P. The lowest average net gain was found in the breed G (531. 3 g). The highest production of first quality meat was found in the breed P (55. 6 kg), 55. 4 kg was achieved in breed SI. At least meat I. grade was found in bulls of E and W (47. 2 kg). Significant difference was found between SI and E + W at a significance level P ≤ 0. 001. Based on the results we can recommend commercial crossings Czech Pied cattle with bulls meat breed or breeding pure-bred beef breeds. It is important {{to take into account the}} specificity of each breed, its earliness and size of body frame in the choice of slaughter weight and age of fattening bulls, to avoid unwanted growth of fat in bulls, and to realize the slaughter weight trough the most intensive fattening...|$|E
