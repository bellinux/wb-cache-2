Biodegradable stockings were packed with spat and tied to parallel rows of looped ropes, supported by buoys. Young mussels grow through the stockings, anchoring themselves to the ropes with their strong byssal threads (beards). The farms are usually located in sheltered or semi-sheltered areas where there is sufficient depth of water at low tide to keep the longline <b>droppers</b> off the bottom. Recent research has been investigating offshore mussel farming in exposed areas several kilometres from shore, such as farms offshore from Napier and Opotiki.|$|E
25|$|Pregnant or {{breastfeeding}} {{women should}} consult a doctor {{before taking a}} vitamin D supplement. The FDA advised manufacturers of liquid vitamin D supplements that <b>droppers</b> accompanying these products should be clearly and accurately marked for 400 international units (1 IU is the biological equivalent of 25ng cholecalciferol/ergocalciferol). In addition, for products intended for infants, the FDA recommends the dropper hold no more than 400 IU. For infants (birth to 12 months), the tolerable upper limit (maximum amount that can be tolerated without harm) is set at 25μg/day (1,000IU). One thousand micrograms per day in infants has produced toxicity within one month. After being commissioned by the Canadian and American governments, the Institute of Medicine (IOM) , has increased the tolerable upper limit (UL) to 2,500IU per day for ages 1–3 years, 3,000IU per day for ages 4–8 years and 4,000IU per day for ages 9–71+ years (including pregnant or lactating women).|$|E

Title of Thesis Study {{of factors}} influencing dose of commercial eye drops Five commercially produced ophthalmic preparations which differed in a dispensing {{system and a}} shape of the <b>dropper</b> tip {{were used in the}} thesis. The influence of the surface tension, viscosity, osmolality, density, and dispensing angle on the weight of the drops produced by original dispensing system, consisting of <b>dropper</b> tip and <b>dropper</b> bottle, was examined.

The weight of the eye drops were compared with the drop weight of water and the model solutions 0. 01 % and 0. 02 % benzalkonium chloride. Direct correlation proportion was found out between the surface tension and the weight of the drops. When the dispensing angle decreased from 90 ř to 45 řthe weight of the drops significantly decreased too. When the <b>dropper</b> tip was wetted the effective circuit of the <b>dropper</b> tip produced larger drops increasing variability of drop weigth together with the amout of applied drugs.

The first wave of a dozen aircraft, all that the ship could launch at one time, flew off by 20:40 and the second wave of nine by 21:34. Six aircraft in each airstrike were armed with torpedoes and the remainder with bombs or flares or both to supplement the three-quarter moon. The Royal Air Force (RAF) had positioned a Short Sunderland flying boat off the harbour to search for any movement to or from the port and this was detected at 17:55 by acoustic locators and again at 20:40, alerting the defenders. The noise of the on-coming first airstrike was heard at 22:25 and the antiaircraft guns defending the port opened fire shortly afterward, as did those on the ships in the harbour. The torpedo-carrying aircraft of the first wave scored one hit on the battleship [...] and two on the recently completed battleship [...] while the two flare <b>droppers</b> bombed the oil storage depot with little effect. The four aircraft loaded with bombs set one hangar in the seaplane base on fire and hit the destroyer [...] with one bomb that failed to detonate. The destroyer , or Conte di Cavour, shot down the aircraft that put a torpedo into the latter ship, but the remaining aircraft returned to Illustrious.|$|E

Simultaneous influence of kind of the <b>dropper</b> tip (factor A), addition of methylcellulose (factor B), dispensing angle (factor C) was evaluated at large in the screening experiment. It was found that non-wetted plastic and rubber <b>dropper</b> tips produce in the upright position of the bottle (dispensing angle 90 ž) drops of water with comparable weight. In case of wetting the weights of the drops gained from the rubber <b>dropper</b> tip are significantly higher by both dispensing angles {{in accordance with the}} larger effective radius of the area where the drop is formed. From the detailed investigation of the influence of addition of methylcellulose, in the series of concentrations 0 - 0, 15 - 0, 25 - 0, 50 - 0, 75 %, on the weight of eye drops, it resulted that the addition of methylcellulose in concentration higher than 0, 25 % leads to a statistically significant increase of the weight of the drops for both kinds of <b>dropper</b> tips and both dispensing angles (90 ž also 45 ž). The change of dispensing angle from 90 ř to 45 ř led to a statistically significant decrease of the weight of the drops produced by the wetted rubber <b>dropper</b> tip and the non-wetted plastic <b>dropper</b> tip.

40|$|Dávkování viskózních očních kapek Jana Zimmelová Summary The {{objective}} of this thesis was to study the factors affecting the viscous eye drops dosage. The influence of the effective <b>dropper</b> tip perimeter, surface tension and viscosity of the liquid, and the dispensing angle upon the weight of drop was studied at four commercial ophthalmic preparations containing various viscolyzers, sodium carboxymethylcellulose, polyvinyl alcohol, polyvinylpyrrolidone, and xyloglucan, and benzalkonium chloride as an antimicrobial preservative. The weight of a drop was directly proportional to {{the diameter of the}} outer perimeter of the <b>dropper</b> tip and the liquid surface tension. No significant influence of viscosity upon the weight of drops was discovered. The weight of drops decreased when the dispensing angle was reduced from 90 ř to 45 ř except of the situation when the drop slided down the external lateral surface of the <b>dropper</b> tip and consenquently increased its weight. That was observed for the eye <b>dropper</b> Ursapharm. Minimum failures of drop dispensing with low variability of the weight of drops at both investigated dispensing angles have been found for eye <b>dropper</b> Johnson & Johnson (eye drops Visine - tired eyes). Thus, this eye <b>dropper</b> could be recommended for dispensing of viscous eye drops...|$|R
