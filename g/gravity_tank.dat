Fuel for the engines was housed in a large fuel tank mounted in the hull, which also provided accommodation for the crew when not at their stations. The flight crew usually consisted of two pilots, a commander, and possibly a navigator, with gunners and mechanics to man the guns and engines as well as manually pump fuel up to each engine's <b>gravity</b> <b>tanks.</b>|$|R

50|$|The devastating September 1926 {{hurricane}} burst {{the real}} estate land speculation. The local community recovered from the damage, but lot sales came to a stop, and the northern tourists names showed up in great numbers on the delinquent tax list. Some money from the bond issue was used to build a Spanish-Mediterranean style city hall building at N.E. 8th Avenue and 125th Street in 1928. The City Hall also housed the police and fire departments. In the 1930s a new water plant and <b>gravity</b> <b>tank</b> was installed behind City Hall. The first newspaper, The Miami Shores Bulletin, was published in 1927-28 and chronicled {{the events of the}} times.

50|$|The bomb load {{was carried}} in a {{compartment}} in {{the centre of the}} keel. The keel also accommodated the rubberised canvas ballast bags and the main fuel tanks, which could be jettisoned in an emergency. Fuel was pumped from these <b>tanks</b> to individual <b>gravity</b> <b>tanks</b> above each engine car. As a legacy of the loss of the crew of LZ 54 (L 19), two lightweight lifeboats, made of canvas stretched over a wooden frame, were carried. A total of 10 machine guns were carried as defensive armament: three in the forward platform on top of the hull, one in an aft gun position behind the rudders, two in both the forward and aft gondolas and one in each of the wing cars either side of the hull.|$|R

(Fand, et al. 1987) used a {{steel tube}} {{to contain the}} porous media (glass beads) and the fluid was allowed to flow through the media by a {{constant}} head <b>gravity</b> <b>tank</b> for low velocity flows. They used orifice plates to measure the flow rates. Meyer and Krause (Meyer and Krause 1998) used the traditional Hassler-sleeve type permeameter. However, their experiments consisted of finding the low velocity gas flow effect. Fishel (Fishel 1935) described a U-tube type apparatus (similar to the one used in this study) to apply low pressure gradient on a porous medium.|$|E
40|$|This report {{summarizes}} {{the results of}} the Double-Shell Tank Thermal and Operating Loads Analysis (TaLA) combined with the Seismic Analysis. This combined analysis provides a thorough, defensible, and documented analysis that will {{become a part of the}} overall analysis of record for the Hanford double-shell tanks (DSTs). The bases of the analytical work presented herein are two ANSYS{reg_sign} finite element models that were developed to represent a bounding-case tank. The TaLA model includes the effects of temperature on material properties, creep, concrete cracking, and various waste and annulus pressure-loading conditions. The seismic model considers the interaction of the tanks with the surrounding soil including a range of soil properties, and the effects of the waste contents during a seismic event. The structural evaluations completed with the representative tank models do not reveal any structural deficiencies with the integrity of the DSTs. The analyses represent 60 years of use, which extends well beyond the current date. In addition, the temperature loads imposed on the model are significantly more severe than any service to date or proposed for the future. Bounding material properties were also selected to provide the most severe combinations. While the focus of the analyses was a bounding-case tank, it was necessary during various evaluations to conduct tank-specific analyses. The primary tank buckling evaluation was carried out on a tank-specific basis because of the sensitivity to waste height, specific <b>gravity,</b> <b>tank</b> wall thickness, and primary tank vapor space vacuum limit. For this analysis, the occurrence of maximum tank vacuum was classified as a service level C, emergency load condition. The only area of potential concern in the analysis was with the buckling evaluation of the AP tank, which showed the current limit on demand of l 2 -inch water gauge vacuum to exceed the allowable of 10. 4 inches. This determination was based on analysis at the design waste temperature of 350 F and the full 60 -year corrosion allowance on the tank wall of 0. 060 inch. However, analysis at a more realistic temperature of 250 F or corrosion allowance of 0. 025 inch results in an acceptable demand/capacity ratio according to the ASME code criteria. Thus, buckling of the primary tank is judged to be unlikely for the current lack of corrosion in the tanks, and the expectation that the maximum waste temperature will not exceed 210 F. The reinforced concrete structure was evaluated as specified by the American Concrete Institute (ACI) code requirements for nuclear safety-related structures (ACI- 349). The demand was demonstrated to be lower than the capacity at all locations. Revision 1 is being issued to document changes to the anchor bolt evaluation. RPP-RPT- 32237 Rev. 1, Hanford Double-Shell Tank Thermal and Seismic Project-Increased Liquid Level Analysis for 241 AP Tank Farms, described changes to the anchor bolt modeling and evaluation which were implemented in response to the independent reviewer's comments. Similar changes have been made in the bounding tank analysis and are documented in RPP-RPT- 28968 Rev. 1. The conclusions of the previous releases of this report remain unchanged...|$|E

25|$|The {{aircraft}} was a shoulder-wing monoplane {{powered by a}} 52kW (70hp) Gnome Gamma 7-cylinder rotary engine driving a two bladed propeller. The pilot and passenger were seated in side-by-side configuration: the control column was centrally mounted {{and there were two}} sets of rudder pedals, so that it could be flown from either seat. The shallow section rectangular fuselage tapered to a horizontal knife-edge at the tail, with the elongated triangular horizontal stabiliser mounted in the middle, its covering blending into that of the upper and lower fuselage surface. A semi-elliptical elevator was mounted on the trailing edge, and a triangular balanced rudder was mounted above the rear fuselage. Lateral control was effected by wing-warping, the wires leading to a single inverted V-strut cabane above the fuselage and a similar V strut beneath. Petrol was stored in three tanks: a pair of <b>gravity</b> <b>tanks</b> were located under the top decking in front of the cockpit, pressure-fed from a larger tank under the seats.|$|R

5000|$|The most {{significant}} difference between the two types was the use of [...] Eagle VIII engines (£1,622/10/- £1,622.50 each). Unlike the earlier version, this engine was not built in right-handed and left-handed versions, because production of engines of both types for engine type approval had been difficult; wind tunnel tests at the NPL established that the counter-rotating propellers were a cause of the directional instability of the O/100. It was realised that only one version was necessary, simplifying production and maintenance; the torque effect was overcome by offsetting the fin slightly. The O/400 had a strengthened fuselage, an increased bomb load, the nacelle tanks were removed and the fuel was carried in two 130 imp gal fuselage tanks, supplying a pair of 15 imp gal <b>gravity</b> <b>tanks.</b> The new nacelles were smaller and had simplified supporting struts; the reduction of drag producing an improvement in maximum speed and altitude. The revised nacelle was tested in 3188, which in 1917 was flown at Martlesham Heath with a variety of engine installations. An initial order for 100 of the revised design, with Sunbeam Maori or Eagle engines, was placed on 14 August but cancelled shortly afterwards. Twelve sets of Cricklewood-built components were transferred to the Royal Aircraft Factory, where they were assembled into the first production O/400s. More than 400 were supplied before the Armistice at a price of £6,000 each. Another 107 were licence-built in the USA by the Standard Aircraft Corporation (out of 1,500 ordered by the air corps). Forty-six out of an order for fifty were built by Clayton & Shuttleworth in Lincoln.|$|R
