2500|$|The {{effects of}} {{diffraction}} are {{often seen in}} everyday life. The most striking examples of diffraction are those that involve light; for example, the closely spaced tracks on a CD or DVD act as a diffraction grating to form the familiar rainbow pattern seen when looking at a disc. This principle can be extended to engineer a grating with a structure such that it will produce any diffraction pattern desired; the hologram on a credit card is an example. Diffraction in the atmosphere by small particles can cause a bright ring to be visible around a bright light source [...] like the sun or the moon. A shadow of a solid object, using light from a compact source, shows small fringes near its edges. The speckle pattern which is observed when laser light falls on an optically rough surface is also a <b>diffraction</b> <b>phenomenon.</b> [...] When deli meat appears to be iridescent, that is diffraction off the meat fibers.

40|$|International audienceAccording to the Huygens–Fresnel principle, the {{electric}} field transfer by diffraction from an emitter to a receiver can be {{split into two}} diffraction phenomena: from the emitter to an arbitrary intermediate surface and from this surface to the receiver. Expressing field transfers by the usual Fresnel-type integrals complies with this principle. Since a <b>diffraction</b> <b>phenomenon</b> can be mathematically represented by a fractional order Fourier transform, the Huygens–Fresnel principle should accompany the composition of fractional transforms. We show that diffraction representations by fractional Fourier transforms that have been proposed by some authors are not in conformity with the Huygens–Fresnel principle.
