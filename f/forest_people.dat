25|$|By 1206, Genghis Khan had conquered all Mongol and Turkic {{tribes in}} Mongolia and {{southern}} Siberia. In 1207 {{his eldest son}} Jochi subjugated the Siberian <b>forest</b> <b>people,</b> the Uriankhai, the Oirats, Barga, Khakas, Buryats, Tuvans, Khori-Tumed, and Kyrgyz. He then organized the Siberians into three tumens. Genghis Khan gave the Telengit and Tolos along the Irtysh River to an old companion, Qorchi. While the Barga, Tumed, Buriats, Khori, Keshmiti, and Bashkirs were organized in separate thousands, the Telengit, Tolos, Oirats and Yenisei Kirghiz were numbered as tumens. Genghis settled a colony of Chinese craftsmen and farmers at Kem-kemchik after {{the first phase of}} the Mongol conquest of the Jin dynasty. The Great Khans favored gyrfalcons, furs, women and Kyrgyz horses for tribute.|$|E
25|$|Besides mythological influences, medieval {{wild man}} lore also {{drew on the}} learned {{writings}} of ancient historians, though likely to a lesser degree. These ancient wild men are naked and sometimes covered with hair, though importantly the texts generally localize them in some faraway land, distinguishing them from the medieval wild man who was thought to exist just at the boundaries of civilization. The first historian to describe such beings, Herodotus (c. 484 BC – c. 425 BC), places them in western Libya alongside the headless men with eyes in their chest and dog-faced creatures. After {{the appearance of the}} former Persian court physician Ctesias's book Indika (concerning India), which recorded Persian beliefs about the subcontinent, and the conquests of Alexander the Great, India became the primary home of fantastic creatures in the Western imagination, and wild men were frequently described as living there. Megasthenes, Seleucus I Nicator's ambassador to Chandragupta Maurya, wrote of two kinds of men to be found in India whom he explicitly describes as wild: first, a creature brought to court whose toes faced backwards; second, a tribe of <b>forest</b> <b>people</b> who had no mouths and who sustained themselves with smells. Both Quintus Curtius Rufus and Arrian refer to Alexander himself meeting with a tribe of fish-eating savages while on his Indian campaign.|$|E

25|$|The Ohmu {{and other}} forest insects {{respond to this}} {{development}} and sacrifice themselves to pacify {{the expansion of the}} mold, which is beyond human control. Nausicaä resigns herself to joining in their fate. However, one of the Ohmu encapsulates her inside itself in a protective serum, allowing her to survive the mold. She is recovered by her companions, people she met after leaving the Valley and who have joined her on her quest for a peaceful coexistence. The fact that the mold can be manipulated and used as a weapon disturbs Nausicaä. Her treks into the forest have already taught her that the Sea of Corruption is actually purifying the polluted land. The <b>Forest</b> <b>People,</b> humans who have learned to live in harmony with the Sea of Corruption, confirm this is the purpose of the Sea of Corruption and one of them shows Nausicaä a vision of the restored Earth {{at the center of the}} forest. Nausicaä travels deeper into Dorok territory, where her coming has long been prophesied, to seek those responsible for manipulating the mold. There, she encounters a dormant God Warrior who, upon activation, assumes she is his mother and places his destructive powers at her disposal. Faced with this power and its single minded and childlike visions of the world, she engages the creature, names him and persuades him to travel with her to Shuwa, the Holy City of the Doroks.|$|E
500|$|The {{watershed}} lies {{partly in}} the Coast Range ecoregion and partly in the Willamette Valley ecoregion {{designated by the}} U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA). The historic lower Balch Creek watershed through the 1880s {{was a mixture of}} open water, wetlands, grassland, and forest, while above the flood plain the watershed consisted of closed canopy <b>forest.</b> <b>People</b> who settled here in the 19thcentury logged much of this forest and filled the wetlands. In 2002, aerial photographs showed that buildings, parking lots, shoreline structures, and other cleared areas covered most of the lower floodplain. On the other hand, hill forests protected from major disturbance covered about 65percent of the watershed.|$|E
500|$|The Home Army was {{intended}} as a mass organization, formed around a core of prewar officers. Home Army soldiers fell into three groups. The first two consisted of [...] "full-time members": undercover operatives, living mostly in urban settings under false identities (most senior Home Army officers belonged to this group); and uniformed (to a certain extent) partisans, living in forested regions (see [...] "forest people"), who openly fought the Germans (the <b>forest</b> <b>people</b> are estimated at some 40 groups, numbering 1,200–4,000 persons in early 1943, but their numbers grew substantially during Operation Tempest). The third, largest group were [...] "part-time members": [...] sympathizers who led [...] "double lives" [...] under their real names in their real homes, received no payment for their services, stayed in touch with their undercover unit commanders but were seldom mustered for operations, as the Home Army planned to use them only during a planned nationwide rising.|$|E

40|$|ABSTRACT The <b>Forest</b> <b>Peoples</b> of Gabon (commonly {{referred}} to as the Pygmies) have, until recently, attracted little attention in the academic forum. It seems it is widely assumed that these groups are largely assimilated into dominant neighbouring ethnic groups and have consequently adopted new cultural practices and lost many of their own (Anderson, 1983). Recent research has revealed a range of socio-economic situations including forest-based semi-nomadic communities who combine hunting and gathering with shifting cultivation. However, the majority of Gabon’s <b>Forest</b> <b>Peoples</b> have moved to the roadside, and where the last forest-based groups remain, relocation is inevitable or in process. Integrating ideas of history both exogenous and local, the aim {{of this paper is to}} consider the reasons why the <b>Forest</b> <b>Peoples</b> of Gabon have been relocated to the roadside in both academic and real terms. Based on recent fieldwork it provides preliminary observations on: the present distribution, settlement patterns and subsistence strategies of the <b>Forest</b> <b>Peoples</b> of Gabon; the processes by which they have been (and continue to be) relocated; and the effects of their various efforts to accept or reject inclusion...|$|R

500|$|The honored {{place that}} Ralambo awarded to Kelimalaza {{encouraged}} others like Kalobe {{to bring their}} own sampy to Ralambo from neighboring lands {{where they had been}} introduced long before by the Antaimoro. First after Kelimalaza was Ramahavaly, said to control snakes and repel attacks. The next arrival, Manjakatsiroa, protected the sovereignty of the king from rivals and became the favorite of Ralambo, who kept it always near him. Afterward came Rafantaka, believed to protect against injury and death; others followed, all of Antaimoro origin {{with the possible exception of}} Mosasa, which had come from the Tanala <b>forest</b> <b>people</b> to the east. The propagation of similar sampy at the service of less powerful citizens consequently increased throughout Imerina under Ralambo's rule: nearly every village chief, as well as many common families, had one in their possession and claimed the powers and protection their communal sampy offered them. These lesser sampy were destroyed or reduced to the status of ody (personal talismans) by the end of the reign of Ralambo's son, Andrianjaka, officially leaving only twelve truly powerful sampy (known as the sampin'andriana: the [...] "Royal Sampy") which were all in the possession of the king. These royal sampy, including Kelimalaza, continued to be worshiped until their supposed destruction in a bonfire by Queen Ranavalona II upon her public conversion to Christianity in 1869.|$|E

[...] Inspiration was drawn from the African Maasai warriors' ritual scar markings. [...] As for the Archers, skin-toned Tactel was selected and tattoo designs were printed on it to make the Archers' tattoos look truly realistic. [...] They also have moulded rubber toes attached to their shoes, giving the appearance that they are barefoot. [...] Tattooing techniques used for the Archers were also applied to the Counselor's Son. [...] In addition, a ripped piece of kilt is superimposed on his costume; this was made by using [...] "shibori" [...] (a Japanese tye-dyeing technique).|$|E
