40|$|Human {{ingenuity}} {{has made}} it possible to advent the chromosome manipulation techniques to produce individuals with differing genomic status in a number of fish using various causal agents such as physical shocks (temperature or hydrostatic pressure), chemical (<b>endomitotics)</b> and anesthetic treatments either to suppress the second meiotic division shortly after fertilization of eggs or to prevent the first mitotic division shortly prior to mitotic cleavage formation. This results in the induction of polyploidy (triploidy and tetraploidy), gynogenesis (both meiotic and mitotic leading to clonal lines) and androgenesis in fish population. The rationale for the induction of such ploidy in fish has been its potential for generating sterile individuals, rapidly inbred lines and masculinized fish, which could be of benefit to fish farming and aquaculture. In this paper, these are critically reviewed and the implication of recently developed chromosome manipulation techniques to various fin fishes is discussed...|$|R

Expression of cyclin E is activated by E2F transcription factors that {{were shown to}} be required for endoreplication. [...] Recent work suggests that observed oscillations in E2F and cyclin E protein levels result from a negative-feedback loop involving Cul4-dependent ubiquitination and degradation of E2F. [...] Post-transcriptional regulation of cyclin E-Cdk2 activity involves Ago/Fbw7-mediated proteolytic degradation of cyclin E [...] and direct inhibition by factors such as Dacapo and p57. True endomitosis in the anther tapetum of the liliaceous plant Eremurus is described. The nuclear membrane does not disappear, but during metaphase the chromosomes are condensed, often considerably more than in normal mitosis. When the pollen mother cells (PMCs) go through the last premeiotic mitosis, the tapetal cells have one diploid nucleus which divides while the cell remains undivided. The two diploid nuclei may undergo an endomitosis and the resulting tetraploid nuclei a second endomitosis. An alternative pathway is an ordinary mitosis-again without cell division instead {{of one of the}} <b>endomitotic</b> cycles. The cytological picture in the tapetum is further complicated by restitution in anaphase and fusion of metaphase and anaphase groups during mitosis, processes which could give rise to cells with one, two, or three nuclei, instead of the expected two or four. No sign of the so-called [...] "inhibited" [...] mitosis is seen in these tapetal cells. When the PMCs are in leptotene-zygotene, very few tapetal nuclei are in endomitosis. When the PMCs have reached diplotene, almost 100% of cells which are not in interphase show an <b>endomitotic</b> stage.|$|E
50|$|Mole {{salamanders}} are {{an ancient}} (2.4-3.8 million year-old) unisexual vertebrate lineage. In the polyploid unisexual mole salamander females, a premeiotic <b>endomitotic</b> event doubles {{the number of}} chromosomes.

Synapsis and recombination during meiotic prophase I in these unisexual females is thought to ordinarily occur between identical sister chromosomes and occasionally between homologous chromosomes. Thus little, if any, genetic variation is produced. Recombination between homeologous chromosomes occurs only rarely, if at all. Since production of genetic variation is weak, at best, {{it is unlikely to}} provide a benefit sufficient to account for the long-term maintenance of meiosis in these organisms.

5000|$|Once {{the cell}} has {{completed}} differentiation {{and become a}} mature megakaryocyte, it begins the process of producing platelets. The maturation process occurs via <b>endomitotic</b> synchronous replication whereby the cytoplasmic volume enlarges {{as the number of}} chromosomes multiplies without cellular division. The cell ceases its growth at 4N, 8N or 16N, becomes granular, and begins to produce platelets. [...] Thrombopoietin plays a role in inducing the megakaryocyte to form small proto-platelet processes. Platelets are held within these internal membranes within the cytoplasm of megakaryocytes. There are two proposed mechanisms for platelet release. In one scenario, these proto-platelet processes break up explosively to become platelets. Alternatively, the cell may form platelet ribbons into blood vessels. The ribbons are formed via pseudopodia and they are able to continuously emit platelets into circulation. In either scenario, each of these proto-platelet processes can give rise to 2000-5000 new platelets upon breakup. Overall, 2/3 of these newly produced platelets will remain in circulation while 1/3 will be sequestered by the spleen.|$|E

After meiosis each egg has the same ploidy (number of chromosomes) as the mother. This particular parthenogentic mechanism has been observed in unisexual Ambystoma species as well as Glandirana rugosa. [...] The second potential mechanism is apomixis, which produces a complete set of chromosomes through mitotic replication. [...] This method has not been observed in any amphibious species.

To investigate whether the insulin signaling pathway is involved in endomitosis in silk gland cells, in this study, we initially analyzed the effects of bovine insulin on DNA synthesis in <b>endomitotic</b> silk gland cells using 5 -bromo- 2 '-deoxyuridine (BrdU) labeling technology, and found that bovine insulin can stimulate DNA synthesis. Insulin signal transduction is mainly mediated via phosphoinositide 3 -kinase (PI 3 K) /Akt, the target of rapamycin (TOR) and the extracellular signal-regulated kinase (ERK) pathways in vertebrates. We ascertained that these three pathways are involved in DNA synthesis in <b>endomitotic</b> silk gland cells using specific inhibitors against each pathway. Moreover, we investigated whether these three pathways are involved in insulin-stimulated DNA synthesis in <b>endomitotic</b> silk gland cells, and found that the PI 3 K/Akt and TOR pathways, but not the ERK pathway, are involved in this process.

40|$|Platelet {{production}} is a regulated phenomenon. Indeed, megakaryocyte volume is inversely correlated to the platelet count {{not only in}} normal individuals and immune thrombocytopenic purpura patients, but also, and surprisingly, in chronic myeloid leukemia patients. Patients with polycythemia vera and essential thrombocythemia are located outside this regression line. Herein, we describe morphometrical data confirmed by the flow cytometric measurement of the megakaryocyte <b>endomitotic</b> index (EI). The EI is a value which reflects the mean ploidy of megakaryocytes and corresponds to the mean of (¿log 2 DNA content expressed in N¿- 1). In this study, the megakaryocyte <b>endomitotic</b> index of 14 normal individuals was compared to those of chronic myeloid leukemia (CML) patients (n = 16), immune thrombocytopenic purpura (ITP) patients (n = 11), essential thrombocythemia (ET) patients (n = 10) and polycythemia vera (PV) patients (n = 12). The megakaryocyte EI was significantly lower in CML patients than in normal individuals. In contrast, in ET, PV and ITP patients, megakaryocyte EI was higher than in normal individuals. An inverse relationship between the <b>endomitotic</b> index estimated by flow cytometry and the mean megakaryocyte volume performed by morphometry was observed in normal individuals, CML and ITP patients.

40|$|The {{pathways}} {{that regulate}} the S-phase events {{associated with the}} control of DNA replication are poorly understood. The bone marrow megakaryocytes are unique in that they leave the diploid (2 C) state to differentiate, synthesizing 4 to 64 times the normal DNA content within a single nucleus, {{a process known as}} endomitosis. Human erythroleukemia (HEL) cells model this process, becoming polyploid during phorbol diester-induced megakaryocyte differentiation. The mitotic arrest occurring in these polyploid cells involves novel alterations in the cdk 1 /cyclin B 1 complex: a marked reduction in cdk 1 protein levels, and an elevated and sustained expression of cyclin B 1. <b>Endomitotic</b> cells thus lack cdk 1 /cyclin B 1 -associated H 1 -histone kinase activity. Constitutive over-expression of cdk 1 in <b>endomitotic</b> cells failed to re-initiate normal mitotic events even though cdk 1 was present in a 10 -fold excess. This was due to an inability of cyclin-B 1 to physically associate with cdk 1. Nonetheless, <b>endomitotic</b> cyclin B 1 possesses immunoprecipitable H 1 -histone kinase activity, and specifically translocates to the nucleus. We conclude that mitosis is abrogated during endomitosis due to the absence of cdk 1 and the failure to form M-phase promoting factor, resulting in a disassociation of mitosis from the completion of S-phase.

To do this, we used the δ-sequence-mediated integration vector system and the heat-induced <b>endomitotic</b> diploidization method. δ-Sequence-mediated integration is known to occur mainly in a particular chromosome, and the copy number of the integration is variable. In order to construct transformants carrying the GAI gene on several chromosomes, haploid cells carrying the GAI gene on different chromosomes were crossed with each other. The cells were then allowed to form spores, which was followed by dissection. Haploid cells containing GAI genes on multiple chromosomes were obtained in this way. One such haploid cell contained the GAI gene on five chromosomes and exhibited the highest GAI activity (5. 93 U/ml), which was about sixfold higher than the activity of a cell containing one gene on a single chromosome.

40|$|Platelets, {{essential}} for thrombosis and hemostasis, develop from polyploid megakaryocytes which undergo endomitosis. During this cell cycle, cells experience abrogated mitosis and reenter {{a phase of}} DNA synthesis, thus leading to endomitosis. In the search for regulators of the <b>endomitotic</b> cell cycle, we have identified cyclin D 3 as an important regulatory factor. Of the D-type cyclins, cyclin D 3 is present at high levels in megakaryo-cytes undergoing endomitosis and is markedly upregulated following exposure to the proliferation-, matura-tion-, and ploidy-promoting factor, Mpl ligand. Transgenic mice in which cyclin D 3 is overexpressed in the platelet lineage display a striking increase in endomitosis, similar to changes seen following Mpl ligand administration to normal mice. Electron microscopy analysis revealed that unlike such treated mice, however, D 3 transgenic mice show a poor development of demarcation membranes, from which platelets are believed to fragment, and no increase in platelets. Thus, while our model supports a key role for cyclin D 3 in the <b>endomitotic</b> cell cycle, it also points to the unique role of Mpl ligand in priming megakaryocytes towards platelet fragmentation.

40|$|Cell-cycle {{progression}} {{and cell}} division in eukaryotes are governed {{in part by}} the cyclin family and their regulation of cyclin-dependent kinases (CDKs). Cyclins are very well characterised in model systems such as yeast and human cells, but surprisingly little is known about their number and role in Plasmodium, the unicellular protozoan parasite that causes malaria. Malaria parasite cell division and proliferation differs from that of many eukaryotes. During its life cycle it undergoes two types of mitosis: endomitosis in asexual stages and an extremely rapid mitotic process during male gametogenesis. Both schizogony (producing merozoites) in host liver and red blood cells, and sporogony (producing sporozoites) in the mosquito vector, are <b>endomitotic</b> with repeated nuclear replication, without chromosome condensation, before cell division. The role of specific cyclins during Plasmodium cell proliferation was unknown. We show here that the Plasmodium genome contains only three cyclin genes, representing an unusual repertoire of cyclin classes. Expression and reverse genetic analyses of the single Plant (P) -type cyclin, CYC 3, in the rodent malaria parasite, Plasmodium berghei, revealed a cytoplasmic and nuclear location of the GFP-tagged protein throughout the lifecycle. Deletion of cyc 3 resulted in defects in size, number and growth of oocysts, with abnormalities in budding and sporozoite formation. Furthermore, global transcript analysis of the cyc 3 -deleted and wild type parasites at gametocyte and ookinete stages identified differentially expressed genes required for signalling, invasion and oocyst development.

The silk gland morphogenesis is complete by 8 days post egg laying. Extensive growth of silk glands during the larval stages is due to increase in tissue mass and not cell number. The cells in a completely formed silk gland pursue an endoreplicative cell cycle, and the genome undergoes multiple rounds of replication without mitosis or nuclear division. The expression patterns of cyclin B (mitotic cyclin) and cyclin E (G 1 cyclin, essential for G 1 /S transition in both mitotic and endoreplicative cell cycles) {{in the course of}} silk gland development revealed that mitotic cell divisions take place only in the apex of the growing silk gland. However, the persistence of another mitotic focus in the middle silk gland even when the growing apex has moved well past this zone suggested the continued operation of mitosis for a while in this restricted region. The lack of cyclin B expression and abundance of cyclin E {{in the rest of the}} areas confirmed an alternation of the G 1 and S phases of the cell cycle without an intervening mitotic phase. No expression of cyclin B was noticed anywhere in the silk glands after stage 25 of embryogenesis, indicating a complete switch over to the <b>endomitotic</b> mode of the cell cycle.

40|$|Background: The in vivo {{determination}} of the cell-specific chromosome number provides a valuable tool in several aspects of plant research. However, current techniques to determine the endosystemic ploidy level do not allow non-destructive, cell-specific chromosome quantification. Particularly in the gametophytic cell lineages, which are physically encapsulated in the reproductive organ structures, direct in vivo ploidy determination has been proven very challenging. Using Arabidopsis thaliana as a model, we here assess the applicability of recombinant CENH 3 -GFP reporters for the labeling of the cell’s chromocenters and for the monitoring of the gametophytic and somatic chromosome number in vivo. Results: By modulating expression of a CENH 3 -GFP reporter cassette using different promoters, we isolated two reporter lines that allow for a clear and highly specific labeling of centromeric chromosome regions in somatic and gametophytic cells respectively. Using polyploid plant series and reproductive mutants, we demonstrate that the pWOX 2 -CENH 3 -GFP recombinant fusion protein allows for the {{determination of}} the gametophytic chromosome number in both male and female gametophytic cells, and additionally labels centromeric regions in early embryo development. Somatic centromere labeling through p 35 S-CENH 3 -GFP shows a maximum of ten centromeric dots in young dividing tissues, reflecting the diploid chromosome number (2 x[*]=[*] 10), and reveals a progressive decrease in GFP foci frequency throughout plant development. Moreover, using chemical and genetic induction of endomitosis, we demonstrate that CENH 3 -mediated chromosome labeling provides an easy and valuable tool for the detection and characterization of <b>endomitotic</b> polyploidization events. Conclusions: This study demonstrates that the introgression of the pWOX 2 -CENH 3 -GFP reporter construct in Arabidopsis thaliana provides an easy and reliable methodology for determining the chromosome number in developing male and female gametes, and during early embryo development. Somatically expressed CENH 3 -GFP reporters, on the other hand, constitute a valuable tool to quickly determine the basic somatic ploidy level in young seedlings at the individual cell level and to detect and to quantify <b>endomitotic</b> polyploidization events in a non-destructive, microscopy-based manner...|$|E

RIOK- 1 was expressed {{in a range of}} different tissues, including the spermatheca, intestinal cells and a subset of neurons. RIOK- 2 displayed expression in the pharynx, while riok- 3 animals revealed expression in a small subset of neuron. RNAi was used to further analysis riok members, as it bypassed the genetic mutant arrest stage. Our data identified a new novel role for riok-l in oogenesis. Interestingly, knockdown of riok- 1 in hermaphrodite animals results in 100 % sterility, while males produce viable/functional sperm. Adult riok- 1 (RNAi) hermaphrodite gonads are smaller in size and display <b>endomitotic</b> oocytes, where large DNA aggregates were observed. Interestingly, riok- 1 knockdown resulted in increased MAP kinase activation in gonads, which has previously been shown to induce <b>endomitotic</b> oocyte formation.

Therefore, riok- 1 and riok- 2 are required for normal development, with riok- 1 possessing a major function in oogenesis.

Each parameter in each model is identified with specific environmental stress effects, and the effects exerted upon the isoclines are identified. The biological mechanisms associated with theoretical stresses are discussed...|$|E
40|$|SummaryPolyploidization can {{precede the}} {{development}} of aneuploidy in cancer. Polyploidization in megakaryocytes (Mks), in contrast, is a highly controlled developmental process critical for efficient platelet production via unknown mechanisms. Using primary cells, we demonstrate that the guanine exchange factors GEF-H 1 and ECT 2, which are often overexpressed in cancer and are essential for RhoA activation during cytokinesis, must be downregulated for Mk polyploidization. The first (2 N– 4 N) <b>endomitotic</b> cycle requires GEF-H 1 downregulation, whereas subsequent cycles (> 4 N) require ECT 2 downregulation. Exogenous expression of both GEF-H 1 and ECT 2 prevents endomitosis, resulting in proliferation of 2 N Mks. Furthermore, we {{have shown that the}} mechanism by which polyploidization is prevented in Mks lacking Mkl 1, which is mutated in megakaryocytic leukemia, is via elevated GEF-H 1 expression; shRNA-mediated GEF-H 1 knockdown alone rescues this ploidy defect. These mechanistic insights enhance our understanding of normal versus malignant megakaryocytopoiesis, as well as aberrant mitosis in aneuploid cancers. Video Abstrac...|$|E
40|$|Ovulation in the {{nematode}} Caenorhabditis elegans is {{coordinated by}} {{interactions between the}} somatic gonad and germ cells. Myoepithelial sheath cells of the proximal ovary are smooth muscle-like cells, but the regulatory mechanism of their contraction is unknown. We show that contraction of the ovarian muscle requires tropomyosin and troponin, which are generally major actin-linked regulators of contraction of striated muscle. RNA interference of tropomyosin or troponin C caused sterility by inhibiting ovarian contraction that is required for expelling mature oocytes into the spermatheca where fertilization takes place, thus causing accumulation of <b>endomitotic</b> oocytes in the ovary. Tropomyosin and troponin C were associated with actin filaments in the myoepithelial sheath, and the association of troponin C with actin was dependent on tropomyosin. A mutation in the actin depolymerizing factor/cofilin gene suppressed the ovulation defects by RNA interference of tropomyosin or troponin C. These results strongly suggest that tropomyosin and troponin are the actin-linked regulators for contraction of ovarian muscle in the C. elegans reproductive system...|$|E
40|$|The {{volume of}} the cortex and pith cells of {{strawberries}} from the cultivar Talizman gradually increased until ripening, especially in the cortex. The {{volume of the}} nucleus also increased. The nuclei in the pith were smaller then in the cortex. The volume of the nucleolus increased significantly between days 1 and 5 after pollination, after which it remained unchanged. At {{the end of the}} growth period, the volume of the nucleolus in cortical and pith cells in the lower and central part of the fruit increased. <b>Endomitotic</b> polyploidization which was responsible for the growth of the fruit, occurred during the development of the receptacle. The intensity of 3 H actinomycin binding reached a maximum in the oldest stages. This is proof for the accumulation of active DNA during mitosis. Saturation with this antibiotic occurred {{in the early stages of}} fruit development. No dependence between the volume of cells and the number of nuclei binding 3 H actinomycin was observed...|$|E
40|$|The {{effects of}} {{continuous}} incubation in hydroxyurea (HU) solutions (0. 2, 0. 4, 0. 8 mg/ml) on germination of rape seeds {{and growth of}} young seedling axes were studied during 132 hours from initial soaking. Germination {{turned out to be}} unaffected by the treatment. Root growth was first increasingly inhibited by the HU concentration tested, but after prolonged incubation a complete arrest of the root growth was noted at all HU concentrations. The elongation growth of hypocotyls was found to be stimulated by a HU 0. 2 mg/ml concentration while it was markedly suppressed by 0. 4 mg/ml, and completely arrested by 0. 8 mg/ml Inhibition of growth of the upright hypocotyl part at higher HU concentration was found to be accompanied by the unbending of the hooked under-cotyledonary part. It is suggested that inhibition of nuclear <b>endomitotic</b> DNA synthesis In elongating hypocotyl cells, suppresses only partially their growth, whereas a complete inhibition of the hypocotyl growth results from arrest of the mitochondrial DNA synthesis...|$|E
40|$|RIO protein kinases (RIOKs) are a {{relatively}} conserved family of enzymes implicated in cell cycle control and ribosomal RNA processing. Despite their functional importance, they remain a poorly understood group of kinases in multicellular organisms. Here, {{we show that}} the C. elegans genome contains one member {{of each of the}} three RIOK sub-families and that each of the genes coding for them has a unique tissue expression pattern. Our analysis showed that the gene encoding RIOK- 1 (riok- 1) was broadly and strongly expressed. Interestingly, the intestinal expression of riok- 1 was dependent upon two putative binding sites for the oxidative and xenobiotic stress response transcription factor SKN- 1. RNA interference (RNAi) -mediated knock down of riok- 1 resulted in germline defects, including defects in germ line stem cell proliferation, oocyte maturation and the production of <b>endomitotic</b> oocytes. Taken together, our findings indicate new functions for RIOK- 1 in post mitotic tissues and in reproduction. Full Tex...|$|E
40|$|AbstractThe {{formation}} of a complex multicellular organism requires the precise specification of many diverse cell types at the correct time and position throughout development. This may be achieved by coordinating cell fate specification processes with progression through the cell cycle. Here, we show that the extra distal tip cells (DTCs) associated {{with the loss of}} cki- 1, a Caenorhabditis elegans homologue of the cyclin-dependent kinase inhibitor p 27, do not arise from duplications of pre-existing DTCs, but that they are formed from another cell type within the somatic gonad. Results from our laser microsurgery experiments suggest that the extra DTCs are caused by aberrant somatic gonadal precursor cell divisions in the absence of cki- 1, resulting in abnormal daughter cell fates. cki- 1 (RNAi) animals also possess extra anchor cells and ectopic gonad arms with variable sheath cell numbers and positioning. In addition, cki- 1 (RNAi) animals display an <b>endomitotic</b> oocyte (Emo) phenotype. Our results uncover a novel role of this CKI in cell fate acquisition, either by directly influencing specification, or through a more conventional role in appropriately linking cell cycle phase with this process...|$|E
40|$|Megakaryocytes (MKs) undergo an <b>endomitotic</b> cell cycle, {{leading to}} polyploidy. We {{examined}} {{the expression of}} the flavoproteins and oxidative stress-promoting enzymes, NADPH oxidases (Nox's), in MKs because of their known role in promoting the cell cycle. Although the expression of Nox isoforms varies between cell types, they are induced at the mRNA level by mitogenic stimuli. Western blotting or reverse transcription–polymerase chain reaction of purified mouse MKs isolated from thrombopoietin (TPO) –treated bone marrow (BM) cultures indicated high expression of Nox 1, a weak expression of Nox 4, and no significant expression of Nox 2. Immunofluorescence of freshly isolated MKs confirmed strong expression of Nox 1 in one-third of MKs, whereas Nox 1 staining was detected in nearly all MKs in TPO-stimulated BM cultures. Treatment of mouse BM cultures with Nox inhibitors resulted in accumulation of MKs with low DNA content levels and significant reduction of higher ploidy MKs. Purified, Nox-inhibited MKs showed a notable decrease in the level of the G 1 phase cyclin E, a cyclin associated with MK polyploidy, and its up-regulation restored most of the effect of Nox inhibitors. Hence, this study shows the expression of Nox isoforms in MKs and highlights a potential role of flavoproteins in promoting polyploidization in this lineage...|$|E
