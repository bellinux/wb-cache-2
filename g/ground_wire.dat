An {{alternative to}} battery power is phantom power, {{which consists of}} direct current applied equally through the two signal lines of a balanced audio connector, usually a three-pin XLR connector.

Phantom power is usually supplied at a nominal 48 volts DC, although lower voltages are permissible and modern microphones will often operate over a wide range.|$|E
500|$|Over {{the next}} twenty years, from 1965 to 1985, Quebec {{underwent}} a massive expansion of its 735kV power grid and its hydroelectric generating capacity. Hydro-Québec Équipement, another division of Hydro-Québec, and Société d’énergie de la Baie James built these transmission lines, electrical substations, and generating stations. Constructing the transmission system for the La Grande Phase One, part of the James Bay Project, took 12,500 towers, 13 electrical substations, [...] of <b>ground</b> <b>wire,</b> and [...] of electrical conductor {{at a cost of}} C$3.1 billion alone. In less than four decades, Hydro-Québec's generating capacity went from 3,000MW in 1963 to nearly 33,000MW in 2002, with 25,000MW of that power sent to population centers on 735kV power lines.|$|E

2500|$|The wire antennas {{used with}} crystal {{receivers}} are monopole antennas which develop their output voltage {{with respect to}} ground. The receiver thus requires a connection to ground (the earth) as a return circuit for the current. [...] The <b>ground</b> <b>wire</b> was attached to a radiator, water pipe, or a metal stake driven into the ground. [...] In early days if an adequate ground connection could not be made a counterpoise was sometimes used. [...] A good ground is more important for crystal sets {{than it is for}} powered receivers, as crystal sets are designed to have a low input impedance needed to transfer power efficiently from the antenna. A low resistance ground connection (preferably below 25 Ω) is necessary because any resistance in the ground reduces available power from the antenna. In contrast, modern receivers are voltage-driven devices, with high input impedance, hence little current flows in the antenna/ground circuit. Also, mains powered receivers are grounded adequately through their power cords, which are in turn attached to the earth by way of a well established ground.|$|E

40|$|The {{ever more}} {{electrified}} and energy-intensive society increases {{the need for}} a secure power grid and energy service. The transmission system is the backbone of the electrical power infrastructure, to have a well-functioning protection system of this is therefore crucial. The most common type of faults in the power grid are ground faults on overhead lines, which makes it important to be sure about how the relays will measure such a fault. Distance protection is the preferred protection scheme for the transmission grid, thus it is of importance to determine how the performance of these depends on parameters like presence of <b>ground</b> <b>wires,</b> <b>ground</b> conductivity, system neutral earthing, different types of faults and size of fault resistance. This masters thesis investigates the impact that presence of <b>ground</b> <b>wires</b> has on the ability of the distance relay to detect single phase-to-ground faults in a grid with solid earthed neutral. In compensated earthed networks it is investigated whether the distance relays are able to distinguish two single phase-to-ground faults at two different phases occurring at the same time but at distant locations from a single ground fault. To investigate these scenarios, models of a transmission line and a section of a transmission grid were implemented in the simulation programme ATPDraw. The models were used for testing of various fault scenarios in combination with different system neutral earthing methods, line design and ground conductivity. It was found that presence of overhead <b>ground</b> <b>wires</b> does not have decisive impact on whether the distance relays are able to detect a single ground fault in a solid earthed grid. However, estimated fault location was severely improved for lines with <b>ground</b> <b>wires</b> compared to those without. Fault resistance was found to be the factor deciding whether a ground fault was detected. For a solid earthed grid lacking <b>ground</b> <b>wires,</b> high earth potential rise at fault location during a ground fault is a concern. The distance relays are displaying a clear difference in measured impedance for one ground fault versus two ground faults. Thus, in theory, {{it should be possible to}} implement more advanced protection zones that will only trip the relay for double faults and persistent single faults. However, this subject needs further analysis before a general conclusion applicable to all possible fault scenarios can be stated...|$|R
