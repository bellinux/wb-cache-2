50|$|The favored azaenolate is the {{dominant}} starting molecule for the subsequent alkylation reaction. There are two possible faces of accessing for any electrophile to react with. The steric interaction between the pyrrolidine ring and the <b>electrophilic</b> <b>reagent</b> hinders the attack of the electrophile from the top face.

Therefore, the electrophilic attack proceeds from the sterically more accessible face.|$|R
50|$|Superelectrophiles {{are defined}} as {{cationic}} <b>electrophilic</b> <b>reagents</b> with greatly enhanced reactivities {{in the presence of}} superacids. These compounds were first described by George A. Olah. Superelectrophiles form as a doubly electron deficient superelectrophile by protosolvation of a cationic electrophile. As observed by Olah, a mixture of acetic acid and boron trifluoride is able to remove a hydride ion from isobutane when combined with hydrofluoric acid via the formation of a superacid from BF3 and HF. The responsible reactive intermediate is the CH3CO2H3 dication.
