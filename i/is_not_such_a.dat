5|$|Batesian mimicry {{is a case}} of {{protective}} or defensive mimicry, where the mimic does best by avoiding confrontations with the signal receiver. It is a disjunct system, which means that all three parties are from different species. Batesian mimicry stands in contrast to other forms such as aggressive mimicry, where the mimic profits from interactions with the signal receiver. One such case of this is in fireflies, where females of one species mimic the mating signals of another species, deceiving males to come close enough for them to eat. Mimicry need not involve a predator at all though. Such is the case in dispersal mimicry, where the mimic once again benefits from the encounter. For instance, some fungi have their spores dispersed by insects by smelling like carrion. In protective mimicry, the meeting between mimic and dupe <b>is</b> <b>not</b> <b>such</b> <b>a</b> fortuitous occasion for the mimic, and the signals it mimics tend to lower the probability of such an encounter.|$|E
5|$|Even though {{democratic}} {{structures and}} methods are developing there <b>is</b> <b>not</b> <b>such</b> <b>a</b> mirror {{in creating a}} European civil society. The Treaty of Lisbon may go some way to resolving the deficit in creating greater democratic controls on the Commission, including enshrining the procedure of linking elections to {{the selection of the}} Commission president. An alternative viewpoint is that electoral pressures undermine the Commission's role as an independent regulator, considering it akin with institutions such as independent central banks which deal with technical areas of policy. In addition some defenders of the Commission point out that legislation must be approved by the Council in all areas (the ministers of member states) and the European Parliament in some areas before it can be adopted, thus the amount of legislation which is adopted in any one country without the approval of its government is limited.|$|E
25|$|Other authors, such as Roland Paris, {{argue that}} human {{security}} <b>is</b> <b>not</b> <b>such</b> <b>a</b> fundamental recasting {{of the security}} debate {{in terms of a}} central struggle ‘between Realist, traditional, state-based, interest-based, approaches and new, Liberal cosmopolitan, de-territorialised, values-based approaches, which focus on individual human needs. ‘ Rather, he suggests that the talk of two radically different ‘paradigms’ has been much exaggerated.|$|E

25|$|Acetaldehyde is a colorless, {{volatile}} substance with a fruity smell. Although it forms naturally in some fruit, {{it can cause}} an off-taste in bottled water. Acetaldehyde forms by degradation of PET through the mishandling of the material. High temperatures (PET decomposes above 300°C or 570°F), high pressures, extruder speeds (excessive shear flow raises temperature), and long barrel residence times all contribute {{to the production of}} acetaldehyde. When acetaldehyde is produced, some of it remains dissolved in the walls of a container and then diffuses into the product stored inside, altering the taste and aroma. This <b>is</b> <b>not</b> <b>such</b> <b>a</b> problem for non-consumables (such as shampoo), for fruit juices (which already contain acetaldehyde), or for strong-tasting drinks like soft drinks. For bottled water, however, low acetaldehyde content is quite important, because, if nothing masks the aroma, even extremely low concentrations (10–20 parts per billion in the water) of acetaldehyde can produce an off-taste.|$|E

[...] The isolation improvement is greater than the insertion loss added.|$|E
500|$|Many critics {{singled out}} the {{excessive}} use of angled camera shots. [...] " [...] Roger Christian has learned from better films that directors sometimes tilt their cameras," [...] wrote Ebert, [...] "but he has not learned why." [...] Derivative special effects and illogical plotting were also widely criticized. The Providence Journal highlighted the film's unusual color scheme: [...] "Battlefield Earth's primary colors are blue and gray, adding to the misery. Whenever we glimpse sunlight, the screen goes all stale yellow, as though someone had urinated on the print. This, by the way, <b>is</b> <b>not</b> <b>such</b> <b>a</b> bad idea." ...|$|E

500|$|Zero {{was created}} by {{designer}} Keiji Inafune when {{he was told to}} recreate Mega Man for a new series on the Super Nintendo, Mega Man X. He wanted to design a Mega Man different from the original one. However, Inafune realized afterwards that the character he created was too different from Mega Man's old appearance to be viewed positively by fans. Deciding to let another designer work on the character that eventually became Mega Man X while he developed Zero, Inafune created the character intending him to be [...] "the 'other main character' that would [...] "steal all the good scenes". He further described Zero as representing the idea that [...] "nothing is absolute", and circumstances can change anything. When asked if Zero had killed the cast of the original Mega Man titles, suspected due to their absence in the X series, he replied no, adding that given how he had designed the character, [...] "Zero <b>is</b> <b>not</b> <b>such</b> <b>a</b> person--it is not in his profile." ...|$|E
500|$|The zombie {{argument}} {{is based on}} a thought experiment proposed by Todd Moody, and developed by David Chalmers in his book The Conscious Mind. The basic idea is that one can imagine one's body, and therefore conceive the existence of one's body, without any conscious states being associated with this body. Chalmers' {{argument is}} that it seems possible that such a being could exist because all that is needed is that all and only the things that the physical sciences describe about a zombie must be true of it. Since none of the concepts involved in these sciences make reference to consciousness or other mental phenomena, and any physical entity can be by definition described scientifically via physics, the move from conceivability to possibility <b>is</b> <b>not</b> <b>such</b> <b>a</b> large one. Others such as Dennett have argued that the notion of a philosophical zombie is an incoherent, or unlikely, concept. It has been argued under physicalism that one must either believe that anyone including oneself might be a zombie, or that no one can be a zombie—following from the assertion that one's own conviction about being (or not being) a zombie {{is a product of the}} physical world and is therefore no different from anyone else's. This argument has been expressed by Dennett who argues that [...] "Zombies think they are conscious, think they have qualia, think they suffer pains—they are just 'wrong' (according to this lamentable tradition) in ways that neither they nor we could ever discover!" ...|$|E
500|$|Many {{of these}} attacks are {{considered}} to have been scurrilous, including suggestions that {{he was planning to}} [...] "crown himself king" [...] and [...] "grooming John Quincy as heir to the throne". However, Peter Shaw has argued that: [...] "he inevitable attacks on Adams, crude as they were, stumbled on a truth that he did not admit to himself. He was leaning toward monarchy and aristocracy (as distinct from kings and aristocrats) at the time he wrote 'Davila', though he did not directly reveal this in its essays. Decidedly, sometime after he became vice-president, Adams concluded that the United States would have to adopt a hereditary legislature and a monarch... and he outlined a plan by which state conventions would appoint hereditary senators while a national one appointed a president for life." [...] In contradiction to such notions, Adams asserted in a letter to Thomas Jefferson: [...] "If you suppose that I have ever had a design or desire of attempting to introduce a government of King, Lords and Commons, or in other words an hereditary Executive, or an hereditary Senate, either into the government of the United States, or that of any individual state, in this country, you are wholly mistaken. There <b>is</b> <b>not</b> <b>such</b> <b>a</b> thought expressed or intimated in any public writing or private letter of mine, and I may safely challenge all of mankind to produce such a passage and quote the chapter and verse." ...|$|E

500|$|After {{the fact}} pattern, Cardozo began his {{discussion}} of the law with [...] "the conduct of the defendant's guard, if a wrong in its relation to the holder of the package, was not a wrong in its relation to the plaintiff, standing far away. Relative to her it was not negligence at all." [...] Cardozo quoted Pollock on Torts and cited several cases for the proposition that [...] "proof of negligence in the air, so to speak, will not do." [...] Only if there is a duty to the injured plaintiff, the breach of which causes injury, can there be liability. He defended his decision, [...] "a different conclusion will involve us, and swiftly too, in a maze of contradictions." [...] Cardozo posed hypothetical situations: if a railway guard stumbles over a bundle of newspapers, and there are explosives within, will there be liability to an injured passenger {{at the other end of}} the platform? Will the result be different if the object containing the explosives is a valise instead? If there was negligence that day, Cardozo argued, it was only negligence that resulted in the fall and destruction of the package, and there was no wrong done by the railroad to Palsgraf for personal injury, [...] "the diversity of incidents emphasizes the futility of the effort to build the plaintiff's right upon the basis of a wrong to some one else." [...] The chief judge instructed, [...] "The risk reasonably to be perceived defines the duty to be obeyed". Cardozo did not absolve the defendant who knowingly unleashes a destructive force, such as by shooting a gun, just because the bullet takes an unexpected path. This <b>is</b> <b>not</b> <b>such</b> <b>a</b> case, Cardozo held: even if the railway guard had thrown down the package intentionally, without knowing the contents he could not knowingly risk harm to Palsgraf, and would not be liable. Negligence cannot impose liability where an intentional act would not.|$|E
2500|$|Paul Magriel was a {{key witness}} for the defence, contradicting Dr. Roger Nelson, the expert {{prosecution}} witness, by saying, [...] "Game theory, however, really applies to games with imperfect knowledge, where something is concealed, such as poker.

2500|$|Bill Donohue of the Catholic League {{took a more}} {{sympathetic}} tack regarding the issue: [...] "It’s time for everyone {{to take a deep}} breath," [...] he commented. [...] "I have never met President Gee, but it is clear from what I read that what he said was made in jest. Was it dumb? ... yes. But context and tone matter, as does the frequency of what may be considered an offensive remark: a real bigot is someone who repeatedly, and maliciously, attacks others. Gee <b>is</b> <b>not</b> <b>such</b> <b>a</b> man. Political correctness has gone too far." ...|$|E

2500|$|The {{sedation}} concerned {{people in}} Russia {{as well as}} the West that the former Soviet Union was returning to its Cold War-era methods of silencing dissent. Tylik said that he had told her six days before the disaster that the submarine had [...] " [...] 'death onboard,' but he didn't explain what he meant." [...] "I am sure that the commanders of the Northern Fleet knew that the torpedoes were not in order. Those who are guilty must be punished. Navy officials in Vidyayevo later confirmed to The Times and to The St. Petersburg Times that she was given a sedative. [...] "We've been giving sedatives to relatives since this began, and it <b>is</b> <b>not</b> <b>such</b> <b>a</b> big deal as you make it out to be in the West," [...] said an officer who would not identify himself. [...] "We are simply protecting the relatives from undue pain – it was for her own protection." ...|$|E
