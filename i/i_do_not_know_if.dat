500|$|Overmars {{was subject}} to {{transfer}} speculation in early 2002 because of his limited role in the first team, but he revealed {{he was happy to}} stay at Barcelona: [...] "My priority now is that the team wins. Personal issues are not important. I'm here for whatever you need me." [...] In the Champions League, he started in the semi-final first leg against Real Madrid; the team lost 2–0 and were defeated 3–1 on aggregate. In May 2002, Rexach was dismissed and replaced by Louis van Gaal, who was managing the club for a second time. Overmars was wary of the appointment beforehand, saying, [...] "Van Gaal is a good manager, but <b>I</b> <b>do</b> <b>not</b> <b>know</b> <b>if</b> his return would be good for Barcelona." [...] He underwent surgery on his right knee {{at the end of the}} season and was out of action for six months.|$|E
500|$|In 1973, Górecki {{approached}} the Polish folklorist Adolf Dygacz {{in search of}} traditional melodies to incorporate in a new work. Dygacz presented four songs which had been recorded in the [...] Silesia region in south-western Poland. Górecki {{was impressed by the}} melody [...] "Where has he gone, my dear young son?" [...] (Kajże się podzioł mój synocek miły?), which describes a mother's mourning for a son lost in war, and probably dates from the Silesian Uprisings of 1919–21. Górecki had heard a version of the song in the 1960s and had not been impressed by the arrangement, but the words and the melody of Dygacz's new version made a lasting impression on him. He said [...] "for me, it is a wonderfully poetic text. <b>I</b> <b>do</b> <b>not</b> <b>know</b> <b>if</b> a 'professional' poet would create such a powerful entity out of such terse, simple words. It is not sorrow, despair or resignation, or the wringing of hands: it is just the great grief and lamenting of a mother who has lost her son." ...|$|E
500|$|However, {{he persuaded}} [...] John Cockcroft, {{a member of}} the United Kingdom Atomic Energy Authority, to suggest who might be invited to the 1958 conference. [...] He {{successfully}} resisted a subsequent attempt to take over the conferences, causing a Foreign Office official to write that [...] "the difficulty is to get Prof. Rotblat to pay any attention to what we think... He is no doubt jealous of his independence and scientific integrity", and that securing [...] "a new organizer for the British delegation seems to be the first need, but <b>I</b> <b>do</b> <b>not</b> <b>know</b> <b>if</b> there is any hope of this." [...] By the early 1960s the Ministry of Defence thought that the Pugwash Conferences were [...] "now a very respectable organization", and the Foreign Office stated that it had [...] "official blessing" [...] and that any breakthrough may well originate at such gatherings. The Pugwash Conferences are credited with laying the ground work for the Partial Test Ban Treaty of 1963, the Nonproliferation Treaty of 1968, the Anti-Ballistic Missile Treaty of 1972, the Biological Weapons Convention of 1972 and the Chemical Weapons Convention of 1993. In parallel with the Pugwash Conferences, he [...] joined with Albert Einstein, Robert Oppenheimer, Bertrand Russell and other concerned scientists to found the World Academy of Art and Science, which was proposed by them in the mid-1950s and formally constituted in 1960.|$|E

500|$|... "Fermín" [...] {{describes}} a mentally ill character in an institution. The song changes {{a line from}} the French folk song, [...] "Marlbrough s'en va-t-en guerre", from [...] "Mambrú se fue a la guerra, no sé cuándo vendrá" [...] ("Mambrú left for the war; I do not know when he will return") to [...] "Fermín se fue a la vida, no sé cuándo vendrá" [...] ("Fermín left for life; I do not know when he will return"). According to Spinetta, [...] "life for the insane is like war for the sane." [...] Reflecting on the track, Spinetta said: [...] "In front of my house lived an incredible character called Carlitos, a retarded boy, who is in part the personification of Fermín for me. With Carlitos we shared moments of joy when we were kids. Although he could not play ball with everyone, he felt accompanied in his tremendous problem when we were with him. It is also an apology, because I remember that his mother punished him a lot, even {{in front of the other}} boys. <b>I</b> <b>do</b> <b>not</b> <b>know</b> <b>if</b> the degree of illness of the song's Fermín is as actue as that of Carlitos, but serves to define the situation of the alienated as a propitious cell to receive the most aberrant injustices. [...] "Plegaria para un niño dormido" [...] urges not to wake a poor child up, letting him be happy in his dreams. The criticism of society's injustice is, in Spinetta's words, [...] "a complaint made with tenderness." [...] He called it [...] "the symbol of a Christian ideology: neighborliness, solidarity." [...] "A estos hombres tristes" [...] was inspired by the melancholy of Sundays in Argentina, with Spinetta saying: [...] "Sunday was always a sad day, I do not know why. At the same time it was happy because there was football, the family gathered, there was good food. The importance that was given to the weekend in our country in those years was tremendous. But the personal solitude at that time was very clear." [...] The album ends with [...] "Laura va", a baroque pop song which took Spinetta a year and a half to write; Spinetta described it as an attempt to emulate the Beatles' [...] "She's Leaving Home".|$|E

Although their main residence was in Zagreb, they spent much of each year in Vrsar. Of his summer house and studio, Murtić said [...] "It is really nice here, I enjoy the silence and concentration that is irreplaceable... <b>I</b> <b>do</b> <b>not</b> <b>know</b> <b>if</b> I would find a more beautiful place anywhere in the world."
