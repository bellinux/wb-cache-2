But, as will be seen, she was not content with their company.

Still my own wishes were not allowed to weigh in the matter, for there came to me tutors, aged men who might have found better employment, to instruct me in the use of the lute, and on this instrument I must learn to strum. Others there were also, who taught me letters, poetry, and art, as they were understood among the Aztecs, and all this knowledge I was glad of.

The indunas looked on each other and grew grey with fear; and for me, my father, my knees were {{loosened}} and my marrow turned to water in my bones. For I knew well who was that son of a stranger of whom they spoke. It was I, my father, I who was about to be smelt out; and if I was smelt out I should be killed with all my house, for the king's oath would scarcely avail me against the witch-doctors. I looked at the fierce faces of the Isanusis before me, as they crept, crept like snakes. I glanced behind and saw the slayers grasping their kerries for the deed of death, and I say I felt like one for whom the bitterness is overpast. Then <b>I</b> <b>remembered</b> <b>the</b> <b>words</b> which the king and I had whispered together of the cause for which this Ingomboco was set, and hope crept back to me like the first gleam of the dawn upon a stormy night.

I felt very frightened, Glynn. You can't think how my heart beat every time the thunder burst over us. But suddenly--I don't know how it was--the words I used to read at home so often with my dear aunts came into my mind; you know them, Glynn, `Call upon Me in the time of trouble, and I will deliver thee, and thou shalt glorify Me.'

My heart melted, my legs trembled beneath me. On every side were the brutes, great and hungry. And I stood still, with club aloft, and slowly they crept up, muttering and growling as they came, till they formed a deep circle round me. Yet they did not spring on me, only drew nearer and ever nearer. Presently one sprang, indeed, but not at me; he sprang at that which sat upon my shoulders.

What higher things she does not condescend to explain. One or two wives of my acquaintance have persuaded their husbands that these higher things are all-important. The home has been given up. In company with other strivers after higher things, they live now in dismal barracks differing but little from a glorified Bloomsbury lodging-house. But they call them [...] "Mansions" [...] or [...] "Courts," [...] and seem proud of the address. They are not bothered with servants--with housekeeping.

50|$|The {{picture was}} drawn by Lieutenant Kurt Reuber, a German staff {{physician}} and Protestant pastor, in December 1942 during the Battle of Stalingrad. Reuber wrote: I wondered {{for a long}} while what I should paint, and in the end I decided on a Madonna, or mother and child. I have turned my hole in the frozen mud into a studio. The space is too small for {{me to be able to}} see the picture properly, so I climb on to a stool and look down at it from above, to get the perspective right. Everything is repeatedly knocked over, and my pencils vanish into the mud. There is nothing to lean my big picture of the madonna against, except a sloping, home-made table past which I can just manage to squeeze. There are no proper materials and I have used a Russian map for paper. But I wish I could tell you how absorbed I have been painting my madonna, and how much it means to me.""The picture looks like this: the mother's head and the child's lean toward each other, and a large cloak enfolds them both. It is intended to symbolize 'security' and 'mother love.' <b>I</b> <b>remembered</b> <b>the</b> <b>words</b> of St.John: light, life, and love. What more can I add? I wanted to suggest these three things in the homely and common vision of a mother with her child and the security that they represent. He added that he:went to all the bunkers, brought my drawing to the men, and chatted with them. How they sat there! Like being in their dear homes with mother for the holiday. Later, Reuber hung the drawing in his bunker for his unit celebration, which he described as a moment of Christian devotion shared by all the soldiers in his command. When according to ancient custom I opened the Christmas door, the slatted door of our bunker, and the comrades went in, they stood as if entranced, devout and too moved to speak in front of the picture on the clay wall...The entire celebration took place under the influence of the picture, and they thoughtfully read the words: light, life, love...Whether commander or simple soldier, the Madonna was always an object of outward and inward contemplation.|$|E

Naturally, I never got any scholarly use of the languages I was worrying at, and though I could once write a passable literary German, it has all gone from me now, except for the purposes of reading. It cost me so much trouble, however, to dig the sense out of the grammar and lexicon, as I went on with the authors I was impatient to read, that <b>I</b> <b>remember</b> <b>the</b> <b>words</b> very well in all their forms and inflections, and I have still what I think I may call a fair German vocabulary.|$|R
5000|$|Along {{these lines}} Pastor Nee writes that [...] "Luke 24:8 says, 'They remembered His words (rhema),'" [...] {{similarly}} [...] "In Acts 11:16 Peter said, 'And <b>I</b> <b>remembered</b> <b>the</b> <b>word</b> of <b>the</b> Lord, how He said, John baptised in water, but you shall be baptised in the Holy Spirit.'

It was not that Peter tried to recall <b>the</b> <b>word</b> from his memory the events of Acts 1:5, {{but it was the}} Lord who spoke to him, 'John baptized with water, but you shall be baptised in the Holy Spirit.'" [...] Nee holds that this is because [...] "Rhema is something the Lord has spoken previously which He is now speaking again.

[...] —George Lucas, 1977 Since commencing his writing process in January 1973, Lucas had done [...] "various rewrites in the evenings after the day's work." [...] He would write four different screenplays for Star Wars, [...] "searching for just the right ingredients, characters and storyline. It's always been what you might call a good idea in search of a story." [...] By May 1974, he had expanded the film treatment into a rough draft screenplay, adding elements such as the Sith, the Death Star, and a general by the name of Annikin Starkiller. He changed Starkiller to an adolescent boy, and he shifted the general into a supporting role {{as a member of a}} family of dwarfs. Lucas envisioned the Corellian smuggler, Han Solo, as a large, green-skinned monster with gills. He based Chewbacca on his Alaskan Malamute dog, Indiana (whom he would later use as namesake for his character Indiana Jones), who often acted as the director's [...] "co-pilot" [...] by sitting in the passenger seat of his car.|$|R
