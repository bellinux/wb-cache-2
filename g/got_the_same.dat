5|$|P. schultzi {{does not}} respond to prey if the light is under 100lux (like a {{restaurant}} with only subdued artificial lighting), but responds to prey at distances from 6 to 10centimetres as the light level increases. A test suggested that P. schultzi′s hunting is stimulated only by vision, as prey close but hidden caused no response. A preliminary check showed that lures <b>got</b> <b>the</b> <b>same</b> responses from P. schultzi as live prey, and then more detailed testing with the lures showed that: if the target moved erratically, P. schultzi did not pursue it; if the target was totally stationary, the spider approached very slow (between 5 and 100millimetres per minute), with very long pauses in the final stages, and the sequence was not completed in 43% of cases; if the lure jiggled on the same spot, P. schultzi approached much faster and the sequence was almost always completed; if a lure was pulled directly away from P. schultzi, the spider followed, and faster if the lure was pulled, up to a limit (P. schultzi generally moves very slowly).|$|E

In the same year, West Frisian became an official school subject, having been introduced to primary education as an optional extra in 1937. It was not until 1980, however, that West Frisian got the status of a required subject in primary schools, and not until 1993 that it <b>got</b> <b>the</b> <b>same</b> position in secondary education.|$|E

Irrespective of which state the soul is in, it has <b>got</b> <b>the</b> <b>same</b> attributes and qualities. The difference between the liberated and non-liberated souls is that the qualities and attributes are manifested completely in case of siddha (liberated soul) as they have overcome all the karmic bondages whereas in case of non-liberated souls they are partially exhibited.|$|E
25|$|He {{was awarded}} the highest honours then open to British men of science. The Royal Society, who had elected him as Fellow when he was 25 (1851), awarded him the Royal Medal the next year (1852), a year before Charles Darwin <b>got</b> <b>the</b> <b>same</b> award. He was the {{youngest}} biologist to receive such recognition. Then later in life came the Copley Medal in 1888 and the Darwin Medal in 1894; the Geological Society awarded him the Wollaston Medal in 1876; the Linnean Society awarded him the Linnean Medal in 1890. There were many other elections and appointments to eminent scientific bodies; these and his many academic awards {{are listed in the}} Life and Letters.

[...] While Modern Sounds features mostly covers of country and western music standards, its sound and musical style are marked by the heavy rhythm and blues influence of Charles's playing. A considerable amount of the material's melancholy lyrics and words are backed by piano and orchestral arrangements that are rooted in jazz, as well as West Coast and Charles's style of piano blues. Charles {{has said that the}} country album was [...] "completely different from rhythm and blues".|$|E
500|$|Preliminary testing {{indicated}} a [...] "high degree of probability" [...] that the remains {{belong to the}} Tsarevich Alexei and {{to one of his}} sisters, Russian forensic scientists announced on January 22, 2008. The Yekaterinburg region's chief forensic expert Nikolai Nevolin indicated the results would be compared against those obtained by foreign experts. On April 30, 2008, Russian forensic scientists announced that DNA testing confirms that the remains belong to the Tsarevich Alexei and to one of his sisters. In March 2009, Dr. Michael Coble of the US Armed Forces DNA Identification Lab published the final, peer reviewed results of the recent tests on the 2007 remains, comparing them with the 1991 remains, concluding the entire family died together in 1918. Russian and Austrian scientists <b>got</b> <b>the</b> <b>same</b> results. This finding confirms that all of the Tsar's family were accounted for.|$|E
500|$|The result marked Manchester United's first Shield {{defeat in}} 13 years, {{and was the}} ninth time Arsenal had won the Charity Shield. Arsenal became the first {{southern}} club since Tottenham Hotspur in 1962 to win the Shield outright. Wenger described the scoreline as [...] "unexpected" [...] and cited the first goal as crucial in the match, given the weather conditions. He was content with how his international players, {{who had been in}} the World Cup, coped with the game's physicality. Wenger believed the result gave Arsenal a psychological boost for the Champions League campaign, as the club planned to stage their home matches at Wembley Stadium. Bergkamp felt the result showed that Arsenal had what it took to retain the Premier League title: [...] "We've still <b>got</b> <b>the</b> <b>same</b> mentality and that will be the basis for this year's challenge.

500|$|In {{the early}} stages of the album's development, it was {{promoted}} as an album of [...] "high-energy hip-hop." [...] Republic Records later described the album's musical style as [...] "aggressive rock" [...] in the stages preceding the album's release. Vanilla Ice referred to the album's musical style as [...] "skate rock." [...] The album's dark and thick sound fuses elements of heavy metal, punk rock and hip hop. Vanilla Ice stated that [...] "I wanted to express myself in a very intense way, and there was no way it was going to happen with a drum machine. Basically, I'm bored with drum machines and samples and stuff. With a band, they can build the energy around me." [...] Many critics have noticed a similarity between the style of music present on Hard to Swallow and that of bands such as Korn and Limp Bizkit. Vanilla Ice stated that although he knew of the bands, he [...] "didn't even listen to [...] any of them" [...] before he made the album, and he was not trying to imitate the musical style of the bands. [...] "It's just we have the same producer, and some of the guitars between that and Limp Bizkit are gonna sound similar.

500|$|In 1999, the {{ownership}} of Candlelight Records changed hands, with owner and friend of the band Lee Barrett leaving the company. Opeth signed with UK label Peaceville Records in Europe, which was distributed by Music for Nations. Opeth reserved time at Studio Fredman to begin work on its next album, but recording was postponed while the studio was relocated. Due to time constraints, the band was able to rehearse only twice before entering the studio. Delays with the album's artwork pushed the release back an additional month and Still Life was released on October 18, 1999. Due to problems with the band's new distribution network, the album was not released in the United States until February 2001. Still Life was the first album recorded with Méndez, and also the first Opeth album to bear any kind of caption on the front cover upon its initial release, including the band's logo. Allmusic called Still Life a [...] "formidable splicing of harsh, often jagged guitar riffs with graceful melodies." [...] As explained by Åkerfeldt, Still Life is a concept album: [...] "The main character is kind of banished from his hometown because he hasn't <b>got</b> <b>the</b> <b>same</b> faith {{as the rest of}} the inhabitants there. The album pretty much starts off when he is returning after several years to hook up with his old 'babe.' The big bosses of the town know that he's back... A lot of bad things start happening." ...|$|E

Jacqueline Cutler of the Sun-Sentinel hailed the character as [...] "as {{close to a}} role model as an animated cheerleader {{trying to save the}} world can be." [...] Similarly, Rob Owen of the Pittsburgh Post-Gazette joked, [...] "Though a heroine who dresses like Britney Spears ... Kim's <b>got</b> <b>the</b> <b>same</b> insecurities as all adolescents, making her a character kids will identify with", while comparing the character to Buffy Summers from Buffy the Vampire Slayer and Sydney Bristow from Alias. Tracey McLoone of PopMatters believes that the show's [...] "merit lies primarily in heroine Kim Possible", observing that she is a [...] "more self-assured" [...] character than both Buffy and Sydney. Levi Buchanan of IGN described Kim as a [...] "well-fleshed out" [...] character. Scott D. Pierce of the Deseret News dubbed Kim [...] "a teenage Powerpuff Girl", while Betsy Wallace of Common Sense Media also drew further similarities between the character and The Powerpuff Girls, as well as Buffy and Sydney. In review of the film , the premiere of which was originally intended to conclude the series, David Horiuchi of Amazon.com praised Kim as [...] "a teen heroine that appeals to both youngsters and oldsters", citing the character among several other reasons the show will be missed. Meanwhile, reviewing the film Kim Possible: The Secret Files, Horiuchi described Kim as [...] "An Alias-type heroine for the tween-age set" [...] whose [...] "school-girl awkwardness can prove appealing to grown-up kids as well." [...] Netflix crowned Kim the [...] "ultimate crime-fighting teenager". The Sunday Mails Shuhaidah Saharani touted Kim Possible the [...] "Disney Channel's favourite femme fatale".|$|E

Pamela Falk of CBS News described the performance as [...] "breathtaking" [...] and [...] "stunning". Jim Farber of Daily News was also positive about the performance saying that she [...] "delivered a powerful live vocal to the song's musical track". Molly O'Brien of Prefix Magazine commented that the video was [...] "simple and powerful: Beyoncé gives an impeccable live performance of the song... On the album, 'I Was Here' is pompous and a little cloying; live and accompanied by those images, it's <b>got</b> <b>the</b> <b>same</b> change-the-world flavor as Michael Jackson's 'Man in the Mirror.'" [...] Nadeska Alexis of the same publication wrote that Beyoncé belted out her vocals while members of the audience sang along further noting that the moment ended [...] "all too quickly". A writer of OK! magazine praised Beyoncé for being [...] "striking as always" [...] while belting out [...] "I Was Here" [...] in the video. MTV Act's Jose Iniguez described the performance as [...] "phenomenal, flawless, goosebump-inducing, inspiring" [...] adding that it gave him life and made him feel [...] "gobbled up" [...] by the presence of Beyoncé. He added that [...] "I Was Here" [...] couldn't have been a better fit for the campaign and concluded that [...] "Bey was simply flawless.

[...] Mike Larkin from the Daily Mail described the performance as [...] "spectacular" [...] while praising the [...] "virtual galaxy" [...] created on the stage with [...] "lavish" [...] production values, Beyoncé's [...] "spine-tingling" [...] vocal rendition while hitting the high notes and her [...] "fantastic" [...] look complete with [...] "dazzlingly glamorous white frock, which hugged her spectacular post pregnancy body in all the right places".|$|E
