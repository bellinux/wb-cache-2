While Gregory of Nyssa and Maximus the Confessor held that human life already began at conception, Augustine of Hippo affirmed Aristotle's concepts of ensoulment occurring some time after conception, after which point abortion was to be considered homicide, while still maintaining the condemnation of abortion at any time from conception onward. Aquinas reiterated Aristotle's views of successive souls: vegetative, animal, and rational. This would be the Catholic Church's position until 1869, when the limitation of automatic excommunication to abortion of a formed fetus was removed, a change that has been interpreted as an <b>implicit</b> <b>declaration</b> that conception was the moment of ensoulment. Most early penitentials imposed equal penances for abortion whether early-term or late-term, but later penitentials in the Middle Ages normally distinguished between the two, imposing heavier penances for late-term abortions and a less severe penance was imposed for the sin of abortion [...] "before [...] has life".|$|E

To meet the requirements of this application domain, Phantom combines the distributed lexical scoping semantics of Obliq with a substantial language core. The language is based on a safe, extended subset of Modula- 3, and supports a number of modern programming features, including: static structural-equivalence typing, objects, interfaces, lightweight threads, exceptions, garbage collection, higherorder functions, lambda expressions, a keyword binding mechanism, dynamically sized lists, slice indexing notation, and type-safe <b>implicit</b> <b>declarations.</b> This paper presents an overview of each of the key features of the language core, and presents code examples to illustrate how these features are used in practice. email: Antony.

40|$|This {{article is}} based on an {{interview}} study of how ten young male crime victims talk about violent events and actors involved. It focuses on how the young men present their identities as ‘young men’ who have been victims of violent crimes. In their narrations the men struggle with a cultural understanding that ‘masculinity’ is associated with strength and power, while ‘victim’ is associated with weakness and impotence. During the interviews the young men actualize several balancing acts in their presentation of themselves as men and victims, in a delicate manner by use of specific word choice, manner of speaking, laughter, etc. The young men are negotiating a victim identity; they portray themselves by careful positioning as both victims and strong, active young men. By this discursive balancing of identities the young men can be manly {{at the same time as}} are victims. Hence, they do not have to ‘choose’ between the two somewhat conflicting identities. Instead, subtle depictions that accept a victim identity are presented alongside with <b>implicit</b> <b>declarations</b> of one’s masculinity. In collaboration with the listener the participants negotiate how they want to be known; as ‘victim worthy’ young men, with associations to a ‘hegemonic manliness’...|$|R

Some languages do not require explicit declarations, generating an <b>implicit</b> <b>declaration</b> on first encountering a new name. Should a fortran compiler encounter a previously-unknown name whose first letter is one of I,J,...,N, then the variable will be an integer, otherwise a floating-point variable.

Another very helpful feature is [...] "parameter type constraints," [...] which are a way of specifying valid types that function parameters may accept. These checks are still performed at runtime unlike in static languages, but their concise syntax and negligible performance impact make them much more attractive and easy-to-use than similar solutions in other dynamic languages. They can help greatly in catching bugs that would cause functions to malfunction or corrupt data structures if called with unexpected parameter types. A small example is given below.|$|R

40|$|The period since 1945 has {{witnessed}} profound and far-reaching changes in Christian theological attitudes to Judaism. The terrible {{suffering of the}} Jewish people In the Holocaust prompted Christian theologians to re-examine their attitudes, their beliefs and their teaching with regard to Judaism. The thesis centres on {{the responses of the}} Roman Catholic Church to the theological problems which this Issue provoked s, although attention Is also given to the work of Jewish and Protestant scholars as the process of dialogue developed. The thesis begins with an examination of how the Second Vatican Council defined itself with regard to Judaism. The events preceding the promulgation of the fourth section of the 'Declaration on the Relationship of the Church to Non-Christian Religions' (Nostra Aetate) Issued In 1965 are examined and the text Is analysed. The implications as well as the limitations of the Declaration are considered, and reactions to it, by both Christian and Jewish scholars, are discussed. The second section outlines the pioneering work in this field by Karl Rahner and Hans Kling. It compares and contrasts their theological writings on this issue and pays particular attention {{to the ways in which}} they strove to develop Ideas which had been <b>Implicit</b> in the <b>Declaration</b> of Vatican II. The final and longest section of the thesis is concerned with four of the major areas in this field which both Christian and Jewish scholars have debated and researched: the charge of decide against the Jewish people; the problems surrounding the position of the Pharisees In the New Testament; the religious problems posed by the Holocaust experience for both Christians and Jews; and (briefly) the theological and political problems posed by the position of the State of Israel. All these issues have been related to contemporary biblical scholarship as well as changing relationships between Judaism and Christianity...|$|R

40|$|Many dynamic {{programming}} language features, such as <b>implicit</b> <b>declaration,</b> reflection, and code generation, {{make it difficult}} to verify the existence of identifiers through standard program analysis. We present an alternative verification, which, rather than analyzing the semantics of code, highlights any name or pair of names that appear only once across a program’s source files. This uniqueness heuristic is implemented for HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, in an interactive editor called Cleanroom, which highlights lone identifiers after each keystroke. Through an online experiment, we show that Cleanroom detects real errors, that it helps developers find these errors more quickly than developers can find them on their own, and that this helps developers avoid costly debugging effort by reducing how many times a program is executed with potential errors. The simplicity and power of Cleanroom’s heuristic may generalize well to other dynamic languages with little support for edit-time name verification. 1...|$|E
40|$|Some {{contemporary}} Zimbabwean literature {{demonstrates a}} discernible resistance thread. These literary works create fictional life-worlds {{in which the}} ambivalence of colonial land and economic injustices are exposed as potentially mutating and threatening the independent nation. In this way, such works validate ‘nationalist’ corrective measures through inserting a narrative that implicitly refers back to past colonial imbalances. In the choreographed discourses of national sovereignty that characterise the Third Chimurenga – epitomised by Mugabe’s book Inside the Third Chimurenga – there are perceived dangers from infiltrating forces which {{pose a threat to}} the nation’s sovereignty. Britain’s refusal to fund land reform in Zimbabwe is viewed as an <b>implicit</b> <b>declaration</b> of that country’s intention to derail the Zimbabwean people’s movement towards total independence and the ‘fast track land reform’ of the Third Chimurenga. The anti-Britain campaign is inextricably linked to the land question. The cultural sphere (especially its literary, theatrical and musical dimensions) in Zimbabwe’s recent past has been faced with the political urgency of (re) defining the land question. Literary texts such as Nyaradzo Mtizira’s novel The Chimurenga Protocol, theatre performances such as Christopher Mlalazi’s ‘Election Day’ and musical compositions by the war veteran singer Dickson Chingaira are some of the artistic productions that reveal conflicting perspectives on the land and its significance in the people’s search for selfdetermination and national identity. Using the example of Nyaradzo Mtizira’s novel The Chimurenga Protocol, this article argues that whilst many Zimbabwean writers published in the post- 2000 period have attempted to imagine ‘alternative’ national identities, the text’s anti-West thematic and aesthetic texture resonates with the state’s post- 2000 ideological grand narratives of the nation and can therefore be read as the newest form of resistance literature in Zimbabwe’s postcolonial literary oeuvre. </p...|$|E
40|$|This {{exploratory}} study examined assimilated American Jews who became more ethnically identified. The {{goal was to}} identify social and intrapsychic factors which influenced the return to Judaism. Returning Jews served as a natural laboratory for studying the process of ethnic identification and cultural change. ^ Ten young adults, {{ranging in age from}} twenty-five to thirty-nine years old, were interviewed. A case study methodology was used and common themes which related to factors in the return process were identified. The interpretation of the case studies utilized a conceptual framework which integrated psychosocial developmental theory, family systems theory, and psychoanalytic object relations theory. ^ Subjects were influenced by feelings of family loyalty. It was hypothesized that invisible loyalties in Jewish families may regulate self differentiation and impose upon children missions involving continuity and preservation of traditions. Returning to Judaism {{in the context of a}} highly assimilated family was found in some cases to be a form of rebellion. It was noted that this avenue for self differentiation also constituted an <b>implicit</b> <b>declaration</b> of family loyalty. ^ Subjects observed religious rituals but did not adhere to orthodox theology. Their religiosity emphasized ritual practice over belief. Religious observance was found to be used both as transitional objects, for the purposes of self-soothing and fantasy play, and as ritualizations to facilitate adult identity formation. The findings suggested that ritual structure is both psychologically and developmentally useful. ^ Like many neo-orthodox Jews, the returning Jews in this sample were alienated young adults with counter-cultural leanings. These subjects, however, had not made dramatic life changes and they associated their increased ethnic identity with maturation and the need to make adult commitments. This study suggested that ethnic identity may be a source of transitional objects and ritualizations in our society. It was conjectured that ethnic identity will be more likely to be used in these ways if the ethnic culture provides concrete rituals and symbols which can be incorporated into daily living. Directions for future research include investigating the return to Judaism on a larger scale and extending this study to cross-cultural research on emergent ethnicity. ...|$|E
