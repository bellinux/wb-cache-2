500|$|Chen is the {{youngest}} of five brothers of a peasant family {{from the village of}} Dongshigu, Yinan County, Shandong Province, approximately [...] from the city of Jinan. When Chen was about six months old, he lost his sight due to a fever that destroyed his optical nerves. In an interview for the New York Review of Books, Chen said that although his family did not identify with an organized religion, his upbringing was informed by a [...] "traditional belief in virtue that’s present in Chinese culture—that might have some Buddhist content, but not necessarily that one believes in Buddhism." [...] His village was poor, with many families living at a subsistence level. [...] "When I went to school I’d be happy <b>if</b> <b>I</b> <b>just</b> got enough to eat," [...] he recalled.|$|E

[...] "Having been an astronaut gives me a platform," [...] says Jemison,"but I'd blow it <b>if</b> <b>I</b> <b>just</b> talked about the Shuttle." [...] Jemison uses her platform to speak out on the gap in the quality of health-care between the United States and the Third World. [...] "Martin Luther King [...] … didn't just have a dream, he got things done." ...|$|E
2500|$|... "I {{decided to}} build a toy {{instrument}} for him to play with. In my workshop I had some 1/4” mahogany wall paneling, some banjo parts, some mandolin parts, and some pine wood from a packing crate. From these components I fashioned a simple instrument that was somewhat wedge-shaped. Using a mandolin set of machine heads and a mandolin bridge I strung it with four sets of duals over a guitar sized fingerboard. While building the instrument, I realized that <b>if</b> <b>I</b> <b>just</b> left it untuned my small son would be beating on a dischordant set of strings. I decided to tune it to an open chord...G." ...|$|E

2500|$|Foster cites his {{interest}} in bass guitar as coming from hearing Duane Eddy's song [...] "Rebel Rouser" [...] for the first time. [...] "A school friend played the 78 on his parents' big radiogram and it just filled the room with this powerful sound. It {{was one of those}} rare moments when your soul is touched and I realised that the deep sound behind Eddy's guitar came from something called a bass guitar, though I didn't see one until I watched Jet Harris on TV. So I bought an acoustic guitar for £2 and figured that I'd get that bass sound <b>if</b> <b>I</b> <b>just</b> tuned the strings down an octave, but of course it just made a pointless, flapping noise." ...|$|E
2500|$|Regarding SA {{for both}} motor {{movements}} and thoughts, further distinctions {{may be found}} in both first-order (immediate, pre-reflective) experience and higher-order (reflective or introspective) consciousness. For example, while typing I have a sense of control and thus SA for the ongoing action of typing; {{this is an example of}} SA in first-order experience which is immediate and prior to any explicit intellectual reflection upon the typing actions themselves. In this case, I am not focusing on the typing movements per se but rather, I am involved with the task at hand. [...] If I'm subsequently asked <b>if</b> <b>I</b> <b>just</b> performed the action of typing, I can correctly attribute agency to myself. This is an example of a higher-order, reflective, conscious [...] "attribution" [...] of agency, which is a derivative notion stemming from the immediate, pre-reflective [...] "sense" [...] of agency.|$|E
2500|$|In New York, Stuart {{sought to}} return to stage acting on Broadway. [...] "I {{wanted to be a}} theater actress," [...] she said, [...] "but I thought {{it would be easier to}} get to New York and the theater if I had a name than <b>if</b> <b>I</b> <b>just</b> walked the streets as a little girl from California. When I went back to New York with {{somewhat}} of a name, they didn't want movie actresses." [...] Stuart was, however, welcomed into summer stock theater on the east coast, and performed in Man and Superman, The Animal Kingdom, The Night of January 16th, Accent on Youth, Route 101, Mr. and Mrs. North, The Pursuit of Happiness, Here Today, Sailor Beware and was Emily to Thornton Wilder’s Stage Manager—under Wilder’s own direction—in Our Town. But for two years, as many readings, lunches and cocktail parties as she attended, no director, producer or writer (not even Sheekman) gave Stuart a role on Broadway.|$|E

2500|$|When Narayanan {{returned}} to India in 1948, Laski {{gave him a}} letter of introduction to Prime minister Jawaharlal Nehru. Years later, he narrated how {{he began his career}} in the public service:When I finished with LSE, Laski, of his own, gave me a letter of introduction for Panditji. On reaching Delhi I sought an appointment with the PM. I suppose, because I was an Indian student returning home from London, I was given a time-slot. It was here in Parliament House that he met me. We talked for a few minutes about London and things like that and I could soon see {{that it was time for}} me to leave. So I said goodbye and as I left the room I handed over the letter from Laski, and stepped out into the great circular corridor outside. When I was half way round, I heard the sound of someone clapping from the direction I had just come. I turned to see Panditji [...] beckoning me to come back. He had opened the letter as I left his room and read it. [...] "Why didn't you give this to me earlier?" [...] "Well, sir, I am sorry. I thought it would be enough <b>if</b> <b>I</b> <b>just</b> handed it over while leaving." [...] After a few more questions, he asked me to see him again and very soon I found myself entering the Indian Foreign Service.|$|E
2500|$|In an {{interview}} with Swedish magazine Bon, Robyn announced that she had plans to release three new albums in 2010. She said, [...] "I got all these great songs so why not? [...] It's been 5 years since Robyn and I didn't want to wait with a release until they are all recorded, so I decided to start putting them out right away." [...] Robyn told Popjustice journalist Peter Robinson, [...] "It's {{been a long time}} since I actually made a record! And I was thinking of how to shorten that time down and Eric, my manager, came up with the idea of what <b>if</b> <b>I</b> <b>just</b> start releasing songs, then I can tour them, then I can make some more songs. We started working like that. I think once it starts it will make more sense– you can just keep releasing stuff without the long breaks." [...] Robyn collaborated with Swedish producer Max Martin on the song [...] "Time Machine". Martin was responsible for producing Robyn's US breakthrough hits [...] "Do You Know (What It Takes)" [...] and [...] "Show Me Love", which both charted inside the top ten of the Billboard Hot 100 in 1996 and 1997. She said of the collaboration: [...] "It was nostalgic to go back into the studio together. For me, it’s perfect timing– I’ve come full circle. It’s a way for me to show that I’m not trying to distance myself from where I come from. It’s still all about the songs." ...|$|E
