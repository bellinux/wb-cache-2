The pressure <b>differential</b> <b>valve</b> has two chambers (to which the hydraulic lines attach) with a piston between them. When the pressure in either line is balanced, the piston does not move. If the pressure on one side is lost, the {{pressure from the}} other side moves the piston.

50|$|From the {{pressure}} <b>differential</b> <b>valve,</b> brake tubing carries {{the pressure}} to the brake units at the wheels. Since the wheels do not maintain a fixed relation to the automobile, {{it is necessary to}} use hydraulic brake hose {{from the end of the}} steel line at the vehicle frame to the caliper at the wheel. Allowing steel brake tubing to flex invites metal fatigue and, ultimately, brake failure. A common upgrade is to replace the standard rubber hoses with a set which are externally reinforced with braided stainless-steel wires; these have negligible expansion under pressure and can give a firmer feel to the brake pedal with less pedal travel for a given braking effort.|$|E
40|$|Background: Sophisticated shunt valves {{provide the}} {{possibility}} of pressure adjustment and antisiphon control but {{have a higher probability}} of valve dysfunction especially in a posthemorrhagic setting. The aim of the present study is to analyze the clinical outcome of patients with shunt dependent posthemorrhagic hydrocephalus after aneurysmatic subarachnoid hemorrhage (SAH) in order to identify patients who would benefit from a simple <b>differential</b> pressure <b>valve.</b> Methods: From 2000 to 2013, 547 patients with aneurysmatic SAH were treated at our institution, 114 underwent ventricular shunt placement (21. 1 %). 47 patients with available pre- and post-operative computed tomography scans, and an available follow-up of minimum 6 months were included. In order to measure the survival time which a nonprogrammable <b>differential</b> pressure <b>valve</b> would have had in an individual patient we defined the initial equalized shunt survival time (IESS). IESS is the time until surgical revisions of fixed differential pressure or flow-regulated valves for the treatment of over- or under-drainage as well as re-programming of adjustable valves due to over- or under-drainage. Results: Twenty patients were treated with fixed <b>differential</b> pressure <b>valves,</b> 15 patients were treated with flow-regulated valves, and 12 underwent ventriculoperitoneal (VP) shunt placement with <b>differential</b> pressure <b>valves</b> assisted by a gravitational unit. Patients who reacted with remarkable changes of the ventricular width after the insertion of external ventricular drainage (EVD), before shunt placement, showed a significantly longer IESS. Conclusions: Decline of the ventricular width after EVD placement was a predictor for successful VP shunt therapy in the later course of disease. Possibly, this could allow identifying patients who benefit from a simple <b>differential</b> pressure <b>valve</b> or a flow-regulated valve, and thus could possibly avoid valve-associated complications of a programmable valve in the later course of disease...|$|R

The typical compression refrigerating cycle performed by CO 2 involves transcritical operations and therefore the upper pressure needs to be adjusted to the optimal value, that, unlike the traditional cycle, is not determined by heat transfer.

40|$|The {{objective}} was to assess CSF dynamics of different shunt constructions in patients with adult hydrocephalus syndrome and correlate these findings to clinical outcome, neuroradiology, and the specifications of the shunts provided by the manufacturer. Thirty four patients with idiopathic adult hydrocephalus (normal pressure hydrocephalus) syndrome were included in a prospective, consecutive case series. A <b>differential</b> pressure <b>valve</b> (Cordis Hakim standard system) was used in 28 patients and a variable resistance valve (Cordis Orbis-Sigma) in six. A constant pressure infusion method was used; CSF pressure and conductance were determined before surgery. Three months after shunt placement CSF pressure, the "pressure v flow" curve, and gravity induced flow were measured. There {{was no difference between}} mean preoperative and postoperative resting CSF pressures in patients with Hakim shunts. The opening pressures of the Hakim shunts were higher than the value proposed by the manufacturer. A pronounced gravity effect induced CSF flow and decrease of the CSF pressure. In functioning variable resistance valves, CSF dynamics normalised postoperatively. There was no gravity effect and the characteristics shaped "pressure v flow" curve was sometimes seen. Six patients (three <b>differential</b> pressure <b>valves,</b> three variable resistance valves) had non-functioning shunts. Four of these patients were improved after the operation but improvement was transient in three. In all patients, there was no relation between the width of the ventricles and clinical improvement or CSF pressure. In conclusion, the <b>differential</b> pressure <b>valve</b> system does not behave according to the specifications provided by the manufacturer. A decrease in CSF pressure in patients with this shunt was solely due to the effect of gravity.

40|$|OBJECTIVES: Bicuspid {{aortic valve}} (BAV) is {{associated}} with increased risk of valvular degeneration and ascending aortic aneurysm formation and rupture. We sought to evaluate the roles of endothelial dysfunction and inflammatory activation in modulating these processes. METHODS: We performed a case-control study of patients with BAV together with a multivariate analysis within the BAV group to identify factors associated with: development of significant valvular disease; dilatation of the ascending aorta; <b>differential</b> <b>valve</b> relative to aortic disease. Endothelial function of patients and controls was evaluated via flow-mediated dilatation (FMD) and plasma concentrations of asymmetric dimethylarginine (ADMA). Correlations with inflammatory markers and endothelial progenitor cell counts were also examined. Morphological and physiological assessment of the valve and ascending aorta was performed with transthoracic echocardiography and MRI. RESULTS: Patients with BAV (n= 43) and controls (n= 25) were matched for age and gender. FMD was significantly lower in patients than controls (7. 85 ± 3. 48 % vs 11. 58 ± 3. 98 %, p= 0. 001), and these differences were age-independent. Within the BAV cohort, multivariate correlates of peak aortic valve velocity were plasma concentrations of ADMA and myeloperoxidase (MPO) (both p< 0. 01), while increasing age was an independent correlate of ascending aortic diameter (p< 0. 05). Furthermore, both low FMD and inflammatory activation were multivariate correlates of selectivity for valvular disease. CONCLUSIONS: BAV {{is associated with}} endothelial dysfunction. The extent of inflammatory activation (specifically MPO release) and that of endothelial dysfunction impact primarily on integrity of the valve rather than aortic structure.

50|$|However, {{with both}} variable- and constant-flow systems, fully {{automatic}} balancing {{can enhance the}} performance of the HVAC system, eliminating any problems caused by high or excessive system pressures, including noise from the valves and, ultimately, poor control of room temperature. The way the system is balanced will also {{have a major impact on}} energy usage, by minimising pumping costs. In variable-flow systems the use of combination valves, when fitted with a 0 to 10 V, 3 point or thermal motor, integrates the three functions of motorised control <b>valve,</b> <b>differential</b> pressure control <b>valve</b> and a double-regulating valve commissioning set into one product. Applications for this type of product include the control of fan-coil units, chilled beams and air-handling units in variable-volume heating and cooling systems and the control of secondary flow on plate heat exchangers. This integrated approach significantly reduces installation and commissioning costs, since the three control functions are specifically matched to ensure optimum system performance and only one valve has to be mounted in the system instead of three. The problem of high and varying pressure drops across traditional 2-port control valves is also effectively eliminated, ensuring a control-valve authority of 100%. It also saves on space, an important concern in, for example, air handling unit installations where the available plant room space for valve installation is often severely restricted.|$|R

40|$|Introduction: Shunting {{systems are}} {{implanted}} for draining cerebrospinal fluid to treat hydrocephalus, intracranial cysts, and idiopathic intracranial hypertension. Most shunt systems include a valve which regulates drainage. A <b>differential</b> pressure <b>valve</b> opens when intracranial pressure exceeds the valve’s opening pressure. The difficulty with these valves is selecting and predicting {{the most suitable}} valve opening pressure for the individual patient after insertion. Using a valve with a non-adjustable opening pressure requires surgery to change the opening pressure. Potentially, an adjustable valve, such as the Codman Hakim programmable valve, allows non-invasive valve pressure-adjustment for managing over- and underdrainage {{by being able to}} fine-tune the valve's opening pressure to the patient’s changing intracranial hydrodynamics. Objective: To evaluate the use of an adjustable valve in a consecutive, non-selected group of patients. To evaluate its reliance, spectrum of complications, use and effects of opening pressure adjustments and economical impact. Results and conclusions: An adjustable valve has the advantage of enabling trans-cutaneous alterations of the valve's opening pressure as the patients’ clinical course changes during the postoperative period. Pressure-adjustment optimized treatment, and clinical outcome improved following the majority of adjustments. Subdural fluid collections could be managed with pressure-adjustment. The rate of shunt complications was similar to other studies. Valve malfunction was uncommon. Accidental pressure-resetting, other than that caused by magnetic resonance imaging, was rare. Avoided shunt revisions reduce cost. Because we cannot predict which patient will need pressure-adjustment, our preference is to use an adjustable valve for all conditions...|$|R

The selection of patients was limited to children who got a valve implanted {{for the first time}} or where the valve was replaced during the study period. The study period was chosen from 01. 01. 1996 to 31. 12. 2000 (5 years). Therefore the health records of the patients were analysed and all of the relevant surgical data were recorded. The statistical analysis was performed according to defined inclusion and exclusion criteria’s. Finally only the first implantation or change of the valve was evaluated, beginning with the first documented date of surgery to the change of the system respectively the deadline of the Study of July 15 th 2002. This study reflects the results of the existing literature. It was observed that the implantation of VP-shunts are more common, so in 93. 5 % in the group of primary implantations and 97. 3 % in the group of valve replacement VP-shunts were used. In the group of changed valves (n= 37) for 8 patients (21, 6 %) the indication for the valve replacement was „infection“. In the examined clientele the 1 -year survival rate of the valves is at 67. 6 % of the overall patient population of 68 patients. These values are in line compared to the existing literature. Due to the short period of 18 months for follow-up examination only early complications could examined and so a finally answer in case of the valve design can’t be given.

Endpoints were defined as valve failure from infection, underdrainage or overdrainage. 38 patients (24 %) reached an endpoint, 13 (7 %) for infection, 18 (11 %) for underdrainage and 7 (4 %) for overdrainage. Another 21 (%) patients were submitted to a valve preserving catheter revision without further detrimental suites for the valve during follow up. 101 patients (63 %) had an uncomplicated clinical course without any subsequent surgery. There was a significant lower rate of valve survival in children younger than 1 year in comparison to children older than 1 year (69 % vs. 80 %). Valve preserving catheter revisions did not influence valve survival. These results compare favourably with recently published series. The use of a gravity assisted valve in children does not significantly affect the rate of early complications compared to other studies. Valve preserving shunt revisions do not increase the risk of subsequent valve failure. As current data do not support a meaningful impact of any well established valve design on the early complication rate in shunt surgery, this frequently used correlation seems to hold a very low validity and therefore should be abandoned.

First fold reduces noise with wavelet block based thresholding, which affects image object boundaries and texture, {{thereby reducing the}} visual quality of objects in the image. The second fold restores object boundaries and texture from original ultrasound image through wavelet block fusion. Fusion rules and wavelet decomposition level selection between blocks of original US and threshold denoised US image is achieved using gradient histogram based Normalized <b>Differential</b> Mean (NDM) <b>valve</b> for adjacent blocks. Object blocks having boundary and texture are restored at lowest level from original US image and non-object regions from thresholded US image from the first fold. Hard and soft wavelet thresholding methods are incorporated in the first fold. The two fold methods are Adaptive Normalized Diffusion Mean Block Fusion - Hard Thresholding (ANBF-HT) and Adaptive Normalized Diffusion Mean Block Fusion - Soft Thresholding (ANBF-ST) for different block sizes. Four different block sizes are selected for testing such as 8, 16, 32 and 64 for both thresholding and fusion.

In order to reduce complications, to lower revision rates and to better react on physiological changes they are implanted in patients of all age groups. Within three studies we examine the benefits of transcutaneous adjustment, shunt and valve survival rates (SSR and VSR), revision and infection rates and patient satisfaction during shunt therapy with a gravity assisted adjustable <b>differential</b> pressure <b>valve</b> (proGAV, Miethke, Potsdam). Methods We examine the clinical course of patients of the Pediatric-Neurosurgery Department at the Charité-Berlin, who received a proGAV during first implantation or revision between 2004 and 2012. Patients and caretakers were interviewed regarding the number of and their experience with adjustment procedures, satisfaction and necessary revisions (Study I). SSR, VSR, infection and revision rates have been documented first within a broad age range (Study II) and second with a special focus on newborns (Study III). Results The survey of 132 patients (0 - 29 years) showed that 88 % reported improved clinical symptoms after shunt insertion and that of 103 performed adjustment processes 85 % were described as painless or merely uncomfortable. 91 % of the children experienced a reduction of their symptoms after an adjustment and 61 % remained free of revision. After 21. 9 ± 10. 3 months, with a total of 203 patients, 237 implants and 111 revisions reaching the endpoint of Study II, we documented a SSR of 64 % and a VSR of 84 %. While survival rates of children aged 12 and less were lower (SSR: 61 %, VSR: 77 %). An isolated analysis of 93 infants and premature infants (follow up 54. 2 ± 15. 9 months) showed significantly different values (SSR: 34 %, VSR: 56 %), whereas 1 -year survival rates approached the values documented in study II. Furthermore, a significant difference between the SSR of primary implants and those patients that have been previously operated has been documented. Conclusion The proGAV can be used with sufficient reliability for the treatment of hydrocephalus in children of all age groups as well as in premature infants. The transcutaneous adjustability, MRI stability and the moderate revision rates make it a reasonable and well-tolerated standard in the treatment of pediatric and neonatal patients.

In particular, for the first time a piezoelectric first stage actuator is developed to move a servovalve spool using the deflector jet principle; this is especially suited to aerospace actuation requirements. In the new valve the conventional electromagnetic torque motor is replaced by a multi-layer bimorph piezo-actuator. The bimorph deflects a jet of fluid to create a pressure <b>differential</b> across the <b>valve</b> spool; hence the spool moves. A feedback wire is used to facilitate proportional spool position control via mechanical feedback. The bimorph is directly coupled to the feedback wire and is immersed in hydraulic fluid. A high order nonlinear model of the valve has been developed and used to predict valve static and dynamic characteristics, and is described in this paper. This makes use of stiffness constants derived analytically for the bimorph-feedback wire assembly and cross-referenced to finite element (FE) analysis predictions. The model of the flow force acting on the deflector is an approximation of the force characteristic found from computation fluid dynamic (CFD) analysis. The measured characteristics of the prototype valve are in good agreement with the simulation results, and prove that the operational concept is viable...|$|R
40|$|BackgroundChronic venous {{insufficiency}} (CVI) {{of the lower}} extremities is a common clinical problem. Although bioprosthetic valves have been proposed to treat severe reflux, clinical success has been limited due to thrombosis and neointima overgrowth of the leaflets that is, in part, related to the hemodynamics of the valve. A bioprosthetic valve that mimics native valve hemodynamics is essential. MethodsA computational model of the prosthetic valve based on realistic geometry and mechanical properties was developed to simulate the interaction of valve structure (fluid–structure interaction, FSI) with the surrounding flow. The simulation results were validated by experiments of a bioprosthetic bicuspid venous valve using particle image velocimetry (PIV) with high spatial and temporal resolution in a pulse duplicator (PD). ResultsFlow velocity fields surrounding the valve leaflets were calculated from PIV measurements and comparisons to the FSI simulation results were made. Both the spatial and temporal results of the simulations and experiments were in agreement. The FSI prediction of the transition point from equilibrium phase to valve-closing phase had a 7 % delay compared to the PD measurements, while the PIV measurements matched the PD exactly. FSI predictions of reversed flow were within 10 % compared to PD measurements. Stagnation or stasis regions were observed in both simulations and experiments. The pressure <b>differential</b> across the <b>valve</b> and associated forces on the leaflets from simulations showed the valve mechanism to be pressure driven. ConclusionsThe flow velocity simulations were highly consistent with the experimental results. The FSI simulation and force analysis showed that the valve closure mechanism is pressure driven under the test conditions. FSI simulation and PIV measurements demonstrated that the flow behind the leaflet was mostly stagnant and a potential source for thrombosis. The validated FSI simulations should enable future valve design optimizations that are needed for improved clinical outcome...|$|R
40|$|High speed valves have an {{important}} role in many existing fluid power systems and are an enabler for many proposed digital hydraulic systems. One method commonly used to improve the dynamic performance of on-off valves involves modifying the electrical input signal to the solenoids to reduce the inductive lag and eddy current decay. This research examined two commercially available direct actuated and pilot-stage actuated cartridge poppet valves and the role of peak-and-hold voltage and reverse current input profiles on opening and closing switching times. A test stand was built to characterize the performance of these valves. The valves were placed between two high frequency pressure transducers and the pressure <b>differential</b> across the <b>valves</b> was recorded, allowing the calculation of transition and delay time. The peak and reverse voltage duration was tested over a range of zero to ten milliseconds and an optimum response was found at a peak duration of six to eight milliseconds. Peak voltages ranged from 50 to 55 volts, followed by a holding voltage of 12 volts. Reverse current profiles were used to turn off the valves with a maximum peak current of three amps. The reverse current was used to increase the decay rate of eddy currents thus improving the turning off performance of the valves. Commercial valves that had a range of 33 to 55 millisecond turn-on response without input signal modification; these same valves had response times reduced to a range of seven to nine milliseconds after applying the peak and hold method. The turn-off time was reduced from 130 milliseconds to a range of 16 to 50 milliseconds after adding reverse current inputs. This improvement in valve performance can lead to siginificant energy savings due to reduction of transition losses and can widen the useful application of the valves...|$|R
