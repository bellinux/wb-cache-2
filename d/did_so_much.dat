5|$|Kieftenbeld {{was twice}} shortlisted for the Eredivisie's annual Maatschappelijk Speler (Community Player) award, which {{brings with it}} a €50,000 prize to be donated to a social project of the winner's choice. He was {{actively}} involved with Kids United, a football team for children with disabilities. Although he did not win on either occasion, his charity still benefited when the 2015 winner, Jeroen Zoet, shared the prize money {{with the other two}} nominees. In late July 2015, English club Birmingham City made a bid for Kieftenbeld's services that triggered the release clause in his contract. Although Groningen accepted they could not stop him leaving, they were disappointed not just at losing their captain so soon {{before the start of the}} new season, but at losing a player who <b>did</b> <b>so</b> <b>much</b> for the club in the community.|$|E

Environmental education opportunities are available year round through hands-on activities, guided walks and evening programs and lectures. The park also holds educational programs for schools and teachers.

25|$|Both in Brazil {{and in the}} United States—the {{countries}} with the two largest slave populations in the Western Hemisphere—the end of slavery found the regions in which slaves had been concentrated poorer than other regions of these same countries. For the United States, a case could be made that {{this was due to}} the Civil War, which <b>did</b> <b>so</b> <b>much</b> damage to the South, but no such explanation would apply to Brazil, which fought no Civil War over this issue. Moreover, even in the United States, the South lagged behind the North in many ways even before the Civil War.|$|E
25|$|The CAB {{primarily}} {{attributed the}} crash {{to the failure}} of the Swift's pilot to exercise proper caution during his landing approach. The Swift's pilot radioed the Love tower to request a straight-in approach, but he <b>did</b> <b>so</b> <b>much</b> closer to the airport than recommended by flight regulations, he did not state his position, heading, or speed, and he failed to establish two-way communication to obtain a landing clearance. If a pilot could not establish clear contact with the tower, visual flight rules stated that he should only continue the approach with extreme caution under the assumption that conflicting air traffic was in the area. Instead, he continued the straight-in approach {{as if he had been}} properly cleared to land. Due to the lack of communication with the Swift, controllers were unaware of the proximity of the two aircraft until the Swift was spotted from the tower, leaving inadequate time to warn the airliner's crew of the situation.|$|E

500|$|Among other composers {{whose work}} carries the {{influence}} of Mahler, Mitchell lists America's Aaron Copland, the German song and stage composer Kurt Weill, Italy's Luciano Berio, Russia's Dmitri Shostakovich and England's Benjamin Britten. The American composers Leonard Bernstein and Samuel Barber were also influenced by Mahler's work. In a 1989 interview the pianist-conductor Vladimir Ashkenazy said that the connection between Mahler and Shostakovich was [...] "very strong and obvious"; their music represented [...] "the individual versus the vices of the world." [...] Mitchell highlights Britten's [...] "marvellously keen, spare and independent writing for the wind in... the first movement of the Cello Symphony of 1963 [...] clearly belongs to that order of dazzling transparency and instrumental emancipation which Mahler <b>did</b> <b>so</b> <b>much</b> to establish." [...] Mitchell concludes with the statement: [...] "Even were his own music not to survive, Mahler would still enjoy a substantial immortality in the music of these pre-eminent successors who have embraced his art and assimilated his techniques." ...|$|E
500|$|After England had amassed 496 in {{the first}} innings, Australia had slumped to 3/68 with Bradman one of the {{dismissed}} batsmen. Harvey, {{the youngest member of}} the squad, joined cavalier all-rounder Keith Miller. Australia were more than 400 behind and if England were to remove the pair, they would expose Australia's lower order and give themselves an opportunity to take a large first innings lead. Upon arriving in the middle, Miller greeted him cheerfully and said to Harvey, [...] "OK, mate, get up the other end. [...] I'll take the bowling for a while until you get yourself organised." [...] Harvey said, [...] "Mate, that will do me." [...] I couldn't get up the other end quick enough. [...] I watched him play a few overs and I thought, [...] "This is good", and then they brought Laker on to bowl. [...] The third and the fifth balls of Laker's over disappeared over my head, on the way up, and they both finished in the crowd for six[...] [...] [...] I can honestly thank Keith Miller for the confidence he gave me during our partnership [...] [...] [...] and it <b>did</b> <b>so</b> <b>much</b> for my future cricket career." ...|$|E
500|$|Mike Portnoy of Dream Theater played drums on Office of Strategic Influence and Free, {{but found}} the {{experience}} frustrating. Moore regarded Portnoy's {{contributions to the}} first two albums as [...] "great", but he and Matheos decided to recruit a different drummer for Blood. [...] "We were continuing {{to try to get}} new voices involved with the album", he explained. Matheos, a fan of Porcupine Tree, was in control of personnel on Blood and asked Porcupine Tree drummer Gavin Harrison to perform drums on the album. Harrison had a schedule gap {{in the fourth quarter of}} 2008, so agreed to work on the album. He never met Matheos and Moore, recording his drums parts in his recording studio in England and exchanging files with them over the Internet. Most songs were sent to Harrison with programmed drums. [...] "For the most part, we usually told him to try to stay away from the programmed drums and come up with his own parts, and he <b>did.</b> <b>So</b> <b>much</b> of that is his taking it in a different direction," [...] Moore said. [...] "There was probably at least one song, maybe two, where we said 'We'd like you to keep closer to the programmed drums,' but he had a lot of say in what went on." [...] Matheos and Moore were [...] "very happy" [...] with Harrison's work on Blood, and hoped to work with him on the fourth OSI album. Blood marked the first time Matheos played bass on an OSI album instead of recruiting an outside bassist.|$|E

2500|$|Lehrer has {{commented that}} he doubts his songs had any real effect on those not already {{critical}} of the establishment: [...] "I don't think {{this kind of thing}} has an impact on the unconverted, frankly.

2500|$|French {{police were}} criticised for their {{handling}} of the events, and notably for confiscating Tibetan flags from demonstrators. The newspaper Libération commented: [...] "The police <b>did</b> <b>so</b> <b>much</b> that only the Chinese were given freedom of expression. The Tibetan flag was forbidden everywhere except on the Trocadéro." [...] Minister of the Interior Michèle Alliot-Marie later stated {{that the police had}} not been ordered to do so, and that they had acted on their own initiative. A cameraman for France 2 was struck in the face by a police officer, knocked unconscious, and had to be sent to hospital.|$|E
2500|$|As a saxophonist he had {{initially}} {{been attracted to}} the jump and R sounds of performers like Louis Jordan, but soon became drawn into the mainstream tenor saxophone tradition. The German critic Joachim Berendt described this tradition as sitting between the two poles of the strong sonority of Coleman Hawkins and the light flexible phrasing of Lester Young, which <b>did</b> <b>so</b> <b>much</b> to inspire the fleet improvisation of bebop in the 1950s. [...] Other tenor saxophone influences include Ben Webster and Don Byas. [...] By his mid-teens, Rollins became heavily influenced by alto saxophonist Charlie Parker. [...] During his high school years, he was mentored by the pianist and composer Thelonious Monk, often rehearsing at Monk's apartment.|$|E

Ned was a serious student of history -- he wrote several splendid books on this subject -- and of human nature. What he didn't know had never happened.|$|E

2500|$|In 1961, Cook opened The Establishment, a club at 18 Greek Street in Soho {{in central}} London, {{presenting}} fellow comedians in a nightclub setting, including American Lenny Bruce. Cook {{said it was}} a satirical venue modelled on [...] "those wonderful Berlin cabarets ... which <b>did</b> <b>so</b> <b>much</b> to stop the rise of Hitler and prevent the outbreak of the Second World War"; as a members-only venue it was outside the censorship restrictions. Cook befriended and supported Australian comedian and actor Barry Humphries, who began his British solo career at the club. Humphries said in his autobiography, My Life As Me, that he found Cook's lack of interest in art and literature off-putting. Dudley Moore's jazz trio played {{in the basement of the}} club during the early 1960s.|$|E
2500|$|At {{the time}} of his death, Ginter had amassed one of the largest {{personal}} fortunes in the South. His enduring commitment to Richmond is evidenced in his significant investments in real estate, business, and most notably, his philanthropic activity. Even while Ginter was traveling abroad, he reportedly ordered items from Richmond to support local merchants. His will included gifts to almost every charity and public institution in the city. [...] The remainder of his wealth was left to his relatives, including his niece, Grace Arents, who continued in her uncle’s charitable footsteps. Arents adapted the Lakeside Wheel Club into a progressive farm that was known as Bloemendaal, which she later set up to become Lewis Ginter Botanical Garden. She also developed St. Andrew's Episcopal Church, St. Andrew's School, built playgrounds, and funded numerous schools and medical institutions. In 1897, the Richmond Dispatch praised him as [...] "one whose public spirit and broad charity have made his name familiar and honored throughout this city, which he loved so well, <b>did</b> <b>so</b> <b>much</b> to build up and beautify." ...|$|E

His enterprise and energy cleared away the forest trees from the adjacent plains, converted the rich pineries into materials and means for the further development of the town, erected public buildings for the accommodation of visitors, opened highways about the town, improved and laid out streets in the village; excavated, tubed and secured the mineral springs.... He was emphatically the man of his day in this locality, and he made such an impression on the place of his choice, that his name must be co-existent with the history of the village which his energy <b>did</b> <b>so</b> <b>much</b> to develop.
