5|$|In the United Kingdom, the benzodiazepines are {{schedule}} 4 controlled drugs, {{except for}} <b>flunitrazepam,</b> temazepam and midazolam, which are schedule 3 controlled drugs and carry stronger penalties for possession and trafficking.|$|E
5|$|Internationally, benzodiazepines are {{categorized}} as Schedule IV controlled drugs, apart from <b>flunitrazepam,</b> {{which is a}} Schedule III drug under the Convention on Psychotropic Substances.|$|E
5|$|In the United States, benzodiazepines are Schedule IV drugs {{under the}} Federal Controlled Substances Act, even when {{not on the}} market (for example, {{nitrazepam}} and bromazepam). <b>Flunitrazepam</b> is subject to more stringent regulations in certain states and temazepam prescriptions require specially coded pads in certain states.|$|E
5|$|Intermediate-acting {{compounds}} have {{a median}} half-life of 12â€“40 hours. They {{may have some}} residual effects {{in the first half}} of the day if used as a hypnotic. Rebound insomnia, however, is more common upon discontinuation of intermediate-acting benzodiazepines than longer-acting benzodiazepines. Examples are alprazolam, estazolam, <b>flunitrazepam,</b> clonazepam, lormetazepam, lorazepam, nitrazepam, and temazepam.|$|E
5|$|Oral {{midazolam}} {{is indicated}} for the short-term treatment of moderately severe insomnia {{in people who}} have not reacted adequately to other hypnotics, and who have persistent trouble in falling asleep. Because of midazolam's extremely short duration, it is not used for people who have trouble staying asleep through the night; moderate- to long-acting benzodiazepines, such as temazepam, nitrazepam, <b>flunitrazepam,</b> and lormetazepam, are used for those purposes. Midazolam and other benzodiazepines may cause a deterioration in sleep quality.|$|E
25|$|Benzodiazepines, {{including}} diazepam, nitrazepam, and <b>flunitrazepam,</b> {{account for}} the largest volume of forged drug prescriptions in Sweden, a total of 52% of drug forgeries being for benzodiazepines.|$|E
25|$|In a {{retrospective}} study of deaths, when benzodiazepines were {{implicated in the}} deaths, the benzodiazepines nitrazepam and <b>flunitrazepam</b> were the most common benzodiazepines involved. Benzodiazepines were a factor in all deaths related to drug addiction {{in this study of}} causes of deaths. Nitrazepam and <b>flunitrazepam</b> were significantly more commonly implicated in suicide related deaths than natural deaths. In four of the cases benzodiazepines alone were the only cause of death. In Australia, nitrazepam and temazepam were the benzodiazepines most commonly detected in overdose drug related deaths. In a third of cases benzodiazepines were the sole cause of death.|$|E
25|$|Benzodiazepines were {{implicated in}} 39% of suicides by drug {{poisoning}} in Sweden, with nitrazepam and <b>flunitrazepam</b> accounting for 90% of benzodiazepine implicated suicides, {{in the elderly}} {{over a period of}} 2 decades. In three quarters of cases death was due to drowning, typically in the bath. Benzodiazepines were the predominant drug class in suicides in this review of Swedish death certificates. In 72% of the cases benzodiazepines were the only drug consumed. Benzodiazepines and in particular nitrazepam and <b>flunitrazepam</b> should therefore be prescribed with caution in the elderly. In a brain sample of a fatal nitrazepam poisoning high concentrations of nitrazepam and its metabolite were found in the brain of the deceased person.|$|E
25|$|However, {{due to its}} slow rate of {{absorption}} and its {{slow onset}} of action, oxazepam has a relatively low potential for abuse compared to some other benzodiazepines, such as temazepam, <b>flunitrazepam,</b> or triazolam, which have a high potential for abuse similar to barbiturates.|$|E
25|$|Benzodiazepines {{are one of}} {{the largest}} classes of abused drugs; they are classed as {{schedule}} IV controlled drugs because of their recognized medical uses. Across the world the most frequently diverted and abused benzodiazepines include temazepam, diazepam, nimetazepam, nitrazepam, triazolam, <b>flunitrazepam,</b> midazolam, and in the United States alprazolam, clonazepam, and lorazepam.|$|E
25|$|Oxazepam has the {{potential}} for misuse, defined as taking the drug to achieve a high, or continuing to take the drug in the long term against medical advice. Benzodiazepines, including diazepam, oxazepam, nitrazepam, and <b>flunitrazepam,</b> accounted for the largest volume of forged drug prescriptions in Sweden from 1982 to 1986. During this time, a total of 52% of drug forgeries were for benzodiazepines, suggesting they were a major prescription drug class of abuse.|$|E
25|$|A 1985 {{study found}} that {{temazepam}} and triazolam maintained significantly higher rates of self-injection than {{a variety of other}} benzodiazepines. The study tested and compared the abuse liability of temazepam, triazolam, diazepam, lorazepam, oxazepam, flurazepam, alprazolam, chlordiazepoxide, clonazepam, nitrazepam, <b>flunitrazepam,</b> bromazepam, and clorazepate. The study tested self-injection rates on human, baboon, and rat subjects. All test subjects consistently showed a strong preference for temazepam and triazolam over {{all the rest of the}} benzodiazepines included in the study.|$|E
25|$|In a Swedish {{retrospective}} study of deaths of 1987, in 159 of 1587 autopsy cases benzodiazepines were found. In 44 {{of these cases}} {{the cause of death}} was natural causes or unclear. The remaining 115 deaths were due to accidents (N = 16), suicide (N = 60), drug addiction (N = 29) or alcoholism (N = 10). In a comparison of suicides and natural deaths, the concentrations both of <b>flunitrazepam</b> and nitrazepam (sleeping medications) were significantly higher among the suicides.|$|E
25|$|Nitrazepam {{has been}} {{associated}} with severe hepatic disorders, similar to other nitrobenzodiazepines. Nitrobenzodiazepines such as nitrazepam, nimetazepam, <b>flunitrazepam,</b> and clonazepam are more toxic to the liver than other benzodiazepines as they are metabolically activated by CYP3A4 which can result in cytotoxicity. This activation can lead to the generation of free radicals and oxidation of thiol, as well as covalent binding with endogenous macromolecules; this results, then, in oxidation of cellular components or inhibition of normal cellular function. Metabolism of a nontoxic drug to reactive metabolites has been causally connected with a variety of adverse reactions.|$|E
25|$|In a Swedish (2003) study benzodiazepines were {{implicated in}} 39% of suicides by drug {{poisoning}} {{in the elderly}} 1992-1996. Nitrazepam and <b>flunitrazepam</b> accounted for 90% of benzodiazepine implicated suicides. In cases where benzodiazepines contributed to death, but were not the sole cause, drowning, typically in the bath, was a common method used. Benzodiazepines were the predominant drug class in suicides in this review of Swedish death certificates. In 72% of the cases, benzodiazepines were the only drug consumed. Thus, many of deaths associated with benzodiazepine overdoses {{may not be a}} direct result of the toxic effects but either due to being combined with other drugs or used as a tool to complete suicide using a different method, e.g. drowning.|$|E
25|$|In Australia, a {{study of}} 16 deaths {{associated}} with toxic concentrations of benzodiazepines {{during the period of}} 5 years leading up to July 1994 found preexisting natural disease as a feature of 11 cases; 14 cases were suicides. Cases where other drugs, including ethanol, had contributed to the death were excluded. In the remaining five cases, death was caused solely by benzodiazepines. Nitrazepam and temazepam were the most prevalent drugs detected, followed by oxazepam and <b>flunitrazepam.</b> A review of self poisonings of 12 months 1976 - 1977 in Auckland, New Zealand, found benzodiazepines implicated in 40% of the cases. A 1993 British study found flurazepam and temazepam to have the highest number of deaths per million prescriptions among medications commonly prescribed in the 1980s. Flurazepam, now rarely prescribed in the United Kingdom and Australia, had the highest fatal toxicity index of any benzodiazepine (15.0) followed by Temazepam (11.9), versus 5.9 for benzodiazepines overall, taken with or without alcohol.|$|E
500|$|In East Asia and Southeast Asia, {{temazepam}} and nimetazepam {{are often}} heavily controlled and restricted. In certain countries, triazolam, <b>flunitrazepam,</b> flutoprazepam and midazolam are also restricted or controlled to certain degrees. [...] In Hong Kong, all benzodiazepines are regulated under Schedule 1 of Hong Kong's Chapter 134 Dangerous Drugs Ordinance. Previously only brotizolam, <b>flunitrazepam</b> and triazolam were classed as dangerous drugs.|$|E
500|$|Benzodiazepines are {{considered}} major drugs of abuse. Benzodiazepine abuse is mostly limited {{to individuals who}} abuse other drugs, i.e., poly-drug abusers. [...] On the international scene, benzodiazepines are categorized as Schedule IV controlled drugs by the INCB, apart from <b>flunitrazepam,</b> which is a Schedule III drug under the Convention on Psychotropic Substances. Some variation in drug scheduling exists in individual countries; for example, in the United Kingdom, midazolam and temazepam are Schedule III controlled drugs.|$|E
500|$|As {{chairman}} of the International Narcotics Control Caucus, Biden wrote the laws that created the U.S. [...] "Drug Czar", who oversees and coordinates national drug control policy. In April 2003, he introduced the controversial Reducing Americans' Vulnerability to Ecstasy Act, {{also known as the}} RAVE Act. He continued to work {{to stop the spread of}} [...] "date rape drugs" [...] such as <b>flunitrazepam,</b> and drugs such as Ecstasy and Ketamine. In 2004, he worked to pass a bill outlawing steroids like androstenedione, the drug used by many baseball players.|$|E
2500|$|Among the benzodiazepines, {{temazepam}} (Restoril; Normison; Euhypnos), <b>flunitrazepam</b> (Rohypnol; Hypnor; Flunipam), and nimetazepam (Erimin) ...|$|E
2500|$|The carbon-fluorine bond is {{commonly}} found in pharmaceuticals and agrochemicals because it is generally metabolically stable and fluorine acts as a bioisostere of the hydrogen atom. [...] An estimated one fifth of pharmaceuticals contain fluorine, including several of the top drugs. Examples include 5-fluorouracil, <b>flunitrazepam</b> (Rohypnol), fluoxetine (Prozac), paroxetine (Paxil), ciprofloxacin (Cipro), mefloquine, and fluconazole. [...] Fluorine-substituted ethers are volatile anesthetics, including the commercial products methoxyflurane, enflurane, isoflurane, sevoflurane and desflurane. Fluorocarbon anesthetics reduce the hazard of flammability with diethyl ether and cyclopropane. [...] Perfluorinated alkanes are used as blood substitutes.|$|E
2500|$|Drug-induced amnesia is {{intentionally}} {{caused by}} injection of an amnestic drug {{to help a}} patient forget surgery or medical procedures, particularly those not performed under full anesthesia, or likely to be particularly traumatic. Such drugs are {{also referred to as}} [...] "premedicants". Most commonly, a 2-halogenated benzodiazepine such as midazolam or <b>flunitrazepam</b> is the drug of choice, although other strongly amnestic drugs such as propofol or scopolamine may also be used for this application. Memories of the short time-frame in which the procedure was performed are permanently lost or at least substantially reduced, but once the drug wears off, memory is no longer affected.|$|E
2500|$|This {{disorder}} is usually acquired {{in one of}} four ways: One cause is benzodiazepine drugs such as; midazolam, <b>flunitrazepam,</b> lorazepam, temazepam, [...] nitrazepam, triazolam, clonazepam, alprazolam, diazepam, and nimetazepam; {{all of which are}} known to have powerful amnesic effects. This has also been recorded in non-benzodiazapine sedatives or [...] "z-drugs" [...] which act on the same set of receptors; such as zolpidem (also known as Ambien), eszopiclone (also known as [...] Lunesta), and zopiclone (also known by brand names Imovane and Zimovane). A second cause is a traumatic brain injury in which damage is usually done to the hippocampus or surrounding cortices. It may also be caused by a shocking event or an emotional disorder.|$|E
2500|$|Like {{alcohol and}} potent benzodiazepines such as <b>flunitrazepam</b> (Rohypnol), GHB has been labeled as a date rape drug. The sodium form of GHB has an {{extremely}} salty taste but, {{as it is}} colourless and odorless, it {{has been described as}} [...] "very easy to add to drinks" [...] that mask the flavor. GHB produced as a sodium salt (sodium oxybate) may provide a noticeable salty character to the drink, though individual sensitivity to the taste of salt varies. GHB can also be produced as different salts, some of which do not have a taste as distinctive as the sodium salt (e.g., magnesium oxybate), or much less commonly in the unstable free-acid form.|$|E
2500|$|It {{can be too}} {{difficult}} to withdraw from short- or intermediate-acting benzodiazepines because of {{the intensity of the}} rebound symptoms felt between doses. Moreover, short-acting benzodiazepines appear to produce a more intense withdrawal syndrome. For this reason, discontinuation is sometimes carried out by first substituting an equivalent dose of a short-acting benzodiazepine with a longer-acting one like diazepam or chlordiazepoxide. Failure to use the correct equivalent amount can precipitate a severe withdrawal reaction. Benzodiazepines with a half-life of more than 24 hours include chlordiazepoxide, diazepam, clobazam, clonazepam, chlorazepinic acid, ketazolam, medazepam, nordazepam, and prazepam. [...] Benzodiazepines with a half-life of less than 24 hours include alprazolam, bromazepam, brotizolam, <b>flunitrazepam,</b> loprazolam, lorazepam, lormetazepam, midazolam, nitrazepam, oxazepam, and temazepam. The resultant equivalent dose is then gradually reduced. The reduction rate used in the Heather Ashton protocol calls for eliminating 10% of the remaining dose every two to four weeks, depending on the severity and response to reductions with the final dose at 0.5mg dose of diazepam or 5mg dose of chlordiazepoxide.|$|E
5000|$|... <b>flunitrazepam</b> (Rohypnol) (note that <b>flunitrazepam</b> is {{not used}} {{medically}} in the United States) ...|$|E
50|$|<b>Flunitrazepam</b> {{has been}} implicated {{as the cause}} of one serial killer's violent rampage, {{triggering}} off extreme aggression with anterograde amnesia. A study on forensic psychiatric patients who had abused <b>flunitrazepam</b> {{at the time of their}} crimes found that the patients displayed extreme violence, lacked the ability to think clearly, and experienced a loss of empathy for their victims while under the influence of <b>flunitrazepam,</b> and it was found that the abuse of alcohol or other drugs in combination with <b>flunitrazepam</b> compounded the problem. Their behaviour under the influence of <b>flunitrazepam</b> was in contrast to their normal psychological state.|$|E
50|$|<b>Flunitrazepam</b> is a {{drug that}} is {{frequently}} involved in drug intoxication, including overdose. Overdose of <b>flunitrazepam</b> may result in excessive sedation, or impairment of balance or speech. This may progress in severe overdoses to respiratory depression or coma and possibly death. The risk of overdose is increased if <b>flunitrazepam</b> is taken in combination with CNS depressants such as ethanol (alcohol) and opioids. <b>Flunitrazepam</b> overdose responds to the benzodiazepine receptor antagonist flumazenil, which thus {{can be used as}} a treatment.|$|E
50|$|Impairment {{of driving}} skills with a {{resultant}} {{increased risk of}} road traffic accidents {{is probably the most}} important adverse effect. This side-effect is not unique to <b>flunitrazepam</b> but also occurs with other hypnotic drugs. <b>Flunitrazepam</b> seems to have a particularly high risk of road traffic accidents compared to other hypnotic drugs. Extreme caution should be exercised by drivers after taking <b>flunitrazepam.</b>|$|E

50|$|Benzodiazepines such as <b>flunitrazepam</b> are {{lipophilic}} {{and rapidly}} penetrate membranes and, therefore, rapidly cross {{over into the}} placenta with significant uptake of the drug. Use of benzodiazepines including <b>flunitrazepam</b> in late pregnancy, especially high doses, may result in hypotonia, also known as floppy baby syndrome.|$|E
50|$|In {{studies in}} Sweden, <b>flunitrazepam</b> was the second-most-common drug used in suicides, being found in about 16% of cases. In a {{retrospective}} Swedish study of 1587 deaths, in 159 cases benzodiazepines were found. In suicides when benzodiazepines were implicated, the benzodiazepines <b>flunitrazepam</b> and nitrazepam were occurring in significantly higher concentrations, compared to natural deaths. In 4 of the 159 cases, where benzodiazepines were found, benzodiazepines alone {{were the only}} cause of death. It was concluded that <b>flunitrazepam</b> and nitrazepam might be more toxic than other benzodiazepines.|$|E

50|$|Adverse {{effects of}} <b>flunitrazepam</b> include dependence, both {{physical}} and psychological; reduced sleep quality resulting in somnolence; and overdose, resulting in excessive sedation, impairment of balance and speech, respiratory depression or coma, and possibly death. Because of the latter, <b>flunitrazepam</b> is commonly used in suicide. When used in pregnancy, it might cause hypotonia.|$|E
