5000|$|Another {{generation}} of Apple Power Mac G4s was introduced on August 13, 2002, featuring both a new Xserve-derived DDR motherboard architecture {{and a new}} case design, known as [...] "Mirrored Drive Doors" [...] (MDD). All models were available in dual processor configurations running at 867 MHz, 1 GHz or 1.25 GHz. As with the Xserves, the PowerPC 7455 CPU used {{does not have a}} DDR <b>frontside</b> <b>bus,</b> meaning the CPU could only use at most 50% of the new system's theoretical memory bandwidth, providing no improvement over previous models. The rest was available to the graphics card and I/O systems. A single processor 1.25 GHz model would be the last Power Mac G4 the company offered to the public after the announcement of the new Power Mac G5, introduced in June 2003.|$|E
