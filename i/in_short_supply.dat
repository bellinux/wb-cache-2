5|$|The NK 6th Division shifted {{its axis}} of attack {{and its main}} attacking effort to the {{northern}} part of the Chinju-Masan corridor just below the Nam River in the 35th Infantry's sector. The 35th Infantry set to work to cover its front with trip flares, but they were <b>in</b> <b>short</b> <b>supply</b> and gradually it became impossible to replace them. Illuminating flares were also <b>in</b> <b>short</b> <b>supply,</b> and the reserve stocks had deteriorated to such a degree that only about 20 percent of the supply issued to the regiment was effective. Even when employed, the time lapse between a request for them and delivery by the big howitzers allowed some North Korean infiltration before the threatened area was illuminated.|$|E
5|$|After {{holding out}} in Arnhem for four nights and three days, the 2nd Parachute Battalion {{surrendered}} overnight. At Oosterbeek there was around 3,000 {{men of the}} 1st Airborne Division dug in to form a perimeter.

5|$|As {{it moved}} into {{position}} around Bardia in December 1940, the 6th Division was still experiencing shortages. It {{had only two}} of its three artillery regiments, and only the 2/1st Field Regiment was equipped with the new 25-pounders, which it had received only that month. The 2/2nd Field Regiment was still equipped with twelve 18-pounders and twelve 4.5-inchhowitzers. Only A Squadron of the 2/6th Cavalry Regiment was on hand, {{as the rest of}} the regiment was deployed in the defence of the frontier posts at Al-Jaghbub and Siwa Oasis. The 2/1st Machine Gun Battalion had been diverted to Britain. Its place was taken by a British Army machine-gun battalion, the 1st Northumberland Fusiliers. The 2/1st Antitank Regiment had likewise been diverted, so each infantry brigade had formed an antitank company but 2-pounders were <b>in</b> <b>short</b> <b>supply,</b> and only eleven guns were available instead of the 27 required. The infantry battalions were particularly short of mortars, and ammunition for the Boys anti-tank rifle was <b>in</b> <b>short</b> <b>supply.</b>|$|E

5|$|The 1st Battalion was {{unprepared}} {{for a fight}} as it was poorly trained and had no tanks or anti-tank guns to fight North Korean armor. Shortages of equipment hampered the entire division's efforts. Shortages in heavy guns reduced artillery support to the entire division. Communications equipment, weapons, and ammunition was largely absent, large amounts of equipment were en route but the division had been under-equipped in Japan. Most of the radios available to the division did not work, and batteries, communication wire, and telephones to communicate among units were <b>in</b> <b>short</b> <b>supply.</b> The division had no tanks: its new M26 Pershing and older M4A3 Sherman tanks had not yet arrived. One of the few weapons that could penetrate the North Korean T-34, high explosive anti-tank ammunition, was <b>in</b> <b>short</b> <b>supply.</b> The paucity of radios and wire hampered communication between and among the American units.|$|E
5|$|The Muslim {{invasion}} of the Iberian Peninsula in the 8thcentury introduced a style of building developed in North Africa reliant on tapial, pebbles in cement, where timber was <b>in</b> <b>short</b> <b>supply.</b> Although stone construction would later become common elsewhere, from the 11thcentury onwards it was the primary building material for Christian castles in Spain, {{while at the same}} time timber was still the dominant building material in north-west Europe.|$|E
5|$|A small Swedish {{reinforcement}} force {{arrived in}} Trondheim, but both food and ammunition were <b>in</b> <b>short</b> <b>supply.</b> On October 4, the Norwegian forces {{arrived at the}} city reinforced by 1,000 peasants from the surrounding countryside who had taken up arms. When hearing that aid was near, {{the population of the}} city revolted, but the uprising within Trondheim was quickly suppressed. Charles X ordered Lieutenant Colonel Erik Drakenberg to assemble a force in Jämtland and march towards Trondheim, but the relief was stopped by Norwegian peasants that had taken to the hills and defended the mountain passages.|$|E
50|$|The {{effect of}} a {{nutrient}} deficiency can vary from a subtle depression of growth rate to obvious stunting, deformity, discoloration, distress, and even death.

40|$|The {{importance}} {{of light and}} nutrients in regulating phytoplankton growth in the Labrador Sea was evaluating using climatological data, 12 years of measurements made {{as part of the}} Labrador Sea Monitoring Program (LSMP) and physiological information from the literature. Light limits primary production and phytoplankton growth much of the year, even during summer when surface irradiance is at its seasonal peak. Nutrients, nitrogen (nitrate) and silicate, are reduced to low levels in surface waters in summer/autumn and can limit phytoplankton production and growth at this time of year. Nitrate appears to be the nutrient <b>in</b> <b>shortest</b> <b>supply</b> on the Labrador Shelf while silicate is <b>in</b> <b>shortest</b> <b>supply</b> <b>in</b> the central Labrador Basin. Multiyear trends in regional hydrography (increases in water temperatures, decreases in mixed layer depth) and changes in nitrate and silicate supply over the past decade (i. e. increases in nitrate and decreases in silicate) may be linked to changes in phytoplankton community composition and structure (i. e. decreases in large forms such as diatoms and increases in small picoplankton and nanoplankton forms) ...|$|R
5|$|All work {{to put the}} I-185 into {{production}} was cancelled afterwards, even with the M-82 engine, as they were all required for the La-5 fighter. Another reason cited was that the La-5 used the fuselage of the Lavochkin-Gorbunov-Goudkov LaGG-3 which was already in production in three plants and would involve less disruption of the production lines. Another factor may have been that the La-5 required less duralumin to build, something <b>in</b> <b>short</b> <b>supply</b> at the time.|$|E
5|$|Analysis of Estonian {{oil shale}} {{resources}} and mining possibilities intensified {{during the early}} 20th century while Estonia {{was part of the}} Russian Empire. Industrial development was under way in Saint Petersburg (known as Petrograd in 1914–24), but regional fuel resources were <b>in</b> <b>short</b> <b>supply.</b> A large shale oil extraction plant for processing Estonian oil shale was proposed in 1910. The outbreak of World War I, coupled with a fuel supply crisis, accelerated the pace of the research.|$|E

5|$|Desalination is the {{technique}} of removing salts from seawater to leave fresh water suitable for drinking or irrigation. The two main processing methods, vacuum distillation and reverse osmosis, use large quantities of energy. Desalination is normally only undertaken where fresh water from other sources is <b>in</b> <b>short</b> <b>supply</b> or energy is plentiful, as in the excess heat generated by power stations.

Foreign cigarettes and the domestic 727 brand, whose name stands for 27 July, {{the date of the}} Korean Armistice Agreement, are veritable status symbols. Menthol cigarettes are virtually non-existent, but there is competition among tobacco companies to introduce other attractive products, such as fruit-flavoured balls inside the filter to give the cigarette flavour.|$|E

In 1594 another royal survey suggested that £95 of repair work was needed on the fortifications.|$|E

40|$|In recent years, {{consumers}} show {{an increasing}} interest for direct sales of locally produced food. Foodstuff {{that is made}} available via this <b>short</b> <b>supply</b> chain have a positive image. Farmers and food companies from both the conventional chain and the <b>short</b> <b>supply</b> chain must comply with European and national legislation. In the European legislation, a certain flexibility is foreseen <b>in</b> terms of <b>short</b> <b>supply</b> chain, giving Member States the possibility to lay down certain own national rules for producers (both primary producers and processing companies) <b>in</b> the <b>short</b> <b>supply</b> chain. There {{are a number of}} initiatives in our country to assist farm producers in this, such as the ‘Steunpunt Hoeveproducten’, an initiative of the npo KVLV in Flanders and ‘DiversiFerm’, a project of the Walloon Region. In this advice, an evaluation of some food safety aspects of the <b>short</b> <b>supply</b> chain was made, {{based on the results of}} inspections conducted by the FASFC and on the results of analyses conducted by the ‘Steunpunt Hoeveproducten’ and ‘DiversiFerm’ <b>in</b> the <b>short</b> <b>supply</b> chain.

40|$|Purpose - In {{recent years}} {{consumers}} in Belgium {{have shown a}} great interest for foods from the <b>short</b> <b>supply</b> chain. The difference with the conventional chain is that <b>in</b> the <b>short</b> <b>supply</b> chain the primary products are locally processed and sold directly by the producer to the consumer. The <b>short</b> <b>supply</b> chain has different microbiological quality and safety aspects {{in comparison with the}} conventional chain. The {{purpose of this paper is}} to evaluate these aspects. Design/methodology/approach - The methodology consists of analyzing the available scientific literature and results of microbiological analyses on foods from the <b>short</b> <b>supply</b> chain. Findings - The main findings were that Listeria monocytogenes was frequently detected (15 percent) in sampled raw dairy products whereas Salmonella was not isolated in 1, 023 samples. Human pathogenic vero (cyto) toxin-producing Escherichia coli and Campylobacter spp. are potential hazards, in particular for products that are not thermally treated. Data with regard to E. coli counts showed a greater variability in products from the <b>short</b> <b>supply</b> chain compared to the conventional chain. Research limitations/implications - The paper discusses strengths and weaknesses with impact on microbial quality and safety in operation of food safety management <b>in</b> the <b>short</b> <b>supply</b> chain vs the conventional chain. Originality/value - This is the first paper that assesses the risks from the <b>short</b> <b>supply</b> chain vs the conventional chain and that makes recommendations for operators <b>in</b> the <b>short</b> <b>supply</b> chain...|$|R
