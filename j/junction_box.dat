25|$|A major {{advantage}} {{was that}} the adjustment (to set where on the propeller's disc each bullet was to impact) was now in the gun itself. This meant that each gun was adjusted separately, an important feature, since twin synchronized guns were not set to be fired in strict unison, but when they were pointing {{at the same point}} on the propeller disc. Each gun could be fired independently, since it had its own flexible drive, linked to the engine camshaft by a <b>junction</b> <b>box,</b> and having its own clutch. This provision of a quite separate set of components for each gun also meant that a failure in the gear for one gun did not impinge on the other.|$|E
25|$|The EDS was {{distributed}} throughout the vehicle and includes some components in the IU. There were nine EDS rate gyros installed at location 15 in the IU. Three gyros monitored {{each of the three}} axes (pitch, roll and yaw), providing triple redundancy. The control signal processor (location 15) provided power to and received inputs from the nine EDS rate gyros. These inputs were processed and sent to the EDS distributor (location 14) and to the flight control computer (location 16). The EDS distributor served as a <b>junction</b> <b>box</b> and switching device to furnish the spacecraft display panels with emergency signals if emergency conditions existed. It also contained relay and diode logic for the automatic abort sequence. An electronic timer (location 17) was activated at liftoff and 30 seconds later energized relays in the EDS distributor which allowed multiple engine shutdown. This function was inhibited during the first 30 seconds of launch, to preclude the vehicle falling back into the launch area. While the automatic abort was inhibited, the flight crew can initiate a manual abort if an angular-overrate or two-engine-out condition arose.|$|E
500|$|Marcus can hack {{into various}} {{electronic}} devices {{connected to the}} ctOS system with his in-game smartphone. For example, Marcus can modify the personal information of non-player characters to have them arrested, hack and manipulate every mobile phone featured in the game, disrupt traffic by hacking cars and traffic lights, hack into monitoring cameras, and carry out [...] "mass hacking", which hacks the electrical equipment of {{a large group of}} people. Players also gain multiple options while hacking the same object. For instance, if the player attempts to hack a car, they can gain direct control over them, or have the car lose control and crash in a random direction. If the player hacks a <b>junction</b> <b>box,</b> they can choose whether they should deactivate it or turn it into a proximity mine. Unlike Aiden, the protagonist of the first game, Marcus has an arsenal of advanced equipment, including a quadcopter and a remote-controlled car, both of which can be used for remote hacking and scouting. Marcus' apparel can be customized with over 700 articles of clothing, available for purchase in stores that maintain fashion styles unique to what is worn by the denizens in each area. The game features several main story missions, and side-missions known as [...] "operations". Once completed, Marcus' follower count will increase, which {{is an important part of}} the narrative.|$|E

2500|$|This {{contingency}} {{has caused}} the officers of the traffic office considerable anxiety, and strict orders {{have been given to}} the signalman at the <b>junction</b> <b>box</b> that once he has given 'line clear' for a train to run from Barkers Road, cross the main line and stop at Hawthorn, he must on no account alter his signals for a Glenferrie or Hawthorn train until the one from Kew has passed over the junction points. Under these circumstances the Railway Commissioners, faced by the terrible consequences of the Windsor accident, see the absolute necessity of bringing the line into Hawthorn station on a separate set of rails.And this for a line passing though unsettled park lands and terminating in a cutting, beyond which the line cannot be carried except at an extraordinary cost.|$|E

2500|$|The South Atlantic Express, a [...] {{submarine}} communications cable connecting Africa to South America, {{run by the}} undersea {{fibre optic}} provider eFive, will pass St Helena relatively closely. There were no plans to land the cable and install a landing station ashore, which could supply St Helena's population with sufficient bandwidth to fully leverage the benefits of today's information society. In January 2012, a group of supporters petitioned the UK government to meet the cost of landing the cable at St Helena. On 6 October 2012, eFive agreed to reroute the cable through St. Helena after a successful lobbying campaign by A Human Right, a San Francisco-based NGA working on initiatives to ensure all people {{are connected to the}} Internet. Islanders have sought the assistance of the UK Department for International Development and Foreign and Commonwealth Office in funding the £10m required to bridge the connection from a local <b>junction</b> <b>box</b> on the cable to the island. The UK government has announced that a review of the island's economy would be required before such funding would be agreed.|$|E
50|$|There {{was also}} a <b>junction</b> <b>box</b> called the Korg PS-3050, which was for {{controlling}} up to three Korg PS series synthesizers from one keyboard by routing a PS-3001 cable from the keyboard to the <b>junction</b> <b>box</b> and then routing separate cables from the <b>junction</b> <b>box</b> to the PS synthesizers. The other functionality the PS-3050 <b>junction</b> <b>box</b> added was that octaves could be switched on and off selectively for the PS synthesizers, effectively enabling keyboard splits.|$|E

50|$|A typical {{ceiling fan}} weighs between 15 and 50 pounds when fully assembled. While many {{junction}} boxes can support that weight while the fan is hanging still, a fan in operation exerts many additional stresses—notably torsion—on the object {{from which it}} is hung; this can cause an improper <b>junction</b> <b>box</b> to fail. For this reason, in the United States the National Electric Code (document NFPA 70, Article 314) states that ceiling fans must be supported by an electrical <b>junction</b> <b>box</b> listed for that use. It is a common mistake for homeowners to replace a light fixture with a ceiling fan without upgrading to a proper <b>junction</b> <b>box.</b>|$|E
