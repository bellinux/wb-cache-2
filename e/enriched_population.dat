50|$|An {{additional}} study {{involves the}} use of genetically engineered CD34+ hematopoietic stem and progenitor cells. Experimental long-term in vivo HIV gene therapy have had huge issues due to both transduction ending in multiple copies of heterologous DNA in target cells as well as low efficacy of cell transduction at the time of transplantation. This study demonstrated the efficacy of a transplantation approach that ultimately allows for an <b>enriched</b> <b>population</b> of HSPCs expressing a single copy of a CCR5 miRNA. Since positive selection of modified cells is likely to be insufficient below the threshold they found of at least 70% of the HIV target cells resulting in gene modification from efficient maintenance of CD34+ T cell and a low viral titer, the findings show evidence that clinical protocols of HIV gene therapy require a selective enrichment of genetically targeted cells.|$|E

We have established a directed differentiation system using sodium butyrate treatment to generate an <b>enriched</b> <b>population</b> of hepatocyte-like cells from embryonic stem cells. A metabolic analysis of the hepatocyte populations revealed glycolytic and mitochondrial phenotypes similar to mouse hepatoma cells, implying that these cells represent an immature hepatocyte phenotype. To mediate further differentiation, S-NitrosoAcetylPenicillamine (SNAP), a nitric oxide donor, was utilized to induce mitochondrial development in the precursor populations. A comparative analysis of the different treated populations showed that 500 [*]μM SNAP treatment resulted in the {{generation of}} an <b>enriched</b> <b>population</b> of metabolically mature hepatocyte-like cells with increased differentiated function. Specifically, 500 [*]μM SNAP treatment increased glucose consumption, lactate production rates, mitochondrial mass, and potential as compared to untreated populations. In addition, functional analysis revealed that intracellular albumin content, urea secretion rates, and cytochrome P 450 7 a 1 promoter activity were increased in the treated population.

However, the swelling detected in these hamsters was less severe and of shorter duration. In addition, hamsters receiving both macrophages not exposed to Formalin-inactivated B. burgdorferi (Mphi-NFBb) and <b>enriched</b> <b>populations</b> of either immune or naive T lymphocytes failed to develop severe swelling after infection with B. burgdorferi.

The low fluorescent side population comprised only 3. 6 % of all live cells sorted yet contained 99 % of all the neural stem cells as assayed by the formation of neurospheres in culture. Most neurosphere-derived cells are progenitor cells, and these are found within the higher fluorescence (non-side population) fraction.

40|$|Neural crest {{stem cells}} can be {{isolated}} from differentiated cultures of human pluripotent stem cells, {{but the process}} is inefficient and requires cell sorting to obtain a highly <b>enriched</b> <b>population.</b> No specific method for directed differentiation of human pluripotent cells toward neural crest stem cells has yet been reported. This severely restricts the utility of these cells {{as a model for}} disease and development and for more applied purposes such as cell therapy and tissue engineering. In this report, we use small-molecule compounds in a single-step method for the efficient generation of self-renewing neural crest-like stem cells in chemically defined media. This approach is accomplished directly from human pluripotent cells without the need for coculture on feeder layers or cell sorting to obtain a highly <b>enriched</b> <b>population.</b> Critical to this approach is the activation of canonical Wnt signaling and concurrent suppression of the Activin A/Nodal pathway. Over 12 – 14 d, pluripotent cells are efficiently specified along the neuroectoderm lineage toward p 75 + Hnk 1 + Ap 2 + neural crest-like cells with little or no contamination by Pax 6 + neural progenitors. This cell population can be clonally amplified and maintained for > 25 passages (> 100 d) while retaining the capacity to differentiate into peripheral neurons, smooth muscle cells, and mesenchymal precursor cells. Neural crest-like stem cell-derived mesenchymal precursors have the capacity for differentiation into osteocytes, chondrocytes, and adipocytes. In sum, we have developed methods for the efficient generation of self-renewing neural crest stem cells that greatly enhance their potential utility in disease modeling and regenerative medicine...|$|E
40|$|Although the {{pathogenesis}} of atopic dermatitis (AD) is unknown, many immunologic abnormalities such as high levels of serum IgE and increase of IgE Fc receptor-positive lymphocytes have been demonstrated. Recently, interleukin 4 (IL- 4) {{has been shown to}} induce enormously the production of IgE and to enhance the expression of IgE Fc receptor by B cells, suggesting the possible involvement of IL- 4 in {{the pathogenesis}} of AD. We examined IL- 4 responsiveness or interleukin 2 (IL- 2) responsiveness of peripheral blood mono- nuclear cells of 31 patients with AD, 19 healthy individuals, and seven patients with other skin diseases. We found that IL- 4 responsiveness of AD was higher than that of non-AD control, although IL- 2 responsiveness of AD showed no significant change. However, the value of the IL- 4 responsiveness did not significantly correlate with the clinical severity, personal history of respiratory allergy, serum IgE level, or clinical course of patients with AD. The hyperresponsiveness to IL- 4 detected in AD was not likely to be due to the effects of steroids or anti-mast cell drugs because the value of IL- 4 responsiveness was significantly low, compared to AD, in patients with other skin diseases who were treated similarly. Because the T-cell – <b>enriched</b> <b>population,</b> but not the B-cell – <b>enriched</b> <b>population,</b> showed significant proliferation in response to exogeneous IL- 4 or IL- 2, T cells were the main population that reacted in our proliferation assay.

40|$|In early {{embryonic}} development, spatial gradients of diffusible signaling molecules play {{important roles}} in controlling differentiation of cell types or arrays in diverse tissues. Thus, the concentration of exogenous cytokines or growth factors {{at any given time}} is crucial to the formation of an <b>enriched</b> <b>population</b> of a desired cell type from primitive stem cells in vitro. Microfluidic technology has proven very useful in the creation of cell-friendly microenvironments. Such techniques are, however, currently limited to a few cell types. Improved versatility is required if these systems are to become practically applicable to stem cells showing various plasticity ranges. Here, we built a microfluidic platform in which cells can be exposed to stable concentration gradients of various signaling molecules {{for more than a week}} with only minimal handling and no external power source. To maintain stability of the gradient concentration, the osmotic pumping performance was optimized by balancing the capillary action and hydraulic pressure in the inlet reagent reservoirs.
