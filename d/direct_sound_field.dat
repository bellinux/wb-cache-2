2500|$|Direct-field {{acoustic}} testing, or DFAT, is {{a technique}} used for acoustic testing of aerospace structures by subjecting them to sound waves created by an array of acoustic drivers. The method uses electro-dynamic acoustic speakers, arranged around the test article to provide a uniform, well-controlled, <b>direct</b> <b>sound</b> <b>field</b> at {{the surface of the}} unit under test. The system employs high capability acoustic drivers, powerful audio amplifiers, a narrow-band multiple-input-multiple-output (MIMO) controller and precision laboratory microphones to produce an acoustic environment that can simulate a helicopter, aircraft, jet engine or launch vehicle sound pressure field. A high level system is capable of overall sound pressure levels in the 125–147dB for more than one minute over a frequency range from 25Hz to 10kHz.|$|E

The proposed formulation relies on an ensemble of elementary directivity functions {{based on a}} subset of spherical harmonics. These can be combined to create and manipulate directivity characteristics of the synthesized virtual sources. The WFS formulation introduces artifacts in the synthesized sound field for both ideal and real loudspeakers. These artifacts can be partly compensated for using dedicated equalization techniques. A multichannel equalization technique is shown to provide accurate results thus enabling for the manipulation of directional sources with limited reconstruction artifacts.

40|$|State-of-the-art stereo {{recording}} techniques {{using two}} microphones have two main disadvantages: first, a limited {{reduction of the}} reverberation in the <b>direct</b> <b>sound</b> component, and second, compression or expansion of the angular position of sound sources. To address these disadvantages, {{the aim of this}} study is the development of a true stereo recording microphone array that aims to record the <b>direct</b> and reverberant <b>sound</b> <b>field</b> separately. This array can be used within the recording and playback configuration developed in Grosse and van de Par, 2015. Instead of using only two microphones, the proposed method combines two logarithmically-spaced microphone arrays, whose directivity patterns are optimized with a superdirective beamforming algorithm. The optimization allows us to have a better control of the overall beam pattern and of interchannel level differences.

40|$|Objective. To compare {{hearing and}} speech {{understanding}} between a new, nonskin penetrating Baha system (Baha Attract) {{to the current}} Baha system using a skin-penetrating abutment. Methods. Hearing and speech understanding were measured in 16 experienced Baha users. The transmission path via the abutment was compared to a simulated Baha Attract transmission path by attaching the implantable magnet to the abutment and then by adding a sample of artificial skin and the external parts of the Baha Attract system. Four different measurements were performed: bone conduction thresholds directly through the <b>sound</b> processor (BC <b>Direct),</b> aided <b>sound</b> <b>field</b> thresholds, aided speech understanding in quiet, and aided speech understanding in noise. Results. The simulated Baha Attract transmission path introduced an attenuation starting from approximately 5 [*]dB at 1000 [*]Hz, increasing to 20 – 25 [*]dB above 6000 [*]Hz. However, aided <b>sound</b> <b>field</b> threshold shows smaller differences and aided speech understanding in quiet and in noise does not differ significantly between the two transmission paths. Conclusion. The Baha Attract system transmission path introduces predominately high frequency attenuation. This attenuation can be partially compensated by adequate fitting of the speech processor. No significant decrease in speech understanding in either quiet or in noise was found...|$|R

The motivation for the work presented here was to analyse the possibilities for quantitative acoustic measurements in an environement that was not designed for acoustic measurements and where reverberations, shear layer refraction and turbulence distort the sound field. Extensive acoustic measurements were performed using a linear microphone array with 104 microphones {{on the floor of}} the hall. Room acoustics effects were investigated with a reference sound source and the sound field of the rotors was measured for different configurations. The results show that reflections fron the ceiling and side walls interfere with the <b>direct</b> <b>sound</b> <b>field</b> and influence the measure directivity due to strong local variations of the sound pressure level from one microphone position to the next.

40|$|ABSTRACT: The {{problem of}} {{predicting}} the {{sound pressure level}} distribution inside a large acoustic space due {{to one or more}} sound sources is examined using a development of Statistical Energy Analysis (SEA). The resulting model may be applied to predict the sound field inside an industrial workroom. The prediction method is based on a separate treatment of the direct and reverberant sound fields. The <b>direct</b> <b>sound</b> <b>field</b> is dealt with by assuming free-field propagation, with the application of corrections such as barrier theory as required. The reverberant field is analysed using the SEA framework with the power input corrected for energy lost at the first reflection. The total sound pressure level at any receiver point is given as the sum of the direct and reverberant fields. Measurements made in a workroom using experimental SEA methods, with the acoustic space considered as being divided into three distinct subsystems, demonstrated that the presence of a direct field can also significantly affect the experimental SEA procedure. Comparing measured and theoretically predicted SEA parameters, it is found that the coupling loss factors are in good agreement, but the damping loss factors estimated from published absorption coefficients for the surfaces and fittings agreed less well with the measured data...|$|E

Sound engineers play back these recordings through loudspeakers in sound control rooms for audio CD or film. The acoustical properties of these rooms influence the perceived acoustics of the live recording. To find the practical impact of ‘room in room’ acoustics in general, combinations of random room acoustic impulse responses using convolution techniques have been investigated. To find the practical impact of a sound control room on the acoustical parameter values of a concert hall when played back in that control room, combinations of concert hall impulse responses and sound control room impulse responses have been investigated. It is found that to accurately reproduce a steady sound energy decay rate (related to the reverberation time), the playback room {{should have at least}} twice this decay rate, under diffuse sound field conditions. For energy modulations (related to speech intelligibility) this decay rate should be more than four times higher. Finally, initial energy ratios (related to definition and clarity) require auditive judgement in the <b>direct</b> <b>sound</b> <b>field.</b> ITU-recommendations used for sound control room design are sufficient for reverberation and speech intelligibility judgement of concert hall recordings.

40|$|Exposure of sailors to {{high levels}} of noise in the {{aircraft}} carrier deck environment is a problem that has serious human and economic consequences. A variety of approaches to quieting exhausting jets from high-performance aircraft are undergoing development. However, testing of noise abatement solutions at full-scale may be prohibitively costly when many possible nozzle treatments are under consideration. A relatively efficient and accurate means of predicting the noise levels resulting from engine-quieting technologies at personnel locations is needed. This is complicated by the need to model both the direct and the scattered sound field {{in order to determine the}} resultant spectrum and levels. While the <b>direct</b> <b>sound</b> <b>field</b> may be obtained using CFD plus surface integral methods such as the Ffowcs-Williams Hawkings method, the scattered sound field is complicated by its dependence on the geometry of the scattering surface [...] -the aircraft carrier deck, aircraft control surfaces and other nearby structures. ^ In this work, a time-domain boundary element method, or TD-BEM, (sometimes referred to in terms of source panels) is proposed and developed that takes advantage of and offers beneficial effects for the substantial planar components of the aircraft carrier deck environment and uses pressure gradients as its input. This method is applied to and compared with analytical results for planar surfaces, corners and spherical surfaces using an analytic point source as input. The method can also accept input from CFD data on an acoustic data surface by using the G 1 A pressure gradient formulation to obtain pressure gradients on the surface from the flow variables contained on the acoustic data surface. The method is also applied to a planar scattering surface characteristic of an aircraft carrier flight deck with an acoustic data surface from a supersonic jet large eddy simulation, or LES, as input to the scattering model. In this way, the process for modeling the complete sound field (assuming the availability of an acoustic data surface from a time-realized numerical simulation of the jet flow field) is outlined for a realistic group of source location, scattering surface location and observer locations. ^ The method was able to successfully model planar cases, corners and spheres with a level of error that is low enough for some engineering purposes. Significant benefits were realized for fully planar surfaces including high parallelizability and avoidance of interaction between portions of the paneled boundary. When the jet large eddy simulation case was considered the method was able to capture a substantial portion of the spectrum including the peak frequency region and a majority of the spectral energy with good fidelity. ...|$|E

In this study a perceptually motivated approach for spatial audio reproduction is developed. This approach optimizes the spatial and monaural cues of the <b>direct</b> and reverberant <b>sound</b> separately. More specifically, the (monaural) spectral cues responsible for the timbre and the (binaural) interaural cross correlation (IACC) cues, responsible for the listener envelopment, were optimized in the playback room to restore the auditory impression of the recording room. The <b>direct</b> <b>sound</b> recorded close to the source is processed with an auditory motivated gammatone filterbank such that the spectral cues, ITD’s and ILD’s are comparable to the <b>direct</b> <b>sound</b> in the recording room. Additionally, the reverberant sound, which was recorded at two distant locations from the source, is played back via dipole loudspeakers. Due to the arrangement of the two dipole loudspeakers, only the diffuse <b>sound</b> <b>field</b> in the playback room is excited, therefore the spectral cues and the IACC of the reverberant <b>sound</b> <b>field</b> can be controlled independently to match the cues that were present in the recording room. As indicated by a preliminary listening test the applied optimization is perceptually similar to the reference signal and is generally preferred when compared to a conventional room-in-room reproduction.

40|$|This paper {{discusses}} {{the concept of}} the reverberation radius, also known as critical distance, in rooms with non-uniformly distributed sound absorption. The reverberation radius is the distance from a sound source at which the <b>direct</b> <b>sound</b> level equals the reflected sound level. The currently used formulas to calculate the reverberation radius have been derived by the classic theories of Sabine or Eyring. However, these theories are only valid in perfectly diffused sound fields; thus, only when the energy density is constant throughout a room.

First, different shaped rooms with smooth walls are modeled and simulated to investigate the effects of room shape on the sound quality, and then hyperboloid cells are made on the walls to examine the influence of fine structural surface on sound quality with both regular and random arrangements. It is found that the reverberation time is affected significantly by the room shape while is not sensitive to the hyperboloid cells. The <b>sound</b> <b>field</b> distribution is affected little by the room shape and the hyperboloid cells and the difference is smaller than the Just-Noticeable-Difference in most cases. The impact of the room shape and fine structural surface on the speech transmission index mainly lies in the transition area between the <b>direct</b> <b>sound</b> and the reverberant sound. The reliability of the simulation remarks is confirmed by the experiments carried out in two different meeting rooms.

40|$|This {{dissertation}} {{seeks to}} advance {{the current state of}} computer-based <b>sound</b> <b>field</b> simulations for room acoustics. The first part of the dissertation assesses the reliability of geometric sound-field simulations, which are approximate in nature. The second part of the dissertation uses the rigorous boundary element method (BEM) to learn more about reflections from finite reflectors: planar and non-planar. ^ Acoustical designers commonly use geometric simulations to predict <b>sound</b> <b>fields</b> quickly. Geometric simulation of reflections from rough surfaces is still under refinement. The first project in this dissertation investigates the scattering coefficient, which quantifies the degree of diffuse reflection from rough surfaces. The main result is that predicted reverberation time varies inversely with scattering coefficient if the <b>sound</b> <b>field</b> is nondiffuse. Additional results include a flow chart that enables acoustical designers to gauge how sensitive predicted results are to their choice of scattering coefficient. ^ Geometric acoustics is a high-frequency approximation to wave acoustics. At low frequencies, more pronounced wave phenomena cause deviations between real-world values and geometric predictions. Acoustical designers encounter the limits of geometric acoustics in particular when simulating the low frequency response from finite suspended reflector panels. This dissertation uses the rigorous BEM to develop an improved low-frequency radiation model for smooth, finite reflectors. The improved low frequency model is suggested in two forms for implementation in geometric models. ^ Although BEM simulations require more computation time than geometric simulations, BEM results are highly accurate. The final section of this dissertation uses the BEM to investigate the <b>sound</b> <b>field</b> around non-planar reflectors. The author has added convex edges rounded away from the source side of finite, smooth reflectors to minimize coloration of reflections caused by interference from boundary waves. Although the coloration could not be fully eliminated, the convex edge increases the sound energy reflected into previously nonspecular zones. This excess reflected energy is marginally audible using a standard of 20 dB below <b>direct</b> <b>sound</b> energy. The convex-edged panel is recommended for use when designers want to extend reflected energy spatially beyond the specular reflection zone of a planar panel. ...|$|R

Key differences between small critical listening spaces and large auditoria are the vastly different ranges of energy decay, 100 ms for the former and up to 8 s for the latter, and its directional behaviour, typically non-diffuse for the former and approximating a diffuse field for the latter. Despite these substantial differences, most of the metrics developed to describe the <b>sound</b> <b>field</b> in large spaces are evoked to quantify the performance of small rooms. This project focuses on developing measurement methods to characterise temporal and spatial qualities of sound in small rooms. A number of methods based on currently available acoustic probes have been developed. The implementation requisites and accuracy for each method has been quantified. Factors such as direction, time of arrival and strength of reflections have been extracted using signal analysis techniques based on the active instantaneous intensity and short-time Fourier transform. These factors are subsequently mapped to allow a description of their evolution through the energy decay in the room for a given measurement location. The best performing system, based {{on the use of}} one-dimensional p-p intensity probe mounted in a custom cradle, achieves a minimum overall mean error of 0. 226 degrees and 2. 971 degrees for the <b>direct</b> <b>sound</b> and first reflection respectively, which is near or below the measured human minimum audible angle (MAA). The method developed has direct applications in the quantification of small room acoustic <b>sound</b> <b>fields</b> for critical listening purposes...|$|R
40|$|The Wave Based Method (WBM) is used {{to predict}} the {{airborne}} and structure-borne sound insulation of building structures. In building acoustics, the frequency range of interest is 50 - 5000 Hz. Prediction models in building acoustics often assume infinite structures (like the transfer matrix method) or diffuse <b>sound</b> <b>fields</b> (statistical energy methods). These models cannot explain the inter-laboratory differences typically encountered in the lower frequency range. A wave based prediction model has therefore been developed to describe the <b>direct</b> <b>sound</b> transmission through a structure placed between two reverberant rooms. The rectangular geometry, often encountered in buildings, allows to introduce numerical simplifications which make computations up to 3150 Hz possible on a standard desktop pc. The WBM results are validated with airborne and structure-borne sound insulation measurements of single and double wall structures and a sandwich element. status: publishe...|$|R
40|$|We {{study the}} spatialization of the <b>sound</b> <b>field</b> in a room, in {{particular}} the evolution of room impulse responses as function of their spatial positions. The presented technique allows us to completely characterize the <b>sound</b> <b>field</b> in any arbitrary location if the <b>sound</b> <b>field</b> is known in a certain finite number of positions. In this paper, we include an analytical solution of the problem for any rectangular room. Further results on reconstruction of the <b>sound</b> <b>field</b> by interpolation of the Plenacoustic function are discussed...|$|R
40|$|In this paper, {{we study}} the spatialization of the <b>sound</b> <b>field</b> in rooms, in {{particular}} {{the evolution of the}} room impulse responses in function of their spatial positions. Thanks to this study, we are now able to predict the <b>sound</b> <b>field</b> in any position knowing the <b>sound</b> <b>field</b> in a certain number of positions in the room. If enough measurements are taken, we are able to completely characterize the <b>sound</b> <b>field</b> of the room at any arbitrary location. The existing techniques usually make use of models of the room in order to recreate the <b>sound</b> <b>field</b> present {{at some point in the}} room. The models take in consideration the different walls materials, obstacles present in the room, etc. Our technique simply starts from the measurements of the room impulse response in a finite number of positions and starting from this information the total <b>sound</b> <b>field</b> is then recreated. Further, we determine the number and the spacing between the microphones needed to reconstruct the <b>sound</b> <b>field</b> in a room up to a certain temporal frequency. We give a link between the temporal frequency of the sound and the spatial frequency of the sensors (microphones) in order to reconstruct the <b>sound</b> <b>field...</b>|$|R
