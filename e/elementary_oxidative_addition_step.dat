50|$|In {{most cases}} the <b>oxidative</b> <b>Addition</b> is the rate {{determining}} step of the catalytic cycle. During this step, the palladium catalyst is oxidized from palladium(0) to palladium(II). The palladium catalyst 1 is coupled with the alkyl halide 2 to yield an organopalladium complex 3. As seen in the diagram below, the <b>oxidative</b> <b>addition</b> <b>step</b> breaks the carbon-halogen bond where the palladium is now bound to both the halogen and the R group.|$|R
50|$|The Suzuki Coupling {{occurs with}} {{retention}} of configuration on the double bonds {{for both the}} organoboron reagent or the halide. However, the configuration of that double bond, cis or trans {{is determined by the}} cis-to-trans isomerization of the palladium complex in the <b>oxidative</b> <b>addition</b> <b>step</b> where the trans palladium complex is the predominant form. When the organoboron is attached to a double bond and it is coupled to an alkenyl halide the product is a diene as shown below.|$|R
50|$|The {{mechanism}} for the Hiyama coupling follows a catalytic cycle, including an A) <b>oxidative</b> <b>addition</b> <b>step,</b> in which the organichalide adds to the palladium oxidizing the metal from palladium(0) to palladium(II); a B) transmetalation step, in which the C-Si bond is broken and the second carbon fragment is bound to the palladium center; and finally C) a reductive elimination step, in which the C-C bond is formed and the palladium returns to its zero-valent state to start the cycle over again. The catalytic cycle is shown below.|$|R
50|$|Although {{the high}} {{reactivity}} of the ligand {{is not completely}} understood, Buchwald et al. suggest some structural {{factors that contribute to}} their effectiveness: the electron rich phosphine group may help the acceleration of the <b>oxidative</b> <b>addition</b> <b>step,</b> the steric bulk of the ligands may accelerate the C-N bond forming reductive elimination, and the π-system of the ortho aromatic group on the ligand may participate in an interaction with the unoccupied metal d-orbital. Another hypothesis is that the metal-arene interaction could stabilize the catalyst. The arene from the aryl halide is forced to orient perpendicularly to the N-Pd bond, which should stereoelectronically favor reductive elimination.|$|R

DFT calculations showed a cooperative hydrogen-bonding array between the urea moiety and the hydroxyl group of the allyl alcohol, which strengthens the hydrogen bond between the O-H moiety of the coordinated allyl-alcohol and the carbonyl-moiety of the ligand. This hydrogen bond pattern facilitates the (rate-limiting) C-O <b>oxidative</b> <b>addition</b> <b>step</b> and leads to lower energy isomers throughout the catalytic cycle, clarifying the role of the urea-moiety...|$|R
40|$|Mechanistic {{studies of}} the Heck-Mizoroki {{reaction}} of a vinylboronate ester with electronically different (four-substituted) aryl iodides shows that electron donors accelerate the cross-coupling, demonstrating that the <b>oxidative</b> <b>addition</b> <b>step</b> is not rate determining {{and that there is}} development of some degree of positive charge in the rate determining step. These results were used as a basis to allow the development of reaction conditions for the Heck-Mizoroki coupling of a hindered vinylboronate ester with electron deficient methyl cis- 2 -iodoacrylate.

The results demonstrated that this cross-coupling reaction is catalyzed by soluble species. Furthermore, it is {{shown that the}} palladium leaching is not initiated by the <b>oxidative</b> <b>addition</b> <b>step</b> but rather by palladium-decoordination from grafted ligand. Despite this decoordination, catalyst performance after recycling is adequate. Additionally, several parameters linked either to catalyst preparation or reaction procedures were shown to reduce leaching allowing one to achieve metal contamination levels close to {{the recommendation of the}} European Agency for the Evaluation of Medicinal Products.

50|$|The first {{reported}} decarboxylative cross coupling reaction was an Ullmann reaction, in 1966 by Nilsson et al. Thermal decarboxylation of copper benzoates, {{in the presence}} of an aryl halide, was found to produce (both symmetric and unsymmetric) biaryls through aryl-Cu intermediates.This monometallic copper system required drastic conditions for complete cross-coupling, and had various intrinsic limitations, both of which prevented development of a catalytic, preparatory version of this reaction.It was not until 2009 that Liu and Shang et al. found that decarboxylative cross-coupling of aryl bromides and iodides with potassium polyfluorobenzoates could be achieved using monometallic copper iodide as a catalyst. The <b>oxidative</b> <b>addition</b> <b>step</b> was determined to be the rate-limiting step in the copper-only catalyst cycle (a contrast with Pd-catalyzed decarboxylative cross-coupling).|$|R

Initial studies focused on discerning the structural and electronic {{features of the}} organosulfur substrate that enable the challenging <b>oxidative</b> <b>addition</b> to the C(sp 3) -S bond. Through extensive optimization efforts, an Fe(acac) 3 -catalyzed cross-coupling of unactivated alkyl aryl thio ethers with aryl Grignard reagents was realized in which a nitrogen "directing group" on the S-aryl moiety of the thio ether served {{a critical role in}} facilitating the <b>oxidative</b> <b>addition</b> <b>step.</b> In <b>addition,</b> alkyl phenyl sulfones were found to be effective electrophiles in the Fe(acac) 3 -catalyzed cross-coupling with aryl Grignard reagents. For the latter class of electrophile, a thorough assessment of the various reaction parameters revealed a dramatic enhancement in reaction efficiency with an excess of TMEDA (8. 0 equiv).

40|$|International audienceTwo phosphines {{built on}} a bowl-shaped resorcin[4]arene skeleton, namely 5 -diphenylphosphanyl- and 5 -diisopropylphosphanyl- 4 (24), 6 (10), 12 (16), 18 (22) -tetramethylenedioxy- 2, 8, 14, 20 -tetrapentylresorcin[4]arene, have been {{synthesised}} and tested in the Suzuki-Miyaura cross-coupling reaction of aryl halides. Combining these ligands with [Pd(OAc) (2) ] resulted in highly active catalysts that allowed the formation of o,o-biphenyls starting from aryl chlorides. The remarkable activities observed possibly arise from 1) {{the capacity of the}} phosphines to operate transiently as P,O chelators, thereby increasing the electron density of the metal, and 2) the ability of the ligands to embed metal-organic units, which, when occurring, makes the ligand considerably bulkier so as to disfavour the coordination of a second phosphine.

Based on mercury poisoning experiments a heterogeneous palladium catalyst formed from the PCsp 3 P Pd(II) pre-catalyst is proposed.

According to Yi et al. [Science 2011, 333, 1613] the plausible reaction mechanism involves a cationic Rualkenyl species, which is initially formed from 1 with two equivalents of the olefin substrate via the vinylic C-H activation and an alkane elimination step. Once the active catalytic species is achieved the <b>oxidative</b> <b>addition</b> <b>step</b> is faced.

50|$|The {{transmetalation}} of the trans intermediate {{from the}} <b>oxidative</b> <b>addition</b> <b>step</b> {{is believed to}} proceed via a variety of mechanisms depending on the substrates and conditions. The {{most common type of}} transmetalation for the Stille coupling involves an associative mechanism. This pathway implies that the organostannane, normally a tin atom bonded to an allyl, alkenyl, or aryl group, can coordinate to the palladium via one of these double bonds. This produces a fleeting pentavalent, 18-electron species, which can then undergo ligand detachment to form a square planar complex again. Despite the organostannane being coordinated to the palladium through the R2 group, R2 must be formally transferred to the palladium (the R2-Sn bond must be broken), and the X group must leave with the tin, completing the transmetalation. This is believed to occur through two mechanisms.|$|R
40|$|A {{recent study}} {{reported}} an innovative {{approach to the}} synthesis of the pharmaceutical drug, Clinprost. The authors found that {{the introduction of a}} palladium catalyst into the reaction scheme helped reduce the overall synthesis from twenty steps down to just nine, affording significant overall savings. However, unable to account for how the palladium catalyst affects the chemical transformation in the decarboxylative coupling step, the authors contacted the Sargent group for help in determining the reaction mechanism by computational modeling. In order to get a better understanding of a key <b>oxidative</b> <b>addition</b> <b>step</b> in the reaction mechanism, a well-known related system, referred to as the Trost system, was investigated. This reaction utilizes charged species, much like the parent Clinprost system. In this system, acetate detaches from a cyclohexane ring and is replaced with dimethyl malonate.

40|$|PdCl 2 (PPh 3) 2]–PPh 3, in the {{presence}} of NEt 3, is moderately active in the ethoxycarbonylation of 2 -chlorocyclohexylketone to the β-ketoester (ca. 140 TON in 4 h at 100 °C, 100 atm, P/Pd= 2. 5, [Pd]= 5 × 10 − 3 mol l− 1, NEt 3 /substrate= 1. 2). The yield increases upon increasing pCO, passes for a maximum when the P/Pd molar ratio is 2. 5 and it is approximately of the first order with respect to the concentration of the substrate. A reaction mechanism is proposed, which involves the <b>oxidative</b> <b>addition</b> of the chloride to a Pd(0) species, CO insertion forming a Pd(II) β-ketoacyl complex, nucleophilic attack of ethanol to the carbon atom of the acyl moiety and HCl elimination to regenerate the starting Pd(0) species. When the carbonylation is attempted in {{the presence}} of H 2 O {{and in the absence of}} NEt 3, in place of the expected carbonylation product, there is hydrogen transfer from the system H 2 O–CO to the organic substrate with hydrogenolysis of the C–Cl bond. For the hydrodechlorination reaction it is proposed that, after the <b>oxidative</b> <b>addition</b> <b>step</b> to a Pd(0) complex, the Pd–C bond of the alkyl intermediate is protonolyzed by the acid that forms during the course of the reaction and that the Pd(II) complex is then reduced by CO {{in the presence}} of H 2 O...|$|R
5000|$|The {{reaction}} mechanism {{is thought to}} proceed via a standard Pd catalyzed cross-coupling pathway, starting with a Pd(0) species, which is oxidized to Pd(II) in an <b>oxidative</b> <b>addition</b> <b>step</b> involving the organohalide species. This step proceeds with aryl, vinyl, alkynyl, and acyl halides, acetates, or triflates, with substrates following standard <b>oxidative</b> <b>addition</b> relative rates (I>OTf>Br>>Cl). The actual mechanism of <b>oxidative</b> <b>addition</b> is unresolved, though there are two likely pathways. One pathway is thought to proceed via an SN2 like mechanism resulting in inverted stereochemistry. The other pathway proceeds via concerted addition and retains stereochemistry. Though the additions are cis- the Pd(II) complex rapidly isomerizes to the trans- complex. Next, the transmetalation step occurs where the organozinc reagent exchanges its organic substituent with the halide in the Pd(II) complex, generating the trans- Pd(II) complex and a zinc halide salt. The organozinc substrate can be aryl, vinyl, allyl, benzyl, homoallyl, or homopropargyl. Transmetalation is usually rate limiting and a complete mechanistic understanding of this step {{has not yet been}} reached though several studies have shed light on this process. It was recently determined that alkylzinc species must go on to form a higher-order zincate species prior to transmetalation whereas arylzinc species do not. ZnXR and ZnR2 can both be used as reactive reagents, and Zn is known to prefer four coordinate complexes, which means solvent coordinated Zn complexes, such as ZnXR(solvent) 2 cannot be ruled out a priori. Studies indicate competing equilibriums exist between cis- and trans- bis alkyl organopalladium complexes, but that the only productive intermediate is the cis complex.|$|R
40|$|We {{explore the}} {{construction}} and performance {{of a range of}} catalytic nanoreactors based on palladium nanoparticles encapsulated in hollow graphitised nanofibres. The optimum catalytic material, with small palladium nanoparticles located almost exclusively at the graphitic step-edges within nanoreactors, exhibits attractive catalytic properties in Suzuki-Miyaura cross-coupling reactions. Confinement of nanoparticles at the step-edges facilitates retention of catalytic centres and recycling of catalytic nanoreactors without any significant loss of activity or selectivity over multiple catalytic cycles. Furthermore, careful comparison of the catalytic properties of palladium nanoparticles either on or in nanoreactors reveals that nanoscale confinement of catalysts fundamentally affects the pathways of the Suzuki-Miyaura reaction, with the yield and selectivity for the cross-coupled product critically dependent on the steric properties of the aryl iodide reactant, whereas no effects of confinement are observed for aryl boronic acid reactants possessing substituents in different positions. These results indicate that the <b>oxidative</b> <b>addition</b> <b>step</b> of the Suzuki-Miyaura reaction occurs at the step-edge of nanofibres, where the mechanisms and kinetics of chemical reactions are known to be sensitive to nanoscale confinement, and thus the extent of confinement in carbon nanoreactors can be discretely controlled by careful selection of the aryl iodide reactant...|$|R

The speed of this algorithm was increased by three orders of magnitude, primarily by improving the algorithm for compressing the system from 4 D to 3 D at constant energy. The second project was modeling the adsorption of H 2 molecules on the Si(100) surface using density functional theory (DFT) with the PW 91 functional. Consistent with the experiments, the calculations predicted an energetic preference for clustering of occupied sites in a dimer row. However, our calculations did not verify the unbuckling induced by H 2 adsorption reported by Buehler and Boland. The third project was modeling molybdenum and rhodium-catalyzed [2 + 2 + 1] cycloisomerization reaction using DFT with the B 3 LYP functional.

DFT (B 3 LYP) calculations in model complexes show that reactions initiated by acetonitrile or ethylene five-coordinate adducts involve C−H <b>oxidative</b> <b>addition</b> transition states of lower energy than that found in the absence of these ligands. Key species in these ligand-assisted transformations are the distorted (nonsquare-planar) intermediates preceding the intramolecular C−H <b>oxidative</b> <b>addition</b> <b>step,</b> which are generated after release of one cyclooctadiene double bond from the five-coordinate species. The feasibility of this mechanism is also investigated for complexes [IrCl(L) (PiPr 3) 2] (L = η 2 -C 2 H 4, 27; η 2 -C 3 H 6, 28).

Next, we have investigated the Suzuki-Miyaura cross-coupling reaction for the active catalyst species IPr-Pd(0) using 4 -chlorotoluene and phenylboronic acid as substrates and isopropyl alcohol as a solvent. Our theoretical findings predict an upper barrier trend, corresponding to the activation mechanism for the [Pd]-Cl- 1 - 4 series, in good agreement with the experiments. They indeed provide a quantitative explanation of the low yield (12 %) displayed by [Pd]-Cl- 1 species (Delta G(double dagger) approximate to 30. 0 kcal/mol) and of the high yields (approximate to 90 %) observed in the case of [Pd]-C 1 - 2 - 4 complexes (Delta G(double dagger) approximate to 20. 0 kcal/mol). Additionally, the studied Suzuki-Miyaura reaction involving the IPr-Pd(0) species is calculated to be thermodynamically favorable and kinetically facile. Similar investigations for the [Pd]-Br- 1 - 4 series, derived from [Pd(IPr) (R-allyl) Br], indicate that the <b>oxidative</b> <b>addition</b> <b>step</b> for IPr-Pd(0) -mediated catalysis with 4 -bromotoluene is kinetically more favored than that with 4 -chlorotoluene. Finally, we have explored the potential of Ni-based complexes [Ni((IPr) (R-allyl) X] (X = Cl, Br) as Suzuki-Miyaura reaction catalysts. Apart from a less endergonic reaction energy profile for both precatalyst activation and catalytic cycle, a steep increase in the predicted upper energy barriers (by 2. 0 - 15. 0 kcal/mol) is calculated in the activation mechanism for the [Ni]-X- 1 - 4 series compared to the [Pd]-X- 1 - 4 series.

Slightly higher yields are obtainable when the {{catalytic system}} is used in combination with a ligand such as PPh 3. A mechanism for the catalytic cycle is proposed: (i) The starting keto chloride undergoes <b>oxidative</b> <b>addition</b> to reduced palladium with formation of a catalytic intermediate having a Pd-[CH(COOH) CH 2 COPh] moiety. The reduced palladium may be the metal coordinated by other atoms of palladium and/or by carbon monoxide and/or by a PPh 3 ligand when catalysis is carried out in the presence of this ligand. It is also proposed that the keto group in the β-position with respect to the carbon atom bonded to chlorine weakens the C-Cl bond, easing the <b>oxidative</b> <b>addition</b> <b>step</b> and enhancing the activity of the catalyst. (ii) Carbon monoxide ‘inserts’ into the Pd-C bond of the above intermediate to give an acyl catalytic intermediate having a Pd-[COCH(COOH) CH 2 COPh] moiety. (iii) Nucleophilic attack of H 2 O to the carbon atom of the carbonyl group bonded to the metal of the acyl intermediate yields a malonic acid derivative as product intermediate. This, upon decarboxylation, gives the final product. Alternatively, the desired product may form without the malonic acid derivative intermediate, through the following reaction pathway: the acyl intermediate undergoes decarboxylation with formation of a different acyl intermediate, having a Pd-[CO-CH 2 CH 2 COPh] moiety, which, upon nucleophilic attack of H 2 O on the carbon atom of the carbonyl group bonded to the metal, yields the final product...|$|R
40|$|My {{graduate}} {{research at}} MIT {{has been focused}} on the development of palladium- or nickel-catalyzed cross-coupling reactions using unactivated alkyl electrophiles (e. g., halides and sulfonates). Although aryl and alkenyl electrophiles have been commonly used in such processes, the utility of alkyl substrates has been underdeveloped, and merits further exploration. We have developed the first palladium-based catalyst that is effective for Negishi couplings of primary alkyl electrophiles. A single protocol (2 %Pd₂(dba) ₃/ 8 %P(Cyp) ₃/NMI in THF/NMP at 80 ⁰C) can be applied to a broad spectrum of electrophiles, including chlorides, bromides, iodides, and tosylates. Concerning the scope of the nucleophilic components, an array of alkyl-, alkenyl-, and arylzinc halides can be coupled. The process is tolerant of a variety of functional groups, including esters, amides, imides, nitriles, and heterocycles. Furthermore, geometrically- defined alkenylzinc species, generated from titanium-mediated hydrozincation of internal alkynes, can be directly used in the process. Despite the progress in nickel- and palladium-catalyzed C(sp³) -C(sp³) bond formation, the methods had been limited to primary alkyl electrophiles. (cont.) No doubt, the ability to use more challenging, secondary ones will further augment the usefulness of these metal- catalyzed processes. To this end, we have determined that Ni(cod) ₂/s-Bu-Pybox can catalyze room-temperature Negishi couplings of an array of functionalized alkyl bromides and iodides. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first nickel- or palladium- catalyzed cross-coupling procedure for unactivated, [beta]-hydrogen-containing secondary alkyl halides. In addition, preliminary studies using substrate-based probes suggest that the <b>oxidative</b> <b>addition</b> proceeds through a radical pathway. This may explain the unparalleled reactivity of the nickel catalyst. As an extension of the nickel catalysis, we have established that the combination of Ni(cod) ₂ and bathophenanthroline can effect Suzuki reactions of secondary halides and organoboronic acids. These organoboron reagents are particularly widely used in the cross-coupling chemistry, owing to their chemical stability, biological non-toxicity, and commercial availability.

40|$|One of {{the most}} {{versatile}} methods {{for the formation of}} aryl-aryl bonds is the palladium-catalyzed cross-coupling reaction. Previous work in the DeShong laboratory has demonstrated the utility of aryl siloxanes for the palladium-catalyzed cross-coupling of aryl iodides, bromides, and chlorides, as well as new synthetic methods for the formation of aryl siloxanes. The work reported herein details (1) the synthesis of aryl siloxanes using ortho-metallation techniques (2) the coupling of aryl bis(catechol) silicates with aryl triflates, and (3) the application of aryl siloxane coupling technology to the synthesis of colchicine and allocolchicine derivatives. The synthesis of aryl siloxanes had previously been performed using either metal-halogen exchange, or transition metal-catalyzed silylation. These techniques necessitate the use of an aryl halide as the starting material. The application of ortho-metallation conditions avoids this requirement and allows for the synthesis of siloxanes directly from the unfunctionalized arene. Using this approach, ortho-ether and carbamate siloxanes were prepared in good yields, however, o-benzamide siloxanes could not be prepared using this method. The coupling of aryl triflates with aryl siloxanes had previously proven problematic due to competitive hydrolysis of the triflate. The use of aryl bis(catechol) silicates as siloxane surrogates facilitated the coupling of aryl triflates and iodides bearing a range of functional groups in excellent yield. Additionally, aryl bromides could be successfully coupled by switching from conventional heating to microwave irradiation. The use of aryl siloxanes in the synthesis of the natural products colchicine and allocolchine was explored. It was found that the carbocyclic framework of colchicine could be constructed using an aryl siloxane coupling reaction; however, the reaction required the use of a stoichiometric amount of the palladium "catalyst.

The role of the precatalyst activation"Density functional theory calculations {{have been used to}} investigate the activation mechanism for the precatalyst series [Pd]-X- 1 - 4 derived from [Pd(IPr) (R-allyl) X] species by substitutions at the terminal position of the allyl moiety ([Pd] = Pd(IPr); R = H (1), Me (2), gem-Me 2 (3), Ph (4), X = Cl, Br). Next, we have investigated the Suzuki-Miyaura cross-coupling reaction for the active catalyst species IPr-Pd(0) using 4 -chlorotoluene and phenylboronic acid as substrates and isopropyl alcohol as a solvent. Our theoretical findings predict an upper barrier trend, corresponding to the activation mechanism for the [Pd]-Cl- 1 - 4 series, in good agreement with the experiments. They indeed provide a quantitative explanation of the low yield (12 %) displayed by [Pd] -Cl- 1 species (G 30. 0 kcal/mol) and of the high yields (90 %) observed in the case of [Pd]-Cl- 2 - 4 complexes (G 20. 0 kcal/mol). Additionally, the studied Suzuki-Miyaura reaction involving the IPr-Pd(0) species is calculated to be thermodynamically favorable and kinetically facile. Similar investigations for the [Pd] -Br- 1 - 4 series, derived from [Pd(IPr) (R-allyl) Br], indicate that the <b>oxidative</b> <b>addition</b> <b>step</b> for IPr-Pd(0) -mediated catalysis with 4 -bromotoluene is kinetically more favored than that with 4 -chlorotoluene. Finally, we have explored the potential of Ni-based complexes [Ni((IPr) (R-allyl) X] (X = Cl, Br) as Suzuki-Miyaura reaction catalysts. Apart from a less endergonic reaction energy profile for both precatalyst activation and catalytic cycle, a steep increase in the predicted upper energy barriers (by 2. 0 - 15. 0 kcal/mol) is calculated in the activation mechanism for the [Ni]-X- 1 - 4 series compared to the [Pd] -X- 1 - 4 series. Overall, these results suggest that Ni-based precatalysts are expected to be less active than the Pd-based precatalysts for the studied Suzuki-Miyaura reactionA.

40|$|The two-coordinate binary Pd(0) {{isocyanide}} monomer Pd(CNArDipp²) ₂ {{was prepared}} using the sterically encumbering m-terphenyl isocyanide ligand CNArDipp² (ArDipp² = 2, 6 -(2, 6 -(iPr) ₂C₆H₂) ₂C₆H₃). Building upon the isolobal relationship between [Pi]-acidic isocyanides and C[Omicron], Pd(CNArDipp²) ₂ was targeted as a stable analogue to the highly reactive binary carbonyl species Pd(C[Omicron]) ₂. The electron-rich nature of Pd(CNArDipp²) ₂ was demonstrated by its reactivity towards elecrophilic and Lewis acidic substrates such as I₂, Me[Omicron]Tf, and Tl[Omicron]Tf. In addition, {{the ability of}} Pd(CNArDipp²) ₂ to oxidatively add across C [...] Br bonds of aryl bromides made it a promising catalyst precursor for organic cross-coupling reactions. Pd(CNArDipp²) ₂ mediated the Suzuki-Miyaura cross-coupling of unactivated aryl bromides and aryl boronic acids with 1 mol % catalyst loading at room temperature. Moderate activity was observed with Pd(CNArDipp²) ₂, and was attributed {{to the presence of}} an unnecessary equivalent of ligand on the complex. Kinetic studies on the <b>oxidative</b> <b>addition</b> <b>step</b> provided evidence for a dissociative mechanism, which thereby implied the involvement of a monoligated [Pd(0) L] species. Synthetic approaches to complexes containing a 1 : 1 L/Pd ratio culminated in the isolation and structural characterization of [Pd([eta]²-Dipp-[mu]-CNArDipp) ]₃. This complex is a trinuclear aggregate of [Pd(0) L] and is catalytically competent in Suzuki-Miyaura cross-coupling reactions. Most notably, [Pd([eta]²-Dipp-[mu]-CNArDipp) ]₃ exemplifies the ability of sterically encumbering [Pi]- acidic isocyanide ligands to stabilize the highly reactive and electron-rich monoligated [Pd(0) L] species. Further, Pd(CNArDipp²) ₂ was employed to probe the coordination chemistry of redox non-innocent ArN[Omicron] ligands. Remarkably, addition of 2 equiv of PhN[Omicron] to Pd(CNArDipp²) ₂ generated the complex Pd([kappa]¹-N- PhN[Omicron]) ₂(CNArDipp₂) ₂, which is the first metal complex containing ([eta]¹-N-PhN[Omicron]) ·¹⁻ units to be structurally characterized. Magnetic susceptibility measurements and broken symmetry calculations confirmed the singlet diradical electronic structure of this complex in the solid state. However, spectroscopic studies indicated that Pd([kappa]¹-N-PhN[Omicron]) ₂(CNArDipp₂) ₂ can only be observed at low temperature in solution. Complexation of two ArN[Omicron] units to Pd(CNArDipp²) ₂ in solution at room temperature was achieved using p- [Omicron]CH-C₆H₄N[Omicron]. The resulting complex Pd([kappa]¹-N-p-[Omicron]CH-C₆H₄N[Omicron]) ₂(CNArDipp²) ₂ also exhibited paramagnetism in solution, unlike its PhN[Omicron] derivative. Additional ArN[Omicron] derivatives of Pd(CNArDipp²) ₂ were isolated and characterized, and the chemistry pertaining to these compounds is discusse...|$|R
40|$|This {{thesis is}} {{concerned}} with the syntheses of a range of polyfluorinated biphenyl ether derivatives for use as dopants in commercial LC materials, so that overall display performance may be improved. Reactions of hexa– and penta–fluorobenzene with sodium phenoxide in polar aprotic solvents (MeCN, THF) and under mild reaction conditions (45 – 50 °C, 4 – 65 h) afford moderate yields of pentafluorophenoxybenzene and 1, 2, 4, 5 –tetrafluoro– 3 –phenoxybenzene, respectively. SNAr reactions of sodium phenoxide with less electrophilic 1, 2, 3, 4 –tetra– and 1, 2, 3, 5 –tetra–fluorobenzene under microwave irradiation (150 °C, 30 mins) furnish good yields of 1, 2, 4 –trifluoro– 3 –phenoxybenzene and 1, 2, 5 –trifluoro– 3 –phenoxybenzene, respectively. Similar SNAr methodology is used to access a series of 1, 2, 4, 5 –tetra– and 1, 2, 4 –tri–fluoro– 3 –(4 –n–alkylphenoxy) benzene derivatives in good yield. A two–step SNAr–hydrodebromination procedure to access trifluorophenoxybenzene systems from highly electrophilic dibromotetrafluorobenzene derivatives is also developed, and provides a practical synthetic route to 1, 2, 4 –trifluoro– 5 –phenoxybenzene. Finally, a three–step SNAr–diazotisation–reductive diazotisation pathway is developed for the syntheses of difluorophenoxybenzene derivatives, which are not accessible by direct SNAr reactions of sodium phenoxide with corresponding trifluorobenzene derivatives. The use of these polyfluorinated biphenyl ether systems as dopants for LC materials is assessed by a range of electro–optical measurements. Highly fluorinated nitrobenzene systems are compatible substrates for palladium–catalysed Suzuki–Miyaura and Heck–type cross–coupling reactions involving C–F bond activation. Cross–coupling reactions of pentafluoronitrobenzene with a range of boronic acids and protected ester equivalents bearing electron–withdrawing or electron–donating substituents in the meta– and para– positions, with respect to the C–B bond, are described. For example, Reaction of pentafluoronitrobenzene with 5, 5 –dimethyl– 2 –phenyl– 1, 3, 2 –dioxaborinane in the presence of catalytic quantities of Pd(PPh 3) 4 and using KF/alumina as the preferred base (DMF, 150 °C, 15 mins, μW) affords 2, 3, 4, 5 –tetrafluoro– 6 –nitrobiphenyl in good yield (80 %). The nitro group is crucial {{to the success of the}} cross–coupling processes and is believed to facilitate the <b>oxidative</b> <b>addition</b> <b>step</b> by directing the palladium catalyst into the adjacent C–F bond by a predominantly SNAr–type mechanism.

40|$|The {{first part}} of this work deals with <b>oxidative</b> <b>addition</b> {{reactions}} of the triangulo platinum cluster [Pt 3 (μ-CO) 3 (PCy 3) 3]. Reactions with the electrophilic molecules ICH 2 CN and X 2 (X = I and Br) and with the weakly polar reagent Ph 3 SnH have been studied. All three reactants convert the starting cluster firstly to novel 44 -electron clusters probably via a SN 2 mechanism. In the case of ICH 2 CN the adduct [Pt 3 (μ-CO) 3 (PCy 3) 3 (I) (CH 2 CN) ] is the first example where a Pt(II) L 3 moiety is bonded to two Pt(0) L units via direct metal-metal bonds. A similar adduct was observed in the <b>oxidative</b> <b>addition</b> of Ph 3 SnH to the starting cluster, e. g. [Pt 3 (SnPh 3) (μ-CO) 3 (PCy 3) 3 H] which is the first reported neutral hydrido Pt-Sn cluster. With <b>elementary</b> halogens <b>oxidative</b> <b>addition</b> is followed by nucleophilic substitution of a CO ligand giving adducts [Pt 3 X(μ-CO) 2 (μ-X) (PCy 3) 3] (X = I, Br). Excess of reactants led to fragmentation of these adducts giving Pt(I) dimers and Pt(II) monomers. The observed trends in the nuclear spin-spin coupling constants in Pt(I) dimers have been reproduced by computation at the DFT level. The second part reports novel synthetic routes for pentanuclear platinum cluster compounds starting from trinuclear ones. The first complete NMR characterization of these Pt 5 phosphino-carbonyl clusters was achieved as well. The final part of our work deals with CO scrambling processes in tetranuclear iridium and rhodium carbonyl clusters as studied by variable pressure NMR. The two major processes are the 'merry-go-round' and the 'change of basal face' which may be distinguished by the sign of the activation volume, negative for the former, positive for the latter process. On the basis of a theoretical study at the DFT level, transition state structures of the 'change of basal face' were proposed in the case of Ir 2 Rh 2 (CO) 12 and Ir 4 (μ-SO 2) (CO) 11. These transition state structures have larger molecular volumes compared to those of ground state geometries in accordance with the experimentally determined, positive values of activation volume for this fluxional process...|$|R
40|$|Benzyl {{alcohols}} are carbonylated to {{phenylacetic acid}} derivatives {{in the presence}} of a palladium catalyst. Typical reaction conditions are: temperature 90 – 120 °C;P(CO) = 20 – 80 atm; benzyl alcohol/ROH/Pd= 100 – 200 / 300 – 1000 / 1; [Pd]= 0. 5 × 10 − 2 − 1 × 10 − 2 M; solvent: dioxane, benzene, ethanol; reaction time 1 – 4 h. Under these experimental conditions high yields are obtained only when the aromatic ring contains a hydroxy substituent at the para position and when the palladium precursor is a chloride used in combination with 2 – 4 equivalents of PPh 3. When the substituent is in a m- or o-position or is a methoxy group, or in the case of benzyl alcohol, only trace amounts of phenylacetic acid derivatives are obtained. The system PdY 2 (PPh 3) 2 -PPh 3 yields the same results as PdY 2 with equivalent amounts of phosphine (Y=Cl, Br, I, CH 3 COO). When the precursor is employed in combination with a base, catalysis does not occur to an appreciable extent. On the contrary, when HCl is added in an amount comparable to that of the palladium precursor (HCl/Pd= 2 - 15), slightly higher yields are obtained. These results suggest that the starting benzyl alcohol reacts with HCl to yield the corresponding chloride, which initiates the catalytic cycle. Moreover, it has been observed that the best results are obtained when the palladium(II) precursor decomposes to metallic palladium. Pd/C is also active, provided that it is employed in combination with HCl and PPh 3. Thus, for example, the system Pd/C-HCl-PPh 3 is catalytically equivalent to the system that originates from the initial precursor PdCl 2 (PPh 3) -PPh 3, eventually {{in the presence of}} added HCl. Low catalytic activity is observed in the absence of PPh 3 or when this ligand is added in relatively small amounts. The highest yields are obtained when P/Pd= 2 – 3. These facts suggest that the PPh 3 ligand eases the <b>oxidative</b> <b>addition</b> <b>step</b> by enhancing the electron density on the metal. Under these conditions, the yield increases with increasing gas pressure. When the ligand is present in relatively large excess, the catalytic activity drops dramatically, probably because PPh 3 competes with the coordination to the metal. The catalytic activity is strongly influenced by the nature of the solvent. The yield decreases in the order: dioxane » ethanol ≈ benzene, and depends also on the ROH/solvent ratio; the highest yields are achieved when the EtOH/dioxane ratio is ca. 1 / 5 (ml). At higher concentrations of EtOH the yield is significantly lower, probably because the equilibrium between benzyl alcohol and hydrochloric acid is less favorable to the formation to benzyl chloride and/or the acid competes with the chloride for the <b>oxidative</b> <b>addition</b> to the metal. A mechanism for the catalytic cycle is proposed: (i) <b>oxidative</b> <b>addition</b> of ArCH 2 Cl to ‘reduced palladium’, which may be palladium coordinated by other palladium atoms, and/or carbon monoxide, and/or phosphine ligands. (ii) Carbon monoxide ‘insertion’ into Pd-benzyl intermediate with formation of an acyl intermediate. (iii) Nucleophilic attack of EtOH on the carbon atom of the acyl intermediate to give the desired product and return the catalyst back to the catalytic cycle. The promoting effect of the hydroxy substituent in the para position is interpreted in terms of resonance structures, in which deprotonation of this substituent may play an important role in weakening the Cl-Cl bond, thus easing the initial step of the catalysis...|$|R
40|$|M. Sc. This study {{initially}} {{focused on}} the synthesis {{of a set of}} triaryl phosphine ligands, encompassing a broad range of electron withdrawing functionalities on the ortho-position of one of the aryl rings. These varying moieties were readily incorporated into diphenylphosphino benzaldehyde as starting material through both Wittig and Knoevenagel chemistry. The ligands produced were tested in the Pd-catalysed Suzuki reaction. The electronic as well as the steric nature of the alkene ligands largely dictated the activities observed: the more electron poor or the bulkier the ligand, the higher the activity observed in the Suzuki reaction. This is in contrast to much work in the literature stating that highly active Suzuki catalysts require a very electron rich system. At the same time, the literature indicates that co-ordinatively unsaturated Pd-complexes are also active catalysts. The activities observed were ascribed to the ability of these electron poor bulky phosphine alkene ligands to stabilise or promote the reductive elimination step of the Suzuki mechanism in preference to the <b>oxidative</b> <b>addition</b> <b>step,</b> which is the typical rate determining step. The study then investigated carbonylation reactions, specifically the methoxycarbonylation and hydrocarboxylation reactions, which are typically Brønsted acid co-catalysed. The alternative was the first time use of metal-triflate based Lewis acids as co-catalysts in these types of reactions. Thus, a systematic study was performed. It was found that metal trifluoromethane sulfonate (hereafter referred to as triflate) based Lewis acid co-catalysts outperformed the typical Brønsted acid co-catalysts by between one and a half to {{two and a half times}} on the rate of the methoxycarbonylation reaction, depending on the substrate used. The system was tested with Pd loadings in the region 2 – 0. 03 mol%. A competing heat-induced styrene polymerisation reaction ultimately affected the results at such low Pd loadings. A low level kinetic analysis was performed indicating zero order kinetics on the alkene concentration of the reaction, with a fractional order dependence on the Lewis acid concentration. There was little to no effect on the linear/branched ratio of the product in response to the use of the Lewis acid. The nature of the metal within the metal triflate based co-catalyst also seemed to be critical to the reaction, with the 4 + based Zr and Hf ultimately providing the highest obtainable turn over frequencies, the 1 + and 2 + based metals providing no conversion, and reactivity in the presence of the 3 + metals depended on the specifics of the reaction. In addition to a great deal of work being performed on styrene and ethylene as substrates, reactions using phenylacetylene were also optimised. Here, it was found that the bidentate BINAP ligand and the literature preferred ligand, PyPPh 2 afforded good catalyst activity. Both of these ligands offered much faster catalyst systems than PPh 3 and various other bidentate ligands tested...|$|R
40|$|The thermal {{degradation}} {{of polyvinyl chloride}} (PVC) is a significant processing challenge {{which can lead to}} deleterious mechanical and optical properties {{in a wide range of}} products. Synergetic studies on PVC model compounds and blends of bulk PVC provide unique insights into the {{thermal degradation}} and stabilization pathways in the presence of common additives. Model PVC compounds were selected to replicate specific defects (e. g., allylic, vicinal and tertiary) and tacticity (i. e., utilizing stereochemistry to investigate tacticity) commonly found in PVC. Model studies were conducted neat (solvent-free) with metal carboxylates. Experimental results highlight that the allylic and tertiary defects are more reactive than pristine PVC and isotactic sites are more reactive than their syndiotactic counterparts. Zinc stearate was found to act not in the role of substituent, but as a Lewis acid by facilitating dehydrochlorination of labile chlorides. This prevents the accumulation of hydrogen chloride and autocatalytic chain unzipping. In contrast, calcium stearate delayed the formation of zinc chloride, a much stronger Lewis acid than zinc stearate, through an ion exchange process to form calcium chloride. Thermal weight loss studies using blends of bulk PVC proved critical in transferring mechanistic insights into the context of a polymeric matrix. Post-combustion carbon capture has traditionally involved the use of aqueous alkanol amine solutions. The regeneration of such systems, however, can be costly and energy intensive. We have developed an alternative system utilizing silylated alkylamines to reversibly capture CO 2 under near ambient conditions. The silyl amines developed capture CO 2 through chemical reaction to form reversible ionic liquids (RevIL). RevILs utilize no added water and are tunable by molecular design allowing us to influence industrially relevant carbon capture properties such as viscosity, temperature of reversal, and enthalpy of regeneration, while maximizing overall CO 2 capture capacity. We demonstrate a strong structure-property relationship among the silyl amines where minor structural modifications lead to significant changes in the bulk properties of the RevIL. Amine containing substrates are important building blocks for a variety of biological and pharmaceutical compounds. However, application of the otherwise versatile Suzuki reaction to these substrates has proved challenging due to either ligation of the amine to the palladium or to electronic effects slowing the <b>oxidative</b> <b>addition</b> <b>step.</b> Conventional methods to overcome these challenges involve protection-deprotection strategies or the use of designer ligands to facilitate reaction. We have shown that application of CO 2 pressure and adjusting the water content of the reaction system facilitate the Suzuki coupling of 4 -amino- 2 -halopyridines in high yield with the simple Pd(TPP) 2 Cl 2 catalyst. The protocol was expanded to 2 -halopyridines. The results of these investigations will be discussed. Ph. D...|$|R

The formation of C 6 H 5 N=NC 6 H 5 from NH 2 C 6 H 5 through reductive coupling is a thermo-dynamically unfavorable process. Three hydride-migration processes, from the proton of N-H to the cobalt center, are established as the most energy-demanding steps. The activation energies (Delta G*) are calculated as 49. 4, 55. 4, and 33. 3 kcal mol(- 1), respectively, for the proposed reaction route 1. These large activation energies might be reduced slightly by purposely adding small protic molecules, such as H 2 O, or by changing the active metal from Co to a heavier metal, such as Rh or It. An alternative pathway, route 2, is also proposed, in which transition states with four-membered rings are formed. By this route, severe strain caused by the formation of three-membered rings during the hydride-migration processes in route I can be avoided.
