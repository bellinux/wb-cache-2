40|$|This {{paper is}} {{designed}} to study the laws <b>of</b> phreatic <b>evaporation</b> and improve the understanding to the ultimate rate and <b>depth</b> <b>of</b> phreatic <b>evaporation.</b> By analyzing the control conditions for establishing empirical formulae <b>of</b> phreatic <b>evaporation,</b> the calculation models for calculating the phreatic evaporation from bare land have been developed, {{which was based on}} the experimental data <b>of</b> phreatic <b>evaporation</b> on bare land at the Akesu Water Balance Experimental Station in Tarim Basin from 1990 to 1996. The results show that (1) developed calculation models are accord with the control conditions; (2) as for a given <b>depth</b> <b>of</b> groundwater table, the relation <b>of</b> phreatic <b>evaporation</b> and water surface evaporation is nonlinear and the phreatic evaporation is close to the ultimate rate when water surface evaporation reaches the infinity great; (3) the threshold <b>of</b> groundwater <b>depth</b> doesn't exist theoretically. With the reasonable construction, these models overcome the shortcomings that the phreatic evaporation is overestimated when atmosphere evaporation capacity is higher, and the phreatic evaporation increases linearly along with the water surface evaporation increases. The test results show that the calculation accuracy of the models is high and it can be applied to calculate phreatic evaporation in similar regions. (29 refs. ...|$|R

As groundwater level gets closer to the ground surface, evaporation increases. Thornthwaite method as a common method (Alesheikh et al. 2004), using groundwater depth and watershed evaporation, was {{used to calculate the}} depletion caused by evaporation.

40|$|Transport of {{chemical}} substances through a catchment depend {{to a large}} extent on the water content of the soil through which they are transported. When the groundwater level rise and fall, redox conditions change in the soil and the transport of substances is affected. The aim {{of this study is to}} develop a hydrological model which is able to simulate soil water content at different depths and groundwater level in a soil profile. A new type of conceptual model is developed, which uses a continous represenation of the soil and soil water from the soil surface down to the bedrock. The model is intended to be applied on small catchments at a later stage. The results show that the simulation of groundwater levels was greatly improved compared to previous results. Simulation of soil water content at selected depths is not yet satisfactory. The runoff simulation was accurate at one of the sites but did not work as well at the other. At one of the sites it was also possible to combine good simulations of runoff and groundwater levels but at the other it was only possible to obtain acceptable simulations of either runoff or groundwater. It is suggested that model performance could be improved by letting the porosity decrease and the soil water content increase non-linearly with <b>depth.</b> Calculations <b>of</b> <b>evaporation</b> from soil and runoff also need to be modified...|$|R
40|$|Even {{though the}} {{phenomenon}} <b>of</b> <b>evaporation</b> is omnipresent and has immense {{scientific and technological}} importance, the research effort to unveil its fundamentals remains inadequately low. As one particular consequence, the textbooks and educational courses are lacking detailed explanation <b>of</b> <b>evaporation</b> and its effects. In order to advance fundamental theory <b>of</b> <b>evaporation</b> and increase accuracy <b>of</b> <b>evaporation</b> simulation a novel evaporation theory is presented. This integrated Atomistic(Molecular) -Kinetics-Gasdynamics theoretical model that combines statistical mechanics, gas dynamics and thermodynamics approaches opens a path to detailed description <b>of</b> nonstationary, nonequilibrium <b>evaporation</b> <b>of</b> condensed matter. The main innovation of the proposed approach is that, unlike all previous and current models <b>of</b> <b>evaporation</b> {{that are based on}} the assumption <b>of</b> <b>evaporation</b> as emission <b>of</b> the particles that are not bound within the condense phase, the described new model treats <b>evaporation</b> <b>of</b> condensed phase as escape of the particles of sufficient kinetic energy out of potential well located at the boundary of condensed and gaseous phases. Correspondingly, the re-condensation of the vapor onto the surface is treated as entrapment of the vapor particles with kietic energy lower than the <b>depth</b> <b>of</b> the potential well. The described novel research will open new opportunities to substantially advance our knowledge and provide needed contributions to chemical, combustion, environmental, climate and other sciences that utilize evaporation theory.

40|$|Groundwater {{evaporation}} {{can play}} an important role in crop-water use where the water table is shallow. Lysimeters are often used to quantify the groundwater evaporation contribution influenced by a broad range of environmental factors. However, it is difficult for such field facilities, which are operated under limited conditions within limited time, to capture the whole spectrum of capillary upflow with regard to the inter-seasonal variability of climate, especially rainfall. Therefore, in this work, the method of combining lysimeter and numerical experiments was implemented to investigate seasonal groundwater contribution to crop-water use. Groundwater evaporation experiments were conducted through a weighing lysimeter at an agricultural experiment station located within an irrigation district in the lower Yellow River Basin for two winter wheat growth seasons. A HYDRUS- 1 D model was first calibrated and validated with weighing lysimeter data, and then was employed to perform scenario simulations <b>of</b> groundwater <b>evaporation</b> under different depths to water table (DTW) and water input (rainfall plus irrigation) driven by long term meteorological data. The scenario simulations revealed that the seasonally averaged groundwater evaporation amount was linearly correlated to water input for different values of DPW. The linear regression could explain more than 70 % of the variability. The seasonally averaged ratio of the groundwater contribution to crop-water use varied with the seasonal water input and DTW. The ratio reached as high as 75 % in the case of DTW = 1. 0 m and no irrigation, and as low as 3 % in the case of DTW = 3. 0 m and three irrigation applications. The results also revealed that the ratio <b>of</b> seasonal groundwater <b>evaporation</b> to potential evapotranspiration could be fitted to an exponential function of the DTW that may be applied to estimate seasonal groundwater evaporation. In this case study of multilayered soil profile, the depth at which groundwater may evaporate at potential rate was 0. 60 - 0. 65 m, and the extinction <b>depth</b> <b>of</b> groundwater <b>evaporation</b> was approximately 3. 8 m.

It is an effective approach to study ecological water demand of natural vegetation by phreatic evaporation. In order to study the ecological water demand of Tarim river basin, based on the observation data <b>of</b> phreatic <b>evaporation</b> on bare lands at the Aksu Water Balance Experimental station from 1989 to 1996, by analyzing the relationship <b>of</b> phreatic <b>evaporation,</b> <b>depth</b> <b>of</b> phreatic surface and <b>evaporation</b> <b>of</b> water, taking the limit rate <b>of</b> phreatic <b>evaporation</b> as the control condition, and based on the objective law that the relation between phreatic <b>evaporation</b> and <b>evaporation</b> <b>of</b> water is nonlinear, we establish models for calculating phreatic evaporation on bare land, which can fully reflect the law <b>of</b> phreatic <b>evaporation</b> in the Tarim river basin. According to the data <b>of</b> <b>depth</b> <b>of</b> phreatic surface and soil moisture when pheratic level decline is caused just by evapotranspiration on Tamarix-vegetated land from 2003 to 2004, we calculate the amount <b>of</b> phreatic <b>evaporation</b> and set up models for calculating phreatic evaporation on Tamarix- vegetated land.

40|$|The {{stable isotope}} {{compositions}} of soil water (δ 2 H and δ 18 O) carry important {{information about the}} prevailing soil hydrological conditions and for constraining ecosystem water budgets. However, they are highly dynamic, especially during and after precipitation events. In this study, we present an application of a method based on gas-permeable tubing and isotope-specific infrared laser absorption spectroscopy for in situ determination of soil water δ 2 H and δ 18 O. We conducted a laboratory experiment where a sand column was initially saturated, exposed to evaporation {{for a period of}} 290 days, and finally rewatered. Soil water vapor δ 2 H and δ 18 O were measured daily at each <b>of</b> eight available <b>depths.</b> Soil liquid water δ 2 H and δ 18 O were inferred from those of the vapor considering thermodynamic equilibrium between liquid and vapor phases in the soil. The experimental setup allowed for following the evolution of soil water δ 2 H and δ 18 O profiles with a daily temporal resolution. As the soil dried, we could also show {{for the first time the}} increasing influence of the isotopically depleted ambient water vapor on the isotopically enriched liquid water close to the soil surface (i. e., atmospheric invasion). Rewatering at the end of the experiment led to instantaneous resetting of the stable isotope profiles, which could be closely followed with the new method. From simple soil δ 2 H and δ 18 O gradients calculations, we showed that the gathered data allowed one to determinate the <b>depth</b> <b>of</b> the <b>evaporation</b> front (EF) and how it receded into the soil over time. It was inferred that after 290 days under the prevailing experimental conditions, the EF had moved down to an approximate <b>depth</b> <b>of</b> − 0. 06 m. Finally, data were used to calculate the slopes <b>of</b> the <b>evaporation</b> lines and test the formulation for kinetic isotope effects. A very good agreement was found between measured and simulated values (Nash and Sutcliffe efficiency, NSE = 0. 92) during the first half of the experiment, i. e., until the EF reached a <b>depth</b> <b>of</b> − 0. 04 m. From this point, calculated kinetic effects associated with the transport of isotopologues in the soil surface air layer above the EF provided slopes lower than observed. Finally, values of kinetic isotope effects that provided the best model-to-data fit (NSE > 0. 9) were obtained from inverse modeling, highlighting uncertainties associated with the determinations of isotope kinetic fractionation and soil relative humidity at the EF...|$|R

40|$|Throughout the world, {{increased}} use of agrochemicals, warrant urgent measures to minimise their impacts on the aquatic environment. Monitoring is the usual practice to identify and quantify pollutants, however, it is an after-the-fact occurrence, and monitoring over large spatial scales is not feasible. Mathematical models provide an alternative to monitoring {{and can be used}} both to forecast future pollution and to investigate the impacts of potential control measures. This thesis is therefore focussed on catchment scale modelling of pesticide pollution of rivers. Data from a 142 -ha agricultural catchment on the Unilever Colworth estate, have been used to model pesticide pollution at the catchment scale. After a review of available models SWAT- 2000 was selected as the modelling tool. An acceptable performance in hydrological modelling, along with correct simulation of the processes driving the water balance were essential first requirements. After modification of the SWAT- 2000 source code, hydrological simulation, crop growth and evapotranspiration patterns were realistic when compared with monitored data SOUTCGS. Hydrological modelling was carried out using both daily and sub-daily data with Hargreaves and Penman-Montieth methods of evapotranspiration and the NRCS- Curve Number and Green-Ampt methods of runoff generation. A sensitivity analysis identified GWQMN, AWC and ESCO as the most sensitive parameters. These control baseflow, water content of soil layers, and <b>depth</b> distribution <b>of</b> <b>evaporation</b> from the soil respectively. The best combination of runoff generation and evapotranspiration components was identified as Curve Number with Hargreaves. Modelling of sediment and pesticide loss was carried out for four pesticides. Various management scenarios were designed and tested with the objective of reducing pesticide loss to streams and a web-based tool was developed to give advice on pesticide application. With the modifications implemented, it has been demonstrated that SWAT is a useful tool for modelling pesticide behaviour at catchment scale in UK conditions...|$|R
