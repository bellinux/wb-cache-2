5|$|I {{think you}} will {{recognise}} {{that it was necessary}} to get rid of Brunetto for two reasons. The first is that the visionary figure has now become somewhat more definite and will no <b>doubt</b> <b>be</b> identified by some readers with Yeats though I do not mean anything so precise as that. However, I do not wish to take the responsibility of putting Yeats or anybody else into Hell and I do not want to impute to him the particular vice which took Brunetto there. Secondly, although the reference to that Canto is intended to be explicit, I wish the effect of the whole to be Purgatorial which is more appropriate. That brings us to the reference to swimming in fire which you will remember at the end of Purgatorio 26 where the poets are found.|$|E
25|$|There is {{a general}} {{similarity}} running through the carved design of most races of primitive culture, the chip form of ornament being almost universally employed. Decorated surfaces depending almost entirely upon the incised line also obtain all over the world, and may no <b>doubt</b> <b>be</b> {{accounted for by the}} extensive use of stone cutting tools. The carver shows the same tendency to over-exalt his art by crowding on too much design as the more civilized craftsman of other lands, while he also on occasion exercises a good deal of restraint by a harmonious balance of decoration and plain space. So far as his chip designs and those patterns more or less depending on the line are concerned, his work as a rule is good and suitable, but when he takes to figure work his attempts do not usually meet with success. Primitive carving, generally, shows that very similar stages of artistic development are passed through by men of every age and race.|$|E

5000|$|The {{theory of}} doubt, {{according}} to the Nyayasutras, starts with the premise that <b>doubt</b> <b>is</b> part of human learning process, occurs when conflicting possibilities exist with regard to cognized object. <b>Doubt</b> <b>is</b> neither error nor absence of knowledge, but a form of uncertainty and human struggle with probability when it faces incomplete or inconsistent information. It is a knowledge that is possibly partially valid and partially invalid, but <b>doubt</b> <b>is</b> a form of knowledge that has positive value. <b>Doubt</b> <b>is</b> an invitation to [...] "proceed to further investigation", asserts the text.

500|$|The filmmaker Robert Altman saw Moore in the Uncle Vanya production, and was {{sufficiently}} impressed to cast {{her in his}} next project: the ensemble drama Short Cuts (1993), based on short stories by Raymond Carver. Moore was pleased to work with him, as his film 3 Women (1977) gave her a strong appreciation for cinema when she saw it in college. Playing artist Marian Wyman was an experience she found difficult, as she was a [...] "total unknown" [...] surrounded by established actors, but this proved to be Moore's breakout role. Variety magazine described her as [...] "arresting" [...] and noted that her monologue, delivered naked from the waist down, would [...] "no <b>doubt</b> <b>be</b> the most discussed scene" [...] of the film. Short Cuts was critically acclaimed, and received awards for Best Ensemble Cast at the Venice Film Festival and the Golden Globe Awards. Moore received an individual nomination for Best Supporting Female at the Independent Spirit Awards, and the monologue scene earned her a degree of notoriety.|$|E

Mick LaSalle of the San Francisco Chronicle praised the film, saying [...] " [...] was playful and energized enough to keep an audience guessing". Joe Leydon of Variety praised the film, saying [...] " [...] generates a respectable amount of suspense and takes a few unexpected turns while covering familiar territory", while Kevin Thomas of the Los Angeles Times said it was [...] "a terrific theatrical feature debut for television veterans Glen Morgan and James Wong". Chris Kaltenbach of The Baltimore Sun found the film [...] "fitfully thrilling", while Maitland McDonagh of TV Guide defined the film as [...] "serviceable enough, if you come to it with sufficiently modest expectations".|$|E

[...] In regards to Jack's love triangle, Rabin opined that this arc [...] "could easily have worn out its welcome long ago" [...] but that Alec Baldwin, Julianne Moore, and Elizabeth Banks [...] "have kept lively and vibrant."

Meredith Blake, writing for the Los Angeles Times, was positive about Liz getting engaged, noting that she has become a woman, and concluded that [...] "it will no <b>doubt</b> <b>be</b> one of television's most memorable weddings" [...] if Liz and Wesley get married.

[...] Contrasting to Griffin's earlier 2001 appearance on HARDtalk and later appearances on Newsnight with Jeremy Paxman, Griffin claimed that he was non-combative in his Question Time appearance in order to gain sympathy from the viewers via a [...] "root-for-the-underdog mentality". He had expected to salvage his reputation in expected a later 12 episodes of the programme with him appearing as a panellist, which did not occur. However, he also stated in a letter on the BNP website: [...] "I will, no <b>doubt,</b> <b>be</b> interrupted, shouted down, slandered, put on the spot, and subjected to a scrutiny that would be a thousand times more intense than anything directed at other panellists.

500|$|The Continuation of the Chronicle by Friar George, {{which was}} written {{in the middle of the}} , {{recorded}} the first historical event– an alliance between the Magyars and the Bulgarians in the late 830s– that can without <b>doubt</b> <b>be</b> connected to the Magyars. The Byzantine Emperor Leo the Wise's Tactics, a book written around 904, contained a detailed description of their military strategies and way of life. Emperor Constantine Porphyrogenitus's De administrando imperio ("On Governing the Empire"), which was completed between 948 and 952, preserves most information on the Magyars' early history. Abu Abdallah al-Jayhani, the minister of Nasr II, ruler of the Samanid Empire, collected the reports of merchants who had traveled in the western regions of the Eurasian steppes in the 870s and 880s. Although Al-Jayhani's work was lost, later Muslim scholars Ibn Rusta, Gardizi, Abu Tahir Marwazi, and Al-Bakri used his book, preserving important facts about the late 9th-century Magyars. However, their works also contain interpolations from later periods. Among the sources written in Western Europe, the longer version of the Annals of Salzburg, Regino of Prüm's Chronicon, the Annals of Fulda, and Liutprand of Cremona's Antapodosis ("Retribution"), provide contemporaneous or near-contemporaneous information of the 9th-century Magyars. There are also references to the Magyars dwelling in the Pontic steppes in the legends of Cyril, Methodius and other early Slavic saints. According to historian András Róna-Tas, information preserved in the Russian Primary Chronicle, which was completed in the 1110s, has to be [...] "treated with extreme caution".|$|E

Elena Gorgan of Softpedia said [...] "even with all this, she hardly manages {{to create a}} strong impression [...]., the video fails to break any visual ground, albeit standing on its own as a stylish video." [...] The Daily Mail agreed saying [...] " [...] which will no <b>doubt</b> <b>be</b> interpreted by fans as an insight into Cheryl's marriage to footballer Ashley Cole. Cheryl has ditched her street dance gear for a gown fit for a diva along with suitably styled big hair ... But as she teams up with Black Eyed Peas rapper will.i.am is sporting a more feminine look. The net result is, sorry to say it, very regal but {{a bit on the}} dull side." [...] Lisa McGarry of 'Unreality TV' [...] said the platinum wig was [...] "strange" [...] She also said [...] "if it doesn’t look great, at least it looks shocking." [...] Meanwhile, David Balls of 'Digital Spy' said [...] " [...] this glitzy split-screen affair, Cheryl looks effortlessly classy and glam as she transforms into an Egyptian goddess and - with more success than a certain Mrs. B (Mel B) back in 2001 [...] - shows how to wear a blonde wig without looking like you're on a dirty weekend in the Toon. Perfectly complimenting the song itself, this super-glossy clip also suggests that Cole has a firm eye on global stardom over the next year."

[...] The Philadelphia Inquirers Steven Rea talked about McConaughey's role, [...] "Just about everything is right with Dallas Buyers Club, beginning with Matthew McConaughey's literally transformative portrayal.

[...] Mick LaSalle of the San Francisco Chronicle said, [...] "Dallas Buyers Club" [...] takes audiences back to {{the worst of the}} AIDS crisis, where the disease was a death sentence, and the public's terror and hostility were at its height." [...] Film critic Richard Roeper reviewed the film for his own website, and talked about McConaughey: [...] "Once we get past McConaughey's stunning transformation, we're transfixed by a performance that reminds us of why this guy became a movie star in the first place." [...] Ann Hornaday gave the film 4 out of 4 ratings, and then gave her remarks on McConaughey's remarkable performance for The Washington Post, [...] "McConaughey delivers the performance of his career, characterized not just by an astonishing physical transformation but by a wellspring of deep compassion and fearlessness." ...|$|E
