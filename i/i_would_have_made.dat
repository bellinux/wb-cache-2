Yet again you have shown yourself to be unfit {{to live in a}} decent society. It is hard for me to convey the loathing and revulsion that ordinary people will feel for what you have done...

[...] Coppola was able to stoically accept the critical and commercial reaction to Tucker: The Man and His Dream. [...] "Every time in my career I tried to make, dare I say it, an art film, it never did well." ...|$|E
500|$|The House Committee on National Security {{hearing on}} 3 August was {{presided over by}} Congressman Bob Dornan and lasted one day. At the hearing, Pilkington and Andrus {{explained}} how the USAF accident investigation was conducted and emphasized that Wickson and May violated the OPC rules of engagement by conducting a VID pass of the Black Hawks that was inadequate to determine the helicopter's national origin. Andrus stated, [...] "Sir, as a pilot, <b>I</b> <b>would</b> <b>have</b> <b>made</b> another pass. You would never fire until {{you know what you}} are shooting at." [...] Retired USAF colonel and pilot Jerry Cox expressed concern to the Committee with the F-15 pilots for not taking responsibility for their actions.|$|E

'Pauncefort,' said Lord Cadurcis, {{when that}} gentlewoman appeared, 'I have brought you a shawl, but I {{could not bring}} you a turban, because the Turkish ladies do not wear turbans; but if I had thought we should have met so soon, <b>I</b> <b>would</b> <b>have</b> <b>had</b> one <b>made</b> on purpose for you.' ...|$|R

500|$|In 1983, McCartney said, [...] "I {{would not}} have been as {{typically}} human and standoffish as I was if I knew John was going to die. <b>I</b> <b>would</b> <b>have</b> <b>made</b> more of an effort to try and get behind his [...] "mask" [...] and have a better relationship with him." [...] He said that he went home that night, watched the news on television with his children and cried most of the evening. In 1997, he said that Lennon's death made the remaining ex-Beatles nervous that they might also be murdered. He told Mojo magazine in 2002 that Lennon was his greatest hero. In 1981, McCartney sang backup on Harrison's tribute to their ex-bandmate, [...] "All Those Years Ago", which featured Starr on drums. McCartney released [...] "Here Today" [...] in 1982, a song Everett described as [...] "a haunting tribute" [...] to McCartney's friendship with Lennon.|$|E
500|$|In {{an impromptu}} {{interview}} following the match, a clearly upset Solo criticized Ryan's decision. [...] "It {{was the wrong}} decision, and I think anybody that knows anything about the game knows that. There's {{no doubt in my}} mind <b>I</b> <b>would</b> <b>have</b> <b>made</b> those saves. And the fact of the matter is it's not 2004 anymore. It's not 2004. And it's 2007, and I think you have to live in the present. And you can't live by big names. You can't live in the past. It doesn't matter what somebody did in an Olympic gold medal game in the Olympics three years ago. Now is what matters, and that's what I think." [...] Many viewed her comments as being critical of Scurry's performance, although Solo released an apologetic statement the following day saying that was not her intent. On September 29, 2007, coach Greg Ryan announced that Solo would not be with the team and would not play in the third-place match against Norway the following day. Team captain Kristine Lilly stated that the decision on Solo was made by the team as a group. The U.S. went on to win against Norway 4–1.|$|E

2500|$|In his {{official}} response to [...] the Hunter commission that enquired into the shooting, Dyer was unremorseful and stated: [...] "I think it {{quite possible that}} I could have dispersed the crowd without firing but they would have come back again and laughed, and <b>I</b> <b>would</b> <b>have</b> <b>made,</b> what I consider, a fool of myself." ...|$|E
2500|$|During pre-production, the {{producers}} debated on whether Martin would own slaves, ultimately {{deciding not to}} make him a slave owner. This decision received criticism from Spike Lee, who in a letter to The Hollywood Reporter accused the film's portrayal of slavery as being [...] "a complete whitewashing of history". Lee wrote that after he and his wife went to see the film, [...] "we both came out of the theatre fuming. For three hours The Patriot dodged around, skirted about or completely ignored slavery." [...] Gibson himself remarked: [...] "I think <b>I</b> <b>would</b> <b>have</b> <b>made</b> him a slave holder. Not to seems kind of a cop-out." ...|$|E
2500|$|Although {{prolific}} {{during his}} short career, and {{now one of}} the most studied and admired British poets, his reputation rests on a small body of work, centred on the Odes, and only in the creative outpouring of the last years of his short life was he able to express the inner intensity for which he has been lauded since his death. Keats was convinced that he had made no mark in his lifetime. Aware that he was dying, he wrote to Fanny Brawne in February 1820, [...] "I have left no immortal work behind me – nothing to make my friends proud of my memory – but I have lov'd the principle of beauty in all things, and if I had had time <b>I</b> <b>would</b> <b>have</b> <b>made</b> myself remember'd.

2500|$|On 19 November, Dyer {{was called}} {{to appear before the}} Commission. Although his {{military}} superiors had suggested he be represented by legal counsel at the inquiry, Dyer refused this suggestion and appeared alone. Initially questioned by Lord Hunter, Dyer stated he had come to know about the meeting at the Jallianwala Bagh at 12:40 hours that day but did not attempt to prevent it. He stated that he had gone to the Bagh with the deliberate intention of opening fire if he found a crowd assembled there. Patterson says Dyer explained his sense of honour to the Hunter Commission by saying, [...] "I think it quite possible that I could have dispersed the crowd without firing but they would have come back again and laughed, and <b>I</b> <b>would</b> <b>have</b> <b>made,</b> what I consider, a fool of myself." [...] Dyer further reiterated his belief that the crowd in the Bagh was one of [...] "rebels who were trying to isolate my forces and cut me off from other supplies. Therefore, I considered it my duty to fire on them and to fire well".|$|E
