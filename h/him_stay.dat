In the past, Arjuna was felicitated by Indra, the king of deities for gaining the divine weapon, Pashupatastra, from Lord Shiva through {{dedicated}} devotion. The celestial dancer Urvashi {{falls in love with}} Arjuna but he rejects her advances as he considered her a motherly figure. Feeling insulted, Urvashi cursed him to lose his masculinity and turn into an eunuch. Indra arrived and asked Arjuna to treat this curse as a blessing in disguise as the 13th year is arriving.

5|$|The episode relates three {{parallel}} plots, in intertwining scenes. The first plot concerns George being {{banned from}} the executive toilet. Because of this he quits his job, but immediately regrets the decision. He discusses job opportunities with Jerry, but is unable to think of an occupation that would suit him. Jerry suggests that George could try {{to go back to}} work and pretend he never quit. George takes this advice, but his former boss, Rick Levitan (Fred Applegate), refuses to let <b>him</b> <b>stay</b> and insults him. As revenge, George decides to slip a Mickey Finn into his drink during an office party, and enlists Elaine Benes to help him. At the party, Elaine distracts Levitan while George puts the mickey in his drink. When Levitan notices George, however, he decides he was unreasonable and tells George he can have his job back. George attempts to intercept the drink, but after Levitan welcomes him back with a toast sprinkled with insults at George's expense, he changes his mind. In the following scene we see George once again brainstorming job opportunity ideas, the subtext being that his boss discovered the spiking of his drink, connected it to George, and has fired him once again.|$|E
5|$|While the two Ferraris were delayed behind Hamilton, Alonso {{was pulling}} {{away at the}} front, setting fastest laps on laps seven and fifteen. On lap 12, Robert Kubica was {{the first man to}} pit for fuel and fresh tyres, however he {{reported}} traction control problems four laps later and lost places. Alonso had extended his lead over Hamilton to 15 seconds by the first round of pitstops. He had experienced radio problems before refuelling, but these were fixed during the stop. The Renaults were circulating in eighth and tenth by the pit stops, with Fisichella ahead of Kovalainen. Button {{was one of the few}} drivers who started on the slower harder tyre and was dropping down the field, as Takuma Sato passed the Briton. All of the front runners were on the same tyre strategy, with Räikkönen being the first front runner to pit. He found himself behind Fisichella as he exited. A short pit stop by Hamilton enabled him to come out of the pits ahead of the Renault, leaving a car between himself and Räikkönen during the pit window. Heidfeld's late stop on lap 22 helped <b>him</b> <b>stay</b> ahead of Massa. The top five positions remained unchanged, however Hamilton's different strategy enabled him to escape Räikkönen and close in on leader Alonso at a second per lap. Despite pitting on lap 20, he set the fastest lap of the race on lap 22 in 1:36.701.|$|E

6000|$|... "I {{had never}} {{imagined}} {{that he would}} have been impetuous. And he seems to think that even the business of getting himself married would not justify <b>him</b> <b>staying</b> away from Parliament. He is a rigid martinet in all matters of duty." ...|$|R
25|$|In December, 1961, Gagarin and Kamanin flew {{on another}} tour, {{this time of}} India, Sri Lanka and Afghanistan.

25|$|Rivière quickly {{passed the}} blame for his fall and his broken back on the team {{mechanic}}, accusing him of leaving oil on the wheels and the brakes for not working. The mechanic was outraged, and the doctors soon found the real reason – that so much painkiller was in Rivière's blood that his hands were too slow to operate the brakes. He had taken {{a heavy dose of}} the opioid painkiller dextromoramide (Palfium), to help <b>him</b> <b>stay</b> with Nencini on Col de Perjuret.

Angel's girlfriend (Gilda Texter), who rides a {{motorcycle}} nude, recognizes Kowalski and shows him a collage she made of newspaper articles about his police career. Kowalski suspects that Super Soul's broadcast is now being directed by the police to entrap him. Confirming {{that the police are}} indeed waiting at the border, Angel helps Kowalski get through the roadblock {{with the help of an}} old air raid siren and a small motorbike with a red headlight strapped to the top of the Challenger, simulating a police car.

Roseanne's rich, estranged cousin Ronnie (Joan Collins) visits and persuades Darlene to get her GED and apply to art school. David applies as well. Darlene asks her parents if David can move in, because his mother is moving away {{and they want to}} stay together. Roseanne and Dan initially refuse, but when Roseanne sees David's mother being verbally and emotionally abusive, she decides to let <b>him</b> <b>stay</b> because it reminded her of her own troubled childhood with her equally abusive father. Roger (Tim Curry) offers Dan a deal to renovate and sell a small fixer-upper house, then runs off before the deal is complete; Jackie decides to buy the house, saving Dan from financial ruin. David gets a rejection letter from art school, while Darlene gets an acceptance. At the end of the season, Roseanne fears Darlene will run away to school, although Darlene has already decided not to go. Realizing she was wrong, Roseanne persuades Darlene to not give up on her goals just to stay with David.|$|E
