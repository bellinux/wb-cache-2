5|$|<b>Hornbills</b> are a {{group of}} birds whose bill is shaped like a cow's horn, but without a twist, {{sometimes}} with a casque on the upper mandible. Frequently, the bill is brightly coloured.|$|E
5|$|The eastern {{green mamba}} {{has a few}} natural predators. Humans, mongooses, snake eagles, and genets {{commonly}} prey on this species of mamba. <b>Hornbills</b> and other snakes tend to prey on juvenile green mambas.|$|E
5|$|Azhdarchids are now {{well-known}} {{as being}} terrestrial predators akin to ground <b>hornbills</b> or some storks, eating any prey item they could swallow whole. Two major {{exceptions to this}} are Hatzegopteryx, which was a robustly built raptorial predator of relatively large prey, including medium-sized dinosaurs; and Alanqa, {{which may have been}} a specialist molluscivore.|$|E
50|$|Belum Temenggor {{is home to}} over 300 avian species. It is {{the only}} {{existing}} forest where all 10 species of <b>hornbill</b> that inhabit Malaysia are found, namely the white-crowned <b>hornbill,</b> bushy-crested <b>hornbill,</b> wrinkled <b>hornbill,</b> wreathed <b>hornbill,</b> plain-pouched <b>hornbill,</b> black <b>hornbill,</b> Oriental pied <b>hornbill,</b> rhinoceros <b>hornbill,</b> great <b>hornbill</b> and helmeted <b>hornbill.</b> In the forest {{you can also find}} 3,000 species of flowering plants, including 3 species of Rafflesia, the world's largest flower.|$|R
50|$|The white-crowned <b>hornbill</b> (Berenicornis comatus), {{also known}} as the long-crested <b>hornbill</b> or white-crested <b>hornbill</b> (leading to easy {{confusion}} with the African white-crested <b>hornbill),</b> is a species of <b>hornbill.</b>|$|R
50|$|The Tickell's brown <b>hornbill</b> (Anorrhinus tickelli), {{also known}} as the rusty-cheeked <b>hornbill,</b> is a species of <b>hornbill</b> found in forests in Burma and {{adjacent}} western Thailand. Austen's brown <b>hornbill</b> is sometimes considered as a subspecies of Tickell's brown <b>hornbill.</b>|$|R
5|$|Birds {{sometimes}} also form {{associations with}} non-avian species. Plunge-diving seabirds associate with dolphins and tuna, which push shoaling fish towards the surface. <b>Hornbills</b> have a mutualistic relationship with dwarf mongooses, {{in which they}} forage together and warn each other of nearby birds of prey and other predators.|$|E
5|$|Birds are hunted in many {{countries}} around the world. In the developed world, ducks such as mallard, wigeon, shoveler and teal have for centuries been captured by wildfowlers, while pheasants, partridges, grouse, and snipe are among the terrestrial birds that are hunted for sport, generally with guns. In {{other parts of the}} world, traditional subsistence hunting still continues, as in rural Northern Papua, where cassowaries, crowned pigeons, <b>hornbills</b> and megapodes are captured for food. Seabirds such as muttonbirds, penguins and auks have been hunted for food, formerly with sufficient intensity to threaten many populations and to make some, such as the great auk, extinct. Seabird hunting continues at more moderate levels today, for instance with the traditional Māori harvest of sooty shearwater chicks.|$|E
5|$|The bushcrow feeds both on {{the ground}} and in trees. It begins {{foraging}} at sunrise. While foraging, a bushcrow can be alone, in a pair, or in a group of six or seven other bushcrows. A foraging bushcrow digs vigorously in the soil while its beak is held slightly open to catch any insects it unearths. When it catches something, it carries it to the nearest tree or bush, pins it down with its foot, and kills and eats the prey. This species has also been seen using its beak to tear apart rotten wood and inspecting cattle dung in the search for food. It may also land on the backs of cattle to search for parasites. It can also chase flying insects, which it does on foot, abruptly changing direction and taking flying leaps after its prey. It often mixes with white-crowned starlings, red-billed <b>hornbills,</b> red-billed buffalo weavers, and superb starlings while foraging. When hunting in the trees, it is capable of walking atop horizontal branches and jumping upwards towards the crown, then descending in a glide from the crown to the ground.|$|E

50|$|Previously, this <b>hornbill</b> {{was placed}} in the genus Aceros. It has often been lumped with the plain-pouched <b>hornbill</b> (R. subruficollis), and {{sometimes}} considered to include the Narcondam <b>hornbill</b> (R. narcondami) and the wreathed <b>hornbill</b> (R. undulatus) as subspecies.|$|R

25|$|Roberts House was {{originally}} built in 1898, and {{designed by the}} architect Laurence Aloysius McDonnell. The building is currently a free-flying aviary, which houses a group of Rodrigues fruit bats, as well as exotic birds such as great Indian <b>hornbills,</b> red junglefowl, yellow-backed lories and Victoria crowned pigeons.|$|E
25|$|More than 470 {{species of}} birds have been {{identified}} in the park, many of which are migrants, with almost 60 species being raptors. Birds that call this area home for {{at least part of the}} year include: vultures, marabou storks, secretary birds, <b>hornbills,</b> crowned cranes, ostriches, long-crested eagles, African pygmy-falcons and the lilac-breasted roller, which is the national bird of Kenya.|$|E
25|$|In 2014, the zoo {{opened the}} Land of the Tiger. It is a beautifully {{designed}} exhibit with naturalistic surroundings and built-in enrichment for the animals. As the guest enters the Land of the Tiger, {{two species of}} <b>hornbills</b> can be seen. Visayan warty pigs live in a large enclosure. The Asian small-clawed otter and the babirusa pigs share an exhibit with a heated pool.|$|E
50|$|As for {{the other}} Asian <b>hornbill</b> species, Buceros and Rhinoplax are each other's closest relatives, Anorrhinus {{is part of a}} clade that has Ocyceros and Anthracoceros as sister taxa, and Aceros, Rhyticeros, and Penelopides form another clade. However, {{according}} to this study, Aceros is polyphyletic; the Rufous-headed <b>hornbill,</b> Writhed <b>hornbill,</b> and Wrinkled <b>hornbill</b> form a clade with the Sulawesi <b>hornbill,</b> and are in turn more closely related to Penelopides. These four species have been classified in a separate genus, Rhabdotorrhinus. Similarly, the Knobbed <b>hornbill</b> is more closely related to Rhyticeros, leaving the Rufous-necked <b>hornbill</b> {{the only member of the}} genus Aceros.|$|R
