50|$|The {{history of}} {{therapist}} disclosure {{has been a}} journey based largely on the therapists' perspectives. Early psychodynamic theorists strongly disagreed with the incorporation of therapist self-disclosure in the client-therapist relationship. Ferenczi notably maintained his belief that self-disclosure was {{of the utmost importance}} in children's therapy for traumas in that a neutral, flat therapist would only cause the child to relive the trauma. Object-relations theorists want the client {{to be able to see}} how he or she is seen by another and how what she shares is viewed by another, and the best way to operationalize these factors is through a trusting relationship with a therapist who also discloses. Self-theorists believe much the same as object-relations theorists. Intersubjective and relational schools of thought encourage disclosure due to its ability to bring subjectivity into therapy, which they deem a necessary element to real healing. They maintain that therapeutic relationships cannot be initiated and changed without <b>intentional</b> <b>disclosures</b> from both therapist and client.|$|R
40|$|Organizational secrets enable {{firms to}} protect their unique stocks of knowledge, reduce the imitability of their {{capabilities}} and achieve sustained competitive advantages (Hannah, 2005). In today’s business environments, the loss of valuable proprietary organizational knowledge due to <b>intentional</b> employee <b>disclosure</b> represents a substantial threat to firm competitiveness. Anecdotal evidence suggests that firms in the United States lose more than 250 billion of intellectual property every year, with <b>intentional</b> employee <b>disclosure</b> accounting for {{a significant portion of}} these losses (Dandliker, 2012; Heffernan 2 ̆ 6 Swartwood, 1993). Thus, understanding factors that influence such <b>intentional</b> secret <b>disclosure</b> is a key concern, especially in knowledge-intensive industries. While prior research has primarily focused on the disclosure of personal secrets, family secrets or ‘dark’ organizational secrets, very few studies have examined the disclosure of value-creating organizational secrets – i. e., strategic secrets that encapsulate knowledge about a firm’s plans from competitors and Social secrets that create valued identity categorizations within organizations (Goffman, 1959). This dissertation begins to address this gap in the literature by putting forth a person-situation interaction model of secret disclosure. Specifically, drawing on the resource-based view of the firm and Social identity theory, it explores how certain characteristics of value-creating organizational secrets (e. g., market value of knowledge and Social value of concealment) may interact with certain individual-level variables (e. g., moral identity and need for status) to influence employees’ secret disclosure intent. Using scenario-based surveys of undergraduate and EMBA students and a cross-sectional sample of working adults in the United States, this dissertation finds evidence for the key proposition that employees’ perceptions of market value of knowledge and Social value of concealment shape their secret disclosure intentions. Individual-level factors like moral identity and organizational disidentification were also found to play important roles in the disclosure of organizational secrets. This dissertation contributes to the emerging field of organizational secrecy by integrating key informational and Social perspectives to address concerns regarding secret protection in organizations...|$|R

The daughter in this case must weigh the risks of breaking the family privacy boundary against the benefits of the doctor being better informed of her father's condition.|$|E

50|$|Recent {{research}} suggests {{there are three}} primary aspects of transparency relevant to management practice: information disclosure, clarity, and accuracy. To increase transparency, managers actively infuse greater disclosure, clarity, and accuracy into their communications with stakeholders. For example, managers that voluntarily share information related to the firm's ecological impact with environmental activists are demonstrating disclosure; managers that limit the use of technical terminology, fine print, or complicated mathematical notations in their correspondence with suppliers and customers are demonstrating clarity; and managers that do not bias, embellish, or otherwise distort known facts in their communications with investors are demonstrating accuracy.

Journals and Conferences provide a platform to receive large number of research papers for publications and presentations before the expert and peer-level scientific community. In order to assure quality of such papers, they are also sent to reviewers for their comments. In order to maintain good ethical standards, the research papers are sent to reviewers in such a way authors and reviewers do not know each other’s identity. This technique is called Double-blind Review Process. It is called Single-blind Review Process, if identity of any one party, generally authors’, is disclosed to the other. This paper presents the techniques by which identity of author as well as reviewer could be found even through Double-blind Review process.

40|$|Background: Direct–to–consumer {{genetic testing}} (DTCGT) offers risk {{estimates}} {{for a variety}} of complex diseases and conditions, yet little is known about its impact on actual users, including their decisions about sharing the information gleaned from testing. Ethical considerations include the impact of unsolicited genetic information with variable validity and clinical utility on relatives, and the possible burden to the health care system if revealed to physicians. Aims: The qualitative study explored primary care patients’ views, attitudes, and decision making considerations regarding DTCGT. This article focuses on the disclosure decisions participants made regarding participation, testing, and results of DTCGT, a topic which arose as a secondary aim of the study. Methods: Through four longitudinal interviews (pre–test, results, 3 and 12 months post–test) we examined twenty primary care patients’ decisions, expressed intentions, and actions regarding disclosure to immediate and extended family, friends and coworkers, and physicians about participation in and results of DTCGT. Individual interviews were analyzed using qualitative content analysis and a summative approach to describe the global themes. Results: Most participants disclosed to some immediate family; less than half disclosed to extended family; approximately half talked to friends. Most participants stated they would or might disclose to physicians about DTCGT and a few did. Conceptual themes that emerged from the data analysis include ambivalence about disclosure, consistency between intention and actual disclosure behavior and decisions, and conditional information sharing. Conclusions: Participants’ <b>intentional</b> and actual <b>disclosure</b> patterns offer insight into how they view DTCGT, weigh results, and the potential impact of DTCGT...|$|R

40|$|This {{dissertation}} {{is concerned}} with the HIV epidemic in Rwanda, specifically related to the support associations for people living with HIV. In it, I examine the reshaped individual subjectivities that emerged within the group, the emergent socialities that came to life, and the influences of the governmental and nongovernmental institutions in the wider Rwandan context. The study design combined three main features – historical research and key informant interviews on the historical forms and practices of coming together in Rwanda, ethnography on the daily activities of five specific associations and ethnographic research on {{the ways in which the}} associations shaped the experiences of HIV for its members and maintained the guidance of the shifting local and national policies. The dissertation research took place from January 2012 until December 2012, with additional field visits in November of 2013. Findings explore the complex social setting of Rwandan HIV associations in a post-genocide context alongside national and international health policies and programs. The associations emerged under the guise of a government mandate of coming together to solve local problems. The idea of coming together is unpacked and the rhetoric of coming together scrutinized. Coming together in the HIV support group led to both <b>intentional</b> and inadvertent <b>disclosure</b> of HIV status in the community, often leading to akato (Rwanda’s version of something like stigma). Findings also delve into the ways in which members of the groups maneuvered their way through different channels to support their families. The groups provided a space to create new networks after networks were broken due to the akato from HIV disclosure. Subjectivities were reshaped by the group mandates that required members to live within a moral order that often conflicted with the existing moral code. The ways in which association members, as well as those who elected not to join the group, were excluded and made vulnerable are examined. New changes to create income-generating groups are explored as new policies urged self-reliant citizens. In conclusion, the idea of fluid subjectivities is explored as a way to explain how people and governments respond to health epidemics...|$|R

40|$|This thesis {{opens up}} the design space for {{awareness}} research in CSCW and HCI. By challenging the prevalent understanding of roles in awareness processes and exploring different mechanisms for actively engaging users in the awareness process, this thesis provides {{a better understanding of}} the complexity of these processes and suggests practical solutions for designing and implementing systems that support active awareness. Mutual awareness, a prominent research topic in the fields of Computer-Supported Cooperative Work (CSCW) and Human-Computer Interaction (HCI) refers to a fundamental aspect of a person’s work: their ability to gain a better understanding of a situation by perceiving and interpreting their co-workers actions. Technologically-mediated awareness, used to support co-workers across distributed settings, distinguishes between the roles of the actor, whose actions are often limited to being the target of an automated data gathering processes, and the receiver, who wants to be made aware of the actors’ actions. This receiver-centric view of awareness, focusing on helping receivers to deal with complex sets of awareness information, stands in stark contrast to our understanding of awareness as social process involving complex interactions between both actors and receivers. It fails to take into account an actors’ intimate understanding of their own activities and the contribution that this subjective understanding could make in providing richer awareness information. In this thesis I challenge the prevalent receiver-centric notion of awareness, and explore the conceptual foundations, design, implementation and evaluation of an alternative active awareness approach by making the following five contributions. Firstly, I identify the limitations of existing awareness research and solicit further evidence to support the notion of active awareness. I analyse ethnographic workplace studies that demonstrate how actors engage in an intricate interplay involving the monitoring of their co-workers progress and displaying aspects of their activities that may be of relevance to others. The examination of a large body of awareness research reveals that while disclosing information is a common practice in face-to-face collaborative settings it has been neglected in implementations of technically mediated awareness. Based on these considerations, I introduce the notion of <b>intentional</b> <b>disclosure</b> to describe the action of users actively and deliberately contributing awareness information. I consider challenges and potential solutions for the design of active awareness. I compare a range of systems, each allowing users to share information about their activities at various levels of detail. I discuss one of the main challenges to active awareness: that disclosing information about activities requires some degree of effort. I discuss various representations of effort in collaborative work. These considerations reveal that there is a trade-off between the richness of awareness information and the effort required to provide this information. I propose a framework for active awareness, aimed to help designers to understand the scope and limitations of different types of <b>intentional</b> <b>disclosure.</b> I draw on the identified richness/effort trade-off to develop two types of <b>intentional</b> <b>disclosure,</b> both of which aim to facilitate the disclosure of information while reducing the effort required to do so. For both of these approaches, direct and indirect disclosure, I delineate how they differ from related approaches and define a set of design criteria that is intended to guide their implementation. I demonstrate how the framework of active awareness can be practically applied by building two proof-of-concept prototypes that implement direct and indirect disclosure respectively. AnyBiff, implementing direct disclosure, allows users to create, share and use shared representations of activities in order to express their current actions and intentions. SphereX, implementing indirect disclosure, represents shared areas of interests or working context, and links sets of activities to these representations. Lastly, I present the results of the qualitative evaluation of the two prototypes and analyse the results with regard to the extent to which they implemented their respective disclosure mechanisms and supported active awareness. Both systems were deployed and tested in real world environments. The results for AnyBiff showed that users developed a wide range of activity representations, some unanticipated, and actively used the system to disclose information. The results further highlighted a number of design considerations relating to the relationship between awareness and communication, and the role of ambiguity. The evaluation of SphereX validated the feasibility of the indirect disclosure approach. However, the study highlighted the challenges of implementing cross-application awareness support and translating the concept to users. The study resulted in design recommendations aimed to improve the implementation of future systems. ...|$|E
