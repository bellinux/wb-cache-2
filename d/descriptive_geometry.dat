5|$|Mathematics can {{be discerned}} {{in many of}} the arts, such as music, dance, painting, architecture, and sculpture. Each of these is richly {{associated}} with mathematics. Among the connections to the visual arts, mathematics can provide tools for artists, such as the rules of linear perspective as described by Brook Taylor and Johann Lambert, or the methods of <b>descriptive</b> <b>geometry,</b> now applied in software modelling of solids, dating back to Albrecht Dürer and Gaspard Monge. Artists from Luca Pacioli in the Middle Ages and Leonardo da Vinci and Albrecht Dürer in the Renaissance have made use of and developed mathematical ideas in the pursuit of their artistic work. The use of perspective began, despite some embryonic usages in the architecture of Ancient Greece, with Italian painters such as Giotto in the 13th century; rules such as the vanishing point were first formulated by Brunelleschi in about 1413, his theory influencing Leonardo and Dürer. Isaac Newton's work on the optical spectrum influenced Goethe's Theory of Colours and in turn artists such as Philipp Otto Runge, J. M. W. Turner, the Pre-Raphaelites and Wassily Kandinsky. Artists may also choose to analyse the symmetry of a scene. Tools may be applied by mathematicians who are exploring art, or artists inspired by mathematics, such as M. C. Escher (inspired by H. S. M. Coxeter) and the architect Frank Gehry, who more tenuously argued that computer aided design enabled him to express himself in a wholly new way.|$|E

Engineers and artillerymen were obliged to study the complete course, which resulted in their branches being considered the most prestigious.

60|$|Science, therefore, {{following}} {{one cause}} to its various effects, while art traces one effect to its multiplied and diversified causes and conditions, there is {{need of a}} set of intermediate scientific truths, derived from the higher generalities of science, and destined to serve as the generalia or first principles of the various arts. The scientific operation of framing these intermediate principles, M. Comte characterizes as one of those results of philosophy which are reserved for futurity. The only complete example which he points out as actually realized, and which can be held up as a type to be imitated in more important matters, is the general theory of the art of <b>Descriptive</b> <b>Geometry,</b> as conceived by M. Monge. It is not, however, difficult to understand what the nature of these intermediate principles must generally be. After framing the most comprehensive possible conception of the end to be aimed at, that is, of the effect to be produced, and determining in the same comprehensive manner the set of conditions on which that effect depends, there remains to be taken, a general survey of the resources which can be commanded for realizing this set of conditions; and when the result of this survey has been embodied in the fewest and most extensive propositions possible, those propositions will express the general relation between the available means and the end, and will constitute the general scientific theory of the art, from which its practical methods will follow as corollaries.|$|E

5000|$|Brady {{was elected}} a Fellow of the Royal Society (FRS) in 1997. His {{certificate}} of election reads: [...] Distinguished {{for his work}} in artificial intelligence and its application to the visual guidance of robot manipulators and vehicles. He {{was one of the first}} information scientists to apply (David) Marr's ideas on human vision to the engineering problems of computer vision. His pioneer work on the automatic transcription of handwritten coding sheets demonstrated the need for visual representations at many levels of description, and led to the first working theory of the early visual processes involved in human reading. His work on the shapes of three-dimensional surfaces imaginatively combined ideas from group theory, <b>descriptive</b> differential <b>geometry</b> and the optimal interpretation of noisy measurements. His work in robot vision has demonstrated the paramount importance of computational stability in the algorithms used for integrating the information from successive images, and has shown how the performance of conventional stereo algorithms can be equalled in efficiency and reliability by the matching of distinctive curves. He has recently applied the techniques of stereo and photometric stereo to the monitoring of glaucoma development, and is actively involved in other medical applications.Through the work of his research groups, in both the UK and the USA, he has been a pioneer in the push towards the hardware demonstration of robots with diverse sensory capabilities. In this way, and through the scientific journals he has founded and/or edited, he has exerted a major influence over the development of robotics and artificial intelligence, particularly robot vision.|$|R
40|$|The present volume {{provides}} a fascinating overview of geometrical ideas and perceptions {{from the earliest}} cultures to the mathematical and artistic concepts of the 20 th century. It is the English translation of the 3 rd edition of the well-received German book “ 5000 Jahre Geometrie,” in which geometry {{is presented as a}} chain of developments in cultural history and their interaction with architecture, the visual arts, philosophy, science, and engineering. Geometry originated in the ancient cultures along the Indus and Nile Rivers and in Mesopotamia, experiencing its first “Golden Age” in Ancient Greece. Inspired by the Greek mathematics, a new germ of geometry blossomed in the Islamic civilizations. Through the Oriental influence on Spain, this knowledge later spread to Western Europe. Here, as part of the medieval Quadrivium, the understanding of geometry was deepened, leading to a revival during the Renaissance. Together with parallel achievements in India, China, Japan and the ancient American cultures, the European approaches formed the ideas and branches of geometry we know in the modern age: coordinate methods, analytical <b>geometry,</b> <b>descriptive</b> and projective <b>geometry</b> in the 17 th an 18 th centuries, axiom systems, geometry as a theory with multiple structures, and geometry in computer sciences in the 19 th and 20 th centuries. Each chapter of the book starts with a table of key historical and cultural dates and ends with a summary of essential contents of geometry in the respective era. Compelling examples invite the reader to further explore the problems of geometry in ancient and modern times. The book will appeal to mathematicians interested in Geometry, and to all readers with an interest in cultural history. From letters to the authors for the German language edition I hope it gets a translation, as there is no comparable work. Prof. J.
