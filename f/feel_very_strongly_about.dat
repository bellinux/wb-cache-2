2500|$|Opposition to Roe on {{the bench}} grew when President Reagan, who {{supported}} legislative restrictions on abortion, began making federal judicial appointments in 1981. Reagan denied {{that there was any}} litmus test: [...] "I have never given a litmus test to anyone that I have appointed to the bench…. I <b>feel</b> <b>very</b> <b>strongly</b> <b>about</b> those social issues, but I also place my confidence {{in the fact that the}} one thing that I do seek are judges that will interpret the law and not write the law.

[...] "I <b>feel</b> <b>very</b> <b>strongly</b> <b>about</b> putting questions; it partakes {{too much}} of the style of the day of judgment. You start a question, and it's like {{starting}} a stone. You sit quietly {{on the top of a}} hill; and away the stone goes, starting others; and presently some bland old bird (the last you would have thought of) is knocked on the head in his own back garden and the family have to change their name. No sir, I make it a rule of mine: the more it looks like Queer Street, the less I ask." ...|$|E

There was no line shown. You must remember that there isn't a doubt about that. The hounds were all astray when we joined them. It's a great question whether they brought their fox into that first covert. There are they who think that Bodkin was just riding across the Puckeridge country {{in search of a}} fox." [...] Bodkin was Mr. Fairlawn's huntsman. [...] "If you admit that kind of thing, where will you be? As a hunting country, just nowhere. Then as a sportsman, where are you? It is necessary to put down such gross fraud. My own impression is that Mr. Fairlawn should be turned out from being master. I own I <b>feel</b> <b>very</b> <b>strongly</b> <b>about</b> it. But then I always have been fond of hunting." ...|$|E

The SouthSide <b>feels</b> <b>very</b> <b>strongly</b> <b>about</b> the state of Florida and its status within the Hip Hop Nation.|$|R
50|$|According to some commentators, {{what happens}} in {{practise}} in the VCLT regime is the third option. What follows from article 20 paragraph 4(b) and article 21 paragraph 3 VCLT {{is that the only}} thing which can happen is, that if an objecting state <b>feels</b> <b>very</b> <b>strongly</b> <b>about</b> a reservation, it will state that the whole treaty is not in effect between the reserving state and itself. This rarely happens, thus the reservation stands, whether it passed the legality test or not.|$|R

5000|$|Johns is {{also known}} for his animal rights support, having {{revealed}} {{that he is a}} vegan in 1998, although it was stated that he is a pescetarian in 2009. The Neon Ballroom song [...] "Spawn Again" [...] features Johns' views on animal liberation, but he stated in a subsequent interview: [...] "I'm not telling people how to eat or how to change their lives, I just wanted to express my opinion in a song and it's something, as I said, I <b>feel</b> <b>very</b> <b>strongly</b> <b>about</b> so that's just how I express myself through music." ...|$|E
5000|$|Kurtzman {{discussed}} {{his approach to}} Two-Fisted Tales in a 1980 interview: When I thought of doing a war book, the business of what to say about war {{was very important to}} me and was uppermost in my mind, because I did then <b>feel</b> <b>very</b> <b>strongly</b> <b>about</b> not wanting to say anything glamorous about war, and everything that went before Two-Fisted Tales had glamorized war. Nobody had done anything on the depressing aspects of war, and this, to me, was such a dumb—it was a terrible disservice to the children.|$|E
5000|$|McKinley {{says she}} writes about strong heroines because she <b>feels</b> <b>very</b> <b>strongly</b> <b>about</b> the {{potential}} for girls to be [...] "doing things", and she feels that the selection of fantasy literature featuring girls is scarce and unsatisfactory. According to biographer Marilyn H. Karrenbrock, [...] "McKinley's females do not simper; they do not betray their own nature to win a man's approval. But neither do they take love lightly or put their own desires before anything else. In McKinley's books, the romance, like the adventure, is based upon ideals of faithfulness, duty, and honor." ...|$|R
2500|$|Anna Walton as Princess Nuala: King Balor's {{daughter}} and Nuada's twin sister. She {{is described as}} [...] "very light" [...] while Nuada is [...] "very dark", creating a yin and yang dynamic. She elaborated on the incestuous tones between her character and Prince Nuada, [...] "He's the dark side and she's the light side and they're pulled apart and pulled back together again, and she's {{trying to get away}} because she knows there is something she has to do. He can't let that go and they can't really do anything without each other so it's a really interesting thing." [...] Her character also forms a relationship with Abe Sapien, and Walton noted their similarities, [...] "They are both slightly lost souls and they understand each other." [...] Walton spoke of her character's sense of purpose, [...] "She <b>feels</b> <b>very</b> <b>strongly</b> <b>about</b> what she has to do in the film, and then her absolute connection and love for the Earth and what we are given. That's what she's here to protect... Her relationship with her brother, and how he is almost a part of her but she has to break away and will {{do whatever it takes to}} stop him from achieving what he wants to achieve, which is the mass destruction of mankind." ...|$|R
2500|$|Viewers saw Natalie and Barry’s {{marriage}} sour {{towards the}} end of 2002 when she was momentarily tempted by the charms of his scheming half-brother Nathan (Doug Allen), and then, in the New Year’s Eve episode, she was shown to rekindle a secret “steamy affair” with old flame, Ricky, which continued into 2003. [...] Speed commented “Natalie's always had strong feelings for Ricky. And now she's grown tired of being a mother to baby Jack and Barry!…family is everything to her, so she would have to <b>feel</b> <b>very</b> <b>strongly</b> indeed <b>about</b> someone to put her marriage at risk. As for Ricky, I suppose Natalie's always held a torch for him. He was her first love who finished with her, so she's been left with a kind of 'what if?' feeling. When Natalie was younger she was easily seduced, {{and a little bit of}} that remains. She can be easily swayed if someone is nice." ...|$|R

He and other members of The Crew <b>feel</b> <b>very</b> <b>strongly</b> <b>about</b> the preservation of the sport of bodysurfing and their safety, both of which are jeopardized by board surfers and boogie board surfers, primarily the inexperienced latter. Another frustration that Terry has vocalized is that against big name surfers who bring large crews of photographers in order to turn The Wedge into a photo opportunity.

What the play is saying is as important today as it was when it was written. I <b>feel</b> <b>very</b> <b>strongly</b> <b>about</b> war, militarism, killing people ... and I haven't found a better writer who makes that point more clearly than Euripides. The play is about the folly of war, the folly of people killing others and forgetting {{that they are going to}} die themselves." ...|$|E

I <b>feel</b> <b>very</b> <b>strongly</b> <b>about</b> this issue as do my colleagues Diana Johnson and Karl Turner. There is a feasible option available in the business plan and a statutory duty on the employer to consider it seriously before announcing redundancies.

She said, it just had to be healthy in nature. While promoting the show in Mumbai, she said [...] "I <b>feel</b> <b>very</b> <b>strongly</b> <b>about</b> overt competitiveness. The word competition has a narrow frame... it has to be healthy. The line is very thin. At the same time, I feel competition is necessary because children do revel and excel in it sometimes when they are put in adverse situations. But that does not mean parents need to put pressurechildren." [...] When Bendre was questioned about the feasibility of the programme and the negative side effects of shooting schedules, she said [...] "as long as the parents are not putting the pressure, and the child is not feeling the pressure and enjoying the experience, the reality shows are a platform which gives children confidence." ...|$|E

5000|$|Richard Thomas Condon (March 18, 1915 in New York City - April 9, 1996 in Dallas, Texas) was a {{prolific}} and popular American political novelist whose satiric works were generally {{presented in the}} form of thrillers or semi-thrillers. More than being particularly clever genre works, however, all 26 books were written in a style nearly always instantly recognizable as Condon's, while their focus was almost always obsessively directed at monetary greed and political corruption. Fast-moving and easily accessible, they generally combined elements of political satire, bare-knuckled outrage at the greed and corruption of those in power, and were written with extravagant characterizations and a uniquely sparkling and frequently humorous style. Condon himself once said: [...] "Every book I've ever written has been about abuse of power. I <b>feel</b> <b>very</b> <b>strongly</b> <b>about</b> that. I'd like people to know how deeply their politicians wrong them." [...] Condon occasionally achieved bestseller status, and many of his books were made into films, but today he is primarily remembered for two of his works: an early book, The Manchurian Candidate of 1959, and, many years later, for four novels about a family of New York gangsters named Prizzi.|$|E
5000|$|Carl Jung, {{who viewed}} the {{individual}} neurosis as deriving {{from the whole}} familial or social group, considered himself a case in point: [...] "I <b>feel</b> <b>very</b> <b>strongly</b> that I am {{under the influence of}} things or questions which were left incomplete and unanswered by my parents and grandparents and more distant ancestors...an impersonal karma within a family, which is passed on from parents to children".|$|R
