Some have commented that certain evenness indices “tend to strongly overestimate evenness” or “give unreasonably high values of evenness” (Bulla 1994, pp. 167, 169).

This approach enables direct yarn mass determination in 1 mm range for evenness, an increase {{by a factor}} of eight over the most common comercial solutions (8 mm), and will also enable hairiness measurementup to 1 mm with high accuracy. This system determines all parameters commonly used in textile industry, for different sensitive values defined by the operator. It also presents new parameters, not measured by commercial equipments 8 integral deviation rate-IDR, different signal processing techniques to detect error patterns (Fast Walsh-hadanard transform-FWHT) and other adapted parametrs (desviation rate-DR, Spectrograms 8 Fast Fourier Transform-FFT), Coefficient of Variation-CV, Mean Deviation-U, number and lenght of faults).

40|$|The {{concept and}} methods of {{ecological}} diversity in communities were applied to phytoplankton categorized by flow cytometric measurements related to size and chlorophyll content. Each cytometric signature was condensed to single numerical values indicative of diversity and <b>evenness.</b> <b>Measurements</b> pooled from studies disparate in temporal and spatial scales indicated greater chlorophyll biomass and primary production with greater cytometric diversity and evenness. Future development of these ideas may help link biological oceanographic processes with patterns established through ecological processes at the community level. The concept of biotic diversity is a central theme in community ecology, both in general (Pielou 1975; Magurran 1988) and in particular for marine communities (Frontier 1985; McGowan and Walker 1993). Diversity embodies two notions: richness, which indicates the number {{of different kinds of}} organisms; and evenness, which indicates the relative “importance ” (e. g. abundance) of the different kinds of organisms. Thus, a community with say 100 species i...|$|R

To extract {{the main body of}} the yarn accurately, the yarn images are processed sequentially with threshold segmentation and morphological opening operation. Then the coefficient of variation (CV value) of diameter is calculated to characterize the yarn <b>evenness.</b> The <b>measurement</b> process achieves result (CV value) which can be compared with USTER evenness tester by image processing techniques. By comparing different methods which use different algorithms, a suitable method is chosen to be used in this new measurement system.

40|$|In {{attempting}} to characterize a community, {{it is necessary}} to measure ecological attributes to quantitatively describe the unique aspects of that community and to make comparisons. This thesis reports on a long-term investigation of the community ecology of a turtle assemblage in the Tennessee River Gorge relative to the following hypotheses: 1) ecologically generalized species will be the most numerically abundant forms present in the TRG, 2) adult sex ratios of turtle populations in the TRG will be biased in favor of males, and 3) mean adult body size measurements and size dimorphism index (SDI) values of turtle populations in the TRG will be consistent with those reported from other populations. To examine these hypotheses, a balanced trapping regime was carried out during May through August, from 2000 to 2006, in the Tennessee River Gorge. Trapping methods included baited traps (hoop nets and fyke nets) and unbaited traps (fyke nets, basking traps, hand capture, and trammel nets). The relative abundance of generalist turtle species was consistently greater than that of more sensitive species during each study year and for the entire study period. Habitat specialist were detected in relatively low numbers and were absent during some years of the study. Accordingly, species diversity and <b>evenness</b> <b>measurements</b> were low and reflected the numerical dominance of a few species. Adult sex ratios for all turtle species in the TRG were biased in favor of males, indicating differential survival rates for adult female turtles. Multiple limiting factors may be responsible for this finding as the ecology of each species is unique. Observed adult body measurements for TRG turtle populations were generally larger than those reported from other studies within their respective ranges. One species in particular, Sternotherus odoratus, was observed to display a carapace length that was significantly greater than those reported from southern or northern climes. This finding appears contrary to the theory that body sizes for turtles increase with latitude, or Bergmann 2 ̆ 7 s rule. The SDI values from the TRG turtles were not as substantial as those reported from other localities, primarily due to the relatively greater body sizes achieved by male turtles in the TRG. Generally, larger body sizes and observed dimorphism index values for some species could be the end result of individual processes acting simultaneously, such as: 1) variable maturation rates for the sexes, 2) genetic variability, and 3) a productive ecosystem...|$|R
40|$|ABSTRACT: In Norway, {{recycled}} {{concrete aggregate}} {{has recently been}} introduced in design codes for road construction, including material specifications. A number of field projects have revealed good functional properties (proven suitability), {{despite the fact that}} the mechanical properties of the materials in many cases do not comply with specifications concerning mechanical strength. Many traditional test methods for mechanical properties are clearly not suitable for this kind of materials. A proper evaluation should therefore be based on performance-related (functional) tests. The paper discusses these field-lab contradictions with reference to a field trial at highway E 6 south of Trondheim. There crushed concrete is used as sub-base layer in a pavement designed for rather heavy traffic (ADT> 10000). Several field and laboratory tests have been conducted before, during and after construction, and the paper is focusing on comparing field tests with both empirical (old) and functional (new) laboratory tests, including a large-scale cyclic triaxial test apparatus. The road was constructed 2003 - 2004, and will be followed up by frequent bearing capacity (FWD), rutting and <b>evenness</b> (IRI) <b>measurements.</b> These data and results, both from field and laboratory investigations, will give valuable inputs to new Norwegian pavement design standards. This should encourage further use of recycled/secondary materials...|$|R
40|$|Vesselness filters aim at {{enhancing}} tubular {{structures in}} medical images. The most popular vesselness filters {{are based on}} eigenanalyses of the Hessian matrix computed at different scales. However, Hessian-based methods have well-known limitations, most of them related {{to the use of}} second order derivatives. In this paper, we propose an alternative strategy in which ring-like patterns are sought in the local orientation distribution of the gradient. The method takes advantage of symmetry properties of ring-like patterns in the spherical harmonics domain. For bright vessels, gradients not pointing towards the center are filtered out from every local neighborhood in a first step. The opposite criterion is used for dark vessels. Afterwards, structuredness, <b>evenness</b> and uniformness <b>measurements</b> are computed from the power spectrum in spherical harmonics of both the original and the half-zeroed orientation distribution of the gradient. Finally, the features are combined into a single vesselness measurement. Alternatively, a structure tensor that is suitable for vesselness can be estimated before the analysis in spherical harmonics. The two proposed methods are called Ring Pattern Detector (RPD) and Filtered Structure Tensor (FST) respectively. Experimental results with computed tomography angiography data show that the proposed filters perform better compared to the state-of-the-art. QC 20150811. QC 20160201 </p...|$|R
