500|$|The EP {{has been}} seen by critics simply as [...] "unapologetic {{hardcore}} punk" [...] and being the most aggressive work Gallows had done so far. A more Americanised influence can be heard throughout the EP as it's been likened to bands like Cancer Bats and Every Time I Die. MacNeil had always stated the EP helped build on what he has always liked about Gallows; he considers it being [...] "Four songs like {{a kick in the}} teeth". In the writing of the new extended play the band focused on less typical song structures and focused on the chaotic sound from live shows. MacNeil believed that [...] "sometimes you don’t need to overcomplicate things. Obviously, we're trying to write music that’s chaotic and is going to be something that comes across vicious-sounding live... you don’t repeat it four times, you <b>do</b> <b>it</b> <b>once,</b> and you don’t have a bridge." [...] Gallows guitarist Laurent Barnard said how the EP would not sound similar to the band's third studio album by saying [...] "If you're going to make a punk rock EP, you might as well make it the most punk rock thing you can really." ...|$|E
2500|$|In an {{interview}} with the band conducted on August 22, 2010 guitarist Brendt Allman answered a question about the probability of touring again after the European dates as follows: [...] "It's tough to say because there's {{a lot of different things}} going on in a lot of people's lives, but if we can <b>do</b> <b>it</b> <b>once,</b> we can probably do it twice." ...|$|E

[...] For the next few months, he confined himself to indoor pursuits, including resuming his lifelong hobby of stamp collecting. [...] In December 1921, after he had recuperated for several months, a physiotherapist began working with him {{to determine the extent}} of the damage. He was able to perform small exercises on his own, moving one muscle and then another. He was fitted with heavy steel braces that locked at the knee and provided enough stability that he could stand with crutches. In 1922, at Springwood, he worked diligently to make his way across the room. He set himself the goal of getting down the long driveway, managing to <b>do</b> <b>it</b> <b>once,</b> but never trying again.|$|E

Take example by your father, my boy, and be wery careful o' widders all your life, 'specially if they've kept a public-house, Sammy.'

2500|$|At the {{beginning}} of the novel, Dorothy is swept from her farm to Oz by a cyclone, which was frequently compared to the Free Silver movement in Baum's time. The yellow brick road represents the gold standard, and the Silver Shoes, which enable Dorothy to travel more comfortably, symbolizes the Populist Party's desire to construct a bimetallic standard of both gold and silver in place of the gold standard. [...] "Oz" [...] is the abbreviated form of ounce, a standard measure of gold. When Dorothy and the Scarecrow walk through the forest, the road begins to be rough and patchy, causing the Scarecrow to trip and fall numerous times. The Scarecrow's falls on the yellow brick road resemble the damage farmers faced owing to deflation caused by the scarcity of gold. Dorothy, however, simply [...] "walks around" [...] the holes in the road, showing that the bimetallic standard works. Even when gold was scarce, the other metal in the bimetal system would be relatively cheap, therefore one bypasses deflation. Throughout the book, most of the characters do not know the magic behind the silver shoes. It is not until Dorothy meets Glinda, the good Witch of the South, that she finds out that the silver shoes have had the power to transfer her back to Kansas all along. Baum is possibly alluding {{to the fact that the}} bimetallic standard has been a working solution to the economic crisis all along, though no one knows how to <b>do</b> <b>it.</b> <b>Once</b> Dorothy clicks her heels three times, she returns to Kansas, where she realizes that [...] "The Silver Shoes had fallen off in her flight through the air, and were lost forever in the desert." [...] The silver shoes were lost, much like the fight for the bimetallic standard, which began to fade away in 1900.|$|E

I believe you are right, Mr. Gibbs. I believe this whale has got in here and can't get out--or, at least, he thinks he can't--and nobody knows how long it's been since he first got in.
