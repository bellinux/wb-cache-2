40|$|In the 1970 ’s, the {{fatality}} index on Malaysian roads exceeded 20. In 1991, a Cabinet Committee on Road Safety {{was set up}} to come up with {{measures to}} reduce the predicted number of deaths by 30 % or translated into a fatality index of 3. 14 {{by the turn of the}} century. Among the measures suggested included the application of porous asphalt. Up to now, a number of major trunk roads have been paved with porous asphalt. This paper describes the method used to modify a porous asphalt gradation from Korea to suit Malaysian quarry practic. The method involved fabricating porous mixes accord-ing to four trial gradations and comparing them with mix properties stipulated in the Korean specifications. The adopted gradation is a trade-off between mix stability and permeability. Samples using this gradation were prepared using 60 / 70 conventional bitumen and 1 % <b>Drain</b> <b>Asphalt</b> Modified Additive (DAMA) and their design binder content determined from the results of the laboratory binder drainage and Cantabrian tests. The specimens were then evaluated for Marshall stability and resilient modulus at the design binder contents. The results indicate an improvement in mix properties with the addition of 1 % DAMA...|$|E
40|$|AbstractThis paper {{reports about}} the {{experimental}} investigations carried out on stone matrix asphalt mixes (SMA) prepared using polymer modified bitumen PMB 70 with SBS and coconut fibers to prevent <b>drain</b> down of <b>asphalt.</b> Results were compared with SMA mixes prepared with neat bitumen VG 30 grade and coconut and cellulose fibers to prevent <b>drain</b> down of <b>asphalt.</b> Experimental work includes SMA mix design, static indirect tensile strength test at different temperatures, indirect tensile fatigue test and permanent deformation test. From the test results {{it was observed that}} stone matrix asphalt mix with PMB 70 and coconut fiber shows higher static indirect tensile strength at different temperatures, higher fatigue life and higher rut resistance when compared to control mix of SM...|$|R
40|$|This {{test method}} {{describes}} {{the procedure for}} determining the optimum bitumen content (OBC) for open graded friction course (OGFC) by examining the amount of <b>asphalt</b> <b>drain</b> down of an aggregate and unmodified asphalt binder mixture. This OBC should provide sufficient asphalt film thickness to provide good durability and avoid excessive asphalt drainage during production and placement. The procedure is used for OGFC with unmodified asphalt binder, polymer modified asphalt binder (PG–PM), and tire rubber modified asphalt binder (PG–TR), or asphalt rubber binder (ARB) ...|$|R
40|$|There is {{a growing}} concern about the {{scarcity}} of water resources due to population growth and increased demand for potable water. Thus, the rational use of water has become necessary for the conservation of such resources. The objective {{of this study is to}} estimate the potential for potable water savings in buildings of different sectors—residential, public and commercial—in the city of Florianópolis, southern Brazil, by using stormwater harvested from porous pavements. Models were constructed to assess infiltration and rainwater quality; samples of stormwater from a local road were collected to evaluate its quality; and computer simulation was performed to assess the potential for potable water savings and rainwater tank sizing. <b>Draining</b> <b>asphalt</b> concrete slabs with two types of modifiers were used, i. e., tire rubber and SBS polymer—styrene-butadiene-styrene. The Netuno computer programme was used to simulate the potential for potable water savings considering the use of rainwater for non-potable uses such as flushing toilets and urinals, cleaning external areas, and garden watering. Average stormwater infiltration was 85. 4 %. It was observed that stormwater is not completely pure. From the models, the pH was 5. 4 and the concentrations of ammonia, phosphorus, nitrite, and dissolved oxygen were 0. 41, 0. 14, 0. 002, and 9. 0 mg/L, respectively. The results for the stormwater runoff of a paved road were 0. 23, 0. 11, 0. 12, 0. 08, 1. 41, 2. 11, 0. 02, and 9. 0 mg/L for the parameters aluminium, ammonia, copper, chromium, iron, phosphorus, nitrite, and dissolved oxygen, respectively; and the pH was 6. 7. In the city of Florianópolis, which has a surface area of paved roads of approximately 11, 044, 216 m², the potential for potable water savings ranged from 1. 2 % to 19. 4 % in the residential sector, 2. 1 % to 75. 7 % in the public sector and 6. 5 % to 70. 0 % in the commercial sector...|$|R
50|$|The popular {{trend in}} trench drains are linear systems. Linear as in line drain. Made from {{materials}} such as polymer concrete, fiberglass, structural plastic and steel, liner systems are the channel and grate components that are assembled in the trench and around which concrete is poured to form a drain system. By themselves, these liner systems {{do not have the}} strength and integrity to hold up under the physical requirements needed for the drain. A concrete (or <b>asphalt)</b> <b>drain</b> body is required to encase the channel to give the channel compressive strength and rigidity to ensure the drain will be able to withstand the traffic load it was designed to handle.|$|R
40|$|Key Words: asphalt {{pavement}} structure, transition layer of graded crushed rock, layered system theory, structural stress analysis Abstract: The graded crushed rock layers is set between asphalt surface course and semi-rigidity base course to effectively prevent or reduce the reflection crack of semi-rigidity base course {{and improve the}} <b>draining</b> condition of <b>asphalt</b> pavement, however, the graded crushed rock is low in modulus and is provided with nonlinearity stress-strain characteristic, {{and the addition of}} this transition layer may cause the stress variation of pavement structure. Through applying KENPAVE pavement design program, analyze the mechanical response discipline on pavement structure layer by thickness variation of graded crushed rock layer and put forward the reasonable suggestions for structural design of {{asphalt pavement}} for transition layer of graded crushed rock...|$|R
30|$|These {{experimental}} results are explained as follows: fibers are dispersed in the asphalt, and the asphalt is adsorbed over the fiber’s surface as a monolayer, forming a strong binding force between the “fiber–asphalt” interfacial layer and three-dimensional spatial network. This network can be retained at high temperature, {{resulting in the}} formation of a thick mastic coating without <b>asphalt</b> <b>draining</b> down (Wiljanen 2003). The mineral fiber had the greatest effect on reducing the cone sink depth and improving the shear stress among these three fibers, due to its great networking structure. Moreover, fibers can absorb the light components in asphalt and increase the viscosity of asphalt mortar; therefore, fiber increases the shear strength of asphalt mortar. In addition, the fiber has high tensile strength which can hold asphalt and resist flowing and crack propagation more effectively (Li 1992).|$|R
40|$|Asphalts {{developed}} to offer better performances {{than the traditional}} asphalts are termed “special”. Used for different applications within the road pavement, they perform complementary, integrative or substitutive functions {{with respect to the}} traditional mixes. Non-skid and “high modulus” bituminous mixtures, splittmastix asphalt (SMA), cold micro-surfacings (slurry seal), single-layer surface treatments and most especially porous (<b>draining</b> and sound-absorbing) <b>asphalts</b> all come into this category. A decisive development breakthrough in the performance of materials for road construction was signalled by the introduction of modified bitumens, particularly as regards improvement of the characteristics of cohesion and resistance to loadings from vehicular traffic. The indispensable condition for the development of these technologies was therefore the ”invention” of modified bitumen, in other words the binder which, with the addition of different types of polymers, in suitable plants and under controlled conditions, modifies its structure with “inversion of phase”, greatly enhancing the performance. The basic concepts specifically regarding porous asphalt are discussed in the paper...|$|R
30|$|Physical {{properties}} of different fibers (mineral, cellulose, or carbon fiber) and their stabilizing and reinforcing effects on asphalt mortar performance were studied. Scanning electron microscopy {{was used to}} study the effect of fiber’s microstructure on asphalt mortar’s performance. Laboratory tests of mesh-basket draindown and oven heating were designed and performed to evaluate the fibers’ asphalt absorption and thermostability. A cone penetration {{test was used to}} study the flow resistance of fiber-modified asphalt mortar. Results showed that fiber can form a three-dimensional network structure in asphalt, and this network can be retained at high temperature. This network of fibers favors the formation of a thick coating of mastic without <b>asphalt</b> <b>draining</b> down. Cellulose fiber possessed a greater effect on asphalt absorption and stabilization than did the other fibers (mineral and carbon fiber). A dynamic shear rheometer was used to evaluate their rheological properties and rut resistance. Results indicated that fiber can effectively improve the rut and flow resistance of asphalt mortar. However, the bending beam rheometer results demonstrated that the addition of fiber had negative effects on the creep stiffness and creep rate of asphalt mortar.|$|R
