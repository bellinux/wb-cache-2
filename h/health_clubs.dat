One expression {{of this can be}} seen in the popularity and patronage of the <b>health</b> <b>club</b> facilities. <b>Health</b> <b>club</b> instructors are in a position and environment to disseminate nutritional information to a captive audience. The purpose of this study was to determine if there was a difference in nutritional knowledge between <b>health</b> <b>club</b> instructors and <b>health</b> <b>club</b> members. One hundred and sixty-seven people participated in the study. The subjects were comprised of 25 <b>health</b> <b>club</b> instructors and 142 <b>health</b> <b>club</b> members. A questionnaire designed to assess nutrition knowledge and to collect demographic data was administered. The Student's "t" Test, the Pearson's Product Moment Correlation Coefficient, Chi Square Analysis and frequencies were used to analyze the data. It was found that there was a significant difference in nutrition knowledge between <b>health</b> <b>club</b> instructors and <b>health</b> <b>club</b> members at the 0. 05 level of significance. Instructors achieved significantly higher scoies than members did on the nutrition knowledge test. A positive correlation was found between actual nutrition knowledge and perceived nutrition knowledge for the member participants, but not for the instructors. A positive correlation was also found between the number of nutrition classes taken and the level of nutrition knowledge for both the <b>health</b> <b>club</b> instructors and members...|$|R

25|$|Decades before {{health and}} fitness began being {{promoted}} by celebrities like Jane Fonda and Richard Simmons, LaLanne was already widely recognized for publicly preaching {{the health benefits of}} regular exercise and a good diet. He published numerous books on fitness and hosted the fitness television program The Jack LaLanne Show between 1953 and 1985. As early as 1936, at age 21, he opened one of the nation's first fitness gyms in Oakland, California, which became a prototype for dozens of similar gyms bearing his name. One of his 1950s television exercise programs was aimed toward women, whom he also encouraged to join his <b>health</b> <b>clubs.</b> He invented a number of exercise machines, including the pulley and leg extension devices and the Smith machine. Besides producing his own series of videos, he coached the elderly and disabled not to forgo exercise, believing it would enable them to enhance their strength.|$|E
25|$|Neptune Beach's {{two huge}} outdoor pools hosted {{swimming}} races and exhibitions by such famous swimmers as Olympian Johnny Weissmuller, who later starred {{as the original}} Tarzan, and Jack LaLanne, who started a chain of <b>health</b> <b>clubs.</b> The park closed down in 1939 because of the Great Depression, {{the completion of the}} San Francisco–Oakland Bay Bridge, people circumventing paying the admission price, and the rise of car culture. Once the Bay Bridge was complete, the rail lines, which ran right past the entrance to Neptune Beach {{on the way to the}} Alameda Mole and the Ferry, lost riders in droves. People began using their cars to escape the city and the immediate suburbs like Alameda and traveling further afield in California. Alameda lost its resort status as more distant locations became more attractive to cash-rich San Francisco tourists. Youngsters in town became aware of ways to avoid paying the dime for admission to the park. Strong swimmers or even waders could sneak in on the bay side just by swimming around the fence.|$|E
