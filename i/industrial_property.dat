Muller settled down in The Hague, where he was {{originally}} only occupied with his consular duties for Liberia, his membership of the Commission for Consular Examinations (since 1890) and his writing. Early in 1896 Muller was appointed as consul for the Orange Free State in the provinces of North and South Holland, assisting the consul general H.A.L. Hamelberg. He received the appointment on the strength of his publications about South Africa. After Hamelberg's death later in 1896 Muller succeeded him as consul general. It was an honorary position. In the following years Muller wholeheartedly set out to work for the Orange Free State and its interests in Europe. His predecessor Hamelberg had not only been consul general, but had on occasion also acted as special envoy to be able to negotiate treaties and accords with foreign powers. Muller also acted as special envoy and in this capacity inter alia enrolled the Orange Free State in the Universal Postal Union, the Paris Convention for the Protection of <b>Industrial</b> <b>Property,</b> and the Geneva Conventions, and negotiated treaties of friendship and trade with Germany, Switzerland, and the Netherlands. He also strengthened the consular representation of the Orange Free State in Europe and inquired into all kinds of practical issues like a cure for rinderpest and improved methods of irrigation.|$|E

25|$|Many {{countries}} protect unregistered well-known {{marks in}} accordance with their international obligations under the Paris Convention for the Protection of <b>Industrial</b> <b>Property</b> and the Agreement on Trade-Related Aspects of Intellectual Property Rights (the TRIPS Agreement). Consequently, not only big companies but also SMEs may {{have a good chance of}} establishing enough goodwill with customers so that their marks may be recognized as well-known marks and acquire protection without registration. It is, nevertheless, advisable to seek registration, taking into account that many countries provide for an extended protection of registered well-known marks against dilution (Art. 16.3 TRIPS), i.e., the reputation of the mark being weakened by the unauthorized use of that mark by others.|$|E

25|$|In addition, {{there are}} {{international}} treaty procedures, {{such as the}} procedures under the European Patent Convention (EPC) , that centralize some portion of the filing and examination procedure. Similar arrangements exist among the member states of ARIPO and OAPI, the analogous treaties among African countries, and the nine CIS member states that have formed the Eurasian Patent Organization. A key international convention relating to patents is the Paris Convention for the Protection of <b>Industrial</b> <b>Property,</b> initially signed in 1883. The Paris Convention sets out a range of basic rules relating to patents, and although the convention does not have direct legal effect in all national jurisdictions, {{the principles of the}} convention are incorporated into all notable current patent systems. The most significant aspect of the convention is the provision of the right to claim priority: filing an application in any one member state of the Paris Convention preserves the right for one year to file in any other member state, and receive the benefit of the original filing date. Another key treaty is the Patent Cooperation Treaty (PCT), administered by WIPO and covering more than 140 countries. The Patent Cooperation Treaty provides a unified procedure for filing patent applications to protect inventions in each of its contracting states. A patent application filed under the PCT is called an international application, or PCT application.|$|E

500|$|In 1833, a stagecoach {{road from}} Randolph to Jackson in Madison County, [...] east of Randolph, was established.

40|$|Setting: There exists {{very little}} {{supportive}} valuation literature for the valuation of <b>industrial</b> <b>properties</b> {{and the present}} state of research is capable of improvement.

Based on using standard valuation practices there should be a ground value derived for an industrial estate. Conclusion: When valuing <b>industrial</b> <b>properties</b> economic use is crucial, therefore the income approach is applied in order to attain the market value of the property. Difficulties which may arise include customary approaches for rent, property management costs and interest rates. Based on a Germany-wide cross-comparison with other automobile-producing properties a plausible range for the derivation of the groundvalue was determined.
