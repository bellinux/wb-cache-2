A result of this denationalising attitude is political chaos and economic impoverishment. The directors {{are convinced that the}} time <b>is</b> <b>ripe</b> <b>for</b> the foundation of a daily organ in the Press of Ireland which, being free from the influence of any English party, will deal with the affairs of Ireland from the Irish standpoint, and whilst asserting the National distinctiveness and independence of Ireland will promote combination and agreement amongst all political sections in Ireland on the questions of Language, Land, Taxation, Industries, Transit, Poor Law.|$|E

Both Olivias are changed women with new amounts of information about their opposing universes, and thus {{will be able to}} influence their Walters in how to proceed henceforth. The series can resume plot threads that have been given scant attention in recent weeks, such as Walter’s takeover of Massive Dynamic, and what I’m hoping will be an increased presence by Nina Sharp, whose role in the interuniverse machinations <b>is</b> <b>ripe</b> <b>for</b> exploration".|$|E

Other important influences were ethologists Nikolaas Tinbergen and Robert Hinde. Bowlby subsequently collaborated with Hinde. In 1953 Bowlby stated [...] "the time <b>is</b> <b>ripe</b> <b>for</b> a unification of psychoanalytic concepts with those of ethology, and to pursue the rich vein of research which this union suggests." [...] Konrad Lorenz had examined the phenomenon of [...] "imprinting", a behaviour characteristic of some birds and mammals which involves rapid learning of recognition by the young, of a [...] or comparable object.

In 1937, Gandhi discussed Zionism with his close Jewish friend Hermann Kallenbach. He said that Zionism was not the right answer to the problems faced by Jews and instead recommended Satyagraha. Gandhi thought the Zionists in Palestine represented European imperialism and used violence to achieve their goals; he argued that [...] "the Jews should disclaim any intention of realizing their aspiration {{under the protection of}} arms and should rely wholly on the goodwill of Arabs. No exception can possibly be taken to the natural desire of the Jews to find a home in Palestine. But they must wait for its fulfillment till Arab opinion <b>is</b> <b>ripe</b> <b>for</b> it." ...|$|E

I thought, maybe there's {{something wrong with the}} media. Maybe they're not covering us fairly. I'm just using it as a pun, but there’s a bit of truth to this. We don't get a fair shake. The people who believe in liberty and limited government don't expect it from the ordinary media." [...] Speaking about his youth appeal, he noted, [...] "They don’t sit and watch TV and turn the programs on at seven o'clock to watch us like that – so I thought the technology was there.

500|$|Kenyatta and his {{government}} were anti-communist, and in June 1965 he warned that [...] "it is naive {{to think that there}} is no danger of imperialism from the East. In world power politics the East has as much designs upon us as the West and would like to serve their own interests." [...] His governance was often criticised by communists and other leftists, some of whom accused him of being a fascist. When Chinese Communist official Zhou Enlai visited Dar es Salaam, his statement that [...] "Africa <b>is</b> <b>ripe</b> <b>for</b> revolution" [...] was clearly aimed largely at Kenya. In 1964, Kenyatta impounded a secret shipment of Chinese armaments that passed through Kenyan territory on its way to Uganda. Obote personally visited Kenyatta to apologise. In June 1967, Kenyatta declared the Chinese Chargé d'Affairs persona non grata in Kenya and recalled the Kenyan ambassador from Peking. Relations with the Soviet Union were also strained; Kenyatta shut down the Lumumba Institute—an organisation named after the Congolese independence leader Patrice Lumumba—on the basis that it was a front for Soviet influence in Kenya.|$|E

2500|$|We {{agree that}} the {{challenge}} to 25524.2 <b>is</b> <b>ripe</b> <b>for</b> judicial review, but that the questions concerning 25524.1(b) are not. The basic rationale of the ripeness doctrine [...] "is to prevent the courts, through avoidance of premature adjudication, from entangling themselves in abstract disagreements over administrative policies, and also to protect the agencies from judicial interference until an administrative decision has been formalized and its effects felt in a concrete way by the challenging parties." [...] Abbott Laboratories v. Gardner, [...] 387 [...] U.S. 136, 148 -149 (1967).
