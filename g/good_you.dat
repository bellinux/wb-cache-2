25|$|Singer's {{ideas have}} contributed to the rise of {{effective}} altruism. He argues that people should not only try to reduce suffering, but reduce it in the most effective manner possible. While Singer has previously written at length about the moral imperative to reduce poverty and eliminate the suffering of nonhuman animals, particularly in the meat industry, he writes about how the effective altruism movement is doing these things more effectively in his 2015 book, The Most <b>Good</b> <b>You</b> Can Do. He is a board member of Animal Charity Evaluators, a charity evaluator used by many members of the effective altruism community which recommends the most cost-effective animal advocacy charities and interventions.|$|E

Clinton often expresses a certain maxim which is often attributed to John Wesley: [...] "Do all the <b>good</b> <b>you</b> can, by all the means you can, in all the ways you can." [...] In fact, Clinton repeated this saying in her acceptance speech at the 2016 Democratic National Convention, adding that her mother Dorothy [...] "made sure I learned [...] words from our Methodist faith." ...|$|E

[...] McNamara uses the story as a parallel to the usage of Agent Orange during the Vietnam War, while he was Secretary of Defense, to illustrate the ninth lesson of the film: [...] "In order to do <b>good,</b> <b>you</b> may have to engage in evil." ...|$|E

[...] Regarding Reyes' choice to work with Johnson {{at the end of the}} episode, Luna said that [...] "a lot of that is I respect her power and I respect her.

[...] Moses initially charged $3 to $5 for a painting, depending upon its size, and as her fame increased her works were sold for $8,000 to $10,000. Her winter paintings {{are reminiscent of}} some of the known winter paintings of Pieter Bruegel the Elder, although she had never seen his work. A German fan of her work said, [...] "There emanates from her paintings a light-hearted optimism; the world she shows us is beautiful and it is <b>good.</b> <b>You</b> feel at home in all these pictures, and you know their meaning. The unrest and the neurotic insecurity of the present day make us inclined to enjoy the simple and affirmative outlook of Grandma Moses." ...|$|E

When asked about the secrecy of the screenplay, David Koepp answered, [...] " [...] wouldn't give [...] to anybody". Koepp explained he would e-mail it to him, and he would give a section of the script that was relating to whatever somebody was doing. Miranda Otto thought of not even discussing the story with her family and friends. Otto said, [...] "I know some people who always say, 'Oh, everything's so secret.' I think it's good. In the old days people didn't get to know much about movies before they came out and nowadays there's just so much information.

500|$|But here I {{would not}} be misunderstood. By the love of our country, I do not mean loyalty to our King, for that is a duty of another nature, and a man may be very loyal, in the common sense of the word, without one grain of public good in his heart. Witness this very kingdom we live in. I verily believe, that since the {{beginning}} of the world, no nation upon earth ever shewed (all circumstances considered), such high constant marks of loyalty in all their action and behaviour as we have done; and at the same time, no people ever appeared more utterly void of what is called public spirit ... therefore, I shall think my time not ill-spent if I can persuade most and all of you who hear me, to shew the love you have for your country by endeavouring in your several situations to do all the public <b>good</b> <b>you</b> can. For I am certain persuaded that all our misfortunes arise from no other original cause than that general disregard among us to the public welfare.|$|E
500|$|Despite the {{production}} from Sayers, the Bears {{as a whole}} struggled to find success; in games that Sayers played, the team compiled a record of 29 wins, 36 losses, and 3 ties, and failed to reach the postseason. Because of this, Sayers' main focus each postseason was on the Pro Bowl, where he excelled. Showcasing his breakaway talents, throughout his Pro Bowl career he achieved runs of 74, 52, 51, 48, and 42 yards. In the Pro Bowl following his rookie season, he had kickoff returns of 51 and 48 yards, despite limited opportunities due to the East's attempts to punt and kick away from him. In the next season's game, his 10 yards-per-carry average set a Pro Bowl record. He was named the [...] "back of the game", an honor he received again in 1968 and 1969, joining Johnny Unitas as the only players to win three Pro Bowl MVP awards. [...] "The Pro Bowl {{is the time to}} prove how <b>good</b> <b>you</b> are, playing against the best of your peers," [...] recalled Sayers. [...] "I took it as a challenge. I came into the game in shape, came to play." ...|$|E
500|$|Several pre-release {{reviews of}} the episode were {{generally}} positive. Bruce Miller of the Sioux City Journal gave the episode a largely positive review and noted that [...] "If you can erase last season from your mind, you'll see this ... is exactly how The Office should have carried on after Steve Carell left." [...] Furthermore, he praised the addition of Duke and Lacy, calling their performances [...] "so <b>good</b> <b>you</b> could see them become {{the centerpiece of a}} new series." [...] Verne Gay of Newsweek awarded the episode an [...] "A–" [...] and called the installment [...] "very (very) funny." [...] He was especially happy about the addition of Lacy and Duke, calling them [...] "flashbacks to a younger Jim and Dwight." [...] Furthermore, he noted that [...] "the ninth and final season actually may offer completion" [...] of a show that has just [...] "merely offered variations on [...] tics" [...] for the past eight seasons. Bob Owen of the Pittsburgh Post-Gazette called the episode [...] "generally funnier than [...] was last season" [...] and wrote that the episode would be a good opportunity [...] "for viewers who quit the [...] last year ... {{to come back to the}} show." [...] Particularly, he was excited to [...] "see the seeds of the show's end planted." ...|$|E

500|$|David Wiegand of the San Francisco Chronicle {{gave the}} program a rave review and saying that, [...] " [...] <b>good</b> <b>you</b> can't help {{wondering}} {{why no one}} thought of it before, a compelling mix of credible real-life melodrama with a fictionalized approximation {{of what it takes}} to get a Broadway show from the idea stage to opening night. Robert Bianco of USA Today wrote that [...] "Unless you're allergic to musicals in general and Broadway in particular, you should find that a compelling central story, a strong cast, an out-of-the-procedural-mold premise and some rousing, roof-raising numbers more than compensate for any lingering problems." [...] He ultimately gave it three and a half stars out of four. The A.V. Club reviewer Noel Murray praised the cast and Eileen's divorce storyline. He mainly criticized the staging and arrangement of the musical numbers saying they threatened the realism of the show and wrote they weren't completely [...] "digetic". He ultimately gave the episode a B. Another A.V. Club reviewer Todd VanDerWerff criticized the series for not avoiding clichés but also wrote [...] "the show is so damned sincere about how much it embraces the clichés of the backstage Broadway story that those inclined to like this sort of thing—and I'm very much one of them—will forgive it some of these excesses." [...] He also criticized the adoption storyline. Despite this, he went on to compare the series to Hill Street Blues, ER and The West Wing.|$|E
500|$|The {{inclusion}} of a Native American character in Star Trek: Voyager was suggested {{at an early stage}} {{in the development of the}} series. The producers were looking for an ethnic background which had not been seen before as a main character in the franchise. It was hoped that a Native American character would prove to be an inspiration in the same way that the appearance of Uhura in [...] later inspired Whoopi Goldberg and other African Americans. Executive producer Jeri Taylor said, [...] "It seemed to us that Native Americans needed that same kind of role model and that same kind of boost... the future looks <b>good,</b> <b>you</b> have purpose, you have worth, you have value, you will be leaders, you will be powerful. That was one character choice we had early on." [...] Taylor's notes from the early production in July 1993 describe the character as [...] "First Officer – a human native American male, a 'Queequeg' person who has renounced Earth and lives as an expatriate on another planet. A mystical, mysterious man with whom the Captain has some prior connection, not explained." [...] A month later, this description was expanded with the line, [...] "This man has made another choice – to re-enter the world of Starfleet." [...] Chakotay was not the first Native American character to appear in the franchise, with [...] "The Paradise Syndrome" [...] in the [...] of Star Trek: The Original Series showing a group of displaced humans following a Native-American-like culture.|$|E
500|$|What {{became known}} as the [...] "Norway debate" [...] opened on 7 May, and lasted for two days. The initial speeches, {{including}} Chamberlain's, were nondescript, but Admiral of the Fleet Sir Roger Keyes, member for Portsmouth North, in full uniform, delivered a withering attack on the conduct of the Norway campaign, though he excluded Churchill from criticism. Leo Amery then delivered a speech which he concluded by echoing Oliver Cromwell's words on dissolving the Long Parliament: [...] "You have sat here too long for any <b>good</b> <b>you</b> are doing. Depart, I say, and let us have done with you. In the name of God, go!" [...] When Labour announced that they would call for a division of the House of Commons, Chamberlain called upon his [...] "friends—and I still have some friends in this House—to support the Government tonight". Though {{the use of the word}} [...] "friends" [...] was a conventional term to refer to party colleagues, and, according to biographer Robert Self, many MPs took it that way, it was an [...] "error of judgment" [...] for Chamberlain to refer to party loyalty [...] "when the gravity of the war situation required national unity". Lloyd George joined the attackers and Churchill concluded the debate with a vigorous speech in support of the government. When the division took place, the government, which had a normal majority of over 200, prevailed by only 81, with 38MPs in receipt of the government whip voting against it, with between 20 and 25 abstaining.|$|E
