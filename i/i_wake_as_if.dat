And often, in my dreams, some sunny spot, the bright {{memorial}} of a roving hour, will rise upon my sight, and, when <b>I</b> <b>wake,</b> <b>I</b> feel <b>as</b> <b>if</b> I {{had been in}} Canaan. Why am I not? The caravan that bears my uncle's goods across the Desert would bear me too. But I rest here, my miserable life running to seed in the dull misery of this wretched city, and do nothing. Why, the old captivity was empire to our inglorious bondage. We have no Esther now to share their thrones, no politic Mordecai, no purple-vested Daniel. O Jerusalem, Jerusalem! I do believe one sight of thee would nerve me to the sticking-point. And yet to gaze upon thy fallen state, my uncle tells me that of the Temple not a stone remains. 'Tis horrible. Is there no hope?' ...|$|R

60|$|At four <b>I</b> <b>woke,</b> <b>as</b> <b>I</b> always did, and {{proceeded}} {{to take one of}} my powders. Curiously enough, before I tasted it, the grain appeared to me to be rather coarser and more granular than the quinine I had originally put there. I took a pinch between my finger and thumb, and placed it on my tongue by way of testing it. Instead of being bitter, the powder, I found, was insipid and almost tasteless.|$|R

5|$|Kitsune are {{commonly}} portrayed as lovers, usually in stories involving a young human male and a kitsune {{who takes the}} form of a human woman. The kitsune may be a seductress, but these stories are more often romantic in nature. Typically, the young man unknowingly marries the fox, who proves a devoted wife. The man eventually discovers the fox's true nature, and the fox-wife is forced to leave him. In some cases, the husband <b>wakes</b> <b>as</b> <b>if</b> from a dream, filthy, disoriented, and far from home. He must then return to confront his abandoned family in shame.|$|R
60|$|Then in {{the thirteenth}} century, men <b>wake</b> <b>as</b> <b>if</b> they heard an alarum {{through the whole}} vault of heaven, and true human life begins again, and the cradle of this life is the Val d'Arno.

She would have Harry lead in Beatrix to the supper-room, going herself with my young Lord Viscount; {{and to this}} party came Tom Tusher directly, whom four at least out of the company of five wished away. Away he went, however, {{as soon as the}} sweetmeats were put down, and then, by the great crackling fire, his mistress or Beatrix, with her blushing graces, filling his glass for him, Harry told the story of his campaign, and passed the most delightful night his life had ever known. The sun was up long ere he was, so deep, sweet, and refreshing was his slumber. He <b>woke</b> <b>as</b> <b>if</b> angels had been watching at his bed all night. I dare say one that was as pure and loving as an angel had blessed his sleep with her prayers.|$|R

[...] "The rogue has no need of showing his brazen-faced trull to be known! I chased him, for six-and-thirty hours, in the chops of St. George's, no later than the last season; and the fellow ran about us, like a dolphin playing under a ship's fore-foot. We had him, now on our weather bow, and now crossing our course, and, once in a while, in our <b>wake,</b> <b>as</b> <b>if</b> he had been a Mother Carey's chicken looking for our crumbs. He seems snug enough in that cove, to be sure, and yet I'll wager the pay of any month in the twelve, that he gives us the slip.

Cecil (also in her vampire form, but {{dressed in a white}} wedding gown and with her hair down) sits up beside him and smiles. The film ends with Klaha walking down the aisle, carrying Cecil in his arms. The final intertitle states their feelings for each other: [...] "The only one I want is you." ...|$|R
5000|$|... "Never Say Goodbye" [...] is {{the second}} single from Yoko Ono's 1982 album It's Alright (I See Rainbows). Like many of Ono's songs from this period, the lyrics deal with her {{emotional}} healing following {{the murder of her}} husband John Lennon. The upbeat new wave song samples a recording of Lennon screaming Yoko's name from their Wedding Album, followed by her son Sean <b>waking</b> her, <b>as</b> <b>if</b> it were a bad dream. The song garnered minor airplay upon release. [...] "Loneliness" [...] appeared on the B-side. The 1995 New York Rock version was also released as a single.|$|R

6000|$|I {{have now}} three {{bedrooms}} arranged {{as my own}} particular dens. One of [...] the other two was also a choice of Uncle Roger's.

I slept in it last night, and [...] when <b>I</b> <b>woke,</b> <b>as</b> in my travelling I was accustomed to do, at dawn, I [...] saw from my bed through an open window--a small window, for it is in [...] a fortress tower--the whole great expanse to the east. Not far off, [...] and springing from the summit of a great ruin, where long ago a seed [...] had fallen, rose a great silver-birch, and the half-transparent, [...] drooping branches and hanging clusters of leaf broke the outline of [...] the grey hills beyond, for the hills were, for a wonder, grey instead [...] of blue. There was a mackerel sky, with the clouds dropping on the [...] mountain-tops till you could hardly say which was which. It was a [...] mackerel sky of a very bold and extraordinary kind--not a dish of [...] mackerel, but a world of mackerel! The mountains are certainly most [...] lovely. In this clear air they usually seem close at hand. It was [...] only this morning, with the faint glimpse of the dawn whilst the [...] night clouds were still unpierced by the sunlight, that I seemed to [...] realize their greatness. I have seen the same enlightening effect of [...] aerial perspective a few times before--in Colorado, in Upper India, [...] in Thibet, and in the uplands amongst the Andes.|$|R
60|$|But soon {{resuming}} his horizontal attitude, Moby Dick swam swiftly {{round and}} round the wrecked crew; sideways churning the water in his vengeful <b>wake,</b> <b>as</b> <b>if</b> lashing himself up to still another and more deadly assault. The sight of the splintered boat seemed to madden him, as the blood of grapes and mulberries cast before Antiochus's elephants {{in the book of}} Maccabees. Meanwhile Ahab half smothered in the foam of the whale's insolent tail, and too much of a cripple to swim,--though he could still keep afloat, even in the heart of such a whirlpool as that; helpless Ahab's head was seen, like a tossed bubble which the least chance shock might burst. From the boat's fragmentary stern, Fedallah incuriously and mildly eyed him; the clinging crew, at the other drifting end, could not succor him; more than enough was it for them to look to themselves. For so revolvingly appalling was the White Whale's aspect, and so planetarily swift the ever-contracting circles he made, that he seemed horizontally swooping upon them. And though the other boats, unharmed, still hovered hard by; still they dared not pull into the eddy to strike, lest that should be the signal for the instant destruction of the jeopardized castaways, Ahab and all; nor in that case could they themselves hope to escape. With straining eyes, then, they remained on {{the outer edge of the}} direful zone, whose centre had now become the old man's head.|$|R
50|$|Devi Bhagavata Purana {{discusses}} the legend. Once, the Asuras fought {{a war against}} the Devas or demi-gods, and their guru Shukra decided to seek the favour of the god Shiva to defeat the Devas. He started penance on Mount Kailash, Shiva's abode, leaving the Asuras unprotected. The Devas came to know of Shukra's intentions and waged a war on the Asuras again. The Asuras rushed {{to the protection of}} Kavyamata (Usana), the mother of Shukra, while being chased by Vishnu and the Devas. With one glance Kavyamata (Usana) put all the Devas into a deep sleep. By her meditative power Kavyamata (Usana) petrified Indra, the king of the Devas, putting them in a state of paralysis.Lord Vishnu assessed the situation and surmised that He would have to strike down this woman to protect the world from eons of chaos that would be ushered with the victory of the asuras. Vishnu summoned his discus weapon - the Sudarshana chakra, and severed Kavyamata's (Usana) head. Shukra's father, the great sage Bhrigu, became angry and cursed Vishnu for his sin of woman-slaughter, saying that Vishnu would have to take countless avatars on earth and suffer pain and confinement due to his sin.Lord Vishnu,who himself overseers that boons and curses come to pass,accepted this curse of the grieving sage. Then Bhrigu resurrected Kavyamata (Usana) by sprinkling holy water from his kamandalu (water-pot). Kavyamata (Usana) <b>woke</b> <b>as</b> <b>if</b> from a deep sleep. Another variant attributes the curse to the resurrected Kavyamata (Usana), instead of to Bhrigu. The rest of the story remains the same in all versions.|$|R
60|$|Among our must-be's, {{we would}} lay by a generous sum for plumbing. Let us have our bath-rooms, and our {{arrangements}} for cleanliness and health in kitchen and pantry; and afterwards let {{the quality of}} our lumber and the style of our finishing be according to the sum we have left. The power to command a warm bath in a house at any hour of day or night is better in bringing up a family of children than any amount of ready medicine. In three quarters of childish ailments the warm bath is an almost immediate remedy. Bad colds, incipient fevers, rheumatisms, convulsions, neuralgias innumerable, are washed off in their first beginnings, and run down the lead pipes into oblivion. Have, then, O friend, all the water in your house that you can afford, and enlarge your ideas of the worth of it, that you may afford a great deal. A bathing-room is nothing to you that requires an hour of lifting and fire-making to prepare it for use. The apparatus is too cumbrous,--you do not turn to it. But when your chamber opens upon a neat, quiet little nook, and you have only to turn your stop-cocks and all is ready, your remedy is at hand, you use it constantly. You are waked in the night by a scream, and find little Tom sitting up, wild with burning fever. In three minutes he is in the bath, quieted and comfortable; you get him back, cooled and tranquil, to his little crib, and in the morning he <b>wakes</b> <b>as</b> <b>if</b> nothing had happened.|$|R
6000|$|At length I slept, and {{my dreams}} were evil. When <b>I</b> <b>woke</b> {{the light of}} the day which should see the red {{fulfilment}} of the plot was streaming through the casement, and the birds sang merrily among the garden palms. <b>I</b> <b>woke,</b> and <b>as</b> <b>I</b> <b>woke</b> the sense of trouble pressed in upon me, for I remembered that before this day was gathered to the past I must dip my hands in blood--yes, in the blood of Cleopatra, who trusted me! Why could I not hate her as I should? There had been a time when I looked on to this act of vengeance with somewhat of a righteous glow of zeal. And now--and now--why, I would frankly give my royal birthright to be free from its necessity! But, alas! I knew that there was no escape. I must drain this cup or be for ever cast away. I felt the eyes of Egypt watching me, and the eyes of Egypt's Gods. I prayed to my Mother Isis to give me strength to do this deed, and prayed as I had never prayed before; and oh, wonder! no answer came. Nay, how was this? What, then, had loosed the link between us that, for the first time, the Goddess deigned no reply to her son and chosen servant? Could it be that I had sinned in heart against her? What had Charmion said--that I loved Cleopatra? Was this sickness love? Nay! a thousand times nay!--it was but the revolt of Nature against an act of treachery and blood. The Goddess did but try my strength, or perchance she also turned her holy countenance from murder? ...|$|R
6000|$|From a {{chaos of}} wild dreams was finally evolved a {{gigantic}} clam, whose mission {{it was to}} devour me as I had devoured its relatives. The sharp shells gaped before me, a solemn voice said, [...] "Take her by her little head and eat her quick." [...] Retribution was at hand, and, with a despairing effort to escape by diving, I bumped my head smartly against the wall, and <b>woke</b> up feeling <b>as</b> <b>if</b> there was an earthquake under the bed.|$|R
60|$|Never a {{word they}} spoke as they pulled ashore, being stunned with {{the horror of}} that screaming; but they had scarce set foot upon the beach when Hoseason <b>woke</b> up, <b>as</b> <b>if</b> out of a muse, and bade them lay hands upon Alan. They hung back indeed, having little taste for the employment; but Hoseason was like a fiend, crying that Alan was alone, {{that he had a}} great sum about him, that he had been the means of losing the brig and {{drowning}} all their comrades, and that here was both revenge and wealth upon a single cast. It was seven against one; {{in that part of the}} shore there was no rock that Alan could set his back to; and the sailors began to spread out and come behind him.|$|R
6000|$|The {{land and}} light were now close aboard us, and I {{expected}} every moment {{to hear the}} brig's keel grinding on the bottom. At this instant I caught a faint glimpse of a vessel at anchor to the eastward of the point, and apparently distant {{about a quarter of}} a mile. The thought struck me that she might be an English cruiser, for they frequently anchored in such places; and I called out, as it might be instinctively, [...] "luff!" [...] Neb was at the helm, and I knew by his cheerful answer that the fellow was delighted. It was lucky we luffed as we did, for, in coming to the wind, the vessel gave a scrape that was a fearful admonisher of what would have happened in another minute. The Amanda minded her helm beautifully, however, and we went past the nearest land without any further hints, heading up just high enough to fetch a little to windward of the vessel at anchor. At the next moment, the lugger, then about a cable's length from as, was shut in by the land. I was now in great hopes the Frenchman would be obliged to tack; but he had measured his distance well, and felt certain, it would seem, that he could lay past. He reasoned, probably, as Nelson is said to have reasoned at the Nile, and as some of his captains unquestionably did reason; that is, if there was water enough for us, there was water enough for him. In another minute I saw him, jammed nearly into the wind's eye, luffing past the point, and falling as easily into our <b>wake</b> <b>as</b> <b>if</b> drawn by attraction.|$|R
