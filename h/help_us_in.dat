500|$|Most of {{the changes}} in the cast have been due to {{character}} deaths. Series creator, Paul Scheuring, explains that killing off major characters [...] "makes the audience that much more fearful for our protagonists" [...] and that [...] "it actually does <b>help</b> <b>us</b> <b>in</b> terms of reducing story lines". The two protagonists of the series, Michael Scofield and Lincoln Burrows, are the only characters to have appeared in every episode of the series.|$|E
500|$|Garcia {{signed with}} the Chicago White Sox for the 1960 season, reuniting with manager Al López and former Indians owner and team {{president}} Bill Veeck. Veeck said, [...] "Our reports on Mike were real good. He might <b>help</b> <b>us</b> <b>in</b> 1960." [...] He appeared in 15 games and pitched 17.2 innings with 4.58ERA and 0–0 record. In July 1961, the expansion Washington Senators signed the 37-year-old Garcia to a contract. The Senators placed him on waivers {{before the end of}} the season. He finished with a 0–1 record, pitched 19 innings in 16 games and earned a 4.74ERA. Garcia finished his major league career with a 142–97 record, 1,117 strikeouts, a 3.27 ERA, 27 shutouts and 23 saves in 428 games (281 starts) and 2,174.6 innings.|$|E
500|$|By early July, {{refugee camps}} were filled to capacity. The prime {{minister}} made a long-awaited announcement {{saying that it}} was safe to return to the Swat Valley. The Pakistani military had pushed the Taliban out of the cities and into the countryside. Yousafzai's family reunited, and on 24 July 2009 they headed home. They made one stop first – to meet with a group of other grassroots activists that had been invited to see United States President Barack Obama's special representative to Afghanistan and Pakistan, Richard Holbrooke. Yousafzai pleaded with Holbrooke to intervene in the situation, saying, [...] "Respected ambassador, if you can <b>help</b> <b>us</b> <b>in</b> our education, so please help us." [...] When her family finally did return home, they found it had not been damaged, and her school had sustained only light damage.|$|E

500|$|Liverpool's last match {{before the}} final was against Brighton & Hove Albion in the FA Cup, which they won 6–1. Despite the margin of victory, Liverpool manager Kenny Dalglish was adamant that the result meant nothing {{in regards to the}} final: [...] "Defeating Brighton has got us to the next round, but it doesn't really <b>help</b> <b>us</b> <b>in</b> the Carling Cup, we've got a cup final but we won't get carried away." [...] Despite missing the match against Brighton, Dalglish was {{confident}} that Daniel Agger and Craig Bellamy would be fit for the final. Going into the match Liverpool had not won a trophy since they beat West Ham United in the 2006 FA Cup Final. Dalglish stated that victory: [...] "means a lot to me, more importantly {{it means a lot to}} a lot of people who have had to endure a few years when we've not been [...]" ...|$|E
500|$|We {{disliked the}} English {{language}} in the past. I disliked it because I was forced to learn Shakespeare and Milton, for which I had no taste at all. If {{we are going to}} be compelled to learn Hindi, I would perhaps not be able to learn it because of my age, and perhaps I would not be willing to do it because of the amount of constraint you put on me. This kind of intolerance makes us fear that the strong Centre which we need, a strong Centre which is necessary will also mean the enslavement of people who do not speak the language at the centre. I would, Sir, convey a warning on behalf of people of the South for the reason that there are already elements in South India who want separation..., and my honourable friends in U.P. do not <b>help</b> <b>us</b> <b>in</b> any way by flogging their idea of [...] "Hindi Imperialism" [...] to the maximum extent possible.

2500|$|During the first-round {{playoff series}} against the New York Knicks, Arroyo {{remained}} inactive as Rivers decided to have Troy Murphy active instead, because of his size.

2500|$|Some local {{historians have}} {{attempted}} to find proof of Sayram's prehistory in the holy book of the Zoroastrian faith. They state that the first recorded mention of Sayram is in the Avesta, the holy book of Zoroastrianism. There are several names mentioned, though it is possible they refer to people, places, cities, or geographic features. Historian Richard Frye states that [...] "even guesses about their identity do not <b>help</b> <b>us</b> <b>in</b> reconstructing history." [...] The word appearing in the Avesta is Sairima, which some historians equate with the name Sayram. There is mention of a river, and a land or people called Sairima elis, or people or land of/near Sayram. Sayram {{would have been a}} northern border town in the northeastern reaches of the Achaemenid Empire, later conquered by Alexander. [...] There is no mention of Sayram in the histories surrounding the acts of Alexander.|$|E
2500|$|From 10 until 24 November 1947, Rajagopalachari {{served as}} Acting Governor-General of India {{in the absence}} of the Governor-General Lord Mountbatten, who was on leave in England to attend the {{marriage}} of Princess Elizabeth to Mountbatten's nephew Prince Philip. Rajagopalachari led a very simple life in the viceregal palace, washing his own clothes and polishing his own shoes. Impressed with his abilities, Mountbatten made Rajagopalachari his second choice to succeed him after Vallabhbhai Patel, when he was to leave India in June 1948. Rajagopalachari was eventually chosen as the governor-general when Nehru disagreed with Mountbatten's first choice, as did Patel himself. He was initially hesitant but accepted when Nehru wrote to him, [...] "I hope you will not disappoint us. We want you to <b>help</b> <b>us</b> <b>in</b> many ways. The burden on some of us is more than we can carry." [...] Rajagopalachari then served as Governor-General of India from June 1948 until 26 January 1950, and was not only the last Governor-General of India, but the only Indian national ever to hold the office.|$|E
