500|$|In a hotel lobby, the {{concierge}} answers {{a phone call}} from a guest's room. A man (Jason Schwartzman) lies on a hotel bed in a yellow bathrobe, watching the black-and-white American war film Stalag 17 and reading the newspaper. After ordering room service from {{the concierge}} in broken French, he receives a call from a woman whose voice he recognizes. She tells him she is on her way from the airport and asks for his room number. Despite objecting that he did not tell her she could come, the man consents nevertheless. He then hurriedly attempts to tidy the room– pausing to play the opening bars of the song [...] "Where <b>Do</b> <b>You</b> <b>Go</b> <b>To</b> (My Lovely)?" [...] by Peter Sarstedt on his stereo system– and runs a bath.|$|E
500|$|Stepping {{back into}} the bedroom, the woman turns to face the man and confronts him, asking slowly [...] "what the fuck is going on?" [...] He motions to her to join him {{on the bed and}} at her prompting, he reveals in the ensuing {{conversation}} that he has been living in the hotel room for [...] "more than a month", and that he had left to escape their relationship. They lie back on the bed looking at one another before being interrupted by the arrival of room service. Once alone again, the two kiss and the man begins to undress the woman. They have an uncomfortable exchange about not having slept with other people and when he notices bruises on her arm after undressing her further, the woman chooses not to comment on them. Lying on top of him, she tells the man that she does not want to lose his friendship, that she loves him and never meant to hurt him. He responds coldly that he [...] "will never be [...] friend", but holds her when she embraces him. [...] "Where <b>Do</b> <b>You</b> <b>Go</b> <b>To</b> (My Lovely)?" [...] starts again and the man offers to show the woman his view of Paris.|$|E
2500|$|In 2012, when Secretary of Defense Leon Panetta {{outlined}} {{a plan to}} withdraw U.S. combat troops by 2013 if possible, Romney criticized the announcement, saying, [...] "Why in the world <b>do</b> <b>you</b> <b>go</b> <b>to</b> the people that you’re fighting with and tell them the date you’re pulling out your troops?" [...] Romney's 2012 presidential election campaign website similarly criticized the Obama Administration for announcing a timetable for withdrawal of U.S. troops from Afghanistan, and reiterated his position that in a Romney presidency, decisions about when to withdraw troops would be made based {{on the advice of}} commanders in the field, not electoral politics.|$|E
