25|$|Pollen {{analysis}} has allowed archaeologists to analyze vegetation selectively cultivated by area residents, the “native vegetation” {{of a particular}} area, and allow archaeologists to map out land use over time (which can be ascertained from weeds). But collecting a suitable sample <b>is</b> <b>not</b> <b>all</b> <b>that</b> easy. Failure to collect a suitable sample can be {{due in part to}} not sampling from areas where suitable pollen samples can be gathered (e.g. lakes and bogs, sites that were sufficiently exposed to air-borne pollen, sites that had both a long exposure to air and are deeply buried into the ground), or because pollen is vulnerable to destruction by the oxidation process or soil microbes such as bacteria and fungi, it negatively impacts an archaeologist’s ability to collect a suitable pollen sample.|$|E

[...] It {{is followed by}} [...] "Ain't Never Gonna Win", a live studio jam by the album's four musicians which was described by David E. Gehlke of the online magazine Blistering as [...] "trippy". [...] "Trainfire", a classic country–style song inspired by Elvis Presley's cover of [...] "Mystery Train", addresses Townsend's former addiction to pornography, which he described as [...] "this crazy, crack cocaine on the internet that nobody wants to talk about." [...] The song continues the album's theme of honesty and self-acceptance, both about pornography and musical tastes. Townsend explained the song's musical style, saying [...] "yes, I like heavy music and am good at making it, but that <b>is</b> <b>not</b> <b>all</b> <b>that</b> I listen to, and that <b>is</b> <b>not</b> <b>all</b> <b>that</b> I want to play." ...|$|E

Ponsford's form was {{good in the}} lead up to the Tests; he scored 60 not out for Victoria against the tourists, and added 275* against South Australia. Before the Test series started, Ponsford had declared in a column in the Herald that Harold Larwood's [...] "pace through the air <b>is</b> <b>not</b> <b>all</b> <b>that</b> fast for a fast bowler", with the qualification that [...] "he makes great pace off the pitch". Larwood dismissed him for scores of two and six in the first Test, and fractured a bone in Ponsford's hand in the second. The injury sidelined Ponsford {{for the remainder of}} the Test series.|$|E

500|$|The review {{received}} barely a sentence from Walton of The Moving Picture News who stated it was: [...] "Good from A to Z." [...] The Moving Picture World offers little more, highlighting {{that the film}} would please children and offered a brief summary devoid of criticism or praise. The New York Dramatic Mirror gave a much more substantial treatment of the subject and stated, [...] "This film, intended for juvenile patrons, has yet a charm for older spectators as well, because it tells a pretty story in a pretty way. ... The narrative is frankly impossible in plot, but that makes it no less entertaining to the youthful. A little make-believe is relished by the best of men. The acting of the wee heroine is really wonderful; it is spontaneous, lively, resourceful, graceful, and charming. The part of the rich girl, however, although it is capitally played, should have been entrusted to a smaller, if not to a younger, woman. The size of the actress makes the film look bizarre. The scenery <b>is</b> <b>not</b> <b>all</b> <b>that</b> might be desired, still it is passable."

[...] Also alluding that mass partnering with a non Jew {{with the intent of}} skirting the mitzvah is entirely not up for Mishnaic debate in terms of the clarity of liability. [...] The Prisha (Commentarian to Tur Shulchan Aruch) argues that partnering with a non-Jew with the intent to excuse the obligation of giving the gifts is [...] "ערמה" [...] ("trickery") which causes the Kohen to lose out on his rightful due.|$|E
2500|$|The show offers {{few details}} of the Sacred Scrolls. One {{important}} feature mentioned is the Book of Pythia, which chronicles an ancient prophetess (similar to the Oracle of Delphi named Pythia) who journeyed with the Thirteenth Tribe on their voyage to Earth. Pythia also described the exodus of the other Twelve Tribes, {{and the things that}} happened to them. She describes a dying leader who would guide the tribes to salvation. President Roslin sees herself as playing the part of the leader in the texts, as she has terminal breast cancer. Another important quotation from the scrolls is the recurring phrase [...] "this <b>is</b> <b>not</b> <b>all</b> <b>that</b> we are," [...] a phrase considered the foundational statement of faith.|$|E

2500|$|Tonalá {{has long}} been {{recognized}} as a center for ceramics in Mexico. The streets are filled with artisan workshops and sidewalks stalls selling pottery and stoneware pieces. One thing that distinguishes Tonalá made ware is the decorative details. Two elements, the nahual and the [...] "flor de Tonalá" [...] are common. A nahual is a pre-Hispanic shape shifter or shaman, often drawn as a smiling cat. The flor de Tonalá (Tonalá flower) first appeared in pottery design in the early 20th century. Its distinctive shape is an oval center with rounded petals that form a scalloped design. [...] These elements can appear {{in all of the}} types of pottery that is produced here. Market days, Thursday and Sunday, are a good chance to see a wide variety of ceramics of the region, all spread out {{on the streets of the}} downtown. While there are a wide variety of figures, utensils and decorative items, it <b>is</b> <b>not</b> <b>all</b> <b>that</b> is produced. Many Many manufacturers sell their wares through other channels.

The trio moves to Harlem, [...] "home to every black man". When they arrive, Rabbit, Bear, and Fox find that it <b>is</b> <b>not</b> <b>all</b> <b>that</b> it is made out to be. They encounter a con man named Simple Savior, a phony revolutionary leader who claims to be the cousin of [...] "Black Jesus", and that he gives his followers [...] "the strength to kill whites". In a flashy stage performance in his [...] "church", Savior acts out being brutalized by symbols of black oppression—represented by images of John Wayne, Elvis Presley, and Richard Nixon, before asking his parishioners for [...] "donations". Rabbit and his friends quickly realize Savior's [...] "revolution" [...] is merely a money making scam. Rabbit openly steals {{a large portion of the}} donation money, prompting Savior to try to have him killed. After Rabbit tricks his would-be murderers (in a paraphrasing of the story of Br'er Rabbit and the briar patch), he and Bear kill Savior. This allows Rabbit to take over Savior's racket, putting him in line to become the head of all organized crime in Harlem. Rabbit lays out his plan to keep all organized crime money in Harlem. But first, he has to get rid of a few other opponents. Savior's former partners tell Rabbit they will join him but only if he can kill his opponents, otherwise they will kill him instead.|$|E

In an interview with MTV T.I. said that he was actually still recording songs for King and said he'll be making music right up to the deadline.
