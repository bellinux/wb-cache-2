500|$|Indeed, at times, his sarcasm was {{directed}} even at his superiors, with Nansouty clashing {{with the more}} senior Grouchy at the Battle of Friedland. Nevertheless, Grouchy later recognised that the actions of Nansouty's division throughout the battle were [...] "glorious". In 1809, Nansouty famously responded to Napoleon's criticism after the Battle of Wagram by saying: [...] "It <b>is</b> <b>not</b> <b>Your</b> Majesty at any rate who can {{teach me how to}} handle cavalry." [...] Three years later, during the campaign in Russia, when Murat, King of Naples complained to him about the lack of resistance of the horses, Nansouty retorted: [...] "Oh yes, Sire, this is because they lack patriotism." [...] At the Battle of Craonne, in 1814, one day before resigning, he was recorded to have refused to execute Napoleon's order to assault a redoubt, a move which he saw as a death sentence to his men. Instead, Nansouty told the Emperor: [...] "I am going alone. There is nothing but death there and I will not lead these brave soldiers to it." ...|$|E

500|$|General MacDonald {{was very}} {{critical}} of both Walther and Nansouty, for their alleged failure to provide proper cavalry support during his attack. MacDonald went on to write in his memoirs that he was [...] "taken aback by the slowness of General Nansouty [...] Nansouty did charge in the end, but too late {{to take advantage of}} the gaping hole that I had pierced in the centre of the Austrian army." [...] A few days after the Battle of Wagram, Napoleon confronted Nansouty over what he saw as being a failure to cooperate with MacDonald. Nansouty responded to the Emperor's lively reproaches by offering categorical explanations, saying that he had not been consulted in the placement of his division, rendering manoeuvres impossible during that action. As Napoleon insisted, Nansouty stood up to him, finally retorting: [...] "After all, it <b>is</b> <b>not</b> <b>Your</b> Majesty at any rate who can teach me to lead cavalry..." [...] Despite this remark, Nansouty would continue to be given significant commands in the coming years. It was shortly after this bloody battle that Nansouty insisted that the Carabiniers-à-Cheval be given the steel cuirass, in a bid to cancel out what he saw as being a state of inferiority of these troops vis-à-vis their fellow cuirassiers. Nansouty's initiative was approved and was enforced in 1810.|$|E

Kamala <b>is</b> <b>not</b> <b>your</b> average superheroine and her stories seem like they're headed in an exciting direction. Kudos to Marvel for expanding its range; amping up the diversity factor {{in a way that}} doesn't feel token or temporary is a great move, and Ms. Marvel is launching with a solid first issue and a world—a universe, even—of story possibilities." [...] Joshua Yehl of IGN said, [...] "Ms. Marvel introduces a vibrant and troubled character that you can't help but love." [...] George Marston of Newsarama said, [...] "Ms. Marvel is a solid debut issue, and that in itself should be a victory not just for G. Willow Wilson and Adrian Alphona, but for Marvel Comics itself... It's not exactly edgy, and Kamala Khan is not exactly the first reluctant teen hero in Marvel's long history, but Ms. Marvel is one of the strongest debuts for a new character that Marvel has had in a long time." ...|$|E
500|$|The song {{received}} {{mixed reviews}} by commentators; some reviewers praised it for its composition, while other critics {{felt that the}} lyrics were not profound. Billboard Chuck Taylor called the song [...] "instantly memorable" [...] and praised its instrumentation for being different [...] "from the scores of adolescent thrust-rockers currently dominating the scene." [...] Dubbing it [...] "elegant, timeless pop/rock", Taylor qualified it as [...] "one of the great discoveries of the year", while Pete Waterman, writing for The Guardian in 2007, stated it was [...] "one of [...] favourite songs of recent years". Eric R. Danton from the Hartford Courant [...] classified it as the best track on the album, while Erlewine called it [...] "the template {{for the rest of}} his debut". In contrast, Wilson Kung said the song [...] "pales in comparison to some of the truly strong songs" [...] on the album Daniel Powter. Alan Connor of BBC News Magazine said it is a typical sentimental song but that in [...] "Bad Day"'s case [...] "there's even less detail". He said the song [...] "is so low on the specifics, there are some couplets that feel like they've been translated from a foreign language, possibly by a computer". A writer for The Daily Edge called it [...] "a song so sweet it gave you a toothache", while a reviewer from The Scotsman called it a [...] "horrible song". Bill Lamb said it [...] "feels genuine" [...] but [...] "if you are looking for depth, this <b>is</b> <b>not</b> <b>your</b> song", Chris Lee of the Los Angeles Times said the song is [...] "baleful but soulful", and People commented: [...] "'Bad Day' may be catchy enough to overcome its trite lyrics".|$|E

2500|$|A public {{relations}} {{campaign in the}} late 1980s proclaimed that this was [...] "not your father's Oldsmobile." [...] Ironically, many fans of the brand say that the declining sales were in fact caused by the [...] "this <b>is</b> <b>not</b> <b>your</b> father's Oldsmobile" [...] campaign", as the largest market for Oldsmobiles was the population whose parents had, in fact, owned Oldsmobiles and that by going away from the traditional vehicles that Oldsmobile's brand was built upon, lost many loyal buyers and put the brand {{on a collision course}} with Pontiac and Buick which led to internal cannibalization and a downfall from which it could never recover.

2500|$|An {{ongoing debate}} {{related to the}} [...] "new" [...] {{perspective}} has been over Paul's use of the Greek word pistis (πίστις, meaning [...] "trust", [...] "belief", [...] "faith", or [...] "faithfulness"). Writers with a more historic Lutheran and Reformed perspective have typically interpreted this word as meaning a belief in God and Christ, and trust in Christ for salvation with faith that he will save you. This interpretation is based on several passages from the Christian Bible, notably Ephesians 2:8–9, which reads, [...] "For by grace you have been saved through faith. And this <b>is</b> <b>not</b> <b>your</b> own doing; it is the gift of God, not {{as a result of}} works, so that no one may boast." [...] Interestingly, E. P. Sanders, notes that Ephesians 2:9 teaches the traditional perspectives.|$|E

The {{previous}} year, in 2010, Martin had responded to fan criticisms by saying he was unwilling to write only his Ice and Fire series, noting that working on other prose and compiling and editing different book projects have {{always been part of}} his working process. Writer Neil Gaiman famously wrote on his blog in 2009 to a critic of Martin's pace, [...] "George R. R. Martin <b>is</b> <b>not</b> <b>your</b> bitch."
