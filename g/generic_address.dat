40|$|This paper {{describes}} {{our experiences}} with the hardware description language Verilog during {{the development of the}} Xputer prototype. At first it introduces the novel non-von Neumann architecture of the Xputer, its need for efficient address generation and the basic structure of the <b>Generic</b> <b>Address</b> Generator. After a short introduction to Verilog, we discuss the problems with this hardware description language and show how to get around using some design restrictions. At the end a outlook on testing and simulation possibilities is given. Many applications require the same data manipulations to be performed on a large amount of data. These so called generic algorithms (e. g. systolic algorithms) are normally described as nested loops. A conventional von Neumann computer is not able to optimize such loops. Repetitive address patterns and data manipulations are interpreted on a per instruction basis. Thu...|$|E
40|$|The {{hardware}} for {{the image}} preprocessing {{might be a}} reconfigurable hardware like the rDPA [2], or the reconfigurable data-driven multiprocessor architecture proposed in [7]. Both would be superior over special purpose hardware with regard to flexibility {{in the choice of}} algorithms to be run. The required data rates of 3. 2 MBytes per second to process the contents of the complete sensor array of 128 by 256 pixels 100 times a second can easily be handled by both kinds of devices. This allows to process even larger sensor arrays built from multiple devices, or higher frame processing rates than 100 per second. Using two independent <b>Generic</b> <b>Address</b> Generator allows to perform the image analysis in a pipelined fashion, where the image acquisition, the image preprocessing, and the image analysis are done in parallel in different stages of the pipeline. This does not even increase the latency from the image acquisition to the collision detection, because all these steps would have to be done sequentially as well in a non-pipelined fashion, only at lower overall data rates or higher bandwidth requirements. The versatility of the scan patterns in combination with the two-level hierarchy of address generation allows to run a wide variety of image preprocessing algorithms in an endless loop without requiring any download of parameters after the initial power-up configuration. ...|$|E

40|$|This paper {{presents}} a <b>generic</b> <b>addressing</b> framework (GAF) which enables {{the development of}} protocol stack independent applications. This framework has been developed {{in the context of}} dynamic protocol stack composition [8]. Having a way to compose [8][7] and build [3] protocol stacks is not sufficient. The protocol layers a stack is composed of {{have an impact on the}} addressing used inside the stack. Since addresses are used by applications, the impact of modifying the stack dynamically is not automatically transparent. The addressing framework we present in this paper provides a generalised view on network communication to solve this addressing problem. We validated the GAF in a proof-of-concept prototype. ...|$|R

40|$|Abstract—We {{propose a}} {{scalable}} data alignment scheme incorporating module assignment functions and a <b>generic</b> <b>addressing</b> function for parallel access of randomly aligned rectangular blocks of data. The addressing function implicitly embeds the module assignment functions {{and it is}} separable, which potentially enables short critical paths and saves hardware resources. We also discuss the interface between the proposed memory organization and a linearly addressable memory. An implementation, suitable for MPEG- 4 is presented and mapped onto an FPGA technology as a case study. Synthesis results indicate reasonably small hardware costs {{in the order of}} up to a few thousand FPGA slices for an exemplary 512 1024 two-dimensional (2 -D) addressable space and a range of access pattern dimensions. Experiments suggest that speedups close to 8 can be expected when compared to linear addressing schemes.

40|$|Abstract—Data centers often hold tens to {{hundreds}} of thousands of servers in order to offer cloud computing services at scale. Ethernet switching and IP routing have their own advantages and limitations in building data center networks. Recent research, such as PortLand and BCube, has proposed scalable data center network designs. A common feature of these designs is that their addressing and routing are customized to specific topologies. In this paper, we propose a <b>generic</b> <b>addressing,</b> routing and forwarding protocol for data center networks, which works on arbitrarily “layered ” network topologies. We first form the network as a multi-rooted tree. Each network node (i. e., hosts and switches) is then assigned one or more locators, and each locator encodes a downward path from the roots to this node. Data center networks often have rich path diversity, so tracking all locators of a destination node will cause switches to have very large forwarding tables. We further use a new forward-ing model to reduce the forwarding states. In addition, the multiple-locator mechanism brings built-in support for multi-path routing, load balancing and fault tolerance. Evaluations based on simulations and prototype experiments demonstrate that our proposal achieves our design goals. I...|$|R
