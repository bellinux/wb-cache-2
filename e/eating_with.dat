40|$|White {{and whole}} meal breads have been {{classified}} as high glycemic index (GI) foods {{which in turn}} produce the greatest rise in blood glucose. One of the commercial bread products in Malaysia known as Brown breads (BB) has been recently marketed as a healthy choice for diabetics due to its low GI value. This {{study was conducted to}} examine the effect of BB when <b>eaten</b> <b>with</b> different fillings on blood glucose response among healthy individuals and to describe the influences of these fillings in reducing blood glucose response. Five test meals using BB (BB <b>eaten</b> <b>with</b> baked beans, BB <b>eaten</b> <b>with</b> vegetable, BB <b>eaten</b> <b>with</b> apple, BB <b>eaten</b> <b>with</b> roast chicken and BB <b>eaten</b> <b>with</b> seaweeds) had been prepared for this study. Postprandial blood glucose response was determined for each test meal and reference food (glucose) that contained 50 g carbohydrate respectively. A total of 21 healthy subjects were recruited by advertisement to participate. Only 20 subjects (15 males, 5 females, Mean + SD Age : 24. 4 + 3. 7 years; BMI 23. 4 + 3. 0 kgm- 2) completed this study. After an overnight fast, subjects consumed BB <b>eaten</b> <b>with</b> fillings according to the assigned group given and three repeated tests of reference food (glucose). Fasting capillary blood glucose samples were taken at time 0 and at 15, 30, 45, 60, 90 and 120 min respectively after the meal began. The blood glucose response was obtained by calculating the incremental area under the curve (AUC). Blood glucose response after consuming reference food (251. 8 + 12. 1 m m o l. m i n / L) w a s s i g n i f i c a n t l y h i g h e r t h a n a l l t h e t e s t m e a l s (p < 0. 05). Among the test meals, BB <b>eaten</b> <b>with</b> baked beans produced the highest rise in blood glucose (97. 0 + 16. 9 mmol. min/L) whereas BB <b>eaten</b> <b>with</b> seaweeds demonstrated the lowest response in blood glucose (33. 3 + 6. 5 mmol. min/L) and the difference was statistically significant (p < 0. 05). The postprandial blood glucose response after ingestion of BB when <b>eaten</b> <b>with</b> vegetable was 73. 3 + 19. 1 mmol. min/L followed by BB <b>eaten</b> <b>with</b> apple (58. 9 Jurnal Sains Kesihatan Malaysia 6 (1) 2008 : 1 - 102 + 12. 2 mmol. min/L) and BB <b>eaten</b> <b>with</b> roast chicken (56. 5 + 10. 1 mmol. min/ L). Generally, BB when <b>eaten</b> <b>with</b> fillings produced a slow rise in blood glucose response than the reference food. Combining this BB with fillings had the effect of reducing the postprandial blood glucose further...|$|R
25|$|Swanson {{became a}} {{vegetarian}} around 1928 {{and was an}} early health food advocate who was known for bringing her own meals to public functions in a paper bag. Swanson told actor Dirk Benedict about macrobiotic diets when he was battling prostate cancer {{at a very early}} age.

25|$|The {{following}} decades saw {{research by}} a group of scientists and doctors in the United States, including physicians Dean Ornish, Caldwell Esselstyn, Neal D. Barnard, John A. McDougall, Michael Greger and biochemist T. Colin Campbell, who argued that diets based on animal fat and animal protein, such as the Western pattern diet, were detrimental to health. They produced a series of books that recommend vegan or vegetarian diets, including McDougall's The McDougall Plan (1983), John Robbins's Diet for a New America (1987), which associated meat <b>eating</b> <b>with</b> environmental damage, and Dr. Dean Ornish's Program for Reversing Heart Disease (1990). In 2003 two major North American dietitians' associations indicated that well-planned vegan diets were suitable for all life stages. This was followed by the film Earthlings (2005), Campbell's The China Study (2005), Rory Freedman and Kim Barnouin's Skinny Bitch (2005), Jonathan Safran Foer's Eating Animals (2009), and the film Forks over Knives (2011).|$|E
25|$|The golden {{trevally}} is commonly targeted by both anglers and spearfishermen, {{and is considered}} to be a gamefish. Golden trevally will take a variety of baits and lures and may be caught from both the shore and boats, making it a highly accessible species. Baits commonly employed for {{golden trevally}} include prawns and a variety of small fish or cut baits. The fish are known to follow a burley stream right up to the back of a boat, allowing for easy capture on unweighted baits. A variety of lures may be employed when targeting the species, including jigs, poppers, spoons, slices, and minnows, with large minnows trolled around reefs often accounting for larger specimens. The use of saltwater fly fishing to specifically target golden trevally has developed in recent years, especially over shallow, sandy flats. In these cases, a sinking line and leader is employed to not spook the fish in these shallow waters. Once hooked, golden trevally are known for fast runs and hard fights, especially when reef or other structures are present. Golden trevally are considered one of the best members of the trevally family for <b>eating,</b> <b>with</b> bleeding recommended. The fish has slightly translucent, dark-pink flesh while fresh, becoming white and juicy during cooking, although has a tendency to become dry, flaky, and fibrous. A rich, tangy fish flavour is noted.|$|E
