5|$|In 2010, Cinema Retro {{magazine}} {{hosted a}} screening of the film at Ettington Park. Richard Johnson was a special guest at the event and participated in a Q prior to the screening. Johnson {{said that he had}} never actually stepped foot in the hall during filming, and that this was the first occasion he <b>had</b> <b>actually</b> <b>been</b> inside the premises. The movie was mentioned in Dan Simmons' 2002 novel A Winter Haunting.|$|E
5|$|After {{his victory}} in the battle, Richard III is unintentionally killed by Lord Edmund Plantagenet; Richard {{attempts}} to take Edmund's horse, which he thinks is his own. Not recognizing the king, Edmund thinks Richard is stealing it and cuts his head off. The late King's nephew, Richard, Duke of York (played by Brian Blessed) who is Lord Edmund Plantagenet's father, is then crowned as Richard IV. Lord Edmund himself did not {{take part in the}} battle after arriving late, but later claims to have killed 450 peasants and several nobles, one of whom <b>had</b> <b>actually</b> <b>been</b> killed by his brother in the battle.|$|E

5|$|After recovering, {{he joined}} the Kimberley Mounted Corps and guided two {{officers}} from Lichtenburg to Klerksdorp, where they persuaded the Boers to surrender by bluffing that a strong British force was following close behind. The Boers soon retook the town and Guest was captured. He was sent with other prisoners to Pietersburg to be executed {{but he managed to}} escape and travelled to Warmbaths. After satisfying the authorities that he <b>had</b> <b>actually</b> <b>been</b> taken prisoner and had not surrendered voluntarily, he returned to his depot at Kimberley. His unit had been disbanded and he was discharged.|$|E
5|$|For L.A. Noire, the {{development}} team recreated 1940s Los Angeles by using aerial photographs taken by daredevil Robert Spence. In a career spanning over 50 years, Spence took over 110,000 aerial photographs of Los Angeles. The team used the photographs to create traffic patterns and public transport routes, {{as well as}} the location and condition of buildings. While striving to recreate an accurate model of 1947 Los Angeles, the team also took some artistic license, such as including the appearance of the film set for D. W. Griffith's Intolerance; the set <b>had</b> <b>actually</b> <b>been</b> dismantled in 1919.|$|E
5|$|The {{origins of}} the band trace to 1970, when bassist Gene Klein and keyboardist Brooke Ostrander {{recruited}} lead guitarist Stephen Coronel, a childhood friend and former bandmate of Klein. The group took the name Rainbow shortly thereafter. Coronel recommended rhythm guitarist Stanley Eisen, who <b>had</b> <b>actually</b> <b>been</b> rejected by the group after a previous audition. Shortly after Eisen joined, Ostrander recruited drummer Joe Davidson, and the first Rainbow lineup was completed. Davidson's stay {{did not last long}} and he was replaced by drummer Tony Zarrella.|$|E

5|$|When {{translated}} into English for a publication by Methuen in 1963, {{a number of}} Francophone place-names were changed; for instance, the port of Saint-Nazaire was renamed Westermouth, which, according to author Michael Farr, was probably inspired by the real English coastal town of Weymouth. As the English-language translation was published after the English translation of other Tintin adventures, which <b>had</b> <b>actually</b> <b>been</b> authored later than The Seven Crystal Balls, in the English version, references are made to events that would occur in The Calculus Affair and The Red Sea Sharks.|$|E
5|$|After {{publishing}} the book, Hergé {{learned that there}} <b>had</b> <b>actually</b> <b>been</b> an Admiral Haddock who {{had served in the}} British Royal Navy during the late 17th and early 18th centuries: Sir Richard Haddock (1629–1715). Richard Haddock {{was in charge of the}} Royal James, the flagship of the Earl of Sandwich during the Battle of Solebay of 1672, the first naval battle of the Third Anglo-Dutch War. During the fighting, the Royal James was set alight and Haddock escaped but had to be rescued from the sea, following which his bravery was recognised by the British monarch, King Charles II. He subsequently took command of another ship, the Royal Charles, before becoming a naval administrator in later life. Admiral Haddock's grandfather, also named Richard, commanded the ship of the line HMS Unicorn during the reign of King Charles I.|$|E

Johnson and the Showtime Lakers reached the 1980 NBA Finals against the 76ers, which was also led by NBA superstar Julius Erving. The Lakers took a 3–2 lead, but Kareem Abdul-Jabbar could not play in Game 6 due to injury. Johnson, a natural point guard, was shifted to center, and ended up playing every position on the court during the game, scoring 42 points, while also attaining 15 rebounds and 7 assists to win his first championship while being awarded his first NBA Finals MVP; a remarkable performance {{in the annals of}} the sport.|$|E

5|$|In United States v. Amedy (1826), the Court {{held that}} the federal {{criminal}} insurance fraud statute was no subjected to the same formalities as civil insurance fraud claims. First, the Court {{held that the}} state statute of incorporation of the insurance company required {{no more than the}} state's seal to be authenticated. Second, {{there was no need to}} prove the existence of the insurance company (i.e., that its stock <b>had</b> <b>actually</b> <b>been</b> subscribed) because it was not a party. Nor was it necessary to prove that the policy would have been binding against the insurance company. Nor did it matter whether the policy would have paid out under the circumstances of the fraud. Finally, it was held that an insurance corporation was a person within the meaning of the statute.|$|E
5|$|In the 2015 {{video game}} , {{which is the}} sequel to Batman: Arkham City, while under the {{influence}} of Scarecrow's latest toxin, Batman hallucinates the Joker's shooting of Barbara Gordon after she is kidnapped by the mysterious Arkham Knight, a hallucination of Joker noting that he merely got lucky when he shot Barbara as he was ignorant of her true ties to Batman, and also claimed that he <b>had</b> <b>actually</b> <b>been</b> aiming for Barbara's head. In addition, the DLC side story Batgirl: A Matter of Family had various similarities to the story of The Killing Joke, including Joker kidnapping and holding Police Commissioner Gordon hostage at a run-down amusement park as well as the backstory revealing that Joker had conned and murdered the original person who owned the park into granting him control.|$|E
5|$|In {{the autumn}} of 1536 {{there was a great}} muster, {{reckoned}} at up to 40,000 in number, at Horncastle in Lincolnshire. The nervous gentry managed, with difficulty, to disperse these masses—who had tried unsuccessfully to negotiate with the king by petition. The Pilgrimage of Grace was a more serious matter. Revolt spread through Yorkshire, and the rebels gathered at York. Robert Aske, their leader, negotiated the restoration of sixteen of the twenty-six northern monasteries, which <b>had</b> <b>actually</b> <b>been</b> dissolved. However, the promises made to them by the Duke of Suffolk were ignored on the king's orders. Suffolk was instructed to put the rebellion down. Forty-seven of the Lincolnshire rebels were executed, and 132 from the northern pilgrimage. Further rebellions took place in Cornwall in early 1537, and in Walsingham (in Norfolk). These received similar treatment.|$|E

5|$|Prior to {{the events}} of Dark Forces, Katarn was a student {{studying}} to follow in his father's career of agricultural mechanics. However, while at an academy, he was told by officials that the Rebel Alliance had killed his parents. His anger led him to enlist in the Imperial army, where he soon met Jan Ors, an undercover double agent working for the Alliance. Ors uncovered the real information about Katarn's parents; they <b>had</b> <b>actually</b> <b>been</b> killed by the Empire. Shortly thereafter, Ors' cover was blown, and she was taken prisoner. Katarn helped her escape, thus ending his career with the Empire. He then became a mercenary, and due to his hatred for the Empire, regularly took on jobs for the Alliance.|$|E
5|$|The foreign press {{suggested}} that Albert Victor was sent on a seven-month tour of British India from October 1889 {{to avoid the}} gossip which swept London society {{in the wake of}} the scandal. This is not true; the trip <b>had</b> <b>actually</b> <b>been</b> planned since the spring. Travelling via Athens, Port Said, Cairo and Aden, Albert Victor arrived in Bombay on 9 November 1889. He was entertained sumptuously in Hyderabad by the Nizam, and elsewhere by many other maharajahs. He spent Christmas at Mandalay and the New Year at Calcutta. Most of the extensive travelling was done by train, although elephants were ridden as part of ceremonies. In the style of the time, a great many animals were shot for sport.|$|E
5|$|In April 1918, {{after the}} German-Russian Treaty of Brest-Litovsk, Austrian Foreign Minister Count Ottokar Czernin {{made a speech}} attacking {{incoming}} French Prime Minister Georges Clemenceau as being the main obstacle to a peace favouring the Central Powers. Clemenceau was incensed and, after seeing the Emperor Charles's letter of 24 March 1917, had it published. For a while, the life of Sixtus {{appeared to be in}} danger, and there were even fears that Germany might occupy Austria. Czernin persuaded Charles to send a 'Word of Honour' to Austria's allies saying that Sixtus had not been authorised to show the letter to the French Government, that Belgium had not been mentioned, and that Clemenceau had lied about the mentioning of Alsace. Czernin <b>had</b> <b>actually</b> <b>been</b> in contact with the German Embassy throughout the whole crisis and attempted to persuade the Emperor to step down because of the Affair. After failing to do so, Czernin resigned as Foreign Minister.|$|E

5|$|Szilard was {{appointed}} as assistant to von Laue at the Institute for Theoretical Physics in 1924. In 1927 {{he finished his}} habilitation and became a Privatdozent (private lecturer) in physics. For his habilitation lecture, he produced a second paper on Maxwell's Demon, Über die Entropieverminderung in einem thermodynamischen System bei Eingriffen intelligenter Wesen (On the reduction of entropy in a thermodynamic system by the intervention of intelligent beings), that <b>had</b> <b>actually</b> <b>been</b> written soon after the first. This introduced the thought experiment now called the Szilard engine and became important {{in the history of}} attempts to understand Maxwell's demon. The paper is also the first equation of negative entropy and information. As such, it established Szilard as {{one of the founders of}} information theory, but he did not publish it until 1929, and did not pursue it further. Claude E. Shannon, who took it up in the 1950s, acknowledged Szilard's paper as his starting point.|$|E
5|$|The game {{begins as}} Professor E. Gadd completes his newest {{invention}} {{of a time}} machine powered by a gem called the Cobalt Star, which is presented at Peach's Castle. Peach enters the time machine into the past, but fails to return, only leaving {{a member of an}} alien species known only as the Shroobs within the damaged time machine. The Mushroom Kingdom of the past <b>had</b> <b>actually</b> <b>been</b> invaded by the Shroobs, with Peach being kidnapped and held hostage at her castle. After defeating the monster, a time hole opens, leaving a passageway into the past. While searching for Peach, Mario and Luigi locate their younger selves, and agree to locate the crystal shards, which are remnants of the Cobalt Star which had been shattered during Peach's journey. Unwittingly, the brothers collect all of the shards, while being pestered by Baby Bowser (Bowser in the past) who wants the Cobalt Star. At the end, they restore the Cobalt Star only to unleash the Elder Princess Shroob, who serves as the game's final boss character. The story ends when she is defeated, Peach is rescued, and the past returns to normal.|$|E
5|$|The {{next day}} Hastings called {{for both the}} Solicitor General, Sir Henry Slesser, and Jimmy Maxton, to ask their opinion on the prosecution. Maxton knew Campbell, and {{revealed}} {{that he was only}} the temporary editor and had not written the article – the article <b>had</b> <b>actually</b> <b>been</b> copied from another newspaper. Along with Guy Stevenson, the Assistant Director of Public Prosecutions, Hastings then visited Ramsay MacDonald to explain the facts of the case. MacDonald blamed the Director of Public Prosecutions for starting the case, although Hastings intervened and admitted to Macdonald that it was entirely his fault. The Prime Minister said that he felt they should go through with the case now they had started, but Hastings suggested that a member of the Treasury Counsel appear at Bow Street Magistrates Court and withdraw the prosecution. MacDonald agreed, and the next morning Travers Humphreys appeared for the Crown at the Magistrates Court and had Campbell discharged.|$|E
