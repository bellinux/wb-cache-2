5000|$|<b>Gummite</b> is {{a yellow}} {{amorphous}} mixture of uranium minerals, oxides, silicates, and hydrates of uranium, {{derived from the}} alteration of uraninite. It is named for its [...] luster.|$|E
50|$|Yttrogummite is a yttrium-bearing {{variety of}} <b>gummite</b> mineral. It {{is a rare}} earth mineral {{containing}} relatively large amounts of the yttrium earths. It is an alteration product of yttrian uraninite.|$|E
50|$|A large {{variety of}} {{secondary}} uranium minerals are known, {{many of which}} are brilliantly coloured and fluorescent. The most common are <b>gummite,</b> autunite (with calcium), saleeite (magnesium) and torbernite (with copper); and hydrated uranium silicates such as coffinite, uranophane (with calcium) and sklodowskite (magnesium).|$|E
40|$|The {{subject of}} this {{investigation}} was the excimer laser’s technology on the plaque psoriasis. They have taken part 26 patients with common psoriasis plaque in percentuality less than 10 % of the body area. We have study the locality of the lesions in every patient and we have calculate the effectivity of this therapy in every one of these anatomic localizations. We have calculated the PASI score in the beginning and compared with it {{after the end of the}} therapy. (the media of PASI score in the beginning of the therapy was 6, 3, but 10 therapeutical sessions after redacted to 3, 3 and 16 therapeutic sessions after to 1, 4) We have calculate the time of the remission of lesions, that was 8, 04 months from the time of the clearance. We have study all side effects during therapy. Actually, excimer laser is a very satisfy therapy of the located common psoriasis plaque, because of the productive UVB radiation. The patients have been improved under therapy every 15 days (on the contrary with all the precedent studies) and the therapeutic protocol had the duration of totally 28 months. We have also proved that very difficult localizations of psoriasis plaque have had excellent results with this method. The XeCl 308 nm Excimer laser, seems to presents many advantages in comparison with other therapies for psoriasis, and leads to a very good result in a low relative amount of sessions and its save in what rewards the fraction of radiation although focalize only on the insulted skin. Additionally this study has prove that Excimer laser is supportable and effective in invasive Squamous plaques in the areas of the knees and the <b>gummites</b> that they are very resistible to the therapy. Excimer laser seems that in the future will be the first choice method for the treatment of psoriasis. In the comparison with PUVA our method doesn’t present cancerosis elements and because of the protection that provides on the skin lesion seems to be the safest alternative therapeutic choice in comparison with all the other therapeutic methods in what rewards the danger of side effects in damage of the systemic health of the patients. ...|$|R
50|$|At El Sherana and El Sherana West, uranium-gold {{mineralisation}} {{occurs in}} two general settings:at {{or near the}} shallow-dipping Koolpin Formation/Coronation Sandstone unconformity, where it is cut by normal and reverse faults (El Sherana pit). The host rocks are chert-banded siltstone and carbonaceous shale adjacent to sandstone (Coronation Sandstone) and altered volcanics (Pul Pul Rhyolite), in irregular zones along the contacts between cherty ferruginous shale and carbonaceous shale (El Sherana West). The ore consisted of massive pods and disseminated veinlets of pitchblende, with secondary metatorbernite, autunite, <b>gummite</b> and gold, with minor pyrite, galena and chalcopyrite. Gold occurred as veinlets within pitchblende or as separate zones of mineralisation. Gold distribution extends beyond the high grade pitchblende pods that in places contain visible gold and forms an envelope around the poddy high grade uranium mineralisation, with grades of up to 0.2 ounce per ton (5.5 g/tonne).|$|E
40|$|Mamuju {{area and}} its {{surrounding}} are composed of volcanic rock containing uranium (U) and thorium (Th) elements. Radioelements concentrations in the area reach 1, 529 ppm eU and 817 ppm eTh. Radioactive minerals identified {{in the area are}} thorianite, davidite, <b>gummite,</b> and autunite. The geological structures were formed by tectonic activities which controlled the creation of volcanic complex and U-Th mineralization in the complex. Identification of geological structure in the field is very difficult due to densely vegetation and higly degree of weathering. The interpreted lineaments from Landsat- 8 imagery are the manifestation of geological structures which have controlled the existence of U and Th. Lineaments analysis using Sastratenaya formula is used to obtain the relative age and chronologies of the lineaments. Dose rate measurements in the area show the trend of radioactivitiy anomalies are trending northwest–southeast. The Sastratenaya formula results the formed structures are relatively older and dominantly directing northwest–southeast (N 140 o– 150 o E). Based on the linement interpretation, the dominant direction has similliarity with volcanic and radioactivity distribution. Structures which controlling the volcanic formation and related to U and Th mineralization generally are the northwest–southeast trending structures, which were created along with U and Th mineralization...|$|E
40|$|The McArthur River unconformity-related uranium deposit, {{located near}} the southeastern margin of the Proterozoic Athabasca basin in {{northern}} Saskatchewan, Canada, contains both basement-hosted and sandstone-hosted orebodies, {{one of which is}} the sandstone-hosted Zone 4 orebody and its alteration system. Early pre-ore quartz cementation forming immediately above Zone 4 produced a 200 -m-thick silicified zone within the lower Manitou Falls Formation. Late pre-ore oxidizing basinal fluids (δ 18 O = 1. 1 – 8. 9 ‰, δ 2 H = – 70 to – 34 ‰) formed zones of dickite, magnesiofoitite, and sudoite-rich alteration in the Manitou Falls Formation above the deposit. These zones were overprinted by an outer halo of illite and illite-chlorite mixed-layer clay that coincided with illite and clinochlore alteration of the Wollaston Group basement rocks. Circulation of basinal fluids into the fault zone, promoted by fault reactivation, created a reducing fluid (δ 18 O = 3. 9 – 7. 8 ‰, δ 2 H = – 62 to – 25 ‰) through basement interaction, which formed a narrow sudoite alteration halo near the faulted unconformity. Mixing of these two contrasting fluids initiated uranium mineralization at ca. 1600 Ma. Post-ore alteration caused isotopic resetting of primary uraninite, broadly coincident with the intrusion of the Mackenzie dikes into the basin, followed by alteration of uraninite to coffinite, poorly crystalline uraninite, and <b>gummite</b> during the Neoproterozoic. Cool (ca. 10 °C), oxidizing, meteoric waters (δ 18 O = – 15. 7 to – 13. 2 ‰, δ 2 H = – 120 to – 93 ‰...|$|E
40|$|The ten uranium mines now in {{production}} in the Blind River area of Ontario have provided considerable new evidence {{on the origin of}} the deposits and {{have been the subject of}} a number of studies by Government, company, and research geologists. An attempt is here made to co-ordinate and assess the evidence and conclusions presented by the various workers. Commercial ore is almost exclusively restricted to quartz pebble conglomerate beds near the base of the Lower Huronian quartzites and a direct relationship exists between maximum conglomerate development and grade of uranium. The detrital material was derived from Archaean basement rocks to the northwest and was probably deposited under deltaic conditions near a northward-migrating shore line. The ore minerals are uraninite, brannerite, and minerals of the <b>gummite</b> group in variable proportions. Brannerite is the most generally accepted as detrital mineral but even here the evidence is not altogether convincing. Age determinations show that definite detrital minerals, such as zircon and monazite, have an age corresponding to that of the Archaean base-ment while the uranium minerals show an age closer to that of the deposition of the Lower Huronian sediments. Pending more convincing evidence that the brannerite is detrital, it is concluded that: (1) The uranium minerals were deposited contemporaneously, or shortly after, deposition of the conglomerate beds, but as precipitates from supergene solution rather than as detrital minerals. (2) The present uranium minerals resulted from recrystallization or reaction with other minerals after burial. (3) Hydrothermal action does not appear to have played a more significant role than aiding such recrystallization and the redistribution of uranium within the conglommerate beds...|$|E
