5|$|Thereafter, Celtic found {{themselves}} drawn with AC Milan, Ajax and again Barcelona {{in the group}} stage. The campaign was dismal, winning only once with a 21 home win over Ajax, and slumping to a 61 rout away against Barcelona in the final group match. That game saw Celtic concede the most goals they <b>had</b> <b>ever</b> <b>done</b> in a single European tie, and equalled their previous heaviest defeat in Europe, a 5–0 loss to Artmedia Bratislava.|$|E
5|$|After Michigan {{began the}} season with a 22 record under senior starter Gardner and with head coach Hoke under pressure, Morris started in the September 27 Little Brown Jug rivalry game against Minnesota. Michigan lost the game 3014, earning its third loss earlier than it <b>had</b> <b>ever</b> <b>done</b> in the 135-year history of Michigan football. The 16-point loss was the largest loss to Minnesota since 1977 and the largest to Minnesota at home since 1962. On September 30, Michigan {{athletic}} director Dave Brandon revealed that Morris suffered a concussion during the game but still played after showing signs of a concussion. This revelation sparked calls for Brandon to be fired, including a protest on the Michigan campus. When Gardner was injured in week 7 (October 11) against Penn State, Russell Bellomy and not Morris was the replacement, due to what was presumed to be lingering injuries (high-ankle sprain and/or concussion) to Morris.|$|E
5|$|In {{contrast}} to their previous season, in 2004 the Highlanders conceded 44tries, twelve {{more than in}} 2003, but scored nine more tries then in 2003. Not only did {{they have a new}} head coach, but also thirteen new players in their squad. This all contributed to them finishing the season ninth that season. The Highlanders' 2005 season started with a loss to the Blues at Carisbrook. Following this the side won six games consecutively, the first time the franchise <b>had</b> <b>ever</b> <b>done</b> so. After a draw with the Stormers and a bye, the Highlanders had gone unbeaten for eight weeks. Three weeks {{from the end of the}} round robin they were third, but after losing their remaining three matches fell to eighth for the season.|$|E

5|$|The Highlander’s 2005 season {{started with}} only their second ever {{loss to the}} Blues at Carisbrook, a 3014 loss. Following this the side won six games consecutively, {{the first time the}} {{franchise}} <b>had</b> <b>ever</b> <b>done</b> so. They first defeated the Bulls 230, then the Sharks 437. They then won away against the Cats and Reds. They returned to Carisbrook and defeated the Brumbies 1918, and the following week won in Wellington {{for the first time with}} a 2616 win over the Hurricanes. After a draw with the Stormers and a bye, the Highlanders had gone unbeaten for eight weeks. Thus three weeks from the end of the round robin they were third, but after losing their remaining three matches fell to eighth for the season.|$|E
5|$|Vice {{president}} of programming {{and production of}} Cartoon Network, Mike Lazzo, showed high interest in the series and requested a show bible, which came through by fax, a few pages at a time, {{over a period of}} the next few months. After an affirmative response from Cartoon Network president Betty Cohen, the legal paperwork and deal-making began, followed by a start-up meeting at the Chateau Marmont Hotel in Los Angeles. A deal was made that Antonucci's studio, a.k.a. Cartoon, would produce Ed, Edd n Eddy, the first Cartoon Network original series to be produced by an outside production company rather than Cartoon Network's Hanna-Barbera. The series also entered production and bypassed a seven-minute short; this marked the first time that one of the studio's original series <b>had</b> <b>ever</b> <b>done</b> this.|$|E

On 16 April a British Sea Harrier was shot down over Goražde by Serb forces. On 15 April the Bosnian government lines around Goražde broke.|$|E

25|$|On 17 June, the Adelaide Daily Mail {{raised the}} {{possibility}} that Harris was the hoaxed rather than the hoaxer. Alarmed, Harris hired a private detective to establish whether Ern and Ethel Malley existed or <b>had</b> <b>ever</b> <b>done</b> so. But by now, the Australian national press was on the trail. The next week, the Sydney Sunday Sun, which had been conducting some investigative reporting, ran a front-page story alleging that the Ern Malley poems had in fact been written by McAuley and Stewart.|$|E
25|$|With the title, Australia {{became the}} first men's {{national}} team to win titles in two different confederations, having won the OFC Nations Cup four times {{before moving to the}} AFC. Tim Cahill and Mark Bresciano {{became the first}} men's players to win two different confederation titles, having previously won the 2004 OFC Nations Cup. By winning the Asian Cup, Australia also became the first country to simultaneously hold the AFC Asian Cup and AFC Champions League titles, following the triumph of Western Sydney Wanderers in the 2014 AFC Champions League. This result had also marked for the first time, a non-Asian country hold two AFC titles for the same time, but until Australia did this, no Asian nation <b>had</b> <b>ever</b> <b>done</b> it before.|$|E
25|$|Seeking to {{capitalise}} on the Greens' {{success in the}} EP elections, a group named Green 2000 was established in July 1990, arguing for an internal reorganisation of the party {{in order to develop}} it into an effective electoral force capable of securing seats in the House of Commons. Its proposed reforms included a more centralised structure, the replacement of the existing party council with a smaller party executive, and the establishment of delegate voting at party conferences. Many party members opposed the reforms, believing that they would undermine the internal party democracy, and amid the arguments various key members resigned or were dismissed from the Greens. Although Green 2000 proposals were defeated at the party's 1990 conference, they were overwhelmingly carried at their 1991 conference, resulting in an internal restructuring of the party. Between the end of 1990 and mid-1992, the party lost over half its members, with those polled indicating that frustration over a lack of clear and effective party leadership was a major reason in their decision. The party fielded more candidates than it <b>had</b> <b>ever</b> <b>done</b> before in the 1992 general election but was widely deemed to have performed poorly.|$|E

Gillan called this the [...] "strangest thing" [...] she <b>had</b> <b>ever</b> <b>done,</b> and was sure she [...] "looked ridiculous". They were filmed performing this as the truck drove to achieve the effect of the passing country. Wide shots were taken of stunt doubles of the three actors riding real horses.

500|$|The soundtrack to Departures was by Joe Hisaishi, a {{composer}} who had gained international recognition {{for his work}} with Hayao Miyazaki and Studio Ghibli. Before shooting began, Takita asked him to prepare a soundtrack which would represent the separation between Daigo and his father, {{as well as the}} mortician's love for his wife. Owing to the importance of cellos and cello music in the narrative, Hisaishi emphasized the instrument in his soundtrack; he described the challenge of centring a score around the cello {{as one of the most}} difficult things he <b>had</b> <b>ever</b> <b>done.</b> This score was played during shooting, which according to Takita [...] "allowed [...] to visualize many of the emotions in the film" [...] and thus contributed to the quality of the finished work.|$|E
