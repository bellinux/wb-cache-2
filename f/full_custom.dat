50|$|In the mid-1980s, a {{designer}} would choose an ASIC manufacturer and implement their design using the design tools {{available from the}} manufacturer. While third-party design tools were available, there was not an effective link from the third-party design tools to the layout and actual semiconductor process performance characteristics of the various ASIC manufacturers. Most designers ended up using factory-specific tools to complete the implementation of their designs. A solution to this problem, which also yielded a much higher density device, was the implementation of standard cells. Every ASIC manufacturer could create functional blocks with known electrical characteristics, such as propagation delay, capacitance and inductance, that could also be represented in third-party tools. Standard-cell design is the utilization of these functional blocks to achieve very high gate density and good electrical performance. Standard-cell design fits between Gate Array and <b>Full</b> <b>Custom</b> design {{in terms of both}} its non-recurring engineering and recurring component cost.|$|E
40|$|The authors {{construct}} {{a model of}} customs unions in which countries charge optimal tariffs. Customs unions internalize the externality that exists whenever two countries import the same good. Also, customs unions make several countries into one large unit with more market power. Big customs unions can improve their members' welfare relative to the free trade. The authors' model of customs unions separates the effects of tariff reduction {{from the effects of}} policy coordination. The movement from Nash equilibrium to a free trade association improves global resource allocations. Moving from a free trade association to a <b>full</b> <b>customs</b> union has ambiguous resource allocation effects. ...|$|R

50|$|The {{technology}} and market {{idea behind the}} foundation of NanGate was to address and solve the inherent shortcomings of standard cell based ASSP/ASIC design as compared to <b>full</b> <b>custom</b> IC design. In standard cell design the designer uses cells from a standard cell library to implement the desired logic functionality of the IC while trying to obtain the target operating frequency at the lowest possible cost in terms of die area and power consumption. The standard cells form the basic building blocks used to build the IC together with macro blocks such as embedded memory, Input-Output (IO), mixed-signal and analog blocks. Each standard cell represents a relatively primitive logic function, such as a NAND gate, with fixed area, timing and power characteristics and is constructed from transistors most often arranged in the pull-up/pull-down fashion of CMOS. A typical standard-cell library for e.g. 40 nanometer CMOS has 500-1500 standard cells and about 150-300 different logic functions.|$|E

50|$|The {{outcome of}} the conference was that the new Communities would share the Common Assembly (now the Parliamentary Assembly) with the ECSC, as they would the European Court of Justice. However, they would not share the ECSC's Council of High Authority. The two new High Authorities would be called Commissions, from a {{reduction}} in their powers. France was reluctant to agree to more supranational powers; hence, the new Commissions would have only basic powers, and important decisions {{would have to be}} approved by the Council (of national Ministers), which now adopted majority voting. Euratom fostered co-operation in the nuclear field, at the time a very popular area, and the European Economic Community was to create a <b>full</b> <b>customs</b> union between members.|$|R
5000|$|Before 2001, <b>full</b> <b>customs</b> checks were {{required}} for ferry travel when travelling from Denmark to other Nordic countries. There was no land border with Denmark before July 2000 when the Öresund Bridge was opened, which had relaxed customs check from the start. Nordic citizens {{did not need}} to be in possession of a passport. [...] Other citizens needed a passport. As a part of the customs check, at least when arriving from Denmark and non-Nordic countries, every car driver was asked about where they had been. For land and ferry travel into Denmark and between Sweden, Norway and Finland, there were much more relaxed customs and passport checks, and often no checks at all. [...] For air travel, there were <b>full</b> passport and <b>customs</b> checks, even though verbally claiming Nordic citizenship with a Scandinavian language, plus showing the ticket for the intra-Nordic flight, or any Nordic identity documentation, was usually enough to pass the passport check. It happened that Nordic citizens without a passport were not allowed to pass until a thorough identity investigation had been made. Passengers travelling by public transport, such as train or air, were usually not interviewed by the customs control.|$|R
