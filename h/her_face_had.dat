5|$|Details of Carol's death were {{revealed}} in the post mortem. There were severe injuries to the skull, and {{it was said that}} <b>her</b> <b>face</b> <b>had</b> been smashed by multiple blows. It was later found in court that the murder weapon had been an ice axe. The body was found to be in a foetal position, which suggested that the body had been dealt with within a few hours of death, before rigor mortis could settle in. It has since been said that the investigators failed to acknowledge that rigor mortis passes in a 24‑to48‑hour time period, and that the body could feasibly have been trussed once rigor mortis had passed. Many unusual knots were used to tie the body, and the same knots were said to be used in Gordon Park's house and boat. This was one of the key pieces of evidence used against Gordon in the trial.|$|E
25|$|Princess Doe is {{the name}} given to an {{unidentified}} homicide victim found in Blairstown, New Jersey, United States, in 1982. The body was a young white female {{between the ages of}} 15 and 20, although she has also been stated to be as young as 14. <b>Her</b> <b>face</b> <b>had</b> been bludgeoned beyond recognition. The approximate height of the victim was 5 feet 2 inches (157 cm) and her weight was 110lbs (50 kg). The body was discovered at the Cedar Ridge Cemetery in Blairstown early on the morning of 15 July 1982. She was the first unidentified decedent to be entered in the National Crime Information Center.|$|E
25|$|Milivi Adams was a {{girl from}} Vieques who {{developed}} and died of cancer and became a symbol {{in the battle against}} the presence of the military. <b>Her</b> <b>face</b> <b>had</b> appeared many times on the covers of Puerto Rican newspapers and magazines, and there were posters with her picture on them on many of Vieques' street corners. The daughter of Zuleyka Calderon and Jose Adams, Milivi was diagnosed with cancer at the age of two years. Although many people blamed the military's bomb testings in Vieques as the source of her cancer, this has not been proven. Given a month to live at the age of three, her cancer went into remission, but at the age of four reappeared, in her brain. She was flown to the United States by her parents, in hopes that treatment would help her; she fought infections, and after the last one, doctors told her parents that her body would not resist another infection treatment. She returned to Puerto Rico, where she died on the morning of November17, 2002.|$|E

25|$|Between 5 and 8 March, {{police would}} find six further bodies of young females at 25 Cromwell Street. Each victim had been {{extensively}} mutilated, and each body bore evidence {{of having been}} subjected to extreme sexual abuse prior to the act of murder. For example, the third set of remains discovered in the cellar was found with a length of cloth wrapped around the skull, and an oval of adhesive tape 16 inches in circumference found with the remains had likely been used to gag this victim, whose ankles and wrists were also bound with a large section of rope. Also found in this grave was a large, serrated knife. The second set of remains was found with a section of tubing twisted into a U-shape alongside her severed limbs, and her skull was found encased in adhesive tape which had been wrapped around the section where <b>her</b> <b>face</b> <b>had</b> been 11 or 12 times, with a narrow plastic tube inserted where the nasal cavities had been in an obvious effort to facilitate her breathing prior to her murder. Each set of remains was missing numerous bones, particularly phalange bones, although when questioned as to this ominous paradigm, Fred refused to divulge the reason or whereabouts of the bones missing from each set of remains.|$|E
500|$|A Certaine Relation {{claims that}} Tannakin Skinker {{was born to}} Joachim and Parnel Skinker in 1618 in [...] "Wirkham, a neuter towne betweene the Emperour and the Hollander, scituate on the river Rhyne". Joachim Skinker is {{described}} as [...] "a man of good revenue, but of a great estate in money and cattle." [...] During Parnel's pregnancy, an elderly woman had begged her for money. Parnel was busy and refused to pay, and the old woman had left, [...] "muttering to her selfe the Divells pater noster, and was heard to say 'As the Mother is Hoggish, so Swinish shall be the Child shee goeth withall. At Tannakin's birth her body and limbs were correctly proportioned, but <b>her</b> <b>face</b> <b>had</b> a pig's snout, [...] "not only a stain and blemish, but a deformed uglinesse, making all the rest loathsome, contemptible and odious to all that lookt upon her in her infancie." [...] The midwife who had delivered the baby was sworn to secrecy, and the Skinkers raised her in a private room. She ate from a silver trough, [...] "to which she stooped and ate, just like a Swine doth in his swilling tub".|$|E
2500|$|Between 1995 and 2000, Binoche was the {{advertising}} {{face of the}} Lancôme perfume Poème, her image adorning print campaigns photographed by Richard Avedon and a television advertising campaign, including an advert directed by Anthony Minghella and scored by Gabriel Yared. By {{the end of this}} period and following roles in a number of prestige productions, critics were wondering if Binoche was typecast as the tragic, despairing muse. In a feature article entitled [...] "The Erotic Face" [...] in the June 2000 edition of British film criticism magazine Sight and Sound, Ginette Vincendeau pondered Binoche's persona; Vincendeau suggested that the fixation of numerous directors upon <b>her</b> <b>face</b> <b>had</b> led to an erasure of her body, and to her being perceived only as a romantic icon rather than a versatile actress.|$|E

2500|$|She {{was young}} and tall of stature, clad in a garment of deep blue, ... Her dress was covered with {{brilliant}} gold stars. The sleeves were ample and long. She wore slippers of the same blue as the dress, ornamented with gold bows. On the head was a black veil half covering the forehead, concealing the hair and ears, and falling over the shoulders. Above this was a crown resembling a diadem, higher in front than elsewhere, and widening out at the sides. A red line encircled the crown at the middle. Her hands were small and extended toward us as in the 'miraculous medal.' <b>Her</b> <b>face</b> <b>had</b> the most exquisite delicacy and a smile of ineffable sweetness. The eyes, of unutterable tenderness, were fixed on us. Like a true mother, she seemed happier in looking at us than we in contemplating.|$|E
2500|$|In {{the early}} morning of [...] December 27, 1985, Fossey was {{discovered}} murdered in the bedroom of her cabin located at {{the far edge of}} the camp in the Virunga Mountains, Rwanda. Her body was found face-up near the two beds where she slept, roughly [...] away from a hole that her assailant(s) had apparently cut in the wall of the cabin. Wayne Richard McGuire, Fossey's last research assistant at Karisoke, was summoned to the scene by Fossey's house servant and found her bludgeoned to death, reporting that [...] "when I reached down to check her vital signs, I saw <b>her</b> <b>face</b> <b>had</b> been split, diagonally, with one machete blow." [...] The cabin was littered with broken glass and overturned furniture, with a 9-mm handgun and ammunition beside her on the floor. Robbery was not believed to be the motive for the crime, as Fossey's valuables were still in the cabin, including her passport, handguns, and thousands of dollars in U.S. bills and traveler's checks.|$|E
2500|$|The then {{president}} of MSF, James Orbinski, gave the Nobel Peace Prize speech {{on behalf of the}} organization. [...] In the opening, he discusses the conditions of the victims of the Rwandan Genocide and focuses on one of his woman patients: “There were hundreds of women, children and men brought to the hospital that day, so many that we had to lay them out on the street and even operate on some of them there. [...] The gutters around the hospital ran red with blood. [...] The woman had not just been attacked with a machete, but her entire body rationally and systematically mutilated. [...] Her ears had been cut off. [...] And <b>her</b> <b>face</b> <b>had</b> been so carefully disfigured that a pattern was obvious in the slashes. [...] She was one among many — living an inhuman and simply indescribable suffering. [...] We could do little more for her at the moment than stop the bleeding with a few necessary sutures. [...] We were completely overwhelmed, and she knew that there were so many others. [...] She said to me in the clearest voice I have ever heard, 'Allez, allez…ummera, ummerasha' — 'Go, go…my friend, find and let live your courage.'" ...|$|E

60|$|The moment I {{opened the}} door I see there was {{something}} wrong. Three times my missis licked 'er lips afore she could speak. <b>Her</b> <b>face</b> <b>'ad</b> gone a dirty white colour, and she was leaning forward with her 'ands on her 'ips, trembling all over with temper.|$|R
60|$|<b>Her</b> <b>face</b> <b>had</b> {{now lost}} its whiteness; it was flushed, rosy, warm.|$|E
60|$|She {{turned to}} me impulsively. <b>Her</b> <b>face</b> <b>had</b> lost its hard look.|$|E

60|$|How {{would she}} look? Would <b>her</b> <b>face</b> <b>have</b> that oldtime peachy bloom, her mouth that {{peculiar}} beautiful curve?
