40|$|The {{oxidation}} kinetics of CVD SiC were measured by thermogravimetric analysis (TGA) in a 4 H 2 (central dot) 12 H 2 O (central dot) 10 CO (central dot) 7 CO 2 (central dot) 67 N 2 gas mixture flowing at 0. 44 cm/s at temperatures between 1300 and 1450 C in <b>fused</b> quartz <b>furnace</b> tubes at I atm total pressure. The SiC was oxidized to form solid SiO 2. At {{less than or}} = 1350 C, the SiO 2 was in turn volatilized.

A curve fitting technique was used to determine the linear and parabolic rate constants from the paralinear kinetic data. Volatilization of the protective SiO 2 scale resulted in accelerated consumption of SiC.

To promote energy efficiency during <b>fused</b> magnesium <b>furnace</b> smelting, four smelting states were introduced in the smelting stage: an unmelted state, semi–molten state, molten state, and overheating state. A smelting identification system to distinguish these smelting states was developed through the use of linear predictive coding and a principal component analysis algorithm. A new smelting condition identification system was obtained. Corresponding pilot productions were conducted to compare the differences between employing the method and not employing the method. All of the pilot production data showed that feeding raw materials over time during the overheating state and decreasing current injection in the molten state could reduce energy consumption as well as increase crystal purity.

40|$|Abstract—In the {{smelting}} {{process of}} <b>fused</b> magnesium <b>furnaces</b> (FMFs), frequent {{changes in the}} raw material granule size and impurity constituent will cause the arc resistance between {{the lower end of}} the electrode and the surface of the molten pool to vary, and thus, the smelt-ing currents fluctuate. Consequently, abnormal conditions, which can arise if the setpoints of electrode currents are not properly adjusted on time, will causethe performance to deteriorate or even the overall operation to stall. Through analysis of the characteristics of different operating con-ditions, this paper presents a data-driven abnormal con-dition identification and self-healing control system. The proposed system extracts the identification rules accord-ing to the current tracking error, as well as the rate and duration of the current fluctuations, and identifies the ab-normal conditions based on rule-based reasoning. The self-healing control is developed using case-based reasoning to correct the current setpoints based on the identification results. The outputs of the control loop track the cor-rected setpoints, thereby forcing the process to recover from the abnormal conditions. The proposed method and the developed control system have been applied to a real FMF, and substantial improvement is achieved with many benefits provided to the factory. The implementation results show that occurrence of abnormal conditions has been reduced by more than 50 %, and the product quality has been increased by more than 2 %.

40|$|A novel {{method to}} produce metal in glass preform and fibre with complex non-circular cross section is presented. The method {{involves}} firstly using conventional glass cutting facilities to cut glass pieces into various key shapes. The complex non-circular pattern is built up using the cut glass and metal insert, {{after which the}} pieces are <b>fused</b> within a <b>furnace.</b> This consolidation is a key step to maintaining geometry during fibre drawing. The metal and glass are selected on a basis of their thermal properties such as coefficient of thermal expansion, and their glass transition, softening and melting temperatures. Traditional methods of fabricating a preform involve ultrasonic milling and drilling of bulk glass or extrusion of glass using complex dies. These approaches are expensive and time consuming, shape limited and for some materials can be temperature limited. The proposed stack and draw method potentially allows for making smaller feature sizes. Applications obtainable from making metal in fibres from this method include the transfer of photons and electrons simultaneously in optoelectronic products. Also, use as metal reinforced glass-matrix composite fibres will be discussed...|$|R

30|$|Based on the {{different}} methods involved in ash deposit over the heating surface, two types of ash deposition are observed, i.e. slagging and the fouling. Boiler slagging and fouling are two main factors that adversely affect the efficiency of boilers [34, 35]. Fireside of the boiler is mainly affected by these problems. These two processes lead to frequent non-operation of soot blowers. Slag is the molten ash and incombustible by-product that remains as residue after coal combustion. Slagging is the deposition of partially <b>fused</b> residues on <b>furnace</b> walls or surfaces exposed to radiant heat. It {{takes place in the}} hottest parts of the boiler. Slag is formed when molten softened ash particles are not cooled to solid state when they reach with the hot surface [36, 37]. It reduces the heat absorption in the furnace, increases furnace exit gas temperature, decreases boiler efficiency and availability due to unplanned shutdowns leading to losses in the operation [37]. It has been found, that serious slagging mainly occurs {{on the walls of the}} furnace. Flue gases in the center of the furnace make it to deflect on other two sides of the walls; thus leading to the impingement of the pulverized-coal flame on to the side walls of the furnace. Due to this process, slagging on side walls takes place. It leads to slight slagging on the arch burner regions and to the front and rear wall regions of the lower furnace [38].|$|R

Then the amounts of titanium dissolved into weter were measured by chelatometrie titration. In this paper, author considered the behavior of dissolution in SiO_ 2 -Na_ 2 O-TiO_ 2 system glasses and compared the dissolving phenomena of SiO_ 2 -Na_ 2 O-V_ 2 O_ 5 system with that of SiO_ 2 -Na_ 2 O-TiO_ 2 system. The results are as follows. 1) The experimental data were tested by analysis of variance and its was proved that log of dissolved amounts was linear function of reciprocal of absolute temperature and had no linear relation to dissolving time as a whole, but there were linear relations between log of dissolving amounts and stirring time {{in the case of}} 20 and 80 minutes. 2) The dissolved amounts increased with increasing Na_ 2 O mol in TiO_ 2 10 and 30 mol, and in TiO_ 2 20 mol there was minimum value of the dissolved amounts at certain composition.

40|$|In {{planetary}} exploration, in situ absolute geochronology {{is one of}} {{the main}} important measurements that needs to be accomplished. Until now, on Mars, the age of the surface is only determined by crater density counting, which gives relative ages. These ages can have a lot of uncertainty as they depend on many parameters. More than that, the curves must be ties to absolute ages. Thus far, only the lost lander Beagle 2 was designed to conduct absolute geochronology measurements, though some recent attempts using MSL Curiosity show that this investigation is feasible and should be strongly encouraged for future flight. Experimental: The Potassium (K) -Argon Laser Experiment (KArLE) is being developed at MSFC through the NASA Planetary Instrument Definition and Development Program (PIDDP). The goal of this experiment is to provide in situ geochronology based on the K-Ar method. A laser ablates a rock under high vacuum, creating a plasma which is sensed by an optical spectrometer to do Laser Induced Breakdown Spectroscopy (LIBS). The ablated material frees gases, including radiogenic 40 Ar,which is measured by a mass spectrometer (MS). As the potassium is a content and the 40 Ar is a quantity, the ablated mass needed in order to relate them. The mass is given by the product of the ablated volume by the density of this material. So we determine the mineralogy of the ablated material with the LIBS spectra and images and calculate its density. The volume of the pit is measured by using microscopy. LIBS measurement of K under high vacuum: Three independant projects [1, 2, 3] including KArLE, are developing geochronological instruments based on this LA-LIBS-MS method. Despite several differences in their setup, all of them have validated the methods with analyses and ages. However, they all described difficulties with the LIBS measurements of K [3, 4]. At ambient pressure, the quantification of K by LIBS on geological materials can be accurate [5]. However the protocol of the LA-LIBS-MS experiment required hundreds of shots under high vacuum in order to free enough 40 Ar* to be measured by the QMS. This long duration of ablation may induces significant changes in the LIBS spectra. The pressure may increases by orders of magnitudewithin the chamber and the laser pit geometry can change the effectiveness of ablation and intensity of plasma light received. These effects introduce variation between the first and last spectra and so the quantification of K is more complex. The ablation of one crater can give, depending on the protocol of acquisition, from tens to hundreds of spectra. Protocol and results: We are in the process of further characterizing the variation introduced into LIBS spectra by the use of hundreds of laser shots, and definining a protocol that can be used to ensure accuracy and reporoducibility in the results. We are using natural rock powder standards <b>fused</b> in a <b>furnace,</b> as well as mars analog samples with known K content. We will show the result of the calibration and some new statistical approaches in order to apprehend the effects of the long time ablation on rocks under high vacuum...|$|R
