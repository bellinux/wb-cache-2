KROCHMANN Measurements of the spectral luminous efficiency of monochromatic radiation within the mesopic range have already been published. Calculations show that the measured curves can be simulated by a linear combination of the spectral luminous efficiency of monochromatic radiation for scotopic (V’(&lambda;)) and photopic (V(&lambda;)) vision by the equation: Veq(&lambda;) =a. ’ & mbda;) +. la a;) where the values of a and b depend on the <b>equivalent</b> <b>luminance.</b> The difference between the simulated and measured curves of the spectral luminous efficiency of mono-chromatic radiation are discussed. The values of the maximum spectral luminous efficacy Kmeq within the mesopic range have been calculated.

40|$|AbstractFour-week-olds, 9 -week-olds, {{and adult}} {{subjects}} were tested with low spatial frequency sinusoidal gratings {{moving at a}} speed of 25 deg/sec. Luminance-modulated and red/green gratings were presented either separately, or superimposed and moving in opposite directions in a chromatic motion nulling paradigm. An adult observer judged {{the direction of the}} slow phase of the subject's eye movements. Luminance-modulated gratings elicited directionally appropriate eye movements in all three age groups, with contrast thresholds decreasing markedly with age. For red/green gratings alone, 4 -week-olds responded only marginally, but 9 -week-olds and adults produced consistent directionally appropriate eye movements. In the motion nulling condition, 15 % contrast luminance-modulated gratings were about equally effective in nulling the motion of the red/green gratings in all three age groups. A formal model of the motion nulling paradigm, separating threshold and <b>equivalent</b> <b>luminance</b> contrast parameters, was developed and applied to the data. Model fits showed that <b>equivalent</b> <b>luminance</b> contrast was constant or nearly constant across age groups. This outcome is consistent with the hypothesis that, with respect to adults, infants show a uniform rather than a differential loss of sensitivity to moving red/green vs luminance-modulated stimuli...|$|E
40|$|AbstractTo {{test whether}} the {{binocular}} contour rivalry mechanism is tritanopic, we presented isoluminant, rival stimuli visible only via the short-wavelength-sensitive (S) cones. We stimulated only the S cones with violet gratings superimposed {{on a bright}} yellow field that adapted {{the responses of the}} middle- and long-wavelength-sensitive (M and L) cones. We found that an S-cone grating presented to one eye rivalled with an orthogonal grating presented to the other. Rivalry persisted over a range of luminances and contrasts of the S-cone stimuli, and was greater than could be accounted for by nonrival fading. The spatial spread of rivalry from S-cone stimuli is similar to that for the same stimuli when visible also to the M and L cones (luminance stimuli). We found that an S-cone stimulus would rival with a luminance stimulus, and exploited this to determine the <b>equivalent</b> <b>luminance</b> contrast of S-cone stimuli by putting them in a rivalry competition with luminance stimuli. For rivalry, the <b>equivalent</b> <b>luminance</b> contrast of isoluminant, S-cone stimuli is much less than their S-cone contrast. The existence of rivalry with isoluminant stimuli, along with earlier evidence that such stimuli can support stereopsis, challenges the view that an achromatic channel alone drives certain higher level functions such as depth perception...|$|E

30|$|The <b>equivalent</b> veiling <b>luminance</b> depends {{directly}} on the iluminance produced by the glare source over the eye, in a perpendicular plane to the vision line (Eeye) and inversely with {{the square of the}} angle between the vision line and the glare source (in degrees). The expression (3) has as application limit θ values lower than 60 ° and there are also corrections according to the observer’s age (Adrian & Schreuder 1970; Fisher & Christie 1965).|$|R
40|$|Simultaneous {{lightness}} {{contrast is}} stronger when {{the dark and}} light backgrounds of the classic display (where one of the targets is an increment {{and the other is}} a decrement) are replaced by articulated fields of <b>equivalent</b> average <b>luminances.</b> Although routinely attributed to articulation per se, this effect may simply result from the increase in highest luminance in the light articulated, vs plain, background; by locally darkening the decremental target, such an increase would amplify the difference between the targets. We disentangled the effects of highest luminance and articulation by measuring, separately, the magnitude of lightness contrast on dark and light plain and articulated backgrounds. We found that highest luminance and articulation contribute separately to the final illusion. ...|$|R
40|$|The {{described}} microprocessor-based {{video system}} provides a simple, clinically useful means for testing color detection thresholds in the extrafoveal visual field. Independent control of luminance and brightness of colored objects and their surround permit separate assessment of achromatic and chromatic visual thresholds. Central colored targets are luminance-matched {{to a white}} surround by heterochromatic flicker photometry. Static and/or kinetic presentation of variably saturated red, green, or blue objects in a white surround of <b>equivalent</b> <b>luminance</b> permit mapping of the thresholds for color perception in the extrafoveal visual field.

40|$|Five {{experiments}} {{investigated the}} types of changes that disrupt the preview effect [...] the benefit gained in difficult search tasks from presenting some distractors earlier in time. A shape change with or without an overall luminance change {{at the location of}} an old item was found to disrupt the preview effect, whereas an <b>equivalent</b> <b>luminance</b> change alone or an isoluminant color change was not disruptive. Results suggest that (a) relatively low-level visual changes may not be sufficient to abolish the benefit, (b) the benefit most likely occurs through inhibition applied to locations within a location master map, and (c) inhibition need not be applied to surface features of objects...|$|E
40|$|Compensatory {{tracking}} {{performance was}} shown to be substantially degraded by oscillation of the visual display at both 1. 0 and 2. 0 Hz. The severity of this decrement was altered significantly by changes in both the color {{and the intensity of}} the display illumination. Performance was significantly better with red light illuminating the display at 0. 05 mL than with blue light at the <b>equivalent</b> <b>luminance.</b> This improvement in performance was similar in magnitude to that found for an increase in broad-band illumination of the display where luminance was increased from 1 / 2 log unit below to 1 / 2 log unit above 0. 05 mL. Visual mechanisms that may have been responsible for these findings are suggested...|$|E
40|$|Two {{methods for}} {{estimating}} the visual effects of light scattered from a laser glare source were compared: (1) a veiling luminance (VL) model that convolves a radiometric {{scan of the}} corneal light distribution with a point-spread function to calculate the retinal distribution and (2) psychophysically determined <b>equivalent</b> background <b>luminance</b> (EBL). For six subjects, detection thresholds for a 12 -arc-min-diameter test spot were measured at 24 points in the glare field (4 quadrants 3 6 eccentricities between 0. 25 and 8 deg). Measured Weber fractions were used to calculate EBLs for each test point. Output of the VL model matched the EBL data well, but underestimated the EBL at the smallest (0. 25 -deg) eccentricity and overestimated it at eccentricities from 1 to 4 deg. This model can be a useful predictor of visual decrements {{in a variety of}} glare situations...|$|R
40|$|It {{has been}} informally shown [Gilchrist et al, 1999 Psychological Review 106 795 - 834; Adelson, 2000, in The New Cognitive Neurosciences Ed. M Gazzaniga (Cambridge, MA: MIT Press) ] that {{simultaneous}} lightness contrast (SLC) is enhanced when {{the dark and}} light surrounds of the classic display are replaced by articulated fields of <b>equivalent</b> average <b>luminances.</b> We explored this effect systematically, by comparing dark and light homogeneous and articulated surrounds in all possible combinations. Relative to their surrounds, the two targets could be double increments in luminance, double decrements, or one increment and one decrement. Observers adjusted the luminance of one target to match the achromatic colour of the other. Gilchrist et al's (1999) anchoring model accounts for increased SLC on articulated surrounds by assuming that (i) SLC occurs because in the local framework (target plus immediate surround) the incremental target is white rather than grey, and (ii) increasing the articulation of such a surround causes a stronger weighting of the local framework, thus magnifying {{the difference between the}} two targets. Our results are consistent with the first but not with the second assumption, and are discussed in the light of a modified version of the anchoring model...|$|R
40|$|Headlamps provide {{guidance}} and visibility {{to the driver}} at night, but they also cause glare to oncoming drivers. While providing maximum visibility to the driver without disabling other road users is a challenge for vehicle lighting designers, {{it is also the}} responsibility of highway operators to monitor their network and implement countermeasures where visibility or glare problems are diagnosed. In this paper, we describe two complementary monitoring tools to help road operators assess headlight visibility and glare levels. The Nighttime Visibility Meter Tool addresses secondary highways devoid of roadway lighting. It is based on a conventional driving scenario, a standard computational target visibility model, and a widely used retroreflectivity monitoring apparatus. It takes pavement retroreflected luminance coefficient profiles as input, and produces small target visibility distance profiles as output. Such profiles can serve to locate local discontinuities where an obstacle on the roadway might surprise the drivers at night under headlight illumination. The Nighttime Visibility Meter Tool can take disability glare from headlight of oncoming traffic into account. Preliminary tests have demonstrated it can benefit road inspection, but as it is based on a conventional scenario, it relies on somehow arbitrary assumptions which still need to be validated, and its output needs to be calibrated in field experiments. The Glare Meter Tool was designed for in the field assessment of the level of glare from headlights of opposing vehicles in a variety of situations, without relying on subjective reports of observers. Both disability glare and discomfort glare were addressed. The net result is an instrument that is capable of acquiring an image of a scene with glare, then analyzing the image to output a number on the standard, widely-used De Boer Rating Scale for Evaluation of Discomfort Glare, and also an <b>equivalent</b> veiling <b>luminance</b> {{that can be used to}} assess the level of disability glare. The Glare Meter Tool has been demonstrated to provide accurate results in both laboratory and field experiments, but at the current level of development, its practical use in the field is compromised by dynamic range limitations and exposure time requirements. The Night Time Visibility Meter Tool is intended for monitoring whole itineraries to detect potentially low visibility situations, while the Glare Meter Tool is intended for accurately assessing the severity of glare at pre-identified spots. They complement each other because the Visibility Meter can help decide where to deploy the Glare Meter Tool. This is the reason why disability glare was introduced into the Visibility Meter Tool, while it originally considered situations without oncoming vehicles, and into the Glare Meter Tool, while it originally considered discomfort glare only.

40|$|The {{chromatic}} {{properties of}} an image yield strong cues for object boundaries and thus hold the potential to facilitate the detection of object motion. The extent to which cortical motion detectors exploit chromatic information, however, remains a matter of debate. To address this further, we quantified the strength of chromatic input to directionally selective neurons in the middle temporal area (MT) of macaque cerebral cortex using an <b>equivalent</b> <b>luminance</b> contrast (EqLC) paradigm. This paradigm, in which two sinusoidal gratings, one heterochro-matic and the other achromatic, are superimposed and moved in opposite directions, allows the sensitivity of motion detectors to heterochromatic stimuli to be quantified and expressed rel-ative to the benchmark of sensitivity for a luminance-defined stimulus. The results of these experiments demonstrate that the chro...|$|E

The Helmholtz–Kohlrausch (H-K) effect, i. e., an increase in brightness perception due {{to an increase in}} saturation, is clearly observed. This brightness perception is compared with the calculated brightness according to six existing vision models, color appearance models, and models based on the concept of <b>equivalent</b> <b>luminance.</b> Although these models included the H-K effect and half of them were developed to work with unrelated colors, none of the models seemed to be able to fully predict the perceived brightness.

40|$|A {{group of}} three pigeons was trained on a 4 -ply {{multiple}} schedule: a green color and a vertical line superimposed upon an achromatic background as positive stimuli, and a red color and a horizontal line on an achromatic background as negative stimuli. The pigeons were tested with the vertical line superimposed upon different achromatic background intensities, then with the vertical line superimposed upon different green background intensities, and finally with the vertical line and its training achromatic backgfound attenuated (and unattenuated) by a neutral density filter. The gradients peaked at the luminance of the achromatic background used during training and at the <b>equivalent</b> <b>luminance</b> for the green background when it was substituted for the achromatic background. The brightness contrast, not the background luminance, was the critical variable as the neutral density filter attenuated both the line and the background equally, leaving brightness contrast unchanged; {{there was no response}} decrement to this attenuated stimulus. Two other groups of three pigeons showed that they attended to line orientation as well as to brightness contrast. The brightness contrast hypothesis was extended to explain results of attention experiments and combined cue experiments which have used line stimuli in combinations with different backgrounds...|$|E
40|$|Background: At the {{entrance}} of a tunnel, reflection of sunlight from the surrounding environment {{and a lack of}} adequate lighting usually cause some vision problems. The {{purpose of this study was}} to perform a safety evaluation of lighting on a very long road in Ilam, Iran. Methods: The average luminance was measured using a luminance meter (model S 3; Hagner, Solna, Sweden). A camera (model 108, 35 -mm single-lens reflex; Yashica, Nagano, Japan) was used to take photographs of the safe stopping distance from the tunnel entrance. <b>Equivalent</b> <b>luminance</b> was determined according to the Holliday polar diagram. Results: Considering the average luminance at the tunnel entrance (116. 7 cd/m 2) and using Adrian's equation, the safe level of lighting at {{the entrance}} of the tunnel was determined to be 0. 7. Conclusion: A comparison between the results of the safe levels of lighting at {{the entrance of}} the tunnel and the De Boer scale showed that the phenomenon of black holes is created at the tunnel entrance. This may lead to a misadaptation of the drivers’ eyes to the change in luminance level at the entrance of the tunnel, thereby increasing the risk of road accidents in this zone...|$|E
40|$|AbstractThe {{purpose of}} the present study was to {{investigate}} the capacity of infants to code the direction of motion of moving tritan-modulated gratings. Infant and adult subjects were tested with 0. 2 c/d sinusoidal gratings moving at a speed of 20 deg/sec. Three conditions were tested: luminance-modulated gratings, tritan-modulated gratings, and luminance- vs tritan-modulated gratings superimposed and moving in opposite directions in a chromatic motion nulling paradigm. Two-month-old infants were tested in all three conditions, while 4 -month-olds were tested in only the first two conditions. For infant subjects, an adult observer reported the direction of the slow phase of the infant's eye movements; adult subjects judged the perceived direction of motion of the stimuli. Luminance-modulated gratings produced directionally appropriate eye movements (DEM) in all age groups. Tritan gratings presented alone did not produce DEM in either 2 - or 4 -month-olds, but did so in adults. Mean <b>equivalent</b> <b>luminance</b> contrasts were near zero in 2 -month-olds, and small but reliably above zero in adults. In sum, the present study provides no evidence that infants can code the direction of motion of moving tritan gratings. © 1997 Elsevier Science Ltd. All rights reserved...|$|E
40|$|Energy {{performance}} of lighting systems has assumed a signiﬁcant {{role in the}} assessment of buildings’ consumptions and consequently lighting design is aimed to reduce installed power {{but at the same time}} to achieve an excellent lighting quality both for visual and health purposes. Lighting design is nowadays essentially based on illuminance values on visual tasks and surrounding areas, but today designers’ and researchers’ interest is focused on the analysis of luminance maps obtained through video luminance meters or with numeric simulation tools. Luminance maps availability focus the attention on a more accurate study of the light reaching the eyes (luminance), rather than on the light that arrives on surfaces (illuminance). However luminance values, based on photopic sensitivity, do not always adequately describe the quality of a lit environment and how it is perceived; therefore it is necessary to consider parameters like brightness or <b>equivalent</b> <b>luminance.</b> The ﬁrst part of this work describes primary factors that inﬂuence lit environments’ perception along with the main available luminance–brightness relations. Moreover a software for the luminance maps’ analysis is described with the goal of ﬁnding and testing the most signiﬁcant parameters for the lit environment’s description, both for comfort and energy purposes...|$|E
40|$|AbstractA common {{mechanism}} for perceiving first-order, luminance-defined, and second-order, texture-contrast defined apparent motion between two element locations is indicated by: (1) transitivity—whether or not motion is perceived is inter-changeably affected by activationally <b>equivalent</b> <b>luminance</b> and contrast changes at each location, (2) local integration—whether or not motion is perceived {{depends on the}} net activation change resulting from simultaneous background-relative luminance and background-relative contrast changes at the same element location, and (3) inseparability—apparent motion is not perceived through independent first- or second-order mechanisms when luminance and contrast co-vary at the same location. These results, which are predicted by the response characteristics of directionally selective cells in areas V 1, MT, and MST, are not instead attributable {{to changes in the}} location of the most salient element (third-order motion), attentive feature tracking, or artifactual first-order motion.

40|$|We report {{experiments}} which {{compare the}} ability of subjects to employ colour vs luminance contrast {{as a basis for}} discriminating the degree of collinearity of random element string pairs. The {{purpose of the study was}} to determine the extent to which spatial integration mechanisms could utilize colour contrast. In order to probe directly the processes of spatial integration per se, it was necessary to control for any differences in the efficiency with which the visual system utilized colour and luminance contrast to locate the positions of the i~~dual elements in the test stimuli. To do this we first established the “equivalent ” luminance contrast of an isochromatic stimulus which produced equal performance to an isohuninant stimulus in a 2 element per string alignment ask. This equated the colour defined and luminance defined stimuli for local positional acuity. We then measured performance for both isohuninant and <b>equivalent</b> <b>luminance</b> contrast stimuli for strings consisting of 2, 4, 8 and I 6 elements. This tested for any differences in the processes of spatial integration. For both unmasked stimuli and stimuli embedded in lu~n ~ noise, there was no consistent rend favouring either luminance or colour contrast as the number of elements in the stimuli was increased. We conclude that the visual system is able to employ colour contrast as efficiently as luminance contrast for collinearity judgements, thus implicating a general role for colour vision in spatia...|$|E
40|$|Two pigeons {{were trained}} to {{discriminate}} a grating stimulus from a blank stimulus of <b>equivalent</b> <b>luminance</b> in a three-key chamber. The stimuli and blanks were presented behind a transparent center key. The procedure was a conditional discrimination in which pecks on the left key were reinforced if the blank had been present behind the center key and pecks on the right key were reinforced if the grating had been present behind the center key. The spatial frequency of the stimuli was varied in each session from four to 29. 5 lines per millimeter in accordance with {{a variation of the}} method of constant stimuli. The number of lines per millimeter that the subjects could discriminate at threshold was determined from psychometric functions. Data were collected at five values of stimulus luminance ranging from [...] 0. 07 to 3. 29 log cd/m 2. The distance from the stimulus to the anterior nodal point of the eye, which was determined from measurements taken from high-speed motion-picture photographs of three additional pigeons and published intraocular measurements, was 62. 0 mm. This distance and the grating detection thresholds were used to calculate the visual acuity of the birds at each level of luminance. Acuity improved with increasing luminance to a peak value of 0. 52, which corresponds to a visual angle of 1. 92 min, at a luminance of 2. 33 log cd/m 2. Further increase in luminance produced a small decline in acuity...|$|E
