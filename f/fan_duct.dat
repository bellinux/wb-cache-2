The crew of two sat side-by-side in an enclosed cockpit which hinged on the centreline in a gull-wing door arrangement to give access. Dual controls were fitted. The engine, a [...] water-cooled Audi NSU wankel engine was positioned behind the cockpit, {{and drove the}} ducted fan situated behind the engine. The radiator for the engine was fitted in the aircraft's nose. The rear fuselage, which carried a T-tail, consisted of a narrow boom extended behind the <b>fan</b> <b>duct,</b> supported by triangular section beams in a cruciform arrangement. The aircraft's wings and horizontal tail surfaces were taken from a Grumman American AA-1, while the vertical tail surfaces were new. At first the fan was ungeared, which resulted in high noise levels. The engine {{was replaced by a}} [...] engine in 1974, and considerable testing was carried out with various designs of fans and reduction gearing {{in order to reduce the}} noise to acceptable levels. The use of a three-bladed fiberglass fan, with swept blades driven via a gearbox allowed noise levels to be reduced to well below the German statutory limits for light aircraft. The first prototype Fanliner, D-EJFL with makers number 001, was exhibited at the June 1975 Paris Air Show.|$|E

5000|$|A corn {{harvester}} is a machine used on farms to harvest corn stripping the stalks about one foot {{from the ground}} shooting the stalks through the header to the ground. The corn is stripped from its stalk and then moves through the header to the intake conveyor belt. From there it goes up the conveying system through a fan system, separating the remaining stalks from the ears. The stalks blow out the <b>fan</b> <b>duct</b> into the field while the ears drop onto another conveyor belt. The ears ride the belt and drop into a large moving bucket.|$|E
50|$|Higher overall {{pressure}} ratios can {{be achieved}} by either raising the HP compressor pressure ratio or adding an intermediate-pressure (IP) compressor between the fan and HP compressor, to supercharge or boost the latter unit helping to raise the overall pressure ratio of the engine cycle to the very high levels employed today (i.e., greater than 40:1, typically). All of the large American turbofans (e.g., General Electric CF6, GE90 and GEnx plus Pratt & Whitney JT9D and PW4000) feature an IP compressor mounted on the LP shaft and driven, like the fan, by the LP turbine, the mechanical speed of which is dictated by the tip speed and diameter of the fan. The Rolls-Royce BR715 is a non-American example of this. The high bypass ratios (i.e., <b>fan</b> <b>duct</b> flow/core flow) used in modern civil turbofans tends to reduce the relative diameter of the attached IP compressor, causing its mean tip speed to decrease. Consequently, more IPC stages are required to develop the necessary IPC pressure rise.|$|E

40|$|Uniform-flow annular-duct Green's {{functions}} are {{the essential elements}} of the classical acoustic analogy approach {{to the problem of}} computing the noise generated by rotor-stator interaction inside the <b>fan</b> <b>duct.</b> This paper investigates the accuracy of this class of Green's functions for predicting the duct noise levels when measured stator vane unsteady surface pressures are used as input to the theoretical formulation. The accuracy of the method is evaluated by comparing the predicted and measured acoustic power levels for the NASA 48 inch low speed Active Noise Control Fan. The unsteady surface pressures are measured,by an array of microphones imbedded in the suction and pressure sides of a single vane, while the duct mode levels are measured using a rotating rake system installed in the inlet and exhaust sections of the <b>fan</b> <b>duct.</b> The predicted levels are computed using properly weighted integrals of measured surface pressure distribution. The data-theory comparisons are generally quite good particularly when the mode cut-off criterion is carefully interpreted.
