40|$|Two broadly {{applicable}} {{strategies for}} extending the available ligand platforms of the virtually unexplored terminal Ti=N-NR 2 functional group are described, {{along with the}} highly selective room temperature insertion of alkynes into the N-N bond of Ti{MeN(CH 2 CH 2 NSiMe 3) 2 }(NNPh 2) (py) and the catalytic cis-diamination of PhC[triple bond]CMe by <b>diphenylhydrazine...</b>|$|E

40|$|Complexes (dme) TaCl_ 3 (NNPh_ 2) (1) and (dme) NbCl_ 3 (NNPh_ 2) (2) (dme = 1, 2 -dimethoxyethane) were {{synthesized}} from MCl 5 and <b>diphenylhydrazine</b> via a Lewis-acid assisted dehydrohalogenation reaction. Monomeric 1 {{has been}} characterized by X-ray, IR, UV−vis, ^(1) H NMR, and ^(13) C NMR spectroscopy and contains a κ^(1) -bound hydrazido(2 -) moiety. Unlike the corresponding imido derivatives, 1 is dark blue because of an LMCT that has been lowered in energy {{as a result of}} an N_(α) −N_(β) antibonding interaction that raises the highest occupied molecular orbital (HOMO). Reaction of 1 with a variety of neutral, mono- and dianionic ligands generates the corresponding ligated complexes retaining the κ^(1) -bound [Ta−NNPh_ 2] moiety. ...|$|E

Once venom has been injected, pustules will form and no form of treatment will prevent them from occurring.

40|$|This Thesis {{reports the}} {{synthesis}} and reactions of titanium-nitrogen multiply bonded compounds. Reactions with both acidic and hydridic element-hydrogen bonds are explored along with unsaturated small molecules in general. Chapter One provides a background on imido and hydrazido complexes, {{starting with the}} relevance of the hydrazido ligand to nitrogen fixation. Group 4 alkylidene hydrazide and alkoxyimide complexes are also reviewed. The Chapter focuses in particular on the synthesis, structure, and stoichiometric and catalytic reactions of these complexes with unsaturated substrates. Chapter Two describes the synthesis of new titanium imido complexes and the reactions with molecules containing NâH or OâH bonds, internal alkynes and nitriles. The analogous reactions of the hydrazido compound Ti(N 2 iPr N Me) (NNPh 2) (py) are also investigated. Chapter Three details the reactions of the imido compound Ti(N 2 iPr N Me) (NXyl) (py) with terminal alkynes. Unusual reaction products are described and a full mechanistic study into their formation along with their synthesis and characterisation is presented. In addition, {{the relevance of the}}se reactions to the catalytic hydrohydrazination of terminal alkynes and <b>diphenylhydrazine</b> with Ti(N 2 iPr N Me) (NNPh 2) (py) is discussed. Chapter Four describes the reactivity of the hydrazido compound Ti(N 2 iPr N Me) (NNPh 2) (py) with a range of silanes and boranes. These reactions are then explored through an in-depth experimental and computational study. Chapter Five presents full experimental procedures and characterising data for the new complexes reported. </p...|$|E
40|$|This thesis {{focuses on}} the {{synthesis}} and characterization of scandium compounds. One goal {{was to investigate the}} solution reactivity of {CSc 6 }I 12 Sc, which resulted in the isolation of a molecular scandium nitride, [(C 5 H 5) 2 ScNSc(C 5 H 5) (THF) ] 2, and a scandium propoxide complex, [(C 5 H 5) 2 Sc(µ-OPr) ] 2. Besides this, priority was given to the synthesis and characterization of the first scandium dinitrogen complex, [(C 5 Me 4 H) 2 Sc] 2 (µ-η 2 :η 2 -N 2), along with its precursor compounds: (C 5 Me 4 H) 2 ScCl(THF), (C 5 Me 4 H) 2 Sc(η 3 -C 3 H 5) and [(C 5 Me 4 H) 2 Sc] 2 [(µ-Ph) BPh 3]. The reduction of the latter complex with KC 8 under N 2 gave the elusive [(C 5 Me 4 H) 2 Sc] 2 (µ-η 2 :η 2 -N 2). Structure determination supported by DFT calculations revealed a coplanar arrangement of a bridging side-on bound dinitrogen unit and two scandium atoms. In one reaction, the dinitrogen complex co-crystallized with an oxide impurity as {[(C 5 Me 4 H) 2 Sc] 2 (µ-η 2 :η 2 -N 2) [(C 5 Me 4 H) 2 Sc] 2 (µ-O) }. Additionally, the borohydride complexes (C 5 Me 4 R) 2 M(BH 4) (THF) x (M = Sc, Y; R = H, Me; x = 0, 1) were prepared. Yttrium borohydride complexes were investigated with respect to their dinitrogen activation capability, but were found to be inactive. Ligand based reactivity of (C 5 Me 4 R) 2 Sc(η 3 -C 3 H 5) (R = H, Me) occured with 9 -BBN (9 -borabicyclo[3. 3. 1]nonane) to form the corresponding (C 5 Me 4 R) 2 Sc(µ-H) 2 BC 8 H 14 complexes, from which oxygen exposure (R = H) yielded (C 5 Me 4 H) 2 Sc(µ-O) BC 8 H 14. Subsequent investigations focused on the reaction of [(C 5 Me 4 H) 2 Sc] 2 [(µ-Ph) BPh 3] with KC 5 Me 4 H and gave (&# 61544; 5 -C 5 Me 4 H) 2 Sc(&# 61544; 1 -C 5 Me 4 H), which was structurally characterized and is the first example of an &# 61544; 1 -coordination mode for a (C 5 Me 4 H) - ligand bound to a rare-earth metal. This complex undergoes Sigma Bond Metathesis (SBM) reactivity towards diphenyldichalcogenides, PhEEPh (E = S, Se, Te), to produce [(C 5 Me 4 H) 2 ScSPh] 2 and (C 5 Me 4 H) 2 ScEPh (E = Se, Te) complexes. The analogous products could be isolated and were fully characterized through the ligand based reactivity of (C 5 Me 4 H) 2 Sc(η 3 -C 3 H 5) and PhEEPh reagents. These reactions also worked in the presence of THF to yield the solvated complexes (C 5 Me 4 H) 2 ScEPh(THF) (E = S, Se, Te). The reaction of (C 5 Me 4 H) 2 Sc(η 3 -C 3 H 5) with pySSpy produced the analogous (C 5 Me 4 H) 2 ScSpy complex. In addition, the formation of a scandium selenium cluster complex [(C 5 Me 4 H) Sc] 3 [SePh] 6 was identified and reactivity studies with PhTeTePh additionally resulted in the isolation of a scandium tellurium cluster compound, {[(C 5 Me 5) Sc] 4 (μ 3 -Te) 4 }. The functionalization of N 2 O via insertion into the metal carbon bond of allyl compounds, (C 5 Me 4 R) 2 M(η 3 -C 3 H 5) (M = Sc, Y, La, Sm; R = H, Me) formed [(C 5 Me 4 R) 2 M(µ-&# 61544; 1 :&# 61544; 2 -ON=NC 3 H 5) ] 2 complexes. The insertion of iPrN=C=NiPr into the Sc-C bond of (C 5 Me 4 H) 2 Sc(&# 61544; 3 -C 3 H 5) gave (C 5 Me 4 H) 2 Sc[(iPr) NC(CH 2 CH=CH 2) N(iPr) -κ 2 N,N']. Finally, although the desired products were not isolated from an attempted reaction of (C 5 Me 4 H) 2 Sc(&# 61544; 3 -C 3 H 5) with <b>diphenylhydrazine,</b> a scandium hydroxo cluster complex (C 5 Me 4 H) 5 Sc 5 (µ 5 -O) (µ 3 -OH) 4 (µ 2 -OH) 4 &# 8729;[(C 6 H 5) NH] 2 was isolated...|$|E
