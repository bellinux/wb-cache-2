5|$|The Arch {{demolition}} {{was formally}} {{announced by the}} Minister of Transport, Ernest Marples in July 1961, but immediately drew widespread protest. Experts {{did not believe the}} £190,000 estimate and suspected <b>foreign</b> <b>firms</b> could move the Arch on rollers for substantially less. The Earl of Euston, the Earl of Rosse and John Betjeman all protested against the redevelopment. On 16 October, 75 architects and students staged a formal demonstration against the demolition inside the Great Hall, and a week later Sir Charles Wheeler led a deputation to speak with the Prime Minister Harold Macmillan against the demolition. Macmillan replied that as well as the cost, there was no place large enough to put the Arch that would look in keeping with its surroundings. Demolition began on 6 November and was completed within four months.|$|E
5|$|There {{are many}} North Korean tobacco companies, making some 30 {{different}} types of cigarettes, with the biggest tobacco company being the North Korea General Tobacco Corporation. Some companies export tobacco to the Middle East and elsewhere, sometimes in partnership with <b>foreign</b> <b>firms.</b> For example, the Taedong River Tobacco Company and the Rason Shinhung Tobacco Company, both operating in the Rason Special Economic Zone, are partnered with the Chinese Jilin Tobacco. British American Tobacco also has business in the country, but it has reduced its involvement due to political pressure and public relations reasons. During the Cold War, North Korea paid for goods it imported from the Soviet Union with poor quality tobacco. Later, {{during the years of}} the Sunshine Policy, high-end Pyongyang brand cigarettes were exported to South Korea where they were popular among South Koreans who wanted to express a pro-reunification stance. There are some privately owned tobacco factories, some of which are known to produce counterfeit brand cigarettes for export as part of North Korea's illicit activities to earn hard currency.|$|E

40|$|We {{examine how}} the protection-seeking effort of an import-competing industry, {{in the form of}} an {{antidumping}} petition, is affected by the <b>foreign</b> <b>firm’s</b> FDI opportunity. In equilibrium, the protection-seeking effort is either blockading, deterring, or accommodating FDI. When FDI is deterred, the protection-seeking effort decreases as the antidumping duty increases, and the <b>foreign</b> <b>firm</b> can benefit from an increase in the duty. Therefore, when the future duty depends on current exports, the <b>foreign</b> <b>firm</b> may increase its exports in order to dampen protection seeking. Namely, antidumping policy can induce more “dumping” when the <b>foreign</b> <b>firm</b> has an FDI opportunity...|$|R
5|$|The game changes however if the {{government}} credibly promises to subsidize the domestic firm if it enters the market, as illustrated in Figure 2.

If the <b>foreign</b> <b>firm</b> does not enter of course, it is still profitable for the domestic firm to enter. As a result, regardless of the action of the <b>foreign</b> <b>firm,</b> the domestic firm's incentive is to enter the market.

Some nations, including Liberia and Sierra Leone, have had stationary bandits who use extraction of resources such as diamonds, cobalt and timber {{in order to increase}} their political power. They often enforce their right to these resources by claiming to be protecting the people. These warlords, or stationary bandits, often partner with compliant <b>foreign</b> <b>firms</b> and create symbiotic relationships to yield greater power for the warlords and a source of wealth for external firms. The result is a political system in which a dominant coalition of warlords strips and distributes valuable assets in exchange for bureaucratic services and security from <b>foreign</b> <b>firms.</b>|$|E

In contrast, they find that the likelihood of a U.S. listing among small <b>foreign</b> <b>firms</b> choosing between the Nasdaq and LSE's Alternative Investment Market decreased following SOX. The negative effect among small firms is consistent with these companies being less able to absorb the incremental costs associated with SOX compliance.

Foreign market entry: a theoretical analysis by Arijit Mukherjee and Soma Mukherjee Abstract: This paper considers investment strategies of a <b>foreign</b> <b>firm</b> in a host country. The <b>foreign</b> <b>firm</b> apprehends that knowledge spillover will encourage entry in the host country. We show that <b>foreign</b> <b>firm</b> delays its investment for sufficiently lower threat of entry. If threat of entry is sufficiently strong, it invests at the beginning with its superior technology. For intermediate threat of entry, we find that <b>foreign</b> <b>firm</b> brings its relatively inferior technology initially and superior technology in future when threat of entry has been eliminated. If inferior technology of <b>foreign</b> <b>firm</b> too creates threat of entry, it reduces effectiveness of introducing technologies sequentially. Further, we show that there may be a conflict between <b>foreign</b> <b>firm’s</b> optimal decision and welfare of the host country. JEL classification: F 21, F 2...|$|R

Higher productivity of the <b>foreign</b> <b>firm</b> always increases host-country welfare if the reason for FDI is to save transportation costs but may reduce it if trade costs consist of tariffs. Thus, the present paper complements the recent literature on international trade that explores the effects of foreign firms' productivities on the incentives for FDI.
