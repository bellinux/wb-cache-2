40|$|Abstract: Research {{suggests}} that omega- 3 fatty acids (n- 3 FAs) {{play an important}} role in reducing the risk of heart diseases. The objectives of the current study were to investigate the consumption and the food sources of n- 3 FAs in two samples of elderly men living in different geographic locations (coastal and internal regions) of Saudi Arabia. Sixty men from each of the coastal and the internal regions provided a 24 -hour recall and 2 -day food record and a food frequency questionnaire. Food Processor Plus computer program software (ESHA Version 0. 7; Salem, Oregon, 2002) was used to analyze the dietary intake. The intake of total n- 3 FAs, alpha-lenolenic acid (ALA), eicosapentaenoic acid (EPA) and docosahexaenoic acid (DHA) were higher among the coastal region residents than among the internal residents (P < 0. 05). <b>English</b> <b>walnuts,</b> salmon, canola oil, malabar cavalla and king mackerel were the top five foods contributing to the n- 3 FA intakes in the coastal region. The top five foods contributing to the n- 3 FA intakes in the internal region were <b>English</b> <b>walnuts,</b> lamb, whole milk, baked beans and chicken. The food contributing the most to the intake of n- 3 FAs in both regions were <b>English</b> <b>walnuts.</b> In conclusion, the food consumption pattern for food providing n- 3 FAs differs by location and coastal residents consume more than twice as much n- 3 FAs as internal residents. Nutrition education intervention among internal residents is needed for increasing the consumption of n- 3 FAs...|$|R

50|$|The {{two most}} common major species of walnuts are grown for their seeds - the Persian or <b>English</b> <b>walnut</b> {{and the black}} walnut. The <b>English</b> <b>walnut</b> (J. regia) {{originated}} in Persia, and the black walnut (J. nigra) is native to eastern North America. The black walnut is of high flavor, but due to its hard shell and poor hulling characteristics it is not grown commercially for nut production. Numerous walnut cultivars have been developed commercially, which are nearly all hybrids of the <b>English</b> <b>walnut.</b>|$|E

40|$|<b>English</b> <b>walnuts</b> have {{recently}} been marketed for their cardiovascular benefits. These walnuts are related to those from the black walnut, an indigenous tree species of North America. Favorable changes in blood lipid profile with consumption of <b>English</b> <b>walnuts</b> have been the major focus of the proposed health benefits and {{have been attributed to}} the fatty acid content of the nuts. In contrast, black walnuts, which are harder to harvest and more expensive, have not been studied for their health benefits. The purpose of our research is to verify the fatty acid compositions of <b>English</b> versus black <b>walnuts</b> and compare how consumption of these nuts affects blood lipid levels. Thirty-six subjects (female= 20, male= 16), age 62 ± 12 years, were recruited and randomly assigned to either <b>English</b> or black <b>walnut</b> groups (18 subjects per group). Venous blood was collected for measurement of total cholesterol, low-density lipoprotein, high-density lipoprotein, and triglyceride levels following a 12 -hour fast before and immediately after 28 - 30 days of walnut consumption. Subjects consumed approximately 1 ounce of provided and pre-weighed nuts daily at the time and situation of their choice. They also reported usual food consumption and current medications and were weighed before and after the nut treatment. We verified the fatty acid composition of both walnut types by gas chromatography and both nut types had fatty acid profiles consistent with the USDA food and nutrient database. The fatty acid profiles of the two nuts varied significantly as expected. Despite the variations in nutrient content, both types of nuts had positive effects on blood lipid profiles...|$|R

This study evaluated the effects of dry roasting (132 or 180 °C for 5, 10, or 20 min) on the solubility and immunoreactivity of walnut proteins. A dramatic decrease in walnut protein solubility was observed following dry roasting at 180 °C for 20 min. However, both the soluble and insoluble protein fractions from roasted walnuts maintained substantial amounts of IgG immunoreactivity (using anti-raw and anti-roasted walnut antisera), with similar patterns of reactivity observed for human IgE from walnut-allergic individuals. Thus, walnut proteins are relatively stable under certain thermal processing conditions, and IgE reactivity remains present even when insoluble aggregates are formed...|$|R
