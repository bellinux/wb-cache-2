25|$|Lastly, the {{education}} system reinforced the bifurcation of Tutsi and Hutu ethnic identity. The Roman Catholic Church, the primary <b>educators</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> country, subscribed to the differences between Hutus and Tutsis by developing separate educational systems for each. Not surprisingly, in the 1940s and 1950s, {{the vast majority of}} students were Tutsis, even though the majority of Rwandans now self-identified as Hutus.|$|E
25|$|Much of Alon Shvut's {{growth has}} been tied to the {{presence}} of Yeshivat Har Etzion. In addition to the families of faculty, many of its students have made their homes in the town. The yeshiva, housed in a large, white building overlooking the valley, also attracts many English-speaking students from around the world. Its founders are considered of the more moderate <b>educators</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> Hesder Yeshiva program and have gained a reputation of tolerance and modernity for the institute. Alon Shvut rabbinical school encouraged the family of a yeshiva student killed in a Tel Aviv Hamas bus bombing incident to donate his organs, and a Palestinian girl was the recipient of his liver. The teachers are respected authorities on biblical commentary, traditional law and Jewish philosophy. Herzog College for Teachers is located in Alon Shvut. Tsomet Institute is a research institute based in Alon Shvut that seeks ways of reconciling Jewish law with modern technology to enable hospitals, police, fire departments, and the military to carry out their duties on Sabbath.|$|E

2500|$|R.W. [...] "Bill" [...] Swarthout was {{principal}} at Great Falls High from 1957 to 1983, providing a remarkable 26 years of stability at the school. In 2004, the Great Falls Tribune called him [...] "one {{of the most}} influential coaches and <b>educators</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> city's history." [...] His successor was assistant principal William Salonen, who led the school from 1983 to 1988. Karol K. Johnson, former dean of students at C.M. Russell High, held the principal position from 1988 to 1990. Johnson's successor was former boys' basketball coach and assistant principal Gary Davis, who held the top job from 1990 to 1999.|$|E
2500|$|From 1935 on, [...] "Tutsi", [...] "Hutu" [...] and [...] "Twa" [...] were {{indicated}} on identity cards. However, {{because of the}} existence of many wealthy Hutu who shared the financial (if not physical) stature of the Tutsi, the Belgians used an expedient method of classification {{based on the number of}} cattle a person owned. Anyone with ten or more cattle was considered a member of the Tutsi class. The Roman Catholic Church, the primary <b>educators</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> country, subscribed to and reinforced the differences between Hutu and Tutsi. They developed separate educational systems for each, although throughout the 1940s and 1950s the vast majority of students were Tutsi.|$|E
2500|$|In {{the mid-1960s}} Johnson began {{training}} <b>educators</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> use of cooperative, competitive, and individualistic learning. [...] While the theory existed and was validated, the procedures for structuring cooperation were largely unspecified. [...] Johnson developed such procedures for teachers, specifying {{three types of}} cooperative learning: [...] formal cooperative learning (students work together to achieve a joint learning goal for {{a major part of}} one class period to several weeks), informal cooperative learning (students work to achieve a joint learning goal in temporary, ad-hoc groups that last for a few minutes), and cooperative base groups (students work together to achieve joint goals in a long-term group lasting from a semester to several years).|$|E

2500|$|Sciences were {{expanding}} {{in colleges}} and universities, and scientists felt [...] "that students needed more and better preparation in secondary and primary schools". [...] Not only was the curriculum of schools evolving, but also was the system of education itself. [...] Populations were rising in big urban areas like New York and Chicago, and there was legislation to require students to spend required amounts of hours and days {{per year in the}} school system. [...] With a growing population due to immigration and other reasons, young people could be taught useful skills for life and academia in order to [...] "share fundamental civic values and enlarged view of their world". [...] The nature study became the way younger students learned of their natural world. [...] This also came at a time when legislation was being passed for conservation in the country, which helped gather support from parents and <b>educators</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> country.|$|E
2500|$|In 2007, some <b>educators</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> United States {{began to}} {{question}} the impact of rankings on the college admissions process, {{due in part to}} the 11 March 2007 The Washington Post article [...] "The Cost of Bucking College Rankings" [...] by Dr. Michele Tolela Myers, a former president of Sarah Lawrence College. As Sarah Lawrence College dropped its SAT test score submission requirement for its undergraduate applicants in 2003, thus joining the SAT optional movement for undergraduate admission, SLC does not have SAT data to send to U.S. News for its national survey. Of this decision, Myers states, [...] "We are a writing-intensive school, and the information produced by SAT scores added little to our ability to predict how a student would do at our college; it did, however, do much to bias admission in favor of those who could afford expensive coaching sessions." [...] At present, Sarah Lawrence is the only American college that completely disregards SAT scores in its admission process. [...] As a result of this policy, in the same The Washington Post article, Dr. Myers stated that she was informed by the U.S. News & World Report that if no SAT scores were submitted, U.S. News would [...] "make up a number" [...] to use in its magazines. She further argues that if SLC were to decide to stop sending all data to U.S. News & World Report, their ranking would be artificially decreased.|$|E
