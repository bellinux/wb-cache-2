25|$|Basic {{research}} on Corinthian pottery {{was accomplished by}} Humfry Payne, who in the 1930s made a first stylistic classification which is, in essence, being used {{up to the present}} time. He classified the vases according to shape, type of decoration and image subjects, and only afterward <b>did</b> <b>he</b> <b>make</b> distinctions as to painters and workshops. He followed Beazley’s method except for attributing less importance to allocating painters and groups since a chronological framework was more important for him. Jack L. Benson took on this allocation task in 1953 and distinguished 109 painters and groups. Last of all, Darrell A. Amyx summarized the research up to that point in his 1988 book Corinthian Vase-Painting of the Archaic Period. It is however a matter of scholarly dispute whether it is at all possible in the case of Corinthian pottery to attribute specific painters.|$|E
25|$|In January 2010, McKenzie joined English county side Hampshire as a Kolpak {{player for}} the 2010 County Championship. On 5 August 2011 McKenzie hit his career best {{first-class}} score of 237 in a County Championship match against Yorkshire. Not only <b>did</b> <b>he</b> <b>make</b> his highest score, but during his innings {{a number of}} records fell. Himself and Michael Carberry set a new Hampshire record for the 3rd wicket in first-class cricket, setting a partnership of 523 runs to surpass the previous best partnership for the 3rd wicket, which was set by George Brown and Phil Mead in 1927. The partnership with Carberry was also the highest for any wicket for Hampshire, surpassing the 411 set by Robert Poore and Teddy Wynyard in 1899. Their partnership was the 11th time in first-class cricket that a partnership has passed 500 runs, currently ranks 9th on the all time list.|$|E

25|$|Pelham was at Cambridge University {{for four}} years from the autumn of 1930, {{but for most of}} his student time there he was an {{irregular}} cricketer, seldom picked for the university side. In 1931, he played against the university for Sussex, and appeared in only one match for the university side, featuring in eight other Sussex matches across the season. The following year, 1932, he played only for the university team, and took five Essex wickets for 37 runs, the best bowling performance of his first-class career, in a match in May. But he was unable to retain his place in the team and did not win a Blue. In 1933, he was given only two matches by Cambridge, and {{after the end of the}} university season he played two matches for Somerset, for whom he was qualified by his birthplace; in none of these games <b>did</b> <b>he</b> <b>make</b> much impact.|$|E
25|$|Lomax was {{a regular}} member of the 1948 Lancashire Second Eleven which won the Minor Counties Championship, but though he took 19 wickets {{at an average of}} 16.94 his main task appears to have been to start the bowling before giving way to the spin trio of Roy Tattersall (66 wickets), Bob Berry (47) and Malcolm Hilton (42), all of whose wickets cost fewer than 12 runs apiece. In 1949, Lomax moved on into {{occasional}} first-team matches, opening the bowling in his first first-class game against Oxford University, when he bowled 23 overs in the match for 31 runs (and two wickets). There were six first-class matches in 1949, nine in 1950 and eight in 1951; in none of them did he manage to take more than three wickets in an innings and nor <b>did</b> <b>he</b> <b>make</b> significant runs. In 1951, in the match against Middlesex at Old Trafford, he made his first score of more than 50, with 52, and put on 103 for the seventh wicket with the schoolboy Colin Smith.|$|E
25|$|Robinson's father {{founded the}} {{successful}} Home Brewery in Daybrook, Arnold in 1875, later acquired Worksop Manor and was knighted in 1905; Sandford Robinson {{was sent to}} Harrow School {{and then he went}} to Trinity College, Cambridge. As a cricketer, he was a right-handed batsman and an occasional wicketkeeper, but neither at school nor at university <b>did</b> <b>he</b> <b>make</b> much impression: at Harrow he did not play in the grand set-piece cricket matches against the other major public schools, though he did appear in a 12-a-side match with the MCC in 1886. At Cambridge, he played in two trial games but was given only one chance in the first team: a match against the Gentlemen of England in which he opened the batting, scored 7 and 1, and took a catch in each innings. He did no better in a game for Nottinghamshire later in that season and in single matches in both 1889 and 1890 against Cambridge University – playing for an opposing team was a frequent ploy used by Cambridge when they wanted to try a cricketer out, but in Robinson's case it led to no further first-team appearances.|$|E

25|$|The Ottoman envoy's mission {{had been}} a godsend for the Bey. Not only <b>did</b> <b>he</b> <b>make</b> {{a show of force}} to deter the European powers, he also brought desperately-needed {{financial}} support in the amount of 0.5m francs in gold coin. At the same time the government was able to raise further funds by selling the coming olive harvest to European traders in advance, with Khaznadar once again profiting from the transaction. This allowed the Bey to re-recruit 2,000 zouaoua troops who had been dismissed from service by his predecessor Muhammad Bey for grave indiscipline. As they were Kabyles from Algeria, their loyalty could be relied on as they had no ties to the Arab tribal leaders of the rebellion. The Bey was also able to use some of this money to begin buying off some of the tribal leaders, and mistrust started to spread among the rebels. The fear grew that if the uprising continued, the country would end up being occupied by the French army. The rebellion began to falter. In the countryside, people wanted to return to their fields in time for the harvest; in the coastal towns, fear of brigandage by the nomadic tribes led by Ali Ben Ghedhahem made them wary of throwing their lot in with the insurgents of the interior.|$|E

2500|$|Bennett {{was born}} at Bruton, Somerset. [...] A {{right-handed}} middle-order batsman and an occasional right-arm medium pace bowler, Bennett {{was one of the}} more regular of Somerset's amateur batsmen in an era when the county could afford only half a dozen professional players. In 12 seasons, he played 109 matches for Somerset, turning out regularly in 1932 and 1934, and playing in around half the side's matches in three other seasons: 1933, 1937 and 1939. In no other season did he appear in more than three matches. Despite this regular cricket {{and the fact that he}} was played primarily as a batsman, Bennett was not a prolific scorer at any stage in his career: his career average was only 15 and his highest score was just 73. Only in 1934, when he made 735 runs at an average of 19.86, <b>did</b> <b>he</b> <b>make</b> more than two scores of more than 50 in any single season.|$|E

The physician was employed at Morecambe hospital until 1947, at which time he purchased a practice in Fulwood, Preston, Lancashire. He eventually developed the practice into a four-man partnership. Not only <b>did</b> <b>he</b> <b>make</b> house calls; Cooper performed small household tasks for his older patients. The physician was {{a founding member of the}} Royal Society of General Practitioners. In 1962-1963, he served a term as chairman of the British Medical Association.

When the Uganda was repurposed in Gibraltar in 1982 as a hospital ship for the Falklands War, Cooper opted to go to war again, at the age of 67. He was a Mason for more than sixty years and served as a judge for twelve years. In addition, he was active in several charitable organisations.

As critic Roger Ebert explains, [...] "Late Spring began a cycle of Ozu films about families... <b>Did</b> <b>he</b> <b>make</b> the same film again and again? Not at all. Late Spring and Early Summer are startlingly different. In the second, Noriko takes advantage of a conversational opening [...] to overturn the entire plot... she accepts a man [...] she has {{known for a long}} time—a widower with a child." [...] In contrast, [...] "what happens [...] at deeper levels is angry, passionate and—wrong, we feel, because the father and the daughter are forced to do something neither one of them wants to do, and the result will be resentment and unhappiness." [...] Ebert goes on, [...] "It is universally believed, just as in a Jane Austen novel, that a woman of a certain age is in want of a husband. Late Spring is a film about two people who desperately do not believe this, and about how they are undone by their tact, their concern for each other, and their need to make others comfortable by seeming to agree with them."

2500|$|Following {{his failure}} to take the Bar {{examinations}} and return to India, Ranjitsinhji's allowance was stopped by Vibhaji. Ranjitsinhji, owing money to many creditors in Cambridge who included personal friends, appealed to the British in India and Vibhaji was persuaded to advance a loan to cover Ranjitsinhji's expenses before his expected return to India. Simon Wilde [...] believes this incident encouraged a belief in Ranjitsinhji that someone else would always cover his debts. Even so, he was not called to the Bar in 1894, or at any point afterwards. Nor <b>did</b> <b>he</b> <b>make</b> any attempt to return to India, despite his assurances to Vibhaji. Instead, his developing friendship with Billy Murdoch and C. B. Fry led to Ranjitsinhji becoming interested in playing cricket for Sussex. Murdoch, the Sussex captain, wished to increase his team's playing strength. It is likely that, although he would play as an amateur, the club offered Ranjitsinhji a financial inducement, as was common for leading amateurs; given his monetary difficulties and unwillingness to return home, he was unlikely to refuse the offer. However, these arrangements came too late for Ranjitsinhji {{to play for the}} county in 1894, and his cricket that year was limited to matches for the Marylebone Cricket Club (MCC), festival games and benefit matches. Consequently, he could neither find any batting form nor build on his achievements of the previous year. Although struggling to bat against off spin in one game, he scored 94 while sharing a partnership of 200 runs with W. G. Grace in another. In eight first-class games, he scored 387 runs at an average of 32.25.|$|E
