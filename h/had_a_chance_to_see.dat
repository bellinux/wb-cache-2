25|$|Métraux {{thought at}} first that the London tablet was a forgery, due to the {{engraving}} being of the poor quality seen in modern carvings for tourists. However, after he <b>had</b> <b>a</b> <b>chance</b> <b>to</b> <b>see</b> it in person, and after Barthel declared it authentic, his 'skepticism was dispelled' (1957:184). The evidence is principally the paraphrasing rather than copying of text Gr, which would have required literacy in the script to accomplish.|$|E
25|$|Under the {{influence}} of his uncle, he joined the SPD and became active in the typographers' labor union in Mainz. He volunteered in the 1890 electoral campaign, {{which had to be}} organized in semi-clandestinity because of continuing government repression, helping the SPD candidate Franz Jöst retake the seat for the district Mainz-Oppenheim in the Reichstag. Because the seat was heavily contested, important SPD figures like August Bebel, Wilhelm Liebknecht, Georg von Vollmar, and Paul Singer visited the town to help Jöst and Rocker <b>had</b> <b>a</b> <b>chance</b> <b>to</b> <b>see</b> them speak.|$|E

2500|$|Chrétien was {{involved}} in a controversy again in November 1997, when the Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation summit was held on the University of British Columbia campus in Vancouver. The APEC summit was a meeting of many Asian and Pacific countries, and students on UBC's campus protested the meeting of some of these leaders because of their poor human rights practices. One of the leaders most criticized was then Indonesian President Suharto for killing at least 500,000 people when he came to power in a coup on September 30, 1965 and for waging a near-genocidal campaign in East Timor. Demonstrators tore down a barrier and were pepper-sprayed by the RCMP. Other peaceful demonstrators were subsequently pepper-sprayed as well. There was debate over whether the action was necessary. It was alleged that the initiative for the RCMP assault on the demonstrators was because of complaints from the President Suharto of Indonesia and President Jiang Zemin of China to the Canadian government about the demonstrators. The Indonesian and Chinese leaders both came from countries where demonstrators were routinely shot down by the government, and both found the demonstrators in Canada to be deeply upsetting, which led to pressure especially from Suharto on the Canadian government to silence the demonstrators. Suharto had made clear that his coming to Canada was dependent upon his [...] "dignity" [...] not being insulted by any demonstrators. In response to Suharto's concerns about his [...] "dignity" [...] being called into question by protests, he had been promised by the Canadian government that no protesters would be allowed to get close and in early August 1997 the RMCP was informed by the PMO that the Prime Minister did not wish for any [...] "distractions" [...] at the up-coming conference. During the protests, a First Nations leader claimed to have overheard Chrétien giving orders to the RCMP to remove the signs protesting against the human rights violations in China and Indonesia at once before Suharto or Jiang <b>had</b> <b>a</b> <b>chance</b> <b>to</b> <b>see</b> them.|$|E

60|$|On the {{way back}} to Stawell we <b>had</b> <b>a</b> <b>chance</b> <b>to</b> <b>see</b> a group of {{boulders}} called the Three Sisters--a curiosity oddly located; for it was upon high ground, with the land sloping away from it, and no height above it from whence the boulders could have rolled down. Relics of an early ice-drift, perhaps. They are noble boulders. One of them has the size and smoothness and plump sphericity of a balloon of the biggest pattern.|$|E

One summer's day he saw poor Anne Askew and three men burned at the stake in Smithfield, and heard an ex-Bishop preach a sermon to them which did not interest him.

6000|$|Filled {{with the}} {{impression}} of her hostess's agreeable interior, and of what her mother had told her about Miss Chancellor's wealth, her position in Boston society, Verena, in her fresh, diverted scrutiny of the surrounding objects, wondered {{what could be the}} need of this scheme of renunciation. Oh no, indeed, she hoped she wouldn't give up--at least not before she, Verena, had <b>had</b> <b>a</b> <b>chance</b> <b>to</b> <b>see.</b> She felt, however, that for the present there would be no answer for her save in the mere pressure of Miss Chancellor's eager nature, that intensity of emotion which made her suddenly exclaim, as if in a nervous ecstasy of anticipation, [...] "But we must wait! Why do we talk of this? We must wait! All will be right," [...] she added more calmly, with great sweetness.|$|E

There he was, down in the bedroom of Johnny Chuck's old house, smarting and aching all over from the sharp little lances of the Yellow Jackets who had driven him down there before he had <b>had</b> <b>a</b> <b>chance</b> <b>to</b> <b>see</b> what happened to Reddy Fox. That was bad enough, but what troubled Peter more was the thought that he couldn't get out without once again facing those hot-tempered Yellow Jackets.
