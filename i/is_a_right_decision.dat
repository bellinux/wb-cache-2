[...] İstanbul Technical University, Institute of Science and Technology, 2013 Her bireyin bir kimliği olduğu gibi, bireylerin oluşturduğu kentlerin de birer kimlikleri vardır. Kimlik kavramı canlı olan her organizmanın sahip olduğu, benzerliklerin ve farklılıkların ortaya çıkmasını sağlayan bir kavramdır. Dönüşüm uygulanan alanlarda yaşayan bireylerin kimlikleri olduğu gibi, içerisinde yaşadıkları kentin, bölgenin hatta mekanların da kimlikleri vardır. Dolayısıyla, kent içerisinde uzun yıllardan beri yer kaplayan yapıları yıkıp yeniden yapma eylemi, ilk olarak bireyleri, sonra bireylerin içerisinde yaşadıkları kenti etkilemektedir. Bursa kent merkezinde var olan Doğanbey, Tayakadın, Kiremitçi ve Kırcaali mahallelerinin, içerisinde bulunduğu fiziksel köhneme süreci göz önünde bulundurularak, yerel yönetimler tarafından verilen kararlar dahilinde dönüştürülmesini konu alan tez çalışması, uygulanan projenin, tamamlanmadan önce ve tamamlandıktan sonra bölgede ikamet eden bireyler ve kentin kimliği üzerindeki etkilerini açıklamakta, dönüşüm uygulamalarının uygulandıkları kentler üzerinde yarattıkları etkiyi ortaya çıkartmaya çalışmaktaıdr. Dönüşüm uygulanan dört mahalle, sosyal, fiziksel, ekonomik ve kültürel anlamda, belirli sınırlara sahiptir. Bu sınırlar içerisinde, iletişim en üst seviyede yaşanmakta ve Türk kültürünün en önemli faktörlerinden olan komşuluk kavramı daha da anlam kazanmaktadır. Bölge, fiziksel konum itibari ile ise, Bursa tarihi kent merkezine cephe olan, doku olarak, örüntü şeklinde gelişen yapıların oluşturduğu bir bölge olma özelliği taşımaktadır. Ayrıca bölge, fiziksel köhneleşme süreci içerisine girmiş fakat, alçak katlı yapılaşma sebebiyle Bursa silüeti üzerinde olumsuz etkisi olmayan bir bölgedir. Dönüşüm uygulamalarının en önemli kriterleri arasında olan, projelerin uygulandıkları bölgeye göre planlamaya sahip olmaları ve uygulandıkları bölgedeki kullanıcıların da sürece dahil olması bu proje açısından irdelenmiş ve projenin başarı oranı ortaya çıkartılmaya çalışılmıştır. Dönüşüm uygulanan dört mahallede yaşayan bireylerin, dönüşümden sonra hala bölgede yaşamaya devam edip etmedikleri, dönüşümden önceki yaşam tarzlarını sürdürüp sürdürmedikleri, projenin mevcutta yaşayan bireylere uygun planlanıp planlanmadığı ya da, projeye mevcutta yaşayanların sosyal zorluklar çekmemesi ve sosyal strese maruz kalmamaları için ne gibi eklentiler yapıldığı tez çalışmasının odak noktasını oluşturmaktadır. Ayrıca, dönüşümden sonra ortaya çıkabilecek sosyal sorunlar ve tarihi kent kimliğine sahip olan Bursa kentinin dokusunda, silüetinde ortaya çıkacak olan sorunlar tartışılmıştır. Pilot çalışmalar dahilinde oluşturulan anket soruları ile, bölgede dönüşümden önce yaşamış ve sonra yaşamaya devam eden bireyler ile anketler ve görüşmeler yapılmış ve proje konusundaki memnuniyet durumları ortaya çıkartılmıştır. The {{residential}} {{stock has}} begun to insufficient as labor class moved to cities with the industry revolution. Urban regeneration projects emerged {{in order to prevent}} unhealtful built environment. It is aimed to present more liveable environment to cities and people as well as finding solutions to current problems with the these projects. As all individual has an identity, cities that are constituted by individuals have it too. As a term,identity that all organism have it and reveals similiarities and differences between. Cities, districts and even spaces have an identity as well as individuals who lives at urban regeneration project areas. Thus, reconstruction of buildings which placed in a city for many years affects individuals primaryly then the city where people live in. This thesis aims to research the effects of the urban regeneration project (that is decided by local government with considering the physical corruption of the areas) on the dwellers who live before and after the project applied at the central districts of Bursa as Doganbey,Kiremitci and Kircaali and the effects on the identity of the city. These four districts have boundries in terms of social, physical, economical and cultural life. In this boundry, relations are being lived at the highest level and neighbourhood {{which is one of the}} most significant facts in Turkish culture has becoming more meaningful. More over, the mentioned districts located nearby the historical city center of Bursa and has a random pattern that buildings added in time. They are in a physical corruption process but they do not have an negative affect on the silhouette of Bursa because of its low-rise costruction. Bursa Doganbey urban regeneration project has placed nearby the historical caravanserai area. Therefore it should have more specific design criterias than a standart regeneration project. The history of the city center goes to establish of the Ottoman Empire. This shows, experiences of a city deepen as the history of the city goes back further. As the spent time in a city lenghten traces of citizens deepen too. Hence cities gain their identity by people, time and changing terms. The most significant criteria at regeneration projects is suitability of the concept to the users of the area. Because from the first appear of the notion, user satisfaction has became the most important fact for the success of projects. The sustainability of the dwellers who lives before the project and their happiness after the project applied are the crucial point for the achivement of projects. The happiness of citizens is essential for the peace of a city. When individuals become happy where they live in, they feel more belong to and reflect to places and spaces. After years where urban regeneration areas realized places has became desolate and lack of identity. İt should not be ignored that the reason for this is planning unsuited and irrelevant projects for users of areas. In the light of all these informations the Bursa Doğanbey urban regeneration project is researched and via the surveys and interviews with the initial and recent dwellers, the success rate of the project is tried to be examined. Bursa Doganbey regeneration project has changed the corrupted and 2 - 3 floored private masonry housed area to 22 - 23 floored apartmants area. This situation {{has begun to}} cause social stress for both the city and the citizens who lives there. Because the people who have strong interaction with streets are given to high-rise floors by lot thus their relation with streets is suspended. The people that live neighborhood in maximum level has suffered with moving to highrise bloks. Therefore it can be seen that, the old dwellers who continue to live after the project could not sustain their old lives. When individuals can not setup a correlation with places they can not reflect their identity to spaces. This situation cause loss of identitiy of spaces not in short term but in long term. Beside individuals, cities also affected from the applied regeneration projects. Because cities gain identity through citizens and their history. Cities begin to change identitiy when there is harm to these two fact. The urban project that is places nearby hıstorical city center should be planned as respecting to historical patterns and the effects of the rising noise, air and traffic pollution with this project should be minimized as much as can be. On the other hand Bursa Doganbey regeneration project aims to create over - loaded capacity density with high-rising buildings and without respecting to historical pattern. In the scope of the study, one of the most important criterias of regeneration projects; contribution of dwellers to the projects and unique planning according to characteristic of the area is examined and its success is evaluated. In the studied four districts where regeneration process applied, the changing of life-style for the dwellers, whether they still live there or not, suitablity of the project to the present dwellers and what kind of additions has been made to the project in order to prevent social difficulties and social stress are the main focal point of this research study. Consequently, possible social problems after the regeneration and negative effects of the new constructions on the historical city of Bursa silhouette and its pattern are discussed. In this situation,one of the most important values of the city of Bursa; historical pattern and silhouette is being affected in a negative way. In the scope of this thesis the effect and the impact of the urban regeneration project in the heart of historical city to city of Bursa is tried to be examined. By surveys that are prepared in the scope of pilot studies, interwiews are conducted with the dwellers who live before and after the regeneration and their satisfaction from the urban regeneration projects are revealed. The reason for dwellers to live in this area is the closeness to their works and it is in downtown. The dwellers own their properties as a heritage from their families or they are dwelling for low rents. Before the regeneration, the most disturbing fact is the old, corrupted and demolished structure of buildings for the people. Most of the dwellers live here since they born. Before the regeneration, even their houses was old, people say that they were happy because they were a owner of a house. Further more, they knew almost everbody in the neigbourhood and they were interacting with each other everyday. The users state that they were not shown any visuals about the project and the new constructions are too high therefore they are very anxious about the situation. But despite this they state that the regeneration project <b>is</b> <b>a</b> <b>right</b> <b>decision</b> for their area. They say they are happy about the project except its highrise constitution but they own a new flat. After the regeneration users indicate that they do not know anyone at the developments and lost their neighbourhood relationships. The users state that theywere living in a 1 - 2 floored garden house and moved to 22 - 23 floored apartments hence they could not sustain their prior life. When their opinion asked about the city they say the silhouette is not affected that much. In consequence, the public of the area was happy about their old life as well as the new situation after the urban regeneration project applied and they do not have any problem in accordance to the new environment. The people who live in the regeneration area, have two opposite ideas. First one is, the satisfaction before the regeneration project and the second one is the satisfacion after the regeneration project. They are glad from the two situations. This shows us, the outcomes of the regeneration project can be seen after all the dwellers move into the project area. Yüksek LisansM. Sc...|$|E

The objectives {{of this study}} were 1) to find out the kinds of speech acts employed in the speech 2) to explain the rhetorical arrangement in the speech. To support the analysis, a relevant contextual situation was also identified. This study applied a descriptive-qualitative method which seeks to identify a specific language phenomenon and provides a comprehensive analysis. The main data were all utterances asserted by President Roosevelt in ―Pearl Harbor Address to Nation‖ speech in the form speech acts. It was retrieved from video and transcript. To accomplish the first objective, the main data were analyzed under the speech acts theory by Searle. Meanwhile, the second objective was accomplished by employing a rhetorical arrangement theory of Cicero. The data were collected by watching the speech video, learning the transcript, categorising them in data sheets and conducting deep analyses. The key instrument of the research was the researcher. Hence, the trustworhiness of the data were ensured by keeping the credibility, dependability, and comformability. There were two kinds of research findings. The first one showed the speech acts in the form of illocutionary act in ―Pearl Harbor Address to Nation‖ speech. There were four categories of illocutions in the speech, which were representatives, directives, commisives, and expressives. However, declaratives did not appear. The totality of illocutionary acts occured in the speech was 91 times. It outnumbered the total sentences because each of those performed more than one speech act. It became the reason that the speech was highly effective. Among those illocutions, the act of persuading came as the most frequent illocution to be performed. The act of persuading was performed in every of his sentence, proving why the speech was extremely persuasive. He persuaded the Congress by convincing them about three things 1) the Pearl Harbor tragedy <b>was</b> <b>a</b> sudden attack, 2) Japan was evil and dangerous, 3) the declaration of war <b>was</b> <b>a</b> <b>right</b> <b>decision.</b> The distribution of the speech acts was also contributed to its persuasiveness. The second finding was about the rhetorical arrangement. Five out of six elements were found. The division became the only missing element. It was eliminated to make the speech more efficient. ―Statement of Fact‖ came as the most frequent element in the speech with 13 occurences, implying that facts had been important tools of persuasion for President Roosevelt. In the second rank, Proof (10 occurences) gave a logical explanation of the facts that previously stated. In conclusion, the speech <b>was</b> categorised as <b>a</b> highly persuasive and effective because the choice of expression to convey his intended meanings and logicallyappealing reasoning...|$|R

On the other hand, when referring to a pride experience in a specific context, designers seem to employ specific context-adapted design strategies, such as utilizing the positive relationship between personalized music and a patient with dementia, developing the employee’s perceptions of organizational reputation, and highlighting one’s contribution of <b>a</b> <b>right</b> <b>decision</b> to <b>an</b> organization.|$|R
