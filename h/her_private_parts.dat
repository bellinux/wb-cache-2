2500|$|In October 1934 Abe {{was arrested}} in a police raid on the {{unlicensed}} brothel at which she {{was working at the}} time. Kinnosuke Kasahara, a well-connected friend of the brothel owner, arranged for her release. He was attracted to Abe, finding that she had no debts, and with Abe's agreement, made her his mistress. Kasahara set up a house for Abe on December 20, 1934, and also provided her with an income. In his deposition to the police, he remembered, [...] "She was really strong, a real powerful one. Even though I am pretty jaded, she was enough to astound me. She wasn't satisfied unless we did it two, three, or four times a night. To her, it was unacceptable unless I had my hand on <b>her</b> <b>private</b> <b>parts</b> all night long... At first it was great, but after a couple of weeks I got a little exhausted." [...] When Abe suggested that Kasahara leave his wife to marry her, he refused. She then asked Kasahara to allow her to take another lover, which he also refused to do. Afterwards, their relationship ended, and to escape him Abe left for Nagoya. Kasahara ended his testimony with an angry remark about Abe, [...] "She is a slut and a whore. And as what she has done makes clear, she is a woman whom men should fear." [...] Likewise, Abe remembered Kasahara in less than flattering terms, saying, [...] "He didn't love me and treated me like an animal. He was the kind of scum who would then plead with me when I said that we should break up." ...|$|E

40|$|This {{report is}} about the {{description}} of <b>private</b> <b>parts</b> in Japanese mythology. Japanese mythology {{has a lot of}} stories about female <b>private</b> <b>parts.</b> The fi rst time this appeared is the scene when Izanami gave birth to Kagutsuchi who is the god of fi re. Due to this,Izanami’s <b>private</b> <b>part</b> is burned and dies. This is the origin of fi re story, Izanami is believed as mother goddess. There was faith that mother goddess gave birth to something valuable for humans in the ancient age. Originally, <b>private</b> <b>parts</b> relate to giving birth and living. However in this story, it relates to death as well as in O-getsuhime and Ukemochi stories described below. After the deaths of O-getsuhime and Ukemochi, grains grow from some parts of their corpses including their <b>private</b> <b>parts.</b> They are mother goddess and ancient people believed that mother goddess gave fertility after they were killed. We can see the same belief in Dogu and bowl in Jomon era, and in the background of Izanami’s story. In the story of Yamatototohimomosohime, female <b>private</b> <b>part</b> relate to death as well. Since Yamatototohimomosohime broke a taboo, she cannot get married to O-mononushi. In which she dies by getting a chopstick stabbed in <b>her</b> <b>private</b> <b>part.</b> There is a similar story in Ama-no-iwayado mythology also. It is a story of Hataorime, who dies due to her job tool shuttle stabbed in <b>her</b> <b>private</b> <b>part.</b> Yamatototohimomosohime’s death means retaliation and Hataorime’s death is what causes the story of Amaterasu to hide in the iwayado. Both deaths include negative elements, the deaths are not normal. Thus, when female <b>private</b> <b>parts</b> are broken, it symbolized a negative death for goddesses. This is because female <b>private</b> <b>parts</b> symbolize life itself and woman. Breaking female <b>private</b> <b>parts</b> means stopping life and negative death to denial woman. However, in the Ninuriya mythology, stabbing the <b>private</b> <b>part</b> causes birth. Due to a red arrow stabbing Seyadatarahime’s <b>private</b> <b>part,</b> she becomes pregnant. In this story, red arrow means male <b>private</b> <b>part,</b> and female <b>private</b> <b>part</b> relate to life. Since female <b>private</b> <b>part</b> relates to life originally, the story of stabbing female <b>private</b> <b>part</b> in which caused death was made paradoxically. Amenouzume’ s story {{is one of the most}} famous for female <b>private</b> <b>part</b> story. In the story, female <b>private</b> <b>part</b> has exorcism power, in which she exposes <b>her</b> <b>private</b> <b>part</b> to make the gods laugh. This then led to Amaterasu to come out from the iwayado. The female <b>private</b> <b>part</b> in this story means women’s holy power. However, in the background of the story the gods laugh at the female <b>private</b> <b>part</b> show, that there is male society and thought that men believed women’s holy power. On the other hand, there is no story about male <b>private</b> <b>parts.</b> Although, in the jomon era, Japanese ancient people made many stone fi gures that were shaped in male <b>private</b> <b>parts.</b> The male <b>private</b> <b>part</b> fi gure, Sekibo symbolized energy and god who can bless bad spirits. Male symbol was believed as a single existence, are independent from the male's body. It was not faith in men but in the <b>private</b> <b>part.</b> That is why there are no stories which god’s <b>private</b> <b>parts</b> were emphasized. However in the ancient times, there was no culture to make fi gures of female <b>private</b> <b>parts.</b> Dogu is famous for women’s body statue, but there are seldom representations of the <b>private</b> <b>parts.</b> Dogu has breasts and represents of pregnancy. It is bound for the faith of mother goddess. Due to this, the faith of mother goddess is from not the female <b>private</b> <b>parts,</b> but the mother goddess’s body. Though, it was believed that female <b>private</b> <b>parts</b> held holy power, the two beliefs had seemed to coexist. In order to show the coexistence, the classifi cation of “ideal woman” and “actual woman” that Kazuo Matsumura advocated was used. Amaterasu who is a virgin goddess is pure and clean, who represents the ideal woman. On the other hand, Izanami who experienced pregnancy, dead world, divorce represents an actual woman. These images were made by male society. Izanami gave birth by using female <b>private</b> <b>part</b> as an actual woman and not as mother goddess. The belief in mother goddess gives birth something valuable for human is in goddess body. Ukemochi and O-getsuhime mythologies are the origins of agriculture story. In these stories, female <b>private</b> <b>parts</b> appear,but there is no special meaning. They are mother goddess and give birth to something valuable, but there is no individual belief for female <b>private</b> <b>parts.</b> However people believed that <b>private</b> <b>parts</b> held holy power. In the ancient era, there was faith that women held holy power, in their female <b>private</b> <b>parts</b> which symbolized women. Then, Breaking the symbol of living and women, causes goddess’s negative death. Yamatotohimomosohime and Hataorime mythologies express this. Breaking <b>private</b> <b>parts</b> what are originally giving birth causes death. When they died a negative death, their <b>private</b> <b>parts,</b> which symbolized of women’s holy power, were broken. By doing so, this made a denial their dignity. On the other hand, Seyadatarahime’s Ninuriya story is simply about sex and birth. Sometimes people believed female <b>private</b> <b>parts</b> as use for reproduction, and it did not relate to faith in mother goddess and fertility. Izanami’s story is complexly structured. It is made from three elements, 1) primitive faith that mother goddess gave birth to god of fi re, 2) actual women who gave birth by using <b>her</b> female <b>private</b> <b>part,</b> 3) negative death by breaking the female <b>private</b> <b>part,</b> and it bound for uncleanness of death. Izanami gave birth as mother goddess, but the giving birth by using female <b>private</b> <b>part</b> is not derived from the personality of mother goddess. It is as an actual woman, and, the <b>private</b> <b>part</b> was a “device that is broke” to denial woman. Female <b>private</b> <b>parts</b> in Japanese mythology means symbol of living that is from the function, moreover, it means woman’s symbol. People believed that women’s holy power is in female <b>private</b> <b>parts.</b> Female and male <b>private</b> <b>parts</b> cannot be represented as a whole. This is due to the different beliefs in which the ancient people held...|$|R
