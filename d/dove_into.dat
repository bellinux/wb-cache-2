According to witness reports, Bleak rushed the trench and <b>dove</b> <b>into</b> it, tackling one Chinese soldier and, with only his hands, broke the soldier's neck, killing him. Bleak was then confronted by a second soldier, whom he reportedly grabbed by the neck, fatally crushing his windpipe. A third Chinese soldier then approached, and in the ensuing scuffle, Bleak used his combat knife to stab and kill the soldier.|$|E
5|$|The cook {{let go of}} the line.

5|$|That year, the Red Sox won an eventful season {{series against}} the Yankees. A 13-inning {{comeback}} win for the Yankees on July 1 was punctuated by a catch from Derek Jeter, who ran and <b>dove</b> <b>into</b> the stands at full speed and came out with facial lacerations when Trot Nixon hit a pop up in an area deep behind third base. On July 24, Jason Varitek shoved his glove {{into the face of}} the Yankees' Álex Rodríguez after Rodríguez was hit by a pitch from Bronson Arroyo, causing a bench-clearing brawl. Though he was ejected (along with Rodríguez) from the game following the incident, the moment sparked Boston to an 11–10 come-from-behind victory. Both Rodríguez and Varitek were each suspended four games and fined $2,000 for the brawl.|$|E

50|$|The African {{collared}} dove is the species {{thought to be}} the wild ancestor of the domestic Barbary dove, though some suggest the Eurasian {{collared dove}} (Streptopelia decaocto) may also have been involved. The African collared dove is able to hybridise with the Barbary dove, and it is thought that the increase in the range of colours of Barbary doves available that occurred in the later twentieth century {{was the result of the}} importation of African collared <b>doves</b> <b>into</b> the United States for interbreeding.|$|R
5|$|A {{weather station}} in Norfolk, Virginia {{recorded}} gusts of 3844mph (6171km/h) and 0.17inches (4.31mm) of rainfall. In Cape Henry, sustained winds of 42mph (68km/h) and a precipitation total of 0.02inches (0.5mm) were reported. Coastal sections of southeastern Virginia experienced tides 2.26.1feet (0.61.8m) above normal, resulting in minor tidal flooding. One indirect fatality was attributed from Gladys {{when a man}} suffered fatal wounds to his throat due to flying debris. High winds and strong ocean currents from Gladys produced beach erosion in New Jersey, New York and Massachusetts. In Rhode Island, the outer bands of Gladys produced light rainfall, peaking at 0.38inches (9.6mm). A boy was washed into the sea by the waves offshore Narragansett and was rescued by United States Coast Guard servicemen, who <b>dove</b> <b>into</b> the water after two previous attempts to rescue him failed.|$|E
5|$|The Ravens {{played the}} Patriots {{for the third}} {{consecutive}} season in the 2012 AFC championship game, which the Ravens lost 23–20. The rivalry reached a new level of friction with this, the second career playoff game between the two clubs. The Ravens clawed to a 20–16 lead in the fourth quarter, but Patriots quarterback Tom Brady <b>dove</b> <b>into</b> the end zone to make the score 23–20 with around 11 minutes remaining; this proved to be the winning touchdown. On the Ravens' last possession of the game, quarterback Joe Flacco threw a pass to wide receiver Lee Evans {{in the corner of the}} end zone which looked to be the game-winning touchdown, before a last-second strip by Sterling Moore forced the ball from the hands of Evans, forcing the game to be decided on a last-minute field goal by Ravens placekicker Billy Cundiff. With 11 seconds remaining on the clock, the kicker missed the 32-yard field goal attempt, allowing the Patriots to kill the clock on their way to Super Bowl XLVI for a rematch with the New York Giants.|$|E

He then spat the head out, with blood still dripping from his lips. Despite its controversy, the head-biting act has been parodied and alluded to several times throughout his career and is part of what made Osbourne famous.|$|R
25|$|It {{was found}} that {{grappling}} hooks were needed to climb the fort's walls, but despite this and stubborn resistance by the pirates, who defended themselves with rifles, grenades, spears and stones, the Spaniards managed to scale the walls and enter the fort. Some 25 pirates were killed inside, while another 30 or 40 <b>dove</b> <b>into</b> the water and were drowned or killed by the fire from the Spanish feluccas and armed boats. 14 artillery pieces were taken. The Spanish losses amounted to 5 regular soldier and two auxiliaries killed and about 50 wounded, including two colonels, José María Pañarada and Cayetano Figuera.|$|E
25|$|Priscilla Tirado was {{too weak}} to grab the line when the {{helicopter}} returned to her. A watching bystander, Congressional Budget Office assistant Lenny Skutnik, stripped off his coat and boots, and in short sleeves, <b>dove</b> <b>into</b> the icy water and swam out to successfully pull her to shore. The helicopter then proceeded to where Felch had fallen, and paramedic Gene Windsor stepped out onto the helicopter skid and grabbed her by the clothing to lift her onto the skid with him, bringing her to shore. When the helicopter crew returned for Williams, the wreckage he was strapped into had rolled slightly, submerging him—according to the coroner, Williams was the only passenger to die by drowning. His body and those of the other occupants were later recovered.|$|E
25|$|During {{the battle}} Aydrian {{displayed}} his gemstone power by bringing his father's decayed corpse back to life. However, {{as his father}} became whole he regained control of himself and with Pony they used a soul stone to attack their son's spirit, {{only to find the}} Demon Dactyl there. They fought the Demon as they had done so years before, on the day Elbryan had died, and again they destroyed it, freeing their son. Unfortunately, while the spiritual battle ensued, Aydrian was physically rendered frozen and had his heart pierced by Brynn Dharielle and died shortly after being freed from the demon. Pony used her soul stone and <b>dove</b> <b>into</b> it again, with Elbryan's help they brought Aydrian back to life as he had brought his father back. The strain was too great for Elbryan though, and he faded back into death again moments after.|$|E

25|$|First to {{the scene}} were 116 cadets under the {{direction}} of Lieutenant Commander H. J. Copeland from USS Nantucket, a training ship of the Massachusetts Nautical School (which is now the Massachusetts Maritime Academy), that was docked nearby at the playground pier. They ran several blocks toward the accident. They worked to keep the curious from {{getting in the way of}} the rescuers, while others entered into the knee-deep, sticky mess to pull out the survivors. Soon, the Boston Police, Red Cross, Army, and other Navy personnel arrived. Some nurses from the Red Cross <b>dove</b> <b>into</b> the molasses, while others tended to the injured, keeping them warm and keeping the exhausted workers fed. Many of these people worked through the night. The injured were so numerous that doctors and surgeons set up a makeshift hospital in a nearby building. Rescuers found it difficult to make their way through the syrup to help the victims. Four days elapsed before they stopped searching for victims; many of the dead were so glazed over in molasses, they were hard to recognize.|$|E
25|$|Merchant sailors {{were trained}} {{and used to}} man the {{anti-aircraft}} gun, it fired continually throughout the battle though it misfired a few times because of old ammunition. In fifteen minutes of fighting the Stanvac Calcutta was struck {{several times in the}} bridge and elsewhere, killing Captain Karlsson and a few other men. After hitting the Stier the guards manning the 4-inch gun were reported to have been encouraged and continued firing accurately until shrapnel damaged their weapon. The sights were destroyed but the Americans continued shooting until the ammunition on deck was exhausted. At this time Ensign Anderson ordered two men to retrieve more ammunition from below deck though as soon as they left, Captain Gerlach maneuvered his ship for a torpedo attack. When lined up, Stier fired one torpedo and it <b>dove</b> <b>into</b> the water and headed straight for Stanvac Calcutta where it detonated on the port side. Water began flowing in and the vessel started listing. A number of additional men were killed in the torpedo explosion and when {{it was clear that the}} American ship could not be saved, Ensign Anderson ordered the survivors to abandon ship and he began to lower life rafts.|$|E
25|$|In {{the second}} quarter, Nevada's only points {{came from a}} field goal. Texas Tech drove 68 yards on five plays and scored on a one-yard run by Shannon Woods. The key play was a 50-yard pass from Harrell to Michael Crabtree who ran {{it all the way}} to the one-yard line. On the next Nevada drive, {{defensive}} end Brandon Williams tipped a pass which landed in the hands of defensive tackle Richard Jones. Both teams went scoreless the rest of the half. Nevada received the kickoff to begin the second half and immediately drove the field. Nevada's quarterback Colin Kaepernick <b>dove</b> <b>into</b> the endzone in what appeared to be a touchdown. However, after a lengthy review, the officials agreed that Texas Tech's Daniel Charbonnet forced the ball out of Kaepernick's hands resulting in a touchback. The next Red Raider drive, Mike Leach decided to go for a first down on fourth down, which they failed to make again. Nevada's resulting drive stalled, but they were able to kick a field goal due to good field position after the failed fourth down attempt. The only other points in the third quarter came on Texas Tech's next drive of six plays and 39 yards, scoring on Eric Morris' 13-yard run giving the Red Raiders the lead, 21–12.|$|E

25|$|The Gators {{received}} the opening kickoff and ran {{it back to}} their own 25-yard line. After gaining four yards on three plays, Florida lined up to punt, {{but it was a}} fake and punter Bobby Joe Green ran 30 yards down to the LSU 41-yard line. The Gators went no further than that on three more plays and this time they did punt, pinning LSU at its seven-yard line. From there LSU went three-and-out and Cannon punted down to near midfield. After making it into the LSU red zone, a missed field goal by the Gators gave the ball to LSU at its own 20. Again LSU picked up no yards on three plays and punted. At this point Dietzel sent in the Chinese Bandits, who forced a fumble on their first play on the field and recovered it at the LSU 45. Rabb then led the Tigers down to Florida's 6-yard line as the quarter ended. On the first play of the second quarter Florida was penalized for being offside, giving LSU a first down on the one. The Gators held at the goal-line for three straight runs up the middle, but on fourth down Cannon <b>dove</b> <b>into</b> the endzone for the first score of the game.|$|E
25|$|Nick Saban {{returned}} to Tiger Stadium {{for the first}} time since his tenure as the Miami Dolphins head coach. Alabama entered the game as the No. 1 ranked team in all major polls, and defeated the LSU Tigers 27–21 in overtime. Alabama's offense quickly got the ball moving, as the team marched down to the LSU 26-yard line. John Parker Wilson passed to Earl Alexander, who proceeded to pick up 25-yards before fumbling out of the endzone, resulting in a touchback for the Tigers. On the first LSU possession, the Tigers ran three plays for a loss of seven yards before Alabama safety Rashad Johnson intercepted Jarrett Lee, returning it to the LSU 15-yard line. Glen Coffee moved the ball to the goal line, before John Parker Wilson <b>dove</b> <b>into</b> the endzone two plays later for a 7–0 lead. The Tigers came back to tie the game on their next drive as Jarrett Lee completed a 30-yard touchdown pass to Demetrius Byrd. On the ensuing kickoff, Alabama's Javier Arenas fumbled the ball, which was recovered by Josh Jasper at the Tide's 30-yard line. After a Lee incomplete pass, running back Charles Scott scored on a 30-yard rush, giving LSU a 14–7 lead. After both offenses slowed down, Alabama tied the game after Rashad Johnson intercepted a pass, and returned it for 54-yards and a touchdown to tie the score at 14–14 at the half.|$|E
25|$|Some {{while after}} this, the Doctor was {{captured}} by Marnal, {{one of the few}} surviving Gallifreyans, and accused of destroying Gallifrey. Although Gallifrey had been all but wiped from history by the Doctor's actions, Marnal was able to jury-rig a Time Space Visualiser to witness the Doctor actually push the button as he faced off against the Grandfather, although there were about three minutes between the Doctor firing the shot and Gallifrey's actual destruction where the Doctor's activities in the TARDIS were unaccounted for. Reflecting on his discoveries in the TARDIS, the Doctor, along with the aid of K9 (who had been transported into a hidden area of the TARDIS and trapped there following Gallifrey's destruction) realised that his memory loss hadn't been caused by the trauma of destroying Gallifrey; in fact, the Doctor had wiped his memories to give his mind space to store the contents of the Matrix within his brain, compressed down so he wouldn't be driven mad by the voices of all the dead Time Lords within him, his own memories presumably stored somewhere else in his mind, given his occasional flashes from his past. However, right then, the Doctor had more immediate worries; namely, saving Earth from a species of massive fly-like aliens called the Vore, who would soon have the power to devour the planet. As The Gallifrey Chronicles ended, the Doctor, Fitz, and Trix <b>dove</b> <b>into</b> the Vore mountain, the Doctor equipped with a plan to stop the Vore and save the world.|$|E
