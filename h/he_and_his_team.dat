FEFAP hoped to find artifacts and skeletal remains in order to use modern forensics to establish identities and causes of death among the lost 129.|$|E
50|$|Kauffman's {{experience}} was at disarming explosives; now <b>he</b> <b>and</b> <b>his</b> <b>teams</b> were {{learning to use}} them offensively. One innovation was to use 2.5 lb packs of tetryl placed into rubber tubes, thus making 20 lb lengths of explosive tubing that could be twisted around obstacles for demolition.|$|R

5|$|Martin {{attempted}} {{to qualify for}} his fourth Olympics appearance through the 2013 Canadian Olympic Curling Trials. In the round robin, <b>he</b> <b>and</b> <b>his</b> <b>team</b> played consistently and posted a 6–1 win-loss record, with their only loss coming to eventual champion Brad Jacobs.

At the World Cup of Curling, Martin finished the round robin with a 4–1 win-loss record, but missed {{a chance to win}} another Grand Slam title after he was edged past by John Epping, 3–4. He failed to make it into the playoffs at his next event, the Sun Life Classic. <b>He</b> <b>and</b> <b>his</b> <b>team</b> then competed in the Canada Cup of Curling, securing close wins over Glenn Howard and Jeff Stoughton in the round robin and finishing the round robin undefeated.

5|$|The ARC {{became the}} driving force behind the design and {{development}} of the oN-Line System (NLS). <b>He</b> <b>and</b> <b>his</b> <b>team</b> developed computer interface elements such as bitmapped screens, the mouse, hypertext, collaborative tools, and precursors to the graphical user interface. He conceived and developed many of his user interface ideas in the mid-1960s, long before the personal computer revolution, at a time when most computers were inaccessible to individuals who could only use computers through intermediaries (see batch processing), and when software tended to be written for vertical applications in proprietary systems.|$|E
50|$|He {{also worked}} with Henry Brem of the Johns Hopkins University Medical School on a drug-delivery system for the {{treatment}} of brain cancer, to deliver chemotherapy directly to a tumor site.

5|$|Cuarón {{wanted to}} do {{tracking}} shots, {{in part because the}} producers wanted to film it like an IMAX-style Discovery Channel documentary. Like his previous films, Emmanuel Lubezki did not use prior footage as the starting point of his work on Gravity. Instead, he carried out a search of images from NASA and Roscosmos. <b>He</b> <b>and</b> <b>his</b> <b>team</b> put together a large collection of photographs and picked what was best for the movie. Lubezki said that they based the visuals on descriptions from astronauts, with some artistic license in depicting how the stars looked during the daytime in space. He wanted to incorporate the stars as much as possible to feel as deep as possible and avoid plain darkness and two dimensional feeling.|$|E
5|$|Gilligan played cricket for Dulwich College {{before the}} First World War, then for Cambridge, twice winning his blue. He briefly played county cricket for Surrey but moved to Sussex in 1920. Following {{a slow start}} to his county career, he rapidly {{improved}} and in partnership with Maurice Tate established a formidable bowling reputation. First playing for England in 1922, he was appointed Test captain in 1924. In the latter year, Gilligan was {{at the height of}} his form when he suffered a blow to his heart while batting. The strain affected his bowling, which was never again as effective, but he still captained England in Australia during the 1924–25 season. The series was lost, but both <b>he</b> <b>and</b> <b>his</b> <b>team</b> were popular and respected. In following years, he played less frequently; he resigned as Sussex captain in 1929 and retired three years later. He subsequently became a writer, journalist and cricket commentator while maintaining his connections with Sussex.|$|E
5|$|During the 1986–87 season, the Broncos {{relocated}} to Swift Current, Saskatchewan, becoming the Swift Current Broncos. Sakic, {{playing in his}} first full season, was named Rookie of the Year of the WHL. He notched 60 goals and 73 assists for 133 points. But while Sakic enjoyed success on the ice, <b>he</b> <b>and</b> <b>his</b> <b>team</b> faced a tragedy {{on the night of}} December 30, 1986. The Broncos were driving to a game against the Regina Pats, and due to bad weather conditions, the bus crashed after the driver lost control on a patch of black ice outside of Swift Current. While Sakic was unharmed, four of his teammates (Trent Kresse, Scott Kruger, Chris Mantyka and Brent Ruff) were killed. This incident had a lasting impact on the young Sakic, who declined to talk about the crash throughout his career. The next year, in 1987–88, Sakic was named the WHL Most Valuable Player and Canadian Major Junior Player of the Year. He scored 160 points (78 goals, 82 assists), tying him with Theoren Fleury of the Moose Jaw Warriors for the WHL scoring title.|$|E

25|$|While an EEG based brain-computer {{interface}} has been pursued extensively {{by a number}} of research labs, recent advancements made by Bin <b>He</b> <b>and</b> <b>his</b> <b>team</b> at the University of Minnesota suggest the potential of an EEG based {{brain-computer interface}} to accomplish tasks close to invasive brain-computer interface. Using advanced functional neuroimaging including BOLD functional MRI and EEG source imaging, Bin He and co-workers identified the co-variation and co-localization of electrophysiological and hemodynamic signals induced by motor imagination.|$|E
