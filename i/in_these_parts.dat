5|$|Similar figurines {{of women}} with phallus heads from the Neolithic period have been found across Greece, Macedonia and parts of old Yugoslavia. The vast {{majority}} of the figurines of the Hamangia culture have cylindrical phallus-shaped heads without facial features, although some, particularly of the Aegean culture, had phallic sculptural pieces with phallic heads with a pinched nose and slitty eyes. <b>In</b> <b>these</b> <b>parts</b> of the ancient world, obelisk like structures resembling the human penis were built, often with phallic symbols, representing human fertility and asserting male sexuality and orgasm. Phallic symbolism was prevalent in the architecture of ancient Babylonia, and in Khametian iconography, the obelisk was considered to be symbolic of the phallus of the masculine earth. The obelisks of ancient Egypt themselves had several functions, existing both as a reference to the cultus of the sun and of the phallus, representing fertility and power.|$|E

25|$|Chicken {{stock is}} a liquid in which chicken bones and {{vegetables}} have been simmered {{for the purpose}} of serving as an ingredient in more complex dishes. Chicken stock is not usually served as is. Stock can be made with less palatable parts of the chicken, such as feet, necks or bones: the higher bone content <b>in</b> <b>these</b> <b>parts</b> contributes more gelatin to the liquid, making it a better base for sauces. Stock can be reboiled and reused as the basis for a new stock. Bouillon cubes or soup base are often used instead of chicken stock prepared from scratch.|$|E
25|$|Though {{the main}} vector (A. aegypti) also occurs in {{tropical}} and subtropical regions of Asia, the Pacific, and Australia, yellow fever has never occurred <b>in</b> <b>these</b> <b>parts</b> {{of the globe}} until the introduction of 11 cases by jet travel from an outbreak in Africa in 2016. Proposed explanations include {{the idea that the}} strains of the mosquito in the east are less able to transmit the yellow fever virus, that immunity is present in the populations because of other diseases caused by related viruses (for example, dengue), and that the disease was never introduced because the shipping trade was insufficient, but none is considered satisfactory. Another proposal is the absence of a slave trade to Asia on the scale of that to the Americas. The trans-Atlantic slave trade was probably the means of introduction into the Western Hemisphere from Africa.|$|E
25|$|Carabino {{is located}} in the {{northeast}} of the state. At this site items from and influenced by the city of Tula are found dating the city to about 900 to 1150CE. There is some evidence to suggest that the city was a colony of one of the cities of the center of Mexico. In Villa de Reyes in the far north in the Valley of San Luis, there also evidence of Toltec presence or influence. However, this later site was occupied first between 550 and 710 CE, then again in the Toltec era 200 to 300 years later. Evidence suggests that groups <b>in</b> <b>these</b> <b>parts</b> of Guanajuato had an effect on the organization of the Toltec Empire as settlements were abandoned sometime between 600 and 900CE. Through the Toltecs' influence in the Valley of Mexico, Guanajuato cultures eventually had some influence on the much later Aztec.|$|E

25|$|In Goa, India, {{which was}} a Portuguese colony until 1961, some Portuguese {{influences}} are still retained. A suburb of Margão, Goa's largest city, has a street named Rua de Saudades. It was aptly named because that very street has the Christian cemetery, the Hindu shmashana (cremation ground) and the Muslim qabrastan (cemetery). Most {{people living in the}} city of Margão who pass by this street would agree that the name of the street could not be any other, as they often think fond memories of a friend, loved one, or relative whose remains went past that road. The word saudade takes on a slightly different form in Portuguese-speaking Goan families for whom it implies the once-cherished but never-to-return days of glory of Goa as a prized possession of Portugal, a notion since then made redundant by the irrevocable cultural changes that occurred {{with the end of the}} Portuguese regime <b>in</b> <b>these</b> <b>parts.</b>|$|E
25|$|Although much of Calvin's {{work was}} in Geneva, his {{publications}} spread his ideas of a correctly Reformed church to {{many parts of}} Europe. In Switzerland, some cantons are still Reformed and some are Catholic. Calvinism became the theological system of the majority in Scotland (see John Knox), the Netherlands (see William Ames, T. J. Frelinghuysen and Wilhelmus à Brakel), some communities in Flanders, and parts of Germany (especially these adjacent to the Netherlands) in the Palatinate, Kassel and Lippe {{with the likes of}} Olevianus and his colleague Zacharias Ursinus. In Hungary and the then-independent Transylvania, Calvinism was a significant religion. In the 16th century, the Reformation gained many supporters in Eastern Hungary and Hungarian-populated regions in Transylvania. <b>In</b> <b>these</b> <b>parts,</b> the Reformed nobles protected the faith. Almost all Transylvanian dukes were Reformed. Today there are about 3.5 million Hungarian Reformed people worldwide. It was influential in France, Lithuania and Poland before being mostly erased due to the counter-reformational activities taken up by the monarch in each country. Calvinism gained some popularity in Scandinavia, especially Sweden, but was rejected in favor of Lutheranism after the Synod of Uppsala in 1593.|$|E

500|$|There are no {{permanent}} human {{settlements in the}} region, though it has {{a large number of}} defence personnel who man the borders on both sides. A small number of nomadic Tibetan graziers or Dokpas [...] herd yak, sheep and pashmina-type goats in the region. There has been intense grazing pressure due to domestic and wild herbivores on the land. Yaks are found <b>in</b> <b>these</b> <b>parts,</b> and in many hamlets they serve as beasts of burden. The region around Nathu La contains many endangered species, including Tibetan gazelle, snow leopard, Tibetan wolf, Tibetan snowcock, lammergeier, raven, golden eagle, and ruddy shelduck. Feral dogs are considered a major hazard in this region. The presence of landmines in the area causes casualties among yak, nayan, kiang, and Tibetan wolf.|$|E
500|$|The Codex Boreelianus {{is named}} after Johann Boreel (1577–1629), Dutch Ambassador at the Court of James I of England. There is no record of Boreel's obtaining the codex, but it is {{generally}} believed that he {{brought it to the}} Netherlands from one of his travels to the Middle East. The connection to Boreel is indicated by Wettstein, who was given a partial collation of the codex in 1730. The collation was made by Izaak Verburg, rector of the Amsterdam gymnasium, and contained text from Matthew 7:2 to Luke 11. Wettstein adds that he was not aware of its current location. Wettstein cited the codex in his Novum Testamentum Graecum (1751), also <b>in</b> <b>these</b> <b>parts,</b> which do not survive to the present day (e.g. Matthew 7:9).|$|E
500|$|In a [...] "complete" [...] spinal injury, all {{functions}} {{below the}} injured area are lost, {{whether or not}} the spinal cord is severed. [...] An [...] "incomplete" [...] spinal cord injury involves preservation of motor or sensory function below the level of injury in the spinal cord. [...] To be classed as incomplete, there must be some preservation of sensation or motion in the areas innervated by S4 to S5, e.g. voluntary external anal sphincter contraction. The nerves in this area are connected to the very lowest region of the spinal cord, and retaining sensation and function <b>in</b> <b>these</b> <b>parts</b> of the body indicates that the spinal cord is only partially damaged. [...] Incomplete injury by definition includes a phenomenon known as sacral sparing: some degree of sensation is preserved in the sacral dermatomes, even though sensation may be more impaired in other, higher dermatomes below the level of the lesion. Sacral sparing has been attributed {{to the fact that the}} sacral spinal pathways are not as likely as the other spinal pathways to become compressed after injury due to the lamination of fibers within the spinal cord.|$|E

500|$|The {{ultimate}} goal of the Gleichschaltung policy pursued <b>in</b> <b>these</b> <b>parts</b> of occupied Europe was to destroy the very concepts of individual states and nationalities, just as {{the concept of a}} separate Austrian state and national identity was repressed after the Anschluss through the establishment of new state and party districts. The new empire was to no longer be a nation-state of the type that had emerged in the 19th century, but instead a [...] "racially pure community". It {{is for this reason that}} the German occupiers had no interest in transferring real power to the various far-right nationalist movements present in the occupied countries (such as Nasjonal Samling, the NSB, etc.) except for temporary reasons of Realpolitik, and instead actively supported radical collaborators who favored pan-Germanic unity (i.e. total integration to Germany) over provincial nationalism (for example DeVlag). Unlike Austria and the Sudetenland however, the process was to take considerably longer. Eventually these nationalities were to be merged with the Germans into a single ruling race, but Hitler stated that this prospect lay [...] "a hundred or so years" [...] in the future. During this interim period it was intended that the 'New Europe' would by run by Germans alone. According to Speer, while Himmler intended to eventually Germanize these peoples completely, Hitler intended not to [...] "infringe on their individuality" [...] (that is, their native languages), so that in the future they would [...] "add to the diversity and dynamism" [...] of his empire. The German language would be its lingua franca however, likening it to the status of English in the British Commonwealth.|$|E
