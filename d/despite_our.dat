In a word, <b>despite</b> <b>our</b> different musical identities, it would seem we are following a single path; and I, for my part, am proud to have such a fellow traveler.... Lyadov and Glazunov are also numbered among my opponents, yet I sincerely love and value their talent.|$|E
500|$|The lead single [...] "Straight Out of Line" [...] {{received}} a Grammy Award nomination for [...] "Best Hard Rock Performance". The award went to Evanescence's single [...] "Bring Me to Life". The album {{got its name}} after a swimming-pool incident. However, in a later interview Merrill stated otherwise, making it unclear of how the album's title came to be, [...] "It came from the band's feeling that, <b>despite</b> <b>our</b> radio and sales success, we still flew a bit under the radar".|$|E
500|$|General William Westmoreland, {{who was the}} U.S. Army {{commander}} in South Vietnam, Taylor, and other senior U.S. officers in Saigon and Washington, D.C. urged President Lyndon B.

Taylor messaged Washington on Christmas Day, saying, [...] "Hanoi will get the word that, <b>despite</b> <b>our</b> present tribulations, there is still bite in the tiger they call paper, and the U.S. stock {{in this part of}} the world will take sharp rise. Some of our local squabbles will probably disappear in enthusiasm which our action would generate." [...] Taylor recommended that the US take unilateral action, citing the animosity between himself and Khanh's junta.|$|E

500|$|The Society for the Protection of Ancient Buildings (SPAB) {{raised the}} alarm in a 2009 edition of its magazine, Cornerstone, {{in which the}} deteriorating {{condition}} of the barn was highlighted as the magazine's cover story. The magazine reported that {{on a recent visit}} [...] "more than a dozen gaps in the tiled roof were seen, some large. The site appeared to lack fire-fighting equipment or alarms, and could be easily accessed. Plants have taken root in the stone-and-brick plinth, and have begun to damage the medieval blocks upon which the barn stands." [...] English Heritage issued a statement saying: [...] "The absentee owner of the barn has declined to engage with English Heritage (and the local authority) for some years <b>despite</b> <b>our</b> offers of help, support, advice and grants. It {{should be noted that the}} Heathrow expansion area would surround the site of the barn on three sides but would not, according to plans we have seen, propose its demolition or removal. However, this still leaves question marks over the barn’s future and in particular, the issues of viability and setting." ...|$|E

2500|$|Critics of Thomson's {{argument}} generally {{grant the}} permissibility of unplugging the violinist, but seek {{to block the}} inference that abortion is permissible by arguing that there are morally relevant differences between the violinist scenario and typical cases of abortion.

2500|$|In November 2001, {{six months}} after the album's release, Skunkhour disbanded, {{frustrated}} by a lack of support from Universal, which was experiencing upheavals in Australia. Aya told Ritchie Yorke of The Sunday Mail that the difficulties with the label meant the band was unable to maximise its opportunities. He said: [...] "We decided that we'd rather move on now and look at some other possibilities while we're still drawing big crowds ... Unfortunately, the last album was only heard on Triple J and some community stations, so we didn't really reach the mainstream with it. This was <b>despite</b> <b>our</b> hopes that the album might have taken us to another level. It was given great reviews and we really thought the music got us back in touch with the fans. But overall, we just wanted {{to go out on a}} high. We didn't want to overstay our welcome".|$|E
2500|$|The Population Bomb {{was written}} at the {{suggestion}} of David Brower {{the executive director of the}} environmentalist Sierra Club, and Ian Ballantine of Ballantine Books following various public appearances Ehrlich had made regarding population issues and their relation to the environment. Although the Ehrlichs collaborated on the book, the publisher insisted that a single author be credited, and also asked to change their preferred title: Population, Resources, and Environment. The title Population Bomb was taken (with permission) from General William H. Draper, founder of the Population Crisis Committee and a pamphlet issued in 1954 by the Hugh Moore Fund. The Ehrlichs regret the choice of title, which they admit was a perfect choice from a marketing perspective, but think that [...] "it led Paul to be miscategorized as solely focused on human numbers, <b>despite</b> <b>our</b> interest in all the factors affecting the human trajectory." ...|$|E

[...] Armageddon feels like a mature, universal pop album that would appeal to young and old, broken and fulfilled alike." [...] In earlier reviews for the singles he said [...] "Don't Worry Be Happy" [...] was [...] "feel good, sun-soaked and universally appealing", and described Battle Scars as a [...] "massive bruised ballad with a titan hook that just beats you down with no mercy." [...] Lim wrote of [...] "Get Along", [...] "The emotive political ballad 'Get Along' is possibly the best single Sebastian has ever released. I just can't get over how great his observant lyrics about religious wars are. The hook - 'Dear God, dear soul, dear Mary, Mohammed... can we all just get along?' - absolutely rips right through the heart. Music site auspOp gave positive reviews for all the released singles. They said [...] "Don't Worry Be Happy" [...] was [...] "bright as sunshine" [...] and of [...] "Gold" [...] they wrote, [...] "This new tune is precisely what Guy does best - oozing with class and old school soul. 'Gold' sounds like it could have been ripped straight from the streets of 1960s Detroit, what with its flashy brass, gorgeous gospel chorus and Guy's insane pitch-perfect vocal. They named [...] "Battle Scars" [...] {{as one of the best}} singles of the year, with [...] "stunning, crystal-clear, pitch-perfect vocals" [...] calling it [...] "superb home-grown pop". In a review for [...] "Get Along" [...] they wrote, [...] "This one is designed to get you thinking. To tap into your emotions. 'Get Along' is a song about hope, peace and understanding and a dream that perhaps one day we'll all be united, together as one people, one world, <b>despite</b> <b>our</b> differences in opinion, religion, creed and race.
