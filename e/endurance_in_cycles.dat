40|$|PURPOSE: To {{quantify}} the capillaries in the skeletal muscular tissue of mice with induced peripheral arterial insufficiency, after endurance training. METHOD: It was used Wistar mice in 70 days age range, {{subjected to the}} total occlusion of right femoral artery. The animals {{were divided into two}} groups: sedentary group (SG; n = 05), subjected to activities in the cage; and trained group (TG; n = 05), subjected to an <b>endurance</b> training <b>in</b> <b>cycle</b> ergometer twice a day 17 m/min, by 5 minutes, 5 days per week during 10 weeks. The analysis was realized by the histologic observation of the vastus medialis muscle of injured member. RESULTS: The average number of capillaries in the muscular tissue was greater in TG (5, 2 ± 0, 83) than in SG (1, 6 ± 1, 14) (p < 0, 05). CONCLUSION: In animals with induction of peripheral arterial insufficiency, the endurance training provides a process of muscular adaptation which is observed by {{the increase in the number}} of capillaries of animals subjected to this kind of training...|$|R

40|$|The {{purpose of}} this study was to {{summarize}} the evidence regarding muscle strength and <b>endurance</b> <b>in</b> peripheral arterial disease (PAD) subjects. Systematic review of original articles in MEDLINE, LILACS and SciELO databases, by the year 2009 was performed. Most of studies which compared strength of the leg or hip/thigh of PAD subjects and control subjects reported lower muscle strength in PAD subjects. Most of the studies which compared muscular strength between limbs in individuals with unilateral PAD (diseased and non-diseased limb) reported lower leg strength in the diseased limb. The studies which compared muscular endurance between individuals with PAD and control subjects reported lower muscular <b>endurance</b> <b>in</b> subjects with PAD. Moreover, the studies which compared muscular <b>endurance</b> between limbs <b>in</b> individuals with unilateral PAD reported lower muscular <b>endurance</b> <b>in</b> the affected limb. The summary of the evidences indicates that subjects with PAD had lower levels of strength and endurance than control subjects. Furthermore, even in patients who had unilateral PAD, muscle strength and <b>endurance</b> were reduced <b>in</b> the leg affected by the disease. © FTCD/FIP-MOC. Language: Portugues...|$|R

40|$|Background: The {{complications}} {{associated with}} type 2 Diabetes Mellitus (DM) may cause functional impairment in older people. Recently {{it has been}} proved that motor dysfunction {{in the form of}} skeletal muscle dysfunction does occur in type II DM. However very few studies have assessed the upper limb skeletal muscle dysfunction. Objectives: The study was aimed to assess the hand grip strength, <b>endurance</b> <b>in</b> type 2 DM patients and compare the same with age matched healthy controls. We also correlated glycosylated Hb and duration of illness with the hand grip strength and <b>endurance</b> <b>in</b> the patients. Materials and Methods: Hand grip dynamometer was used to measure the hand grip strength and <b>endurance</b> <b>in</b> sixty diagnosed patients of type II DM. Similar tests were performed in age matched healthy controls. Blood samples were collected for blood glucose fasting, postprandial levels and Hb 1 AC in both the groups. Comparisons between patients and controls, and correlations were done by applying suitable tests. Results: The hand grip muscle strength and <b>endurance</b> <b>in</b> type II DM patients were significantly lower as compared to the normal controls (P 0. 05). Conclusions: The present study shows that type II DM patients suffer from skeletal muscle dysfunction in the form of reduced hand grip strength and endurance. Hence the treating Physician should not be ignorant about these disabilities. In addition to the strict measures to control the blood glucose levels, interventions to improve the muscle mass and strength in these patients should be undertaken...|$|R
50|$|Endurance {{training}} is {{the act of}} exercising to increase endurance. The term endurance training generally refers to training the aerobic system {{as opposed to the}} anaerobic system. The need for <b>endurance</b> <b>in</b> sports is often predicated as the need of cardiovascular and simple muscular endurance, but the issue of endurance is far more complex. Endurance can be divided into two categories including: general endurance and specific endurance. It can be shown that <b>endurance</b> <b>in</b> sport is closely tied to the execution of skill and technique. A well conditioned athlete can be defined as, the athlete who executes his or her technique consistently and effectively with the least effort.|$|R
