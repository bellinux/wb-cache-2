40|$|A novel {{method for}} {{measuring}} <b>heat</b> <b>flux</b> {{of boiling water}} is designed and built to study critical <b>heat</b> <b>flux</b> (CHF) and observe the response of a <b>heat</b> <b>flux</b> sensor when CHF occurs. A high temperature <b>heat</b> <b>flux</b> sensor {{is embedded in the}} wall of a pipe to get a direct measurement of the surface <b>heat</b> <b>flux</b> and sensor temperature. By submerging the pipe in water and applying a controlled <b>heat</b> <b>flux</b> to the inside diameter over the area where the sensor is located, boiling is created on the outer surface while measuring the <b>heat</b> <b>flux.</b> The <b>heat</b> <b>flux</b> is gradually increased up to CHF and the <b>heat</b> <b>flux</b> response is observed to determine if the <b>heat</b> <b>flux</b> sensor could sense CHF when it occurred.

40|$|Increasing the {{economic}} competitiveness {{of nuclear energy}} is vital to its future. Improving {{the economic}}s of BWRs is the main goal of this work, focusing on designing cores with higher power density, to reduce the BWR capital cost. Generally, the core power density in BWRs {{is limited by the}} thermal Critical Power of its assemblies, below which heat removal can be accomplished with low fuel and cladding temperatures. The present study investigates both increases in the heat transfer area between the fuel and coolant and changes in operating parameters to achieve higher power levels while meeting the appropriate thermal as well as materials and neutronic constraints. A scoping study is conducted under the constraints of using fuel with cylindrical geometry, traditional materials and enrichments below 5 % to enhance its licensability. The reactor vessel diameter is limited to the largest proposed thus far. The BWR with High power Density (BWR-HD) is found to have a power level of 5000 MWth, equivalent to 26 % uprated ABWR, resulting into 20 % cheaper O&M and Capital costs. This is achieved by utilizing the same number of assemblies, but with wider 16 x 1 6 assemblies and 50 % shorter active fuel than that of the ABWR. The fuel rod diameter and pitch are reduced to just over 45 % of the ABWR values. Traditional cruciform form control rods are used, which restricts the assembly span to less than 1. 2 times the current GE 14 design due to limitation on shutdown margin. Thus, it is possible to increase the power density and specific power by 65 %, while maintaining the nominal ABWR Minimum Critical Power Ratio (MCPR) margin. The optimum core pressure {{is the same as the}} current 7. 1 MPa. The core exit quality is increased to 19 % from the ABWR nominal exit quality of 15 %. The pin linear heat generation rate is 20 % lower, and the core pressure drop and mass of uranium are 30 % lower. The BWR-HD's fuel, modelled with FRAPCON 3. 4, showed similar performance to the ABWR pin design. The fuel cycle is only 12 month long, but on the per kWhr, the new design operates with 14 % lower fuel cycle front-end costs and similar total fuel cycle cost to the 18 month ABWR fuel cycle. The plant systems outside the vessel are assumed to be the same as the ABWR- 1 I design, utilizing a combination of active and passive safety systems. Safety analyses applied a void reactivity coefficient calculated by SIMULATE- 3 for an equilibrium cycle core that showed a 15 % less negative coefficient for the BWR-HD compared to the ABWR. The feedwater temperature was kept the same for the BWR-HD and ABWR which resulted in 4 °K cooler core inlet temperature for the BWR-HD given that its feedwater makes up a larger fraction of total core flow. The stability analysis using the STAB and S 3 K codes showed satisfactory results for the hot channel, coupled regional out-of-phase and coupled core-wide in-phase modes. A RELAP 5 model of the ABWR system was constructed and applied to six transients for the BWR-HD and ABWR. The AMCPRs during all the transients were found to be equal or less for the new design and the core remained covered for both. The lower void coefficient along with smaller core volume proved to be advantages for the simulated transients. Helical Cruciform Fuel (HCF) rods were proposed in prior MIT studies to enhance the fuel surface to volume ratio. In this work, higher fidelity models (e. g. CFD instead of subchannel methods for the hydraulic behaviour) are used to investigate the resolution needed for accurate assessment of the HCF design. For neutronics, conserving the fuel area of cylindrical rods results in a different reactivity level with a lower void coefficient for the HCF design. In single-phase flow, for which experimental results existed, the friction factor is found to be sensitive to HCF geometry and cannot be calculated using current empirical models. A new approach for analysis of flow crisis conditions for HCF rods in the context of Departure from Nucleate Boiling (DNB) and dryout using the two phase interface tracking method was proposed and initial results are presented. It is shown that the twist of the HCF rods promotes detachment of a vapour bubble along the elbows which indicates no possibility for an early DNB for the HCF rods and in fact a potential for a higher <b>DNB</b> <b>heat</b> <b>flux.</b> Under annular flow conditions, it was found that the twist suppressed the liquid film thickness on the HCF rods, at the locations of the highest heat flux, which increases the possibility of reaching early dryout. It was also shown that modeling the 3 D heat and stress distribution in the HCF rods is necessary for accurate steady state and transient analyses. The safety analysis of the 20 % uprated HCF design in the context of a BWR/ 4 RPV showed satisfactory AMCHFR performance only if CR is estimated by the EPRI- 1 correlation. by Koroush Shirvan.

40|$|Surface {{energy balance}} is an {{important}} tool for sustainable water management and for estimating crop evapotranspiration. Net radiation is converted to latent <b>heat</b> <b>flux,</b> sensible <b>heat</b> <b>flux,</b> and soil <b>heat</b> <b>flux</b> at {{the surface of the}} earth. The soil <b>heat</b> <b>flux</b> component is challenging to determine because of the high degree of variation in soil moisture and temperature within the soil profile. Surface soil <b>heat</b> <b>flux</b> may be approximated using atmospheric and solar data but is more readily determined using soil <b>heat</b> <b>flux</b> measurements, which are typically made at a reference soil depth of 8 cm. However, the surface soil <b>heat</b> <b>flux</b> occurring at any moment in time is actually not measured at the reference depth until some time later because of the travel time for that heat to reach the <b>heat</b> <b>flux</b> plate 8 cm below. This means there is generally a time lag in the soil <b>heat</b> <b>flux</b> measurement relative to the atmospheric measurements. Consideration of the time lag between the soil surface and the sub-surface could improve the accuracy of energy balance calculations. Accurate soil surface <b>heat</b> <b>flux</b> estimation is crucial for modeling of energy and water-related processes as well as for validating sensor-based ET measurement techniques. Numerical models have been developed to simulate both soil-heat and -water dynamics.

As for the lawn surface, the underground <b>heat</b> <b>flux,</b> convective <b>heat</b> <b>flux</b> to air and latent <b>heat</b> <b>flux</b> are 35 %, 15 % and 50 % of net radiation, respectively...|$|R
40|$|<b>Heat</b> <b>flux</b> {{measurement}} {{is important}} for dynamic thermal management (DTM) since it can provide more predicted information. Commercial <b>heat</b> <b>flux</b> sensors are too expensive and fragile for practical applications. Thermoelectric Cooler (TEC) based DTM provides the possibility of measuring the <b>heat</b> <b>flux</b> without additional <b>heat</b> <b>flux</b> sensor. Soft measurement of TEC <b>heat</b> <b>flux</b> has been presented via Neural Network (NN), which is suitable for identifying TEC model. NN models have been proposed by combing the classical TEC model together. The soft measurement performances with different NN models have been reported and analyzed in terms of accuracy, efficiency, and generalization capability. ...|$|R

40|$|Initial {{transient}} thermal {{models have}} been developed to simulate a <b>heat</b> <b>flux</b> gage calibration process capable of generating high <b>heat</b> <b>flux</b> levels of interest to reciprocating and gas turbine engine industries as well as the aerospace industry. These transient models are based on existing, experimentally validated, steady state models of the cylindrical blackbody calibration system. The steady state models were modified to include insertion of a <b>heat</b> <b>flux</b> gage into the hot zone of the calibration system and time varying electrical current passing through the resistance <b>heated</b> blackbody. <b>Heat</b> <b>fluxes</b> computed using the initial transient models were compared to experimental measurements. The calculated and measured transient <b>heat</b> <b>fluxes</b> were within 5 % indicating that the major physical phenomena in the transient calibration had been captured by the models. The predicted and measured transient <b>heat</b> <b>fluxes</b> were also compared at two different gage insertion depths. These results indicated that there is an optimum insertion position which maximizes <b>heat</b> <b>flux</b> and minimizes cavity disturbance...|$|R
