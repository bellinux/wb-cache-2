A {{surface of a}} <b>fluorocarbon</b> <b>polymer</b> is exposed to a beam of ions to texture it.

40|$|Amorphous <b>fluorocarbon</b> <b>polymers</b> are {{attractive}} materials for optical applications {{because of their}} high transparency at wavelengths up to 3 mu m due {{to the absence of}} C-H bonds. DuPont's amorphous fluoropolymer Teflon AF has been available since 1989, and Teflon AF films can be fabricated by spin, spray, or dip coating from solution or by use of compression or injection moulding from the melt. An alternative and promising route for processing fluorocarbon films is the use of a low-pressure plasma. This technique can be employed for plasma polymerization of suitable fluorocarbon monomers and for controlled etching of fluorocarbon materials. In the present work, we present the characteristics of plasma-polymerized tetrafluoroethylene layers with a refractive index of approximately 1. 4. Reactive ion etching in an N 2 O plasma is used for patterning these layers, and also the spin-coated Teflon AF films with a refractive index of around 1. 3.

40|$|A <b>fluorocarbon</b> <b>polymer</b> {{generated}} by plasma polymerization of CF 4 /CH 2 F 2 {{used as a}} model polymer for sidewall residues was subjected to ultraviolet (UV) irradiation (λ = 254 nm). Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy and X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy indicated that the as-deposited <b>fluorocarbon</b> <b>polymer</b> mainly contains CF, CF 2, and a small concentration of unsaturated, fluorinated C=C bonds, and carbonyl functionalities. A partial removal of the polymer occurred during UV irradiation in oxygen. Experimental results showed that UV irradiation resulted in a slight decrease in fluorine content concomitant {{with the formation of}} carbonyl groups. The presence of reactive species such as oxygen during UV treatment (by production of singlet oxygen and radicals) was necessary to allow bond cleavage and an increase of hydrophilicity of the polymer fragments thus making the removal of the polymer possible in a subsequent wet clean. In terms of polymer bonding structure, the presence of C=C bonds and oxygen in the polymer backbone, in particular of C-O bonds, was crucial for light absorption at the wavelength used and {{played a key role in}} the bond scissioning process. Quantum chemical calculation was also performed to support the experimental results...|$|E

30|$|Oleophobol CPR {{finished}} cotton {{retained its}} tensile strength with only 10 - 15 (%) loss. There was no loss in its tear strength rather it showed slight improvement.

40|$|MEMS (micro-electro-mechanical system) {{technology}} is an established field, which {{makes use of}} the advanced state of silicon processing to fabricate complex electro-mechanical structures and devices. Microoptics is a new, but advanced technology {{within the field of}} optics. Also within the microoptics field fabrication techniques from the microelectronics industry are frequently used and it seems natural to proceed to merge these two technologies to build so called MOEMS (micro-opto-electro-mechanical system). The efforts to develop and produce MOEMS have rapidly intensified in recent years, and some commercial applications can already be found. We have developed new fabrication processes based on the use of an amorphous <b>fluorocarbon</b> <b>polymer,</b> Cytop&# 61652;, for making microoptical diffractive elements and refractive lenses for integration in MEMS structures. The processing scheme we use is a reversed order protocol, meaning that the structuring of the lenses precedes the silicon microstructuring, where we introduce new processing steps and non-standard materials. The new processing steps and materials we introduce are all compatible with established silicon processing. The fabrication process for integration of diffractive optical elements makes use of hot embossing replication and was developed using two different diffractive optical structures  a small-feature, high-aspect ratio Fresnel lens and a fan-out diffractive element. The fabrication process for refractive (positive) microlenses makes use of reflow of the amorphous <b>fluorocarbon</b> <b>polymer</b> and was tested fabricating lenses with nominal diameters ranging from 25 &# 61549;m to 200 &# 61549;m. The scope of this thesis is a general approach to process development and performance characterization of the microoptical elements. We also have an application in mind: optical beam steering, which can be implemented by integrating the lenses on a translatable silicon stage. The lenses developed in this work are all suitable for this application. Our Fresnel lens is designed to use a 850 nm VCSEL as light source, and has an f-number of 2. 5. The refractive lenses fabricated have f-numbers as small as ~ 1. 9. In particular the lenses with nominal diameters of 25 - 50 &# 61549;m were found to have a perfect lens shape all over their surface, yielding high quality focusing lenses. The good optical properties of the amorphous <b>fluorocarbon</b> <b>polymer</b> used as the optical material makes our refractive lenses useful in a broad wavelength interval; in the visible and near-infrared range their transmittance is > 95 %...|$|E
