5|$|In December 2008, the Channel 4 {{television}} {{comedy series}} Star Stories broadcast a satirical mockumentary of Mills's life story from her point of view. In 2009, after petitioning the Press Complaints Commission in the UK about being lied {{about in the}} press, five British tabloids (The Sun, The Daily Express, News of the World, Sunday Mirror and Daily Mirror) publicly apologised to Mills about printing false, hurtful or defamatory stories about her. Another tabloid (the Daily Mail), sent a private letter of apology. Mills <b>has</b> <b>complained</b> that over 4,400 abusive articles about her have been published.|$|E
5|$|After his career, Washington <b>has</b> <b>complained</b> of {{treatment}} {{he has received}} in relation to his punching of Tomjanovich. Washington has sought to portray himself {{as a victim of}} the fight and appears to have exaggerated some of the misfortunes that came his way as a result of it. Washington told The New York Times that he has been refused work as a coach time and again. However, Tom Davis hired him as an assistant coach at Stanford, and Davis wanted to bring him to Iowa when he went to coach there. Washington stayed at Stanford and later quit his assistant coaching position, and he subsequently worked as strength and conditioning coach for the Portland Trail Blazers.|$|E

Due to large scale cooking on the roads, some residents <b>have</b> <b>complained</b> of pollution, while many <b>have</b> <b>complained</b> that mosquitoes increase in number during the fair.

5|$|All of the {{location}} shots were filmed {{at the beginning of}} the production block. Recording for the first series of six episodes began on location in the first half of April 1992 and were mainly filmed in Chelsea within a short distance from the director's home. The stand-up sequences were filmed in the Café Des Artistes on London's Fulham Road, now known as the Valmont Club, and were shot for the benefit of the studio audience, with the intention of reshooting them later for the broadcast version. Robert Bathurst <b>has</b> <b>complained</b> that, in order to save £5,000, this promised reshoot never materialised. The close ups of Bathurst were filmed in the studio for the second series, with stock footage of the club's audience reused.|$|E
5|$|Controversy {{has arisen}} since the {{creation}} of the awards; there have been two occasions when no award was given because no titles were judged to be odd enough, Bent <b>has</b> <b>complained</b> about some of the winners chosen by the public, and the 2008 winner, The 2009–2014 World Outlook for 60-milligram Containers of Fromage Frais, proved controversial because rather than being written by its listed author, Philip M. Parker, it was instead written by a machine of Parker's invention. The most recent winner, in July 2017, was The Commuter Pig Keeper: A Comprehensive Guide to Keeping Pigs when Time is your Most Precious Commodity by Michaela Giles.|$|E
5|$|Chastain is a feminist, and {{has often}} spoken against the {{discrimination}} faced {{by women and}} minorities in Hollywood. She wrote an opinion column on gender imbalance in the industry for a December 2015 issue of The Hollywood Reporter. At the 2017 Cannes Film Festival, where she served as a jury member, Chastain bemoaned the passive portrayal of women in most films. She <b>has</b> <b>complained</b> about a lack of female film critics, which she believes hinders a gender-neutral perspective on film. Among other issues, she is vocal in her support for equal pay in the workplace, and has rejected offers of work that she thought were unfair. In 2013, Chastain lent her support to the Got Your 6 campaign, to help empower veterans of the United States Army, and in 2016, she became an advisory-board member to the organization We Do It Together, which produces films and television shows to promote the empowerment of women. Chastain has campaigned for access to affordable reproductive health care for women, and in 2017, Variety honored her for her work with Planned Parenthood.|$|E

5|$|The MAW {{has been}} criticised by workers' and welfare groups for making FDWs second-class citizens. The {{statutory}} minimum wage {{does not apply to}} them; although the MAW is HK$3,920, a local worker working a 48-hour week would earn HK$6,240 if paid at the minimum hourly wage of HK$30 (as of 30 March 2015). The International Domestic Workers Federation <b>has</b> <b>complained</b> that the MAW rose by only 3.9 percent (or HK$150) from 1998 to 2012, failing to keep pace with Hong Kong's median monthly income (which rose over 15 percent during the same period). Since Hong Kong is a benchmark market for Asian migrant workers, there is pressure to keep wages low. Wages were also held in check by competition from Indonesian workers, who began arriving in large numbers during the 1990s. Since then, workers from other Asian countries (such as Bangladesh and Nepal) may be willing to work for less than the MAW.|$|E
5|$|When Silva {{was arrested}} in October 2012, he confessed {{to the murder of}} Martínez Pérez. Investigators and {{authorities}} in Veracruz concluded that the journalist was killed during a robbery. But when placed before a judge, Silva retracted his confession and stated that he had been tortured, held hostage for over a week, and threatened by Veracruz authorities in order to make him confess to the assassination. Silva said that officials had threatened to kill his mother, his last remaining family member. During a press conference, the Veracruz authorities relied solely on the confession of Silva as evidence against him. None of them made references to DNA, fingerprint, or blood samples from the murder scene. Sources close to the Committee to Protect Journalists stated that the samples collected at the crime scene do not match those of any of the criminals listed on the national database. This should rule out both Silva and Domínguez (who is still at large) from the murder, because both of them have extensive criminal records. Proceso news magazine immediately took a critical stance toward the investigation and said that they did not believe that the Veracruz authorities were capable of completing a clean investigation. The Committee to Protect Journalists believes that the murder case was possibly fabricated, and that Silva was likely used as a scapegoat by the authorities. Just a few items were stolen from Martínez Pérez's house while valuable goods were left behind, so they allege that theft was not the real motive behind her murder. According to Mexican law, Proceso was allowed to participate in the investigation, so they appointed a top journalist to cover every detail of it. Proceso <b>has</b> <b>complained</b> that the Veracruz authorities have lied to them regarding possible developments in the investigation.|$|E

A group of residents <b>has</b> <b>complained</b> to the New Jersey Division of Taxation, claiming that home values had been calculated incorrectly and arbitrarily, showing data that a sample of smaller homes saw taxes drop 8% while taxes on larger homes increased by 10%. The Mansfield Township tax assessor denied the claims and responded that the revaluation complied with all state legal requirements.|$|E

25|$|Transparency International Sri Lanka (TISL) has {{documented}} incidents of state employees, including those from Road Development Authority and the Sri Lanka Civil Security Force, carrying out election propaganda {{work for the}} Rajapaksa campaign.

The Election Commissioner has asked the state broadcasters not to broadcast programmes supporting Rajapaksa.

25|$|When Vikernes was convicted, it was {{possible}} to be released on parole after serving 12 years of a 21-year sentence, but in 2002, before he became eligible, the Norwegian Parliament had extended this to 14 years. In June 2006, after serving 12 years, Vikernes was denied parole by the Department of Criminal Justice for this reason. His lawyer, John Christian Elden, <b>has</b> <b>complained</b> that the policy change is a form of retroactive legislation. Article 97 of the Norwegian constitution forbids any law being given retroactive force. Vikernes was denied parole again in June 2008, although he was allowed to leave Tromsø Prison for short periods to visit his family. His full sentence would run for another seven years. In March 2009, however, his parole was announced. He had then served 15 years of his 21-year sentence. On 22 May 2009, he confirmed that he had been released from prison on probation.|$|E
