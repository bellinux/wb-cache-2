In The Writer's Tale, he describes his procrastination by discussing his early career: at the time, his method {{of dealing with the}} pressures of delivering a script was to [...] "go out drinking" [...] instead. On one occasion in the mid-1990s, he was at the Manchester gay club Cruz 101 when he thought of the climax to the first series of The Grand. As his career progressed, he instead spent entire nights [...] "just thinking of plot, character, pace, etc" [...] and waited until 2:00am, [...] "when the clubs used to shut", to overcome the urge of procrastination. Davies described the sense of anxiety he experiences in an email to Cook in April 2007, in response to Cook's question of [...] "how <b>do</b> <b>you</b> <b>know</b> <b>when</b> to start writing?": ...|$|E

6000|$|... "Oh, uncommonly so. You will {{hardly believe}} it, but she {{actually}} {{asked me to}} dine. She always <b>does,</b> <b>you</b> <b>know,</b> <b>when</b> she wants to show her good humour. If you'd broken your leg, and she wished to commiserate you, she'd ask you to dinner." ...|$|R

6000|$|MURRAY (glumly). I'm not. You can't call it writing--not what I did--small town stuff. (Changing the subject.) But I {{wanted to}} ask you something. <b>Do</b> <b>you</b> <b>know</b> <b>when</b> I'm to be moved away to the huts? ...|$|E
6000|$|... 'I'm sure I am {{glad you}} are,' {{and there was}} a little kissing match. 'You'll always come to my room, won't you? <b>Do</b> <b>you</b> <b>know,</b> <b>when</b> Constance came to luncheon, I only shook hands, I wouldn't try to kiss her. Was that unforgiving?' ...|$|E
6000|$|... "But {{that is not}} love." [...] He spoke authoritatively. [...] "I {{have been}} in many ports, but I never knew a passing touch of love until I saw you that first night. <b>Do</b> <b>you</b> <b>know,</b> <b>when</b> I said good night and went away, I was almost arrested." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Ah!" [...] she said, [...] "I do {{not like}} to hear <b>you</b> talk so. <b>Do</b> <b>you</b> <b>know</b> that <b>when</b> <b>you</b> <b>do,</b> <b>you</b> make me afraid that {{something}} I have always hoped for will never come to pass?" ...|$|R
6000|$|Helen smiled. [...] "I didn't {{see much}} use in <b>doing</b> so. <b>You</b> <b>knew</b> <b>when</b> your letter would arrive {{and how long}} it would take me to come. It's {{significant}} that you came to meet the train." ...|$|R
6000|$|... 'Oh yes, {{one has to}} <b>do</b> that, <b>you</b> <b>know,</b> <b>when</b> our own fellows get blackguardly,' {{said little}} Lance, freely; whereat Cherry shuddered somewhat. 'And, Fee,' he added, 'if you would only come and make him {{understand}} about things.' ...|$|R

6000|$|... "Invent!" [...] she repeated. [...] "I do {{not think}} we need either of us look very far. Every one seems to have gone away whose {{presence}} made this place endurable.

6000|$|... "That I would. And yet I know I {{shall never}} have her. I'm a jolly, {{laughing}} sort of fellow; and yet, <b>do</b> <b>you</b> <b>know,</b> Caudle, <b>when</b> that girl marries, {{it will be}} all up with me. It will, indeed." ...|$|R

5000|$|The song has {{references}} {{to a number}} of celebrities within the lyrics. Johnnie Cochran, a famous attorney who represented (amongst others) stars such as O.J. Simpson, who was acquitted of murdering his ex-wife Nicole Brown. He is mentioned in the lines [...] "Well <b>did</b> <b>you</b> <b>know</b> <b>when</b> you're famous <b>you</b> could kill your wife / and there's no such thing as 25 to life / as long as you got the cash to pay for Cochran." [...] A former mayor of Washington, D.C., Marion Barry [...] - [...] who was convicted on drug charges [...] - [...] is also mentioned in the lyrics: [...] "and <b>did</b> <b>you</b> <b>know</b> if <b>you</b> were caught and you were smokin' crack / McDonald's wouldn't even wanna take you back / you could always just run for mayor of D.C." ...|$|R

'And <b>do</b> <b>you</b> <b>know,</b> <b>when</b> you {{are down}} there, {{it is so}} cold, actually, and so endless, so {{different}} really from what it is on top, so endless--you wonder how it is so many are alive, why we're up here. Are you going? I shall see you again, shan't I? Good-night, and thank you. Thank you very much!' ...|$|E
6000|$|... 'No, not flattering,' Herbert answered, smiling; 'not flattering, Selah, simply truthful. You always extort {{the truth}} from me with your sweet face, Selah.

6000|$|... "Good heavens, Fan, <b>do</b> <b>you</b> wish {{me to do}} that? Well, {{perhaps that}} would be best. I said that I was sick of deceit, and I {{ought to have the}} courage of my opinions. <b>Do</b> <b>you</b> <b>know</b> that <b>when</b> Mr. Tytherleigh called to see you, my lawyers had only just learnt the secret I had {{discovered}} several days before?" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "'Not so,' replied she; 'but <b>do</b> <b>you</b> not <b>know</b> that <b>when</b> it is {{once known}} {{we are not}} brother and sister, {{we can no longer}} be {{permitted}} to be thus always together?' ...|$|R
6000|$|... 'Especially the {{hospital}} scene, {{where you find}} the wounded son. Why, mother, <b>do</b> <b>you</b> <b>know</b> <b>when</b> we did that at last rehearsal my face was wet with real tears as you cried over me.

60|$|Well, <b>do</b> <b>you</b> <b>know</b> <b>when</b> I {{saw that}} I {{began to feel}} sorry--sorry--sorry. It {{seemed to me that}} I had done wrong. I {{reflected}} deeply. I reflected that I was young--I think I was just eleven. But I knew that though immature I did not lack moral advancement. I knew what a boy ought to do who had extracted a watermelon--like that.|$|E
6000|$|... "I don't know," [...] said Lily, {{knitting}} her brows. [...] "It's not ALL make believe!

6000|$|... "A woman's idea of manliness is very extended. You {{expect to}} get everything, and to <b>do</b> nothing. <b>You</b> talk of justice! <b>Do</b> <b>you</b> not <b>know</b> that <b>when</b> I married you, I looked to your uncle's fortune?" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Then I {{will help}} you to tie them. <b>Do</b> <b>you</b> <b>know</b> why I am up so early? It is for your sake. I behaved badly to you last night, for I was cross because you wanted to thwart me about seeing the king. I never thanked you for all <b>you</b> <b>did,</b> <b>you</b> brave Peter, though I thanked you enough in my heart. <b>Do</b> <b>you</b> <b>know</b> that <b>when</b> <b>you</b> stood there with that sword, {{in the middle of}} those Englishmen, you looked quite noble?

6000|$|... "Dear child, you've missed {{so much of}} the tea {{and cakes}} of life, haven't you?

She'd drag you to moving-picture shows.... Oh! You didn't tell me that you went to moving pictures, did you?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Now I come {{to think}} of it," [...] she went on reminiscently, [...] "there is a curious streak of fidelity, isn't there, in your father's character. You must take after him. It ought to make you very careful, Letitia. I don't want to say a word against Charles, but he doesn't carry his head quite so high as you <b>do,</b> <b>you</b> <b>know.</b> <b>When</b> are you going to {{announce}} your engagement?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Isn't she beautiful?" [...] {{he said to}} me (in his wife's hearing!). [...] "What a figure, {{and what}} a voice! You {{remember}} her voice? It's a loss, my dear lady, an irretrievable loss, to the operatic stage! <b>Do</b> <b>you</b> <b>know,</b> <b>when</b> I think what that grand creature might have done, I sometimes ask myself if I really had any right to marry her. I feel, upon my honor I feel, as if I had committed a fraud on the public!" ...|$|E
5000|$|In the 21st century doubt {{has been}} cast on whether {{in fact there}} were ever house to house {{inspections}} carried out by gas supply company officials. But one oral history graphically describes a glimmer man's inspections He came to our house I think about twice. He came at a very civil time of the day, <b>when</b> there nothing <b>doing,</b> <b>you</b> <b>know?</b> ... <b>When</b> he came into our house {{he put his hands}} over the thing and put powder on it then… with the powder, I don't know what time {{it would have to be}} since they were on, but he'd put the powder on, but we never got in any trouble over it. After a while everybody got to know them (laughs) [...] "it's the glimmerman" [...] and you'd be pouring water over it. Another writer describes the tribulations of a neighbouring widow to get reconnected and the lengths his mother went to avoid being detected using [...] "the glimmer" [...] but concedes that his house never received a visit. On the other hand, Irish secondary school history students are expected to have a knowledge of the topic and be able to comment on its significance.|$|R
6000|$|... "Having {{answered}} your question, miss," [...] {{says the}} Sergeant, [...] "I beg leave {{to make an}} inquiry in my turn. There is a smear on the painting of your door, here. <b>Do</b> <b>you</b> happen to <b>know</b> <b>when</b> it was done? or who did it?" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "That is different; {{that comes}} from the heart and hard work. <b>Do</b> <b>you</b> <b>know</b> that <b>when</b> I was under my old master out in Denmark, who in his time was one of the finest of violinists in the north of Europe, I often played for five and sang for two hours a day? Also, I have never let the thing drop; it has been the {{consolation}} and amusement of a somewhat lonely life. So, by this time, I ought to understand my art, although there remains much to be learnt." ...|$|R
