In fact, we propose a metalevel for architectural design based on requirements optimization. The metalevel is hence independent from specifications or properties for verification or design time-modeling issues. It is mainly concerned with having a high-level framework {{to be used for}} metamodeling of self-adptiveness and integration of applications deriving from several <b>interoperable</b> <b>application</b> domains.|$|E

However, we think would be better if we conduct an additional and more rigorous study regarding this point.

40|$|Facilitating an <b>interoperable</b> <b>application</b> {{environment}} {{based on}} heterogeneous georesources {{is one of}} the ultimate goals for a spatial data infrastructure (SDI). As the sharing of geospatial data becomes increasingly easy and convenient, the discrepancy and heterogeneity of data quality between datasets dynamically collected from various georesources must be taken into consideration. Such awareness of data quality must extend to the design of geographic information system (GIS) operations, which are often naively used to analyze and derive new information. This paper proposes a quality-aware approach for incorporating standardized quality information into the design of GIS operations to ensure that the necessary quality information is always evaluated in a map interface for correct interpretation. Since the proposed approach can greatly reduce user effort when dealing with unfamiliar datasets, it should be seamlessly integrated with current sharing frameworks based on geospatial web services to facilitate user-friendly and interoperable geospatial applications...|$|E
40|$|ABSTRACT: Web {{services}} are generally accepted {{as the most}} <b>interoperable</b> <b>application</b> interface today on the Web. In {{the context of a}} global electronic marketplace this is an essential factor. In keeping with Services-Oriented Architecture trends, a Web service-based Message Service Handler can provide a global service to all participants in the global marketplace. The main objective of this research is to design a Web service to provide Message Handler Services, using ebXML as the point-of-departure. The focus {{of this paper is to}} arrive at a set of pre-specified security standards to promote the goal of interoperability, explaining, with justification, which security mechanisms should be used within the proposed Web service model. The Web service will send messages using the SOAP with Attachments architecture. The use of XML signatures and XML encryption within this SOAP envelope is advised to ensure integrity, authentication and confidentiality. When the actual SOAP envelope is transmitted over the Internet, it will be wrapped within an IPSec packet to ensure further security...|$|E
40|$|Health care {{providers}} are legally obliged to report cases of specified diseases {{to public health}} authorities, but existing manual, provider-initiated reporting systems generally result in incomplete, error-prone, and tardy information flow. Automated laboratory-based reports are more likely accurate and timely, but lack clinical information and treatment details. Here, we describe the Electronic Support for Public Health (ESP) application, a robust, automated, secure, portable public health detection and messaging system for cases of notifiable diseases. The ESP application applies disease specific logic to any complete source of electronic medical data in a fully automated process, and supports an optional case management workflow system for case notification control. All relevant clinical, laboratory and demographic details are securely transferred to the local health authority as an HL 7 message. The ESP application has operated continuously in production mode since January 2007, applying rigorously validated case identification logic to ambulatory EMR data from more than 600, 000 patients.

40|$|Scientific {{research}} {{is one of}} the main institutional tasks of any Italian university. Accounting and reporting on research results for evaluation purposes is a necessary but timeconsuming effort for researchers and administration offices. All data and output that are created from a plethora of different research activities need to be collected, turn them into a consistent format and make them available in a continuous stream. Moreover, wide publication and dissemination of results is requested for every research project and is fundamental for research careers and funding. SUR+ (SURPLUS) is an integrated system for research management that aims to control several workflows related to research activities and their results in the academic environment. It enhances the internal and external visibility of research activities, and provides real-time monitoring tools, reporting and exporting facilities. SUR+ is formed from several <b>interoperable</b> <b>application</b> modules, that can be adopted separately. This presentation will deal with the OA (Open Archive) module, a repository that collects, describes, indexes, and distributes the intellectual output of institutional research activities. Based on the open-source software application DSpace, designed and developed by the Massachusetts Institute of Technology and the Hewlett-Packard labs, SUR+ OA is a userfriendly tool that can be accessed by any researcher belonging to the institution to submit his/her own publications. Simple metadata are compiled by the submitter and checked/completed by a librarian. Publication details can be reused in different applications, from the SUR+ WF module for project management to the "Professor site" of the Ministry, from the personal web page of the researcher to any bibliographical list. The use of standards formats and protocols such as Dublin Core, XML, OAI-PMH, ensures compliancy with the architectures of the Open Archives Initiative and the broadest dissemination of open-access scholarly literature for higher institutional visibility and the public benefit...|$|E

40|$|Abstract. The Internet {{computing}} {{model with}} its ubiquitous networking and computing infrastructure is driving {{a new class}} of <b>interoperable</b> <b>applications</b> that benefit both from high computing power and multiple Internet connections. In this context, grids are promising computing platforms that allow to aggregate distributed resources such as workstations and clusters to solve large-scale problems. However, because most parallel programming tools were primarily developed for MPP and cluster computing, to exploit the new environment higher abstraction and cooperative interfaces are required. Rocmeµ is a platform originally designed to support the operation of multi-SAN clusters that integrates application modeling and resource allocation. In this paper we show how the underlying resource oriented computation model provides the necessary abstractions to accommodate the migration from cluster to multicluster grid enabled computing. ...|$|R

40|$|Abstract. Establishing secure {{communication}} channels between devices that share no a priori context, {{also known as}} the device-pairing problem, is the first step towards the realization of mobile, <b>interoperable</b> <b>applications</b> interacting across several devices. One approach that promises to be both secure and usable relies on so-called auxiliary or out-of-band channels for authentication. Although many such solutions have been independently suggested, open, easily usable implementations are unfortunately missing so far. In this demonstration, we present OpenUAT, an open source toolkit for establishing secure ad-hoc connections. Open-UAT implements many of the auxiliary channels proposed {{in the past few years}} on top of a unified, common cryptographic protocol for key exchange and runs on a variety of mobile phones and desktop/laptop computers. By giving users the chance to directly compare different device pairing alternatives in a real-life security prototype, OpenUAT fosters usability research and shortens the gap between research prototypes and real-world applications. ...|$|R
