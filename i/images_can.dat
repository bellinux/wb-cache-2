5|$|By {{examining}} unique striations, or markings, {{left behind}} on the bullet as it passes through the barrel and on the cartridge as it is hit by the firing pin, individual spent rounds can be linked back to a specific weapon. Known exemplars taken from a seized weapon can be directly compared to samples recovered from the scene using a comparison microscope. Striation <b>images</b> <b>can</b> also be uploaded to any existing national databases. Furthermore, these markings {{can be compared to}} other images in an attempt to link one weapon to multiple crime scenes. Like all forensic specialties, forensic firearm examiners are subject to being called to testify in court as expert witnesses.|$|E

40|$|Abstract. To {{provide with}} an {{effective}} method for non-photorealistic rendering for computer generated images with sketch artistic appearances from 2 D images motivates our {{work in this}} paper. The character of lines, details in the source <b>image</b> <b>can</b> be smoothed by the technique of guided filter, and then the abstract smooth appearance of the <b>image</b> <b>can</b> be simulated. In addition, the smooth effect can be enlarged and enhanced by the technique of improved line integral convolution, so the final sketch artistic <b>image</b> <b>can</b> be obtained. Experimental {{results show that the}} proposed method can simulate the real sketch effect. 1...|$|R

50|$|In {{this simple}} example, the two boxes are {{illuminated}} one pixel at a time. However, using quantum correlation between photons {{from the two}} beams, the correct <b>image</b> <b>can</b> also be recorded using complex light distributions.

25|$|The {{two primary}} types of HDR images are {{computer}} renderings and images resulting from merging multiple low-dynamic-range (LDR) or standard-dynamic-range (SDR) photographs.

Once the sample has been focused on, then an <b>image</b> <b>can</b> be acquired and displayed on the monitor. If it is a digital camera or a frame grabber is present, the <b>image</b> <b>can</b> now be saved in digital format, and <b>image</b> processing algorithms <b>can</b> be used to isolate particles in the field of view and measure them.|$|R

25|$|In contrast, a {{real image}} {{is one that}} is formed when the {{outgoing}} rays form a point converging at a real location. Real <b>images</b> <b>can</b> be projected onto a diffuse reflecting screen, but a screen is not necessary for the image to form.|$|E
25|$|The DC {{coefficients}} {{when taken}} together resemble a downscale {{version of the}} original image multiplied by a scaling factor.

50|$|While an <b>image</b> <b>can</b> be {{transformed}} in various ways, pure warping means that points are mapped to points without changing the colors. This can be based mathematically on any function from (part of) {{the plane to}} the plane. If the function is injective the original can be reconstructed. If the function is a bijection any <b>image</b> <b>can</b> be inversely transformed.|$|R
30|$|In this paper, {{we propose}} a LDSM method for solving {{functional}} MRI sequence reconstruction problem. Based on a key {{assumption that the}} variations of functional MR images are sparse over time in the wavelet domain, our method models an fMRI sequence as a linear dynamic sparse model. By using the linear sparse model, the prior information of the unknown fMRI <b>image</b> <b>can</b> be extracted from the previous fMRI image and the sparse variations. The prior information, expressing certainty and uncertainty of an unknown <b>image,</b> <b>can</b> be employed to boost the reconstructed image quality. Firstly, {{the uncertainty of the}} <b>image</b> <b>can</b> be used to guide the measurement so that more useful information can be obtained. Secondly, even when the number of measurements is under-determined, a high quality <b>image</b> <b>can</b> still be generated by involving its prior information in the reconstruction process. For this reason, the reconstruction and measurement design algorithms that adopt the linear dynamic sparse model are preferred.|$|R
