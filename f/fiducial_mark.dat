For traditional <b>fiducial</b> <b>mark</b> positioning method, two processing methods are proposed, including automatic detection of "reference fiducial mark" and <b>fiducial</b> <b>mark</b> positioning. The concentric circles <b>fiducial</b> <b>mark</b> detects the center and edge lines of concentric circles in the image. The straight lines intersection mark detects the intersection point of horizontal and vertical edges of the object.

A grey-level image of profile is thresholded to produce a binary, black and white image, the black corresponding to face region. A pre-processing step then extracts the outline curve of the front portion of the silhouette that bounds the face image. From this curve, a set of twelve <b>fiducial</b> <b>marks</b> is automatically identified using scalespace filtering with varying the scale parameter. A set of twenty-one feature characteristics is derived from these <b>fiducial</b> <b>marks.</b> After normalising the feature characteristics using two selected <b>fiducial</b> <b>marks,</b> the Euclidean distance measure is used for measuring the similarity of the feature vectors derived from the outline profiles.

40|$|Computer disk is unreadable. An {{automated}} camera {{calibration procedure}} was successfully developed to allow accurate measurements {{to be made}} from images obtained from camera-lens systems exhibiting geometric and lens distortion. The calibration procedure is based upon image analysis methods programmed in script using Mathworks MATLAB software. The process initially involved capturing an 512 x 512 pixel image of a calibration chart consisting of a regularly spaced two dimensional grid of circle shaped fiducial marks. Background leveling was used to correct intensity gradients due to non uniform illumination. A region of interest was determined for each <b>fiducial</b> <b>mark</b> in the image, by thresholding followed by an identification process. A grayscale Centroid Calculation Method was then used to accurately determine the center position of each <b>fiducial</b> <b>mark.</b> Two polynomial equations were fitted in the least squares sense to describe an inverse spatial transformation function that mapped <b>fiducial</b> <b>mark</b> position (xT,yT) in the image to the actual positions (x,y) in real world coordinates on the calibration chart. A second image of a calibration chart was obtained so that the overall calibration error could be assessed for the procedure. The effect of altering the degree of the fitted polynomial equation on the error was investigated. No significant reduction in error was achieved by increasing the order of the fitted polynomial equations above order 4. The effect of altering <b>fiducial</b> <b>mark</b> size on error was investigated. For the Fujinon TV lens being tested at a focal distance of 32 cm and a field size of approximately 18 cm square, an optimal <b>fiducial</b> <b>mark</b> diameter was determined to be 3 mm (8. 5 pixels). Increased calibration error was obtained for <b>fiducial</b> <b>mark</b> diameters both greater and less than this figure. The effects on calibration error of varying aperture were investigated. Greater calibration error observed at low aperture settings was attributed to primary lens aberration and also the possibility of systematic error in the Centroid Calculation Method due to spatial undersampling in the image. Increased diffraction resulting in loss of definition at the reduced aperture probably explains the increase in error that was observed at aperture setting, f 22. An optimum aperture setting of f 11 was determined, for this particular lens. The use of this camera calibration procedure has resulted in a large increase in accuracy for position determination or measurement from an image. When the non-linear effects of geometric or lens distortion are ignored, the maximum observed error was seen to be as high as 5. 10 pixels compared to the maximum error in a 4 th order calibrated image of 0. 77 pixels. Mean error was observed to decrease from 1. 25 to 0. 33 pixels in the calibrated case. The mean error obtained {{as a result of the}} calibration closely approached the estimated uncertainty present in the physical calibration chart. The computation time required for the calibration of an image of a control chart having 320 control points, including the calculation of a verification image, was found to be 6. 5 minutes on a Pentium 100 MHz computer. The advantage of the automated procedure is that it is accurate and fast, unlike manual methods that are tedious, time consuming and prone to error...|$|E

These marks could be at the four corners, four middle sides, or even inside (for those r'eseau marks) of an image. The segmentation was realized by using attribute-based mathematical morphology techniques.

40|$|Abstract- The {{coherent}} signal averaging process requires an accurate {{estimation of the}} fiducial point in all beats to be averaged. The temporal cross-correlation between the detected beat and a template beat is the typical alignment method used with high-resolution ECG (HRECG) records. However, this technique does not produce a precise <b>fiducial</b> <b>mark</b> in records with high noise levels. In this study, we propose a new alignment method based on the multi-scale cross-correlation between the wavelet transforms of the template and the detected beat, respectively. The wavelet and temporal methods were tested for several simulated records corrupted with white noise and electromyographic (EMG) noise of different RMS levels. The results indicate that wavelet alignment method produces a lower trigger jitter than the temporal method in all tests.

40|$|Fabricating and {{measuring}} sub- 5 nanometer features brings to light several pressing issues in future semiconductor industry manufacturing and dimensional metrology. This dissertation presents a feasible process to create nanostructures using scanning probes with applications in dimensional metrology and nanomanufacturing processes. Using the lattice spacing of a crystal as the fundamental "ruler" or scale, sub 5 nm critical dimension reference standards {{can be created}} with atomic scale dimensional control. This technique relies on atomically sharp tips to provide robust imaging and patterning (nanolithography) capabilities. We have developed a comprehensive process to routinely produce high quality scanning tunneling microscope (STM) tips. The quality of STM tips are {{a critical factor in}} achieving reproducible patterning. A modified electrochemical etching method has been used to create sharp tips with preferred apex geometry. By using a field ion microscope (FIM), tip surfaces have been cleaned by field evaporation. Finally, a thermal ultra-high-vacuum (UHV) process is implemented to stabilize the atoms on the tip apex for improved performance. The process is also found to be capable of restructuring the apex to regain atomic resolution when tips fail during imaging or patterning. Silicon (100) samples with pre-patterned micrometer-size <b>fiducial</b> <b>marks</b> are used as templates in this technique. The <b>fiducial</b> <b>marks</b> are used as 2 D references to relocate the tip scanned area and the lithographic patterns. Large atomically-flat reconstructed (100) surfaces are obtained after a wet chemical cleaning process and a high temperature annealing process. After the high temperature annealing process, we observed reproducible step-terrace patterns formed on surfaces due to the <b>fiducial</b> <b>marks.</b> A kinetic Monte-Carlo simulation was used to study quantitatively the evolution of surface morphology under the influence of <b>fiducial</b> <b>marks.</b> Some of the key aspects, such as the electromigration effect and step permeability have been extensively studied.

Optimized depassivation procedures enable us to fabricate patterns from the microscale to the atomic scale consistently using an UHV STM. To preserve and later enhance the nanopatterns, SiO 2 hard etch mask marks are formed by oxidizing the patterns using ambient humidity or gaseous oxygen. A reactive ion etching (RIE) process is used to further enhance the aspect ratio of oxidized nanopatterns {{so that they can be}} served as 3 D nanostructures on silicon surfaces...|$|R

40|$|This paper {{concerned}} with a comparative study {{and implementation of}} Interior orientation manually and automatically for KFA- 1000. In manually method, firstly, we reproduced the image to its reduced size photographically from the original image to be measurable in a mono comparator from 30 * 30 cm to 23 * 23 cm which proceeds by measuring of photo coordinates of four pieces of KFA- 1000 photo. After computation, it was realized that geometric distortion due to photography is high so the chosen method {{is to make a}} photographic reproduction of the image in suitable pieces, measuring with traditional instruments and pining the pieces together before calculation. In the second method, we scanned the space photo and used digital image processing techniques in which CCF (Cross correlation Function) and BinaryCCF were used to approximate positioning followed by quadratic surface fitting for the purpose of precise fiducial centre determination. In both methods, we applied three types of transformation called Conformal, Affine and 2 D projective to the algorithms. The final results showed that we could achieve sub-pixel accuracy of nearly 10 micrometer for 25 micrometer pixel size image by using 2 D projective transformation which is approximately equal to the accuracy achieved in manual method. With respect to differences between aerial and KFA- 1000 photos, we considered those differences and applied them to the algorithms used in both fields (aerial and space) particularly different background at location of each <b>fiducial</b> <b>mark</b> in KFA- 1000 which made us to resample a suitable template while in aerial photos backgrounds in any photo are similar with good contrast which guarantee the robustness of the algorithms. We also examined the effect of pre-processing techniques on the robustness of algorithm and took into account the results. 1...|$|E
50|$|Potential distortions {{include the}} {{incorrect}} {{position of the}} film in the camera, the distortions of the film by the development process, and (if digitally scanned) the nonlinearity of the image scanner. These errors may be visually imperceptible but limit the precisions of measurements. Because {{the position of the}} marks is very precisely known, the image can easily be corrected to account for these effects. When used for photogrammetry, multiple images can be combined using the <b>fiducial</b> <b>marks</b> and knowledge of the camera geometry to enable measurement of distances between objects in the images.|$|R
40|$|This paper {{presents}} {{the feasibility of}} creating a hybrid polymer-glass achromatic microlens array by compression molding. This affordable and high precision microlens array design has potential applications in the optical industry for its capability of correcting chromatic aberration. In this research a doublet design was investigated. Specifically, polycarbonate and P-SK 57 glass were selected as the equivalents of flint and crown glass for their opposite dispersion properties. Ultraprecision diamond machining was utilized to manufacture the mold with an asymmetric pattern. The optical quality in the mold surface was obtained without post-machining-polishing. Both the glass and polymer microlens arrays were fabricated by thermal compression molding at different forming temperatures. After the glass microlens array was molded, it {{was used as the}} top mold half for polymer compression molding. Two chisel-shaped cavities were fabricated simultaneously when the glass lens ar ray mold was machined. These two cavities were used as <b>fiducial</b> <b>marks</b> for assembling the P-SK 57 glass part and the polycarbonate part during the second molding action. The single uninterrupted operation was developed in this study to create both optical surfaces and the <b>fiducial</b> <b>marks</b> such that high assembly tolerance could be achieved. Furthermore, numerical simulation for compression molding was conducted to study the geometry profile error of the microlens. Finally, the geometry and optical measurements were performed to demonstrate the effectiveness of the hybrid polymer-glass achromatic microlens array...|$|R
