5|$|But Beyoncé is {{far from}} being all sentiment. Because a large part of being Beyoncé in America in 2013 <b>is</b> <b>being</b> <b>a</b> sexual {{creature}} and not only being unafraid of that fact, but reveling— and reveling confidently— in it. The amorphous, shifting Houston-trap-meets-Noah Shebib trunk rattler 'Partition' exemplifies this particular sentiment. On the track, the Queen Bey tells her driver to put the partition up because 'I don’t need you seeing 'Yoncé on her knees'; uses Monica Lewinsky as a euphemism for her man finishing on her clothing; reveals that 'he like to call me Peaches when we get this nasty'; and repeats that it took her '45 minutes to get all dressed up / and we ain’t even gonna make it to this club'. And in maybe the wildest moment in an album full of bold moves, Beyoncé actually slips in the French translation of Julianne Moore's 'Feminists love sex' monologue from The Big Lebowski.|$|E

Stoner's main role with Ducati <b>is</b> <b>being</b> <b>a</b> test rider {{and it has been}} further proposed that he may appear in some races as a wild card entry. Whether it could ultimately lead to a 2017 permanent return is yet undisclosed. Stoner participated in the official pre-season tests at Malaysia and was the fastest Ducati rider on the grid. He finished the final day of testing with the 5th-best time overall.|$|E

500|$|Marvel {{knew that}} they wanted a young Muslim girl, but stated {{that she could be}} from any place of origin and have any background. Wilson {{initially}} considered making her an Arab girl from Dearborn, Michigan but ultimately chose to create a Desi girl from Jersey City. Jersey City, which sits across the Hudson River from Manhattan, has been referred to as New York City's [...] "Sixth borough". It therefore forms an important part of Khan's identity and the narrative journey of her character since most of Marvel Comics' stories are set in Manhattan. Wilson explains, [...] "A huge aspect of Ms. Marvel <b>is</b> <b>being</b> <b>a</b> 'second string hero' in the 'second string city' and having to struggle out of the pathos and emotion that can give a person." ...|$|E

500|$|... "Snake Charmer", {{initially}} titled [...] "Genesis," [...] as {{a reference}} to the Book of Genesis, is based on the Biblical story of Adam and Eve. It pre-dates the band’s reunion, and was a guitar riff DeLonge kept around to expand upon in the future. The song's coda was composed by Barker and engineer Chris Holmes. Hoppus composed two versions of [...] "Heart's All Gone", one fast and one slow, and ended up liking both, so the slower version serves as an interlude on the album's deluxe edition. [...] "Wishing Well" [...] was solely created by DeLonge, and is what Hoppus describes as the epitome of the album: [...] "It's very catchy, but the lyrics are really, really dark and a little depressing." [...] "Kaleidoscope" [...] arose when Hoppus woke up with the song's opening lyrics in his head, which he expanded into a Descendents-ish classic punk song. [...] "The mentality behind it <b>is</b> <b>being</b> <b>a</b> slacker in 2011," [...] Hoppus said. [...] "The 20s and 30s malaise that is America right now." [...] It was also inspired by the album's lengthy recording process and the transformation of the band. [...] "This Is Home" [...] was originally titled [...] "Scars to Blame", but changed considerably when Hoppus took the chorus and bridge and combined it with new lyrics written by DeLonge, morphing it into what he described as [...] "an anthem for youthful abandon." ...|$|E

In America, more than any other place in the world, you have the freedom to be anything you want to be. Which is all well and good, but it only works if you have a value system – and we seem not to have one anymore. It's, 'Whatever it takes to get to the top, that's what you gotta do.' It's the allure of the beautiful life: 'Look like this, you're gonna be happy. Drive this car, you're gonna be popular. Wear these clothes and people are gonna want to fuck you.'

Metcalfe explained that Mercedes did not [...] "feel guilt at all - she just wants Riley back and she'll {{do whatever it takes}} to get him". Metcalfe believed that it was easy for Mercedes to lie; [...] "hence why she does it so much and so well!" [...] Mercedes felt that she had to lie, and found it easy to cry if she needed to, [...] "especially if it will benefit her". Metcalfe was unsure whether the audience would start to hate her character because she believed that Mercedes was not hateful. She stated, [...] "I hope I've done a good job and people still feel sorry for her". She said that [...] "the viewers have still been feeling some sympathy for Mercedes. I was getting lots of tweets saying, 'I feel so sorry for Mercedes, she needs to get back with Riley' and 'Mitzeee <b>is</b> <b>being</b> <b>a</b> bitch'". Metcalfe said that she was surprised by the fans' strong reaction. Hollyoaks executive producer Emma Smithwick also said that Mercedes [...] "gets away with blue murder [...] and yet there's so much love for that character". Smithwick told Daniel Kilkelly of Digital Spy that Mercedes would get her comeuppance for framing Mitzeee, saying: [...] "there most definitely will be a comeuppance. With the stabbing, she did it so coolly and lied about it so easily - that can't last forever". Smithwick explained that Mercedes is [...] "driven by her insecurities. She thinks she loves Riley and will do what it takes to win him. That's what it's about...winning. Mitzeee crossed her - she is dispensable but Riley...well, Riley is the prize. Mercedes Fisher usually gets what she wants and men usually fall in line with her. I want to see what happens when they don't..." ...|$|E

Tender refuses, but Adam asks him to find any rock that he can just to disfigure him with, {{pleading}} that if he goes to jail for his murders, he doesn't want the other inmates to even think about sexually abusing him. Tender reluctantly agrees to do this, as long as Adam will tell him when to stop, but Adam keeps telling him to swing again until it is too late and Adam dies. Immediately afterwards, Fertility shows up in a taxicab and takes Tender away from the landfill. They go back to Oregon, and Fertility plans to go on a quick job assignment to make some money. Fertility's job <b>is</b> <b>being</b> <b>a</b> surrogate mother for couples who can't conceive (Fertility is actually a pseudonym - her real name is Gwen); however, Fertility actually happens to be barren, so her job is, in essence, prostitution. The job she takes coincidentally happens to be for Tender's former employers. In the middle of the night, Tender sneaks into the house, and Fertility has sex with him in the guest bedroom (for a short while, for according to Tender, he only got in her a half an inch and it was over).|$|E
