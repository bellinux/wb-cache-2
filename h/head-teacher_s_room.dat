40|$|Background. Retrospective {{evaluation}} of bodily sensations {{is susceptible to}} various distortions leading to inaccurate symptom memory. Overestimation of recalled daily symptoms was found to increase over time in high habitual symptom reporters. The present study examines memory accuracy of experimentally induced dyspneic sensations in high (HSR) and low habitual symptom reporters (LSR). Methods. Healthy female students (N = 43; 19 HSR/ 24 LSR) participated in a rebreathing task. Two subsequent trials consisted of baseline (60 <b>s</b> <b>room</b> air) and rebreathing phase (150 s) leading to a gradual increase in PCO 2, ventilation and breathlessness. The short trial ended at peak breathlessness, the long trial continued with an additional recovery phase (150 <b>s</b> <b>room</b> air). The order of trials was counterbalanced across participants and groups. Breathlessness was measured with use of visual analogue scale at four moments: (1) every 10 s during dyspnea induction, (2) immediately after each trial, (3) after the experiment, and (4) after 2 weeks. Results. Concurrent breathlessness ratings did not differ between groups. Retrospective ratings of experienced dyspnea were significantly overestimated during recall by both high and low habitual symptom reporters (p <. 001). Furthermore, overestimation tended to increase over time (immediate vs. follow-up ratings) in HSR (p =. 06), while it remained constant in LSR. Discussion. Memory for experienced breathlessness is overall inaccurate and overestimated. However, {{with the passing of}} time, HSR tend to increase their overestimation. Furthermore, the findings show that retrospective evaluations are biased immediately after the end of experience. The present findings are important for diagnostic assessment based on symptom reporting. status: publishe...|$|R

40|$|The {{present study}} {{investigated}} differences in symptom perception between a clinical sample with medically unexplained symptoms (MUS) and a matched healthy control group. Participants (N = 58, 29 patients) {{were told that}} they would inhale different gas mixtures that might induce symptoms. Next, they went through 2 subsequent rebreathing trials consisting of a baseline (60 <b>s</b> <b>room</b> air breathing), a rebreathing phase (150 s, which gradually increased ventilation, PCO 2 in the blood, and perceived dyspnea), and a recovery phase (150 <b>s,</b> returning to <b>room</b> air breathing). Breathing behavior was continuously monitored, and dyspnea was rated every 10 s. The within-subject correlations between dyspnea {{on the one hand and}} end-tidal CO 2 and minute ventilation on the other were used to index the degree to which perceived dyspnea was related to specific relevant respiratory changes. The results showed that perceived symptoms were less strongly related to relevant physiological parameters in MUS patients than in healthy persons, specifically when afferent physiological input was relatively weak. This suggests a stronger role for top-down psychological processes in the symptom perception of patients with MUS. status: publishe...|$|R

40|$|We {{present a}} novel indoor {{localisation}} system that used acoustic sensing. We developed the Acoustic Landmark Locator {{to determine a}} person 2 ̆ 7 <b>s</b> current <b>room</b> location, within a building. Indoor environments tend to have distinct acoustic properties due to physical structure. Hence rooms in a building can have distinctive acoustic signatures. We found that these acoustic signatures can determine {{the position of a}} person. We attempted to identify location based on acoustic sensing of the surrounding indoor environment. We developed a mobile phone application that determined a person 2 ̆ 7 s location by measuring the acoustic levels of the surrounding environment. We used a machine learning artificial neural network based algorithm to classify the location of the person, within proximity to a landmark or room. We tested the Acoustic Landmark Locator in an indoor environment. Our tests show that the Acoustic Landmark Locator mobile phone app was able to successfully determine the location of the person carrying the mobile phone, in all test areas. It was also found that background noise caused by the presence of people does distort the landmark acoustic profiles but the artificial neural network based classifier was able to reliably determine the person 2 ̆ 7 <b>s</b> <b>room</b> location. Further work will involve investigating how other machine learning approaches can be used to better improve position accuracy...|$|R
