Objectives: To determine whether eight <b>disperse</b> <b>dyes,</b> hitherto most widely cited as allergenic, are still used in textiles that are sold in various countries. Methods: Textiles from 13 countries in Europe, Asia and the United States were analysed. The procedure used for dye identification was thin-layer chromatography.

UV/visible spectra of the commercial photochromic dyes in a range of solvents were obtained and interpreted in terms of solvent polarity. On the basis of this study, the photochromic performance of the fabrics was improved by selecting the appropriate application solvents which transferred minimum background colours onto the fabrics. A new method of evaluating lightfastness of photochromic fabrics was established, aimed at replacing the conventional method by an instrumental method. This method was based on comparing the decrease in the degree of photocoloration of photochromic fabrics after light exposure with measured values of the colour differences of the blue wool references after fixed periods of light exposure. Two photochromic dyes were synthesized by azo coupling of a spironaphtho[2, 1 -b]oxazine with diazonium salts obtained from p-nitroaniline, and m-nitroaniline. Molecular modeling of the new photochromic systems, which are referred to as azospirooxazine dyes, showed that the dyes were predicted to have the potential to show photochromism. Thus, the photochromism of the azospirooxazine dyes in a range of solvents was investigated. The investigations showed that the dyes performed differently in different solvents in terms of the hue, the rate of the photochromic colour change and the colour reversibility...|$|E

The sheer volume of water and the high concentration of additives used in textile colouration are staggering, which have already caused unrepairable damage to environment and continue to directly impact on the sustainability of textile colouration industry. “Supercritical CO 2 dyeing” uses supercritical CO 2 as the dyeing medium, enabling the reduction and even elimination of the creation of textile colouration wastewater. Supercritical carbon dioxide (scCO 2) has a low critical point and is non-flammable. It can be recycled, providing a promising environmentally friendly substitute for aqueous media. Reactive <b>disperse</b> <b>dyes</b> that have both reactivity towards natural fabrics and high solubility in scCO 2 would offer great promise for colouring natural fabrics. In this study, the isocyanate group, as a reactive group, was introduced to <b>disperse</b> <b>dyes</b> to create reactive <b>disperse</b> <b>dyes</b> suitable for supercritical dyeing.
