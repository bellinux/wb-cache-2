30|$|As {{continuous}} downscaling of complementary {{metal-oxide semiconductor}} (CMOS) into sub 20 nm nodes, strain engineering is utilized as an important technique to boost device performance [1]. There {{are a number of}} ways to exert strain to the channel, such as integrating SiGe or SiC as stressor material in source and drain region [2 – 6], stress memorization technology (SMT) [7], dual stress liners (DSL) [8], and metal gate stress technology (MGS). Among these techniques, MGS is attracting tremendous attention because of its easy integration with the state-of-the-art high-k and metal gate (HKMG)-last integration scheme and its effectiveness in inducing strain to the channel [9]. Initially, Intel utilized Al and TiN material as the filling metal in the gate region to induce compressive strain to enhance the performance of in 45 nm node n-MOSFET transistors [10]. However, as the aspect ratio of <b>dummy</b> <b>gate</b> trench became larger in 22 nm and beyond nodes, filling the trench without voids or seams by conventional Al metal confronted overwhelming challenge. Consequently, thanks to a good step coverage and conformity W metal using atomic layer deposition (ALD) emerges as a competitive candidate in filling the <b>dummy</b> <b>gate</b> trench [1, 11]. ALD W process was firstly developed by using precursors, Si 2 H 6 and WF 6 at 325  °C [12].|$|E

40|$|Abstract—In this paper, we {{investigate}} the optimization of de-vice layout and embedded source/drain (eS/D) shape profile for strain engineered 22 -nm node Si and SiGe p-channel trigate field-effect transistors by finite-element method simulations. A nested trigate layout with <b>dummy</b> <b>gates</b> {{is found to}} retain the maximum channel stress for all three conduction planes. The tradeoff be-tween achievable mobility enhancement and active device density for the nested trigate layout is also investigated in this paper. Next, {{the impact of the}} eS/D shape on the channel stress for all three conduction planes is studied, and the rounded eS/D shape is found to be the optimal shape contrary to the planar case with sigma-shaped eS/D. Finally, strained SiGe channel trigate transistors are investigated as a potential candidate for future technology nodes. The evolution of formation and relaxation of the average strain of the compressively strained SiGe channel is systematically studied as a function of fin formation, embedded S/D formation, and layout configuration.

The shallow extension regions of S/D are formed with twice 3 keV BF+ implantations with tilted angle of 30 ° against to the direction of channel followed by a spike annealing.

40|$|In this work, {{we focused}} on the <b>dummy</b> <b>gate</b> etch process for high-k first process and firstly {{investigated}} two etch schemes with end-cut based double patterning technique. The pure hard-mask scheme is proven to be superior {{from the point of}} view of the aspect ratio, the control of the selectivity of ODL over poly-Si and the impact of ODL removal on HK capping layer and silicon substrate. Compared with the traditional poly-Si gate etch, HK capping layer can serve as a more reliable etch stop layer. However, the extra steps dedicated to HK and its capping layer affect the bottom profile of the poly-Si gate, ending up with a notched bottom profile. Treatment after poly-Si etch has been demonstrated to remarkably alleviate such impact. Besides, we also demonstrated different sidewall profiles of HK and its capping layer, which can affect final transistor performance and needs precisely control...|$|E

Liquid solder joints have previously been proposed in order to improve the reliability of solder joints in general, and especially for those that are operated at elevated temperatures. The solder is designed to melt during high temperature operation, releasing the stresses on the joint. The component will remain mechanically attached to the substrate by use of a polymer underfill or glob-top. Assemblies of <b>dummy</b> insulated <b>gate</b> bipolar transistor (IGBT) devices were constructed using the In-Sn as a low melting point solder and Nb as a barrier layer, on both device bond pads and connecting wires. Silicone and epoxy based adhesives were used as glob top materials, and alumina was used as the substrate. Thermal cycling carried out between - 20 and + 125 °C lead to rapid joint failure, and analysis of the joints showed that the wires had moved under mechanical tests.

40|$|Electronic {{monitoring}} utilizing process-specific Ring Oscillators (RO) is explored as a {{means of}} identifying, quantifying, and modeling sources of variation in circuit performance due to manufacturing and layout design parameters. This dissertation contains the first measured silicon results for the utilization of parameter-specific modification of ring oscillator layouts to electronically monitor particular process variation. Design and testing for this work were made possible through the Berkeley Wireless Research Center. The working circuits were fabricated by ST Micro in a 45 nm fabrication process that was under development. The design was based on a process design kit provided by ST Micro. The lithography simulation was carried out using generic models in Mentor Graphics Calibre. Five systematic process effects were considered: etch, focus, misalignment, and capping layer and Shallow Trench Isolation (STI) stress. In all cases, inverter layouts were modified in order to increase sensitivity to a particular parameter within design rule constraints. For monitoring etch, {{the presence or absence of}} adjacent <b>dummy</b> <b>gates</b> and pre-correction for residual lithographic effects were used. For monitoring gate focus, spillover functions and Pattern Matching were used as an initial guide to place added surroundings to the gate; this was followed by systematic optimization via Mentor Graphics Calibre simulations. A focus sensitivity of 1. 5 times that of a dense gate was achieved. For monitoring gate-to-active misalignment, a set of 5 pre-programmed offsets on an `H-shaped diffusion' was designed. The RO frequency versus offset relationship in design showed a parabolic shape with a speed up of 3. 2 % for 15 nm misalignment. The capping layer and lateral STI stress monitors were designed based on changes in the lateral size of the source and drain, including those of asymmetrical source/drain areas. Seventeen chips were received, packaged, and automatically tested. The measured range of the across-wafer variation was 11. 1 % for control-case RO with minimum sized gate area. For a given monitor on a typical chip, the variation among the 36 RO instantiations normalized to its mean is 0. 2 - 0. 3 %, with the larger value occurring for the smaller gate areas. When these values were multiplied by the square root of the product of 36 instances time 26 transistors per RO, the average threshold slope (AVT) of 2. 3 mV/um was obtained in an equivalent Pelgrom model. The measured RO frequency sensitivity to gate focus monitors shows that they are about 4 % slower than the control ROs. This decrease is attributed to parasitic effects as well as the non-uniform `hour-glass' shape produced at the top and bottom of the gate from the horizontal extensions used to increase focus sensitivity. The pre-programmed gate-to-active misalignment monitors show a 2 - 4 nm overlay error for 17 chips. The fact that the experimental measurements are less sensitive than predicted during the design stage is in part attributed to the fact that the wafer was run under unusually good control without any programmed treatments such as defocus. This observation is supported by the fact that the measured range of RO frequency was typically centered and 1 / 6 - 1 / 4 th of the SS-FF guard band. The unanticipated requirement to apply strong OPC techniques with scatter-bars to the monitor designs in order to guarantee that they would not impact product yield also resulted in considerable sensitivity loss. The Nitride Contact Etch Stop Liner (CESL) strain-induced monitors show a ring oscillator frequency increase of 5. 3 % and 13. 9 % for 1. 8 X and long length source/drain diffusion (LOD) respectively as compared to minimum LOD, after the normalization of raw data to simulation data so as to correct for parasitic effects. This increase is due to increased CESL-induced strain for large LOD. For the same LOD, asymmetrical designs show a 3 % ring oscillator frequency increase for larger source LOD than that of larger drain LOD, indicating transistor injection velocity as well as mobility is important. The random variation of RO circuit performance for a given layout monitor within a chip is examined for 3 sources of variations: changes in gate length (L), gate oxide thickness (Tox), and channel doping (Nch). The strategy here is to make a linear approximation of the measured RO frequency sensitivity to these 3 parameters under 5 distinct combinations of operating voltages and temperatures using the 45 nm PDK BSIM 4 /PSP models. The strategy is implemented using least mean square (LMS) analysis. For all of the blocks, the LMS results indicate that the source of random within-chip variation is dominated by random dopant fluctuations in comparison with changes in L and Tox...|$|R
40|$|A novel CMP-less {{planarization}} technology {{featuring a}} SOG/LTO (Spin-on Glass /Low-Temperature Oxide) etchback method {{is presented to}} develop a high-performance, low-cost, high-k/metal gate-last (HK/MG-last) integration process. For a special PMD (Pre-Metal Dielectric) poly-open-planarization, a new recessed three-step RIE (Reactive-Ion Etching) etchback process is developed in one process chamber. This method may replace general CMP with certain slurry. An etch-parameter study shows that {{an increase in the}} reaction gas pressure changes the SOG etch profile from convex to concave. This profile is more useful for realizing pseudo-global planarization of the entire PMD structure. The within-the-wafer PMD thickness uniformity reaches 95 %, 5 mm from the wafer edge. By controlling the etch-rate difference between the SOG and LTO, a micro-concave effect on a <b>dummy</b> <b>gate</b> is demonstrated and used as a better selective wet-etching dummy poly-Si gate in TMAH (Tetramethylammonium hydroxide).

40|$|We have {{successfully}} fabricated 0. 1 µm gate GaAs MESFETs using a low cost process. The result {{was obtained from}} optical lithography, resist etching, and ion-implantation technologies based on Single Resist layer <b>Dummy</b> <b>gate</b> (SRD) process. The novel feature of the SRD process is forming a sub-quarter micron gate with conventional optical lithography. We have obtained a 0. 18 µm gate using this process. Achieving a smaller gate length of 0. 1 um is very difficult with this process due to the pattern size shift of the sputtered SiO 2 opening. In this study, we use a collimated sputtering technique in the SRD process to reduce the pattern size shift. As a result, the pattern size shift of the SiO 2 opening decreases to 0. 02 µm allowing a 0. 1 µm gate length to be obtained by using conventional optical lithography. The high-speed performance of fT = 81 GHz and an fmax of 142 GHz are achieved with the refined SRD process. a) b) c) e) f) g) hd...|$|E
