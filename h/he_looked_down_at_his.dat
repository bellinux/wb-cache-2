60|$|<b>He</b> <b>looked</b> <b>down</b> <b>at</b> <b>his</b> feet, thoughtfully {{considering}} the proposition.|$|E
60|$|<b>He</b> <b>looked</b> <b>down</b> <b>at</b> <b>his</b> table-desk, {{fingering}} the starry enameled vase.|$|E
60|$|The colour burned {{once more}} in his cheeks. <b>He</b> <b>looked</b> <b>down</b> <b>at</b> <b>his</b> attire with dissatisfaction.|$|E
60|$|<b>He</b> <b>looked</b> <b>down</b> <b>at</b> her face, luminous, quivering with excitement--and understood.|$|R
60|$|Unclasping {{his arms}} and {{stepping}} back, <b>he</b> <b>looked</b> <b>down</b> <b>at</b> himself.|$|R
60|$|<b>He</b> <b>looked</b> <b>down</b> <b>at</b> the ground, {{his voice}} tailing off into silence.|$|R
60|$|The Duke {{was silent}} for a moment. <b>He</b> <b>looked</b> <b>down</b> <b>at</b> <b>his</b> cigar and then {{suddenly}} up again.|$|E
60|$|<b>He</b> <b>looked</b> <b>down</b> <b>at</b> <b>his</b> companion--her {{eyes were}} lowered; {{he could not}} tell at all what she was {{thinking}} of.|$|E
6000|$|... "I've got no riding things," [...] stammered the castaway, almost {{laughing}} as <b>he</b> <b>looked</b> <b>down</b> <b>at</b> <b>his</b> one suit of well-worn clothes.|$|E
60|$|Still, {{his voice}} faltered somewhat, and <b>he</b> <b>looked</b> <b>down</b> <b>at</b> them inquiringly.|$|R
60|$|<b>He</b> <b>looked</b> <b>down</b> <b>at</b> {{her with}} a quick frown. Decidedly he was annoyed.|$|R
60|$|Victoria {{glanced at}} him with {{interest}} as <b>he</b> <b>looked</b> <b>down</b> <b>at</b> Mr. Meader.|$|R
60|$|Paul's voice quivered and his lip trembled. <b>He</b> <b>looked</b> <b>down</b> <b>at</b> <b>his</b> roses, {{hoping that}} his teacher would not notice the {{tears in his}} eyes.|$|E
60|$|His {{face grew}} dark and stern. <b>He</b> <b>looked</b> <b>down</b> <b>at</b> <b>his</b> poor coat and {{around at the}} motley gallery which reeked {{with the smell of}} tobacco and liquor.|$|E
6000|$|... "Am I {{packing a}} gun?" [...] rejoined Pan, with pretended surprise, as <b>he</b> <b>looked</b> <b>down</b> <b>at</b> <b>his</b> hip. [...] "Sure, so I am. Clean forgot it, Mister. Habit of mine." ...|$|E
60|$|<b>He</b> <b>looked</b> <b>down</b> <b>at</b> me like {{a father}} gazing tenderly at the wayward child.|$|R
60|$|<b>He</b> <b>looked</b> <b>down</b> <b>at</b> a curly {{head and}} a sweet pretty face that he knew.|$|R
60|$|<b>He</b> <b>looked</b> <b>down</b> <b>at</b> her for {{a moment}} as he held her close to him.|$|R
60|$|But, {{the watchful}} little {{dressmaker}} had been vigilant as ever in her watch, and she now {{came up and}} touched Lightwood's arm as <b>he</b> <b>looked</b> <b>down</b> <b>at</b> <b>his</b> friend, despairingly.|$|E
60|$|By and by Grandfather Frog awoke with a start. <b>He</b> <b>looked</b> <b>down</b> <b>at</b> <b>his</b> toes. They {{were not}} in the water at all! Indeed, the water was a good long jump away.|$|E
6000|$|Bradley colored. He was not astute, but hints {{like this}} were {{not far from}} kicks. <b>He</b> <b>looked</b> <b>down</b> <b>at</b> <b>his</b> saw as he said, [...] "I guess I won't go, I've got to study." ...|$|E
60|$|<b>He</b> <b>looked</b> <b>down</b> <b>at</b> Ann and was {{surprised}} to see a joyless thoughtfulness upon her face.|$|R
60|$|Lingard rose. His face cleared, and <b>he</b> <b>looked</b> <b>down</b> <b>at</b> {{the anxious}} Babalatchi with sudden benevolence.|$|R
60|$|When {{the doctor}} came {{in some time}} later <b>he</b> <b>looked</b> <b>down</b> <b>at</b> Aynsley before <b>he</b> turned to Ruth.|$|R
6000|$|... "But am I {{to go in}} this costume, {{or rather}} in this half-naked state?" [...] asked Miles, rising and {{spreading}} out his hands as <b>he</b> <b>looked</b> <b>down</b> <b>at</b> <b>his</b> unclothed chest and lower limbs.|$|E
6000|$|... "If {{you want}} to do {{something}} for me, I'll tell you what," [...] said Charley, eagerly. [...] "I need a new pair of shoes." [...] And <b>he</b> <b>looked</b> <b>down</b> <b>at</b> <b>his</b> foot coverings, which were full of holes.|$|E
60|$|<b>He</b> <b>looked</b> <b>down</b> <b>at</b> <b>his</b> {{crumpled}} shirt-front and disordered tie, {{and then}} moved slowly towards the door. Lady de Vaux hesitated for a moment, with a dark frown upon her face, and then laid her hand upon his arm.|$|E
60|$|<b>He</b> <b>looked</b> <b>down</b> <b>at</b> her, and his {{expression}} softened. He needed comfort, and never was she more welcome to him.|$|R
60|$|<b>He</b> <b>looked</b> <b>down</b> <b>at</b> her. Her {{eyes were}} dark and soft and unfolded, with a {{stricken}} look that roused him.|$|R
60|$|She {{had taken}} her seat. <b>He</b> <b>looked</b> <b>down</b> <b>at</b> her dusky young face. Her voice was always clear and measured.|$|R
6000|$|... "'T ain't that," [...] Tommy {{answered}} with a knuckle in his eye, [...] "'t ain't that as makes me cry." [...] <b>He</b> <b>looked</b> <b>down</b> <b>at</b> <b>his</b> trousers and in a fresh outburst of childish grief he wailed, [...] "It's them!" ...|$|E
60|$|He stopped abruptly, as <b>he</b> <b>looked</b> <b>down</b> <b>at</b> <b>his</b> wife's eyes, and the frown faded. No wonder, {{for that}} wife's eyes were soft and gentle, {{and her face}} was fair and very {{attractive}} as well as refined in expression, though not particularly pretty.|$|E
60|$|So saying, <b>he</b> <b>looked</b> <b>down</b> <b>at</b> <b>his</b> own boots, {{almost in}} hopes that he should find that they needed brushing, in order that he might try the experiment; but they looked very clean and bright, and {{there seemed to be}} no excuse for having them brushed again.|$|E
60|$|They lingered {{a little}} while. Then they stood up upon the sweet thyme, and <b>he</b> <b>looked</b> <b>down</b> <b>at</b> her simply.|$|R
6000|$|Mr. Wendover's smile became {{perfunctory}} as <b>he</b> <b>looked</b> <b>down</b> <b>at</b> her. 'Mrs. Berrington {{has made}} such an amusing request of him.' ...|$|R
60|$|<b>He</b> <b>looked</b> <b>down</b> <b>at</b> her in silence. His {{cheeks were}} pale {{and his eyes}} were grave. Yet there was no anger.|$|R
