5|$|In {{the final}} added minute, Alves handled the ball near the halfway line, and Juventus {{launched}} the resulting free kick towards the Barcelona goal, {{where it was}} cleared. The ensuing counter-attack ended with Neymar scoring with the final <b>kick</b> <b>to</b> make it 3–1.|$|E
5|$|Virginia Tech {{kicked off}} to Texas {{to begin the}} game, and the Longhorns {{returned}} the <b>kick</b> <b>to</b> the 35-yard line. On the first play of the game, Brown attempted to pass downfield, but Tech defended the Texas receivers and Brown scrambled for a four-yard loss. Texas regained the yardage after Tech committed a five-yard offsides penalty, then Longhorns running back Ricky Williams gained six yards on a run up the middle. A third-down pass fell incomplete, and the Longhorns went three and out on the first possession of the game. Texas punted, and the Hokies returned the <b>kick</b> <b>to</b> their 26-yard line.|$|E
5|$|A {{touchdown}} pass reception by end Dale Van Sickel {{of more than}} 30 yards provided another score in the third period, followed by Brumbaugh's extra point <b>kick.</b> <b>To</b> close the third quarter, fullback Rainey Cawthon made a 40-yard broken field run. On the first play of the fourth quarter, Crabtree passed to Brumbaugh for another score, but Brumbaugh's extra point attempt was blocked by the Bulldogs. In {{the middle of the}} fourth quarter, Gator fans rushed the field to tear down the goal posts, and fist fights broke out between Georgia and Florida fans.|$|E
5000|$|Punches, kicks, {{and foot}} sweeps are awarded 1 point. <b>Kicks</b> <b>to</b> {{the head or}} jumping <b>kicks</b> <b>to</b> the body are awarded 2 points. Jumping <b>kicks</b> <b>to</b> the head are awarded 3 points.|$|R

Then left again and 3n <b>kicks</b> <b>to</b> the north, left and 3n <b>kicks</b> <b>to</b> the west. The pattern is {{repeated}} by adding an extra n kicks every second turn, and always turning the same way. If at any stage the diver wants {{to return to}} the start point, he will swim a half leg count followed by the usual turn and anothef half leg count.|$|R

5|$|After a {{successful}} appeal by the British, judges reversed {{the result of}} the match, granting Sarah Stevenson two points for a final round <b>kick</b> <b>to</b> her opponent's head which the judges had previously missed. The reversal of the decision, after video footage was considered, is thought to be a first for the sport. Another British hopeful, Aaron Cook, was also unhappy with the judges after losing out on bronze in the men's −80kg.|$|E
5|$|Following {{the kickoff}} and return, backup Virginia Tech quarterback Jim Druckenmiller entered {{the game to}} guide the Hokies' offense. The first play of the drive, however, was a run by backup running back Ken Oxendine, who gained five yards. Two more runs by Oxendine failed to gain a first down, however, and Virginia Tech punted. Tennessee's Sean Summers {{returned}} the <b>kick</b> <b>to</b> the Volunteers' 40-yard line, and the Volunteers continued trying to run out the clock. Tennessee failed to gain a first down, and the resulting punt rolled {{into the end zone}} for a touchback.|$|E
5|$|Forster had a {{successful}} 2011–12 season with Celtic, winning the Scottish Premier League and helping his team beat the previous season's record of 23 clean sheets. He and Załuska kept 25 clean sheets combined, Forster racking up 21 of them. In December 2011, Hearts were awarded a controversial penalty {{in the final minute}} of a league match at Parkhead, with Celtic leading 1–0. Forster, however, pulled off an excellent save from Eggert Jonsson's penalty <b>kick</b> <b>to</b> secure three important points for Celtic. In total, he kept 26 clean sheets from 47 matches that season.|$|E

5|$|In the National Federation of State High School Associations (NFHS) rulebook, {{the fair}} catch kick is {{specifically}} {{defined as a}} free kick. The National Football League (NFL) rulebook specifically states that the fair catch kick is not a free kick, instead considering the fair catch <b>kick</b> <b>to</b> be a distinct type of kick. Despite this, reporters at both levels describe the fair catch kick as a free kick.|$|E
5|$|On Tech's first {{offensive}} {{play of the}} game, a pass by Tech quarterback Jim Druckenmiller was dropped. During {{the next}} play, Tech picked up four yards on a running play. On third down, Druckenmiller completed a pass to wide receiver Bryan Still, but the play fell one foot short of a first down. Tech punted after three plays, just as Texas had done. Texas returned the <b>kick</b> <b>to</b> its 22-yard line, and with 11:49 remaining in the quarter, the Longhorns began their second possession of the game.|$|E
5|$|Texas {{returned}} the <b>kick</b> <b>to</b> its 32-yard line, {{and on the}} first play from scrimmage, Tech sacked Brown for a loss of nine yards. Williams regained five of the lost yards, but on third down Brown threw an incomplete pass. Texas' punt bounced out of bounds at the 33-yard line, and Virginia Tech's offense returned to the field with 5:30 remaining in the quarter.|$|E

5|$|The first {{nighttime}} {{football game}} was played in Mansfield, Pennsylvania on September 28, 1892 between Mansfield State Normal and Wyoming Seminary and ended at halftime in a 0–0 tie. The Army-Navy game of 1893 saw the first documented use of a football helmet by a player in a game. Joseph M. Reeves had a crude leather helmet made by a shoemaker in Annapolis and wore it in the game after being warned by his doctor that he risked death if he continued to play football after suffering an earlier <b>kick</b> <b>to</b> the head.|$|E
5|$|The teams then {{faced each}} other once more in the FA Cup Final {{at the end of}} the season. The match was largely uneventful as it {{finished}} 0–0 after normal and extra time thus taking it to a penalty shoot-out, the first in cup final history. Scholes missed his penalty for Manchester United, and Vieira converted the decisive <b>kick</b> <b>to</b> win the cup for Arsenal. Reyes became the second player to be sent off in the Cup Final, after his second yellow card in the 120th minute.|$|E
5|$|Anderson {{scored the}} first penalty in sudden death. Kalou then sent Van der Sar {{the wrong way}} to make it 5–5. Giggs was next up and he was also successful. Van der Sar then pulled off the crucial save for United; he pointed to his left to {{indicate}} to Nicolas Anelka that he thought he would <b>kick</b> <b>to</b> that side, as had the six players who had kicked before him, only to correctly dive to his right to deny Anelka, whose kick was at a good height to be saved, securing European football's top prize for United {{for the third time in}} their history.|$|E

5|$|Anfield hosted Manchester City in {{the fifth}} round. It {{was the start of}} a decisive week for Liverpool, as they faced Roma midweek in the UEFA Cup, then Birmingham City in the 2001 Football League Cup Final. Liverpool were awarded a penalty after five minutes, as goalkeeper Nicky Weaver fouled Vladimír Šmicer inside the 18-yard box. Jari Litmanen {{converted}} the spot <b>kick</b> <b>to</b> give Liverpool the lead, which quickly became 2–0 when Heskey's shot found its way past Weaver. Andrei Kanchelskis' goal in the 28th minute halved the scoreline, but Šmicer and Markus Babbel each scored in the second half to put Liverpool in a commanding lead. City persisted and in stoppage time scored their second goal of the match; Shaun Goater's deflected shot did enough to beat goalkeeper Sander Westerveld.|$|E
5|$|As {{a result}} of a {{defensive}} injury crisis at the club, Carrick started the 2012–13 season as a makeshift centre-back. His inexperience in the role was exploited by Everton in the season opener, as Marouane Fellaini beat him to a corner <b>kick</b> <b>to</b> score the only goal of the game. He continued in the role for the next match against Fulham. He scored his first goal of the season in a 1–0 Champions League victory against Galatasaray, after series of ball movement leading to Michael Carrick rounding the goalkeeper to score with his left foot. On 24 November 2012, Carrick was left out the squad that defeated QPR 3–1, ending his run of 33 consecutive league starts.|$|E
5|$|Because Virginia Tech {{received}} {{the ball to}} begin the game, Florida State {{received the}} ball to begin the second half. The Seminoles returned the kickoff to their 22-yard line, and on the first play {{of the second half}} attempted a lateral pass. Virginia Tech defender Corey Moore knocked the ball down and out of bounds, causing a loss of 16 yards. Despite the loss, Weinke was able to make good the needed yards with a 28-yard pass to Minor. Minor picked up short yardage on a run up the middle, then Weinke passed for another first down, advancing the ball to the State 45-yard line. On first down, Weinke fumbled, but managed to recover the ball after a five-yard loss. Unlike before, State was unable to regain the lost yardage and was forced to punt. Virginia Tech returned the <b>kick</b> <b>to</b> their 33-yard line, where the Tech offense began work.|$|E

5|$|Because of his {{excellent}} {{performances in}} leading Juventus {{to win the}} Serie A title, Italy coach Cesare Prandelli included the playmaker in his 32-man provisional squad for Euro 2012, and subsequently in Italy's final 23-man squad for the tournament. Pirlo provided the cutting ball from which Antonio Di Natale scored the opening goal of Italy's 1–1 draw with World and European champions Spain in the opening round of group play on 10 June 2012. Pirlo then opened the scoring himself from a direct free-kick in Italy's second group match against Croatia on 14 June, which also ended in a 1–1 draw; Pirlo was named Man of the Match. In the final group match against Ireland, Pirlo set up Antonio Cassano's goal from a corner <b>kick</b> <b>to</b> help Italy take a 1–0 lead. Italy eventually won 2–0 and progressed to the knock-out stage of the tournament as runners-up in Group C.|$|E
5|$|Before the season, Juventus manager Claudio Ranieri {{remarked that}} Del Piero would have {{as good a}} season, or an even better one, than the {{previous}} term. In August 2008, Del Piero {{announced that he would}} try to keep playing professional football with Juventus until he turned 40. Juventus were drawn into the same Champions League group as Real Madrid, and UEFA Cup winners Zenit Saint Petersburg. Del Piero marked Juventus's return to the competition with a match-winning free <b>kick</b> <b>to</b> seal a home win against Zenit. On 21 October, Del Piero netted a notable goal as Juventus defeated Real Madrid 2–1 in Turin, scoring with a first-time, curling strike from distance, in the fifth minute of play.|$|E
5|$|Before {{the tournament}} commenced, TNA held three preview matches {{involving}} World X Cup participants. The first two were {{featured on the}} June12 episode of Impact!.

The Motor City Machine Guns won when Sabin pinned Doi, after Shelley and Sabin performed a double <b>kick</b> <b>to</b> the face. The second was between Team International's Alex Koslov and Team TNA's Curry Man, which lasted 4 minutes. Koslov won the match by pinfall after a splash from the top rope. TNA held another preview match on the June19 episode of Impact!. In this match, Kaz of Team TNA defeated Koslov after smashing Koslov face-first into the mat with his signature Wave of the Future maneuver.|$|E
