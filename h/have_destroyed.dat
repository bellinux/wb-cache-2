5|$|The Hunter {{was to play}} a {{major role}} during the Indo-Pakistani War of 1965; along with the Gnat the Hunter was India's primary air defence fighter, and {{regularly}} engaged in dogfights with the Pakistani F-86 Sabres and F-104 Starfighters. The aerial war saw both sides conducting thousands of sorties in a single month. Both sides claimed victory in the air war, Pakistan claimed to <b>have</b> <b>destroyed</b> 104 aircraft against its own losses of 19, while India claimed to <b>have</b> <b>destroyed</b> 73 enemy aircraft and lost 35 of its own. Despite the intense fighting, the conflict was effectively a stalemate.|$|E

The US Navy pilots claimed to <b>have</b> <b>destroyed</b> 13 Japanese aircraft. An American pilot who was captured after his plane was shot down at Hong Kong was later murdered by a lethal injection at the Ōfuna prisoner of war camp in Japan.|$|E
5|$|Chopin's tombstone, {{featuring}} the muse of music, Euterpe, weeping over a broken lyre, {{was designed and}} sculpted by Clésinger. The expenses of the funeral and monument, amounting to 5,000 francs, were covered by Jane Stirling, who also paid {{for the return of}} the composer's sister Ludwika to Warsaw. Ludwika took Chopin's heart in an urn, preserved in alcohol, back to Poland in 1850. She also took a collection of two hundred letters from Sand to Chopin; after 1851 these were returned to Sand, who seems to <b>have</b> <b>destroyed</b> them.|$|E
5|$|Cooper's {{early years}} in the {{entertainment}} industry were marred with difficulties. When his role in the second season of Alias was demoted to a minuscule part, he considered quitting show business. His substance addiction, and doubts about his career, triggered thoughts of suicide. Cooper has abstained from alcohol since 2004, remarking that it would <b>have</b> <b>destroyed</b> his life.|$|E
50|$|In a study {{conducted}} in 2012, the Zoological Society of London (ZSL) {{found out that the}} Sunderban coast was retreating up to 200 m in a year.

5|$|It {{must seem}} {{to the reader}} that this Colonel Beriah Norton was a traitor to his own people, but {{what could he do}} but give in to Grey's command! Grey had the force and the power and could <b>have</b> <b>destroyed</b> the towns on the island in half a day, and would have done so if they had {{resisted}} in any way. In the diary, September 12th and 13th are omitted. Those were the days when the British troops were ravaging the island from Edgartown to Gay Head.|$|E
5|$|Persecution of Zoroastrians is the {{religious}} persecution inflicted upon {{the followers of}} the Zoroastrian faith. The persecution of Zoroastrians occurred throughout the religion's history. The discrimination and harassment began {{in the form of}} sparse violence and forced conversions. Muslims are recorded to <b>have</b> <b>destroyed</b> fire temples. Zoroastrians living under Muslim rule were required to pay a tax called Jizya.|$|E
5|$|Ser Alliser Thorne convenes {{the other}} black {{brothers}} and takes responsibility for Jon's murder. Several black brothers accuse Thorne {{and the other}} officers of treason, but Thorne wins them over by citing Jon's actions and stating that Jon would <b>have</b> <b>destroyed</b> the Night's Watch by letting in the Wildlings. Alliser and the other mutineers then surround the store-room and promise Davos and Jon's friends amnesty if they surrender, but threaten to attack if they don't open the door by nightfall.|$|E

5|$|St Michael's Church was {{destroyed}} by an earthquake on 11 September 1275. According to the British Geological Survey, the earthquake was felt in London, Canterbury and Wales, and was reported to <b>have</b> <b>destroyed</b> many houses and churches in England. The force was greater than 7MSK, with its epicentre {{in the area around}} Portsmouth or Chichester, South England.|$|E
5|$|The orphanage is {{currently}} owned by businessman John Ferrara who {{has proposed a}} number of redevelopments on the site, including the building's restoration. The building has been heavily vandalised, {{and a series of}} fires <b>have</b> <b>destroyed</b> much its infrastructure. Ghost tours have been conducted in the building. It has been heritage listed by the Goulburn Mulwaree Council.|$|E
5|$|The plot of Days of Ruin is {{considerably}} darker than, and unrelated to, the plots of previous games. Almost 90% of humanity {{has been killed}} off following devastating meteor strikes which <b>have</b> <b>destroyed</b> much of civilization and caused a massive dust cloud to blot out the sun, preventing photosynthesis and thereby preventing the growing of crops. Scattered survivors pick through the wreckage, and the remnants of several military superpowers patrol the ravaged landscape, some factions protecting the innocent while the others prey upon them.|$|E

5|$|There {{are other}} {{versions}} of the legend. In another telling, Wy'east (Hood) battles Pahto (Adams) for the fair La-wa-la-clough (St. Helens). Or again Wy'east, {{the chief of the}} Multnomah tribe, competed with the chief of the Klickitat tribe. Their great anger led to their transformation into volcanoes. Their battle is said to <b>have</b> <b>destroyed</b> the Bridge of the Gods and thus created the great Cascades Rapids of the Columbia River.|$|E
5|$|Authors and {{military}} analysts {{have speculated that}} had Kingsbury not attacked, the Japanese might <b>have</b> <b>destroyed</b> the battalion. The Japanese had been attacking in waves, and had started to climb a steep hill to outflank the Australians, {{in an effort to}} win the battle. The Australians were low on supplies and the Japanese {{were on the verge of}} breaking through the Australian line. Had they broken through, they would have been able to isolate the battalion's headquarters from the soldiers on the flanks. This would have prevented the Australians from retreating to Alola, allowing the Japanese to overrun them.|$|E
5|$|Due to {{the lack}} of Japanese air {{opposition}} to the American bomber raids, VIIFighter Command was solely tasked with ground attack missions from July. These raids were frequently made against airfields to destroy aircraft being held in reserve to attack the expected Allied invasion fleet. While the P-51 pilots only occasionally encountered Japanese fighters in the air, the airfields were protected by anti-aircraft batteries and barrage balloons. By the end of the war, VIIFighter Command had conducted 51 ground attack raids, of which 41 were considered successful. The fighter pilots claimed to <b>have</b> <b>destroyed</b> or damaged 1,062 aircraft and 254 ships along with large numbers of buildings and railway rolling stock. American losses were 91 pilots killed and 157 Mustangs destroyed.|$|E

5|$|Human {{beings have}} played a role in the ecology of Presque Isle since at least the Erielhonan. The natural drift of sand is {{hindered}} or stopped by breakwaters, permanent structures, and roads. Roads also do not absorb rainwater, causing erosion, and break up natural habitats. Excavations such as those to make the waterworks basins or the marina <b>have</b> <b>destroyed</b> habitats, but yearly artificial replenishment with sand helps to create new ones. One area within the park is closed to all public use from April to November to minimize the impact of humans: it is the easternmost part of the park, Gull Point.|$|E
5|$|In {{contrast}} to their opponents, {{the action of}} 23 August gave the North Vietnamese Air Force their first major victory since Operation Bolo. The USAF’s confirmation {{of the loss of}} ‘Ford 4’ to a MiG aircraft gave Nguyen Van Coc his second air-to-air victory, and he eventually became the leading ace pilot of the war with nine kills. Earlier in the engagement, flight leader Nguyen Nhat Chieu claimed to <b>have</b> <b>destroyed</b> an F-105 with a missile, but the USAF have not confirmed that claim. Nonetheless, Chieu also became a ranking ace pilot with six kills attributed to his name. The USAF also claimed one victory against a MiG-17 fighter, attributed to First Lieutenant David B. Waldrop, but the claim was not confirmed by the North Vietnamese because all their MiG fighters returned to base safely.|$|E
5|$|Information {{obtained}} {{later from}} North Korean prisoners revealed the divisions the Far East Command {{thought to be}} still west of the Naktong had already crossed to the east side and {{were not in the}} bombed area. No evidence was found that the bombing killed a single North Korean soldier. However, the bombing appeared to <b>have</b> <b>destroyed</b> a significant number of North Korean artillery batteries, as artillery fire on UN positions waned substantially following the mission. The UN ground and air commanders opposed future massive carpet bombing attacks against enemy tactical troops unless there was precise information on an enemy concentration and the situation was critical. Instead, they recommended fighter-bombers and dive bombers would better support ground forces.|$|E
