5|$|The {{strategy}} proved successful, {{according to}} Alberts, when the released head-started iguanas reacted to predators, foraged for food, and behaved like their wild-born counterparts. This {{strategy has been}} implemented with great success with other critically endangered species of Cyclura and Ctenosaura throughout the West Indies and Central America, notably the Jamaican <b>iguana,</b> Grand Cayman blue <b>iguana,</b> Ricord's <b>iguana,</b> Allen Cays <b>iguana,</b> Acklins ground <b>iguana,</b> and Anegada <b>iguana.</b>|$|E

In southern countries of their range, such as Peru, green <b>iguanas</b> appear bluish in color with bold blue markings. On islands such as Bonaire, Curaçao, Aruba, and Grenada, a green <b>iguana's</b> color may range from green to lavender, black, and even pink. Green <b>iguanas</b> from the western region of Costa Rica are red and animals of the northern ranges, such as Mexico, appear orange.

5|$|The Cuban <b>iguana</b> is {{distributed}} throughout the rocky southern coastal areas of mainland Cuba and its surrounding islets with a feral population thriving on Isla Magueyes, Puerto Rico. A subspecies is found on the Cayman Islands of Little Cayman and Cayman Brac. Females guard their nest sites and often nest in sites excavated by Cuban crocodiles. As a defense measure, the Cuban <b>iguana</b> often makes its home within or near prickly-pear cacti.|$|E
50|$|In the {{aftermath}} of Hurricane Luis and Hurricane Marilyn in 1995, a raft of uprooted trees carrying fifteen or more green <b>iguanas</b> landed {{on the east side}} of Anguilla - an island where green <b>iguanas</b> have never been recorded before. The new <b>iguanas</b> had apparently been accidentally caught on the trees and rafted two hundred miles across the ocean from Guadeloupe, where green <b>iguanas</b> are indigenous. Examination of the weather patterns and ocean currents indicated that the <b>iguanas</b> had probably spent three weeks at sea before arriving on Anguilla. This colony began breeding on the new island within two years of its arrival.|$|R

5|$|The largest {{terrestrial}} lizard of {{the archipelago}} of Puerto Rico is the Mona ground <b>iguana</b> (Cyclura cornuta stejnegeri). A subspecies of the rhinoceros <b>iguana</b> (Cyclura cornuta), it is endemic to Mona Island, {{located in the}} Mona Passage between the main island of Puerto Rico and the Dominican Republic. Another Cyclura species of similar size, the Anegada ground <b>iguana</b> (Cyclura pinguis), once occurred in the archipelago but it became extirpated due to predation by dogs, cats, and humans, habitat destruction, and competition from goats and pigs, and is now restricted to Anegada. The most common lizard in Puerto Rico is the sharp-mouthed lizard (Anolis pulchellus). The Anolis lizards of Puerto Rico, and the Greater Antilles in general, represent an interesting case of adaptive radiation. Anolis lizards in the Greater Antilles are {{more closely related to}} other species within the same island than to species of adjacent islands. Surprisingly, even though species divergence occurred independently on each island, the same set of ecomorphs (habitat specialists) have evolved on each island.|$|E

5|$|By 1891, Marsh {{published}} a more familiar view of Stegosaurus, {{with a single}} row of plates. This was dropped fairly early on (apparently because it was poorly understood how the plates were embedded in the skin and they were thought to overlap too much in this arrangement).

40|$|We {{investigated}} {{the relationships between}} predator avoidance behavior and predation risk by comparing the wariness of <b>iguanas</b> (Ctenosaura hemilopha) belonging to an island population with few predators with that of <b>iguanas</b> belonging to a mainland population under high predation pressure. We predicted that island <b>iguanas</b> would be less wary than mainland ones. Island <b>iguanas</b> allowed the closer approach of potential predators before their first reaction and fleeing. The responses of both sexes did not differ statistically, except for the frequent displays shown by males as the first reaction. These results suggest that island <b>iguanas,</b> which were probably introduced onto the island by man, have modified their behavior {{in response to a}} decline in predation risk, supporting the hypothesis that predation pressure can contribute to intraspecific variation in antipredator behavior. The results also quantify the tameness of prey on islands without terrestrial predators, and their consequent vulnerability if foraneous predators are introduced. No significant difference was found between the populations in the time needed by frightened <b>iguanas</b> to resume their normal activity, suggesting that the island <b>iguanas</b> could learn to recognize predators and develop a suitable antipredator behaviorPeer reviewe...|$|R

5|$|In {{general the}} species is in decline, more quickly on the {{mainland}} than on the outlying islets. The Cuban mainland populations have been declining {{at a rate of}} over 1% per year for the last 10years.

5|$|The Cuban <b>iguana</b> is {{naturally}} distributed in rocky coastal areas on Cuba and throughout {{as many as}} 4,000 islets surrounding the Cuban mainland, including Isla de la Juventud off the southern coast, which {{has one of the}} most robust populations. Relatively safe populations are found on some islets along the north and south coasts and in isolated protected areas on the mainland. These include Guanahacabibes Biosphere Reserve in the west, Desembarco del Granma National Park, Hatibonico Wildlife Refuge, Punta Negra-Quemados Ecological Reserve, and Delta del Cauto Wildlife Refuge, all in eastern Cuba. Because of this wide distribution, accurate information about the number of distinct subpopulations of Cuban iguanas cannot be determined. The population on the US Naval Base at Guantánamo Bay has been estimated at 2,000 to 3,000 individuals, and the animals are treated well and protected by US forces stationed at the base.

50|$|Marine <b>iguanas</b> {{range from}} 12 to(-) 49 cm in snout-to-vent length {{and have a}} tail length from 17 to(-) 84 cm. There are major {{differences}} between the islands. Average snout-to-vent length on Wolf and Darwin Islands (subspecies jeffreysi) is about 19 cm, and those on Genovesa Island (subspecies nanus) are only slightly larger. In comparison, Santa Cruz marine <b>iguanas</b> (hassi) have an average snout-to-vent length of about 35 cm, and those of Isabela and Fernandina (cristatus) are almost as large. Other subspecies are of intermediate size, in between the small Wolf, Darwin and Genovesa <b>iguanas</b> and the large Santa Cruz, Isabela and Fernandina <b>iguanas.</b>|$|R
5|$|Adults {{make their}} homes within holes in various {{mangrove}} trees and maintain an arboreal existence whereas the young are strictly terrestrial {{for the first}} year of their lives. As the Utila <b>iguana</b> cannot successfully lay its eggs in the mangrove swamps, the gravid females are forced to migrate to nearby sandy beaches in order to bury their clutches of eggs so they can incubate in the hot sun. After digging their nest burrows and laying their eggs, the females abandon the nests and return to the mangroves. Sixty to seventy-four days later the hatchlings emerge and move back to the swamps.|$|E

In comparison, the blue <b>iguana</b> of Grand Cayman's head-bob displays differed from those of the animals on Cuba by only about 20%. The rapid change in display structure between the colony of animals on Isla Magueyes and those on Cuba illustrated the potential of small founding population size as a catalyst to evolution with regard to communication or display.

5|$|Iguanodon teeth are, as {{the name}} suggests, like those of an <b>iguana,</b> but larger.

The upper jaw held up to 29 teeth per side, with none {{at the front of}} the jaw, and the lower jaw 25; the numbers differ because teeth in the lower jaw are broader than those in the upper. Because the tooth rows are deeply inset from the outside of the jaws, and because of other anatomical details, it is believed that, as with most other ornithischians, Iguanodon had some sort of cheek-like structure, muscular or non-muscular, to retain food in the mouth.|$|E

40|$|Although {{glucocorticoid}} hormones {{are considered}} important physiological regulators for surviving adverse environmental stimuli (stressors), evidence {{for such a}} role is sparse and usually extrapolated from glucocorticoid effects under laboratory, short-term and/or non-emergency conditions. Galapagos marine <b>iguanas</b> (Amblyrhynchus cristatus) provide an excellent model for determining the ultimate func-tion of a glucocorticoid response because susceptibility to starvation induced by El Nifto conditions is essentially their only major natural stressor. In a prospective study, we captured 98 adult male marine <b>iguanas</b> and assessed four major components of their glucocorticoid response: baseline corticosterone titres; corticosterone responses to acute stressors (capture and handling); the maximal capacity to secrete corticosterone (via adrenocorticotropin injection); {{and the ability to}} terminate corticosterone responses (negative feedback). Several months after collecting initial measurements, weak El Nifto conditions affected the Galapagos and 23 <b>iguanas</b> died. The dead <b>iguanas</b> were typified by a reduced efficacy ofnega-tive feedback (i. e. poorer post-stress suppression of corticosterone release) compared with surviving <b>iguanas.</b> We found no prior differences between dead and alive <b>iguanas</b> in baseline corticosterone concen-trations, responses to acute stressors, nor in capacity to respond. These data suggest that a greater ability to terminate a stress response conferred a survival advantage during starvation...|$|R
