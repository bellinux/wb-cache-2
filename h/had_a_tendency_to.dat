5|$|Herodian {{describes}} Caracalla {{as having}} preferred northern European clothing, Caracalla being {{the name of}} the short Gaulish cloak that he made fashionable, and he often wore a blond wig. Dio mentions that when Caracalla was a boy, he <b>had</b> <b>a</b> <b>tendency</b> <b>to</b> show an angry or even savage facial expression.|$|E
5|$|The {{lineup of}} the live band <b>had</b> <b>a</b> <b>tendency</b> <b>to</b> change {{drastically}} between major tours: aside from Reznor remaining on lead vocals, keyboards and guitar, no {{member of the}} live band had remained constant since its inception. Reznor cited the long gestation period between studio albums {{as part of the}} reason for these frequent personnel changes, as well as his desire for fresh interpretations of his music.|$|E
5|$|Another {{difficulty}} encountered {{during the}} aircraft's introduction was {{the occurrence of}} surging and stalling with the Avon engines. The F.2, which used the Armstrong-Siddeley Sapphire engine, did not suffer from this issue. Further problems occurred; ejected cannon ammunition links <b>had</b> <b>a</b> <b>tendency</b> <b>to</b> strike and damage {{the underside of the}} fuselage, and diverting the gas emitted by the cannon during firing was another necessary modification. The original split-flap airbrakes caused adverse changes in pitch trim and were quickly replaced by a single ventral airbrake. This meant, however, that the airbrake could not be used for landings.|$|E

50|$|Vapour {{pressure}} is {{the pressure of}} a vapour in thermodynamic equilibrium with its condensed phases in a closed system. All liquids and solids <b>have</b> <b>a</b> <b>tendency</b> <b>to</b> evaporate into <b>a</b> gaseous form, and all gases <b>have</b> <b>a</b> <b>tendency</b> <b>to</b> condense back to their liquid or solid form.|$|R

5|$|Bilinguals {{using two}} {{different}} alphabets should demonstrate a name-letter effect in both alphabets. A weaker effect should {{be found in}} the second alphabet, as names in second alphabets are likely to be less connected to the self. Hoorens and Todorova found that bilinguals with a tendency to like their name letters in Cyrillic also <b>had</b> <b>a</b> <b>tendency</b> <b>to</b> like their name letters in the Roman alphabet. The effect was found to be weaker in the second alphabet. This was replicated in a Thai-English study by Hoorens, Nuttin, Herman and Pavakanun.|$|E
5|$|In {{the early}} twentieth century, the primary legal test used in the United States to {{determine}} if speech could be criminalized was the bad tendency test. Rooted in English common law, the test permitted speech to be outlawed if it <b>had</b> <b>a</b> <b>tendency</b> <b>to</b> harm public welfare. One of the earliest {{cases in which the}} Supreme Court addressed punishment after material was published was Patterson v. Colorado (1907) in which the Court used the bad tendency test to uphold contempt charges against a newspaper publisher who accused Colorado judges of acting on behalf of local utility companies.|$|E
5|$|Like Lovinescu, other {{advocates of}} modernist {{literature}} rejected most of Cerna's contributions. One {{of the first}} to have done so is Ovid Densusianu, who stated his belief that an artist's work should be separated from his life. Lovinescu, who commented on Densusianu and his thoughts on Cerna, opined that Densusianu <b>had</b> <b>a</b> <b>tendency</b> <b>to</b> reject all poets who registered popular success, and that he treated Dimitrie Anghel's work in much the same way.|$|E
40|$|International audienceThe case of Comminges, {{rural area}} of the South of France, allows to see that {{locations}} of food shops and supermarkets changed strongly during the twenty last years. This evolution seems to correspond to a modification of the compromises made between three location logics: a squaring space logic (shops <b>have</b> <b>a</b> <b>tendency</b> <b>to</b> spread regularly in the aim to divide the territory, an accessibility logic (shops <b>have</b> <b>a</b> <b>tendency</b> <b>to</b> locate near major routes) and a synergy logic (shops <b>have</b> <b>a</b> <b>tendency</b> <b>to</b> locate in the aim {{to take advantage of}} the commercial attraction generated by other stores or services) ...|$|R

5|$|Staszic was {{remembered by}} his contemporaries as a loner {{and not a}} person who was quick to make friends. He has been {{described}} as somewhat miserly; despite acquiring significant wealth, he was said to wear old clothes and use an old carriage. He was nonetheless widely respected by his contemporaries. He was seen as stern but honest, and <b>had</b> <b>a</b> <b>tendency</b> <b>to</b> speak in a fashion that some found amusing.|$|E
5|$|Joran van der Sloot {{was born}} in Arnhem, Netherlands. He {{is one of three}} sons born to Paulus van der Sloot (1952–2010), a lawyer, and Anita van der Sloot-Hugen, an art teacher. In 1990, his family moved from Arnhem to Aruba, where he was an honor student at the International School of Aruba. He was {{considered}} a star soccer and tennis athlete at the school. Van der Sloot competed in doubles tennis with his father at the Moët et Chandon Anniversary Cup in 2005 and hoped to play for Saint Leo University near Tampa, Florida. Van der Sloot's mother said he had a problem with lying and <b>had</b> <b>a</b> <b>tendency</b> <b>to</b> sneak out of the house at night to go to casinos.|$|E
5|$|Many {{hypothetical}} extinct macaws {{were based}} only on contemporaneous accounts, but these species are considered dubious today. Several of them were named in the early 20th century by Rothschild, who <b>had</b> <b>a</b> <b>tendency</b> <b>to</b> name species based on little tangible evidence. Among others, the red-headed macaw (Ara erythrocephala) and the Jamaican red macaw (Ara gossei) were named for accounts of macaws on Jamaica, and the Dominican green-and-yellow macaw (Ara atwoodi) was supposedly from Dominica island. The violet macaw (Anodorhynchus purpurascens), which was named for accounts of blue parrots supposedly from Guadeloupe, is now {{thought to have been}} based on references to the Guadeloupe amazon (Amazona violacea).|$|E

5|$|The game {{needed a}} 32 megabit battery backed-up {{cartridge}} to work properly, and was expensive to produce. This factor deterred some publishers, alongside {{the fact that}} launching a new intellectual property was considered risky. WayForward {{tried to find a}} publisher for years, before Capcom eventually picked the game for release. Capcom, however, held back the release for months, during which the Game Boy Advance was released. It is rumored that the game had only one run of 20–25,000 copies. WayForward saw that the console's screen <b>had</b> <b>a</b> <b>tendency</b> <b>to</b> darken the colours, so they took back the game and made further developments on it, incorporating a feature to brighten the screen if played on a Game Boy Advance, alongside some bonus features.|$|E
5|$|The weapon {{consisted}} of a hollow metal tube attached to a tripod, with a rudimentary breech at one end. Rounds were fired {{with the use of}} black powder ignited by a standard musket percussion cap, and it had an effective range of between 100 and 150 yards. Although it was cheap and easy to manufacture, it did have several problems; it was difficult to move and the No. 76 Special Incendiary Grenades it used as one type of ammunition <b>had</b> <b>a</b> <b>tendency</b> <b>to</b> break inside the breech, damaging the weapon and injuring the crew. Production began in late 1940, and by the beginning of 1943 nearly 19,000 were in service. Like many obsolete Home Guard weapons, it was eventually replaced by other weapons, such as the 2-pounder anti-tank gun.|$|E
5|$|Van Grunsven {{first met}} Bonfire {{when he was}} {{two and a half}} years old, having been under saddle for only a week. He was later {{purchased}} by Van Grunsven's father. At first it appeared that the young horse would be a poor prospect, as his hot temperament led to poor gaits. However, he did well at learning advanced dressage moves such as the piaffe and passage, and so Van Grunsven continued to work with him. He improved, and by the time he was seven years old, he was competing at the Grand Prix level. His temperament continued to lead to difficult rides, and he <b>had</b> <b>a</b> <b>tendency</b> <b>to</b> spook at small items near the ring; these tendencies decreased as he grew older.|$|E

50|$|The Pollyanna {{principle}} (also called Pollyannaism or positivity bias) is the <b>tendency</b> {{for people}} <b>to</b> remember pleasant items more accurately than unpleasant ones. Research indicates {{that at the}} subconscious level, the mind <b>has</b> <b>a</b> <b>tendency</b> <b>to</b> focus on the optimistic; while at the conscious level, it <b>has</b> <b>a</b> <b>tendency</b> <b>to</b> focus on the negative. This subconscious bias towards the positive {{is often described as}} the Pollyanna principle.|$|R
5|$|Rear Admiral John P. Whitney {{requested}} Shepard's {{services as}} an aide de camp, but Shepard wanted to fly. Therefore, at Shepard's request, Ramage spoke to the admiral on his behalf, and Shepard was instead sent back to Patuxent. He flight tested the McDonnell F3H Demon, Vought F-8 Crusader, Douglas F4D Skyray and Grumman F-11 Tiger. The Vought F7U Cutlass <b>had</b> <b>a</b> <b>tendency</b> <b>to</b> go into an inverted spin during a snap roll. This was not unusual; many aircraft did this, but normally if the pilot {{let go of the}} stick the aircraft would correct itself. When he attempted this in the F7U, Shepard found this was not the case. He was unable {{to break out of the}} spin and was forced to eject. In 1957, he was project test pilot on the Douglas F5D Skylancer. Shepard did not like the plane, and gave it an unfavorable report. The Navy cancelled orders for it, buying the F8U instead. He also filed an unfavorable report on the F11F after a harrowing incident in which the engine failed on him during a high-speed dive. Fortunately, he managed to restart the engine.|$|E
5|$|The QF 25-pounder Short {{received}} a mixed reception from gunners, and was particularly unpopular {{among members of}} AIF artillery units which had used the standard 25-pounder during the fighting in the Middle East. Guns were sometimes put out of action by damage caused by the absorption of violent recoil. The gun also <b>had</b> <b>a</b> <b>tendency</b> <b>to</b> tilt at low elevation; this was remedied by its crew standing on the trails, an expedient {{that had previously been}} used with the QF 4.5 inch Howitzer. Other limitations included a low rate of fire (three or four rounds per minute) and difficulties towing the weapon. Concerns were also raised over the quality of workmanship, and the commander of the 2/4th Field Regiment rejected a batch of Short 25-pounders sent to his unit before the Nadzab operation in the belief that they had been poorly manufactured. Inspectors subsequently concluded that most of his criticisms were unfounded, however. The most important deficiency compared to the regular 25-pounder was the shorter range. As a result of its experience with the gun, the 9th Division recommended that they be pooled and reserved for their special role rather than be employed in a day-to-day role alongside the regular 25 pounder.|$|E
5|$|As the new {{ball was}} due {{soon after the}} start of the play, Johnson and Toshack opened the attack as Bradman saved Johnston and Miller. In his first over, Johnson {{extracted}} sharp turn from one delivery that pitched outside off stump; not expecting much spin, Compton did not play a shot and was hit on the pads, but the umpire rejected the loud appeal for lbw. Otherwise, Hutton and Compton progressed steadily before the light deteriorated, although Johnson and Toshack were able to make the ball deviate regularly. Despite this, Bradman opted to have Miller take the new ball in the fifth over of the day {{as soon as it was}} available. Mindful of recent events, Miller refrained from bouncers during the morning. In the overcast conditions, Miller bowled a relatively full length and swung the ball; one of his deliveries beat Hutton and narrowly missed his stumps. At the other end, Johnston was also able to make the ball move sideways. Meanwhile, Compton appeared to be untroubled by the bowling. After half an hour of play, an unsuccessful appeal against the light was made as dark clouds hovered overhead. The rejection of the appeal made little difference, as a thunderstorm stopped proceedings for five minutes soon after. Shortly after the resumption, Miller bowled Hutton with an off cutter in the dark conditions, ending the 111-run partnership at 150/3. Hutton had made 74 runs in 168 minutes with 11 fours, and as in the first innings, he played forward to a ball without getting his front foot close to the bat, resulting in the delivery moving through the gap into the stumps. The wicket prompted the entrance of Hardstaff, and on the third ball he aimed a cut at a wide Miller delivery, and it again went low to second slip as in the first innings. However, this time Morris was in the position and the catch was dropped. It was part of an eventful over during which Hardstaff had many near-misses. He played and missed at one ball, inside edged another into his pads and edged another through the slips for two runs. Hardstaff had a reputation for being an uncertain starter, especially as he <b>had</b> <b>a</b> <b>tendency</b> <b>to</b> poke at deliveries outside his off stump, and the poor visibility further hindered him.|$|E

[...] Although they have high metabolic rates, they <b>have</b> <b>a</b> <b>tendency</b> <b>to</b> be sedentary and allow currents to carry them as they swim.
