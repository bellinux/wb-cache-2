For in vitro study, adipocytes isolated from epidydimal fat were incubated with 10 ^ to 10 ^ M isoproterenol and <b>freed</b> <b>glycerol</b> content was measured as an index of lipolysis.

40|$|Drosophila melanogaster has {{recently}} {{emerged as a}} useful model system in which to study the genetic basis of regulation of fat storage. One {{of the most frequently}} used methods for evaluating the levels of stored fat (triglycerides) in flies is a coupled colorimetric assay available as a kit from several manufacturers. This is an aqueous-based enzymatic assay that is normally used for measurement of mammalian serum triglycerides, which are present in soluble lipoprotein complexes. In this short communication, we show that coupled colorimetric assay kits cannot accurately measure stored triglycerides in Drosophila. First, they fail to give accurate readings when tested on insoluble triglyceride mixtures with compositions like that of stored fat, or on fat extracted from flies with organic solvents. This is probably due to an inability of the lipase used in the kits to efficiently cleave off the glycerol head group from fat molecules in insoluble samples. Second, the measured final products of the kits are quinoneimines, which absorb visible light in the same wavelength range as Drosophila eye pigments. Thus, when extracts from crushed flies are assayed, much of the measured signal is actually due to eye pigments. Finally, the lipoprotein lipases used in colorimetric assays also cleave non-fat glycerides. The glycerol backbones liberated from all classes of glycerides are measured through the remaining reactions in the assay. As a consequence, when these assay kits are used to evaluate tissue extracts, the observed signal actually represents the amount of <b>free</b> <b>glycerols</b> together with all types of glycerides. For these reasons, findings obtained through use of coupled colorimetric assays on Drosophil...|$|R

40|$|AbstractThis paper {{proposes a}} flow-batch {{methodology}} for {{the determination of}} <b>free</b> <b>glycerol</b> in biodiesel that is notably eco-friendly, since non-chemical reagents are used. Deionized water (the solvent) was used alone for glycerol (sample) extractions from the biodiesel. The same water was used to generate water-cavitation sonoluminescence signals, which were modulated by the quenching effect associated {{with the amount of}} extracted glycerol. The necessarily reproducible signal generation was achieved by using a simple and inexpensive piezoelectric device. A linear response was observed for glycerol within the 0. 001 – 100 mg/L range, equivalent to 0. 004 – 400 mg/kg <b>free</b> <b>glycerol</b> in biodiesel. The lowest measurable concentration of <b>free</b> <b>glycerol</b> was estimated at 1. 0 µg/L. The selectivity of the proposed method was confirmed by comparing the shape and retention of both real and calibration samples to standard solution chromatograms, presenting no peaks other than glycerol. All samples (after extraction) are greatly diluted; this minimizes (toward non-detectability) potential interference effects. The methodology was successfully applied to biodiesel analysis at a high sampling rate, with neither reagent nor solvent (other than water), and with minimum waste generation.

After glucose ingestion (40 g/m 2), normal glucose tolerance in the patients was maintained at the expense of a heightened plasma insulin response, suggesting the presence of insulin resistance. During graded, local (intra-arterial) hyperinsulinemia encompassing the physiological range (12 - 120 milliunits/l), glucose uptake by forearm tissues was significantly (p less than 0. 03) reduced in the hypertensive subjects as compared with the controls at each of five insulin steps, by 43 % on the average. In addition, forearm lactate and pyruvate release were significantly less stimulated in the hypertensive than in the normotensive group (p less than 0. 01 for both), presumably as a consequence of the decreased glucose influx.
