40|$|This review {{discusses}} some of {{the parameters}} that influence the content of polyphenols in red wine. Best quality grapes, sunny weather and late harvest increases the total phenolic content in wine as well as high-phenolic content grape cultivar. Nevertheless, if the extraction technique is not efficient the resulting wine will be poor in these compounds. Mash heating followed by <b>fermentation</b> <b>on</b> <b>skin,</b> pre-fermentating enzymatic treatment and long maceration time are processes increasing the concentration of polyphenols in the resulting wine while oxygen supply during storage reduces the total content of low molecular weight phenolic compounds and increases the polyphenols polymers that only seems to stabilize the wine’s color...|$|R
40|$|Solaris {{is a new}} disease {{tolerant}} cultivar increasingly {{cultivated in}} cool climate regions. In order to explore the winemaking processes’ potential to make different styles of Solaris wines, the effects of different pre-fermentation treatments (direct press after crushing, whole cluster press, cold maceration, and <b>skin</b> <b>fermentation)</b> <b>on</b> the volatile profile, chemical, and sensory properties of Solaris wines were investigated. Cold maceration treatment for 24 h and <b>fermentation</b> <b>on</b> <b>skin</b> led to wines with lower acidity and higher glycerol and total polyphenol indexes. Sensory analysis showed that cold maceration enhanced “apricot” and “apple” flavor while skin fermentation gave rise to increased “rose” and “elderflower” flavor. The PLS regression model revealed that fruity flavor of cold macerated wines was related {{to a combination of}} esters while β-damascenone and linalool were correlated to the “rose” and “elderflower” flavor.

40|$|Mestrado Vinifera EuroMaster - Instituto Superior de AgronomiaThe aim of {{this study}} was to {{understand}} the effects of different maceration winemaking techniques on the phenolic composition of red grapevine variety ‘Tempranillo’ (Vitis vinifera L.). Experimental winemaking included 4 different treatments with 3 replicates. (5 days pre-fermentation maceration at 11 °C, fermentation without any pre-fermentation or post-fermentation extended maceration (control wines), and 3 - and 6 -days post- <b>fermentation</b> extended maceration <b>on</b> <b>skins).</b> Spectroscopic and RP-HPLC analysis were used to determine changes in phenolic components and between treatments during the alcoholic fermentation, and as they aged in the bottle. It was determined if the wines made with pre-fermentation maceration had increased color intensity compared to the control wines, as well as if the wines that underwent extended maceration had increased concentration of (+) -catechin and (-) -epicatechin, increased color hue, decreased color intensity compared to the control wines. Prolonging the maceration from 7 to 10 and 13 days, lead to significantly higher concentrations of total phenolics, and the monomeric flavan- 3 -ols, (+) -catechin and (-) -epicatechin, and lead to a significant decrease of the total anthocyanins. Further investigation is needed in order to analyse the effect of the phenolic, tannin’s and anthocyannin’s composition on the quality of the wine in terms of color stabilization and mouth-feel. Post-fermentation EM reduced wine colour intensity and imparted a browner hue to the wine compared to the Control wine. This EM treatment is therefore unlikely to benefit winemakers who are seeking to produce highly coloured wines. However, post-fermentation extended maceration increased the concentration of wine flavan- 3 -ols ((+) -catechin and (-) -epicatechin). Therefore, the winemakers by varying the duration of post-fermentation EM may influence the desired balance between the extraction of these wine phenolics and the mouth-feel properties, taking into consideration the economic facto...|$|R
40|$|It is {{estimated}} that 80 percent of all people {{between the ages of}} 11 and 30 have acne outbreaks. While especially teenagers are very concerned with the problem, the reasons for it can be further investigated. Very little research has been done on possible bacterial interference <b>on</b> <b>skin</b> between Propionibacterium acnes, which causes acne and Staphylococcus aureus, an opportunistic bacteria that lives <b>on</b> <b>skin.</b> Therefore, the objective of this extended essay is to investigate a possible relationship between acnes and carrying Staphylococcus aureus <b>on</b> <b>skins</b> of teenagers. This essay examines to what extent carrying Staphylococcus aureus <b>on</b> <b>skin</b> affects the number and distribution of acnes and pimples. The research question being investigated was: “Is there any positive correlation between having Staphylococcus aureus <b>on</b> <b>skin</b> of adolescent people and formation of acne outbreaks on their skin?” It was hypothesized that; the number and dispersal of adolescent acnes <b>on</b> <b>skin</b> doesn’t change the probability to carry Staphylococcus aureus <b>on</b> <b>skin.</b> In order to test the hypothesis and to answer the research question, volunteer students were grouped into 4 categories considering their gender, age and whether they have acnes <b>on</b> <b>skin</b> or not. Bacterial samples were collected from the skin flora of these students, Staphylococcus aureus population was cultured on blood agar plate and left for incubation of 24 hours in laboratory conditions. Resultantly, five out of twenty students were carriers of Staphylococcus aureus <b>on</b> <b>skin.</b> Four of the carriers were selected as students without acne <b>on</b> <b>skin,</b> whereas only one belonged to the group that represented students with acnes.

40|$|Thesis (MSc (Wine Biotechnology)) [...] University of Stellenbosch, 2006. Resveratrol is a {{phytoalexin}} that {{is produced}} in the leaves and skins of grape berries in response to biotic and abiotic factors. Substitution and polymerisation of resveratrol units produce an array of compounds which form part of the active disease defence mechanism in grapevine. Wine {{is one of the}} major sources of resveratrol in the human diet. Resveratrol is one of the phenolic compounds present in wine that mediates protective effects on human health. It has been shown to prevent the development of cardiovascular disease, cancer and pathogenesis related to inflammation. Red wines contain higher levels of resveratrol than white wines owing to extended maceration times during <b>fermentation</b> <b>on</b> the <b>skins.</b> During white wine vinification skin contact is limited as skins are removed prior to fermentation. Thus, the extraction of resveratrol into white wines is minimal. The principal focus of our research is the development of a wine yeast strain capable of resveratrol production during grape must fermentation. It is proposed that red and white wines produced with such a resveratrol-producing yeast will contain elevated levels of resveratrol, and that added health benefits may be derived from their consumption. Initial work done in our laboratory established that expressing multiple copies of the genes encoding coenzyme A ligase (4 CL 216) and resveratrol synthase (vst 1) in laboratory yeast enabled the yeast to produce resveratrol, conditional to the supplementation of the growth medium with p-coumaric acid. This study focused on the optimisation of resveratrol production in Saccharomyces cerevisiae. It involved the integration and constitutive expression of 4 CL 216 from hybrid poplar and vst 1 from grapevine. Integration and expression of these genes in three laboratory strains was confirmed by Southern and Northern blot analyses. The evaluation of resveratrol production by yeast required the initial optimisation of the analytical techniques. We optimised the method for sample preparation from the intracellular fraction of yeast and devised a procedure for the assay of the extracellular fractions. The LCMSMS method was further developed to encompass detection and quantification of other compounds related to resveratrol production in yeast. Comparison of resveratrol production in three different yeast genetic backgrounds indicated that the onset of production and the resveratrol yield is yeast strain dependent. Precursor feeding studies indicated that p-coumaric acid availability was a factor limiting maximal resveratrol production. Early indications were obtained that endogenously-produced resveratrol may have an impact on yeast viability during extended culture periods. This study has broadened our understanding of the resveratrol production dynamics in S. cerevisiae and provided important indications as to where further optimisation would be beneficial in order to optimally engineer a wine yeast for maximal resveratrol production...|$|R
30|$|A higher butanol/acetone {{ratio of}} {{approximately}} 2.9 : 1 {{was observed in}} extractive <b>fermentation</b> <b>on</b> cassava-based substrate, which had a 64 % increment compared to that on corn-based substrate. The results from metabolic flux and transcriptional analysis indicated that the weakened metabolic fluxes in organic acids (especially butyrate) formation/re-assimilation pathways, {{as well as the}} enhancement of NADH generation, contributed to this higher butanol/acetone ratio feature in <b>fermentation</b> <b>on</b> cassava. Moreover, neutral red added in cassava broth could not further increase butanol/acetone ratio, which demonstrated that a further higher butanol/acetone ratio could be realized only when NADH regeneration is enhanced and the metabolic fluxes in organic acid formation/reutilization routes are controlled at suitably low levels simultaneously.|$|R
