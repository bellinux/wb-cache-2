5|$|After {{leaving the}} main line {{immediately}} south of Hellingly, the railway passed over gated level crossings at Park Road and New Road. Farm Siding, a single siding on {{the west of the}} line beyond the crossings, was a collection point for the farm's agricultural produce {{in the early years of}} the railway, but later fell out of use. The line climbed most of the way from <b>here</b> <b>to</b> the hospital at 1 in 50. About halfway between Hellingly and the hospital the line entered the hospital grounds, passing to the west of Park House Siding, which served the hospital's Park House annexe.|$|E
5|$|After passing Carlyon Bay {{the path}} {{comes to the}} much busier china-clay {{exporting}} port of Par, where it goes inland of the dock site. After passing through the village the path regains the coast at Par Sands and links with the Saints' Way, a coast-to-coast path across Cornwall, at Polmear. It then follows the cliff tops through Polkerris and around Gribbin Head. From <b>here</b> <b>to</b> Polperro is designated as a heritage coast.|$|E

5|$|In the 1930 {{renumbering}} {{of state}} highways in New York, NY35 was extended northeast from Canawaugus (west {{of the village}} of Avon) to Ontario by way of Scottsville, Rochester, and Walworth. NY35 entered Rochester on Scottsville Road and followed Genesee and Main streets through the city. At {{the east end of}} Main Street, NY35 turned south and followed Winton Road to Blossom Road. It curved eastward <b>here</b> <b>to</b> follow Blossom Road east to Browncroft Boulevard in Penfield. At some point between 1934 and 1938, an alternate route of NY35 along the portion of Browncroft Boulevard between Winton and Blossom Roads was designated NY35B.|$|E

5|$|Past Lone Pine, {{the highway}} passes by Manzanar National Historic Site, a {{concentration}} camp where Japanese Americans were imprisoned during World War II. The next community is Independence, the county seat of Inyo County and the home to the Eastern California Museum. Just north is the small Fort Independence Indian Reservation and the Tinemaha Reservoir. Nearby is where the Los Angeles Aqueduct is tapped from the Owens River; with more vegetation visible north of this point. In {{this portion of the}} valley is Big Pine and the Big Pine Indian Reservation. From <b>here</b> <b>to</b> Bishop the highway is overlapped with SR 168.|$|E
5|$|Preceding {{an atomic}} line filter {{may be a}} collimator, which {{straightens}} incident light rays for passing {{through the rest of}} the filter consistently; however, collimated light is not always necessary. After the collimator, a high-pass filter blocks almost half of the incoming light (that of too long a wavelength). In Faraday and Voigt filters, the first polarizing plate is used <b>here</b> <b>to</b> block light.|$|E

5|$|Since {{dance is}} already an art form, “weapon dance as art” may seem redundant; yet, “art” is used <b>here</b> <b>to</b> mean the re-creation, say, of a folk weapon dance {{in a more}} {{professional}} staged venue, such as a ballet, or when an Australian, Native American, or African troupe of professional musicians and dancers present a reenactment on stage of a weapon dance, or when the use of weapons is introduced in stylized dance enactments of fighting. For example, recent ballets such as the New York City Ballet’s version of Romeo and Juliet (to the music of Sergei Prokofiev) employ highly choreographed sword-fight/dance sequences.|$|E
5|$|The ACLU lost an {{important}} press censorship case when, in 1957, the Supreme Court upheld the obscenity conviction of publisher Samuel Roth for distributing adult magazines. As late as 1953, {{books such as}} Tropic of Cancer and From <b>Here</b> <b>to</b> Eternity were still banned. But public standards rapidly became more liberal though the 1960s, and obscenity was notoriously difficult to define, so by 1971 prosecutions for obscenity had halted.|$|E
5|$|The {{basis of}} the musical is the 1951 novel From <b>Here</b> <b>to</b> Eternity by James Jones. In 1941, Jones was serving with the US Army in Hawaii, {{at the time of}} Pearl Harbor, and the novel was loosely based on his {{experiences}} in the 27th Infantry Regiment. It focuses on the lives of a group of soldiers {{in the months leading up}} to the attack, in particular Private Prewiit, a boxer who no longer wants to fight having blinded an opponent, and Sergeant Milt Warden, who has an affair with the wife of his commanding officer.|$|E
