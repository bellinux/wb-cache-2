40|$|Accepted for {{publication}} in JEP:LMC Two experiments were conducted that provide {{a test of the}} predicted interaction between within-category discontinuity and verbal rule complexity on the efficiency of the neurobiologically-motivated procedural-based and hypothesis-testing category learning systems, and by extension, on information-integration and rule-based category learning. In Experiment 1, within-category discontinuity adversely affected information-integration category learning but not rule-based category learning. Model based analyses of the information-integration data suggested that some participants improved performance by recruiting more “units ” in the <b>discontinuous</b> <b>condition.</b> Even so, participants in the <b>discontinuous</b> <b>condition</b> evidenced more sub-optimal unit placement, less deterministic responding or both. In Experiment 2, verbal rule complexity adversely affected rule-based category learning but not information-integration category learning. Model-based analyses of the rule-based data suggested that the effect was on both decision criterion learning and the variability associated with the memory for, and trial-by-trial application of, the decision criteria. Transfer performance suggested that the hypothesis-testing system learns an abstract rule and can generalize to parts of the stimulus space that were not trained, whereas the procedural-based learning system learns to assign categorization responses to regions of perceptual space and does not generalize well to untrained parts of the stimulus space. These results suggest that within-category discontinuity and decision rule complexity differentially impact information-integration and rule-based category learning, and provide information regarding the detailed processing characteristics of these two proposed category learning systems...|$|R

In the positive half line, the inverse scattering problem for the Dirac operator with discontinuous coefficient was analyzed in [19]. Besides, in a finite interval, for Sturm-Liouville operator inverse problem has widely been developed (see [20 – 22]). The inverse problem of the Sturm-Liouville operator with discontinuous coefficient was worked out in [23, 24] and <b>discontinuous</b> <b>conditions</b> inside an interval were obtained in [25]. In the mathematical and physical literature, the direct and inverse problems for the Dirac operator are widespread, so there are numerous investigations as regards the Dirac operator.

40|$|The {{recently}} developed wave based technique {{for the analysis}} of vibro-acoustic problems is a promising prediction tool aiming to bridge the existing mid-frequency gap. Instead of simple polynomial shape functions, this method adopts an indirect Trefftz approach in which it uses the exact solutions of the governing differential equation for the field variable approximations. Since a fine discretization is no longer required, the resulting wave based models are substantially numerically smaller than the element based counterparts. However, the prediction accuracy tends to deteriorate in case of a <b>discontinuous</b> boundary <b>condition.</b> This paper reports on the basic concepts of an enrichment strategy, which has been introduced in order to preserve the favourable computational efficiency of the wave based approach. The basic idea of the proposed approach is to enrich the original wave function set with some novel functions, which inherently satisfy the governing differential equation and a priori incorporate the <b>discontinuous</b> boundary <b>condition.</b> The resulting efficiency improvements are demonstrated by a two-dimensional validation example. ...|$|R

40|$|In this work, {{according}} {{to the concept of}} area' on the v-i plane, a new approach called swept area theory, under both nonlinear continuous and <b>discontinuous</b> <b>conditions,</b> is developed. Novel conservative functions, such as area velocity and closed area over time (CAT), involved in this theory, are proposed. An analysis is carried out, by means of these functions, over nonlinear R, L, and C elements and over the ideal switch. In addition, jump discontinuities are discussed in detail. The CAT is related to the harmonic reactive powers and under sinusoidal steady state becomes proportional to the classical reactive power. A balance rule concerning harmonic reactive powers over nonlinear resistor under continuous conditions is obtained and discussed as a novel interesting result. This aspect impacts on a possible expanded definition of reactive power under distorted conditions. Thanks to the switching power, a novel quantitative relation between hard-switching commutations and CAT is obtained, with both theoretical and applicative relevance. More explanation is presented through a demonstration that shows how an ideal switch and power converters can become sources of reactive power. Issues of principle regarding the ideal switch model with respect to the real one are another important result of this work...|$|E
40|$|The Gibbs {{phenomenon}} in Fourier series {{has long been}} recognized as a drawback in its applications, in particular when {{it is used to}} represent a function having discontinuities. One category, namely, intrinsic discontinuities, could be derived from the nature of the physical problems. Another, namely, inherent discontinuities, is created undesirably through the employment of Fourier series. To alleviate these drawbacks, two techniques are developed. The first aims at eliminating the inherent discontinuities. The size of the original domain [0, l] is first doubled with a virtual function φ 0 defined over the neighboring domain [-l, 0]. The augmented domain [-l, l] is then further extended periodically. The virtual function φ 0 (y) is chosen so that continuities are achieved at y= 0, ±l, ± 2 l, [...] Consequently, no Gibbs phenomena will occur at the boundaries. The second aims at reproducing the intrinsic discontinuities in the representation function by incorporating piecewise cubic polynomials into the Fourier base function. The enlarged basis function, namely, the Gibbs-phenomenon-free-Fourier-series function, is able to represent accurately any specific boundary conditions and interior intrinsic <b>discontinuous</b> <b>conditions.</b> Examples of vibration and buckling analysis of complex beams show that the present method is versatile, accurate, and efficient. link_to_subscribed_fulltex...|$|E
30|$|Biofiltration is {{generally}} considered a cost-saving and environmentally friendly approach for the abatement of air pollution (Leson and Winer 1991; Nikiema et al. 2007). Many efforts {{have been made to}} optimize the configuration of bioreactors to enhance their overall performance (Irvine and Moe 2001; Kim et al. 2005). Effects of various environmental factors such as EBRT, pH, temperature, moisture content, and pressure drop, as well as the microbial communities inside, have been extensively studied (Baquerizo et al. 2009; Cabrol et al. 2012; Pérez et al. 2016; Copelli et al. 2017; Ordaz et al. 2018). These studies were conducted under steady conditions. However, many actual emission sources generate waste gases in a discontinuous mode, and the performance of bioreactors under this unsteady condition has been rarely reported (Lee et al. 2009; Lebrero et al. 2013; San-Valero et al. 2013; Alinejad et al. 2017). According to Qi and Moe (2006), a biofilter operated under discontinuous mode required more time to adapt to the pollutants compared with one that was continuously fed with pollutants. There are still large uncertainties concerning the impact of discontinuous mode on the removal performance, function and composition of microbial communities as well as biofilm formation, especially under <b>discontinuous</b> <b>conditions</b> from the beginning of operation.
