500|$|The Australasian fairy tern is {{described}} as [...] "vulnerable". Disturbance by humans, dogs and vehicles, predation by introduced species and inappropriate water level management in South Australia are {{the main reasons for}} its decline. Five species are [...] "near threatened", indicating less severe concerns or only potential vulnerability. The <b>elegant</b> <b>tern</b> is so categorised because 95% of the population breeds on one island, Isla Rasa in the Gulf of California, and the Kerguelen tern has a population of less than 5,000 adults breeding on small and often stormy Pacific islands. Three species, the Inca, Damara, and river terns, are expected to decline in the future due to habitat loss and disturbance. Some tern subspecies are endangered, including the California least tern and the Easter Island race of the grey noddy.|$|E

50|$|In {{various parts}} of its range, the royal tern could be {{confused}} with the <b>elegant</b> <b>tern,</b> lesser crested tern (the other orange-billed terns), and the greater crested tern. It is paler above than lesser crested tern and the yellow-billed great crested tern. The <b>elegant</b> <b>tern</b> has a longer more curved bill and shows more white on the forehead in winter.|$|E

50|$|This is a medium-large tern, with a long, slender orange bill, pale grey upperparts {{and white}} underparts. Its legs are black. In winter, the {{forehead}} becomes white. Juvenile <b>elegant</b> <b>terns</b> have a scalier pale grey back. The call is a characteristic loud grating noise like a Sandwich tern.|$|R
50|$|The anchovy is a {{significant}} food source for almost every predatory fish in its environment, including the California halibut, rock fish, yellowtail, shark, chinook, and coho salmon. It is also extremely important to marine mammals and birds; for example, breeding success of California brown pelicans and <b>elegant</b> <b>terns</b> is strongly connected to anchovy abundance.|$|R

50|$|Identification of orange-billed terns {{within their}} range is straightforward. Crested and Cayenne terns (which do not overlap in range) can be {{identified}} by their bill colour. Of the truly orange-billed species, the only geographical overlaps are between royal and lesser crested, and between royal and <b>elegant</b> <b>Terns,</b> and {{in both cases the}} larger size and strong bill of royal tern should prevent misidentifications (in addition, lesser crested terns have a grey, not white, rump).|$|R
500|$|Like many birds, seabirds often migrate {{after the}} {{breeding}} season. Of these, the trip {{taken by the}} Arctic tern is the farthest of any bird, crossing the equator in order to spend the Austral summer in Antarctica. Other species also undertake trans-equatorial trips, both from the north to the south, and from south to north. The population of <b>elegant</b> <b>terns,</b> which nest off Baja California, splits after the breeding season with some birds travelling north to the Central Coast of California and some travelling {{as far south as}} Peru and Chile to feed in the Humboldt Current. The sooty shearwater undertakes an annual migration cycle that rivals that of the Arctic tern; birds that nest in New Zealand and Chile and spend the northern summer feeding in the North Pacific off Japan, Alaska and California, an annual round trip of [...]|$|R
40|$|During 1998 and 1999 I {{monitored}} waterbirds nesting on Isla San Jorge, at La Purinera and on Isla Montague, in {{the northern}} Gulf of California, as well as sea lions on Isla San Jorge. During El Niño the brown boobies on San Jorge ceased breeding and left the island, coinciding with an influx of several thousand blue-footed boobies. El Niño conditions coincided {{with an increase in}} the numbers of nesting least, <b>elegant,</b> and royal <b>terns</b> and black skimmers on Montague. Double-crested cormorants on San Jorge, least terns on La Purinera, and snowy egrets, black-crowned night-herons, laughing gulls, and gull-billed terns on Montague did not seem affected by this event. Sea lions at San Jorge about doubled their number, but the number of pups did not increase. La Niña conditions coincided with a return to population levels before El Niño in all these species. During 1999 Heermann’s gulls and Brandt’s cormorants nested on San Jorge. Heermann’s gulls had stopped breeding there long ago, and Brandt’s cormorants had never been know to nest there...|$|R

50|$|This is a medium-large tern, 37 - 43 cm {{long with}} an 85 - 97 cm wingspan, which is {{unlikely}} to be confused within most of its range, although the South American race could be confused with the <b>elegant</b> <b>tern.</b>|$|E
50|$|The Sandwich tern (Thalasseus sandvicensis) is a tern in {{the family}} Laridae. It is very {{closely related to the}} lesser crested tern (T. bengalensis), Chinese crested tern (T. bernsteini), Cabot's tern (T. acuflavidus), and <b>elegant</b> <b>tern</b> (T. elegans) and has been known to interbreed with the lesser crested.|$|E
50|$|The grey rump is {{a useful}} flight {{identification}} feature distinguishing it from the related species. The <b>Elegant</b> <b>tern</b> also differs in a slightly longer, slenderer bill, while Chinese crested tern differs in a black tip to the bill and Sandwich tern a black bill with a yellow tip.|$|E
5000|$|The <b>elegant</b> <b>tern</b> feeds by plunge-diving for fish, almost {{invariably}} from the sea, like most Thalasseus terns. It usually dives directly, {{and not from}} the [...] "stepped-hover" [...] favoured by the Arctic tern. The offering of fish by the male to the female {{is part of the}} courtship display.|$|E
50|$|The fauna {{consist of}} the {{following}} list of endangered species: blue whale, humpback whale, killer whale, sperm whale, green turtle, hawksbill turtle, olive ridley turtle, totoaba. The ecosystem of the San Lorenzo Archipelago consists of many varieties of commercially important fish. Swordfish, hake fish, risso dolphin are also common in the waters surrounding the islands. Rasa Island is an important nesting site for Heermann's gull, <b>elegant</b> <b>tern,</b> American oystercatcher, Craveri's murrelet, and brown pelican. Heermann's gull and <b>elegant</b> <b>tern</b> are estimated to reach 260 thousand and 200 thousand respectively which accounts for about 95% of the total world population of that species. Salsipuedes Island, Las Animas Island, and San Lorenzo Island are important reproductive habitat for the brown pelican in the Gulf of California. An average sum of nesting pairs of brown pelicans on the three islands is estimated between 6,000-18,000.|$|E
50|$|This Pacific {{species has}} wandered to western Europe as a rare vagrant {{on a number}} of occasions, and has interbred with the Sandwich tern in France; there is also one record from Cape Town, South Africa in January 2006, the first record for Africa. An <b>Elegant</b> <b>Tern</b> was {{recorded}} in the British Isles, in Pagham, West Sussex, in June 2017.|$|E
50|$|A 1996 report {{identified}} 20 {{special status}} species from various surveys (dates not specified): California brown pelican, southern bald eagle, peregrine falcon, snowy plover, common loon, American white pelican, double-crested cormorant, white-faced ibis, fulvous whistling duck, harlequin duck, northern harrier, golden eagle, osprey, long-billed curlew, California gull, <b>elegant</b> <b>tern,</b> and black skimmer. Those with specified dates included Belding's Savannah sparrow (1994), and California horned lark (1995).|$|E
50|$|The {{lesser crested tern}} and <b>elegant</b> <b>tern</b> {{differ in}} having all-orange bills; lesser crested also differs in having a grey rump and {{marginally}} stouter bill, and elegant in having a slightly longer, slenderer bill. Chinese crested tern is the most similar to Sandwich, but has {{a reversal of the}} bill colour, yellow with a black tip; it does not overlap in range with Sandwich tern so confusion is unlikely.|$|E
5000|$|Cabot's tern (Thalasseus acuflavidus) is a tern in {{the family}} Laridae {{sometimes}} separated from the Sandwich tern (Thalasseus sandvicensis). It has since {{been shown to be}} more closely related to the <b>elegant</b> <b>tern</b> (Thalasseus elegans). The genus name is from Ancient Greek Thalasseus, [...] "fisherman" [...] from thalassa, [...] "sea". The specific acuflavida is Latin from acus, [...] "needle", and flavidus, [...] "yellowish". The IOC recognizes the bird as distinct, but most other taxonomists, including both committees of the AOU, consider it conspecific with the Sandwich tern.|$|E
50|$|At {{least seven}} species of water birds {{are known to}} breed on Montague Island. The island {{is one of two}} known active {{breeding}} colonies of <b>elegant</b> <b>tern</b> in Mexico. During two years, a large number of nests were destroyed by tidal flooding, but there were only low levels of nests lost to predation. The birds nesting on Montague Island have reacted strongly to El Niño, with brown boobies being replaced by blue-footed boobies, and an increase in nesting of least, elegant, and royal terns, as well as black skimmers.|$|E
50|$|The Dawlish Warren {{nature reserve}} {{provides}} a major roosting site for wading birds and migratory waterfowl, {{and serves as}} a habitat for the endangered petalwort plant. It is also one of only two sites in Britain where the sand crocus (Romulea columnae) grows. A large number of rare vagrant birds have been recorded at Dawlish Warren, including <b>elegant</b> <b>tern,</b> lesser crested tern, long-billed murrelet, greater sand plover, semipalmated plover, cream-coloured courser and great spotted cuckoo. Some sand lizards have also been spotted at the reserve, as a result of re-introductions.|$|E
5000|$|Like all Thalasseus terns, {{lesser crested tern}} feeds by plunge-diving for fish, usually from saline environments. It usually dives directly, and {{not from}} the [...] "stepped-hover" [...] favoured by Arctic tern. The {{offering}} of fish by the male to the female {{is part of the}} courtship display.This is a medium-large tern, very similar in size and general appearance to its three very close relatives Sandwich tern, <b>Elegant</b> <b>tern</b> and Chinese crested tern. The summer adult has a black cap, black legs and a long sharp orange bill. The upperwings, rump and central tail feathers are grey and the underparts white. The primary flight feathers darken during the summer. In winter, the forehead becomes white. The call is a loud grating noise like Sandwich tern.|$|E

40|$|In 1989 - 1991, the U. S. Fish and Wildlife Service {{surveyed}} breeding {{populations of}} seabirds {{on the entire}} California coast. This study {{was sponsored by the}} Minerals Management Service in relation to outer continental shelf oil and gas leasing. At 483 nesting sites (excluding terns and skimmers in southern California), we estimated 643, 307 breeding birds of 21 seabird species including: 410 Fork-tailed Storm-petrel (Oceanodroma furcata); 12, 551 Leach's Storm-petrel (O. leucorhoa); 7, 209 Ashy Storm-petrel (O. homochroa); 274 Black Storm-petrel (O. melania); 11, 916 Brown Pelican (Pelecanus occidentalis); 10, 037 Double-crested Cormorant (Phalacrocorax auritus); 83, 394 Brandt's Cormorant (P. penicillatus); 14, 345 Pelagic Cormorant (P. pelagicus); 888 Black Oystercatcher (Haemotopus bachmani); 4, 764 California Gull (Larus californicus); 61, 760 Western Gull (L. occidentalis); 2, 838 Caspian Tern (Sterna caspia) (excluding southern California); 3, 550 Forster's Tern (S. forsteri) (excluding southern California); 272 Least Tern (S. albifrons) (excluding southern California); 351, 336 Common Murre (Uria aalge); 15, 470 Pigeon Guillemot (Cepphus columba); 1, 821 Marbled Murrelet (Brachyramphus marmoratus); 1, 760 Xantus' Murrelet (Endomychura hypoleuca); 56, 562 Cassin's Auklet (Ptychoramphus aleuticus); 1, 769 Rhinoceros Auklet (Cerorhinca monocerata); and 276 Tufted Puffin (Fratercula cirrhata). The inland, historical or hybrid breeding status of American White Pelican (P. erythrorynchus), American Oystercatcher (H. palliatus), Heermann's Gull (L. heermanni), Ring-billed Gull (L. delawarensis), Glaucous-winged Gull (L. glaucescens) and Black Tern (Chlidonias niger) are discussed. Estimates for Gull-billed Tern (S. nilotica), Royal Tern (S. maxima), <b>Elegant</b> <b>Tern</b> (S. elegans) and Black Skimmer (Rhynchops niger) will be included in the final draft of this report. Overall numbers were slightly lower than reported in 1975 - 1980 surveys (summarized in Sowls et al. 1980. Catalog of California seabird colonies. U. S. Dept. Int., Fish Wildl. Serv., Biol. Serv. Prog., FWS/OBS 37 / 80). Recent declines were found or suspected for Fork-tailed Storm-petrel, Leach's Storm-petrel, White Pelican, Black Tern, Caspian Tern, Least Tern, Common Murre and Marbled Murrelet. Recent increases were found or suspected for Brown Pelican, Double-crested cormorant, California Gull, Western Gull, Forster's Tern and Rhinoceros Auklet. Similar numbers were found for other species or trends could not be determined without additional surveys, studies and/or more in-depth comparisons with previous surveys. The status of terns and skimmers in southern California has not yet been finalized...|$|E
