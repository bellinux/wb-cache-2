2500|$|Conner's plane {{arrived at}} LAX at 4:40 pm; he was flown by {{helicopter}} to CBS Studios and landed during a commercial break. After {{appearing on the}} show with Comăneci and Panait, Conner met with [...] Comăneci in the green room, later saying of the meeting:I think I can understand why Nadia said what she did ... She said, 'He (Panit) is my manager. We don't have a relationship, so it doesn't matter if he's married or not.' But it came off really awful. She regrets it, and I don't think she realized how misunderstood she would be. She really got burned. She said the Miami media was really not nice to her. Conner gave Comăneci his telephone number, but at the time, Comăneci, who wasshy and suspicious of him [...] also sensed {{that he was being}} open and honest. <b>For</b> <b>a</b> <b>second,</b> <b>I</b> was tempted to ask for help... I needed to move on and find a better life for myself. Bart told me later that he tried to call me after the show, but Constantin never let me know of his calls.

60|$|MURRAY (waving this aside). I didn't want to forget--not <b>for</b> <b>a</b> <b>second.</b> <b>I</b> wasn't {{drowning}} my sorrow. I was hilariously celebrating.|$|E
5000|$|Could <b>I</b> {{interrupt}} you <b>for</b> <b>a</b> <b>second?</b> If <b>I</b> could just clarify this then.|$|R
6000|$|Thorn {{pulled up}} his {{plunging}} horse {{as the other}} spoke, and <b>for</b> <b>a</b> few <b>seconds</b> <b>I</b> struggled with the limpness of dismay. Then I said hoarsely: [...] "If the flame hasn't lapped the wings yet, we'll try." ...|$|R
60|$|And oh, there was! But {{sometimes}} I wondered uneasily, feeling almost conscience-stricken, {{whether it}} were wholly because Hester had left me--whether it were no partly because, <b>for</b> <b>a</b> <b>second</b> time, <b>I</b> had {{shut the door}} of my heart {{in the face of}} love at her bidding.|$|R
60|$|<b>For</b> <b>a</b> <b>second</b> <b>I</b> was too {{surprised}} {{to move or}} speak. The little girl uttered a piercing scream, and gathering her dolls in her arms huddled into {{a corner of the}} bench.|$|E
60|$|<b>For</b> <b>a</b> <b>second</b> <b>I</b> {{thought he}} was going to run away. Then he jerked up his head, and rushed on towards the house. At the foot of the {{staircase}} he gripped me by the shoulder.|$|E
6000|$|... "I was so knocked silly <b>for</b> <b>a</b> <b>second,</b> <b>I</b> couldn't do anything. The man marched out of {{the place}} and joined his friend just round the corner. Then they went so quick up Bullock Street that I couldn't catch them, though I ran round the bars to do it." ...|$|E
60|$|Thus <b>for</b> <b>a</b> <b>second</b> {{time had}} <b>I</b> heard his {{footsteps}} die away, knowing I should never listen for their drawing near again.|$|R
6000|$|... 'You {{will see}} that those little {{alterations}} are made, Madame Mantalini,' said the lady. 'Nay, you bad man, you positively shall go first; I wouldn't leave you behind with that pretty girl, not <b>for</b> half <b>a</b> <b>second.</b> <b>I</b> know you too well. Jane, my dear, let him go first, and we shall be quite sure of him.' ...|$|R
5000|$|Years later, Bullington {{would say}} of his only major league win: [...] "I {{remember}} {{they told me}} I was done after eight, and just going into the tunnel <b>for</b> <b>a</b> <b>second</b> before <b>I</b> came back out to watch the ninth. It just kind of sits with you, if I never get this opportunity again or this is it, it's certainly worth it." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "A woman lied to {{me about}} it," [...] she said slowly. [...] "I am ashamed of myself that I should have listened to her, even <b>for</b> <b>a</b> <b>second.</b> <b>I</b> chanced {{to look at it}} last night, and it {{suddenly}} occurred to me where I had seen it. It was on a man's watch-chain, but not on yours." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I saw {{a pair of}} hands--just hands--no arms--nothing but hands--come out of the darkness! They gripped me by the throat. I {{suppose it}} was just <b>for</b> <b>a</b> <b>second.</b> <b>I</b> think--I lost {{consciousness}} for a moment, although I was still standing up. The next thing I remember is that I found myself shrieking and running here--and the jewels had gone!" ...|$|E
60|$|And {{without more}} ado I {{shouldered}} him aside, {{and held the}} door that she might enter. She rewarded me with a smile--half vicious, half whimsical, and mounted the step. Saint-Eustache would have interfered. He came {{at me as if}} resenting that shoulder-thrust of mine, and <b>for</b> <b>a</b> <b>second</b> <b>I</b> almost thought he would have committed the madness of striking me.|$|E
5000|$|In December 2010, Smith {{confirmed}} in an interview, {{that she will}} be doing a jazz album. Smith stated, [...] "I'm kind of closing the book on that part of me <b>for</b> <b>a</b> <b>second,</b> so <b>I</b> can embrace other things that I really want to do. I'm working on a jazz record that's more straight-ahead kind of jazz. I'm working to finish this synthy '80s throwback dance record...".|$|R
60|$|In {{correcting}} {{this book}} <b>for</b> <b>a</b> <b>second</b> edition, <b>I</b> {{have sought to}} complete it without altering its original plan: I have given a new chapter sketching the history of Venetian Commerce and noticing the present trade and industry of Venice; I have amplified somewhat the chapter on the national holidays, and have affixed an index to the chief historical persons, incidents, and places mentioned.|$|R
60|$|He puffed away {{in silence}} <b>for</b> <b>a</b> few <b>seconds,</b> while <b>I</b> sat {{watching}} him. I {{had never seen}} a ghost smoking a pipe before, that I could remember, and it interested me.|$|R
60|$|Not that <b>for</b> <b>a</b> <b>second</b> <b>I</b> {{believed}} it true. I could never believe it. Aunt Emma, so gentle, so kindly, so sweet: incapable of hurting any living thing: the tenderest old lady that breathed upon earth: {{and my own}} mother's sister, whom I loved as I never before loved anyone! Aunt Emma the murderess! The bare idea was preposterous! I couldn't entertain it. My whole nature revolted from it.|$|E
60|$|For {{an instant}} I stood there before they fell upon me, {{but the first}} rush of them forced me back a step or two. My foot felt for the floor but found only empty space. I had backed into the pit which had {{received}} Issus. <b>For</b> <b>a</b> <b>second</b> <b>I</b> toppled there upon the brink. Then I too with the boy still tightly clutched in my arms pitched backward into the black abyss.|$|E
60|$|Perhaps I was overwrought. Perhaps my fancy {{ran away}} with me. But I didn't doubt <b>for</b> <b>a</b> <b>second.</b> <b>I</b> rose from my seat, {{and in a}} tremulous voice called Jane into the room. Without one word I laid both {{pictures}} down before her together. Jane glanced first at the one, then turned quickly to the other. A sharp little cry broke from her lips all unbidden. She saw it as fast and as instinctively as I had done.|$|E
60|$|He {{gave his}} men {{the order to}} mount, and bade Monsieur de Lavedan enter the coach, whereupon Gilles shot me a glance of inquiry. <b>For</b> <b>a</b> <b>second,</b> as <b>I</b> stepped slowly after the Chevalier, I was minded to try armed resistance, and to convert that grey {{courtyard}} into a shambles. Then I saw betimes the futility of such a step, and I shrugged my shoulders in answer to my servant's glance.|$|R
6000|$|But {{there was}} no dive, and I {{returned}} to earth (after an hour and twenty minutes) without having felt [...] "bored" [...] <b>for</b> <b>a</b> single <b>second.</b> <b>I</b> descended (by the ladder) thinking that I would never go flying again. No, never any more--lest its mysterious fascination, whose invisible wing had brushed my heart up there, should change to unavailing regret in a man too old for its glory.|$|R
5|$|On September 29, Walter Schirra, Eisele, and Walter Cunningham {{were named}} {{as the prime}} crew <b>for</b> <b>a</b> <b>second</b> Block <b>I</b> CSM flight, AS-205. NASA planned to follow this with an {{unmanned}} test flight of the LM (AS-206), then the third manned mission would be a dual flight designated AS-278 (or AS-207/208), in which AS-207 would launch the first manned Block II CSM, which would then rendezvous and dock with the LM launched unmanned on AS-208.|$|R
60|$|My first {{impression}} {{was that the}} Cantankerous Old Lady would go off {{in a fit of}} apoplexy. She grew purple in the face with indignation and astonishment, that a casual outsider should venture to address her; so much so, indeed, that <b>for</b> <b>a</b> <b>second</b> <b>I</b> almost regretted my well-meant interposition. Then she scanned me up and down, as if I were a girl in a mantle shop, and she contemplated buying either me or the mantle. At last, catching my eye, she thought better of it, and burst out laughing.|$|E
6000|$|... "Ay, priest, I'll away, but by God's blood, I'll {{take that}} Red Eve with me! For {{one thing she}} knows too much to leave her behind. <b>For</b> <b>a</b> <b>second</b> <b>I</b> mean to pay her back, and for a third, {{although}} you may think it strange, I'm mad for her. I tell you she looked wondrous standing with her back against that wall, her marble face never wincing when I told her all the lie about young de Cressi's death--which will be holy truth when I get a chance at him--watching me out of those great, dark eyes of hers." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I {{jumped into}} the field with them, chasing them with my biograph, getting a series of moving {{pictures}} of that bullfight which was sure the real thing. It was a ticklish thing to do, though knowing that neither bull dared {{take his eyes off}} his adversary <b>for</b> <b>a</b> <b>second,</b> <b>I</b> felt reasonably safe. The old Weetah beat the new champion out that night, but the next morning they were at it again, and the new buffalo finally whipped the old one into submission. Since then his spirit has remained broken, and even a child can approach him safely--but the new Weetah is in turn a holy terror.|$|E
6000|$|She punctuated her {{sentence}} with a mischievous {{look at her}} interlocutor. <b>For</b> <b>a</b> <b>second</b> time <b>I</b> regret to say that Mr. Gashwiler succumbed. The Roman constituency at Remus, {{it is to be}} hoped, were happily ignorant of this last defection of their great legislator. Mr. Gashwiler instantly forgot his theme,--began to ply the lady with a certain bovine-like gallantry, which it is to be said to her credit she parried with a playful, terrier-like dexterity, when the servant suddenly announced, [...] "Mr. Wiles." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I dunno. I was poking about {{under them}} lilacs {{in the old}} garden, {{trying to see if}} there was any lilies-of-the-valley out yet. It was dark as a pocket there--and all at once I seen {{something}} stirring and rustling round at the other side of the garden, in those cherry bushes. It was WHITE. I tell you <b>I</b> didn't stop <b>for</b> <b>a</b> <b>second</b> look. <b>I</b> flew over the dyke quicker than quick. I was sure it was Henry Warren's ghost." ...|$|R
5000|$|Shad {{released}} his third album, TSOL, in 2010. TSOL was <b>a</b> short-list nominee <b>for</b> the 2010 Polaris Music Prize, received <b>a</b> nomination <b>for</b> <b>a</b> 2011 MuchMusic Video Award, {{and won the}} Juno Award for Rap Recording of the Year at the 2011 Juno Awards. On beating out Canadian compatriot Drake for the Juno, Shad said in an interview: [...] "I did not think <b>for</b> <b>a</b> <b>second</b> that <b>I</b> would win. Not for one second. He's massive. He's massive in the States, he's massive in Canada.".|$|R
60|$|The old man lingered {{a moment}} after the servant had withdrawn, and his hollow eyes rested on me <b>for</b> <b>a</b> <b>second.</b> <b>I</b> {{thought that he}} was on the point of saying something, and I waited {{returning}} his glance with one that quailed before the anguish of his own. I feared to speak, to offer an expression of the sympathy that filled my heart; for in that strange place I could not tell how far a man was to be trusted--even a man so wronged as this one. On his own part it may be that a like doubt beset him concerning me, for in the end he departed as he had come, no word having passed his ashen lips.|$|E
60|$|By {{the time}} I had {{got to the}} corner of the Lothian Road there was a {{distinct}} improvement. For one thing, I had now my shoulder to the wind; <b>for</b> <b>a</b> <b>second,</b> <b>I</b> came in the lee of my old prison-house, the Castle; and, at any rate, the excessive fury of the blast was itself moderating. The thought of what errand I was on re-awoke within me, and I seemed to breast the rough weather with increasing ease. With such a destination, what mattered a little buffeting of wind or a sprinkle of cold water? I recalled Flora's image, I took her in fancy to my arms, and my heart throbbed. And the next moment I had recognised the inanity of that fool's paradise. If I could spy her taper as she went to bed, I might count myself lucky.|$|E
60|$|I {{never saw}} his charge. I never {{knew he had}} leapt upon me. I only felt my {{elephant}} rock {{from side to side}} like a ship in a storm. He was trumpeting, shaking, roaring with rage and pain, for the tiger was on his flanks, its claws buried deep in the skin of his forehead. I could not keep my seat; I felt myself tossed about in the frail howdah like a pill in a pill-box. The elephant, in a death grapple, was trying to shake off his ghastly enemy. For a minute or two, I was conscious of nothing save this swinging movement. Then, opening my eyes <b>for</b> <b>a</b> <b>second,</b> <b>I</b> saw the tiger, in all his terrible beauty, clinging to the elephant's head by the claws of his fore paws, and struggling for a foothold on its trunk with his mighty hind legs, in a wounded agony of despair and vengeance. He would sell his life dear; he would have one or other of us.|$|E
60|$|<b>For</b> <b>a</b> few <b>seconds</b> <b>I</b> swung to and fro, {{while he}} {{gathered}} {{himself for the}} effort, and then I heard his sinews cracking above me, and felt myself lifted up as though I were a little child, till I got my left arm round the rock, and my chest was resting on it. The rest was easy; {{in two or three}} more <b>seconds</b> <b>I</b> was up, and we were lying panting side by side, trembling like leaves, and with the cold perspiration of terror pouring from our skins.|$|R
40|$|You {{might be}} {{surprised}} when I tell you the two best decisions made on our ranch, are much easier {{to come up with}} than the two worst decisions. Now, not even <b>for</b> <b>a</b> <b>second,</b> do <b>I</b> believe that I haven’t made some big mistakes. A matter of fact some of them have been real dousies. And {{there have been so many}} big mistakes somehow prioritizing them in order to come up with two of the worst is not only difficult but they are painful to recollect! So lets start with the best decisions...|$|R
5000|$|Liédson {{expressed}} interest in playing for the Portuguese national team despite being Brazilian-born. He stated: [...] "If one day I was called up to play, <b>I</b> wouldn’t hesitate <b>for</b> <b>a</b> <b>second,</b> as <b>I</b> {{feel right at home}} in Portugal." [...] After the retirement of striker Pauleta, Liédson {{was one of the main}} candidates in line for succession, especially after countrymen Deco and Pepe's previous switches. Liédson's naturalization process created some controversy, as the Portuguese Football Players' Union in August 2009 publicly objected Portuguese Football Federation's (FPF) plans of expediting his citizenship.|$|R
