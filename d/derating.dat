25|$|The {{breakdown}} voltage of film capacitors decreases with increasing temperature. When using film capacitors at temperatures between the upper rated temperature {{and the upper}} category temperature, only a temperature-derated category voltage VC is allowed. The <b>derating</b> factors apply to both DC and AC voltages. Some manufacturers may have quite different <b>derating</b> curves for their capacitors compared with the generic curves given in the picture at the right.|$|E

40|$|Minimising {{the overall}} {{operating}} cost {{with regard to}} engine deterioration during takeoff by using <b>derated</b> takeoff thrust is well understood by aircraft and engine manufacturers. Some aircraft have the possibility to use <b>derated</b> climb thrust as well, which is not always fully understood by the operators. The possibility of using <b>derated</b> climb thrust for reducing maintenance costs is discussed. It is shown that by using <b>derated</b> climb thrust D 2, the HPT blade life can be increased by 7 % {{at the expense of}} a 0. 7 % increase in fuel consumption during the climb phase, affecting the overall flight mission fuel consumption by approximately 0. 1 %...|$|R
40|$|This paper {{discusses}} the characteristics {{and implications of}} use of a <b>derated</b> ion thruster for north-south-stationkeeping (NSSK) propulsion. A <b>derated</b> thruster is a 30 -cm diameter primary propulsion ion thruster operated at highly throttled conditions appropriate to NSSK functions. The performance characteristics of a 30 -cm ion thruster are presented, emphasizing throttled operation at low specific impulse and high thrust-to-power ratio. Performance data and component erosion are compared to other NSSK ion thrusters. Operations benefits derived from the performance advantages of the <b>derated</b> approach are examined assuming an Intelsat VII-type spacecraft. Minimum ground test facility pumping capabilities required to maintain facility enhanced accelerator grid erosion at acceptable levels in a lifetest are quantified {{as a function of}} thruster operating condition. Novel approaches to reducing the <b>derated</b> thruster mass and volume are also discussed...|$|R

25|$|The rated AC voltage is {{generally}} calculated so that an internal temperature rise of 8 to 10nbsp&°K sets the allowed limit for film capacitors.

25|$|The rated AC voltage {{for film}} {{capacitors}} is generally calculated so that an internal temperature rise of 8 to 10nbsp&°K is the allowed limit for safe operation. Because dielectric losses increase with increasing frequency, the specified AC voltage {{has to be}} derated at higher frequencies. Datasheets for film capacitors specify special curves for <b>derating</b> AC voltages at higher frequencies.|$|E
25|$|Solid {{tantalum}} {{electrolytic capacitors}} can be damaged by surge, peak or pulse currents. Tantalum capacitors, which {{are exposed to}} surge, peak or pulse currents should be used with a voltage <b>derating</b> up to 70% in highly inductive circuits. If possible, the voltage profile should be a ramp turn-on, as this reduces the peak current seen by the capacitor.|$|E

25|$|The 206L LongRanger is a {{stretched}} variant with {{seating for}} seven. The fuselage, stretched {{a total of}} , adds two rear-facing seats between {{the front and rear}} seats. Since 1975, Bell has produced more than 1,700 LongRangers across all variant types. In 1981, a military version was released, the 206L TexasRanger. The original 206L used an Allison 250-C20B engine, and a series of model upgrades replaced this engine with more powerful versions; the 206L-1 used a 250-C28, and the 206L-3 and 206L-4 used the 250-C30P. In both applications, the 250-C30P is derated from 650hp for takeoff and 501hp continuous. The 206L-3 is transmission–limited to 435hp for take-off, and the 206L-4 is transmission-limited to 495hp. The <b>derating</b> of the C30P produces an advantage in hot-day and high-altitude operations as it can produce the rated horsepower at higher altitudes and temperatures where applications that use the maximum rating of the engine at sea level suffer accelerated performance deterioration with increases in temperature and altitude. The 206L-3 and L-4 have not been offered in a twin configuration under those model designations.|$|E
25|$|Long {{aluminium}} beadings on {{the sides}} were painted cream, a visual device to make the locomotive's high sides appear more slender {{and add to the}} impression of speed. Three curved chevrons on each nose, in the same cream, added to that effect. To British eyes, the locomotive's styling was reminiscent of American locomotives, such as the EMD E-unit or ALCO PA designs (partly because English Electric initially planned to offer the type for export), with high noses and small, somewhat swept-back cab windows set behind them. To add to the American look of the locomotive, a large headlight was to have been fitted to each nose (the lights were never installed but would have been of the rotating 'Mars Light' type as fitted to North American locomotives of the era). Two 18-cylinder Deltic engines were fitted, derated from the 1,750 horsepower (1.3 MW) of the marine engines in minesweepers to 1,650 horsepower (1.2 MW) each, generating 3,300 horsepower (2.5 MW) total. This <b>derating</b> reduced the stress on the engines, thereby increasing the service life and length of time between overhauls.|$|E

2500|$|Polytetrafluoroethylene film {{capacitors}} {{feature a}} very high temperature resistance up to 200nbsp&°C, and even further up to 260nbsp&°C, with a voltage <b>derating.</b> The dissipation factor 2 • 10 −4 [...] is quite small. The change in capacitance over the entire temperature range of +1% to -3% {{is a little bit}} higher than for polypropylene film capacitors. However, since the smallest available film thickness for PTFE films is 5.5nbsp&µm, approximately twice of the thickness of polypropylene films, the PTFE film capacitors are physically bulkier than PP film capacitors. It added that the film thickness on the surface is not constant, so that Teflon films are difficult to produce.|$|E
2500|$|The DH.9's {{performance}} in action over the Western Front was typically deemed {{to have been}} a disaster; heavy losses of the type were quickly incurred, attributed to both its poor performance and to engine failures, despite the prior <b>derating</b> of its engine to reduce the failure rate. Between May and November 1918, a pair of squadrons stationed at the Western Front (Nos. 99 and 104) had 54 of its DH.9s shot down and another 94 aircraft written off due to accidents. On multiple occasions, less than half of a flight of bombers would reach their intended targets; according to Bruce, the successful missions performed by the DH.9 were frequently a product of [...] "the courage and determination of the pilots and observers that flew them". Squadrons would often implement their own home-built enhancements to their aircraft, such as enlarged carburetor air intakes and modified fuel mixture controls.|$|E

50|$|In {{practice}} {{it is not}} possible to obtain the quoted theoretical maximum throughput rate for machines in a placement system. It is necessary to derate the theoretical numbers to obtain realistic values, due to unexpected downtime, board load and unload time and machine configuration. Other factors include PWB size, component mix, and the requirement for more complex vision recognition for fine-pitch components. There are many techniques of <b>derating.</b> Global <b>derating</b> considers system-wide stops, slow-downs and set ups as well as machine factors. To calculate the amount of global or system <b>derating,</b> one should take the average of the number of total components placed per hour in a long period (i.e. an entire product shift). Regularly scheduled stops should be included when determining the level of global <b>derating</b> the system requires.Rigorous <b>derating,</b> which considers each piece of equipment in service for a particular product individually, must be conducted by specific machine model for the line balancing.
