Using the Dutch synthetic market as a case study, Vijlbrief (2012) assessed the role of displacement in organized crime. With the increase of barriers by government officials to obtaining precursor and <b>essential</b> <b>chemicals,</b> {{the question is how}} criminal organizations respond to a shortage of chemicals. Illegal organizations began by substituting other chemicals for specific precursors, making the drugs more dangerous to those using them. Criminals were initially not displaced, instead adapting to the new regulations. The study of potential adverse effects is a valuable tool in creating situational crime-prevention policies. By evaluating potential effects, a policy can be predicted to have a positive or negative result. Vijlbrief (2012) states in his research that [...] "Some measures can be said to have a waterbed effect: repression of criminal activities in one location may cause an increase in the same criminal activities somewhere else. Displacement is not limited to geographical effects. Perpetrators may also shift their activities to completely different types of crime, or even continue to commit the same crime using different methods or means"( [...] p. 199). Studying the relationship between interventions by law-enforcement bodies and displacement effects proved complex. One conclusion in the study by Vijlbrief (2012) is that [...] "there is limited attention for displacement effects or the diffusion of benefits" [...] (ibid; Kim et al. 2007); [...] "It is difficult to isolate the effect of a given measure because neighboring factors always have an influence" [...] (Shukla and Bartgis 2009, p. 354). Measuring displacement effects for an illegal organization in the synthetic drug market is complex, since the market is multifaceted and extensive. Organized criminals are likely to adapt their methods to changing circumstances, leading to displacement; this assumes that crime organizations have the resources to adapt to policy change.|$|E

40|$|Abstract: Life {{is fueled}} by {{available}} energy. In fact, life is organized around the utilization of available energy, either from photons or from chemicals. The basic architecture of life can be understood from the following propositions: cata-lysts are {{able to control the}} path of chemical reactions and influence their rate by transient and reversible exchange of high-grade energy between themselves and reactants, while conserving the total energy. That, in turn, enables the synthe-sis of <b>essential</b> <b>chemicals</b> as well as the duplication of templates. We argue in this paper that energy utilization and evolu-tion are emergent properties in life that are based on a small number of well-established laws of physics and chemistry governing catalysis. We propose that the relevant laws constitute a framework for biology on a level intermediate between quantum chemistry and cell biology...|$|E

40|$|The trophic {{transfer}} across phytoplankton-zooplankton interface is crucially {{important in}} aquatic food webs. The factors regulating the trophic transfer efficiency {{have been widely}} studied. There is an increasing awareness of food quality in terms of chemical composition of phytoplankton as the major control of the phytoplankton-zooplankton interaction via bottom-up processes. Nutrient availability has broad effects on chemical composition of phytoplankton. Other factors, e. g., dilution rate in continuous and semicontinuous cultures, can interact with nutrient supply and affect phytoplankton food quality, hence affecting the performance of zooplankton. This study aimed to investigate the effects of nitrogen (N) :phosphorus (P) supply ratios and growth rates (dilution rates) on elemental and biochemical composition of marine phytoplankton, {{as well as the}} effects of food quantity and quality on the trophic transfer of <b>essential</b> <b>chemicals</b> and the performance of copepods. For this purpose, laboratory experiments were firstly conducted with three species of marine phytoplankton in semicontinuous cultures to test the interactive effect of five N:P supply ratios and four growth rates. Subsequent copepod experiments were performed with one species of marine copepods (Acartia tonsa) feeding on one phytoplankton species (Rhodomonas sp.), where the factors of food quantity and quality were crossed. The results in this thesis highlight the importance of simultaneous consideration of elemental and biochemical food quality for understanding the trophic transfer of energy and matter in food webs. Evaluating responses of this mutual regulation to multiple ambient factors is a necessary step towards the phytoplankton-zooplankton relationship in more realistic scenarios that will allow in the future the prediction of zooplankton’s performances in changing aquatic environments...|$|E
40|$|ABSTRACT Ethylene Oxide (EO) {{is one of}} the <b>essential</b> <b>chemicals</b> in {{industrial}} processes. At ambient temperature, EO is an uncoloured gas with a somewhat sweet odour. The market value of EO is very high since its field of application is large. Above all, EO is used as input component in the production of many different chemical products, i. e. bromide fluid, cosmetic and anti-freezing medium in engines. Handling EO is very complicated because of its flammability. It is very dangerous in many ways. If released uncontrollably it is very likely that a powerful explosion will take place. Exposure to EO may also result in health problems. EO is toxic, carcinogenic, caustic and allergenic. The first stage of EO production is direct oxidation of ethylene, which takes place in a reactor under high pressure and temperature. The reaction is exothermic and has a high potential of runaway followed by an explosion. Therefore, the design, operation and maintenance procedures require proper safety concern. The objective of this project is to identify all possible hazards in the process of EO reactor and to introduce some safety actions in order to minimize the risk of potential accidents. Thus, guideline to improve the safety of EO reactor can be proposed. In this study, some risk assessment tools such as HAZOP and FMEA are used to identify the most hazardous scenarios concerning the reaction phase of the process. Operating condition hazards is evaluated using HAZOP, while equipment hazards and failures are analyzed using FMEA. The results of the study in terms of safeguards and suggestions can be used to improve the EO reactor safety...|$|E
40|$|It is the {{inherent}} nature of humans to depend upon {{flora and fauna}} to find cures against various ailments. This dependence {{has given rise to}} different traditional medicinal practices throughout the world. Although plants were the prime targets for explorations for curatives, however animals were not far behind. Various body parts of the animals were used in the preparations of natural medicines. This practice has given rise to a distinct branch of medicine called zootherapy. In ancient times, zootherapists mainly depended on whole body preparations of animals, metabolic products (corporal secretions and excreta) or non-animal materials (nests and cocoons). Out of these resources, seven major materials gained prominence for drug preparations. These are honey, wax, adder, beaver testicles, musk oil, coral, and ambergris (Lev, 2003). A more detailed insight would reveal a diverse world of zootherapy. Alexiades (unpublished data) recorded the use of 50 local animals for traditional drug preparations by the Ese Eja people of Peru. Smashed ants (Pseudomyrmex sp.) are used by locals of Latin America to cure toothache. Blood obtained from black caiman (Melanosuchus niger) were used to treat epilepsy and stroke. In Sudan, honey is used in curing hepatic and gastrointestinal disorders, gastric ulcers and wound healing. Over 500 species of insects, mites and spiders are used in to treat complicated diseases in Chattisgarh (Oudhia, 1995). Recent scientific advances have enlightened the modern world about the medicinal power of zootherapy and provided a sound scientific basis of these ancient therapeutic practices that was erstwhile shrouded in an aura of mystery and superstition.

40|$|Fish is {{considered}} one of the healthiest foods due to the high levels of several important cardioprotective compounds such as long chain omega- 3 polyunsaturated fatty acids and vitamin E. However, due to widespread environmental pollution, high levels of contaminants may also be present in fish and seafood samples, which may counteract the beneficial effects of consumption of this food. With this in mind, the aims of this study were: 1) to examine both toxic and <b>essential</b> <b>chemical</b> elements in seafood and river and sea fish samples sold in different Brazilian regions by inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometer (ICP-MS); 2) to estimate the daily intake of these chemical elements by Brazilians. The toxic elements Ba, Cd, Pb, Sr, V and Sb were found in higher concentrations in seafood than in either sea or river fish, while As concentrations were higher in both seafood and sea fish than in river fish. On the other hand, Hg levels were higher in river and sea fish. Concentrations of the <b>essential</b> <b>chemical</b> elements Co, Mn, Cu, Fe, Mg, Zn and Mo were significantly higher in seafood compared with both sorts of fish except for Se, whose levels were similar in seafood and sea fish. Daily intake of all chemical elements was estimated on the basis of a calculation of the amount of fish consumed by Brazilian households (mean fish and seafood consumption of 11. 0 g/person/day). The amount of toxic element in fish and seafood did not represent a risk for the Brazilian people. Moreover, fish and seafood seem to be a good source of selenium...|$|R
