5000|$|Nightcrawler was {{formerly}} known as Dr. Herman Manglar, a geneticist sentenced to imprisonment in the Glades Penitentiary for engineering monstrous creatures in his laboratory. Sharing a cell with Blackthorne Shore, Manglar was able to escape when the sentient computer, Cypheroid, engineered Blackthorne's liberation. Unfortunately, while fleeing through the swamp waters, Manglar took a misstep and met his horrific demise {{in a pool of}} illegally dumped toxic sludge. Later, Blackthorne recovers his decayed remains and enlists the morbid touch of D'Compose to reanimate Manglar in the twisted, monstrous body of Nightcrawler [...] Toxoid. Working from chemicals purloined by the mutated minions of Blackthorne's phony [...] "Brother Druid" [...] cult, Nightcrawler's first assignment is to apply his scientific skills toward creating a formula to protect D'Compose against the sun's burning rays. Although Nightcrawler claimed to have succeeded in his task, and indeed was unaffected by sunlight on later occasions, he and Blackthorne are arrested by Earth Corps before D'Compose tests the formula to painfully discover that it is ineffective. Blackthorne manages to buy a pardon for himself and Nightcrawler, but when D'Compose attacks their court hearing seeking retribution for the formula's failure, they realize that they will need a new Inhumanoid ally for their own protection. Once the two villains secure the beastly Gagoyle from its nesting grounds and have tamed it to some degree, Nightcrawler turns on Blackthorne, hurling him into Gagoyle's <b>feeding</b> <b>pit</b> to coerce a promise of subservience from him. Blackthorne flees during a clash with the Redwoods. Nightcrawler subsequently takes Gagoyle to strong-arm a surrender from D'Compose, but Metlar refuses to comply and Gagoyle is destroyed in their fight. Blackthorne soon makes his return with the powerful Inhumanoid, Sslither, under his control, whose threat presses Nightcrawler into forging an alliance with Earth Corps. Thereafter struck by an electrical bolt from Sslither, Nightcrawler flees the battle. Three months later, Nightcrawler teams with Blackthorne and the Inhumanoids as they set aside their differences in order to sabotage the presidential election: Nightcrawler is seen tainting a lake with hazardous waste that consumes the boat, and nearly the life, of one of the opposing candidates.|$|E

40|$|<b>Feeding</b> <b>pits</b> dug by {{waterfowl}} in Zostera noltii meadows {{are thought}} to promote seedling recruitment by accumulating seeds and enhancing germination. We tested the latter hypothesis by creating a series of "treatment pits" (resembling natural <b>feeding</b> <b>pits)</b> {{in the center and}} at the edge of two meadows near the Island of Sylt (Germany). Seedling density was monitored from the autumn seed set until the following spring.

40|$|Although {{concerns}} about harvesting {{levels of the}} American Horseshoe Crab, Limulus polyphemus have prompted increased research into its ecology, current understanding of the species’ foraging ecology is mostly limited to mid-Atlantic populations. This study elucidates the spatial and temporal pattern of Limulus foraging on an intertidal mudflat of a northern New England estuary. A novel survey method was used to monitor Limulus foraging activity without disturbing the sediment. A fixed 50 m´ 2 m transect was monitored with monthly surveys {{of the number of}} Limulus <b>feeding</b> <b>pits</b> from June to October 2009, May and June 2010. Snorkelling surveys were also carried out to observe individual behavior and examine the spatial scale of activity of individual animals.

Foraging patterns exhibited a seasonal pattern with activity levels peaking in August 2009 and increased significantly {{towards the end of the}} study in June 2010. It was also shown that Limulus intertidal foraging persisted and peaked after the spring breeding season. Observations of foraging Limulus revealed that individual predators dig multiple pits within a single high tide, with little disturbance to the sediment in between. In addition to altering the perception of Limulus as a subtidal predator outside of the breeding season, findings from this study suggests a segregation of spawning and feeding habitats, thus underscoring the need to consider a wider range of critical habitats in the management of Limulus populations [Current Zoology 56 (5) : 611 – 617, 2010]...|$|R
40|$|Abstract. Stingrays are an {{important}} part of the biomass of the fishes in shallow coastal ecosystems, particularly in inter-reefal areas. In these habitats, they are considered keystone species – modifying physical and biological habitats through their foraging and predation. Here, we quantify the effects of bioturbation by rays on sand flats of Ningaloo Reef lagoon in Western Australia. We measured the daily length, breadth and depth of 108 <b>feeding</b> <b>pits</b> over three 7 -day periods, created by stingrays (Pastinachus atrus, Himantura spp. Taeniura lymma and Urogymnus asperrimus) in Mangrove Bay. Additionally, an area of, 1 km 2 of the lagoon at Coral Bay was mapped three times over 18 months, to record patterns of ray and pit presence. Over 21 days at Mangrove Bay, a total of 1. 08 m 3 of sediment was excavated by rays, equating to a sediment wet weight of 760. 8 kg, and 2. 42 % of the total area sampled, or 0. 03 % of the whole intertidal zone. We estimate that up to 42 % of the soft sediments in our study area would be reworked by stingrays each year. Based on a model predicting the probability of pit presence over time, there was a 40 % probability of ray pits persisting for 4 days before being filled in but only a 15 % probability of a pit being present after 7 days. Changes in pit volume over time were static, providing evidence for secondary use. Our results imply that rays play {{an important}} ecological role creating sheltered habitats for other taxa in addition to the turnover of sediments...|$|R

5000|$|Although the Sacramento River {{nominally}} begins near Mount Shasta, {{the true}} hydrological {{source of the}} Sacramento River system is the Pit River, which {{is by far the}} largest of the three rivers flowing into Shasta Lake.

40|$|Numerous {{studies have}} {{attempted}} to quantify the effect of epifaunal predation and its co-occurring disturbance on macrofaunal communities {{with the aid of}} exclosure experiments. However, no {{attention has been paid to}} the possible impacts of different foraging methods used by flamingos on benthic communities. Multivariate and univariate analyses were carried out in order to determine the effects of two different flamingo <b>feeding</b> strategies (<b>pit</b> and channel foraging) on sediment penetrability and macrofaunal community structure in Langebaan Lagoon. The two foraging strategies appear only to differ with regards to prey removal and recolonisation. The more energy intensive, pitforming foraging enables the flamingo to obtain higher quantities of Urothoe grimaldii in addition to bivalves, while promoting recolonisation by opportunists. On the other hand, channel-foraging enables the attainment of various polychaete and nematode species. These small-scale differences, as well as the spatial (and possibly temporal) variation in structures generate habitat complexity. Thus, this preliminary study supports the notion that flamingo foraging activity is a key driver of spatial heterogeneity in Langebaan Lagoon and highlights the need for further research...|$|R
40|$|One notable type of bioturbation {{in marine}} soft sediments {{involves}} the excavation of large pits and displacement of sediment associated with predator foraging for infaunal benthos. Batoids {{are among the}} most powerful excavators, yet their impact on sediment has been poorly studied. For expansive tidal flats, only relatively small proportions of the habitat can be sampled due to physical and logistical constraints. The knowledge of the dynamics of these habitats, including the spatial and temporal distribution of ray bioturbation, thus remains limited. We combined the use of aerial photogrammetry and in situ benthic sampling to quantify stingray <b>feeding</b> <b>pits</b> in Tomioka Bay, Amakusa, Japan. Specifically, we mapped newly-formed pits over an 11 -ha section of an intertidal sandflat over two consecutive daytime low tides. Pit size and distribution patterns were assumed to scale with fish size and reflect size-specific feeding behaviors, respectively. In situ benthic surveys were conducted for sandflat-surface elevation and prey density (callianassid shrimp). The volume versus area relationship was established as a logistic function for pits of varying sizes by photographing and refilling them with sediment. This relationship was applied to the area of every pit detected by air to estimate volume, in which special attention was paid to ray ontogenetic change in space utilization patterns. In total, 18, 103 new pits were formed per day, with a mean individual area of 1060 cm 2. The pits were divided into six groups (G 1 to G 6 in increasing areas), with abundances of G 1, G 2 +G 3, and G 4 -G 6 being medium, high, and low, respectively. Statistical analyses using generalized linear models revealed a marked preference for the higher prey-density areas in G 1 and the restriction of feeding grounds of G 4 -G 6 to the lower shore, with G 2 +G 3 being generalists for prey density and sandflat elevation. The lower degrees of overall bioturbation by G 1 and G 4 -G 6 were spatially structured for the eight sub-areas demarcated by prey density and sandflat elevation, while G 2 +G 3 homogenized the state over the sandflat. The newly-formed pits[U+ 05 F 3] sub-areal mean numerical, excavated-areal, and displaced-sediment-volume densities per day were confined to small ranges: 0. 14 - 0. 17 m- 2, 132 - 223 cm 2 m- 2, and 551 - 879 cm 3 m- 2 (latter two including 119 shallow non-pit excavations). These bioturbation rates are positioned at relatively high levels compared with those by rays from other geographic regions. The present procedure is applicable to the assessment of disturbance by any surface-sediment excavators on tidal flats if their pit dimensions are discernible from the air...|$|R

40|$|Includes bibliographical references. Biological {{disturbances}} on marine {{soft sediment}} ecosystems {{have been well}} researched. However, {{little attention has been}} paid to the potential ecological role that iconic shore bird predators may have on marine ecosystems. This paper tests the effects of spatial gradients on Greater Flamingo (Phoenicopterus ruber) predation impacts on the benthic macrofaunal community structure in an intertidal sandflat ecosystem in South Africa. P. ruber is a benthic filter-feeder known to feed on benthic dwelling invertebrates through pit formation, where deep sediments are stirred up by trampling their feet. Macrofaunal community structure between flamingo pit foraging structures and adjacent non-foraged sediments (controls) yielded insignificant spatial differences. However, subtle positive and negative effects of flamingo predation on macrofaunal abundance were noted at specific sites. Flamingos in this study were not targeting a specific prey group. Thus of the 19 macrofaunal prey items identified, none were significantly impacted across treatments, except for an unidentified polychaete. However, this was once again site specific. The results suggested this polychaete is generally abundant within the area sampled. Furthermore, its distribution is perhaps affected by the level of intensity employed in pit-foraging, rather than being preyed upon. Greater polychaete abundance in pits relative to controls may be attributed to vigorous flamingo <b>feeding</b> efforts. <b>Pit</b> foraging appears to be an expensive strategy to employ, but the energy investment may be reduced through the use of sophisticated sensory organs to detect accessible prey deep within the sediment. Overall, the study has shown that the impact of flamingo predation on a spatial gradient is small and site specific. However, the study highlights the need for further research on quantifying the ecological role flamingos play as predators on marine ecosystems...|$|R

40|$|The {{pine weevil}} Hylobius abietis (L.) (Coleoptera, Curculionidae) is, economically, the most {{important}} forest pest over large areas of Europe. The adults feed on the stem bark of newly planted conifer seedlings, causing severe damage and mortality. The aim of this thesis was to obtain knowledge about behaviours of the pine weevil associated with its feeding, which may be of use in designing measures to protect seedlings. A field experiment showed that the pine weevils use both olfaction and vision to find conifer seedlings. Their response to the combination of odour and visual stimuli were additive. Visual stimuli were {{at least as important}} as odour in finding an undamaged conifer seedling. Soil scarification, which usually exposes mineral soil, is widely used in Scandinavian forest regeneration. In a field experiment, half as many seedlings on mineral soil were attacked by weevils as on undisturbed humus. However, somewhat more weevils approached seedlings surrounded by mineral soil than by humus. It is concluded that the surrounding soil type strongly influences whether a pine weevil decides to feed on a seedling, and that this decision is taken in close proximity to the seedling. Another field experiment showed that feeding was less common on mounds of sand than on flat sand surfaces, but that there was more <b>feeding</b> in sandy <b>pits.</b> This effect of sandy slopes is attributed to the observed difficulty for the weevils to climb these slopes. Many insects spend a large proportion of their life inactive, hiding in shelters. The presence of shelters may, therefore, influence where insects feed. Laboratory experiments demonstrated that the pine weevils were highly attracted to shelters both above and below ground. Visual stimuli were used for orientation towards shelters. Visual stimuli also increased the probability of an individual remaining for a long period in a shelter. The presence of wind increased the weevils’ propensity to use shelters both above and below ground. The results of this thesis highlight the importance of planting seedlings in mineral soil, preferably on mounds, and of avoiding planting locations where the weevils can use above or below ground shelters in the vicinity of seedlings...|$|R
