50|$|Auto rickshaws play an {{important}} role of public transport in Mumbai. There are 246,458 black and yellow metered auto rickshaws, often simply called autos, in the Mumbai MMR as of 2008. Since 2002, all auto rickshaws have been required to use CNG as fuel. However, not all rickshaws comply. Mumbai MMRDA extends up to Alibag, Badlapur, Kaylan M.C. and Ulhasnagar M.C., and in these areas a CNG filling facility is not available, hence the fuel is <b>either</b> <b>petrol</b> <b>or</b> <b>LPG.</b>|$|E
5000|$|Originally all Indian Wagon Rs {{received}} Suzuki's 1.1 L F10D {{petrol engine}} producing [...] at 6,200 rpm and 84 Nm (62 lb·ft) of torque at 3,500 rpm. The newly launched Wagon Rs are {{powered by the}} company's well known K series engine. The aluminum K10B engine produces [...] at 6,200 rpm and 90 Nm at 3,200 rpm. Also, an LPG version is available F10D engined variants, which runs <b>either</b> on <b>petrol</b> <b>or</b> <b>LPG.</b> An automatic version of the Wagon R was released in late 2015.|$|R
25|$|It is also {{easier to}} store ammonia on board {{vehicles}} than to store hydrogen, as ammonia is less flammable than <b>petrol</b> <b>or</b> <b>LPG.</b>|$|R
5000|$|Atco in {{more recent}} years have been {{producing}} rotary mowers powered by <b>either</b> <b>petrol</b> <b>or</b> electricity. Production of petrol-engined cylinder mowers continues with the [...] "Clipper" [...] range, in three sizes.|$|R
25|$|Spark-ignition {{internal}} combustion engines operating on gasoline (<b>petrol),</b> propane, <b>or</b> <b>LPG</b> {{are commonly used}} as portable temporary power sources for construction work, emergency power, or recreational uses.|$|R
50|$|These {{vehicles}} {{were available in}} rigid and tractor units, with <b>either</b> <b>petrol</b> <b>or</b> diesel engines. The UK military were a huge customer for Bedford RLs using a 4.9-litre straight six petrol engine. Many RLs {{found their way into}} the armed forces of Commonwealth countries and later into civilian use.|$|R
50|$|Ammonia and GreenNH3 {{is being}} used with success by {{developers}} in Canada, since it can run in spark ignited or diesel engines with minor modifications, also the only green fuel to power jet engines, and despite its toxicity is reckoned {{to be no more}} dangerous than <b>petrol</b> <b>or</b> <b>LPG.</b> It can be made from renewable electricity, and having half the density of <b>petrol</b> <b>or</b> diesel can be readily carried in sufficient quantities in vehicles. On complete combustion it has no emissions other than nitrogen and water vapour. The combustion chemical formula is 4 NH3 + 3 O2 → 2 N2 + 6 H2O, 75% water is the result.|$|R
50|$|The Milnes-Daimler {{motor bus}} of 1904 (based on the Cannstatt Daimler lorry), {{operated}} in London by Thomas Tilling, ran on <b>either</b> <b>petrol</b> <b>or</b> paraffin, but for starting the engine, or frequent stop-start work, petrol continuously was the preferable option. The airflow from the carburetter was heated by diverted exhaust gas.|$|R
5000|$|The PSA TU {{engine is}} a family of small four-cylinder engines used in the Peugeot and Citroën range of cars. It was {{introduced}} in 1986 with the Citroën AX, replacing the X family, although it shared many components with its predecessor. The TU is available in <b>either</b> <b>petrol</b> <b>or</b> a non-turbo Diesel variants, the latter called TUD.|$|R
50|$|With {{the arrival}} of petrol engines during the 1950-1960s, the same model became {{available}} with <b>either</b> a <b>petrol</b> <b>or</b> diesel engine.|$|R
50|$|The Bedford TJ normal {{control light}} truck was {{introduced}} in 1958, available with <b>either</b> <b>petrol</b> <b>or</b> diesel engines. Although never a big seller in the home market (with the exception of Post Office Telephones), {{it was a big}} export earner in developing countries, due to its basic layout and specification, and remained in production (for export markets only) until production of Bedford vehicles ceased.|$|R
50|$|The Thames Trader model range covered weights from 2 to 7 tons, {{powered by}} <b>either</b> <b>petrol</b> <b>or</b> diesel engines in four- or six-cylinder guises. The lower-weight {{vehicles}} were available with 118- and 138-inch wheelbases, the heavy weight vehicle with 138-, 152- and 160-inch wheelbases; {{there was also}} a 108-inch tipper wheelbase. In addition there was a low-frame chassis model - typically used for furniture van bodywork.|$|R
50|$|Tara {{will remove}} the {{existing}} <b>petrol,</b> diesel, CNG, <b>or</b> <b>LPG</b> engine {{and put the}} EV motor and batteries in most vehicles, Depends on the vehicle’s condition.|$|R
50|$|In 1998, Holden {{introduced}} a right-hand-drive version of Suburban for the Australian and New Zealand markets with <b>either</b> <b>petrol</b> <b>or</b> diesel motors. A modified dashboard from 1995 to 2005 RHD Chevrolet Blazer was used. Sealed beam headlights (from the 1988-93 C/K series) {{were used in}} place of the one-piece composite headlights sold in the USA and Canada. The models were withdrawn as a Holden brand because of low quality and sales.|$|R
5000|$|The engines, {{which may}} be of two or {{four-stroke}} design, are small in both physical dimensions and power output, relative to larger automobile engines. Power output ranges from less than 1 to about 15 horsepower. The smallest of all are used in handheld garden machinery, such as string trimmers and chainsaws, {{which may be}} as small as [...] piston displacement. The most common are four-stroke air-cooled single-cylinder engines running on <b>either</b> <b>petrol</b> <b>or</b> diesel.|$|R
50|$|The Marea petrol and JTD engines 1.6 L, 1.8 L and 2.0 L petrol and 1.9 L were sourced {{from the}} Brava and Bravo, and a 2.0 20v turbo option from the Fiat Coupé was also available. For {{a short time}} {{there was also a}} 2.4 {{turbodiesel}} available, dropped in 2001, which has become sought after. A BiPower 1.6 L dual fuel engine was later added to the range. It can run on <b>either</b> <b>petrol</b> <b>or</b> compressed natural gas.|$|R
5000|$|In June 2006, PrinceGas and Volkswagen {{launched}} the Sharan with a 2.0 L [...] flexible fuel engine, which {{could work with}} <b>either</b> <b>petrol</b> <b>or</b> autogas (liquified petroleum gas), providing an additional 450 km range over the regular 2.0L petrol engine. Both fuel tanks, the 70L (18 US gallon) petrol tank and the 60L liquid gas tank combined, give the Sharan enough fuel to cover 730 km between refuels at an average fuel consumption of 9.6 L/100 km.|$|R
50|$|LPG {{has a lower}} {{energy density}} per liter than <b>either</b> <b>petrol</b> <b>or</b> fuel-oil, so the {{equivalent}} fuel consumption is higher. Many governments impose less tax on <b>LPG</b> than on <b>petrol</b> <b>or</b> fuel-oil, which helps offset the greater consumption of <b>LPG</b> than of <b>petrol</b> <b>or</b> fuel-oil. However, in many European countries this tax break is often compensated by a much higher annual tax on cars using LPG than on cars using <b>petrol</b> <b>or</b> fuel-oil. Propane is the third most widely used motor fuel in the world. 2013 estimates are that over 24.9 million vehicles are fueled by propane gas worldwide. Over 25 million tonnes (over 9 billion US gallons) are used annually as a vehicle fuel.|$|R
50|$|A {{flex fuel}} {{conversion}} kit is a kit {{that allows a}} conventional equipment manufactured vehicle to be altered to run on <b>either</b> <b>petrol,</b> E85 <b>or</b> any combination thereof. They're legal in every state except California, due to that state having its own clean air standards.|$|R
50|$|Petrol engined cars {{which have}} not been fitted with LPG/autogas systems by the {{manufacturers}} can usually accept third party systems {{to enable them to}} use <b>either</b> <b>LPG</b> <b>or</b> <b>petrol.</b>|$|R
50|$|Introduced for 1987, the British market {{received}} the new L300 with <b>either</b> the 1.6- <b>petrol</b> <b>or</b> 2.5-liter diesel engine. Both wheelbases were available.|$|R
2500|$|There are {{approximately}} [...] of serviceable roadway in France, ranking {{it the most}} extensive network of the European continent. The Paris region is enveloped with the most dense network of roads and highways that connect it with virtually {{all parts of the}} country. French roads also handle substantial international traffic, connecting with cities in neighbouring Belgium, Luxembourg, Germany, Switzerland, Italy, Spain, Andorra and Monaco. There is no annual registration fee or road tax; however, usage of the mostly privately owned motorways is through tolls except in the vicinity of large communes. The new car market is dominated by domestic brands such as Renault (27% of cars sold in France in 2003), Peugeot (20.1%) and Citroën (13.5%). Over 70% of new cars sold in 2004 had diesel engines, far more than contained <b>petrol</b> <b>or</b> <b>LPG</b> engines. France possesses the Millau Viaduct, the world's tallest bridge, and has built many important bridges such as the Pont de Normandie.|$|R
5|$|All entries {{had to run}} Shell fuel in <b>either</b> diesel <b>or</b> <b>petrol</b> form.|$|R
50|$|Modern AFVs have {{primarily}} used <b>either</b> <b>petrol</b> (gasoline) <b>or</b> diesel piston engines. More recently {{gas turbines}} have been used. Most early AFVs used petrol engines, as {{they offer a}} good power-to-weight ratio. However, they fell out of favour during World War Two due to the flammability of the fuel.|$|R
50|$|The Tomcar {{is made in}} two {{and four}} seat models, and is powered by <b>either</b> {{unleaded}} <b>petrol</b> <b>or</b> diesel engines and now in electric. It uses a CVT transmission system and a chain driven final drive system, giving the vehicles a ground clearance of 38 cm (15").|$|R
5000|$|Rotavator: Unlike the Rototiller, the {{self-propelled}} Howard Rotavator {{is equipped}} with a gearbox and driven forward, or held back, by its wheels. The gearbox enables the forward speed to be adjusted while the rotational speed of the tines remains constant which enables the operator to easily regulate the extent to which soil is engaged. For a two-wheel tractor rotavator this greatly reduces the workload of the operator as compared to a rototiller. These rotavators are generally more heavy duty, come in higher power (4-18 horsepower or 3-13 kilowatts) with <b>either</b> <b>petrol</b> <b>or</b> diesel engines and can cover much more area per hour. The trademarked word [...] "Rotavator" [...] is one of the longest single-word palindromes in the English language.|$|R
50|$|A {{catalytic}} converter is an emissions control device that converts toxic gases and pollutants in exhaust gas to less toxic pollutants by catalyzing a redox reaction (an oxidation {{and a reduction}} reaction). Catalytic converters are used with internal combustion engines fueled by <b>either</b> <b>petrol</b> (gasoline) <b>or</b> diesel—including lean-burn engines as well as kerosene heaters and stoves.|$|R
50|$|The Q-type, {{although}} {{based on}} the Twin Coach, had many differences. The most noticeable being whilst the Twin Coach had two engines (hence the name) the AEC Q only had one. This overcame the many complications a second engine needed in the transmission. London General Omnibus Company received the first Q-type vehicle with a crash gearbox although all subsequent vehicles had the pre-select version. The engine was available in <b>either</b> <b>petrol</b> <b>or</b> diesel incarnation and was located longitudinally behind the front axle, intended to be hidden by the staircase (for double-decker version). This allowed the drivers cab to be located on the front overhang with the entrance opposite, even though some body builders didn't use this facility and had a centre entrance. Being a more modern design, it looked very similar to buses built in the 1950s and 1960s.|$|R
50|$|Advances in {{technology}} have allowed for portable hydraulic breakers. The jackhammer {{is connected with}} hydraulic hoses to a portable hydraulic powerpack: <b>either</b> a <b>petrol</b> <b>or</b> diesel engine driving a hydraulic pump; or a mini-excavator or skid-steer via a power take-off driveshaft to the machine's hydraulic system. Hydraulic power sources are more efficient than air compressors, making the kit smaller, cheaper or more powerful than a comparable pneumatic version.|$|R
2500|$|Since 2012, ADAC {{performs}} regular {{pollutant emission}} tests [...] {{on a specific}} cycle in the laboratory duly representing a real driving environment and gives a global notation independent from the type of engine used (petrol, diesel, natural gas, LPG, hybrid, etc.). To get the maximum 50/50 note on this cycle, the car shall emit less than the minimum limit applicable to <b>either</b> <b>petrol</b> <b>or</b> diesel car, {{that is to say}} 100mg HC, 500mg CO, 60mg , 3mg PM and 6×1010 PN. Unlike ambient discourse dirty diesel versus clean petrol cars, the results are much more nuanced and subtle. Some Euro 6 diesel cars perform as well as the best hybrid petrol cars; some other recent Euro 6 petrol indirect injection cars perform as the worst Euro 5 diesel cars; finally some petrol hybrid cars are at the same level as the best Euro 5 diesel cars.|$|R
50|$|This edition {{was only}} {{available}} in European markets from 2008 to 2010 with <b>either</b> a <b>petrol</b> <b>or</b> diesel V6 engine. It {{was available in}} either Brilliant Silver or Obsidian Black metallic paint, and featured a redesigned radiator grille, 18-inch alloy wheels, a chromed exhaust tailpipe, side skirts, and unique front and rear bumpers. The interior had pebble or anthracite coloured 'Twin' leather seats and a choice of grey or brown burr walnut wood accents.|$|R
40|$|Because {{carbon dioxide}} {{emissions}} from the combustion of a renewable fuel are not anthropogenic greenhouse gases, there are significant greenhouse gas benefits in using ethanol that is derived from sugar or wheat, especially from waste feedstock. However, if the ethanol is used as an additive (as in diesohol or petrohol) then some of these greenhouse gas benefits are lost because ethanol is less efficient as a fuel. The vapour pressure of petrohol is {{higher than that of}} <b>either</b> <b>petrol</b> <b>or</b> ethanol, so that it is unclear whether there are, or are not, air quality benefits {{associated with the use of}} ethanol. A measurement program that surveys a significant proportion of E 10 alternative fuel vehicles should be undertaken, along with a parallel program to test the emission variations that result from the changes in the petrol. The performance of overseas models in relation to the Australian situation is unknown, and a combined modelling and measurement program is needed to determine its validity...|$|R
30|$|It is {{recommended}} that the heat release rate for single passenger vehicles is examined again {{in the future to}} account for changes in vehicle design, construction and use. Technological advancements will likely include changes in materials used in which could affect the fire behaviour of vehicles. All of the vehicles examined in this review are <b>either</b> <b>petrol</b> (gasoline) <b>or</b> diesel fuelled. For future experiments, it {{is recommended}} that research be conducted on vehicles using alternative fuels such as liquefied petroleum gas (LPG), hydrogen, electric power and solar power.|$|R
50|$|The X90 Cresta {{was offered}} in 4 primary trim levels {{throughout}} its run (the SC, Suffire, Super Lucent and Tourer), each {{with their own}} options and even more specific trim categorizations. All cars shared common longitudinal layout architecture as well as certain options standard, like automatic climate control and side-impact bars, not to mention driver-side airbags in 1995. The base trim level SC had very little in terms of options; it was powered by <b>either</b> a <b>petrol</b> <b>or</b> diesel engine mated to a 4-speed automatic. The next level Suffire had the same options available (or lack thereof) as the SC plus an optional 5-speed manual.|$|R
50|$|Variable Compression Ratio (VCR) is {{becoming}} increasingly desirable as oil prices increase and car buyers have an increased interest in fuel economy. In addition, Global Climate Warming requires measures from the international community. To the Automobile industry, it means stricter limits to car emissions, especially CO2. Variable compression ratio is one cost effective way of achieving these targets. In addition, VCR allows free use of different fuels besides <b>petrol</b> e.g. <b>LPG</b> <b>or</b> ethanol.|$|R
50|$|LPG {{is popular}} in Australia, {{because it is}} less than half the price of petrol in urban areas (approx -0.75 per litre, as opposed to -1.35 per litre for {{unleaded}} fuel and -1.30 per litre for diesel, as of February 2010), and it is locally produced. The two major local manufacturers, (Ford and Holden), offer factory fitted autogas in some models of their locally made large cars and commercial vehicles. Mitsubishi Australia formerly manufactured factory-fitted autogas vehicles locally but ceased manufacturing in 2008. All factory autogas vehicles, {{with the exception of the}} E-Gas Ford Falcon model, are bi-fuel vehicles, meaning they have the capability to run on <b>either</b> <b>petrol,</b> autogas, <b>or</b> a combination.|$|R
