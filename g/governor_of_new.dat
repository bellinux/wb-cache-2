The thesis examines {{the relationship between}} Britain and New South Wales during the period 1891 to 1914, focusing on the role <b>of</b> colonial <b>governors.</b> The thesis aims to explore the role <b>of</b> <b>governors</b> both as formal representatives of imperial authority and as promoters of a shared sense of cultural community. The central purpose of this exploration is to uncover the patterns <b>of</b> adaptation <b>of</b> <b>governors</b> to local expectation of them over the period and to evaluate their degree of success in furthering imperial interests by so doing. [...] Evolution of the role <b>of</b> <b>governor</b> in the pivotal decades before and after Federation is explored by examination of three key themes. The first theme deals with local and imperial expectations of the role itself, and of the qualifications thought necessary for appointment to the office. The second theme explores governors' performance of the political duties of their role and traces how the imperial representative had {{to adapt to the}} changing circumstances over the period. Finally, a key contribution to historical knowledge involves an exploration <b>of</b> the <b>governor's</b> social and cultural performance. Just as the rise of the British 'welfare monarchy' during this period concentrated on developing a renewed image of community-binding benevolence, it is argued, so it also provided a model for governors to follow in New South Wales.

5|$|The Port Authority is jointly {{controlled}} by the governors of New York and New Jersey, who appoint {{the members of the}} agency's Board of Commissioners and retain the right to veto the actions of the Commissioners from his or her own state. Each governor appoints six members to the Board of Commissioners, who are subject to state senate confirmation and serve overlapping six-year terms without pay. An Executive Director is appointed by the Board of Commissioners to deal with day-to-day operations and to execute the Port Authority's policies. Under an informal power-sharing agreement, the <b>Governor</b> <b>of</b> <b>New</b> Jersey chooses {{the chairman of the board}} and the deputy executive director, while the <b>Governor</b> <b>of</b> <b>New</b> York selects the vice-chairman and Executive Director.|$|E

5|$|At a {{referendum}} held on January 14, 1895, 46 of 53 voters approved incorporation as a Borough.

A bill supporting the creation of the Township of Teaneck was put through the New Jersey General Assembly on February 18, 1895, and the New Jersey Senate on the next day. <b>Governor</b> <b>of</b> <b>New</b> Jersey George Werts signed the bill into law, and Teaneck was an independent municipality.|$|E
5|$|Bellomont sailed for New York in late 1697, {{accompanied}} by his wife and her cousin, John Nanfan, who had been appointed Lieutenant <b>Governor</b> <b>of</b> <b>New</b> York.

Bellomont's stylish dress, good looks, and positive relationship with the king predisposed New Yorkers to like him, but he very quickly ran into difficulties and began making enemies.|$|E
