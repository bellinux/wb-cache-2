5|$|Air {{travel is}} {{discouraged}} {{for up to}} seven days after complete resolution of a pneumothorax if recurrence does not occur. Underwater diving is considered unsafe after an episode of pneumothorax unless a preventative procedure has been performed. Professional guidelines suggest that pleurectomy be performed on both lungs and that lung function tests and CT scan normalize before diving is resumed. Aircraft pilots may also require assessment <b>for</b> <b>surgery.</b>|$|E
5|$|Radiotherapy {{is often}} given {{together}} with chemotherapy, {{and may be}} used with curative intent in people with NSCLC who are not eligible <b>for</b> <b>surgery.</b> This form of high-intensity radiotherapy is called radical radiotherapy. A refinement of this technique is continuous hyperfractionated accelerated radiotherapy (CHART), in which a high dose of radiotherapy is given {{in a short time}} period. Postoperative thoracic radiotherapy generally should not be used after curative intent surgery for NSCLC. Some people with mediastinal N2 lymph node involvement might benefit from post-operative radiotherapy.|$|E

5|$|Aboard his flagship, , Pohl {{conducted}} {{a series of}} short operations into the North Sea over the course of 1915. None of these operations ventured outside of {{the southern end of the}} North Sea, and the fleet never encountered any British forces. Pohl became seriously ill from liver cancer on 8 January 1916 and was taken to a hospital ship. He was subsequently moved to Berlin <b>for</b> <b>surgery.</b> He was relieved of command due to his poor health on 23 January; his replacement as fleet commander was Reinhard Scheer. Pohl died a month later, on 23 February. Shortly before his death, he was awarded the Order of the Red Eagle with oak leaves and swords for his command of the fleet. In 1920, Pohl's widow Ella published some of his papers in an effort to defend his reputation from postwar criticisms.|$|E

When {{the pain in his}} hip quickly got worse, Cloutier appealed to team management. He saw a specialist who diagnosed him with a torn hip labrum and told him the injury could put his career in jeopardy. He was subsequently flown to Colorado <b>for</b> <b>surgery</b> on January 12, 2007. Cloutier remained in Colorado for ongoing treatment and was lodged by the organization in a motel 31 miles away from the clinic. The Kings' original insistence that he play and his subsequent lodging proved to be a contentious issue for Cloutier.|$|E
50|$|Hematoma {{can also}} be a {{consequence}} of breast surgery, usually due to post-operative bleeding.

Sweden missed out on the bronze medal, losing to Russia, 6–3. Daniel had an assist in a losing effort during the bronze medal game. He finished with nine points in nine games, which tied for fourth in tournament-scoring.|$|E
5|$|If {{investigations}} confirm NSCLC, {{the stage}} is assessed {{to determine whether the}} disease is localized and amenable to surgery or if it has spread {{to the point where it}} cannot be cured surgically. CT scan and positron emission tomography are used for this determination. If mediastinal lymph node involvement is suspected, the nodes may be sampled to assist staging. Techniques used for this include transthoracic needle aspiration, transbronchial needle aspiration (with or without endobronchial ultrasound), endoscopic ultrasound with needle aspiration, mediastinoscopy, and thoracoscopy. Blood tests and pulmonary function testing are used to assess whether a person is well enough <b>for</b> <b>surgery.</b> If pulmonary function tests reveal poor respiratory reserve, surgery may not be possible.|$|E
5|$|Instrumental {{in facilitating}} the trade to Florida was Bertuzzi's {{positive}} relationship with Panthers general manager Mike Keenan, {{who was his}} first coach in Vancouver. Debuting with the Panthers on October 6, 2006, Bertuzzi scored a goal and three assists in an 8–3 win against the Boston Bruins. He appeared in six more games for Florida, notching seven points total, before being sidelined with back spasms. After being diagnosed with a herniated disc in early-November, Bertuzzi opted <b>for</b> <b>surgery,</b> which {{kept him out of}} the lineup for five months. While recovering, the Panthers dealt him to the Detroit Red Wings at the trade deadline in exchange for forward prospect Shawn Matthias and conditional draft picks.

5|$|Low {{back pain}} results in large {{economic}} costs. In the United States, {{it is the}} most common type of pain in adults, responsible for a large number of missed work days, and is the most common musculoskeletal complaint seen in the emergency department. In 1998, it was estimated to be responsible for $90 billion in annual health care costs, with 5% of individuals incurring most (75%) of the costs. Between 1990 and 2001 there was a more than twofold increase in spinal fusion surgeries in the US, despite the fact that there were no changes to the indications <b>for</b> <b>surgery</b> or new evidence of greater usefulness. Further costs occur in the form of lost income and productivity, with low back pain responsible for 40% of all missed work days in the United States. Low back pain causes disability in a larger percentage of the workforce in Canada, Great Britain, the Netherlands and Sweden than in the US or Germany.|$|E

When Helen tries to touch his face, Hal angrily storms out. He then goes to the Scott residence and demands money from Clifford and Virginia, whom he blames for his disfigurement. Clifford draws a gun and shoots Hal twice in the stomach, but the weakened Hal manages to strangle Clifford to death before escaping with Virginia's jewels. He brings them to Helen, who is concerned about Hal's injuries, but he flees before she can learn he is shot.|$|E

5|$|Phimosis is the {{inability}} to retract the foreskin over the glans penis. At birth, the foreskin cannot be retracted due to adhesions between the foreskin and glans, and this is considered normal (physiological phimosis). Over time the foreskin naturally separates from the glans, {{and a majority of}} boys are able to retract the foreskin by age three. Less than one percent are still having problems at age 18. If {{the inability}} to do so becomes problematic (pathological phimosis) circumcision is a treatment option. This pathological phimosis may be due to scarring from the skin disease balanitis xerotica obliterans (BXO), repeated episodes of balanoposthitis or forced retraction of the foreskin. Steroid creams are also a reasonable option and may prevent the need <b>for</b> <b>surgery</b> including in those with mild BXO. The procedure may also be used to prevent the development of phimosis. Phimosis is also a complication that can result from circumcision.|$|E
5|$|Schweitzer {{had prior}} {{interest}} in nursing {{and the medical}} field before Albert became involved in medicine.

In the first nine months, Schweitzer and Albert had about 2,000 patients to examine, some travelling many days and hundreds of kilometers to reach him. In her time in Africa, she worked as nurse and helped with the hospital.

5|$|The {{early part}} of the 20th century saw a number of {{implants}} made of a variety of materials. One of the earliest successful implants was the Greenfield implant system of 1913 (also known as the Greenfield crib or basket). Greenfield's implant, an iridioplatinum implant attached to a gold crown, showed evidence of osseointegration and lasted for a number of years. The first use of titanium as an implantable material was by Bothe, Beaton and Davenport in 1940, who observed how close the bone grew to titanium screws, and the difficulty they had in extracting them. Bothe et al. were the first researchers to describe what would later be called osseointegration (a name that would be marketed later on by Per-Ingvar Brånemark). In 1951, Gottlieb Leventhal implanted titanium rods in rabbits. Leventhal's positive results led him to believe that titanium represented the ideal metal <b>for</b> <b>surgery.</b>|$|E

5|$|The first {{successful}} pneumonectomy for lung cancer {{was performed in}} 1933. Palliative radiotherapy has been used since the 1940s. Radical radiotherapy, initially used in the 1950s, {{was an attempt to}} use larger radiation doses in patients with relatively early-stage lung cancer, but who were otherwise unfit <b>for</b> <b>surgery.</b> In 1997, continuous hyperfractionated accelerated radiotherapy was seen as an improvement over conventional radical radiotherapy. With small-cell lung carcinoma, initial attempts in the 1960s at surgical resection and radical radiotherapy were unsuccessful. In the 1970s, successful chemotherapy regimens were developed.|$|E
5|$|The {{ketogenic}} diet {{is indicated}} as an adjunctive (additional) treatment {{in children with}} drug-resistant epilepsy. It is approved by national clinical guidelines in Scotland, England and Wales and reimbursed by nearly all US insurance companies. Children with a focal lesion (a single point of brain abnormality causing the epilepsy) who would make suitable candidates <b>for</b> <b>surgery</b> {{are more likely to}} become seizure-free with surgery than with the ketogenic diet. In the UK, the National Institute for Health and Clinical Excellence advises that the diet should not be recommended for adults with epilepsy. About a third of epilepsy centres that offer the ketogenic diet also offer a dietary therapy to adults. Some clinicians consider the two less restrictive dietary variants—the low glycaemic index treatment and the modified Atkins diet—to be more appropriate for adolescents and adults. A liquid form of the ketogenic diet is particularly easy to prepare for, and well tolerated by, infants on formula and children who are tube-fed.|$|E
