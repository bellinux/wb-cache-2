5|$|File:Elizabeth_Poulett_by_Robert_Peake.jpg| Elizabeth Poulett, 1616. The sitter wears a jewelled and {{feathered}} caul, a type {{of indoor}} headdress. The spot on her <b>face</b> <b>is</b> <b>a</b> fashionable patch of velvet or silk, glued to her skin.|$|E
5|$|The east face of {{the eastern}} wing has four bays with canted bay windows, shaped end gables and a central cartouche. In {{the centre of the}} {{northern}} (garden) <b>face</b> <b>is</b> <b>a</b> large bow window, originally Jacobean, which illuminates the chapel; it has stone panels decorated with cartouches below arched stained glass lights. This face otherwise reverses the main façade, with the addition of mezzanine windows.|$|E
25|$|Uniform polyhedra are vertex-transitive {{and every}} <b>face</b> <b>is</b> <b>a</b> regular polygon.|$|E

25|$|Uniform: vertex-transitive {{and every}} <b>face</b> <b>is</b> <b>a</b> regular polygon, i.e., it is regular, quasi-regular or semi-regular. A uniform dual is face-transitive and has regular vertices, {{but is not}} {{necessarily}} vertex-transitive.|$|E
25|$|Such an {{assignment}} is always possible when the outer <b>face</b> <b>is</b> <b>a</b> triangle, {{and so this}} method {{can be used to}} realize any polyhedral graph that has a triangular face.|$|E
25|$|Heptagonal pyramid: One <b>face</b> <b>is</b> <b>a</b> heptagon (usually regular), and the {{remaining}} seven faces are triangles (usually isosceles). It is not possible for all triangular faces to be equilateral.|$|E
50|$|<b>Face</b> to <b>Face</b> <b>was</b> <b>a</b> {{new wave}} quintet from Boston, Massachusetts.|$|R
40|$|The {{accurate}} {{perception of}} <b>faces</b> <b>is</b> <b>a</b> critical cognitive function and {{is fundamental to}} {{the interpretation of the}} complex social interactions we experience. The ability to process and recognise <b>faces</b> <b>is</b> <b>a</b> basic visual skill exercised by healthy humans from the early stages of development, which increases in accuracy as the visual system mature...|$|R
50|$|A {{polyhedron}} {{with eight}} <b>faces</b> <b>is</b> <b>an</b> octahedron. A cuboctahedron has as faces six equal squares and eight equal regular triangles.|$|R
25|$|It may be {{concluded}} that the icon <b>face</b> <b>is</b> <b>a</b> very attractive search icon within the peripheral field of vision. The foveal vision adds detailed information to the peripheral first impression.|$|E
25|$|A Pretty <b>Face</b> <b>is</b> <b>a</b> satirical story {{directed}} at those {{young women who}} abandon traditional Burmese dress for western fashions and make-up and those young men who are always working for their own advantage.|$|E
25|$|A zonohedron is a convex {{polyhedron}} {{in which every}} <b>face</b> <b>is</b> <b>a</b> polygon that is symmetric under rotations through 180°. Zonohedra can also be characterized as the Minkowski sums of line segments, and include several important space-filling polyhedra.|$|E

60|$|The {{expression}} on Halidome's <b>face</b> <b>was</b> <b>a</b> mixture of amusement and contempt.|$|R
25|$|Thus, any {{embedding}} of a graph in {{a surface}} {{in which each}} <b>face</b> <b>is</b> <b>a</b> disk (that is, a topological map) {{gives rise to a}} dessin by treating the graph vertices as black points of a dessin, and placing white points at the midpoint of each embedded graph edge.|$|E
25|$|Barf is {{properly}} an eastern shoulder of Lord's Seat, but was accorded {{the status of}} a separate fell by Alfred Wainwright in his influential Pictorial Guide to the Lakeland Fells. The eastern <b>face</b> <b>is</b> <b>a</b> steep wall of scree, falling to the Keswick to Cockermouth road and the lakeshore.|$|E
25|$|Caslon Old <b>Face</b> <b>is</b> <b>a</b> {{typeface}} {{with multiple}} optical sizes, including 8, 10, 12, 14, 18, 22, 24, 30, 36, 42, 48, 60, 72, 96 points. Each font has small capitals, long esses and swash characters. The 96 point font came in roman only and without small capitals. Caslon Old Face {{was released in}} July 2001.|$|E

50|$|<b>A</b> Thousand <b>Faces</b> <b>is</b> <b>a</b> concert dance play by British dancer Amina Khayyam.|$|R
60|$|Her <b>face</b> <b>was</b> <b>a</b> {{sufficient}} answer, and he {{drew her}} down to him.|$|R
25|$|Semi-regular: vertex-transitive but not edge-transitive, {{and every}} <b>face</b> <b>is</b> <b>a</b> regular polygon. (This {{is one of}} several {{definitions}} of the term, depending on author. Some definitions overlap with the quasi-regular class.) These polyhedra include the semiregular prisms and antiprisms. A semi-regular dual is face-transitive but not vertex-transitive, and every vertex is regular.|$|E
25|$|Akzidenz-Grotesk Old <b>Face</b> <b>is</b> <b>a</b> variant {{designed}} by Günter Gerhard Lange in 1984, {{inspired by the}} earliest versions of Akzidenz-Grotesk and incorporating more of the original inconsistencies than some modern versions. Euro sign was changed to diagonal cut. It also incorporates a comma-style cedilla in the medium and bold weights, inward hook in regular-weighted ß, and shortened horizontal serifs in the regular-weighted 1.|$|E
25|$|The {{studies of}} Paul Ekman, a {{psychologist}} who created the Facial Action Coding System (FACS), indicates {{that a lot of}} “thin slicing” can be done within seconds by unconsciously analyzing a person’s fleeting look called a microexpression. Ekman claims that the <b>face</b> <b>is</b> <b>a</b> rich source {{of what is going on}} inside our mind and although many facial expressions can be made voluntarily, our faces are also dictated by an involuntary system that automatically expresses our emotions.|$|E

50|$|Straight <b>Faced</b> <b>was</b> <b>an</b> American {{rock band}} formed in Huntington Beach, California in 1992.|$|R
60|$|His hand {{shot out}} to hers, and his <b>face</b> <b>was</b> <b>a</b> sudden, radiant dawn.|$|R
25|$|At {{the base}} of the {{southern}} <b>face</b> <b>is</b> <b>a</b> freshwater spring, known as Kennedy Spring (Goonininup), which provided year-round water for the native inhabitants. The spring was noted by the first European visitors to the area, Willem de Vlamingh's party, on 11 January 1697. The Lieutenant Governor of the Swan River Colony, James Stirling, chose the townsite of Perth for this reason – the only local spring. He named the area Mount Eliza for Mrs. Ralph Darling.|$|E
25|$|Orange Guy is the mascot used in electoral related {{advertising}} by the Electoral Commission. He is an amorphous orange blob {{who usually}} {{takes on a}} human form, but can transform into any object as the situation warrants. His <b>face</b> <b>is</b> <b>a</b> smiley, and his chest sports the logo of the Electoral Commission. For radio and television, he is voiced by actor John Leigh. Both the Electoral Commission logo and Orange Guy icon are trademarked to the Electoral Commission.|$|E
25|$|Apollonian {{networks}} {{are examples of}} maximal planar graphs, graphs to which no additional edges can be added without destroying planarity, or equivalently graphs that can be drawn in the plane so that every face (including the outer <b>face)</b> <b>is</b> <b>a</b> triangle. They are also chordal graphs, graphs in which every cycle of four or more vertices has a diagonal edge connecting two non-consecutive cycle vertices, and {{the order in which}} vertices are added in the subdivision process that forms an Apollonian network is an elimination ordering as a chordal graph. This forms an alternative characterization of the Apollonian networks: they are exactly the chordal maximal planar graphs or equivalently the chordal polyhedral graphs.|$|E
