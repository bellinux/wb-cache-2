40|$|In many {{countries}} {{the frequency of}} <b>eating</b> <b>out</b> has steadily increased {{over the last few}} decades, and this behavioris often associated with unhealthy dietary patterns. This study aimed to describe the levels of knowledge, attitude, and behaviors (KAB) related to <b>eating</b> <b>out</b> among university students. A cross-sectional study was conducted in the college town in Chongqing, China with a total of 1634 participants. The mean <b>eating</b> <b>out</b> related KAB scores were: knowledge 11. 5 ± 2. 9, attitude 17. 0 ± 2. 8, and behaviors 24. 2 ± 4. 8 (possible total scores: 20, 24, 40 respectively). As the level of knowledge increased, the percentage of highly satisfactory attitude and behaviors increased. Only 10 % of the participants did not <b>eat</b> <b>out</b> for lunch and dinner during weekends in the last month. Gender, ethnicity, mother’s education, monthly boarding expenses, living place during the study, and the frequency of <b>eating</b> <b>out</b> for breakfast were statistically associated with the scores of KAB. In conclusion, Chinese junior students had poor knowledge of and behaviors towards <b>eating</b> <b>out</b> and <b>ate</b> <b>out</b> frequently. Educational interventionsto improve knowledge related <b>eating</b> <b>out</b> are needed in order to promote healthy <b>eating</b> <b>out</b> behaviors among Chinese university students...|$|R

40|$|In our {{paper we}} examine the Western European and {{overseas}} trends of <b>eating</b> <b>out</b> by analyzing relevant secondary data. Behind the increasing role of <b>eating</b> <b>out</b> we can notice several economic social and value changes. One of the stressed factors is time, which has even changed food consuming habits. It is true both in national and international relations that consumers tend {{to rely on the}} services of <b>eating</b> <b>out</b> increasingly to have more free time at their disposal. Consequently there is less and less time on food preparation and cooking so new eating trends are on their way. We assume international trends are also reflected in the domestic market of <b>eating</b> <b>out</b> but in an altered form and their effect can be a bit delayed. Like on the level of food consuming preferences, dissonant trends also appear in <b>eating</b> <b>out</b> habits and, as a result the market is being further polarized. <b>eating</b> <b>out,</b> leisure time, national trends, internatinal trends...|$|R

40|$|AbstractEating out is an {{emerging}} trend {{all over the}} world, especially now when eating in front of other people aren’t a taboo anymore. The popularization of this trend {{is evident from the}} beginning of the 90 s when the economies have gotten stronger, and since it has been growing. There are many forms of <b>eating</b> <b>out,</b> and many locations where food can be consume away from our residence. This paper will be focusing on <b>eating</b> <b>out</b> during a vacation, when people are on holiday away from their home, and their residential city. The goal will be to stress the differences that exist between <b>eating</b> <b>out</b> at our hometown and <b>eating</b> <b>out</b> when in another city (or even more important abroad) on a vacation. To do so, we are going to introduce the reader to the meaning of <b>eating</b> <b>out</b> and the locations where people can dine outside their home, focusing on the locations that are relevant for <b>eating</b> <b>out</b> on holidays. Then we are going to explain the basic behavior of people when consuming food during a vacation, focusing on the choices they make, the time when the food is consumed and so on. At the end we are going to make the difference between <b>eating</b> <b>out</b> on vacation and <b>eating</b> <b>out</b> in our hometown, so we can give some basic instructions to hospitality facilities owners on how to attract more people to dine at their facility...|$|R
40|$|Abstract Background For {{parents and}} {{caregivers}} of food hypersensitive (FH) children, accommodating their child’s dietary needs when <b>eating</b> <b>out</b> {{can be a}} challenging experience. This study explored caregivers’ experiences and behaviours when <b>eating</b> <b>out</b> with their FH child {{in order to gain}} insights into how they support and prepare their child in negotiating safe <b>eating</b> <b>out</b> experiences. Methods A cross-sectional, qualitative design was used. In depth, semi-structured interviews were carried out with 15 caregivers of children with FH. Interviews were analysed using framework analysis. Results Caregivers reported a number of issues relating to <b>eating</b> <b>out</b> with their FH child, or allowing their child to <b>eat</b> <b>out</b> without their supervision. Through themes of ‘family context’, ‘child-focused concerns’, and ‘venue issues’, caregivers described how they managed these and explained the limitations and sacrifices that FH imposed on their child, themselves, and family members. Conclusions Through deeper understanding of the anxieties, negotiations and compromises experienced by caregivers of children with FH when they are <b>eating</b> <b>out,</b> clinicians and support charities can tailor their support {{to meet the needs of}} caregivers and children. Support and education provision should focus on providing caregivers of children with FH the tools and strategies to help enable safe <b>eating</b> <b>out</b> experiences...|$|R

40|$|The {{purpose of}} this {{research}} {{study was to identify}} menu entree descriptors perceived by consumers to be both appealing and healthy and to describe factors that influence food selection and frequency of <b>eating</b> <b>out</b> at restaurants, including consumers' preference for healthier food selection choices in ethnic restaurants. Four hundred adults completed this survey. Six food descriptors were found to be both "appealing" and "healthy. " "Value/cost", "hunger/cravings", and "taste" were found to influence subjects' food selection when <b>eating</b> <b>out.</b> The three factors influencing subjects' frequency of <b>eating</b> <b>out</b> were "value/cost", "hunger/cravings", and "taste. " Individuals who ate at ethnic restaurants at least once per week {{were significantly more likely to}} want more healthy options and nutrition information available on ethnic restaurant menus. Educational level did not influence frequency of <b>eating</b> <b>out</b> at a sit-down restaurant.

40|$|The {{field of}} {{nutrition}} will face numerous challenges in coming decades; these arise from global consumption patterns {{and lead to}} a high use of resources. Actors in the catering sector face difficulties in promoting their solutions for a more sustainable situation in their field, one of them being the lack of acceptance from consumers. We must ask {{the question of how to}} influence consumer behavior and bring forth a transition towards more sustainable food consumption. This paper presents results of a qualitative assessment of eating practices. A group of ten consumers participated in problem-centered interviews and provided data on their eating-out behavior over the course of two weeks. Using the theoretical approach of practice theory, the data gathered in this study were used to form an understanding of the practice of <b>eating</b> <b>out</b> with a focus on the daily routines that influence consumer choices. The results indicate that the practice of <b>eating</b> <b>out</b> is highly dependent on external factors. Busy lifestyles, mobility routines and a perceived lack of time prompt the decision to <b>eat</b> <b>out.</b> Consumers consciously do so to save time and effort and to streamline their schedules. Mobility seems to be an important driver for <b>eating</b> <b>out.</b> Participants try to limit the ways they undertake <b>eating</b> <b>out</b> yet often stop for a meal in-between appointments spontaneously. Findings suggest that nutrition knowledge and sustainable mindsets have little influence on the eating decisions away from home: Participants show a high level of distrust towards quality claims and put their health concerns aside <b>eating</b> <b>out.</b> We can conclude that the act of <b>eating</b> <b>out</b> is strongly influenced by daily routines and those practices that precede or succeed it. Changes in work and mobility patterns are very likely to have an impact on the way consumers eat away from home...|$|R

40|$|American {{consumers}} spend {{almost half}} of their food dollars on food away from home (FAFH) despite potential harmful effects of <b>eating</b> <b>out</b> more frequently. This study examines how consumers' attitudes toward FAFH and their personal preferences influence their behavior of eating food away from home. This study differs from previous work by using the Theory of Planned Behavior (TPB) to model consumers' FAFH behavior. Empirical testing of consumers' FAFH behavior reveals several interesting and important findings. Results show that negative attitudes toward FAFH reduced consumers' frequency of <b>eating</b> <b>out,</b> whereas the availability of healthy food, good service, and convenience in restaurants increased consumers' frequency of <b>eating</b> <b>out.</b> The policy implications of such study findings are discussed.
