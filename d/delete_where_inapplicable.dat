30|$|As {{shown in}} Figure  2, the {{topology}} builds on two axes: (+/−) uptake and (+/−) full, comprising of four quadrants. The first quadrant is labelled attempting, where the uptake is positive, but completeness is negative. This is the response type where students make changes {{based on the}} written feedback they have received. However, the revised version of the text does not make full use of the feedback, thus, the revised text section either contains a grammatical mistake or does not satisfy the feedback. The second quadrant is called succeeding, where both axes are positive. This is the feedback category where students adopt all of what is suggested in the feedback. The third quadrant is labelled as ignoring. The feedback instances categorized in this quadrant describe the avoidance of feedback where uptake is negative and completeness is positive. This category includes response instances where students ignore the feedback provided. The last quadrant is named <b>deleting,</b> <b>where</b> the text section targeted by written feedback is deleted. Therefore, the uptake axis is negative and the completeness axis is negative.|$|R

This implies that he belonged to a fraternal order (like the Masons); later in the same story, he is shown to be present when a high-wire act in which Archie was involved goes wrong. He is shown wearing said lodge uniform. J. B. Cooper is also shown {{to be quite a}} bit older than his later avatars. In later stories, Betty’s father is shown working as a druggist and is called Hal Cooper. Although he has only a middle-class income, he is a good provider for his family. He is also a highly respected citizen, very civic-minded, and serves on the town council. He is a somewhat rotund fellow and, for a time, his hair was white and thinning.

40|$|We present here a {{complete}} classification of those Kleinian groups which have an invariant region of discontinuity and which, in their action on hyperbolic 3 -space, have a finite-sided fundamental polyhedron. This classification is complete {{in the same}} sense that finitely-generated Fuchsian groups of the first kind are completely classified, i. e., there is a countable collection of topologically distinct classes, each such class can be described by a finite set of numbers called the signature; all the groups belonging to any one topological class appear (infinitely often) in the deformation space (defined using quasi-conformal mappings) of any one group in the class; this deformation space can be parametrized as a complex manifold. Our results can also be regarded as a classification of all uniformizations of any finite Riemann surface (i. e., a closed Riemann surface from which a finite number of points have been <b>deleted),</b> <b>where</b> the uniformizing group has a finite-sided fundamental polyhedron (see § 9). The proofs of the theorems are based on the combination theorems [12], the planarity theorem [13], Bers' technique of variation of parameters using quasi-conformal mappings [4], and Marden's isomorphism theorem [11].
