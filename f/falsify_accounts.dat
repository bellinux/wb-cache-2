25|$|Interrogation of the German {{survivors}} {{to discover}} the fate of Sydney began on 25 November. This was initially hampered, as the sailors had been ordered to obfuscate the enemy by falsely answering all questions. Many did not follow this instruction, but their accounts included second-hand information of varying reliability. Several groups were quickly combined together, and {{had the opportunity to}} standardise any falsification: those who made landfall in two separate groups were combined, then placed aboard Centaur with the men from Detmers' lifeboat. However, some efforts were made to keep officers separate from the sailors; Detmers and his executive officer were initially held aboard HMAS Yandra, then transported overland to Fremantle, and while all of the sailors were interned at a camp near Harvey, the officers were imprisoned at Swanbourne Barracks. Not all groups had this opportunity: the survivors rescued by Aquitania were delivered to Sydney, and interrogations of these men showed the same commonalities and inconsistencies as the main body of interviews. In addition, some of the Germans were interviewed, formally or informally, prior to their group reuniting with others; the independent accounts provided the same common elements. Based on this, it was concluded that the true story was being given, and that there were no widespread attempts to <b>falsify</b> <b>accounts.</b>|$|E

50|$|According {{to local}} {{historian}} Jennette Rivers, the townspeople were {{wary of the}} relatively new technology for several reasons. One of the reasons {{was that there were}} many <b>falsified</b> <b>accounts</b> of urinal related injury spreading throughout the town. The townspeople were wary of this new technology and its potential harmful impact and were susceptible to believing rumors regarding health risks involved with urinal use. Another worry to the community was the lack of privacy associated with urinals. Urinals were more exposed than the traditional stalls or outhouses and this was considered immodest by the elders of what was a heavily Protestant community.|$|R
5000|$|There is a {{tendency}} in historical scholarship to confuse the Mani's Living Gospel with another of his works, known as Ertenk or Ardhang/Arzhang (ancient Persian: artha-thanha ≈ [...] "message of truth") or The Picture Book. The Ardhang {{was in fact a}} picture-book, given the name of Eikon in Greek and Coptic. This was a book containing illustrations to accompany and facilitate the understanding of Mani’s cosmology. Photius (or pseudo-Photius) comments on the text, saying that it contains a <b>falsified</b> <b>account</b> some of the acts of Jesus, [...] while Peter of Sicily insists that it contained no such material.|$|R
50|$|In a study led by Leanne ten Brinke, a {{professor}} at the University of British Columbia, participants' genuine and falsified emotions were studied to investigate behavioral and facial cues. Brinke and others found {{a significant difference in the}} presence of facial expressions in real and false remorse. With falsified emotions of remorse, they found that the participants experienced a greater range of emotions, which are close to genuine feelings, while deceptive descriptions of remorse were associated with positive emotions, such as happiness and surprise. The positive emotions felt by participants demonstrating a deceptive description of remorse are likely due to the leakage of genuine feelings from incomplete deception. Brinke and others established that participants appeared surprised because they could only raise their eyebrows when trying to appear sad, which then caused the participants to feel embarrassed, feel genuine happiness, and let a smile slip. In contrast to deceptive and <b>falsified</b> <b>accounts,</b> genuine accounts were expressed with fewer emotions. Participants showing deceptive or falsified emotions overcompensated their emotional performance. Genuine negative feelings of remorse leaked by the lower face were immediately covered up with a neutral expression. Brinke recorded a small number of body language and verbal cues for deceptive participants; instead, she recorded a large number of speech hesitations that cued deceptive and <b>falsified</b> <b>accounts</b> of remorse. Current findings about deceptive and falsified remorse have practical use for measuring veracity of remorseful displays for judges, jurors, parole officers, and psychologists when sentencing offenders.|$|R

5000|$|In 1996 when Gianni {{reached the}} {{mandatory}} retirement age of 75 {{after serving as}} Fiat chairman for 30 years, Romiti replaced him as chairman. A year after Romiti took over as chairman of Fiat, {{he was convicted of}} [...] "having <b>falsified</b> company <b>accounts,</b> committing tax fraud and making illegal payments to political parties." [...] Romiti [...] "was {{one of the most prominent}} people convicted since the start of Italy's campaign against corruption in 1992." [...] Even though Gianni Agnelli was not implicated by the magistrates, some believed that he had lacked judgement in not denouncing Italy's endemic corruption and in downplaying Fiat's responsibilities. Gianni Agnelli in fact had defended the actions of Romiti and the co-accused Francesco Paolo Mattioli, Fiat's chief financial officer. An 1997 article published in The Economist quoted Gianni Agnelli confidence in the Turin Two's innocence and concluded that business attitudes among Italy's powerful ancien régime was left unchanged since the scandal of tangentopoli (“bribesville”) emerged. [...] "Mr. Romiti and Mr. Mattioli had approved a series of slush funds from 1980 through 1992 to provide for Fiat's illegal political contributions and had <b>falsified</b> <b>accounts</b> to hide the payments." ...|$|R
