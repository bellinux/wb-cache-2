The rapid socio-economic growth, which {{has occurred in}} the past decades, has lead to different hazardous conditions in connection with groundwater quality. Groundwater for domestic, irrigation and industrial uses has been withdrawn in large quantities over the years; the aquifers are also increasingly becoming the ultimate "receptacle" for domestic and industrial wastewater. In order to characterise the evolutionary features of increasing saline and human-related pollution, data was gathered by a regionally based continuously operating hydrogeological monitoring network. It uses more than 100 wells, some of which are hundreds of meters deep, equipped with multiparameter sensors, temperature, conductivity <b>and</b> <b>level</b> <b>gauges</b> set up along the vertical axis and connected to a geo-information system. Water samples are periodically taken from the wells, the samples are analysed by chemical, physical and bacteriological parameters with the aim of detecting any farming and industrial pollutants.

The impact of seawater intrusion on water quality at regional level is also discussed...|$|R

40|$|With {{a view to}} {{examining}} the dynamic responses of the wheel-rail interface, a three-dimensional wagontrack system dynamics (3 D WTSD) model was developed and presented widely in the literature by the authors in recent times. The 3 D WTSD model consists of three subsystems, namely, a 37 degree-of freedom (DOF) wagon subsystem, a wheel-rail interface subsystem and a four-layer track subsystem. This paper presents {{the application of the}} 3 D WTSD model to the examination of the effect of track geometry irregularities on the lateral and vertical dynamic impact forces. The simulated dynamic responses at the wheel-rail interface due to some geometric irregularities, namely, the ariation of cross <b>level</b> <b>and</b> <b>gauge</b> are presented. The characteristics of the dynamic responses due to these track irregularities are examined. The sensitivity of the dynamic responses to the variation of cross <b>level</b> <b>and</b> <b>gauge</b> are also presented.

40|$|Cities are {{particularly}} vulnerable to rainfall-generated floods that are typically characterised by their rapid onset and localised nature. This implies that precipitation and catchment information need to be available at high resolution to reliably predict hydrological response and potential flooding. On the contrary, urban areas constitute a major knowledge gap as most flood risk studies have concentrated on natural basins and records of rain <b>gauges</b> <b>and</b> water <b>level</b> <b>gauges</b> in cities are scarce. While increase in intense precipitation {{as a result of}} climate change is expected in many areas around the world, it is at present not possible to assess how this will affect urban pluvial flood risk. Collection of reliable, high resolution data in cities needs to start urgently to build up datasets in support of urban flood risk assessment and to enable detection of changes in flood risk whether these are induced by climate change, urbanisation or other future developments. This study shows how implementation of polarimetric X-band radar can contribute to filling the knowledge gap of flood risk quantification in cities.

40|$|Two main {{approaches}} to enhance urban pluvial flood prediction were developed and tested in this research: (1) short-term rainfall forecast based on rain gauge networks, and (2) customisation of urban drainage models to improve hydraulic simulation speed. Rain <b>gauges</b> <b>and</b> <b>level</b> <b>gauges</b> were {{installed in the}} Coimbra (Portugal) and Redbridge (UK) catchment areas. The collected data {{was used to test}} and validate the approaches developed. When radar data is not available urban pluvial flooding forecasting can be based on networks of rain gauges. Improvements were made in the Support Vector Machine (SVM) technique to extrapolate rainfall time series. These improvements are: enhancing SVM prediction using Singular Spectrum Analysis (SSA) for pre-processing data; combining SSA and SVM with a statistical analysis that gives stochastic results. A method that integrates the SVM and Cascade-based downscaling techniques was also developed to carry out high-resolution (5 -min) precipitation forecasting with longer lead time. Tests carried out with historical data showed that the new stochastic approach was useful for estimating the level of confidence of the rainfall forecast. The integration of the cascade method demonstrates the possibility of generating high-resolution rainfall forecasts with longer lead time. Tests carried out with the collected data showed that water level in sewers can be predicted: 30 minutes in advance (in Coimbra), and 45 minutes in advance (in Redbridge). A method for simplifying 1 D 1 D networks is presented that increases computational speed while maintaining good accuracy. A new hybrid model concept was developed which combines 1 D 1 D and 1 D 2 D approaches in the same model to achieve a balance between runtime and accuracy. While the 1 D 2 D model runs in about 45 minutes in Redbridge, the 1 D 1 D and the hybrid models both run in less than 5 minutes, making this new model suitable for flood forecasting.

The P-type had fiberglass fender flares over the wheel wells, while the L-type did not. The P-type was also standard with the more sporty eight-way adjustable seats. The P-type {{did not get the}} option of a leather interior until 1983. All editions of the P-type had the same 14x7-inch aluminum alloy wheels and throughout the years the L-type had 14x5.5-inch wheels until 1985 when they were changed to a P-type styled 15x6.

One area is the island Petersaue in the river Rhine at river-km 500 with a water residence time of less than some weeks. The other is the bent of the river Rhine between river-km 460 and 468 with water residence times of the wells of up to several years. Furthermore immunoassays were investigated for their applicability in testing raw water samples for pesticides. An immunoassay for mecoprop was developed. Mainly the following pesticides were found. Atrazine: It is stable under oxiding conditions and disintegrates under reducing conditions. The substance is likely to originate from soil run-off. Bentazone and Mecoprop: These pesticides are stable for years under reducing conditions. In oxidizing environmental they decay in a few weeks time. The intake into the groundwater is via industrial discharge which infiltrates from the river Rhine.

However, {{due to the lack}} of seepage data on an appropriate spatial scale, no quantitative relationships have been established as yet between seepage and the occurrence of seepage-dependent plant communities. Since there is no established method to directly measure upward seepage in the field, we investigated the possibility of inferring the seepage intensity by using measurable hydrological quantities such as ground <b>and</b> surface-water <b>levels.</b> To this end, we designed 16 representative plots of virtual hydrological situations, using known sets of geohydrological parameters. Then we applied the integrated soil-water-atmosphere-plant model SWAP to generate 'measured' time series of ground <b>and</b> surface-water <b>levels</b> for these plots. Finally, using the SCEM-UA optimisation algorithm, we calibrated parameters that affect seepage onto these time series. We analysed how the accuracy and uncertainty of calibrated seepage fluxes depend on the measurement interval of input data and on the accuracy and uncertainty of inferred local geohydrological parameters and boundary conditions. Our analysis shows that it is possible to make reliable estimates of seepage intensities from data provided by easy to place piezometers <b>and</b> water <b>level</b> <b>gauges.</b> For application on real datasets, the analysis gives insight into the limitations of both the approach and the data requirements.
