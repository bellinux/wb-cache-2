5000|$|La Bomba. La Bomba." [...] Primer libro de Gurriarán sobre la cuestión armenia publicado por Editorial Planeta en 1982, año y medio después del atentado por bomba que sufrió en la Plaza España de Madrid. Es un relato biográfico y directo del autor, en el que vierte pensamientos y sensaciones, miedos y esperanzas desde aquella noche del 29 de diciembre de 1980 en la que una potente carga explosiva, colocada por nacionalistas armenios del ESALA (Ejército Secreto para la Liberación de Armenia), contra unas líneas aéreas, le dejó malherido. Es la búsqueda incesante de los porqués de este atentado, la investigación y reconstrucción de los hechos por parte de quien siempre militó en las filas del pacisfismo y era devoto de Gandhi, Lhuter King y Lanza del Vasto. El autor logró reunirse en Líbano con los autores del atentado, y con dirigentes del ESALA. En 2011 Sirar Ediciones publica el libro en armenio. En 2015 se edita en francés (Editorial Thadée). Este mismo año y con motivo del 100 aniversario del Genocidio Armenio, el {{director}} de cine Robert Guédiguian realiza y presenta en el <b>Festival</b> <b>de</b> Cine <b>de</b> <b>Cannes</b> (Francia) la película [...] "Une histoire de fou" [...] (Una {{historia de}} locos) basada en este libro.
