25|$|Gigi makes a wager {{during a}} card match with Gaston, {{suggesting}} {{that if he}} loses, <b>he</b> <b>has</b> <b>to</b> <b>take</b> her grandmother and her to the sea {{with him when he}} goes on vacation. Gaston agrees, and they all travel to Trouville. While Gaston and Gigi spend countless hours having fun together, Honor√© and Madame Alvarez reveal their once-passionate relationship. While other women at the resort are shown holding perfect poise constantly, and giving off an air of boredom and disdain for anything unfamiliar, Gigi is pulling Gaston out of his depressive rut with her carefree, fun attitude.|$|E
500|$|Everyone in {{the office}} tells Andy that quitting is a foolish move {{and that he has}} no chance of {{achieving}} stardom. Andy eventually goes back on his decision, and David allows him to stay on in a sales position. However, mere hours later Andy feels that he is only sticking with his Dundler-Mifflin job because it is safe and that <b>he</b> <b>has</b> <b>to</b> <b>take</b> a shot at achieving fame. Fearing his conviction will falter a second time, he decides he cannot simply quit, but get fired. This proves difficult as he is unable to make himself go through with any offense more serious than defecating on David's car. Andy bids farewell to his coworkers with an unexpectedly moving rendition of [...] "I Will Remember You", prompting them to comment to the documentary crew that he may have star potential after all.|$|E

500|$|Tritter first {{appears in}} the episode [...] "Fools for Love". His {{character}} is a police detective who suffers from a severe irritation {{in the area of}} his groin, which he believes to be caused by a sexually transmitted disease, and who becomes a patient of the walk-in clinic. Although House diagnoses Tritter with dry skin, a common side effect of the nicotine gum that Tritter is chewing, Tritter requests that a sample be tested. House declines on the grounds that he has already met this month's quota for indulging [...] "stubborn idiots". After Tritter causes House to trip, the doctor feigns acquiescence, but insists <b>he</b> <b>has</b> <b>to</b> <b>take</b> Tritter's temperature rectally. After inserting the thermometer, House leaves the room, with no intention of returning. Tritter later complains about his treatment to House's boss, Lisa Cuddy (Lisa Edelstein), saying that he would rather [...] "beat the crap out of" [...] House than sue him; however, House refuses to apologize. Later that night, Tritter pulls House over for a traffic violation and arrests him after finding Vicodin pills in his pocket.|$|E

50|$|It was a {{controversial}} pass {{by the young}} Honda rider and one that the two participants still dispute to this day.

5000|$|Wes {{injured his}} right leg while {{shooting}} High 5 Basketball on October 25, 2015. <b>He</b> <b>had</b> <b>to</b> <b>take</b> a three month break until February 2017 (expected).|$|R

6000|$|... "But {{he must be}} back on Saturday," [...] {{continued}} the widow, [...] "for he could get no clergyman to take his duty. Indeed, <b>he</b> <b>has</b> <b>to</b> <b>take</b> the evening service at West Putford as well." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I'm flattered. This costume {{was adopted}} {{with a view}} to economy and comfort. The worst of a man's wearing smart clothes is that {{whenever}} he wants to do anything useful <b>he</b> <b>has</b> <b>to</b> <b>take</b> them off." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Well, he isn't frightened now, yet {{just look}} at him go," [...] {{retorted}} Jimmy. [...] "Says he has got a beautiful voice, and that <b>he</b> <b>has</b> <b>to</b> <b>take</b> part in the spring chorus at the Smiling Pool {{and that he is}} late." ...|$|E
50|$|The British commander, Frederick Stanley Maude, decided that, {{in order}} to avert these threats, <b>he</b> <b>had</b> <b>to</b> <b>take</b> control of the Samarrah railroad, running 130 km north of Baghdad.|$|R

6000|$|... "How should you? Well, I'll tell you. My private name is Dox, but a King can't {{be called}} by his private name; <b>he</b> <b>has</b> <b>to</b> <b>take</b> {{one that is}} {{official}}. Therefore my official name is King Renard the Fourth. Ren-ard with the accent on the 'Ren'." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Mappin {{has more}} sense. He stays in his office, {{which is how}} money is made. You don't, as a rule, get much for {{doing this kind of}} thing. Still, <b>he</b> <b>has</b> <b>to</b> <b>take</b> some chances, and one he didn't size up right is going back on him. When I'm feeling tired and hungry I like to think of my meeting with that man." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "It {{is an old}} man," [...] she said, [...] "who has the {{rheumatism}} {{so badly}} that he cannot move. <b>He</b> <b>has</b> <b>to</b> <b>take</b> his medicine every hour, and his wife is worn out sitting up and giving it to him, and Sister Agatha and I were sent {{to take care of}} him during the morning, and let the poor old woman get some sleep." ...|$|E
50|$|A {{couple of}} months later <b>he</b> <b>had</b> <b>to</b> undergo surgery on his left shoulder, {{following}} a fall while running on a treadmill, after which <b>he</b> <b>had</b> <b>to</b> <b>take</b> a year off swimming.|$|R

6000|$|... "Nope, I'm {{going to}} make one more change. Gee! I can't go on working for you. The problem of any man working for a woman boss is hard enough.

And it's twice as hard when it's me working for you that I {{remember}} as a kid--even though you have climbed past me." ...|$|E
60|$|I forgot when I {{was talking}} {{of work to}} say that Uncle Henry got work the very second day that we were here. He works down at the docks where the ships are. I think he supervises the {{incoming}} and outgoing of the American navy. It is called being a stevedore, and no doubt his being an Admiral helped him to get it. He hopes to get a certificate presently to be a Barge Master, which will put him {{in charge of the}} canals. But there is a very difficult examination to go through and Uncle Henry is working for it at night out of a book. <b>He</b> <b>has</b> <b>to</b> <b>take</b> up Vulgar Fractions which, of course, none of our High Seas Command were asked to learn. But Uncle Henry is stooping to them.|$|E
60|$|And {{therefore}} {{he will never}} do anything but fail, {{when he tries to}} find out the life in things. How can he, when <b>he</b> <b>has</b> <b>to</b> <b>take</b> the life out of them first? He could not even find out how a plum-pudding is made by merely analysing it. He might part the sugar, and the flour, and the suet; he might even (for he is very clever, and very patient too, the more honour to him) take every atom of sugar out of the flour with which it had got mixed, and every atom of brown colour which had got out of the plums and currants into the body of the pudding, and then, for aught I know, put the colouring matter back again into the plums and currants; and then, for aught I know, turn the boiled pudding into a raw one again,--for he is a great conjurer, as Madam How's grandson is bound to be: but yet he would never find out how the pudding was made, unless some one told him the great secret which the sailors in the old story forgot--that the cook boiled it in a cloth.|$|E
50|$|In 2007, Hoang was in Alfred Riedl's {{plan for}} the 2007 Southeast Asian Games. However, he was left out because <b>he</b> <b>had</b> <b>to</b> <b>take</b> the final Exam for his high school study.|$|R

6000|$|... "A good boy, sir, but {{beginning}} to be contaminated. Brought him here from Nashville over ten years ago. Eight years ago they proved {{to him that he}} was no longer a slave, and made him d--d unhappy until I promised him it should make no difference to him and he could stay. I had to send for his wife and child--of course, a dead loss of eighteen hundred dollars when they set foot in the State--but I'm blanked if he isn't just as miserable with them here, for <b>he</b> <b>has</b> <b>to</b> <b>take</b> two hours in the morning and three in the afternoon every day to be with 'em. I {{tried to get him to}} take his family to the mines and make his fortune, like those fellows they call bankers and operators and stockbrokers nowadays; or to go to Oregon where they'll make him some kind of a mayor or sheriff--but he won't. He collects my rents on some little property I have left, and pays my bills, sir, and, if this blank civilization would only leave him alone, he'd be a good enough boy." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "SIR,--I have duly {{received}} your note, {{in which}} you claim to endorse my views, although I am not aware that they are dependent upon endorsement either from you or anyone else. You have ventured {{to use the word}} 'speculation' with regard to my statement upon the subject of Darwinism, and I would call your {{attention to the fact that}} such a word in such a connection is offensive to a degree. The context convinces me, however, that you have sinned rather through ignorance and tactlessness than through malice, so I am content to pass the matter by. You quote an isolated sentence from my lecture, and appear to have some difficulty in understanding it. I should have thought that only a sub-human intelligence could have failed to grasp the point, but if it really needs amplification I shall consent to see you at the hour named, though visits and visitors of every sort are exceeding distasteful to me. As to your suggestion that I may modify my opinion, I would have you know that it is not my habit to do so after a deliberate expression of my mature views. You will kindly show the envelope of this letter to my man, Austin, when you call, as <b>he</b> <b>has</b> <b>to</b> <b>take</b> every precaution to shield me from the intrusive rascals who call themselves 'journalists.' ...|$|E
6000|$|As for the Saxons, {{they have}} been beaten these two hours; that is to say, hopeless these two hours, and getting beaten worse and worse. The Saxons cannot stand, but neither {{generally}} will they run; they dispute every ditch, morass and tuft of wood, especially every village. Wrecks of the muddy desperate business last, hour after hour. [...] "I gave my men a little rest under the garden walls," [...] says one Saxon Gentleman, [...] "or they would have died, in the heat and thirst and extreme fatigue: I would have given 100 gulden [10 pounds Sterling] {{for a glass of}} water." [...] [ Helden-Geschichte, ubi supra.] The Prussians push them on, bayonet in back; inexorable, not to be resisted; slit off whole battalions of them (prisoners now, and quarter given); take all their guns, or all that are not sunk in the quagmires;--in fine, drive them, part into the Mountains direct, part by circuit thither, down upon the rear of the Austrian fight: through Hausdorf, Seifersdorf and other Mountain gorges, where we hear no more of them, and shall say no more of them. A sore stroke for poor old Weissenfels; the last public one <b>he</b> <b>has</b> <b>to</b> <b>take,</b> in this world, for the poor man died before long. Nobody's blame, he says; every Saxon man did well; only some Austrian horse-regiments, that we had among us, were too shy. Adieu to poor old Weissenfels. Luck of war, what else,--thereby is he in this pass.|$|E
