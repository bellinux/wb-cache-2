2500|$|Blake’s biographer Gary Lynch {{described}} [...] his significance this way: [...] "Tom Blake is {{the obvious}} link between the ancient South Pacific waterman and the twentieth century Anglo waterman. Not only did he precede most other Anglo visitors to Hawaii that surfed, he understood and adopted the Aloha frame-of-mind and possessed the unique ability to produce water craft {{in harmony with the}} previous one thousand years of surfing's progression. Blake placed surfboards, paddleboards, and life saving equipment within reach of the interested athlete, lifeguard, and seaside visitor. In Blake's life, there was no separation between religion, surfing, swimming, building surfboards, <b>eating,</b> <b>and</b> <b>exercise.</b> At the time, no one guessed that his unorthodox life style would one day become the accepted standard for the beach culture.” ...|$|E
2500|$|Bulimia nervosa can be {{difficult}} to detect, compared to anorexia nervosa, because bulimics tend to be of average or slightly above or below average weight. Many bulimics may also engage in significantly disordered <b>eating</b> <b>and</b> <b>exercise</b> patterns without meeting the full diagnostic criteria for bulimia nervosa. Recently, the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders was revised, which resulted in the loosening of criteria regarding the diagnoses of bulimia nervosa and anorexia nervosa. [...] The diagnostic criteria utilized by the DSM-5 includes repetitive episodes of binge eating (a discrete episode of overeating during which the individual feels out of control of consumption) compensated for by excessive or inappropriate measures taken to avoid gaining weight. The diagnosis also requires the episodes of compensatory behaviors and binge eating to happen a minimum of once a week for a consistent time period of 3 months. The diagnosis is made only when the behavior is {{not a part of the}} symptom complex of anorexia nervosa and when the behavior reflects an overemphasis on physical mass or appearance. Purging often is a common characteristic of a more severe case of bulimia nervosa.|$|E
40|$|Trade-offs between {{current and}} future {{consequences}} are characteristic for the domain of health behavior. Therefore, both <b>eating</b> <b>and</b> <b>exercising</b> behavior could be determined by time orientation, which refers to an individual’s general orientation toward the present or the future. The main aim of this dissertation is to {{provide insight into the}} relations between time orientation <b>and</b> both <b>eating</b> <b>and</b> <b>exercising</b> behavior. The results of this dissertation confirm that time orientation is a shared determinant of <b>eating</b> <b>and</b> <b>exercising</b> behavior. Nevertheless, time orientation for food <b>and</b> for <b>exercise</b> are different constructs that, in turn, have differential relations with <b>eating</b> <b>and</b> <b>exercising</b> behavior. Specifically, <b>eating</b> behavior is mainly predicted by consideration of immediate consequences, whereas exercising behavior is mainly predicted by consideration of future consequences. In addition, these relations can be partly explained by construal level. Theoretically, the results of this dissertation contribute in various ways {{to a better understanding of}} the construct of time orientation and its relations with <b>eating</b> <b>and</b> <b>exercising</b> behavior. Methodologically, the results of this dissertation have several implications for the measurement of time orientation as well as the measurement of <b>eating</b> <b>and</b> <b>exercising</b> behavior. Practically, the results of this dissertation can be used in the development of campaigns to stimulate healthy <b>eating</b> <b>and</b> <b>exercising</b> behavior. Overall, the insights that have been gained in this dissertation contribute to a better understanding of individuals’ intertemporal decision making in the health domain and can ultimately be used in order to promote <b>and</b> stimulate healthy <b>eating</b> <b>and</b> <b>exercising</b> behavior...|$|R
40|$|Eating <b>and</b> <b>exercising</b> {{behaviour}} {{are both}} characterized by immediate and future consequences. Consequently, consideration of these consequences (i. e. time orientation) predicts <b>eating</b> <b>and</b> <b>exercising</b> behaviour. We investigate whether construal level {{acts as an}} underlying mechanism of these relations. Students (N= 101) completed measures of consideration of immediate and future consequences (i. e. CFC-food and CFC-exercise), construal level, <b>eating</b> <b>and</b> <b>exercising</b> behaviour <b>and</b> preferences. For self-reported <b>eating</b> <b>and</b> <b>exercising</b> behaviour, only direct effects of consideration of immediate and future consequences were found. For eating preferences, however, there was evidence of an indirect effect through construal level. A stronger tendency to consider future consequences led to a stronger preference for utilitarian (as compared with hedonic) food products through a more abstract construal level. All in all, construal level partially explains the differential relations between consideration of immediate and future consequences <b>and</b> <b>eating</b> <b>and</b> <b>exercising</b> behaviour <b>and</b> preferences. </p...|$|R
40|$|In {{light of}} the current obesity epidemic, {{individual}} choices for food <b>and</b> <b>exercise</b> should be understood better. Consideration of the immediate and future consequences of these choices (i. e., time orientation) {{can be an important}} predictor of <b>eating</b> <b>and</b> <b>exercising</b> behavior. The objective was to show that behavior-specific time orientation differentially predicts <b>eating</b> <b>and</b> <b>exercising</b> behavior. Two studies were conducted among students (N = 55) and the general public (N = 165). Participants completed two adapted versions (for food <b>and</b> <b>exercise)</b> of the Consideration of Future Consequences Scale (CFC), each consisting of the subscales CFC-future and CFC-immediate. Thereafter they reported their <b>eating</b> <b>and</b> <b>exercising</b> behavior. Study 1 showed that CFC-food, but not CFC-exercise, predicted eating behavior. Similarly, both studies showed that CFC-exercise, but not CFC-food, predicted exercising behavior. Moreover, eating behavior was predicted by CFC-food/immediate, whereas exercising behavior was predicted by CFC-exercise/future. In conclusion, behavior-specific time orientation predicts behavior within a behavioral domain but less well across behavioral domains. Additionally, consideration of immediate and future consequences differentially predict behavior across behavioral domains. In order to predict behavior, time orientation is measured best at a behavior-specific leve...|$|R
6000|$|Jenny Lind {{is rather}} tall,--quite tall, for a woman,--certainly no beauty, but with sense and {{self-reliance}} in her aspect and manners. She was suffering under a severe cold, and seemed worn down besides, so probably I saw her under disadvantages. Her conversation is quite simple, and I should have great faith in her sincerity; {{and there is}} about her {{the manner of a}} person who knows the world, and has conquered it. She said something or other about The Scarlet Letter; and, on my part, I paid her such compliments as a man could pay who had never heard her sing. [...] . Her conversational voice is an agreeable one, rather deep, and not particularly smooth. She talked about America, and of our unwholesome modes of life, as to <b>eating</b> <b>and</b> <b>exercise,</b> and of the ill-health especially of our women; but I opposed this view as far as I could with any truth, insinuating my opinion that we are about as healthy as other people, and affirming for a certainty that we live longer. In good faith, so far as I have any knowledge of the matter, the women of England are as generally out of health as those of America; always something has gone wrong with them; and as for Jenny Lind, she looks wan and worn enough to be an American herself. This charge of ill-health is almost universally brought forward against us nowadays,--and, taking the whole country together, I do not believe the statistics will bear it out.|$|E

40|$|Background {{and aims}} The current study {{examined}} the mediating role of maladaptive perfectionism among parental psychological control, <b>eating</b> disorder symptoms, <b>and</b> <b>exercise</b> dependence symptoms by gender in habitual exercisers. Methods Participants were 348 Italian exercisers (n[*]=[*] 178 men and n[*]=[*] 170 women; M age[*]=[*] 20. 57, SD[*]=[*] 1. 13) who completed self-report questionnaires assessing their parental psychological control, maladaptive perfectionism, <b>eating</b> disorder symptoms, <b>and</b> <b>exercise</b> dependence symptoms. Results Results {{of the present study}} confirmed the mediating role of maladaptive perfectionism for <b>eating</b> disorder <b>and</b> <b>exercise</b> dependence symptoms for the male and female exercisers in the maternal data. In the paternal data, maladaptive perfectionism mediated the relationships between paternal psychological control <b>and</b> <b>eating</b> disorder <b>and</b> <b>exercise</b> dependence symptoms as full mediator for female participants and as partial mediator for male participants. Discussion Findings of the present study suggest that it may be beneficial to consider dimensions of maladaptive perfectionism and parental psychological control when studying <b>eating</b> disorder <b>and</b> <b>exercise</b> dependence symptoms in habitual exerciser...|$|R
