5|$|The video drew many {{comparisons}} to the rumors of Carey's deteriorating marriage at the time. Author Chris Nickson felt the video, like the song, {{served as a}} metaphor for the things that were taking place in her life at the time. Rumors circulated that Mottola was controlling, abusive and would even monitor Carey's phone calls. For this reason, she is portrayed with tattered clothing and hair in the video, with the final moments showing her escape. It features Carey finally leaving the lonely and abusive marriage she once was part of, and finally breaking free into the outside world. Unlike the video, the lyrics spoke of setting your loved one free, because it <b>is</b> <b>the</b> <b>best</b> <b>thing</b> for them; showing that their love for the person should be greater than their own happiness.|$|E

During the shooting of Bright Lights, Big City, Fox co-starred again with Tracy Pollan, his on-screen girlfriend from Family Ties.|$|E

500|$|Jagger's knighthood {{received}} mixed reactions. Some {{fans were}} disappointed when {{he accepted the}} honour as it seemed to contradict his anti-establishment stance. A report in UPI in December 2003 noted, Jagger has no [...] "known record of charitable work or public services" [...] although he is a patron of the British Museum. Jagger was on record as saying [...] "apart from the Rolling Stones, the Queen <b>is</b> <b>the</b> <b>best</b> <b>thing</b> Britain has got," [...] but was absent from the Queen's Golden Jubilee pop concert at Buckingham Palace marking her 50 years on the throne.

500|$|Derek Malcolm in The Guardian {{disliked the}} film, {{saying it was}} [...] "too long... and pretty boring between the stunts", {{although}} he admitted that the stunts were of a high quality. According to Malcolm, Bond [...] "inhabits a fantasy-land of more or less bloodless violence, groinless sex and naivety masked as superior sophistication", with Moore playing him {{as if in a}} [...] "nicely lubricated daze". Although Malcolm tipped the film for international box office success, he observed that he [...] "can't quite see why the series has lasted so long and so strong in people's affections." [...] Writing in The Observer, Philip French commented that [...] "not {{for the first time the}} pre-credits sequence <b>is</b> <b>the</b> <b>best</b> <b>thing</b> about the film."

The film follows {{an office}} executive (Elba) whose marriage to Knowles' character {{is threatened by}} the aggressive interests of a co-worker, portrayed by Larter. In an interview with Glam, Larter said that she [...] "was excited to {{get the chance to}} play a femme fatale. I love playing women that are dark and vulnerable and sort of filled {{with a little bit of}} crazy emotion." [...] While the film was released to mixed reviews, Larter was critically praised for her performance. Derek Malcolm of The London Evening Standard felt that the movie was a [...] "dim reworking of Fatal Attraction" [...] and noted: [...] "Larter as the pathological minx <b>is</b> <b>the</b> <b>best</b> <b>thing</b> about it."

[...] Jack Shepard of The Independent, also on {{the first seven}} episodes, felt the season [...] "not only matches [...] but exceeds expectations." [...] Shepard gave exceptional praise to Tennant's Kilgrave, feeling he was one of the best villains produced by Marvel, and possibly [...] "the best on-screen comic book villain since Heath Ledger’s Joker." [...] Forbes Merrill Barr stated that after seeing the first seven episodes, [...] "the answer is a resounding yes" [...] if lightning could strike twice for Marvel Television, claiming, [...] "In no uncertain terms, Jessica Jones <b>is</b> <b>the</b> <b>best</b> <b>thing</b> Marvel Television has ever produced.

500|$|The album {{received}} positive {{reviews from}} music critics. The Guardian called it [...] "the kind of ambitious avant-pop hybrid that gets Björk rapturous acclaim". AllMusic wrote that [...] "Murphy keeps the alluring sensuality and unpredictable quirks that made Moloko unique, without sounding like she's rehashing where she's already been". Stylus Magazine said the album [...] "happily represents {{something of a}} midpoint between the downright oddity of Moloko's early albums...and the mix of disco sensibility and wrenching balladry of their swansong". PopMatters referred to the album as [...] "one {{of the best examples}} of production shaping but not overwhelming the artist's vision". The Guardian agreed, stating that because of Herbert's production, Murphy sounded [...] "sonically enticing and varied…at times sultry, rude, powerful and tender across white noise, waltz time signatures and jazz sass" [...] but was mixed on the album overall, adding that the pair [...] "their noodling eclipse the songs, leaving few you'll actually be able to sing back to anyone". Pitchfork Media remarked that [...] "it's hard to imagine anyone not ranking this <b>is</b> <b>the</b> <b>best</b> <b>thing</b> Murphy has ever done" [...] and that [...] "when the songwriting is on, Ruby Blue seems perfect, the ultimate combination of human warmth and technological know-how". The publication listed the album at number forty-one in its list of the top fifty albums of 2005.|$|E

500|$|Stakes was {{met with}} mostly {{positive}} reviews, although a few commentators felt that the miniseries did not meet expectations. Charlie Jane Anders of io9 applauded the miniseries, noting {{that it is an}} interesting meditation on the concept of change, as well as the on philosophical idea that everything is cyclical. In regards to the art and direction of the miniseries, Anders wrote: [...] "There is so much insane gorgeous imagery in this , including a ton of really fantastic dream sequences. This show is really pushing its limits in terms of pure visual artistry." [...] Anders noted that, while some fans of the show have been suffering from [...] "Adventure Time fatigue"—largely {{based on the belief that}} the show has not moved forward since Finn met his father—Stakes [...] "really feels like a rejoinder to the people who complain the show isn’t moving fast enough with its plots". Writing for Vox, Todd VanDerWerff wrote highly of the miniseries, arguing that it was an excellent example of the coming-of-age story that [...] "shows off the kids series' emotional maturity". He did note that the miniseries is [...] "less a cohesive whole than a bunch of short stories that feel as if they accidentally add up to something bigger", and that the need for every installment to exist as a self-contained unit made Stakes [...] "a little clunky". With that being said, he felt that it ended up being [...] "suitably epic" [...] and [...] "rich with metaphor". Ultimately, VanDerWerff felt that the moral message of the miniseries was: [...] "Change is good. Growth is good. Supporting others' growth is good. And accepting others when they need to change <b>is</b> <b>the</b> <b>best</b> <b>thing</b> you can do." ...|$|E
