5|$|From {{a purely}} {{literary}} and historical point of view, Either/Or {{can be seen}} as a thinly veiled autobiography of the events between Kierkegaard and his ex-fianceé Regine Olsen. Johannes the Seducer <b>in</b> <b>The</b> <b>Diary</b> of a Seducer treats the object of his affection, Cordelia, much as Kierkegaard treats Regine: befriending her family, asking her to marry him, and breaking off the engagement. Either/Or, then, could be the poetic and literary expression of Kierkegaard's decision between a life of sensual pleasure, as he had experienced in his youth, or a possibility of marriage and what social responsibilities marriage might or ought to entail. Ultimately however, Either/Or stands philosophically independent of its relation to Kierkegaard's life.|$|E
5|$|Before their {{collaboration}} on the Diary, {{the brothers}} each pursued successful careers on the stage. George originated {{nine of the}} principal comedian roles in the Gilbert and Sullivan operas over 12 years from 1877 to 1889. He also established a national reputation as a piano sketch entertainer and wrote {{a large number of}} songs and comic pieces. Before embarking on his stage career, Weedon had worked as an artist and illustrator. The Diary was the brothers' only mature collaboration. Most of its humour derives from Charles Pooter's unconscious and unwarranted sense of his own importance, and the frequency with which this delusion is punctured by gaffes and minor social humiliations. In an era of rising expectations within the lower-middle classes, the daily routines and modest ambitions described <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>Diary</b> were instantly recognised by its contemporary readers, and provided later generations with a glimpse of the past that it became fashionable to imitate.|$|E

To understand {{what is meant by}} the descriptions of crying and fussing <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>diaries,</b> <b>the</b> <b>diaries</b> of 10 mothers of 6 week old infants were compared with tape recordings of vocalisations made by the babies over a 24 hour period. There were moderately strong correlations between the frequency of episodes (clusters of 'negative vocalisations') on the audiotape and episodes of 'crying and fussing' <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>diaries,</b> and between <b>the</b> duration of episodes on the audiotape and episodes of 'crying' <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>diaries.</b> To assess <b>the</b> acceptability of <b>the</b> <b>diaries</b> for recording information for clinical and epidemiological research, they were then used in a population study of a wide socioeconomic group.

40|$|International audienceABSTRACT: INTRODUCTION: Studies have {{reported}} associations between diaries kept for {{intensive care unit}} (ICU) patients and long-term quality-of-life and psychological outcomes in patients and their relatives. Little was known about perceptions of healthcare workers reading and writing <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>diaries.</b> We investigated healthcare worker perceptions to better understand their opinions and responses to reading and writing <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>diaries.</b> METHODS: We used a phenomenological approach to conduct a qualitative study of 36 semi-structured interviews in a medical-surgical ICU in a 460 -bed tertiary hospital. RESULTS: Two domains of perception were assessed, reading and writing <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>diaries.</b> These two domains led to four main themes <b>in</b> <b>the</b> ICU workers' perceptions: suffering of <b>the</b> families; <b>the</b> <b>diary</b> {{as a source of}} information for families but also as generating difficulties in writing bad news; determining the optimal interpersonal distance with the patient and relatives; and <b>the</b> <b>diary</b> as a tool for constructing a narrative of the patient's ICU stay. CONCLUSIONS: The ICU workers felt <b>the</b> <b>diary</b> was beneficial <b>in</b> communicating <b>the</b> suffering of families while providing comfort and helping to build the patient's ICU narrative. They reported strong emotions related to <b>the</b> <b>diaries</b> and a perception of intruding into the patients' and families' privacy when reading <b>the</b> <b>diaries.</b> Fear of strong emotional investment may adversely affect the ability of ICU workers to perform their duties optimally. ICU workers are in favour of ICU diaries, but activation by <b>the</b> <b>diaries</b> of emotions among younger ICU workers may require specific support...|$|R

40|$|A five-fold {{strengthened}} narrative function <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>diaries</b> of Anne Frank <b>In</b> {{assuming that}} <b>the</b> total communication situation <b>in</b> <b>the</b> true <b>diary</b> has a character of its own, {{it is suggested}} that the narrative situation is studied, on the one hand, from the viewpoint of the autobiographical contract claiming a bond of identity between the real author, the I-narrator and the I-persona, {{and on the other hand}} from the poststructuralistic view asserting that these instances are not identical to one another and that the implicit author should be duly recognised. A close textual analysis of <b>the</b> narrative situation <b>in</b> <b>the</b> original <b>diaries</b> of Anne Frank leads to our identifying five instances strengthening the narrative function - the real author, the I-narrator, the I-persona, the implicit and the explicit author. While these instances can be distinguished from one another, the bond of identity between them is so tight that the textual construction is a testimony to reality. The five-fold narrative corpus functioning <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>diaries</b> persuasively conveys a message of truth. A remarkable characteristic of the narrative situation is the persistent explicitising of the implicit author, which can be seen as a concretisation of the intention of truth and sincerity posed by the autobiographical contract...|$|R
