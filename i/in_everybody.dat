According to Schwab, the album's title was chosen to {{represent}} [...] "the tension that exists <b>in</b> <b>everybody</b> [...] the flesh and the spirit." [...] It was also representative of their new musical direction, an attempt to polarize themselves from other heavy rock acts. Similarly to their last record, a documentary was filmed that detailed the recording process, entitled I Want Something You Have: Rival Factions The DVD.|$|E
500|$|Young actor Vincent Martella, {{previously}} {{known for}} The CW series Everybody Hates Chris, was cast {{for the role}} of Phineas. Martella originally auditioned for the role five months before his initial pickup, but was left without feedback for the time. When Dan Povenmire was given a tape of Martella <b>in</b> <b>Everybody</b> Hates Chris, he called him to do Phineas for the pilot. He designed a different voice than his own which he describes as [...] "wacky [...] crazy." [...] The creators were afraid of him losing it when his voice changed, though he was still able to retain it for the most part even afterward, though the tone is now slightly different than the original sound.|$|E

Ebonys Zondra Hughes included the show in its list of promising prime-time television shows featuring African-American actors, and identified Peete and Overman as its primary [...] "star appeal". While reviewing its broadcast on LivingTV, a reviewer from Daily Record listed the show as its [...] "pick of the day" [...] and suggested it for viewers who [...] "fancy a giggle". Diane Werts of Newsday found the characters to be [...] "vibrantly well-defined" [...] and the writing [...] "smart, with a light touch". Peete received a nomination for the NAACP Image Award for Outstanding Actress in a Comedy Series in the 37th NAACP Image Awards, but lost to Tichina Arnold who starred <b>in</b> <b>Everybody</b> Hates Chris.|$|E

500|$|Authors Santiago Fouz-Hernández and Freya Jarman-Ivens {{commented that}} [...] "the video portrayed the deconstructive gender-bending {{approach}} associated with free play and self-reflexivity of images in postmodernism." [...] They had initially thought the video as a feminist approach to sexuality, {{leading them to}} say that [...] "the video might also relate to several core political questions raised by feminism." [...] However, they deduced that the scenes showing Madonna in a seductive manner and chained to her bed do not portray women in an empowering position, but emphasizes {{the fact that women}} can be in control because of their sexual prowess. Jarman-Ivens added that the epigraph establishes the status-quo, with a clear distinction of the body (workers, hand, labors) and the mind (elite, intellect capital). Unlike Metropolis, where the line denoted the binary oppositions of the labor class against the elitist, in the video Madonna did not distinguish between the two. Jarman-Ivens noted that the video portrayed both men and women being looked at, actively or passively. The body and the hand are not separate there, instead the heart, hand and head are portrayed as a balance <b>in</b> <b>everybody,</b> male or female. Scholar Theodore Gracyk also noted of the initial portrayal of female sexuality in the video, in his book, I Wanna Be Me: Rock Music and the Politics of Identity, and criticized the video for its portrayal of male domination. However, on close inspection, Gracyk {{came to the conclusion that}} [...] "Express Yourself" [...] was a smart move for Madonna, as it actually portrayed women in a much stronger position. Author John Evan Seery wrote in his book Political Theory for Mortals, that [...] "Madonna with her 'Express Yourself' video splicing together images of machines with images of sex,... represents the ultimate cyborg of late twentieth-century America." [...] Allen Metz felt that the scenes of Madonna grabbing her crotch and dancing were reminiscent of [...] "Michael Jackson's androgynous imitation of phallic masculinity." [...] He went on to compliment the video for its gender-bending depiction.|$|E
