5|$|AD is also {{considered}} a tauopathy due to abnormal aggregation of the tau protein. Every neuron has a cytoskeleton, an <b>internal</b> <b>support</b> structure partly {{made up of}} structures called microtubules. These microtubules act like tracks, guiding nutrients and molecules {{from the body of}} the cell {{to the ends of the}} axon and back. A protein called tau stabilises the microtubules when phosphorylated, and is therefore called a microtubule-associated protein. In AD, tau undergoes chemical changes, becoming hyperphosphorylated; it then begins to pair with other threads, creating neurofibrillary tangles and disintegrating the neuron's transport system.|$|E

5|$|Unsuccessful wars {{with the}} Republic of Venice, the Byzantine Empire and other {{neighboring}} states characterized {{the reign of}} Coloman's son, Stephen II, who succeeded his father in 1116. The earliest mention of the Székelys is {{in connection with the}} young king's first war against the Duchy of Bohemia. The Hungarian-speaking Székelys lived in scattered communities along the borders, but their groups were moved to the easternmost regions of Transylvania in the 12th century. StephenII died childless in 1131. During the reign of the blind Béla II, the kingdom was administered by his wife, Helena of Rascia, who ordered the massacre of the lords who had opposed her husband's rule. Boris Kalamanos, an alleged son of King Coloman, who attempted to seize the throne from BélaII, received no <b>internal</b> <b>support.</b>|$|E
40|$|Part 2 of {{this series}} of two papers {{presents}} the applications of the discrete singular convolution (DSC) algorithm. The main {{purpose of this paper}} is to explore the utility, test the accuracy and examine the convergence of the proposed approach for the vibration analysis of rectangular plates with <b>internal</b> <b>supports.</b> Both partial <b>internal</b> line <b>supports</b> and complex <b>internal</b> <b>supports</b> are considered for 21 square plates of various combinations of edge support conditions. The eects of dierent size, shape and topology of the <b>internal</b> <b>supports</b> and dierent boundary conditions on the vibration response of plates are investigated. The partial <b>internal</b> line <b>supports</b> may vary from a central point support to a full range of cross or diagonal line supports. Several closed-loop supports, such as ring, square and rhombus, and their combinations are studied for complex <b>internal</b> <b>supports.</b> Convergence and comparison studies are carried out to establish the correctness and accuracy of the DSC algorithm. The DSC results are compared with those in the available literature obtained by using other methods. Numerical results indicate that the DSC algorithm exhibits controllable accuracy for plate analysis and shows excellent exibility in handling complex geometries, boundary conditions and support conditions.

40|$|This paper {{considers}} the elastic buckling of rectangular plates with curved <b>internal</b> <b>supports.</b> In contrast to commonly used discretization methods, the buckling analysis is performed {{on a continuum}} plate domain, including its supporting edges. This is made possible by using the Rayleigh‐Ritz method, which employs the newly proposed pb‐ 2 Ritz functions. The pb‐ 2 Ritz functions consist of {{the product of a}} two‐dimensional polynomial function (p‐ 2) and a basic function (b). The basic function is defined by the product of equations specifying the location of the <b>internal</b> <b>supports</b> and equations of the prescribed continuous piecewise boundary shape; in which each of the latter is raised to the power of either 0, 1, or 2, corresponding to free, simply supported, or clamped edge, respectively. Such combination of functions ensures the satisfaction of all kinematic boundary conditions at the outset. The pb‐ 2 Rayleigh‐Ritz method offers simplicity and easy automation so that very complicated plate shapes and curved <b>internal</b> <b>supports</b> may be solved efficiently and with high accuracy. To illustrate the method, the buckling loads for rectangular plates with straight lines, circular, and cubic curved <b>internal</b> <b>supports</b> are determined...|$|R

25|$|Abdallahi's {{resignation}} {{allowed the}} election of Abdel Aziz as civilian president, on 18 July, by a 52% majority. Many of Abdallahi's former supporters criticized this as a political ploy and refused to recognize the results. They argued that the election had been falsified due to junta control, and complained {{that the international community}} had let down the opposition. Despite complaints, the elections were almost unanimously accepted by Western, Arab and African countries, which lifted sanctions and resumed relations with Mauritania. By late summer, Abdel Aziz appeared to have secured his position and to have gained widespread international and <b>internal</b> <b>support.</b> Some figures, such as Senate chairman Messaoud Ould Boulkheir, continued to refuse the new order and call for Abdel Aziz's resignation.|$|E
25|$|Qazi Muhammad's <b>internal</b> <b>support</b> {{eventually}} declined, {{especially among}} the Kurdish tribes who had supported him initially. Their crops and supplies were dwindling, and {{their way of life}} was becoming hard {{as a result of the}} isolation. Economic aid and military assistance from the Soviet Union was gone, and the tribes saw no reason to support him. The townspeople and the tribes had a large divide between them, and their alliance for Mahabad was crumbling. The tribes and their leaders had only supported Qazi Muhammad for his economic and military aid from the Soviet Union. Once that was gone, many did not see any reason to support him. Other tribes resented the Barzanis, since they did not like sharing their already dwindling resources with them. Some Kurds deserted Mahabad, including one of Mahabad's own marshals, Amir Khan. Mahabad was economically bankrupt, and it would have been nearly impossible for Mahabad to have been economically sound without harmony with Iran.|$|E
25|$|Operation Mongoose {{consisted}} of a program of covert action, including sabotage, psychological warfare, intelligence collection, {{and the creation of}} an internal revolution against the communist government. The U.S. still lacked the capability of effectively getting information to the majority of the Cuban people. They had a trade embargo, denial of bunkering facilities, increased port security, and control procedure on transshipment, technical data, and customs inspection. The U.S. also used diplomatic means to frustrate Cuban trade negotiations in Israel, Jordan, Iran, Greece, and possibly Japan. From the outset, Lansdale and fellow members of the SG-A identified <b>internal</b> <b>support</b> for an anti-Castro movement {{to be the most important}} aspect of the operation. American organization and support for anti-Castro forces in Cuba was seen as key, which expanded American involvement from what had mostly been economic and military assistance of rebel forces. Therefore, Lansdale hoped to organize an effort within the operation, led by the CIA, to covertly build support for a popular movement within Cuba. This was a major challenge. It was difficult to identify anti-Castro forces within Cuba and there lacked a groundswell of popular support that Cuban insurgents could tap into. Within the first few months, an internal review of Operation Mongoose cited the CIA's limited capabilities to gather hard intelligence and conduct covert operations in Cuba. By January 1962, the CIA had failed to recruit suitable Cuban operatives that could infiltrate the Castro regime. The CIA and Lansdale estimated that they required 30 Cuban operatives. Lansdale criticized the CIA effort to ramp up their activities to meet Operation Mongoose's expedient timelines. Robert McCone of the CIA complained that Lansdale's timeline was too accelerated and that it would be difficult to achieve the tasks demanded in such a short timeframe.|$|E
