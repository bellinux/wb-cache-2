5|$|Sound that {{travels through}} the outer ear <b>impacts</b> <b>on</b> the eardrum, and causes it to vibrate. The three {{ossicles}} bones transmit this sound {{to a second}} window (the oval window) which protects the fluid-filled inner ear. In detail, the pinna of the outer ear helps to focus a sound, which <b>impacts</b> <b>on</b> the eardrum. The malleus rests on the membrane, and receives the vibration. This vibration is transmitted along the incus and stapes to the oval window. Two small muscles, the tensor tympani and stapedius, also help modulate noise. The two muscles reflexively contract to dampen excessive vibrations. Vibration of the oval window causes vibration of the endolymph within the vestibule and the cochlea.|$|E

The lack of an evidence for an <b>impact</b> <b>on</b> TWP completion suggests that any such impact did not have a substantial <b>impact</b> <b>on</b> the number of months that beneficiaries had earnings above the TWP threshold, which is lower than the SGA amount ($ 640 in 2007 compared to $ 900 for SGA).

5|$|The few impact craters on Triton {{are almost}} all {{concentrated}} in the leading hemisphere—that facing {{the direction of the}} orbital motion—with the majority concentrated around the equator between 30° and 70° longitude, resulting from material swept up from orbit around Neptune. Because it orbits with one side permanently facing the planet, astronomers expect that Triton should have fewer <b>impacts</b> <b>on</b> its trailing hemisphere, due to <b>impacts</b> <b>on</b> the leading hemisphere being more frequent and more violent. Voyager 2 imaged only 40% of Triton's surface, so this remains uncertain.|$|E

30|$|Oil {{price has}} a {{significant}} <b>impact</b> <b>on</b> the NPV because of two factors. Firstly, the oil price has a direct influence on the total revenue of the project, and is {{a key factor in}} determining annual cash flows. Secondly, oil price is volatile, and has a great contribution to the variance of NPV. OOIP also has a great influence on the NPV, and its <b>impact</b> <b>on</b> the NPV {{is similar to that of}} oil price. However, its <b>impact</b> <b>on</b> the annual cash flow is transmitted by the production curve, and not as direct as oil price, thus, its <b>impact</b> <b>on</b> the NPV is smaller than oil price’s. Opex per barrel also influences the NPV. But as its value is small and the variation range is narrow, its <b>impact</b> <b>on</b> the annual cash flow is not large. Consequently, its <b>impact</b> <b>on</b> the NPV is relatively weak.|$|R
