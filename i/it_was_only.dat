5|$|After {{the decline}} of the Badami Chalukya empire in the mid-8th century, {{territorial}} disputes flared up between the Rashtrakutas, the new rulers of the western deccan, and the Eastern Chalukyas. For much of the next two centuries, the Eastern Chalukyas had to accept subordination towards the Rashtrakutas. Apart from a rare military success, such as the one by VijayadityaII(c.808–847), <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>only</b> during the rule of BhimaI (c.892–921) that these Chalukyas were able to celebrate a measure of independence.

About 750 farmers reported damage, {{and at one}} point, flooding isolated 30 families. The only fatality in Jamaica occurred after a man attempted to rescue a family but was swept away by flood waters. Following the storm, search and rescue teams were deployed to flooded regions. Days later, officials allocated roughly $7.6million (JMD; US$86,000) to repair damaged roads. Residents in areas that sustained severe agricultural losses also requested assistance from the government.|$|E

5|$|Because {{the orbit}} of Jupiter is outside that of Earth, the phase angle of Jupiter as viewed from Earth never exceeds 11.5°.

5|$|Betelgeuse is {{travelling}} supersonically {{through the}} interstellar medium at a speed of 30km per second (i.e. ~6.3AU per year) creating a bow shock. The shock is not created by the star, but by its powerful stellar wind as it ejects vast amounts of gas into {{the interstellar medium}} at a speed of 17km/s, heating the material surrounding the star, thereby making it visible in infrared light. Because Betelgeuse is so bright, <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>only</b> in 1997 that the bow shock was first imaged.
