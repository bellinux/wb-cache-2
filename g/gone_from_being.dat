5|$|At {{the end of}} 1969 Torrijos went to Mexico on holiday. A coup was {{launched}} in his absence, in which Noriega's loyalty allowed Torrijos {{to hang on to}} power, greatly enhancing Torrijos's image. Torrijos promoted Noriega to the position of lieutenant colonel and appointed him chief of military intelligence in August 1970: Noriega had <b>gone</b> <b>from</b> <b>being</b> a captain to a lieutenant colonel in just a year and a half, and according to Dinges, had left his undisciplined past behind him. Torrijos retained power as a military ruler until 1981: during this time he negotiated the Torrijos–Carter Treaties with U.S. President Jimmy Carter, which ensured that control over the Panama Canal would pass to Panama in 1999. These treaties, as well as a new labor code that included maternity leave, collective bargaining rights, and bonus pay, made Torrijos popular in Panama despite the absence of democratic elections. Galván writes that Torrijos's relationship with Noriega was symbiotic; Torrijos provided the political acumen, while Noriega enforced his unpopular decisions with force, when necessary. Noriega would provide intelligence, and carry out covert operations, that were critical to Torrijos successfully negotiating the release of the Panama Canal from the U.S.|$|E

25|$|On 20 March 2008, Beckham was {{recalled}} to the England squad by Capello for {{the friendly}} against France in Paris on 26 March. Beckham became only the fifth Englishman to win 100 caps. Capello had hinted on 25 March 2008 that Beckham had a long-term future {{in his side}} ahead of crucial qualifiers for the 2010 World Cup. On 11 May 2008, Capello included an in-form Beckham in his 31-man England squad to face the United States at Wembley Stadium on 28 May before the away fixture with Trinidad and Tobago on 1 June. Beckham was honoured before the match by receiving an honorary gold cap representing his 100th cap from Bobby Charlton, and was given a standing ovation from the crowd. He played well and assisted John Terry on the match-winning goal. When substituted at half-time for David Bentley, the pro-Beckham crowd booed the decision. In a surprise move, Capello handed Beckham the captaincy for England's friendly against Trinidad and Tobago on 1 June 2008. The match {{was the first time}} since the 2006 World Cup that Beckham had skippered England and marked a dramatic turnaround for Beckham.

500|$|The general {{opinion of}} Fountain of the Great Lakes was {{positive}} with some describing it as a cultural achievement for Taft and Chicago. The detractors conceded that as a figural composition, it was ideal in an Old World way. [...] Critics voiced concern over the sculpture's confusion and decorum. [...] One of the basic problems for the critics was the propriety of the symbolism of artistic and attractive bronze figures posed as bodies of water. [...] There had for some time been discussion of the depictions representing relative elevations and the flows of the waters as they seem to do. There were grumblings for closer association of the figures to the lakes by use of physical features, directional orientation and definite contours. [...] Harriet Monroe, a general supporter of Taft's artistic efforts, was disappointed in the lack of representative geographic configuration {{and the lack of}} spirit of the lakes as inland seas. [...] With respect to this specific piece she had <b>gone</b> <b>from</b> <b>being</b> an ardent supporter who felt the model was [...] "stupendous" [...] to finding herself in [...] "doubt" [...] about the work. [...] Taft's human form depictions of the lake failed to capture the imagery of contemporary literature as it related to the power and fury of nature and the heroism of those struggling against those forces in works such as those of Hamlin Garland, Charles Eugene Banks, Willa Cather, or Robert Morss Lovett. [...] Taft's representations of Lakes with quiet trickling water was in keeping with his general theme of quiet dignity for public sculpture. [...] On the day of the dedication the Chicago Daily News expressed this point with a photomontage juxtaposition of Taft's fountain and Lake Michigan in all its fury.|$|E

He sought to retire, but the emperor would not accept his resignation and instead gave him sick leave. Toward the end of 832 Kūkai was back on Mt. Kōya and spent most of his remaining life there. In 834 he petitioned the court to establish a Shingon chapel in the palace for the purpose of conducting rituals that would ensure the health of the state. This request was granted and Shingon ritual became incorporated into the official court calendar of events. In 835, just two months before his death, Kūkai was finally granted permission to annually ordain three Shingon monks at Mt.
