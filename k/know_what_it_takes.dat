The phrase [...] "could make a crow blush" [...] is an early 20th-century Midwestern United States colloquialism meaning that one could unease someone with little effort, and the arranger of Carnes's version was unfamiliar with the term. [...] Others have misheard the lyrics as [...] "she <b>knows</b> just <b>what</b> <b>it</b> <b>takes</b> to makes a girl blush," [...] suggesting a bisexual undertone, although this was unintended by either DeShannon or Weiss.|$|R
