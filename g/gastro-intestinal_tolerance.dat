40|$|Aceclofenac, a {{phenylacetic acid}} derivative, {{is a new}} nonsteroidal {{anti-inflammatory}} drug (NSAID). It is indicated in the symptomatic treatment of pain and inflammatory or degenerative arthropathies: osteoarthritis, rheumatoid arthritis, ankylosing spondylitis, abarticular inflammations, posttrauma or postoperative inflammations. The usual oral dosage of aceclofenac is 100 mg twice daily in adults. Its clinical efficacy seems {{to be similar to}} that of other NSAIDs, but its safety profile, especially <b>gastro-intestinal</b> <b>tolerance,</b> appears to be better. Finally, in vitro studies suggested that aceclofenac may exert positive effect on cartilage matrix metabolism. Peer reviewe...|$|E
40|$|Celecoxib (Celebrex, Pharmacia) is {{a potent}} and {{selective}} inhibitor of the COX- 2 isoform of cyclooxygenase which is used as nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drug (NSAID). Its current indications are osteoarthritis and rheumatoid arthritis. The usual recommended daily dosage of celecoxib is 200 mg (in one or two intakes per day), to be increased up to 400 mg (two intakes per day) if necessary. Its clinical efficacy seems {{to be similar to}} that of other NSAIDs. However, its safety profile, especially <b>gastro-intestinal</b> <b>tolerance</b> and perhaps renal safety, is much better because of the COX- 2 selectivity. Peer reviewe...|$|E
40|$|Azithromycin {{maintenance}} therapy results in improvement of respiratory function {{in patients with}} cystic fibrosis (CF). In azithromycin {{maintenance therapy}}, several dosing schemes are applied. In this review, we combine current knowledge about azithromycin pharmacokinetics with the dosing schedules used in clinical trials in order {{to come to a}} dosing advise which could be generally applicable. We used data from a recently updated Cochrane meta analysis (2011), the reports of clinical trials and pharmacokinetic studies. Based on these data, it was concluded that a dose level of 22 - 30 âmg/kg/week is the lowest dose level with proven efficacy. Due to the extended half-life in patients with CF, the weekly dose of azithromycin can be divided in one to seven dosing moments, depending on patient preference and <b>gastro-intestinal</b> <b>tolerance.</b> No important side effects or interactions with other CF-related drugs have been documented so far.

40|$|Lactic acid {{bacteria}} and yeasts, representing the prevailing microbiota associated with different foods generally consumed without any cooking, {{were identified and}} characterized in vitro for some functional properties, such as acid-bile tolerance and antigenotoxic activity. In particular, 22 Lactobacillus plantarum strains and 14 yeasts were studied. The <b>gastro-intestinal</b> tract <b>tolerance</b> of all the strains was determined by exposing washed cell suspensions at 37 °C to a simulated gastric juice (pH 2. 0), containing pepsin (0. 3 % w/v) and to a simulated small intestinal juice (pH 8. 0), containing pancreatin (1 mg mL- 1) and bile extract (0. 5 %), thus monitoring changes in total viable count. In general, following a strain-dependent behavior, all the tested strains persisted alive after combined acid-bile challenge. Moreover, many strains showed high in vitro inhibitory activity against a model genotoxin, 4 -nitroquinoline- 1 -oxide (4 -NQO), {{as determined by the}} short-term method, SOS-Chromotest. Interestingly, the supernatants from bacteria- or yeasts-genotoxin co-incubations exhibited a suppression on SOS-induction produced by 4 -NQO on the tester strain Escherichia coli PQ 37 (sfiA::lacZ) exceeding, in general, the value of 75 %. The results highlight that food associated microorganisms may reach the gut in viable form and prevent genotoxin DNA damage in situ. Our experiments can contribute to elucidate the functional role of food-associated microorganisms general recognized as safe ingested with foods {{as a part of the}} diet...|$|R
40|$|Enterotoxigenic Escherichia coli (ETEC) {{infections are}} {{a major cause of}} {{morbidity}} and mortality among both humans and pigs. Human ETEC strains affect mainly children and are also a source of traveler’s diarrhoea in regions where ETEC is endemic. Porcine ETEC cause diarrhoea in neonatal and newly weaned piglets. 1 - 3 Pathogenicity of these bacteria is associated with fimbrial adhesins that mediate their colonisation to the microvilli of the intestinal epithelial cells in the small intestine. Porcine ETEC strains express five different fimbriae, namely the F 4, F 5, F 6, F 18 and F 41 fimbriae, of which F 18 and F 4 fimbriae are most frequently associated with post-weaning disease in pigs. 4 Once colonised, ETEC strains will secrete heat-labile enterotoxins (LT) or heat-stable enterotoxins (STa or STb). These enterotoxins will disrupt the water and electrolyte balance in the intestine which will cause severe watery diarrhoea. 5 In neonatal and recently weaned piglets, ETEC infections results in severe economic losses due to growth retardation, increased drug use and elevated mortality. 6 Most neonatal infections can be prevented by a passive lactogenic immunity obtained by vaccination of the sow. These maternal vaccines are mainly applied parenterally in the pregnant sow and contain inactivated ETEC bacteria with fimbriae or purified fimbriae with or without LT. 7 However, this passive protection disappears at the moment of weaning. 8 For the control of post-weaning diarrhoea (PWD), antibiotics are commonly used. 9, 10 Besides their prophylactic usage, antibiotics were also applied for improving growth and production. The long term and extensive use of antibiotics has resulted in the development of antibiotic resistance. Therefore, since 1 January 2006 all commonly-used antimicrobial growth promoters have been banned in the EU member states. However, this caused a reduced performance and increased morbidity in post-weaning pigs and consequently, the development of alternative strategies is required. 11 A wide variety of immunomodulating substances used as in-feed additives have been proposed to help post-weaning piglets to cope with feed transition and stress during this period. 12, 13 The aim of these dietary substances is to help piglets develop an ‘appropriate’ innate and acquired immunity at the intestinal mucosal surface to support a microenvironment for protection against enteric infections, including ETEC. 11 Among these substances, a variety of non-digestible carbohydrates are extensively studied, such as β-glucans. 14 The beneficial effects of dietary β-glucans have already been demonstrated. Indeed, these polysaccharides display immunomodulatory effects upon oral administration and are also known to improve growth and general performance of the individual. 15 - 20 Although numerous articles have tried to unravel these immunostimulatory effects, there is no consensus about their mechanism of action. Understanding β-glucan-mediated effects by elucidating the main β-glucan receptor and its signalling pathway in immune cells is important to use these powerful modulating properties in the protection of newly-weaned piglets against enteropathogens. Another strategy to prevent ETEC infections in post-weaning piglets consist of inducing an active mucosal immune response by oral vaccination of piglets. Thereby, {{it would be interesting to}} use the immunostimulatory potential of β-glucans. Interestingly, β-glucan microparticles (GPs) were recently described as promising antigen vehicle systems with inherent adjuvant capacity owing to their β-glucans. Moreover, these particles are known for their high antigen encapsulation, efficiency and safety. 21 - 32 Unfortunately, developing oral subunit vaccines has been challenging due to numerous potential obstacles, such as the hostile environment of the <b>gastro-intestinal</b> tract, oral <b>tolerance</b> and the epithelial barrier. 33 - 37 Many approaches have been described to overcome these limitations, including enteric coating, encapsulation in immune-stimulating antigen delivery systems and targeting to endocytotic receptors, located at the apical surface of intestinal epithelial cells. 38 Chapter one will provide background information about β-glucans, their receptor usage and signalling, while the second chapter is focused on oral vaccination strategies and the potential role of β-glucans as both mucosal adjuvants and antigen vehicle system. Different methods for targeting particles to endocytotic receptors are discussed in the second chapter as well...|$|R
40|$|Thesis (MNutr (Human Nutrition)) [...] University of Stellenbosch, 2006. INTRODUCTION: The primary {{objective}} {{was to determine whether}} acidified formulae (pH 3. 5 and 4. 5) decreased gastric and tracheal colonisation, as well as microbial contamination of the enteral feeding delivery system, compared with a non-acidified control formula (pH 6. 8) in critically ill patients. Secondary objectives included tolerance of the trial formulae and mortality in relation to the administration of acidified formulas. DESIGN: The trial was a controlled, double-blinded, randomised clinical trial of three parallel groups at a single centre. METHOD: Sixty-seven mechanically ventilated, medical and surgical critically ill patients were randomised according to their APACHE II scores and included in the trial. Patients received either an acidified (pH 3. 5 or 4. 5) or control polymeric enteral formula via an 8 -Fr nasogastric tube at a continuous rate. Daily samples were taken for microbiologic analyses of the enteral formulae at various stages of reconstitution and at 6 -hour and 24 -hour intervals during administration thereof (feeding bottle and delivery set). Daily patient samples included nasogastric and tracheal aspirates, haematological evaluation and <b>gastro-intestinal</b> <b>tolerance.</b> The trial period terminated when patients were extubated, transferred from the ICU, enteral nutrition became contraindicated, a patient died, or for a maximum of 21 days. RESULTS: Gastric pH showed no significant difference (p = 0. 86) between the 3 feeding groups [pH 3. 5 (n = 23), pH 4. 5 (n = 23) and pH 6. 8 (n = 21) ] at baseline prior to the administration of enteral formulae. After initiation of feeds, the gastric pH decreased significantly (p< 0. 0001) in the acidified formulae as compared to the control formula during the trial period. Patients who received acidified enteral formulae (pH 3. 5 and 4. 5) had significantly less (p < 0. 0001) contamination from the feeding bottles and delivery systems in respect of Enterobacteriacea, and Enterococcus., The more acidified group (pH 3. 5) showed significantly less gastric contamination (p = 0. 029) with Enterobacteriacea,, but not for fungi. The 3. 5 acidified group also had the lowest gastric growth in terms of colony counts (≤ 104) of these organisms, but not for fungi, when compared to the control group (≤ 105). Vomiting episodes were 22 % and abdominal distension 12 %, with a higher incidence in the control group. Adverse events occurred equally between the groups with a higher, but not significantly different incidence of 37 % in the control group and 32 % for the acidified groups. There was no evidence of gastro-intestinal bleeding in any patient. Overall, the mortality rate in this trial was 6 %, with 6. 5 % for the acidified groups (n= 46) and 4. 8 % for the control group (n= 21), a statistically insignificant difference. CONCLUSION: Acidified enteral formulae significantly decrease gastric colonisation by preserving gastric acidity that decreases the growth of Enterobacteriaceaes organisms. Acidified formulae significantly decrease bacterial contamination of the enteral feeding system (bottle and delivery set) of Enterobacteriaceae and Enterococcus organisms. Acidified formulae are tolerated well in critically ill patients...|$|E
