2500|$|On {{the evening}} of April 9, 1968, Raiford dropped off a couple of just-freed A {{students}} and was returning home when he violated the curfew. Raiford, now age 61, said <b>he</b> <b>glanced</b> <b>at</b> <b>his</b> watch, quietly exited his car, sensing something was not right. Raiford said he attempted to continue stealthily on foot, hoping the darkness of a neighborhood park would protect him.|$|E
60|$|Gildart could scarce avoid {{laughing}} as <b>he</b> <b>glanced</b> <b>at</b> <b>his</b> companion.|$|E
60|$|Then <b>he</b> <b>glanced</b> <b>at</b> <b>his</b> {{watch and}} up at Mr. Wrenn impatiently.|$|E
60|$|Alison {{noticed that}} Hunter favored {{her with a}} glance of grave scrutiny, {{but he did not}} seem in the least astonished, nor did <b>he</b> <b>glance</b> <b>at</b> <b>his</b> wife. This {{indicated}} {{that he was in the}} habit of accepting without question anything that the latter did. Then he held out his hand.|$|R
60|$|The reply {{seemed to}} {{surprise}} him. <b>He</b> <b>glanced</b> across <b>at</b> <b>his</b> visitor.|$|R
60|$|Hunter {{laughed as}} <b>he</b> <b>glanced</b> down <b>at</b> <b>his</b> hard brown hands and dusty attire.|$|R
60|$|Austin set {{his lips}} as <b>he</b> <b>glanced</b> <b>at</b> <b>his</b> comrade, whose face grew {{suddenly}} hard.|$|E
60|$|Brendon {{dismissed}} {{the subject with}} a wave of the hand. <b>He</b> <b>glanced</b> <b>at</b> <b>his</b> watch.|$|E
60|$|<b>He</b> <b>glanced</b> <b>at</b> <b>his</b> watch. He was wholly {{unable to}} conceal his {{annoyance}} at their appearance.|$|E
60|$|<b>He</b> <b>glanced</b> {{significantly}} <b>at</b> <b>his</b> clothes, but Devine, who rose, {{laid a hand}} on his shoulder.|$|R
60|$|His eye, as <b>he</b> <b>glanced</b> suspiciously <b>at</b> <b>his</b> wife, fell on Trudaine's gift-book, {{which she}} still held unconsciously.|$|R
60|$|<b>He</b> <b>glanced</b> down <b>at</b> <b>his</b> {{unfinished}} breakfast. He had {{the air of}} one who is {{a little}} bored.|$|R
60|$|Wingate's nerves {{were all}} on edge. <b>He</b> <b>glanced</b> <b>at</b> <b>his</b> watch and rose regretfully to his feet.|$|E
60|$|He {{stood for}} a moment on the pavement. Then <b>he</b> <b>glanced</b> <b>at</b> <b>his</b> watch and hailed a cab.|$|E
60|$|Ray and I {{left the}} {{building}} together. As we turned into Pall Mall <b>he</b> <b>glanced</b> <b>at</b> <b>his</b> watch.|$|E
60|$|Jones {{said this}} with a chuckle and a sly {{expression}} in his face, as <b>he</b> <b>glanced</b> meaningly <b>at</b> <b>his</b> companion.|$|R
60|$|Hans, still {{grasping}} the gun, felt {{sure that the}} Indian attributed to him the mangled corpses. <b>He</b> <b>glanced</b> appealingly <b>at</b> <b>his</b> wife.|$|R
6000|$|... "For {{the next}} few minutes," [...] <b>he</b> replied, <b>glancing</b> <b>at</b> <b>his</b> watch, [...] "I think we had better {{concentrate}} our attention upon catching our train." ...|$|R
60|$|Maccario, it seemed, {{understood}} what he was thinking, for his face was sympathetic as <b>he</b> <b>glanced</b> <b>at</b> <b>his</b> companion.|$|E
60|$|A {{few minutes}} later, Nairn {{went into the}} house with Carroll, and as they entered <b>he</b> <b>glanced</b> <b>at</b> <b>his</b> companion.|$|E
60|$|Filled with {{a daring}} determination, <b>he</b> <b>glanced</b> <b>at</b> <b>his</b> note book for Dede's {{telephone}} number, {{and called for}} the switch.|$|E
60|$|<b>He</b> <b>glanced</b> down <b>at</b> <b>his</b> horse's quivering sides. Back {{as far as}} {{one could}} see there was that regular line of hoof marks.|$|R
6000|$|... "Perhaps {{that will}} satisfy you," [...] snarled Bellingham, with hate and fear {{in his little}} grey eyes as <b>he</b> <b>glanced</b> back <b>at</b> <b>his</b> tormenter.|$|R
6000|$|... "Mighty bitter!" [...] <b>he</b> said, <b>glancing</b> <b>at</b> <b>his</b> hosts {{with the}} quick Californian {{suspicion}} of some practical joke. But the honest {{faces of the}} partners reassured him.|$|R
60|$|Their way led {{past the}} theatre. <b>He</b> <b>glanced</b> <b>at</b> <b>his</b> watch--the last act {{was still in}} full swing. He pulled the check cord.|$|E
6000|$|<b>He</b> <b>glanced</b> <b>at</b> <b>his</b> chubby white hand, {{fingering}} {{the stem of}} his glass. [...] "I have put on flesh since then," [...] he said. [Pause].|$|E
6000|$|... "Open up!" [...] Reinhart snapped. <b>He</b> <b>glanced</b> <b>at</b> <b>his</b> wristwatch. [...] "I'll {{be at the}} {{entrance}} in five minutes. I expect to find it ready for me." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "This is Mrs. Schomberg's shawl." [...] He {{touched the}} stuff hanging over his arm. [...] "An Indian thing, I believe," [...] <b>he</b> added, <b>glancing</b> <b>at</b> <b>his</b> arm sideways.|$|R
60|$|Wheeler, who {{had heard}} {{something}} from Gordon, {{looked at him with}} grave sympathy, but Nasmyth made an expressive gesture as <b>he</b> <b>glanced</b> down <b>at</b> <b>his</b> attire.|$|R
6000|$|<b>He</b> <b>glanced</b> unintentionally <b>at</b> <b>his</b> bag as he spoke, and the seedy man <b>glanced</b> <b>at</b> it too--intentionally. Of course Stumps's glance let the cat {{out of the}} bag! ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Good morning, Mr. Blake," [...] he greeted. [...] "Sorry I was delayed." [...] <b>He</b> <b>glanced</b> <b>at</b> <b>his</b> wrist-watch. [...] "Only four minutes, however. I just couldn't {{get away}} sooner." ...|$|E
60|$|To dress, he {{had merely}} to buckle on his shoes. <b>He</b> <b>glanced</b> <b>at</b> <b>his</b> {{fireplace}} {{and at his}} hillside, wavered, but fought down the temptation and started the fire.|$|E
60|$|<b>He</b> <b>glanced</b> <b>at</b> <b>his</b> {{watch and}} looked out seaward. It was even as she had said. There were {{indications}} of another storm. Even while they stood there the large raindrops fell.|$|E
6000|$|... "At half-past two," [...] <b>he</b> announced, <b>glancing</b> <b>at</b> <b>his</b> watch, [...] "I have an {{appointment}} with a woollen manufacturer from Bradford. I hope {{to get him to}} join my council." ...|$|R
60|$|The Colonel {{took the}} other armchair, {{stretched}} his feet toward the blaze, and stroked <b>his</b> goatee. <b>He</b> <b>glanced</b> covertly <b>at</b> <b>his</b> daughter's profile. Twice he cleared hip throat.|$|R
60|$|The colonel {{drew the}} packet of papers from {{his breast pocket}} {{and handed it to}} Uncle John. Then <b>he</b> <b>glanced</b> hesitatingly <b>at</b> <b>his</b> superior, who glared at him.|$|R
