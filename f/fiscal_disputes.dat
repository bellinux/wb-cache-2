40|$|The global {{financial}} crisis {{has caused the}} need for a stronger positioning of the European Court of Justice in the new model of economic governance in the European Union. The Jurisdiction of the European Court of Justice contributes in creating the optimal legal control mechanism of budget spending in the European monetary law and ensure maintenance of euro-zone fiscal framework. The role of the European Court of Justice in the EMU in earlier periods was secondary, but in times of crisis, it points to the growing need of Jurisdiction's extending in the field of monetary relations between member states and respect of convergence rules. Court's Jurisdiction in resolving of monetary and <b>fiscal</b> <b>disputes</b> is increasingly implemented in determining the legal nature of international agreements, whose ratio is economic stability, where the Judgments regarding complementarities of these legal documents with primary law provisions have the crucial impact on the future direction of national fiscal policies coordination. Although, the Court's Jurisdiction in this area is still underdeveloped and Judgments are often conditioned by pragmatism reasons, by development of credible macroeconomic dialogue between Court of Justice, European Central Bank and European Court of Auditors may establish conditions for fullfiling legal gaps in the performance of monetary and fiscal Jurisdiction of the Court...|$|E

5|$|The 2011 Minnesota state {{government}} shutdown was a government shutdown affecting the U.S. state of Minnesota. The shutdown {{was the result}} of a <b>fiscal</b> <b>dispute</b> between the Democratic–Farmer–Labor Party (DFL) Governor Mark Dayton and the Republican-majority Minnesota Legislature, that was not resolved by the constitutional deadline on June 30. The Republican caucuses and their leaders demanded bigger spending cuts, and for the budget shortfall to be met without tax increases, while Dayton demanded some tax increases. The shutdown started at midnight on July 1, and ended after a budget bill was passed and signed on July 20.|$|R
40|$|Do trade {{integration}} and fiscal competition contribute {{to shape the}} economic landscape? The answer is yes. This paper uses a theoretical model and an econometric analysis of Brazilian regional manufacturing employment data over the period 1990 - 1998 to address this question. Brazil is a natural case study because this country liberalized trade during the 1990 s and their sub-national governments engaged in a <b>fiscal</b> <b>dispute.</b> Econometric results show that trade liberalization has {{had an impact on}} spatial developments and this effect is increasing over time. Moreover, subsidies also exert an influence, but their relative importance is falling. [...] Economic Integration,Fiscal Competition,Location Patterns,Manufacturing Industries,Brazil...|$|R

50|$|The 2005 Minnesota state {{government}} shutdown was a government shutdown affecting the U.S. state of Minnesota, {{the first in}} the history of the state. The shutdown was the result of a <b>fiscal</b> <b>dispute</b> between the Republican Governor Tim Pawlenty and House majority, and the Democratic-Farmer-Labor Party (DFL) majority in the state Senate, that was not resolved by the constitutional deadline on June 30. The Republicans and the DFL disagreed over how much would be spent on state healthcare programs and public schools, and what sources of revenue would be used for this funding. During the shutdown, many non-essential {{state government}} programs were closed, and about 8,900 state employees were furloughed. The shutdown lasted nine days, until the legislature and governor passed a 'lights-on' temporary authorization of spending, followed by a compromise budget agreement. In 2011, there was another government shutdown lasting 20 days, after Governor Pawlenty's outgoing administration left a $5 billion shortfall in the budget.|$|R
40|$|This paper {{criticizes the}} idea to {{conceive}} the fiscal federalist reform in Italy {{as a tool to}} empower central-northern regions to retain resources otherwise wasted in the South. We argue that such a view muddles up efficiency and redistribution issues, thus threatening the legitimate inter-regional <b>fiscal</b> flows. To <b>dispute</b> the thesis of excessive transfers to Mezzogiorno regions, we first show that the regional distribution of (both current and capital) government expenditure has systematically penalized the South in the last 15 years. Secondly, for the years 2004 - 2006, we calculate «benchmark» regional fiscal residua, consistent with the progressive Italian personal taxation (IRPEF), and the announced targets of regional policies (45 % of total capital government expenditure {{to be made in the}} South). For most centre-northern regions, the actual residua turn out to be lower than the «benchmark» ones. ...|$|R

Inflation targeting and structural reforms have yielded an enviable macroeconomic performance, including the fastest growth rate and the strongest budget position in the G- 7. The outlook for the economy is broadly favorable, but external developments are creating uncertainties. The Bank of Canada appears to have room to maintain a patient and measured approach to withdrawing stimulus.
