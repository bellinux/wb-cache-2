25|$|Simon was {{interested}} in how humans learn and, with Edward Feigenbaum, he developed the EPAM (Elementary Perceiver and Memorizer) theory, {{one of the first}} theories of learning to be implemented as a computer program. EPAM was able to explain a large number of phenomena in the field of verbal learning. Later versions of the model were applied to concept formation and the acquisition of expertise. With Fernand Gobet, he has expanded the EPAM theory into the CHREST computational model. The theory explains how simple chunks of <b>information</b> <b>form</b> the building blocks of schemata, which are more complex structures. CHREST has been used predominantly, to simulate aspects of chess expertise.|$|E

40|$|This {{research}} {{concerns the}} information design and visual design of {{graphical user interfaces}} (GUI) in the condition monitoring and condition-based maintenance (CBM) of production equipment. It also concerns various communicative aspects of a GUI, {{which is used to}} monitor the condition of assets. It applies to one Swedish vendor and its intentions to design information. In addition, it applies to the interaction between the GUI and its individual visual elements, as well as the communication between the GUI and the users (in four Swedish paper mills). The research is performed as a single case study. Interviews and observations have been the main methods for data collection. Empirical data is analyzed with methods inferred to semiotics, rhetoric and narratology. Theories in information science and regarding remediation are used to interpret the user interface design. The key conclusion is that there are no less than five different <b>forms</b> of <b>information,</b> all important when determining the conditions of assets. These <b>information</b> <b>forms</b> include the words, images and shapes in the GUI, the machine components and peripherals equipment, the <b>information</b> that takes <b>form</b> when personnel communicate machine conditions, the personnel’s subjective associations, and the <b>information</b> <b>forms</b> that relate to the personnel's actions and interactions. Preventive technicians interpret the GUI-information individually and collectively in relation to these <b>information</b> <b>forms,</b> which influence their interpretation and understanding of the GUI information. Social media in the GUI makes it possible to represent essential <b>information</b> that takes <b>form</b> when employees communicate a machine’s condition. Photographs may represent <b>information</b> <b>forms</b> as a machine’s components, peripherals, and local environment change over time. Moreover, preventative technicians may use diagrams and photographs in the GUI to change attitudes among the personnel at the mills and convince them, for example, of a machine’s condition or the effectiveness of CBM as maintenance policy...|$|R
