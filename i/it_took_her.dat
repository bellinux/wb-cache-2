5|$|Following the injury, McLeod {{stated that}} she was {{relieved}} because the injury gave her a much needed break from the national team. After the 2007 World Cup, she experienced a drop in confidence due to both her own negative thoughts about her performances as well as derogatory comments about her sexuality made by fellow national team players. <b>It</b> <b>took</b> <b>her</b> years to finally {{get back to the}} national team.|$|E
5|$|Born in Brussels on 15 September 1505, between ten {{and eleven}} in the morning, Archduchess Mary of Austria {{was the fifth}} child of King Philip I and Queen Joanna of Castile. Her birth was very difficult; the Queen's life was in danger and <b>it</b> <b>took</b> <b>her</b> a month to recover. On 20 September, she was baptized by Nicolas Le Ruistre, Bishop of Arras, and named after her {{paternal}} grandmother, Mary of Burgundy, {{who had died in}} 1482. Her godfather was her paternal grandfather, Holy Roman Emperor Maximilian I.|$|E

5|$|Ellie Victoria Cole {{was born}} in the Melbourne suburb of Lilydale on 12 December 1991. Her mother and {{grandfather}} were both swimmers, and her father was athletic. At two years of age, she was diagnosed with a rare tumour, a sarcoma that was wrapped around the nerves of her right leg. After unsuccessful attempts to treat her cancer with chemotherapy, her right leg was amputated above the knee on 14 February 1994. Eight weeks after the surgery, as part of her rehabilitation, Cole's mother Jenny enrolled her in swimming lessons. Cole's instructors expected her to take up to a year to learn how to swim in a straight line, but <b>it</b> <b>took</b> <b>her</b> two weeks.|$|E
5|$|Kostova did {{extensive}} research about Eastern Europe and Vlad Țepeș. She found a vampire-killing kit at the Mercer Museum, {{which included a}} pistol, silver bullets, a crucifix, a wooden stake, and powdered garlic. As she was writing, she posted maps of Eastern Europe in her office and constructed a chart to help her {{keep track of the}} book's timelines.

Implacable departed six days later to join the BPF and arrived at Port Said, Egypt, on 25 March. While passing through the Suez Canal, a strong gust of wind forced her ashore and <b>it</b> <b>took</b> <b>her</b> escorting tugboats five hours to pull her off. Undamaged, she proceeded on her voyage and reached Sydney on 8 May 1945 (V-E Day).|$|E

5|$|But Beyoncé is {{far from}} being all sentiment. Because a large part of being Beyoncé in America in 2013 is being a sexual {{creature}} and not only being unafraid of that fact, but reveling— and reveling confidently— in it. The amorphous, shifting Houston-trap-meets-Noah Shebib trunk rattler 'Partition' exemplifies this particular sentiment. On the track, the Queen Bey tells her driver to put the partition up because 'I don’t need you seeing 'Yoncé on her knees'; uses Monica Lewinsky as a euphemism for her man finishing on her clothing; reveals that 'he like to call me Peaches when we get this nasty'; and repeats that <b>it</b> <b>took</b> <b>her</b> '45 minutes to get all dressed up / and we ain’t even gonna make it to this club'. And in maybe the wildest moment in an album full of bold moves, Beyoncé actually slips in the French translation of Julianne Moore's 'Feminists love sex' monologue from The Big Lebowski.|$|E
5|$|Some {{of the men}} who {{purchased}} {{sex with}} Falle were police officers, and she knew girls who used drugs with their drug counselors. Falle was brainwashed to believe that her only worth lay in prostitution, which she later said was why <b>it</b> <b>took</b> <b>her</b> so long to exit prostitution. While engaging in prostitution, Falle was frequently threatened by other women in the sex industry, she was verbally abused by her clients, she was stalked, and she was threatened with guns on multiple occasions, including by her pimp. She was also drugged several times, and was once sexually assaulted by an escort driver after having been drugged by him. At one point, she was kidnapped. She had to resort to pulling a knife on people at times when she was threatened with violence. Because of various instances of violence during her time in prostitution, Falle was injured in a variety of ways. Her pimp broke several of her bones and burned her body.|$|E

5000|$|... "A Little Past Little Rock" [...] is a mid-tempo ballad, {{backed by}} {{percussion}} with harmonica and fiddle.

The song features a backing vocal from Womack's ex-husband, Jason Sellers.|$|R
50|$|Candace - Again, Justin takes {{charge of}} this challenge, {{going so far as}} to {{distrust}} Candace's accurate measurements and remeasuring them on his own.

25|$|Alice officially {{sought a}} divorce in November 1932, {{charging}} Raymond, {{who had fled}} to Australia, with cruelty and desertion. <b>It</b> <b>took</b> <b>her</b> two years to obtain his signature, and the divorce procedure was reported to begin on September 1934, but did not go forward. Alice may have changed her mind, but she again officially filed for divorce on May 1937, winning an uncontested suit and a grant of decree nisi {{on the grounds of}} adultery with an unnamed correspondent at a London hotel.|$|E

In the horse's death throes, Mann was thrown to the ground, the horse rolled over her, and the impact broke her back. <b>It</b> <b>took</b> <b>her</b> two years {{to recover from the}} accident and during this time, she made a series of ambrotype self-portraits. These self-portraits were on view {{for the first time in}} November 2010 at the Virginia Museum of Fine Arts as a part of Sally Mann: the Flesh and the Spirit.|$|E

5000|$|Research for a {{painting}} {{is a combination}} of academic books on the subject and infant picture books, which leads to a few weeks' mental preparation for the main elements.
