50|$|A hot top, {{also known}} as a , is a {{specialized}} riser, used to help counteract the formation of pipes when casting ingots. It is essentially a live open riser, with a hot ceramic liner instead of just the mold materials. It is inserted into the top of the ingot mould {{near the end of the}} pour, and the rest of the metal is then poured. Its purpose is to maintain a reservoir of molten metal, which drains down to fill the pipe as the casting cools. The hot top was invented by Robert Forester Mushet who named it a <b>Dozzle.</b> With a hot top only 1 to 2% of the ingot is waste, prior to its use, up to 25% of the ingot was wasted.|$|E
50|$|When steel solidifies in a mould, uneven cooling {{causes a}} central cavity or 'pipe' {{to form in}} the casting. In 1861 Mushet invented the 'Dozzle'; a clay cone or sleeve, heated white hot and {{inserted}} {{into the top of}} the ingot mould {{near the end of the}} pour, and then filled with molten steel. Its purpose was to maintain a reservoir of molten steel, which drained down and filled the pipe as the casting cooled. Mushet claimed this, and other small inventions of his, saved the steelmakers of Sheffield 'many millions of pounds' (in 19th century money), yet he received neither payment nor recognition for these inventions. <b>Dozzles,</b> now called hot tops or feeder heads, are still in use today.|$|R
