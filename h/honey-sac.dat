50|$|Honey bees can forage over a 30 C air-temperature range {{because of}} {{behavioral}} and physiological mechanisms for regulating {{the temperature of}} their flight muscles. From low to high air temperatures, the mechanisms are: shivering before flight, and stopping flight for additional shivering; passive body-temperature regulation based on work, and evaporative cooling from regurgitated <b>honey-sac</b> contents. Body temperatures differ, depending on caste and expected foraging rewards.|$|E
