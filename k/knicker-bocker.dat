His own kind had never come in his way before, his chief playfellow being Amice, who was so much older as to play with him condescendingly and always give way to him. There was a large family in a {{neighbouring}} lodging containing what he respectfully called 'big <b>knicker-bocker</b> boys,' who excited his intense admiration, and drew him like a magnet.|$|E

I hate such skies. Daylight is friendly to man toiling under a sun which warms his heart; and cloudy soft nights are more kindly to our littleness. I nearly ran back again to my lighted parlour; Fyne fussing in a <b>knicker-bocker</b> suit before the hosts of heaven, on a shadowy earth, about a transient, phantom-like girl, seemed too ridiculous to associate with.

[...] we cried to each other; [...] "good!" [...] and Cavor made three steps {{and went off to}} a tempting slope of snow a good twenty yards and more beyond. I stood for a moment struck by the grotesque effect of his soaring figure--his dirty cricket cap, and spiky hair, his little round body, his arms and his <b>knicker-bockered</b> legs tucked up tightly--against the weird spaciousness of the lunar scene. A gust of laughter seized me, and then I stepped off to follow. Plump! I dropped beside him.|$|R
