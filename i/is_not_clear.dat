5|$|George E. Pickett died in Norfolk, Virginia, on July 30, 1875. The {{cause of}} death was a liver abscess, {{although}} whether it was amoebic or bacterial <b>is</b> <b>not</b> <b>clear.</b> He was initially interred in Cedar Grove Cemetery in Norfolk. His remains were disinterred on October 23 and he was buried in Hollywood Cemetery in Richmond, Virginia on October 24, 1875. More than 40,000 people lined the funeral route while another 5,000 marched in the funeral procession. A memorial to Pickett was erected over his grave site and dedicated on October 5, 1888. The memorial was not, however, placed directly above Pickett's burial site, and the exact location of his remains <b>is</b> <b>not</b> <b>clear.</b>|$|E

5|$|It <b>is</b> <b>not</b> <b>clear</b> what {{portion of}} the statute the Court upholds since it {{expressly}} refuses {{to decide whether the}} dues prohibition and fund administration provisions are valid. Section 93(b) does nothing more than impose those two restrictions on unions whose officials are disqualified under the criteria set forth in § 86. It does not, by its terms, provide a mechanism for disqualifying any union officer. Therefore, while it appears that the Court holds that a State is free to disqualify certain individuals from acting as union officials {{as long as it does}} not impose sanctions on the union itself, it <b>is</b> <b>not</b> <b>clear</b> that anything in § 93(b) enables the State to do that.|$|E

5|$|Olfactory {{navigation}} {{has been}} suggested as a possible mechanism in pigeons. Papi's 'mosaic' model argues that pigeons build and remember a mental map of the odours in their area, recognizing where they are by the local odour. Wallraff's 'gradient' model argues {{that there is a}} steady, large-scale gradient of odour which remains stable for long periods. If there were two or more such gradients in different directions, pigeons could locate themselves in two dimensions by the intensities of the odours. However it <b>is</b> <b>not</b> <b>clear</b> that such stable gradients exist. Papi did find evidence that anosmic pigeons (unable to detect odours) were much less able to orient and navigate than normal pigeons, so olfaction does seem to be important in pigeon navigation. However, it <b>is</b> <b>not</b> <b>clear</b> how olfactory cues are used.|$|E
