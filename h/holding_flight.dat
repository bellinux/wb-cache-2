40|$|An Integer Programming {{formulation}} {{is developed}} for optimizing surface operations at Dallas-Fort Worth airport, {{with the goal}} of assessing the potential benefits of taxi route planning. The model is based on operations in the eastern half of the airport under the most frequently used configuration. The focus is on operational concepts that optimize taxi routes by utilizing different control points on the airport surface. The benefits of two different concepts for optimizing taxiway operations, namely controlled pushback and taxi reroutes are analyzed, for both current data and a projected data set with approximately twice the traffic density. The analysis estimates that: (1) for current traffic densities, controlled pushback would reduce the average departure taxi time by 17 % without altering runway schedule conformance, while the benefits of taxi reroutes would be minimal; and (2) for high-density operations, controlled pushback would reduce the average departure taxi time by 18 %, while incorporating taxi reroutes would reduce the average arrival taxi time by 14 %. Other benefits analyzed for these control strategies include a decrease in the average time spent in runway crossing queues. Nomenclature F set of all flights.

40|$|We study {{strategic}} and operational measures of improving airline system performance and reducing delays for aircraft, crew and passengers. As a strategic approach, we study robust optimization models, which capture possible future operational uncertainties at the planning stage, {{in order to}} generate solutions that when implemented, {{are less likely to}} be disrupted, or incur lower costs of recovery when disrupted. We complement strategic measures with operational measures of managing delays and disruptions by integrating two areas of airline operations thus far separate - disruption management and flight planning. We study different classes of models to generate robust airline scheduling solutions. In particular, we study, two general classes of robust models: (i) extreme-value robust-optimization based and (ii) chance-constrained probability-based; and one tailored model, which uses domain knowledge to guide the solution process. We focus on the aircraft routing problem, a step of the airline scheduling process. We first show how the general models can be applied to the aircraft routing problem by incorporating domain knowledge. To overcome limitations of solution tractability and solution performance, we present budget-based extensions to the general model classes, called the Delta model and the Extended Chance-Constrained programming model. Our models enhance tractability by reducing the need to iterate and re-solve the models, and generate solutions that are consistently robust (compared to the basic models) according to our performance metrics. In addition, tailored approaches to robustness can be expressed as special cases of these generalizable models. The extended models, and insights gleaned, apply not only to the aircraft routing model but also to the broad class of large-scale, network-based, resource allocation. We show how our results generalize to resource allocation problems in other domains, by applying these models to pharmaceutical supply chain and corporate portfolio applications in collaboration with IBM's Zurich Research Laboratory. Through empirical studies, we show that the effectiveness of a robust approach for an application is dependent on the interaction between (i) the robust approach, (ii) the data instance and (iii) the decision-maker's and stakeholders' metrics. We characterize the effectiveness of the extreme-value models and probabilistic models based on the underlying data distributions and performance metrics. We also show how knowledge of the underlying data distributions can indicate ways of tailoring model parameters to generate more robust solutions according to the specified performance metrics. As an operational approach towards managing airline delays, we integrate flight planning with disruption management. We focus on two aspects of flight planning: (i) flight speed changes; and (ii) intentional flight departure holds, or delays, with the goal of optimizing the trade-off between fuel costs and passenger delay costs. We provide an overview of the state of the practice via dialogue with multiple airlines and show how greater flexibility in disruption management is possible through integration. We present models for aircraft and passenger recovery combined with flight planning, and models for approximate aircraft and passenger recovery combined with flight planning. Our computational experiments on data provided by a European airline show that decrease in passenger disruptions on the order of 47. 2 %- 53. 3 % can be obtained using our approaches. We also discuss the relative benefits of the two mechanisms studied - that of flight speed changes, and that of intentionally <b>holding</b> <b>flight</b> departures, and show significant synergies in applying these mechanisms. We also show that as more information about delays and disruptions in the system is captured in our models, further cost savings and reductions in passenger delays are obtained. by Lavanya Marla.

50|$|The {{flight was}} en route from Indianapolis International Airport, Indiana, to O'Hare International Airport, Chicago, Illinois. Bad weather in Chicago caused delays, {{prompting}} air traffic control to <b>hold</b> <b>Flight</b> 4184 over the nearby LUCIT intersection at 10000 ft. While holding, the plane encountered freezing rain, a dangerous icing condition where supercooled droplets rapidly cause intense ice buildup. Soon after, they were cleared to descend to 8000 ft. After this descent the pilots were ordered to enter another hold. During the descent, a warning sound indicating an overspeed warning due to the extended flaps was heard in the cockpit. After the pilot took action by retracting the flaps, a strange noise was heard on the cockpit voice recorder, followed by a sharp, uncommanded roll excursion that disengaged the autopilot. Flight recorder data showed that the aircraft subsequently went through at least one full roll, after which Aguiar and Gagliano regained control of the rapidly descending aircraft. However, another roll occurred shortly as they engaged the autopilot again. This second occurrence was unrecoverable, and fewer than thirty seconds later, at 3:59 p.m., contact with Flight 4184 was lost as the plane crashed nose-down into a soybean field near Roselawn, Indiana, killing all 64 passengers and 4 crew on board.|$|R
