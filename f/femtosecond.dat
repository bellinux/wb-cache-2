5|$|Recently, free {{electron}} lasers {{have been developed}} for use in X-ray crystallography. These are the brightest X-ray sources currently available; with the X-rays coming in <b>femtosecond</b> bursts. The intensity of the source is such that atomic resolution diffraction patterns can be resolved for crystals otherwise too small for collection. However, the intense light source also destroys the sample, requiring multiple crystals to be shot. As each crystal is randomly oriented in the beam, hundreds of thousands of individual diffraction images must be collected {{in order to get a}} complete data-set. This method, serial <b>femtosecond</b> crystallography, has been used in solving the structure of a number of protein crystal structures, sometimes noting differences with equivalent structures collected from synchrotron sources.|$|E

50|$|Mode-locked {{oscillators}} generate ultrashort pulses with {{a typical}} duration between a few picoseconds and 10 <b>femtoseconds,</b> in special cases even around 5 <b>femtoseconds.</b> The {{pulse repetition frequency}} is in most cases around 70 to 90 MHz. Ti:sapphire oscillators are normally pumped with a continuous-wave laser beam from an argon or frequency-doubled Nd:YVO4 laser. Typically, such an oscillator has an average output power of 0.4 to 2.5 watts.|$|R
50|$|In optics, various {{autocorrelation}} functions can be experimentally realized. The field autocorrelation {{may be used}} {{to calculate}} the spectrum of a source of light, while the intensity autocorrelation and the interferometric autocorrelation are commonly used to estimate the duration of ultrashort pulses produced by modelocked lasers. The laser pulse duration cannot be easily measured by optoelectronic methods, since the response time of photodiodes and oscilloscopes are at best of the order of 200 <b>femtoseconds,</b> yet laser pulses can be made as short as a few <b>femtoseconds.</b>|$|R

40|$|In {{our eyes}} light is absorbed by a polyene {{molecule}} called retinal. This molecule contains six double bonds and is bonded to a protein. The protein-chromophore complex is called rhodopsin {{and has been}} structurally determined by crystallography. It was early suggested that the main event in vision is a cis-trans isomerization of retinal. By using time resolved spectroscopy {{it has been shown}} that the initial excited state relaxation is completed in 200 <b>femtoseconds.</b> The excited state relaxation has been suggested to involve a downhill reaction path leading to an avoided crossing connecting the excited state and the ground state. At this avoided crossing one of the double bonds is twisted 90 degrees, i. e "half" of the cis-trans isomerization is complete. However, for retinal to reach such an avoided crossing large geometrical changes are required. This is unlikely to take place in 200 <b>femtoseconds</b> inside the tight protein cavity where retinal is located. The short time of 200 <b>femtoseconds</b> indicates that the nuclei of retinal or the nearby amino acids are not moved any significant distance. In the present thesis it has been found that a downhill reaction path exists also for a constrained motion consistent with crowded conditions. This reaction path was found by imposing a minimal motion of the nuclei and can be used during the short time of 200 <b>femtoseconds...</b>|$|R
50|$|Experimental {{study of}} any supramolecular {{structures}} in bulk water {{is difficult because}} of their short lifetime: the hydrogen bonds are continually breaking and reforming at the timescales faster than 200 <b>femtoseconds.</b>|$|R
25|$|OCT {{is based}} on low-coherence interferometry. In {{conventional}} interferometry with long coherence length (i.e., laser interferometry), interference of light occurs over a distance of meters. In OCT, this interference is shortened to a distance of micrometers, owing {{to the use of}} broad-bandwidth light sources (i.e., sources that emit light over a broad range of frequencies). Light with broad bandwidths can be generated by using superluminescent diodes or lasers with extremely short pulses (<b>femtosecond</b> lasers). White light {{is an example of a}} broadband source with lower power.|$|E
25|$|In chemistry, {{biochemistry}} {{and environmental}} sciences, deuterium {{is used as}} a non-radioactive, stable isotopic tracer, for example, in the doubly labeled water test. In chemical reactions and metabolic pathways, deuterium behaves somewhat similarly to ordinary hydrogen (with a few chemical differences, as noted). It can be distinguished from ordinary hydrogen most easily by its mass, using mass spectrometry or infrared spectrometry. Deuterium can be detected by <b>femtosecond</b> infrared spectroscopy, since the mass difference drastically affects the frequency of molecular vibrations; deuterium-carbon bond vibrations are found in spectral regions free of other signals.|$|E
25|$|Mechanisms of {{monitoring}} chemical reactions depend strongly on the reaction rate. Relatively slow processes {{can be analyzed}} in situ for the concentrations and identities of the individual ingredients. Important tools of real time analysis are the measurement of pH and analysis of optical absorption (color) and emission spectra. A less accessible but rather efficient method is introduction of a radioactive isotope into the reaction and monitoring how it changes over time and where it moves to; this method {{is often used to}} analyze redistribution of substances in the human body. Faster reactions are usually studied with ultrafast laser spectroscopy where utilization of <b>femtosecond</b> lasers allows short-lived transition states to be monitored at time scaled down to a few femtoseconds.|$|E

40|$|Using {{a highly}} stable {{spectral}} interferometry technique, ultrafast processes {{can be measured}} within a 2 ps temporal window. The technique {{was used to measure}} the nonlinear index of refraction due to the optical Kerr effect in water at both 815 nm and 407 nm with pump pulse lengths of ~ 90 <b>femtoseconds</b> and ~ 250 <b>femtoseconds</b> respectively. The 815 nm measurement serves as a benchmark against previous published values while the 407 nm measurement is entirely new.

25|$|A soft corneal suction ring {{is applied}} to the eye, holding the eye in place. This step in the {{procedure}} can sometimes cause small blood vessels to burst, resulting in bleeding or subconjunctival hemorrhage into the white (sclera) of the eye, a harmless side effect that resolves within several weeks. Increased suction causes a transient dimming of vision in the treated eye. Once the eye is immobilized, a flap is created by cutting through the corneal epithelium and Bowman's layer. This process is achieved with a mechanical microkeratome using a metal blade, or a <b>femtosecond</b> laser that creates a series of tiny closely arranged bubbles within the cornea. A hinge is left at one end of this flap. The flap is folded back, revealing the stroma, the middle section of the cornea. The process of lifting and folding back the flap can sometimes be uncomfortable.|$|E
25|$|Nonlinear {{two-dimensional}} {{infrared spectroscopy}} is the infrared version of correlation spectroscopy. Nonlinear two-dimensional infrared spectroscopy {{is a technique}} that has become available {{with the development of}} <b>femtosecond</b> infrared laser pulses. In this experiment, first a set of pump pulses is applied to the sample. This is followed by a waiting time during which the system is allowed to relax. The typical waiting time lasts from zero to several picoseconds, and the duration can be controlled with a resolution of tens of femtoseconds. A probe pulse is then applied, resulting in the emission of a signal from the sample. The nonlinear two-dimensional infrared spectrum is a two-dimensional correlation plot of the frequency ω1 that was excited by the initial pump pulses and the frequency ω3 excited by the probe pulse after the waiting time. This allows the observation of coupling between different vibrational modes; because of its extremely fine time resolution, {{it can be used to}} monitor molecular dynamics on a picosecond timescale. It is still a largely unexplored technique and is becoming increasingly popular for fundamental research.|$|E

2500|$|The {{dynamics}} {{is quite}} different for high energies, such as occur from an optical transition from a non-degenerate initial state with a high-symmetry (JT undistorted) equilibrium geometry into a JT distorted state.

Here the nonadiabatic couplings become very large and the behaviour of the system cannot be described within the familiar Born-Oppenheimer (BO) separation between the electronic and nuclear motions. The nuclear motion ceases to be confined to a single, well-defined APES and the transitions between the adiabatic surfaces occur yielding effects like Slonzcewsky resonances.
