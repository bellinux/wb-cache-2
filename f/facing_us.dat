25|$|My friend Clinch Smith {{made the}} {{proposition}} that we should leave and go toward the stern. But there arose before us from the decks below a mass of humanity several lines deep converging on the Boat Deck <b>facing</b> <b>us</b> and completely blocking our passage to the stern. There were women in the crowd {{as well as men}} and these seemed to be steerage passengers who had just come up from the decks below. Even among these people there was no hysterical cry, no evidence of panic. Oh the agony of it.|$|E
25|$|Intellipedia {{was created}} to share {{information}} {{on some of the}} most difficult subjects <b>facing</b> <b>U.S.</b> intelligence and to bring cutting-edge technology into its ever-more-youthful workforce. It also allows information to be assembled and reviewed by a wide variety of sources and agencies, to address concerns that pre-war intelligence did not include robust dissenting opinions on Iraq's alleged weapons programs. A number of projects are under way to explore the use of the Intellipedia for the creation of traditional Intelligence Community products. In the summer of 2006, Intellipedia was the main collaboration tool in constructing a National Intelligence Estimate on Nigeria.|$|E

2500|$|Many {{people do}} not oppose the IVF {{practice}} itself (i.e. the creating of a pregnancy through [...] "artificial" [...] ways) but are {{highly critical of the}} current state of the present day industry. Such individuals argue that the industry has now become a multibillion-dollar industry, which is widely unregulated and prone to serious abuses in the desire of practitioners to obtain profit. For instance, in 2008, a California physician transferred 12 embryos to a woman who gave birth to octuplets (see Suleman octuplets). This has made international news, and had led to accusations that many doctors are willing to seriously endanger the health and even life of women in order to gain money. Robert Winston, professor of fertility studies at Imperial College London, had called the industry [...] "corrupt" [...] and [...] "greedy" [...] saying that [...] "One of the major problems <b>facing</b> <b>us</b> in healthcare is that IVF has become a massive commercial industry," [...] and that [...] "What has happened, of course, is that money is corrupting this whole technology", and accused authorities of failing to protect couples from exploitation [...] "The regulatory authority has done a consistently bad job. It's not prevented the exploitation of women, it's not put out very good information to couples, it's not limited the number of unscientific treatments people have access to". The IVF industry can thus be seen as an example of what social scientists are describing as an increasing trend towards a market-driven construction of health, medicine and the human body.|$|E

60|$|Lounging {{about the}} grounds were some sixty or eighty handsomely-dressed natives, men and women; some {{reclining}} on the shady {{side of the}} houses, others under the trees, and a small group conversing close by the railing <b>facing</b> <b>us.</b>|$|E
60|$|We got rather {{near him}} this time, as he turned, <b>facing</b> <b>us,</b> and slowly swam in the {{direction}} of my bait. I could see the barracuda shining astern. Dan stopped the boat. I slowly let out line. The swordfish drifted back, and then sank.|$|E

6000|$|... "Bring him in," [...] said a low voice; {{and before}} the {{sergeant}} could prevent her, the speaker, snatching up the lantern, moved forward to meet the bearers. It was no sight for young eyes, and I saw Steel shudder; but there was wild Erse blood in the girl, and, holding one arm up, she stood erect, <b>facing</b> <b>us</b> again.|$|E
60|$|I {{turned on}} the goad-bearer behind me with a swift {{threatening}} gesture, and he started back. This and Cavor's sudden shout and leap clearly astonished all the Selenites.

She put down her wicked-looking head, and, with a fierce growl of contentment, buried her long white teeth in the throat of the dying animal.

60|$|At {{last the}} third day dawned; and <b>facing</b> <b>us</b> upon {{entering}} the plain, was a throne of red log-wood, canopied by the foliage of a red-dyed Pandannus.

60|$|In {{an hour or}} two the chap on watch {{began to}} yawn, then to nod. Pretty soon he {{stretched}} himself on the floor, <b>facing</b> <b>us,</b> pistol in hand. For a while he supported himself on his elbow, then laid his head on his arm, blinking like an owl. I performed an occasional snore, watching him narrowly between my eyelashes from the shadow of my arm. The inevitable occurred--he slept audibly.|$|E
60|$|When {{their breath}} was gone we heard Cowan shout {{that he had}} found a path under his feet,--a path that was on dry land in the summer-time. We {{followed}} it, feeling carefully, and at length, when we had suffered all that we could bear, we stumbled on to a dry ridge. Here we spent another night of torture, with a second backwater <b>facing</b> <b>us</b> coated with a full inch of ice.|$|E
6000|$|We got {{round the}} corner with one wheel three feet high upon the bank. I thought we were surely over, but after {{staggering}} {{for a moment she}} righted and darted onwards. That was the third corner and the last one. There was only the park gate now. It was <b>facing</b> <b>us,</b> but, as luck would have it, not <b>facing</b> <b>us</b> directly. It was about twenty yards to the left up the main road into which we ran. Perhaps I could have done it, but I expect that the steering-gear had been jarred when we ran on the bank. The wheel did not turn easily. We shot out of the lane. I saw the open gate on the left. I whirled round my wheel with all the strength of my wrists. Perkins and I threw our bodies across, and then the next instant, going at fifty miles an hour, my right front wheel struck full on the right-hand pillar of my own gate. I heard the crash. I was conscious of flying through the air, and then--and then--! ...|$|E
