5|$|A notable {{physical}} {{difference between}} these metals is their density, with zirconium having about one-half the density of hafnium. The most notable nuclear properties of hafnium are its high thermal neutron-capture cross-section and that the nuclei of several different hafnium isotopes readily absorb two or more neutrons apiece. In contrast with this, zirconium is practically transparent to thermal neutrons, and it <b>is</b> <b>commonly</b> <b>used</b> for the metal components of nuclear reactors – especially the cladding of their nuclear fuel rods.|$|E

It was the 12th most prescribed medicine in the United States in 2010. Alprazolam, like other benzodiazepines, binds to specific sites on the GABAA receptor. It possesses anxiolytic, sedative, hypnotic, skeletal muscle relaxant, anticonvulsant, amnestic, and antidepressant properties. Alprazolam is available for oral administration as compressed tablets (CT) and extended-release capsules (XR).|$|E

Just as with laryngoscope blades, there are also several types of available stylets, such as the Verathon Stylet, which is specifically designed to follow the 60° blade angle of the GlideScope video laryngoscope.|$|E
5|$|Another common process, {{explosion}} welding, {{involves the}} joining of materials by pushing them together under extremely high pressure. The {{energy from the}} impact plasticizes the materials, forming a weld, even though only {{a limited amount of}} heat is generated. The process <b>is</b> <b>commonly</b> <b>used</b> for welding dissimilar materials, such as the welding of aluminum with steel in ship hulls or compound plates. Other solid-state welding processes include friction welding (including friction stir welding), magnetic pulse welding, co-extrusion welding, cold welding, diffusion bonding, exothermic welding, high frequency welding, hot pressure welding, induction welding, and roll welding.|$|E
