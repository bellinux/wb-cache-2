40|$|AbstractThere is {{empirical}} evidence that project sphere {{has not been}} valued appropriately in many organizations because it seems certain that the company's projects are not unified and consequently spread across several other spheres. However, {{it is necessary to}} know how the concept of project and the project management concomitantly are made manifest in increasingly project-oriented organizations in order to achieve the organizational goals themselves. The recent study aims at a better understanding of when and why projects at a global marketplace either fail or success as well as what factors are influential. Therefore, a theoretical revision on this topic was performed. Although many studies have explored success/failure factors in projects, a few of them are comprised of the perception that to what extent project's success/failure factors are noteworthy and likewise what really are a successful project and/or a failure project.

Information on soybean varieties is received from mass media advertising, friends or relatives, seed dealers, University and extension variety trials, and perhaps from your own strip trials. New varieties from public and private organizations are abundant. Yields are increasing about one-third of a bushel per acre per year due to genetic improvement. While some new varieties show this response, other new varieties may not yield better than those now used. Given all this information and the new influx of varieties, how do you choose the best variety to grow?

40|$|Heparin {{has been}} used in the {{catheterization}} laboratory to prevent ischemic complications of percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI). Bivalirudin, a direct thrombin inhibitor, is an anticoagulant that has several pharmacologic advantages over heparin, and it has been proposed that bivalirudin is superior to heparin in its ability to prevent bleeding complications of PCI. As such, there have been a variety of large prospective clinical trials comparing bivalirudin and heparin over the past 13 years. The results of these trials have prompted the general acceptance of bivalirudin as a safe alternative to heparin use during PCI, and bivalirudin has been given a class 1 recommendation by the American College of Cardiology/American Heart Association (ACC/AHA) <b>guidelines</b> <b>for</b> a <b>variety</b> of clinical indications.

40|$|The key {{questions}} {{which will be}} addressed in this report are: • Which variety characteristics are important for organic farming and are they different from conventional farmers demand? • What is an “appropriate“ <b>variety</b> <b>for</b> organic farming? • Is the actual variety offer available to organic farmers satisfactory? Is it different per crops type and/or per geographic area? • How should variety trials be conducted in order to supply the information needed by organic operators? The main answers may be synthesized as follows: Characteristics of varieties {{to be used in}} organic farming are partly different from the ones requested in conventional farming. Main differences are related to yield stability, processing properties and root-system development; The definition of “appropriateness”, related to <b>variety</b> <b>for</b> organic farming, is not easy to state as it may involves different aspects, depending on perspective (producers, processor, trader etc.). A list of characters that should be considered within the “appropriateness” concept is presented in the report; Among involved Members States experts there is no common evaluation of the actual variety availability: in general if for cereals there is a reasonably good level of availability, for vegetables and fodder crops mixtures the situation is never very positive even if it varies greatly among Member States; Valuable <b>guidelines</b> <b>for</b> cereal <b>variety</b> testing in organic farming have been produced by the COST 860 action “SUSVAR” (Sustainable low-input cereal production: required variety characteristics and crop diversity) and they are summarized in the report; <b>Guidelines</b> <b>for</b> vegetable <b>variety</b> testing are difficult to identify as among vegetables species the characteristics and requirements are very different. In the report some indications are reported. Recommendation <b>for</b> <b>variety</b> evaluation and testing in organic farming Several recommendation result from the report. For clarity sake they have been grouped in 3 parts, depending on which institution they are aimed to: Recommendations to EU and international authorities: • To implement the possibility offered by EU directives on seed trading (EEC Dir. 66 / 4021; EEC Dir. 66 / 4012 and EC Dir. 2002 / 553) to run controls on seeds for organic farming additional to the routine controls. This possibility may be used to evaluate variety appropriateness to organic farming conditions and consequently orientate the choice of varieties that seed companies offer to the organic sector. • To consider specific variety traits requested by organic farming systems in the test <b>for</b> <b>variety</b> inclusion into the registers of varieties. Recommendations to Member States: • To keep record of the <b>variety</b> requested <b>for</b> derogation and make it public. It may be a useful instrument for seed producers’ orientation. • To include specific local (National/Regional) demands from organic farmers in the variety trials. It means to include varieties that are supposed as fit to organic conditions by farmers but also to include specific characteristics in the evaluation criteria. • To promote public breeding for organic farming and to support spin-off of seed companies dedicated to organic seed production. A low-cost option may be participatory breeding that combines the advantages of introducing <b>variety</b> traits asked <b>for</b> by organic producers and facilitate dissemination. Recommendations to other stakeholders: • To involve nurseries in the debate about organic variety choice as they result to be an important bottle-neck for the use of organic seeds in vegetable production. • To promote timely programming of variety used and amounts of seed needed among producers in order to facilitate seed producers and distributors {{but at the same time}} to grand producers the right variety choice...|$|R
40|$|Background: Widespread {{interest}} in the appropriate use of antibiotics {{has led to the}} publication of anti-infective <b>guidelines</b> <b>for</b> a <b>variety</b> of infectious diseases. Objective: To determine adherence to Ontario’s 1997 Anti-infective <b>Guidelines</b> <b>for</b> Community-Acquired Infections. Methods: This study was a prescriber-blinded, concurrent review of prescriptions over a 2 -month period at a university-affiliated family practice clinic. Patients who received antibiotic prescrip-tions for an infection specified in the guidelines were enrolled. The initial antibiotic regimen (agent, dose, frequency, and duration) was evaluated for adherence to the recommendations. Health records were reviewed over a subsequent 6 -week period to determine the occurrence of repeat contact with a health care provider, the outcome of the infection, and antibiotic-related complications. Results: Of the 144 initial regimens assessed, 135 (94 %) involved first-, second-, or third-line agents listed in the guidelines; 114 (79 %) involved first-line agents. One hundred and five (73 %) of the regimens were adherent to the guidelines in terms of agent, dose, frequency, and duration. Among the 98 patients with repeat contact with a health care provider, there was a higher incidence of antibiotic-related complications in association with nonadher-ent therapy (5 of 26 cases [19 %]) than with adherent therapy (2 of 72 cases [3 %]) (p = 0. 013). There were no differences in outcomes of the diagnosed infections. Conclusions: Adherence to recommendations for antibiotic therapy was high in this family practice clinic. A larger prospective study is necessary to confirm the lower rate of antibiotic-associated complications observed with adherent therapy.

40|$|Clinical {{guidelines}} are special types of plans realized by collective agents. We provide an ontological theory of such plans {{that is designed}} to support the construction of a framework in which guideline-based information systems can be employed in the management of workflow in health care organizations. The framework we propose allows us to represent in formal terms how clinical {{guidelines are}} realized through the actions of are realized through the actions of individuals organized into teams. We provide various levels of implementation representing different levels of conformity on the part of health care organizations. Implementations built in conformity with our framework are marked by two dimensions of flexibility that are designed to make them more likely to be accepted by health care professionals than standard guideline-based management systems. They do justice to the fact 1) that responsibilities within a health care organization are widely shared, and 2) that health care professionals may on different occasions be non-compliant with <b>guidelines</b> <b>for</b> a <b>variety</b> of well justified reasons. The advantage of the framework lies in its built-in flexibility, its sensitivity to clinical context, and its ability to use inference tools based on a robust ontology.

40|$|Abstract Background Population based {{studies show}} that {{guidelines}} are underused. Surveys of international guideline developers found that many do not implement their guidelines. The purpose {{of this research was}} to interview guideline developers about implementation approaches and resources. Methods Semi-structured telephone interviews were conducted with representatives of guideline development agencies identified in the National Guideline Clearinghouse and sampled by country, type of developer, and guideline clinical indication. Participants were asked to comment on the benefits and resource implications of three approaches <b>for</b> <b>guideline</b> implementation that varied by responsibility: developers, intermediaries, or users. Results Thirty individuals from seven countries were interviewed, representing government (n[*]=[*] 12) and professional (n[*]=[*] 18) organizations that produced <b>guidelines</b> <b>for</b> a <b>variety</b> of clinical indications. Organizations with an implementation mandate featured widely inconsistent funding and staffing models, variable approaches for choosing promotional strategies, and an array of dissemination activities. When asked to choose a preferred approach, most participants selected the option of including information within guidelines that would help users to implement them. Given variable mandate and resources for implementation, it was considered the most feasible approach, and therefore most likely to have impact due to potentially broad use. Conclusions While implementation approaches and strategies need not be standardized across organizations, the findings may be used by health care policy makers and managers, and guideline developers to generate strategic and operational plans that optimize implementation capacity. Further research is needed to examine how to optimize implementation capacity by guideline developers, intermediaries and users. </p...|$|R

40|$|The need {{to adhere}} to {{recommended}} physical activity <b>guidelines</b> <b>for</b> a <b>variety</b> of chronic disorders calls for high precision Human Activity Recognition (HAR) systems. In the SelfBACK system, HAR is used to monitor activity types and intensities to enable self-management of low back pain (LBP). HAR is typically modelled as a classification task where sensor data associated with activity labels are used to train a classifier to predict future occurrences of those activities. An important consideration in HAR is whether to use training data from a general population (subject-independent), or personalised training data from the target user (subject-dependent). Previous evaluations have shown that using personalised data results in more accurate predictions. However, from a practical perspective, collecting sufficient training data from the end user may not be feasible. This has made using subject-independent data by far the more common approach in commercial HAR systems. In this paper, we introduce a novel approach which uses nearest neighbour similarity to identify examples from a subject-independent training set that are most similar to sample data obtained from the target user and uses these examples to generate a personalised model for the user. This nearest neighbour sampling approach enables us to avoid much of the practical limitations associated with training a classifier exclusively with user data, while still achieving the benefit of personalisation. Evaluations show our approach to significantly out perform a general subject-independent model by up to 5 %. SELFBACK project; European Commission (# 689043) in the Horizon 2020 framework...|$|R
