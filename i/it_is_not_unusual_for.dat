5|$|The United States Military Academy (USMA) is an {{undergraduate}} college in West Point, New York {{with the mission}} of educating and commissioning officers for the United States Army. The list is drawn from non-graduate former cadets and cadet candidates. <b>It</b> <b>is</b> <b>not</b> <b>unusual</b> <b>for</b> the service academies to have high dropout rates. Of the original 103 cadets in the Class of 1826, only 43 graduated. Non-graduates of the Academy have entered a variety of fields. Notable non-graduates include Edgar Allan Poe (literature), James Abbott McNeill Whistler (art), Maynard James Keenan (music), Adam Vinatieri (football), and even the military: Jacob Zeilin, Lewis Addison Armistead, and Courtney Hodges.|$|E
5|$|Cats {{who live}} {{outside of the}} Clans are split into three groups. Housecats, known as 'kittypets', are often sneered at by the Clan cats for their cozy and lazy life. Occasionally a curious kittypet will wander into the forest to explore; at this point, they are chased away, but will rarely come to harm. As a result, kittypets often warn each other not to enter the forest. 'Loners' are cats who walk outside of the Clans, usually by themselves. Although {{regarded}} by the Clans with suspicion, they do not cause the forest cats any trouble, and so are free to wander outside of the borders in peace. Similar to loners are 'rogues', who differ only because they intentionally try to cause the Clans harm. <b>It</b> <b>is</b> <b>not</b> <b>unusual</b> <b>for</b> a rogue to be a former Clan cat looking for revenge. For a kittypet, loner or rogue to join a Clan is rare, but not unheard of. Often, these newcomers have to prove themselves {{in order to be}} regarded with trust {{by the rest of the}} community.|$|E

25|$|Washington and Lee's honor {{system does}} not have a list of rules that define {{punishable}} behavior—beyond the traditional guide of the offenses lying, cheating or stealing.

25|$|After {{the growth}} period, when the meristems are dormant, {{the leaves are}} sources, and storage organs are sinks. Developing seed-bearing organs (such as fruit) are always sinks.

25|$|<b>It</b> <b>is</b> <b>not</b> <b>unusual</b> <b>for</b> small {{sections}} of the parkway to be temporarily closed to repair damage caused by the cold winter climate of the mountains or for other maintenance. Detours caused by these closures are well-marked, and are arranged to cause as little disruption as possible, though maintenance such as repaving only warrants a stop/slow switch with a one-lane only restriction.|$|E
25|$|At {{any given}} year -should the Indios {{make it to the}} PRBL tournament playoffs- {{attendance}} to the team's baseball park and post-game celebrations tend to be particularly high because they usually coincide with the celebration of the patron saint feasts (fiestas patronales) for the city of Mayagüez; <b>it</b> <b>is</b> <b>not</b> <b>unusual</b> <b>for</b> a championship game to coincide with Candlemas (2 February) or Candlemas Eve.|$|E

25|$|Pronunciation of Swedish names is similar, {{but long}} vowels are not doubled and the stress {{may be on}} any syllable.

25|$|Acoustic 5-string violins are {{becoming}} more common, and <b>it</b> <b>is</b> <b>not</b> <b>unusual</b> <b>for</b> an electric violin to have 5, 6, 7 or more strings. The typical solid body also accommodates the extra tension caused by more strings without stressing the instrument too much. The extra strings are usually a low C string for 5-strings, a low C and low F for 6, and a low C, F and B for 7.|$|E
25|$|When {{the weather}} gets colder, {{and the water}} {{temperature}} drops below 15 C (60 F), smallmouth will often migrate in search of deeper pools in which they enter a semi-hybernation state, moving sluggishly and feeding very little until the warm season returns. The migration patterns of smallmouth have been tracked and <b>it</b> <b>is</b> <b>not</b> <b>unusual</b> <b>for</b> a smallmouth to travel 12 miles {{in a single day}} in a stream, creek or river.

25|$|Detective sergeants {{are equal}} in rank to their uniformed counterparts; only the prefix 'detective' {{identifies}} them as having completed {{at least one}} of the various detective training courses authorising them to conduct and/or manage investigations into serious and/or complex crime. In British police services, not all officers deployed in plain clothes are detectives, and not all detectives are deployed within the CID. Thus, <b>it</b> <b>is</b> <b>not</b> <b>unusual</b> <b>for</b> detectives to supervise uniformed officers and vice versa.|$|E
25|$|In captivity, {{they can}} be seen to be {{constantly}} playing, vocalizing, and swimming around each other. They show a great deal of curiosity towards humans and frequently approach the windows in the tanks to observe them. Belugas may also playfully spit at humans or other whales. <b>It</b> <b>is</b> <b>not</b> <b>unusual</b> <b>for</b> an aquarium handler to be drenched by one of his charges. Some researchers believe spitting originated with blowing sand away from crustaceans at the sea bottom.|$|E
25|$|Arachnids {{are mostly}} carnivorous, feeding on the pre-digested bodies of insects {{and other small}} animals. Only in the harvestmen and among mites, such as the house dust mite, is there {{ingestion}} of solid food particles, and thus exposure to internal parasites, although <b>it</b> <b>is</b> <b>not</b> <b>unusual</b> <b>for</b> spiders to eat their own silk. Several groups secrete venom from specialized glands to kill prey or enemies. Several mites and ticks are parasites, {{some of which are}} carriers of disease.|$|E

25|$|As of 2008, exhuming and {{identifying}} the bodies in almost 60 identified but unopened mass burial sites remains a problem.

25|$|<b>It</b> <b>is</b> <b>not</b> <b>unusual</b> <b>for</b> {{some animals}} {{to play with}} toys. An {{example of this is}} a dolphin being trained to nudge a ball through a hoop. Young {{chimpanzees}} use sticks as dolls – the social aspect is seen by the fact that young females more often use a stick this way than young male chimpanzees. They carry their chosen stick and put it in their nest. Such behaviour is also seen in some adult female chimpanzees, but never after they have become mothers.|$|E
25|$|The {{islands are}} famous among birdwatchers {{for their ability}} to attract rare birds from all corners of the globe. The peak time of year for this is {{generally}} in October when <b>it</b> <b>is</b> <b>not</b> <b>unusual</b> <b>for</b> several of the rarest birds in Europe to share this archipelago. One reason for the success of these islands in producing rarities is the extensive coverage these islands get from birdwatchers, but archipelagos are often favoured by rare birds which like to make landfall and eat there before continuing their journeys and often arrive on far flung islands first.|$|E
