40|$|Rivets {{were the}} primary {{fastener}} used to fabricate the connections of steel structures until the mid-twentieth century through a technique called <b>hot</b> <b>riveting.</b> Nowadays, engineers, architects and historic preservationists often lack information on the structural behaviour of steel riveted connections. Given {{the high number of}} parameters induced by <b>hot</b> <b>riveting,</b> the understanding and assessment of the behaviour of steel riveted connections is challenging. Therefore, we reviewed and compared historical test data with the results of experiments we performed. We tested in tension rivets machined from steel connections we fabricated. This paper addresses the impact of the hot-driving process on the strength and ductility of steel rivets. Experimental results corroborate historical test data. Rivet driving increases the tensile strength of steel rivets markedly. However, it reduces their ductility substantially. Consequently, the hot-driving process improves the shear strength of steel riveted connections. Present standards could be refined to account for the impact of the hot-driving process...|$|E
40|$|The {{assessment}} of the structural resistance of historical metal structures involves a depth understanding of many factors, such as {{the properties of the}} constructions materials and the structural behaviour of the connection mode. Available information regarding the behaviour of historical riveted connections is quite limited and more information about the residual strain and stress state is still needed in order to allow the preservation of these existing structures. This paper deals with the {{assessment of}} stress and strain eld which exist around the rivet hole due to the <b>hot</b> <b>riveting</b> process. Experimental specimens were manufactured with riveting technique used in aged metal bridges and different metallic materials for the joined plates were considered. Strain and thermal measurements were done during and after the overall riveting process. The results of the experimental investigation allowed the {{assessment of the}} residual strain state and the thermal response of the riveted joint. The experimental results were then used for validation of a 2 D axisymmetric model. On the basis of the results obtained, the pre-stress state can be evaluated as well as the stress concentration areas where fatigue cracks may initiate. Thus, the provide ndings constitute a supportive tool for further studies regarding the assessment and rehabilita- tion of historical riveted structures...|$|E
40|$|AbstractBeing {{the second}} oldest railway network in Europe, {{almost half of}} the {{metallic}} railway bridges in France were built before the 1900 s. At the time, puddled iron was the building material of preference amongst most engineers, <b>hot</b> <b>riveting</b> was the preferred joining method. Considering the ageing of these constructions, as well as the increasing evolution of traffic in the network, the understanding of the behaviour of this type of structures to cyclic loadings is of utmost importance. However, high cycle fatigue characterization is an expensive and time consuming process. The use of a fast characterization method through the measure of self-heating of the specimens during cycling loadings is proposed and analysed. For homogeneous materials, like modern steel, the use of self-heating measurements to estimate fatigue-life related properties has shown good correlation to results obtained by the standard fatigue tests with the advantage of a lower time of characterization. In our case, non-metallic inclusions present in the puddled iron will have an important influence in the response of the material, and therefore the interpretation of the temperature's evolution needs a different approach. Due to its complexity, the integrity of the structure must be analysed from a multi-scaled point of view. For this study, we focused in the quantification of the influence that the population of non-metallic inclusions have on the mechanic and thermal behaviour of a puddled iron. For this purpose, a set of specimens previously tested by the self-heating method were prepared and observed using two different tools: a classic optical microscope and a scanning electron microscope. The relationship between geometric parameters of the inclusions found in the specimens and their temperature response to cyclic loadings was shown. The hypothesis of the presence of micro plasticity (dissipative phenomenon) near inclusions was also validated through SEM observations...|$|E

50|$|Such riveted {{structures}} may be {{insufficient to}} resist seismic loading from earthquakes if the structure was not engineered for such forces, {{a common problem}} of older steel bridges.

40|$|International audienceHot {{riveting}} {{was largely}} used as method of assembly in France during the appearing {{and expansion of}} the railway network (1840 - 1940). Present in wrought iron and steel constructions, riveted connections are commonly found in the French railway heritage. Conceived as a permanent assembly, these connections work by the shearing of the rivets and the friction between the plates, such friction {{is caused by the}} clamping force due to the cooling of the rivet after forging. The mechanical behavior of the assembly will depend on the many parameters involved in the process. However, three main failure modes have been identified: tension on the plates, shearing of the rivet and bearing in the plates (pressure of rivet on the rivet hole). To understand the influence of friction in the global behavior of the assembly, a comparison between two types of S 235 steel specimens is proposed. The first was a set of several <b>hot</b> <b>riveted</b> specimens and in the second one, the rivet was replaced by a martensitic stainless steel axis with a high yield stress that kept the pieces of the connection in place (no clamping force was thus present this time). The behavior of both types of specimens was then studied in tension using 3 D Digital Image Correlation to analyze local and global displacements. The comparison between the relative displacements of the connected plates of the two types of specimens allows identifying the influence of friction in the global behavior. To complete this kinematics investigation, failure scenarios are described through longitudinal cross sections analysis...|$|R

50|$|Many {{standard}} magnesium alloys {{are easily}} welded by gas or resistance-welding equipment, but cannot be cut with an oxygen torch. Magnesium alloys are not welded to other metals, because brittle inter-metallic compounds may form, {{or because the}} combination of metals may promote corrosion. Where two or more parts are welded together, their compositions must be the same. Soldering of magnesium alloys is feasible only for plugging surface defects in parts. The solders are even more corrosive than with aluminium, and the parts should never be required to withstand stress. Riveted joints in magnesium alloy structures usually employ aluminium or aluminium-magnesium alloy rivets. Magnesium rivets are not often used because they must be driven when <b>hot.</b> The <b>rivet</b> holes should be drilled, especially in heavy sheet and extruded sections, since punching tends to give a rough edge to the hole and to cause stress concentrations.|$|R
40|$|This thesis {{focuses on}} fatigue problem on riveted {{structures}} and the correlated experimental tests. The term “fatigue” denotes the cracking of metals under repeated loading. The technique of riveting structures is obsolete {{due to the}} low level of standardization in the construction process. Knowledge concerning riveted structure’s ability to withstand fatigue has not been investigated to the same extent as for modern structures assembled by welding. Nevertheless, many riveted structures are still in service after over 100 years. Clamping force originates when the <b>hot</b> <b>rivet</b> is placed into the hole of the plates and the rivet shorten in length due to cooling. In Europe, a large number of railway bridges are riveted. Moreover, all over the world, the rivet assembly technique has been largely used for different types of buildings. The riveted structures are subjected, evidently, to fatigue degradation as all the other steel structures. The riveted joint complexity and the non-uniform realization lead to a structure-specific consideration. In Europe, current regulations recognise only one fatigue class for riveted structures neglecting the clamping force effect. This approach is characterized by an elevated standard deviation for the assessed results. This research aims to improve the riveted structures fatigue comprehension and to propose appropriate tests. Some elements have been extracted from a dismantled railway bridge located near San Stino di Livenza (Venice). An innovative clamping test (TCT) has been conceived: applying a torsional moment to the rivets and evaluating the sliding friction, the clamping force has been estimated. Contrary to traditional clamping tests, this setup, at an affordable price, provides good precision. Moreover, the test is in-site and does not provoke damages to the examined structure. Fem models of rail bearer have been realized taking into account rivets, holes and multilayer plates section inertia. A specific laboratory set up has been designed with the intention to calibrate the fem models. Frictions and clamping force have been taken into account in the rail bearer models. There is a close correspondence between the non-linear models and the experimental tests. The clamping assumptions, derived from the TCT, have been verified. A full scale fatigue test has been prepared and the first cycles have been monitored. Full scale fatigue tests are sophisticated and involve many parameters. For this test, a specific metallic frame has been designed and realized using advanced fatigue models. An advanced analysis (hot spot method) has been carried out, for the frame, in order to evaluate the stress into the welds. This frame will be used by the DICEA laboratory to test, principally, specimens extracted from bridges...|$|R
