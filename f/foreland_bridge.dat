50|$|This bridge {{opened in}} 1979 and {{eliminated}} {{a considerable amount}} of transit traffic south of Düsseldorf and the South Bridge (B 1), both then the only southern access from the left bank of the Rhine to Düsseldorf. Also, it connected the A 46 with the A 57. The Flehe Bridge has in each direction three vehicle lanes and a hard shoulder. The bridge does not cross the Rhine in a right angle, in order to preserve the area of water procurement of the old water company Flehe. A remarkable feature of the Flehe bridge is the reinforced concrete suspension tower, which looks like a Ypsilon turned on its head. In the handles of the pylons an elevator and stairs are accommodated above the roadway. The handles are in bridge longitudinal direction only 6.4 m broad. They were manufactured with a climbing formwork. The 13-feldrige <b>foreland</b> <b>bridge</b> is a prestressed concrete construction work with a construction height of 3.80 m and a total span of 13 x 60 m = 780 m. thereby exists covers on a length of nine fields from two single-cell hollow boxes with ever 7.0 m broad base plate. The remaining four fields within the range of the bridge removing possess against it a five-cellular box cross-section with base plate width of 29.5 m. A structural steelwork has the 368 m river opening stretching far as if cover.|$|E

The interval (constant at any one place) may vary from 6 mins. (Harwich) to II hrs. ~5 mins. (North <b>Foreland).</b> At London <b>Bridge</b> it is Ihr. 58 mins.|$|R
6000|$|English {{history was}} {{virtually}} American history; and {{everything on the}} land, as {{we made our way}} towards town, which the pilot could point out, was a source of amusement and delight. We had to tide it up to London, and had plenty of leisure to see all there was to be seen. The Thames is neither a handsome, nor a very magnificent river; but it was amazing to witness the number of vessels that then ascended or descended it. There was scarce a sort of craft known to Christendom, a few of the Mediterranean excepted, that was not to be seen there; and as for the colliers, we drifted through a forest of them that seemed large enough to keep the town a twelvemonth in fire-wood, by simply burning their spars. The manner in which the pilot handled our brig, too, among the thousand ships that lay in tiers {{on each side of the}} narrow passage we had to thread, was perfectly surprising to me; resembling the management of a coachman in a crowded thoroughfare, more than the ordinary working of a ship. I can safely say I learned more in the Thames, in the way of keeping a vessel in command, and in doing what I pleased with her, than in the whole of my voyage to Canton and back again. As for Neb, he rolled his dark eyes about in wonder, and took an occasion to say to me--"He'll make her talk, Masser Miles, afore he have done." [...] I make no doubt the navigation from the <b>Forelands</b> to the <b>bridges,</b> as it was conducted thirty years since, had a great influence on the seamanship of the English. Steamers are doing away with much of this practice, though the colliers still have to rely on themselves. Coals will scarcely pay for tugging.|$|R
