Initially, Jones approached {{the owner of}} a motel called the Sierra Palona Motel and requested that it be used in the episode. A deal was made that stated that the production staff could cut a hole in the roof for the episode in exchange for a brand-new roof after the episode was filmed. Duke Tomasick, The X-Files construction coordinator, later said that the [...] "fun part" [...] was [...] "calling local roofers and explaining <b>just</b> <b>what</b> <b>kind</b> <b>of</b> damage they'd be repairing for us".|$|E

2500|$|In a {{negative}} review, Flickering Myth critiqued that [...] "Some stories just don’t need telling, and Leatherface {{is one of}} them. It's not that it retcons elements of the Texas Chainsaw Massacre mythology, or that it's a 'pointless prequel' – it's just an empty movie. You'll have forgotten you've seen {{it as soon as}} the credits roll. Prequels, sequels and remakes can all enrich a story and tell it from a new perspective, but Leatherface just doesn’t do that."Screen International called the film [...] "a production line effort with an eye on cashflow rather than the demented work of art Hooper loosed on the world", stating [...] "this eighth entry is above average for its attenuated series. Gore levels are as high as expected and, naturally, the finale leaves things open for further installments." [...] Regarding the film's viewer appeal, HeyUGuys theorised, [...] "Not only is this prequel attempting to deliver something fans of the series don't necessarily want, it doesn't really do what it promises particularly well either. One for completists for sure, but on the whole Leatherface is too detached for TCM fans, and too extreme for the wider public." [...] William Bibbiani of IGN ranked it as the worst Texas Chainsaw Massacre film because [...] "it adds nothing new or interesting to the series. The problem is not just that this film is a prequel, so we know exactly where it’s going, but that the road to the inevitable takes us through almost unbearably familiar territory. It honestly looks as though the filmmakers who made Leatherface didn't watch the original films, but watched all of the films that ripped off The Texas Chain Saw Massacre instead." [...] Film critic Rob Gonsalves reviewed that [...] "Hooper's Chainsaw is often imitated, never duplicated (or bested, say I), a sui generis sweatbox odyssey that seems to owe nothing to any other film before it. Leatherface feels properly respectful, made by filmmakers who idolize the original, and that’s also its weakness: it's a jumped-up fan film, and because it's meant to be a prequel to Hooper's movie it's locked into whatever happens in that movie. It can't deviate from what we know, and can't truly surprise us." [...] Heather Wixson of Daily Dead went into Leatherface [...] "primed to love it", but felt that the final product [...] "never quite makes up its mind about <b>just</b> <b>what</b> <b>kind</b> <b>of</b> movie it wants to be, and suffers for its indecision. But as a whole, Leatherface is such a disappointing entry because it spends so much time trying to be so many other things than just a straight-up Texas Chainsaw movie, and I couldn't help but wonder why." [...] Wixson commended the cinematography, practical effects, and Lili Taylor's acting, but slammed the third act.|$|E

Put simply, we wanted to know <b>just</b> <b>what</b> <b>kinds</b> <b>of</b> mathematical knowledge modern workplaces require, and to address this knowledge gap through co-designing with employers and employees, modeling activities that made visible and manipulable, the underlying mathematics of the artifacts that characterized the workplaces.

First, many people believed that the 2 ̆ 2 faculty development movement 2 ̆ 2 was a casualty of tight budgets and an inevitable loss of faith in yesterday 2 ̆ 7 s strategies; some of us had our doubts.

40|$|Scientists {{believe that}} a serious change in the climate of the earth could occur {{in the course of}} the next two to five decades as a result of warming caused by the rapid {{accumulation}} of radiatively active trace gases in the atmosphere. There is concern that not only the amount of warming but the rate at which it occurs could be unprecedented, at least since the current interglacial period began. Scientific uncertainties remain in our understanding of the climatic changes that may follow from greenhouse warming. Nevertheless, large and rapid changes in regional climate are conceivable. General circulation models (GCMs) predict changes for the central U. S. as large as an 8 {degrees}C increase in mean summertime temperature accompanied by a 1 mm/day decrease in mean precipitation. Most predictions are less extreme but, so long as the direction of change is credible, efforts are warranted to identify <b>just</b> <b>what</b> <b>kinds</b> <b>of</b> impacts to expect if society chooses to allow climate to change or cannot stop it from changing, and <b>just</b> <b>what</b> might be done to adjust to those impacts...|$|R

40|$|Proposals for {{practical}} institutional reforms are notoriously absent from discussions about deliberative democracy. It {{is imperative to}} engage in the “nuts and bolts” debate <b>of</b> <b>just</b> <b>what</b> <b>kinds</b> <b>of</b> changes we discourse theorists or deliberative democrats want to effect. Here I would like to try to synthesize a reform proposal of my own based upon three major assumptions. Without argument, I assume a largely discourse-theoretic view of democracy that takes for granted the republican virtue of collective self-government as well as the Kantian claim that each citizen should be the author of his own laws. I further assume that our constitutional democracy attempts to approximate this virtue for its citizenry by aggregating preferences and sanctioning some rule by majority, all while checking people 2 ̆ 7 s preferences by enforcing some basic norms of equality. The last major assumption I make is that face-to-face interaction more closely embodies some democratic ideals than certain forms of representative bodies or virtual/electronic communication. I want to focus upon the dynamics of how better to approximate our approximation of democracy, not upon the teleological arguments for where we should end up in some utopian world or ranting about why we should end up there. I want to find a tweak, a tinkering, for our current system that would make it more generally desirable, making the three assumptions above with respect to what counts as desirable...|$|R

30|$|From {{the point}} of view of the Futures Map frame, the {{criteria}} of the preferred futures suggested by Amara [2] are useful when the customers of the Futures Map use the map. But like the geographic map, the Futures Map approach separates the Futures Map and its use. The Futures Map does not make any recommendations to its customers. It <b>just</b> shows <b>what</b> <b>kinds</b> <b>of</b> situations of choice they would meet if they would follow any scenario path of the Futures Map. It takes the preferences of its customers into account just in the selection of those scenario paths that it includes to the Futures Map. Surely, the preferences of the mapper and the customers of the Futures Map define these choices. The preferences of the customers are especially important if the focus of the Futures Map is on the external validity criteria 2, 4 or 6. If it has no specified customers (criterion 5) or if the target is to describe various possible (criterion 1) or weak signals based scenarios (criterion 3), the values and preferences of any particular user are not so important.|$|R

Besides, she must be intellectual, and fond of books, and appreciate art, and all that. Moreover, he had said he would like her to be just about a year older than himself, because he thought that was a good proportion in a young couple.

This is in contrast to the observation that choosing the parameters of discriminators not only relies on the a priori knowledge of discriminated states, but also depends on a priori probabilities of preparing the states.
