500|$|The {{idea for}} the subplot of Homer's {{parenting}} originated from a real fatherhood test executive producer Sam Simon found and brought to the Simpsons studio. Levine later commented on writing the episode, [...] "At the time David and I were writing this, my son, Matt, was about Bart's age. [...] So for me {{there was a certain}} amount of guilt associated, like 'Do <b>I</b> <b>know</b> <b>my</b> son's hobby? Do <b>I</b> <b>know</b> <b>my</b> son's best friend?' etc." [...] The scene in which Bart welds on his racer resulted in an argument between the staff of the show and the Fox network's censors. The censors were concerned that children would imitate Bart by misusing welding tools; however, the staff was able to convince them that very few children have access to welding tools.|$|E
500|$|... "Rain" [...] {{is notable}} for Ringo Starr's drumming, which Starr rates as his best {{recorded}} performance. Critics agreed: both Ian MacDonald and Rolling Stone described his drumming {{on the track}} as [...] "superb", while Richie Unterberger of AllMusic praised his [...] "creative drum breaks". In 1984, Starr said: [...] "I think it's {{the best out of}} all the records I've ever made. 'Rain' blows me away … I know me and <b>I</b> <b>know</b> <b>my</b> playing … and then there's 'Rain'." ...|$|E
500|$|Anne became queen {{upon the}} death of William III on 8 March 1702, and was {{immediately}} popular. In her first speech to the English Parliament, on 11 March, she distanced herself from her late Dutch brother-in-law and said, [...] "As <b>I</b> <b>know</b> <b>my</b> heart to be entirely English, I can very sincerely assure you there is not anything you can expect or desire from me which I shall not be ready {{to do for the}} happiness and prosperity of England." ...|$|E

500|$|Starved {{generated}} controversy {{even before}} its premiere. A number of {{specialists in the}} treatment of eating disorders expressed concern that the program would either make light of or glamorize eating disorders. Others, however, felt that Starved might focus attention on eating disorders as a serious medical condition. The National Eating Disorders Association called for a boycott of the show and claimed that Diageo (makers of Tanqueray) and Nautilus agreed to pull their advertising. Schaeffer responded to the controversy, saying [...] "there is some difficult stuff to watch. But <b>I</b> <b>know</b> <b>my</b> spirit and intention are good." ...|$|E
500|$|Dreyer {{had always}} {{stated that the}} band's second album would feature [...] "a lot of storytelling", [...] "a lot of groove", and [...] "a more of an organic feel" [...] than their debut album. When {{describing}} {{the sound of the}} album the band wrote that they believe it is [...] "musically more heavy and more soft, more fast and more slow, more complicated and more straight-forward, and <b>I</b> <b>know</b> <b>my</b> band mates would agree, so there isn't really a thing this record sounds like, at least not that we can hear." [...] With writer Vladimir Nabokov's works Pale Fire and Lolita being considered as the [...] "biggest external influence" [...] on Wildlife, the album features dark lyrical themes that focus on personal loss and the anger and despair felt from watching one's hometown decay, as well as dealing with personal loss, whether it is faith, a friend, or a family member.|$|E
500|$|Although {{he was a}} striker, Dickov {{was better}} known for his {{tenacity}} than his goal-scoring exploits. In a 2003 interview with the Independent on Sunday he provided a summary of his playing style: [...] "The ability to battle {{is one of the}} main parts of my game. <b>I</b> <b>know</b> <b>my</b> limits. I am not the sort who gets the ball and is then going to beat five or six players and stick it in the top corner from God knows where. But, whether I'm playing well or not, the one thing you will get from me is 110 per cent, upsetting defenders and basically giving them pain." [...] Rio Ferdinand was mentioning his name as the biggest headache to deal with on the pitch. His combative approach resulted in Manchester City manager Joe Royle naming him [...] "The Wasp", and during his time at Leicester he was known as [...] "The Pest".|$|E

500|$|Both my divisional {{generals and}} brigadiers have {{represented}} {{to me that}} they fear their men are thoroughly demoralised by shrapnel fire to which they have been subjected all day after exhaustion and gallant work in morning. Numbers have dribbled back from the firing line and cannot be collected in this difficult country. Even New Zealand Brigade which has only recently been engaged lost heavily and is to some extent demoralised. If troops are subjected to shellfire again tomorrow morning there {{is likely to be a}} fiasco, as I have no fresh troops with which to replace those in firing line. <b>I</b> <b>know</b> <b>my</b> representation is most serious, but if we are to re-embark it must be at once. Hamilton conferred with his naval commanders, who convinced him an evacuation would be almost impossible, and responded; [...] "dig yourselves right in and stick it out... dig, dig, dig until you are safe". The survivors had to fight on alone until 28 April when four battalions of the Royal Naval Division were attached to the corps.|$|E
500|$|On {{the morning}} of 15 November, Pedro II was in Petrópolis when he {{received}} the first telegram from Ouro Preto informing him of the rebellion. However, he did not assign much import to the news. At 11a.m. as he left a mass {{in honor of the}} 45th anniversary of his sister Maria II's death, the monarch received a second telegram and decided to return to Rio de Janeiro. His wife expressed concern, but he told her, [...] "On what ma'am? When I arrive there it will be over!" [...] He travelled by train, reading periodicals and scientific magazines. Not imagining the gravity of the situation, he arrived at the city palace at 3p.m. André Rebouças suggested that he go to the countryside to organize resistance. The Marquis of Tamandaré asked for his permission to lead the Armada (navy) and suppress the rebellion. He dismissed all the ideas put forward and said, [...] "This is nothing. <b>I</b> <b>know</b> <b>my</b> countrymen." [...] The Emperor asked the Conservative senator Manuel Francisco Correia what he thought of the situation. Correia answered that he believed that {{it was the end of}} the monarchy. Pedro II showed no emotion, as if unconcerned about the possibility.|$|E

She's still a cancer patient, but she knows that her job is on the line just like {{everyone}} else's. Everyone is working round the clock, showing up at every call, and the Chief is acting like a maniacal overlord." [...] Krill also enjoyed Oh's performance as Yang, writing: [...] "Cristina dealing with children is almost laughable – and actually provides a chuckle or two in this tense episode. Miss C thinks she is striking gold by moving to peds, because she {{will be able to do}} all types of surgery, and on little people, which makes the surgery harder, which is of course, better. Things don't turn out as planned, though, when she realizes kids are a little more resilient than their adult counterparts. And then Callie outs her to Arizona – in the she doesn’t really like kids sense of outing." [...] Krill enjoyed Wilson's performance as Bailey, in addition to Dane's, writing: [...] "He wins the best line of the show with 'That’s how <b>I</b> <b>know</b> <b>my</b> job is safe, Yang – I reattach babies arms.'" ...|$|E

[...] Zach Boren said, [...] "Everyone in the whole family is an Ohio State fan now[...] [...]No one cares about Michigan at all anymore. That {{was in the past}} and we're all looking forward to being Buckeyes and staying Buckeyes {{for the rest of our}} lives." [...] During spring practice, Boren impressed his coaches and teammates; however, he refused all interview requests. [...] During the summer, when asked about the impending Michigan – Ohio State game he said [...] "My attitude is there are 11 games before that game,[...] [...]I can't let myself get worked up thinking about that game. I don't want to take a chance of being unprepared for any of the first 11 games. The week that game gets here, it will be my primary focus."

Ayana broke open the race at the 4000 metres mark, running her next 1000 metres in 2:49.18. Dibaba had been training for this race for only two months, explaining after the race, “If I had followed ... I wouldn't have won a medal. <b>I</b> <b>know</b> <b>my</b> capacity these days because my training for this race was very short." [...] This was the third consecutive 10,000 metres race that Ayana had defeated Dibaba. Dibaba's 1000 metre splits were as follows: ...|$|E

2500|$|In 2000 {{he worked}} on his next album, Bad Shapes (21 May 2001). Walker was joined in the studio by Freer on {{saxophone}} and accordion; Loucataris on lead vocals, drums and percussion; Nix on double bass; White on clarinet, broken piano and percussion; and Gemma Clare on cello; Kazuaki Nakahara on banjo, electric and classical guitars; Elmo Reed on lead vocals and electric guitar; and Melissa Owl. It was issued on Spunk! Records and achieved critical acclaim and [...] "got everyone paying attention". Walker described collaborating with Freer, Loucataris, and Nix: [...] "We've {{known each other for}} at least 10 years ...

2500|$|Speaking of the album's {{production}} and style, Harrell stated that {{artists such as}} Rihanna have been talking a stance and stepping away from the popular music {{of the time and}} the expectations of her label, directors and radio, stating, [...] "I don't want to make what everybody else is making. I want to make what I want to make. <b>I</b> <b>know</b> <b>my</b> fans will love it because my fans are loyal to me, but if everybody else loves it, great.

2500|$|Some {{measures}} {{have been taken to}} try give less affluent families the ability to educate their children. President Ronald Reagan introduced the McKinney–Vento Homeless Assistance Act on July 22, 1987. This Act was meant to allow children the ability to succeed if their families did not have a permanent residence. Leo Stagman, a single, African-American parent, located in Berkeley, California, whose daughter had received a great deal of aid from the Act wrote on October 20, 2012 that, [...] "During her education, she [...] was eligible for the free lunch program and received assistance under the McKinney-Vento Homeless Assistance Educational Act. <b>I</b> <b>know</b> <b>my</b> daughter's performance is hers, but I wonder where she would have been without the assistance she received under the McKinney-Vento Act.

His father is an African American former soldier for the U.S. Army, and his mother is a white German {{who worked as a}} postal worker for the United States Postal Service. Cole's father later abandoned the family during his youth, prompting his mother to relocate Cole and his brother, Zach Cole to Fayetteville, North Carolina. Cole grew up in a multi-ethnic environment, and when asked about how closely his ethnicity impacts him, Cole commented, [...] "I can identify with white people, because <b>I</b> <b>know</b> <b>my</b> mother, her side of the family, who I love. But {{at the end of the}} day, [...] never felt white. I can identify [...] but never have I felt like I'm one of them.

During his youth, Cole expressed an affinity for basketball and music, and served as a first-chair violinist for the Terry Sanford Orchestra until 2003.|$|E
2500|$|Not only {{is there}} the issue of inner purpose and drive of the {{communal}} life of a nation, {{but also of the}} ethics of nationalism, relations between nations. Dubnow writes: [...] "There is absolutely no doubt that Jewish nationalism in its very essence has nothing in common with any tendency toward violence." [...] Because of the diaspora experience, [...] "as a Jew, I utter the word 'national' with pride and conviction, because <b>I</b> <b>know</b> <b>my</b> people... is not able to aspire anywhere to primacy and dominance. My nationalism can be only a pure form...." [...] The prophets [...] "called Israel a 'light to the nations' [...] the spiritual mission of the people of Israel... to bring other peoples, that is, all 'mankind,' to spiritual perfection." [...] Thus, the nation inspired by Judaism, [...] "the descendants of the Prophets," [...] will promote and inspire the social ethics of humanity, and will come to harmonize with its realization: [...] "the equal worth of all nations in the family of mankind." [...] The [...] "Jewish national idea, which can never become aggressive and warlike" [...] will raise aloft its flag, which symbolizes the joining of the prophetic vision of [...] "truth and justice with the noble dream of the unity of mankind." ...|$|E
