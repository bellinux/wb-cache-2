40|$|A simple {{theoretical}} {{model of the}} <b>deep</b> <b>stratification</b> and meridional overturning circulation in an idealized single-basin ocean with a circumpolar channel is presented. The theory includes the effects of wind, eddies, and diapycnal mixing; predicts the <b>deep</b> <b>stratification</b> {{in terms of the}} surface forcing and other problem parameters; makes no assumption of zero residual circulation; and consistently accounts for the interaction between the circumpolar channel {{and the rest of the}} ocean. The theory shows that dynamics of the overturning circulation can be characterized by two limiting regimes, corresponding to weak and strong diapycnal mixing. The transition between the two regimes is described by a nondimensional number characterizing the strength of the diffusion-driven compared to the wind-driven overturning circulation. In the limit of weak diapycnal mixing, <b>deep</b> <b>stratification</b> throughout the ocean is produced by the effects of wind and eddies in a circumpolar channel and maintained even in the limit of vanishing diapycnal diffusivity and in a flat-bottomed ocean. The overturning circulation across the <b>deep</b> <b>stratification</b> is driven by the diapycnal mixing in the basin away from the channel but is sensitive, through changes in stratification, to the wind and eddies in the channel. In the limit of strong diapycnal mixing, <b>deep</b> <b>stratification</b> is primarily set by eddies in the channel and diapycnal mixing in the basin away from the channel, with the wind over the circumpolar channel playing a secondary role. Analytical solutions for the <b>deep</b> <b>stratification</b> and overturning circulation in the limit of weak diapycnal mixing and numerical solutions that span the regimes of weak to strong diapycnal mixing are presented. The theory is tested with a coarse-resolution ocean general circulation model configured in an idealized geometry.

We investigate processes responsible for this seasonal contrast using an ocean general circulation model. The model is forced by TC winds prescribed from an analytic vortex using observed TC tracks and intensities during 1978 - 2007. The simulation accurately captures the seasonal cycle of salinity, temperature, and barrier layer in this region, with fresher waters, <b>deeper</b> upper-ocean <b>stratification,</b> and thicker barrier layers during postmonsoon season. It also reproduces the three times larger TC-induced cooling during premonsoon than during postmonsoon season. This difference is essentially related to seasonal changes in oceanic stratification rather than to differences in TC wind energy input. During the postmonsoon season, a <b>deeper</b> thermal <b>stratification</b> combined with a considerable upper-ocean freshening strongly inhibits surface cooling induced by vertical mixing underneath TCs. On average, thermal stratification accounts for ∼ 60 % of this cooling reduction during postmonsoon season, while haline stratification accounts for the remaining 40 %.

This cell ventilates the deep ocean and regulates the partitioning of CO 2 between the atmosphere and the ocean. The oceanographic community's conceptual understanding of the <b>deep</b> <b>stratification</b> and MOC has evolved from classic “abyssal recipes” arguments to a more recent appreciation of along-isopycnal upwelling in the Southern Ocean, consistent with a weakly mixed ocean interior. Both the <b>deep</b> <b>stratification</b> and the deep MOC are shown here {{to be sensitive to}} the form of the surface buoyancy forcing in a two-dimensional model that includes a circumpolar channel and northern basin. For a fixed surface buoyancy condition, the <b>deep</b> <b>stratification</b> is essentially prescribed, whereas for a fixed surface buoyancy flux, the <b>deep</b> <b>stratification</b> varies by orders of magnitude over the range of diapycnal diffusivity κ observed in the ocean.

In addition, these scalings are shown to be sensitive not only to the type of surface boundary condition, but also to the latitudinal structure of the surface fluxes.

In particular, the production of <b>deep</b> <b>stratification</b> in a simply configured numerical model with small diffusivity is explored. In the ventilated thermocline of the subtropical gyre, the meridional temperature gradient is mapped continously to a corresponding vertical profile, essentially independently of (sufficiently small) diffusivity.

It is shown that {{the way in which}} the thickness of the main internal thermocline (i. e., the diffusive lower part of the main thermocline), and the meridional overturning circulation, scales with diffusivity differs according to the presence or absence of a wind stress. For realistic parameter values, the ocean is in a scaling regime in which wind effects are important factors in the scaling of the thermohaline circulation, even for the single hemisphere, flat-bottomed case.

40|$|A {{quantitative}} {{theoretical model}} of the meridional overturning circulation and associated <b>deep</b> <b>stratification</b> in an interhemispheric, single-basin ocean with a circumpolar channel is presented. The theory includes the effects of wind, eddies, and diapycnal mixing, and predicts the <b>deep</b> <b>stratification</b> and overturning streamfunction {{in terms of the}} surface forcing and other parameters of the problem. It relies on a matching among three regions: the circumpolar channel at high southern latitudes, a region of isopycnal outcrop at high northern latitudes and the ocean basin between. The theory describes both the middepth and abyssal cells of a circulation representing North Atlantic Deep Water and Antarctic Bottom Water. It suggests that whereas the strength of the middepth overturning cell is primarily set by the wind stress in the circumpolar channel, mid depth stratification results from a balance between the wind-driven upwelling in the channel and deep water formation at high northern latitudes. Diapycnal mixing in the ocean interior can lead to warming and upwelling warm of deep waters. However, for parameters most representative of the present ocean mixing seems to play a minor role for the middepth cell.

40|$|The {{processes}} maintaining stratification in the oceanic middepth (between approximately 1000 and 3000 m) are explored {{using an}} eddy-resolving general circulation model {{composed of a}} two-hemisphere, semienclosed basin with a zonal reentrant channel in the southernmost eighth of the domain. The middepth region lies below the wind-driven main thermocline but above the diffusively driven abyssal ocean. Here, {{it is argued that}} middepth stratification is determined primarily in the model’s Antarctic Circumpolar Current. Competition between mean and eddy overturning in the channel leads to steeper isotherms and thus <b>deeper</b> <b>stratification</b> throughout the basin than would exist without the channel. Isotherms that outcrop only in the channel are nearly horizontal in the semienclosed portion of the domain, whereas isotherms that also outcrop in the Northern Hemisphere deviate from horizontal and are accompanied by geostrophically balanced meridional transport. A northern source of deep water (water with temperatures in the range of those in the channel) leads to the formation of a thick middepth thermostad. Changes in wind forcing over the channel influence the stratification throughout the domain. Since the middepth stratification is controlled by adiabatic dynamics in the channel, it becomes independent of the interior diffusivity k as k / 0. The meridional overturning circulation (MOC), as diagnosed by the mean meridional volume transport, also shows a tendency to become independent of k as k / 0, whereas the MOC diagnosed by water mass transport shows a continuing dependence on k as k / 0. A nonlocal scaling for MOC is developed that relates the strength of the northern MOC to the depth of isotherms in the southern channel. The results of this paper compare favorably to observations of large-scale neutral density in the World Ocean. 1...|$|R

40|$|The strong {{influence}} of enhanced diapycnal mixing over rough topography on bottom-water circulation is illustrated using results from two global ocean model experiments. In the first, diapycnal diffusivity {{is set to}} the observed background level of 105 m 2 s 1 in regions not subject to shear instability, convection, or surface-driven mixing. In the second experiment, mixing is enhanced above rough bottom topography to represent the dissipation of internal tides. Three important results are obtained. First, without the enhanced mixing in the abyssal ocean, the deep North Pacific Ocean becomes essentially a stagnant basin, with little bottom-water circulation and very weak <b>deep</b> <b>stratification.</b> Allowing for the enhanced diapycnal mixing above rough bottom topography leads to increased bottom-water circulation and <b>deep</b> <b>stratification</b> and a potential vorticity distribution in the North Pacific that is much more realistic. Second, the enhanced diapycnal mixing above rough topography results in a significant intensification and deepening of the Antarctic Circumpolar Current, {{as well as in}} stronger bottom-water formation around Antarctica.

The dynamics of these currents are unknown. In this study, {{the origin of the}} equatorial deep jets is explored through a series of numerical experiments. High resolution thermohaline spin up experiments were undertaken to investigate the thermohaline hypothesis of equatorial deep jets. It is found that the deep circulation strongly depends on the <b>deep</b> <b>stratification.</b> If this is unrealistically weak, an alternating jet structure and strong deep upwelling near the equator can be generated. This strong upwelling can result in an extra meridional overturning cell near the equator in the meridional mass transport streamfunction. The lack of stratification in the deep ocean is a generic deficiency of large scale circulation models which employ insulating bottom boundary conditions. The <b>deep</b> <b>stratification</b> can be improved greatly by using a Newtonian bottom boundary condition for temperature. The resulting streamfunction is more realistic and the deep equatorial overturning cell and alternating jets disappeared. It is the bottom boundary condition rather than the size of the vertical diffusion coefficient that is more important in determining the <b>deep</b> <b>stratification</b> and deep equatorial flow. Even though we cannot completely rule out the thermohaline forcing hypothesis of the equatorial deep jets (because thermohaline spinup experiments with very low explicit diffusion have not been carried out to investigate the dynamics of thermohaline circulation in a low diffusive regime), it is improbable that the deep jets are purely thermohaline in origin. High resolution, low diffusion wind-forced equatorial models were next run to investigate whether subthermocline mean equatorial currents can be generated via instabilities of the surface currents and wave-wave interactions. It is found that if eddy diffusion coefficients for momentum and heat are low enough, there are significant subthermocline time-mean currents. These currents are connected to low latitude western and eastern boundary subsurface currents.

40|$|The {{effect of}} the pole-to-pole surface {{temperature}} difference on the <b>deep</b> <b>stratification</b> {{and the strength of}} the global meridional overturning circulation (MOC) is examined in an eddy-resolving ocean model configured in an idealized domain roughly representing the Atlantic sector. Mesoscale eddies lead to qualitative differences in the mean stratification and the MOC compared to laminar (i. e., eddy free) models. For example, the spreading of fluid across the model’s representation of the Antarctic Circumpolar Current (ACC) no longer relies on the existence of a sill in the ACC. In addition, the deep- and bottom-water masses— roughly representing North Atlantic Deep Water (NADW) and Antarctic Bottom Water (ABW), respectively—are eroded by the eddies so that their zonal and meridional extents are much smaller than in the laminar case. It is found that if the north pole temperature is sufficiently warm, the formation of northern deep water is suppressed and the middepth cell is small and weak while the deep cell is large and vigorous. In contrast, if the north pole temperature is in the range of the southern channel temperatures, the middepth cell is large and strong while the deep cell has a reduced amplitude. This result is consistent with the predictions of the laminar theory of the MOC.

5000|$|Michael Behrenfeld proposes the [...] "Dilution Recoupling Hypothesis" [...] to {{describe}} the occurrence of annual spring blooms. He emphasized that phytoplankton growth is balanced by losses, and the balance is controlled by seasonally varying physical processes. He argued that the occurrence of optimum growth conditions allows for both the growth of predator and prey, which results in increased interactions between the two; it recouples predator-prey interactions. He describes this relationship as being diluted (fewer interactions) in the winter, when the mixed layer is <b>deep</b> and <b>stratification</b> of the water column is minimal. Similar observations were described by Landry and Hassett (1982). The most prominent evidence supporting Behrenfeld's hypothesis is that phytoplankton blooms occur before optimal growth conditions as predicted by mixed depth shoaling, when the phytoplankton concentrations are more diluted. As stratification is established and the biomass of zooplankton increases, grazing increases and the phytoplankton biomass declines over time. Behrenfeld’s research also modeled respiration as being inversely proportional to phytoplankton growth (as growth rate decreases, respiration rate increases). Behrenfeld’s model proposes the opposite relationship of phytoplankton growth rate to mixed layer depth than Sverdrup’s: that it is maximized when the layer is deepest and phytoplankton most diluted.|$|R

The model, expressed here {{in terms of the}} two-and-a-half-layer framework, predicts the stratification and meridional transport {{as a function of the}} mechanical and thermodynamic forcing at the sea surface. The approach is based on the classical elements of large-scale circulation theory—ideal thermocline, inertial western boundary currents, and eddy-controlled Antarctic Circumpolar Current (ACC) models—which are combined to produce a consistent three-dimensional view of the global overturning. The analytical tractability is achieved by assuming and subsequently verifying that the pattern of circulation in the model is largely controlled by adiabatic processes: the time-mean and eddy-induced isopycnal advection of buoyancy. The mean stratification of the lower thermocline is determined by the surface forcing in the ACC and, to a lesser extent, by the North Atlantic Deep Water formation rate. Although the vertical small-scale mixing and the diapycnal eddyflux components can substantially influence the magnitude of overturning, their effect on the net stratification of the midlatitude ocean is surprisingly limited.

It contains four major components: (a) a nonhomogeneous mesh difference scheme for second derivatives] 2 T(zk) /]z 2 and] 2 S(zk) /]z 2 at each data point (zk, Tk, Sk); (b) a set of key depths (depths of mixed layer, upper and lower thermoclines and haloclines, and deep layers) determined mostly by the geometric features of profiles, such as depths of minimum and maximum of] 2 T(zk) /]z 2 and] 2 S(zk) /]z 2 for shelf water and upper portion deep water; (c) modeled profiles T ˆ (zk) and Sˆ(zk), which are linearly interpolated from observed T, S values at the key depths; and (d) statistical tests for accepting [T ˆ (zk), Sˆ(zk) ] as a good representative of (zk, Tk, Sk). The output of this geometric model {{is a set of}} major characteristics of each profile: sea surface temperature (salinity), mixed layer depth, upper- and lower-thermocline (halocline) depths, thermocline (halocline) temperature (salinity) gradient, and <b>deep</b> layer <b>stratification.</b> Analyzing 3562 Beaufort/ Chukchi Sea historical (1970 – 93) temperature and salinity profiles from the Naval Oceanographic Office’s Master Oceanographic Observation Data Set by this geometric model, the Beaufort/Chukchi Sea thermohaline field reveals a dual structure: one layer (vertically uniform) on the continental shelf (depth, 150 m) during winter and multiple layers (mixed layer, thermocline/halocline, sublayer) during summer. Strong seasonal variations were also found in mixed layer depth, upper thermocline/halocline depth, and strength. 1...|$|R
40|$|The role of {{baroclinic}} eddies in transferring {{thermal gradients}} laterally, and thus determining the stratification of the ocean, is examined. The {{hypothesis is that}} the density differences imposed at the surface by differential heating {{are a source of}} available potential energy that can be partially released by mesocale eddies with horizontal scales on the order of 100 km. Eddy fluxes balance the diapycnal mixing of heat and thus determine the vertical scale of penetration of horizontal thermal gradients (i. e., the depth of the thermocline). This conjecture is in contrast with the current thinking that the <b>deep</b> <b>stratification</b> is determined by a balance between diapycnal mixing and the large-scale thermohaline circulation. Eddy processes are analyzed {{in the context of a}} rapidly rotating primitive equation flow driven by specified surface temperature, with isotropic diffusion and viscosity. The barotropic component of the eddies is found to be responsible for most of the heat flux, and so the eddy transport is horizontal rather than isopycnal. This eddy transport takes place in the shallow surface layer where eddies, as well as the mean temperature, undergo diabatic, irreversible mixing. Scaling laws for the depth of the thermocline as a function of the external parameters are proposed. In the classical thermocline theory, the depth of the thermocline depends on the diffusivity, the rotation rate, and the imposed temperature gradient. In this study the authors find an additional dependence on the viscosity and on the domain width. 1...|$|E
40|$|Variations in the {{assemblage}} {{and abundance}} of coccoliths reveal changes in {{oceanic and atmospheric}} dynamics in the Guyana Basin over the last climatic cycle, mainly linked to latitudinal variations in the ITCZ (Intertropical Convergence Zone). Records of the N ratio (a palaeoproductivity index of coccolithophores) allowed us to monitor nutri-thermocline fluctuations. Nannofossil accumulation rates (NAR) vary closely with the N ratio, indicating {{a strong correlation between}} these two palaeoproductivity proxies. Decreases in the N ratio and NAR values suggest lower palaeoproductivity during glacial substages, indicating a deep nutri-thermocline (<b>deep</b> <b>stratification</b> of the mixed layer) {{as a consequence of the}} piling up of warm water dragged by the NEC. This setting was favoured by the southern shift of the ITCZ and Trade winds which blew perpendicular to the Guyana coast. By contrast, increases in the N ratio and NAR values revealed higher palaeoproductivity during interglacial substages, suggesting a shoaling of the nutri-thermocline. This scenario is favoured by a northward displacement of the ITCZ with the southeast Trade winds blowing alongshore. Additionally, palaeoproductivity changes during substages of Marine Isotope Stage (MIS) 6 - 5 are of much higher amplitude than those recorded in substages of MIS 4 - 2 and the early Holocene. Similarities between the palaeoproductivity and the 65 &deg; N summer insolation records, suggest a link between the depth of nutri-thermocline, the latitudinal migration of the ITCZ and ice-sheet changes in the Northern Hemisphere...|$|E
40|$|Abstract. The Gulf of California (GC) {{presents}} several oceanographic {{features that}} make it unique among semienclosed seas of similar latitude and dimensions, the most important being strong tidal mixing, some of it close to <b>deep</b> <b>stratification.</b> Three-dimensional numerical model results suggest that tidal mixing {{may be more important}} than the thermohaline circulation in causing the long-term residual circulation, which consists of outflow in the upper 200 m and inflow below, plus a seasonally-reversing surface layer. The GC is an evaporative basin, but in the mean it gains heat through the surface. Lacking a sill at the point of connection with the Pacific Ocean (PO), the GC is constantly shaken by a wide spectrum of signals coming from the PO, including tides, subinertial trapped waves of various frequencies and El Niño. The seasonal dynamics and thermodynamics of the GC are dominated by the PO, not by local wind or buoyancy flux. Local processes are important at shorter time scales and in altering the thermohaline characteristics of the upper-layer waters. Tidal currents generate internal tides, packets of solitons, and sea surface temperature fronts from which jets may form. Coastal upwelling also seems to generate jets that separate from capes, especially on the mainland coast. The mesoscale off-shore circulation in the GC consists of a series of basin-wide geostrophic gyres that reach below 1000 m; their effect on the mean and seasonal circulation and thermodynamics of the GC remains to be studied. During summer, the currents in the mainland continental shelf are due to coastal trapped waves, while during winter they are wind-driven. The most important interannual anomalies in the GC are due to El Niño...|$|E
40|$|Most genome linkage scans for autism {{spectrum}} disorders (ASDs) {{have failed}} to be replicated. Recently, a new ASD phenotypic sub-classification method was developed which employed cluster analyses of severity scores from the Autism Diagnostic Interview-Revised (ADI-R). Here, we performed linkage analysis {{for each of the}} four identified ADI-R stratified subgroups. Additional stratification was also applied to reduce intra-family heterogeneity and to investigate the impact of gender. For the purpose of replication, two independent sets of single nucleotide polymorphism markers for 392 families were used in our study. This <b>deep</b> subject <b>stratification</b> protocol resulted in 16 distinct group-specific datasets for linkage analysis. No locus reached significance for the combined non-stratified cohort. However, study-wide significant (P = 0. 02) linkage scores were reached for chromosomes 22 q 11 (LOD= 4. 43) and 13 q 21 (LOD= 4. 37) for two subsets representing the most severely language impaired individuals with ASD. Notably, 13 q 21 has been previously linked to autism with language impairment, and 22 q 11 has been separately associated with either autism or language disorders. Linkage analysis on chromosome 5 p 15 for a combination of two stratified female-containing subgroups demonstrated suggestive linkage (LOD= 3. 5), which replicates previous linkage result for female-containing pedigrees. A trend was also found for the association of previously reported 5 p 14 -p 15 SNPs in the same female-containing cohort. This study demonstrates a novel and effective method to address the heterogeneity in genetic studies of ASD. Moreover, the linkage results for the stratifie...|$|R
40|$|We analyze aspects {{concerning}} the thermohaline changes {{observed in the}} near-bottom layer of the Southern Adriatic Pit (SAP), in the Eastern Mediterranean, after the arrival of abundant and exceptionally dense water (rh> 30 kg m 23) produced in the shallow Northern Adriatic Sea during winter 2012. For this purpose, we use temperature (T), salinity (S), and current time series collected at the E 2 M 3 A deep-ocean observatory of the Southern Adriatic, and Conductivity-Temperature-Depth data obtained both in the Southern and Middle Adriatic from freely drifting profiling floats. The dense water produced in the Northern Adriatic arrived in the central and deepest part of the SAP {{as a series of}} individual pulses starting on 10 March 2012; while, a stronger and prolonged signal that significantly modified the local <b>deep</b> water <b>stratification</b> arrived after 10 April 2012. As a consequence, T and S suddenly decreased (0. 15 C and 0. 015), thus interrupting positive T and S bottom trends observed during the previous 5 years and producing a density increase of 0. 02 kg m 23. Such variability has been rarely observed in the area. We ascribe its occurrence to the concomitance of exceptionally harsh and long-lasting Bora wind, scarce precipitation, and low river discharge over the Northern Adriatic during winter 2011 / 2012. Eventually, this newly formed AdDW reached the Strait of Otranto during July 2012. Its characteristics profoundly differed from those observed in the previous decade. Hence, a noticeable variability in structure and circulation of the abyssal layers of the Ionian basin is likely to occur in the near future...|$|R
40|$|International audienceInternal tide driven mixing plays a {{key role}} in {{sustaining}} the <b>deep</b> ocean <b>stratification</b> and meridional overturning circulation. Internal tides can be generated by topographic horizontal scales ranging from hundreds of meters to tens of kilometers. State of the art topographic products barely resolve scales smaller than approximate to 10 km in the deep ocean. On these scales abyssal hills dominate ocean floor roughness. The impact of abyssal hill roughness on internal-tide generation is evaluated in this study. The conversion of M- 2 barotropic to baroclinic tidal energy is calculated based on linear wave theory both in real and spectral space using the Shuttle Radar Topography Mission SRTM 30 _PLUS bathymetric product at 1 / 120 degrees resolution with and without the addition of synthetic abyssal hill roughness. Internal tide generation by abyssal hills integrates to 0. 1 TW globally or 0. 03 TW when the energy flux is empirically corrected for supercritical slope (i. e., approximate to 10 % of the energy flux due to larger topographic scales resolved in standard products in both cases). The abyssal hill driven energy conversion is dominated by mid-ocean ridges, where abyssal hill roughness is large. Focusing on two regions located over the Mid-Atlantic Ridge and the East Pacific Rise, it is shown that regionally linear theory predicts an increase of the energy flux due to abyssal hills of up to 100 % or 60 % when an empirical correction for supercritical slopes is attempted. Therefore, abyssal hills, unresolved in state of the art topographic products, can have a strong impact on internal tide generation, especially over mid-ocean ridges...|$|R
