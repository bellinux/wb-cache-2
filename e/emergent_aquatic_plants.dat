40|$|Differential {{solar heating}} {{can result from}} shading by rooted <b>emergent</b> <b>aquatic</b> <b>plants,</b> {{producing}} a temperature difference between vegetated and unvegetated regions of a surface water body. This temperature difference will promote an exchange flow between the vegetation and open water. Drag associated with the submerged portion of the plants modifies this exchange, specifically, changing the dominant velocity scale. Scaling analysis predicts several distinct flow regimes, including inertia-dominated, drag-dominated and energy-limiting regimes. After a constant heat source is initiated, the flow is initially inertial, but quickly transitions to the drag-dominated regime. The energy-limiting regime {{is not likely to}} occur in the presence of rooted vegetation. Laboratory experiments describe the exchange flow and confirm the scaling analysis. Particle Imaging Velocimetry (PIV) was used to quantify the velocity field. Once the exchange flow enters the drag-dominated regime, the intrusion velocity uV is steady. The intrusion velocity decreases with increasing density of vegetation. The thickness of the intruding layer is set by the length scale of light penetration. National Science Foundation (U. S.)

The {{study was conducted in}} two regions of Romania: the Târnava Basin and the Fizeş Valley. Ponds from Târnava were more vegetated with <b>emergent</b> <b>aquatic</b> <b>plants</b> (Phragmites australis and Typha sp.). The amphibian species richness in ponds was higher in Târnava than in Fizeş and, conversely, Fizeş contained a higher number of bird species. The diversity of the amphibian species is not related to pond area, however, there was a positive relationship in both regions between amphibian species richness and the percentage of emergent vegetation cover. Bird’s species richness, on the other hand, was positively related to both pond area and vegetation cover in Târnava whereas only to vegetation cover in Fizeş. The z values of the species-area relationship for amphibians were low in both regions and slightly negative in Târnava.

40|$|The Trichechus inunguis is {{endemic to}} the Amazon region. Observation is nearly {{impossible}} because of the turbid water, which consequently hinders study of their behaviour. In this study, we deployed the acceleration data loggers to 9 captive Amazonian manatees to classify their behaviour at INPA, Brazil. The experiments were also recorded by video camera. We classified four types of behaviours: inactive on the bottom, walking on the bottom, surfacing and swimming. Inactive and walking on the bottom were classified using standard deviation (SD) of dive depth and longitudinal acceleration. The SD of dive depth shows the low variability in inactive and walking on the bottom (ranged from 0. 0 to 0. 1 m), the SD of longitudinal acceleration shows the low variability in inactive (from 0. 00 to 0. 01 ms(- 2)), high variability in walking on the bottom (from 0. 01 to 0. 15 ms(- 2)). Mean classification accuracy was 87. 1 % and 84. 9 % during inactive and walking on the bottom, respectively. 6 manatees were fed floating vegetables during experiment, and they showed a characteristic of long surfacing during feeding time.

40|$|Aims Our {{objective}} {{was to assess the}} phytotoxicity of atrazine residue in water on the <b>emergent</b> <b>aquatic</b> <b>plant</b> Scirpus tabernaemontani. Methods We conducted hydroponics experiments to study the effects of atrazine stress on peroxidase (POD) and root activities, malonaldehyde (MDA) and chlorophyll contents, relative water content (RWC) of leaf and fresh weight of S. tabernaemontani. The original dosages of atrazine in the culture solution based on Hoagland solution were 1, 2, 4, 8 and 16 mg·L– 1. Plant samples were collected 15, 30, 45 and 60 days after the onset of the experiment. Important findings POD and root activities, chlorophyll content, RWC and fresh weight of S. tabernaemontani decreased, and MDA contents increased. All results indicated that elevated concentration of atrazine (> 8 mg·L– 1) has significant effects on biomass and physiological characteristics of S. tabernaemontani. With the exception of chlorophyll contents, the harmful effects weakened with prolonged treatment exposure due to degradation of atrazine.

40|$|The growing {{availability}} of multi-temporal satellite data has increased opportunities for monitoring large rivers from space. A variety of passive and active sensors {{operating in the}} visible and microwave range are currently operating, or planned, which can estimate inundation area and delineate flood boundaries. Radar altimeters show great promise for directly measuring stage variation in large rivers. It {{also appears to be}} possible to obtain estimates of river discharge from space, using ground measurements and satellite data to construct empirical curves that relate water surface area to discharge. Extrapolation of these curves to ungauged sites may be possible for the special case of braided rivers. Where clouds, trees and floating vegetation do not obscure the water surface, high-resolution visible/infrared sensors provide good delineation of inundated areas. Synthetic aperture radar (SAR) sensors can penetrate clouds and can also detect standing water through <b>emergent</b> <b>aquatic</b> <b>plants</b> and forest canopies. However, multiple frequencies and polarizations are required for optimal discrimination of various inundated vegetation cover types. Existing single-polarization, fixed-frequency SARs are not sucient for mapping inundation area in all riverine environments. In the absence of a space-borne multi-parameter SAR, a synergistic approach using single-frequency, fixed-polarization SAR and visible/infrared data will provide the best results over densely vegetated river floodplains. # 1997 John Wiley &...|$|E

40|$|The carbon isotopic {{composition}} of methane emitted by the Alaskan <b>emergent</b> <b>aquatic</b> <b>plants</b> Arctophila fulva, a tundra mid-lake macrophyte, and Carex rostrata, a tundra lake margin macrophyte, was − 58. 6 ± 0. 5 (n= 2) and − 66. 6 ± 2. 5 (n= 6) ‰ respectively. The methane emitted by these species {{was found to}} be depleted in 13 C by 12 ‰ and 18 ‰, relative to methane withdrawn from plant stems 1 to 2 cm below the waterline. As the macrophyte-mediated methane flux represented approximately 97 % of the flux from these sites, these results suggest the more rapid transport of 12 CH 4 relative to 13 CH 4 through plants to the atmosphere. This preferential release of the light isotope of methane, possibly combined with CH 4 oxidation, caused the buildup of the heavy isotope within plant stems. Plant stem methane concentrations ranged from 0. 2 to 4. 0 % (math formula, 1. 4; standard deviation (sd), 0. 9; n= 28) in Arctophila, with an {{isotopic composition}} of − 46. 1 ± 4. 3 ‰ (n = 8).

40|$|Aquatic {{invertebrates}} were sampled {{annually in}} the Niobrara River, Nebraska, during the period 1996 - 2009 using Hester-Dendy multiplate samplers. Collections indicated the invertebrate community in the river has shifted from one dominated by Ephemeroptera, Plecoptera, and Trichoptera (EPT) taxa to one dominated by Chironomidae and Amphipoda. Generally, EPT richness and percentage abundance of EPT of the total community, as well as percentage abundance of Heptageniidae and Leptophlebiidae, has declined across the years. During that same period, percentage abundance of Amphipoda and Chironomidae, taxa evenness, Shannon 2 ̆ 7 s Index, and the Hilsenhoff Biotic Index have increased. Stream discharge decreased significantly during the 15 -year period when invertebrates were collected (Mann-Kendall trend test, P = 0. 04).

The {{purpose of this study was}} to quantify stomatal size and density in the navel and lamina of N. odorata and determine if these morphological traits contribute to regulation of the flow-through system. Stomatal density, stomatal size, leaf area, and navel area were measured, in plants contained in high and low water treatments; stomatal measurements were made using compound microscopy and image processing was done with ImageJ software. Stomatal conductance, transpiration and leaf temperature were measured using a steady-state porometer in order to assess differences in gas exchange in different parts of the leaf and with different leaf ages. This study found that there is a large difference in navel and laminar stomata size with navel stomata being 2. 4 times larger. There is also a difference in navel and laminar stomata density with laminar stomata being 10. 44 times denser. Navel area forms a linear relationship with lamina area but only in the high water treatment. Porometer measurements showed that there were no differences in stomatal conductance, transpiration nor leaf temperature between the navel and lamina nor between old and new leaves.

To determine more accurately {{the quantity and quality of}} water needed to operate a marsh, a project was undertaken by the Utah Department of Fish and Game, the Engineering Experiment Station and the Cooperative Wildlife Research Unit at Utah State University. The study was divided into the two phases, one on quantity and one on quality of water. The present report deals with one aspect of the water quality phase, i. e. that of dealing with the effect of salinity and the salinity tolerance of important <b>emergent</b> <b>aquatic</b> <b>plants.</b> A large amount of research has been conducted to determine the water requirements of agricultural crops, but relatively little is known about quality of water needed to assure good growth of the more important emergent waterfowl plants.

40|$|Compared {{with the}} free atmosphere, the aquatic {{environment}} is oxygen poor. As a result many secondarily aquatic organisms have adaptations {{that allow them to}} continue to use the atmosphere, directly or indirectly, to supply their oxygen requirements. This thesis examines how diving insects use bubbles of air collected at {{the surface of the water}} as oxygen reserves, gills and flotation devices, and how an aquatic angiosperm channels convective flows of air from its emergent leaves to its submerged organs. 1. Backswimmers (Anisops spp.) begin a dive positively buoyant, but rapidly enter a protracted period of near neutral buoyancy. A bubble of air held on the insect’s abdomen shrinks as respiration consumes its oxygen, while at the same time highly soluble carbon dioxide dissolves into the surrounding water. The reduced air volume confers neutral buoyancy. In response to low oxygen partial pressure (PO 2) in the bubble, oxygen is released from large haemoglobin cells in the abdomen. The haemoglobin’s sensitivity to falling PO 2 maintains the oxygen tension between 5. 1 and 2. 0 kPa. This stabilises the volume and buoyancy of the bubble. During a dive the haemoglobin and air-store supply 0. 25 and 0. 26 μL of oxygen, respectively. 2. The oxygen affinity of backswimmer haemoglobin determines the stability of the neutrally buoyant phase as well as its ability to satisfy the insect’s respiration. An oxygen equilibrium curve (OEC) determined in vivo has a highly sigmoid shape and an oxygen affinity of 3. 9 kPa. In comparison with OEC made in vitro, the in vivo measurements show increased cooperativity and oxygen affinity, consistent with the presence of cationic effectors. Models strongly support the accuracy of the in vivo OEC method. 3. It has long been assumed that a bubble of air held over the spiracles of an insect enables the uptake of oxygen from the surrounding water and thus acts as a ‘gas gill’. Oxygen diffuses into a bubble of air when its PO 2 is lower than the surrounding water, but a coincident higher nitrogen partial pressure causes it to dissolve. Several models have been produced to describe the gas exchange process, but all are based on untested assumptions of gill parameters. Measurements of gas gill volume and PO 2 made on water bugs (Agraptocorixa eurynome) demonstrate that both drop quickly at the beginning of a dive, but PO 2 reaches a stable level while the gas gill continues to dissolve. The importance of ventilation in maintaining an acceptable rate of oxygen consumption is also shown. 4. Interconnected gas spaces within the leaves, stems and rhizomes are a common feature of many <b>emergent</b> <b>aquatic</b> <b>plants.</b> Pressurised air from the leaves and culms of these plants ventilate these lacunae, flowing back to the atmosphere through efflux points. Unlike most aquatic plants, which have simple interconnected pith spaces, sacred lotus, Nelumbo nucifera, possess discrete gas canals which only interconnect where a leaf grows from the rhizome. Silicone casts and pneumatic tests of the gas canals reveal a complex repeating pattern of interconnections which channel air from specific regions of the leaf blade to the rhizome and out through efflux points on adjacent leaves. 5. Lotus, Nelumbo nucifera, possess in the centre of their leaves a specialised efflux organ which connects the gas canals in the leaves and stems with the atmosphere through the apertures of large stomata. Measurements made on excised lotus leaves and in situ reveal that the large stomata act as exhaust valves, opening and closing in a diurnal pattern to regulate the flow of pressurised gas from the leaf lamina and gas canals. This behaviour is shown to regulate gas flow rate and direction. The aquatic environment offers similar respiratory challenges to both plants and insects. While the oxygen uptake and transport mechanisms evolved by these groups are markedly different, they all function according to the same physical laws. Diving insects are separated from the atmosphere while underwater, forcing them to rely on oxygen either carried with them from the surface or extracted from the surrounding water. <b>Emergent</b> <b>aquatic</b> <b>plants</b> have permanent access to atmospheric oxygen, but must transport it long distances from their aerial leaves and stems to their roots and rhizomes. This thesis examines the uptake and storage of oxygen by diving insects and the gas transport system of the sacred lotus. Thesis(Ph. D.)

40|$|English Abstract: The {{emergent}} plants {{may differ}} in their capacity to assimilate nutrients from eutrophic water bodies, so the utilization of suitable emergent plants is the key part for successful restoration of shallow eutrophic lakes. This research applied the depletion method after plants were grown for 4 weeks in 1 / 8 Hoagland nutrient solution to study the kinetics of uptake of nutrient (H 2 PO 4 -, NH 4 +, NO 3 -) by the three <b>emergent</b> <b>aquatic</b> <b>plants</b> Phragmites australis, Typha orientalis and Scirpus triqueter dominated in the littoral zones of Wuliangsuhai Lake (40 ° 36 '- 41 ° 03 'N, 108 ° 43 '- 108 ° 57 'E), a shallow eutrophic lake located in Urat Front Banner of Bayannaoer city, Inner Mongolia. The maximum uptake rate (Imax), Michaelis-Menten constant (Km), and Minimum equilibrium concentration (Cmin) were estimated by the ion consumption dynamics equation. The Imax for H 2 PO 4 - of Phragmites australis, Typha orientalis, and Scirpus triqueter are 0. 3895 μmol g- 1 (dry weight, DW) h- 1, 0. 3053 μmol g- 1 DW h- 1, and 0. 6330 μmol g- 1 DW h- 1, While the Km for H 2 PO 4 - are 0. 0637 mmol/L, 0. 0645 mmol/L, and 0. 0702 mmol/L, respectively. Results indicated that the Scirpus triqueter has a significantly higher uptake rate of H 2 PO 4 - than Phragmites australis and Typha orientalis, but no differences {{have been found in}} the adaptation (tolerance) of the three species to low H 2 PO 4 - concentrations. The Imax for NH 4 + of Phragmites australis, Typha orientalis, and Scirpus triqueter are 8. 995 μmol g- 1 DW h- 1, 5. 584 μmol g- 1 DW h- 1, and 13. 819 μmol g- 1 DW h- 1, While the Km for NH 4 + are 1. 882 mmol/L, 1. 787 mmol/L, and 1. 874 mmol/L, respectively. The Imax for NO 3 - of Phragmites australis, Typha orientalis, and Scirpus triqueter are 3. 374 μmol g- 1 DW h- 1, 2. 544 μmol g- 1 DW h- 1, and 10. 146 μmol g- 1 DW h- 1, While the Km for NO 3 - are 0. 924 mmol/L, 0. 884 mmol/L, and 0. 847 mmol/L, respectively. Results indicated that Scirpus triqueter had also highest uptake rates of NH 4 + and NO 3 -, was tolerant to low NO 3 - concentrations but did not adapt to (tolerate) low NH 4 + concentrations. By contrast, Typha orientalis dislayed the strongest affinity to NH 4 + and the highest uptake at low NH 4 + concentrations, which the Cmin is 1. 724 mmol/L lower than Phragmites australis (1. 865 mmol/L) and Scirpus triqueter (1. 833 mmol/L). Overall the three emergent plants showed higher uptake capacity for NH 4 + than for NO 3 -. Nutrient uptake characteristics of the emergent plants are species-specific and influenced by the structure of roots. Outcomes of this research suggest that Scirpus triqueter suits best as pioneering species for ecological restoration of water bodies with high NH 4 + and NO 3 - concentrations, while Typha orientalis suits well for stabilizing improved water quality conditions. 采用常规耗竭法研究了浅水富营养化湖泊——乌梁素海湖滨植被带 3 种挺水植物芦苇、香蒲和藨草对H 2 PO 4 -、NH 4 +、NO 3 -的吸收动力学特征及差异。结果表明： 3 种挺水植物吸收H 2 PO 4 -时，藨草的吸收速率显著大于芦苇和香蒲，但三者对低浓度H 2 PO 4 -的适应能力均无显著差异；藨草对NH 4 +和NO 3 -的吸收速率均显著大于芦苇和香蒲，且在低浓度NO 3 -环境下仍能吸收该离子，但对低浓度NH 4 +环境的适应能力较差；与藨草相比，香蒲对NH 4 +的亲和力最强，吸收低浓度NH 4 +的效果最好。 3 种植物对NH 4 +的吸收能力均大于NO 3 -。挺水植物的养分吸收特征具有物种特异性并受根系结构的影响。利用植物的养分吸收特征，在富营养化湖泊生态修复中适宜用藨草治理含高浓度H 2 PO 4 -，NH 4 +和NO 3 -的水体，修复到一定程度后再种植香蒲来维持水质。张熙灵, 王立新, 刘华民, 清 华, 刘东伟, 王 炜, 梁存柱, Friedrich Recknage...|$|E
40|$|The {{movement}} of methane (CH 4) from anaerobic sediments through the leaves, stems, and flowers of <b>aquatic</b> <b>plants</b> {{and into the}} atmosphere was found to provide a significant pathway for the emission of CH 4 from the aquatic substrates of flooded wetlands. Methane concentrations well above the surrounding ambient air levels {{were found in the}} mesophyll of 16 varies of <b>aquatic</b> <b>plants</b> and are attributed to transpiration, diffusion, and pressure-induced flow of gaseous CH 4 from the roots when they are embedded in CH 4 -saturated anaerobic sediments. Methane emissions from the <b>emergent</b> parts of <b>aquatic</b> <b>plants</b> were measured using floating chamber techniques and by enclosing the plants in polyethylene bags of known volume. Concentration changes were monitored in the trapped air using syringes and gas chromatographic techniques. Vertical profiles of dissolved CH 4 in sediment pore water surrounding the aquatic plants' rhizomes were obtained using an interstitial sampling technique. Methane emissions from the <b>aquatic</b> <b>plants</b> studied varied from 14. 8 mg CH 4 /d to levels too low to be detectable. Rooted and unrooted freshwater <b>aquatic</b> <b>plants</b> were studied as well as saltwater and brackish water plants.

40|$|The {{water level}} of Par Pond was lowered {{approximately}} 20 feet in mid- 1991 {{in order to}} protect downstream residents from possible dam failure suggested by subsidence on the downstream slope of the dam and to repair the dam. This lowering exposed both emergent and nonemergent macrophyte beds to drying conditions resulting in extensive losses. A survey of the newly <b>emergent,</b> shoreline <b>aquatic</b> <b>plant</b> communities of Par Pond began in June 1995, three months after the refilling of Par Pond to approximately 200 feet above mean sea level. These surveys continued in July, September, and late October, 1995, and into the early spring and late summer of 1996. Communities similar to the pre-drawdown, Par Pond <b>aquatic</b> <b>plant</b> communities continue to become re-established. Emergent beds of maidencane, lotus, waterlily, watershield, and Pontederia are extensive and well developed. Measures of percent cover, width of beds, and estimates of area of coverage with satellite data indicate regrowth within two years of from 40 to 60 % of levels prior to the draw down. Cattail occurrence continued to increase during the summer of 1996, especially in the former warm arm of Par Pond, but large beds common to Par Pond prior to the draw down still have not formed. Lotus has invaded and occupies many of the areas formerly dominated by cattail beds. To track the continued development of macrophytes in Par Pond, future surveys through the summer and early fall of 1997, along with the evaluation of satellite data to map the extent of the macrophyte beds of Par Pond, are planned...|$|R
40|$|Description: Purple loosestrife (Lythrum salicaria L.) is an <b>emergent</b> <b>aquatic</b> <b>plant</b> {{that usually}} grows on moist or {{saturated}} soils. A mature, well established plant often grows up to 10 {{feet tall and}} 5 feet wide. Each plant can contain 30 - 50 herbaceous stems that arise from a common rootstock. The purple-magenta colored, five to six petalled flowers grow on long spikes. Purple loosestrife seed production depends on plant age, size and vigor. A 4 - 5 year old plant with 30 stems can reportedly produce an estimated 2, 700, 000 seeds. Seed maintains viability of over 80 percent for at least 3 years. Impacts: Purple loosestrife is native to Eurasia and was first discovered in the Puget Sound region in 1929. Impacts on native vegetation have been dramatic. It is a vigorous competitor and can crowd other vegetation including native species. In {{a short period of}} time it will completely dominate a site. When purple loosestrife invades irrigation systems, economic losses to agriculture can exceed $ 2. 6 million annually. Control Options: Thurston County’s Integrated Pest Management emphasizes cultural, biological, and manual control methods to keep pests and vegetation problems low enough to prevent damage. The goal of Thurston County’s pesticide use policy is to minimize the use of pesticides by utilizing and providing information about the most effective control options that are available and practical. ► Cultural / Habitat Purple Loosestrife is now a quarantined species (a plant that is forbidden to be sold or transported) in Washington State. However, it was once sold and intentionally planted as a landscape and garden ornamental. It is still introduced occasionally as a component in wildflower seed mixtures. Review the ingredients of wildflower mixes to prevent accidental introduction, and avoid using those with unidentified seed components entirely. To prevent plants from spreading from known infestations, carefully clean vehicles and boats, boots, clothing, and pets after visiting infested areas. (Lythrum salicaria L) ► Manual / Mechanical Cutting, mowing or digging purple loosestrife is only partly effective. These methods can prevent seed production, but plants will likely re-sprout. Using this technique may also be difficult due the issue of access to the site in aquatic and wetland areas. Flowers should be carefully clipped and double bagged to prevent spreading seeds to new areas...|$|R
