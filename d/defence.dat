40|$|Tort law {{provides}} for {{a large number of}} <b>defences</b> to liability. While the circumstances in which some of these <b>defences</b> apply have been explored in detail, scant attention has been given to the theoretical foundations of <b>defences.</b> In particular, no serious attempt has been made to explain how <b>defences</b> relate to each other. This thesis seeks to reduce this gap in our understanding of tort law by proposing a system by which <b>defences</b> may be organised. It is argued that tort <b>defences</b> should be arranged into a threefold taxonomy consisting in (1) absent element defences; (2) justifications; and (3) public policy <b>defences.</b> These categories differentiate <b>defences</b> from each other {{on the basis of the}} story that they tell about the defendant’s practical reasoning. Absent element <b>defences</b> indicate that the defendant did not commit any wrong. Justifications reveal that the defendant acted wrongly but that his acts conformed to the balance of reasons. Public policy <b>defences</b> give no insight as to the quality of the defendant’s practical reasoning. The full-text of this thesis is not currently available in ORA...|$|R

40|$|This book is {{the third}} {{in a series of}} essay {{collections}} on <b>defences</b> in private law. It addresses <b>defences</b> to liability arising in contract. The essays range from those adopting a predominantly black-letter approach to others that examine the law from a more theoretical or historical perspective. Some essays focus on individual <b>defences,</b> while others are concerned with the links between <b>defences,</b> or with how <b>defences</b> relate to the structure of contract law generally. One goal of the book is to determine what light can be shed on contract law doctrines by analysing them through the lens of <b>defences.</b> The contributors – judges and academics – are all leading jurists. The essays are addressed to all of the major common law jurisdictions. - See more at: [URL]...|$|R
5|$|A small {{ministry}} of <b>defence</b> (which was renamed the Ministry of <b>Defence</b> and Security in 2007) {{was established in}} 2002 to provide civilian oversight of the F-FDTL. A lack of suitable staff for the ministry and the close political relationship between senior F-FDTL officers and government figures rendered this oversight largely ineffectual and retarded the development of East Timor's <b>defence</b> policy up to at least 2004. The failure to institute effective civilian oversight of the F-FDTL also limited {{the extent to which}} foreign countries are willing to provide assistance to the F-FDTL and contributed to the 2006 crisis. As at early 2010 the Ministry of <b>Defence</b> and Security was organised into elements responsible for <b>defence</b> (including the F-FDTL) and security (including the PNTL), each headed by their own secretary of state. At this time the East Timorese Government was working to expand the ministry's capacity with assistance from UNMIT, but continuing shortages of qualified staff limited {{the extent to which the}} ministry could provide civilian oversight to the security sector. Moreover, elements of the F-FDTL were continuing to resist civilian control over the security forces at this time, and the force had not opened itself to international scrutiny.|$|E

40|$|The central {{question}} {{of this study}} involves {{the relation between the}} use of takeover <b>defences</b> and IPO firm value. We report that management frequently uses takeover <b>defences</b> before taking the firm public. The use of takeover <b>defences</b> is primarily motivated by managerial entrenchment. IPO investors anticipate potential conflict of interests with management and reduce the price they pay for the IPO shares if takeover <b>defences</b> are adopted. Although managers internalise this cost of takeover <b>defences</b> to the degree they own pre-IPO stock, they are likely to gain through private control benefits. Non-management pre-IPO owners lose. Their shares are worth less, but different from managers, they do not get offsetting private control benefits. We infer that managers use takeover <b>defences</b> to protect private control benefits at non-management pre-IPO owners' expense. Copyright Blackwell Publishing Ltd, 2003. ...|$|R
