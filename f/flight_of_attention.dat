40|$|A {{numerical}} example is given of a previously proposed methodology {{for the evaluation}} of in-flight thrust measurement uncertainty, using data extracted from a performance report comparing two different missile prototypes under a variety <b>of</b> <b>flight</b> conditions. <b>Attention</b> is given to the data for the AGM- 68 B Air Launched Cruise Missile, which is powered by the F 107 dual-spool, mixed flow turbofan engine. Assessments are made of the definition of the measurement process, instrumentation error estimation, the propagation of errors to thrust calculation, mathematical model errors, the in-flight thrust error component, and correction to standard conditions. It is concluded that in-flight thrust measurement uncertainty limits can be evaluated from measurement system error analysis results and test data for the missile evaluation process presently described...|$|R
40|$|An {{executable}} assertion is {{a logical}} statement about the variables or a block of code. If there is no error during execution, the assertion statement results in a true value. Executable assertions {{can be used for}} dynamic testing of software. They can be employed for validation during the design phase, and exception and error detection during the operation phase. The present investigation is concerned with the problem of writing executable assertions, taking into account the use of assertions for testing flight software. They can be employed for validation during the design phase, and for exception handling and error detection during the operation phase The digital flight control system and the flight control software are discussed. The considered system provides autopilot and <b>flight</b> director modes <b>of</b> operation for automatic and manual control of the aircraft during all phases <b>of</b> <b>flight.</b> <b>Attention</b> is given to techniques for writing and using assertions to test flight software, an experimental setup to test flight software, and language features to support efficient use of assertions...|$|R

50|$|Functional {{associations}} seem {{to decrease}} in strength {{and there are}} fewer mental impositions on the sensory perception of the object. Aspects which are normally filtered out are given equal attention. Therefore, objects are not necessarily conceptualized via their use but rather experienced as a whole. Detailed attention is paid, focussing on certain aspects of an object, a sentence or any other perceptual input in a magnifying way. Clearly the attention process is affected. Only a narrow amount of diverse contents the focus <b>of</b> <b>attention</b> and fewer objects are perceived. A person may become absorbed by one object, event or process up {{to the exclusion of}} everything else, which has been called a train of fantasy and {{has been described as a}} form of tunnel vision where the individual is more aware of an individual element of meaning, emotion etc. There seems to be a certain unity <b>of</b> <b>attention</b> while normally attention relies on multiple channels. <b>Flights</b> <b>of</b> fantasy and dreaming, including perceiving connections and associations of ideas that do not seem accessible in a normal state are often reported.|$|R
