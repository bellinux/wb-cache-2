500|$|Of {{literary}} figures {{after the}} Lake Poets among those most {{closely associated with}} Keswick was the novelist Hugh Walpole. In 1924 he moved into Brackenburn, a house between Keswick and Grange {{at the opposite end}} of Derwentwater. Like the Lake Poets in the previous century, he wrote enthusiastically about the Lake District, and its scenery and atmosphere often found their way into his fiction. He wrote in 1939, [...] "That I love Cumberland with all my heart and soul is another reason for my pleasure in writing these Herries books. That I wasn't born a Cumbrian isn't my fault: that Cumbrians, <b>in</b> <b>spite</b> <b>of</b> <b>my</b> 'foreignness', have been so kind to me, is my good fortune." ...|$|E
500|$|Monet {{submitted}} The Magpie and Fishing Boats at Sea (W 126) to the Salon of 1869. Both {{paintings were}} rejected in April. Critic Paul Richard {{said that the}} jurors rejected the painting as [...] "too common and too coarse". Monet's experimental use of color and radical departure from the descriptive, academic style surprised the public and probably contributed to its dismissal by the jury. Monet told French novelist Arsène Houssaye (18151896), [...] "This rejection has taken the bread from my mouth, and <b>in</b> <b>spite</b> <b>of</b> <b>my</b> low prices, collectors and dealers turn their backs on me." [...] A century later, The Magpie was acquired by the Musée d'Orsay in 1984. It {{became one of the}} most popular paintings in their permanent collection.|$|E
500|$|In {{order to}} {{encourage}} the captains of the merchant ships of all countries which carry the lifeblood of the U.K., I {{made it a point}} to attend the briefing conference of all captains and chief engineers before their departure. During the winter of '42–'43, when sinkings were at their worst, I could see when I told them of the measures by escort and air cover that were being taken for their protection and safety; I could see that they knew very well and that they knew I knew <b>in</b> <b>spite</b> <b>of</b> <b>my</b> brave words, that anything up to 25 per cent of them would probably not arrive in the U.K. in their own ships, and that probably half of that number would not arrive in the U.K. at all. But there was never a waver in their resolve – Admiral Murray.|$|E

2500|$|On {{reaching}} Mulhouse, Seel {{realized that}} he would have to lie about his true story and, like all the others, lie about the reasons for his deportation. [...] "I was already starting to censor my memories, and I became aware that, <b>in</b> <b>spite</b> <b>of</b> <b>my</b> expectations, in spite of all I had imagined, of the long-awaited joy of returning, the true Liberation, was for other people." ...|$|E
2500|$|Josephine thought Johnny’s {{marriage}} {{proposal was}} a good excuse to leave home again. She wrote, [...] "life was dull for me in San Francisco. <b>In</b> <b>spite</b> <b>of</b> <b>my</b> bad experience {{of a few years}} ago the call to adventure still stirred my blood." [...] Considering that Josephine reported in later life at having first arrived with the Markham Troupe on December 1, 1879, and that Josephine joined Behan in Tombstone that same year, her reference to [...] "my bad experience of a few years ago" [...] means she must have been in Arizona for some time before 1879.|$|E

2500|$|Nel Noddings {{draws an}} {{important}} distinction between natural caring and ethical caring (1984, 81-83). Noddings distinguishes between acting because [...] "I want" [...] and acting because [...] "I must". When I care for someone because [...] "I want" [...] to care, say I hug a friend who needs hugging {{in an act of}} love, Noddings claims that I am engaged in natural caring. When I care for someone because [...] "I must" [...] care, say I hug an acquaintance who needs hugging <b>in</b> <b>spite</b> <b>of</b> <b>my</b> desire to escape that person's pain, according to Noddings, I am engaged in ethical caring. Ethical caring occurs when a person acts caringly out of a belief that caring is the appropriate way of relating to people. When someone acts in a caring way because that person naturally cares for another, the caring is not ethical caring (1984, 79-80). Noddings' claims that ethical caring is based on, and so dependent on, natural caring (1984, 83, 206 fn 4). It is through experiencing others caring for them and naturally caring for others that people build what is called an [...] "ethical ideal", an image of the kind of person they want to be.|$|E

60|$|Strange to say, <b>in</b> <b>spite</b> <b>of</b> everything, <b>my</b> sleep {{refreshed}} me. I {{woke up in}} {{the morning}} strong and vigorous--thank goodness, I have physically a magnificent constitution--and packed my box, with Jane's help, for my Torquay expedition.|$|R
