50|$|At 7:30pm EST on July 16, a two car {{collision}} {{between a}} Volkswagen Passat and an Acura occurred {{three-quarters of the}} way inside the eastbound tunnel, which travels from Hampton to Norfolk. The Acura was rear ended by the Passat which in turn caused both vehicles {{to burst into flames}} and fill the tunnel with smoke, leaving 35 vehicles stuck inside the tunnel behind the scene. Because neither of the tunnels have <b>escape</b> <b>walkways,</b> 80 drivers and passengers were required to walk out of the tunnel through the smoke, leaving their vehicles behind. Fifteen people were treated on the scene for smoke inhalation, while four others were taken to the hospital. The fires caused moderate to major damage to the walls of the tunnel, which VDOT will repair through nightly road work at the tunnel.|$|E
50|$|In {{revenge for}} the {{rejection}} by Julian's family, John throws {{a pair of}} football boots full of fireworks {{through the dining room}} window while they are eating. He then visits a social club, where members of the Car-D gang eject two members of rival gang The Krew. Returning, they hurl a bicycle through the function room window, urging the Car-D to give chase up to the edge of their territory where they <b>escape</b> via a <b>walkway.</b> John gives chase, running into an ambush and is in turn chased by The Krew and pursued by their leader. Escaping by pushing his way into an Irish woman's home, John evades the rival gang. It emerges later that she is the mother of the boy who hurled the bicycle.|$|R
