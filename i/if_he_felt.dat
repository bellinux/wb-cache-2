5|$|In {{his closing}} word, Blythe {{said that he}} did not wish to avoid any {{responsibility}} and that <b>if</b> <b>he</b> <b>felt</b> guilty he would have pleaded so. He further commented that in case of acquittal, measures would be undertaken to avoid anything similar from happening at Lamb of God concerts again.|$|E
5|$|After the {{founding}} of Night School Studio, the team set up a casting call for voice actors on Backstage. Prior to actors being cast and their lines recorded, the team had placeholder subtitles in the game. Lead engineer Bryant Cannon recalled that without the voices, he was unsure whether the game {{would be fun to}} play; after the voices were added, he could see the characters as believable people having conversations. Hines directed recording sessions, allowing him to change dialogue on-the-fly <b>if</b> <b>he</b> <b>felt</b> material did not work when voiced by the actors. All of the actors voiced their lines separately, with their conversations in-game stitched together in post-production.|$|E
5|$|In {{response}} to a request from Vice Admiral Robert L. Ghormley, the American commander of the South Pacific Area, the 3rd Division moved to New Caledonia on garrison duty while the American forces previously stationed there fought in the Battle of Guadalcanal. Conscious that his division was the only sizable non-American unit in a theatre of operations having an overall American command structure, Barrowclough requested, and received, a charter {{that allowed him to}} seek instructions from the New Zealand Government <b>if</b> <b>he</b> <b>felt</b> the division was to be involved in operations that could result in significant casualties.|$|E

'Op it with me, guvnor, or get inside there." ...|$|R
60|$|Winston {{nodded as}} he went on, {{wondering}} with a grim expectancy whether Courthorne had returned again. <b>If</b> <b>he</b> had, <b>he</b> <b>felt</b> in a mood for very direct speech with him. His visitor was, however, not Courthorne. Winston could see that at a glance, although the room was dim.|$|R
5|$|Keith Park, with {{endorsement}} from Dowding, {{opted for}} the opposite strategy. Park maintained that it was unimportant to inflict large losses on the Germans in comparison to safeguarding his own forces. Park believed the Germans would give up if they could not achieve their aim of air superiority. This, simply put, meant avoiding the destruction and or depletion of Fighter Command was the primary factor in air defence. This would be achieved by sending small numbers of fighters to intercept, minimising losses in the air. By remaining to offer undiminished and constant air opposition, the RAF ensured the Luftwaffe could not win. As long {{as some sort of}} cost was imposed before the enemy dropped his bombs and impaired the defence system, the RAF could remain intact to meet the threat again the next day. To this end, Park favoured the 10 bomber kills before the attack, rather than the 50 shot down after it. The strategy suggested an enemy would give up <b>if</b> <b>he</b> <b>felt</b> he was getting nowhere. For even while his losses remained moderate, it would be senseless to suffer those casualties for no return. Park and Dowding's strategy, under the circumstances, was the wiser choice.|$|E
25|$|As a {{teenager}} and an army cadet, Gordon {{was known for his}} high spirits, a combative streak and tendency to disregard authority and the rules <b>if</b> <b>he</b> <b>felt</b> them to be stupid or unjust, a personality trait that held back his graduation by two years when teachers decided to punish him for flouting the rules.|$|E
25|$|As an officer, Gordon showed strong {{charisma}} and leadership, but his superiors distrusted him {{on account of}} his tendency to disobey orders <b>if</b> <b>he</b> <b>felt</b> them to be wrong or unjust. A man medium of stature, but with striking blue eyes, the charismatic Gordon had the ability to inspire men to follow him anywhere.|$|E

25|$|However, {{even with}} such formality, Daly was not above trading bon mots with the panelists during the game, and Cerf would often {{attempt to make}} a pun of his name. Occasionally Daly would amiably one-up Cerf <b>if</b> <b>he</b> <b>felt</b> the pun was of lesser quality. Cerf also played a myriad of games with Daly's full name, John Charles Patrick Croghan Daly, reciting it {{correctly}} {{only a handful of}} times {{over the course of the}} series.|$|E
25|$|The inquisitorial trial {{generally}} {{favored the}} prosecution (the Church). Confessing 'in full' {{was the best}} hope of receiving a lighter punishment - but with little hope of escaping at least some punishment. And a 'full' confession was one which implicated others, including other family members. It was acceptable to take testimony from criminals, persons of bad reputation, excommunicated people, and convicted heretics. The inquisitor could keep a defendant in prison for years before the trial to obtain new information, and could return them to prison <b>if</b> <b>he</b> <b>felt</b> that the witness had not fully confessed.|$|E
25|$|A {{few days}} after Devlin arrived in Nyasaland, Armitage {{received}} advice from the Colonial Office on the action to be followed when a governor dissented from {{the findings of a}} Commission of Inquiry, and was told that he could dissent <b>if</b> <b>he</b> <b>felt</b> it was justified. At the end of May, Armitage thought the commission were satisfied that the State of Emergency was necessary, but that it did not accept that there was a massacre plan, and had concentrated on the use of firearms and the burning of houses by government forces, ignoring events leading up to such incidents. He suspected that the Commission's report would be highly critical.|$|E

25|$|Other computer-generated {{imagery in}} the film {{includes}} the ant coming out of Dae-su's arm (according to the making-of on the DVD the whole arm was CGI) and the ants crawling over him afterwards. The octopus being eaten alive was not computer-generated; four were used during the making of this scene. Actor Choi Min-sik, a Buddhist, said a prayer for each one. The eating of squirming octopuses (called san-nakji (산낙지) in Korean) as a delicacy exists in East Asia, although it is usually killed and cut, not eaten whole and alive. Usually, it is the nerve activity in the octopus' tentacles makes the pieces still squirming posthumously on the plate when served. When asked in DVD commentary <b>if</b> <b>he</b> <b>felt</b> sorry for Choi, director Park Chan-wook stated he felt more sorry for the octopus.|$|E
25|$|Despite his amnesia, the Doctor {{retained}} a wide general knowledge. However, he also showed an uncharacteristic callous streak, easily allowing others to die <b>if</b> <b>he</b> <b>felt</b> that they 'deserved' to perish (The Burning). To contrast, {{he was capable}} of feeling unusually poignant warmth, even dating a woman in the 1980s, and adopting a young girl named Miranda, a Time Lady from the future (Father Time). During this time, he often became involved in strange problems outside the norm, such as confronting an entity that was essentially sentient fire (The Burning). He experienced a particular funk in the 1950s, feeling that his efforts to learn about his past were pointless, but his interest in life was re-inspired when he was recruited to defeat his old enemies the Players as they sought to escalate the Cold War (Endgame).|$|E
25|$|Justice Edmund Pendleton of the Virginia Supreme Court of Appeals died on October 23, 1803, and on January 6, 1804, the Virginia Assembly {{appointed}} Tucker to {{the state}} Supreme Court of Appeals (known since 1970 as the Virginia Supreme Court), choosing him over Archibald Stuart of Staunton {{by a vote of}} 115-82. By this time, Tucker was known for writing extremely thorough opinions that analyzed numerous angles on every issue involved in the case; however, unlike many of his colleagues on the Court of Appeals, he would not deliver his opinions in seriatim <b>if</b> <b>he</b> <b>felt</b> a single, unified court opinion would do. In 1808, Tucker crafted another piece of proposed legislation that would have greatly reduced the number of mandatory appeals a party was entitled to, both in an effort to reduce the Court of Appeals's caseload and to curtail what Tucker saw as pointless delay tactics by parties that only served to clog the court system. The Virginia Assembly rejected this proposal, along with Tucker's idea of splitting the Court of Appeals into legal and chancery divisions.|$|E

5000|$|Whether Norie-Miller {{simply did}} not take to {{political}} life, or found it clashed too greatly with his business responsibilities or <b>if</b> <b>he</b> just <b>felt</b> <b>he</b> was too old at 76 to give Parliament its proper attention, {{he decided not to}} contest the 1935 general election in November that year.|$|R
60|$|Walter <b>felt</b> <b>he</b> {{must not}} dispute the command--a {{glance at his}} Uncle would have {{determined}} him <b>if</b> <b>he</b> had <b>felt</b> otherwise--and disappeared to execute it.

500|$|Hasselbaink {{is one of}} disproportionately {{few black}} {{football}} managers in England. After being hired by QPR, he was asked by Talksport <b>if</b> <b>he</b> <b>felt</b> that he had added responsibilities as a black manager, to which he answered: ...|$|E
500|$|In January 1993, Gilmour, Mason and Wright began improvising new {{material}} in sessions at the remodelled Britannia Row Studios. They recruited bassist Guy Pratt; according to Mason, [...] "an interesting phenomenon occurred, {{which was that}} Pratt's playing tended to change {{the mood of the}} music we had created on our own". Without the legal problems experienced during production of their 1987 album, A Momentary Lapse of Reason, Gilmour was at ease; <b>if</b> <b>he</b> <b>felt</b> the band were [...] "getting somewhere", he would record them on a two-track DAT recorder. At one point Gilmour surreptitiously recorded Wright playing, capturing material which formed the basis for three pieces of music.|$|E

50|$|Better sides than Bing {{has made}} in a long while. Sounds <b>if</b> <b>he</b> {{actually}} <b>felt</b> like singing. In 'Style' it's mostly his engaging half-singing manner that sneaks him through the by now apparent faults in his upper tones - and it's a square dance too.|$|R
6000|$|That night Hartley said: [...] "Well, pardner, we're getting 'most {{ready to}} pull out. Someways I always get restless when these warm days begin."

500|$|Morton went {{to great}} lengths to ensure that Indiana contributed as much as {{possible}} to the war effort. He was not afraid to criticize others <b>if</b> <b>he</b> <b>felt</b> Indiana's interests were being overlooked. Morton frequently clashed with federal authorities and military leaders over recruitment policies, regimental assignments, appointment of military leaders, purchases of supplies, and the care given to sick and wounded soldiers, among other issues. Although he wanted Indiana to receive as much recognition as other states, Morton's political opponents often challenged his efforts. Governor Morton once complained to Lincoln that [...] "no other free state is so populated with southerners", which he believed kept him from being as forceful as he wanted to be.|$|E
500|$|On {{his return}} from Rome in 1170 {{he may have been}} {{commissioned}} by Amalric to write a history of the kingdom. He also became the tutor of Amalric's son and heir, Baldwin IV. When Baldwin was thirteen years old, he was playing with some children, who were trying to cause each other pain by scratching each other's arms. [...] "The other boys gave evidence of pain by their outcries," [...] wrote William, [...] "but Baldwin, although his comrades did not spare him, endured it altogether too patiently, as <b>if</b> <b>he</b> <b>felt</b> nothing...It is impossible to refrain from tears while speaking of this great misfortune." [...] William inspected Baldwin's arms and recognized the possible symptoms of leprosy, which was confirmed as Baldwin grew older.|$|E
500|$|In {{the spring}} of 1919, while {{recovering}} from a serious pulmonary condition, Cardus took up a suggestion from his news editor, William Percival Crozier, that he should watch some cricket at Old Trafford and, <b>if</b> <b>he</b> <b>felt</b> able, write reports on a few matches. On 19 May 1919 Cardus went to {{the first day of}} Lancashire's match with Derbyshire. His first published cricket report, on the following day, showed little sign of his later characteristic style: [...] "I simply had no intention of writing on cricket for any length of time; this was a spare-time affair... and I fitted myself into the idioms and procedures of the sporting writers of 1919". Scott nonetheless saw a potential, and from the beginning of 1920 Cardus became the paper's regular cricket correspondent, under the by-line [...] "Cricketer", a position he held for 20 years.|$|E
