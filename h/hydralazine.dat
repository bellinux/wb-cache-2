25|$|A {{predisposing factor}} to {{developing}} DIL is N-acetylation speed, or {{the rate at}} which the body can metabolize the drug. This is greatly decreased in patients with a genetic deficiency of the enzyme N-acetyltransferase. A study showed that 29 of 30 patients with DIL were slow acetylators. In addition, these patients had more <b>hydralazine</b> metabolites in their urine than fast acetylators. These metabolites (byproducts of the interactions between the drug and constituents in the body) of <b>hydralazine</b> are said to have been created when white blood cells have been activated, meaning they are stimulated to produce a respiratory burst. Respiratory burst in white blood cells induces an increased production of free radicals and oxidants such as hydrogen peroxide. These oxidants have been found to react with <b>hydralazine</b> to produce a reactive species that is able to bond to protein. Monocytes, one type of white blood cell, detect the antigen and relay the recognition to T helper cells, creating antinuclear antibodies leading to an immune response. Further studies on the interactions between oxidants and <b>hydralazine</b> are necessary to understand the processes involved in DIL.|$|E
25|$|Anti-Histone {{antibodies}} {{are positive}} {{in up to}} 95% of patients with drug induced lupus. DIThe most common medications associated with drug induced lupus are <b>hydralazine,</b> procainamide, isoniazid, methyldopa, chlorpromazine, quinidine, and minocycline.|$|E
25|$|In some {{countries}} reserpine is still available {{as part of}} combination drugs {{for the treatment of}} hypertension, in most cases they contain also a diuretic and/or a vasodilator like <b>hydralazine.</b> These combinations are currently regarded as second choice drugs.|$|E
25|$|Drug-induced lupus {{erythematosus}} is a (generally) reversible condition that usually occurs in people {{being treated for}} a long-term illness. Drug-induced lupus mimics SLE. However, symptoms of drug-induced lupus generally disappear once the medication that triggered the episode is stopped. More than 38 medications can cause this condition, {{the most common of}} which are procainamide, isoniazid, <b>hydralazine,</b> quinidine, and phenytoin.|$|E
25|$|Medical therapy {{of chronic}} aortic {{insufficiency}} that is stable and asymptomatic {{involves the use}} of vasodilators. Trials have shown a short term benefit in the use of ACE inhibitors or angiotensin II receptor antagonists, nifedipine, and <b>hydralazine</b> in improving left ventricular wall stress, ejection fraction, and mass. The goal in using these pharmacologic agents is to decrease the afterload so that the left ventricle is somewhat spared. The regurgitant fraction may not change significantly, since the gradient between the aortic and left ventricular pressures is usually fairly low at the initiation of treatment. Other rather conservative medical treatments for stable and asymptomatic cases include low sodium diet, diuretics, digoxin, calcium blockers and avoiding very strenuous activity.|$|E
25|$|Autoimmune {{hepatitis}} is {{a chronic}} disease {{caused by an}} abnormal immune response against liver cells. The disease {{is thought to have}} a genetic predisposition as it is associated with certain human leukocyte antigens involved in the immune response. As in other autoimmune diseases, circulating auto-antibodies may be present and are helpful in diagnosis. Auto-antibodies found in patients with autoimmune hepatitis include the sensitive but less specific anti-nuclear antibody (ANA), smooth muscle antibody (SMA), and atypical perinuclear antineutrophil cytoplasmic antibody (p-ANCA). Other autoantibodies that are less common but more specific to autoimmune hepatitis are the antibodies against liver kidney microsome 1 (LKM1) and soluble liver antigen (SLA). Autoimmune hepatitis can also be triggered by drugs (such as nitrofurantoin, <b>hydralazine,</b> and methyldopa), after liver transplant, or by viruses (such as hepatitis A, Epstein-Barr virus, or measles).|$|E
500|$|Epigenetics is {{the study}} of small, usually heritable, {{molecular}} modifications—or [...] "tags"—that bind DNA and modify gene expression levels. Targeting these tags with drugs can kill cancer cells. Early-stage research in NSCLC using drugs aimed at epigenetic modifications shows that blocking more than one of these tags can kill cancer cells with fewer side effects. Studies also show that giving patients these drugs before standard treatment can improve its effectiveness. Clinical trials are underway to evaluate how well these drugs kill lung cancer cells in humans. Several drugs that target epigenetic mechanisms are in development. Histone deacetylase inhibitors in development include valproic acid, vorinostat, belinostat, panobinostat, entinostat, and romidepsin. DNA methyltransferase inhibitors in development include decitabine, azacytidine, and <b>hydralazine.</b>|$|E
2500|$|Of {{the drugs}} that cause DIL, <b>hydralazine</b> {{has been found to}} cause a higher incidence. <b>Hydralazine</b> is a {{medication}} used to treat high blood pressure. Approximately 5% of the patients who have taken <b>hydralazine</b> {{over long periods of time}} and in high doses have shown DIL-like symptoms. [...] Many of the other drugs have a low to very low risk to develop DIL. The following table shows the risk of development of DIL of some of these drugs on a very to high scale.|$|E
2500|$|ACE inhibitors, Adrenergic neurone blockers, Angiotensin II {{receptor}} antagonists, Beta blockers, Calcium channel blockers, Clonidine, Diazoxide, Diuretics, <b>Hydralazine,</b> Methyldopa, Minoxidil, Nitrates, Sodium Nitroprusside - enhanced hypotensive effect ...|$|E
2500|$|In 1952 {{researchers}} at Ciba discovered the first orally available vasodilator, <b>hydralazine.</b> [...] A major shortcoming of <b>hydralazine</b> monotherapy {{was that it}} lost its effectiveness over time (tachyphylaxis). [...] In the mid-1950s Karl H. Beyer, James M. Sprague, John E. Baer, and Frederick C. Novello of Merck and Co. discovered and developed chlorothiazide, which remains {{the most widely used}} antihypertensive drug today. This development was associated with a substantial decline in the mortality rate among people with hypertension. The inventors were recognized by a Public Health Lasker Award in 1975 for [...] "the saving of untold thousands of lives and the alleviation of the suffering of millions of victims of hypertension".|$|E
2500|$|Individuals {{with chronic}} MI {{can be treated}} with vasodilators as well to {{decrease}} afterload. In the chronic state, {{the most commonly used}} agents are ACE inhibitors and <b>hydralazine.</b> Studies have shown that the use of ACE inhibitors and <b>hydralazine</b> can delay surgical treatment of mitral insufficiency. The current guidelines for treatment of MI limit the use of vasodilators to individuals with hypertension, however. Any hypertension is treated aggressively, e.g. by diuretics and a low-sodium diet. In both hypertensive and normotensive cases, digoxin and antiarrhythmics are also indicated. Also, chronic anticoagulation is given where there is concomitant mitral valve prolapse or atrial fibrillation. [...] In general, medical therapy is non-curative and is used for mild-to-moderate regurgitation or in patients unable to tolerate surgery.|$|E
2500|$|Drug-induced lupus {{erythematosus}} (DIL or DILE) is an autoimmune disorder (similar to systemic {{lupus erythematosus}} [...] ) caused by chronic use of certain drugs. These drugs cause an autoimmune response (the body attacks its own cells) producing symptoms {{similar to those of}} SLE. There are 38 known medications to cause DIL but there are three that report the highest number of cases: [...] <b>hydralazine,</b> procainamide, and isoniazid. While the criteria for diagnosing DIL has not been thoroughly established, symptoms of DIL typically present as muscle pain and joint pain. Generally, the symptoms recede after discontinuing use of the drugs.|$|E
2500|$|The World Health Organization {{recommends}} {{that women with}} severe hypertension during pregnancy should receive treatment with anti-hypertensive agents. Severe hypertension is generally considered systolic BP of at least 160 or diastolic BP of at least 110. Evidence {{does not support the}} use of one anti-hypertensive over another. The choice of which agent to use should be based on the prescribing clinician's experience with a particular agent, its cost, and its availability. Diuretics are not recommended for prevention of preeclampsia and its complications. Labetolol, <b>Hydralazine</b> and Nifedipine are commonly used antihypertensive agents for hypertension in pregnancy. [...] ACE inhibitors and angiotensin receptor blockers are contraindicated as they affect fetal development.|$|E
2500|$|Subsequent {{pregnancy}} {{should be}} avoided when left ventricular function has not recovered and the EF is lower than 55%. [...] However, many women who have fully recovered from PPCM {{have gone on to}} have successful subsequent pregnancies. [...] A significant study reports that the risk for recurrence of heart failure in recovered PPCM patients as a result of subsequent pregnancy is approximately 21% or better. [...] The chance of relapse may be even smaller for those with normal contractile reserve as demonstrated by stress echocardiography. [...] In any subsequent pregnancy, careful monitoring is necessary. [...] Where relapse occurs, conventional treatment should be resumed, including <b>hydralazine</b> with nitrates plus beta-blockers during pregnancy, or ACE-inhibitors plus beta-blockers following pregnancy.|$|E
2500|$|Treatment for PPCM {{is similar}} to {{treatment}} for congestive heart failure. Conventional heart failure treatment includes the use of diuretics, beta blockers (B-B), and angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors (ACE-I) after delivery. [...] Diuretics, preferably furosemide, help the body {{to get rid of}} excess water weight and also lower blood pressure. [...] ACE-I and B-B improve blood circulation and contribute to the reversal of the immune system dysfunction associated with PPCM. [...] If ACE-I is not well tolerated by the patient, it can be replaced by angiotensin receptor blockers (ARB). [...] <b>Hydralazine</b> with nitrates may replace ACE-I in breastfeeding mothers or before delivery; however, evidence suggests that this course of treatment may not be as effective as ACE-I but beneficial when necessary.|$|E
2500|$|The {{condition}} is diagnosed {{based on the}} history of the symptoms and a physical examination with confirmation by echocardiography. Blood tests, electrocardiography, and chest radiography may be useful to determine the underlying cause. Treatment depends on the severity and cause of the disease. In people with chronic stable mild heart failure, treatment commonly consists of lifestyle modifications such as stopping smoking, physical exercise, and dietary changes, as well as medications. In those with heart failure due to left ventricular dysfunction, angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitors [...] or angiotensin receptor blockers along with beta blockers are recommended. For those with severe disease, aldosterone antagonists, or <b>hydralazine</b> with a nitrate may be used. Diuretics are useful for preventing fluid retention. Sometimes, depending on the cause, an implanted device such as a pacemaker or an implantable cardiac defibrillator may be recommended. In some moderate or severe cases cardiac resynchronization therapy (CRT) may be suggested ...|$|E
50|$|Drugs {{subject to}} a strong first-pass effect such as β-blockers may {{increase}} the bioavailability of <b>hydralazine.</b> Epinephrine (adrenaline)'s heart rate-accelerating effects are increased by <b>hydralazine,</b> hence may lead to toxicity.|$|E
50|$|<b>Hydralazine</b> is used {{to treat}} severe hypertension, but again, {{it is not a}} {{first-line}} therapy for essential hypertension. However, <b>hydralazine</b> is the first-line therapy for hypertension in pregnancy, with methyldopa.|$|E
50|$|<b>Hydralazine</b> {{belongs to}} the hydrazinophthalazine class of drugs.|$|E
50|$|<b>Hydralazine</b> is {{not used}} as a primary drug for {{treating}} hypertension because it elicits a reflex sympathetic stimulation of the heart (the baroreceptor reflex). The sympathetic stimulation may increase heart rate and cardiac output, and in people with coronary artery disease may cause angina pectoris or myocardial infarction. <b>Hydralazine</b> may also increase plasma renin concentration, resulting in fluid retention. To prevent these undesirable side effects, <b>hydralazine</b> is usually prescribed in combination with a β-blocker (e.g., propranolol) and a diuretic. Beta-blockers licensed to treat heart failure in the UK include bisoprolol, carvedilol, and nebivolol.|$|E
