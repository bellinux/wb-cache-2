50|$|Vladimír Hirsch (born July 3, 1954) is a Czech composer, instrumentalist (pianist, organist, {{keyboard}} player, vocalist), {{and sound}} experimenter, integrating industrial and dark ambient music with modern classical composition with a genre overlap conception. His compositional style {{is characterized by}} polymodal architectonics, polytonality and the usage of <b>digital</b> <b>technique</b> to enhance sonic means of expression, where modern classical elements fuse within experimental soundscapes. Besides creating solo works, he is the co-founder and main personality of the band Skrol, the duo Aghiatrias and various other projects (e.g. Zygote, Subpop Squeeze, Luminar Ax, and Tiria). His music {{is marked by a}} dark, tense and tempestuous atmosphere. Between 1986 and 1995 he was member of experimental post-punk group Der Marabu.|$|E
50|$|A <b>digital</b> <b>technique</b> for {{high-speed}} {{visualization of}} vibration, called videokymography, {{was developed and}} applied to the vocal folds. The system uses a modified video camera able to work in two modes: high-speed (nearly 8,000 images/s) and standard (50 images/s in CCIR norm). In the high-speed mode, the camera selects one active horizontal line (transverse to the glottis) from the whole laryngeal image. The successive line images are presented in real time on a commercial TV monitor, filling each video frame from top to bottom. The system {{makes it possible to}} observe left-right asymmetries, open quotient, propagation of mucosal waves, movement of the upper and, in the closing phase, the lower margins of the vocal folds, etc. The technique is suitable for further processing and quantification of recorded vibration.|$|E
5000|$|Stamaty's piano {{technique}} {{has its roots}} in the piano manufacturing craft of the first decades of the 19th century. Most pianos manufactured in France before 1850 had a light action and an easy touch. These pianos were ideal for the execution of rapid scales, facile arpeggios and quickly repeated notes. This resulted in an elegant and glittering bravura playing ideally suited for salons and smaller venues. Stamaty's piano technique was firmly rooted in the pre-Steinway area of those pianos built according to the old system (wooden frame). Marmontel clearly states that Stamaty was a pianist of style but was no transcendental virtuoso and that his playing lacked warmth, colour and brilliance. Stamaty's method prescribed complete immobility of body and arms, elbows tucked into the body and all action of the muscles limited to finger and forearms. Saint-Saëns who during his long life had witnessed the development from the old purely <b>digital</b> <b>technique</b> to the transcendental virtuosity of Franz Liszt, Anton Rubinstein and even Leopold Godowsky sums up the advantages and the drawbacks of the Kalkbrenner-Stamaty school like this: ...|$|E

50|$|Ray Caesar {{has become}} one of the most {{recognised}} representatives of pop surrealism and his haunting imagery is digitally created using 3D modelling software called Maya, mastered while working in digital animation for television and film industries from 1998-2001. Absolute master of this <b>digital</b> <b>technique</b> he is a reference point to all the artists who face this artistic discipline. Through this program, he builds digital models with invisible skeletons and anatomical joints that can be bent and manipulated to assume any pose. He wraps the models in rich textures, adding hair, skin, eyelashes and fingernails. Then places them in digitally lit, impeccably detailed 3D environments built with architectural layers, windows, wallpapers, curtains and furnishings. Caesar’s meticulous process incorporates elements of drawing, painting, collage and sculpture, working countless hours to achieve every remarkably intricate tableau. Further emphasizing his sculptural technique, Caesar compares his process of 2D printmaking with imagery created in 3D as being similar to the practice of capturing stills from video and film. With full control over dressing, posing and lighting his figures as well as every element of their surroundings, Caesar’s craft is an advanced extension of a childhood obsession-playing with dolls. Fantasy, escapism, human cruelty and disguise are reoccurring themes explored within his dramatic narratives. Betraying the seemingly childlike innocence of the figures is their piercing, knowing gaze-exposing inner strength in contrast with their fragile physical appearance. Dark details manifest from deep within the artist’s vast imagination to define simulated realities, transporting the viewer into sanctuaries created for his lost ghost-children who emerge from shadows into safe refuge, carrying macabre secrets and hidden truths.|$|E

40|$|This {{research}} is aimed {{to produce an}} online teaching model for <b>digital</b> <b>technique</b> and its supporting instrument, and to determine the feasibility and the learning impact of the developed model, {{so that it can}} be used to assist the lecturers of Electrical Engineering Department and other related departments in conducting flexible and low cost practicum. This research was conducted through development steps consisting of preliminary study, planning, preliminary product development, preliminary test, main product revision, field test, final product revision and product dissemination. The product was tested by some experts of learning multimedia, digital engineering, e-learning and instructional design. To find out the validity of the developed hypothetical model, a Delphi technique was used based on the consensus accepted by the experts. The consensus included the aspects of (1) identification of the problem through a needs analysis, (2) determination of priority (type and products manufacture), (3) determination of program objectives, and (4) determination of the problem solution. The next step was tryout of the model to 10 instructors and 25 students of the Electrical Engineering Department. This test was used to determine the learning impact and the subjects’ perception of the implementation of the products in a practical activity. The final consensus of the validity obtained from the experts and the perception of the subjects of the research was analyzed using the percentage method. Meanwhile, the determination of learning impact was done using the different average scores of the subjects. This research has developed an online teaching model and its supporting resources for <b>digital</b> <b>technique</b> practicum. This result could be implemented with more flexible and low cost to support the practicum in higher education. The learning resources obtained are the Virtual Laboratory Portal ([URL] A Manual for an Online Learning Model for Practicum, Lessons Plan for <b>Digital</b> <b>Technique,</b> <b>Digital</b> <b>Technique</b> Textbook, A Manual for Breadboard Simulator, A Manual for Online Practicum for Lecturers/Instructors/Students, and A Manual for <b>Digital</b> <b>Technique</b> Practicum with the guided inquiry method. This research has also proven that the developed product has a positive impact on learning, i. e. it can improve the students’ learning achievement significantly. The products also get good perception from the subjects in relation to the instructional and performance aspects...|$|E

40|$|The Proseal TM {{laryngeal}} mask airway (PLMA TM, Laryngeal Mask Company, UK) {{was designed to}} improve ventilatory characteristics and offer protection against regurgitation and gastric insufflation. The PLMA is a modified {{laryngeal mask}} airway with large ventral cuff, dorsal cuff and a drain tube. These modifications improve seal around glottis and enable better ventilatory characteristics. The drain tube prevents gastric distension and offers protection against aspiration. There were occasional problems, like failed insertion and inadequate ventilation, in placing PLMA TM using the classical <b>digital</b> <b>technique.</b> To overcome these problems, newer placement techniques like thumb insertion technique, introducer tool placement and gum elastic bougie (GEB) -aided placement were devised. We compared classical digital placement of PLMA TM with gum elastic bougie-aided technique in 60 anaesthetised adult patients (with 30 patients in each group) with respect to number of attempts to successful placement, effective airway time, airway trauma during insertion, postoperative airway morbidity and haemodynamic response to insertion. The number of attempts to successful placement, airway trauma during insertion and haemodynamic response to insertion were comparable among the two groups, while effective airway time and oropharyngeal leak pressure were significantly higher in bougie- guided insertion of PLMA. Postoperatively, sore throat was more frequent with <b>digital</b> <b>technique</b> while dysphagia was more frequent with bougie-guided technique. Hence gum elastic bougie guided, laryngoscope aided insertion of PLMA is an excellent alternate to classical <b>digital</b> <b>technique...</b>|$|E
