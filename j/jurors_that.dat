5|$|In Salinas, Genevevo Salinas of Houston had voluntarily gone to {{a police}} station when {{officers}} asked him to accompany them {{to talk about the}} murder of two men. Salinas answered most of the officers' questions, but simply remained silent when they asked him whether shotgun casings found {{at the scene of the}} murders would match his gun. He shifted his feet, and otherwise acted nervously, but did not say anything. Later, at his trial, prosecutors told <b>jurors</b> <b>that</b> his silence in the face of that question showed that he was guilty, that he knew that the shotgun used to kill the victims was his. Salinas' lawyer wanted the Supreme Court to rule that the simple fact of silence during police questioning, when an individual was not under arrest, could not be used against that person at a criminal trial.|$|E
5|$|The federal jury convicted Cisneros of {{the murder}} on May 12 after three hours of deliberation. The {{prosecution}} introduced witnesses, including the motel manager and those at the crime scene, who stated that they saw a white car driven by the suspected assassins coming from Mexico {{the day before the}} shooting. The defense told the <b>jurors</b> <b>that</b> there was not enough evidence to uphold the conviction under federal requirements of reasonable doubt. The government concluded that it met the burden of proof for interstate or foreign commerce charges in two ways: through Garza's phone calls from Mexico, and through the matching license plates of the Mexican car that crossed into the U.S. and registered at the motel, which matched the description of the vehicle seen at the murder scene. In order to find Cisneros guilty, they were not required to prove that she intended to use interstate or foreign commerce, or even that she knew it would be used. They were required to prove that someone involved in Fischer's murder used interstate or foreign commerce or caused another person to use it. On July 27, the jury rendered their final verdict and sentenced Cisneros to life in prison. Two years later, the United States Attorney Office recognized two local police officers and three FBI agents for assisting in her prosecution.|$|E
25|$|Judge Zagel {{advised the}} <b>jurors</b> <b>that</b> {{they could find}} the former {{governor}} guilty on some (perhaps lesser) charges while finding him not guilty of others. The judge scheduled a hearing so that he, the defendants and their defense team, and prosecutors could receive further clarification on the matter. He also forbade both sides from discussing the matter further until it has been clarified and resolved.|$|E

50|$|In 1915, Moorer and Nathaniel J. Frederick {{represented}} Bogus Sanders in {{a murder}} trial in Columbia. Sanders was found guilty by the all-white jury, but the conviction was thrown out on appeal by the State appellate court due to an admission by a <b>juror</b> <b>that</b> he was prejudiced against black lawyers.|$|R

25|$|In {{his earlier}} testimony, George Anthony denied the affair with Holloway {{and said he}} visited her only because she was ill. He said he sent the text message because he needed {{everyone}} who had helped in his life. After Holloway's testimony, Judge Perry told <b>jurors</b> <b>that</b> {{it could be used}} to impeach George Anthony's credibility, but that it was not proof of how Caylee died and/or evidence of Casey Anthony's guilt or innocence.|$|E
25|$|Unable {{to find an}} {{impartial}} jury in Letcher County, the trial was moved to Harlan County, where it was held in March 1968. The prosecution was led by Commonwealth's Attorney Daniel Boone Smith, who recalled that even in Harlan County it was assumed he would not push too hard for Ison's conviction, since many locals approached him to express sympathy for Ison. Boone said his task was to convince the <b>jurors</b> <b>that</b> O'Connor and his crew were respectable {{people who had been}} commissioned by the United States Government to make a film about the entire United States, and that the Kentucky shots would only be briefly featured.|$|E
25|$|On 1 May 2007, {{a series}} of raids—Operation Achilles—took place against SHAC in Europe, {{involving}} 700 police officers in England, Amsterdam, and Belgium. Thirty-two people were arrested, including Greg and Natasha Avery, and Heather Nicholson, who were charged with blackmail, along with nine others. The Averys pleaded guilty in July 2008, along with a co-accused Dan Amos. In October 2008 Trevor Holmes, Gerrah Selby, Daniel Wadham, Gavin Medd-Hall, and Heather Nicholson, who denied the charges, were sent to court. Prosecutors told <b>jurors</b> <b>that</b> a 2007 meeting between the defendants had been bugged by police, and revealed that SHAC supported illegal acts that were traced to attacks on people across Great Britain. The prosecution also alleged there was evidence of direct email links between SHAC, the Animal Liberation Front, and Animal Rights Militia. Holmes was acquitted but the other four were convicted.|$|E
50|$|On December 1, 2009, the 12 <b>jurors</b> {{announced}} <b>that</b> {{they had}} failed to reach a unanimous verdict on all the charges and the judge declared a mistrial. Federal prosecutors have indicated {{that they will not}} seek another trial against Gotti. After the trial, <b>jurors</b> said <b>that</b> they did not find witnesses, particularly Alite, to be credible. Gotti, Federal Bureau of Prisons Register # 00632-748, was released on December 1, 2009.|$|R
5000|$|In June 2008, after a judge {{dismissed}} a juror, during deliberations in a [...] "gang murder" [...] trial, who {{was found}} to have falsely denied her gang affiliation on a jury selection questionnaire, San Mateo County Chief Deputy District Attorney Steve Wagstaffe said: [...] "It is our subjective opinion that she was a stealth <b>juror,</b> <b>that</b> she specifically wanted to be on this jury." [...] Juror dishonesty on questionnaires threatened the six-month-long federal corruption trial of former Illinois Governor George Ryan.|$|R
50|$|The first {{important}} {{paper on}} the findings of the CJP so far documents <b>that</b> <b>jurors</b> do not rely on expert testimony to evaluate the defendant's dangerousness but are influenced by expert testimony regarding the defendant's mental illness and mental instability. <b>Jurors</b> accept <b>that</b> mental health professionals have expertise on issues of mental illness and tend to accept expert testimony on the subject. However, expert testimony on the potential dangerousness of the defendant was not related to jury opinion. On these issue it appears <b>that</b> <b>jurors</b> rely on common sense since {{there is no evidence that}} experts of any kind can predict dangerousness and jurors disregard expert testimony accordingly.|$|R
500|$|At Gardner's {{commutation}} {{hearing on}} June 10, 2010, lawyers and medical experts {{in his defense}} argued whether meningitis contracted {{at the age of}} 4 had damaged his brain. Gardner had also huffed gas and glue with his siblings, and played with mercury stolen from gas meters by his stepfather to sell. Three of the <b>jurors</b> <b>that</b> sentenced Gardner to death signed an affidavit that they would have recommended life without parole, an option that was not available in Utah until 1992. Gardner claimed that he was a changed man who counseled other inmates and was interested in starting an organic farm project for youths on [...] in Box Elder County, Utah. Gardner's attorney presented a letter his client wrote to Oprah Winfrey requesting funds for the project. Gardner also argued that it was not justifiable to execute him after so much time had passed since the crime.|$|E
500|$|Diefenbaker {{suggested}} {{to the jury}} that the silence on the line which had, he contended, swallowed the words [...] "at Cedarside" [...] might {{have been caused by}} a fish dropped on a snow-covered line by a bird and claimed to have evidence of a previous occurrence. He noted in his memoirs that the incident [...] "was not well documented, but it was all we had". He blamed the disaster on Tisdale, stating that lack of the word [...] "at" [...] before [...] "Gosnell" [...] in the order indicated that the Kamloops dispatcher had not been paying attention, and that he should have noticed that, according to Diefenbaker, the words [...] "at Cedarside" [...] were missing from Atherton's repeat of the order. The trial had taken four days; the lawyers argued for five hours; Diefenbaker's summation took three of them. Justice McFarlane took an hour to charge the jury. McFarlane told the <b>jurors</b> <b>that</b> if they believed that Atherton had passed the order to conductor Mainprize in the same form he had received it, they would be justified in acquitting him. The jury returned after 40minutes of deliberations. Jury foreman Fred Mounkley announced the acquittal of Atherton, as Atherton's mother wept.|$|E
2500|$|Following the {{discovery}} process, the court granted Voom's motion for sanctions. The New York State Supreme Court found that EchoStar's Dish Network [...] "systematically destroyed evidence" [...] {{in the case}} and stated that “it is entirely possible that the documents destroyed by EchoStar demonstrated that EchoStar knew all along that there was no breach...and would prove Voom’s case.” The Judge also stated that he would tell <b>jurors</b> <b>that</b> Dish Network destroyed evidence and that the jury may assume the evidence would have been helpful to Voom’s case.|$|E

2500|$|By September about 150 fencers {{had been}} {{detained}} {{and sent to}} South Island jails and the adult male ranks at Parihaka were so depleted, the constabulary were often manhandling young boys and old men, whose fences were often only symbolic, consisting of sticks and branches. When a group of 59 Māori appeared in the District Court in New Plymouth on 23 September for trial on charges of having unlawfully obstructed the free passage of a thoroughfare, a jury of 12 settlers deliberated for 45 minutes before returning to say they could not agree on a verdict. Judge Shaw told the <b>jurors</b> <b>that</b> if they convicted the accused, he might choose to sentence them [...] "to only an hour's imprisonment" [...] and bind them over {{to keep the peace}} [...] "for only a nominal time". He told the <b>jurors</b> <b>that</b> if they did not produce a verdict within an hour he would lock them up for the night. They deliberated for just minutes before returning with a guilty verdict. The judge immediately sentenced the fencers to two years' imprisonment with hard labour at Lyttelton jail, plus a requirement for each to find a ₤50 surety to keep the peace for six months.|$|E
2500|$|Magnotta {{elected to}} be tried by judge and jury. He pleaded not guilty, admitting to the acts {{of which he was}} accused but {{claiming}} diminished responsibility due to mental disorders. Crown Attorney Louis Bouthillier made his opening statement on September 29, 2014. Quebec Superior Court Justice Guy Cournoyer presided over the trial, which lasted 10 weeks. On the opening day, he instructed <b>jurors</b> <b>that</b> Magnotta [...] "admits the acts or the conducts underlying the crime for which he is charged. Your task will be to determine whether he committed the five offences with the required state of mind for each offence." ...|$|E
2500|$|Kindlon's co-counsel {{and wife}} Laurie Shanks has also {{maintained}} that police overlooked {{the possibility that}} Peter Porco's death {{was the result of}} retaliation against his uncle Frank Porco, a captain in the Bonanno crime family in New York City. Frank Porco had served two years in prison for loansharking and extortion, although Shanks incorrectly told <b>jurors</b> <b>that</b> he had been indicted for his involvement in a murder. Shanks noted that Frank Porco's nickname with the mob was [...] "The Fireman", which could {{have had something to do}} with the type of murder weapon found, a fire ax. He had served in the New York City Fire Department.|$|E

2500|$|Judge Berman {{said that}} Ravi's [...] "'letter of apology' to the {{pre-sentence}} people" [...] was [...] "unimpressive" [...] and [...] "didn't even mention the seven cover-up charges". He {{said it was}} [...] "ironic" [...] that Ravi's letter [...] "doesn't mention M.B. as if he doesn't exist", yet M.B. had in his letter offered {{to write a letter}} to help Ravi avoid deportation. Ravi declined the opportunity to speak at the sentencing hearing and was reprimanded by Judge Berman for not having publicly apologized: [...] "I heard this jury say guilty 288 times—24 questions, 12 <b>jurors,</b> <b>that's</b> the multiplication. And I haven't heard you apologize once." ...|$|R
2500|$|In {{the closing}} {{argument}} for the defense, attorney Mickey Johnson argued that Cherry {{had nothing to do}} with the bombing, and reminded the <b>jurors</b> <b>that</b> his client was not on trial for his beliefs, stating: [...] "It seems like more time has been spent here throwing around the n-word than proving what happened in September 1963." [...] Johnson then reiterated that there was no hard evidence linking Cherry to the bombing, but only evidence attesting to his racist beliefs dating from that era, and that the family members who had testified against him were all estranged and therefore unreliable witnesses. Johnson then urged the jury not to convict his client via guilt by association.|$|E
2500|$|The {{defendant}} appealed {{his conviction}} to the Kentucky Supreme Court, which affirmed the conviction. That court cited Swain v. Alabama, and {{held that a}} defendant alleging lack of a fair cross section must demonstrate systematic exclusion {{of a group of}} jurors from the panel of prospective <b>jurors.</b> <b>That</b> is, the defendant had to show that not just in his case, but as a process, juries in his community were being constructed so as to not represent a cross section of that community. Batson continued his appeal to the U.S. Supreme Court, which granted certiorari to decide whether petitioner was tried [...] "in violation of constitutional provisions guaranteeing the defendant an impartial jury and a jury composed of persons representing a fair cross section of the community." ...|$|E
2500|$|The first witness {{called by}} the defense was Dr. James M. Martin, a physician. The defense posed to Dr. Martin a series of {{questions}} designed to establish doubt {{in the minds of the}} <b>jurors</b> <b>that</b> Celia, unassisted, could have killed Newsom and disposed of his body in the manner described by the prosecution. The defense asked: [...] "Could the body of a human being be destroyed by burning in a common fireplace from 10 o'clock pm to 4 o'clock am?" [...] The prosecution objected to this question, and Judge Hall sustained the objection. Twice the defense attempted to rephrase the question, but the prosecution objected each time, and Judge Hall sustained each objection, forcing the defense to abandon this line of questioning.|$|E
50|$|Of the 34 {{potential}} {{jurors in the}} case, only two owned handguns. They were not selected for the jury. Also not selected were two people who knew homicide victims, one whose relative is charged with a shooting of his girlfriend, a man who said a friend had been hit with a police officer's car in Los Angeles, {{and a woman who}} was a prior <b>juror</b> <b>that</b> acquitted the defendant in an attempted homicide case. None of the {{potential jurors}} said they had strong feelings about current gun rights debates or belonged to any gun rights or gun control advocacy groups. In total, seven men and five women served on the jury.|$|R
5000|$|Judge Berman {{said that}} Ravi's [...] "'letter of apology' to the {{pre-sentence}} people" [...] was [...] "unimpressive" [...] and [...] "didn't even mention the seven cover-up charges".

2500|$|In United States v. Moylan, , Fourth Circuit Court of Appeal {{unanimously}} ruled: [...] "If {{the jury}} {{feels that the}} law under which the defendant is accused is unjust, or exigent circumstances justified {{the actions of the}} accused, or for any reason which appeals to their logic or passion, the jury has the right to acquit, and the courts must abide that decision." [...] The Fully Informed Jury Association is a non-profit educational organization dedicated to informing jurors of their rights and seeking the passage of laws to require judges to inform <b>jurors</b> <b>that</b> they can and should judge the law. [...] In Sparf v. United States, , the Supreme Court, in a 5-4 decision, held that a trial judge has no responsibility to inform the jury of the right to nullify laws.|$|E
2500|$|Both {{prosecution}} and defense reiterated their themes in closing arguments. After showing the jury of eight women and four men photographs of a beaten, bloodied Rasmussen, prosecutor Paul Nunez told them, [...] "It wasn't a fair fight ... This was prey {{caught in a}} cage with a predator." [...] Overland dismissed the entire case as circumstantial [...] "fluff and fill", save for the [...] "compromised" [...] bite-mark DNA sample. He moved for a mistrial after Nunez reminded the <b>jurors</b> <b>that</b> no alibi had been provided for {{the time of the}} murder, since defendants' refusal to testify cannot be held against them, but Perry denied it, saying he did not take that as directly suggesting Lazarus herself had refused to testify and thus her Fifth Amendment right against self-incrimination had not been violated.|$|E
2500|$|On February 24, 2012, Assistant Prosecutor Julia McClure told <b>jurors</b> <b>that</b> Dharun Ravi {{acted to}} [...] "deprive" [...] Tyler Clementi of his [...] "privacy" [...] and [...] "dignity" [...] when he {{observed}} an intimate encounter of Clementi and later invited others {{to watch a}} second liaison of Clementi and his friend. Ravi's actions were not, she emphasized, a [...] "prank", [...] "accident", or [...] "mistake", but rather were [...] "intentional", [...] "planned", [...] "criminal", and [...] "mean-spirited". She said Ravi was motivated {{by the fact that}} Clementi was homosexual: [...] "he sought to brand Tyler as different from everybody else" [...] and [...] "to set him up for contempt." [...] Later, she explained, Ravi tried to [...] "cover up the tracks" [...] of his actions by altering evidence.|$|E
