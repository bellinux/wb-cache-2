The names of 24 states derive from {{indigenous}} languages of the Americas and one from Hawaiian: eight come from Algonquian languages, seven from Siouan languages (one of those by way of Illinois, an Algonquian language), three from Iroquoian languages, one from a Uto-Aztecan language, and five from other Native American languages.|$|E
5|$|There have {{probably}} been many such eruptions during Earth's history beyond those shown in these lists.

Even for the eruptions listed here, estimates of the volume erupted can be subject to considerable uncertainty.|$|E

5|$|Supermarkets {{continued}} to affect shopping patterns. In 1979 {{fruit and vegetable}} stalls occupied 70 of the market's 205 stalls; by 1988 greengrocers occupied only 28 stalls, and by 2010 there were only seven remaining fruit and vegetable stalls on the market. A wide variety of other stalls <b>have</b> <b>taken</b> <b>their</b> place, and the market remains active. One of the largest markets in Britain, it is a tourist attraction as well as remaining heavily used by local residents, and is a {{focal point of the}} city.|$|E
5|$|Vertical jumps (high {{jump and}} pole vault) set a bar at a {{particular}} height. The competitor must clear the bar without knocking it off the standards that are holding the bar (flat). Three failures in a row ends the competitor's participation in the event. The competitor has the option to PASS their attempt, {{which can be used}} to strategic advantage (of course that advantage is lost if the competitor misses). A pass could be used to save energy and avoid taking a jump that would not improve their position in the standings. After all competitors have either cleared, passed or failed their attempts at a height, the bar goes up. The amount the bar goes up is predetermined before the competition, though when one competitor remains, that competitor may choose their own heights for the remaining attempts. A record is kept of each attempt by each competitor. After all competitors <b>have</b> <b>taken</b> <b>their</b> attempts, the one jumping the highest is the winner, and so on down the other competitors in the event. Ties are broken by first, the number of attempts taken at the highest height (fewest wins), and then if still tied, {{by the total number of}} misses in the competition as a whole. The bar does not go back to a lower height except to break a tie for first place or a qualifying position. If those critical positions are still tied after applying the tiebreakers, all tied competitors take a fourth jump at the last height. If they still miss, the bar goes down one increment where they again jump. This process continues until the tie is broken.|$|E

25|$|Yankalilla lies inland on the Fleurieu Peninsula, a small {{protruding}} {{stretch of}} land {{south of the}} Adelaide Plains. It is situated in the valley carved by the Bungala River, which meets the sea at the coast {{not far from the}} town, at nearby Normanville. The natural vegetation is dominated by Eucalypts and other southern natives, although grasses and weeds <b>have</b> <b>taken</b> <b>their</b> toll on many species.|$|E
25|$|During the Roman period, {{this part}} of the Cumbrian {{coastline}} was fortified, as coastal defences were constructed beyond the western end of Hadrian's Wall to protect against incursions across the Solway Firth. Milefortlets 14, 15, 16, and 17 are all located nearby, with milefortlet 16 being the closest. However, centuries of coastal erosion <b>have</b> <b>taken</b> <b>their</b> toll, and today, only the rear eastern rampart of milefortlet 16 survives.|$|E
25|$|Around {{fifty years}} {{after the fall of}} the city to the Ottomans, Atık Ali Paşa, the Grand Vizier of Sultan Bayezid II, ordered the Chora Church to be {{converted}} into a mosque — Kariye Camii. Due to the prohibition against iconic images in Islam, the mosaics and frescoes were covered behind a layer of plaster. This and frequent earthquakes in the region <b>have</b> <b>taken</b> <b>their</b> toll on the artwork.|$|E

25|$|Lusatian {{tribes are}} {{noted in the}} work of the Bavarian Geographer. The {{document}} contains a list of the tribes in Central-Eastern Europe east of the Elbe and north of the Danube to the Volga rivers to the Black and Caspian Sea most of them of Slavic origin. Having settled by the Elbe, Spree and Neisse in the 6th century, Sorbian tribes divided into two main groups, which <b>have</b> <b>taken</b> <b>their</b> names from the characteristics of the area where they had settled. Sorbs living on the swampy broads of the Lower Spree <b>have</b> <b>taken</b> <b>their</b> name from the word marsh. The Milceni (ancestors of Upper Sorbs) settled on fertile soil around Upper Spree, the name derives from the word měl’ (loess soil). The two groups were separated from each other by a wide and uninhabited forest range. The rest of the tribes settled themselves between the Elbe and Saale. Among the many Slavic tribes, the Bavarian Geographer also noted a few Lusatian tribes: Glomacze - Dolomici, Milceni, Chutizi and Sitice.|$|E
25|$|Combat in GURPS is {{organized}} in personal turns: i.e., every character gets a turn each second, and during {{his or her}} character's turn {{he or she may}} take an action, such as attack or move. After all characters <b>have</b> <b>taken</b> <b>their</b> action, one second has elapsed. Free actions are simple actions that can be done at any time. Characters in a party have a set initiative that is entirely based upon their Basic Speed characteristic.|$|E
25|$|The 52 {{victims were}} of diverse backgrounds; {{among them were}} several {{foreign-born}} British nationals, foreign exchange students, parents, and one British couple of 14 years. The majority of the victims lived in or near London. Because of train delays before the attacks and subsequent transport problems caused by them, several victims died aboard trains and buses they would not normally <b>have</b> <b>taken.</b> <b>Their</b> ages ranged from 20 to 60 years old, {{with an average age}} of 34.|$|E

Further, with the hoard, he will have red gold {{for the rest of his}} life. Hreidmar tells them to leave, and the poem continues without further mention of Loki.|$|E
25|$|Though Sarah is more deferential than Nancy, {{she does}} assert herself to Leslie when an {{experience}} is important. For example, she insists on accompanying Leslie when {{he approaches the}} humans in act II after they <b>have</b> <b>taken</b> <b>their</b> submissive pose. Sarah wants to see everything for herself. Most of the new things she encounters intrigue her: the handshakes; Nancy's breasts; human gestation; and the birds flying above them, among other things. But she is also fearful. The jets frighten her, as does Charlie when he asks her {{what she would do}} if Leslie went away and never came back. Like Leslie, Sarah does not grasp many human concepts like emotions and nonaquatic animals, though she tries.|$|E
25|$|The {{excursions}} sometimes {{evolved into}} rowdy gatherings and legislation was passed to prevent this. A commission established in 1805 issued instructions which prohibited {{the consumption of}} food or drink as well as music or {{any other kind of}} cheerful behaviour in the cemetery. The gravediggers, who lived on the premises, were to enforce these restrictions but they seem to <b>have</b> <b>taken</b> <b>their</b> duties lightly. Legislation from 1813 prohibited them to sell alcohol to visitors to the cemetery. Despite all these efforts, the desired peace and quiet was a long time in coming. For particularly grand funerals, crowds of spectators would gather, and people would festoon the cemetery walls to get a better view. To reduce numbers of visitors, there was talk of introducing admission fees, but this was never carried out.|$|E
