25|$|The bow drill {{consists}} of a bearing block or handhold, a spindle or drill, a hearth or fireboard, and a simple bow. Other early versions of mechanical drills include the pump drill and the <b>hand</b> <b>drill.</b>|$|E

25|$|Lip and {{spur drill}} bits are also {{effective}} in soft plastic. Conventional twist drill bits in a <b>hand</b> <b>drill,</b> where the hole axis is not maintained throughout the operation, {{have a tendency}} to smear the edges of the hole through side friction as the drill bit vibrates.|$|E
25|$|Traditional or trad {{climbing}} involves {{rock climbing}} routes in which protection against falls is placed by the climber while ascending, or bolts placed on lead. Gear {{is used to}} protect against falls but not to aid the ascent directly. Traditional bolted face climbs are different than sport climbs. Trad bolted climbs use either a <b>hand</b> <b>drill</b> and or are bolted on lead. This means there are far fewer bolts and they are spaced out farther than sport climbs.|$|E
25|$|These bits are {{available}} both in a version similar to an auger bit or brace bit, designed for low speed, high torque use with a brace or other <b>hand</b> <b>drill</b> (pictured to the right), or {{as a high}} speed, low torque bit meant for a power drill. While {{the shape of the}} cutting edges is different, and one uses screw threads and the other a twist bit for the pilot, the method of adjusting them remains the same.|$|E
50|$|Drilled wells can be {{excavated}} {{by simple}} <b>hand</b> <b>drilling</b> methods (augering, sludging, jetting, driving, hand percussion) or machine drilling (rotary, percussion, down the hole hammer). Deeprock rotary drilling method is most common. Rotary {{can be used}} in 90% of formation types.|$|R
5000|$|When mining {{commenced}} in 1931, {{the mine}} was mechanized {{to an extent}} not previously seen in Australia, with mechanized drilling and mechanical shovels rather than [...] "hammer and tap" [...] <b>hand</b> <b>drilling</b> and <b>hand</b> shovels. The initial mine production was 660,000 tonnes per year ("t/y") of ore and stayed at about this level until 1953.|$|R
50|$|Before European {{contact and}} at least 1500 years ago {{indigenous}} peoples of the Northeastern Woodlands produced barrel-shaped and discoidal shell beads, as well as perforated small whole shells. The earliest beads are larger when compared to later beads and those of wampum, with <b>hand</b> <b>drilled</b> holes. The use of the more slender iron drills much improved drilling.|$|R
2500|$|The <b>hand</b> <b>drill</b> is {{a similar}} tool, but uses a longer, thinner spindle; and instead of a bearing block and bow combination, the {{downward}} pressure and spinning is achieved by rubbing the hands together around the spindle. As the hands move downward to the base, where the drill is pinched and the hands are brought quickly to the top one at a time. This can be made unnecessary by cutting a nock {{at the top of}} the drill, tying a cord through this, and then putting your thumbs through loops in the cord. However, skilled operators can either maintain pressure with their hands almost stationary vertically; or, in a movement comparable to floating, can [...] "float" [...] their hands back to the top of the drill. There is a more limited choice of materials to use with this method, needing much softer materials, such as mullein, yucca, cattail, and root wood.|$|E

5000|$|Though it {{is often}} claimed that the Egyptians used roller {{bearings}} {{in the form of}} tree trunks under sleds, this is modern speculation.

5000|$|The Indus Valley Civilization {{has yielded}} {{evidence}} of dentistry being practiced {{as far back}} as 7000 BC. This earliest form of dentistry involved curing tooth related disorders with bow drills operated, perhaps, by skilled bead craftsmen. The reconstruction of this ancient form of dentistry showed that the methods used were reliable and effective. Cavities of 3.5 mm depth with concentric groovings indicate use of a drill tool. The age of the teeth has been estimated at 9000 years. In later times, mechanical <b>hand</b> <b>drills</b> were used. Like most <b>hand</b> <b>drills,</b> they were quite slow, with speeds of up to 15 rpm. In 1864, British dentist George Fellows Harrington invented a clockwork dental drill named Erado. [...] The device was much faster than earlier drills, but also very noisy. In 1868, American dentist George F. Green came up with a pneumatic dental drill powered with pedal-operated bellows. James B. Morrison devised a pedal-powered burr drill in 1871.|$|R

50|$|The <b>hand</b> <b>drill</b> is {{the most}} {{widespread}} among indigenous cultures, characterized {{by the use of}} a thin, straightened wooden shaft or reed to be spun with the hands, grinding within a notch against the soft wooden base of a fire board (a wooden board with a carved notch in which to catch heated wood fibers created by friction). This repeated spinning and downward pressure causes black dust to form in the notch of the fireboard, eventually creating a hot, glowing coal. The coal is then carefully placed among dense, fine tinder, which is pressed against it as one blows directly onto the coal until the tinder begins burning and eventually catches into flame. The advantage of the <b>hand</b> <b>drill</b> technique is that it requires no rope.|$|E
