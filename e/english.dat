5|$|As decolonisation {{proceeded}} {{throughout the}} British Empire in the 1950s and 1960s, former colonies often did not reject <b>English</b> but rather {{continued to use}} it as independent countries setting their own language policies. For example, the view of the <b>English</b> language among many Indians has gone from associating it with colonialism to associating it with economic progress, and <b>English</b> continues to be an official language of India. <b>English</b> is also widely used in media and literature, and the number of <b>English</b> language books published annually in India is the third largest in the world after the US and UK. However <b>English</b> is rarely spoken as a first language, numbering only around a couple hundred-thousand people, and less than 5% of the population speak fluent <b>English</b> in India. David Crystal claimed in 2004 that, combining native and non-native speakers, India now has more people who speak or understand <b>English</b> than {{any other country in the}} world, but the number of <b>English</b> speakers in India is very uncertain, with most scholars concluding that the United States still has more speakers of <b>English</b> than India.|$|E

5|$|By the 15th century, <b>English</b> {{was back}} in fashion among all classes, though much changed; the Middle <b>English</b> form showed many signs of French influence, both in {{vocabulary}} and spelling. During the <b>English</b> Renaissance, many words were coined from Latin and Greek origins. Modern <b>English</b> has extended this custom of flexibility, {{when it comes to}} incorporating words from different languages. Thanks {{in large part to the}} British Empire, the <b>English</b> language is the world's unofficial lingua franca.|$|E

50|$|A {{prominent}} {{argument against}} incorporating translanguaging into academic contexts {{is the notion}} that speakers of International <b>Englishes</b> would have difficulty communicating with one another because of the immense variety of <b>Englishes</b> spoken. However, advocates for translanguaging pedagogy maintain that misunderstandings between speakers of International <b>Englishes</b> who practice translanguaging are not common, and when misunderstandings do occur between speakers they are quickly resolved through other means of negotiation. Advocates argue that speakers of International <b>Englishes</b> can communicate with relative ease because they have a variety of tools to utilize in order {{to make sense of the}} language varieties with which they engage.|$|R

5|$|Dialectologists {{identify}} many <b>English</b> dialects, {{which usually}} refer to regional varieties {{that differ from}} each other in terms of patterns of grammar, vocabulary, and pronunciation. The pronunciation of particular areas distinguishes dialects as separate regional accents. The major native dialects of <b>English</b> are often divided by linguists into the two extremely general categories of British <b>English</b> (BrE) and North American <b>English</b> (NAE). There also exists a third common major grouping of <b>English</b> varieties: Southern Hemisphere <b>English,</b> the most prominent being Australian and New Zealand <b>English.</b>|$|E
5|$|<b>English</b> has {{a strong}} {{influence}} on the vocabulary of other languages. The influence of <b>English</b> comes from such factors as opinion leaders in other countries knowing the <b>English</b> language, the role of <b>English</b> as a world lingua franca, and {{the large number of}} books and films that are translated from <b>English</b> into other languages. That pervasive use of <b>English</b> leads to a conclusion in many places that <b>English</b> is an especially suitable language for expressing new ideas or describing new technologies. Among varieties of <b>English,</b> it is especially American <b>English</b> that influences other languages. Some languages, such as Chinese, write words borrowed from <b>English</b> mostly as calques, while others, such as Japanese, readily take in <b>English</b> loanwords written in sound-indicating script. Dubbed films and television programmes are an especially fruitful source of <b>English</b> influence on languages in Europe.|$|E
5|$|<b>English</b> in England can {{be divided}} into four major dialect regions, Southwest <b>English,</b> South East <b>English,</b> Midlands <b>English,</b> and Northern <b>English.</b> Within each of these regions several local subdialects exist: Within the Northern region, there is a {{division}} between the Yorkshire dialects, and the Geordie dialect spoken in Northumbria around Newcastle, and the Lancashire dialects with local urban dialects in Liverpool (Scouse) and Manchester (Mancunian). Having been the centre of Danish occupation during the Viking Invasions, Northern <b>English</b> dialects, particularly the Yorkshire dialect, retain Norse features not found in other <b>English</b> varieties.|$|E

5|$|<b>English</b> is an Indo-European language, and {{belongs to}} the West Germanic group of the Germanic languages. Old <b>English</b> {{originated}} from a Germanic tribal and linguistic continuum {{along the coast of}} the North Sea, whose languages are now known as the Anglo-Frisian subgroup within West Germanic. As such, the modern Frisian languages are the closest living relatives of Modern <b>English.</b> Low German/Low Saxon is also closely related, and sometimes <b>English,</b> the Frisian languages, and Low German are grouped together as the Ingvaeonic, though this grouping remains debated. Old <b>English</b> evolved into Middle <b>English,</b> which in turn evolved into Modern <b>English.</b> Particular dialects of Old and Middle <b>English</b> also developed into a number of other <b>English</b> (Anglic) languages, including Scots and the extinct Fingallian and Forth and Bargy (Yola) dialects of Ireland.|$|E
5|$|<b>English</b> {{remains an}} active second language, with its use allowed for some {{official}} purposes under the National Language Act of 1967. In Sarawak, <b>English</b> is an official state language alongside Malaysian. Historically, <b>English</b> was {{the de facto}} administrative language, with Malay becoming predominant after the 1969 race riots (13 May Incident). Malaysian <b>English,</b> also known as Malaysian Standard <b>English,</b> {{is a form of}} <b>English</b> derived from British <b>English.</b> Malaysian <b>English</b> is widely used in business, along with Manglish, which is a colloquial form of <b>English</b> with heavy Malay, Chinese, and Tamil influences. The government discourages the use of non-standard Malay but has no power to issue compounds or fines to those who use improper Malay on their advertisements.|$|E
5|$|Many {{users of}} <b>English</b> in the {{expanding}} circle {{use it to}} communicate with other people from the expanding circle, so that interaction with native speakers of <b>English</b> plays no part in their decision to use <b>English.</b> Non-native varieties of <b>English</b> are widely used for international communication, and speakers of one such variety often encounter features of other varieties. Very often today a conversation in <b>English</b> {{anywhere in the world}} may include no native speakers of <b>English</b> at all, even while including speakers from several different countries.|$|E

5|$|Old <b>English</b> is very {{different}} from Modern <b>English</b> and difficult for 21st-century <b>English</b> speakers to understand. Its grammar was similar to that of modern German, and its closest relative is Old Frisian. Nouns, adjectives, pronouns, and verbs had many more inflectional endings and forms, and word order was much freer than in Modern <b>English.</b> Modern <b>English</b> has case forms in pronouns (he, him, his) and a few verb endings (I have, he has), but Old <b>English</b> had case endings in nouns as well, and verbs had more person and number endings.|$|E
5|$|Scots {{is today}} {{considered}} a separate language from <b>English,</b> {{but it has}} its origins in early Northern Middle <b>English</b> and developed and changed during its history with influence from other sources, particularly Scots Gaelic and Old Norse.

And in addition to Scots, Scottish <b>English</b> are the varieties of Standard <b>English</b> spoken in Scotland, most varieties are Northern <b>English</b> accents, with some influence from Scots.|$|E
5|$|Since 1788, <b>English</b> {{has been}} spoken in Oceania, and Australian <b>English</b> has {{developed}} as a first language {{of the vast majority}} of the inhabitants of the Australian continent, its standard accent being General Australian. The <b>English</b> of neighbouring New Zealand has to a lesser degree become an influential standard variety of the language. Australian and New Zealand <b>English</b> are each other's closest relatives with few differentiating characteristics, followed by South African <b>English</b> and the <b>English</b> of southeastern England, all of which have similarly non-rhotic accents, aside from some accents in the South Island of New Zealand. Australian and New Zealand <b>English</b> stand out for their innovative vowels: many short vowels are fronted or raised, whereas many long vowels have diphthongised. Australian <b>English</b> also has a contrast between long and short vowels, not found in most other varieties. Australian <b>English</b> grammar aligns closely to British and American English; like American <b>English,</b> collective plural subjects take on a singular verb (as in the government is rather than are). New Zealand <b>English</b> uses front vowels that are often even higher than in Australian <b>English.</b>|$|E

5|$|Specialised subsets of <b>English</b> arise spontaneously in {{international}} communities, for example, among international business people, as an auxiliary language. This {{has led some}} scholars to develop the study of <b>English</b> as an auxiliary languages.

5|$|The {{consequence}} of this complex orthographic history is that learning to read can be challenging in <b>English.</b> It can take longer for school pupils to become independently fluent readers of <b>English</b> than of many other languages, including Italian, Spanish, or German. Nonetheless, there is an advantage for learners of <b>English</b> reading in learning the specific sound-symbol regularities {{that occur in the}} standard <b>English</b> spellings of commonly used words. Such instruction greatly reduces the risk of children experiencing reading difficulties in <b>English.</b> Making primary school teachers more aware of the primacy of morpheme representation in <b>English</b> may help learners learn more efficiently to read and write <b>English.</b>|$|E

5|$|The {{most common}} accent and/or dialect spoken by natives {{throughout}} Texas is {{sometimes referred to}} as Texan <b>English,</b> which itself is a sub-variety of a broader category of American <b>English</b> known as Southern American <b>English.</b> Creole language is spoken in East Texas. In some areas of the state—particularly in the large cities – Western American <b>English</b> and General American <b>English,</b> have been on the increase.

5|$|The next {{period in}} the history of <b>English</b> was Early Modern <b>English</b> (1500–1700). Early Modern <b>English</b> was characterised by the Great Vowel Shift (1350–1700), inflectional simplification, and {{linguistic}} standardisation.|$|E
5|$|Those {{countries}} have millions of native speakers of dialect continua ranging from an English-based creole {{to a more}} standard version of <b>English.</b> They have many more speakers of <b>English</b> who acquire <b>English</b> {{in the process of}} growing up through day by day use and listening to broadcasting, especially if they attend schools where <b>English</b> is the medium of instruction. Varieties of <b>English</b> learned by speakers who are not native speakers born to English-speaking parents may be influenced, especially in their grammar, by the other languages spoken by those learners. Most of those varieties of <b>English</b> include words little used by native speakers of <b>English</b> in the inner-circle countries, and they may have grammatical and phonological differences from inner-circle varieties as well. The standard <b>English</b> of the inner-circle countries is often taken as a norm for use of <b>English</b> in the outer-circle countries.|$|E
