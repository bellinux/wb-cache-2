5|$|IFK Göteborg {{have used}} three other stadia as {{official}} home grounds. The <b>first</b> <b>ground</b> was Idrottsplatsen, in use from 1905 to 1915. It {{was built in}} 1896 for the cycling club Göteborgs Velocipedklubb, and was originally used for track cycling. During the 1909 season IFK Göteborg also used Örgryte IS' home ground of the time, Balders Hage, due to a conflict with the owners of Idrottsplatsen. The third official stadium was Walhalla Idrottsplats, used {{for a number of}} home matches {{at the same time as}} Idrottsplatsen. A fourth ground, Slottsskogsvallen, has never been the official home ground, but has nonetheless been used a number of times for IFK Göteborg home matches.|$|E
5|$|Cardiff's <b>first</b> <b>ground</b> was at Sophia Gardens {{recreational}} {{park where}} they played from their founding in 1899 until 1910 when, {{due to the}} lack of facilities at the ground and the increasing amount of support for the club, Bartley Wilson contacted Bute Estate, who owned large amounts of Cardiff at the time, in an attempt to find land suitable for building a stadium. They eventually agreed on an area of waste ground on Sloper Road. The land was a former rubbish tip and required extensive work to get a playable surface, but with the assistance of Cardiff Corporation and volunteers the work was completed. The ground was originally to be known as Sloper Park but was instead named after Lord Ninian Crichton-Stuart, who was a large force in helping the club get the ground built, and became Ninian Park. The ground hosted its first match on 1 September 1910 with a friendly against Aston Villa, with the kick-off being performed by Lord Crichton-Stuart.|$|E
5|$|Having {{made the}} journey to Egypt {{travelling}} via South Africa and the Red Sea due {{to the threat of}} attack that was present in the Mediterranean, the battalion arrived just before New Years. The 18th Brigade was again reassigned in February 1941, this time to the 7th Division, with whom they would see out the remainder of the war; at the same time, the brigade was converted from a four-battalion structure to three, and the 2/11th was transferred to help form the 19th Brigade. On 21 March 1941, the battalion undertook its <b>first</b> <b>ground</b> action of the war, when one of its companies– 'D' Company– supported the 2/9th Battalion in their attack on the Italian held fort at Giarabub. The battalion's first major action as a complete unit did not come until April 1941, though, when it undertook defensive actions during the Siege of Tobruk. During the Battle of the Salient, fought in early May, the 2/10th took over a position on the northern flank of the perimeter, relieving the 2/48th Battalion, coming under heavy air attack during the handover.|$|E

5|$|Luton Town's <b>first</b> <b>ground</b> was at Dallow Lane, {{the former}} ground of Excelsior. The ground {{was next to}} the Dunstable to Luton train line, and players {{regularly}} claimed to have trouble seeing the ball because of smoke from the trains. A damaging financial loss during 1896–97 forced Luton to sell the stadium to stay afloat and, as a result, the club moved across the tracks to a stadium between the railway and Dunstable Road. The Dunstable Road ground was opened by Herbrand Russell, 11th Duke of Bedford, who also donated £50 towards the £800 building costs. When the site was sold for housing in 1905, the club was forced to move again at short notice, to its present Kenilworth Road site, {{in time for the}} start of the 1905–06 season.|$|E
5|$|The Iraqi {{offensive}} {{began on}} the night of 29 January, when approximately 2,000 soldiers in several hundred armored fighting vehicles moved south. The Gulf War's <b>first</b> <b>ground</b> engagement was near observation post 4, built on the Al-Zabr police building. Elements of the Iraqi 6th Armored Brigade, ordered to take the heights above Al-Zabr, engaged Coalition units at Al-Zabr. At 20:00 hours, U.S. Marines at the observation post, who had noticed large groups of armored vehicles through their night vision devices, attempted to talk to battalion headquarters but received no response. Contact was not established until 20:30 hours, which prompted Task Force Shepard to respond to the threat. Coalition soldiers at observation post 4 opened fire on the Iraqi column, but this largely ineffective fire drew a heavy Iraqi response which forced the company to retire south, by order of its commanding officer.|$|E
5|$|York's <b>first</b> <b>ground</b> was Fulfordgate, {{which was}} located on Heslington Lane, Fulford in the {{south-east}} of York. With the ground not ready, York played {{their first two}} home matches at Mille Crux, Haxby Road, before they took to the field at Fulfordgate for a 4–1 win over Mansfield Town on 20 September 1922. Fulfordgate was gradually improved; terracing was replaced banking {{behind one of the}} goals, the covered Popular Stand was extended to house 1,000 supporters, and a small seated stand was erected. By the time of York's election to the Football League in 1929, the ground was estimated to hold a capacity of 17,000. However, attendances declined in York's second and third Football League seasons, and the directors blamed this on the ground's location. In April 1932, York's shareholders voted to move to Bootham Crescent, which had been vacated by York Cricket Club, on a 21-year lease. This site was located near the city centre, and had a significantly higher population living nearby than Fulfordgate.|$|E

25|$|The Oval, {{currently}} {{known for}} sponsorship reasons as the Kia Oval, {{is an international}} cricket ground in Kennington, in the London Borough of Lambeth, South London. The Oval has been the home ground of Surrey County Cricket Club since it was opened in 1845. It was the <b>first</b> <b>ground</b> in England to host international Test cricket in September 1880.

25|$|The {{lease on}} the <b>first</b> <b>ground</b> ended in 1810 and Lord {{obtained}} an eighty-year lease on two fields, the Brick and Great Fields at North Bank, St John's Wood. The second venue, now {{referred to as}} Lord's Middle Ground, was built by 1809 when the first games were played there by St John's Wood Cricket Club. This was later merged into MCC who relocated to the Middle Ground in 1811. In 1813 Parliament requisitioned the land for the Regent's Canal, which was cut through the site, thereby necessitating a further move.|$|E

The <b>first</b> <b>ground</b> firing of the Brimstone missile occurred in August 1999, {{followed by the}} first air-launched firing from a Tornado GR4 in September 2000. Clearance of the missile was delayed by 12 months due to the unavailability of a Tornado trials aircraft, as the RAF chose instead to rush {{the development of the}} Storm Shadow air launched cruise missile ahead of the Iraq war, but another delay of 6 months resulted from redesigning the autopilot for safe release at higher speeds. Over 2,000 missiles were produced.|$|E

25|$|With {{the return}} of better weather {{during the spring of}} 1941, the Luftwaffe began to ramp up their night bombing campaign, the Blitz. By this time a number of changes in the night fighter groups were poised to greatly improve the {{performance}} of the defence. Along with increasing numbers of Beaufighters with Mk. IV, the <b>first</b> <b>ground</b> controlled intercept radars were becoming available, which greatly improved the efficiency of arranging an interception. Losses to the night fighter forces continued to mount throughout the spring, roughly doubling every month until the Luftwaffe called off The Blitz at the end of May.|$|E
