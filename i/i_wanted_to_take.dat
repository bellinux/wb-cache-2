500|$|Parker's {{experience}} {{playing in}} Israel left a positive impression upon him. He {{went on to}} wear jersey number 18 for both Toronto and Cleveland, explaining that: [...] "I played in Israel before I {{came back to the}} NBA, and I had such a great time... two of my sons were born while I was playing overseas and one was actually born in Israel. And I just had such a great experience that <b>I</b> <b>wanted</b> <b>to</b> <b>take</b> something from that experience. The number 18, in Judaism, it means 'chai'... and it's the symbol for life and good fortune in Judaism. And I thought that was something to take away from Israel and let them know I'm still representing them." ...|$|E
500|$|It was {{followed}} that {{year by the}} neo-noir crime thriller Mulholland Falls, which featured the murder of Allison Pond (Connelly), mistress of General Timms (John Malkovich), and the investigation {{by a group of}} detectives led by Maxwell Hoover (Nick Nolte). New York magazine wrote about a clip that reveals the link between Timms and Pond: [...] "This footage is actually dirty. That is, it makes us feel like voyeurs when looking at it, but it's so juicily erotic that we can hardly look away". About nudity in the movie, Connelly said: [...] "It kind of shocked everyone who knows me that I wound up doing this movie, because I had always been so careful about nudity, it was {{very much a part of}} this character and I couldn't be coy or guarded or self-conscious--otherwise it wouldn't work. It was sort of a challenge <b>I</b> <b>wanted</b> <b>to</b> <b>take</b> on, I guess".|$|E
500|$|Shakira's {{record label}} at that time, Epic Records, opposed the {{decision}} to release and commission Laundry Service as they [...] "wanted her just to throw a couple of songs in English on a Latin record." [...] Estefan argued with Tommy Mottola, then head of Sony Music Entertainment (the parent company of Epic Records), and convinced him to release the album, arguing that an [...] "American audience" [...] would not buy a Spanish record simply due to its inclusion of a few English tracks. In an interview with Latina, she said [...] "I got in the trenches there with Tommy [...] - I fought for that. Because they didn't believe it. Just like they told us [...] They were trying to think in the box and <b>I</b> <b>wanted</b> <b>to</b> <b>take</b> {{her out of the}} box. And fortunately, Tommy, whom I love and adore and is a good friend, he really listened to me." ...|$|E

500|$|Immediately {{following}} the 1986 season, Weaver retired for good, and Ripken was named {{manager of the}} Orioles. The Orioles were coming off their first last-place finish in Baltimore, but Ripken expressed confidence in the team {{at the beginning of}} the 1987 season, saying, [...] "I know these guys can get the job done. I may be hardheaded, but that's what I believe. We'll be a competitive team." [...] The Orioles got off to a slow start in April 1987, going 9-12 while losing seven of nine games in ones stretch. However, the ballclub would improve in May, moving over [...]500 while setting a May record with 56 home runs. In June, the team fell out of contention, dropping to 28-36, their worst start since 1955. Pitching plagued the club; Harvey Rosenfeld wrote it was [...] "the root cause of the Orioles' problems. In 1987, Ripken became the first—and only—father to manage two sons simultaneously in the majors, as his son Billy was called up at the All-Star break. Ripken managed Cal Jr. and Billy for the first time on July 11, in a 21 loss to the Minnesota Twins. The Havre de Grace Record wrote, [...] "The Ripkens of Aberdeen became the first family of sports." [...] On September 14, during a 173 loss to the Toronto Blue Jays, Ripken substituted Cal Jr. with Ron Washington after the eighth inning, ending Cal Jr.'s major-league record streak of 8,243 consecutive innings played. Senior said after the game, [...] "I've been thinking about it for a long time. <b>I</b> <b>wanted</b> <b>to</b> <b>take</b> the monkey off his back. It was my decision, not his." [...] The Orioles finished sixth in the American League East at 6795, setting a team record with 51 home losses.|$|E

People {{who are going to}} say, 'hey he fucked with the movie,' that's being ridiculous. I wanted to have fun and kind of create {{something}} on my own, while sticking to the same tone and flavor of the flick. People want to laugh when they're playing a game, and I just wanted to take advantage of that." ...|$|E

[...] "He was just waiting for a cue from me," [...] Joel recalled. [...] "He would have taken the thing {{anywhere}} <b>I</b> <b>wanted</b> <b>to</b> <b>take</b> it." [...] Originally, Joel was nervous about recording with Charles, and was unsure how to record the song. Producer Phil Ramone told Joel to [...] "challenge him," [...] {{and to do it}} the way Joel wanted to. So, Joel did his best impression of Charles, and Charles understood, and they sang together in the same style.|$|E

[...] Based on that experience, he published a fictionalized account of that cyclone, titled [...] "Southern Storm", for the May 1935 issue of Esquire magazine. Erik Larson excerpts a passage from that article in his 1999 book, Isaac's Storm:I remember now that {{it seemed as if}} we were in a bowl looking up toward the level of the sea. [...] As we stood there in the sandy street, my mother and I, <b>I</b> <b>wanted</b> <b>to</b> <b>take</b> my mother's hand and hurry her away. [...] I felt as if the sea was going to break {{over the edge of the}} bowl and come puring down upon us.|$|E
2500|$|West {{was charged}} with violating Articles 128 (assault) and 134 (general article) of the Uniform Code of Military Justice. During a hearing held {{as part of an}} Article 32 {{investigation}} in November 2003, West stated, [...] "I know the method I used was not right, but <b>I</b> <b>wanted</b> <b>to</b> <b>take</b> care of my soldiers." [...] The charges were ultimately referred to an Article 15 proceeding rather than court-martial, at which West was fined $5,000. West accepted the judgment and retired with full benefits as a lieutenant colonel in the summer of 2004. Asked if he would act differently under similar circumstances, West testified, [...] "If it's about the lives of my soldiers at stake, I'd go through hell with a gasoline can." [...] At his hearing, West said that there were no ambushes against American forces in Taji until he was relieved of his leadership post a month later. After West's retirement he received more than 2,000 letters and e-mails offering him moral support. A letter supporting West was signed by 95 members of the U.S. Congress and sent to the Secretary of the Army.|$|E
2500|$|Abe {{was arrested}} and interrogated over eight sessions. When asked why she had severed Ishida's genitalia, Abe replied, [...] "Because I couldn't take his head or body with me. <b>I</b> <b>wanted</b> <b>to</b> <b>take</b> the part of him that brought back to me the most vivid memories." [...] The {{interrogating}} officer was struck by Abe's demeanor when asked why she had killed Ishida. [...] "Immediately she became excited and her eyes sparkled in a strange way." [...] Her answer was: [...] "I loved him so much, I wanted him all to myself. But since we were not husband and wife, {{as long as he}} lived he could be embraced by other women. I knew that if I killed him no other woman could ever touch him again, so I killed him....." [...] In attempting to explain what distinguished Abe's case from over a dozen other similar cases in Japan, William Johnston suggests that it is this answer which captured the imagination of the nation. [...] "She had killed not out of jealousy but out of love." [...] Mark Schreiber notes that the Sada Abe incident occurred {{at a time when the}} Japanese media were preoccupied with extreme political and military troubles, including the Ni Ni Roku incident and a looming full-scale war in China. He suggests that a sensationalistic sex scandal such as this served as a welcome national release from the disturbing events of the time. The incident also struck a chord with the ero-guro-nansensu ("erotic-grotesque-nonsense") style popular at the time, and the Sada Abe Incident came to represent that genre for years to come.|$|E
