In this study, the IRAS catalogue has much larger positional uncertainties {{than those of}} the SDSS. A model was constructed by applying the supervised learning algorithm (SVM) to a set of training data. Validation of the model shows a good identification performance (∼ 90 % correct), better than that derived from classical cross-matching algorithms, such as the likelihood-ratio method used in previous studies...|$|E
40|$|At {{the end of}} the 19 th century, Irish astronomers Johnstone Stoney and A. M. W. Downing {{showed in}} {{principle}} how to predict meteor storms. Their work and later developments applying similar ideas are reviewed here. The theories essentially involve determining the dynamical behavior of dust trails, which are narrow, dense structures within a broader stream. The formation of dust trails and the main features of their evolution are explained. Some Leonid dust trails are perturbed by the planets so as to result in meteor storms {{at the start of the}} 21 st century. 1 A hundred years: from Stoney and Downing to the 1999 Leonid storm 1. 1 IRAS trails and meteor storms In 1983 the <b>Infra-Red</b> <b>Astronomical</b> <b>Satellite</b> (IRAS) discovered narrow, dense trails of meteoroids and dust near the orbits of some known short-period comets. It was clear that there are similar trails associated with many periodic comets, those detected by IRAS generally being in cases where the comet was near perihelion during t [...] ...|$|E
40|$|We present {{continuum}} {{data from}} the Submillimetre Common-User Bolometer Array (SCUBA) on the James Clerk Maxwell Telescope (JCMT), and the Mid-Infrared Photometer for Spitzer (MIPS) on the Spitzer Space Telescope, at submillimetre and infrared wavelengths respectively. We study the Taurus molecular cloud 1 (TMC 1), {{and in particular the}} region of the Taurus Molecular Ring (TMR). In the continuum data we see no real evidence for a ring, but rather we see one side of it only, appearing as a filament. We name the filament `the bull's tail'. The filament is seen in emission at 850, 450 and 160 um, and in absorption at 70 um. We compare the data with archive {{data from the}} <b>Infra-Red</b> <b>Astronomical</b> <b>Satellite</b> (IRAS) at 12, 25, 60, 100 um, in which the filament is also seen in absorption. We find that the emission from the filament consists of two components: a narrow, cold (~ 8 K), central core; and a broader, slightly warmer (~ 12 K), shoulder of emission. We use a radiative transfer code to model the filament's appearance, either in emission or absorption, simultaneously at each of the different wavelengths. Our best fit model uses a Plummer-like density profile and a homogeneous interstellar dust grain population. Unlike previous work on a similar, but different filament in Taurus, we require no grain coagulation to explain our data. Comment: 10 pages, 9 Figures, Accepted by MNRA...|$|E

30|$|Star {{formation}} (SF) history {{holds the}} key to understanding galaxy evolution, and—from a wider perspective—the nature of our Universe. One of the obstacles to observing starburst regions in galaxies using optical telescopes is dust. On the other hand, protostars form from dust clouds and molecular gas. Most of the dust in galaxies is quite cool (~ 10 – 20 K), and its emission is visible only in the far infrared (Glass, 1999). A warm dust component might be observable during starburst activity (Phillips, 2005). The newly born, blue massive stars are surrounded by gas and dust, which obscure the most interesting regions and, additionally, absorb a part of the ultraviolet (UV) light emitted by stars. Dust heated in this way re-emits the absorbed light in the infrared wavelengths, mostly in the far infrared. Even very careful observations in the UV and optical ranges of wavelengths cannot provide {{a detailed description of the}} SF processes in galaxies. The infrared (IR) emission, reflecting the dust-obscured SF activity of galaxies (Genzel and Cesarsky, 2000), combined together with UV and optical data, can give full information about the star formation history and rate. Additionally, the ratio between the UV and far infrared (FIR) emission may serve as an indicator of the dust attenuation in galaxies (e.g., Buat et al., 2005; Takeuchi et al., 2005; Noll et al., 2009). The first all-sky survey at IR was performed by the satellite IRAS (The <b>Infra-Red</b> <b>Astronomical</b> <b>Satellite,</b> Neugebauer et al., 1984). IRAS mapped the sky at 12 μm, 15 μm, 60 μm, and 100 μm for 300 days and forever changed our view of the sky (Beichman, 1987). IRAS detected IR emission from about 350 000 astronomical sources, and the number of known astronomical objects went up by 70 %. A large fraction of the extragalactic sources detected in the far infrared were spiral galaxies, quasars (QSOs), Seyfert galaxies, and early type galaxies (Genzel and Cesarsky, 2000), but also new classes of galaxies very bright in the IR, such as ULIRGs (ultra-luminous infrared galaxies), were found. IR satellite missions, focusing on selected areas, were followed by MSX (Midcourse Space Experiment, e.g., Egan et al., 2003), ISO (Infrared Space Observatory, e.g., Genzel and Cesarsky, 2000; Verma et al., 2005), and SST (The Spitzer Space Telescope, e.g., Soifer et al., 2008).|$|E
