5|$|The chained {{slaves were}} packed under the <b>deck</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> small vessel named The Schooner York {{to be shipped}} to the island (other sources say the voyage took place aboard The Morovia).

5|$|Shackleton {{hoped to}} recruit a strong {{contingent}} from the Discovery Expedition and offered his former comrade Edward Wilson {{the post of}} chief scientist and second-in-command. Wilson refused, citing his work with the Board of Agriculture's Committee on the Investigation of Grouse Disease. Further refusals followed from former Discovery colleagues Michael Barne, Reginald Skelton and finally George Mulock, who inadvertently revealed to Shackleton that the Discovery officers had all committed themselves to Scott and his as yet unannounced expedition plans. The only Discovery hands to join Shackleton were the two Petty Officers, Frank Wild and Ernest Joyce. Apparently Shackleton spotted Joyce on the top <b>deck</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> bus as it passed the expedition's London offices, whereupon someone was sent to find him and bring him in.|$|E
5|$|Hurricane Isabel {{produced}} {{slightly above}} normal tides and rough surf along the Jersey shore, killing one surfer off of Wildwood Crest. The combination of gusty winds {{and the heavy}} surf produced moderate beach erosion along much of the coastline, primarily to beaches facing southeastward. In the Delaware Bay and River area, no significant erosion was reported, though coastal flooding from the hurricane washed out a road and destroyed the <b>deck</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> house in Baypoint. In Cape May County waves eroded the beaches by up to 4feet (1.2m) in Ocean City and Avalon, with several cities experiencing a loss of dunes and geotubes in Whale Beach being exposed. Waves from Isabel in Atlantic County resulted in light damage, minor coastal flooding, and slight beach erosion. The beaches of southern Ocean County experienced a loss of 3 to 4feet (0.9 to 1.2m) of sand, while locations further to the north experienced only minor erosion. Most coastal areas of Monmouth County reported eroded beaches by up to 4feet (1.2m), with Union Beach losing about 5,000sq. feet (465sq. m) of sand.|$|E

5|$|Realising {{that further}} {{manoeuvring}} would be pointless, Crutchley ordered the charges to be blown {{and the ship}} evacuated. As Engineer-Lieutenant William Bury prepared to detonate the scuttling charges, Crutchley took {{a survey of the}} ship and ordered all survivors to take to the boats on the seaward side of the wreck. As men scrambled down the ship's flank away from the shells and machine-gun bullets spitting from the harbour entrance, Crutchley made a final survey with an electric torch looking for wounded men among the dead on the decks. Satisfied that none alive remained aboard, he too leapt onto the <b>deck</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> motor launch bobbing below. The rescue mission itself, however, was not going as planned. Of the five motor launches attached to the expedition, only one had remained with the cruiser in the fog; ML254 commanded by Lieutenant Geoffrey Drummond. The launch—like the cruiser—was riddled with bullets; her commander was wounded and her executive officer dead. Despite her sheltered position behind the cruiser, fire from shore continued to enfilade the launch and a number of those aboard, including Lieutenant Bury, suffered broken ankles as they jumped onto the heaving deck.|$|E

25|$|The Nimbus engines were {{produced}} in two main variants, the Mark 103/503 and the Mark 105/502. The Mark 103/503 is generally {{similar to the}} Mark 105/502 except that the former has a double-caliper disc brake incorporated in the output drive shaft to provide adequate braking of the helicopter's rotor in the high winds encountered over the <b>deck</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> fast moving ship, whereas the 105/502 has a single caliper unit.|$|E
25|$|Typically {{constructed}} of hardwood planking and selectively clad with armour plate, this shallow-draft, barge-like boat {{with a crew}} of four could ferry an infantry platoon of 31, with space to spare for five additional specialist troops, to shore at 7 knots (13km/h). Men generally entered the boat by walking over a gangplank from the boat <b>deck</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> troop transport as the LCA hung from its davits. When loaded, the LCA was lowered into the water. Soldiers exited by the boat's bow ramp.|$|E

25|$|As top missile {{advisor to}} the chief of naval operations, Admiral Robert B. Carney, Sides {{convinced}} Carney to veto several early FBM proposals, including a 1952 bid by Freitag and other Navy officers for a weaponized version of the Viking rocket, whose launch from the rolling <b>deck</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> ship had already been demonstrated. Since the FBM {{would have to be}} funded internally by siphoning funds from existing Navy programs, Carney and Sides both judged that the research costs associated with the FBM were too open-ended to justify sacrificing present combat capability for an unproven future capability.|$|E
25|$|On the <b>deck</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> typical trireme in the Peloponnesian War {{there were}} 4 or 5 archers and 10 or so marines. These few troops were {{peripherally}} effective in an offensive sense, but critical in providing defense for the oarsmen. Should {{the crew of}} another trireme board, the marines were all that stood between the enemy troops and the slaughter of the men below. It has also been recorded that if a battle were {{to take place in}} the calmer water of a harbor, oarsmen would join the offensive and throw stones (from a stockpile aboard) to aid the marines in harassing/attacking other ships.|$|E
25|$|De la Cierva's early autogyros were {{fitted with}} fixed rotor hubs, small fixed wings, and control {{surfaces}} {{like those of}} a fixed-wing aircraft. At low airspeeds, the control surfaces became ineffective and could readily lead to loss of control, particularly during landing. In response, Cierva developed a direct control rotor hub, which could be tilted in any direction by the pilot. De la Cierva's direct control was first developed on the Cierva C.19 Mk. V and saw production on the Cierva C.30 series of 1934. In March 1934 this type of autogyro became the first rotorcraft to take off and land on the <b>deck</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> ship, when a C.30 performed trials on board the Spanish navy seaplane tender Dédalo off Valencia.|$|E

25|$|The Lynx is a {{multi-purpose}} twin-engine battlefield helicopter, {{of which}} specialized versions {{have been developed}} for both sea and land-based warfare. A distinguishing feature between early and later aircraft is the undercarriage: early Army versions of the Lynx were equipped with skids, while the Naval and later models have been outfitted with wheels, a requirement for easy ground handling on the <b>deck</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> warship. Early versions of the Lynx were powered by a pair of Rolls-Royce Gem turboshaft engines, which powered a four-blade rotor. Mounted on a rigid titanium monobloc rotor head of the kind pioneered by the MBB BO105 a few years earlier. The innovative blade design comprised a honeycomb sandwich structure and made out of composite material. For shipboard stowage, both the rotor blades and tail can be folded. Lag dampers were incorporated but these are not required in flight (owing to the rigidity of the monobloc rotor head). In flight, the main rotor is kept at a constant speed, simplifying aircraft control; the rotor also features a vibration absorption system.|$|E
25|$|Dressing into a {{dry suit}} is usually more {{time-consuming}} than a wet suit, and may require {{the assistance of}} another person to check the neck seal and close the zipper. In situations where the air is warm but the water cold, a prolonged time on the <b>deck</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> boat donning a dry suit and other gear can present a risk of overheating to the diver. This is a particular problem to relatively inexperienced divers, who may require more time to dress in. This problem can be mitigated by preparing all other equipment {{as far as possible}} before fully donning the suit and to wet the outside of the suit, and the hair and face after closing the zipper, to provide some evaporative cooling while on deck. Professional stand-by divers may have a similar problem, as they are required to be ready for deployment at all times while the working diver is in the water, which may involve waiting on deck for several hours. Wetting the outside of the suit, and seating the diver in shade and a breeze are the usual solution to this problem.|$|E
25|$|Phil {{decides to}} sell The Queen Victoria, as revenge for Alfie's {{treatment}} of Roxy, and Kat and Alfie move {{back in with}} Mo. Kat then reveals that she is pregnant by Alfie, and discovers that she is having twins. Having spotted Stacey from the top <b>deck</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> bus, Kat decides to track her down. She visits Janine in prison, and agrees to provide a false witness statement for Michael's murder, in return for Janine dropping false charges against Stacey, {{so that she can}} return to Walford. At her trial, Janine confesses to her crimes, and Kat is charged with perjury. She is devastated when Stacey hands herself over to the police for Archie Mitchell's (Larry Lamb) murder, five years previously. Kat attends a hearing, and is given a suspended sentence. After the market is merged with Spring Lane, Kat immediately clashes with her new rival, Donna Yates (Lisa Hammond) and is later surprised when Alfie reveals he has bought a pitch on the market. Kat gives birth to Bert and Ernie Moon. Stacey is released after she appeals her sentence and comes to live with Alfie and Kat. The financial situation becomes worse for the Moons when Alfie reveals they are to be evicted as they have not been paying their bills.|$|E
