Critics, including the Farm Bureau, strongly opposed the FSA as an experiment in collectivizing agriculture—that is, in bringing farmers together to work <b>on</b> large government-owned <b>farms</b> using modern techniques under the supervision of experts. After the Conservative coalition took control of Congress it transformed the FSA into a program to help poor farmers buy land, and that program continues to operate in the 21st century as the Farmers Home Administration.|$|R
40|$|Owners of stables {{and owners}} of zoos have {{difficulty}} finding an economically sustainable deposition of their produced manure. More {{than two million}} tons of horse manure are produced in urban environments in Sweden every year. If the manure cannot be used as fertilizer <b>on</b> <b>farm</b> land it is classified as a waste fraction and should be handled according to current regulations. The manure is a valuable waste fraction that contains both energy and nutrients. If the manure cannot be spread <b>on</b> <b>farm</b> <b>land</b> <b>more</b> applications need to be identified, where the energy and nutrients in the manure can be used. The focus {{in this study is}} to investigate possible applications for the usage of horse and zoo manure within Borås municipality where, among other things, a waste water treatment plant and a combined heat and power plant are available. Horse and zoo manure have been investigated in the following applications: co-digestion with sewage sludge at a waste water treatment plant (lab experiments), co-digestion with food waste (theoretical), co-incineration with waste (full scale) and co-incineration with biomass (theoretical). Potential quantity of manure and economical and legal aspects have been studied as well. There is no compilation of the number of horses in the country which makes it hard to estimate the true quantity of manure. The quantity of manure from the zoos are somewhat easier to estimate since the zoo owners are fewer and have knowledge of their manure production. The co-digestions experiments in this study showed that addition of horse manure to digestion can be of interest in many ways, among other things it can give a more stable biogas production and a possible decrease in the Cd/P-ratio in the end product. Horse manure turned out to have a faster degradation rate compared to zoo manure, however the degradation rate was lower than that of sewage sludge. Zoo manure gave a relatively low biogas production compared to horse manure at thermophilic conditions. The co-incineration trial with waste and manure gave no negative effect with regard to emissions and operation. However, the amount of manure added to the incineration trial was low. The theoretical studies regarding the co-incineration with biomass, showed two potential alternatives that need to be investigated further. Interesting aspects to look further upon, based on this study, are for example:• Laws and regulations in the EU regarding manure. • Co-digestion of manure and sewage sludge in a larger scale. • Laws and regulations and costs regarding incineration of manure with biomass...|$|R

40|$|Cotton (Gossypium hirsutum L.) is planted <b>on</b> <b>more</b> <b>land</b> {{area than}} any other crop on the Texas High Plains. Much of this area is {{considered}} highly erodible and requires a conservation com-pliance program to participate in government farm programs. Because this region is semiarid and because irrigation water is increasingly limited, water conservation and efficient use of water are necessary to maximize cotton lint yields. One popular conservation compliance practice used is to plant cotton into a chemically terminated small grain crop, i. e., residue that provides wind protec-tion to the cotton seedlings. Our hypothesis was that in a semiarid region {{the use of a}} small grain cover crop under irrigated conditions would use more water than it conserves compared to con-ventional tilled cotton, thus reducing cotton lint yields. To test the hypothesis separate field stu-dies over two growing seasons and on two soil textures, a loamy fine sand and a clay loam, were conducted. The main treatments were tillage systems (conventional and conservation using ter-minated wheat residue). The two split plot treatments were water supply based on replacement of calculated grass reference evapotranspiration (ETo). Tillage did not affect the amount of wate...|$|R

40|$|Wheat (Triticum spp) {{is one of}} {{the first}} domesticated food crops. It {{represents}} the first source of calories (after rice) and an important source of proteins in developing countries. As a result of the Green Revolution, wheat yield sharply increased due to the use of improved varieties, irrigation, pesticides and fertilizers. The rate of increase in world wheat production however slowed after 1980, except in China, India and Pakistan. Being adapted to a wide range of moisture conditions, wheat is grown <b>on</b> <b>more</b> <b>land</b> area worldwide than any other crop, including in drought prone areas. In these marginal rain-fed environments where at least 60 m ha of wheat is grown, amount and distribution of rainfall are the predominant factors influencing yield variability. Intensive work has been carried out in the area of drought adaptation over the last decades. Breeding strategies for drought tolerance improvement include: definition of the target environment, choice and characterisation of the testing environment, water stress management and characterization, and use of phenotyping traits with high heritability. The use of integrative traits, facilitated by the development and application of new technologies (thermal imaging, spectral reflectance, stable isotopes) is facilitating high throughput phenotyping and indirect selection, consequently favoring yield improvement in drought prone environments...|$|R
