50|$|Compressed <b>gas</b> <b>motors</b> {{have been}} used on some {{vehicles}} experimentally. They are simple, efficient, safe, cheap, reliable and operate {{in a variety of}} conditions. One of the difficulties met when using <b>gas</b> <b>motors</b> is the cooling effect of expanding gas. These engines are limited by how quickly they absorb heat from their surroundings. The cooling effect can, however, double as air conditioning. Compressed <b>gas</b> <b>motors</b> also lose effectiveness with falling gas pressure.|$|R

Output is normally syngas for further synthesis to e.g. Fischer-Tropsch products including diesel fuel, biomethanol, BioDME (dimethyl ether), gasoline via catalytic conversion of dimethyl ether, or biomethane (synthetic natural gas). Syngas {{can also be}} used in heat production and for generation of mechanical and electrical power via <b>gas</b> <b>motors</b> or <b>gas</b> turbines.|$|R
50|$|In Canada, motor {{vehicles}} are primarily powered by gasoline or diesel fuel. Other energy sources include ethanol, biodiesel, propane, {{compressed natural gas}} (CNG), electric batteries charged from an external source, and hydrogen. Canada, like most countries, has excise taxes and other taxes on gasoline, diesel, and other liquid and <b>gas</b> <b>motor</b> fuels (collectively called fuel taxes), and also taxes electricity at various administrative levels. Most provinces and territories in Canada also have taxes on these motor fuels, and some metropolitan areas such as Montreal, Greater Vancouver, and Victoria impose additional taxes.|$|E
50|$|A belt trailer or self {{unloading}} belt trailer is a semi-trailer {{that uses}} either a chain and flap assembly or a continuous belt that runs lengthwise {{on the bottom}} of the trailer. The belt is bolted to bars that in turn bolt to a chain that runs the length of the trailer. This belt is usually composed of rubber that allows the belt to grip the product and various widths are available depending on manufacturer generally ranging from 25 inches to 61 inches wide. A planetary, which is powered by a PTO pump, electric, or <b>gas</b> <b>motor,</b> cycles the belt.|$|E
5000|$|Carbon dioxide is a {{greenhouse}} <b>gas.</b> <b>Motor</b> vehicle CO2 emissions {{are part of}} the anthropogenic contribution to the growth of CO2 concentrations in the atmosphere which according to {{the vast majority of the}} scientific community is causing climate change. [...] Motor vehicles are calculated to generate about 20% of the European Union's man-made CO2 emissions, with passenger cars contributing about 12%. European emission standards limit the CO2 emissions of new passenger cars and light vehicles.

In the early war years, the company mainly repaired bicycles. Caused by the war, neither fuel nor production material was available, so that old military trucks and wood <b>gas</b> <b>motors</b> had to be used to produce new tractors in the first post war years. The regular tractor production using the frameless block construction method began after the monetary reform in West Germany in 1948. At this time, Wesseler had 10 employees.|$|R

A further blow to the V&S came in 1913 when the BC Electric Railway company built an interurban railroad to Deep Bay(now Deep Cove) in North Saanich, supplementing its well established streetcar lines {{in the city of}} Victoria. The BCER offered a more frequent and continuous passenger service than the V&S could provide with its old run down equipment. Business on the V&S briefly picked up and the competition between the two railways was intense and the Great Northern replaced the old wooden coaches on the V&S with a modern <b>gas</b> <b>motor</b> car built by the McKeen Motorcar company.|$|E

Due to frequent failures of the rotation system, the revolving optic assembly was removed and a 500 mm cut-and-polished drum optic was placed in position in 1978. The DA gas burner {{was replaced by a}} DA gas flasher with sun valve. This reduced the consumption of DA gas but the intensity of the light went down.|$|E
