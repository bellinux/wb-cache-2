5|$|About twenty {{teeth and}} a jaw {{fragment}} have {{been referred to}} Ferugliotherium, but the assignment {{of many of these}} is controversial or has been superseded. The upper and lower incisors are long and rodent-like and have enamel on only one side of the crown. A fragment of the lower jaw shows that the tooth socket of the lower incisor was very long, extending below the fourth premolar (p4). The p4 is preserved in this fragment. It is blade-shaped and resembles multituberculate p4s. However, the determination of this fossil as Ferugliotherium is in question. The <b>identity</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> few additional isolated premolars assigned to Ferugliotherium, some resembling multituberculates, is also uncertain. The first lower molariform (molar-like tooth; mf1) is known from four examples, of which two were originally identified as upper molars of a different species (Vucetichia gracilis), which is now considered a synonym of Ferugliotherium. They bear two longitudinal rows of three or four cusps and transverse crests and furrows. A single example each of the second lower (mf2) and first upper molariform (MF1) show that these teeth also had longitudinal cusp rows and transverse furrows and crests, but the mf2 had only two or perhaps three cusps per row and the MF1 had three longitudinal rows.|$|E

5|$|Set reveals to the Resistance {{that the}} Nazis' {{discovery}} {{of one of}} the Da'at Yichud caches, which included advanced technology centuries ahead of its time, is what allowed Germany to surpass the Allies in military might and ultimately win the war. Set agrees to assist the Resistance by revealing the location of one such cache, but states that the Resistance requires a U-boat to access it. Blazkowicz obtains a U-boat, but discovers that it is the flagship of the Nazis' submarine fleet, and is equipped with a cannon designed to fire nuclear warheads, which requires codes from the Nazi lunar research facility to operate. Blazkowicz uses the technology found in the Da'at Yichud cache, namely the Spindly Torque—a sphere that destroys the super-concrete—to steal the <b>identity</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> Nazi Lunar scientist and infiltrate the Lunar Base.

40|$|The notion <b>of</b> <b>identity</b> is {{investigated}} through Aristotle and Hegel as {{supporters of}} two different ontological conceptions: pluralism of substances and relational holism. Through Aristotle, I examine both the thesis according to which the <b>identity</b> <b>of</b> <b>an</b> object is constituted by its properties and the difficulties which this thesis encounters (e. g., those raised by Max Black). Aristotle easily defines the identity in species, in genus, and in number; some problems arise regarding the <b>identity</b> <b>of</b> individuals: for these, {{it is not enough}} to indicate the definition and the proper qualities, but matter is needed. Matter cannot, however, be a criterion for identifying duplicate objects: in this case, it plays at most the role <b>of</b> <b>a</b> "weak individuator" A weak individuator involves relations with other entities. The use of relations in determining the <b>identity</b> <b>of</b> <b>an</b> entity is extensively treated by Hegel, according to whom, in order to define the <b>identity</b> <b>of</b> <b>an</b> object <b>a</b> multiplicity <b>of</b> particular objects is required and, therefore, relations among entities.
