5000|$|After its auspicious launch, {{the hotel}} closed {{temporarily}} in the 1920s, {{until it was}} purchased in 1925 by the Santa Fe Railway. The new owners commissioned local muralists to paint the interior walls, beginning La Fonda's longstanding support of local visual arts. Mary Colter redesigned the hotel's <b>interior,</b> <b>setting</b> a tone inspired by Spanish and Southwest Native American aesthetics that continues today. Her designs included exposed vigas, or ceiling beams, and Mexican tiles.|$|E
50|$|The Wine Glass (also The Glass of Wine or Lady and Gentleman Drinking Wine, Het glas wijn) is a 1660 {{painting}} by Johannes Vermeer {{now in the}} Gemäldegalerie, Berlin. It portrays a seated woman and a standing man drinking in an <b>interior</b> <b>setting.</b> The work contains the conventions of genre painting of the Delft School developed by Pieter de Hooch in the late 1650s. It contains figures situated in a brightly lit and spacious interior, while its architectural space is highly defined. The figures are set in the middle ground, rather than positioned in the foreground.|$|E
50|$|In December, {{the crew}} {{traveled}} to Australia, where production occupied eight sound stages at the Village Roadshow Studios in Brisbane, Queensland. At Stage 5, the Singh Pirates Cave was constructed, constituting the largest <b>interior</b> <b>setting</b> ever {{built in the}} country. The New York offices of Xander Drax were constructed on Stage 6. Filming in Queensland also took the production to the Brisbane City Hall, where the interior lobby was redecorated to resemble a New York museum, where Kit Walker finds {{one of the three}} Skulls of Touganda.

50|$|Following the {{contemporary}} styles of illustration seen in other manuscripts, early copies had mostly fairly small scenes, normally with a patterned background {{rather than a}} landscape or <b>interior</b> <b>setting.</b> In front of this a number of figures were engaged in key historical moments, especially battles, coronations, weddings and important meetings. There might be over 200 such scenes illustrated, often collected together as individual compartments in a full-page miniature with a decorated framework. By the mid-15th century the number of illustrations was fewer, around 50 even in lavish copies, but the miniatures were larger, and now had lovingly detailed landscape or interior backgrounds. Scenes of ceremonial moments, now often including large crowds, had become more popular, though battles retained their place.|$|E
50|$|It shows a nude woman {{taking a}} sponge bath in an <b>interior</b> <b>setting</b> {{accompanied}} by a maid in a red gown. The woman preserves her modesty with a wash cloth held in her left hand as she reaches with her right towards a basin placed on a side-table. A convex mirror hangs from a central bar in the shuttered window above the basin, and shows the reflection of both figures. In the tradition of such scenes, the mirror symbolises virtue and purity, while the dog in the lower center at the woman's feet - barely visible in the Fogg panel due to loss of paint, but more distinguishable in van der Geest's work - represents her fidelity. Her bedchamber is richly detailed; there is a wooden bed to the right, a tall folding chair against the back wall, and wooden beams running across the ceiling. An orange rests on the windowsill and there are discarded pattens {{on the floor in}} the lower left corner.|$|E
5000|$|Nude with Apple, in the {{collection}} of the Brooklyn Museum, is a signature work of Glackens’ post-Ashcan career. It is said to represent the turning point in his style and his division with The Eight. It depicts a model resting on a couch, holding an apple. [...] "The model's slightly weary but forthright expression, and even the ribbon tied around her neck, call to mind Manet's Olympia...a modern Eve." [...] A humorously incongruous touch is her hat, placed on the couch next to her unclothed body as if she had just arrived or was preparing soon to leave. The languid pose, the comfortable <b>interior</b> <b>setting,</b> and the notable attention paid to bright, vivid colors set this painting apart from those of the Ashcan painters. It is interesting to compare the finished work to an earlier study in pastel. Glackens' working method included making numbers of sketches which focused on separate elements of the composition.|$|E
50|$|The {{majority}} of interior scenes are {{shot in the}} adjoining purpose-built studio, Stage One.

5000|$|With an oblong table, {{the artist}} had {{to decide whether to}} show the apostles on both sides, so with some seen from behind, or all {{on one side of the}} table facing the viewer. Sometimes only Judas is on the side nearest the viewer, {{allowing}} the bag to be seen. The placement on both sides was further complicated when halos were obligatory; was the halo to be placed as though in front of the rear-facing apostles faces, or as though fixed to the back of their head, obscuring the view? Duccio, daringly for the time, just omits the halos of the apostles nearest the viewer. As artists became increasingly interested in realism and the depiction of space, a three-sided <b>interior</b> <b>setting</b> became more clearly shown and elaborate, sometimes with a landscape view behind, as in the wall-paintings by Leonardo da Vinci and Perugino. [...] Artists who showed the scene on a ceiling or in a relief sculpture had further difficulties in devising a composition.|$|E
5000|$|They {{set up a}} depot at Mount Arden (north of Quorn), {{and then}} Eyre started for the <b>interior,</b> <b>setting</b> out on horseback {{with one of his}} Aboriginal assistants and a pack horse to carry provisions, preferring not to subject the others to the {{difficulties}} and hazards of exploring unknown country. After 16 days fruitlessly {{trying to find a way}} to the interior, he returned. While Eyre was exploring, Scott was in charge of the depot, collected botanical and geological specimens, and took the routine observations three times a day. The party then moved from Mount Arden to Depot Pool, from which point Eyre again struck out for the interior. He followed Mount Deception Range, examining the watercourses, one of which he named the Scott. Failing to find a way to the centre of the continent, Eyre returned to Depot Pool. Here he rested for a time, and then made another attempt by another route. On 21 or 22 August Eyre wrote: — [...] "Not having seen the native for the last two days I thought I might venture to explore the watercourse we were encamped upon, and set off on horseback immediately after breakfast, accompanied by Mr. Scott. ... Having tied up our horses Mr. Scott and I ascended to the top of the high cliff by winding along the ridges at the back of it. From its summit we had an extensive view, and I was enabled to take several angles. One of these high peaks, in the Mount Deception Range, I named the Scott. ... In the course of the morning Mr. Scott shot a rock wallaby of rather a large species, and many more were seen about the high, perpendicular cliffs, under which we had found water." [...] A few days later Eyre found another watercourse, which her named the Mundy. Eyre ascended Mt. Hopeless on 2 September and returned to the base depot.|$|E

In this project, two laboratories were visually examined to observe the impact of light on an <b>interior</b> <b>setting.</b> Extensive literature findings were implemented to generate a design proposal that would best fit for each laboratory site.
