5|$|In {{the early}} 1920s, {{there was an}} {{outbreak}} of a previously unrecognized cattle disease in the northern United States and Canada. Cattle were haemorrhaging after minor procedures and on some occasions, spontaneously. For example, 21 out of 22 cows died after <b>dehorning</b> and 12 out of 25 bulls died after castration. All of these animals had bled to death.|$|E
25|$|The primary screwworm, C. hominivorax, is a {{parasitic}} species, whose larvae are {{renowned for}} eating and infesting {{the flesh of}} living organisms, primarily warm-blooded animals such as cattle and other livestock. Their larvae cause myiasis, or an infestation of maggots, in lesions or other wounds and injuries that the host animal may have. Fly strikes may occur due to such farming processes as branding, castrating, <b>dehorning,</b> and tailing of the host animals. These processes, along with barbed-wire cuts and flea bites, lead to myiasis in the host animal. Navels of newborns also can be the sites of infestation. C. hominivorax tends to reproduce only on the flesh of a living host. Unlike most other maggots, these maggots attack and consume healthy living tissue along with decaying tissue (hominivorax literally translates to “man-eating”). The larvae are responsible for their common name, the screwworm, because they possess small spines on each body segment that resemble a screw’s threads. After the larvae hatch, they dive into the wound and burrow deeper, perpendicular to the skin surface, eating into live flesh, again resembling a screw being driven into an object. The larvae then continue to feed on the wound fluids and the animal’s tissue.|$|E

2500|$|Negative {{emotional}} {{states are}} associated with a bias toward negative (pessimistic) responses towards ambiguous cues in judgement tasks – as encapsulated in the question of [...] "is the glass half empty or half full?". [...] After separation from their mothers, Holstein calves showed such a cognitive bias indicative of low mood. [...] A similar study showed that after hot-iron disbudding (<b>dehorning),</b> calves had a similar negative bias indicating that post-operative pain following this routine procedure results in a negative change in emotional state.|$|E
2500|$|Cattle {{are often}} raised by {{allowing}} herds to graze on the grasses of {{large tracts of}} rangeland. Raising cattle in this manner allows the use of land that might be unsuitable for growing crops. The most common interactions with cattle involve daily feeding, cleaning and milking. Many routine husbandry practices involve ear tagging, <b>dehorning,</b> loading, medical operations, vaccinations and hoof care, as well as training for agricultural shows and preparations. Also, some cultural differences occur in working with cattle; the cattle husbandry of Fulani men rests on behavioural techniques, whereas in Europe, cattle are controlled primarily by physical means, such as fences. [...] Breeders use cattle husbandry to reduce M. bovis infection susceptibility by selective breeding and maintaining herd health to avoid concurrent disease.|$|E
2500|$|Other common {{elective}} {{surgical procedures}} in the United States are declawing in cats (onychectomy), ear-cropping in dogs, tail docking in dogs, horses, and dairy cattle, and Livestock <b>dehorning</b> in cattle, sheep, and goats. [...] These procedures have been controversial and recently debated among breeders, veterinary organizations, and animal welfare scientists. The controversy is different for each procedure, but issues arise based on reasons to perform the procedure, differing opinions on techniques and methods, perceived long-term benefits in individual animals, {{and the development of}} alternatives. Declawing, for example, consists of removal of the distal phalanges using either a scalpel, scissors or laser. It is typically performed to prevent property damage in house cats, but may also be performed in purebred dogs to meet certain show requirements. Some procedures are illegal in some countries (in the UK, declawing is illegal and tail docking is only allowed in working dogs) and face ethical challenges in others.|$|E

5000|$|The {{animal to}} be dehorned is usually restrained, either using a <b>dehorning</b> table or with {{chemical}} restraint —sedation.

Smaller animals like sheep and goats may be restrained by hand or with use of halters.|$|E
50|$|Polled Holsteins are {{becoming}} more popular and frequently seen. Farmers understand the polled trait more and often benefit from having polled Holsteins in their herd. Horned Holsteins require <b>dehorning</b> at {{a few months of}} age to prevent growth of horns which can pose a threat to farmers and cattle handlers. <b>Dehorning</b> costs about $2 per calf. Holsteins with horns can also be more aggressive to fellow cows and cause severe injury to other cows within proximity. <b>Dehorning</b> Holstein calves costs money so having polled cows will save money. Another reason farmers prefer polled Holsteins is for the consumers. Consumers view <b>dehorning</b> as a painful process to calves and often animal welfare issues may arise or public intervention. Having polled Holsteins removes stress of consumers which ultimately benefits farmers.|$|E

40|$|This study {{aimed to}} {{evaluate}} the behavior of beef calves during the traditional and rational methods (focusing animal welfare). There were observed of 272 Nelore calves submitted to the proceedings of vaccination, marked and <b>dehorn.</b> During observations was measured the numbers of accidents and/or delay during the proceedings {{and if there was}} any difference between male or female. Accident was considered all action that delayed the work and offered any animal or personal risk. Data showed that rational method decrease accidents to animals (58 vs. 24, P < 0. 05), as well reduced the time lost per animal (65. 2 seconds vs. 29. 8 seconds, P < 0. 05). Female calves had more accidents than male calves (59 % vs. 41 %, P < 0. 05).

40|$|Abstract Background Castration of male calves {{destined for}} beef {{production}} {{is a common}} management practice performed in the United States amounting to approximately 15 million procedures per year. Societal concern about the moral and {{ethical treatment of animals}} is increasing. Therefore, production agriculture is faced with the challenge of formulating animal welfare policies relating to routine management practices such as castration. To enable the livestock industry to effectively respond to these challenges {{there is a need for}} more data on management practices that are commonly used in cattle production systems. The objective of this survey was to describe castration methods, adverse events and husbandry procedures performed by U. S. veterinarians at the time of castration. Invitations to participate in the survey were sent to email addresses of 1, 669 members of the American Association of Bovine Practitioners and 303 members of the Academy of Veterinary Consultants. Results After partially completed surveys and missing data were omitted, 189 responses were included in the analysis. Surgical castration with a scalpel followed by testicular removal by twisting (calves 90 kg) was the most common method of castration used. The potential risk of injury to the operator, size of the calf, handling facilities and experience with the technique were the most important considerations used to determine the method of castration used. Swelling, stiffness and increased lying time were the most prevalent adverse events observed following castration. One in five practitioners report using an analgesic or local anesthetic at the time of castration. Approximately 90 % of respondents indicated that they vaccinate and <b>dehorn</b> calves at the time of castration. Over half the respondents use disinfectants, prophylactic antimicrobials and tetanus toxoid to reduce complications following castration. Conclusions The results of this survey describe current methods of castration and associated management practices employed by bovine veterinarians in the U. S. Such data are needed to guide future animal well-being research, the outcomes of which can be used to develop industry-relevant welfare guidelines. </p...|$|R

50|$|In 2007, the U.S. Department of Agriculture's (USDA) National Animal Health Monitoring System (NAHMS) survey {{suggested}} that most cattle in the U.S. were disbudded or dehorned {{without the use}} of anesthesia at that time.

While animal rights groups, like the Humane Society of the United States, condemn the practice of <b>dehorning,</b> ending it would mean increased horn-related injuries to cattle and humans. Polled genetics, long a staple in beef cattle breeding are becoming more popular among dairy farmers, with more polled calves being born to dairy cattle every year.
