The band described the recording process as relaxed, in contrast to the tense sessions for Kid A and Amnesiac.|$|E

Allen, marking the first chapter in a decades-long history of collaboration between Allen and Band. The alien spacecraft model featured in Laserblast was designed and built by Greg Jein <b>in</b> <b>two</b> <b>weeks,</b> and the musical score was written in five days by Joel Goldsmith and Richard Band, the first film score for both composers.|$|E
5|$|The {{urgency of}} the threat to Pusan Perimeter {{prompted}} the US Marine Corps 1st Provisional Marine Brigade to be brought in to reinforce the US Army troops. <b>In</b> <b>two</b> <b>weeks</b> of heavy fighting, the US forces were able to force the North Koreans out of the Naktong Bulge region. The North Koreans were further repulsed after the UN counterattack at Inchon, which culminated in the virtual destruction of the North Korean army.|$|E
5|$|A {{match against}} Surrey started {{the day after}} the Second Test ended, but Bradman {{nevertheless}} asked Toshack to bowl 20 overs as Surrey batted first.

On that occasion school administrators sent students home as a precaution.|$|E
5|$|Before Game of Thrones both Benioff and Weiss {{worked in}} film, and were {{unfamiliar}} with {{working on a}} television show. This resulted in several first-season episodes being about 10 minutes too short for HBO, forcing them to write another 100 pages of scripts <b>in</b> <b>two</b> <b>weeks.</b> Due to lack of budget the new scenes were designed to be inexpensive to film, such as two actors conversing in one room. Benioff and Weiss noted {{that some of their}} favorite scenes from the first season were the results of the dilemma, including one between Robert and Cersei Baratheon discussing their marriage.|$|E
5|$|Fifteen {{weeks of}} {{principal}} photography commenced on 1 July 1968 at Pinewood Studios, Buckinghamshire; shooting wrapped on 16 October having run alongside that for Joe 90. In September, location shooting in Albufeira, Portugal was accelerated for completion <b>in</b> <b>two</b> <b>weeks</b> {{as opposed to}} a month after politician Marcello Caetano deposed incapacitated Prime Minister Antonio Salazar, Parrish fearing that the coup d'état would cause the production of Doppelgänger to fall behind schedule. Filming in Borehamwood, Hertfordshire used the exterior of Neptune House (now part of the BBC's Elstree Studios) as a double for EUROSEC Headquarters in Portugal. Heatherden Hall (part of the Pinewood complex) appears as the old Webb's nursing home.|$|E

5|$|Following their {{tour with}} Elliot Minor, {{the writing process}} for the new album began. Although all the music's writing was {{credited}} to the entire band, vocalist Josh Franceschi and guitarist Max Helyer were usually the biggest creative forces among the group, being responsible for the ideas behind the songs. The band's work resulted in the album having a sound that most critics associated with pop punk, though this result was unintended. The album was recorded <b>in</b> <b>two</b> <b>weeks</b> at Outhouse Studios in Reading, Berkshire with producers Matt O'Grady and John Mitchell.|$|E
5|$|Goldfingers $3 {{million budget}} was recouped <b>in</b> <b>two</b> <b>weeks,</b> and it broke box office records in {{multiple}} {{countries around the}} world. The Guinness Book of World Records went on to list Goldfinger as the fastest grossing film of all time. Demand for the film was so high that the DeMille cinema in New York City had to stay open twenty-four hours a day. The film closed its original box office run having grossed $23 million in the United States and $46 million worldwide. After reissues, the first being as a double feature with Dr. No in 1966, Goldfinger grossed a total of $51,081,062 in the United States and $73,800,000 elsewhere, for a total worldwide gross of $124,900,000.|$|E
5|$|Green served from 1943 to 1946, {{rising to}} the rank of Sergeant. He {{returned}} to Philadelphia in March 1946, intending to use the benefits of the G.I. Bill to attend Drexel University. He planned to major in electrical engineering, which was the field he had worked in during his time in the Army. Drexel did not have classes starting until September, so Green began to look to work. While seeking employment at Temple University Green learned that Temple had classes beginning <b>in</b> <b>two</b> <b>weeks,</b> so he decided to enroll there.|$|E

5|$|In January 2002 Eduardo Duhalde was {{appointed}} president, becoming Argentina's fifth president <b>in</b> <b>two</b> <b>weeks.</b> Roberto Lavagna, who became Minister of the Economy in April 2002, was credited for the ensuing {{recovery of the}} economy, having stabilised prices and the exchange rate in a moment when Argentina was at risk of hyperinflation. Since the default in 2001, growth has resumed, with the Argentine economy growing by over 6% a year for seven of the eight years to 2011. This was achieved {{in part because of}} a commodity price boom, and also because the government managed to keep the value of the currency low, boosting industrial exports.|$|E
5|$|In {{his early}} career Redding mostly covered songs from popular artists, such as Richard, Cooke and Solomon Burke. Around the mid-1960s he began writing his own songs—always taking along his cheap red {{acoustic}} guitar—and sometimes asked for Stax members' opinion of his lyrics. He often worked on lyrics with other musicians, such as Simms, Rodgers, Huckaby, Phil Walden and Cropper. During his recovery from his throat operation, Redding wrote about 30 songs <b>in</b> <b>two</b> <b>weeks.</b> Redding {{was the sole}} copyright holder on all of his songs.|$|E
5|$|In summer 1938, a {{state visit}} to France by the King and Queen was {{postponed}} {{for three weeks}} because {{of the death of}} the Queen's mother, Lady Strathmore. <b>In</b> <b>two</b> <b>weeks,</b> Norman Hartnell created an all-white trousseau for the Queen, who could not wear colours as she was still in mourning. The visit was designed to bolster Anglo-French solidarity in the face of aggression from Nazi Germany. The French press praised the demeanour and charm of the royal couple during the delayed but successful visit, augmented by Hartnell's wardrobe.|$|E
