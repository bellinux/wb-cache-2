5|$|Some seabird {{species have}} benefited from fisheries, {{particularly}} from discarded fish and offal. These <b>discards</b> compose 30% of the food of seabirds in the North Sea, for example, and compose up to 70% of the total food of some seabird populations. This can have other impacts; for example, {{the spread of the}} northern fulmar through the United Kingdom is attributed in part to the availability of <b>discards.</b> <b>Discards</b> generally benefit surface feeders, such as gannets and petrels, to the detriment of pursuit divers like penguins.|$|E

5|$|Compared {{to other}} deep-sea sharks, the Izak {{catshark}} {{has a large}} heart suggestive of a relatively active lifestyle. It is a generalist that feeds {{on a wide variety}} of bony fishes, crustaceans, and cephalopods; larger sharks consume proportionately more crustaceans and fewer fishes. At least some part of its recorded diet probably represents scavenging from fishery <b>discards,</b> given the presence of fast-moving, pelagic species that the shark is unlikely to have captured live. Polychaete worms, hydrozoans, gastropods, and hagfish eggs may also be occasionally ingested. This species often has nematode and flatworm parasites in its stomach.|$|E

5|$|In {{the first}} English {{translation}} of 1847 by Mary Howitt, the tale {{opens with a}} beggar woman giving a peasant's wife a barleycorn in exchange for food. Once planted, a tiny girl, Thumbelina (Tommelise), emerges from its flower. One night, Thumbelina, asleep in her walnut-shell cradle, is carried off by a toad who wants her as a bride for her son. With the help of friendly fish and a butterfly, Thumbelina escapes the toad and her son, and drifts on a lily pad until captured by a stag beetle who later <b>discards</b> her when his friends reject her company.|$|E

5|$|The fulmarine petrels are generalists, {{which for}} the most part take many species of fish and crustacea. The giant petrels, uniquely for Procellariiformes, will feed on land, eating the carrion of other seabirds and seals. They will also attack the chicks of other seabirds. The diet of the giant petrels varies {{according}} to sex, with the females taking more krill and the males more carrion. All the fulmarine petrels readily feed on fisheries <b>discards</b> at sea, a habit that has been implicated in (but not proved to have caused) the expansion in range of the northern fulmar in the Atlantic.|$|E

5|$|The {{gull-billed tern}} is an opportunist predator, taking {{a wide variety}} of prey from marine, {{freshwater}} and terrestrial habitats. Depending on what is available it will eat small crabs, fish, crayfish, grasshoppers and other large insects, lizards and amphibians. Warm-blooded prey includes mice and the eggs and chicks of other beach-breeding birds; least terns, little terns and members of its own species may be victims. The greater crested tern will also occasionally catch unusual vertebrate species such as agamid lizards and green sea turtle hatchlings, and follows trawlers for <b>discards.</b>|$|E
5|$|The procellariids are {{the most}} {{numerous}} family of tubenoses, and the most diverse. They {{range in size from}} the giant petrels, which are almost as large as the albatrosses, to the prions, which are as small as the larger storm petrels. They feed on fish, squid and crustacea, with many also taking fisheries <b>discards</b> and carrion. All species are accomplished long-distance foragers, and many undertake long trans-equatorial migrations. They are colonial breeders, exhibiting long-term mate fidelity and site philopatry. In all species, each pair lays a single egg per breeding season. Their incubation times and chick-rearing periods are exceptionally long compared to other birds.|$|E

40|$|Understanding fishers' <b>discarding</b> behaviour, and anticipating their {{reactions}} {{to changes in the}} biological or regulatory characteristics of a fishery, are important for dealing with the problem of <b>discarding.</b> In this paper, we investigate the <b>discarding</b> of haddock (Melanogrammus aeglefinus), whiting (Merlangius merlangus), and Atlantic cod (Gadus morhua) in the North Sea, using data collected by scientific observers onboard Scottish demersal vessels. We describe <b>discarding</b> on each trip by species-specific <b>discard</b> curves and explore how these curves depend on biological and regulatory variables. There are large differences in the size of <b>discarded</b> fish between inshore and offshore areas, with offshore-operating vessels <b>discarding</b> larger fish (high-grading). Increases in legal landing size correspond to immediate increases in the size of <b>discarded</b> fish, particularly for haddock and cod in inshore areas. In general, <b>discarding</b> practices for haddock and cod are similar over time and consistent across gears, whereas decisions for the lesser valued whiting are more variable and can be affected by the catch composition...|$|R

Weinsider appears to be especially distraught after hearing the news. That night, Laura has a terrifying dream in which a demon-like figure snatches the baby from her womb. When she wakes up, the couple discover that Laura has seemingly miscarried. Laura's brother, local deputy sheriff Arky Stevens, reports her story to the X-Files section at the FBI. Agent Jeffrey Spender (Chris Owens) <b>discards</b> the report, but Agent Fox Mulder (David Duchovny) salvages the case and travels to Virginia, along with Agent Dana Scully (Gillian Anderson) to interview the Weinsiders.|$|E

As Neville gives a defiant response and draws the Sword of Gryffindor from the Sorting Hat, Harry reveals he is still alive, causing the Malfoys and many other Death Eaters to abandon Voldemort as they realize he failed to kill Harry again, and any hope of victory for the Dark Lord is now a lost cause. While Harry battles Voldemort throughout the castle, Neville kills Nagini with the sword, leaving Voldemort vulnerable, and Molly Weasley kills Bellatrix in the Great Hall. Harry and Voldemort's battle ends with Voldemort's own Killing Curse rebounding and killing him, once and for all. After the battle, Harry explains to Ron and Hermione that the Elder Wand had recognised him as its true master because he had disarmed Draco, who earlier had disarmed its previous owner — Dumbledore — but, instead of claiming the Elder Wand, Harry breaks and <b>discards</b> it.|$|E

Stalling for time, Nate manages to drive the jeep over a cliff and into a lake surrounding the colony's port. Tired, injured, and grieving Sully's death, Nate decides to give up and return home. Elena convinces him to see Drake's work through, and the two work together to reach the crumbling customs house, where Nate is able to trace the statue to an inland monastery. While on reconnaissance, they discover that Roman has also found the statue with help from the supposedly-dead Sully. While in pursuit, Elena falls through a bridge and reluctantly <b>discards</b> her camera so that Nate can save her. Nate subsequently catches up to Sully and accuses him of betrayal, to which Sully reveals that he was only pretending to help, having survived Roman's bullet because of Drake's notebook in his shirt's breast-pocket preventing a fatal wound.|$|E
5|$|After Zainab and Jane {{argue in}} the street Zainab and Yusef return home. Zainab slaps Yusef after he says Kamil will be an outcast to him but Yusef slaps Zainab back.

Yusef then kidnaps Kamil, telling Zainab that he is being kept {{in a safe place}} and refuses to let Zainab see him. After about four days of not knowing, Yusef takes Zainab to a café in the High Street, where a relative returns Kamil to Zainab. During the visit, it emerges that Yusef told Bushra's family that Zainab had a nervous breakdown, which is why he needed to have Kamil looked after. When Yusef takes a call outside the café, Zainab tries to escape with Kamil through an emergency exit {{in the back of the}} shop. However, Yusef guessed her plan and was waiting for her outside the exit. As she tried to escape, Yusef warned her that he knows everything, and if she leaves him, he will kill Tamwar and Kamil. Masood races to the restaurant and secretly promises that he'll do whatever it takes to get her out of her marriage to Yusef. Zainab finally stands up to Yusef and refuses to leave for Pakistan. Yusef attacks her and after learning that Masood has Kamil, retaliates towards Yusef. Yusef drugs Zainab, and the family return to the house. Masood punches Yusef before calling the police. Afia confronts Yusef and orders him to leave. Yusef is later found by Masood at the bed and breakfast with a match and some petrol. Yusef attacks Masood and lights a fire leaving Masood for dead. Shirley Carter (Linda Henry) and Christian put the fire out but the fire is later reignited trapping Masood, Phil and Denise inside. Yusef taunts Zainab outside. Zainab lies and tells him that Afia is in the building and he runs in followed by Tamwar. Masood is later rescued and as Yusef remains upstairs he realises that Afia is in fact outside. Realising Zainab tricked him, he briefly smiles, and the floor collapses beneath him and he succumbs to the flames, killing him. The following day, firefighters retrieve his body. He leaves everything to Zainab in his will.|$|E

40|$|Anglerfish are {{valuable}} commercial species for the Spanish otter-trawl fisheries operating in ICES Sub areas VI-VII and Divisions VIIIabd. Nevertheless, <b>discard</b> data {{of these species}} have never been used in stock assessment. Most of the specimens <b>discarded</b> are juveniles, and the motive argued by skippers, interviewed on board about the reasons for <b>discarding</b> anglerfish, are the small fish size and little market value (Project 98 / 095). The Council Regulation (2406 / 96) laying down common marketing standards for certain fishery products, set a minimum landing weight of 500 g for anglerfish.
