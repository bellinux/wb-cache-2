25|$|In {{the theory}} of inflation, the rapid initial {{expansion}} of the universe is caused by a hypothetical particle called the <b>inflaton.</b> The exact properties of this particle are not fixed by the theory but should ultimately be derived from a more fundamental theory such as string theory. Indeed, {{there have been a number}} of attempts to identify an <b>inflaton</b> within the spectrum of particles described by string theory, and to study inflation using string theory. While these approaches might eventually find support in observational data such as measurements of the cosmic microwave background, the application of string theory to cosmology is still in its early stages.|$|E
25|$|In the Big Bang {{model for}} the {{formation}} of the universe, Inflationary Cosmology predicts that after about 10−37 seconds the nascent universe underwent exponential growth that smoothed out nearly all irregularities. The remaining irregularities were caused by quantum fluctuations in the <b>inflaton</b> field that caused the inflation event. Before the formation of stars and planets (after 10−6 seconds), the early universe was smaller, much hotter, and filled with a uniform glow from its white-hot fog of interacting plasma of photons, electrons, and baryons.|$|E
40|$|Inflationary models {{driven by}} {{a large number of}} axion fields are {{discussed}} in the context of type IIB compactifications with N = 1 supersymmetry. The <b>inflatons</b> arise as the scalar modes of the R-R two-forms evaluated on vanishing two-cycles in the compact geometry. The vanishing cycles are resolved by small two-volumes or NS-NS B-fields which sit together with the <b>inflatons</b> in the same supermultiplets. String world-sheets wrapping the vanishing cycles correct the metric of the R-R <b>inflatons.</b> They can help to generate kinetic terms close to the Planck scale and a mass hierarchy between the axions and their non-axionic partners during inflation. At small string coupling, D-brane corrections are subleading in the metric of the R-R <b>inflatons.</b> However, an axion potential can be generated by D 1 instantons or gaugino condensates on D 5 branes. Models with sufficiently large number of axions admit regions of chaotic inflation which can stretch over the whole axion field range for potentials from gaugino condensates. These models could allow for a possibly detectable amount of gravitational waves with tensor to scalar ratio as high as r < 0. 14...|$|R
40|$|Adopting the horizon-crossing approximation, we derive the {{spectral}} index of $f_{NL}$ in general N-flation model. Axion N-flation model {{is taken as}} a typical model for generating a large $f_{NL}$ which characterizes the size of local form bispectrum. We find that its tilt $n_{f_{NL}}$ is negligibly small when all <b>inflatons</b> have the same potential, but a negative detectable $n_{f_{NL}}$ can be achieved in the axion N-flation with different decay constants for different <b>inflatons.</b> The measurement of $n_{f_{NL}}$ {{can be used to}} support or falsify the axion N-flation in the near future.

2500|$|There {{has been}} {{considerable}} scientific research on possible {{links between the}} Higgs field and the <b>inflaton</b> – a hypothetical field suggested as the explanation {{for the expansion of}} space during the first fraction of a second of the universe (known as the [...] "inflationary epoch"). Some theories suggest that a fundamental scalar field might be responsible for this phenomenon; the Higgs field is such a field, and its existence has led to papers analysing whether it could also be the <b>inflaton</b> responsible for this exponential expansion of the universe during the Big Bang. Such theories are highly tentative and face significant problems related to unitarity, but may be viable if combined with additional features such as large non-minimal coupling, a Brans–Dicke scalar, or other [...] "new" [...] physics, and they have received treatments suggesting that Higgs inflation models are still of interest theoretically.|$|E
50|$|Just {{like every}} other quantum field, {{excitations}} of the <b>inflaton</b> field {{are expected to be}} quantized. The field quanta of the <b>inflaton</b> field is known as <b>inflaton.</b> Depending on the modeled potential energy density, the <b>inflaton</b> field's ground state {{may or may not be}} zero.|$|E
50|$|In hybrid inflation, one {{scalar field}} is {{responsible}} for most of the energy density (thus determining the rate of expansion), while another {{is responsible for}} the slow roll (thus determining the period of inflation and its termination). Thus fluctuations in the former <b>inflaton</b> would not affect inflation termination, while fluctuations in the latter would not affect the rate of expansion. Therefore, hybrid inflation is not eternal. When the second (slow-rolling) <b>inflaton</b> reaches the bottom of its potential, it changes the location of the minimum of the first inflaton's potential, which leads to a fast roll of the <b>inflaton</b> down its potential, leading to termination of inflation.|$|E

40|$|We {{present an}} {{overview}} of inflationary models derived from string theory focusing mostly on closed string moduli as <b>inflatons.</b> After a detailed discussion of the eta-problem and different approaches to address it, we describe possible ways to obtain a de Sitter vacuum with all closed string moduli stabilised. We then look for inflationary directions and present {{some of the most}} promising scenarios where the <b>inflatons</b> are either the real or the imaginary part of Kaehler moduli. We pay particular attention on extracting potential observable implications, showing how most of the scenarios predict negligible gravitational waves and could therefore be ruled out by the Planck satellite. We conclude by briefly mentioning some open challenges in string cosmology beyond deriving just inflation.

50|$|Nature of <b>inflaton</b> {{field is}} {{currently}} not known. One {{of the obstacles}} for narrowing its properties down is inability of QFTs to correctly predict vacuum energy based on particle content of a chosen theory (see vacuum catastrophe). Atkins (2012) has suggested that it is even possible that no new field is necessary, that {{a modified version of}} the Higgs field could act as an <b>inflaton.</b>|$|E

50|$|In Guth's early proposal, it {{was thought}} that the <b>inflaton</b> was the Higgs field, the field that {{explains}} the mass of the elementary particles. It is now believed by some that the <b>inflaton</b> cannot be the Higgs field although the recent discovery of the Higgs boson has increased the number of works considering the Higgs field as <b>inflaton.</b> One problem of this identification is the current tension with experimental data at the electroweak scale, which is currently under study at the Large Hadron Collider (LHC). Other models of inflation relied on the properties of Grand Unified Theories. Since the simplest models of grand unification have failed, it is now thought by many physicists that inflation will be included in a supersymmetric theory such as string theory or a supersymmetric grand unified theory. At present, while inflation is understood principally by its detailed predictions of the initial conditions for the hot early universe, the particle physics is largely ad hoc modelling. As such, although predictions of inflation have been consistent with the results of observational tests, many open questions remain.|$|E

The latter are the actors in (generalized) hybrid inflation. They rather naturally yield large field inflation, even mimicking chaotic inflation for suitable ranges of parameters.

50|$|One of {{the most}} severe {{challenges}} for inflation arises from the need for fine tuning. In new inflation, the slow-roll conditions must be satisfied for inflation to occur. The slow-roll conditions say that the <b>inflaton</b> potential must be flat (compared to the large vacuum energy) and that the <b>inflaton</b> particles must have a small mass. New inflation requires the Universe to have a scalar field with an especially flat potential and special initial conditions. However, explanations for these fine-tunings have been proposed. For example, classically scale invariant field theories, where scale invariance is broken by quantum effects, provide {{an explanation of the}} flatness of inflationary potentials, as long as the theory can be studied through perturbation theory.|$|E
40|$|Scalar decay into gravitinos is {{studied in}} the {{presence}} of D-term supersymmetry (SUSY) breaking. The gravitinos produced by the decay of coherent oscillations of scalar fields, such as moduli and <b>inflatons,</b> cause cosmological problems. We show the general formula for the partial decay rate of the scalar into two gravitinos. Applying it to a concrete model of D-term SUSY breaking, we find that D-term SUSY breaking can suppress gravitino production. Comment: 23 pages, 1 table, 3 figures; minor changes for version...|$|R
40|$|We {{construct}} a multi-field inflationary model consisting of multiple Kähler moduli derived from type IIB string compactification {{in the large}} volume limit. The model consists of both heavy and light fields, with the former being frozen during the inflationary period and the latter acting as the <b>inflaton(s).</b> We study the evolution of all the fields during and after inflation until the preheating era when all the fields oscillate around their vacuum expectation values. Our numerical analysis shows that the curvature perturbations have an almost scale invariant power spectrum with n_s ≃ 0. 96. Comment: 25 pages, 17 figure...|$|R
40|$|We {{discuss a}} corpuscular {{resolution}} of inflation. In our treatment, the geometric background {{is viewed as}} a composite entity, a type of a coherent state, of the constituent gravitons and <b>inflatons.</b> We show that this picture accounts for all the known semi-classical results, but more importantly predicts new quantum effects that are unaccounted neither by standard loop correction nor by known semi-classical non-perturbative effects. These new effects have important consequences. For example, they place an upper bound on the duration of inflation, which is in conflict with the possibility of self-reproduction and eternal inflation. We discuss various implications of these new quantum phenomena...|$|R

40|$|Supersymmetric flat {{directions}} {{can have}} a number of important consequences in the very early universe. Depending on the form of the SUSY breaking potential arising from the finite energy density at early times, coherent production of scalar condensates can result along such directions. This leads a cosmological disaster for Polonyi type flat directions with only Planck suppressed couplings, but can give rise to the baryon asymmetry for standard model flat directions. Flat directions are also natural candidates to act as <b>inflatons.</b> Achieving density fluctuations of the correct magnitude generally requires an additional hidden SUSY breaking sector. 1...|$|R
