40|$|Aim of {{this study}} was to {{estimate}} the average <b>intercalving</b> <b>period</b> of a buffalo herd/population, by using the percentage of subjects that are able to conceive within 90 days post-partum, and that, consequently, have an <b>intercalving</b> <b>period</b> lower than 400 days, in order to give a precocious judgment on its fertility. A total number of 8, 845 intercalving periods were recorded in 4 farms and 4 Provinces of Campania and Lazio Regions. In all the farms the out of breeding season mating technique was adopted and a constant diet was administered throughout the year. Values were grouped for primiparous and pluriparous buffaloes and were divided in four calving periods: January-March; April-June; July-September; October-December. Within each group/farm ANOVA was performed and the means were analysed by t Student test. In each group the mean value and the percentage of subjects with an <b>intercalving</b> <b>period</b> lower than 400 days (% < 400 days) were calculated and the regression analysis was carried out between the values of the intercalving periods and the % < 400 days. Finally, an all-in regression analysis was performed by using the data of 55 groups, excluding those with less than 25 values. The regression analysis between % < 400 days and the mean value of the <b>intercalving</b> <b>period</b> was always significant, except in one case. The comparison between the real values and those calculated allows to affirm that, if the percentage of subjects with an <b>intercalving</b> <b>period</b> lower than 400 days is higher than 50 %, an <b>intercalving</b> <b>period</b> lower than 450 days will be probably recorded...|$|E

40|$|Buffalo species show a {{tendency}} to a seasonal reproductive activity {{and it can be}} considered a “short day” species. Oestrus cycles occur throughout the year but the frequency of anoestrus and ovarian inactivity is higher and fertility is lower when daylight hours increase. Unfortunately, seasonal reproduction cause an increase of milk availability in autumn winter period while in Italy milk market demand increase in the spring summer period. To avoid market problem, the out of breeding season mating technique is widely applied in Italy and animals are forced to bred mainly in the spring-summer period. Its employment, however, cause longer <b>intercalving</b> <b>periods,</b> a consequent decline in herd fertility and higher culling rate.

40|$|The {{season of}} calving {{affected}} calving interval, weaner weight per cow per year, dam weights at mating, parturition and weaning, and dam weight changes during gestation and lactation. The year of calving influenced calving interval, calf survival, weaner weight per 100 kg of cow weight per year, dam weight at parturition and dam weight changes during pregnancy. Dam fertility affected dam weight at mating and dam weight changes during pregnancy. Cow reproductive status significantly influenced calving interval, cow productivity indices, dam weights and dam weight changes. Calf survival was also affected by birth weight, lighter calves being {{less likely to}} survive from birth to weaning. Calving in the winter led to much shorter <b>intercalving</b> <b>periods</b> than calving in the summer. Cows that calved in one year tended to skip calving the next year more often than those that failed to calve. Winter-calving cows were more efficient producers than summer-calving cows.

40|$|The aim of {{this study}} was to {{describe}} the back fat thickness and the variation in back fat thickness as an indication of the energy balance in dairy cows. For this reason 11, 055 cows of ten herds were investigated at regular intervals from 18 to 42 days by ultrasound scan. From this data collection results 85, 049 measures. These values were subsequently related to production variables to set limits usable in dairy herd management. The difference between net energy intake and net energy output is determining the energy balance. Therefore the energy balance is influenced by parity, dairy mass intake, time in lactation and milk yield. To avoid postpartal depression in performance the back fat thickness at dry off should be between 22 and 24 mm in herd average. With starting the lactation, the cows are in negative energy balance. This affects a decrease of back fat thickness down to 5 mm in some cows. The mean value of the herd should not be lower than 14 mm in early lactation. With the increase of the DMI and the decrease in milk yield in later lactation the fat reserve will be restored. This could be a reason for adiposis in herds with low production. Optimal conditions should be prepared until the beginning of dry period. Therefore the adequate feeding should be focused in the later lactation. The variation in back fat thickness is estimated from two ultrasonographic measures and the days in between. An interval of 26 to 30 days is the best period between two measures. Shorter periods lead to unacceptable findings in work. Longer intervals result in an inaccurate estimation of the mean value. During the dry period the daily variation in back fat thickness should be between 0. 0 and 0. 05 mm. Higher rates of anabolism in fat are connected with an increase of milk yield in early lactation but should be critically treated together with the backfat thickness. This should not be about 35 mm. Because of the reduced DMI and the increase of energy demand heifers start to lose condition 40 to 30 days before calving. The postpartal nadir affects a daily change in back fat thickness of about 0. 16 mm in herd average. A higher rise in lipolyses causes a decrease of reproductiveness. The nadir of the negative energy balance is between day 30 and 40 after parturition. After 110 days in milk the restore of fat depots should be started to prepare for the next lactation period. There are strong correlations between milk yield and change in back fat thickness. A high milk yield in early lactation causes a high energy deficit. High producing cows catabolism can use up 0. 2 mm of back fat per day. A higher rise in lipolyses leads to a significantly reduced reproductiveness. The increase of the daily change in back fat thickness from - 0. 15 to - 0. 2 mm doubles the interval to first insemination. Likewise the <b>intercalving</b> <b>periods</b> degrades as well as the number of inseminations till the pregnancy. Despite of high milk yield an efficient herd management can offset depression in fertility. Milk solids secretion is strongly related to energy balance. Especially the milk protein content in early lactation has a significant correlation to the variation in back fat thickness. An average of milk protein below 3, 1 % is an indicator of an extreme energy deficit. These cows can lose up to 0. 2 mm of their back fat thickness a day. The milk fat content is not strongly related to energy balance. The ultrasound scan of the back fat thickness can be an useful method to observe the condition in dairy cows. To solve problems in dairy herd management the variation in back fat thickness is more suitable. For this purpose standard curves throughout lactation of this experiment can be used...|$|R

40|$|Abstract: High {{milk yield}} {{characteristics}} with insufficient emphasis on traits relating to health in dairy cows {{increases the risk}} of suffering from reproductive problems, which represent one of the welfare indicators. This paper considers the most common problems of reproduction in large capacity dairy farms in Serbia in the light of their effects on the welfare of cows. Data on reproduction parameters, prepartal and postpartal reproductive disorders in total 3865 Holstein-Friesian cows held in tied system were collected. Rearing conditions in all farms were similar regarding housing and nutrition, and differences existed in some management procedures. Results pointed on prolonged <b>intercalving</b> <b>period,</b> interval from calving to the first artificial insemination, and extended service period (average values: 15. 6 month, 98. 46 days and 180. 94 days, respectively), and increased insemination index (2. 65). The most frequent reproductive disorders were ovarian hypofunction, insuficiencia corpora lutea and endometritis (31. 18 %, 17. 54 % and 14. 31 %, respectively). Due to reproductive disorders 7. 6 % of cows were culled. Condition on the farms in respect to the reproduction is commonly related to the intensive production and tied system. Risk related to the occurrence of reproductive problems is multifactorial, and associated with the housing conditions, nutrition, management and selection. Even in the tied system, improvement is possible by implementation of measures for enhancement of cows ‘ health and welfare in general, i. e. by introduction of certain changes in the rearing technology.

The parameters in this study included weight, <b>intercalving</b> <b>period</b> and conception rates of cows, as well as birth weight, weaning weight and weight gain of calves. The experiment consisted of three trials. Trial 1 involved Bonsmara cows with four dietary supplementation groups. These were control, phosphorus supplementation all year round, phosphorus supplementation in the summer months and summer phosphorus supplementation with a winter lick. Trial 2 dealt with Bonsmara cows and included two dietary supplementation groups, namely control and phosphorus supplementation all year round. Trial 3 compared four different breeds (Afrikaner, Simmentaler, Nguni and Bonsmara) and included two dietary supplementation groups, notably a control group and a Kimtrafos 12 P supplementation all year round. Phosphorus supplementation had no significant effect on cow weight in Trial 1 (p > 0. 1), but was significant in Trial 2 (p< 0. 001) with the supplemented group performing better than the control group. In Trial 3, phosphorus supplementation had a varied effect on cow weight, because it only had an effect for the months of June to November (p< 0. 05). Phosphorus supplementation had no significant effect on birth weight {{in any of the}} trials. Treatment did however either show a tendency towards significance or was significant for weaning weight and weight gain in Trial 2 (p= 0. 0272 and p= 0. 0524 respectively) and Trial 3 (p= 0. 0587 and p= 0. 0464 respectivey), with the treated groups performing better than the control groups.

40|$|Over a {{thirteen}} month period, 1793 liver biopsies {{and blood}} samples from dairy cows {{during the first}} and third to fifth week of lactation were taken from seven different dairy farms in Sachsen and Thüringen. Liver biopsies were taken monthly from every single farm from up to ten dairy cows out of both stages of lactation. Additional to that on farm 2 liver biopsies were taken from up to ten dairy cows on a weekly basis. The liver fat content of the individual samples was estimated by the copper sulphate test. Liver biopsy samples of one investigation unit were pooled and the liver fat content of the pooled sample was estimated gravimetrically. The serum parameters &# 946;-hydroxy-butyric acid, bilirubin, phosphorus, ASAT, GLDH und &# 947;-GT were determined in the laboratory. Dairy cows {{in the first week of}} lactation showed significantly (p< 0, 05) higher liver fat content than those in the third to fifth week of lactation. The liver fat content increased continuously from the time of calving until it reached its peak on the seventh day post partum. From the beginning of the third until the end of the fifth week, the liver fat content then decreased continuously. The average liver fat content in autumn was significantly (p< 0, 05) below the average liver fat content in winter and spring. Those animals who were in their third or a higher lactation showed a significant (p< 0, 05) higher liver fat content than those in their first or second lactation. Liver fat content could be correlated to the following measured serum parameters; ß-hydroxy-butyric acid (r= 0, 440), bilirubin (r= 0, 333), ASAT (r= 0, 246), GLDH (r= 0, 156) and &# 947;-GT (r= 0, 182). Additionally, liver fat content could be correlated to the 100 -day milk yield (r= 0, 145), the milk fat content (r= 0, 064), the milk protein content (r=- 0, 175), service interval (r= 0, 059) and <b>intercalving</b> <b>period</b> (r= 0, 069) revealed significant (p< 0, 05). For further analysis, the dairy cows were classified into three categories according to their liver fat content: low liver fat content 5 - 8, 5 %, moderate fatty liver 12 - 15, 5 % and massive fatty liver 19 - 29, 5 %. Within these categories significant (p< 0, 05) differences were statistically determined for the 100 -day milk yield, the milk fat content, milk protein content and the service interval. Significantly (p< 0, 05) higher liver fat contents were shown in cows diseased with placental retention or ketosis. Animals with a massive or moderate fatty liver revealed a significantly (p< 0, 05) higher death rate. In all seven dairy farms the liver biopsy and the liver fat estimation were introduced in the herd management program without any concern for the farm management. Additional to that, the results provided helpful information for the farmers and had a positive influence on the evaluation of the herd. The liver fat estimation allowed a convincing evaluation of the milk yield, the reproductive performance, the disease process and the total loss on a dairy farm. The copper sulphate test proved itself as being suitable for use in practice. The best time for taking a liver biopsy is between the sixth and tenth day post partum. At that point of time the full extent of the fat mobilisation is reached and therefore the liver biopsy permits a high diagnostic reliability for feeding management and energy supply of dairy cattle.

40|$|The aim of {{the present}} study was to {{investigate}} the relation between indicators of energy balance and postpartum reproductive functions in case of high yielding dairy cows, with special attention to the re-initiation of the cyclic ovarian function during the first 100 days after calving. The investigations were accomplished during the course of one year on 361 high performace dairy cows of German Holstein breed (black and coloured skin). The average 305 -day-yield amounted to 10091 kg. As indicators of the energy balance the body mass index (BMI), the body condition score (BCS) and the back fat thickness (BFT) were selected. Additionally protein, fat and urea concentrations in the milk were also determined. The reproductive performance of the animals was established on the basis of data on oestrus, progesterone concentration in milk and fertility characteristics such as rest period, <b>intercalving</b> <b>period,</b> delayed period, pregnancy rate after first A. I. and insemination index. In order to establish a possible relationship of leptin to the energy balance and the re-initiation of ovarian cycle post-partum, the leptin concentration in the blood plasma was determined in 24 selected animals. The milk fat content of first milk yield control averaged 4. 8 % and the protein content of the 100 -day-yield averaged 3. 2 %. The fat-protein-quotient (FPQ) at the onset of lactation stood at 1. 5. The back fat thickness values of the animals of the herd were clearly below the reference curve of STAUFENBIEL and SCHROEDER (2004). In 38. 4 % of the cases, the results of the visual oestrous control were in accordance with the results of the milk progesterone concentration. More ovarian cycles could be captured with the help of the progesterone analysis than with the visual oestrus control. In 17. 7 % of the experimental animals a first progesterone increase was determined after more than 50 days post partum. However, in only 51. 2 % of the experimental animals the first progesterone rise occurred within the first 45 days p. p. which was also followed by regular cycles. All other animals showed disturbances of the ovarian cycle. Animals with comparatively high milk protein content during the 100 -day-performance showed an earlier onset of the cyclic ovarian function with few disturbances of the ovarian cycle than animals with low protein content. Frequent disturbances of the cyclic ovarian function and a delayed onset of ovarian cycle post partum were observed in cows yielding > 12000 kg milk as compared to animals with < 8000 kg milk production. In the presented study a correlation between indicators of the energy balance and the interval from calving up to the first ovarian activity could be observed. Animals with an optimal back fat thickness during the lactation period only rarely showed a delayed onset of the cyclic ovarian function or disturbances of the ovarian cycle post partum. The proportion of the animals with optimal BFT values was 40. 7 % while majority of the other animals were under-conditioned. In the present study no dependence of the leptin concentration on the development of the back fat thickness in the period between 20 to 100 days post partum could be observed. Also no influence of the leptin concentration in the period specified above was found on the re-initiation of the ovarian cycle post partum...|$|E

The study was organized in two experiment. The first experiment was conducted between 2009 to 2012 on 1088 Italian Mediterranean buffaloes underwent AI throughout. Starting from 40 Days after calving buffaloes were synchronized by the Ovsynch with timed-AI (OVSINCH-TAI). Throughout the trial overall fertility rate was meanly 75. 5 % with an <b>intercalving</b> <b>period</b> of 416  2. 4, without differences among the years. The conception rate significantly decreased progressively from the second to the seventh service. Around 66 % of mated buffaloes were pregnant within the second service and these represent the 87. 4 % of the total conceptions. A total of 3429 buffaloes were synchronized during the study. Interestingly, 28. 3 % animals did not have a functional CL (NCL) after the first GnRH and 21. 5 % were excluded on the day of AI (NMAI) because did not show signs of estrus. Therefore, 49. 8 % of buffaloes were not inseminated. The incidence of LEM registered in Period 1 was significantly higher than that in other periods. The second experiment, was performed to further evaluate the effect of the season on CL function and pregnancy rate. A total of 256 animals were selected and were mated by AI after synchronization of ovulation by the Ovsynch-TAI. Pregnancy was further assessed on day 45 after AI by ultrasonography: buffaloes with embryonic development on Day 25, but not pregnant on Day 45, were considered to have undergone late embryonic mortality. Morphology of the CL and function were assessed by ovarian ultrasonography on 39 buffaloes in each of Periods 1 and 2. Features of the CL (dimensions and blood flow parameters) were recorded on Days 10 and 20 after AI. In Period 1 (breeding season), 62. 6 % of buffaloes had embryonic development on Day 25 after AI and 58. 0 % were pregnant on Day 45, which represented a late embryonic mortality of 7. 3 %. In Period 2 (transition period), 59. 2 % of buffaloes had embryonic development on Day 25 after AI and 45. 6 % were pregnant on Day 45, which represented a late embryonic mortality of 23. For the 78 buffaloes that were intensively observed (39 in each period), 56. 4 % and 53. 8 % showed embryonic development on Day 25 after AI during the breeding season and the transition period, respectively. Pregnancy rates decreased to 53. 8 % during the breeding season and 43. 6 % during the transition period on Day 45 after AI, which reflected late embryonic mortality of 4. 5 % and 19. 0 %, respectively. Buffaloes pregnant on Day 45 after AI had greater concentrations of P 4 on Days 10 and 20 after AI in Period 1 than in Period 2. The Time Average Medium Velocity (TAMV) on Day 10 after AI was greater for buffaloes in Period 1 than in Period 2. The following data are combined for Period 1 and Period 2. The dimensions of the CL on Day 10 and Day 20 after AI were greater (P < 0. 01) for buffaloes that were pregnant on Day 45 after AI compared with buffaloes that were not pregnant.
