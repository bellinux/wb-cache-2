Os objetivos deste estudo foram: (a) simular por meio do modelo Century os efeitos de sistemas de produção de milho sob adubação orgânica e mineral sobre a dinâmica da matéria orgânica em um Argissolo Vermelho-Amarelo, e (b) comparar os estoques de C orgânico total (COT), N total (NT) e dos compartimentos de C medidos por meio de métodos de laboratório e estimados pelo modelo Century na camada {{superficial}} (0 - 20 cm). A área em estudo, sob Floresta Atlântica (FA) até o ano de 1930, foi cultivada com milho e feijão por aproximadamente 50 anos, até à instalação do experimento no ano de 1984. Os tratamentos constaram de combinações entre três doses de adubo mineral, correspondentes a de 0, 250 e 500 kg ha- 1 da fórmula 4 - 14 - 8, e duas doses de adubo orgânico (esterco bovino com palha de soja e feijão), nas doses de 0 e 40 m³ ha- 1. Os métodos de laboratório incluíram determinações do COT, <b>do</b> <b>NT,</b> <b>do</b> C da biomassa microbiana (C MIC), representando o compartimento ativo, e do C da fração leve (C FL), referenciando o compartimento lento. O compartimento passivo foi obtido por diferença. A parametrização do modelo Century foi realizada a partir dos dados obtidos no experimento e na literatura, enquanto as simulações da dinâmica do COT, NT e dos compartimentos ativo de C lento e passivo incluíram as mudanças no uso da terra ocorridas de 1930 a 2050. O modelo Century estimou diminuição nos estoques de COT, NT e dos compartimentos de C desde a derrubada da FA até o início do experimento e apenas nos tratamentos com adubação orgânica foi observada recuperação desses estoques. O CmIC e o C FL foram mais sensíveis às mudanças no manejo do que o COT, o que indica a importância desses compartimentos no estudo da dinâmica da matéria orgânica, especialmente em solos tropicais. Os estoques de COT, NT e dos compartimentos de C (lento e passivo), simulados pelo modelo Century, foram similares aos estoques medidos. Os estoques de COT (em Mg ha- 1 de C), medidos e simulados pelo modelo Century, foram bem correlacionados (R² = 0, 93; p Simulation {{models are}} essential instruments to understand {{soil organic matter}} dynamics and the turnover of its pools in tropical soils. The objectives of this study were: (a) simulate the effects of maize production systems under organic and mineral fertilization on soil organic matter dynamics of an Ultisol using the Century model; (b) to compare total carbon (TOC) and total nitrogen stocks (TN) and the carbon pools (C) measured in the laboratory and estimated by the Century model for the surface soil layer (0 - 20 cm). The study area {{had been part of}} the Atlantic Forest (FA) until 1930. After that it had been used for maize/bean production up to 1984, when the field experiment was set up. The treatments included a combination of three levels of mineral fertilizer at doses of 0, 250 and 500 kg ha- 1 of the 4 - 14 - 8 formula and two levels of organic fertilizer (animal manure with soybean and bean straw) at doses of 0 and 40 m³ ha- 1. Laboratory determinations included TOC and TN, microbial biomass C representing the active C pool and carbon of the light fraction representing the slow C pool. The passive C pool was determined by difference. The Century model was parameterized with data from the present experiment and from literature, whereas the simulations of the dynamics of TOC, TN and the active, slow, and passive pool included land use changes between 1930 and 2050. The Century model estimated a decrease in TOC, TN and the different carbon pools between the slash and burn of the Atlantic Forest until the establishment of the field experiment. Only in the treatments with organic fertilization it was observed a recovery of these pools. Biomass carbon and the carbon of the light fraction were more sensitive to changes in management than TOC. This highlights the relevance of these pools in studies of organic matter dynamics, particularly in tropical soils. Measured and simulated values of TOC (in Mg ha- 1 of C) were well correlated (R² = 0. 93; p < 0. 01). This was also observed for the active (R² = 0. 84; p < 0. 05), the slow (R² = 0. 87; p < 0. 05) and the passive (R² = 0. 91; p < 0. 05) C pools. Both measured and simulated values of TN (in Mg ha- 1 of N) were well correlated (R² = 0. 93; p < 0. 01). The Century model showed a good performance to simulate soil organic matter dynamics in tropical soils...|$|E

Stimulation of lipolytic activity in adipose tissue or inhibition of fat synthesis is one way to prevent these serious diseases. Lactic acid bacteria have an anti-obesity effect, but the mechanisms are unclear. Therefore, we evaluated the effect of the administration of lactic acid bacteria (Lactobacillus gasseri NT) on lipid metabolism and fat synthesis in a mouse high-fat-diet model, focusing on visceral fat. Balb/c mice were fed a 45 kcal % fat diet for 13 weeks with and without a freeze-dried preparation of L. gasseri NT (109 CFU/g). An ex vivo glycerol assay with periovarian fat revealed that L. gasseri <b>NT</b> <b>did</b> not stimulate lipolytic activity.

The QnCD mutants lost some α-helix and gained unordered and/or β-sheet in a length-dependent manner. These mutants were partially unfolded and rapidly assembled into soluble chain-like oligomers. In sharp contrast, the QnNT mutants largely retained wild-type tertiary structure but associated into long, fibrillar aggregates. Control proteins with glycine-serine repeats (GS 8 CD and GS 8 NT) were produced. GS 8 CD exhibited similar structural perturbations and aggregation characteristics to an analogously sized Q 16 CD, indicating that the observed effects are independent of amino acid composition. In contrast to Q 16 <b>NT,</b> GS 8 <b>NT</b> <b>did</b> not form fibrillar aggregates. Thus, soluble oligomers are produced through structural perturbation and do not require polyQ, whereas classic fibrils arise from specific polyQ intermolecular interactions in the absence of misfolding...|$|R

We have therefore designed RNA sequences that can fold into either of two mutually exclusive hairpins and have determined {{the ratio of}} folding of the two conformations, using structure probing. This folding ratio reflects their respective folding rates. Changing {{one of the two}} loop sequences from a purine- to a pyrimidine-rich loop did increase its folding rate, which corresponds well with similar observations in DNA hairpins. However, neither changing one of the loops from a regular non-GNRA tetra-loop into a stable GNRA tetra-loop, nor increasing the loop size from 4 to 6 <b>nt</b> <b>did</b> affect the folding rate. The folding kinetics of these RNAs have also been simulated with the program ‘Kinfold’. These simulations were in agreement with the experimental results if the additional stabilization energies for stable tetra-loops were not taken into account. Despite the high stability of the stable tetra-loops, they apparently do not affect folding kinetics of these RNA hairpins. These results show {{that it is possible to}} experimentally determine relative folding rates of hairpins and to use these data to improve the computer-assisted simulation of the folding kinetics of stem–loop structures...|$|R

Therefore, soil organic carbon research is gaining momentum in the Mediterranean basin. Our objective is to quantify effects of no tillage (NT) and conventional tillage (CT) on soil organic carbon stock (SOCs) in three soil types (Vertisol, Cambisol, and Luvisol) within Central Morocco. Chemical analyses {{were used to determine}} how tillage affected various humic substances. Our results showed that, after 5 years, surface horizon (0 – 30 [*]cm) SOC stocks varied between tillage systems and with soil type. The SOCs was significantly higher in NT compared to CT (10 % more in Vertisol and 8 % more in Cambisol), but no significant difference was observed in the Luvisol. Average SOCs within the 0 – 30 [*]cm depth was 29. 35 and 27. 36 [*]Mg ha− 1 under NT and CT, respectively. The highest SOCs (31. 89 [*]Mg ha− 1) was found in Vertisols under NT. A comparison of humic substances showed that humic acids and humin were significantly higher under NT compared to CT, but fulvic acid concentrations were significantly lower. These studies confirm that <b>NT</b> <b>does</b> have beneficial effects on SOCs and quality in these soils...|$|R
5000|$|The Win32 {{environment}} subsystem can run 32-bit Windows applications. It {{contains the}} console {{as well as}} text window support, shutdown and hard-error handling for all other environment subsystems. It also supports Virtual DOS Machines (VDMs), which allow MS-DOS and 16-bit Windows (Win16) applications to run on Windows NT. There is a specific MS-DOS VDM that runs in its own address space and which emulates an Intel 80486 running MS-DOS 5.0. Win16 programs, however, run in a Win16 VDM. Each program, by default, runs in the same process, thus using the same address space, and the Win16 VDM gives each program its own thread on which to run. However, Windows <b>NT</b> <b>does</b> allow users to run a Win16 program in a separate Win16 VDM, which allows the program to be preemptively multitasked, as Windows NT will pre-empt the whole VDM process, which only contains one running application. The Win32 environment subsystem process (csrss.exe) also includes the window management functionality, sometimes called a [...] "window manager". It handles input events (such as from the keyboard and mouse), then passes messages to the applications that need to receive this input. Each application is responsible for drawing or refreshing its own windows and menus, {{in response to these}} messages.|$|R
