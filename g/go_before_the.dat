5|$|The Heiress {{had been}} a Broadway play before it was a film. Richardson so liked his part {{that he decided to}} play it in the West End, with Ashcroft as Sloper's {{daughter}} Catherine. The piece was to open in February 1949 at Richardson's favourite theatre, the Haymarket. Rehearsals were chaotic. Burrell, whom Richardson had asked to direct, was not up to the task – possibly, Miller speculates, because of nervous exhaustion from the recent traumas at the Old Vic. With only a week to <b>go</b> <b>before</b> <b>the</b> first performance, the producer, Binkie Beaumont, asked him to stand down, and Gielgud was recruited in his place. Matters improved astonishingly; the production was a complete success and ran in London for 644 performances.|$|E
5|$|The Peach Bowl {{game was}} created in 1968 by the Lions Club of Atlanta {{as a means to}} attract tourism to the city. First played at Grant Field on the campus of Georgia Tech, the game was moved to Fulton County Stadium in 1971. By the mid-1980s, the Peach Bowl was facing hard times. At the time, NCAA {{guidelines}} for bowls required 75percent of gross receipts to go to participating schools, with 33percent of tickets to the game also required to go to each school. In 1983, the NCAA threatened to revoke the Peach Bowl's charter when ticket sales hovered around 25,000 with a week to <b>go</b> <b>before</b> <b>the</b> bowl. Last-minute sales saved the game, as attendance at the 1983 game climbed to 40,000 and a new television contract allowed the bowl to make a payout of $580,000 to each team. Still, the bowl's future was in doubt.|$|E

5|$|The {{refusal to}} grant {{affiliation}} caused a bitter row to ensue that showed little sign of being resolved. Despite {{not having the}} support of the governing body, the new league continued their plans regardless. No affiliation would have meant that the clubs would have problems attaining work permits for their signings and finding officials to referee their matches. The row also threatened the future of the Nottingham Panthers, as the National Ice Centre were reluctant to allow a team from an unaffiliated league hire their arena. The issue was resolved in August 2003 when the Panthers and the NIC announced an icetime agreement. The EIHL finally agreed affiliation in August 2003, with only weeks to <b>go</b> <b>before</b> <b>the</b> beginning of the new season.|$|E
5|$|With the bar full, {{the guys}} begin their routine, but are soon {{stopped by the}} police, who explain that due to zoning regulations, {{stripping}} is illegal at The Warsaw. Drew and the guys <b>go</b> <b>before</b> <b>the</b> city council, but their request is denied. Drew questions how the council can deny something without seeing it and the guys, including Lewis, decide to demonstrate their striptease routine before the council members. Their request is then approved. After performing the striptease at the bar, Drew counts out the money and finds that they have $4,800. Mr. Wick asks {{what they should do}} with the extra money and Drew replies that they should give it to the people that earned it. He then walks off stage and into the audience and starts handing out the extra cash, apologising for them having seen his naked buttocks.|$|E
5|$|At {{a session}} of the Great Council on 7 July, Andronikos' offer was accepted. The council sent notices to the Venetian colonies in the Aegean Sea—Negroponte, Nauplia, Tinos and Mykonos, and the vassal Duke of Naxos—to prepare ships to take {{possession}} of the city, while the Republic's bailo at Constantinople was instructed to secure the assent of Emperor Manuel. A week later Santo Venier and Niccolo Giorgio were named provveditori (plenipotentiary envoys) and tasked with going to Greece and, if the Despot Andronikos were still willing, take over the city and arrange for its defence by hiring mercenaries. After that, Giorgio was to <b>go</b> <b>before</b> <b>the</b> Sultan, inform him of Venice's acquisition {{of the city and}} justify it as an expedient to prevent the city from being captured by other Christians, who might have been hostile to the Sultan. The envoys were also to arrange for peace both between the Sultan and the Republic, as well as between the Sultan and Emperor Manuel. Emperor Manuel evidently gave his assent to the proposal, for on 14 September 1423 six Venetian galleys, accompanied by one Byzantine galley, entered the harbour of Thessalonica. The Venetians were greeted by a jubilant population as saviours. For the Thessalonians, Venetian rule meant not only security from the Turks—some 5,000 Ottoman troops were besieging the city—but also a secure flow of supplies.|$|E

5|$|Potter, however, did {{not feel}} he fitted into this {{increasingly}} experimental sound the band was developing and tended {{to wait until the}} others had worked out their parts during rehearsals, adding his bass lines on top at the last minute. After recording three tracks of their third album, H to He, Who Am the Only One (December 1970), he decided to quit the band. His last gig was on 9 August at the 1970 Plumpton Festival. The remaining members auditioned Dave Anderson, roadie for Brinsley Schwarz and friend of the band, but after a week's rehearsal found that things weren't working out musically. Banton, meanwhile, had become influenced by Vincent Crane's work in Atomic Rooster, where Crane played the bass lines on a Hammond organ's bass pedals and suggested that he could do this as well. With just days to <b>go</b> <b>before</b> <b>the</b> next gig, they tried rehearsing as a four-piece, and it was successful. Banton later played bass guitar on certain songs, having already learned the instrument in the mid-1960s, and Hammill expanded his instrumental capabilities on stage to cover piano and keyboards as well as guitar. Jackson modified his saxophones to be completely electric, as opposed to simply being amplified through a microphone, and combined the sound with a wah-wah pedal and an octave divider.|$|E

The West Indies Cricket Board announced that any players who signed with WSC would not be considered {{for the rest of the}} series and picked a new team captained by Alvin Kallicharran. Of the West Indies team, only Kallicharran and Derek Parry had played in the previous tests; six would be making their test debut.|$|E
25|$|Middlesbrough were on top {{for much}} of the game at Sunderland's Stadium of Light, but {{ultimately}} came away with nothing from the 2–0 defeat. Mido was set to start, but was injured in the warm-up and was replaced by the initially-benched Alves. Downing and Alves created a host of good chances but none were converted. With sixteen minutes to <b>go</b> <b>before</b> <b>the</b> final whistle, Aliadière was brought down in the penalty area, but Downing sent his penalty kick flying over the bar for his second penalty miss of the season. The visitors were punished for their inability to score when Michael Chopra scored two goals in the final ten minutes.|$|E
25|$|Attempted {{reform of}} labor {{relations}} in the mid-1970s also included severe restrictions on rights to discharge workers once they passed a brief trial period of employment. A review process set up to examine disputes was implemented {{in a way that}} made discharges practically impossible. Businesspeople circumvented the restrictions to some degree by hiring workers on a temporary basis up to the point at which they would have to be kept and then letting them <b>go</b> <b>before</b> <b>the</b> restrictions applied. Businesspeople remained unremittingly hostile to this type of regulation, primarily on the grounds that it took away their main means of exercising discipline over their workers. This form of regulation was also eliminated shortly after Velasco lost power.|$|E

With only three tour matches to <b>go</b> <b>before</b> <b>the</b> start of the One day {{international}} series, the tourists were hoping to build some momentum going into those matches. Greg Chappell won the toss, and elected to bat first, but the Australia innings was poor. McCosker fell for 2 with the score on 3. Kim Hughes fell a few overs last for 7. The wickets continued to tumble at regular intervals, with the only real resistance coming from Doug Walters (32), and Ray Bright (53). The Australians were all out for 154 in 47.5 overs.|$|E
25|$|Germany {{hosted the}} 2006 FIFA World Cup. Thirty-two nations {{competed in the}} tournament, with matches played in a dozen cities ranging from Hamburg in the north to Munich in the south; Leipzig was the only former East city to hold matches (the matches at Berlin were held at former West Berliner territory). The opening match (Germany vs Costa Rica) was held on 9 June in the Allianz Arena in Munich, with Germany {{defeating}} Costa Rica 4–2. The final match took place in Olympiastadion Berlin one month later between Italy and France. The match was drawn 1–1 at full-time and after extra time. Zinedine Zidane was controversially sent off for headbutting Italy's Marco Materazzi with 10 minutes to <b>go</b> <b>before</b> <b>the</b> match went into penalties. France lost to Italy in the shootout 5–3.|$|E
25|$|Once {{again in}} the 1925 trial matches for the Oxford side, Legge failed, {{and he was not}} {{selected}} for the first three first-class matches played by the University. He finally made his debut in the fourth game, against Worcestershire and hit 120, reaching his century in two hours; he followed that up with 40 in the second innings. He achieved little in the next two matches, but was still awarded his Blue with four weeks to <b>go</b> <b>before</b> <b>the</b> University Match after just three matches for the university. The selection was justified, as Legge topped the Oxford batting averages for the season and in the match against Cambridge scored 38 and 15 as an Oxford side packed with batsmen held out for a draw against an apparently superior Cambridge side.|$|E
