5000|$|Disc brakes {{require a}} hub built {{to accept the}} disc, and a fork (for front brakes) or frame (for rear brakes) built to accept the caliper. Front hubs {{designed}} for discs often move the left hub's flange inward {{to make room for}} the disc, which causes the <b>wheel</b> to be <b>dished.</b> A <b>dished</b> <b>wheel</b> is laterally weaker when forced to the non-disc side. Other hubs use conventional flange spacing and provide a <b>wheel</b> without <b>dish,</b> but require a less common wide-spaced fork.|$|R
50|$|Despite the 100 and 105 bodies {{being very}} similar, {{there are some}} {{exterior}} visual indications between both models. The most obvious is {{the front end of}} the vehicle often appearing lower than the rear on the 100 models, due to the IFS. The other indicator is the design of the wheels. The 100 models have almost flat wheel designs, while the 105 models have <b>dished</b> <b>wheels.</b> This difference allows both versions to retain similar wheel tracks, despite the 100 having a relatively wider axle track to allow for the IFS system.|$|R
5000|$|The {{specification}} {{of the car}} was basic. The steel <b>dish</b> <b>wheels</b> were of a thinness commonly associated with basic motorcycles and needed therefore to be pumped to a relatively high pressure. [...] The hardness of the tires and the minimalist approach taken to shock absorption made the cars strikingly uncomfortable. Except for users of cabriolet versions with the roof open, above average agility was vital for anyone wishing to get {{in or out of}} a Champion. [...] Driver fitness was also encouraged by the need to start the engine with a starting handle, there being no electric starter-motor.|$|R

40|$|AbstractThis paper reports {{aerodynamic}} testing {{results of}} various styles of bicycle wheels across yaw angles of 0 to 30 degrees. Wheels considered include disc wheels, a bladed spoke wheel and various depth <b>dished</b> <b>wheels.</b> Testing {{has been completed}} in a three quarter open jet test section wind tunnel with a anthropomorphic mannequin and rotating front and rear wheels. Data is provided as {{to the influence of}} the wheel type on the overall drag and side force, and yaw and roll moment of the rider and bicycle combination. The results demonstrate that the wheel type has a significant effect on both the aerodynamic drag and stability of the bicycle system, and that evaluation of wheel aerodynamic performance should not be based on drag alone...|$|R

5000|$|While no current-era {{automobile}} front suspension {{incorporates a}} physical king pin, {{the angle of}} the pivot points of the steering knuckle constitute a [...] "virtual king pin" [...] about which the wheels turn. This virtual king pin angle remains a fundamental design parameter. King pin angle, virtual or physical, is sometimes referred to as it's acronym KPA, or alternatively king pin inclination (KPI), or steering axis inclination, SAI. On most modern designs, the kingpin angle is set relative to the true vertical line, as viewed from the front or back of the vehicle. Kingpin inclination is non-adjustable, since it would change only if the wheel spindle or steering knuckles are bent. This has an important effect on the steering, making it tend to return to the straight ahead or centre position. This is because the straight ahead position is where the wheel is at its highest point relative to the suspended body of the vehicle - the weight of the vehicle tends to return the kingpin to this position. A second effect of the kingpin inclination is to set the scrub radius of the steered wheel. This is the offset between the tyre's contact point with the road surface and the projected axis of the steering down through the kingpin. If these points coincide, the scrub radius is zero. Zero scrub radius is possible without an inclined kingpin, but requires a deeply <b>dished</b> <b>wheel</b> so that the kingpin is at the centerline of the wheel. It is much more practical to incline the kingpin and use a less <b>dished</b> <b>wheel,</b> which also gives the self-centering effect. Zero scrub radius is not necessarily desirable - larger scrub radii lead to less steering effort (especially on vehicles without power steering), but more force applied to the steering components by road surface imperfections, braking, etc. Zero scrub radius isolates the steering from these effects but can lead to a [...] "dead" [...] feel for the driver which is undesirable, especially on performance vehicles.|$|R

Candy wheels can also be adjusted to dispense different amounts of product. Capsule wheels and gumball wheels are used to vend capsules and gumballs, respectively. For gumballs, a two-for-one wheel can be used to give customers more product for their money.|$|R

5000|$|Traxxas's first RTR Nitro truck. The Traxxas' Nitro Hawk, though {{already a}} legacy model, is highly {{collectible}} {{and are still}} being sold at toy auctions till this time. The highest recorded bid, in 2011, sold for $360.00, {{much more than the}} price of a new one.The Traxxas Nitro Hawk was a two-wheel drive stadium truck with an all-aluminum chassis that came with four different engines, the Image [...]12, the TRX12, TRX15 and Pro15 in a special long crankshaft configuration. The engine assembly was different from other traxxas models, having the clutch bell with the pinion facing against the engine, and the flywheel secured with a nut {{at the end of the}} crank with the clutch shoes facing inward. Another particularity was its shoe brake system that applied braking force on the clutch bell itself instead of having a brake disc mounted on the transmission. This truck also featured all-aluminum shocks with collars to adjust spring load and 2.2-inch lite <b>dish</b> <b>wheels</b> with pro trax ribbed tires at the front and spiked ones at the back. Common upgrades were the 360 Stinger exhaust and sturdier shock towers, since the stock fiber ones were soft.First editions had white plastic parts, body and a clear/transparent hard plastic top, purposely to be painted with the hobbyist-preferred color and are the most collectable ones.|$|R
5000|$|Goodwood (UK, 1997): Before it was {{discovered}} that the name [...] "Goodwood" [...] was controlled by the owners of the Goodwood Circuit, Land Rover had already planned production of 500 Goodwood special edition examples.

50|$|The decision, taken {{only after}} the new model had been {{prepared}} for production, not to build the Ford Cardinal in North America {{was the result of}} a review of “marketing opportunities” in the US market. In 1960 a prototype was delivered to Ford in Cologne. The form of the model that emerged from the production line at Koeln-Niehl two years later would be unchanged. The single all-red rear light cluster was seen as a tell-tale sign of the car’s US provenance at a time when independent (from brake lights) amber direction indicators were increasingly common on European cars. The <b>dished</b> steering <b>wheel</b> was another feature not normally found in European designs of the time.|$|R
5000|$|The <b>dish</b> of a <b>wheel</b> {{measures}} {{the amount of}} asymmetry between the rim and the hub flanges. To accommodate a large cassette, more space is needed on the drive side of the axle; this increases the complexity of manufacturing and truing the wheel. Tandem rear wheels tend to run a wider hub/axle to allow the right-side hub flange to be further right of wheel center and thus reduce the total <b>dish</b> of the <b>wheel.</b> Some modern tandems use a 160mm wide axle which allows a wheel that is completely [...] "dishless" [...] (i.e. symmetric). The disadvantage is this may increase the Q-factor of the stoker's cranks and may also cause [...] "heel-strike" [...] of the stoker's shoes on the chain stays. Others use shorter axles (often 145mm wide) thereby trading a little decrease in {{the strength of the}} wheel for the advantage of a similar decrease in the bending moment of the axle spindle. Rear hubs may also be threaded on the left side to allow the use of a drum brake.|$|R
50|$|Modern {{bicycles}} {{have adopted}} standard axle spacing: the hubs of front wheels are generally 100 mm wide fork spacing, road wheels with freehubs generally have a 130 mm wide rear wheel hub. Mountain bikes {{have adopted a}} 135 mm rear hub width, which allows clearance to mount a brake disc on the hub or to decrease the <b>wheel</b> <b>dish</b> for a more durable wheel. Freeride and downhill are available with 150 mm spacing.|$|R
5000|$|A {{spoke wrench}} is {{used during the}} creation, maintenance, or repair of spoked wheels to adjust the tension of the spokes. The goal common to these {{activities}} is to bring the wheel (nearer) {{to a state of}} true [...] - [...] namely, a wheel in which the rim is 1) a perfect circle concentric with the axis of the axle in the hub, and 2) planar, such that the plane of the rim is centered laterally between the two extremes of the axle where it is supported in a frame. Additionally it is to make the spoke tension as close to the same on all spokes {{on the same side of}} the wheel, and to center the rim between the locknuts of the hub (known as <b>dishing</b> the <b>wheel).</b>|$|R

50|$|Ford {{kept the}} Mach 1 alive into 1970 and little changed {{other than the}} visuals. The 1970 body {{included}} dual-beam headlights with the previous inner headlights becoming sport lamps and recessed taillights on a black honeycomb rear panel, side scoops behind both doors removed, revised bucket seats, deep <b>dish</b> sports <b>wheel</b> covers, {{as well as new}} side and rear badging and striping were the main visual differences. 1970 saw the previous 351W V8 engine options replaced with a new 351 cu in (5.8 L) Cleveland (351C) V8 in either 2V (for use with 2-venturi carbs) or 4V (for use with 4-venturi carbs) versions. The 351C 4V (M code) engine featured 11.0:1 compression and produced 300 bhp (224 kW; 304 PS) at 5400 rpm. This new performance engine incorporated elements learned from the Ford 385 series engine and the Boss 302, particularly the poly-angle combustion chambers with canted valves and the thin-wall casting technology.|$|R
5000|$|In 1957, Hindustan Motors, {{to further}} earlier {{collaboration}} with Morris Motors, who by then had become British Motor Corporation after merger with Austin Motors, entered into {{an agreement to}} manufacture 1956 Morris Oxford series III in India. All the tooling was transferred to Uttarpara plant in India. The car was rebadged as Ambassador (later called Mark 1) was launched in mid-1957 and the early model Morris Oxford series II derived Hindustan Landmaster was discontinued. The new model included deep headlamp cowls and small rear wing [...] "tail fins"— all the rage in 1956. The dashboard and steering wheel were completely redesigned. The Landmaster's flat-plane two-spoke steering wheel {{gave way to a}} <b>dished</b> steering <b>wheel</b> with three spokes made-up of four wires per spoke, for the Ambassador. Also a new, dimpled bonnet made its debut. These models had a Austin Motors derived 1476 cc side-valve petrol engine. In 1959 the side-valve engine was replaced by a 1489 cc, 55 bhp overhead-valve BMC B-series petrol engine.|$|R
5000|$|This {{progression}} {{has provided}} more fine adjustment of gear ratio, however {{the use of}} thinner metal parts has {{had the effect of}} shortening the life-span of the chain and sprockets due to so called [...] "stretching" [...] of the chain. This is caused by frictional abrasion of the load-bearing surfaces of the chain causing elongation. As such, the chain and sprockets of a nine-speed system require more frequent replacement than an eight. The narrowing of the hub flanges has created more <b>dish</b> in the <b>wheel,</b> which weakens the wheel if all other factors are the same, but improvements in the strength and reliability of spokes and rims has more than balanced this out, and wheel strength is generally higher despite the increased dish.|$|R
5000|$|This {{marked the}} final {{production}} {{year for the}} Third Generation platform. Release of the Fourth Generation model was imminent, and Pontiac made few changes to the 1992 Firebird. The special edition Formula Firehawk that appeared in 1991 was still available, although a lot of dealers were unaware of its existence. Lack of awareness and a sky high price tag conspired to keep the sales figures down on the special Firehawk. As {{for the rest of}} the line, new exterior colors were available, including a bright [...] "Jamaica Yellow". One interior color was changed, from the camel colored beechwood to a greyish beige. Convertibles were still available. One improvement made on all 1992 f-bodies was the addition of some extra bonding agents to stiffen the structure of the cars. The extra bonding was an attempt to correct squeaks and rattles that some owners had complained about. This also allowed GM to experiment with some of the new technologies which were to be implemented on the fourth generation cars. Mid-year, TPI-equipped cars only received blank throttle body plates rather than ones that had been marked [...] "TUNED PORT INJECTION" [...] on similar engines in prior model years; and black-painted valve covers replaced the silver components from previous years. As use of the L98 in the Corvette had come to an end, rough-cast runners found their way into L98-equipped Firebirds, and some cars received special rubber snubbers on the rear hatch frame that were designed to make the hatch more stable. This would be the last year for the light weight deep <b>dish</b> cross-laced <b>wheels</b> that had been available since 1987, and had been styled to look like expensive aftermarket rims. It would be the last year for the GTA, the last year for concealed windshield wipers, and the last year for the aerodynamic body with the long hood and low roofline. It was also the last year for full leather covering on the front seats. Some GTA's ended up with drum brakes on the rear, presumably because of a shortage of disk brake parts. Buyers were compensated for the downgrade. Ultimately, very few Trans Ams, GTA's, and Formulas were produced in this model year, as most buyers were waiting for the next-generation models.|$|R
40|$|The Caribbean steelpan is a pitched {{percussion}} {{instrument that}} originated in Trinidad and Tobago during the Second World War. Despite several research initiatives {{to improve the}} making of this relatively new instrument, several areas remain unaddressed. This thesis presents new approaches to help improve {{the making of the}} instrument. These approaches are situated in the production, vibration and material aspect of the steelpan. A novel sheet forming technology termed Incremental Sheet Forming (ISF) is applied to the production of miniature steelpan dishes. The thickness distribution in the wall of the ISF dishes is compared to the wall thickness distribution in a traditionally formed steelpan <b>dish</b> and a <b>wheeled</b> <b>dish.</b> Unlike traditional forming and wheeling, ISF produces stretching in only a portion of the walls of the formed dishes. Multi-pass ISF is used to extend the stretched zone but this extension is minimal. A break even analysis is also applied to investigate the fiscal viability of ISF application to the production of miniature and full size steelpan dishes. The application of ISF to steelpan making is found to be commercially profitable but could be jeopardised by the tuning stage of the steelpan making process. A preliminary study on the effect of impact on tone stability is conducted on a pair of notes on a full size steelpan and detuning is found more likely to occur by repeated impact of the note at its centre. Mode confinement in test-pans is also investigated. ISF is used to produce miniature test-pans with test-notes that are geometrically identical to notes on full size pans. It is possible to confine modes by varying the curvature of the bowl surrounding the test-note. The number of localised modes in the test-note increases as the radius of curvature of the surrounding bowl increases. The natural frequency of the first confined mode in the test-notes is sensitive to material springback in ISF and the mechanism of confinement appears to be due to the change in geometry that occurs between the flat test-note region and the bowl wall. This control of mode confinement may find use in future efforts to completely or partially automate the steelpan making process. Material damping and mechanical properties in low-carbon steel used to produce steelpans are researched. Damping and mechanical properties are extracted from low-carbon steel that is subjected to identical stages to the steelpan production process. Material damping trends suggest that an annealing temperature between 300 °C and 400 °C would be appropriate for the heat treatment of steelpans. Air-cooled and water-quenched low-carbon specimens exhibit comparable damping trends. Hardness increases in cold formed low-carbon specimens is attributed to strain hardening and not strain ageing. Investigation of damping trends and mechanical properties in ultralow bake-hardenable and interstitial-free steels reveals that a wider range of low-carbon steels maybe suitable for steelpan making.

50|$|Built by the Ford Motorsport (Ford TeamRS) {{works at}} Boreham, Essex, The Rally Ka was {{designed}} as an entry-level vehicle {{to compete in a}} one-make series as part of the British Mintex rally championship. The Ka Championship in 1997 with just four cars in the debut Granite City Rally event. In 1998 fifteen competitors undertook the Mintex challenge. Ford's Boreham airfield facility provides a complete build service for competitors wishing to rally Ka. Most of the parts supplied are concerned with strengthening the car for rallying. Uprated engine mounts and suspension bushes are all included, as is a front strut brace. Aluminium sump and fuel tank guards, OZ Rally wheels and a Safety Devices bolt-in roll cage are all either fitted by the Boreham works or supplied to individual teams. Performance-enhancing modifications are limited to the addition of a Rally spec engine control unit, camshaft and 4-into-2-into-1 extractor set attached to a free-flowing exhaust. This combination lifts power to , and to cope with it competitors are encouraged to fit the optional uprated drive shafts with larger CV joints. A limited-slip differential and heavier clutch plate are also available. A competition brake package consisting of Mintex pads gripping vented front brake rotors and stronger rear drums is homologated for Rally Ka. Replacing the original shock absorbers is a set of four remote-reservoir Proflex coil-over struts adjustable for compression and rebound damping. These are allied to a lowering kit and adjustable spring platforms to give Ka competitors a wide range of suspension settings including ride height. Inside the Rally Ka is all business. In true rally fashion gone are all but the essentials: the two central eyeball vents are replaced by a tachometer and auxiliary gauge. Even the replacement panels in the dashboard which support the fire extinguisher button and extra switches and gauges required in a rally car are listed in the Boreham parts schedule. A deeply <b>dished</b> rally steering <b>wheel,</b> competition seats and harnesses are all supplied from the kit and replacements are not allowed.|$|R
