25|$|Over time, {{alternative}} {{theories of}} Child Development {{have been put}} forward, and empirical findings <b>have</b> <b>done</b> <b>a</b> <b>lot</b> to undermine Piaget's theories. For example, Esther Thelen and colleagues found that babies would not make the A-not-B error if they had small weights added to their arms during {{the first phase of}} the experiment that were then removed before the second phase of the experiment. This minor change should not impact babies' understanding of object permanence, so the difference that this makes to babies' performance on the A-not-B task cannot be explained by Piagetian theory. Thelen and colleagues also found that various other factors also influenced performance on the A-not-B task (including strength of memory trace, salience of targets, waiting time and stance), and proposed that this could be better explained using a dynamic systems theory approach than using Piagetian theory. Alison Gopnik and Betty Repacholi found that babies as young as 18 months old can understand that other people have desires, and that these desires could be very different from their own desires. This strongly contradicts Piaget's view that children are very egocentric at this age. In reaction to these challenges, it has been argued that their criticisms depend on a fundamental misreading of Piaget's theory (Lourenço & Machado, 1996).|$|E
500|$|Among {{the major}} {{concerns}} were leaks; during the {{construction on the}} Romerike Tunnel, there was a one-year delay and severe cost overruns due to improper construction methods. One of the main aims in the Skaugum Tunnel project was therefore to avoid similar leaks, and the criteria were set to [...] per minute per [...] This was achieved by using sufficient time for the pre-injection, as well as continuous pregrouting through the entire tunnel. However, water still dripped into the tunnel, which caused several types of damage. In some places, it dripped onto the track causing it to rust, while in other places it fell onto electrical equipment. There were also issues with water running down the walls and collecting in the cable conduit, and the limestone in the water mixing with the ballast. By 2011, the emergency lighting system had to be replaced {{because of the high}} humidity. The National Rail Administration has stated that savings made by the specifications in the water and frost protection methods have caused high maintenance costs because the small leaks which are present <b>have</b> <b>done</b> <b>a</b> <b>lot</b> of harm. In addition, areas with leaks suffer from icing. This has been part of a trend where older tunnels are nearly maintenance-free, while newer tunnels have incurred high maintenance costs.|$|E
