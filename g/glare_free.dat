40|$|The {{influence}} of discomfort glare is often underestimated in daylighting design {{and in the}} use of buildings. Many façade solutions are intended {{to increase the amount of}} daylight penetrating the room and creating a <b>glare</b> <b>free</b> environment at the same time. But as soon as a planning process comes to the point to quantify the glare freeness of a solution, the question of suitable glare measure arises...|$|E
30|$|The {{universality}} {{of the impact}} of daylight is a common thread that defines humanity. Day light affects us {{in a variety of ways}} –visually, psychologically and biologically. Artificial lighting research has explored ways in which artificial lighting may substitute for daylight and enhance human health and wellbeing. Recently, a study by Mott et al. 2011 found that the usage of high intensity, yet <b>glare</b> <b>free</b> lighting, (referred to as Focus light setting) during reading instruction increased grade 3 students’ oral reading fluency (ORF) scores, a key index of reading comprehension. The current study further explored the effect of Focus lighting during literacy instruction with at-risk grade 3 students (n[*]=[*] 172). Over the course of an academic year, the Focus lighting students increased their ORF scores at a greater rate than did the Normal lighting students. These findings, in combination with earlier lighting research, suggest that artificial lighting plays a key role in helping to create an effective learning environment to ensure children reach their full potential. More systematic research, however, is needed to understand the mechanisms by which artificial lighting may contribute to the learning environment: visually, biologically and/or psychologically.|$|E
40|$|Common {{illumination}} {{systems in}} short wave infrared (SWIR) hyperspectral imaging (HSI) include {{direct or indirect}} tungsten halogen lights. While direct lights provide more radiation onto the samples than dome setups, thus being more energy efficient, the acquired images often suffer from specular reflections and gloss. Glare artifacts in images increase variability in the data limiting the accuracy of machine vision algorithms for defect detection and quality inspection, or even providing false positives. Although domes are known to provide a near Lambertian illumination and <b>glare</b> <b>free</b> images, glossy regions and heterogeneities may remain in the data in practice. More particularly, {{in the field of}} fruit and vegetable quality inspection, due to their waxy surface, it remains challenging to design an efficient realistic lighting system. This paper suggests a new approach to optimize the illumination of fruit and vegetables based on measurements of the bidirectional reflectance distribution function (BRDF), shape and Stokes parameters. From these measured values, a BRDF model is loaded into ray-tracing software for realistic illumination engineering {{in order to determine the}} most suitable illumination scheme. This concept is applied to apples and a cross polarizer (CP) with freeform optics (FO) optical configuration is proposed, which allows the FO to be optimized to maximize uniformity in the field of view of the imager and removes the parallel polarized gloss on the apples. The performance of this CP illumination system was determined experimentally for a set of apples. This cross polarized (CP) illumination system provided a uniformity (U) of 92 % and an efficiency (ν) of 90 %, while U = 87 % and ν = 14 % for an ideal dome configuration when illuminating a rectangular target. The simulated imaged apples with assigned optical properties performed better with CP (U= 80 %) than when using a dome (U= 73 %) by 7 %. Finally, the sensitivity of the design for the light positioning and spectral tolerance are investigated. status: publishe...|$|E
40|$|This {{research}} {{developed the}} Optical Light Pipe (OLP) as a feasible solution {{to solve the}} problem of insufficient daylighting in deep plan office spaces for predominantly sunny climates. It further combined the OLP with a Specular Light Shelf (SLS) to achieve uniform daylighting. This research was performed with an experimental setup of two 1 : 4 scale models of deep plan office spaces, modified from an earlier research on optical light pipe at College Station, TX. Blinds and shading devices were installed on the south fa?ade to provide daylight to the front zone of a 20 feet by 30 feet office module. The back zone was daylit by the OLP hidden in the plenum. The existing OLP design was optimized through computer aided ray-tracing. The SLS design was based on an earlier prototype designed at Lawrence Berkeley National Labs (LBNL). Results were based on observations made on clear and cloudy sky days between February 3 rd and March 17 th. The OLP achieved more than 300 lux of average workplane illuminance for 7. 4 hours, when global horizontal illuminance was greater than 40, 000 lux. It also achieved 200 lux of illuminance higher than an earlier prototype (Martins-Mogo, 2005) on workplane between 1000 hrs and 1630 hrs. It exhibited a <b>glare</b> <b>free</b> daylight distribution with luminance ratios well within prescribed limits on most of the vertical surfaces, with a relatively uniform illuminance distribution on back taskplane. OLP was better than windows with blinds and shading at providing diffuse daylight in backzone on a cloudy day, when global horizontal illuminance was greater than 20, 000 lux. The OLP used in combination with SLS achieved more than 500 lux of average workplane illuminance for 6 hours, when global horizontal illuminance was greater than 40, 000 lux. SLS also produced more uniform illuminance levels on the workplane at all times and on the leftwall at most times. However, it produced non-uniform luminance distribution on walls and ceiling and luminance ratios higher than allowable limits on the sidewall for some morning hours, and hence needed further refinement in design...|$|E
