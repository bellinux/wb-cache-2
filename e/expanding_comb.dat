30|$|This paper {{presents}} {{a new technique}} for flat optical frequency comb (OFC) generation, {{which is based on}} the nonlinear process of multiple four-wave mixing (FWM) effects. The nonlinear effects are significantly enhanced by using the proposed optical feedback scheme consisting of a single mode fiber (SMF), two highly nonlinear fibers (HNLFs) with different zero dispersion wavelengths (ZDWs) and polarization beam splitters (PBSs). Simulation results illustrate its efficiency and applicability of <b>expanding</b> a <b>comb</b> to 128 coherent lines spaced by only 20 GHz within 6 -dB power deviation.|$|R
40|$|Development of chip-scale optical {{frequency}} comb with the coverage from ultra-violet (UV) to mid-infrared (MIR) wavelength {{is of great}} significance. To <b>expand</b> the <b>comb</b> spectrum into the challenging UV region, a material platform with high UV transparency is crucial. In this paper, crystalline aluminum nitride (AlN) -onsapphire film is demonstrated for efficient Kerr frequency comb generation. Near-infrared (NIR) comb with nearly octave-spanning coverage and low parametric threshold is achieved in continuous-wave pumped high-quality-factor AlN microring resonators. The competition between stimulated Raman scattering (SRS) and hyperparametric oscillation is investigated, along with broadband comb generation via Raman-assisted four-wave mixing (FWM). Thanks to its wide bandgap, excellent crystalline quality as well as intrinsic quadratic and cubic susceptibilities, AlN-on-sapphire platform should be appealing for integrated nonlinear optics from MIR to UV region.

40|$|We report {{measurements}} of the response of a Kerr-lens mode-locked Ti:sapphire frequency comb to pump power modulation. For each setting of the laser, the <b>comb</b> <b>expands</b> and contracts about a particular fixed point in frequency. We measured this fixed point {{and found that it}} is within 8 % of our frequency comb's center. In addition, we found that as we shift the comb's center frequency, the fixed point follows to some extent. It follows that modulating the pump power mostly affects the comb's group velocity, i. e., the repetition rate...|$|R
40|$|Supercontinuum {{generation}} using chip-integrated photonic waveguides is {{a powerful}} approach for spectrally broadening pulsed laser sources with very low pulse energies and compact form factors. When pumped with a mode-locked laser frequency comb, these waveguides can coherently <b>expand</b> the <b>comb</b> spectrum to more than an octave in bandwidth to enable self-referenced stabilization. However, for applications in frequency metrology and precision spectroscopy, it is desirable to not only support self-referencing, but also to generate low-noise combs with customizable broadband spectra. In this work, we demonstrate dispersion-engineered waveguides based on silicon nitride {{that are designed to}} meet these goals and enable precision optical metrology experiments across large wavelength spans. We perform a clock comparison measurement and report a clock-limited relative frequency instability of 3. 8 × 10 ^- 15 at τ = 2 seconds between a 1550 nm cavity-stabilized reference laser and NIST's calcium atomic clock laser at 657 nm using a two-octave waveguide-supercontinuum comb...|$|R
50|$|A. vicina {{are known}} to create outstandingly large nests. The combs {{themselves}} are generally horizontal and fairly even, neither convex nor concave. The cells face downward and comb layers are vertically connected by petioles. The bottom combs resemble stratified layers while the top <b>combs</b> <b>expand</b> concentrically to form a singular huge comb. When there are spatial limitations the top most layer stops concentrically expanding, leaving the final shape of the nest to be ellipsoid. The brood is always concentrated {{near the center of}} the nest, while peripheral cells are left empty as a means of enveloping the structure.|$|R
50|$|An {{even more}} serious problem with wood combs, {{especially}} in chromatic harmonicas (with their thin dividers between chambers), is that, as the <b>combs</b> <b>expand</b> and shrink over time, cracks can form in the combs, because the comb is held immobile by nails, resulting in disabling leakage. Much effort is devoted by serious players to restoring wood combs and sealing leaks. Some players used to soak wooden-combed harmonicas (diatonics, without windsavers) in water to cause a slight expansion, which they intended to make the seal between the comb, reed plates and covers more airtight. Modern wooden-combed harmonicas are less prone to swelling and contracting. Players still dip harmonicas in water for the way it affects tone and ease of bending notes.|$|R
50|$|Initially, Dau al Set {{began as}} an {{offshoot}} of Surrealism, but slowly grew into a distinct style with many existing components. One such component began with the incorporation of the surrealist world of dreams, where in Dau al Set <b>expands</b> upon by <b>combing</b> scientific and philosophical articles with magical undertones derived from Joan Brossa's personalized style. The use of magical elements pervaded throughout the entire movement to showcase an esoteric world of inner exploration. While magic was seen consistently the different members each contributed a unique style to Dau al Set. One of the most drastic was the contributions from Joan Ponç. Ponç's art frequently contained demonic images actualized {{with a series of}} different monsters throughout the work. In contrast, Modest Cuixart's work often contained images of fantasy influenced by German expressionism and Joan Miró. Finally, Antoni Tápies often emulated the style of Paul Klee with obscure images surrounded by a dark atmosphere and phosphorescent lighting. With the base of magical elements these three unique techniques joined together to create the style seen in the Dau al Set movement.|$|R
40|$|Two {{frequency}} combs {{can be used}} to measure the full complex response of a sample in a configuration which can be alternatively viewed as the equivalent of a dispersive Fourier transform spectrometer, infrared time domain spectrometer, or a multiheterodyne laser spectrometer. This dual comb spectrometer retains the frequency accuracy and resolution inherent to the comb sources. We discuss, in detail, the specific design of our coherent dual-comb spectrometer and demonstrate the potential of this technique by measuring the first overtone vibration of hydrogen cyanide, centered at 194 THz (1545 nm). We measure the fully normalized, complex response of the gas over a 9 THz bandwidth at 220 MHz frequency resolution yielding 41, 000 resolution elements. The average spectral signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) is 2, 500 for both the fractional absorption and the phase, with a peak SNR of 4, 000 corresponding to a fractional absorption sensitivity of 0. 025 % and phase sensitivity of 250 microradians. As the spectral coverage of <b>combs</b> <b>expands,</b> this dual-comb spectroscopy could provide high frequency accuracy and resolution measurements of a complex sample response across a range of spectral regions.

40|$|In the beeswax combs {{of honey}} bees, {{the cells of}} brood, pollen, and honey have a {{consistent}} spatial pattern that is sustained throughout {{the life of a}} colony. This spatial pattern is believed to emerge from simple behavioral rules that specify how the queen moves, where foragers deposit honey/pollen and how honey/pollen is consumed from cells. Prior work has shown that a set of such rules can explain the formation of the allocation pattern starting from an empty comb. We show that these rules cannot maintain the pattern once the brood start to vacate their cells, and we propose new, biologically realistic rules that better sustain the observed allocation pattern. We analyze the three resulting models by performing hundreds of simulation runs over many gestational periods and a wide range of parameter values. We develop new metrics for pattern assessment and employ them in analyzing pattern retention over each simulation run. Applied to our simulation results, these metrics show alteration of an accepted model for honey/pollen consumption based on local information can stabilize the cell allocation pattern over time. We also show that adding global information, by biasing the queen's movements towards the center of the <b>comb,</b> <b>expands</b> the parameter regime over which pattern retention occurs.
