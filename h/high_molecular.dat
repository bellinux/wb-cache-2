5|$|In {{nuclear energy}} studies, xenon {{is used in}} bubble chambers, probes, and in other areas where a <b>high</b> <b>molecular</b> weight and inert {{chemistry}} is desirable.

5|$|Due {{to their}} natural {{polyisoprene}} content (1.1–7.7% by dry weight of fruit bodies), L.volemus fruit bodies {{can also be}} used to produce rubber. The chemical structure of rubber from the mushroom consists of a <b>high</b> <b>molecular</b> mass homologue of polyprenol, arranged as a dimethylallyl group, two trans isoprene units, a long sequence of cis isoprenes (between 260–300 units), terminated by a hydroxyl or fatty acid ester. Biosynthetically, the creation of the polyisoprene begins with the compound trans,trans-farnesyl pyrophosphate, and is thought to terminate by esterification of polyisoprenyl pyrophosphate. The enzyme isopentenyl-diphosphate delta isomerase has been identified as required for the initiation of rubber synthesis in L.volemus and several other milk cap species.|$|E

40|$|The {{quaternary}} {{structure of the}} membrane-bound mannitol permease (EIIMtl) of the bacterial phosphotransferase system in Escherichia coli has been investigated in the membrane by using the radiation inactivation method. The experiments reveal two distinct but interconvertible forms of the permease. The first state is a dimer, and the second state consists of a less active <b>higher</b> <b>molecular</b> weight complex involving the dimer. The equilibrium between these two forms in the membrane can be shifted by changing the pH. At pH 8. 1 the dimer is the dominant form. Decreasing the pH results in increased binding of a regulatory protein to the dimer, thus {{increasing the amount of}} the <b>higher</b> <b>molecular</b> weight form involving the dimer. Cross-linking EIIMtl in situ, followed by sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis and immunoblotting, resulted in the formation of two cross-linked forms.
