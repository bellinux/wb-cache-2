5|$|The {{matching}} rules {{can be described}} in several ways. One approach is to color the vertices (with two colors, e.g., black and white) and require that adjacent tiles have matching vertices. Another is to use a pattern of circular arcs (as shown above left in green and red) to constrain the placement of tiles: when two tiles share an <b>edge</b> <b>in</b> a tiling, the patterns must match at these edges.|$|E

5|$|A cutset in an {{arbitrary}} connected graph is {{a subset of}} edges defined from a partition of the vertices into two subsets, by including an <b>edge</b> <b>in</b> the subset when it has one endpoint {{on each side of}} the partition. Removing the edges of a cutset necessarily splits the graph into at least two connected components. A minimal cutset (also called a bond) is a cutset with the property that every proper subset of the cutset is not itself a cut. A minimal cutset of a connected graph necessarily separates its graph into exactly two components, and consists of the set of edges that have one endpoint in each component. A simple cycle is a connected subgraph in which each vertex of the cycle is incident to exactly two edges of the cycle.|$|E

During Cena's feud with Big Show, The Miz challenged him to a match on the April 27 episode of Raw, but as Cena was out due to injury, Miz claimed an unofficial win via forfeit and continued to do this over the following weeks, until Cena defeated him in a singles match at The Bash.|$|E
30|$|There {{are three}} types of <b>edges</b> <b>in</b> this figure. The <b>edges</b> <b>in</b> red are {{generated}} in step 2 to construct rings; thus, they are termed as hoop directional <b>edges.</b> The <b>edges</b> <b>in</b> blue are generated in step 3 to construct lines; thus, they are termed as radial directional <b>edges.</b> The <b>edges</b> <b>in</b> black are generated in step 4 to connect two vertices on neighboring radial directional lines and rings with the largest difference in group indices; they are termed as bevel edges. Because these topologies {{are very similar to}} a spider web when the number of nodes is large, we refer to them as standard spider web topologies.|$|R

In exchange for destroying an imperial base, the leader of Zoah gives Edge access to an ancient artifact that grants a vision of Mel-Kava's location. Edge and the dragon destroy Mel-Kava, clearing the fog, but are attacked again by Azel and Atolm. They shoot down Atolm and rescue Azel as she falls.|$|E

SmackDown General Manager Teddy Long returned later that night, and rehired Edge. Edge then defeated Ziggler {{to become the}} World Heavyweight Champion for the seventh time, his 11th World Championship overall. After the match, Teddy Long fired Ziggler, and Guerrero followed the next week after losing a tag team match with Drew McIntyre against Edge and Kelly Kelly.|$|E

5|$|Fast is {{considered}} a skilled forward with good skating ability, hockey sense, and speed, the latter of which gives him an <b>edge</b> <b>in</b> retrieving pucks along the boards. He excels on the forecheck, is a reliable defensive forward, and plays well in the offensive, defensive, and neutral zones. Alain Vigneault has praised his work ethic and dependability, and teammate Tanner Glass has noted his ability to make responsible decisions and skillful plays with the puck along the defensive zone wall. One of Fast's drawbacks is he lacks the ideal frame for National Hockey League play, but his physical game improved after he added muscle in the 2014 offseason.|$|E
5|$|In December 2005, the USAF {{announced}} that the F-22 had achieved Initial Operational Capability (IOC). During Exercise Northern <b>Edge</b> <b>in</b> Alaska in June 2006, in simulated combat exercises 12 F-22s of the 94th FS downed 108 adversaries with no losses. In the exercises, the Raptor-led Blue Force amassed 241 kills against two losses in air-to-air combat, with neither loss being an F-22. During Red Flag 07-1 in February 2007, 14 F-22s of the 94th FS supported Blue Force strikes and undertook close air support sorties. Against superior numbers of Red Force Aggressor F-15s and F-16s, 6–8 F-22s maintained air dominance throughout. No sorties were missed because of maintenance or other failures; a single F-22 was judged lost against the defeated opposing force. F-22s also provided airborne electronic surveillance.|$|E
5|$|In graph algorithms, {{the widest}} path {{problem is the}} problem of finding a path between two {{designated}} vertices in a weighted graph, maximizing the weight of the minimum-weight <b>edge</b> <b>in</b> the path. The widest path problem is also known as the bottleneck shortest path problem or the maximum capacity path problem. It is possible to adapt most shortest path algorithms to compute widest paths, by modifying them to use the bottleneck distance instead of path length. However, in many cases even faster algorithms are possible.|$|E
