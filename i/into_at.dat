5|$|After its {{perihelion}} passage, {{the comet}} moved into dark skies, {{and although it}} faded as it receded from the Sun it remained {{one of the most}} prominent objects in the sky. On 30 September, observers, including Finlay and E. E. Barnard, began to notice that the comet's nucleus was elongated and broken into two pronounced bright balls of light, and by 17 October it was clear that it had broken <b>into</b> <b>at</b> least five fragments. Observers reported that the relative brightness of the fragments varied from day to day.|$|E
5|$|By the Visean (mid-Carboniferous) stage, {{the early}} {{tetrapods}} had radiated <b>into</b> <b>at</b> least {{three or four}} main branches. Recognizable basal-group tetrapods {{are representative of the}} temnospondyls (e.g. Eryops) lepospondyls (e.g. Diplocaulus), anthracosaurs, which were the relatives and ancestors of the Amniota, and possibly the baphetids, which are thought to be related to temnospondyls and whose status as a main branch is yet unresolved. Depending on which authorities one follows, modern amphibians (frogs, salamanders and caecilians) are most probably derived from either temnospondyls or lepospondyls (or possibly both, although this is now a minority position).|$|E

5|$|In 1594, Hues {{published}} his discoveries in the Latin work Tractatus de globis et eorum usu (Treatise on Globes and Their Use) {{which was written}} to explain {{the use of the}} terrestrial and celestial globes that had been made and published by Emery Molyneux in late 1592 or early 1593, and to encourage English sailors to use practical astronomical navigation. Hues' work subsequently went <b>into</b> <b>at</b> least 12 other printings in Dutch, English, French and Latin.|$|E

50|$|Zimbabwe {{already has}} a bridge <b>into</b> Zambia <b>at</b> Victoria Falls, 70 km from Kazungula. Namibia {{already has a}} bridge <b>into</b> Zambia <b>at</b> Katima Mulilo about 150 km upriver. This {{proposed}} bridge will give a direct connection between Zambia and Botswana.But {{there is still no}} direct connection between Namibia and Zimbabwe, nor is one planned. Traffic from Namibia to Zimbabwe has to cross to Zambia at Katimo Mulilo, and then from Zambia <b>into</b> Zimbabwe <b>at</b> the Victoria Falls; or over this new bridge into Botswana, and thence <b>into</b> Zimbabwe <b>at</b> Pandamatenga. In practice, though, there is very little such traffic along this route, or demand. Most traffic between Namibia and Zimbabwe goes through Botswana via Maun, which is a considerably shorter route.|$|R

5|$|Simon & Schuster {{released}} The Firebrand on October 1, 1987 in hardcover, and it {{was issued}} in paperback in September 1988. The Firebrand has been overshadowed by the popularity of The Mists of Avalon, receiving less attention and critical praise. Reviews of the book ranged from mixed to positive, with many literary critics praising Bradley's ability to give new characterizations to legendary figures. It has been translated <b>into</b> <b>at</b> least twelve languages, beginning with Portuguese and French in 1989.|$|E
5|$|Ten objects, {{among them}} {{one of the}} inscribed rings, were stolen shortly after the find was made, and when the {{remaining}} objects were recovered, {{it was discovered that}} the other ring had been cut <b>into</b> <b>at</b> least four pieces by a Bucharest goldsmith, whereby one of the inscribed characters had become damaged to the point of illegibility. Fortunately, detailed drawings, a cast, and a photograph made by London's Arundel Society of the ring before it was damaged survive, {{and the nature of the}} lost character can be established with relative certainty.|$|E

5|$|The Malay Archipelago {{is a book}} by the British naturalist Alfred Russel Wallace which chronicles his {{scientific}} exploration, during the eight-year period 1854 to 1862, of the southern portion of the Malay Archipelago including Malaysia, Singapore, the islands of Indonesia, then known as the Dutch East Indies, and the island of New Guinea. It was published in two volumes in 1869, delayed by Wallace's ill health and the work needed to describe the many specimens he brought home. The book went through ten editions in the nineteenth century; it has been reprinted many times since, and has been translated <b>into</b> <b>at</b> least eight languages.|$|E
5|$|The Mayan {{language}} {{family is}} one of the best-documented and most studied in the Americas. Modern Mayan languages descend from the Proto-Mayan language, thought to have been spoken at least 5,000 years ago; it has been partially reconstructed using the comparative method. The proto-Mayan language diversified <b>into</b> <b>at</b> least six different branches: the Huastecan, Quichean, Yucatecan, Qanjobalan, Mamean and Ch'olan-Tzeltalan branches.|$|E
5|$|The common raven {{evolved in}} the Old World and crossed the Bering land bridge into North America. Recent genetic studies, which {{examined}} the DNA of common ravens from across the world, have determined that the birds fall <b>into</b> <b>at</b> least two clades: a California clade, found only in the southwestern United States, and a Holarctic clade, found across {{the rest of the}} Northern Hemisphere. Birds from both clades look alike, but the groups are genetically distinct and began to diverge about two million years ago.|$|E

It has been translated <b>into</b> <b>at</b> least seventy three other languages and has been made into a feature-length film of the same name, as have all six of its sequels.|$|E
5|$|A cutset in an {{arbitrary}} connected graph is {{a subset of}} edges defined from a partition of the vertices into two subsets, by including an edge in the subset when it has one endpoint {{on each side of}} the partition. Removing the edges of a cutset necessarily splits the graph <b>into</b> <b>at</b> least two connected components. A minimal cutset (also called a bond) is a cutset with the property that every proper subset of the cutset is not itself a cut. A minimal cutset of a connected graph necessarily separates its graph into exactly two components, and consists of the set of edges that have one endpoint in each component. A simple cycle is a connected subgraph in which each vertex of the cycle is incident to exactly two edges of the cycle.|$|E
5|$|Across its Central Asian distribution, the saxaul sparrow {{occurs in}} six {{probably}} disjunct areas, and is divided <b>into</b> <b>at</b> least three subspecies. The nominate subspecies Passer ammodendri ammodendri inhabits {{three of these}} areas, one in the Syr Darya basin of Kazakhstan and Uzbekistan, and another {{to the south of}} Lake Balkhash and the north of Almaty, where it is only common in the valley of the Ili River. In a third area, sometimes recognised as a subspecies korejewi, ammodendri birds breed sporadically in parts of central Turkmenistan, Iran, and possibly Afghanistan, migrating to the south during the winter. The subspecies stoliczkae was named after Ferdinand Stoliczka in 1874 by Allan Octavian Hume, from specimens Stoliczka collected in Yarkand. This subspecies is separated from the other two subspecies by the Tian Shan mountains. It is found across a broad swath of China from Kashgar east to the far west of Inner Mongolia, through the areas around the Taklamakan Desert (but probably not in the inhospitable desert itself), and through the east of Xinjiang, northern Gansu, and the fringes of southern Mongolia. In the extreme west of the Gobi Desert a disjunct population separated from the other stoliczkae birds by the Gurvan Saikhan Uul mountains occurs, which is sometimes separated as a subspecies timidus. The subspecies nigricans, described by ornithologist L. S. Stepanyan in 1961, is found in northern Xinjiang's Manasi River valley.|$|E

5|$|Bellman {{has been}} {{translated}} <b>into</b> <b>at</b> least 20 languages, including English, most notably by Paul Britten Austin, and into German, for example by Hannes Wader. German Communist leader Karl Liebknecht liked Bellman's songs and translated some into German. Hans Christian Andersen {{was one of}} the first to translate Bellman into Danish. Bellman's songs have been translated and recorded in Icelandic (by Bubbi), Italian, French, Finnish (for instance by Vesa-Matti Loiri), Russian, Chuvash and Yiddish. English interpretations have been recorded by William Clauson, Martin Best, Freddie Langrind made some Norwegian translations in 2008. Sven-Bertil Taube, Roger Hinchliffe and Martin Bagge. Schoolchildren two hundred years on still learn some of his songs, and several including Gubben Noak and Fjäriln vingad are known by heart by many Swedes.|$|E
5|$|David (Nolan North) is {{the leader}} of a group of cannibals that Ellie runs <b>into</b> <b>at</b> the Lakeside Resort where she is {{sheltering}} Joel while he recovers from a grievous wound. Initially, Ellie runs into him and a fellow hunter after killing a deer, and he offers to trade the deer for some penicillin for Joel. After he and Ellie are forced to fend off a swarm of infected, David reveals that he is actually the leader of the gang of hunters that Ellie and Joel had killed previously at the University of Eastern Colorado, when Joel was injured. He allows Ellie to get away, but later tracks her down and kidnaps her, taking her to his base in the town. There, Ellie discovers that David's gang are cannibals. She resists their attempts, manages to kill his assistant and flees into the town, while David and his gang stalk her. David eventually corners her in a restaurant, and stalks her for several minutes, as it burns down. Eventually, he manages to pin her down and tries to strangle her, but she catches hold of his machete and swings it, knocking him off her, and brutally hacks him to death, before Joel arrives and pulls her off.|$|E
5|$|Edwin's {{defeat and}} death caused his kingdom to {{fragment}} <b>into</b> <b>at</b> least two parts. It {{also led to}} {{a sharp decline in}} Christianity in Northumbria when Edwin's immediate successors reverted to paganism. Although Paulinus' deacon, James, remained in the north and struggled to rebuild the Roman mission, Edwin's widow decided to return to Kent. Paulinus went with her, taking Edwin and Æthelburg's son and daughter, as well as one of Edwin's grandsons. The two boys went to the continent for safety, to the court of King Dagobert I. Æthelburg, Eanflæd, and Paulinus remained in Kent, where Paulinus was offered the see, or bishopric, of Rochester, which he held until his death. Because the pallium did not reach Paulinus until after he had left York, it was of no use to him.|$|E
