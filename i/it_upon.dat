Vasilevsky, keeping his promise, appealed to Stalin to allow Bagramyan to move to Daugavpils but he refused to do so. Vasilevsky in turn, took <b>it</b> <b>upon</b> his own initiative and gave Bagramyan the go ahead. However, with the loss of 4th Shock Army, Bagramyan was left shortchanged since his promised 39th Army had not only not arrived but was composed of only seven divisions (in comparison to 4th Shock's ten). Feeling that time was being lost, he pressed on with the units he had.|$|E

5|$|Originally {{meant as}} the first James Bond film, Thunderball was the centre of legal {{disputes}} that began in 1961 and ran until 2006. Former Ian Fleming collaborators Kevin McClory and Jack Whittingham sued Fleming shortly after the 1961 publication of the Thunderball novel, claiming he based <b>it</b> <b>upon</b> the screenplay the trio had earlier written in a failed cinematic translation of James Bond. The lawsuit was settled out of court; McClory retained certain screen rights to the novel's story, plot, and characters. By then, Bond was a box-office success, and series producers Broccoli and Saltzman feared a rival McClory film beyond their control; they agreed to McClory's producer's credit of a cinematic Thunderball, with them as executive producers.|$|E

5|$|Producers Lynda Myles and Roger Randall-Cutler {{acquired}} the film {{rights to the}} novel in 1988, and commissioned Doyle, a first-time screenwriter, to write an adaptation. Doyle spent one year working on the script before Myles brought in veteran screenwriters Clement and La Frenais to help complete <b>it.</b> <b>Upon</b> reading the novel, Parker signed on as the film's director in 1989. The Commitments was the first film to be produced by Beacon Communications, which provided an estimated budget of $12–15 million. The film's young lead actors were mostly inexperienced, and were cast due to their musical backgrounds and resemblance to {{the characters in the}} novel. Principal photography commenced in Dublin, Ireland from late August 1990 to October of that year.|$|E

5|$|The {{catalyst}} for this Norwegian intervention {{may have been}} the extension of Muirchertach's influence into the Irish Sea region following the death of Gofraid Crobán, King of the Isles (died 1095). The region itself appears to have degenerated into chaos following Gofraid's demise, and Magnús seems to have taken <b>it</b> <b>upon</b> himself to reassert Norwegian authority. Magnús made two expeditions into the Irish Sea region. One arrived in 1098; the other in 1102. The focus of the second overseas operation appears to have been Ireland itself. Following an apparent Norwegian conquest of Dublin, Magnús and Muirchertach negotiated a peace agreement, sealed through the marriage of Magnús' son, Sigurðr (died 1130), and Bjaðmunjo herself.|$|E
