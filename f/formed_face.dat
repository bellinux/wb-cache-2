6000|$|... § 6. Meanwhile, {{the art of}} sculpture, less {{capable of}} ministering to mere amusement, {{was more or less}} {{reserved}} for the affectations of taste; and the study of the classical statues introduced various ideas on the subjects of [...] "purity," [...] "chastity," [...] and [...] "dignity," [...] such as it was possible for people to entertain who were themselves impure, luxurious, and ridiculous. It is a matter of extreme difficulty to explain the exact character of this modern sculpturesque ideal; but its relation to the true ideal may be best understood by considering it as in exact parallelism with the relation of the word [...] "taste" [...] to the word [...] "love." [...] Wherever the word [...] "taste" [...] is used with respect to matters of art, it indicates either that the thing spoken of belongs to some inferior class of objects, or that the person speaking has a false conception of its nature. For, consider the exact sense in which a work of art is said to be [...] "in good or bad taste." [...] It does not mean that it is true, or false; that it is beautiful, or ugly; but that it does or does not comply either with the laws of choice, which are enforced by certain modes of life; or the habits of mind produced by a particular sort of education. It does not mean merely fashionable, that is, complying with a momentary caprice of the upper classes; but it means agreeing with the habitual sense which the most refined education, common to those upper classes at the period, gives to their whole mind. Now, therefore, so far as that education does indeed tend to make the senses delicate, and the perceptions accurate, and thus enables people to be pleased with quiet instead of gaudy color, and with graceful instead of coarse form; and, by long acquaintance with the best things, to discern quickly what is fine from what is common;--so far, acquired taste is an honorable faculty, and it is true praise of anything to say it is [...] "in good taste." [...] But so far as this higher education has a tendency to narrow the sympathies and harden the heart, diminishing the interest of all beautiful things by familiarity, until even what is best can hardly please, and what is brightest hardly entertain;--so far as it fosters pride, and leads men to found the pleasure they take in anything, not on the worthiness of the thing, but on the degree in which it indicates some greatness of their own (as people build marble porticos, and inlay marble floors, not so much because they like the colors of marble, or find it pleasant to the foot, as because such porches and floors are costly, and separated in all human eyes from plain entrances of stone and timber);--so far as it leads people to prefer gracefulness of dress, manner, and aspect, to value of substance and heart, liking a well said thing better than a true thing, and a well trained manner better than a sincere one, and a delicately <b>formed</b> <b>face</b> better than a good-natured one, and in all other ways and things setting custom and semblance above everlasting truth;--so far, finally, as it induces a sense of inherent distinction between class and class, and causes everything to be more or less despised which has no social rank, so that the affection, pleasure, or grief of a clown are looked upon as of no interest compared with the affection and grief of a well-bred man;--just so far, in all these several ways, the feeling induced by what is called a [...] "liberal education" [...] is utterly adverse to the understanding of noble art; and the name which is given to the feeling,--Taste, Goût, Gusto,--in all languages, indicates the baseness of it, for it implies that art gives only a kind of pleasure analogous to that derived from eating by the palate.|$|E

To enhance the appearance of those faces, the construction team utilized so-called grout-enriched RCC to yield a smoother face.

5000|$|Structurally, {{the barbed}} {{ends of the}} microfilaments (localized actin {{monomers}} in an ATP-bound <b>form)</b> <b>face</b> the [...] "seeking" [...] edge of the cell, while the pointed ends (localized actin monomers in an ADP-bound <b>form)</b> <b>face</b> the lamella behind. This creates treadmilling throughout the lamellipodium, which aids in the retrograde flow of particles throughout. Arp2/3 complexes are present at microfilament-microfilament junctions in lamellipodia, and help create the actin meshwork. Arp 2/3 can only join onto previously existing microfilaments, but once bound it creates a site for the extension of new microfilaments, which creates branching. Another molecule that is often found in polymerizing actin with Arp2/3 is cortactin, which appears to link tyrosine kinase signalling to cytoskeletal reorganization in the lamellipodium and its associated structures.|$|R

The crystal <b>forms</b> (<b>face</b> <b>forms),</b> {{defined in terms of}} their geometric eigensymmetry, are 47 in number, not 48 as often found in the literature. The split of the dihedron into dome and sphenoid calls for the consideration of the physical properties of the faces building a form; in that case, however, the same criterion should be used for all forms. By taking the handedness of the faces as representative of the physical properties of the faces, the occurrence of 128 crystallographic <b>face</b> <b>forms</b> (97 affine <b>face</b> <b>forms</b> and 31 enantiomorphic pairs) is demonstrated. Next, the correct use of non-coprime Miller indices when a centred unit cell is adopted is shown, and the inconsistent multiplication of Miller indices in the Bravais-Friedel-Donnay-Harker law is pointed out. A geometric derivation of the reflection conditions is reviewed. Finally, the inconsistent presentation of metric restrictions imposed by the structural symmetry is pointed out and corrected...|$|R
