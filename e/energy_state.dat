5|$|Each atomic orbital {{corresponds}} to a particular energy level of the electron. The electron can change its state to a higher energy level by absorbing a photon with sufficient energy to boost it into the new quantum state. Likewise, through spontaneous emission, an electron in a higher <b>energy</b> <b>state</b> can drop to a lower <b>energy</b> <b>state</b> while radiating the excess energy as a photon. These characteristic energy values, defined by {{the differences in the}} energies of the quantum states, are responsible for atomic spectral lines.|$|E
5|$|Another way to view {{surface tension}} is {{in terms of}} energy. A {{molecule}} in contact with a neighbor is in a lower state of energy than if it were alone (not in contact with a neighbor). The interior molecules have as many neighbors as they can possibly have, but the boundary molecules are missing neighbors (compared to interior molecules) and therefore have a higher energy. For the liquid to minimize its <b>energy</b> <b>state,</b> the number of higher energy boundary molecules must be minimized. The minimized number of boundary molecules results in a minimal surface area.|$|E
5|$|For atoms {{with low}} atomic numbers, a nucleus {{that has more}} {{neutrons}} than protons tends to drop to a lower <b>energy</b> <b>state</b> through radioactive decay so that the neutron–proton ratio is closer to one. However, as the atomic number increases, {{a higher proportion of}} neutrons is required to offset the mutual repulsion of the protons. Thus, there are no stable nuclei with equal proton and neutron numbers above atomic number Z = 20 (calcium) and as Z increases, the neutron–proton ratio of stable isotopes increases. The stable isotope with the highest proton–neutron ratio is lead-208 (about 1.5).|$|E
50|$|Negative {{temperatures}} {{can only}} {{exist in a}} system where there are {{a limited number of}} <b>energy</b> <b>states</b> (see below). As the temperature is increased on such a system, particles move into higher and higher <b>energy</b> <b>states,</b> and as the temperature increases, the number of particles in the lower <b>energy</b> <b>states</b> and in the higher <b>energy</b> <b>states</b> approaches equality. (This is a consequence of the definition of temperature in statistical mechanics for systems with limited <b>states.)</b> By injecting <b>energy</b> into these systems in the right fashion, it is possible to create a system in which there are more particles in the higher <b>energy</b> <b>states</b> than in the lower ones. The system can then be characterised as having a negative temperature.|$|R

Both production and exploration for crude oil and natural gas expanded rapidly in response to the spike in energy prices, propelling strong job and income gains in the <b>energy</b> <b>states.</b> But the strong performance of the <b>energy</b> <b>states</b> through {{the early stages of the}} recession subsequently reversed itself under the weight of collapsing <b>energy</b> prices. These <b>states</b> began to underperform non-energy states by the second quarter of 2009.

40|$|For {{a quantum}} {{confinement}} model, the wave {{function of a}} particle is zero outside the confined region. Due to this, the negative <b>energy</b> <b>states</b> are, in fact, square integrable. As negative <b>energy</b> <b>states</b> are not physical, we need to impose some boundary conditions {{in order to avoid}} these states. For the case of the infinite square well model, we show the possible boundary conditions that avoid the existence of the negative <b>energy</b> <b>states.</b> The well-known boundary condition requiring the wave function be continuous {{on both sides of the}} well is one of the boundary conditions that avoids negative <b>energy</b> <b>states.</b> However, there are other types of boundary condition that can also avoid the negative <b>energy</b> <b>states.</b> This shows that there are the different branch of physical systems that can be established on the infinite square well model...|$|R
5|$|If a bound {{electron}} {{is in an}} excited state, an interacting photon with the proper energy can cause stimulated emission of a photon with a matching energy level. For this to occur, the electron must drop to a lower <b>energy</b> <b>state</b> that has an energy difference matching {{the energy of the}} interacting photon. The emitted photon and the interacting photon then move off in parallel and with matching phases. That is, the wave patterns of the two photons are synchronized. This physical property is used to make lasers, which can emit a coherent beam of light energy in a narrow frequency band.|$|E
5|$|In {{ferromagnetic}} {{elements such}} as iron, cobalt and nickel, an odd number of electrons leads to an unpaired electron and a net overall magnetic moment. The orbitals of neighboring atoms overlap and a lower <b>energy</b> <b>state</b> is achieved when the spins of unpaired electrons are aligned with each other, a spontaneous process known as an exchange interaction. When the magnetic moments of ferromagnetic atoms are lined up, the material can produce a measurable macroscopic field. Paramagnetic materials have atoms with magnetic moments that line up in random directions when no magnetic field is present, but the magnetic moments of the individual atoms line up {{in the presence of}} a field.|$|E
5|$|When xenon atoms are in {{the ground}} <b>energy</b> <b>state,</b> they repel each other and will not form a bond. When xenon atoms becomes energized, however, they can form an excimer (excited dimer) until the {{electrons}} return to the ground state. This entity is formed because the xenon atom tends to complete the outermost electronic shell by adding an electron from a neighboring xenon atom. The typical lifetime of a xenon excimer is 1–5ns, and the decay releases photons with wavelengths of about 150 and 173nm. Xenon can also form excimers with other elements, such as the halogens bromine, chlorine, and fluorine.|$|E

These gyrations in economic activity are reminiscent of the volatility experienced during the 1970 s and early 1980 s, suggesting that the energy cycle is alive and well in the energy states.; Snead examines the economic performance of the <b>energy</b> <b>states</b> in the recent energy price spike and recessionary cycle. He finds that the economies of the <b>energy</b> <b>states</b> remain highly sensitive to changes in energy prices and follow a much different economic cycle than non-energy <b>states.</b> The <b>energy</b> <b>states</b> posted far stronger job growth prior to the recession, entered the recession much later and with more momentum, and have posted smaller cumulative job losses than non-energy states. Most of the <b>energy</b> <b>states</b> were nearly as reliant on the energy sector as a source of state earnings in 2008 as they were at the peak of the prior cycle in 1982. He also finds that the historical ranks of the <b>energy</b> <b>states</b> are poised for a shuffling. Unconventional natural gas production will move some states closer to the top as other states enter the ranks of the major oil and gas producers for the first time. ...|$|R

5|$|With {{the advent}} of high {{resolution}} imaging, researchers have started to obtain experimental data which have led them to question the assumptions of the Cassie–Baxter equation when calculating the apparent contact angle. These groups believe the apparent contact angle is largely dependent on the triple line. The triple line, which is {{in contact with the}} heterogeneous surface, cannot rest on the heterogeneous surface {{like the rest of the}} drop. In theory, it should follow the surface imperfection. This bending in triple line is unfavorable and is not seen in real-world situations. A theory that preserves the Cassie–Baxter equation while at the same time explaining the presence of minimized <b>energy</b> <b>state</b> of the triple line hinges on the idea of a precursor film. This film of submicrometer thickness advances ahead of the motion of the droplet and is found around the triple line. Furthermore, this precursor film allows the triple line to bend and take different conformations that were originally considered unfavorable. This precursor fluid has been observed using environmental scanning electron microscopy (ESEM) in surfaces with pores formed in the bulk. With the introduction of the precursor film concept, the triple line can follow energetically feasible conformations and thereby correctly explaining the Cassie–Baxter model.|$|E

25|$|Alternatively, if the excited-state atom is perturbed by an {{electric}} field of frequency ν0, it may emit an additional photon {{of the same}} frequency and in phase, thus augmenting the external field, leaving the atom in the lower <b>energy</b> <b>state.</b> This process is known as stimulated emission.|$|E

25|$|Protium is a spin 1/2 {{subatomic}} particle {{and is therefore}} a fermion. Other fermions include neutrons, electrons, and the radioactive isotope tritium. Fermions are governed by Pauli's exclusion principle, where no two particles can have the same quantum number. However, bosons like deuterium and photons, are not bound by exclusion and multiple particles can occupy the same <b>energy</b> <b>state.</b> This fundamental difference in 1H and 2H manifests in many physical properties. Integer spin particles like deuterium follow Bose-Einstein statistics while fermions with half integer spins follow Fermi-Dirac statistics. Wave functions that describe multiple fermions must be antisymmetric with respect to swapping particles, while boson wave functions are symmetric. Because bosons are indistinguishable and can occupy the same state, collections of bosons behave very differently than fermions at colder temperatures. As bosons are cooled and relaxed to the lowest <b>energy</b> <b>state,</b> phenomena like superfluidity and superconductivity occur.|$|E

25|$|An {{absorption}} line is formed when an atom or molecule makes {{a transition from}} a lower, , to a higher discrete <b>energy</b> <b>state,</b> , with a photon being absorbed in the process.

25|$|If light (photons) of {{frequency}} ν12 {{passes through the}} group of atoms, {{there is a possibility}} of the light being absorbed by atoms which are in the ground state, which will cause them to be excited to the higher <b>energy</b> <b>state.</b> The rate of absorption is proportional to the radiation intensity of the light, and also to the number of atoms currently in the ground state, N1.|$|E
25|$|We may {{calculate}} {{the ratio of}} the populations of the two states at room temperature (T≈300K) for an energy difference ΔE that corresponds to light of a frequency corresponding to visible light (ν≈5×1014Hz). In this case ΔE = E2 - E1 ≈ 2.07eV, and kT ≈ 0.026eV. Since E2 - E1 ≫ kT, it follows that the argument of the exponential in the equation above is a large negative number, and as such N2/N1 is vanishingly small; i.e., there are almost no atoms in the excited state. When in thermal equilibrium, then, it is seen that the lower <b>energy</b> <b>state</b> is more populated than the higher <b>energy</b> <b>state,</b> and this is the normal state of the system. As T increases, the number of electrons in the high-energy state (N2) increases, but N2 never exceeds N1 for a system at thermal equilibrium; rather, at infinite temperature, the populations N2 and N1 become equal. In other words, a population inversion (N2/N1 > 1) can never exist for a system at thermal equilibrium. To achieve population inversion therefore requires pushing the system into a non-equilibrated state.|$|E
