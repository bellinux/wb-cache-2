Upon {{completion}} on 12 March 1918, {{she had a}} crew of 12 men and served an uneventful few years on anti-submarine and coastal patrol duties. After the war, she was registered as a fishing vessel at London under registry number LO438, taking up that role officially on 24 August 1920. After two years under Admiralty ownership, she was sold to the Boston <b>Deep</b> <b>Sea</b> <b>Fishing</b> & Ice Co Ltd, Boston, Lincolnshire, and her London registry was closed. As {{a result of the}} sale, she was renamed Haganby and registered at Boston under registry number BN179 and manager Fred Parkes.

5|$|In February 1925, she {{was sold}} again, {{this time to}} a French {{fisherman}} named Victor Fourny. She was renamed Professeur Bergonié, after Jean Bergonié, and registered at Boulogne. After several years in France, the Boston <b>Deep</b> <b>Sea</b> <b>Fishing</b> repurchased her on 4 March 1930, and she was renamed again, this time to the Daily Chronicle (FD69), registered at Fleetwood. She also returned to the same manager as in Boston, Fred Parkes. It was during this time that she had her first unusual duty– on 5 July 1933, she was chartered by the Italian Government to support a transatlantic flight by 24 Savoia-Marchetti S.55X seaplanes. The flight was led by General Italo Balbo, and covered , from Orbetello to Chicago, via Iceland, in 47 hours 52 minutes. She collided with the steam trawler Jacinta (FD235) at St Kilda fishing grounds on 12 August 1934. Although the starboard side of Jacinta was damaged, the Daily Chronicle remained undamaged. On 5 November 1934, her registry at Fleetwood ended, and she was sold to Thomas L Devlin & Sons of Granton, registered there, and renamed Commodator (GN6).|$|E

The <b>deep</b> <b>sea</b> {{is almost}} {{completely}} dark, near freezing and has little food. <b>Deep</b> <b>sea</b> <b>fish</b> grow slowly because of limited food, have slow metabolisms, low reproductive rates, and many don't reach breeding maturity for 30 to 40 years. A fillet of orange roughy {{at the store}} is probably at least 50 years old. Most <b>deep</b> <b>sea</b> <b>fish</b> are in international waters, {{where there are no}} legal protections. Most of these fish are caught by deep trawlers near seamounts, where they congregate because of food. Flash freezing allows the trawlers to work for days at a time, and modern fishfinders target the fish with ease.|$|R
