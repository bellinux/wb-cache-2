5|$|Players control Conan the Barbarian from a third-person {{perspective}} {{while attempting}} to advance through the series of levels that subdivide the game. The gameplay {{is the same for}} each level: Conan moves from area to area, fighting groups of enemies until <b>he</b> <b>reaches</b> the end. At the end of certain levels, the barbarian has to fight a more powerful opponent called a boss. Defeating a boss involves a two-stage process: Conan has to inflict heavy damage on the creature and thus trigger an interactive button-pressing sequence that players have to complete to kill the boss. Several cycles of this process are required to defeat most bosses. Besides combat, button-pressing sequences are also used to interact with the environment, such as knocking down obstacles to create passageways, or as parts of platforming sequences in which Conan climbs walls and jumps from ledge to ledge. Players can save their progress by using special stones that are placed throughout the game.|$|E
