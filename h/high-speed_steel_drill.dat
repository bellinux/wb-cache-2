40|$|Abstract. The {{machinable}} fluorophlogopite was drilled with tungsten-cobalt carbide and <b>high-speed</b> <b>steel</b> <b>drill</b> bits, respectively. The wear widths {{of major}} flank were measured, and the wear characteristic of twist was analyzed during drilling fluorophlogopite ceramics. Drilling experiments were carried to consider influence factors of drill bit wear, such as tool materials, cooling condition, spindle speed and tool angles. Tool materials and cooling conditions {{are the major}} factors to affect wear of drill bits. <b>High-speed</b> <b>steel</b> <b>drill</b> bits are not suitable for drilling fluorophlogopite ceramics. Cooling condition affects wear remarkably. With the rising of spindle speed, the wear widths of major flank grows. But apex angle has little affects on the tool wear rate. Research results indicate that low tool wear can be obtain through optimizing tool material and machining parameters in drilling fluorophlogopite ceramics...|$|E

40|$|This paper {{presents}} {{a new approach}} for modelling the thrust force in the drilling of PA 6 –nanoclay (NC) nanocomposite materials, by using a particle-swarm-optimization-based neural network (PSONN). In this regard, {{the advantages of the}} statistical experimental algorithm technique, experimental measurements, particle swarm optimization, and artificial neural network were exploited in an integrated manner. For this purpose, numerous experiments for PA 6 and PA 6 –NC nanocomposites were conducted to obtain the thrust force values using a <b>high-speed</b> <b>steel</b> <b>drill</b> 2 mm in diameter with a 118 ° point angle. Then, a predictive model for the thrust force was created using the PSONN algorithm. The training capacity of the PSONN was compared with that of the conventional neural network. The results indicate that, when the NC content in PA 6 is increased, the thrust force of the drilling operation on this material is decreased significantly. Also, the results obtained about the modelling of the thrust force showed the good training capacity of the proposed PSONN algorithm, compared with that of a conventional neural network. 15 page(s...|$|E

40|$|TiN-coated <b>high-speed</b> <b>steel</b> <b>drills</b> {{are known}} to give {{improved}} performance. However, when coatings are coupled with a careful selection of drill geometry parameters, the performance can be improved further. Consequently, in this work, progression of flank wear land width on four-faceted split-point plasma nitrided <b>high-speed</b> <b>steel</b> <b>drills</b> with varying point and helix angles in drilling of SS 304 was analyzed along with a conventional drill with a point angle of 118 degrees. Elaborate experimentation was undertaken to test the drills and capture the effect of flank wear on the drill performance. The drills with moderate point angle of 124 degrees outperformed other drills with point angles of 130 degrees and 118 degrees. As the wear progresses, the thrust and torque show a minor increase {{in the case of}} four-faceted drills as compared to the conventional drills.

40|$|Usage of {{stainless}} steel materials has increased continuously in various industrial applications. However the machinability of these materials is difficult. The stainless steels in general {{are considered to be}} difficult to machine materials. This is mainly due to the high plasticity and tendency to work-harden of the stainless steel, which usually results in severe cutting conditions. Additionally, stainless steels have much lower thermal conductivity as compared to structural carbon steels; this inflicts high thermal impact within the chip-tool contact zone, which significantly increases the cutting tool wear rate. High speed steels (HSS) tools are commonly used for drilling/tapping/turning operations. The surface is either untreated or coated with physical vapor deposition (PVD) coatings. In most cases TiN, TiCN or TiAlN coatings are used. The adhesion is of vital importance for the performance of tools coated with titanium nitride. Proper surface treatments (in situ and ex-situ) are required to achieve highly adherent coatings. We have deposited TiN coatings on <b>high-speed</b> <b>steel</b> <b>drill</b> bits and other substrates using a four-cathode reactive DC magnetron sputtering system. Various treatments have been given to the substrates for improved adhesion of the coating. The process parameters have been optimized to achieve thick and highly adherent good quality TiN coatings. These coatings have been characterized using a variety of techniques. The performance of the coated drill bits is evaluated by drilling a 13 mm thick 304 stainless steel sheet under wet conditions. The results are compared with the standard commercially available TiN coatings. ...|$|E
40|$|A Doctoral Thesis. Submitted in partial {{fulfillment}} of the requirements for the award of Doctor of Philosophy of Loughborough University. Ultrasonically Assisted Drilling (UAD) has received great interest {{in the past few}} years by both academia and industry. The technology has demonstrated a multitude of advantages over conventional drilling technology although its industrial employment has been mainly thwarted by inconsistent results and lack of development; a better understanding of the underlying dynamic process is required. This work commences with pertinent background information prior to delivering a critical and comprehensive literature survey on current UAD technology. From the literature survey, a key area requiring improvement is isolated, anda novel strategy is developed to address this. Standard <b>high-speed</b> <b>steel</b> <b>drill</b> bits are excited ultrasonically in their axial (longitudinal) direction and their vibration characteristics are recorded with respect to their tips longitudinal and torsional velocities. It is revealed that a pronounced vibration mode conversion or coupled motion occurs in the drill bit's structure. This has not previously been measured or documented and prompts a critical change in the design philosophy of UAD vibration systems. It also highlights the shortcomings of employing traditional drill bits and promotes the development of modem alternatives. Ultrasonically excited (standard) drill bits were employed to cut steel samples. During the UAD process, the excitation frequency was swept over a range of frequencies and the drilling reactions were recorded. The swept excitation signal employed is novel and unique to this work. As a result, clearly optimal regimes are revealed. A critical discussion is performed, and the workpieces that result from steady state UAD are evaluated with respect to their physical properties, and mechanisms that occur during UAD are proposed. Knowledge of these mechanism supports future UAD system development. A three-dimensional finite element modelling methodology is developed to further understand the UAD system's vibration characteristics. Simulation results show similar characteristics to the experimental data obtained although inconsistencies have been identified. Further work is necessitated to fully identify the numerical models developed with the experimental system. Routes by which this can be achieved are defined. The modelling techniques employed may be expanded to incorporate non-linear cutting forces, and are suitable for the development of a new generation of UAD technology...|$|E

40|$|Relatively low {{machinability}} of titanium and its alloys {{is caused}} mainly by their poor thermal conductivity, low modulus of elasticity, chemical reactivity with cutting tool materials at high temperatures and work bardening characteristics that produce high chip loads near the {{tool cutting edge}} of the tools.

Not much literature is available concerning this aspect of driIIing. This paper presents an investigation wherein cutting forces, acoustic emissions and chip formation were examined during deep-hole drilling of Ti- 6 M- 4 V at various cutting speeds and reed rates and optimum drilling parameters were detennined.

40|$|Due to {{the high}} {{financial}} and environmental cost of cutting fluids, there is a considerable driving force in many machining industries for a reduction in their use. However, any such reduction will be commercially acceptable only if the overall performance of machining operations can be maintained in dry conditions. This might be achieved {{through the use of}} coatings on cutting tools. TiB 2 -based coatings have been promoted as effective in improving the performance of tools used to machine Al alloys. In this work such coatings were deposited on <b>high-speed</b> <b>steel</b> <b>drills</b> by closed-field unbalanced magnetron sputter ion plating. Further drills were coated with commercial low-friction Graphit-iC (TM), and Dymon-iC (TM) or MoST (TM) coatings, and others left uncoated. These were tested in the dry drilling of automotive Al-Si alloys. The measured performance criteria were the tool lifetime and the dimensional accuracy of the drilled hole. Endof-tool-life in most cases was brought about by blockage of the drill flutes with adherent Al. Results show that, while all the coatings offer significant improvements over uncoated tools, exceptional results were achieved using the Graphit-iCTM coating. When compared to TiB 2 -Coated tools in air-cooled conditions this coating improved tool life by over 400 % and reduced the number of undersized holes by a similar amount. EDX analysis of used tools revealed that these coatings survived intact; therefore the improvements in performance are probably due to the reduced adhesion between the coatings and the aluminium.

While the study focuses on the reduction of macroparticles in titanium nitride coatings, the outcomes and key findings can be broadly applied to the cathodic arc process, in particular, for the reduction of macroparticles in more advanced CAE coatings. The results support earlier findings that have shown that poisoning of the cathode can reduce the number of macroparticles emitted from the arc spot. The results of glow discharge optical emission spectroscopy (GD-OES) showed that the titanium content of the coatings varied little between the respective coatings despite changes in the deposition pressure from 0. 1 to 1. 2 Pa.

For that purposes, architecture of wear- resistant complex was developed for formation on substrates of <b>high-speed</b> <b>steel.</b> Wear-resistant complex includes thermally stabilizing layer and three-element multi-layered composition nano-dispersion coating, and it can be formed by using the combined process of cathodic vacuum arc deposition with filtration vapour ion flow. The paper presents data on the optimization of the conditions for formation of the wear-resistant complex elements that provide a significant increase in tool life of <b>high-speed</b> <b>steel</b> tool both with continuous and interrupted cutting...|$|R
