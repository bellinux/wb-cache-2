40|$|The {{analysis}} on reliability aspects of wind power finds more significance {{as compared to}} that in conventional power generation systems. In spite of the intermittent and variable nature of wind energy, it can be usefully tapped to generate electrical power for meeting part of the energy demand of the population. The present paper undertakes an {{analysis on}} the reliable aspects of wind energy conversion system and applies to seven wind farms in Muppandal region in India. For the purpose of analysis, two reliability indices are used; one is coined as the period during which the <b>expected</b> wind <b>energy</b> is <b>not</b> <b>supplied</b> {{and the other one}} is the loss of load expectation index which analyzes the degree of matching of wind farm power generation with the load model.

30|$|Many recent nodal {{analysis}} {{studies have}} been assessing reliability issues using DR programs to boost system performance on all nodes. The studies, however, do not consider, or are limited by, the following factors: 1) unknown type {{of participants in the}} DR programs; 2) assuming or considering an ideal amount of interruptible loads without previous knowledge of nodal reliability and/or interruption capacity by node; and 3) considering only one period of time (generally, peak period), or three clusters (one around a demand peak; another off-peak and one in a valley). To address the limitations above, this paper develops a mechanism for obtaining high reliability nodal prices and compensating for nodal interruption, using incentive based programs (IBP) based on DR. The nodal identification of interruptible loads is based on the <b>expected</b> nodal <b>energy</b> <b>not</b> <b>supplied</b> (ENENS) and a structural decomposition of the system reserves in order to improve the loss of load probability (LOLP) reliability index. The method sets both a tariff for high nodal reliability performance and a “money back” payment incentive for interruptible loads. Thus, it offers users on DR programs a transparent, simple way to calculate their expected amount of reimbursements based on their level of service interruptions. The remainder of this paper is organized as follows. Section  2 describes the mathematical modelling. Section  3 describes methodology of the estimation of a representative annual demand curve. Section  4 describes the experimental section with an IEEE_RTS 24 -node system. Section  5 discusses the results of applying the methodology, and offers suggestions for future research.|$|R

It is shown that short-term reliability indices are essentially different from long-term (steady-state) indices. So, operative decisions for power system cannot be based on long-term indices.

30|$|Customer damage cost can be {{calculated}} by using the average unit interruption cost multiplied by the <b>expected</b> <b>energy</b> <b>not</b> <b>supplied</b> (EENS). The EENS is occurred when the system encounters the at-risk state, and therefore the EENS can represent the system risk deriving from a product of probability (i.e. unavailability) multiplied by its consequence (i.e. magnitude of load lost). The customer damage cost can {{be calculated}} by a product of EENS and the average unit interruption cost. It is assumed that the average unit interruption cost for the island load is equal to 10 $/kWh.|$|E

The statistics are extensive therefore allowing in-depth analysis of both customer and system related factors. From this starting point and {{as a model of}} explanation <b>energy</b> <b>not</b> <b>supplied</b> is studied as the consequence and the measurement of the inconvenience caused by outages. Different methods for calculating <b>energy</b> <b>not</b> <b>supplied</b> are developed and studied and put in comparison to the method used in Network Performance Assessment Model, which is the Swedish frame work for regulating electricity distribution. Analysis of the outage statistics show a relation between the type category of customer and outages that can be deduced to the variance and the density associated with that customer category. Prioritization of different customer categories is elevated also in this aspect. The variation in outage frequency between the different categories and parts of the grid is to be proven significant in relation to the <b>energy</b> <b>not</b> <b>supplied,</b> which has impact of the assessment of the Customer Reliability Value in the Network Performance Assessment Model.

30|$|However, {{conventional}} reliability {{evaluations of}} power systems concern more on real power adequacy problems [9, 10, 11, 12]. The reactive power-related reliability issues {{have not been}} separately studied in detail. The proposed reliability indices in most reliability evaluation techniques are related to adequacy aspect, such as the <b>expected</b> <b>energy</b> <b>not</b> <b>supplied</b> (EENS), expected load curtailment (ELC), etc. First, those indices are usually calculated using the proportional active load-shedding techniques. Second, system unreliability caused by reactive power shortage is hidden by those indices. Under-voltage load shedding is the least and lowest cost solution to severe voltage problems [13]. Some under-voltage load-shedding strategies including real and reactive power load curtailments are adopted to mitigate system voltage instability [13, 14, 15, 16, 17, 18] in real-time operation of power systems. It {{is a challenge to}} implement those techniques on reliability evaluation.|$|E
