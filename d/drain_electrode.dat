50|$|Single-molecule {{transistors}} {{are fundamentally}} different from the ones known from bulk electronics. The gate in a conventional (field-effect) transistor determines the conductance between the source and <b>drain</b> <b>electrode</b> by controlling the density of charge carriers between them, whereas the gate in a single-molecule transistor controls {{the possibility of a}} single electron to jump on and off the molecule by modifying the energy of the molecular orbitals. One of the effects of this difference is that the single-molecule transistor is almost binary: it is either on or off. This opposes its bulk counterparts, which have quadratic responses to gate voltage.|$|E
50|$|The field-effect {{transistor}} (FET) was first proposed by J.E. Lilienfeld, {{who received a}} patent for his idea in 1930. He proposed that a {{field-effect transistor}} behaves as a capacitor with a conducting channel between a source and a <b>drain</b> <b>electrode.</b> Applied voltage on the gate electrode controls the amount of charge carriers flowing through the system. The first field-effect transistor was designed and prepared in 1960 by Kahng and Atalla using a metal-oxide-semiconductor (MOSFET). However, rising costs of materials and manufacturing, as well as public interest in more environmentally friendly electronics materials have supported development of organic based electronics in more recent years. In 1987, Koezuka and co-workers reported the first organic field-effect transistor based on a polymer of thiophene molecules. The thiophene polymer {{is a type of}} conjugated polymer that is able to conduct charge, eliminating the need to use expensive metal oxide semiconductors. Additionally, other conjugated polymers have been shown to have semiconducting properties. OFET design has also improved in the past few decades. Many OFETs are now designed based on the thin-film transistor (TFT) model, which allows the devices to use less conductive materials in their design. Improvement on these models {{in the past few years}} have been made to field-effect mobility and on-off current ratios.|$|E

By adding a field plate to the <b>drain</b> <b>electrode,</b> a dramatic increase in the dynamic ON-resistance dynR (mathon) was identified. The dispersion effect is correlated with the high electric field below the drain field plate (DFP), the onset of which is caused by the full electron depletion from both the channel and the GaN cap layer. We show that the electron distribution is modified by the passivation method, backside bias, or surface charges and, hence, shifts the onset voltage of the trapping effect. Trapped electrons underneath the DFP are thought to be responsible for the measured rise of the dynR (mathon). With the introduction of an extended ohmic drain contact, the influence of a metallization overhang at the drain edge can be suppressed.
