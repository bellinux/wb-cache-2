5|$|In {{figure at}} left, the various {{segments}} {{that form the}} epitope {{have been shown to}} be continuously collinear, meaning that they have been shown as sequential; however, for the situation being <b>discussed</b> <b>here</b> (i.e., the antigen recognition by the B cell), this explanation is too simplistic. Such epitopes are known as sequential or linear epitopes, as all the amino acids on them are in the same sequence (line). This mode of recognition is possible only when the peptide is small (about six to eight amino acids long), and is employed by the T cells (T lymphocytes).|$|E
5|$|The {{most common}} uses for enzyme inhibitors are as drugs to treat disease. Many of these inhibitors target a human enzyme and aim {{to correct a}} {{pathological}} condition. However, not all drugs are enzyme inhibitors. Some, such as anti-epileptic drugs, alter enzyme activity by causing more or less of the enzyme to be produced. These effects are called enzyme induction and inhibition and are alterations in gene expression, which is unrelated {{to the type of}} enzyme inhibition <b>discussed</b> <b>here.</b> Other drugs interact with cellular targets that are not enzymes, such as ion channels or membrane receptors.|$|E

5|$|Matejko {{was fascinated}} by Stańczyk from the times of his youth, and portrayed him in several of his works (most notably, besides the {{painting}} <b>discussed</b> <b>here,</b> in Consecration of King Sigismund's Bell, 1874 and Prussian Homage, 1882). Working on this painting, Matejko was also inspired by the book Król zamczyska by Seweryn Goszczyński, whose main character– a loner, living in the castle's ruins, trying to reconcile past and present, and himself inspired by Stańczyk– likely influenced this painting. Completed in 1862, when Matejko was twenty four years old, {{it is one of}} his most famous works and the one that launched him to fame. It is seen as a key painting for the understanding of Matejko's style and intentions in his art. Matejko used his own face for Stańczyk, and with this work, began a series of paintings analyzing and interpreting the history of Poland through the figure of Stańczyk.|$|E

25|$|Three main {{driving forces}} used in {{different}} version of diffusion models are moisture content, the partial pressure of water vapour, and the chemical potential (Skaar, 1988; Keey et al., 2000).

40|$|The phase {{morphology}} of multi-component polymer blends {{is governed}} by the interfacial interactions of its components.

When sandwiched between two non-polar surfaces, characteristic lateral phase morphologies are observed after the film formation by spin-coating. We <b>discuss</b> <b>here</b> two techniques, by which hierarchical lateral structures in polymer films can be made. The first method makes use of two simultaneously occurring interfacial instabilities. The second technique employs {{the effect of a}} variation of the enthalpic interaction parameters in a ternary polymer mixture on its lateral polymer phase morphology...|$|R
