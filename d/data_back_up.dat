To cater this, {{in this article we}} recommend a remote <b>data</b> <b>back</b> <b>up</b> server(RDBS). The remote <b>data</b> <b>back</b> <b>up</b> server is a server which holds the main cloud’s entire data as a whole and locate at remote place(remote from cloud). And if the central repository lost its data, then it uses the information from the remote repository. The purpose is to help clients to gather information from remote storage area either if network connectivity is not existing or the main cloud is unable to make available the data to the clients in RDBS, if clients found that data is not available on central repository, then clients are allowed to access the files from remote repository (i. e. indirectly). The time related issues also being solved by an RDBS such that it will take minimum time for the recovery process. Recommended RDBS also focuses on the security concept for the backup files stored at remote server, without using of the existing encryption technique...|$|E
40|$|We propose communication-efficient {{distributed}} estimation and inference {{methods for}} the transelliptical graphical model, a semiparametric {{extension of the}} elliptical distribution in the high dimensional regime. In detail, the proposed method distributes the d-dimensional data of size N generated from a transelliptical graphical model into m worker machines, and estimates the latent precision matrix on each worker machine based on the data of size n=N/m. It then debiases the local estimators on the worker machines and send {{them back to the}} master machine. Finally, on the master machine, it aggregates the debiased local estimators by averaging and hard thresholding. We show that the aggregated estimator attains the same statistical rate as the centralized estimator based on all the data, provided that the number of machines satisfies m ≲{N d/d,√(N/(s^ 2 d)) }, where s is the maximum number of nonzero entries in each column of the latent precision matrix. It is worth noting that our algorithm and theory can be directly applied to Gaussian graphical models, Gaussian copula graphical models and elliptical graphical models, since they are all special cases of transelliptical graphical models.

40|$|The AIC 111 is an ultralow-power, {{fixed sample}} rate, sigma-delta codec {{with a sample}} rate of 40 kHz and a usable {{bandwidth}} of 10 kHz. Typically, most applications process data at sample rates of 8 kHz, 16 kHz, and 20 kHz. This requires that the DSP or microprocessor connected to the AIC 111 decimate the incoming data from 40 kHz down to the required sampling frequency, and interpolate the <b>data</b> <b>back</b> <b>up</b> to 40 kHz. This document outlines several methods and examples of resampling incoming data from the AIC 111 at 40 kHz to the required processing sampling rate between 8 kHz and 20 kHz using decimation and interpolation techniques on a digital signal processor (DSP) or a microprocessor. In many situations, {{it may also be}} possible to exploit characteristics of supplementary signal processing stages in the system to relax filter specifications or even remove certain resampling stages for additional savings in computation. The document also provides some suggestions on ways to exploit these characteristics. The document also addresses how to use the H-bridge output on the AIC 111 to drive speakers with varying impedance and bandwidth. Example routines have been developed specifically for use with the AIC 111 audi...|$|E

Cresas researchers offer an experimental teaching method to teams of teachers willing to have their practice evolve that way, they thereby encourage those teachers to focus their attention on the original ideas that children manifest when doing investigation and free communication activities. Videofilms about such dynamics are submitted to microanalyses, {{making it possible to}} grasp the way chidren become acquainted with a set of knowledge and through what microprocesses they elaborate some notional elements in the relevant field.

40|$|Rain has an {{important}} role in the hydrologic cycle. Rainfall (in mm) is the height of rain water which collected in a flat place and assuming that the water does not evaporate, does not sink in, and does not flow. This rainfall data is needed for agriculture and flood prevention, as used as an estimate for the construction of drainage channels, ditches, and irrigation. A device to measure rainfall is called rain gauge. The rain gauge that is designed in this thesis are expected to measure rainfall automatically using AT 89 S 51 microcontroller which organize and process data from the load cell sensor. Weight data will be generated by the load cell in any specific period, then it will be converted into data in units of millimeters according to standards specified by the WMO (World Meteorological Organization). The processed data will be stored in external memory such as an MMC (Multi Media Card) and sent to the user's computer by using a mobile phone. The data that has been stored on the MMC in a ". txt” extention can be taken periodically by the user as a <b>data</b> <b>back</b> <b>up</b> and can be read directly by PC. If data is required from a remote area, the user can send instructions to a mobile phone that has been connected with a sensor to transmit the rainfall data at the time.

This system, here named as the Enza Valley Deformation Zone (EVDZ), is SW–NE directed and trends obliquely to the main regional NW–SE-directed structural axis characterizing this part of the Northern Apennines nowadays. The syn-sedimentary activity is testified by: (1) local to regional stratigraphic unconformities, (2) lateral variations of sedimentary facies associations, (3) thickness changes of the stratigraphic units and (4) the occurrence of mass transport deposits. This study suggests that structural lineaments like the EVDZ, transversal to the main regional tectonic trends, may have played a long-term control on the syn-orogenic sedimentation atop the evolving Apennine orogen...|$|R
