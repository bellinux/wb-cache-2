The portico, which was removed in 1881, has been reconstructed at the western end of the building. The western gable end is punctuated by four arched windows, a pair above the portico and a single window either side of the portico. A lean-to extension is located at the eastern end of the southern facade. Entry to this section is through an arched door on the north facade. The church windows have clear <b>glass</b> set <b>in</b> wooden <b>mullions.</b> Those <b>in</b> the lean-to section are square, four paned windows.|$|R

50|$|There {{were a few}} {{short-lived}} copper mines <b>in</b> <b>Mullion</b> parish; first {{mentioned in}} a deed of 1741 and the mine(s) {{had a number of}} names; Ghost Croft, Goosecroft, Predannack Wartha, South Wheal Unity, Trenance and Wheal Providence. Wheal Unity (or Goosecroft), to the south of Churchtown, opened in 1847, and to the south-east of Pollurian Cove was a mid-19th-century copper mine called Wheal Fenwick. A native copper sheet, found in 1847, and with the dimensions of 9m x 1.4m x 15 cm and weighing over 700 kg, from Wheal Unity was exhibited at the 1851 Great Exhibition in London. Compared with the rest of Cornwall copper mining was insignificant and ceased {{by the end of the}} 19th century.

50|$|The land <b>in</b> <b>Mullion</b> Cove was {{controlled}} by the owners of Lanhydrock House, and any development required their authority. In 1798 the then landowner George Hunt died unmarried, and left the property to his niece, Anna Marie Hunt, who married Charles Agar in 1804. He died in 1811 and she ran Lanhydrock until 1829 when her son Thomas took over. He then took the additional name of Robartes, becoming Baron Robartes of Lanhydrock and Truro in 1869.|$|R
50|$|Deflection <b>in</b> <b>mullions</b> is {{controlled}} by different shapes and depths of curtain wall members. The depth of a given curtain wall system is usually controlled by the area moment of inertia required to keep deflection limits under the specification. Another way to limit deflections in a given section is to add steel reinforcement to the inside tube of the mullion. Since steel deflects at ⅓ the rate of aluminum, the steel will resist much of the load {{at a lower cost}} or smaller depth.|$|R
50|$|The {{building}} {{itself is a}} 120 ft steel frame high-rise with concrete plank floors. Its 11 stories are faced in sheets of composite and opaque glass over aluminum panels. At street level the main entrance has a small roof covering ingress to its lobby and the retail space there. Its lower five stories occupy its full footprint. The facing on them is black composite, with fenestration consisting of tall strip windows, some 8 by 18 ft, with two-inch (2 <b>in)</b> <b>mullions</b> concealing the venting, on the south face.|$|R

50|$|Even {{without a}} Lifeboat {{the role played}} by <b>Mullion</b> Cove <b>in</b> the 20th Century did not change. Even as {{recently}} as December 1932 there were reminders of the past. During strong SE gales a total of 84 cargo ships were forced to seek shelter <b>in</b> the <b>Mullion</b> Roads, Mounts Bay between 2 to 3 mi offshore. The majority were under 500 tons (gross tonnage) but there were at least 5 over 1000 tons. Once again the problem of ships food supplies also arose, and there was a danger of stores becoming exhausted. As it was, some of the smaller craft had to replenish their stocks of provisions in the village shops, thus causing a temporary shortage <b>in</b> <b>Mullion.</b> As the gale decreased the ships left their anchorage and departed for their destinations. Luckily however there were no losses and 20th century engineering had prevailed, but once again it had not beaten the adverse effects of the weather and the sea in the Mounts Bay.|$|R

Subsequently, she formed a vocal/trombone duo, The Tracy Sisters, who appeared in variety, on radio and television, as well as in cabaret all over the world.

She also qualified as a Special Policewoman in London.|$|R
5000|$|A fishing {{industry}} has been based <b>in</b> <b>Mullion</b> Cove for hundreds of years. There is reference to fishing boats on the Lizard Peninsula {{as early as the}} 1600s, with domestic state papers from the time of Charles I recording details of fishing boats and their crews often being captured by North African Barbary and Turkish pirates. A record of the Calendar of State Papers for 1636-1637 shows that [...] "At St. Keverne and Helford Creek seven more fisher boats were taken by the Turks... three were fisher boats belonging to St. Keverne, three others of Helston, and one more of Mollan (Mullion) and about 50 men in them".|$|R

50|$|As {{early as}} 1811 there were {{suggestions}} {{that there should}} be a Lifeboat at Porthleven and Mullion Cove.By the late 1850s, after an increasing number of shipwrecks and severe storms in which lives were lost, villagers and Lloyd's of London realised that a lifeboat was needed on the west coast of the Lizard Peninsula. In 1859 the RNLI also agreed, but despite Lord Robartes agreeing to help fund it, progress towards obtaining one was slow. The nearest lifeboats at that time were at Porthleven and Lizard Point. In a series of severe storms from January to April 1867, there were 16 shipwrecks in the Port of Penzance area. Three schooners, Cherub, Ebbw Vale and Margaret, were wrecked off the cliffs between <b>Mullion</b> and Poldhu <b>in</b> one storm on 5 January, with four lives lost. In the same storm there were five wrecks at Marazion. The villagers <b>in</b> <b>Mullion</b> held a public meeting chaired by the local vicar, Rev. Edmund George Harvey, calling for a lifeboat to be stationed at Mullion Cove. The RNLI responded and funds were raised by Lord Robartes, local Methodists, the RNLI and other generous contributors. Shortly afterwards, in March 1867, a barque, the Dutch Eastindiaman Jonkheer Meester van de Wall van Putterschoek, was wrecked <b>in</b> <b>Mullion</b> Parish, off the Men-y-Grib rocks south of Poldhu with the loss of 24 lives and only one survivor. For this man Georgio Buffani, a Greek sailor already injured, it was his third total shipwreck and the third time he had been the sole survivor. This was already the 15th wreck of the year in the Penzance Port area.|$|R

50|$|Although the Seine Boats {{were kept}} in the water for long periods during the Pilchard Season they were hauled out to a {{position}} above high water by a strong Winch when bad weather or storms approached. This would take place day or night. A capstan similar to that visible today <b>in</b> <b>Mullion</b> Cove was used but in the 19th century {{was surrounded by a}} strong wooden framework to assist winching. A capstan winch which has a similar but smaller framework and used for the same purpose, constructed by local miners from Geevor, is still in place today at the little cornish fishing cove of Penberth in the Parish of St. Buryan and can be visited there on foot from Porthcurno.|$|R
50|$|In 1793 the {{fishermen}} <b>in</b> <b>Mullion</b> Cove applied to Lanhydrock {{for permission to}} develop the cove as an inshore seine fishery, and by 1805 much of the pilchard catch was taken by boat to Penzance and Newlyn to be cured. In 1806 a total of 7000 hogsheads of pilchards were recorded taken from Mullion. It is likely that by this time several fish cellars had been built in Cove, putting the fishing on an economic footing. It {{should be noted that}} at that time the fishing had as much connection with Predannack as it did with Mullion, and it was hoped that the new industry would encourage occupation and building at Predannack. Even the roads at that time led to and from Predannack.|$|R
