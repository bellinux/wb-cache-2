50|$|A <b>defoamer</b> or an {{anti-foaming agent}} is a {{chemical}} additive that reduces and hinders {{the formation of}} foam in industrial process liquids. The terms anti-foam agent and <b>defoamer</b> are often used interchangeably. Commonly used agents are insoluble oils, polydimethylsiloxanes and other silicones, certain alcohols, stearates and glycols. The additive is used to prevent formation of foam or is added to break a foam already formed.|$|E
50|$|Generally a <b>defoamer</b> is {{insoluble}} in the foaming {{medium and}} has surface active properties. An essential feature of a <b>defoamer</b> product {{is a low}} viscosity and a facility to spread rapidly on foamy surfaces. It has affinity to the air-liquid surface where it destabilizes the foam lamellas. This causes rupture of the air bubbles and breakdown of surface foam. Entrained air bubbles are agglomerated, and the larger bubbles rise {{to the surface of}} the bulk liquid more quickly.|$|E

Obtained data set for defoaming action of additives of different chemical nature. The dependence of the speed of defoaming from chemical nature of <b>defoamers</b> and their number is studied. Found optimal concentration of <b>defoamers</b> and their mixtures in water dispersion system for painting of plastic products showed the presence of a synergistic effect when using a mixture of <b>defoamers</b> in the present systems. The mechanism of their defoaming actions was suggest...|$|R
50|$|Powder <b>defoamers</b> are in {{principle}} oil based <b>defoamers</b> on a particulate carrier like silica. These {{are added to}} powdered products like cement, plaster and detergents.|$|R
50|$|Alkyl polyacrylates are {{suitable}} for use as <b>defoamers</b> in non-aqueous systems where air release {{is more important than}} the breakdown of surface foam. These <b>defoamers</b> are often delivered in a solvent carrier like petroleum distillates.|$|R
50|$|Pulp and Paper Mill <b>Defoamer</b> and Wood Chip Regulation: regulates use of defoamers {{containing}} dibenzofuran or dibenzo-para-dioxin at {{pulp and}} paper mills using a chlorine bleaching process.|$|E
50|$|Processing {{requires}} {{the use of}} an anti-foaming agent or natural <b>defoamer</b> during the boiling step. Bringing filtered soy milk to a boil avoids the problem of foaming. It is generally opaque, white or off-white in color, and approximately the same consistency as cow's milk.|$|E
50|$|Siloxane chains {{consist of}} a {{backbone}} which contains alternating oxygen and silicon atoms. Surfactants with siloxane tails {{have been found to}} resist hydrolysis and prevent breakdown polymer chains which can cause cracking in the paint and are thus used in products such as cosmetics, deodorants, <b>defoamer,</b> and soap.|$|E
50|$|These {{are also}} heavy duty <b>defoamers</b> and {{are good at}} both {{knocking}} down surface foam and releasing entrained air.Silicone based <b>defoamers</b> are also suitable in non-aqueous foaming systems like crude oil and oil refining. For very demanding applications fluorosilicones may be suitable.|$|R
50|$|There {{are several}} ways to test <b>defoamers.</b>|$|R
50|$|The {{development}} of silicone based <b>defoamers</b> has continued, using different emulsifiers and modified silicone oils. In the early 1990s, silicone emulsion <b>defoamers</b> that caused less surface disturbances {{were used in}} the wood pulping industry with great success. These caused better washing, reduced biological oxygen demand (BOD) in effluent and reduced deposits.|$|R
50|$|US patent 4,444,925 {{lists the}} {{components}} of Gyp-CreteÂ® as atmospheric calcined gypsum, sand, water, and small amounts of various additives. Additives listed include polyvinyl alcohol, an extender such as sodium citrate or fly ash, a surfactant such as Colloid <b>defoamer</b> 1513 DD made by Colloids, Inc., and a fluidizer based on sodium or potassium derivatives of naphthalene sulfonate formaldehyde condensate. One example mix is shown below.|$|E
50|$|A {{solution}} of silver nitrate is mixed into a warm gelatin solution containing potassium bromide, sodium chloride or other alkali metal halides. A reaction precipitates fine crystals of insoluble silver halides that are light-sensitive. The silver halide is actually being 'peptized' by the gelatin. The type {{and quantity of}} gelatin used influences the final emulsion's properties. A pH buffer, crystal habit modifier, metal dopants, ripener, ripening restrainer, surfactants, <b>defoamer,</b> emulsion stabilizer and biocide are also used in emulsion making.|$|E
50|$|Oil based defoamers have an oil carrier. The oil {{might be}} mineral oil, {{vegetable}} oil, white oil {{or any other}} oil that is insoluble in the foaming medium, except silicone oil. An oil based <b>defoamer</b> also contains a wax and/or hydrophobic silica to boost the performance. Typical waxes are ethylene bis stearamide (EBS), paraffin waxes, ester waxes and fatty alcohol waxes. These products might also have surfactants to improve emulsification and spreading in the foaming medium.|$|E
50|$|Calcium {{stearate}} is {{a component}} in {{some types of}} <b>defoamers.</b>|$|R

50|$|As {{it has no}} odour, {{it finds}} use as anti-foaming agent in {{detergent}} solutions, and in various emulsions, paints, and adhesives. It is also found as a <b>defoamer</b> in ethylene glycol-borax antifreeze solutions. In oil-based lubricants addition of TBP increases the oil film strength. It is used also in mercerizing liquids, where it improves their wetting properties. It is also used as a heat exchange medium. TBP is used in some consumer products such as herbicides and water thinned paints and tinting bases.|$|E
50|$|US patent 4,075,374 {{lists the}} {{formulation}} as 10 parts pressure calcined gypsum, 38-48 parts sand, and 4-10 parts water. 0.03 to 0.1 {{parts of a}} latex emulsion, such as Dow Latex 460, were also added. To prevent foaming, a <b>defoamer</b> such as WEX {{was added to the}} latex at a concentration of 0.2%. It was stated that gypsum calcined at atmospheric pressure produced poor results due to it having flaky particles, and that gypsum calcined under a pressure of 15-17 psi produced better results because it had denser, crystalline particles.|$|E

50|$|The first <b>defoamers</b> {{were aimed}} at {{breaking}} down visible foam at the surface. Kerosene, fuel oil and other light oil products were used to break down foam. Vegetable oils also found some use. Fatty alcohols (C7 - C22) were effective but expensive antifoams. They were added to oil products to boost the efficiency. Milk and cream were forebears for modern day emulsion type <b>defoamers.</b>|$|R
50|$|During the 1950s, {{experiments}} with silicone based <b>defoamers</b> started. These {{were based on}} polydimethylsiloxane (silicone oil) dispersed in water or light oil. Silicone oils worked well, but caused surface disturbances in many applications like paints and papermaking. In 1963 the first antifoams with hydrophobic particles (hydrophobic silica) in light oil were patented. In the early 1970s, hydrophobic waxes like ethylene bis stearamide dispersed in oils developed. These types of <b>defoamers</b> were very efficient, but the oil crisis of 1973 made these too expensive and resulted in a push for reduction of the oil content. The solution was adding water. So water extended (water in oil emulsion) and water based (oil in water emulsion) <b>defoamers</b> appeared.|$|R
50|$|Silicones {{are used}} as active {{compound}} in <b>defoamers</b> due to their low water solubility and good spreading properties.|$|R
40|$|A <b>defoamer</b> coated PUF {{device was}} {{prepared}} and arranged within fermentor vessel in fixed and rotational positions {{at a particular}} height not touching the synthetic broth in the vessel. Foam was generated at constant rate continuously by air sparging, stirring in the vessel and observed for foam controlling efficiency of the device in terms of foam collapse rate and total hours of foam controlling achieved. The foam controlling efficiency of the present <b>defoamer</b> coated PUF device was compared with the automatic foam controlling method with the similar test parameters and conditions. It was observed that the foam collapse rates of both the methods are similar but varying in terms of foam controlling hours. There is definite foam controlling for about 23 hours and 20 minutes achieved by the fixed type <b>defoamer</b> coated PUF device, 28 hours achieved by the rotational type <b>defoamer</b> coated PUF device. The automated method has achieved defoaming for about 33 hours and 40 minutes. Based on the observations of the present study, <b>defoamer</b> coated PUF device {{can be used as}} a distribution device of <b>defoamer</b> as its foam controlling efficiency in terms of foam collapse rate is similar when compared with the automatic foam controlling method...|$|E
30|$|The lowest rub {{resistance}} values {{correspond to the}} formulation purely containing the <b>defoamer,</b> which is Formulation H, which is expected since the mineral oil <b>defoamer</b> leaves behind ink particles (from small <b>defoamer</b> droplets) after drying, which can be rubbed easily because they migrate to the surface [18]. On the other hand, the region near the high mass fractions of wax achieves high {{rub resistance}} because hard wax particles protrude in the ink surface and act as physical spacer between a rubbing medium and the surface [19], thereby {{reducing the amount of}} ink removed during rubbing.|$|E
40|$|Paints mostly {{consist of}} three major {{components}} which are binder, pigment/filler andsolvent. Many other components are added in smaller amount {{and these are}} calledadditives. One of these additives is defoamers which {{are added to the}} paint todecrease foam which can cause defects in the dried paint for example as pores. Thisstudy was about investigating if the defoamers can be identified and quantified withhigh performance liquid chromatography coupled to mass spectrometry. This includessample preparation, chromatographic separation and detector settings. Calibrationcurves where constructed for paints containing different concentrations of defoamerand for a paint with 0 % <b>defoamer</b> where different concentration of <b>defoamer</b> whereadded. Standard addition was done for a paint. Matrix effects were investigated bycomparing signal from <b>defoamer</b> in MeOH compared in paint. This study showed thatthe sample preparation of paints should involve dilution in MeOH or water followedby adding of formic acid and centrifugation and filtration to avoid problems in theinstrument. It is possible to identify if a <b>defoamer</b> is present in paint. Quantificationhas not been achieved, due to possible matrix effects and different response whendefoamer is added to the paint before analysis compared to when the <b>defoamer</b> isadded in the manufacturing process...|$|E
5000|$|<b>Defoamers</b> remove {{foam and}} {{speed up the}} {{production}} process. Drainage of washing equipment is improved and gives cleaner pulp.|$|R
50|$|<b>Defoamers</b> {{are used}} in many {{industrial}} processes and products: wood pulp, paper, paint, industrial wastewater treatment, food processing, oil drilling, machine tool industry, oils cutting tools, hydraulics, etc.|$|R
30|$|Several {{studies for}} ink {{additives}} and performance additives that {{would improve the}} print properties of water-based ink formulations [2]. Three additives generally used: (1) surfactants, (2) <b>defoamers</b> and (3) waxes. Surfactants are added to reduce the surface tension of water-based inks to allow adhesion on nonporous substrates; however, the presence of surfactants in the formulation results to production of stable foam during mixing. To address this problem, <b>defoamers</b> or anti-foaming agents are also added used as additives together with the surfactants in the formulations of printing inks. On the other hand, waxes are used to impart essential surface properties such as abrasion resistance.|$|R
30|$|From {{all of the}} {{water-based}} ink formulations used in this study, the formulation that best corresponds to the optimum mass fractions of additives determined is to be 0.50 wax, 0.50 surfactant, and no <b>defoamer.</b> It can be concluded that for the optimization criteria set for this study, the optimum formulation would contain only wax and surfactant and no <b>defoamer.</b>|$|E
30|$|Water-based ink {{formulations}} containing wax, surfactant, and <b>defoamer</b> additives {{were prepared}} and printed on polyethylene film substrates. Standard test methods for adhesion, rub resistance, and gloss were {{done on the}} printed polyethylene films. Quantitative methods for the assessment and evaluation of the three print properties were developed. Image analyses were done to quantify adhesion and rub resistance. Quantitative measurement was done to quantify gloss. Data were analyzed using mixture design modelling and optimization. Modelling results show that adhesion and gloss are described by special cubic model equations, while rub resistance is described by a linear model equation. Contour plots and 3 D surface graphs were generated showing the response surfaces of the print properties. The effects of varying the mass fractions of wax, surfactant, and <b>defoamer</b> on adhesion, rub resistance, and gloss were determined. It was found that increasing wax increases rub resistance, while increasing surfactant increases gloss, and increasing <b>defoamer</b> increases adhesion. There is dependency found between the mass fraction of wax, surfactant and <b>defoamer</b> {{with respect to the}} rub resistance, adhesion and gloss. Multi-objective optimization revealed that optimum adhesion, rub resistance, and gloss is obtained by a formulation containing equal mass fractions of wax and surfactant but no <b>defoamer.</b>|$|E
30|$|On {{the other}} hand, the lowest gloss values {{correspond}} to Formulation H and Formulation I, which contain purely of the wax {{and of the}} <b>defoamer,</b> respectively. The excess hardened polyethylene wax particles protrude and form a rough layer on the ink surface, while the excess <b>defoamer</b> result {{in the production of}} insoluble opaque, off-white liquid particles that migrate to the surface and form rough micro patches during drying.|$|E
50|$|EO/PO based <b>defoamers</b> contain {{polyethylene}} glycol and polypropylene glycol copolymers. They are delivered as oils, water solutions, or water based emulsions. EO/PO copolymers normally have good dispersing properties {{and are often}} well suited when deposit problems are an issue.|$|R
5000|$|PDMS is {{a common}} {{surfactant}} and is a component of <b>defoamers,</b> which are used to suppress the formation of foams. [...] PDMS, in a modified form, is used as an herbicidal penetrant and is a critical ingredient in water-repelling coatings, such as Rain-X.|$|R
50|$|Water based <b>defoamers</b> are {{different}} types of oils and waxes dispersed in a water base. The oils are often mineral oil or vegetable oils and the waxes are long chain fatty alcohol, fatty acid soaps or esters. These are normally best as deaerators, which means they are best at releasing entrained air.|$|R
