5|$|The USGS also {{measured}} discharge at {{the village}} of Larrys Creek, very near the creek's mouth, as part of water quality measurements on seven occasions between 1970 and 1975.

This {{may have been the}} lowest temperature operation of a Garratt type. The locomotive was used {{for a number of years}} for coal traffic in the Donbass region, but was never replicated. This decision appears to be a combination of unfamiliar maintenance processes and politics. The Russians later experimented with Mallet locomotives, the P34 2-6-6-2 and the P38 2-8-8-4.|$|E

50|$|<b>Height</b> <b>gauges</b> {{may also}} be used to measure the height of an object by using the {{underside}} of the scriber as the datum.

This adjustment allows different scribers or probes to be used, as well as adjusting for any errors in a damaged or resharpened probe.|$|R
