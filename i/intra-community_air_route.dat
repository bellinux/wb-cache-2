40|$|<b>Air</b> <b>route</b> network optimization, {{one of the}} {{essential}} parts of the airspace planning, is {{an effective way to}} optimize airspace resources, increase airspace capacity, and alleviate air traffic congestion. However, little has been done on the optimization of <b>air</b> <b>route</b> network in the fragmented airspace caused by prohibited, restricted, and dangerous areas (PRDs). In this paper, an <b>air</b> <b>route</b> network optimization model is developed with the total operational cost as the objective function while airspace restriction, <b>air</b> <b>route</b> network capacity, and non-straight-line factors (NSLF) are taken as major constraints. A square grid cellular space, Moore neighbors, a fixed boundary, together with a set of rules for solving the route network optimization model are designed based on cellular automata. The empirical traffic of airports with the largest traffic volume in each of the 9 flight information regions in mainland China is collected as the origin-destination (OD) airport pair demands. Based on traffic patterns, the model generates 35 <b>air</b> <b>routes</b> which successfully avoids 144 PRDs. Compared with the current <b>air</b> <b>route</b> network structure, the number of nodes decreases by 41. 67 %, while the total length of flight segments and <b>air</b> <b>routes</b> drop by 32. 03 % and 5. 82 % respectively. The NSLF decreases by 5. 82 % with changes in the total length of the <b>air</b> <b>route</b> network. More importantly, the total operational cost of the whole network decreases by 6. 22 %. The computational results show the potential benefits of the model and the advantage of the algorithm. Optimization of <b>air</b> <b>route</b> network can significantly reduce operational cost while ensuring operation safety...|$|R
