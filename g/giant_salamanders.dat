The blackbelly salamander (Desmognathus quadramaculatus) can bite an attacking common garter snake (Thamnophis sirtalis) {{two or three times}} its size on the head and often manages to escape.|$|E
2500|$|In , {{there are}} several types of creatures distantly related to dragons. There are <b>giant</b> <b>salamanders,</b> worms (long, quadrupedal serpents) and drakes (smaller, weaker, less {{intelligent}} forms of dragons.) There is also an undead dragon in the game, Thorog, resurrected {{by the forces of}} the Witch-king of Angmar to aid him in maintaining control over the Misty Mountains. Though not all dragons were mentioned by name in the official texts, names coming from sources other than Tolkien are said not to be [...] "canonical".|$|E

50|$|The California <b>giant</b> <b>{{salamander}}</b> (Dicamptodon ensatus) is {{a species}} of salamander in the family Dicamptodontidae.It is endemic to California, in the western United States. The species name once additionally included individuals now belonging to the species D. aterrimus (Idaho <b>giant</b> <b>salamander)</b> and D. tenebrosus (coastal <b>giant</b> <b>salamander),</b> under the common name Pacific <b>giant</b> <b>salamander,</b> which now refers to the genus and family.|$|R
50|$|The Pacific <b>giant</b> <b>salamander</b> (D. ensatus) {{was thought}} to consist of three {{geographic}} populations, an Idaho isolate, a group in northern California and a group in Oregon and Washington. In 1989 genetic studies showed that the D. ensatus populations consisted of three subspecies: the Idaho <b>giant</b> <b>salamander</b> (Dicamptodon aterrimus) in Idaho, and two highly divergent species with a narrow hybrid zone in California, the coastal <b>giant</b> <b>salamander</b> (Dicamptodon tenebrosus) (ranging from northern California to Washington) and the California <b>giant</b> <b>salamander</b> (Dicamptodon ensatus) (ranging from Santa Cruz County to Mendocino County).A fourth species of Dicamptodon, Cope's <b>giant</b> <b>salamander</b> (D. copei), lives on the Olympic Peninsula, Washington.|$|R

50|$|The family {{includes}} only {{a single}} genus, Dicamptodon. The genus was formerly thought to contain two species, Cope's <b>giant</b> <b>salamander</b> (D. copei) on the Olympic Peninsula, Washington, and the Pacific <b>giant</b> <b>salamander</b> (D. ensatus) which consisted of three geographic populations, an Idaho isolate, a group in northern California, and a group in Oregon and Washington. In 1989, genetic studies showed D. copei to be a distinct species, and the D. ensatus populations to consist of three species: the Idaho <b>giant</b> <b>salamander</b> (D. aterrimus) in Idaho, and two highly divergent species with a narrow hybrid zone in California, the coastal <b>giant</b> <b>salamander</b> (D. tenebrosus) (ranging from northern California to Washington), and the California <b>giant</b> <b>salamander</b> (D. ensatus) (limited only from Santa Cruz County to Mendocino County in California).|$|R
5000|$|Mount Dōgo {{is one of}} the {{remaining}} homes of the Japanese <b>giant</b> <b>salamander</b> (Andrias japonicus), the second largest salamander species in the world. The species, endemic to Japan, is closely related to the Chinese <b>giant</b> <b>salamander</b> and reaches a length of 1.5 m.

50|$|In {{the midst}} of all these {{conservation}} efforts being conducted, in the late 1970s, a programme network of nature reserves was established in China. These reserves were established to uphold four major principles. First, is to conserve typical ecosystems and to represent the biotic communities. Second, the reserves are meant to secure rare, endemic and valuable species, as well as their habitats or breeding locations. Third, these reserves were developed to rescue and regenerate deteriorated or damaged natural ecosystems and habitats of special significance. Finally, the reserves would be created in order to have sanctuaries in areas of special importance, such as seed forests, geological sections, glacial remains, watershed forest, etc. Many of these reservations were created for the overall protection of all endangered species of China and the conservation of the natural world they occupy. A few more reservations were made specifically with the idea of preserving Chinese <b>giant</b> <b>salamander</b> populations. Beginning in the 1980s, there have been more than 14 nature reserves established for the conservation of the Chinese <b>giant</b> <b>salamander.</b> Examples would be the Zhangjiaje <b>Giant</b> <b>Salamander</b> Nature Reserve, Lushi <b>Giant</b> <b>Salamander</b> Nature Reserve, Qingyaoshan <b>Giant</b> <b>Salamander</b> Nature Reserve, Youyang <b>Giant</b> <b>Salamander</b> Nature Reserve, and the Taibai <b>Giant</b> <b>Salamander</b> Nature Reserve.|$|R
50|$|Like other amphibians, the Chinese giant {{salamander}} is cold-blooded. Most Chinese <b>giant</b> <b>salamanders</b> stop feeding at water temperatures above 20 C and feeding ceases almost entirely at 28 C. Temperatures of 35 C are lethal to Chinese <b>giant</b> <b>salamanders.</b> As a consequence, {{the species is}} vulnerable to global warming.|$|E

50|$|Very {{large numbers}} are being farmed in China, {{but most of}} the {{breeding}} stock are either wild-caught or first-generation captive-bred. This is partially {{explained by the fact that}} the industry is relatively new, but some farms have also struggled to produce second-generation captive-bred offspring. Registrations showed that 2.6 million Chinese <b>giant</b> <b>salamanders</b> were kept in farms in 2011 in Shaanxi alone, far surpassing the entire countrywide wild population estimated at less than 50,000 individuals. Shaanxi farms (mainly in the Qinling Mountain region) accounted for about 70% of the total output in China in 2012, but there are also many farms in Guizhou and several in other provinces. Among 43 south Shaanxi farms surveyed, 38 bred the species in 2010 and each produced an average of c. 10,300 larvae that year. Farming of Chinese <b>giant</b> <b>salamanders,</b> herbs and mushrooms are the three most important economic activities in Shaanxi's Qinling Mountain region, and many thousand families rely on the giant salamander farms for income. The giant salamander farming mainly supplies the food market, but whether this can be achieved to an extent where the pressure on the wild populations is reduced is doubtful. Release of captive-bred Chinese <b>giant</b> <b>salamanders</b> is supported by the government (8,000 were released in Shaanxi in 2011 alone), but represent a potential risk to the remaining wild population, as diseases such as Ranavirus are known from many farms. Additionally, release of untreated wastewater from farms may spread diseases to wild Chinese <b>giant</b> <b>salamanders.</b>|$|E
