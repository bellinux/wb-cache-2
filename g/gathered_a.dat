5|$|Balink {{began work}} on the film in 1934, working with the Wong brothers, who served as cinematographers. They <b>gathered</b> <b>a</b> budget of 75,000 gulden– several times the budget of other local productions– and brought Franken from the Netherlands to assist in production. The film was edited in the Netherlands after being shot in the Indies. The film was a {{commercial}} and critical success with European audiences, but disliked by native ones; despite this success, Pareh bankrupted its producers.|$|E
5|$|Crawford led about 500 {{volunteer}} militiamen, {{mostly from}} Pennsylvania, deep into American Indian territory, {{with the intention}} of surprising the Indians. The Indians and their British allies from Detroit had already learned of the expedition, however, and <b>gathered</b> <b>a</b> force to oppose the Americans. After a day of indecisive fighting near the Sandusky towns, the Americans found themselves surrounded and attempted to retreat. The retreat turned into a rout, but most of the Americans managed to find their way back to Pennsylvania. About 70 Americans were killed; Indian and British losses were minimal.|$|E

The Mutiny of Álzaga took place on January 1, 1809. He accused Liniers of trying to appoint loyal members to the Cabildo, and <b>gathered</b> <b>a</b> small demonstration to request his resignation. The rebels, backed by some peninsular militias, occupied the Plaza. Liniers was about to resign, to prevent further conflicts.|$|E
5|$|From late August 1869 to May the {{following}} year, Levski {{was active in}} the Romanian capital Bucharest. He was in contact with revolutionary writer and journalist Lyuben Karavelov, whose participation in the foundation of the Bulgarian Literary Society Levski approved in writing. Karavelov's publications <b>gathered</b> <b>a</b> number of followers and initiated the foundation of the Bulgarian Revolutionary Central Committee (BRCC), a centralised revolutionary diasporic organisation that included Levski as a founding member and statute drafter. In disagreement over planning, Levski departed from Bucharest in the spring of 1870 and began to put into action his concept of an internal revolutionary network.|$|E

Beauchamp was released, but agreed to stay in Frankfort for ten days to allow the court to finish its investigation. During this time, Beauchamp wrote letters to John J. Crittenden and George M. Bibb requesting their legal aid in the matter. Neither letter was answered.

5|$|On 25 April 1915, the Australian and New Zealand Army Corps (ANZAC) {{landed on}} the western side of the Gallipoli Peninsula, at what {{thereafter}} became known as Anzac Cove. The first Turkish attempts to recapture the ANZAC beachhead were two unsuccessful attacks in April. Just over two weeks later, the Turks had <b>gathered</b> <b>a</b> force of 42,000 men (four divisions) to conduct their second assault against the ANZAC's 17,300 men (two divisions). The ANZAC commanders had no indication of the impending attack until the day before, when British aircraft reported a build-up of troops opposite the ANZAC positions.|$|E

5|$|Philip {{returned}} to Thessaly {{the next summer}} (either 353 or 352 BC, depending on the chronology followed), having <b>gathered</b> <b>a</b> new army in Macedon. Philip formally requested that the Thessalians join him {{in the war against}} the Phocians; the Thessalians, even if underwhelmed by Philip's performance the previous year, realistically had little choice if they wanted to avoid being conquered by Onomarchus' army. Philip now mustered all the Thessalian opponents of Pherae that he could, and according to Diodorus, his final army numbered 20,000 infantry and 3000 cavalry.|$|E
5|$|Responding to this attack, militia Colonel Henry Dodge <b>gathered</b> <b>a</b> {{force of}} twenty-nine mounted volunteers {{and set out}} {{in pursuit of the}} attackers. On June 16, Dodge and his men cornered about eleven of the raiders at a bend in the Pecatonica River. In a brief battle, the Americans killed and scalped all of the Natives. The Battle of Horseshoe Bend (or Battle of Pecatonica) was the first real American victory in the war, and helped restore public {{confidence}} in the volunteer militia force.|$|E
5|$|Selwood and Geelong {{finished}} {{the season with}} a 19-3 win-loss record to qualify for the finals series in second position on the ladder. Following consecutive wins against Hawthorn in the Qualifying Final and West Coast in the Preliminary Final, Geelong progressed through to the Grand Final against Collingwood. Selwood's performance in the final, during which he <b>gathered</b> <b>a</b> team-high 28disposals, laid 7tackles, and kicked 2goals, were recognised as he placed runner-up in Norm Smith Medal voting for the adjudicated best afield player. Geelong defeated Collingwood to record a 38point victory and earn Selwood his third premiership medallion in five seasons.|$|E

5|$|Soult rapidly <b>gathered</b> <b>a</b> new army {{from the}} French forces in Andalusia and, joining {{with the troops}} {{retreating}} before Beresford, he marched to relieve the siege. With intelligence of another approaching force—a Spanish army under Gen. Joaquín Blake—he planned to turn Beresford's flank and interpose his army between the two. However, Soult was again acting on outdated information; unknown to the Marshal, the Spaniards had already linked up with the Anglo-Portuguese corps, and his 24,000 troops now faced a combined Allied army 35,000 strong.|$|E
5|$|The {{imperial}} {{administration was}} coordinated by the chancery with headquarters at Persepolis, Susa, and Babylon with Bactria, Ecbatana, Sardis, Dascylium and Memphis having branches.

However, Darius <b>gathered</b> <b>a</b> group of scholars to create a separate language system only used for Persis and the Persians, which was called Aryan script which was only used for official inscriptions.|$|E

5|$|Upon its release, {{the film}} {{significantly}} under-performed {{at the box}} office, making $31.3 million worldwide against a budget of $70–80 million, which was blamed on an unusually poor marketing campaign. However, the film received widespread critical acclaim and was nominated for several awards, winning nine Annie Awards out of 15 nominations. Through home video releases and television syndication, the film <b>gathered</b> <b>a</b> cult following and is now widely regarded as a modern animated classic. In 2015, an extended, remastered version of the film was re-released theatrically, which saw a home video release the following year.|$|E

Green Goblin is later shown having <b>gathered</b> <b>a</b> new gang of followers together in the sewers formed from discarded members of other villains' gangs like Vulture, Owl and the third White Dragon's gangs. These henchmen escaped their organizations unharmed because Superior Spider-Man is more focused on the larger threats (where the original Spider-Man would focus on individuals).|$|E
