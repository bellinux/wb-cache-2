5|$|IFK Göteborg {{have used}} three other stadia as {{official}} home grounds. The first ground was Idrottsplatsen, in use from 1905 to 1915. It {{was built in}} 1896 for the cycling club Göteborgs Velocipedklubb, and was originally used for track cycling. During the 1909 season IFK Göteborg also used Örgryte IS' home ground of the time, Balders Hage, due to a conflict with the owners of Idrottsplatsen. The third official stadium was Walhalla Idrottsplats, used {{for a number of}} home matches {{at the same time as}} Idrottsplatsen. A fourth ground, Slottsskogsvallen, <b>has</b> <b>never</b> <b>been</b> <b>the</b> official home ground, but has nonetheless been used a number of times for IFK Göteborg home matches.|$|E

500|$|One of Usher's {{first steps}} in {{recording}} Confessions was deciding to reveal [...] "his own little secrets". Friend and former A rep named Kawan [...] "KP" [...] Prather thought the album {{would let the}} public know Usher personally. Prather said, [...] "The music <b>has</b> <b>never</b> <b>been</b> <b>the</b> question, but people tend {{to buy into the}} artist. The more they know about you, the more they feel like they're there with you." [...] Primarily because of the album's personal content, Usher said that this is his chance to be real. He named the album Confessions because he felt it is his most personal record to date: [...] "All of us have our Pandora's boxes or skeletons in our closets. I let a few of them out, you know. I've got a lot to say. I've got a lot of things and stuff built in me that I just want to let go of." [...] He wrote more songs than he contributed to his previous album.|$|E

[...] William McKeen, author of Rock and roll is here to stay: an anthology, felt that the image was another trigger and {{testament}} to the fact that Madonna was the last word on fashion for women and young girls of that era, the epitome of cool. Costume designer Arianne Phillips commented of the Like a Virgin look: [...] "This {{was one of the most}} shocking, liberating and influential moments in pop culture/fashion history... Fashion <b>has</b> <b>never</b> <b>been</b> <b>the</b> same." [...] Madonna herself declared: [...] "I have always loved to play cat and mouse with the conventional stereotypes. My Like a Virgin album cover is a classic example. People were thinking who was I pretending to be—the Virgin Mary or the whore? These were the two extreme images of women I had known vividly, and remembered from childhood, and I wanted to play with them. I wanted to see if I can merge them together, Virgin Mary and the whore as one and all. The photo was a statement of independence, if you wanna be a virgin, you are welcome. But if you wanna be a whore, it's your fucking right to be so." ...|$|E

500|$|Irene <b>has</b> <b>never</b> <b>been</b> <b>the</b> {{most admired}} of Johnson's works. [...] Even James Boswell found it wanting:Analysed into parts, it will furnish a rich store of noble sentiments, fine imagery, and {{beautiful}} language; {{but it is}} deficient in pathos, in that delicate power of touching the human feelings, which is the principle end of the drama. [...] Indeed Garrick has complained to me, that Johnson not only had not the faculty of producing the impressions of tragedy, {{but that he had}} not the sensibility to perceive them. Johnson's friend Bennet Langton recorded the author's own later disenchantment with the piece:At another time, when one was reading his tragedy Irene to a company at a house in the country, he [...] left the room; and somebody having asked him the reason of this, he replied, [...] "Sir, I thought it had been better."' The early 20th century consensus of opinion was summed up by George Sampson in 1941: [...] "Of his early tragedy Irene [...] it is enough to say that its moral dialogues, its correctness of plan and its smoothness of verse do not suffice to give it any rank as drama." [...] T. S. Eliot suggested an explanation for the play's unpopularity and neglect:His verse has none of the dramatic qualities; it is correct, but correctness in such isolation becomes itself a fault. [...] The play would be more readable to-day, if he had written it in rhyme; the whole would be more easily declaimed, and the good things more easily remembered; it would lose none of its excellence of structure, thought, vocabulary and figures of speech. [...] What would be mellifluous in rhyme, is merely monotonous without it.|$|E

Beckett said that Herbert became his closest friend in England: [...] "She has a great feeling for the work and is very sensitive and doesn't want to bang the nail on the head. Generally speaking, there is a tendency on the part of designers to overstate, and this <b>has</b> <b>never</b> <b>been</b> <b>the</b> case with Jocelyn." ...|$|E
2500|$|Halloween (1978) was a {{commercial}} success and {{helped develop the}} slasher genre. Originally an idea suggested by producer Irwin Yablans (titled The Babysitter Murders), who thought of a film about babysitters being menaced by a stalker, Carpenter took the idea and another suggestion from Yablans that it occur during Halloween and developed a story. Carpenter said of the basic concept: [...] "Halloween night. It <b>has</b> <b>never</b> <b>been</b> <b>the</b> theme in a film. My idea was to do an old haunted house film." [...] The film was written by Carpenter and Debra Hill with Carpenter admitting that the music was inspired by both Dario Argento's Suspiria (which also influenced the film's slightly surreal color scheme) and William Friedkin's The Exorcist.|$|E
2500|$|Throughout his forty-year plus career, Kabakov has {{produced}} {{a wide range of}} paintings, drawings, installations, and theoretical texts — not to mention extensive memoirs that track his life from his childhood to the early 1980s.

Unlike some underground Soviet artists, Kabakov joined the Union of Soviet Artists in 1959, and became a full-member in 1965. This was a prestigious position in the USSR and it brought with it substantial material benefits. In general, Kabakov illustrated children's books for 3–6 months each year and then spent the remainder of his time on his own projects.|$|E
