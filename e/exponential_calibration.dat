40|$|Calibrated {{diameter}} distension waveforms {{could provide}} an alternative for local arterial pressure assessment more widely applicable than applanation tonometry. We compared linearly and exponentially calibrated carotid diameter waveforms to tonometry readings. Local carotid pressures measured by tonometry and diameter waveforms measured by ultrasound were obtained in 2026 subjects {{participating in the}} Asklepios study protocol. Diameter waveforms were calibrated using a linear and an <b>exponential</b> <b>calibration</b> scheme and compared to measured tonometry waveforms by examining the mean root-mean-squared error (RMSE), carotid systolic blood pressure (SBPcar) and augmentation index (AIx) of calibrated and measured pressures. Mean RMSE was 5. 2 (3. 3) mmHg (mean(stdev)) for linear and 4. 6 (3. 6) mmHg for <b>exponential</b> <b>calibration.</b> Linear calibration yielded an underestimation of SBPcar by 6. 4 (4. 1) mmHg which was strongly correlated to values of brachial pulse pressure (PPbra) (R = 0. 4, P < 0. 05). <b>Exponential</b> <b>calibration</b> underestimated true SBPcar by 1. 9 (3. 9) mmHg, independent of PPbra. AIx was overestimated by linear calibration by 1. 9 (10. 1) %, the difference significantly increasing with increasing AIx (R = 0. 25, P < 0. 001) and by <b>exponential</b> <b>calibration</b> by 5. 4 (10. 6) %, independently {{of the value of}} AIx. Properly calibrated diameter waveforms offer a viable alternative for local pressure...|$|E
40|$|Fatigue {{characteristics}} of dual-phase steel sheets, {{commonly used in}} automobile body construction were established. For this purpose, a series of fatigue tests, each at constant stress amplitude were conducted on 1. 2 mm-thick, dual-phase DP 600 steel sheet specimens with two different load ratios of minimum-to-maximum stress, R = 0. 1 and - 1. The resulting fatigue behavior is {{expressed in terms of}} fatigue strength-life (S-N) curves. Fatigue behavior of the steel sheets in the high-cycle fatigue region can be represented by Basquin’s equation with coefficient and exponent value of 921. 2 and 0. 093, respectively. An endurance limit of 255 MPa is observed. In addition, fatigue strengths of the dual-phase steel sheets display lower magnitude than their bulk counterparts. Effect of mean stress on fatigue behavior of the steel sheets is well predicted by Walker’s model. <b>Exponential</b> <b>calibration</b> factor is introduced to the models by SWT, Goodman and Morrow with comparable prediction to the Walker’s mode...|$|E
40|$|Time-resolved {{cell culture}} assays {{circumvent}} {{the need to}} set arbitrary end-points and reveal the dynamics of quality controlled experiments. However, they lead to the generation of large data sets, which can represent a complexity barrier to their use. We therefore devel-oped the Time-Resolved Cell Culture Assay (TReCCA) Analyser program to perform stan-dard cell assay analyses efficiently and make sophisticated in-depth analyses easily available. The functions of the program include data normalising and averaging, as well as smoothing and slope calculation, pin-pointing exact change time points. A time-resolved IC 50 /EC 50 calculation provides {{a better understanding of}} drug toxicity over time and a more accurate drug to drug comparison. Finally the logarithmic sensor recalibration function, for sensors with an <b>exponential</b> <b>calibration</b> curve, homogenises the sensor output and enables the detection of low-scale changes. To illustrate the capabilities of the TReCCA Analyser, we performed on-line monitoring of dissolved oxygen in the culture media of the breast can-cer cell line MCF- 7 treated with different concentrations of the anti-cancer drug Cisplatin. The TReCCA Analyser is freely available at www. uni-heidelberg. de/fakultaeten/ biowissenschaften/ipmb/biologie/woelfl/Research. html. By introducing the program, we hope to encourage more systematic use of time-resolved assays and lead researchers to fully exploit their data...|$|E
40|$|Core top {{samples from}} Indonesian and {{northeast}} Atlantic depth transects {{were used to}} calibrate Mg/Ca and Î´ 18 O in tests of the calcitic benthic foraminifer Hyalinea balthica to bottom water temperature between 4 Â°C and 13 Â°C. This shallow infaunal species is primarily abundant in neritic to upper bathyal sediments (< 600 m). Both linear and <b>exponential</b> <b>calibrations</b> suggest a temperature sensitivity of â¼ 12 % per Â°C that is â¼ 4 times higher than observed in other species of deep-sea benthic foraminifera. Culture experiments support the core top calibration. We find no discernible effect of salinity and saturation on Mg/Ca. Comparison between the measured benthic foraminiferal Î´ 18 O and predicted equilibrium values suggests that on average H. balthica Î´ 18 O is 0. 64 â° Â± 0. 13 â° lower than predicted from the equilibrium composition. To test the reliability of using paired H. balthica Mg/Ca and Î´ 18 O measurements for reconstructing seawater Î´ 18 Osw and salinity, we apply this calibration to another depth transect from Cape Ghir off NW Africa, which {{was not included in}} the calibration. Based on error analysis of the calibration data and this validation test, we show that the uncertainty of reconstructing bottom water temperature and salinity from paired Mg/Ca and Î´ 18 O measurements of H. balthica is better than Â± 0. 7 Â°C and Â± 0. 69 practical salinity scale, respectively. The small uncertainties allow for the reconstruction of seawater density to better than 0. 3 ÏÎ¸ units, which is precise enough for the identification of specific water masses and reconstruction of changes in their properties. We propose that the relatively high Mg content and temperature sensitivity of H. balthica might be due to minor, biologically mediated contribution of high-Mg calcite to the primarily low Mg calcite test, which is influenced by the ambient temperature. This hypothesis, if correct, suggests that benthic species with relatively high Mg/Ca may be better suited for deepwater temperature reconstructions than species that have thus far been more commonly used.

40|$|Antarctic {{continental-scale}} glaciation {{is generally}} {{assumed to have}} initiated at the Eocene-Oligocene Transition, yet its subsequent evolution is poorly constrained. We reconstruct changes in bottom water temperature and global ice volume from 0 - 17 Ma using δ 18 O in conjunction with Mg/Ca records of the infaunal benthic foraminifer, O. umbonatus from ODP Site 806 (equatorial Pacific; 2500 m). Considering uncertainties in core-top calibrations and sensitivity to seawater Mg/Ca (Mg/Ca) sw we produce a range of Mg/Ca-temperature-Mg/Casw <b>calibrations.</b> Our favoured <b>exponential</b> temperature <b>calibration</b> is Mg/Ca = 0. 66 ± 0. 08 * Mg/Casw ^ 0. 27 ± 0. 06 * e(0. 114 ± 0. 02 * BWT) and our favoured linear temperature calibration is Mg/Ca=(1. 21 ± 0. 04 + 0. 12 ± 0. 004 * BWT) *(Mg/Casw ^ - 0. 003 ± 0. 02) (stated errors are 2 s. e.). The equations are obtained by comparing O. umbonatus Mg/Ca for a Paleocene-Eocene section from Ocean Drilling Program (ODP) Site 690 (Weddell Sea) to δ 18 O-temperatures, calculated assuming ice-free conditions during this peak warmth period of the Cenozoic. This procedure suggests negligible effect of Mg/Casw on the Mg distribution coefficient (DMg). Application of the new equations to the Site 806 record leads to the suggestion that global ice volume was greater than today after the Middle Miocene Climate Transition (14 Ma). ODP Site 806 bottom waters cooled and freshened as the Pacific zonal sea surface temperature gradient increased, and climate cooled through the Pliocene, prior to the Plio-Pleistocene glaciation of the northern hemisphere. The records indicate a decoupling of deep-water temperatures and global ice volume, demonstrating the importance of thresholds {{in the evolution of}} the Antarctic ice sheet...|$|R
40|$|Emission {{legislation}} for passenger cars {{has become more}} stringent and the increasing demand for reduced fuel consumption {{has resulted in the}} introduction of complex new engine and after-treatment technologies involving significantly more control parameters. Vehicle manufacturers employ a time consuming engine parameter calibration process to optimise vehicle performance through the development of engine management system control maps. The traditional static calibration methods require an <b>exponential</b> increase in <b>calibration</b> time with additional calibration parameters and control objectives. To address this issue, this thesis develops and investigates a novel Inverse Optimal Behaviour Based Dynamic Calibration methodology and its application to diesel engines. This multi-stage methodology is based on dynamic black-box modelling and dynamic system optimisation. Firstly the engine behaviour is characterized by black-box models, based on data obtained in a rapid data collection process, for accurate dynamic representation of a subject engine. Then constrained dynamic optimisation is employed to find the optimal input-output behaviour. Finally the optimal input-output behaviour is used to identify feedforward dynamic controllers. The current study applies the methodology to an industrial state-of-the-art WAVERT model of a 1. 5 litre Turbo EU 6. 1 Diesel engine acting as a virtual engine. The approach directly yields a feedforward controller in a nonlinear polynomial structure which can either be directly implemented in the engine-management system or converted to a dynamic or static look-up table format. The results indicate that the methodology is superior to the conventional static calibration approach in both computing efficiency and control performance. A low-cost Transient Testing Platform is presented in this work to carry out transient data collection experiments on a steady-state dynamometer with application to non-linear engine and emissions modelling using State Space Neural Networks. This modelling technique is shown to be superior to the polynomial models and achieves similar performance to non-linear autoregressive with exogenous input neural (NARMAX) network models. Numerical Dynamic Programming is investigated in a simplified engine calibration problem for a virtual engine to potentially improve the dynamic calibration optimisation stage. In a second study the novel dynamic calibration methodology is applied to the airpath control of a 3. 0 L Jaguar Land Rover (JLR) turbocharged Diesel engine utilizing a direct optimisation approach and State Space Neural Network models. A complete experimental application of the methodology is demonstrated in a vehicle where the vehicle-implemented calibration is obtained in a one-shot process solely from data obtained from the fast dynamic dynamometer testing. The results obtained demonstrate the potential of this methodology for the rapid development of efficient dynamic feedforward controllers based on limited data from the engine test bed...|$|R
40|$|Soil {{moisture}} {{measurements are}} essential to understand land surface–atmosphere interactions. In this paper we evaluate {{the performance of the}} low-cost 10 HS capacitance sensor (Decagon Devices, United States) using laboratory and field measurements. Measurements with 10 HS sensors of volumetric water content (VWC, Vol. %), integrated absolute soil moisture (millimeters) over the measured soil column, and the loss of soil moisture (millimeters) for rainless days are compared with corresponding measurements from gravimetric samples and time domain reflectometry (TDR) sensors. The field measurements were performed at two sites with different soil texture in Switzerland, and they cover {{more than a year of}} parallel measurements in several depths down to 120 cm. For low VWC, both sensor types present good agreement for laboratory and field measurements. Nevertheless, the measurement accuracy of the 10 HS sensor reading (millivolts) considerably decreases with increasing VWC: the 10 HS sensors tend to become insensitive to variations of VWC above 40 Vol. %. The field measurements reveal a soil type dependency of the 10 HS sensor performance, and thus limited applicability of laboratory calibrations. However, with site-specific <b>exponential</b> <b>calibration</b> functions derived from parallel 10 HS and TDR measurements, the error of the 10 HS compared to the TDR measurements can be decreased for soil moisture contents up to 30 Vol. %, and the day-to-day variability of soil moisture is captured. We conclude that the 10 HS sensor is appropriate for setting up dense soil moisture networks when focusing on medium to low VWC and using an established site-specific calibration function. This measurement range is appropriate for several applications in climate research, but the identified performance limitations should be considered in investigations focusing on humid conditions and absolute soil moistur...|$|E
