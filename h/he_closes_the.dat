When he tells Hud to put his half of their inheritance in the bank, his uncle replies that Lonnie now sees him as Homer did. Hud {{goes back into the}} Bannon house alone; as <b>he</b> <b>closes</b> <b>the</b> door, the final fade-out is the window shade's pull-ring swaying.|$|E
5|$|Michael Scott (Steve Carell) {{initially}} makes {{light of}} the exposure incident. After being shamed by how offended the other employees are by his antics, he attempts to reassert his sensitivity to women by holding a seminar on women's issues. <b>He</b> <b>closes</b> <b>the</b> meeting by offering to take the women to the Mall at Steamtown. Before leaving, he receives a call from Jan Levinson (Melora Hardin), who asks {{to meet with him}} to have sex. Michael balks at the proposal, and only becomes more uncomfortable when she offers to pay him for the sex.|$|E
5|$|After {{damaging}} {{the instrument panel}} with a medical ointment and decapitating the scientist, who {{turns out to be}} an android, Jim escapes from the laboratory through the sewer. While searching for Sara, Jim trips next to the wheelchair-bound man, suspects and attacks him. After realizing that he caused a scene and doubts the man's involvement, he returns to the room of the woman, where he discovers she has captured Sara, now wearing a Snow White costume. The woman rambles about her time as a character princess and tells him how bad things happen everywhere, including the decapitation at the park. She again hypnotizes Jim with the necklace, but Sara pulls it off and smashes it, freeing Jim from her spell. He returns to his hotel room and puts his family to bed. Jim suffers with digestive distress, vomits up a large amount of blood and hairballs, which he recognizes as symptoms of the cat flu and realizes that Sophie infected him. He begins to panic and bleed uncontrollably in the bathroom. Elliot enters and Jim begs him for help, but <b>he</b> <b>closes</b> <b>the</b> door on him.|$|E

500|$|The man {{is again}} {{lying on the}} bed, now in a gray suit. Hearing a knock, he starts the song playing again before {{opening the door to}} a woman (Natalie Portman). After staring at him for several seconds, the woman breaks the silence by asking what music is playing. Receiving no response, she steps into the room and {{presents}} the man with a bouquet of flowers. When she moves to kiss him on the mouth, he turns his head away and they embrace instead. <b>He</b> <b>closes</b> <b>the</b> door and asks how she found him; she replies that it [...] "wasn't actually that hard".

500|$|... « Toccata »: In this introduction, we are {{introduced}} to the narrator, and discover how he has ended up in France after the war. He {{is the director of}} a lace factory, has a wife, children, and grandchildren, though he has no real affection for his family and continues his homosexual encounters when he travels on business. He hints of an incestuous love, which we learn later was for his twin sister. He explains that he has decided to write about his experiences during the war for his own benefit and not as an attempt to justify himself. <b>He</b> <b>closes</b> <b>the</b> introduction by saying, [...] "I live, I do what can be done, it's the same for everyone, I am a man like other men, I am a man like you. I tell you I am just like you!" ...|$|E

He admits they're just friends and looks deflated. Maxine's sorry she assumed. He leaves. She can tell he's got it bad for Abby. In the square Gabi walks by, she drops her books and Cameron sees. He helps pick them up. Nick walks over, picks up Gabi's bag {{and hands it to}} Cameron saying [...] "You missed one." [...] It's awkward. He leaves and goes back to the hospital and texts Chad. They need to talk. Maxine tells Cam to find Gabi in the waiting room. She has questions about her brother's therapy. Cameron heads over and overhears Abigail tell Gabi she and Chad 'did it'. He shakes his head and looks upset. Cameron decides to pay Chad a visit and asks how could he lie to Abby and set her up? Chad notices his computer is open to the treatment search and feigns a headache. <b>He</b> <b>closes</b> <b>the</b> laptop as Cam gets him water. Chad apologizes that he had to lose in this situation. Cameron's worried about Abigail's vulnerability. Chad says Abby wanted it and gives him a reason to live.

2500|$|The Eleventh Doctor first {{appears in}} the final scene of The End of Time (2010) when his {{previous}} incarnation regenerates. Smith debuts fully in [...] "The Eleventh Hour", where he first meets Amy Pond (Karen Gillan) as a child while investigating a mysterious crack in her wall. Many years later, Amy joins the Doctor as his travelling companion {{on the eve of}} her marriage to Rory Williams (Arthur Darvill). In [...] "Victory of the Daleks", he is tricked into spawning a new generation of Daleks. In [...] "The Time of Angels"/"Flesh and Stone", he re-encounters future companion River Song (Alex Kingston) and his enemies the Weeping Angels, and learns that cracks like the one in Amy's wall are erasing individuals entirely from time and space. After Amy attempts to seduce the Doctor, the Doctor recruits Rory as a second companion from [...] "The Vampires of Venice" [...] up until [...] "Cold Blood", where he is killed protecting the Doctor and is erased from history. The Doctor also confronts his dark side in [...] "Amy's Choice", where he is put through trials by a manifestation of his self-loathing, the Dream Lord (Toby Jones). In the final episodes [...] "The Pandorica Opens" [...] and [...] "The Big Bang", an unknown force makes the TARDIS explode, causing the universe to collapse in on itself. Though <b>he</b> <b>closes</b> <b>the</b> cracks —reversing their effects and preventing the explosion— the Doctor himself is erased from history. River assists Amy in remembering the Doctor back into existence; he returns at her wedding to Rory, and the couple rejoin him as his companions. He next appears later in Death of the Doctor, a two-part story of spin-off series The Sarah Jane Adventures, alongside former companions Sarah Jane Smith (Elisabeth Sladen) and Jo Grant (Katy Manning), while Amy and Rory are on honeymoon.|$|E

60|$|The reader as <b>he</b> <b>closes</b> <b>the</b> {{book has}} {{on his mind}} a strong conviction, the strongest {{possible}} conviction, that among men George is as weak and Dobbin as noble as any that he has met in literature; and that among women Amelia is as true and Becky as vile as any he has encountered. Of so much he will be conscious. In addition to this he will unconsciously have found that every page he has read will have been of interest to him. There has been no padding, no longueurs; every bit will have had its weight with him. And he will find too at the end, if he will think of it--though readers, I fear, seldom think much of this in regard to books they have read--that the lesson taught in every page has been good. There may be details of evil painted so as to disgust,--painted almost too plainly,--but none painted so as to allure.|$|E

60|$|Part of this prophecy or {{probability}} {{has already}} been accomplished; the rest of it, {{in the absence of}} any protest, is in process of accomplishment. It would be easy to give an almost endless catalogue of examples, to show how, in dealing with the poorer classes at least, coercion has already come near to a direct control of the relations of the sexes. But I am much more concerned in this chapter to point out that all these things have been adopted in principle, even where they have not been adopted in practice. It is much more vital to realise that the reformers have possessed themselves of a principle, which will cover all such things if it be granted, and which is not sufficiently comprehended to be contradicted. It is a principle whereby the deepest things of flesh and spirit must have the most direct relation with the dictatorship of the State. They must have it, by the whole reason and rationale upon which the thing depends. It is a system that might be symbolised by the telephone from headquarters standing by a man's bed. He must have a relation to Government like his relation to God. That is, the more he goes into the inner chambers, and the more <b>he</b> <b>closes</b> <b>the</b> doors, the more he is alone with the law. The social machinery which makes such a State uniform and submissive will be worked outwards from the household as from a handle, or a single mechanical knob or button. In a horrible sense, loaded with fear and shame and every detail of dishonour, it will be true to say that charity begins at home.|$|E
60|$|The present writer, to {{whom this}} {{party has been}} {{described}} times out of number {{by members of the}} Loveday family and other aged people now passed away, can never enter the old living-room of Overcombe Mill without beholding the genial scene through the mists of the seventy or eighty years that intervene between then and now. First and brightest to the eye are the dozen candles, scattered about regardless of expense, and kept well snuffed by the miller, who walks round the room at intervals of five minutes, snuffers in hand, and nips each wick with great precision, and with something of an executioner's grim look upon his face as <b>he</b> <b>closes</b> <b>the</b> snuffers upon the neck of the candle. Next to the candle-light show the red and blue coats and white breeches of the soldiers--nearly twenty of them in all besides the ponderous Derriman--the head of the latter, and, indeed, the heads of all who are standing up, being in dangerous proximity to the black beams of the ceiling. There is not one among them who would attach any meaning to 'Vittoria,' or gather from the syllables 'Waterloo' the remotest idea of his own glory or death. Next appears the correct and innocent Anne, little thinking what things Time has in store for her at no great distance off. She looks at Derriman with a half-uneasy smile as he clanks hither and thither, and hopes he will not single her out again to hold a private dialogue with--which, however, he does, irresistibly attracted by the white muslin figure. She must, of course, look a little gracious again now, lest his mood should turn from sentimental to quarrelsome--no impossible contingency with the yeoman-soldier, as her quick perception had noted.|$|E
