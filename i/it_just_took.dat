500|$|Goldwater grew libertarian as {{he reached}} the end of his career, and chose to retire from the Senate in 1987. He was succeeded by John McCain, who praised his {{predecessor}} as the man who [...] "transformed the Republican Party from an Eastern elitist organization to the breeding ground for the election of Ronald Reagan." [...] Goldwater strongly supported the 1980 presidential campaign of Reagan, who had become the face of the conservative movement after his Time for Choosing speech. Reagan reflected many of the principles of Goldwater's earlier run in his campaign. Washington Post columnist George Will took note of this, writing, [...] "We...who voted for him in 1964 believe he won, <b>it</b> <b>just</b> <b>took</b> 16 years to count the votes." ...|$|E
500|$|The {{script was}} later rewritten and {{expanded}} when Lynch decided to {{transform it into}} a feature film. Describing the transition from an open-ended pilot to a feature film with a resolution of sorts, Lynch said, [...] "One night, I sat down, the ideas came in, {{and it was a}} most beautiful experience. Everything was seen from a different angle... Now, looking back, I see that [...] always wanted to be this way. <b>It</b> <b>just</b> <b>took</b> this strange beginning to cause it to be what it is." [...] The result was an extra eighteen pages of material that included the romantic relationship between Rita and Betty and the events that occurred after the blue box was opened. Watts was relieved that the pilot was dropped by ABC. She found Betty too one-dimensional without the darker portion of the film that was put together afterward. Most of the new scenes were filmed in October 2000, funded with $7million from French production company StudioCanal.|$|E

And if I do that, within a week, tops, I'll be smoking crack." [...] Following the plane crash, Goldstein was prescribed painkillers and anti-anxiety medication.

A friend of his reached the same conclusion, saying: [...] "I think the plane crash killed him, <b>it</b> <b>just</b> <b>took</b> a year for it to do it." [...] As a result of the plane crash, Goldstein developed a fear of flying, and continued consuming anxiety medication to help deal with the regular flights his lifestyle required.|$|E
500|$|According to Judith and Neil Morgan, {{the book}} sold well immediately. The trade edition {{initially}} sold {{an average of}} 12,000 copies a month, a figure which rose rapidly. Bullock's department store in Los Angeles, California, sold out of its first, 100-copy order of the book in a day and quickly reordered 250 more. The Morgans attribute these sales numbers to [...] "playground word-of-mouth", asserting that children heard about the book from their friends and nagged their parents to buy it for them. However, Houghton Mifflin's school edition did not sell as well. As Geisel noted in Jonathan Cott's 1983 profile of him, [...] "Houghton Mifflin... had trouble selling it to the schools; {{there were a lot}} of Dick and Jane devotees, and my book was considered too fresh and irreverent. But Bennett Cerf at Random House had asked for trade rights, and <b>it</b> <b>just</b> <b>took</b> off in the bookstores."

500|$|All {{but two of}} {{the drum}} tracks are {{composed}} of samples performed by drummer Colm Ó Cíosóig. Because Ó Cíosóig was suffering from physical and personal problems during the album's recording, samples of various drum patterns {{that he was able to}} perform in his condition were recorded. According to Shields, [...] "t's exactly what Colm would have done, <b>it</b> <b>just</b> <b>took</b> longer to do." [...] Ó Cíosóig recovered enough to play live on two of the album's songs, [...] "Only Shallow" [...] and [...] "Touched", the latter of which was composed and performed entirely by the drummer. Shields believes that listeners are unable to tell the difference between Ó Cíosóig's live drumming and the drum loops aside from the tracks intended to have an obviously [...] "sampled" [...] sound, like the dance-oriented [...] "Soon". The album makes extensive use of samples, with Shields stating, [...] "Most of the samples are feedback. We learnt from guitar feedback, with lots of distortion, that you can make any instrument, any one that you can imagine".|$|E

2500|$|Sea Change {{is based}} around a musical suite of reflective, acoustic-based songs that {{showcase}} Beck's singer-songwriter side. The term sea change {{is defined as}} a broad transformation, which reflects the departure in style from both Beck's previous effort Midnite Vultures and previous, sample-based recordings, as well as Beck's desire to give each album an identity. Origins for the album's unique, passionate sound had been building up for years, according to Beck in a 2002 interview: [...] "There are threads of what I've done before. If you listen to my earlier B- sides, you'll hear this record. I have been wanting to make this record for years," [...] he explained. [...] "I've been edging towards the idea, and so <b>it</b> <b>just</b> <b>took</b> a while."
