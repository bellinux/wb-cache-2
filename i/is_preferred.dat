5|$|Argon {{may be used}} as the {{inert gas}} within Schlenk lines and gloveboxes. Argon <b>is</b> <b>preferred</b> to less {{expensive}} nitrogen in cases where nitrogen may react with the reagents or apparatus.|$|E
5|$|Midazolam is also {{sometimes}} used in newborns who are receiving mechanical ventilation, although morphine <b>is</b> <b>preferred,</b> owing to its better safety profile for this indication.|$|E
5|$|Chavrusa {{learning}} {{takes place}} in the formalized structure of the yeshiva or kollel, as well as in Talmudic study that an individual does at any time of day. Although a man skilled in learning could study certain topics on his own, the chavrusa relationship <b>is</b> <b>preferred</b> to help him crystallize his thoughts.|$|E

5000|$|In {{univariate}} problems, it {{is usually}} acceptable to resample the individual observations with replacement ("case resampling" [...] below). In small samples, a parametric bootstrap approach might <b>be</b> <b>preferred.</b> For other problems, a smooth bootstrap will likely <b>be</b> <b>preferred.</b>|$|R
5000|$|The name Aplysiomorpha <b>was</b> <b>preferred</b> by Bouchet & Rocroi (2005) over Anaspidea Fischer, 1883, but {{the authors}} now {{agree that there}} is a {{consistent}} usage for Anaspidea in the recent literature and that the older name must <b>be</b> <b>preferred.</b>|$|R
5|$|If oral {{medications}} and mechanical treatments fail, the second choice is local injections: medications such as papaverine and prostaglandin that alter the blood flow and trigger erection are {{injected into the}} penis. This method <b>is</b> <b>preferred</b> for its effectiveness, but can cause pain and scarring.|$|E
5|$|Neptunium has valence {{states from}} 3 to 7, {{which can be}} {{simultaneously}} observed in solutions. The most stable state in solution is +5, but the valence +4 <b>is</b> <b>preferred</b> in solid neptunium compounds. Neptunium metal is very reactive. Ions of neptunium are prone to hydrolysis and formation of coordination compounds.|$|E
5|$|The {{antibiotic}} {{of choice}} in the United States for streptococcal pharyngitis is penicillin V, due to safety, cost, and effectiveness. Amoxicillin <b>is</b> <b>preferred</b> in Europe. In India, where the risk of rheumatic fever is higher, intramuscular benzathine penicillin G is the first choice for treatment.|$|E
25|$|The {{fundamental}} problem of cartography {{is that no}} map from the sphere to the plane can accurately represent both angles and areas. In general, area-preserving map projections <b>are</b> <b>preferred</b> for statistical applications, while angle-preserving (conformal) map projections <b>are</b> <b>preferred</b> for navigation.|$|R
50|$|The crucial {{difference}} between the two mechanisms is that the former would <b>be</b> <b>preferred</b> if theamine <b>is</b> a weaker ligand than the reacting alkyne, while the latter mechanism would <b>be</b> <b>preferred</b> if the amine were a better ligand than the alkyne.|$|R
50|$|Freestone {{refers to}} a drupe having a stone which can {{be removed from the}} flesh with ease. The flesh is not {{attached}} to the stone and {{does not need to be}} cut to free the stone. Freestone varieties of fruits <b>are</b> <b>preferred</b> for uses that require careful removal of the stone, especially if removal will be done by hand. Freestone plums <b>are</b> <b>preferred</b> for making homegrown prunes, and freestone sour cherries <b>are</b> <b>preferred</b> for making pies and cherry soup.|$|R
5|$|Argon {{may be used}} as {{the carrier}} gas in gas {{chromatography}} and in electrospray ionization mass spectrometry; it is the gas of choice for the plasma used in ICP spectroscopy. Argon <b>is</b> <b>preferred</b> for the sputter coating of specimens for scanning electron microscopy. Argon gas is also commonly used for sputter deposition of thin films as in microelectronics and for wafer cleaning in microfabrication.|$|E
5|$|Benzodiazepines can {{be useful}} for {{short-term}} treatment of insomnia. Their use beyond 2 to 4 weeks is not recommended due {{to the risk of}} dependence. It <b>is</b> <b>preferred</b> that benzodiazepines be taken intermittently and at the lowest effective dose. They improve sleep-related problems by shortening the time spent in bed before falling asleep, prolonging the sleep time, and, in general, reducing wakefulness. However, they worsen sleep quality by increasing light sleep and decreasing deep sleep. Other drawbacks of hypnotics, including benzodiazepines, are possible tolerance to their effects, rebound insomnia, and reduced slow-wave sleep and a withdrawal period typified by rebound insomnia and a prolonged period of anxiety and agitation.|$|E
5|$|Brussels' hosting of {{institutions}} {{has made it}} a major centre for the EU. Together with NATO it has attracted more journalists and ambassadors than Washington D.C. However the three-city agreement has been criticised, notably concerning the Parliament due to {{the large number of}} people that move between the cities. The European Green Party estimated that the arrangement costs 200million euro and 20,268 tonnes of carbon dioxide. Brussels <b>is</b> <b>preferred</b> by some due to the presence of other institutions and other groups whereas Strasbourg is supported due to its historical importance to European unity.|$|E
40|$|Dual choice feeding {{tests were}} {{performed}} to determine a preference of forager honeybees for specific amino acids. Artificial nectar containing proline <b>was</b> <b>preferred</b> over that containing only sugars. Nectar containing alanine <b>was</b> <b>preferred</b> on the first day, but preference was no longer significant thereafter. On the contrary, a negative response was found for serine. When the bees were given the choice between two nectars enriched with different compounds, proline <b>was</b> <b>preferred</b> above both alanine and serine, and alanine above serine...|$|R
30|$|In contrast, panning method B <b>was</b> <b>preferred</b> over {{non-expert}} {{mixes with}} over 90 % confidence. With at least 95 % confidence, {{we can also}} state that method B <b>was</b> <b>preferred</b> over method A. Yet when method B is compared against expert mixes, {{there is no significant}} difference.|$|R
40|$|We {{model the}} {{tradeoff}} between the balance {{and the strength}} of incentives implicit in the choice between hierarchical and matrix organizational structures.

5|$|D-dimers are a fibrin {{degradation}} product, and {{an elevated}} level {{can result from}} plasmin dissolving a clot—or other conditions. Hospitalized patients often have elevated levels for multiple reasons. When individuals are at a high-probability of having DVT, diagnostic imaging <b>is</b> <b>preferred</b> to a D-dimer test. For those with a low or moderate probability of DVT, a D-dimer level might be obtained, which excludes a diagnosis if results are normal. An elevated level requires further investigation with diagnostic imaging to confirm or exclude the diagnosis.|$|E
5|$|Even {{though most}} {{consumer}} items {{are in short}} supply in North Korea, there is a considerable variety of cigarettes available. In general, strong tobacco <b>is</b> <b>preferred,</b> and filters are rare. Western brands, particularly American, but also Chinese, Russian and Japanese are popular with the elite and preferred over domestic cigarettes. Foreign cigarettes and the domestic 727 brand, whose name stands for 27 July, the date of the Korean Armistice Agreement, are veritable status symbols. Menthol cigarettes are virtually non-existent, but there is competition among tobacco companies to introduce other attractive products, such as fruit-flavoured balls inside the filter to give the cigarette flavour.|$|E
5|$|In {{conformation}} showing, eyes {{should be}} brown in colour; yellow eyes do sometimes occur but are penalised {{in the show}} ring. Ears are small, pendulous (suspended and hanging), vine-shaped and with a light setter-like feathering. Nostrils are well developed and are black or any shade of brown; a pink nose is penalised in the AKC standard for the show ring, in Britain the colour is not specified in The Kennel Club's breed standard. In showing, a scissors bite <b>is</b> <b>preferred</b> with an undershot jaw severely penalised. Unlike the English Springer Spaniel and English Cocker Spaniel, there is no divergence into show and field styles of the breed.|$|E
50|$|If a {{bill was}} thrown out, {{although}} {{it could not}} again <b>be</b> <b>preferred</b> {{to the grand jury}} during the same assizes or sessions, it could <b>be</b> <b>preferred</b> at subsequent assizes or sessions, but not in respect of the same offence if a petty jury had returned a verdict.|$|R

5|$|Lithium {{isotopes}} fractionate substantially {{during a}} wide variety of natural processes, including mineral formation (chemical precipitation), metabolism, and ion exchange. Lithium ions substitute for magnesium and iron in octahedral sites in clay minerals, where 6Li <b>is</b> <b>preferred</b> to 7Li, resulting in enrichment of the light isotope in processes of hyperfiltration and rock alteration. The exotic 11Li is known to exhibit a nuclear halo. The process known as laser isotope separation can be used to separate lithium isotopes, in particular 7Li from 6Li.|$|E
5|$|Medications may be {{prescribed}} to treat sleep problems and depression. Analgesics such as ibuprofen {{can be taken}} for headache, but paracetamol (acetaminophen) <b>is</b> <b>preferred</b> {{to minimize the risk}} of intracranial hemorrhage. Concussed individuals are advised not to use alcohol or other drugs that have not been approved by a doctor as they can impede healing. Activation database-guided EEG biofeedback has been shown to return the memory abilities of the concussed individual to levels better than the control group.|$|E
5|$|Neptunium {{has five}} ionic {{oxidation}} states ranging from +3 to +7 when forming chemical compounds, {{which can be}} simultaneously observed in solutions. It is the heaviest actinide that can lose all its valence electrons in a stable compound. The most stable state in solution is +5, but the valence +4 <b>is</b> <b>preferred</b> in solid neptunium compounds. Neptunium metal is very reactive. Ions of neptunium are prone to hydrolysis and formation of coordination compounds.|$|E

5|$|Saree is the {{traditional}} dress of women in Karnataka. Women in Kodagu have a distinct style of wearing the saree, {{different from the rest}} of Karnataka. Dhoti, known as Panche in Karnataka, is {{the traditional}} attire of men. Shirt, Trousers and Salwar kameez are widely worn in Urban areas. Mysore Peta {{is the traditional}} headgear of southern Karnataka, while the pagadi or pataga (similar to the Rajasthani turban) <b>is</b> <b>preferred</b> in the northern areas of the state.|$|E
5|$|Sustainable use of {{materials}} has targeted {{the idea of}} dematerialization, converting the linear path {{of materials}} (extraction, use, disposal in landfill) to a circular material flow that reuses materials as much as possible, much like the cycling and reuse of waste in nature. This approach is supported by product stewardship and {{the increasing use of}} material flow analysis at all levels, especially individual countries and the global economy. The use of sustainable biomaterials that come from renewable sources and that can be recycled <b>is</b> <b>preferred</b> to the use on non-renewables from a life cycle standpoint.|$|E
5|$|The main {{inert gas}} in air is {{nitrogen}}, but nitrogen {{is not the}} only gas that can cause DCS. Breathing gas mixtures such as trimix and heliox include helium, which can also cause decompression sickness. Helium both enters and leaves the body faster than nitrogen, so different decompression schedules are required, but, since helium does not cause narcosis, it <b>is</b> <b>preferred</b> over nitrogen in gas mixtures for deep diving.|$|E
