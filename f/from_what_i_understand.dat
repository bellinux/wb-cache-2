2500|$|Todd Akin, {{a long-time}} anti-abortion activist, {{served as a}} Republican member of the House of Representatives for Missouri's 2nd congressional {{district}} from 2001 until 2013. On August 7, 2012, Akin won the Republican primary to become his party's nominee for the U.S. Senate election in Missouri. On August 19, Akin said that victims of what he termed [...] "legitimate rape" [...] rarely become pregnant. He said this during an interview aired on the St. Louis television station KTVI-TV when asked whether women who are raped and become pregnant should {{have the option of}} abortion. He replied:Well you know, people always want to try to make that as one of those things, well how do you, how do you slice this particularly tough sort of ethical question. First of all, <b>from</b> <b>what</b> <b>I</b> <b>understand</b> from doctors, that's really rare. If it's a legitimate rape, the female body has ways to try to shut that whole thing down. But let's assume that maybe that didn't work or something. I think there should be some punishment, but the punishment ought to be on the rapist and not attacking the child.|$|E

In reaction to the news of Parland's death, former band mate Lord Ahriman said, [...] "During the last couple of weeks, I was in close contact with David. He was going through an extremely difficult time of life, whereof he contacted me to ask for my help. Even though the two of us had a bit of a complicated relationship over the years (much excessive in the media though), he knew that he could ALWAYS call or visit me when needed, which he also did once in a while. Last time I talked to him was when he called me on March 15. <b>From</b> <b>what</b> <b>I</b> could <b>understand,</b> things were going in the right direction...

Had the note of the ladies been properly worded, I would have published an ample apology instantly--and possibly I might even have done so anyhow, had that note arrived at any other time--but it came at a moment when I was in the midst of what ought to have been a deadly quarrel with the publishers of the Union, and I could not come out and make public apologies to any one at such a time. It is bad policy to do it even now (as challenges have already passed between myself and a proprietor of the Union, and the matter is still in abeyance,) but I suppose I had better say a word or two to show the ladies that I did not wilfully and maliciously do them a wrong.|$|R

It seemed to them as something supernatural, and they were attending you carefully in order that if you recovered they might learn from you how you had come there, after which they would no doubt have killed you. Pita had some difficulty in obtaining my release, but upon his saying that, although belonging to another tribe, I was a great friend of his, they handed me over to him.

40|$|In a {{short story}} {{published}} {{a year ago in}} Technology Review, the American science fiction writer Bruce Sterling (2007) writes about an architect, Yuri, who in the not too distant future describes a possible scenario in which architecture ‘has given way to software management, so he turns buildings into brilliant yet often chaotic visions, easier to talk about than build’. “This design isn’t even a “building”, <b>from</b> <b>what</b> <b>I</b> can <b>understand.</b> The way in which the structure keeps turning around … it is a process permanently being constructed and deconstructed” This scenario projects us into a future that prefigures the possible consequences of the transformations in the entire production and construction process of an architectural project. Transformations already correctly identified by David Celento (2007) and influenced by the availability of new tools (such as rapid fabrication, parametric design and BIM-Building Information Management) which in turn determines the need for new professionals - defined by Kieran and Timberlake (2003) as ‘Digital Master Builders’ - capable of managing and integrating knowledge in order to create new architectural concepts. Current changes in production and construction and modern experimental architectural design do not correspond to a reorganisation of technological knowledge and education, still entrusted to obsolete and fragmented studies on techniques. These experiments demonstrate how scientific research and the contemporary architectural practice are contributing to establish new rules and principles to construction and how much innovation requires a revision of the teaching of building technology (at present relegated to being a specialist branch of Engineering) starting with the problem of integration between realistic practice and experimental research (on site or in the lab) ...|$|R

6000|$|But {{among all}} the reproaches which the Whigs have flung upon their adversaries, there is none hath done them more service than that of passive obedience, as they {{represent}} it, {{with the consequences of}} non-resistance, arbitrary power, indefeasible right, tyranny, popery, and what not? There is no accusation which has passed with more plausibility than this, nor any that is supported with less justice. In order therefore to undeceive those who have been misled by false representations, I thought it would be no improper undertaking to set this matter in a fair light, which I think has not yet been done. A Whig asks whether you hold passive obedience? you affirm it: he then immediately cries out, [...] "You are a Jacobite, a friend of France and the Pretender;" [...] because he makes you answerable for the definition he has formed of that term, however different it be <b>from</b> <b>what</b> you <b>understand.</b> <b>I</b> will therefore give two descriptions of passive obedience; the first as it is falsely charged by the Whigs; the other as it is really professed by the Tories, at least by nineteen in twenty of all I ever conversed with.|$|R

Ciara said, [...] ""My team actually kind of helped put that together. My A&R rep Mark Pitts and Label Group Chairman and CEO Barry Weiss, they kinda worked it out." [...] Ciara also confirmed she 3000 were supposed to collaborate before, commenting: [...] "When I was doing 2006's Evolution, I wanted him to do something with me, and we never got to do anything. It's just really great timing now that we get to do something. My fans are getting an unexpected treat with it. He is, <b>from</b> <b>what</b> <b>I</b> <b>understand,</b> very selective and ... protective of his creativity, so it just feels really good to be able to rock with him."

5000|$|Writer and {{director}} David Robert Mitchell conceived the film based on recurring dreams {{he had in}} his youth about being followed: [...] "I didn't use those images for the film, but the basic idea and the feeling I used. <b>From</b> <b>what</b> <b>I</b> <b>understand,</b> it's an anxiety dream. Whatever I was going through at that time, my parents divorced when I was around that age, so I imagine it was something to do with that." [...] The role that sexual transmission plays came later, from Mitchell's desire for something that could transfer between people. Mitchell started writing the film in 2011 while working on a separate film he intended to be his second feature film; however, Mitchell struggled with this would-be second feature and made It Follows as his next film instead. Mitchell realized that the concept he was working on was tough to describe and thus refused to discuss the plot when asked what he was working on, reasoning later, [...] "When you say it out loud, it sounds like the worst thing ever." ...|$|E

5000|$|Porn {{stars have}} differing {{views on the}} idea of women’s pornography. Some {{performers}} embrace the movement, like Asa Akira, an award-winning porn star. Akira stated “I’m part of the new era of porn. We’re feminists, very sex-positive people. We’re not victims of rape, not drug addicts, we don’t have any daddy issues.” [...] Some performers also note the problems in the industry and then turn to directing themselves, like Madison Young. Young felt that most mainstream adult film videos lacked substance and sent confusing and potentially harmful signals about sex and body image to viewers. As a result, she turned to directing to add to the new movement of porn. Madison makes sure to include verbal consent, body positivity, and inclusiveness to all her performances.Meanwhile, other performers fail to see the need for a specific type of porn just for women. As porn star James Deen put it, “Why is there porn explicitly only for women? By saying there needs to be porn for women, you’re basically isolating women as a gender, and saying, “This is how women should think. This is how their sexuality should be.” It’s counterproductive (<b>from</b> <b>what</b> <b>I</b> <b>understand)</b> to the equality movement.” ...|$|E

Fox color commentator Steve Lyons responded by saying that Piniella was [...] "hablaing Español" [...] - Spanglish for [...] "speaking Spanish" [...] - and added, [...] "I still can't find my wallet. I don't understand him, and I don't want to sit close to him now." [...] On October 13, 2006, Fox fired Lyons for making these remarks, which the network determined to be racially insensitive.

Piniella later stated {{that he thought that}} Lyons was just [...] "kidding" [...] and that Lyons was, per Piniella's experience, not bigoted.
