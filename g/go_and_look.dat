25|$|Brenda, still {{distressed by}} the fact that Dylan chose Kelly, began the fourth season in Minnesota, where she had decided to enter university. However, hearing about the break between Dylan and Kelly and realizing that she and her old friends from Minnesota have little in common, she decides to return to Beverly Hills and {{continue}} her studies at University of California. After her return, she met a rich young man named Stuart (whom Dylan knew of as a drug dealer in the past), and soon fell in love with him. The couple get engaged even in the first few weeks of their encounter and choose Las Vegas, forcing Dylan and his friends to come and try to stop them. They succeed by using reverse psychology, pretending that they are in favor of a marriage between the two young people. Brenda's life also took a few shots during the season. When Donna and Brenda find a puppy on the street, they learn that he escaped from an animal testing laboratory and are helpless when the puppy dies. Brenda then falls into a group of animal rights activists and participates with them in the ransacking of a number of laboratories until she is arrested (Donna decides at the last minute not to join the group). After her arrest, {{the only person in the}} group who supported her was Dylan; David Silver questioned her judgment, Andrea was angry that she had damaged laboratories that did not test animals and Kelly told her that Dylan was no longer her boyfriend and that Brenda could not <b>go</b> <b>and</b> <b>look</b> for help whenever she had a problem. It turned out that one of the activists was an FBI agent who offered Brenda a deal not to jail because she had not supported vandalism.|$|E
25|$|The Doctor and Stark {{run down}} to the room where Rivesh and Seruba are, but find that Seruba is cradling Rivesh. She reveals that Azlok has mortally injured him and he is dying. However, Surbua says there was {{something}} in the ship that could revive him, but Stark says that anything found in the ship was stored in the Area 51 vault, which hasn't been entered for some time as something got loose in there. The Doctor, Cassie, Jimmy, Seruba and Stark arrive at the vault, and the Doctor asks Jimmy and Cassie to find the TARDIS back at Dry Springs. Inside the vault, the Doctor and Seruba <b>go</b> <b>and</b> <b>look</b> for the device they need. Meanwhile, in the Viperox lair Azlok gets the Viperox Queen to release her newly hatched brood, so that they will destroy the whole town. Back in the vault, the Doctor comes across a swarm of Skorpius Flies, a carnivorous alien species that form a group mind. Seruba tells the Doctor she has found the device that could revive Rivesh, but the Skorpius Flies chase after them until the Doctor finds a crate and hides inside. He helps Seruba escape inside the crate by working out how many steps he took on the way in. At the Area 51 base Stark is informed that they are getting reports of Viperox attacks. He orders a row of tanks to block the Viperox off. The Doctor and Seruba shuffle out of the vault inside the crate so the flies won't notice. Meanwhile, Cassie and Jimmy are driving along with the TARDIS on the back of Jimmy's pickup truck when the Viperox burst out of the ground into their path.|$|E

2500|$|The Mexica {{story is}} that they came from a place called Aztlán, {{described}} as {{an island in the}} middle of a lake. Their god Huitzilopochtli told them to <b>go</b> <b>and</b> <b>look</b> for a promised land. They first arrived around the territory known as Culiacán by 960CE, but then left and returned to Aztlan. [...] Wandering from Aztlan again around the year [...] "1 Tecpatl" [...] or 1064–65 according to the codices Chimalpahin, Aubin and the Anales de Tlalteloco, they soon arrived at Pátzcuaro. They thought that was the land promised to them by Huitzilopochtli, but the god told them to continue. They went east and arrived at Chapultepec, on the edge of what was then Lake Texcoco. The god told them that their promised land was close but that they would have to fight for it. Their first opponent was a chief named Cópil, son of a witch named Malinalxochitl and sister of Huitzilopochtli. The Mexica surrounded Cópil's forces, captured and sacrificed the chief's heart to Huitzilopochtli.|$|E
