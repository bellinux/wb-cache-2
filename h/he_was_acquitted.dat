5|$|Tinker {{was also}} noted as a fighter. In {{addition}} to fighting Evers, Tinker defeated Egan {{in a fight}} after a game and fought Rabbit Maranville during a game. In 1908, {{he was arrested for}} assault when he got into a fight with a fan at a saloon he owned. <b>He</b> <b>was</b> <b>acquitted</b> of the charge.|$|E
5|$|Never one to shy from violent conflicts, Haywood was {{frequently}} {{the target of}} prosecutors. His trial {{for the murder of}} Frank Steunenberg in 1907 (of which <b>he</b> <b>was</b> <b>acquitted)</b> drew national attention; in 1918, he was one of 101 IWW members convicted of violating the Espionage Act of 1917 during the First Red Scare. In 1921, while out of prison during an appeal of his conviction, Haywood fled to Bolshevik Russia, where he spent the remaining years of his life.|$|E

5|$|While still {{residing}} in Lawton, Crawford's stepfather {{was accused of}} embezzlement. Although <b>he</b> <b>was</b> <b>acquitted</b> in court, he was blacklisted in Lawton, and {{the family moved to}} Kansas City, Missouri, around 1916. Following their relocation, Cassin, a Catholic, placed Crawford at St. Agnes Academy in Kansas City. When her mother and stepfather separated, she remained at St. Agnes as a work student, where she spent far more time working, primarily cooking and cleaning, than studying.|$|E
5|$|After the Independent Police Complaints Commission (IPCC) began a {{criminal}} inquiry, further autopsies indicated that Tomlinson {{had died from}} internal bleeding caused by blunt force trauma to the abdomen, in association with cirrhosis of the liver. The Crown Prosecution Service (CPS) decided not to charge Harwood, because the disagreement {{between the first and}} later pathologists meant they could not show a causal link between the death and alleged assault. That position changed in 2011; after the verdict of unlawful killing, the CPS charged Harwood with manslaughter. <b>He</b> <b>was</b> <b>acquitted</b> in 2012 and dismissed from the service a few months later.|$|E

5|$|In 1925, O'Leary was {{the subject}} of several scandals, being arrested for {{smuggling}} illegal immigrants and later for irregularities in his investigations. Although <b>he</b> <b>was</b> <b>acquitted</b> both times, he spent a week in prison following the second arrest and lost his job with the railway. Several months later, the municipal authorities in Hamilton, Ontario loaned him £70 to pay for him and his family to return to Ireland.

5|$|In 1998, Griffin {{was convicted}} of distributing {{material}} likely to incite racial hatred, for which he received a suspended prison sentence. In 2006 <b>he</b> <b>was</b> <b>acquitted</b> of separate charges of inciting racial hatred. Griffin has been criticised for many of his comments on political, social, ethical and religious matters, but after becoming leader of the BNP he sought {{to distance himself from}} some of his previously held positions, which include Holocaust denial. In recent years, events where Griffin has been invited to participate in public debates or political discussions have proven controversial and often resulted in protests and cancellations.|$|E
5|$|Investigators {{found that}} Fall and a {{relative}} {{had received a}} total of about $400,000 from Doheny and Sinclair, and that the transfers were contemporaneous with the controversial leases. Fall was ultimately convicted in 1929 for accepting bribes and, in 1931, became the first U.S. cabinet member to be imprisoned for crimes committed while in office. Sinclair was convicted only of contempt of court for jury tampering. Doheny was brought to trial before a jury in April 1930 for giving the bribe Fall had been convicted of accepting, but <b>he</b> <b>was</b> <b>acquitted.</b>|$|E

50|$|May 25, 1926. Sholom Schwartzbard assassinates Symon Petliura, {{head of the}} government-in-exile Ukrainian People's Republic, in Paris. After an eight-day trial, <b>he</b> <b>is</b> <b>acquitted</b> by the jury, who {{has been}} {{convinced}} of Schwartzbard's just cause: {{the core of his}} defense <b>was</b> that <b>he</b> <b>was</b> avenging the deaths of victims of pogroms by Petlura's forces.|$|R
60|$|And did <b>he</b> {{deserve to}} <b>be</b> <b>acquitted?</b> Yes, upon the whole <b>he</b> did;--to <b>be</b> <b>acquitted</b> of that special sin.

5|$|On May 12 President Arthur sailed on {{her second}} voyage to Palestine, {{counting}} Hemda Ben-Yahuda, {{the widow of}} Hebrew linguist Eliezer Ben-Yehuda, among her passengers. During the trip, an altercation between a Steward and the ship's master-at-arms resulted {{in the death of}} the latter while the ship was in Naples. Though the steward was arrested by Italian authorities, <b>he</b> <b>was</b> <b>acquitted</b> of murder by the Assize Court at Naples. After a return to New York, President Arthur sailed for Haifa on July 19 for what would be her last voyage for American Palestine.|$|E
5|$|A {{subsequent}} USAF investigation {{blamed the}} accident on several factors. The F-15 pilots were faulted for misidentifying the helicopters as hostile. Also, {{the crew members}} of the AWACS aircraft were blamed for their inaction in failing to exercise appropriate control and for not intervening in the situation. In addition, the {{identification friend or foe}} (IFF) systems had not functioned to identify the helicopters to the F-15 pilots. Furthermore, USAF leaders had failed to adequately integrate U.S. Army helicopter operations into overall OPC air operations. As a result of the investigation several USAF officers received administrative discipline but only one, Jim Wang, an AWACS crew member, was tried by military court-martial, in which <b>he</b> <b>was</b> <b>acquitted.</b>|$|E
5|$|After World War I, Girdap was {{deprived}} of its government protections, {{as it had}} no links to the new agrarian government of Aleksandar Stamboliyski. In 1919 Boncho Bonev was imprisoned in Berkovitsa for eight months before <b>he</b> <b>was</b> <b>acquitted,</b> Ivan Kovachev was put on trial, and the bank's funds were sealed. In 1922, the Bulgarian National Bank closed Girdap's account, causing 38 million leva of deposits in Girdap to be withdrawn by 1923 and its debtors (including members of Girdap's management) to protest their bills. While {{at the time the}} Bulgarian National Bank, Girdap's most important creditor, was opposed to Girdap's declaration of bankruptcy, it reversed its stance two years later. Girdap was declared bankrupt on 3 February 1925 and its managers Boncho Boev, Ivan Kovachev and Nikola Kovachev were arrested.|$|E

5|$|After {{the end of}} the campaign, Kork took {{command of}} the Kharkov Military District and later became {{assistant}} commander of the Armed Forces of Ukraine and the Crimea. In October 1922 he took command of the Turkestan Front, fighting against Basmachi rebels. During the late 1920s, Kork commanded the Caucasus Army, several military districts, and was the Soviet military attaché in Germany between 1928 and 1929. Returning from Germany, Kork became commander of the Moscow Military District. In 1935 he became head of the Frunze Military Academy with the rank of Komandarm 2nd rank. At this time he was the highest-ranking Estonian Red Army officer. During the Great Purge, Kork was arrested and shot as part of the Case of Trotskyist Anti-Soviet Military Organization. <b>He</b> <b>was</b> <b>acquitted</b> twenty years later.|$|E
5|$|In 1543, several {{conservative}} clergymen in Kent {{banded together}} to attack and denounce two reformers, Richard Turner and John Bland, before the Privy Council. They prepared articles {{to present to the}} Council, but at the last moment, additional denunciations were added by Stephen Gardiner's nephew, Germain Gardiner. These new articles attacked Cranmer and listed his misdeeds back to 1541. This document and the actions that followed were the basis of the so-called Prebendaries' Plot. The articles were delivered to the Council in London and were probably read on 22 April 1543. The king most likely saw the articles against Cranmer that night. The archbishop, however, appeared unaware that an attack on his person was made. His commissioners in Lambeth dealt specifically with Turner's case where <b>he</b> <b>was</b> <b>acquitted,</b> much to the fury of the conservatives.|$|E
5|$|In July 1905 then Viceroy of India, Lord Curzon, {{partitioned}} Bengal. This sparked {{an outburst}} of public anger against the British, leading to civil unrest and a nationalist campaign by groups of revolutionaries, who included Aurobindo. In 1908, Khudiram Bose and Prafulla Chaki attempted to kill Magistrate Kingsford, a judge known for handing down particularly severe sentences against nationalists. However, the bomb thrown at his horse carriage missed its target and instead landed in another carriage and killed two British women, {{the wife and}} daughter of barrister Pringle Kennedy. Aurobindo was also arrested on charges of planning and overseeing the attack and imprisoned in solitary confinement in Alipore Jail. The trial of the Alipore Bomb Case lasted for a year, but eventually <b>he</b> <b>was</b> <b>acquitted</b> on May 6, 1909. His defence counsel was Chittaranjan Das.|$|E

50|$|Anne was pre-judged for {{the earlier}} {{convictions}} {{of the men}} found guilty of adultery with her, therefore she stood trial before her brother. George stood trial {{a few hours after}} Anne on Monday 15 May. As Anne had been found guilty before George had stood trial <b>he</b> too <b>was</b> pre-judged because <b>he</b> could hardly <b>be</b> <b>acquitted</b> when his sister had already been found guilty of incest. The order of the trials had been very cleverly arranged to ensure the difficult case against George could not realistically fail. Everyone who witnessed George's trial, including the Imperial Ambassador Eustace Chapuys, confirmed that he put up a magnificent defence and many thought <b>he</b> would <b>be</b> <b>acquitted.</b> Chapuys confirmed that those watching were betting 10 to 1 that <b>he</b> would <b>be</b> <b>acquitted</b> and the court chronicler Charles Wriothesley said that his evidence was a marvel to hear.|$|R
