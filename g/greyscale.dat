Senthil Kumar had to use a special lens with a minimum f-stop of f8.0; the wide apertures required high-intensity lighting to get acceptable shots. He used GoPro cameras as they were the smallest possible ones that offered close to professional resolution. Phantom Cam was used to film extreme slow motion sequences; certain scenes were shot at 2,000 frames per second.|$|E

40|$|This study {{examined}} whether numerical cues affect spatial attention in left neglect. Patients with right parietal damage (four with neglect, three without) completed a dual task. Stimuli {{consisted of two}} <b>greyscales</b> overlayed with high numbers (8, 9), low numbers (1, 2) or neutral stimuli (#, &). Participants identified if the overlay was high, low or neutral and then made a relative luminance judgement for the <b>greyscales.</b> Neglect patients demonstrated a rightward <b>greyscales</b> bias in the neutral overlay condition, which was overcome by processing low numbers. Control patients showed a leftward bias in the neutral condition, which was overcome by processing high numbers. The results demonstrate that the spatial architecture of numbers induces shifts of attention, which can overcome left neglect...|$|R

40|$|The two {{cerebral}} hemispheres {{in humans}} {{have been suggested}} to control contralaterally opposed attentional biases. These biases may be revealed by unilateral hemispheric damage, which often causes contralesional spatial neglect, particularly when the right hemisphere (RH) is affected. Subtle attentional biases have also been observed in normal observers in tasks requiring judgements of horizontal spatial extent, brightness, numerosity and size. Here, we examined attentional biases for judging the darker of two left-right mirror-reversed brightness gradients under conditions of free viewing (the <b>greyscales</b> task). We compared performances of patients with damage to the RH (n = 78) and left hemisphere (LH; n = 20) with those of normal controls (n = 20). Controls showed a small but significant leftward bias, implying a subtle asymmetry favouring the RH. In contrast, RH and LH patients showed extreme rightward and leftward biases, respectively, both of which differed significantly from that of controls. For the patient groups, performance on clinical tests of neglect (cancellation and line bisection) did not predict their <b>greyscales</b> scores. Pathological biases were present in patients without clinical neglect or visual field defects, suggesting that the attentional bias measured by the <b>greyscales</b> task can be dissociated from clinical neglect and visual sensory loss. The <b>greyscales</b> task offers an efficient means of quantifying pathological attentional biases in unilateral lesion patients; {{it is easy to}} administer and score, and may be particularly useful for clinical trials of recovery and rehabilitation following stroke.

40|$|Neurologically normal {{individuals}} show a leftward spatial {{bias and}} tend to collide with objects {{on the right side}} more frequently than on the left. The upper visual field is associated with extrapersonal space, and mediated by the ventral stream through parvocellular projections. The lower visual field is associated with peripersonal space, and mediated by the dorsal stream through magnocellular projections. Upper and lower visual field differences have been observed in perceptual asymmetries but results have been mixed. Object- and space-based coordinates also both influence the leftward bias; however their relative contributions are unknown as similar spatial conditions are often collapsed across. More left-side collisions emerged on a route following task in the lower visual field and more right-side collisions were seen in the upper visual field (Thomas, Stuckel, Gutwin, & Elias, 2009). Left-handers made more right-side collisions in the central condition, whereas right-handers showed no bias. Leftward biases on the <b>greyscales</b> task were stronger in the lower visual field; however no distance-based differences were observed (Thomas & Elias, 2010). A stronger spatial bias was found on the <b>greyscales</b> task, whereas a stronger object-based bias was found on the object luminosity task (Thomas & Elias, in press). When individual spatial conditions were examined, the image chosen most often was always located in the lower field. Stimulus type and spatial location interacted to determine which coordinate type contributes more strongly to leftward biases. We also found that the leftward bias on the <b>greyscales</b> task was stronger in the lower visual field during prolonged presentation and in the upper visual field during brief presentation. A global motion task was created to preferentially engage magnocellular projections to the dorsal stream. Isoluminant red/green and blue/yellow colour tasks, which preferentially engage parvocellular projections to the ventral stream, were also created. Leftward biases were seen on the <b>greyscales</b> and motion tasks. On an isoluminant colour task, biases were significantly weakened, suggesting leftward biases exhibited by neurologically normal people are mediated by magnocellular projections to the dorsal stream and this preferential processing leads to a lower visual field advantage on the <b>greyscales</b> task...|$|R
40|$|In {{contrast}} to unilateral neglect patients, who overattend {{to the right}} hemispace, normal participants attend more to the left: a phenomenon known as pseudoneglect. Two experiments examined whether pseudoneglect results from object- or space-based attentional biases. Normal participants (n= 38, 22) made luminance judgments for two left/right mirror-reversed luminance gradients (<b>greyscales</b> task). The relative lateral position of the <b>greyscales</b> stimuli was manipulated so that object- and space-based coordinates were congruent or incongruent. A baseline condition was also included. A leftward bias, found for the baseline condition, was annulled in the incongruent condition, demonstrating an opposition of object- and space-based biases. The leftward bias was reduced in the congruent condition where object- and space-based biases {{were expected to be}} additive. This effect was attributed to extraneous factors, which were avoided in the second experiment by presenting the <b>greyscales</b> stimuli sequentially. Once again, no bias was observed in the incongruent condition where object- and space-based biases were opposed. The leftward bias in the congruent condition was the same as the baseline. The results can be explained by a combination of space- and object-based biases or by space-based biases alone and are discussed with reference to a variety of models, which describe the distribution of attention across space...|$|R

40|$|Turning {{the trunk}} or {{head to the}} left can reduce the {{severity}} of leftward neglect. This study sought to determine whether turning the trunk or head to the right would reduce pseudoneglect: A phenomenon where normal participants underestimate the rightward features of a stimulus. Participants made luminance judgements of two mirror-reversed <b>greyscales</b> stimuli. A preference for selecting the stimulus dark on the left was found. The effect of trunk-centred coordinates was examined in Expt. I by facing the head toward the display and turning the trunk to the left, right or toward the display. Head-centred coordinates were examined in Expt. 2 by directing the eyes toward the display and then turning the head and trunk. No effect of rotation was observed. It was concluded that the leftward bias for the <b>greyscales</b> task could be based on an object-centred attentional bias or left-to-right eye scanning habits. (C) 2003 Elsevier Inc.

40|$|No author {{version is}} {{available}} for upload (MF 8 Dec 2015) Neurologically normal individuals devote {{more attention to the}} left side; an asymmetry known as pseudoneglect, which reflects right hemisphere involvement in visuospatial attention. The role of eye movements in attentional asymmetries has received little consideration, particularly in terms of the <b>greyscales</b> task. Stimulus length, elevation, and presentation duration were manipulated, while monitoring eye movements during the <b>greyscales</b> task. Region of interest analyses compared time spent examining each quadrant of the stimulus. Further, saccades were examined in conjunction with fixations to gain an understanding of overall eye movement patterns. Scatterplots combining x-and y-coordinates illustrate mean eye position. Results demonstrated a comparison strategy was used, where the dark portions of each rectangle were fixated. Mean eye position was within the lower left quadrant. The left visual field was inspected most for the baseline condition. Interestingly, the lower visual field was examined most when duration, length, or elevation was manipulated. Eye movement patterns provide a possible explanation for why correlations are y not observed between visuospatial tasks. Different strategies, based on specific-task demands, are likely to be used, which in turn, engage separate aspects of visuospatial attention...|$|R

40|$|Healthy {{young adults}} display a {{leftward}} asymmetry of spatial attention ("pseudoneglect") {{that has been}} measured {{with a wide range}} of different tasks. Yet at present there is a lack of systematic evidence that the tasks commonly used in research today are i) stable measures over time and ii) provide similar measures of spatial bias. Fifty right-handed young adults were tested on five tasks (manual line bisection, landmark, <b>greyscales,</b> gratingscales and lateralised visual detection) on two different days. All five tasks were found to be stable measures of bias over the two testing sessions, indicating that each is a reliable measure in itself. Surprisingly, no strongly significant inter-task correlations were found. However, principal component analysis revealed left-right asymmetries to be subdivided in 4 main components, namely asymmetries in size judgements (manual line bisection and landmark), luminance judgements (<b>greyscales),</b> stimulus detection (lateralised visual detection) and judgements of global/local features (manual line bisection and grating scales). The results align with recent research on hemispatial neglect which conceptualises the condition as multi-component rather than a single pathological deficit of spatial attention. We conclude that spatial biases in judgment of visual stimulus features in healthy adults (e. g., pseudoneglect) is also a multi-component phenomenon that may be captured by variations in task demands which engage task-dependent patterns of activation within the attention network...|$|R
40|$|Every day {{individuals}} are bombarded with extraneous visual stimuli and consequently rely on selective spatial attention to effectively process task relevant information. However, individuals often show asymmetries in their spatial attention, a {{phenomenon known as}} spatial attention bias. Neuroanatomical, neurochemical, lesion, and genetic studies have converged to implicate dopamine, a catecholamine transporter, in modulating spatial attention bias. The current study utilised a double blind randomised control trial cross-over design to investigate the effect of Cabergoline, a dopamine D 2 agonist, on spatial attention bias. Participants consisted of 24 healthy males and underwent the <b>Greyscales</b> task, a well-validated perceptual measure of attentional bias, and a novel visual search task, to investigate how an increase in dopamine affected spatial attentional performance. It was hypothesised that Cabergoline would increase dopamine availability in the right hemisphere and drive attention leftwards. This was {{not supported by the}} <b>Greyscales</b> task however was partially supported by the novel visual search task as when participant’s responded under conditions of increased perceptual load, results suggested Cabergoline may have shifted attention leftwards which subsequently resulted in reduced attentional abilities available to deal with stimuli presented in the right hemifield. Furthermore, Cabergoline may have increased selective attention in the right hemifield when there were no competing distractors present from the left hemifield. Understanding how different neurotransmitters influence spatial attention and spatial bias is important as it may aid in the development of pharmacological treatments for clinical populations where spatial deficits are prominent...|$|R
