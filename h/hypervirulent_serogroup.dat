We describe a case of invasive meningococcal infection caused by serogroup X N. meningitidis with a unique sequence type (ST- 7) in China. The strain may have arisen from locally prevalent <b>hypervirulent</b> <b>serogroup</b> A clones by capsular switching events...|$|E
40|$|NadA is a trimeric autotransporter protein of Neisseria meningitidis {{belonging}} {{to the group of}} oligomeric coiled-coil adhesins. It is implicated in the colonization of the human upper respiratory tract by <b>hypervirulent</b> <b>serogroup</b> B N. meningitidis strains and is part of a multiantigen anti-serogroup B vaccine. Structure prediction indicates that NadA is made by a COOH-terminal membrane anchor (also necessary for autotranslocation to the bacterial surface), an intermediate elongated coiled-coil-rich stalk, and an NH 2 -terminal region involved in cell interaction. Electron microscopy analysis and structure prediction suggest that the apical region of NadA forms a compact and globular domain. Deletion studies proved that the NH 2 -terminal sequence (residues 24 to 87) is necessary for cell adhesion. In this study, to better define the NadA cell binding site, we exploited (i) a panel of NadA mutants lacking sequences along the coiled-coil stalk and (ii) several oligoclonal rabbit antibodies, and their relative Fab fragments, directed to linear epitopes distributed along the NadA ectodomain. We identified two critical regions for the NadA-cell receptor interaction with Chang cells: the NH 2 globular head domain and the NH 2 dimeric intrachain coiled-coil α-helices stemming from the stalk. This raises the importance of different modules within the predicted NadA structure. The identification of linear epitopes involved in receptor binding that are able to induce interfering antibodies reinforces the importance of NadA as a vaccine antigen...|$|E
40|$|Rifampin {{chemoprophylaxis}} against Neisseria meningitidis infections led to {{the onset}} of rifampin resistance in clinical isolates harboring point mutations in the rpoB gene, coding for the RNA polymerase β chain. These resistant strains are rare in medical practice, suggesting their decreased fitness in the human host. In this study, we isolated rifampin-resistant rpoB mutants from <b>hypervirulent</b> <b>serogroup</b> C strain 93 / 4286 and analyzed their different properties, including the ability to grow/survive in different culture media and in differentiated THP- 1 human monocytes and {{to compete with the}} wild-type strain in vitro. Our results demonstrate that different rpoB mutations (H 553 Y, H 553 R, and S 549 F) may have different effects, ranging from low- to high-cost effects, on bacterial fitness in vitro. Moreover, we found that the S 549 F mutation confers temperature sensitivity, possibly explaining why it is observed very rarely in clinical isolates. Comparative high-throughput RNA sequencing analysis of bacteria grown in chemically defined medium demonstrated that the low-cost H 553 Y substitution resulted in global transcriptional changes that functionally mimic the stringent response. Interestingly, many virulence-associated genes, including those coding for meningococcal type IV pili, porin A, adhesins/invasins, IgA protease, two-partner secretion system HrpA/HrpB, enzymes involved in resistance to oxidative injury, lipooligosaccharide sialylation, and capsular polysaccharide biosynthesis, were downregulated in the H 553 Y mutant compared to their level of expression in the wild-type strain. These data might account for the reduced capacity of this mutant to grow/survive in differentiated THP- 1 cells and explain the rarity of H 553 Y mutants among clinical isolates...|$|E

The recent introduction of this vaccine into the United Kingdom national immunization program should also help protect infants against this endemic strain. 26811872 PMC 473451...|$|R
40|$|BackgroundThe {{conjugate}} vaccine against serogroup A Neisseria meningitidis (NmA), MenAfriVac, {{was first}} introduced in mass vaccination campaigns of the 1 - 29 -year-olds in Burkina Faso in 2010. The {{aim of this study}} was to genetically characterize meningococcal isolates circulating in Burkina Faso before and up to 13 months after MenAfriVac mass vaccination. MethodsA total of 1, 659 meningococcal carriage isolates were collected in a repeated cross-sectional carriage study of the 1 - 29 -year-olds in three districts of Burkina Faso in 2010 and 2011, before and up to 13 months after mass vaccination. Forty-two invasive isolates were collected through the national surveillance in Burkina Faso in the same period. All the invasive isolates and 817 carriage isolates were characterized by serogroup, multilocus sequence typing and porA-fetA sequencing. ResultsSeven serogroup A isolates were identified, six in 2010, before vaccination (4 from carriers and 2 from patients), and one in 2011 from an unvaccinated patient; all were assigned to sequence type (ST) - 2859 of the ST- 5 clonal complex. No NmA carriage isolate and no ST- 2859 isolate with another capsule were identified after vaccination. Serogroup X carriage and disease prevalence increased before vaccine introduction, due to the expansion of ST- 181, which comprised 48. 5 % of all the characterized carriage isolates. The <b>hypervirulent</b> <b>serogroup</b> W ST- 11 clone that was responsible for most of meningococcal disease in 2011 and 2012 was not observed in 2010; it appeared during the epidemic season of 2011, when it represented 40. 6 % of the serogroup W carriage isolates. ConclusionsSuccessive clonal waves of ST- 181 and ST- 11 may explain the changing epidemiology in Burkina Faso after the virtual disappearance of NmA disease and carriage. No ST- 2859 strain of any serogroup was found after vaccination, suggesting that capsule switching of ST- 2859 did not occur, at least not during the first 13 months after vaccination...|$|E
