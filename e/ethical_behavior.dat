One of the important domains that the <b>ethical</b> <b>behaviors</b> of the managers affect at most is the organizational climate. Ethics takes on a task at the point of organizing and advocating the true and false concepts, and recommending the best to people. And, the organizational climate is a phenomenon that represents the scope and quality of the relationships of all the individuals in an organization and identifies the organization from the psychological aspect. The <b>ethical</b> <b>behaviors</b> of the managers are the power that can change the perceptions of the employees about the organization, and then the balances of the organizational climate. This study that was carried out via the survey technique has been implemented to persons in organizations located in Industrial Zone of Konya.

40|$|The study {{examines}} factors that mediate {{the impact of}} <b>ethical</b> leader <b>behavior</b> on leader effectiveness. Little is known about how ethical leadership impacts leader effectiveness. We hypothesized that prototypicality and trust sequentially mediate the relationship between <b>ethical</b> leader <b>behavior</b> and perceived leader effectiveness. The group prototype forms an ideal representation of the group’s identity, prescribing appropriate attitudes and <b>behaviors.</b> <b>Ethical</b> leaders are role models and thus {{are likely to be}} seen as the group prototype. In turn, prototypes are more trusted and effective. We investigated whether <b>ethical</b> leader <b>behavior</b> overall and different specific <b>ethical</b> leader <b>behaviors</b> (fairness, power sharing, and role clarification) influence prototypicality and, in turn, trust in the leader and leader effectiveness. This model was tested in a field study among 244 employees. Results showed that the relationship between overall <b>ethical</b> leader <b>behavior</b> and leader effectiveness is mediated by prototypicality and trust. For the separate dimensions of ethical leadership, we found full mediation by prototypicality and trust for the relationship between fairness and effectiveness and partial mediation for the relationship between role clarification and leader effectiveness.

Nurses deal with ethical issues in their daily practice. Changes in health care technology and allocation of resources, as well as the aging of our population, necessitate the practice of ethically sound nursing care. The {{purpose of this study was}} to describe how registered nurses (RNs) learn to be ethical practitioners. The research questions asked about the influences on the RNs' ethical development and how RNs learn to handle ethical situations encountered in professional practice. This qualitative study used the grounded theory approach and the technique of constant comparison. Theoretical sampling of individuals who believed themselves to be ethical practitioners was conducted. Eleven currently licensed RNs, with a minimum of two years work experience as a staff nurse in an acute care hospital, and one graduating nursing student (10 females and 2 males) were volunteer participants in one-half to one-hour audio taped interviews. The major themes that emerged from this study were experience, powerlessness, role models, at-risk patients, and nursing roles. The first three themes, derived from influences in the RNs' personal and professional lives, served as the foundation for the development of <b>ethical</b> <b>behaviors.</b> The last two themes, at-risk patients and nursing roles, represent the components of the nurse patient relationship through which the nurses demonstrated professional <b>ethical</b> <b>behaviors.</b> The following propositions were generated: First, nurses develop professional <b>ethical</b> <b>behaviors</b> through a process that involves the synthesis of influences from: (a) personal, family, nursing practice, environmental, and spiritual experiences; (b) feelings of powerlessness that arise with personal illness and family deaths, interactions with physicians, and unrealistic expectations for patient outcomes or one's professional performance; and (c) the observation of and interaction with family and friends, teachers, and nurses who served as role models. Second, through the nurse-patient relationship, the nurse is able to actualize <b>ethical</b> <b>behaviors</b> on behalf of a compromised (at-risk) patient...|$|R

25|$|Jainism is the {{religion}} of the followers of Mahavira. He {{is said to be the}} 24th Tirthankara, or the 24th in a line of teachers espousing Jain principles. Jains reject the Vedas and highlight the practice of austerity. Jain faith states that the jiva, or soul, can escape the cycle of rebirth and death through strict <b>ethical</b> <b>behavior.</b> When nothing remains but the purity of the jiva, that person is called a jina, or winner, which is the origin of the term Jain. Karma is viewed as an accumulation that burdens the soul, causing attachment and suffering. Ahimsa, or non-violence, is central to Jain faith and practice. It is interpreted very strictly as prohibiting all forms of harm to other living beings. Due to this, Jainism requires a strict vegetarian lifestyle. Ahimsa also applies to speaking, as one's words can cause harm and suffering.Fisher (1997). Pp 116-117.Rausch & Key (1993).|$|E
25|$|Corporate {{governance}} {{mechanisms and}} controls {{are designed to}} reduce the inefficiencies that arise from moral hazard and adverse selection. There are both internal monitoring systems and external monitoring systems. Internal monitoring can be done, for example, by one (or a few) large shareholder(s) {{in the case of}} privately held companies or a firm belonging to a business group. Furthermore, the various board mechanisms provide for internal monitoring. External monitoring of managers' behavior, occurs when an independent third party (e.g. the external auditor) attests the accuracy of information provided by management to investors. Stock analysts and debt holders may also conduct such external monitoring. An ideal monitoring and control system should regulate both motivation and ability, while providing incentive alignment toward corporate goals and objectives. Care should be taken that incentives are not so strong that some individuals are tempted to cross lines of <b>ethical</b> <b>behavior,</b> for example by manipulating revenue and profit figures to drive the share price of the company up.|$|E
