The video went viral and gathered attention by media; Knowles herself responded to it on her website, calling it [...] "brilliant", adding, [...] "I think he did this video better than I did". Will Goodman of CBS News described it as an [...] "amazing tribute" [...] and the [...] "cutest and most impressive tribute to Beyonce that has ever {{been done in the}} history of forever".

5000|$|... e-Captioning {{replaces the}} {{hardware}} encoding step with a non-linear file based workflow. [...] Since {{it can be}} accomplished via e-mail, FTP, or other file transfer methods, there are no costs for physically shipping a video tape, and less impact on the environment. This also means that e-Captioning can be performed faster, and the resulting video can be of higher quality {{due to the lack}} of generation loss. [...] Finally, e-Captioning opens up new options for delivering captioned video with tapeless video workflows, further <b>editing</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>video</b> in a non-linear editing system, or converting videos from one format to another (for example, from tape to web video) while preserving the closed captions.|$|E
5000|$|In 1985, Quantel {{released}} the [...] "Harry" [...] effects compositing system/non-linear editor. The Harry {{was designed to}} render special effects in non-real time to the video recorded on its built-in hard disk array (much like most computer based non-linear editing systems today). The hard disk array used drives made by Fujitsu, and were connected to the Harry using a proprietary parallel interface, much like a modern-day RAID array. Technically, {{it was the first}} all-digital non-linear editing system, since it could also do <b>editing</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>video</b> that was recorded on the Harry. Due to technical constraints of the time, the Harry could only record 80 seconds of video, albeit encoded in full broadcast-quality, uncompressed D1-style 8-bit CCIR 601 format. This aside, the Harry was quite an advanced machine, and the only system like it for its time.|$|E
50|$|Also {{included}} on the single releases were club remixes by Victor Calderone. One remixed version <b>of</b> <b>the</b> song was used in an alternative <b>edit</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>video,</b> which included more sexually explicit footage.|$|R

40|$|In 2014 the Brazilian {{society had}} the {{opportunity}} to debate the harsh period of its dictatorship after 50 years since the 1964 Military Coup. The main goal of this paper is the presentation of an Audio Description project with remarkable photos and videos from Brazilian Dictatorship and its reflections on Brazilian society. The project was elaborated by the research group “Accessible Media and Audiovisual Translation”, whose main focus is provide accessibility (audio description and subtitles) for different audiovisual products. We produced a photo documentary with an overview of some important images and with a script focusing on important information about Brazilian politics from 1964 up to 1989. Many steps were followed during the whole process: selection of photos, historical contextualization, script, narration, final <b>editing</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>video.</b> In order to produce the audio description scripts of photos and images selected, we have followed some assumptions about audio description. According to Matamala (2006 : 330) various competences are required to audio describers such as: “the ability to undertake intersemiotic translations (turning images into words), the ability to summarise information in order to adapt the text to the limited space available, keeping the original meaning, by means of rewording and by using synonyms; the ability to critically select the most relevant information”...|$|E

40|$|This thesis {{incorporates}} {{aspects of}} the author's three majors: anthropology, teaching English as a second language, and student personnel administration. A {{review of the literature}} on adaptation, teaching English as a second language, and orientation programs, demonstrated that being proficient in English and having gone through an orientation program have been said to aid in a foreign student's acculturation. To test this, previous video projects for orientation and teaching English as a second language were identified "and described and a pilot videotape and accompanying instructional manuals designed both to orient the student on one aspect of American culture and to contribute to the student's understanding of English were developed and tested. The thesis consists of a report on this project, including recommendations for further development of this approach and instructions on the use of such tapes in teaching English as a second language and in foreign student orientation programs. The pilot video dealt with how to open a checking and savings account. This videotape was developed by working closely with Ball State's Media Services and Merchants National Bank. People in Media Services did the actual taping and <b>editing</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>video,</b> while Merchants National Bank gave permission to tape the video at the Merchants Bank branch located in the Ball State Village area using bank personnel. To accompany the tape, a seven-day syllabus for using the tape for instruction in ESL classrooms and a "financial handbook" for foreign student orientation programs were developed. Arrangements were made to teach with the tape in an ESL classroom to test the effectiveness of it and the lesson plans. Effectiveness was measured by comparing the knowledge levels of the students before and after viewing the videotape. Additionally, the tape was shown to a group of foreign students during an orientation program. In both groups it was found that skills and knowledge of check writing, giving and receiving information, and financial terminology improved after seeing the video. Finally, both groups were asked for recommendations on ways the tape could be modified to make it more effective. This project produced guidelines for the development of further tape-based lessons to assist in the acculturation of foreign students to American life. Department of AnthropologyThesis (M. A. ...|$|E
