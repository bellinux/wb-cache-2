50|$|Ford Gum is a {{brand of}} bubble gum and chewing gum often found in <b>gum</b> <b>machines.</b> It is {{produced}} by Ford <b>Gum</b> & <b>Machine</b> Co. The history of the company goes back to 1913, when Ford Mason leased 102 machines and placed them in stores and shops in New York City. The gumballs, while they are covered with different flavors, {{all have the same}} flavor under the surface.|$|R

The Krogers were also put under close but discreet watch.|$|R
50|$|Founded in 1934, the Ford <b>Gum</b> and <b>Machine</b> Company of Akron, New York {{was another}} early {{manufacturer}} of <b>gum</b> for gumball <b>machines</b> in the U.S. The Ford brand of gumball machines had a distinct shiny chrome color; sales of gum from Ford gumball machines went to local service {{organizations such as}} the Lions Club and Kiwanis International.|$|R

5000|$|Gill's paintings, {{which he}} creates in small and {{sometimes}} very large scale sizes {{in his private}} studio, {{have been described as}} [...] "simplistic and layered...invitingly crafted and coloured.""Cemetery Park (2008) is as frisky and playful as <b>Gum</b> <b>Machine</b> (2008) (both acrylic and collage on panel), with the tombstones and crosses of the former as animated and full of bouncy colours as the latter's gumballs. Others pinwheel and spring with clouds of vanilla and spokes of red and orange. Their energy vaults from the walls." [...] His newer painted works, such as Smokestack/Flower (2010) and Black Water (2012) continue this theme. Gill's paintings have been exhibited locally, as well as nationally and internationally.|$|R

5000|$|Owd Grandad and Club-Paper Jack (Owd Grandad's {{friend who}} has never done an honest day's work in his life) plan {{what they call a}} [...] "big job" [...] after being {{inspired}} by the Great Train Robbery. After careful thought and planning, Jack and Owd Grandad plan to break into a chewing <b>gum</b> <b>machine</b> on the wall of a tobacconist's warehouse. Jack had seen many children purchasing chewing gum drawing the conclusion that the machine must be full of money.They discover that the machine in fact contains only 7 pence and are arrested following an alarm being triggered overhead.It is revealed, however, that the alarm was not in fact triggered by them but by burglars in the warehouse itself who got away with over Â£1000 worth of cigars.|$|R
2500|$|Caesar {{was able}} to {{pantomime}} {{a wide variety of}} things: a tire, a gumball machine, a lion, a dog, a punching bag, a telephone, an infant, an elevator, a railroad train, a herd of horses, a piano, a rattlesnake and a bottle of seltzer. On the Dick Clark show in 1978, he played a chewing <b>gum</b> <b>machine</b> and a slot machine. He was also able to create imaginary characters. Alfred Hitchcock compared him to Charlie Chaplin, and critic John Crosby felt [...] "he could wrench laughter out of you with the violence of his great eyes and the sheer immensity of his parody." [...] In an article in The Saturday Evening Post in 1953, show business biographer Maurice Zolotow noted that [...] "Caesar relies upon grunts and grimaces to express a vast range of emotions." ...|$|R

5000|$|One {{hypothesis}} for the name's origin is {{that the}} candy, when originally manufactured, was sold 6 for a penny in a bubble <b>gum</b> like <b>machine.</b> [...] Although the candies are currently sold {{in a variety of}} packages, the most comparable to the original is an 8 ball cellophane pack sold in bags containing several servings. A 6 ball tube was introduced in 2017.|$|R
50|$|Bulk vending {{dates back}} at least to the late 19th century. Vending {{machines}} were widely used in Europe before they became popular in the United States. In the early 1880s, the first commercial coin-operated vender was introduced in London and stocked with postcards. In 1888, the Thomas Adams Gum Co. introduced bulk venders to America, using the machines to sell Tutti frutti gum on elevated subway platforms in New York City. In 1897, the Pulver Manufacturing Company added animated figures to its <b>gum</b> <b>machines.</b> In 1907, the round, candy-coated gumball, a staple product in modern vending machines, was introduced http://www.gameroomantiques.com/HistoryGum.htm. In 1909, Emerson A. Bolen formed the Northwestern Novelty Company, selling the Yankee, a penny matchstick vending machine; Bolen's company {{is now one of the}} most prominent bulk vending machine manufacturers. In 1913, Ford Mason leased 102 machines and placed them in stores and shops of communities in western New York State; he would eventually found the Ford <b>Gum</b> & <b>Machine</b> Company, an empire of over 500,000 vending machines https://web.archive.org/web/20051113185502/http://www.fordgum.com/about_us.aspx. In 1948, Oak Manufacturing opened its doors; it would become one of the largest equipment manufacturers in the industry. In 1963, Josef Schwarzli founded Beaver Machine Corporation, designing and manufacturing his own equipment that is sold today into over 100 different countries worldwide. In 1949, Roger C. Folz purchased his first vending machine; Folz Vending was the largest operator of bulk vending equipment in the United States, owning and operating over 150,000 machines nationwide http://www.folzvending.com/index.cfm?npageid=6 at their peak.|$|R
2500|$|In about 1935, Mills {{was engaged}} by Coca-Cola {{to produce a}} {{standing}} dry automatic cooled vendor for bottles. [...] The result, the model 47, {{was the first of}} its kind for Cola-Cola. [...] By the late 1930s, <b>gum</b> vending <b>machines</b> were being installed by Mills Automatic Merchandising Corporation of New York. [...] The machines made use of technology protected by United States patents assigned to Mills Novelty Company, including number 1,869,616.|$|R
50|$|The McDermids {{owned and}} {{operated}} both O-Pee-Chee Company Limited and Somerville Paper Box Limited until 1944 when they sold the Somerville business to Garfield Weston. In 1945, O-Pee-Chee Company Limited was changed from a public company to a private company. For many years, National Novelty Company was a subsidiary of O-Pee-Chee Company acting as a retail outlet, selling candy goods over the counter, and also servicing <b>gum</b> vending <b>machines</b> in the area.|$|R
50|$|On early issues, gum {{was applied}} by hand, using a brush or roller, but in 1880 De La Rue {{came up with}} a <b>machine</b> <b>gumming</b> process using a {{printing}} press, and gum is now always applied by <b>machine.</b> The <b>gum</b> is universally spread as uniformly as possible.|$|R
50|$|Gumballs and chicles, {{a classic}} seller that {{can last for}} two years or more. Bubble gum sells well to children, while chewing gum sells better to adults. Dubble Bubble is {{reported}} to be a lower quality gum than Ford Gum and other brands. Gumballs sell best in machines by themselves, as opposed to being an option in a triple-selection <b>machine.</b> <b>Gum</b> is likely to become more popular among adults as more workplaces become smoke-free.|$|R
5000|$|The first {{vending machine}} in the U.S. was built in 1888 by the Thomas Adams Gum Company, selling gum on New York City train platforms. The idea of adding games to these {{machines}} as a further incentive to buy came in 1897 when the Pulver Manufacturing Company added small figures, which would move around whenever somebody bought some <b>gum</b> from their <b>machines.</b> This idea spawned a whole new type of mechanical device known as the [...] "trade stimulators".|$|R
5000|$|Located nearly {{opposite}} [...] "Laff in the Dark", was the Penny Arcade, where patrons found various coin-operated amusements {{such as a}} Punching Ball, a [...] "Strength Meter", {{a mechanical}} [...] "Fortune Teller", an [...] "Electrocution" [...] machine, [...] ", [...] "Skee Ball" [...] games, Souvenir Photo Booths, various coin-activated <b>gum</b> and candy <b>machines,</b> and an antique, [...] "Peep Show" [...] - which was a coin-operated, crank-driven, photo-flipping, [...] "Cail-O-Scope" [...] featuring, among other themes, a Circa 1880's dance routine by [...] "Little Egypt". (Contrary to what {{is shown in the}} feature film, Rollercoaster, there was no live belly dancer appearing in the park.) ...|$|R
5000|$|Since its {{inception}} in March 2011, Genjing Records has issued dozens of 7-inch singles, 10-inch EPs, and LPs from bands such as AM444, Demerit, Dear Eloise, Duck Fight Goose, the Fever <b>Machine,</b> <b>Gum</b> Bleed, Round Eye, Snapline, Wang Wen (ç½è) and Fanzui Xiangfa. [...] At {{its inception}} in 2011, the label was only conceived as a platform through which founder Nevin Domer's local Beijing hardcore band Fanzui Xiangfa (ç¯ç½ªæ³æ³) could release and distribute their own recordings on vinyl records during a European tour with the German hardcore band SS20 [...] The success of this first release provided encouragement for developing Genjing Records into a full, vinyl-only independent record label in China. Nevin had also noticed that the renewed global interest in vinyl records he experienced during the Fanzu Xiangfa European Tour was also beginning to take root in China with a nascent record collecting community. Nevin then formally established the mission of Genjing Records {{as a means to}} facilitate the release of materials vinyl by Chinese bands and artists.|$|R
