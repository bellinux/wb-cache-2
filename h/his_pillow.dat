5|$|Suffering {{from what}} would today be {{described}} as post traumatic stress disorder (PTSD), Murphy slept with a loaded handgun under <b>his</b> <b>pillow.</b> He looked for solace in addictive sleeping pills. In his last few years, he was plagued by money problems but refused offers to appear in alcohol and cigarette commercials {{because he did not}} want to set a bad example. Murphy died in a plane crash in Virginia in 1971, which was shortly before his 46th birthday. He was interred with full military honors at Arlington National Cemetery. His grave is one of the most visited sites in the cemetery.|$|E

25|$|Ibn Wahshiyya and Abu Nu'ayn tell {{a second}} {{story in which}} a Meccan {{merchant}} visiting Syria is invited to a Christian monastery where a number of sculptures and paintings depict prophets and saints. There he sees the images of Muhammad and Abu Bakr, as yet unidentified by the Christians.

25|$|The Fidai {{were trained}} to {{be some of the}} most feared assassins in the then known world. Sinan ordered assassinations ranging from {{politicians}} to generals such as the great Kurdish general and founder of the Ayyubid dynasty, Saladin. A sleeping Saladin had a note delivered to him by a Fidai planted in his trusted entourage. The note from Sinan was pinned to <b>his</b> <b>pillow</b> by a dagger and informed Saladin that he had been spared this once; and therefore to give up his anti-Nizari militancy. A shaken Saladin quickly made a truce with Sinan.|$|E
25|$|The {{image of}} the ninja entered popular culture in the Edo period, when folktales and plays about ninja were conceived. Stories about the ninja are usually based on {{historical}} figures. For instance, many similar tales exist about a daimyō challenging a ninja to prove his worth, usually by stealing <b>his</b> <b>pillow</b> or weapon while he slept. Novels were written about the ninja, such as Jiraiya Gōketsu Monogatari, which was also made into a kabuki play. Fictional figures such as Sarutobi Sasuke would eventually {{make their way into}} comics and television, where they have come to enjoy a culture hero status outside their original mediums.|$|E

25|$|Francia {{took several}} {{precautions}} against assassination. He would lock the Palace doors himself, unroll the cigars his sister made to ensure {{there was no}} poison, prepare his own yerba mate, and sleep with a pistol under <b>his</b> <b>pillow.</b> Even so, a maid tried to poison him {{with a piece of}} cake. No one could come within six paces of him, or even bear a cane near him. Whenever he would go out riding, he had all bushes and trees along the route uprooted so that assassins could not hide; all shutters had to be closed, and pedestrians had to prostrate before him as he passed.|$|E
25|$|Alexander Cameron Sim {{moved to}} Kobe in 1870, {{where he worked}} for the {{settlement}} druggist Llewellyn & Co. before establishing Sim & Co. on Lot 18. In addition to distributing Ramune and proposing the foundation of the KRAC, Sim was also known for leading the settlement's internal firefighting force, for which he held lookout from a fire lookout tower in Nishimachi Park near his home. He kept his firefighting clothes, helmet, and axe beside <b>his</b> <b>pillow</b> even when he slept and participated personally in almost every fire-fighting effort during his tenure. After the settlement was returned and the firefighting force incorporated into Kobe's, Sim was left a position as honorary advisor in the new structure and allowed to direct a team. Sim was also the vice chairman of the settlement's Municipal Council, and as the chairman was sick during the ceremony for the return of the settlement, Sim attended in his place and signed the associated documents.|$|E

6000|$|... "Old Pearse {{seemed to}} think this over, never moving on <b>his</b> <b>pillows.</b> 'You don't know Zack,' he said; 'I'm sorry for you, and I'm sorry for Rick Voisey's daughter; but you don't know Zack.' ...|$|R
500|$|Cassius Dio, writing {{nearly a}} hundred years after the assassination, {{suggests}} that the assassination was improvised, while Suetonius implies it was a well-organized conspiracy, [...] citing Stephanus feigned injury and claiming that {{the doors to the}} servants' quarters had been locked prior to the attack and that a sword Domitian kept concealed beneath <b>his</b> <b>pillow</b> as a last line of personal protection against a would-be assassin, had been also been removed beforehand.|$|E
500|$|After {{surviving}} the fire during {{his second year}} of college, Long got a tattoo of Saint Joseph on his right bicep.

500|$|Since his {{military}} service, Murphy had been plagued with insomnia and bouts of depression, and {{he slept with}} a loaded pistol under <b>his</b> <b>pillow.</b> A post-service medical examination on 17 June 1947 revealed symptoms of headaches, vomiting, and nightmares about the war. His medical records indicated that he took sleeping pills to help prevent nightmares. During the mid-1960s, he recognized his dependence on Placidyl, and locked himself alone {{in a hotel room}} for a week to successfully break the addiction. Post-traumatic stress levels exacerbated his innate moodiness, and surfaced in episodes that friends and professional colleagues found alarming. His first wife, Wanda Hendrix, stated that he once held her at gunpoint. She witnessed her husband being guilt-ridden and tearful over newsreel footage of German war orphans. Murphy briefly found a creative stress outlet in writing poetry after his Army discharge. His poem [...] "The Crosses Grow on Anzio" [...] appeared in his book To Hell and Back, but was attributed to the fictitious character Kerrigan.|$|E
6000|$|... "I know he's got {{something}} nice for us, I see a bundle in his pocket," [...] {{and a little}} fellow who sat up among <b>his</b> <b>pillows</b> gave a joyful cough as he could not shout.|$|R
6000|$|... "Well then; let me {{take the}} house, {{and you can go}} away when you're tired of me." [...] His voice sounded smothered, resentful; she could hear him turning and turning, as if angry with <b>his</b> <b>pillows.</b> And she murmured: ...|$|R
60|$|He {{sank back}} on <b>his</b> <b>pillows</b> {{and laughed and}} coughed, and laughed and coughed again, till I feared that wild, long, broken laugh would be his last. But it ceased at length, and for awhile, exhausted, he lay silent before continuing.|$|R
500|$|... {{immediately}} {{became evident}} {{to family and}} friends. He was on medication for stomach problems and tightly wound, with any unexpected sound triggering a defensive reflex reaction to an imagined attack. When he slept, {{it was with a}} loaded pistol under <b>his</b> <b>pillow.</b> Recurring nightmares had him reliving the war, repeatedly calling out to individual soldiers. Turning the lights on sometimes brought relief, if only to keep him from falling asleep again. He had waking graphic flashbacks that caused him to freeze, reliving a life-threatening moment on the battlefield. His first wife Wanda Hendrix stated that he once held her at gunpoint. She witnessed her husband being moved to tears by newsreel footage of German war orphans, guilt-ridden that his war actions might have been the cause of their having no parents. As others had noticed since his return from Europe, Hendrix said his dreams were punctuated with the battles he had fought. She tried to coax him into seeking psychiatric help. During a publicity tour in 1952, his dreams caused him to beat the wall of his motel room until his fists bled.|$|E
500|$|During {{his senior}} season, Pelinka was an {{important}} role player for the team who drew the most charges on the team and contributed important defensive minutes as the sixth man. During the 1992–93 season, he led all reserves in minutes and assists and was second in points and rebounds. [...] Pelinka was also instrumental as a leader during the run to the Final Four. [...] Having been {{the only member of}} the team in Seattle for the 1989 championship, when the 1993 team played its regional championship games in Seattle, Pelinka was able to show Webber the spot in the locker room where Rice had taken his pre-game nap. [...] During the Final Four weekend in New Orleans, Louisiana, Chris Webber wore Pelinka's 1989 Championship ring, which only fit on Webber's pinky finger, and slept with it under <b>his</b> <b>pillow.</b> [...] During the national semifinal 81–78 overtime victory against the Kentucky Wildcats, Pelinka played in the clinching overtime period after King fouled out. Nonetheless, despite a pair of early three-point shots by Pelinka after Jackson got two early personal fouls, the team lost in the final game of the 1993 NCAA Tournament against North Carolina. [...] When the team returned to Ann Arbor, Michigan for a rally at Crisler Arena the following day, Pelinka was one of only two Wolverines to speak to the crowd. [...] After his senior season, he played in an NBA Summer Camp in Long Beach, California and considered offers to play professionally in Europe. [...] At this time, he first met sports agent Arn Tellem and decided not to play basketball. [...] he remained in 15th place on the all-time Michigan games played list.|$|E

6000|$|... "'Let {{him come}} in!' I went in. The old fellow was in bed, quite still on <b>his</b> <b>pillows,</b> a candle by his side; {{to look at}} him you'd think nothing of him but his eyes were alive. It was queer being there with those two old men!" ...|$|R

2500|$|Knowing {{his death}} was near in his 86th year, Simeon asked {{to be placed on}} a mat in front of the icon of the Virgin Hodegetria with a stone for <b>his</b> <b>pillow.</b> He died in front of his son Sava and other monks, on 13 February 1200. He was buried in the grounds of Hilandar monastery. His last words {{requested}} that Sava take his remains to Serbia, [...] "when God permits it, after a certain period of time".

2500|$|According {{to prison}} officials, Fenton {{had made the}} [...] "ice picks" [...] from metal guide bars on his typewriter.

Fenton said he was motivated to attack out of anger at Devlin's crimes. Investigation of the assault is ongoing and Fenton may face charges related to the attack. Devlin's security has been a concern for state prison officials since his arrest. Officials contemplated sending him out of state or providing him with a new identity. However, some victims' family members objected to the move, and the plan was dropped.|$|E
2500|$|Buck {{also got}} into deep trouble with CBS {{executives}} (namely executive producer Ted Shaker) over questionable comments made towards singer Bobby Vinton in 1990. While on-air prior to Game 4 of the that year's NLCS in Pittsburgh, Buck criticized Vinton's off-key rendition of [...] "The Star-Spangled Banner", making a comment towards Vinton {{that sounded like}} a prejudicial remark centered on his Polish heritage. Joe Buck believed that the situation was ironic because his father was [...] "trying to help the guy." [...] Buck began receiving death threats from Pirate fans and discovered a footprint on <b>his</b> <b>pillow</b> once he returned to his hotel room.|$|E
