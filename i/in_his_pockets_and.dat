5|$|The Guardian {{obtained}} a four-minute video on 21 April from an anonymous bystander {{who had been}} filming on Cornhill between 7:10 and 7:30pm. The footage shows Tomlinson standing behind a bicycle rack in Royal Exchange Passage with his hands <b>in</b> <b>his</b> <b>pockets,</b> <b>and</b> a group of advancing police officers. When a police dog approaches him, he turns his back. At that point, he is hit on the legs and pushed by the TSG constable, and can be seen scraping along the ground {{on the right side}} of his forehead. Eyewitnesses said they heard a noise as his head hit the ground. The IPCC sought an injunction against the broadcast of the video by Channel4 News, but a judge rejected the application. An image obtained by Sky News on 24 April appears to show bruising {{on the right side of}} Tomlinson's forehead. A head injury was recorded by the second and third pathologists.|$|E
25|$|In 1894, he bowled 422 overs {{for his new}} county, conceding just 516 {{runs and}} {{capturing}} 41 wickets. The following year, at Trent Bridge (when {{it was so cold}} that KS Ranjitsinhji kept his hands <b>in</b> <b>his</b> <b>pockets</b> <b>and</b> fielded the ball with his feet), Shaw bowled 100.1 five-ball overs as his former team accrued a gargantuan 726. He finally retired again two matches later, when Sussex drew against Middlesex, and only ever returned to the first-class scene in 1897 to play the Gentlemen of Philadelphia. He subsequently became a publican and died aged 64.|$|E
25|$|Much {{controversy}} surrounded Selig and {{his involvement}} in Bonds' all-time home run record chase. For months, speculation surrounded Selig {{and the possibility that}} he and Henry Aaron would not attend Bonds' games as he closed in on the record. Selig announced in July 2007 when Bonds was near 755 home runs that he would attend the games. Selig was in attendance for Bonds' record-tying home run against the San Diego Padres, sitting in Padres owner John Moores' private suite. When Bonds hit his 755th home run, Selig refused to applaud Bonds' accomplishment, instead choosing to keep his hands <b>in</b> <b>his</b> <b>pockets</b> <b>and</b> have a look of disdain on his face. Bud Selig also did not attend the San Francisco Giants' game on August 7 when Barry Bonds hit his record-breaking 756th home run against the Washington Nationals; after the event, Selig released a statement congratulating Bonds.|$|E
60|$|Merton also rose; {{the fifty}} pounds were <b>in</b> <b>his</b> <b>pocket</b> (<b>and</b> <b>his</b> I O U <b>in</b> <b>his</b> friend's <b>pocket),</b> <b>and</b> {{there was nothing}} more to detain him.|$|R
60|$|Wilkinson put the cheque <b>in</b> <b>his</b> <b>pocket</b> <b>and</b> {{picked up}} <b>his</b> hat.|$|R
60|$|The Hof-rath put <b>his</b> hand <b>in</b> <b>his</b> <b>pocket</b> <b>and</b> {{pulled out}} some pennies.|$|R
2500|$|After the fair, Pawnee Bill’s Wild West Show {{brokered}} {{an agreement}} with the government to have Geronimo join the show, again under Army guard. The Indians in Pawnee Bill’s show were depicted as “lying, thieving, treacherous, murderous” monsters who had killed hundreds of men, women and children and would think nothing of taking a scalp from any member of the audience, given the chance. [...] Visitors came to see how the “savage” had been “tamed,” and they paid Geronimo to take a button from the coat of the vicious Apache “chief.” (Geronimo was not a chief.) The shows put a good deal of money <b>in</b> <b>his</b> <b>pockets</b> <b>and</b> allowed him to travel, though never without government guards.|$|E
60|$|He put {{his hands}} <b>in</b> <b>his</b> <b>pockets</b> <b>and</b> {{walked over to the}} window.|$|E

60|$|Uncle John felt <b>in</b> <b>his</b> <b>pocket,</b> <b>and</b> silently slid a {{sovereign}} into Mike's hand.|$|R
60|$|WELLWYN. Ah! [Abstractedly feeling <b>in</b> <b>his</b> <b>pockets,</b> <b>and</b> finding coins.] Thanks--thanks--heavy work, I'm afraid.|$|E
60|$|Mr. Flint rose, {{thrust his}} hands <b>in</b> <b>his</b> <b>pockets,</b> <b>and</b> paced the room twice.|$|E

60|$|He put <b>his</b> cold hand <b>in</b> <b>his</b> <b>pocket</b> <b>and</b> felt <b>his</b> paper, he put <b>his</b> {{other hand}} <b>in</b> <b>his</b> other <b>pocket</b> <b>and</b> felt another paper--Alexander's! Pigling squealed; then ran back frantically, hoping to {{overtake}} Alexander and the policeman.|$|R
60|$|Bill rummaged <b>in</b> <b>his</b> <b>pocket</b> <b>and</b> found {{a little}} tobacco in {{a twist of}} paper.|$|R

60|$|McCan groaned, {{but there}} was no caribou suet <b>in</b> <b>his</b> <b>pocket,</b> <b>and</b> he doggedly brought up the rear.|$|R
60|$|Gordon Wright, {{with his}} hands <b>in</b> <b>his</b> <b>pockets</b> <b>and</b> a meditative expression, took several turns about the room.|$|E
60|$|He sat, {{with his}} hands <b>in</b> <b>his</b> <b>pockets</b> <b>and</b> his legs {{stretched}} out before him, looking at the fire.|$|E
60|$|Kipps leant {{against the}} {{fixtures}} {{with his hands}} <b>in</b> <b>his</b> <b>pockets</b> <b>and</b> talked to the two apprentices under him.|$|E
60|$|The seaman fumbled <b>in</b> <b>his</b> <b>pocket,</b> <b>and</b> {{taking out}} a slip of wood handed it to his companion.|$|R
60|$|Fanny {{thought it}} all came from Tom Jones. He could go alone with a book <b>in</b> <b>his</b> <b>pocket</b> <b>and</b> watch the badgers. He would take a train at eight-thirty and walk all night. He saw fire-flies, and brought back glow-worms in pill-boxes. He would hunt with the New Forest Staghounds. It all came from Tom Jones; and {{he would go to}} Greece with a book <b>in</b> <b>his</b> <b>pocket</b> <b>and</b> forget her.|$|R
60|$|Knight {{folded it}} as {{carefully}} as its moist condition would allow, put it <b>in</b> <b>his</b> <b>pocket,</b> <b>and</b> followed Elfride.|$|R

60|$|Holmes strolled {{round the}} house with his hands <b>in</b> <b>his</b> <b>pockets</b> <b>and</b> a negligent air which was unusual with him.|$|E
60|$|They {{had come}} to the corner of Forty-first Street. Uncle Chris felt <b>in</b> <b>his</b> <b>pocket</b> <b>and</b> {{produced}} a key.|$|R
60|$|This {{document}} he put <b>in</b> <b>his</b> <b>pocket,</b> <b>and</b> so preserved {{proof of}} what he was perjuring himself to deny.|$|R
