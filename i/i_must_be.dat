500|$|The {{enforcement}} of the Tea Act of 1773 became a heated issue with the colonists, with the well-known demonstration at the Boston harbor, the Boston Tea Party, a direct reaction to the act. However, a much more important shift occurred in the colonists' drink of choice. In 1773, John Adams {{wrote a letter to}} his wife stating, [...] "Tea must be universally renounced and <b>I</b> <b>must</b> <b>be</b> weaned, and the sooner the better." [...] Thus began the American shift from tea to coffee. In a concentrated boycott, the housewives of Falmouth, Massachusetts publicly united, vowing to serve only coffee in their homes. This inspired other households throughout the colonies, both in the north and south, to do the same.|$|E
500|$|While Adams brought {{energy and}} {{dedication}} to the presiding officer's chair, he found the task [...] "not quite adapted to my character."

To his wife Abigail he wrote, [...] "My country has in its wisdom contrived for me the most insignificant office that ever the invention of man [...] [...] [...] or his imagination contrived or his imagination conceived; and as I can do neither good nor evil, <b>I</b> <b>must</b> <b>be</b> borne away by others and met the common fate." ...|$|E
500|$|He {{once said}} that [...] "in choreography, {{ordinary}} movements from real life are taken and extended, so they become dance movements, yet the relation to reality must always be there.

When peace was announced following the 1763 Treaty of Paris, Gage began lobbying for another posting, as he was [...] "very much [...] of this cursed Climate, and <b>I</b> <b>must</b> <b>be</b> bribed very high to stay here any longer". [...] In October 1763 the good news arrived that he would act as commander-in-chief of North America while Amherst was on leave in Britain. He immediately left Montreal, and took over Amherst's command in New York on 17 November 1763. [...] When he did so, he inherited the job of dealing with the Indian uprising known as Pontiac's Rebellion.|$|E

500|$|Beyond {{his role}} in the Senate, Adams played a minor role in the {{politics}} of the early 1790s. During his two vice-presidential terms, Adams attended few cabinet meetings, and the president sought his counsel only infrequently. Nonetheless, the two men, according to Ferling, [...] "jointly executed many more of the executive branch's ceremonial undertakings than would be likely for a contemporary president and vice-president." [...] Overall, while Adams brought energy and dedication to the office, he found the task [...] "not quite adapted to my character...too inactive, and mechanical." [...] He often lamented what he viewed as the [...] "complete insignificance" [...] of his situation.

500|$|In April 2004, Michael Grade {{returned}} to the BBC, {{this time as the}} Chairman of the Board of Governors, although this position does not involve any commissioning or editorial responsibilities. Although he had previously disliked the show and imposed an eighteen-month hiatus on it during the Sixth Doctor era, he eventually wrote an e-mail to the Director-General of the BBC Mark Thompson in June 2005, after the successful new first series, voicing approval for its popularity. He also declared, [...] " [...] never dreamed I would ever write this. <b>I</b> <b>must</b> <b>be</b> going soft!" [...] The revival also impressed former Doctor Sylvester McCoy, who praised Eccleston and Piper as well as their characters, and the pacing of the first episode. His only criticism was about the new TARDIS interior, though he did comment that he was [...] "also a bit dismayed that more wasn't made of the show's incidental music, which seemed fairly anonymous in the background".|$|E

D'Amato, a backer of Sotomayor to begin with and additionally concerned about being up for re-election that year, helped move Republican leadership. Her nomination had been pending for over a year when Majority Leader Trent Lott scheduled the vote. With complete Democratic support, and support from 25 Republican senators including Judiciary chair Orrin Hatch, Sotomayor was confirmed on October 2, 1998, by a 67–29 vote. She received her commission on October 7. [...] The confirmation experience left Sotomayor somewhat angry; she said shortly afterwards that during the hearings, Republicans had assumed her political beliefs based on her being a Latina: [...] "That series of questions, I think, were symbolic of a set of expectations that some people had [...] <b>I</b> <b>must</b> <b>be</b> liberal.

500|$|After {{the release}} of , a remake of [...] for the Nintendo 3DS, {{director}} Eiji Aonuma suggested that a Majora's Mask remake was [...] "not an impossibility", depending on interest and demand. Following this news, a fan campaign called [...] "Operation Moonfall" [...] was launched to promote the remake of Majora's Mask on the 3DS. The campaign name is {{a reference to a}} similar fan-based movement, Operation Rainfall, set up to persuade Nintendo of America to release a trio of role-playing video games for the Wii. The petition reached 10,000 signatures within five days. In response to the feedback, Nintendo of America released a statement: [...] "At the risk of dampening the excitement you feel, <b>I</b> <b>must</b> <b>be</b> clear that no official announcements have been made regarding a remake of The Legend of Zelda: Majora's Mask for the Nintendo 3DS. However, we like hearing what our consumers find important." [...] In an interview with GamesRadar in November 2011, Zelda producer Eiji Aonuma acknowledged Operation Moonfall and told fans that he hopes to respond to their request sometime in the future. At E3 2012, Miyamoto stated that a 3D remake was still under consideration. Once again, shortly after E3 2013, Miyamoto commented that the fans supporting a Majora's Mask 3D remake were [...] "still in his memory".|$|E
500|$|The {{album was}} {{received}} favourably {{by the majority}} of music critics, although opinions have become more negative in subsequent decades and it has rarely been featured in [...] "Best Albums of the 1980s" [...] lists since. It won three Grammy Awards including for Album of the Year in 1986. Stephen Holden of The New York Times wrote that Collins was [...] "quietly revolutionising and expanding the role of the drums in pop record making". Rolling Stone reviewer David Fricke wrote that, [...] "Like his '81 and '82 outings, Face Value and Hello, <b>I</b> <b>Must</b> <b>Be</b> Going!, No Jacket Required is not an album that waits to be liked". Collins' most commercially successful solo album, it reached number one in several countries, including the US (where it {{was at the top of}} the charts for seven weeks), the UK and Canada. According to the RIAA, the record sold over twelve million copies in the US, and in the UK, the album sold over two million copies, and was certified 6× platinum. It was the second-best-selling album of 1985 in the UK, beaten to first place by Dire Straits' Brothers in Arms. Worldwide, the album has sold over 25 million copies, making it one of the best-selling albums of all time.|$|E
500|$|The {{details of}} Angelou's life {{described}} in her seven autobiographies and in numerous interviews, speeches, and articles {{tended to be}} inconsistent. [...] Critic Mary Jane Lupton has explained that when Angelou spoke about her life, she did so eloquently but informally and [...] "with no time chart in front of her". [...] For example, she was married at least twice, but never clarified {{the number of times}} she had been married, [...] "for fear of sounding frivolous"; according to her autobiographies and to Gillespie, she married Tosh Angelos in 1951 and Paul du Feu in 1974, and began her relationship with Vusumzi Make in 1961, but never formally married him. [...] Angelou held many jobs, including some in the sex trade, working as a prostitute and madame for lesbians, as she described in her second autobiography, Gather Together in My Name. [...] In a 1995 interview, Angelou said, [...] "I wrote about my experiences because I thought too many people tell young folks, 'I never did anything wrong. Who, Moi? – never I. I have no skeletons in my closet. In fact, I have no closet.' They lie like that and then young people find themselves in situations and they think, 'Damn <b>I</b> <b>must</b> <b>be</b> a pretty bad guy. My mom or dad never did anything wrong.'

500|$|Lucas based the CGI on the {{character}} as he originally appeared in Return of the Jedi. In this film, Jabba the Hutt is an immense, sedentary, slug-like creature designed by Lucas's Industrial Light & Magic Creature Shop. Design consultant Ralph McQuarrie claimed, [...] "In my sketches Jabba was huge, agile, sort of an apelike figure. But then the design went into another direction, and Jabba became more like a worm kind of creature." [...] According to the 1985 documentary From Star Wars to Jedi, Lucas rejected initial designs of {{the character}}. One made Jabba appear too human—almost like a Fu Manchu character—while a second made him look too snail-like. Lucas finally settled on a design that was a hybrid of the two, drawing for further inspiration on an O'Galop cartoon figure flanking an early depiction of Bibendum (also known as the [...] "Michelin Man"). Return of the Jedi costume designer Nilo Rodis-Jamero commented, My vision of Jabba was literally Orson Welles when he was older. I saw him as a very refined man. Most of the villains we like are very smart people. But Phil Tippett kept imagining him {{as some kind of}} slug, almost like in Alice in Wonderland. At one time he sculpted a creature that looked like a slug that's smoking. I kept thinking <b>I</b> <b>must</b> <b>be</b> really off, but eventually that's where it led up to." ...|$|E
500|$|The sudden {{surge in}} {{popularity}} was disorienting to Iyall. [...] "It was frightening: {{we played a}} college in Santa Barbara, and {{there were all these}} blond people crowding the stage, and I thought 'These are the people who hated me in high school!' When you grow up being 'outside' – because I wasn't white, and I was fat, and always a bit of a free thinker – it was strange. It was like, 'uh-oh, <b>I</b> <b>must</b> <b>be</b> doing something wrong – they like me!'" [...] Highly successful mainstream artists like Ann Wilson and Ric Ocasek were eager to meet the band. Ocasek extended an invitation to collaborate at his Synchro Sound studio in Boston. The recording sessions in Boston resulted in the Never Say Never EP in January 1982. The title track became (arguably) their best-known song and has remained synonymous with the band ever since. The song was also featured in the 1984 romantic teen drama Reckless. Additionally, the success of the single directly led to 415 Records signing a deal with Columbia Records, which elevated the indie label's roster to major-label status. Romeo Void released their second album, entitled Benefactor, in November 1982. The album appeared at No.119 on the Billboard 200. Benefactor was noticeably more commercial sounding than previous endeavors; the music was made more danceable and swearing was removed on the song [...] "Never Say Never". The different approach in the sound resulted in comparisons to Blondie, which Allmusic writer William Ruhlmann suggested was a deliberate attempt by Columbia. Iyall stated that there was more pressure to write sexually laced lyrics for Benefactor: [...] "I do like to be provocative, and I definitely have access to my sexuality, and as a topic I find it ripe, but I wasn't ever going to be a sex-pot diva, so that was kind of odd." [...] She also said there was pressure to produce more singles.|$|E
