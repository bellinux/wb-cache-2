25|$|This part of {{the artery}} is crossed obliquely, from its medial to its lateral side, by the sternocleidomastoid branch of the {{superior}} thyroid artery; it is also crossed by the superior and middle thyroid veins (which end in the internal jugular vein); descending in front of its sheath is the <b>descending</b> <b>branch</b> of the hypoglossal nerve, this filament being joined by one or two branches from the cervical nerves, which cross the vessel obliquely.|$|E
25|$|In 2005, Allain {{established}} some distinctive traits. Dubreuillosaurus has {{an unusually}} low and long skull, with a length {{three times the}} height. In the upper corner of {{the front edge of}} the nasal branch of the maxilla, a kink is present, separating a convex curvature below from a concave curvature above. The <b>descending</b> <b>branch</b> of the postorbital has a U-shaped cross-section. The parietal bones are not visible in side view. The supratemporal fenestra has a straight inner edge. A paraquadratic fenestra is lacking. A well-developed process is present {{on the underside of the}} jugal branch of the ectopterygoid. The rear edge of the jugal branch of the ectopterygoid, in front of the infratemporal fenestra, is deeply grooved. The lower jaw has a large external mandibular fenestra. The foramen mylohyoideum is largely oriented to the front and below. The head of the thighbone is directed to the inside and below. The front underside of the thighbone has a concave surface. In 2012 Matthew Carrano added one autapomorphy: on the rear of the braincase there is a notch between the basioccipital and the bone surface formed by the exoccipitals and the opisthotic.|$|E

50|$|Many of the {{features}} of Highs may be understood in context of middle- or meso-scale and relatively enduring dynamics of a planet's atmospheric circulation.

The patronym Radvila arose following its use by his son Radvila Astikas and grandson Mikalojus Radvila. A legendary version of the patronym's etymology associates it with a child raised by wolves (rado vilko). The name has been primarily written in, and recognized by, the polonized version and spelling for several centuries.|$|R
40|$|Primary {{projections}} of the anterior (ALLN) and posterior (PLLN) lateral line nerves were traced in the shovelnose sturgeon by means of horseradish peroxidase (HRP) histochemistry and silver degeneration. The trunk of the ALLN divides into dorsal and ventral roots as it enters the medulla. Fibers of the dorsal root form ascending and <b>descending</b> <b>branches</b> that terminate within the ipsilateral dorsal octavolateralis nucleus and the dorsal granular component of the lateral eminentia granularis. Fibers of the ventral root of the ALLN, as well as fibers of the PLLN, enter the medulla ventral to the dorsal root of the ALLN {{where some of the}} fibers terminate among the dendrites of the magnocellular octaval nucleus. The bulk of the fibers form ascending and <b>descending</b> <b>branches</b> that terminate within the ipsilateral medial octavolateralis nucleus. A portion of the ascending fibers continue more rostrally land terminate in the ipsilateral eminentia granularis and bilaterally in the cerebellar corpus. Some fibers of the descending rami of both the ALLN and PLLN extend beyond the caudal limit of the medial octavolateralis nucleus to terminate in the caudal octavolateralis nucleus. The HRP cases also revealed retrogradely filled large neurons whose axons course peripherally in the lateral line nerve and are likely efferent to the lateral line organs...|$|R

40|$|Based on reanalysis {{data for}} the years 1980 – 2001 from the European Centre for Medium-Range Weather Forecasts (ERA- 40 data), a {{climatology}} of tropospheric zonal-mean water vapor fields and fluxes in isen-tropic coordinates is presented. In the extratropical free troposphere, eddy fluxes dominate the meridional flux of specific humidity along isentropes. At all levels, isentropic eddy fluxes transport water vapor from the deep Tropics through the subtropics into the extratropics. Isentropic eddy fluxes of specific humidity diverge near the surface and in the tropical and subtropical free troposphere; they converge in the extra-tropical free troposphere. Isentropic mean advective fluxes of specific humidity play a secondary role in the meridional water vapor transport in the free troposphere; however, they dominate the meridional flux of specific humidity near the surface, where they transport water vapor equatorward and, in the solstice seasons, across the equator. Cross-isentropic mean advective fluxes of specific humidity are especially important in the Hadley circulation, in whose ascending branches they moisten and in whose <b>descending</b> <b>branches</b> they dry the free troposphere. Near the minima of zonal-mean relative humidity in the subtropical free troposphere, the divergence of the cross-isentropic mean advective flux of specific humidity in the <b>descending</b> <b>branches</b> of the Hadle...|$|R
40|$|A {{study of}} {{emerging}} turbulent scales entropy production is conducted for a supercritical shear layer as {{a precursor to}} the eventual modeling of Subgrid Scales (from a turbulent state) leading to Large Eddy Simulations. The entropy equation is first developed for. a real, nonideal fluid using a validated all-pressure fluid model, and the entropy flux and production terms are identified. Employing a Direct Numerical Simulation (DNS) created database of a temporal 3 D supercritical shear layer using the fluid model, the different contributions to the irreversible entropy production term are evaluated. Both domain averaged and root-mean-square (RMS) terms are computed at three different stages of the DNS, representing the timewise ascending, culmination and <b>descending</b> <b>branches</b> of the spatially averaged positive spanwise vorticity. The unfiltered and filtered databases are compared to evaluate {{the relative importance of}} irreversible entropy production from viscous, Fourier heat diffusion and molar fluxes terms. The results show that the average entropy production is dominated by the viscous terms at all stages of the evolution; however, the contribution to the RMS of the molar flux term for both the ascending and <b>descending</b> <b>branches</b> is non-negligible. This latter result is traced to the molar gradients tending to be smeared by emerging turbulent scales...|$|R
