25|$|The Gothic Temple {{designed}} by James Gibbs in 1741 and completed about 1748, {{this is the}} only building in the Gardens built from ironstone, all the others use a creamy-yellow limestone. The building is triangular in plan of two storeys with a pentagonal shaped tower at each corner, one of which rises two floors higher than the main building, while the other two towers have lanterns on their roofs. Above the door is a quote from Pierre Corneille's play Horace: Je rends grace aux Dieux de n'estre pas Roman (<b>I</b> <b>thank</b> <b>the</b> gods I am not a Roman). The interior includes a circular room of two storeys covered by a shallow dome that is painted to mimic mosaic work including shields representing the Heptarchy. Dedicated 'To the Liberty of our Ancestors'. To quote John Martin Robinson: 'to the Whigs, Saxon and Gothic were interchangeably associated with freedom and ancient English liberties: trial by jury (erroneously thought to have been founded by King Alfred at a moot on Salisbury Plain), Magna Carta, parliamentary representation, all the things which the Civil War and Glorious Revolution had protected from the wiles of Stuart would-be absolutism, and to the preservation of which Lord Cobham and his 'Patriots' were seriously devoted.' The Temple was used in the 1930s by the school as the Officer Training Corps armoury. It is now available as a holiday let through the Landmark Trust.|$|E
500|$|The {{title track}} of the album, [...] "International Velvet", {{featuring}} the line [...] "Every day when I wake up <b>I</b> <b>thank</b> <b>the</b> Lord I'm Welsh" [...] and Welsh language verses, received additional attention from the media. Matthews explained {{in an interview that}} she wanted to turn to invert the idea of being Welsh from an apparent negative into a positive, [...] "We're not seen to be very good at anything. Our football team is shit. The song is saying, despite all these things, I still {{wake up in the morning}} and thank the Lord that I'm Welsh. Hopefully by now people realise that Wales is brimmed full of talent and we're great people with massive brains." [...] In front of 70,000 spectators, Catatonia performed [...] "International Velvet" [...] at the opening ceremony of the 1999 Rugby World Cup in the Millennium Stadium in Cardiff. The album became the first to be released for Catatonia in the United States, but failed to chart. The Washington Post called it [...] "overlooked".|$|E

500|$|On 10 September 2013, {{the four}} adult {{defendants}} {{were found guilty}} of rape, murder, unnatural offences and destruction of evidence. All four men faced the death penalty, and demonstrators outside the courthouse called for the hanging of the defendants. The victim's father also called for the defendants to be hanged, stating, [...] "We will get complete closure only if all the accused are wiped off {{from the face of}} the earth." [...] Lawyers for three of the four stated that their clients intended to appeal the verdict. The four men were sentenced on 13 September to death by hanging. Judge Yogesh Khanna rejected pleas for a lesser sentence saying the case has [...] "shocked the collective conscience of India" [...] and that [...] "courts cannot turn a blind eye to such crimes." [...] The victim's family was present for the sentencing and her mother expressed satisfaction over the verdict saying, [...] "We were waiting with bated breath, now we are relieved. <b>I</b> <b>thank</b> <b>the</b> people of my country and the media." [...] After the verdict was delivered, the people waiting outside the courtroom applauded.|$|E
500|$|During one scene, Rosa Lee tells Mac, [...] "I say {{my prayers}} {{for you and}} when <b>I</b> <b>thank</b> <b>the</b> Lord for his tender mercies, you're {{at the head of}} the list." [...] Scholar Robert Jewett compares this line to the first verse of Romans 12, in which Paul the Apostle appeals to Christians to live out their lives in service to others [...] "through the mercies of God". Many of the {{elements}} of Mac's redemption, conversion to Christianity and budding relationship with Rosa Lee occur off-camera, including their wedding. Jewett writes, [...] "This is perfectly congruent with the theme of faith in the hidden mercies of God, the secret plot of the life of faith in Romans.... It is a matter of faith, elusive and intangible." [...] Jewett compares Mac's story to that of Abraham, because [...] "just like Sledge's story, [...] centers on the provision of a future through the tender mercies of God". As told in Romans 4, Abraham and his wife Sarah are too old to produce a son, but Abraham develops the faith that God will provide them an heir, which is exactly what occurs, though—as Paul describes—Abraham did nothing practical to guarantee or deserve such a miracle. Jewett describes Mac as similarly undeserving of redemption, based on his selfish and abusive past, typified by his condition in his first encounter with Rosa Lee: in a drunken stupor following a motel room fight. She takes him in and eventually falls in love with him, despite his having done nothing to deserve her care or his redemption: [...] "It is an undeserved grace, a gift of providence from a simple woman who continues to pray for him and to be grateful for him." ...|$|E

By March 1936, the Thanet Aero Club had been formed at Ramsgate, operating a de Havilland Hornet Moth. Mignet HM.14 [...] "Flying Flea" [...] aircraft had been grounded following a crash at Penshurst in May 1936, The ban had been lifted following wind tunnel tests {{which resulted in}} modifications to the wings.

2500|$|Zaid welcomed Abdullah's {{announcement}} {{in spite of}} the lack of a formal apology, saying: [...] "(One) can say sorry in other ways." [...] George Seah's son told the press that although all his father wanted was an apology, the family would not reject any goodwill payments. Tan Sri Wan Suleiman Pawanteh's wife said: [...] "Although <b>I</b> <b>thank</b> <b>the</b> prime minister, I feel less than satisfied at his decision (not to make a straightforward apology). This {{is not the end of}} the story for me. (Without an apology) I don't know, people don't know, that my husband was not guilty. I want my husband's name to be cleared. I feel my husband was innocent. He was an honest judge...Even so, I am thankful that our prime minister cares about us enough (to do this much)." [...] Tan Sri Eusoffe Abdoolcader's granddaughter regretted that acknowledgement had been so late in coming: [...] "I wish he was here. He's the main person affected by all this. It's a different case from the others (Salleh and Wan Suleiman) because he was reinstated. It's been 12 years. It should have been solved earlier." [...] Tun Salleh Abas however welcomed Abdullah's statement, saying: [...] "I feel great. It was something I didn't expect. I suffered so much humiliation ... so much so I ran away from the public and took solace in being a farmer." ...|$|E
