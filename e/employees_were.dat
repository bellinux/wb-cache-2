5|$|After the tender, 80 <b>employees</b> <b>were</b> {{transferred}} to the subsidiary, including the director, chartered engineer Arne Fosen.

Following the PSO, NSB Anbud would operate nine Class 69g trains, which are somewhat smaller than the locomotive-hauled and Class 70 trains. These would be owned by NSB, but rented by the subsidiary. The ministry would pay for a NOK 40 million overhaul of the stock.
