Its 256 parallel processing units achieve a peak 102 GOPS running at 204 MHz. To minimize energy consumption while maintaining throughput, this works {{is the first}} to both exploit the sparsity of convolutions and to implement dynamic precision-scalability enabling supply- and energy scaling. The processor is fully C-programmable, consumes 25 - 288 mW at 204 MHz and scales efficiency from 0. 3 - 2. 6 real TOPS/W.

40|$|An {{autonomous}} surface vehicle instrumented with {{optical and}} acoustical sensors was deployed in Kane'ohe Bay, <b>HI,</b> <b>U.</b> S. A., to provide high-resolution, in situ observations of coral reef reflectance with minimal human presence. The data represented {{a wide range}} in bottom type, water depth, and illumination and supported more thorough investigations of remote sensing methods for identifying and mapping shallow reef features. The in situ data were used to compute spectral bottom reflectance and remote sensing reflectance, Rrs,λ, {{as a function of}} water depth and benthic features. The signals were used to distinguish between live coral and uncolonized sediment within the depth range of the measurements (2. 5 – 5 m). In situRrs, λ were found to compare well with remotely sensed measurements from an imaging spectrometer, the Airborne Visible and Infrared Imaging Spectrometer (AVIRIS), deployed on an aircraft at high altitude. Cloud cover and in situ sensor orientation were found to have minimal impact on in situRrs, λ, suggesting that valid reflectance data may be collected using autonomous surveys even when atmospheric conditions are not favorable for remote sensing operations. The use of reflectance in the red and near infrared portions of the spectrum, expressed as the red edge height, REHλ, was investigated for detecting live aquatic vegetative biomass, including coral symbionts and turf algae. The REHλ signal from live coral was detected in Kane'ohe Bay to a depth of approximately 4 m with in situ measurements. A remote sensing algorithm based on the REHλ signal was defined and applied to AVIRIS imagery of the entire bay and was found to reveal areas of shallow, dense coral and algal cover. The peak wavelength of REHλ decreased with increasing water depth, indicating that a more complete examination of the red edge signal may potentially yield a remote sensing approach to simultaneously estimate vegetative biomass and bathymetry in shallow water...|$|E

A detailed LCA inventory of environmental burdens has been compiled from data from AWE Aldermaston and used as a case study to develop and demonstrate the methodologies developed in this work. As part of the research, the links between environmental aspects and impacts has been investigated using LCA, based on the high hazard facilities at AWE Aldermaston, which is a major industrial site. The case study also includes the contribution from vehicle use in the impact assessment. The results of this work have clearly identified which facilities and hence which processes are causing the most damaging environmental impact. New risk assessment methods are developed to quantify environmental accidents, that include revised consequence definitions that can be applied without the need for modelling and thus offer an economical alternative to existing methods. A new six-step screening methodology is presented to identify potential major accidents to the environment (MATTE) and to comply with the COMAH Regulations 1999.

5000|$|The Toyboize, a boy band, {{were formed}} in February 1988 by Scottish pop svengali Rab Morrison {{who came up}} with the idea whilst {{relaxing}} on holiday in Sri Lanka. Hot on the heels of his brief success with short-lived Glaswegian trio 'Boys Next Door', Rab had an inkling that the world was ready for a talented child pop act. After appearing as a judge on TV's 'New Faces' he recruited 12-year-old singer/songwriter duo Reece Phillips and Tim Hughes. Martin Power was spotted breakdancing on breakfast TV whilst JP Lambert and Nicky Naylor were found through a rigorous nationwide talent search. The resulting line up was christened the Toyboize. After a period of writing and rehearsal the Toyboize released their first single 'Sherbert Dip' in June which struggled to make an impact but hinted at the promise of what was to come. In late October their second single <b>'I</b> Like <b>U</b> Girl' reached number 2 in the charts and it is this catchy pop classic that most people remember them for. Their album 'We Like U Girl' was a big smash, reaching number 3 in the charts at its peak. Never one to miss an opportunity to satisfy an adoring public, Rab rushed a seasonal Christmas album into production ('A Very Toyboize Christmas') and this LP saw them register a second chart album hit in as many months. Unfortunately for the [...] "boize" [...] they were unable to replicate such levels of success in 1989 as they struggled to compete with Bros and New Kids On The Block. Most of the group knew they had outgrown their roles as child stars and felt it would be best to call it a day. The group were pleased, however, that Reece had decided to stick at the music and have watched on with delight as he has carved himself a career as an international pop star. Almost 20 years on, with the public clamouring for an encore, the other four Toyboize have decided to step back into the spotlight. Unfortunately, Reece decided not to reunite with the other members for the 20th anniversary celebratory tour and events which was a minor blow to the remaining Boize.|$|R
40|$|The {{debate over}} {{universal}} health insurance (<b>HI)</b> in the <b>U.</b> S., {{as well as}} the proper role of the government in the HI market, has been quite heated. Fueling this debate is the uncertainty pertaining to the benefits of HI in general, and the relative benefits of private versus public HI in particular. This uncertainty stems from non-random selection into different types of HI (private, public, or none) in combination with the absence of experimental data. Moreover, the lack of typical exclusion restrictions complicates identification of the causal effects of different HI types. Here, the aim is to assess the causal impact of private HI, relative to public HI, on the insured infant's health. To that end, this study employs the methodology proposed in Altonji et al. (2005) which trades off what can be learned in exchange for not requiring an exclusion restriction. Nonetheless, the method remains quite informative in the present context. Specifically, using data from the Early Childhood Longitudinal Survey, Birth Cohort (ECLS-B), along with several measures of infant health, the results suggest that while private HI is associated with improved infant health, this association disappears once selection on observables and unobservables is considered. In fact, the estimated effects of private HI are predominantly negative once both types of selection are admitted. Further analysis reveals that the likely beneficial effects of public HI are due to greater coverage for infants at a much lower cost. Health Insurance, Children, Treatment Effects...|$|R
40|$|The {{critical}} {{shortage of}} donors {{compared to the}} demand for organs and tissues remains a major medical problem moving into the 21 st century. Trends in demographics and socioeconomic status between donors and non-donors may be key for understanding how to better target nondonor populations. To {{gain an understanding of}} the knowledge level, attitudes and opinions of college students towards organ donation and to compare this with the demographics of potential organ donor residents in the state of Hawaii (HI), we used an anonymous 15 -item survey. This survey was administered to participants at the University of Hawaii-Manoa after they had spoken with an Organ Donor Center of Hawaii educator. These educators were present in an educational booth at Campus Center during a campus-wide health promotion event. The Department of Motor Vehicle (DMV) database of Organ Donors in <b>HI</b> and the <b>U.</b> S. Census Bureau database were used for comparison of college demographics to those of potential Organ Donors in HI and the general demographics of HI respectively. The average age of potential organ donors in HI is 47. 5 yr and the average age of donors from our survey was 27. 2 yr indicating that; in general, college-aged students are not the prime donor demographic in HI. While Caucasians are a minority in HI, they constitute 27 % of the state’s population and 27 % of donors in our college survey, indicating that Caucasians donate organs at rates commensurate to their population levels. Asian students made up 18 % of donors in our survey and constitute 38 % of the state’s population, indicating Asians donate organs at rates much below their population-representative levels in HI. A majority of the college participants reported feeling knowledgeable about organ donation, but survey responses regarding understanding of organ donation varied in their accuracy. Interestingly, most respondents that had organ donor cards also had indicated donor status on their licenses. This implies that donor registry cards may be a duplication of effort with DMV license determination. Almost half of our respondents had not discussed their decision to donate with family (45 %). We conclude that recruitment on college campuses can only be effective with adequate advanced planning and promotion. Additionally, based on student responses and participation compared to the potential student respondents passing the site, the standard booth-based education and promotion is almost certainly not the optimal method for recruiting college students in HI. Finally, college aged-students in general are not discussing their wishes to donate organs with their family, which almost certainly contributes to the low level of participation in this age group. More effort when educating college-aged students should be focused on stimulating discussions with families to ensure they are aware of donation preference and on using college-age appropriate educational strategies...|$|R
