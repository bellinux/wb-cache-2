40|$|Pipelines {{offer the}} most {{efficient}} way to transport bulk quantities of gas and petrol from points of production to storage locations or from storage locations to distributed points of end use. Environment such as <b>hydrogen,</b> <b>load</b> frequency and temperature affects fatigue crack growth (FCG) behavior, which look like other forms of corrosion-fatigue. Discussion of the mechanism(s) for FCG in pipeline steels is complicated by the fact that neither the mechanism for FCG, nor the mechanism for hydrogen embrittlement (HE) under monotonic loading in these materials, is completely understood. There are only a few observations that provide indirect evidence concerning the mechanism for heat affected (HA) fatigue crack growth. In presence of high H 2 S the risk of brittle failure can be increased due to the effect of hydrogen on steel toughness. In this paper the impudence of environments such as, <b>hydrogen,</b> <b>load</b> frequency and low temperature on mechanical properties of two micro-alloyed pipeline materials, API 5 L X 70 and X 80, was studied. The results conducted based on experiments. the mechanisms used to predict FCG rate in hydrogen may differ significantly from those used for statically loaded applications or in fatigue situations.

40|$|The {{different}} {{topics of}} this thesis include temperature sensors {{based on the}} hydrogen-loaded fiber Bragg gratings, and the thermal stability of <b>hydrogen</b> <b>loaded</b> fiber Bragg gratings in the high temperature range. The aim of this thesis is to investigate {{a new type of}} high temperature fiber Bragg grating. We have fabricated the <b>hydrogen</b> <b>loaded</b> fiber Bragg gratings for high temperature sensor applications. These gratings differ from other types of fiber Bragg gratings, because their refractive index structure is attributed to the change in the hydroxyl groups and germanium oxygen-deficient centers. An annealed <b>hydrogen</b> <b>loaded</b> fiber Bragg grating has shown to survive at temperatures in excess of 936 { 493 }C. The gratings of the sensors retained their reflectivity up to 70 %, when they were kept at 700 { 493 }C for 90 minutes. The annealed fiber Bragg grating can be stabilized at temperatures in excess 700 { 493 }C for sensor applications. The main results of this thesis provide {{a better understanding of the}} thermal response of the hydrogen-loaded fiber Bragg gratings and their decay behavior at elevated temperatures. It is demonstrated that temperature annealing treatment of these fiber Bragg gratings is able to enhance effectively the grating's thermal stability. Finally, photosensitivity of pure silica and germanium-doped optical fibers at the presence of hydroxyl groups was also studied...|$|R

It was found that annealing of virgin bulk Nb (99. 9 %) at 1000 °C for 1 h leads to a complete recovery of defects. Subsequently, the defect-free samples were step-by-step electrochemically loaded with hydrogen up to xH = 0. 06 [H/Nb atom ratio], i. e. in the -phase region, where the Nb-H system represents a single-phase solid solution. The evolution of the microstructure with increasing hydrogen concentration was studied by X-ray diffraction and two complementary techniques of positron annihilation spectroscopy (PAS), namely positron lifetime spectroscopy and slow positron implantation spectroscopy with measurement of Doppler broadening. It was found that new defects were created due to <b>hydrogen</b> <b>loading.</b> The concentration of these hydrogen-induced defects increases with increasing hydrogen concentration.

Ab initio total energy calculations for <b>Hydrogen</b> <b>loaded</b> metallic multi-layers were performed in order to shed some light onto problem of H depleted layers at the interfaces that have been experimentally observed. It was explained in connection with structural relaxation of the interface layers. Further on conductivity behavior of Fe/V vs. Mo/V during <b>Hydrogen</b> <b>load</b> was discussed. The difference in, on first sight, rather similar multi-layer structures was explained by the magnitude of Hydrogen induced Vanadium expansion. Problem of variation of conductivity with changed c/a ratio of metals and semiconductors in general was addressed as well.

40|$|We {{prepared}} epitaxial YH 2 {{films on}} (111) CaF 2 by pulsed laser deposition (PLD) from a metallic yttrium target. Without adding any reactive hydrogen, the dihydride is formed in situ {{due to the}} hydrogen evolving from the metallic target which contains similar to 7 at% H. Upon pulsed laser irradiation, the target acts as a pulsed source of both yttrium and hydrogen. The increased hydrogen content of the film {{as compared to the}} target is explained to be due to diffusion assisted preferential ablation of hydrogen.

The modified code is used to model 45 shots made with the NASA Ames 0. 5 inch light gas gun over an extremely wide variety of gun operating conditions. Good agreement is found between the experimental and theoretical piston velocities (maximum errors of +/- 2 % to +/- 6 %) and maximum powder pressures (maximum errors of +/- 10 % with good igniters). Overall, the agreement between the experimental and numerically calculated gun erosion values (within a factor of 2) was judged to be reasonably good, considering the complexity of the processes modelled. Experimental muzzle velocities agree very well (maximum errors of 0. 5 - 0. 7 km/sec) with theoretical muzzle velocities calculated with loading of the hydrogen gas with the ablated barrel wall material. Comparison of results for pump tube volumes of 100 %, 60 % and 40 % of an initial benchmark value show that, at the higher muzzle velocities, operation at 40 % pump tube volume produces much lower <b>hydrogen</b> <b>loading</b> and gun erosion and substantially lower maximum pressures in the gun.
