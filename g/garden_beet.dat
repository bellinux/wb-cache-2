40|$|Genetic {{diversity}} in worldwide population of beets is strongly {{affected by the}} domestication history, and the comparison of linkage disequilibrium in worldwide and elite populations highlights strong selection pressure. Genetic relationships and linkage disequilibrium (LD) were evaluated {{in a set of}} 2035 worldwide beet accessions and in another of 1338 elite sugar beet lines, using 320 and 769 single nucleotide polymorphisms, respectively. The structures of the populations were analyzed using four different approaches. Within the worldwide population, three of the methods gave a very coherent picture of the population structure. Fodder beet and sugar beet accessions were grouped together, separated from <b>garden</b> <b>beets</b> and sea beets, reflecting well the origins of beet domestication. The structure of the elite panel, however, was less stable between clustering methods, which was probably because of the high level of genetic mixing in breeding programs. For the linkage disequilibrium analysis, the usual measure (r (2)) was used, and compared with others that correct for population structure and relatedness (r (S) (2), r (V) (2), r (VS) (2)). The LD as measured by r (2) persisted beyond 10 cM within the elite panel and fell below 0. 1 after less than 2 cM in the worldwide population, for almost all chromosomes. With correction for relatedness, LD decreased under 0. 1 by 1 cM for almost all chromosomes in both populations, except for chromosomes 3 and 9 within the elite panel. In these regions, the larger extent of LD could be explained by strong selection pressure...|$|R

40|$|Four {{mitochondrial}} minisatellites {{were used}} to study cytoplasmic diversity in leaf and <b>garden</b> <b>beet</b> germplasm resources. Eleven multi-locus haplotypes were identified, of which one (named mitochondrial minisatellite haplotype 4, hereafter min 04) was associated with male-sterile Owen cytoplasm and two others (min 09 and min 18), with a normal fertile cytoplasm. European leaf beet germplasm exhibited the greatest haplotype diversity, with min 09 and min 18 predominating. In North African leaf beet accessions, only these two haplotypes were observed, making it likely that North African accessions were descended from European genotypes. The prevalence of min 18 was also noted in leaf beet from the Middle East and western Asia. Such a pattern contrasts with that found in east Asian leaf beet where the two haplotypes were extremely rare. The geographical structure of the mitochondrial haplotypes allowed us to infer possible dissemination pathways of leaf beet. Additionally, we showed that mitochondrial genome diversity was low in <b>garden</b> <b>beet</b> germplasm, with min 18 being highly predominant. An explanation of this limited diversity {{may lie in the}} geographically restricted origin of as well as relatively short cultivation histories of <b>garden</b> <b>beet...</b>|$|E
40|$|Abstract. During 2003 – 05, {{a survey}} for {{phytoplasmas}} {{was carried out}} in sesame fields in Yazd province (Iran). The leafhopper Orosius albicinctus was collected and found to contain a phytoplasma. Transmission tests were performed under greenhouse conditions. The indicator plants were alfalfa, rapeseed, <b>garden</b> <b>beet,</b> sesame, radish, periwinkle and garden cress. A nested polymerase chain reaction using phytoplasma universal primers was used to detect phytoplasmas in indicator plants and leafhoppers. Amplification of a phytoplasma-characteristic 1. 2 -kb 16 S rDNA fragment confirmed that sesame, garden cress and <b>garden</b> <b>beet</b> plants were infected by the phytoplasma. On the basis of RFLP analysis of the amplified DNA fragments using five endonucleases, the detected phytoplasma belonged to the 16 SrII group (peanut witches ’ broom phytoplasma). This is the first report of transmission of a phytoplasma associated with sesame phyllody by O. albicinctus in Iran. Phyllody {{is one of the most}} important diseases of sesame (Sesamum indicum) in Iran. The disease incidence varies in different regions of the country.

The prediction performance of the model with respect to the data used was highly acceptable. R 2 values of regression co-efficients for each crop varied from 0. 94 to 0. 99 depending on the species. Plotting the actual days from seed sowing to emergence for all the crops against the predicted ones showed that the prediction performance of the model was good explaining 98 % of the variation for combined data from all the crops.

40|$|In {{the years}} 2001 - 2003, {{research}} {{was carried out}} to determine to what extent seed germination capacity of selected vegetable species indicates their field emergence potential. The experiment included 10 species: white head cabbage, <b>garden</b> carrot, red <b>beet,</b> onion, cucumber, tomato, radish, head lettuce, snap dwarf bean and garden pea. The seeds came from 4 commercial seed companies operating on the Polish market. The seeds of red beet and radish from different seed companies had different germination capacities, field emergence and ratio of emergence to germination capacity, but the other species did not differ. The highest ratios of emergences to germination capacity were found for radish (82. 3 %) and white head cabbage (81. 2 %), whereas the lowest were for carrot (44. 6 %) and head lettuce (45. 1 %). The species differed by {{the stability of the}} ratio in various years of the experiment, i. e. they responded differently in the given year to the weather conditions.

40|$|Background Recent {{research}} into the use of dietary nitrates and their role in vascular function has led to it becoming progressively more popular amongst athletes attempting to enhance performance. Objective The objective of this review was to perform a systematic review and meta-analysis of the literature to evaluate the effect of dietary nitrate (NO 3 −) supplementation on endurance exercise performance. An additional aim {{was to determine whether}} the performance outcomes are affected by potential moderator variables. Data sources Relevant databases such as Cochrane Library, Embase, PubMed, Ovid, Scopus and Web of Science were searched for the following search terms ‘nitrates OR nitrate OR beetroot OR table beet OR <b>garden</b> <b>beet</b> OR red beet AND exercise AND performance’ from inception to October 2015. Study selection Studies were included if a placebo versus dietary nitrate-only supplementation protocol was able to be compared, and if a quantifiable measure of exercise performance was ≥ 30 s (for a single bout of exercise or the combined total for multiple bouts). Study appraisal and synthesis The literature search identified 1038 studies, with 47 (76 trials) meeting the inclusion criteria. Data from the 76 trials were extracted for inclusion in the meta-analysis. A fixed-effects meta-analysis was conducted for time trial (TT) (n = 28), time to exhaustion (TTE) (n = 22) and graded-exercise test (GXT) (n = 8) protocols. Univariate meta-regression was used to assess potential moderator variables (exercise type, dose duration, NO 3 − type, study quality, fitness level and percentage nitrite change). Results Pooled analysis identified a trivial but non-significant effect in favour of dietary NO 3 − supplementation [effect size (ES) = − 0. 10, 95...|$|E
