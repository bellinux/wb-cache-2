25|$|Once the acidic {{groundwater}} {{drained from}} the caverns, speleothems {{began to be}} deposited within the cavern. Erosion above ground created the natural entrance to the Carlsbad Caverns within the last million years. Exposure to the surface has allowed for the influx of air into the cavern. Rainwater and snowmelt percolating downward into the <b>ground</b> <b>pick</b> up carbon dioxide; once this water reaches a cavern ceiling, it precipitates and evaporates, leaving behind a small calcium carbonate deposit. Growths from the roof downward formed through this process are known as stalactites. Additionally, water {{on the floor of}} the caverns can contain carbonic acid and generate mineral deposits by evaporation. Growths from the floor upward through this process are known as stalagmites. Different formations of speleothems include columns, soda straws, draperies, helictites, and popcorn. Changes in the ambient air temperature and rainfall affect the rate of growth of speleothems, as higher temperatures increase carbon dioxide production rates within the overlying soil. The color of the speleothems is determined by the trace constituents in the minerals of the formation.|$|E
60|$|We {{were now}} ordered to divide {{ourselves}} into groups of three, {{and go over}} the <b>ground,</b> <b>pick</b> up the wounded, and carry them to a large house that had been selected as a hospital. My party consisted of Bill Southard, Simeon Grant, and myself, we being messmates. The first man we fell in with, was a young English soldier, who was seated on the bank, quite near the lake. He was badly hurt, and sat leaning his head on his hands. He begged for water, and I took his cap down to the lake and filled it, giving him a drink; then washing his face. This revived him, and he offered us his canteen, in which was some excellent Jamaica. To us chaps, who got nothing better than whiskey, this was a rare treat, and we emptied {{the remainder of his}} half pint, at a pull apiece. After tapping this rum, we carried the poor lad up to the house, and turned him over to the doctors. We found the rooms filled with wounded already, and the American and English doctors hard at work on them.|$|E

C-BASS North is a 6.1m Gregorian telescope, the dish was donated to the project by the Jet Propulsion Laboratory and it has started performing survey observations. C-BASS South is a 7.6-m Cassegrain telescope with a dish donated by Telkom (South Africa). It is currently {{in the final stages of}} commissioning at Hartebeesthoek Radio Astronomy Observatory and is forecast to begin survey observations in 2014 when it is deployed in the Karoo. The secondary mirrors on both telescopes are supported by cones of radio-transparent foam to minimize the contamination from <b>ground</b> <b>pick</b> up and to avoid scattering the incoming polarized radiation.|$|E

There are variants of how the players decide who goes first: it is usually through [...] "flipping," [...] (the set of jacks is placed in cupped hands, flipped {{to the back of}} the hands, and then back to cupped hands again; the player who keeps the most from falling goes first), but may be via ip dip, or eeny, meeny, miny, moe, or a variant thereof.

50|$|Each battleground is {{a linear}} path {{in which the}} player's base is located {{on one side and}} the enemy base is located on the other side.

Each side must use their funding, which is automatically replenished at a rate of ten money units every half-second approximately, to build various units that will travel the length of the battlefield while doing battle with opposing units. If a unit successfully manage to reach the opposing end of the battlefield, the unit will cause a certain amount of damage to the enemy base. The battle is over when a side manages to damage the opposing base enough to destroy it.|$|E
50|$|The Multilift MPH (Military Pivoting Hooklift) {{range is}} based around commercially proven technologies, the overall system {{performance}} being improved by enhancing below <b>ground</b> <b>pick</b> {{up and the}} ability to load misaligned flatracks, both important military operational requirements. The complete system is designed to be used in all operational conditions, including darkness or while wearing nuclear, biological and chemical (NBC) protective equipment. An automatic, fully sequenced control system mounted in the cab aids operational safety and maximises speed, even under battle conditions. The MPH range was designed and optimised to load, transport and unload flatracks conforming to the NATO standard (STANAG 2413). Flatracks can be pre-loaded at base with any military payload ready for dispersal to the required location. Payloads such as MLRS rockets, light armoured vehicles and command/control shelters can also be transported by using purpose-built flatracks with the correct locking systems built in.|$|E

50|$|Carlsbad Caverns National Park is {{situated}} in a bed of limestone above groundwater level. During cavern development, it was within the groundwater zone. Deep below the limestones are petroleum reserves (part of the Mid-Continent Oil Field). At a time {{near the end of}} the Cenozoic, hydrogen sulfide (H2S) began to seep upwards from the petroleum into the groundwater. The combination of hydrogen sulfide and oxygen from the water formed sulfuric acid: H2S + 2O2 → H2SO4. The sulfuric acid then continued upward, aggressively dissolving the limestone deposits to form caverns. The presence of gypsum within the cave is a confirmation of the occurrence of this process, as it is a byproduct of the reaction between sulfuric acid and limestone.Once the acidic groundwater drained from the caverns, speleothems began to be deposited within the cavern. Erosion above ground created the natural entrance to the Carlsbad Caverns within the last million years. Exposure to the surface has allowed for the influx of air into the cavern.

This handy guide presents the most succulent menus and colorful personalities in Kentucky. While other states are better known for their ’cue, the Kentucky style is distinct because of its use of mutton and traditional cooking methods.

We achieved a point source sensitivity of 63 ± 7 mJy with the seven 0. 6 m dishes in 1 hour of on-source integration in 2 -patch differencing observations.

30|$|Considering {{that before}} the 2011 Tohoku Earthquake, the seismic {{activity}} on the northern Pacific coast of Japan was relatively low, and since the 2011 event the seismic activity has not also reduced to pre-quake levels, this earthquake was considered an aftershock of the 2011 Tohoku-Oki Earthquake (Rathi 2016; Aoki and Kikuchi 2016). The moment tensor solution was estimated by several agencies, including the Global CMT Catalog project, the USGS, and the National Research Institute of Earth Science and Disaster Resilience (NIED). All solutions proposed a normal faulting mechanism for this earthquake. The associated moment magnitude, however, differed for each solution. For instance, the GCMT solution estimated a moment magnitude of 3.18 × 10 ^ 19 Nm (Mw = 6.9), with a focal depth at 12.0 km; the USGS’s solution estimated a moment magnitude of 2.48 × 10 ^ 19 Nm (Mw = 6.90), with a focal depth at 9.0 km; and the NIED’s solution estimated a moment magnitude of 3.47 × 10 ^ 19 Nm (Mw = 7.0; M_JMA = 7.4), with a focal depth at 11.0 km. The relative differences of the estimated solutions indicates that further {{studies are needed to}} better constrain its value.
