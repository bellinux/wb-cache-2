25|$|The Nationals′ {{attempt to}} honor the Montreal-Washington franchise′s entire history in the Ring of Honor, {{as well as by}} {{tracking}} Montreal-Washington franchise records, is not without controversy. Although Nationals fans generally take little interest in the franchise′s Montreal years, some <b>do</b> <b>appreciate</b> acknowledging that the franchise has a history that predates its arrival in Washington, and former Expo Tim Raines received a warm round of applause from fans at Nationals Park at his induction ceremony on August 28, 2017, even though he had never even visited Washington, D.C., before, let alone played baseball there. Some Montreal Expos fans express appreciation that the Nationals are honoring the Expos, and Expos players inducted into the Ring of Honor have expressed gratitude that the Nationals chose to include them, especially with no MLB team in Montreal {{to honor the}}ir careers. However, few Nationals fans have taken an interest in franchise records, preferring to compare Nationals records with those of previous Washington MLB teams instead, and a segment of Nationals fans actively opposes the inclusion of Expos history into that of the Nationals, taking the view that the Montreal years are irrelevant to Washington and that the team made a complete break with its past and started anew when it arrived in Washington, inheriting the history of the two Washington Senators teams rather than that of the Expos. Similarly, Montreal Expos fans have taken little or no interest in the achievements of Nationals players, and some Expos fans strongly oppose the inclusion of former Expos in the Ring, taking the position that to do so is to co-opt the history of the Expos, which they say belongs solely in Montreal.|$|E

500|$|Jennifer Lopez: Feelin' So Good {{received}} generally favorable {{reviews from}} critics. Perry Seibert of Allmusic awarded the DVD {{three out of}} five stars, commenting that fans of Lopez will [...] "greatly enjoy this disc", but it carries little interest to the average DVD consumer. Aaron Beierle of DVD Talk stated that: [...] "It's interesting to watch this disc after watching Lopez in The Cell. I think it's been impressive to watch her mature as an actress; although {{much has been made}} of her supposedly demanding attitude, I think she's talented as not only a singer/dancer but as a dramatic actress – I'm sure a comedic role is right around the corner". The reviewer additionally stated that the most interesting segment of the release was the [...] "Waiting for Tonight" [...] music video. He concluded by stating that: [...] "Although I'm not really a big fan of her music, I <b>do</b> <b>appreciate</b> it and found it enjoyable and entertaining to listen to throughout." [...] Beierle compared Jennifer Lopez: Feelin' So Good to the video releases of Mariah Carey. The interview footage in-between the performance segments has been described as [...] "very slick and promotional". It was also noted that in the interview footage Lopez [...] "comes through energetically" [...] and without [...] "much star-ego". In the United States, Jennifer Lopez: Feelin' So Good was certified as a Gold Video Longform by the Recording Industry Association of America (RIAA) for shipments of 50,000 units.|$|E

And then, everyone in the media runs with it as if it's the truth. And that's a little weird. But what's even weirder is that the song is not about Isaac Lurier, as the rabbis claim. It's named after Yitzhak Sinwani, who's singing in Yemenite on the track. I couldn't think of a title for the song. So I called it [...] "Isaac" [...] It's interesting how their minds work, those naughty rabbis.

Most of them have, of course, an agenda; mostly born-again Christians looking to save my soul.

Bassist Joe Lally was asked about his thoughts on the Wugazi release, and stated [...] "I think they could've found better Fugazi pieces to sample with Wu-Tang guys rapping on it.

2500|$|Though {{the fight}} was {{initially}} kept under wraps, both Russell and Clooney eventually gave official statements saying that the argument had blown over and neither harbored any ill will towards the other. However, Clooney continued to describe the event in later interviews, {{as well as the}} cover story of the October 2003 issue of Vanity Fair, in which he states: [...] "I would not stand for him humiliating and yelling and screaming at crew members, who weren't allowed to defend themselves. I don't believe in it and it makes me crazy. So my job was then to humiliate the people who were doing the humiliating." [...] Executive producer and production manager Gregory Goodman later stated about Clooney's comments in the media, [...] "It doesn't reflect well on [...] It's like some stupid sandbox quarrel." [...] In early 2012, Clooney indicated that he and Russell had mended their relationship, saying [...] "We made a really, really great film, and we had a really rough time together, but it's a case of both of us getting older.
