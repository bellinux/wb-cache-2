40|$|Digital {{soil mapping}} {{typically}} involves inputs of digital elevation models, remotely sensed imagery, and other spatially explicit digital data as environmental covariates to predict soil classes and attributes over a landscape using statistical models. Digital imagery from Landsat 5, a digital elevation model, and a digital geology map {{were used as}} environmental covariates in a 67, 000 -ha study area of the Great Basin west of Fillmore, UT. A “pre-map” was created for selecting sampling locations. Several indices were derived from the Landsat imagery, including a normalized difference vegetation index, normalized difference ratios from bands 5 / 2, bands 5 / 7, bands 4 / 7, and bands 5 / 4. Slope, topographic curvature, inverse wetness index, and area solar radiation were calculated from the digital elevation model. The greatest variation across the study area was found by calculating the Optimum <b>Index</b> <b>Factor</b> of covariates, choosing band 7, normalized difference ratio bands 5 / 2, normalized difference vegetation index, slope, profile curvature, and area solar radiation. A 20 -class ISODATA unsupervised classification of these six data layers was reduced to 12. Comparing the 12 -class map to a geologic map, 166 sites were chosen weighted by areal extent; 158 sites were visited. Twelve points were added using case-based reasoning to total 170 points for model training. A validation set of 50 sites was selected using conditioned Latin Hypercube Sampling. Density plots of sample sets compared to raw data produced comparable results. Geology was used to stratify the study area into areas {{above and below the}} Lake Bonneville highstand shoreline. Raster data were subset to these areas, and predictions were made on each area. Spatial modeling was performed with three different models: random forests, support vector machines, and bagged classification trees. A set of covariates selected by random forests variable importance and the set of Optimum <b>Index</b> <b>Factor</b> covariates were used in the models. The Optimum <b>Index</b> <b>Factor</b> covariates produced the best classification using random forests. Classification accuracy was 45. 7 %.

40|$|The {{estimation}} of rare frequency rainfall {{is an essential}} prerequisite {{for the design of}} engineering structures and to determine risk areas. Index-based methods are among the most applied for regional frequency analysis of hydrological variables such as discharge and rainfall and comprise two stages: the mapping of a scale or “index” factor and the derivation of rainfall growth curves. The underlying hypothesis of these methods is that cumulative distribution functions of a certain random variable can be assumed homogeneous on a given region, except for the <b>index</b> <b>factor,</b> which varies spatially in that region and is often represented by the expected value of the random variable itself at a given location. Methods either to single out homogeneous regions or to evaluate the <b>index</b> <b>factor</b> can be purely statistical and physically based. In this paper a robust and transferable physically based methodology is proposed to estimate the <b>index</b> <b>factor</b> for rainfall in mountainous regions referred to in the following text as “index rainfall. ” Index rainfall is defined as the expected value of annual rainfall maxima recorded in a fixed time window: a time window of 1 h is used. Reliable estimates of the index rainfall are obtained at ungauged sites by applying a relationship, based on a multivariate linear regression obtained at gauged sites, of rainfall and selected synthetic descriptors for atmospheric climate and orography. An extended and general set of descriptors is chosen from parameters that are considered in the literature to affect rainfall intensity. The relevant relief descriptors, defining slope, elevation, orientation, etc., at a given location, are extracted from digital elevation models (DEMs). A 2 D Fourier series analysis of the DEM is performed and a spectral analysis is carried out to single out the components with the highest morphological information content. The synthetic relief descriptors are evaluated along different cross sections of the 2 D truncated Fourier series to single out the role of the prevailing convection direction of extreme rainfall-producing meteorological patterns. The optimal descriptor subset for the study area is then extracted to maximize transferability of the method. Application to the Italian and French Alps and the Apennines shows encouraging results. Descriptor subset extraction has been tested and validated on independent subsets of index rainfall estimates in the regions. Results demonstrate that the proposed method is robust, transferable, and reliable for the evaluation of the index rainfall in ungauged sites...|$|E

Methods: Community-dwelling adults with no known history of CHD (n = 2195, mean age 46. 9618. 7 years, 51. 8 % women) participated in the 1995 Nova Scotia Health Survey.
