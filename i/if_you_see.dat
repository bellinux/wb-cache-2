500|$|Brooks & Dunn {{collaborated with}} Reba McEntire to perform [...] "If You See Him/If You See Her", {{which was the}} lead-off single to Brooks & Dunn's <b>If</b> <b>You</b> <b>See</b> Her and McEntire's <b>If</b> <b>You</b> <b>See</b> Him, {{both of which were}} {{released}} on the same day. Arista Nashville and MCA Nashville, the label to which McEntire was signed, both promoted the single. This cut went to number one, as did <b>If</b> <b>You</b> <b>See</b> Hers next two singles: [...] "How Long Gone" [...] and a cover of Roger Miller's [...] "Husbands and Wives", which also became the duo's first top 40 hit on the Billboard Hot 100. Dunn recorded the vocals for [...] "Husbands and Wives" [...] in one take. Also included on the album was [...] "Born and Raised in Black and White", the first song of the duo's career in which they alternated on lead vocals. The album's fourth single was [...] "I Can't Get Over You", which was a top five country hit. Following it was [...] "South of Santa Fe", which peaked at number 41 on the country charts and thus became the duo's lowest-peaking single there. In 2001, <b>If</b> <b>You</b> <b>See</b> Her reached double-platinum certification in the United States.|$|E
500|$|In 1997, McEntire headlined a {{tour with}} Brooks & Dunn {{that led to}} the {{recording}} of [...] "If You See Him/If You See Her" [...] with the duo the following year. This song was included on McEntire's <b>If</b> <b>You</b> <b>See</b> Him album and Brooks & Dunn's <b>If</b> <b>You</b> <b>See</b> Her album, both of which were released on June 2. Thom Owens of AllMusic reported in its review that both album titles were named nearly the same as [...] "a way to draw attention for both parties, since they were no longer new guns—they were veterans in danger of losing ground to younger musicians". The duet reached No. 1 on the Billboard Hot Country Singles & Tracks chart in June 1998 and spawned an additional three Top 10 hits during that year: [...] "Forever Love", [...] "Wrong Night", and [...] "One Honest Heart". In addition, <b>If</b> <b>You</b> <b>See</b> Him peaked within the Top 10 on both the Billboard 200 and Top Country Albums chart, reaching No. 8 and No. 2, respectively.|$|E

500|$|Wark {{played as}} a central defender, midfielder and, occasionally, as a striker. Wark was an unusual player; {{he was able to}} play as a {{defensive}} midfielder yet break forward to score. According to former team-mate Terry Butcher, this was because his colleagues would drop back to cover for him: [...] "I played with John Wark, who was a sitting midfielder but was one of the top scorers in England and Europe. <b>If</b> <b>you</b> <b>see</b> it, then do it, as long as the others spot it and cover for you." ...|$|E

Call him a racist in signs <b>if</b> <b>you</b> <b>see</b> him. Call him an injustice. Call him {{whatever you want to}} call him, but in his face all the time."

500|$|For [...] "Twenty-Twenty Surgery" [...] Lazzara {{had several}} lyrics and melodies, [...] "but nothing was working {{and it was}} the most {{frustrating}} thing"; its chorus was the album's final composition. Mascherino called [...] "Spin" [...] "this album’s 'The Union', but on steroids." [...] He soloed on [...] "Miami," [...] encouraged by Lazzara when the band was recording its demo. Lazzara later called the solo [...] "funny and great." [...] According to Mascherino, the group wanted the song [...] "to sound as much like the Cure as possible, so it’s all clean guitars." [...] He said that the drums on [...] "I'll Let You Live" [...] were recorded at a faster tempo, sounding [...] "totally deeper" [...] when played back. [...] "Sleep" [...] was the band's attempt at a Motown-inspired bass sound. [...] "Brooklyn (<b>If</b> <b>You</b> <b>See</b> Something, Say Something)" [...] contains a [...] "real floaty, airy pre-chorus and then it’s upbeat but dark," [...] according to Lazzara. He did not regret dropping [...] "Sleep" [...] and [...] "Brooklyn" [...] from the final track listing [...] "because when you listen to everything down, they just didn’t really feel like they fit." ...|$|E
500|$|The {{title is}} a tongue-in-cheek pun on male {{masturbation}} ("take off your pants and jack it"). Previous titles had included <b>If</b> <b>You</b> <b>See</b> Kay (a pun on the spelling of [...] "fuck") and Genital Ben, {{accompanied by a}} bear {{on the cover of}} the album (a reference to Gentle Ben). Stressed at being at a loss for a name, DeLonge asked guitar tech Larry Palm for suggestions. The album's title was coined by Palm, who was snowboarding on a rainy day. Inside the lodge, Palm was congregating with friends when a young kid walked in completely drenched, to which his mother suggested he [...] "take off [...] pants and jacket." [...] Palm was told by DeLonge that if the band were to use the name, he would [...] "hook him up". Instead, Palm received a letter from manager Rick DeVoe for his contribution, which offered a $500 payout for the name. Palm scoffed at the amount, and filed suit in 2003 with the intellectual property attorney Ralph Loeb, alleging breach of contract and fraud against the band. Palm demanded $20,000; the band eventually settled out of court for $10,000.|$|E

500|$|The graphic emblem most {{associated}} with the straight edge movement is a black [...] "X", typically drawn on the wearer's hands with a marker. According to MacKaye, [...] "We were in San Francisco, and we played a place called Mabuhay Gardens. They figured out we were underage, and they wouldn't let us play. We worked out a deal with their management that {{we just wanted to}} play and we weren't going to drink, so they got a marker and put a big 'X' on our hand, So we came back to Washington D.C. and went to this nightclub, the 9:30, and said 'Hey look, we're not going to drink and we will put this 'X' on our hand. <b>If</b> <b>you</b> <b>see</b> us drinking you can throw us out forever. We are not going to drink, we just came to see the music'". The band adopted the marking, and though it was initially meant to signify youth, it became a wider emblem for bands prepared to play to audiences under the legal age to be served alcohol. MacKaye noted that at the time the symbol [...] "wasn't supposed to signify straight edge—it was supposed to signify kids. It was about being young punk rockers... it represents youth".|$|E

[...] On New Year's Eve, [...] "What's It Feel Like to Be a Ghost?" [...] was released as a single.|$|E
500|$|Since airing, {{the episode}} has {{received}} mostly positive reviews from television critics. The {{authors of the}} book I Can't Believe It's a Bigger and Better Updated Unofficial Simpsons Guide, Warren Martyn and Adrian Wood, wrote: [...] "A Christmas special in all but name, and a touching look at the relationship between Marge and her growing Bart." [...] Dave Foster of DVD Times said that [...] "thanks to the keen eye of the writers and the rarely shown good side of Bart, this episode works very well as both an amusing insight to the way a child’s mind works and as a strong relationship building episode between Bart and Marge." [...] DVD Movie Guide's Colin Jacobson said that despite {{being one of the}} [...] "sappier" [...] episodes at times, it [...] "still packs some terrific laughs". Jacobson commented that he [...] "absolutely lost it when Homer’s drawing of a robot grilling a hot dog was seen - it’s funnier <b>if</b> <b>you</b> <b>see</b> it - and Lawrence Tierney’s guest turn as the store detective adds hilarious grit to the show." [...] He added that the episode does not [...] "fall into the classic" [...] category, [...] "but it offers more than enough entertainment to satisfy". Jennifer Malkowski of DVD Verdict considered {{the best part of the}} episode to be when a depressed Bart makes a snowman from the dirty, leftover snow under the car. She called the scene [...] "amazingly pathetic". Malkowski concluded her review by giving the episode a grade of B. In 2011, Richard Lawson of The Atlantic Wire cited it as the best Christmas episode of The Simpsons, noting that [...] "it's very sweet and there are some funny videogame jokes". He added that the episode [...] "features a terrific guest starring voice performance from the late Lawrence Tierney". Charlie Sweatpants, author of the online book Zombie Simpsons: How the Best Show Ever Became the Broadcasting Undead and creator of the blog Dead Homer Society, claims that it is the [...] "one bad episode" [...] in season seven, due to it being an example of a very special episode; however, he claims that it is only bad by the [...] "towering" [...] standards of the earlier seasons.|$|E
