5|$|The Sharabha Upanishad {{mentions}} that shara means jiva ("soul") and Hari (Vishnu) is <b>gleaming</b> <b>in</b> {{the form of}} Sharabha, and that Hari has manifested as Sharabha who is capable of granting moksha (salvation). There is a reference to Sharabha in the Vishnu sahasranama, the 1000 names of Vishnu, and the literal meaning seems to suggest the praise of Sharabha (the lion-killing animal).|$|E
25|$|Entering {{from the}} stairs via a vestibule, {{there were three}} main rooms — one for cattleyas, laelias, and hybrids; one for odontoglossums, oncidiums, miltonias, and their hybrids; and a {{tropical}} room (according to Fer-de-Lance). It must have been quite a sight with the angle-iron staging <b>gleaming</b> <b>in</b> its silver paint and on the concrete benches and shelves 10,000 pots of orchids in glorious, exultant bloom.|$|E
25|$|Blade Runner {{depicts a}} future whose fictional {{distance}} from present reality has grown sharply smaller as 2020 approaches. The film delves {{into the future}} implications of technology {{on the environment and}} society by reaching into the past using literature, religious symbolism, classical dramatic themes and film noir. This tension between past, present and future is apparent in the retrofitted future of Blade Runner, which is high-tech and <b>gleaming</b> <b>in</b> places but elsewhere decayed and old.|$|E

500|$|Blade Runner delves {{into the}} effects of {{technology}} {{on the environment and}} society by reaching to the past, using literature, religious symbolism, classical dramatic themes, and film noir techniques. This tension between past, present, and future is mirrored in the [...] "retrofitted" [...] future depicted in the film, one which is high-tech and <b>gleaming</b> <b>in</b> places but decayed and outdated elsewhere. In an interview with The Observer in 2002, director Ridley Scott described the film as [...] "extremely dark, both literally and metaphorically, with an oddly masochistic feel". He also said that he [...] "liked the idea of exploring pain" [...] {{in the wake of his}} brother's death from skin cancer: [...] "When he was ill, I used to go and visit him in London, and that was really traumatic for me." ...|$|E
2500|$|Ben Sira {{wrote of}} the splendor of the High Priest's {{garments}} in [...] saying “How glorious he was [...] [...] [...] as {{he came out of}} the House of the curtain. Like the morning star among the clouds, like the full moon at the festal season; like the sun shining on the Temple of the Most High, like the rainbow <b>gleaming</b> <b>in</b> splendid clouds.” ...|$|E
2500|$|Jones' binge {{drinking}} {{and use of}} amphetamines on the road caught up to him in 1967 {{and he had to}} be admitted into a neurological hospital to seek treatment for his drinking. [...] Jones would go to extreme lengths for a drink if the thirst was on him. [...] Perhaps the most famous drinking story concerning Jones occurred while he was married to his second wife Shirley Corley. [...] Jones recalled Shirley making it physically impossible for him to travel to Beaumont, located 8 miles away, to buy liquor. Because Jones would not walk that far, she would hide the keys to each of their cars they owned before leaving. She did not, however, hide the keys to the lawn mower. [...] Upset, Jones walked to the window and looked out over his property. [...] He later described his thoughts in his memoir: [...] "There, <b>gleaming</b> <b>in</b> the glow, was that ten-horsepower rotary engine under a seat. A key glistening in the ignition. I imagine the top speed for that old mower was five miles per hour. It might have taken {{an hour and a half}} or more for me to get to the liquor store, but get there I did." [...] Years later Jones comically mocked the incident by making a cameo in the video for [...] "All My Rowdy Friends Are Coming Over Tonight" [...] by Hank Williams Jr.. He also parodied the episode in the 1993 video for [...] "One More Last Chance" [...] by Vince Gill and in his own music video for the single [...] "Honky Tonk Song" [...] in 1996. Curiously, in her 1979 autobiography Stand By Your Man, Tammy Wynette claims the incident occurred while she was married to Jones, maintaining that she woke up at one o'clock in the morning to find her husband gone: [...] "I got into the car and drove to the nearest bar 10 miles away. When I pulled into the parking lot there sat our rider-mower right by the entrance. He'd driven that mower right down a main highway. [...] He looked up and saw me and said, ‘Well, fellas, here she is now. My little wife, I told you she'd come after me.’" ...|$|E
