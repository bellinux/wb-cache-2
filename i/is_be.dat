25|$|A {{holiday centre}} is a {{facility}} that specializes in providing apartments, chalets and camping pitches for visiting holidaymakers.

25|$|Since {{tamarins}} can {{discriminate between}} predatory threats using varying vocalizations, recipients of an AC {{are thought to}} extract various complex signals from this form of communication.

Further, adults are able to discriminate the gender of callers from their ACs and determine the range of calls within a related tamarin's alarm calling repertoire.
