Since there is an indication of the existance of virulence variation of tungro viruses from different areas and the specific relationship between resistance of varieties and tungro viruses isolates, it is important to study the pathogenicity of tungro viruses from some endemic areas in Indonesia. This study aimed to identify the pathogenicity of tungro viruses from several endemic areas in Indonesia in some resistant varieties. One susceptible variety i. e.

Tungro {{is caused by the}} infection of two different viruses namely tungro bacilliform virus (RTBV) and tungro spherical virus (RTSV).

The variation of tungro viruses from different areas had been reported, and there is a specific relationship between resistance variety and tungro virus isolate. It is important therefore, to study the virulences and the genetic diversities of tungro viruses derived from the endemic areas in Indonesia. This study was aimed to identify the virulence and the molecular diversity of tungro viruses from endemic areas in Indonesia. Susceptible variety TN 1 was used in the study. Surveys and collection of the infected plants and <b>green</b> <b>leafhoppers</b> were conducted in some tungro endemic areas, including: West Java, Central Java, Yogyakarta, Central Sulawesi, West Sulawesi, South Sulawesi, Bali and West Nusa Tenggara.

The virulence of tungro viruses was determined based on diseases indexes (DI). Results showed that the virulence of tungro viruses varied among region in the endemic areas in Indonesia. The Central Java virus isolate was the most virulence; however, not all isolates from endemic areas in the island of Java were more virulent than those from outside of Java. The presence of RTBV and RTSV was detected in the infected TN 1 plants. The existences of molecular diversities of tungro viruses from the endemic areas were observed. The relationship between combination of DNA bands of RTBV and RTSV with the virulence in endemic areas outside of Java was more complex than it was in West Java and Central Java.

The interaction between host and virus-vector are still quitted difficult to understand. The aims of this study were: (i) to know {{the character of the}} total protein band pattern of rice plants infected with tungro virus compared to the health one, (ii) to look at the different between the band profiles of total protein of N. virescens that consume the host rice plants infected by tungro virus and that of the healthy rice plants. Total protein band profiles of rice plants were identified using SDS-PAGE. To extract the leaves, buffer merchapto-ethanol was used, while the sample extraction of <b>green</b> <b>leafhoppers</b> employed buffer PBS IX, and for staining the protein coomassie brilliant blue was used. Data were analyzed descriptively based on the score of the migration of the band (Rf). The results showed that the protein contains of every 0. 5 g of healthy leaves and the infected by the virus were 0. 567 g and 1. 011 g respectively. Clear difference of the protein pattern was found in the healthy plant and the infected one. In general, the entire band in the infected plant was much thicker compared to the infected leaves. Protein bands with a higher quantity were expressed by the protein on the molecular weight of 108, and 117 kDa.

40|$|Rice tungro disease (RTD) is a {{significant}} yield constraint in rice-growing areas of South and Southeast Asia. Disease symptoms are caused largely by infection by the rice tungro bacilliform virus (RTBV). Two host transcription factors, RF 2 a and RF 2 b, regulate expression of the RTBV promoter and are important for plant development. Expression of a dominant negative mutant of these factors in transgenic rice resulted in phenotypes that mimic the symptoms of RTD, whereas overexpression of RF 2 a and RF 2 b had essentially no impact on plant development. Conversely, lines with elevated expression of RF 2 a or RF 2 b showed weak or no symptoms of infection after Agrobacterium inoculation of RTBV, whereas control plants showed severe stunting and leaf discoloration. Furthermore, transgenic plants exhibited reduced accumulation of RTBV RNA and viral DNA compared with nontransgenic plants.

GRH, a vascular feeder, secretes watery and gelling saliva in the process of feeding on phloem and xylem sap. It is known that GRH saliva contains several bioactive proteins, including enzymes such as laccase and beta-glucosidase. In this study, we performed transcriptome analysis of salivary glands of GRH using Illumina paired-end sequencing. Of 51, 788 assembled contigs, 16, 017 (30. 9 %) showed significant similarity to known proteins in the NCBI nr database, while 34, 978 (67. 5 %) could not be annotated by similarity search, Pfam, or gene ontology (GO). Contigs (905) with predicted signal peptides and no putative transmembrane domains are suggested to represent secreted protein coding genes. Among the 76 most highly expressed putative secretory protein contigs, 68 transcripts were found to be salivary gland-specific or at least -dominant, but not expressed in stomach or Malpighian tubules. However, 45 of the 68 transcripts were unknown proteins. These findings suggest that most of the GRH transcripts encoding secreted proteins expressed in salivary glands are species and/or tissue specific. Our results provide a fundamental list of genes involved in GRH–Poaceae host plant interactions including successful feeding and plant pathogen transmission...|$|R
