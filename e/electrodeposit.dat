As a synthesis technique, electrodeposition is a simple and scalable process to produce non-wetting metal surfaces. There are three main categories of superhydrophobic surfaces made by electrodeposition: (i) <b>electrodeposits</b> that are inherently non-wetting due to hierarchical roughness generated from the process; (ii) <b>electrodeposits</b> with plated surface roughness that are further modified with low surface energy material; (iii) composite <b>electrodeposits</b> with co-deposited inert and hydrophobic particles.

5000|$|Sonoelectrochemistry is the {{application}} of ultrasound in electrochemistry. Like sonochemistry, sonoelectrochemistry was discovered in the early 20th century. The effects of power ultrasound on electrochemical systems and important electrochemical parameters were originally demonstrated by Moriguchi and then by Schmid and Ehert [...] when the researchers investigated the influence of ultrasound on concentration polarisation, metal passivation {{and the production of}} electrolytic gases in aqueous solutions. In the late 1950s, Kolb and Nyborg showed that the electrochemical solution (or electroanalyte) hydrodynamics in an electrochemical cell was greatly increased in the presence of ultrasound and described this phenomenon as acoustic streaming. In 1959, Penn et al. demonstrated that sonication had a great effect on the electrode surface activity and electroanalyte species concentration profile throughout the solution. In the early 1960s, the electrochemist Allen J. Bard showed in controlled potential coulometry experiments that ultrasound significantly enhances mass transport of electrochemical species from the bulk solution to the electroactive surface. In the range of ultrasonic frequencies kHz - 2 MHz, ultrasound has been applied to many electrochemical systems, processes and areas of electrochemistry (to name but a few: electroplating, electrodeposition, electropolymerisation, electrocoagulation, organic electrosynthesis, materials electrochemistry, environmental electrochemistry, electroanalytical chemistry, hydrogen energy and fuel cell technology) both in academia and industry, as this technology offers several benefits over traditional technologies. The advantages are as follows: significant thinning of the diffusion layer thickness (δ) at the electrode surface; increase in electrodeposit/electroplating thickness; increase in electrochemical rates, yields and efficiencies; increase in <b>electrodeposit</b> porosity and hardness; increase in gas removal from electrochemical solutions; increase in electrode cleanliness and hence electrode surface activation; lowerering in electrode overpotentials (due to metal depassivation and gas bubble removal generated at the electrode surface induced by cavitation and acoustic streaming); and suppression in electrode fouling (depending on the ultrasonic frequency and power).|$|E

40|$|Electrodeposited {{amorphous}} alloys {{are extremely}} brittle {{as compared to}} the analogous material prepared by rapid so-lidification. The effect of hydrogen on the ductility of electrodeposited Ni-P amorphous alloys has been quantified. Two forms of hydrogen were indicated, atomic and molecular. Atomic hydrogen within the alloy possibly forms a hydride. Un-like the melt-quenched material, a significant amount of hydrogen (in molecular form) was identified within the lectrode-posited material; however, tensile tests and low-temperature vacuum annealing indicate that either type of hydrogen has little effect on the ductility.
