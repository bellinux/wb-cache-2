He later speaks to Lori (Sarah Wayne Callies) about Shane's erratic behavior, his {{suspicion}} that Shane had killed Otis to escape a walker horde, and his fear Shane may kill someone else soon. As Beth's condition worsen, Lori asks Daryl (Norman Reedus) to drive into town to check on Rick, but Daryl refuses, saying his days of searching for someone are over. Lori opts to go alone, but en route, her car hits a walker and is overturned.|$|E
25|$|In March 1983, {{under two}} years before EastEnders first episode was broadcast, the show was a vague idea {{in the mind of}} a handful of BBC executives, who decided that what BBC1 needed was a popular {{bi-weekly}} drama series that would attract the kind of mass audiences that ITV was getting with Coronation Street. The first people to whom David Reid, then head of series and serials, turned were Julia Smith and Tony Holland, a well established producer/script editor team who had first worked together on Z-Cars. The outline that Reid presented was vague: two episodes a week, 52 weeks a year. After the concept was put to them on 14 March 1983, Smith and Holland then went about putting their ideas down on paper; they decided it would be set in the East End of London. Granada Television gave Smith unrestricted access to the Coronation Street production for a month so that she could <b>get</b> <b>a</b> <b>sense</b> how a continuing drama was produced.|$|E
25|$|Rowe and Koetter were not, however, championing collage in the {{pictorial}} sense, much less seeking {{the types of}} disruptions of meaning that occur with collage. Instead, they were looking to challenge the uniformity of Modernism and saw collage with its non-linear notion of history {{as a means to}} reinvigorate design practice. Not only does historical urban fabric have its place, but in studying it, designers were, so it was hoped, able to <b>get</b> <b>a</b> <b>sense</b> of how better to operate. Rowe {{was a member of the}} so-called Texas Rangers, a group of architects who taught at the University of Texas for a while. Another member of that group was Bernhard Hoesli, a Swiss architect who went on to become an important educator at the ETH-Zurirch. Whereas for Rowe, collage was more a metaphor than an actual practice, Hoesli actively made collages as part of his design process. He was close to Robert Slutzky, a New York-based artist, and frequently introduced the question of collage and disruption in his studio work.|$|E

25|$|The {{data for}} an {{earthquake}} is plotted using a lower-hemisphere stereographic projection. The azimuth and take-off angle {{are used to}} plot the position of an individual seismic record. The take-off angle is the angle from the vertical of a seismic ray as it emerges from the earthquake focus. These angles are calculated from a standard set of tables that describe {{the relationship between the}} take-off angle and the distance between the focus and the observing station. By convention, filled symbols are used to plot data from stations where the P-wave first motion recorded was up (a compressive wave), hollow symbols for down (a tensional wave), with dots for stations with arrivals too weak to <b>get</b> <b>a</b> <b>sense</b> of motion. If there are sufficient observations, one may draw two well-constrained orthogonal great circles that divide the compressive from the tensional observations and these are the nodal planes. Observations from stations with no clear first motion normally lie close to these planes. By convention the compressional quadrants are colour-filled and the tensional left white. The two nodal planes intersect at the N (neutral)-axis. The P and T axes are also often plotted; with the N axis these three directions respectively match the directions of the maximum, minimum and intermediate principal compressive stresses associated with the earthquake. The P-axis is plotted in the centre of the white segment, the T-axis in the centre of the colour-filled segment.|$|E

Marvin V.

Wintory was first shown concept art for the project by Nava before Giant Squid Studios was founded and development began. When the studio was founded, Wintory was invited on board the project.

Also in 2003, Zeta-Jones starred alongside George Clooney in the Coen Brothers black comedy Intolerable Cruelty.

Beginning with Batman #251's [...] "The Joker's Five-Way Revenge", the character {{returns to his}} roots as an impulsive, homicidal maniac who matches wits with Batman. This story began a trend in which the Joker was used, sparingly, as a central character. O'Neil said his idea was [...] "simply {{to take it back}} to where it started. I went to the DC library and read some of the early stories. I tried to <b>get</b> <b>a</b> <b>sense</b> of what Kane and Finger were after." [...] O'Neil's 1973 run introduced the idea of the Joker being legally insane, to explain why the character is sent to Arkham Asylum (introduced by O'Neil in 1974 as Arkham Hospital) instead of to prison. Adams modified the Joker's appearance, changing his more average figure by extending his jaw and making him taller and leaner.|$|E
