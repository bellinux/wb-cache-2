A short distance upstream of the Watres Reservoir, the most common genera taxa were the family Chironomidae and the genera Drunella, Ephemerella, and Hydropsyche. Of a 200-individual sample, 34, 28, 25, and 20 <b>individuals</b> <b>of</b> each taxon have been observed, respectively.

40|$|In 1969, Parberry [1] posed and solved an {{interesting}} problem in population growth {{analogous to the}} rabbit problem considered by Fibonacci. In this note we describe how one might treat a generalization of these problems. First, we state the problems of Fibonacci and Parberry and note {{what they have in}} common. The situation considered by Fibonacci involves two types of rabbit which will be denoted B and F (for baby and female, respectively). Starting with one <b>individual</b> <b>of</b> type B, a sequence of generations of rabbits is formed as follows: Each <b>individual</b> <b>of</b> type B in the n th generation matures to become an <b>individual</b> <b>of</b> type Fin the (n + 1) st generation. Also, each <b>individual</b> <b>of</b> type F in the n th generation gives birth to an <b>individual</b> <b>of</b> type B in the (n + l) st generation, and survives to become an <b>individual</b> <b>of</b> type F in the (n + l) st generation.

5|$|In {{addition}} {{to the use of}} sound for communication, a wide range of insects have evolved chemical means for communication. These chemicals, termed semiochemicals, are often derived from plant metabolites include those meant to attract, repel and provide other kinds of information. Pheromones, a type of semiochemical, are used for attracting mates of the opposite sex, for aggregating conspecific <b>individuals</b> <b>of</b> both sexes, for deterring other individuals from approaching, to mark a trail, and to trigger aggression in nearby individuals. Allomonea benefit their producer by the effect they have upon the receiver. Kairomones benefit their receiver instead of their producer. Synomones benefit the producer and the receiver. While some chemicals are targeted at <b>individuals</b> <b>of</b> the same species, others are used for communication across species. The use of scents is especially well known to have developed in social insects.|$|E
5|$|In {{ordinary}} circumstances, transduction, conjugation, {{and transformation}} involve transfer of DNA between individual bacteria {{of the same}} species, but occasionally transfer may occur between <b>individuals</b> <b>of</b> different bacterial species and this may have significant consequences, such as the transfer of antibiotic resistance. In such cases, gene acquisition from other bacteria or the environment is called horizontal gene transfer and may be common under natural conditions. Gene transfer is particularly important in antibiotic resistance as it allows the rapid transfer of resistance genes between different pathogens.|$|E
