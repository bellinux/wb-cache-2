5000|$|The initial gaiben law, {{effective}} in 1987, allowed foreign lawyers with requisite work experience to practice foreign law in Japan, but prohibited employment of, or partnership with, Japanese attorneys, and also prohibited {{the use of}} any firm name other than the foreign lawyer's own name. A revised law enacted in 1994 made it possible to establish <b>fee-sharing</b> (but not profit-sharing) [...] "joint enterprises" [...] between gaiben and local lawyers. Further revisions in 2003 removed the prohibitions on employment of Japanese attorneys and allowed profit-sharing joint ventures between foreign and Japanese attorneys.|$|E
5000|$|... ===Proof-of-importance=== POI is the {{algorithm}} used in NEM to time stamp transactions. A NEM user's importance {{is determined by}} how many coins they have {{and the number of}} transactions made to and from their wallet. POI uses the NCDawareRank network centrality measure, the topology of the transaction graph, {{as well as a number}} of other relevant signals to achieve consensus. POI is different from other initiatives which use a <b>fee-sharing</b> model that does not take into consideration one's overall support of the network. In proof-of-stake systems a person needs to have large amounts of coins to form a block, but in NEM transactions volume and trust become factors. This was designed to encourage users of NEM to not simply hold XEM but instead actively carry out transactions.|$|E
50|$|Pursuant to {{the revised}} {{reorganization}} plan {{approved by the}} bankruptcy court in 1989, United States Lines Inc. was restructured as Janus Industries Inc. in November, 1990, with its shares distributed to United States Lines creditors and the court-managed bankruptcy trust fund. The company's new management spent several years searching for new business opportunities, finally acquiring Pre-Tek Wireline Service Company, a provider of services to the oil, gas, and logging industries in 1996. In 1997, Janus acquired a number of hospitality assets from companies affiliated with the investors Louis S. Beck and Harry Yeaggy, gaining ownership of 6 hotels, an 85% interest in a 7th hotel, a management company operating another 21 hotels, a <b>fee-sharing</b> joint venture with another management company on another property, and control of two mortgaged-backed loans. Beck and Yeaggy gained control of 43% of Janus Industries, and the former United States Lines decided to concentrate exclusively on the hotel business. Pre-Tek Wireline was spun off to its management in 1998 and Janus Industries changed its name again to Janus Hotels & Resorts Inc. in 1999.|$|E
40|$|Session 4 : Contract Theory 2 When a {{principal}} hires an agent {{to create a}} result, {{she would like to}} motivate the agent to pay effort to increase the probability of a good fit with her own characteristics. However, an outcome that does not fit this principal may fit another, so her agent might have an incentive to divert a result to another principal through that principal's contracted agent. This is commonly achieved in practice through a <b>fee-sharing</b> arrangement among the agents. This paper studies how such result-diverting and <b>fee-sharing</b> arrangement affect the agents' incentive to exert efforts and the principals' incentive when offering contracts. We show that, under <b>fee-sharing</b> arrangement, a contract signed between {{a principal}} and her agent is able to influence the future transfers among the agents when they bargain, so each principal has incentive to lower her commission (the reward for a good _t) to reduce the outflows of surplus to other principals. Also, the ability of the commission to motivate effort in an agent decreases when <b>fee-sharing</b> is allowed. These two effects together lower the equilibrium effort levels compared to the benchmarks where <b>fee-sharing</b> is not possible. As a result, efficiency is improved as the agents' efforts would have been wastefully high in the absence of <b>fee-sharing.</b> postprin...|$|E

40|$|If {{the legal}} {{profession}} embraces multidisciplinary practice (MDP) and allows <b>fee-sharing</b> with nonlawyers, {{there is a risk}} that its values, independence, and professionalism will fall prey to market pressures and control by outsiders. On the other hand, rejecting MDP means risking losing business to the multidisciplinary firms already established. The question is whether there is a compromise that provides meaningful regulation of lawyers practicing in multidisciplinary firms...|$|E

30|$|At {{the level}} of wider {{wildlife}} and tourism policy, recent years have witnessed a perverse trend towards increasing restrictions {{on the ability of}} local communities, such as pastoralists living adjacent to Tarangire and SNPs, to capture revenue directly from concessionary agreements with private tourism operators. In 2007, the government introduced new regulations for <b>fee-sharing</b> systems for tourism occurring on community lands, effectively taxing these agreements at a punitive level in excess of 50 %, thus greatly reducing revenues that communities receive from such arrangements (Snyder et al. 2011).|$|E
40|$|When a {{principal}} hires an agent to do searching, {{she needs to}} motivate the agent to pay effort {{as well as to}} deliver a suitable result. Since different principals have different taste and the suitability of the search result is not entirely determined by the agents ’ effort, there is an opportunity for agents to cooperate among themselves and use commission sharing to match search results to principals. This paper studies how such <b>fee-sharing</b> arrangement affects the agents ’ incentive when exerting effort and principals ’ incentive when offering contracts. I show that principals would offer contracts with lower piece-rates and the agents would exert lower effort in searching when such arrangement is possible. However, efficiency may increase because the search results would be better matched to the principals. ...|$|E
40|$|Multidisciplinary {{practice}} (MDP) and {{the controversy}} surrounding it have ebbed {{in the wake of}} the Enron scandal and the subsequent enactment of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act. However, legal professionals continue to debate the viability of MDP and rules that currently prohibit lawyer <b>fee-sharing</b> arrangements and partnerships with non-lawyers-some of the rules that aim to safeguard lawyer independence from external influences. This Article addresses one of the most common arguments supporting MDP, namely, that the pervasive propagation of MDP in Europe will inevitably exert an overwhelming influence and pressure to conform on regulators of the legal profession in the United States. The Article challenges this position by presenting a nuanced vista of the European Union 2 ̆ 7 s regulatory terrain- a terrain in which MDP, though accepted domestically in some European Union member states, is far from being a dominant or prevalent trend. This proposition is especially true at the EU 2 ̆ 7 s institutional level, where even pre-Enron developments evinced reticence towards MDP. Toward that end, the Article analyzes EU legislation and key decisions of the European Court of Justice in the legal services area, as well as selected decisions of member states 2 ̆ 7 courts, indicating how those decisions reinforce the principle of lawyer independence that lies at the root of the United States 2 ̆ 7 prohibition of MDP...|$|E
