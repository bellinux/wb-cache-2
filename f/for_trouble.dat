Among twenty-plus incidents, a man was knocked down and beaten near the Big Four Bridge, and a large group ransacked a convenience store on South First Street. Although LMPD had deployed extra officers due to the potential <b>for</b> <b>trouble</b> after the death of a juvenile stabbed on a TARC bus several days earlier, the officers were based along West Broadway, away from where the mob attack took place. In the days following the mob incident, residents criticized LMPD for their response. The Downtown Area Patrol was established {{as a result of the}} attack and outcry, and led the Louisville and Jeffersonville, Indiana police departments to develop strategies to combat issues at the Big Four Bridge, which connects the two cities via a walking path.

500|$|After days {{of media}} speculation, it was {{confirmed}} on September 6, 2007, that Spears {{would open the}} 2007 MTV Video Music Awards at the Pearl Theatre in the Palms Hotel and Casino in Las Vegas, Nevada, on September 9, 2007. It was also announced {{that she was going}} to perform [...] "Gimme More", with a magic act from illusionist Criss Angel in some parts of the performance. However, the bit is thought to have been rejected by the show's organizers at the last minute. The executive producer of the 2007 VMAs Jesse Ignjatovic contacted Spears since she wanted to start the show in [...] "a very big and dramatic way", and was confident that Spears would deliver and set the tone for the rest of the night. She also said Spears was excited after she was approached by MTV to perform. On September 7, 2007, Spears started rehearsing at the Pearl Theater. An exclusive video from the rehearsal was posted on MTV.com the following day. The performance began with a close-up of the back of Spears's head, and continued with Spears turning to the camera and lip synching the first lines of Elvis Presley's 1958 song [...] "Trouble": [...] "If you're lookin' <b>for</b> <b>trouble,</b> you came to the right place / If you're lookin' <b>for</b> <b>trouble,</b> look right in my face." [...] "Gimme More" [...] began, and the camera panned out to reveal Spears wearing a black, jewel-encrusted bikini and black boots. She was accompanied by male and female dancers dressed in black outfits. Several pole dancers danced in smaller stages around the audience. The backdrop videos featured images of chandeliers floating and silhouettes of women, which were compared by Gil Kaufman of MTV to the gun barrel and title sequence of the James Bond series. At the end of the performance, Spears smiled and thanked the audience before leaving the stage.|$|E
500|$|In 1934, Mitchell and {{the design}} staff decided to use a semi-elliptical wing shape to solve two {{conflicting}} requirements. The wing needed to be thin, to avoid creating too much drag, while still able to house a retractable undercarriage, plus armament and ammunition. An elliptical planform is the most efficient aerodynamic shape for an untwisted wing, leading to the lowest amount of induced drag. The ellipse was skewed so that the centre of pressure, which occurs at the quarter-chord position, aligned with the main spar, thus preventing the wings from twisting. Mitchell has sometimes been accused of copying the wing shape of the Heinkel He 70, which first flew in 1932; but as Beverley Shenstone, the aerodynamicist on Mitchell's team, explained: [...] "Our wing was much thinner and had quite a different section {{to that of the}} Heinkel. In any case it would have been simply asking <b>for</b> <b>trouble</b> to have copied a wing shape from an aircraft designed for an entirely different purpose." ...|$|E

On 24 October 2011 it was announced that the pair were to leave the show.

After he and Jodie kissed, Lapinskas revealed that Jodie would be angry with herself for betraying Poppy. An Inside Soap writer predicted that Anthony was heading <b>for</b> <b>trouble,</b> and that he was [...] "playing with fire" [...] by kissing both Poppy and Jodie.
