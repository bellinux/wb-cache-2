Litter size was 1. 4 kids. Doe age and weight influenced litter size between seasons. Featal kid mortality rate was 12 %, rose to 32 % during the neonatal life. Overall kid mortality rate was 50 %. Type of birth, sex, birth weight, doe age and season influenced kid mortality. Overall birth weight was 2. 2 ± 0. 19 kg. Type of birth, sex, doe age, <b>doe</b> <b>weight</b> and season of kidding had significant effect on kid’s birth weight. The overall body gain was 1. 6 kg/month.

Does on CL 2, CL 3 and CL 4 had 28 % higher feed intake than those on CL 1 during the premating phase. Feed intake {{in the first week}} of pregnancy, was 7 % higher on CL 3 than on CL 2 and CL 4 which had 10 % higher intake than CL 1. Feed intake was similar for all treatments in the second, third and fourth weeks of pregnancy and during lactation. Does gained weight in the first, second and third weeks of pregnancy for all the treatments. In the fourth week however, does on CL 2, CL 3 and CL 4 lost weight. All the does lost weight during lactation. Feed conversion showed marked variation during pregnancy and lactation. Feed conversion was negative for all the treatments especially in the first and third weeks of lactation. Gestation length decreased with increase in concentrate level from CL 1 to CL 3.

40|$|This {{study was}} {{conducted}} to assess the effect of breed, season, age and weight of doe at mating on reproductive performance of 4 broiler rabbit breeds, Grey Giant, White Giant, Soviet Chinchilla, and New Zealand White, reared under standard management practices in sub-temperate climatic conditions of India. They were first mated at 6 to 7 mo of age, whereupon an extensive breeding system (re-mating after weaning) was followed. Weaning was done 42 d after kindling. The data from the records on reproduction consisting of 503 matings and 377 kindlings were analysed. The parameters considered were fertility rate, litter size at birth (LSB), litter weight at birth (LWB), litter size at weaning (LSW), litter weight at weaning (LWW), <b>doe</b> <b>weight</b> at mating (DWM), gestation length and sex ratio. Among 4 breeds, the LSB, LWB and LSW were higher in Grey Giant followed by White Giant, Soviet Chinchilla and New Zealand White. The LSB and LSW in Grey Giant breed differed significantly (P< 0. 05) from Soviet Chinchilla and New Zealand White. Season had significant (P< 0. 05) effect on LSW with higher values during spring (5. 68 ± 0. 24), followed by summer (5. 29 ± 0. 30), winter (5. 13 ± 0. 25) and autumn (4. 17 ± 0. 49). The body weight of doe at service significantly influenced fertility. The fertility increased as body weight increased. The age of the doe at mating had a significant effect on LSW, with higher values for does more than 2 yr and less than 1 yr old compared to 1 - to 2 -yr old does. The parity did not affect any of the parameters studied. It is concluded that the factors studied affect the reproductive performance of rabbit does.

40|$|The aim of {{this study}} was to compare 3 Spanish {{maternal}} rabbit lines (A, V and LP) in terms of milk production and composition. These lines were founded on different criteria but selected for litter size at weaning. A total of 194 mature does in their third or higher parity were used. The milk yield of does was recorded at 1, 2, 3, 4, 8, 9, 10, 11, 15, 16 and 17 d post-partum (dpp). The milk production traits studied were weekly milk yield (WMY; g/wk) and milk conversion ratio (MCR; grams of litter gain per grams of milk suckled during the first 21  dpp). The milk composition traits studied were fat (%), protein  (%), ash (%), lactose (%) and total solids (%). The milk samples to be analysed were collected from each doe at 18 dpp. Data were analysed using single trait mixed and fixed models with and without covariates; the covariates were number born alive (NBA) and <b>doe</b> <b>weight</b> at kindling (DW). The overall mean of WMY, during the first 3 wk, was 1547 ± 16 g/wk. Milk yields during the different lactation weeks were for line A 872 ± 39, 1503 ± 39 and 1865 ± 39 g for first, second and third lactation weeks, respectively. In line V, the corresponding values were 919 ± 35, 1633 ± 35 and 2004 ± 35  g, and in line LP, they were 1043 ± 36, 1819 ± 36 and 2254 ± 36  g. Means of MCR were 0. 41 ± 0. 01, 0. 41 ± 0. 01 and 0. 42 ± 0. 01 for A, V and LP lines, respectively.

40|$|This thesis {{presents}} {{three areas}} of emphasis, all related to feeds, feeding {{and performance of}} small ruminants. The first area (Paper I) focuses on seasonality {{and its effect on}} chemical composition of forage species most preferred by SEA goats, grazing behaviour and performance of goats as assessed in the rainy (February-May), mid dry (July-August) and late dry seasons (October-November). Evaluation of these forages showed a marked decline in quality as the season changed from rainy to dry. The crude protein (CP) and energy content of all forages decreased while the neutral detergent fibre content increased. The decline in feed quality varied with forage class. Unlike forbs and browses, the mean CP of grasses, for example, declined below the critical maintenance level for goats {{from the end of the}} rainy season through late dry season. Mineral concentrations varied among species and forage classes and were all low in phosphorous level. Changes in season were clearly associated with shifts in diet selection, grazing and non grazing activities. Whereas herbaceous vegetation was the main diet in the rainy season, browses and forbs were important dietary sources in the dry season. Observation on grazing activities and performance of goats in the same study showed that the proportion of time allocated for various activities varied with the changing season. For example, feeding time changed from 0. 57 (57 %) in the rainy season to 0. 68 (68 %) in the late dry season. Body weight gains and condition scores were highest in the middle of the dry season while the least performance of these variables was recorded late in the dry season. The second area of this work (Paper II) presents an investigation of the influence of pre-mating dietary supplementation and the season of kidding on reproductive characteristics of SEA goats and growth performance of their off springs. The seasons were either early dry (season 1) or late dry (season 2). Results from three groups of 30 does each subjected to 0, 200 or 400 g of concentrate diet/doe/day for a period of 60 days prior to mating showed that pre-mating dietary supplementation improved (P< 0. 05) weight gains but the reproductive performance was not improved. <b>Doe</b> <b>weight</b> changes and growth rates of kids were affected by the season of kidding. Body weight changes of does, pre-weaning growth and weight of kid weaned per kg doe kidding and the weight of kid weaned per doe kidding were higher for kidding taking place in season 1 compared with that in season 2. Results suggest that production efficiency of goats can be increased by restricting goat breeding activities in January-March for kidding to take place early in the dry season (June-August). The third area (Papers III, IV and V) focused on growth performance, carcass yield and meat quality characteristics of small ruminants when supplemented with concentrate diets with either hay and/or treated straws as basal diets. In Papers III and IV, 32 sheep and goats were subjected to either ad libitum untreated wheat straw (UTS), wheat straw treated with urea and lime (TS), straw and ad libitum hay (UTSH) or TS and ad libitum hay (TSH). In addition, each animal received 220 g of concentrate diet/day (on as fed basis) for 84 days. Treatment of straw increased (P 0. 05). On the other hand, goat meat had slightly higher pH both at 45 min PM and 24 h PM than sheep meat. Post-mortem ageing of sheep meat improved (P 0. 05) on tenderness. Overall, results showed potential for increased productivity in small ruminants through improved nutrition and proper timing of mating periods. Where characteristics of meat quality were assessed, there were limited effects of dietary treatments on such characteristics...|$|E

40|$|Farmers report low Angora kid {{birth weight}} {{associated}} with high kid mortality. As breeding goats are likely to face energy restrictions during winter when pregnant this study investigated the effects of energy intake during mid pregnancy on Angora kidding losses, birth weight, placenta weight and productivity of does. The design was three levels of mid pregnancy nutrition (MPN) with live weight (mean ± sd, 34. 6 ± 3. 1 kg) and parity blocks. Following artificial insemination and pregnancy scanning 102 does, including 24 twin bearing does, were fed pelleted rations in individual pens in an outdoor feedlot from day 47 of pregnancy until kidding. MPN treatments were: Control, live weight loses of 2. 5 kg; Maintenance, maintenance of live weight; Supplemented, moderate live weight gains. From days 105 of pregnancy until 4 days postpartum the feeding was ad libitum. Feed and energy intake, live weight, body condition score and mohair production were measured. The pattern of live weight change followed the ME intake pattern. ME intake of Control does declined to 0. 5 – 0. 6 maintenance and they lost 67 g/d. Supplemented does intake increased to near 2 × maintenance and gained 102 g/d. The maintenance ME requirement of does in mid pregnancy was determined as 384 ± 19. 7 kJ/kg 0. 75 /d. Following removal of energy restrictions, from day 117 to kidding Control does consumed more ME than Maintenance and Supplemented treatments. During the last 4 weeks of pregnancy ME intake for all treatments increased from 2 × maintenance to at least 2. 5 × maintenance. In the last trimester does were able to substantially but not fully compensate for live weight losses or penalties induced {{as a consequence of}} energy restrictions during the middle trimester. Does gained body condition in mid or late pregnancy provided energy provision was sufficient and close to ad libitum feeding. Control does had 15 % greater foetal losses prior to kidding compared with other treatments. Kid losses at birth and in the first 24 h did not differ between treatments. As a consequence of compensatory gain in late pregnancy {{there was no significant difference}} in kid birth weight between treatments. MPN did not affect placenta weight although placenta weight was positively associated with kid birth weight. However, heavier does in late pregnancy produced heavier kids once allowance was made for differences in birth parity and kid sex. There were small significant effects of MPN on mohair production and diameter. The findings indicate that Angora producers should minimise <b>doe</b> live <b>weight</b> loss during mid pregnancy to avoid foetal losses, feed does well during the last trimester to optimize <b>doe</b> live <b>weight</b> and kid birth weight and provide the best care possible during kidding to optimize kid survival...|$|R

Besides that, process parameters were investigated by using experimental design of experiment (DOE) and statistical analysis. The chlorination of the samples was carried out at temperatures between 400 to 500 °C. Effects of three parameters, namely temperature, soaking time, and molar ratio of potassium permanganate (KMnO 4) to hydrochloric acid (HCl) were investigated. The interaction, on the rate of chlorination of TiC were statistically evaluated by using <b>DOE.</b> The <b>weight</b> loss (wt. %) was the main response taken into account in this paper. The results of the experimental design indicated that the main significant factor for chlorination of TiC was higher temperature, soaking time and higher molar ratio of KMnO 4 to HCl. DOE results have demonstrated that the highest extent of chlorination obtained at the highest weight loss (wt. %) was about 54. 59 wt. % at 500 °C with a soaking time of 180 minutes and KMnO 4 to HCl molar ratio of 0. 17 respectively.

Two isonutritive diets were formulated corresponding to 2 levels of Toyocerin®: 0 (diet T 1) and 200 mg (diet T 2) of Toyocerin®/ kg of feed. Two experiments {{were conducted to}} evaluate the {{efficacy of}} Toyocerin ® on rabbit doe performance in two different experimental periods of twelve and six months, respectively. Thirty-eight breeding cages were assigned to each treatment. No interaction was found between dietary treatment and experimental period. As a consequence, {{the results of the}} two trials were treated as a whole. Inclusion of Toyocerin ® shortened interval from parturition to effective mating (15. 0 vs 10. 4 d, P = 0. 05) and between parturitions (47. 0 vs 42. 2 d, P = 0. 05) and tended to improve litter size at weaning (by 9. 9 %, P = 0. 09). Consequently, numerical productivity increased from 59. 6 to 71. 2 weaned rabbits per cage and year (P = 0. 01). Litter weight at weaning (25 d) also tended to be higher for diet supplemented with Toyocerin ® (3673 vs 3952 g, P = 0. 10). As treatment had no effect on daily feed intake (370 g as an average) of rabbits does during lactation, feed efficiency (kg of weaned rabbits per kg of feed intake) increased (P = 0. 01) from 0. 272 to 0. 314 with Toyocerin ® supplementation.

Each of the supplementation rations was fed at 1 % and 2 % of the <b>doe's</b> body <b>weight.</b> Ration A had the highest crude protein percentage of 17. 19 % while Rations B and C had 9. 54 and 10. 38 %, respectively. The naturally grazed pastures and Digitaria smutsii hay (Ration D) contained the least protein: 2. 76 and 4. 75 %, respectively. Ration D also had the highest percentages of acid detergent fiber, neutral detergent fiber and lignin (49. 14, 74. 73 and 9. 49 % in hay and 50. 29, 8. 27 and 11. 5 % in grazed pastures, respectively). Ration A on the other hand, had the lowest percentages of acid detergent fiber (20. 00 %), neutral detergent fiber (40. 01 %) and lignin (4. 64 %). The results indicated that the supplemented group of does had significantly higher (P < 0. 05) dry matter and crude protein intakes as well as nutrient digestibilities than the unsupplemented groups. A comparison of the unsupplemented animals with all the other treatment groups revealed that dry matter digestibility improved by a range of 4. 1 – 27. 9 %, while crude protein digestibility improved by 17. 1 – 42. 2 %, the highest value being in does on Ration A. It was concluded that goats were able to subsist and make appreciable gains in the long dry season on crop-based diets that compared favorably with the conventional concentrate rations. Of the two tested crop residue based rations, Ration C is a better supplementation package than Ration B...|$|R
40|$|The {{effects of}} the {{combined}} use of long lactation periods (46 days) with alternative cages on the reproductive and growth performance of 104 rabbit does and their litters during five consecutive reproductive cycles were studied. Half of does were housed in conventional polyvalent cages (39 cm× 100 cm× 30 cm) {{and the other half}} in alternative polyvalent cages (39 cm× 100 cm× 60 cm), with a raised platform. Half of the rabbit does in each type of cage were weaned at 32 and the other half at 46 days after parturition. Longer lactation negatively affected the body weight (P< 0. 001), fat and energy content (P< 0. 05) of rabbit does {{at the end of the}} lactation period, but this effect decreased with the number of parturitions. Fertility, prolificacy and doe mortality were not affected by lactation length. Late weaning led to higher litter size (by 8. 9 %) and litter weight (by 11. 3 %) at the end of growing period (P< 0. 001) and lower feed conversion ratio per cage during the experimental period (13. 5 %) than weaning at 32 day (P< 0. 001). These results were paralleled by lower mortality (12. 6 vs. 17. 6 %; P< 0. 01) of young rabbits weaned later during the overall experimental period. Differences in performance as a result of different weaning ages were only observed during cycles with worst health status (third and fifth cycles) in which late weaning decreased mortality. Type of cage did not affect <b>doe</b> body <b>weight</b> and body condition, mortality, fertility, prolificacy and litter size during the five reproductive cycles. Nevertheless, at day 21 litter weight and feed conversion ratio between 3 and 21 day were 4. 2 % higher (P< 0. 01) and 5. 0 % lower (P< 0. 05), respectively, in animals housed in alternative rather than in conventional cages. Alternative cages also led to heavier litters at 59 days (P< 0. 01). It was concluded that the combined use of longer lactations and cages with higher available surface with a raised platform could be alternatives to improve animal welfare in farmed rabbit...|$|R
40|$|Objective: To {{investigate}} {{the effects of}} live weight, sex and other factors on deciduous (first incisor) loss and permanent first incisor development in Angora goats. Design: Goats {{were part of a}} pen study on the effects of energy intake in Angora does during pregnancy and lactation on kid growth and development. The design was three levels of nutrition in mid-pregnancy Ã— two levels of postnatal nutrition in 17 randomised blocks. Methods: Conception times were calculated by using artificial insemination, with ultrasound examination 43 days after insemination. Does were fed different amounts of a formulated diet in their pens. After weaning, goats were grazed in sex groups. Deciduous first incisor loss and permanent first incisor development were recorded at 11 time points from 14 to 20 months of age. Results: For each sex, the time for visible eruption and full development of permanent first incisor declined linearly with increased live weight by 5. 9 and 5. 4 days/kg live weight, respectively. The time to reach similar development stages for first permanent incisors eruption was 3 months longer for the lightest animals compared with the heaviest animals. Date of birth, birth <b>weight,</b> <b>doe</b> age, growth rates, mid-pregnancy and postnatal nutrition, parity, day of weaning and weaning weight had no detectable effect. Conclusions: The results explain much of the substantial range in reported first permanent incisor eruption dates for small ruminants and have application in ageing of goats, marketing of kids for meat, in the selection of animals for breeding flocks and in educational material. <br /...|$|R
40|$|The use of {{aluminum}} in automotive applications is expanding. Aluminum offers a lower-weight alternative to steel, potentially increasing {{the efficiency of}} vehicles. However, the application {{of aluminum}} has been only in select areas of use, most notably cast aluminum in the engine, transmission, and wheels. Other areas offer the potential for growth that could significantly expand the amount of aluminum used in vehicles. Cost is the main barrier to increased aluminum use. Related to cost are aluminum production technologies that are not yet advanced enough to produce aluminum components at low enough price points for aluminum to compete with traditional automotive materials. Today's technologies require higher-priced alloys {{to be used for}} the components (e. g., closure panels), or have higher costs for needed processes (e. g., welding). In addition, new designs (e. g., spaceframes) are not well established for widespread use. R&D efforts are continuing to close these gaps. The U. S. Department of Energy (DOE) is helping to fund certain R&D projects that could provide breakthroughs in lowering costs for aluminum. This paper describes the current state of aluminum applications in vehicles, including its market penetration and opportunities. It also examines the cost structure of aluminum [...] from mining to final component use. By examining these factors, an evaluation of whether current aluminum technology is mature enough for specific applications is made. Each major aluminum processing step is then reviewed to identify major cost or technology barriers as well as R&D needed to respond to those barriers. For each step, the report provides a discussion of DOE's programmatic role in reducing cost and technological barriers and <b>DOE's</b> Light <b>Weight</b> Materials program support for the overall R&D needs in the industry. The evaluation embodied in this report finds that aluminum has successfully penetrated the automotive market, largely (> 75 %) in the form of castings. Aluminum sheet of the proper alloy is still too expensive to penetrate significantly except for components where lower weight has extra value (e. g., large hoods or deck lids). The cost of auto body sheet averages above $ 1. 30 /lb, 30 % above what the auto industry has said is required for economic competitiveness. Further research is needed to either lower the cost of the alloys currently used for body sheet, or to develop methods to use less expensive alloys. Joining technologies need to be improved to lower their cost while improving quality. Extruded components have potential but will make the most significant contribution if spaceframe designs are developed for high-volume automobile markets. Aluminum has the potential to significantly reduce the weight of vehicles, improving fuel efficiency while maintaining other desirable attributes. Federally funded research contributes to this goal...|$|R
40|$|Recent {{advances}} {{in the area of}} Metal Matrix Composites (MMC's) have brought these materials to a maturity stage where the technology is ready for transition to large-volume production and commercialization. The new materials seem to allow the fabrication of higher quality parts at less than 50 percent of the weight as compared to steel, especially when they are selectively reinforced with carbon, silicon carbide, or aluminum oxide fibers. Most of the developments in the MMC materials have been spurred, mainly by applications that require high structural performance at elevated temperatures, the heavy vehicle industry could also benefit from this emerging technology. Increasing requirements of weight savings and extended durability are the main drivers for potential insertion of MMC technology into the heavy vehicle market. Critical elements of a typical tractor-trailer combination, such as highly loaded sections of the structure, engine components, brakes, suspensions, joints and bearings could be improved through judicious use of MMC materials. Such an outcome would promote the DOE's programmatic objectives of increasing the fuel efficiency of heavy vehicles and reducing their life cycle costs and pollution levels. However, significant technical and economical barriers are likely to hinder or even prevent broad applications of MMC materials in heavy vehicles. The tradeoffs between such expected benefits (lower weights and longer durability) and penalties (higher costs, brittle behavior, and difficult to machine) must be thoroughly investigated both from the performance and cost viewpoints, before the transfer of MMC technology to heavy vehicle systems can be properly assessed and implemented. MMC materials are considered to form one element of the comprehensive, multi-faceted strategy pursued by the High Strength/Weight Reduction (HS/WR) Materials program of the U. S. Department of Energy (<b>DOE)</b> for structural <b>weight</b> savings and quality enhancements in heavy vehicles. The research work planed for the first year of this project (June 1, 2003 through May 30, 2004) focused on a theoretical investigation of weight benefits and structural performance tradeoffs associated with the design, fabrication, and joining of MMC components for heavy-duty vehicles. This early research work conducted at West Virginia University yielded the development of integrated material-structural models that predicted marginal benefits and significant barriers to MMC applications in heavy trailers. The results also indicated that potential applications of MMC materials in heavy vehicles are limited to components identified as critical for either loadings or weight savings. Therefore, the scope of the project was expanded in the following year (June 1, 2004 through May 30, 2005) focused on expanding the lightweight material-structural design concepts for heavy vehicles from the component to the system level. Thus, the following objectives were set: (1) Devise and evaluate lightweight structural configurations for heavy vehicles. (2) Study the feasibility of using Metal Matrix Composites (MMC) for critical structural components and joints in heavy vehicles. (3) Develop analysis tools, methods, and validated test data for comparative assessments of innovative design and joining concepts. (4) Develop analytical models and software for durability predictions of typical heavy vehicle components made of particulate MMC or fiber-reinforced composites.
