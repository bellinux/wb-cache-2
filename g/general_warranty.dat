50|$|In the {{transfer}} of real estate, a deed conveys ownership from the old owner (the grantor) to the new owner (the grantee), and can include various warranties. The precise name and nature of these warranties differ by jurisdiction. Often, however, the basic differences between them {{is the degree to}} which the grantor warrants the title. The grantor may give a <b>general</b> <b>warranty</b> of title against any claims, or the warranty may be limited to only claims which occurred after the grantor obtained the real estate. The latter type of deed is usually known as a special warranty deed. While a <b>general</b> <b>warranty</b> deed was normally used for residential real estate sales and transfers, special warranty deeds are becoming more common and are more commonly used in commercial transactions.|$|E
50|$|A factory LPG {{conversion}} (using an underfloor LPG {{tank and}} a rear-mounted petrol tank) was also available using a converted Ford 8-valve petrol engine with a {{peak power output}} of 115PS. This conversion was popular with police due to the high power output without the running costs of the V8 (explained below). The conversion did however significantly change the 'class-leading' warranty terms, the <b>general</b> <b>warranty</b> being reduced from 150000 miles to 60000 miles.|$|E

40|$|Warranty is an {{important}} part of many organizations. Warranty costs take money directly away from corporations' bottom line. <b>General</b> Motors Corporations <b>warranty</b> liability costs its shareholders upwards of billion dollars annually. General Motors currently uses RedX, a systematic design of experiments methodology, to try to reduce warranty costs. Although this approach has reduced warranty costs, it has not done so neither fast nor sufficiently as high costs remains. The <b>General</b> Motors' <b>warranty</b> system was mapped and diagnosed. Interviews were conducted with all involved parties with the warranty system. Competitors warranty systems were compared and contrast to <b>General</b> Motors' <b>warranty</b> system. Other factors considered were new quality methods. The major factors limiting General Motors goals to reducing warranty are time to discover the failure and the time the fix the failure once it is discovered. Another factor is the culture and the lack of team environment within the <b>warranty</b> organization. <b>General</b> Motors should use telematics, onboard diagnostics, signature analysis, and a systemic approach which involves integrating the design and warranty organizations to predict and quickly eliminate defects from its manufacturing facilities. This approach will either eliminate failures quickly or prevent them from even becoming failures in the first place. by Jelani H. Ellington. Thesis (S. M.)

5000|$|A {{warranty}} deed {{is a type}} of deed where the grantor (seller) guarantees that he or she holds clear title to a piece of real estate and has a right to sell it to the grantee (buyer). This is in contrast to a quitclaim deed, where the seller does not guarantee that he or she holds title to a piece of real estate. A <b>general</b> <b>warranty</b> deed protects the grantee against title defects arising at any point in time, extending back to the property's origins. A special {{warranty deed}} protects the grantee only against title defects arising from the actions or omissions of the grantor.|$|E

5000|$|At {{the time}} of sale, auto dealers may sell car buyers an {{extended}} warranty offered by the manufacturer. When that time period runs out, consumers {{have the option to}} purchase an extended auto warranty from a third-party, which is not an extension of the terms and coverages provided in the original car manufacturer’s warranty, rather it is a new contract provided a third-party provider. According to the Automobile Protection Association (APA), which publishes the Lemon-Aid Car Buyer’s Guides, extended warranties are a good idea if they cover items likely to break down within the warranty period.

An example of a <b>general</b> <b>warranty</b> is the [...] "iron-safe clause," [...] which is frequently included in fire-insurance policies. In terms of an iron-safe clause, the insured warrants that he will keep a complete set of books, showing a true and accurate record of all business transactions and stock-in-hand, and that the books will be locked in a fire-proof safe or removed to another building at night and at all times when the premises are not open for business.

40|$|In Swiss law the buyer's {{remedies}} for {{breach of warranty}} of quality remedies are different in many respects from his other contractual remedies. The aim of this thesis {{is to show that}} it is not a necessity but rather a source of confusion for the Swiss legal system to have special {{remedies for}} breach of <b>warranty.</b> <b>General</b> contract remedies could very effectively and rationally compensate buyers for breaches of quality warranties. To achieve this aim this study starts by analysing the historical reasons for the adoption of special warranty remedies.

40|$|This study {{examined}} the impact that social class status and three variables (Time Orientation, Locus of Control, and Delay of Gratification) known to vary with Social Class have on consumer warranty attitudes and behaviors. Using five social class indicators, this research utilized only the responses of individuals whose social class status had 2 ̆ 2 crystallized 2 ̆ 2 in either the lower social class status category or the middle social class category. This {{study examined}} respondent warranty attitudes and behaviors in general and also regarding specific purchases of three durable products. ^ This research supports previous research that suggests that lower social class individuals {{tend to have a}} short time orientation, a propensity to choose instant gratification over delayed gratification, and an external locus of control; whereas middle social class individuals tend to have a longer time orientation, a propensity to delay gratification, and an internal locus of control. ^ Results show that individuals with an internal Locus of Control {{were more likely to have}} a higher regard for warranties. Individuals with a longer time orientation were more likely to exhibit warranty information seeking behaviors and to purchase extended warranties. Individuals with a greater propensity to delay gratification were more likely to choose the delayed product attribute over the immediate product feature. ^ Regarding social class status, this research found that Social Class was a significant predictor of warranty behaviors, but not of warranty attitudes and perceptions. Individuals of middle social class status were more likely to exhibit <b>general</b> and extended <b>warranty</b> information seeking behaviors. This study did not generate evidence of a Social Class moderator relationship between warranty attitudes and behaviors and the independent variable, Locus of Control. However, findings did suggest that Social Class does moderate the relationship between extended warranty purchase and Time Orientation. Also, a significant interaction was found between Social Class and Delay of Gratification on the choice between a delayed product attribute and an immediate product feature. ^ Few studies of the impact of social class status on consumer behaviors have utilized samples which include lower social class segments and which utilized responses from only individuals whose social class statuses were crystallized. This research accomplished these two sampling objectives, thereby increasing the confidence in its findings regarding social class segments. ^ In view of this study, Social Class might be considered a significant market segmentation variable, providing marketers with a number of related characteristics with which to focus a marketing mix. Further, given the significant social class crystallization observed in this study, identification of a household 2 ̆ 7 s social class status may be more reasonably obtained than often thought. This would increase the feasibility of using social class status as a variable in market research efforts. ...|$|R
40|$|Warranty is {{important}} financially to American manufacturers, especially automotive companies. Carmakers and suppliers must work aggressively {{to improve their}} warranty management approach as warranty cost often equals or exceeds their investment in engineering. This thesis focuses on studying warranty management in a supply chain from a systems perspective. Warranty data in the automotive industry, focused upon a "Tier one" supplier, is analyzed to obtain <b>general</b> <b>warranty</b> trends and typical failure types. Following the data analysis and hypothesis formation, a sequential series of surveys and interviews within the supplier are conducted in attempt to determine {{the root causes of}} warranty failures. A major finding of the study is the lack of a cross-company and long-term approach for dealing with warranty. Other root causes (though not as deeply imbedded as that noted first) include the lack of design discipline, design knowledge, and resources in the product development process. In addition, unclear accountability, poor communication, and lack of a supplier management process delay the warranty resolution process. Furthermore, the culture and mindset in an organization is a critical element in effective warranty management. A reactive warranty firefighting mindset is inadequate to attack the significant warranty issues. Based upon solving the root causes found in the research, the thesis provides five specific recommendations. These recommendations appear likely to be useful {{to a wide variety of}} automotive companies as well as manufacturers in other industries. by Wei Shen and Wangquan (Winston) Cheng. Thesis (S. M.)
