[...] She also spoke about her emotional crisis, saying, [...] "For two or three years <b>I</b> <b>was</b> <b>away</b> from all social interaction.

I have never been so unhappy....I knew I had many enemies; I never was agreeable with them and never will be. My greatest wish would be to fly to the Salon and to confound them with my works, which don't in any way resemble theirs; [...] and the more I advance, the less their work will resemble mine." [...] He vowed never again to exhibit at the Salon, and his refusal to return to Paris led to the breaking up of his engagement.

Why, then, did my mother send me here for? We are in a very desperate situation. I hope you won't hesitate any longer." [...] Kong Rong agreed to let him break out of the siege.|$|E
