5|$|On {{the north}} side of the temple {{courtyard}} is the Manjusri Hall (文殊殿). It was constructed in 1137 during the Jin dynasty and is roughly the same size as the East Hall, also measuring seven bays by four. It is located on an 83cm (2.7ft) <b>high</b> <b>platform,</b> has three front doors and one central back door, and features a single-eave hip gable roof. The interior of the hall has only four support pillars. In order to support the large roof, diagonal beams are used. On each of the four walls are murals of arhats painted in 1429 during the Ming dynasty.|$|E
5|$|The {{committee}} was incensed by the untraditional proposal, but Rodin would not yield. In 1895, Calais succeeded in having Burghers displayed in their preferred form: {{the work was}} {{placed in front of}} a public garden on a <b>high</b> <b>platform,</b> surrounded by a cast-iron railing. Rodin had wanted it located near the town hall, where it would engage the public. Only after damage during the First World War, subsequent storage, and Rodin's death was the sculpture displayed as he had intended. It is one of Rodin's best-known and most acclaimed works.|$|E
5|$|To {{the eastern}} {{transept}} is the Mother-of-Pearl Bed (พระแท่นบรรทมประดับมุก) {{which was made}} to match the Mother-of-Pearl Throne. The bed was once the king's personal bed and was kept inside the Phra Thinang Phiman Rattaya; however once {{it was no longer}} used it was transferred to the Dusit Maha Prasat Throne Hall. The bed {{is in the form of}} a <b>high</b> <b>platform</b> with many layers, and small steps leading to the top. When royal ceremonies are carried out within the throne hall, member of the royal family take their seat in the southern transept, while government officials sit to the north, Buddhist monks to the east; the funeral urn is to the west. During such times the throne and bed were used as altars for Buddha images.|$|E
50|$|With the {{exception}} of Meckenheim station, the line is completely equipped with <b>high</b> <b>platforms.</b> Bonn-Duisdorf station, which {{was reduced to a}} single platform in 1993, was rebuilt between 2003 and 2004 as a two-platform station. The signal equipment was renewed and rebuilt with <b>high</b> <b>platforms.</b>|$|R
50|$|Because {{the light}} rail network {{evolved from the}} tram network instead of {{replacing}} it, there were numerous stations served by both light rail and tram vehicles for almost three decades. While <b>high</b> <b>platforms</b> for stepless entry into light rail vehicles could be built on the outer branches, stations in the city center had to have low platforms to support trams as well. The introduction of low-floor technology in the early 1990s promised wheelchair-accessible entry throughout the network without having to build several hundred <b>high</b> <b>platforms.</b> To allow the introduction of low-floor trains without having to demolish existing <b>high</b> <b>platforms,</b> the network was divided into two sub-networks of different floor heights.|$|R
50|$|In 1952 {{the line}} was {{electrified}} and <b>high</b> <b>platforms</b> were constructed at the same time.|$|R
5|$|In {{the middle}} of 1139, rumours were current that the family was going to defect to Stephen's rival for the throne, the Empress Matilda. These rumours {{appear to have been}} started by a group of nobles led by twin {{brothers}} Waleran de Beaumont, the Count of Meulan, and Robert de Beaumont, the Earl of Leicester, with Alan of Brittany. Whether Roger and his family really intended to switch their support to Matilda is unclear, but unlikely. In late June, a fight broke out between some of the retainers of Alan and men in the service of Roger's family. This fight was the excuse for the king moving against Roger's family. Both the elder and younger Roger were arrested, along with Alexander, but Nigel escaped. Matilda of Ramsbury, who held out in Devizes Castle against the king, was persuaded to surrender the castle to Stephen when the king threatened to hang the younger Roger if she did not yield. The younger Roger was restrained with chains and put on a <b>high</b> <b>platform</b> in view of the castle with a noose around his neck.|$|E
5|$|Some {{time later}} Susan finds David, {{who has just}} been jilted by Alice because of her, on a <b>high</b> <b>platform</b> at his brontosaurus {{reconstruction}} at the museum. After showing him the missing bone which she'd found by trailing George for three days, Susan, against his warnings, climbs a tall ladder next to the dinosaur {{to be closer to}} him. She tells David that her Aunt has given her the million dollars, and she wants to donate it to the museum, but David is more interested in telling her that the day spent with her was the best day of his life. Unconsciously swaying the ladder from side to side upon hearing David's further words of endearment and love, Susan tells him that she loves him too, then notices that the ladder {{is on the verge of}} falling over. Frightened, she climbs onto and over the skeleton, but just before the dinosaur bones collapse David grabs her hand, she dangles below him, and he lifts her onto the platform. Regrettably surveying the wreckage of his work, David soon accepts the destruction and chaos, gives in, and hugs and kisses Susan.|$|E

50|$|Most major {{stations}} on the MBTA Commuter Rail routes {{are accessible}} with full-length <b>high</b> or mini-high <b>platforms,</b> but some stations are not accessible. All Downeaster stations are accessible with <b>high</b> <b>platforms</b> or low platforms with wheelchair lifts.|$|R
50|$|These {{problems}} were a major {{motivation for the}} development of low-floor trams, which allow transit operators to avoid the retrofitting of <b>high</b> <b>platforms</b> on existing routes, while still providing improved accessibility. However, for a newly constructed route, a route primarily located in tunnels, or a route with a dedicated right of way and enough space, <b>high</b> <b>platforms</b> are usually preferred, since high-floor vehicles are cheaper to manufacture, and have better operating characteristics.|$|R
25|$|A {{rapid transit}} system is an {{electric}} railway characterized by high speed and rapid acceleration. It uses passenger railcars operating singly or in multiple unit trains on fixed rails. It operates on separate rights-of-way {{from which all}} other vehicular and foot traffic are excluded (i.e. is fully grade separated from other traffic). It uses sophisticated signaling systems, and <b>high</b> <b>platform</b> loading.|$|E
25|$|The Gori Temple {{is located}} {{approximately}} 14 {{miles northwest of}} the Viravah Temple. The temple was built in 1375-1376 CE, in a Gujarati-style, and features 3 mandaps, with 52 Islamic-style domes. The temple measures 125 feet by 60 feet, and is built of marble. The entire temple is built on a <b>high</b> <b>platform</b> that is reached {{by a series of}} steps carved into stone.|$|E
25|$|Bound in Blood is a first-person shooter {{in which}} the player can control one of two characters; Ray McCall, or his brother Thomas. Whereas in the {{original}} Call of Juarez, the player controlled alternating characters from level to level, in Bound in Blood, most levels offer the player the choice of which character they wish to play as, with each character having a slightly different style of gameplay. The character which the player does not choose {{is controlled by the}} AI {{for the duration of the}} level. There are also occasional levels through which the player must play with a specific character. In many levels, there will be times where the brothers will have to directly help one another, such as Thomas helping Ray to reach a <b>high</b> <b>platform,</b> or Ray kicking down a door for Thomas. Most levels are played through in the same manner, irrespective of which character is chosen, with the only difference being that of style. Occasionally, however, the brothers will separate within a level, and, as such, the level design will be different depending on which character the player is using.|$|E
50|$|A {{rail vehicle}} of high-floor design usually has a flat floor between 76 cm and 137 cm above {{the top of}} the railhead. For reasons of accessibility, an attempt is made to {{standardize}} the height, to allow a stair stepless entry from <b>high</b> <b>platforms.</b> The increased construction cost of <b>high</b> <b>platforms,</b> and the difficulty of making them compatible with other features of the urban landscape, are a significant obstacle to the conversion of existing tram networks into urban rail networks, particularly when many of the stations or stops are in the streets.|$|R
5000|$|When {{it became}} clear to city {{authorities}} that the construction {{of a large number of}} additional <b>high</b> <b>platforms</b> was not financially feasible, other options were investigated. It was deemed most economical to create a second low-floor network and equip the remaining lines with <b>high</b> <b>platforms.</b> Between the stations [...] "Ebertplatz" [...] and [...] "Barbarossaplatz", there are two possible routes. It was decided that the future low-floor lines would be concentrated in the tunnel underneath the Cologne Ring road, while high-floor lines would use the tunnel under the Central station.|$|R

25|$|The first fort to be {{built in}} the archipelago, the Castle of São Luís was erected between the 1460 and 1470, by the founder of Angra, Álvaro Martins Homem. It was a {{fortification}} of modest proportions, established on a hilltop (the current Alto da Memória) with a dominant position over the valley, river and harbour. Its design was in keeping with the late-medieval military design and constructed on a <b>high</b> <b>platform,</b> within the earth and away from the sea. Its elevation and slope resulted in an artificial ravine, whose waters were captured by Álvaro Martins (1461) to move his milling wheels along its course; the fortification became popularly known as the Castle of Moinhos or Castle of Mills. Writing in between 1644 and 1711, Father Manuel Luís Maldonado wrote of the many waterways of Angra, noted several of the mills that dotted the path of the main ravine: the mills of Janela, Cova, Picão, Rego, Madeira, Calçada, Calçadinha, Fábrica, Muro, Duas Portas, São João de Deus and the Moinho Novo. Similarly, Gaspar Frutuoso mentioned these mills and waterways, noting that: in the hillock that circles Angra, in one of the higher hilltops to the north, is a castle fort with munitions and artilhery, newly renovated and provessioned, which had earlier been weak, erected solely for the shelter and defense of its residencts.|$|E
500|$|It is {{speculated that}} the Bara Gumbad was {{constructed}} to provide a gateway to the nearby mosque. Although the structure does not house any tomb, there is a platform in the central courtyard that suggests the structure to be a burial place. The purpose Bara Gumbad is unknown. Bara Gumbad is grouped together with a mosque and [...] "mehman khana" [...] which is a smaller structure with five bays. All the structures are constructed on a [...] <b>high</b> <b>platform,</b> with a total area of [...] The platform measures [...] (east-west) and [...] (north-south).|$|E
500|$|Pyramid A1 {{is one of}} the {{principal}} structures of Group A, together with the ballcourt. The pyramid is [...] high and measures [...] at the base. It was built using cut stone and has four stepped levels, each of which terminates in a cornice. The pyramid faces west onto the plaza and has two access stairways with 27 steps each. The stairways are flanked by smooth balustrades built from well-fitted slabs. The summit of the pyramid supports a [...] <b>high</b> <b>platform</b> that once formed the base for the summit temple. The pyramid was built over another structure, a stucco platform with two levels, the upper of which terminated in a cornice.|$|E

500|$|Some inter-war architects {{developed}} this approach further. Some traditional classical memorials had been criticised in both England and Germany as being fussy and overly ornate. Men such as Lutyens took the classical principles, but simplified {{them until the}} design became almost abstract. These memorials used abstract, beautiful designs intended to remove the viewer from the real world, and focus them on an idealised sense of self-sacrifice, {{a continuation of the}} principle of a [...] "beautiful death". In many ways the simplified, but still classical, forms of memorials like the Cenotaph meant that mourners could read their own thoughts and concerns onto the memorial. Where dead soldiers were shown, they were depicted in an image of serenity and peace, often physically distanced from the viewer on a <b>high</b> <b>platform,</b> the entire effect reflected by the silence that traditionally surrounds ceremonies at the Cenotaph.|$|E
500|$|The Main or Mahavira Hall ( [...] , Dàxíongbǎo Diàn) is {{the northernmost}} and largest hall, and {{dates from the}} 11th century. It {{measures}} seven by five bays (40.5 by 25 m) and has three doors {{at the front of}} the hall. The hall is built on an elevated three meter <b>high</b> <b>platform</b> that was once the site of both a drum and bell tower that are no longer extant. According to the standards in the 11th-century Chinese architectural treatise Yingzao Fashi, the hall is held up by fifth rank bracket sets (鋪作) in a system of eight ranks. The interior contains four large Buddha statues representing the four cardinal directions, and a central statue representing Sakyamuni. The statues are similar, and represent the Buddha displaying different mudras (symbolic hand gestures). Above the Sakyamuni statue, is a caisson (...) , an octagonal wooden ceiling that is painted and decorated.|$|E
500|$|The {{memorial}} forms a {{sharp contrast}} with both the earlier monuments of the South African War and most monuments contemporary to the First World War. Memorials of the South African War typically included figures of soldiers, sometimes dying in conflict, but always heroically in a [...] "beautiful death". Classical symbolism was often used to distance the event of death from the observer, as typified in William Colton's work at Worcester. Most First World War memorials reacted to the criticism of this approach by adopting cleaner architectural forms, but still retaining the ideal of a [...] "beautiful death", an approach which {{can be seen at}} Lutyens' Southampton Cenotaph, the precursor to his more famous Cenotaph on Whitehall. These memorials frequently used abstract, beautiful designs intended to remove the viewer from the real world, and focus them on an idealised sense of self-sacrifice. Soldiers in these memorials were still frequently depicted as Homeric warriors, and classical ideals and symbols remained popular, as can be seen at the Machine Gun Corps Memorial by Francis Derwent Wood, close to the Royal Artillery Memorial itself. Where dead soldiers were shown, they were depicted in an image of serenity and peace, often physically distanced from the viewer on a <b>high</b> <b>platform,</b> the entire effect reflected by the silence that traditionally surrounds ceremonies at the Cenotaph.|$|E

500|$|The Dening Hall is {{the main}} hall of the temple, and was built in 1270 during the Yuan Dynasty. The hall is fronted by a massive {{platform}} known as a yuetai (月台, literally moon platform), which measures 25 by 20 meters. Built on a very <b>high</b> <b>platform</b> itself, the Dening Hall can be accessed by either a center front staircases or one of two side staircases attached to the yuetai. Enclosing {{the perimeter of the}} platform is a white marble balustrade capped by lions. The hall itself measures seven by four bays and is surrounded by a covered arcade. According to the Yingzao Fashi, a Song Dynasty architectural treatise, the Dening Hall has 6th puzuo type column bracketing to support its roof. [...] This type of bracketing has three transverse and three horizontal bracket arms. The 6th puzuo brackets are the most complex that survive from the Yuan Dynasty. Based on the complex bracketing, the marble balustrade and the height of the platform, Steinhardt identifies the Dening Hall as one of the two most eminent and important extant wooden halls that date from the Yuan period. These characteristics also closely match descriptions of the architecture at the capital, meaning that Dening Hall is representative of the architecture at the Yuan dynasty capital of Dadu (currently Beijing).|$|E
500|$|The jagamohana or mukhasala is a pidha deula (square {{building}} with a pyramid-shaped roof), [...] in height with a [...] square base. It stands on a [...] <b>high</b> <b>platform,</b> which is decorated with floral designs and scrollwork. The outer wall is divided into 5 parts, as in the vimana. The niches and intervening recesses of the first part are adorned with Khakhara mundi niches (having amorous couples and erotic scenes), Naga pilasters, scrollwork, jaliwork and floral motifs. The talajangha has the same motifs as the vimana's {{second part of the}} wall, barring the goddesses. The third part of the wall [...] has three horizontal mouldings. The fourth part of the wall also resembles its counterpart in the vimana, except it does not have the Naga and goddess sculptures. The uppermost part of the wall has seven horizontal mouldings, the central portion of which is decorated with dancing women, amorous couples, elephants, deer, scrollwork and jaliwork. The gavaksha (decorative arch) on the northern and southern sides are royal court and sikshadana scenes, with a balustraded window on each side. The frames of the windows are decorated with scrollwork, jaliwork, playing boys, floral designs, creepers and dancing women. The structure is topped with a pyramidal shikhara. The inner walls have no ornamentation. The jagamohana has two doorways: one towards the sanctum (already discussed in vimana section) and other towards the natamandapa, which is similar in style and decoration to the former.|$|E
500|$|To seek {{to prevent}} any {{misappropriation}} of the charism of Antoine within the movement after his death, the Antoinist journal L'Unitif published articles which presented Catherine as the legitimate successor and also redefined precisely {{the limits of the}} healers' role. To avoid a succession crisis and to ensure the continuity of the religion, Catherine decided to promote a centralized worship around the person of her husband and thus established various rules between 1925 and 1930. For example, she placed, in the temple before the <b>high</b> <b>platform,</b> the photograph of her husband with the mention [...] "The Father is making the Operation", then added her own portrait. She also authorized the desservants—the members the most involved in the religion—to perform the General Operation from the higher platform, but wanted that the ceremony would be preceded by a statement that it is the Father who performs the Operation and that the faith must be placed in him to obtain satisfaction. She insisted that the desservant installed in the platform would be sat during the reading of Antoine's writings. She also organized the Father's day, on 25 June, and rituals such as baptism, communion and marriage, which transformed the group into institutionalized religion. She ordered that nothing should be changed in her husband's writings and in 1932 closed reading rooms in which followers gave personal teachings. However, unlike the writings of her husband which can be sold by anyone, changes and rules established by Catherine are recorded in books only available to the desservants, thus remaining confidential. From 17 June 1930, a faithful named Narcisse Nihoul replaced her to perform the General Operation at the platform of the temple.|$|E
50|$|In the two-area system {{served by}} the GT8-100D/2S-M Flexity Swift vehicles, 55 cm <b>high</b> <b>platforms</b> were built to provide step-free entrances.
