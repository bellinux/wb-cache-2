5000|$|Of {{the three}} {{technique}}s, sliding {{is the most}} common and least extreme. [...] The basic premise of the technique is to free up a region of DNA that the <b>histone</b> <b>octamer</b> would normally tightly bind. While the technique is not well defined, the most prominent hypothesis is that the sliding is done in an “inchworm” fashion. In this method, using ATP as an energy source, the translocase domain of the nucleosome-remodeling complex detaches a small region of DNA from the <b>histone</b> <b>octamer.</b> This “wave” of DNA, spontaneously breaking and remaking the hydrogen bonds as it goes, then propagates down the nucleosomal DNA until it reaches the last binding site with the <b>histone</b> <b>octamer.</b> Once the wave reaches the end of the <b>histone</b> <b>octamer</b> the excess that was once at the edge is extended into the region of linker DNA. In total, one round of this method moves the <b>histone</b> <b>octamer</b> several base pairs in a particular direction—away from the direction the “wave” propagated.|$|E

Nucleosomes consist of a <b>histone</b> <b>octamer</b> surrounded by 147 base pairs of DNA wrapped in a superhelical manner. [...] In addition to compacting the DNA, the <b>histone</b> <b>octamer</b> {{plays a key role}} in the transcription of the DNA surrounding it. The <b>histone</b> <b>octamer</b> interacts with the DNA through both its core histone folds and N-terminal tails. The histone fold interacts chemically and physically with the DNA’s minor groove. Studies have found that the histones interact more favorably with A:T enriched regions than G:C enriched regions in the minor grooves. The N-terminal tails do not interact with a specific region of DNA but rather stabilize and guide the DNA wrapped around the octamer. The interactions between the <b>histone</b> <b>octamer</b> and DNA, however, are not permanent. The two can be separated quite easily and often are during replication and transcription.

40|$|The best-characterized {{acetylation}} {{of newly}} synthesized histone H 4 is the diacetylation of the NH 2 -terminal tail on lysines 5 and 12. Despite its evolutionary conservation, {{this pattern of}} modification has not {{been shown to be}} essential for either viability or chromatin assembly in any model organism. We demonstrate that mutations in histone H 4 lysines 5 and 12 in yeast confer hy-persensitivity to replication stress and DNA-damaging agents when combined with mutations in histone H 4 lysine 91, which has also been found to be a site of acetylation on soluble histone H 4. In addition, these mutations confer a dramatic decrease in cell viability when combined with mutations in histone H 3 lysine 56. We also show that mutation of the sites of acetylation on newly synthesized histone H 4 results in defects in the reassembly of chromatin structure that accompanies the repair of HO-mediated double-strand breaks. This defect is not due to a decrease in the level of histone H 3 lysine 56 acetylation. Intriguingly, mutations that alter the sites of newly synthesized histone H 4 acetylation display a marked decrease in levels of phosphorylated H 2 A (-H 2 AX) in chromatin surrounding the double-strand break. These results indicate that the sites of acetylation on newly syn-thesized histones H 3 and H 4 can function in nonoverlapping ways that are required for chromatin assembly, viability, and DNA damage response signaling.

Posttranslational modification (PTM) of histone proteins regulates nucleosome function. To date, only modest changes in nucleosome structure have been directly attributed to histone PTMs. Histone residue H 3 (T 118) is located near the nucleo-some dyad and can be phosphorylated. This PTM destabilizes nucleosomes and is implicated in the regulation of transcription and repair. Here, we report gel electrophoretic mobility, sucrose gradient sedimentation, thermal disassembly, micrococcal nuclease digestion and atomic force microscopy measurements of two DNA–histone complexes that are structurally distinct from nu-cleosomes. We find that H 3 (T 118 ph) facilitates {{the formation of a}} nucleosome duplex with two DNA molecules wrapped around two histone octamers, and an altosome complex that contains one DNA molecule wrapped around two histone octamers. The nucleosome duplex complex forms within short 150 bp DNA molecules, whereas altosomes require at least 250 bp of DNA and form repeatedly along 3000 bp DNA molecules.

Compaction into a NCP changes the charge transport dynamics in AQ- 157 TG drastically. Not only is the overall yield of oxidative lesions decreased in the NCPs, but the preferred sites of oxidative damage change as well. This NCP-dependent attenuation of DNA charge transport is attributed to DNA–protein interactions involving the folded histone core since removal of the histone tails did not perturb the charge transport dynamics in AQ- 157 TG NCPs...|$|R
40|$|Abstract Background Nucleosome {{assembly}} proteins (NAPs) are histone chaperones {{that are}} {{crucial for the}} shuttling and incorporation of histones into nucleosomes. NAPs participate in the assembly and disassembly of nucleosomes thus contributing to chromatin structure organization. The human malaria parasite Plasmodium falciparum contains two nucleosome assembly proteins termed PfNapL and PfNapS. Methods Three-dimensional crystal structure of PfNapS has been determined and analysed. Gene knockout and localization studies were also performed on PfNapS using transfection studies. Fluorescence spectroscopy was performed to identify histone-binding sites on PfNapS. Extensive sequence and structural comparisons were done with the crystal structures available for NAP/SET family of proteins. Results Crystal structure of PfNapS shares structural similarity with previous structures from NAP/SET family. Failed attempts to knock-out the gene for PfNapS from malaria parasite suggest essentiality in the parasite. GFP-fused PfNapS fusion protein targeting indicates cellular localization of PfNapS in the parasite nucleus. Fluorescence spectroscopy data suggest that PfNapS interacts with core <b>histones</b> (tetramer, <b>octamer,</b> H 3, H 4, H 2 A and H 2 B) at a different site from its interaction with linker histone H 1.

We performed molecular dynamics simulations of the nucleosome in explicit water to study the dynamics of its histone-DNA interactions. A high-resolution histone-DNA interaction map was derived that revealed a five-nucleotide periodicity, {{in which the two}} DNA strands of the double helix made alternating contacts. On the 100 -ns timescale, the histone tails mostly maintained their initial positions relative to the DNA, and the spontaneous unwrapping of DNA was limited to 1 – 2 basepairs. In steered molecular dynamics simulations, external forces were applied to the linker DNA to investigate the unwrapping pathway of the nucleosomal DNA. In comparison with a nucleosome without the unstructured N-terminal histone tails, the following findings were obtained: 1), Two main barriers during unwrapping were identified at DNA position ± 70 and ± 45 basepairs relative to the central DNA basepair at the dyad axis. 2), DNA interactions of the histone H 3 N-terminus and the histone H 2 A C-terminus opposed the initiation of unwrapping. 3), The N-terminal tails of H 2 A, H 2 B, and H 4 counteracted the unwrapping process at later stages and were essential determinants of nucleosome dynamics.

40|$|Structural {{studies have}} {{revealed}} that chromatin is composed of repeating units or nucleosomes having two distinct domains, the nucleosome core and the linker region. The nucleosome core comprises 146 base pairs of DNA wound in one and three quarter turns around an <b>octamer</b> of <b>histones</b> made up of two symmetrical tetramers (1). It may be inferred on topological grounds that this structure must be perturbed during chromatin transcription and replication since the histone core bridges the supercoil which blocks the passage of polymerase along the template and prevents the unwinding of DNA required for enzymatic copying. A number of mechanisms for freeing the DNA template may be envisaged, and one detailed model, based on symmetrical dissociation of the histone tetramers, has been proposed (2).

40|$|A common post-translational {{modification}} (PTM) of proteins is lysine acetylation. This {{is an especially}} ubiquitous PTM in the histones of chromatin, and is important for helping to regulate both structural and mechanistic aspects of chromatin. The fundamental unit of chromatin is called the nucleosome and {{is made up of}} DNA that wraps around a <b>histone</b> protein <b>octamer.</b> Protruding from the nucleosome are 10 unstructured “tails” which protrude into the aqueous environment. A number of strategies exist for generating acetylated nucleosomes for the in-vitro study of chromatin including: Purification from eukaryotic organisms, chemical acetylation, amino acid analog incorporation, enzyme mediated acetylation, native chemical ligation of peptides, and enzyme mediated ligation of peptdes. An especially attractive approach is to genetically encode acetyl-lysine residues using nonsense suppression. This strategy has been successfully applied to single sites of histone acetylation. However, because histone acetylation can often occur at multiple sites simultaneously, it is worth while to determine whether this approach could be extended. The results in this thesis show that recombinantly expressed histone H 3 proteins that incorporate up to four sites of lysine acetylation on the histone tail can be produced in good yields. Because the amount of expressed multi-acetylated histone is reduced relative to the wild type, a purification strategy involving affinity purification and ion exchange chromatography was optimized. This expression and purification strategy ultimately generates H 3 histone uniformly acetylated at the desired position at levels and purity sufficient to assemble histone octamers. Histone octamers containing four sites of lysine acetylation were assembled into mononucleosomes and enzymatic assays confirmed that this acetylation largely blocks further acetylation by the yeast SAGA acetyltransferase complex. In the future, multiply acetylated histones may be applied in many ways including two that are of primary interest. Firstly, they can be used to mechanistically probe the Spt-Ada-Gcn 5 acetyltransferase (SAGA) complex in yeast which is known to play an active part in the activation of transcription in silent inducible genes.

5000|$|The core histone {{proteins}} {{contains a}} characteristic structural motif termed the [...] "histone fold," [...] {{which consists of}} three alpha-helices (α1-3) separated by two loops (L1-2).

Histones dimerise about their long α2 helices in an anti-parallel orientation, and, {{in the case of}} H3 and H4, two such dimers form a 4-helix bundle stabilised by extensive H3-H3’ interaction. The H2A/H2B dimer binds onto the H3/H4 tetramer due to interactions between H4 and H2B, which include the formation of a hydrophobic cluster. The <b>histone</b> <b>octamer</b> is formed by a central H3/H4 tetramer sandwiched between two H2A/H2B dimers.

Both proteins interact with MBD 2 functionally and bio-chemically. Mutation of a single amino acid of p 66 a abolishes in vivo binding to MBD 2 and interferes with MBD 2 -mediated repression. This loss of bind-ing results in a diffuse nuclear localization in con-trast to wild-type p 66 a that shows a speckled nuclear distribution.

40|$|The DNA in the {{eukaryotic}} nucleus {{is organized}} into a complex DNA-protein structure called chromatin. The basic repeating unit of chromatin is the nucleosome, {{which consists of}} 147 bp of DNA wrapped around a <b>histone</b> protein <b>octamer.</b> The nucleosomes form a “beads on a string” structure, which can be folded into higherorder structures that allow an extensive degree of DNA compaction. This compaction is so effective that 2 meters of DNA can fit into the human cell nucleus with a diameter of only 10 m. Hence, nucleosomes condense and organize the genome, {{but at the same}} time they occlude many regulatory elements essential for transcription, replication, repair and recombination. To ensure dynamic access to packaged DNA, cells have evolved a set of proteins called chromatin remodeling complexes, which actively restructure chromatin. These enzymes use the energy from ATP hydrolysis to unwrap, slide, and eject nucleosomes. This thesis describes the roles of two families of ATP-dependent chromatin remodeling factors in chromatin regulation and organization in the model organism Schizosaccharomyces pombe (fission yeast). We show that the CHD remodeling factor, Hrp 1, promotes incorporation of the H 3 histone variant CENP-ACnp 1 at centromeres and at a set of gene promoters. We suggest that Hrp 1 participates in a remodeling process that evicts H 3 from promoters, both in euchromatin and centromeric chromatin, which then facilitates CENP-A Cnp 1 incorporation. Furthermore, we demonstrate that the Fun 30 remodeling factor, Fft 3, regulates the chromatin structure over insulator elements and tethers them to the inner nuclear membrane close to nuclear pores. This organizes the chromatin into different domains and ensures correct chromatin structure and gene expression at silent domains. Additionally, we have generated the first genome-wide map of nucleosome positions in S. pombe. This map revealed important differences from the related yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae. The two yeasts showed differences in nucleosome spacing, the roles of DNA sequence features and in the regular nucleosome arrays. This argues against the existence of an evolutionarily conserved genomic code for nucleosome positioning. Instead, species-specific nucleosome positioning factors (e. g. chromatin remodeling complexes) appear to override the biophysical properties of the DNA sequence...|$|R
