40|$|The {{problem of}} the research: The {{analysis}} of commercial activity helps {{to get to know}} better the market and factors, which predetermine its changes. This allows to prepare more effective plan of company’s activity and to protect leaders from incorrect decisions. Trying to accomplish theoretical factors of commercial activities analysis practicing, the market of JSC “Agrokonsultos group” was chosen. This company resells disinfection materials. The decision was predetermined also by the thing, that despite the market of disinfection materials is small, it is very important and there is not so much information about it. The purpose of the research – to analyze the commercial activity of cattle-breeding company, to evaluate the tendency of resold disinfection materials consumption. Tasks: 1. to analyze and systematize academic literature related with company’s activity; 2. to get acquainted with JCS “Agrokonsultos group” activity; 3. to analyze commercial activity of this company; 4. to discuss the demand’s and supply’s of resold disinfection materials; 5. to find out the main factors, which influence the supply and demand of disinfection materials; 6. to give conclusions. Results: After analyzing JSC “Agrokonsultos group” commercial activity it was established, that the most profitable market are large cattle-breeding complexes, which can buy large amounts of disinfection materials. There also can be direct contracts or simple permanent orders. When the analysis of disinfection materials market was finished it was established, that imported disinfection materials of the company take 11. 7 % of the market. It was also established that JSC “Agrokonsultos group” taking into consideration the market situation offers 5 disinfection materials which are authorized by Lithuanian state veterinary inspection. Four (4) of this materials are intended for disinfection of <b>equipment</b> <b>and</b> <b>premises</b> and 5 -th – for exterminating parasites. It was proved that the biggest profit was reached selling Neopredisan 135 - 1 disinfection material which is intended for disinfection of <b>equipment</b> <b>and</b> <b>premises,</b> and the Venno Oxygen material - intended for exterminating parasites, which destroys eggs of round worms from animals and other surfaces – had the smallest demand...|$|E

40|$|Managing pests of stored grain {{has become}} an {{increasingly}} serious problem in Brazil. This is because grain production {{has more than doubled}} in the last 10 years and insect pests have become resistant to protectant insecticides. In the same period, use of phosphine fumigation has increased rapidly and is now widely practised. However, control failures with phosphine have become common as fumigations are undertaken in unsealed silos and in situations where sanitation is poor. As a consequence, many parcels of grain are repeatedly fumigated. In response to this situation, Embrapa initiated a programme to introduce IPM into the central grain storage facilities. Our strategy included the following elements: (a) changing behaviour through training of the storage facilities personnel; (b) improving knowledge of stored grain unit; (c) cleanliness of the <b>equipment</b> <b>and</b> <b>premises</b> and, after that, spray residual insecticide; (d) identification of grain-stored pests; (e) resistance tests; (f) insecticide treatment and fumigation; (g) sampling and monitoring the grain. The IPM programme was introduced into two storage facilities in Paraná State. Following successful implementation of IPM, these facilities were able to supply insect-free grain and had a bonus from the market. The success of these companies led to the adoption of IPM by other storage companies. IPM systems are now running in 13 separate facilities owned by nine companies. To support the programme, Embrapa Wheat has trained more than 1, 000 stored grain operators and released an IPM manual and website www. cnpt. embrapa. br/pesquisa/entomologia/mip. The challenges to be pursue for the next fifteen years of the research team are sealing silos, measure phosphine concentrations, pure PH 3 applications, new protectants as spinosad (the bacterial derivate pesticide), offering technologies to guarantee high quality grains with insect free and residues free in the international market. 201...|$|E
40|$|Abstract—Tea, {{produced}} from the evergreen plant, Camellia Sinensis, {{is the most}} widely consumed beverage in the world after water. Although tea processing has now diversified into various speciality end products such as instant, white, oolong, iced, flavoured, and various blends, the most abundantly produced tea product {{in the world is}} fermented black tea. Black tea production is essentially a “dry ” process, as no water is used at any of the production process steps. However liquid waste is generated due to the use of water for cleaning process <b>equipment</b> <b>and</b> factory <b>premises.</b> The waste exits the factory as coloured liquid effluent that must be treated before being discharged into rivers, lakes and other fresh water bodies. This paper presents findings of a study carried out to evaluate the performance of a combined adsorption and advanced oxidation process in removing colour from tea industry wastewater. The variables explored were the effects of sorbent mass, oxidant dosage, solution pH, agitation rate and temperature, on the decolouration of tea industry effluent. The results indicate that the combined adsorption and advanced oxidation is most effective at pH 3 wherein the effluent colour was reduced from 478 Pt-Co colour units to 8 Pt-Co colour units. The latter meets the NEMA recommended limit for discharge of colored effluents. Keywords—Tea industry effluent, Water pollution, Colou...|$|R
