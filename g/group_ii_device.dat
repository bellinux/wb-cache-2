40|$|Ketamine, aN-methyl-D-aspartate {{receptor}} antagonist inhibits central sensitization due to peripheral nociception thus potentiating the analgesic {{effect of}} morphine. The {{purpose of our}} study was to evaluate {{the effect of adding}} small-dose ketamine in a multimodal regimen of postoperative patient-controlled epidural analgesia (PCEA). One hundred patients of American Society of Anesthesiologists physical status I-II, undergoing major upper abdominal surgery were randomly allocated to two groups. Group I received PCEA device containing bupivacaine hydrochloride 0. 0625 % and morphine sulphate (preservative free) 0. 05 mg/ml. <b>Group</b> <b>II</b> received PCEA <b>device</b> containing bupivacaine hydrochloride 0. 0625 %, morphine sulphate (preservative free) 0. 05 mg/ml and ketamine hydrochloride (preservative free) 0. 2 mg/ml.

40|$|Aortic valve {{replacement}} (AVR) using allografts is an established method of treating aortic valve disease. It is uncertain, however, whether the increased technical demands of allograft AVR {{can be justified}} in emergency operations. This study reports 15 patients treated between 1987 and 1990 for acute bacterial or fungal endocarditis involving the aortic valve. Patients underwent emergency AVR because of severe congestive failure, overwhelming sepsis or cerebral emboli. Eight patients received prosthetic valves (group I: 4 mechanical, 4 porcine) and 7 received human allografts (group II: 5 aortic and 2 pulmonary). The groups were comparable in age (group I, 55 years; <b>group</b> <b>II,</b> 51 years), intravenous drug abuse (group I, 1; <b>group</b> <b>II,</b> 3), and previous AVR (group I, 3; <b>group</b> <b>II,</b> 2). One <b>group</b> I and 4 <b>group</b> <b>II</b> patients had septal abscesses. Additional procedures in group I included mitral {{valve replacement}} (2), tricuspid valve replacement (1) and aortic root replacement (1). Additional procedures in <b>group</b> <b>II</b> were mitral valve repair (1), root replacement (1), atrial septal defect closure (1) and aortocoronary bypass (1). Mean bypass times (group I, 189 minutes; <b>group</b> <b>II,</b> 204 minutes) and cross-clamp times (group I; 108 minutes; <b>group</b> <b>II,</b> 121 minutes) were similar.
