METHODS: In study 1, each participant exercised with normothermic and hyperthermic core temperatures, in ambient temperatures of 25, 30 and 35 °C, and were subjected to hypercapnic challenges of + 4 and + 8 mmHg in each condition. In study 2 before and after sub-maximal exercise, radiant heating was employed to assess the influence of <b>dynamic</b> skin <b>temperature</b> on ventilation.

The {{dynamic pressure}} created by rotating components within the engine presents {{a unique opportunity}} for controlling {{the operation of the}} engine and for evaluating the condition of a specific component through interpretation of the dynamic pressure signal.

40|$|We {{experimentally}} {{investigate the}} boiling behavior of impacting ethanol drops on a heated smooth sapphire substrate at pressures ranging from P = 0. 13 bar to atmospheric pressure. We employ Frustrated Total Internal Reflection (FTIR) imaging {{to study the}} wetting dynamics of the contact between the drop and the substrate. The spreading drop can be in full contact (contact boiling), it can partially touch (transition boiling) or the drop can be fully levitated (Leidenfrost boiling). We show that {{the temperature of the}} boundary between contact and transition boiling shows at most a weak dependency on the impact velocity, but a significant decrease with decreasing ambient gas pressure. A striking correspondence is found between the temperature of this boundary and the static Leidenfrost temperature for all pressures. We therefore conclude that both phenomena share the same mechanism, and are dominated by the dynamics taken place at the contact line. On the other hand, the boundary between transition boiling and Leidenfrost boiling, i. e. the <b>dynamic</b> Leidenfrost <b>temperature,</b> increases for increasing impact velocity for all ambient gas pressures. Moreover, the <b>dynamic</b> Leidenfrost <b>temperature</b> coincides for pressures between P = 0. 13 and P = 0. 54 bar, whereas for atmospheric pressure the <b>dynamic</b> Leidenfrost <b>temperature</b> is slightly elevated. This indicates that the <b>dynamic</b> Leidenfrost <b>temperature</b> is at most weakly dependent on the enhanced evaporation by the lower saturation temperature of the liquid.

Sensory, chemical, and microbiological analyses were conducted over storage time and bacterial growth was modelled. Sensory quality index (QI), at five stable (1, 4, 9, 15, and 19 ± 1 °C) and three <b>dynamic</b> <b>temperatures,</b> progressed faster at higher temperatures, especially with sooner temperature abuses. Total volatile basic nitrogen remained under the acceptable limit throughout all the storage conditions. Total viable psychrotrophic counts (TVC) were around 5. 68 ± 0. 24 [*]log[*]CFU[*]g− 1 {{at the beginning and}} exceeded the limit of 6 [*]log[*]CFU[*]g− 1 after 216, 96, 36, 16, and 7 [*]h at 1, 4, 9, 15, and 19 ± 1 °C, respectively.

Since lower shelf lives were given by TVC rather than QI, it should be appropriate to base the product shelf life on the TVC acceptable limit. Kinetics models based on the Baranyi and Roberts and square root models, developed for TVC and Pseudomonas spp., gave acceptable bacterial estimations at <b>dynamic</b> <b>temperatures,</b> with over 80 % of observed counts within the acceptable simulation zone, revealing promising model applicability as a supporting tool for cold chain management.

40|$|The {{aim of this}} Master Thesis work is to {{optimize}} the Quasi-Dynamic Test (QDT) method {{used to evaluate the}} thermal performance of solar collectors. Three main areas of improvement are identified; increasing the angular resolution in the evaluation process, using a <b>dynamic</b> inlet <b>temperature</b> variation, both to increase the accuracy and the latter in combination with night time measurements to shorten the required test period. These options are tested, on one side with simulated data from TRNSYS, and on the other through experiments on a flat plate collector and a heat pipe evacuated tube collector. 	The results from analytical testing on simulated collector data show that an increased angular resolution, a <b>dynamic</b> inlet <b>temperature</b> change and night measurements are valid options for improving the QDT method. Experimental trials conducted on one type of flat-plate collector show that increasing the angular resolution in the evaluation is useful for detecting measurement errors caused by external factors and confirm the theoretical findings of using a <b>dynamic</b> inlet <b>temperature</b> variation coupled with night time measurements...|$|R

40|$|Abstract. Bias of ring {{laser gyro}} (RLG) changes with {{temperature}} in the non-linear way, which is an important restraining factor for improving the accuracy of RLG. For the deficiency of least squares regression and neural networks, a new method of temperature compensation of RLG’s bias was proposed, that is, building function regression model by using Least Squares-Support Vector Machine(LS-SVM). Static and <b>dynamic</b> <b>temperature</b> experiments of RLG’s bias are carried out. The results show that: after static temperature compensation, the maximum error of RLG’s bias has dropped from 0. 0413 º/hr to 0. 00073 º/hr; while after <b>dynamic</b> <b>temperature</b> compensation, the gyro precision has increased fromσ = 0. 0102 º/hr toσ = 0. 0011 º/hr.

Finally, through 3 D drawing and modeling, and computer assistance for mold flow and verification to develop and produce models. During the manufacturing process, in order to solve the problems of tightness and warping, development and manufacture of <b>dynamic</b> mold <b>temperature</b> control were introduced.

40|$|In this program, a {{database}} of <b>dynamic</b> <b>temperature</b> and dynamic pressure measurements were acquired inside {{the core of a}} TECH 977 turbofan engine to support investigations of indirect combustion noise. <b>Dynamic</b> <b>temperature</b> and pressure measurements were recorded for engine gas dynamics up to temperatures of 3100 degrees Fahrenheit and transient responses as high as 1000 hertz. These measurements were made at the entrance of the high pressure turbine (HPT) and at the entrance and exit of the low pressure turbine (LPT). Measurements were made at two circumferential clocking positions. In the combustor and inter-turbine duct (ITD), measurements were made at two axial locations to enable the exploration of time delays. The <b>dynamic</b> <b>temperature</b> measurements were made using dual thin-wire thermocouple probes. The dynamic pressure measurements were made using semi-infinite probes. Prior to the engine test, a series of bench, oven, and combustor rig tests were conducted to characterize the performance of the dual wire temperature probes and to define and characterize the data acquisition systems. A measurement solution for acquiring <b>dynamic</b> <b>temperature</b> and pressure data on the engine was defined. A suite of hardware modifications were designed to incorporate the <b>dynamic</b> <b>temperature</b> and pressure instrumentation into the TECH 977 engine. In particular, a probe actuation system was developed to protect the delicate temperature probes during engine startup and transients in order to maximize sensor life. A set of temperature probes was procured and the TECH 977 engine was assembled with the suite of new and modified hardware. The engine was tested at four steady state operating speeds, with repeats. Dynamic pressure and temperature data were acquired at each condition for at least one minute. At the two highest power settings, temperature data could not be obtained at the forward probe locations since the mean temperatures exceeded the capability of the probes. The temperature data were processed using software that accounts for the effects of convective and conductive heat transfer. The software was developed under previous NASA sponsored programs. Compensated temperature spectra and compensated time histories corresponding to the <b>dynamic</b> <b>temperature</b> of the gas stream were generated. Auto-spectral and cross-spectral analyses of the data were performed to investigate spectral features, acoustic circumferential mode content, signal coherence, and time delays. The <b>dynamic</b> <b>temperature</b> data exhibit a wideband and fairly flat spectral content. The temperature spectra do not change substantially with operating speed. The pressure spectra in the combustor and ITD exhibit generally similar shapes and amplitudes, making it difficult to identify any features that suggest the presence of indirect combustion noise. Cross-spectral analysis reveal a strong correlation between pressure and temperature fluctuations in the ITD, but little correlation between temperature fluctuations at the entrance of the HPT and pressure fluctuations downstream of it. Temperature fluctuations at the entrance of the low pressure turbine were an order of magnitude smaller than those {{at the entrance to the}} high pressure turbine. Time delay analysis of the temperature fluctuations in the combustor was inconclusive, perhaps due to the substantial mixing that occurs between the upstream and downstream locations. Time delay analysis of the temperature fluctuations in the ITD indicate that they convect at the mean flow speed. Analysis of the data did not reveal any convincing indications of the presence of indirect combustion noise. However, this analysis has been preliminary and additional exploration of the data is recommended including the use of more sophisticated signal processing to explore subtle issues that have been revealed but which are not yet fully understood or explained...|$|E
