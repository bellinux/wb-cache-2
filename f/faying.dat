5000|$|In a slip-critical connection, loads are {{transferred}} from one element to another through friction forces developed between the <b>faying</b> {{surfaces of the}} connection. These friction forces are generated by the extreme tightness of the structural bolts holding the connection together. These bolts, usually tension control bolts or compressible washer tension indicating type bolts, are tensioned to a minimum required amount to generate large enough friction forces between the <b>faying</b> surfaces such that the shear (or tension) load is transferred by the structural members and not by the bolts(in shear) and the connection plates(in bearing). The [...] "turn of the nut" [...] method is also widely used to achieve that state of friction.|$|E
50|$|Induction welding is {{used for}} long {{production}} runs and is a highly automated process, usually used for welding the seams of pipes.

5000|$|Electric {{resistance}} welding (ERW) {{refers to a}} group of welding processes such as spot and seam welding that produce coalescence of <b>faying</b> surfaces where heat to form the weld is generated by the electrical resistance of material combined with the time and the force used to hold the materials together during welding. Some factors influencing heat or welding temperatures are the proportions of the workpieces, the metal coating or the lack of coating, the electrode materials, electrode geometry, electrode pressing force, electrical current and length of welding time. Small pools of molten metal are formed at the point of most electrical resistance (the connecting or [...] "faying" [...] surfaces) as an electrical current (100 - 100,000 A) is passed through the metal. In general, {{resistance welding}} methods are efficient and cause little pollution, but their applications are limited to relatively thin materials and the equipment cost can be high (although in production situations the cost per weld may be low).|$|E
50|$|Resistance {{seam welding}} {{is a process}} that {{produces}} a weld at the <b>faying</b> surfaces of two similar metals. The seam may be a butt joint or an overlap joint and is usually an automated process. It differs from butt welding in that butt welding typically welds the entire joint at once and seam welding forms the weld progressively, starting at one end. Like spot welding, seam welding relies on two electrodes, usually made from copper, to apply pressure and current. The electrodes are often disc shaped and rotate as the material passes between them. This allows the electrodes to stay in constant contact with the material to make long continuous welds. The electrodes may also move or assist the movement of the material. A transformer supplies energy to the weld joint in the form of low voltage, high current AC power. The joint of the work piece has high electrical resistance relative {{to the rest of the}} circuit and is heated to its melting point by the current. The semi-molten surfaces are pressed together by the welding pressure that creates a fusion bond, resulting in a uniformly welded structure. Most seam welders use water cooling through the electrode, transformer and controller assemblies due to the heat generated.|$|E

50|$|Spot welding is a {{resistance}} welding method used to join {{two or more}} overlapping metal sheets, studs, projections, electrical wiring hangers, some heat exchanger fins, and some tubing. Usually power sources and welding equipment are sized to the specific thickness and material being welded together. The thickness {{is limited by the}} output of the welding power source and thus the equipment range due to the current required for each application. Care is taken to eliminate contaminants between the <b>faying</b> surfaces. Usually, two copper electrodes are simultaneously used to clamp the metal sheets together and to pass current through the sheets. When the current is passed through the electrodes to the sheets, heat is generated due to the higher electrical resistance where the surfaces contact each other. As the electrical resistance of the material causes a heat buildup in the work pieces between the copper electrodes, the rising temperature causes a rising resistance, and results in a molten pool contained most of the time between the electrodes. As the heat dissipates throughout the workpiece in less than a second (resistance welding time is generally programmed as a quantity of AC cycles or milliseconds) the molten or plastic state grows to meet the welding tips. When the current is stopped the copper tips cool the spot weld, causing the metal to solidify under pressure. The water cooled copper electrodes remove the surface heat quickly, accelerating the solidification of the metal, since copper is an excellent conductor. Resistance spot welding typically employs electrical power in the form of direct current, alternating current, medium frequency half-wave direct current, or high-frequency half wave direct current.|$|E
50|$|<b>Faying</b> {{surfaces}} in riveted work shall be painted before putting them together. All surfaces of steel or iron work inaccessible after erection shall be protected {{as far as}} possible either by coating them with ` Smith's ' or other approved bituminous composition, or by filling the spaces which they enclose with lime concrete. Repainting Old Work. Before beginning to repaint work of any description it must be thoroughly cleaned. If the surface is in good condition it will be sufficient to scrub down with good soap and water and afterwards sponge and wipe dry. If the work has become rough it will often be necessary to use pumice stone to facilitate the operation of cleaning. The pumice should be cut or rubbed to a flat surface and vigorously applied with plenty of clean water. It is essential that the work should be quite dry before any paint is applied. If the old surface is much cracked and blistered no amount of rubbing with pumice will enable the workman to obtain a good ground for the new coats, and {{it will be necessary to}} remove the old paint entirely. For this purpose painters most frequently use a paint burner or torch that burns paraffin oil under air pressure. This causes the paint to soften and blister under the heat, in which state it is readily scraped off by a blunt knife. The old-fashioned grate filled with charcoal held close to the surface by means of a long handle is now not often used. There has recently been a considerable increase in the use of chemical paint removers in paste or liquid form; as a rule these contain some alkali, such as lime or caustic soda.|$|E
40|$|Metallizing {{has emerged}} as an {{effective}} protective coating for steel bridge members, providing a physical barrier and a galvanic protection.

As a particularity, relaxation of the clamping force is observed in the slip-critical connections with metallized <b>faying</b> surfaces. In this study, tests were designed to evaluate the effect of relaxation on the slip resistance of metallized <b>faying</b> surfaces in high strength bolted connections.

40|$|In {{the present}} study, {{aluminum}} alloy T-joints were welded using the laser stake-welding process. In {{order to improve}} the welding quality of the T-joints, an external electric current was used to aid the laser stake-welding process. The effects of the process parameters on the weld morphology, mechanical properties, and microstructure of the welded joints were analyzed and discussed in detail. The {{results indicate that the}} aided electric current should be no greater than a certain maximum value. Upon increasing the aided electric current, the weld width at the skin and stringer <b>faying</b> surface obviously increased, but there was an insignificant change in the penetration depth. Furthermore, the electric current and pressing force should be chosen to produce an expected weld width at the <b>faying</b> surface, whereas the laser power and welding speed should be primarily considered to obtain an optimal penetration depth. The tensile shear specimens failed across the <b>faying</b> surface or failed in the weld zone of the skin. The specimens that failed in the weld of the skin could resist a higher tensile shear load compared with specimens that failed across the <b>faying</b> surface. The microstructural observations and microhardness results demonstrated that the tensile shear load capacity of the aluminum alloy welded T-joint was mainly determined by the weld width at the <b>faying</b> surface...|$|E

40|$|Application of {{ultrasound}} {{technique to}} evaluate contact condition on the <b>faying</b> surface of riveted joints Fei Du, Baotong Li and Jun Hong Contact area and pressure distributions on the <b>faying</b> surfaces of riveted joints {{are critical to}} fretting fatigue crack.
