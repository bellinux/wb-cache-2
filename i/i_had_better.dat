He subtitled the piece, [...] "To the victims of fascism and war", ostensibly {{in memory of the}} Dresden fire bombing that took place in 1945. Yet, like the Tenth Symphony, this quartet incorporates quotations from several of his past works and his musical monogram: Shostakovich confessed to his friend Isaak Glikman [...] "I started thinking that if some day I die, nobody is likely to write a work in memory of me, so <b>I</b> <b>had</b> <b>better</b> write one myself." [...] Several of Shostakovich's colleagues, including Natalya Vovsi-Mikhoels and the cellist Valentin Berlinsky, were also aware of the Eighth Quartet's biographical intent.|$|E

In her own words, she [...] "rose up and challenged him {{in the presence of}} the rest of the coven. I told him that I was fed up with listening to all this senseless malice, and that, if a 'Night of the Long Knives' was what his sick little soul craved, he could get on with it, but he could get on with it alone, because <b>I</b> <b>had</b> <b>better</b> things to do". Shortly after, Cochrane committed ritual suicide on Midsummer 1966; she authored the poem [...] "Elegy for a Dead Witch" [...] in his memory. She remained in contact with his widow and other members of the Clan, as well as with Gray, and proceeded to work on occasion with The Regency, a group founded by former members of the Clan.|$|E

2500|$|Although Kennedy was {{pronounced}} dead at 1:00p.m. CST, the official announcement would not come until {{more than half an}} hour later. [...] After receiving word of the president's death, acting White House press secretary Malcolm Kilduff entered the hospital room where Vice President Johnson—who would be sworn in as the new President on Air Force one later that day—and his wife were sitting. Kilduff approached them and said to Johnson, [...] "Mr. President, I have to announce the death of President Kennedy. Is it OK with you that the announcement be made now?" [...] Johnson ordered that the announcement be made only after he left the hospital. When asking that the announcement be delayed, Johnson told Kilduff: [...] "I think <b>I</b> <b>had</b> <b>better</b> get out of here.[...]before you announce it. We don't know whether this is a worldwide conspiracy, whether they are after me as well as they were after President Kennedy, or whether they are after Speaker (John W.) McCormack, or Senator (Carl) Hayden. We just don't know." ...|$|E
2500|$|In October 1764 Fitzwilliam {{embarked}} on his grand tour with a clergyman, Thomas Crofts, nominated by Dr Edward Barnard, headmaster of Eton. Fitzwilliam was not impressed with France, writing that the French were [...] "a set of low, mean, impertinent people" [...] whose behaviour was [...] "so intolerable {{that it is}} absolutely {{impossible for me to}} associate with them...it is the opinion of everybody, that <b>I</b> <b>had</b> <b>better</b> quit the place immediately". After spending time around France and briefly in Switzerland he returned to England in early 1766, not leaving to continue his grand tour until December. In May 1767 he was in Italy, writing not long after he arrived in Genoa that [...] "I like this place beyond expression". Between the summers of 1767 and 1768 he saw paintings in Verona, the regatta in Venice and the galleries in Padua, Bologna and Florence. Fitzwilliam's taste in paintings was guided by Sir Horace Mann in Florence and William Hamilton in Naples. He returned to England in 1768 with fourteen paintings (eight Canalettos and some of the Bolognese School, such as Guercino and Guido Reni). Fitzwilliam returned to England for the last time in January 1769 after travelling from Naples over the Alps, through Switzerland, Mannheim and Paris.|$|E

2500|$|Trần Thủ Độ {{was also}} an honest {{mandarin}} who never profited his high position {{for the benefit of}} his family. It was said that one time the Emperor wanted to appointed Trần Thủ Độ's elder brother Trần An Quốc for the position of grand chancellor. Trần Thủ Độ politely declined the Emperor's request by an answer: [...] "An Quốc is my brother, if he is better than me then <b>I</b> <b>had</b> <b>better</b> retire from the position, but if Your Majesty think that I am better than him, so please not appoint him for grand chancellor. Because if we hold the same position then what royal court will become?". For his dedication, the Emperor personally redacted an epitaph for Trần Thủ Độ in his tomb. However, Trần Thủ Độ still remains as a controversial figure in History of Vietnam for his ruthless decisions against members of Lý royal family and his responsibility in the forced marriage between Trần Thái Tông and his brother Trần Liễu's wife, which was highly criticized by feudal historians. Sometimes, his Machiavellian figure was compared with Dorgon, the powerful general who helped establish the Qing Dynasty's rule in China, or Cardinal Mazarin who was chief minister of France for 20 years.|$|E
2500|$|Lott {{was born}} in Grenada, Mississippi, and lived his early years in nearby Duck Hill, where his father, Chester Paul Lott, sharecropped a stretch of cotton field. [...] Lott's mother, the former Iona Watson, was a schoolteacher. [...] When Lott was in the sixth grade, {{the family moved to}} Pascagoula, where Lott's father worked at a shipyard. [...] Lott {{attended}} college at the University of Mississippi in Oxford, where he obtained an undergraduate degree in public administration in 1963 and a J.D. degree in 1967. He served as a field representative for Ole Miss and was president of his fraternity, Sigma Nu. Lott was also an Ole Miss cheerleader, on the same team with future U.S. Senator Thad Cochran. [...] Regarding his education, the Congressional Record from 1999 quotes Senator Lott declaring: [...] "I am a product of public education from the first grade through the second, third, and fourth grades where I went to school at Duck Hill, Mississippi, and <b>I</b> <b>had</b> <b>better</b> teachers in the second, third, and fourth grades in Duck Hill, Mississippi, than I had the rest of my life." [...] Lott married Patricia Thompson on December 27, 1964. The couple has two children: Chester Trent [...] "Chet" [...] Lott Jr., and Tyler Lott.|$|E
2500|$|My first {{innings in}} Test cricket was, {{as you might}} expect, a trying experience, but proved {{to be one of}} the best cricket lessons of my career, thanks to Ian Redpath. I came to the wicket with Australia reeling at 5/107 to join [...] "Redders", who had watched three quick wickets fall at the other end. Illingworth and Snow, sensing that one more wicket would see them through our batting line up, stepped up their attack on the senior member of our partnership. [...] "Snowy" [...] {{concentrated}} his attack short of a length on [...] "Redders" [...] off-stump, with a liberal sprinkling of shorter pitched balls for good measure. Ian made a point of not playing at anything he didn't have to and ducked or swayed away from the shorter deliveries. Each time he swayed or ducked he came back to the upright position and sneered at [...] "Snowy". It may not have looked all that pretty, but it was pretty effective as both Illingworth and Snow became more and more frustrated. Ian's example at the other end made me feel that if it meant that much to him to keep his wicket intact then <b>I</b> <b>had</b> <b>better</b> make sure I try just as hard at my end to keep mine intact. Fortunately we both succeeded and our partnership put us into a sound position, but from my point of view I had received an invaluable lesson in what Test match batting was all about from one of the most courageous batsmen ever to play for Australia.|$|E
