500|$|I wrote a song a {{while back}} even before [...] "One Sweet Day" [...] {{and it was not}} my {{favorite}} song in the world, but I wrote it. Someone asked me to write a song and they told me the story, and you know {{it was kind of a}} moving concept or whatever. And I did it, and I was like you know it’s not necessarily what I like per se, but after doing the song over and over again and having people coming up to and saying, thank you for writing ‘Hero’ because it saved my life or it saved my father’s life or my brothers or sisters life, or something of that nature, I said I always have to sing that song when I’m performing because if I don’t, you never know who I’m leaving out and you know what, in times of my life I’ve had to turn to that song lyrically and flip it onto my own life and sing it to myself. So its from the ‘Music Box’ album, and it’s called ‘Hero', this <b>is</b> <b>for</b> <b>you.</b>|$|E

500|$|With Election Special, Cooder {{wanted to}} write an album with direct lyrics and {{encourage}} urgency in listeners during the US presidential election of 2012. He felt that the election season was [...] "the time of decision in this country... the most critical {{time in the history}} of the country". When asked about concerns over [...] "", Cooder said in an interview for the Los Angeles Times, [...] "I thought I should have a record that says, 'This here record <b>is</b> <b>for</b> <b>you</b> during election time.' Rather than be vague and poetic, let's just call this what it is. That way I may get people's attention. That's the idea." [...] Cooder drew on music he grew up listening to such as Depression-era songs and sought to appropriate contemporary subject matter to them. When writing the album, he also touched on the Occupy movement, which he felt optimistic about, saying that [...] "There's a sign of something. Those people are having conversations, and the conversations become issues and the issues become talked about. Pretty soon, the rest of the world picks up on it, even the politicians." ...|$|E
500|$|... "Thank you, mister President-elect, for {{inviting}} me to your inauguration gala. I {{would like to take}} a moment from this very public ceremony to speak of something very personal. It concerns a dear friend of mine who is no longer with us. His name is Ryan White. He was a hemophiliac who was diagnosed with the AIDS virus when he was eleven. He died shortly after turning eighteen, the very time most young people are beginning to explore life's wonderful possibilities. My friend Ryan was a very bright, very brave, and very normal young man who never wanted to be a symbol or a spokesperson for a deadly disease. Over the years, I've shared many silly, happy, and painful moments with Ryan and I was with him {{at the end of his}} brief but eventful journey. Ryan is gone and just as anyone who has lost a loved one to AIDS, I miss him deeply and constantly. He is gone, but I want his life to have meaning beyond his passing. It is my hope, President-elect Clinton, that you and your administration commit the resources needed to eliminate this awful disease that took my friend, and ended so many promising lives before their time. This song <b>is</b> <b>for</b> <b>you</b> Ryan". - Michael Jackson, January 1993.|$|E

According to a police affidavit, [...] "Johnson said the only reason for such killing would be because Obama is black." [...] During an August 25 interview with KCNC-TV, a CBS owned-and-operated television station in Denver, Johnson first denied being personally involved with the plot and, when asked whether he felt the men had serious plans {{to go through with}} the assassination, he said, [...] "Looking back at it, I don't want to say yes, but I don't want to say no." [...] Eventually, however, he admitted the other two men had planned a killing when he said, [...] "Yeah, they were here to do that, to assassinate him ... it's about as hard for me to swallow as it <b>is</b> <b>for</b> <b>you</b> to understand." [...] Johnson said the plan was for Adolf to, [...] "shoot Obama from a high vantage point using a [...] sighted at 750 yards". Johnson said the shooting was to take place during Obama's acceptance speech on August 28 at the Democratic National Convention in INVESCO Field at Mile High. Johnson told the station, [...] "He don't belong in political office. Blacks don't belong in political office. He ought to be shot." ...|$|E

2500|$|In {{the late}} 1860s Maykov became {{intrigued}} by The Tale of Igor's Campaign, which {{his son was}} studying in gymnasium at the time. Baffled by the vagueness and occasional incongruity of all the available translations, he shared his doubts with professor Izmail Streznevsky, who replied: [...] "It <b>is</b> <b>for</b> <b>you</b> to sort these things out." [...] Maykov later described the four years of work on the new translation that followed as his [...] "second university". His major objective was {{to come up with}} undeniable proof of the authenticity of the old text, something that many authors, Ivan Goncharov among them, expressed doubts about. Ignoring Dostoyevsky's advice to use rhymes so as to make the text sound more modern, Maykov provided the first ever scientifically substantiated translation of the document, supplied with comprehensive commentaries. First published in the January 1870 issue of Zarya magazine, it is still {{regarded as one of the}} finest achievements of his career.|$|E

[...] "There are people who have opinions about whatever and whoever, in terms of gender, in terms of race and weight, hairstyle, religion", says Blackman. [...] "But to me, your personality influences what you play and what you do, but everything else <b>is</b> <b>for</b> <b>you</b> to develop and to nourish and to take further, and that's where I'm at. In terms of my goals, me being a female drummer has nothing to with anything except for the fact that I wear bras and panties and guys don't." ...|$|E
2500|$|The Blessed Virgin Mary {{appeared}} to Saint Simon Stock, who was Prior General of the Carmelite Order {{in the mid}} 13th century. The earliest reference to the tradition of his Marian apparition, dating from the late 14th century, states that [...] "St. Simon was an Englishman, {{a man of great}} holiness and devotion, who always in his prayers asked the Virgin to favor his Order with some singular privilege. The Virgin {{appeared to}} him holding the Brown Scapular in her hand saying, 'This <b>is</b> <b>for</b> <b>you</b> and yours a privilege; the one who dies in it will be saved.'" [...] A scapular is an apron-like garment that forms part of the Carmelite religious habit, and in the original context the Blessed Virgin Mary's promise was an assurance that religious who persevered in their vocation would be saved; beginning {{in the latter half of}} the 16th century the small devotional scapular became very popular as a sacramental.|$|E
