40|$|In {{this study}} the bright greenish-yellow <b>fluorescence</b> <b>test,</b> widely {{used by the}} corn milling industry, was {{compared}} to the thin-layer chromatography (TLC) and spectrofluorimetry methods for aflatoxin detection in 40 corn samples naturally contaminated by the Aspergillus section Flavi. According to the corn processing industry criteria, all the samples were adequate for human and animal consumption by the bright greenish-yellow <b>fluorescence</b> <b>test,</b> but TLC and spectrofluorimetry analysis detected aflatoxins above the maximum tolerated limit (20 µg/kg) in 7 and 8 samples, respectively. Aflatoxins were detected in 16 (40 %) corn samples by TLC, with levels ranging from 4. 0 to 54. 0 µg/kg (mean 19. 97 ± 15. 97 µg/kg), and in 25 (62. 5 %) samples by spectrofluorimetry, with levels ranging from 1. 0 to 58. 66 µg/kg (mean 17. 14 ± 17. 81 µg/kg). The results indicated a good correlation (&# 961; = 0. 97) between TLC and spectrofluorimetry for aflatoxin determination in naturally contaminated corn. The bright greenish-yellow <b>fluorescence</b> <b>test</b> was simple and quick, but it showed 20 % false-negative results, suggesting its use only as screening method for detecting the suspected lots of grains that should be tested further for aflatoxin by more sensitive methods...|$|E

40|$|Serum {{samples from}} 20 human {{immunodeficiency}} virus type 1 (HIV- 1) - and 30 HIV- 2 -infected and 7 dually infected individuals were reacted by using the indirect immunofluorescence assay (IFA) and membrane fluorescence assay {{in order to determine}} whether these methods were useful for typing HIV- 1 and HIV- 2 antibodies. Although 41 of 50 (82 %) of the HIV- 1 - and HIV- 2 -positive specimens cross-reacted to some extent with the heterologous antigen in the IFA, the antigen with the higher titer correlated completely with the infecting type. The IFA could not distinguish single from dual infections, however. In contrast, only 4 of the 50 (8 %) serum samples cross-reacted in the membrane <b>fluorescence</b> <b>test.</b> All seven of the specimens from patients with mixed infections reacted with both antigens. The membrane <b>fluorescence</b> <b>test</b> appears to be reliable for serodifferentiation of HIV- 1 and HIV- 2 infections and may be useful for laboratories with low-volume typing requirements...|$|E

DETAILED DESCRIPTION - CD-based biochemical <b>fluorescence</b> <b>testing</b> apparatus, comprising {{a laser diode}} (21) emitting linearly-polarized light, directed through an optical unit (A) comprising a polarization beam splitter (22), a lambda / 4 plate (23) and a focusing element (24), onto a carrier plate (1), is new. The plate rotates about an axis and has binary, optically-detectable information structures. On its surface and/or within it, is an arrangement of numerous discrete samples marked with fluorophors. Light reflected from the information structures is directed through the optical unit (A) onto an optical detector (25) to register the information. Fluorescent light emitted from the marked samples is directed via a wavelength-selective, spatially-separating spectral filter (26) onto an optical detector (27). An INDEPENDENT CLAIM is included for the corresponding method of carrying out biochemical <b>fluorescence</b> <b>testing.</b> USE - To carry out biochemical <b>fluorescence</b> <b>testing</b> in diverse biochemical interactions, e. g. in fluorescence immuno-testing and investigations decoding plant and animal genomes. ADVANTAGE - A {{very large number of}} individual samples can be examined economically with great sensitivity, and especially-high spatial resolution.

40|$|Detection of β-lactamase was {{performed}} by the Masuda Test, the Double Disc Synergy Test (DDST), and a novel test developed {{during the course of}} this work for ESBL as follows: Serial dilutions of antibiotics against which enzyme activity is to be demonstrated are incorporated into Mueller-Hinton agar containing methylumbeliferyl-β-D-glucuronide (MUG) 70 μg/mL. Growth of Escherichia coli on this medium gives fluorescence but growth of K. pneumoniae does not. These plates are seeded with an E. coli lawn and K. pneumoniae strains are spot inoculated by Steers Replicator onto the lawn. At antibiotic concentrations above the MIC of E. coli, fluorescence on the lawn is inhibited. On the same plates, satellite growth of E. coli occurs around enzyme-producing K. pneumoniae isolates and this is manifested as a ring of fluorescence. The incorporation into the medium of clavulanic acid indicates if the enzyme is neutralized. In the Series I the K. pneumoniae isolates positive by DDST were also positive by the satellite <b>fluorescence</b> <b>test.</b> None of the isolates were positive by DDST and negative by fluorescence testing. Conclusions are (1) Routine susceptibility tests do not detect ESBL in K. pneumoniae isolates which may be clinically important. (2) The satellite <b>fluorescence</b> <b>test</b> is a more sensitive test than the DDST. (3) This <b>fluorescence</b> <b>test</b> is a convenient, flexible, and sensitive test for screening ESBL production in K. pneumoniae isolates.

40|$|Graduation date: 1966 Studies were {{conducted}} to determine the variability existing in repeated fluorescence tests of annual and perennial ryegrass (Lolium multiflorum and L. perenne, respectively). Sources of variation considered were within-sample error, among-sample error, among-germinator error, and among-laboratory error.

Variability indices were calculated which showed the amount of experimental error observed in <b>fluorescence</b> <b>test</b> results due to each source of variation. These indices showed that the present fluorescence tolerances, based on random sampling from a binomial population and used by the Association of Official Seed Analysts are not adequate {{to account for the}} variability actually existing in repeated <b>fluorescence</b> <b>test</b> results conducted on the same sample in the same laboratory.

30|$|The {{results of}} UV <b>fluorescence</b> <b>tests</b> and their {{in-depth}} study with FLIM {{showed that the}} surfaces of all the examined statues emit relevant and not uniform fluorescence signals. This means that different substances have contaminated the surfaces, probably in past restorations. However, the patterns of the emission {{do not seem to}} be connected to the examined brownish alteration because they do not produce fluorescence emissions with distinctive and homogeneous characteristics. It is important to underline that FLIM allows examination of surfaces only and hence cannot detect substances inside the stone. The lack of correlation between the brownish patterning and the fluorescence results suggested that most substances responsible for the brownish alterations are inside the stone, not on its surface.|$|R
