5|$|From 3 June 1984, the <b>day</b> <b>train</b> {{was moved}} to run via Drammen. Until 1989, the Roa–Hønefoss Line had four daily round trips with a local train from Hønefoss via Roa to Oslo, {{normally}} a Class 65 or Class 67 unit. From 1989, this {{was reduced to a}} single round trip, with a morning train from Hønefoss to Oslo and a return in the afternoon. Eventually this was taken over by a Class 69 unit and by the late 1990s taken out of service. The Roa–Hønefoss Line remains a pure freight track for long-haul freight trains on the Bergen Line. After the opening of the Oslo Tunnel and Oslo Central Station in 1989, passenger trains run via Drammen; however, the Roa–Hønefoss Line is used as a reserve line for passenger trains when the Drammen Line or Randsfjord Line is out of service.|$|E
5|$|All <b>day</b> <b>train</b> {{service was}} {{restored}} from Burlington to Whitby, and peak service was finally brought to Oshawa in 2000, {{but this would}} be only one indicator of things to come. A large initiative to expand the GO Transit network in the mid-2000s under the GO Transit Rail Improvement Plan, or GO TRIP. $1 billion was invested in multiple rail and bus projects, making it the largest commuter rail project in Canadian history. This was later dwarfed by a further slate of new GO infrastructure proposed in MoveOntario 2020, the provincial transit plan announced by Premier Dalton McGuinty in the leadup to the 2007 provincial election. With significant re-investment in regional transit, GO experienced significant growth in its train network: all day service was restored to Oshawa in 2006 and Aldershot in 2007; service was expanded to Barrie South in 2007, to Lincolnville in 2008 and to Kitchener in 2011; and an excursion train now operates on summer weekends to Niagara Falls.|$|E
5|$|With the Empire Builder in operation, Amtrak began re-equipping the {{remaining}} long-distance trains in the west. The second permanent Superliner train was the Desert Wind, then a <b>day</b> <b>train</b> between Los Angeles and Ogden, Utah, which gained coaches on June 30, 1980. The San Francisco Zephyr, a long-distance train {{on the traditional}} Overland Route between Chicago and San Francisco, followed on July 7, 1980; it received {{the first of the}} Sightseer lounges on January 6, 1981. Amtrak assigned Superliners to another long-distance train, the Los Angeles–Chicago Southwest Limited, in October 1980. The Southwest Limited, formerly the Super Chief, traveled the same route as the El Capitan, whose Hi-Level cars had inspired the design. The management of the Santa Fe, impressed by the design, permitted Amtrak to restore the name Chief to the train, and Amtrak renamed it the Southwest Chief on October 28, 1984. The Chief was the first train to receive Superliner II sleeping cars in September 1993.|$|E

25|$|On 5 June 2006, a {{maintenance}} vehicle {{burst into flames}} in the east-bound railway tunnel at about 21:30. Nobody was hurt; its crew of three fled to the other tunnel and escaped. The fire was put out shortly before midnight, and the vehicle {{was removed from the}} tunnel the next <b>day.</b> <b>Train</b> service resumed on 6 June at reduced speed, and normal service was restored on 12 June.|$|E
25|$|Buses connect Kiruna {{with major}} towns in Norrbotten {{province}} and villages nearby {{and in the}} wider region. The railway connects Luleå with Gällivare, Kiruna and Narvik. Although built to serve the mine, Swedish Rail runs daily passenger traffic on the line: a night train from Narvik to Stockholm, a <b>day</b> <b>train</b> from Narvik to Luleå (connecting with a second night train to Stockholm and Gothenburg), and trains to Luleå and Narvik that start and finish in Kiruna. The latter is known as Karven and popular for day trips to the mountains near Abisko, Björkliden and Riksgränsen, particularly in winter. Additional long-distance trains are run by Transdev in summer.|$|E
25|$|NSB again {{considered}} terminating {{passenger transport}} in 1972, {{leading to a}} major local political protest. The closing proposals died down, but returned in 1984. This resulted in a proposal to instead operate the long-distance trains between Trondheim and Oslo on the Røros Line via Solør instead of via Hamar. The sleek curvature would allow for high speeds, and the congestion of the Dovre Line could be cut. After considerable political discussion, Hedmark County Council approved a new bus service between Kongsvinger and Elverum and onwards to Hamar. Local train services were thereby terminated from 1 June 1986, the same day a daily <b>day</b> <b>train</b> and a daily night trains to run.|$|E

25|$|On 7 October 2017, train {{services}} between Ang Mo Kio and Marina South Pier {{stations were}} suspended {{in both directions}} for several hours due to flooding in the tunnels between Braddell and Bishan. A trackside fire between Raffles Place and Marina Bay stations further exacerbated the disruption. Train services between Marina South Pier and Newton were restored at about 9.20pm on the same <b>day.</b> <b>Train</b> services between Newton and Ang Mo Kio were fully resumed at around 2pm the following day. This incident caused a 20-hour service disruption. Investigations revealed that the disruption started during a torrential downpour. A malfunction in the tunnel's water pumping and drainage system caused rainwater to flood the tunnels rapidly.|$|E
25|$|The Attorney General {{appealed the}} ICC's ruling, and this appeal was tried in March 1972, but failed, {{resulting}} in the discontinuation of service from Dover Plains to Chatham on March 20, 1972. Penn Central operated the last southbound passenger train between Chatham and Grand Central Terminal on March 20, 1972, ending service {{in the middle of}} the <b>day.</b> <b>Train</b> 935, which was scheduled to leave Grand Central at 4:25 PM and run to Chatham was cut back to Dover Plains. With no scheduled return trip to Chatham, passengers who had gone south in the morning were left stranded, with service going only as far north as Dover Plains (52 miles shy of Chatham). Tracks were removed north of Millerton shortly thereafter. The cutback of service to Chatham was strongly opposed by the Harlem Valley Transportation Association (HVTA), which was led by Lettie Gay Carson.|$|E

2500|$|Lhasa {{has been}} served by rail since 2006, when the Qinghai–Tibet Railway opened for {{passenger}} operations. Reaching {{an elevation of}} 5,072 metres above sea level, the Qinghai-Tibet railway is the world's highest railway by elevation. It connects Lhasa with Xining, the capital of Qinghai Province, some [...] away, and ultimately links Lhasa with other major cities with China's extensive railway network. Five trains arrive at and depart from Lhasa railway station each <b>day.</b> <b>Train</b> number Z21 takes 40 hours and 53 minutes from Beijing West, arriving in Lhasa at 13:03 every <b>day.</b> <b>Train</b> Z22 from Lhasa to Beijing West departs at 15:30 and arrives in Beijing at 08:20 on the third day, taking 40 hours, 50 minutes. Trains also arrive in Lhasa from Chengdu, Chongqing, Lanzhou, Xining, Guangzhou, Shanghai and other cities. To counter the problem of altitude differences giving passengers altitude sickness, extra oxygen is pumped in through the ventilation system and available directly on each berth with close open control by a flap for convenience of passenger, and personal oxygen masks are available on request. Within the soft sleeper cabins there are 64 seats per train and are well equipped and have a socket to plug electronics. Lhasa is also connected to the second largest city in Tibet, Xigazê, by rail service, since 2014. A third railway, the Sichuan-Tibet Railway, which links Lhasa with Nyingchi County and into the interior ultimately terminating in Chengdu, began construction in June 2015.|$|E
2500|$|The Moldovan {{government}} instituted {{visa requirements}} for Romanian citizens {{and closed the}} border between Romania and Moldova on 7 April. Moldovan students studying in Romania and international journalists {{were not allowed to}} enter the country. The following <b>day,</b> <b>train</b> connections between Romania and Moldova were cancelled for undefined period, because of [...] "technical" [...] issues. Romania announced that it will not reciprocate on the expelling of the ambassador and it will keep the same visa regime, with visas free-of-charge for Moldovan citizens.

2500|$|The war had {{damaged or}} {{destroyed}} much of the network; however, [...] of track and 93 stations were in use {{by the end of}} 1945, and the reconstruction was completed in 1950. [...] Nevertheless, the consequent division of Berlin into East and West sectors brought further changes to the U-Bahn. [...] Although the network spanned all sectors, and residents had freedom of movement, West Berliners increasingly avoided the Soviet sector and, from 1953, loudspeakers on the trains gave warnings when approaching the border, where passage of East Germans into the Western sectors also became subject to restrictions imposed by their government. There was a general strike on 17 June 1953 which closed the sections of the Berlin U-Bahn that traveled through East Berlin. Just after the strike, on the following <b>day,</b> <b>train</b> service on the line A was resumed and the service C was resumed to provide connections to Nordbahnhof and Friedrichstraße.|$|E

60|$|Nobody inquired how Pete and Hiram came by the news. Nobody {{asked how}} they had {{happened}} to notice that the shanty was empty and the safe rifled. All they thought of was how to catch and punish the public robber. He must have made for the nearest depôt, Madison Clearing, on the Union Pacific Line, and {{he would take the}} first cars east for St. Louis--that was certain. Every horse in the Pike was promptly requisitioned by the fastest riders, and a rough cavalcade, revolvers in hand, made down the gulch and across the plain, full tilt to Madison. But when, in the garish blaze of early morning, they reached the white wooden depôt in the valley and asked the ticket-clerk whether a man answering to their description had gone on by the east mail at 4.30, the ticket-clerk swore, in reply, that not a soul had left the depôt by any train either way that blessed night. Pete Morris proposed to hold a revolver to his head and force him to confess. But even that strong measure failed to induce a satisfactory retractation. By way of general precaution, two of the boys went on by the <b>day</b> <b>train</b> to St. Louis, but neither of them could hear anything of Captain Pierpoint. Indeed, as a matter of fact, the late manager and present appropriator of the Aylmer's Pike Bank had simply turned his horse's head in the opposite direction, towards the further station at Cheyenne Gap, and had gone westward to San Francisco, intending to make his way back to New York viâ Panama and the Isthmus Railway.|$|E
