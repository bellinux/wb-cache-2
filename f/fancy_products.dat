In the late 18th and early 19th centuries, artists primarily painted portraits, and some landscapes in a style based mainly on English painting.

40|$|Methodology at the {{crossroads}} of the study of artefacts and the study of verbalizations Once upon a time, in the 1990 s, I worked with materialities in a handicraft inventory, eventually to find emotions and life values carried by narratives (Ljungström 1997, in Swedish). When people talk of arts and crafts today, they are hardly expected to deal with important matters of life. Still, by listening carefully, we may find that they do so in a way. If there is a dilemma involved, people {{will be more likely to}} tell a story than to make a statement. My project was to see how they did this and what it meant. The objects may not be like the <b>fancy</b> <b>products</b> in a gift shop, the narrated context may seem trivial to outsiders, the event may be a dramatic episode, but this may not necessarily be the case if there is a moral dimension to be considered. Personal experience narratives, told as an aside, by the way, may be of deep concern. The stories may be carried by emotions and the narrator may be more inspired and the listener more touched when they are communicated alongside the focus, at the moment and in no need of defence.

The performance of PT. TMA was decreased. That performance {{in the last five}} years worsen, because the enterprise had negative gross profit margin which was not proportional to interest burden.

30|$|One of {{the visible}} effects of the crisis was {{the decline in the}} market for complex {{derivative}} instruments. Hybrid <b>products,</b> <b>fancy</b> exotic options, and cross-asset structured securities lost most of their appeal, both because they were often seen as unnecessary and excessively risky by clients, and because they became uneconomical for banks, as capital, funding, and regulatory compliance eroded profits. However, Figs.  1 and 2, which also comprise papers on these topics, seem to suggest there has been only a moderate decline in research on derivatives pricing. This is because volatility, smile dynamics, and correlation modelling have been inspiring new ideas, such as modelling swap rates’ volatility (Rheinlaender, 2015) and local or stochastic correlation models (see, for example, Langnau, 2010 and Zetocha, 2015) and the trend is unlikely to end soon.|$|R

We can’t have fine gentlemen any more, because we can’t have the society in which they lived.

40|$|There are two Eilenberg-Moore {{spectral}} sequences that {{we shall}} consider, one for homology {{and the other for}} cohomology. In contrast with the situation for the Serre spectral sequence, for the Eilenberg-Moore spectral sequences the homology and cohomology versions arise in two different topological settings, although the two settings are in a sense dual. Both versions share the same underlying algebra, however, involving Tor functors. The first occurrence of a Tor functor in algebraic topology is in the universal coefficient theorem. Here one has a group Tor(A, B) associated to abelian groups A and B which measures the common torsion of A and B. The formal definition of Tor(A, B) in terms of tensor products and free resolutions extends naturally from the context of abelian groups to that of modules over an arbitrary ring, and the result is a sequence of functors Tor R n (A, B) for modules A and B over a ring R. In case R is a principal ideal domain such as Z the groups Tor R n (A, B) happen to be zero for n> 1, (A, B) is the Tor(A, B) in the universal coefficient theorem. This same Tor functor appears also in the general form of the Künneth formula for the homology groups of a product X ×Y. The Eilenberg-Moore spectral sequences can be regarded as generalizations of the Künneth formula to <b>fancier</b> kinds of <b>products</b> where extra structure is involved. The rings R that arise need not be principal ideal domains, so the Torn groups can be nonzero for large n...|$|R
40|$|FANCY YARN is a yarn with {{deliberate}} imperfections. Strange {{as it may}} appear, {{in present}} times when defect-free yarn {{is considered to be}} a premium <b>product,</b> <b>fancy</b> yarns, with all their imperfections, are also in demand. It is a different matter that the volume production of fancy yarn is insignificant in comparison to the normal yarn production. The demand for fancy yarns is due to the special aesthetic appeal it imparts to the fabric made using such fancy yarns. Fabrics produced using fancy yarn find applications in normal and high-fashion clothing, curtains, carpets, upholstery fabrics, as a base for "effect" wallpaper manufacture and many more. Ring spinning is successfully employed to manufacture fancy yarn. Rotor spinning, which offers economical benefits over ring spinning, has also been employed to produce fancy yarn. A number of ideas have been applied in practice to produce fancy yarn on rotor spinning machines. The approach of these conventional devices has been to control the speeds of the mechanical elements of the rotor spinning machine. Because the rotor spinning machine is a very high speed spinning machine, with the latest ones having rotor speeds of over 100 000 rpm, the conventional devices become limited in their approach, not application. A new approach is therefore necessary to produce fancy yarn on rotor spinning machines. This work is a new approach in that direction. The principal idea is to affect the fibre flow without altering the speeds of the mechanical elements of a rotor spinning machine. To bring about this influence of the fibre flow, pressurized air has been employed for the first time. The concept of using pressurized air not only offers a new alternative to produce fancy yarn on rotor spinning machines, but also offers a simple and relatively inexpensive route to fancy yarn manufacture. Hence, this approach has been referred to as pressurized air method of producing fancy yarn. The fibres flowing in the fibre transport channel of the rotor spinning box are affected by pressurized air. This influence of the flowing fibres by the pressurized air causes the effects or the imperfections in the yarn being spun to result in a fancy yarn. The duration of the time the pressurized air is applied to affect the fibre flow, influence the characteristics of the effects such as thickness, length and appearance. By programming the pressurized air blowing time, effects can be produced in a predetermined way. In this way the need to alter highly frequently the speeds of the mechanical elements of a rotor spinning machine is obviated. As with the conventional methods employed on rotor spinning machines in the production of fancy yarns, the pressurized air method also has its own limitations. While the conventional methods can only produce effect lengths longer than the rotor circumference, the pressurized air method can only produce effect length shorter than the rotor circumference. But by combining the conventional method and the pressurized air method, the shortcomings of the two methods can be overcome in a unique way. This work, being the first of its kind, provides a fairly comprehensive understanding of the concept of using pressurized air in the production of fancy yarns on rotor spinning machines...|$|R
