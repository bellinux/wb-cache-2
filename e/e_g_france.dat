40|$|AbstractAll animals acquire {{knowledge}} about the topography of their immediate environment through direct exploration. Uniquely, humans also acquire geographical knowledge indirectly through exposure to maps and verbal information, resulting in a rich database of global geographical knowledge. We used transcranial magnetic stimulation to investigate the structure and neural basis of this critical but poorly understood component of semantic knowledge. Participants completed tests of geographical knowledge that probed either information about spatial locations (<b>e.</b> <b>g.,</b> <b>France</b> borders Spain) or non-spatial taxonomic information (<b>e.</b> <b>g.,</b> <b>France</b> is a country). TMS applied to the anterior temporal lobe, a region that codes conceptual knowledge for words and objects, had a general disruptive effect on the geographical tasks. In contrast, stimulation of the intraparietal sulcus (IPS), a region involved in the coding of spatial and numerical information, had a highly selective effect on spatial geographical decisions but no effect on taxonomic judgements. Our results establish that geographical concepts lie {{at the intersection of}} two distinct neural representation systems, and provide insights into how the interaction of these systems shape our understanding of the world...|$|E

40|$|This paper {{finds that}} the {{distribution}} functions of factor usage intensities differ systematically among 10 rich OECD countries {{in a manner consistent}} with the multiplecone version of the factor proportions theory. The estimation works even if the same industry codes represent different goods across countries in the data. In the framework of frictionless models, there are at least 3 diversification cones among these countries (including, <b>e.</b> <b>g.</b> UK, <b>France</b> and US in different cones). Trade costs need to be high (40 % ~ 70 % on ad valorem basis) to invalidate the multiple-cone finding and even higher to account for all the observed differences in factor usage intensities (60 % ~ 100 % on ad valorem basis). These high trade costs illustrate how badly factor price equalization is violated for the 10 OECD countries. Both multiple cones with zero or low trade costs and a single cone with high trade costs suggest that factor market linkages are weak between the countries identified as being in different cones (<b>e.</b> <b>g.</b> UK, <b>France</b> and US).

In particular, the possibility of childless couples, and hence of bequests from relatives other than parents (i. e., "collateral bequests") is considered. Within such a setting, two questions are raised. First, do collateral bequests increase the distributional inequality of wealth? Second, should one adopt inheritance tax rates that depend on the inheritor's blood relationship to the donor? In other words, does there exist an economic justification for differential inheritance taxation such as it is usual in many countries (<b>e.</b> <b>g.</b> <b>France</b> and Germany). ...|$|E

40|$|We {{describe}} a quantitative and comparative {{review of a}} selection of European birthweight standards for gestational age for singletons, to enable appropriate choices {{to be made for}} clinical and research use. Differences between median values at term across standards in 10 regions and misclassification of ‘small for gestational age’ (SGA), were studied. Sex and parity differences, exclusion criteria, and methods of construction were considered. There was wide variation between countries in exclusion criteria, methods of calculating standards, and median birthweight at term. The lightest standards (<b>e.</b> <b>g.</b> <b>France's</b> medians are 255 g lower than Norway's medians) were associated with fewer exclusion criteria. Up to 20 % of the population used {{in the construction of the}} Scottish standard would be classified as SGA using the Norwegian standard. Substantial misclassification of SGA is possible. Assumptions about variation used in the construction of some standards were not justified. It is not possible to conclude that there are real differences in birthweight standards between European countries. Country-based standards control for some population features but add misclassification due to the differing ways in which standards are derived. Standards should be chosen to reflect clinical or research need. If standards stratified by sex or parity are not available, adjustments should be made. In multinational studies, comparisons should be made between results using both a common standard and country-based standards...|$|R

This paper makes an assessment of feasible options to improve finance access of SMEs, available to EU institutions {{as well as to}} the ECB in the context of its price stability mandate. Because of non-negligible moral hazard issues, the paper is sceptical about a stronger involvement of the ECB in the (indirect) financing of SMEs through the securitisation of banks`loans or their use as collateral for monetary policy operations.

At the aggregate level, individual investors prefer stocks with lottery features, and like lottery demand, the demand for lottery-type stocks increases during economic downturns. In the cross-section, socioeconomic factors that induce greater expenditure in lotteries are associated with greater investment in lottery-type stocks. Further, lottery investment levels are higher in regions with favorable lottery environments. Because lottery-type stocks underperform, gambling-related underperformance is greater among low-income investors who excessively overweight lottery-type stocks.

Confronting these spatial patterns with biophysical and socio-economic drivers revealed two strong gradients structuring European ES bundles, climate and land use intensity. Variations in the diversity of ES bundles provided across administrative units (NUTS 2), quantified by the Shannon diversity index, tend to be higher in forested regions (<b>e.</b> <b>g.</b> SE Romania) and in the mosaic landscapes in the central EU 27 (from eastern France to Austria).

In this paper we investigate whether these differences in Internet reporting policies might be due to cultural differences in corporate reporting. According to Hofstede (1980) and Gray (1988), there are cultural differences between distinct groups of countries in Europe. The accounting frameworks of European countries are merely classified as more developed Latin (<b>e.</b> <b>g.</b> Belgium, <b>France),</b> Anglo (<b>e.</b> <b>g.</b> UK, Ireland), Germanic (<b>e.</b> <b>g.</b> Germany, Austria) and Nordic (Netherlands, Denmark). Since corporate reporting on the Internet is typically voluntary, the secretiveness of these different cultural groups may influence Internet reporting practices. Also other culturally related factors like the judicial system (code vs. common law), the shareholder vs. stakeholder approach, … may influence Internet reporting practices. Our sample of 60 companies from the UK, Belgium and Germany tries to give an indication of the main cultural spectrum of Western Europe. All companies are analysed by visiting their websites – if present and traceable.
