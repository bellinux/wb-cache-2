25|$|In the Hostage Case (1947–8), the U.S. {{military}} tribunal seemed {{to limit the}} situations where a commander has a <b>duty</b> <b>to</b> <b>know</b> to instances where he has already had some information regarding subordinates' unlawful actions.|$|E
500|$|Manstein's defence, {{led by the}} {{prominent}} lawyer Reginald Thomas Paget, argued that the order was justified because many partisans were Jews and so Manstein's order calling for all Jews to be executed was justified, by his desire to protect his men from partisan attacks. He argued that Manstein was not compelled to disobey orders given by his sovereign government, even if such orders were illegal. Manstein, speaking in his defence, stated that he found the Nazi racial policy to be repugnant. Sixteen other witnesses testified that Manstein {{had no knowledge of}} or involvement in genocide. Paget called the [...] "Russians" [...] "savages", arguing that Manstein showed restraint as a [...] "decent German soldier", in upholding the laws of war when fighting against the [...] "Russians", who displayed the most [...] "appalling savagery". Whether or not Manstein was responsible for the activities of Einsatzgruppe D, a unit not under his direct control but operating in his zone of command, became one of the key points of the trial, the prosecution claimed that it was Manstein's <b>duty</b> <b>to</b> <b>know</b> about the activities of this unit and also his duty {{to put a stop to}} their genocidal operations. Recent scholars, including Ronald Smelser and Benoît Lemay, are of the opinion that he almost certainly perjured himself at his trial and at Nuremberg.|$|E
2500|$|While {{the trustee}} is given legal {{title to the}} trust property, in {{accepting}} the property title, the trustee owes a number of fiduciary duties to the beneficiaries. [...] The primary duties owed include the duty of loyalty, the duty of prudence, the duty of impartiality. A trustee may be held to a very high standard of care in their dealings, in order to enforce their behavior. To ensure beneficiaries receive their due, trustees are subject {{to a number of}} ancillary duties in support of the primary duties, including a duties of openness and transparency; duties of recordkeeping, accounting, and disclosure. [...] In addition, a trustee has a <b>duty</b> <b>to</b> <b>know,</b> understand, and abide by the terms of the trust and relevant law. The trustee may be compensated and have expenses reimbursed, but otherwise must turn over all profits from the trust properties.|$|E

2500|$|The next {{group of}} charges pertained to the {{activities}} of [...] Einsatzgruppe D, a unit not under Manstein's direct control but operating in his zone of command. These charges {{became one of the}} key points of the trial, as the prosecution argued that it was Manstein's <b>duty</b> <b>to</b> <b>know</b> about {{the activities of}} this unit and his duty {{to put a stop to}} their genocidal operations. The ninth charge included twenty-three counts of ordering and permitting the killing of Jews, Gypsies, and other civilians in Russia by Einsatzgruppe D. Evidence was presented of the deaths of 22,467 Jews in September and 21,185 more in November 1941. The tenth charge alleged that Manstein deliberately ignored his duty to protect the lives of civilians in the areas where his troops were operating, and the eleventh charge detailed seventeen cases where Manstein's troops turned civilians over to the Einsatzgruppe, while knowing full well that to do so would mean their deaths. Carr gave details of the organisation and activities of the Einsatzgruppen, and alleged that Manstein must have known [...] "from start to finish" [...] what was going on, and had assisted them in their activities, in violation of human decency and the Hague Convention.|$|E

2500|$|Hearings {{involving}} [...] "serious sin" [...] {{are performed}} by formal judicial committees, in which guilt and repentance {{are determined by}} a tribunal of elders. A variety of controls can be enforced, from reproof and restriction of congregational <b>duties</b> <b>to</b> excommunication, <b>known</b> as disfellowshipping, which includes shunning by the congregation. Individuals who are disfellowshipped may be reinstated after an extended period if they are deemed to demonstrate repentance. The practice of disfellowshipping has been criticized by many non-members and ex-members.|$|R
5000|$|Some U.S. jurisdictions {{require that}} a person retreat from an attack, and allow the use of deadly force in self-defense only when retreat is not {{possible}} or when retreat poses {{a danger to the}} person under attack. The <b>duty</b> <b>to</b> retreat is not universal, however. For example, police officers are not required to retreat when acting in the line of duty. Similarly, some courts have found no <b>duty</b> <b>to</b> retreat exists when a victim is assaulted in a place where the victim has a right to be, such as within one's own home. [...] The Model Penal Code suggests statutory language that also recognizes an exception <b>to</b> the usual <b>duty</b> <b>to</b> retreat when the victim of the attack is {{in his or her own}} dwelling or place of work. It is common to exempt a person's home or car from the <b>duty</b> <b>to</b> retreat, <b>known</b> as the castle doctrine.|$|R

60|$|It was {{certainly}} a wretched life that he was leading. In the evening he went all alone to an eating-house for his dinner, and then, sitting with a miserable glass of sherry before him, he again read and re-read the epistle which he had written.

And then, was it not his bounden <b>duty</b> <b>to</b> let her <b>know</b> the truth? Yes; it was his <b>duty</b> <b>to</b> be firm.|$|R
60|$|The {{government}} of that kingdom is fundamentally monarchical. The public law of Europe has never recognized in {{it any other}} form of government.

60|$|Thorn {{went up to}} {{town and}} one evening loitered about the hall of his club.

It was, in a sense, one's <b>duty</b> <b>to</b> <b>know</b> what was going on, and the news he picked up helped him to look well informed. Thorn had not much imagination, but he was cautious, calculating, and {{generally}} saw where his advantage lay. His small estate was managed well, in general his tenants liked him, and his investments were sound. Nevertheless, he was dissatisfied; he had waited long for Grace Osborn, and feared that in spite of her father's approval he got no nearer her.|$|E

6000|$|For {{months it}} was thought that Lady Elizabeth would follow her boy. Sir Harry bore the blow bravely, though none who do not {{understand}} the system well can conceive how the natural grief of the father was increased by the disappointment which had fallen upon the head of the house. But the old man bore it well, making but few audible moans, shedding no tears, altering in very little the habits of life; still spending money, because it was good for others that it should be spent, and only speaking of his son when it was necessary for him to allude to those altered arrangements as to the family property which it was necessary that he should make. But still he was a changed man, as those perceived who watched him closest. Cloudesdale the butler knew well in what he was changed, as did old Hesketh the groom, and Gilsby the gamekeeper. He had never been given to much talk, but was now more silent than of yore. Of horses, dogs, and game there was no longer any mention whatever made by the Baronet. He was still constant with Mr. Lanesby, the steward, because it was his <b>duty</b> <b>to</b> <b>know</b> everything that was done on the property; but even Mr. Lanesby would acknowledge that, as to actual improvements,--the commencement of new work in the hope of future returns, the Baronet was not at all the man he had been.

[...] This principle, which, like the rest, is as true of nations as of individual men, has bestowed on the grand vicinage of Europe a <b>duty</b> <b>to</b> <b>know</b> and a right to prevent any capital innovation which may amount to the erection of a dangerous nuisance.[32] Of the importance of that innovation, and the mischief of that nuisance, they are, to be sure, bound to judge not litigiously: but it is in their competence to judge. They have uniformly acted on this right. What in civil society is a ground of action in politic society is a ground of war. But the exercise of that competent jurisdiction is a matter of moral prudence. As suits in civil society, so war in the political, must ever be a matter of great deliberation. It is not this or that particular proceeding, picked out here and there, as a subject of quarrel, that will do. There must be an aggregate of mischief. There must be marks of deliberation; there must be traces of design; there must be indications of malice; there must be tokens of ambition. There must be force in the body where they exist; there must be energy in the mind. When all these circumstances combine, or the important parts of them, the duty of the vicinity calls for the exercise of its competence: and the rules of prudence do not restrain, but demand it.|$|E
40|$|In The Metaphysics of Morals, Kant {{claims that}} “the first command” of all self-regarding <b>duties</b> is <b>to</b> <b>know</b> our “heart. ” Kant ostensibly {{identifies}} our heart with our moral disposition.

While the more sophisticated attempts to resolve this difficulty succeed in situating an injunction <b>to</b> <b>know</b> the quality of one’s disposition within a Kantian epistemic framework, no account is wholly successful in explaining why Kant takes self-knowledge to be a necessary condition of virtue. To make sense of the priority Kant assigns to the pursuit of self-knowledge, I argue that it is essential to understand the role of what has been called “generic” self-knowledge in Kant’s moral philosophy. I proceed to defend the place Kant grants moral self-knowledge in his moral philosophy, primarily by developing a Kantian account of such “generic” self-knowledge...|$|R
