5000|$|There are {{a number}} of cost/efficiency {{advantages}} to bioremediation, which can be employed in areas that are inaccessible without excavation. For example, hydrocarbon spills (specifically, petrol spills) or certain chlorinated solvents may contaminate groundwater, and introducing the appropriate electron acceptor or electron donor amendment, as appropriate, may significantly reduce contaminant concentrations after a long time allowing for acclimation. This is typically much less expensive than excavation followed by disposal elsewhere, incineration or other <b>ex</b> <b>situ</b> <b>treatment</b> strategies, and reduces or eliminates the need for [...] "pump and treat", a practice common at sites where hydrocarbons have contaminated clean groundwater. Using archaea for bioremediation of hydrocarbons also has the advantage of breaking down contaminants at the molecular level, as opposed to simply chemically dispersing the contaminant.|$|E

In other areas, it may be taken to a landfill {{or it may be}} illegally dumped somewhere unknown, to avoid charges. This unmonitored disposal process is not only harmful for our environment and our health, but it also hurts businesses which have no idea where their business waste ends up, or indeed how much liquid waste is in their grease interceptors at any point in time, leaving them vulnerable to illegal dumping into their own grease traps or interceptors. Some companies now market computerized monitoring services along with in situ bioremediation, which produces byproducts of CO2 and gray water that can safely flow into sewer systems. Other new technologies offer <b>ex</b> <b>situ</b> <b>treatment</b> to process brown grease into some form of transportation fuel. This may not be as environmentally friendly as in situ treatment, since it still requires vehicles to pump and transport the brown grease waste to the plants.|$|E

40|$|Metals {{and organic}} {{contaminants}} {{are common in}} many marine and fresh water environments {{as a result of}} industrial and military activities. Traditional remediation/risk management options for sediments contaminated with these materials include no action, monitored natural recovery, institutional controls (land use restrictions, etc.), in situ treatment and management, and <b>ex</b> <b>situ</b> <b>treatment</b> and management. Active capping is a newer approach for treating contaminated sediments that involves applying chemically reactive amendments to the sediment surface. The mobile, soluble forms of contaminants are generally considered toxic. Induced chemical precipitation of these metals can shift toxic metals from the aqueous phase to a solid, precipitated phase which is often less bioavailable. This can be achieved through the application of sequestering agents such as rock phosphates, organoclays, zeolites, clay minerals, and biopolymers (e. g., chitosan) in active caps. Active caps can stabilize contaminants in contaminated sediments, lower the bioavailable pool of contaminants, and reduce the release of contaminants to the water column thereby providing an economical and effective alternative to traditional treatments...|$|E
40|$|The goal of {{this project}} is to {{demonstrate}} the technical and economic feasibility of commercializing a biotechnology that uses plants to remediate soils, sediments, surface waters, and groundwaters contaminated by heavy metals and radionuclides. This technology, known as phytoremediation, is particularly suited to remediation of soils or water where low levels of contaminants are widespread. Project objectives are to provide an accurate estimate of the capability and rate of phytoremediation for removal of contaminants of concern from soils and groundwaters at Department of Energy (DOE) sites and to develop data suitable for engineering design and economic feasibility evaluations, including methods for destruction or final disposition of plants containing contaminants of concern. The bioremediation systems being evaluated could be less expensive than soil removal and treatment systems, given the areal extent and topography of sites under consideration and the investment of energy and money in soil-moving and -treating processes. In situ technology may receive regulatory acceptance more easily than <b>ex</b> <b>situ</b> <b>treatments</b> requiring excavation, processing, and replacement of surface soils. In addition, phytoremediation may be viable for cleanup of contaminated waters, either as the primary treatment or the final polishing stage, depending on the contaminant concentrations and process economics considerations...|$|R
40|$|We used a {{controlled}} CO 2 perturbation experiment to test hypotheses {{about changes in}} diversity, composition and structure of soft-bottom intertidal macrobenthic assemblages, under realistic and locally relevant scenarios of seawater acidification. Patches of undisturbed sediment were collected from 2 types of intertidal sedimentary habitat in the Ria Formosa coastal lagoon (South Portugal) and exposed to 2 levels of seawater acidification (pH reduced by 0. 3 and 0. 6 units) and 1 unmanipulated (control) level. After 75 d the assemblages differed significantly between the 2 types of sediment and between field controls and the <b>ex</b> <b>situ</b> <b>treatments,</b> but not among the 3 pH levels tested. The naturally high values of total alkalinity buffered seawater from the changes imposed on carbonate chemistry and {{may have contributed to}} offsetting acidification at the local scale. Observed differences on biota were strongly related to the organic matter content and grain-size of the sediments, particularly to the fractions of medium and coarse sand. Soft-bottom intertidal macrofauna was significantly affected by the stress of being held in an artificial environment, but not by CO 2 -induced seawater acidification. Given the previously observed variations in the sensitivities of marine organisms to seawater acidification, direct extrapolations of the present findings to different regions or other types of assemblages do not seem advisable.

The paper reports the chelant-assisted extraction of the toxic metals (Cd, Cu, Pb, and Zn) from the metal-spiked European reference soils (Eurosoil 1 and Eurosoil 4) using biodegradable APCs, namely EDDS, GLDA, and HIDS. The effects of chelant-to-metal molar ratio, solution pH, and metal/chelant stability constants were evaluated, and {{compared with that of}} EDTA. The selectivity aptitude of the biodegradable chelants towards the toxic metals was assumed from the speciation calculations, and a proportionate correlation was observed at neutral pH. Pre- and post-extractive solid phase distributions of the target metals were defined using the sequential extraction procedure and dissolution of metals from the theoretically immobilized fraction was witnessed.

40|$|This work {{is focused}} on the {{development}} of an innovative synthetic route to SiO 2 -sandwiched Au nanoparticle arrays. The adopted strategy consists of: (i) the radio frequency sputtering of gold on thermally oxidized Si(100) and silica substrates from Ar plasmas; (ii) the plasma enhanced chemical vapor deposition of a SiO 2 overlayer using tetramethoxysilane as precursor from Ar–O 2 plasmas. A common feature of both preparative stages is the use of very soft processing conditions at temperatures close to room temperature, in order to tailor the Au nanoparticle morphology and to preserve it upon SiO 2 coverage. In situ monitoring of gold deposition was accomplished by means of laser reflection interferometry. Valuable information on the system morphology before and after SiO 2 coverage was provided by field emission-scanning electron microscopy for samples with different Au content. Additional important information on the system chemical composition, structure and optical response was gained by the combined use of x-ray photoelectron spectroscopy, glancing incidence x-ray diffraction and UV–visible absorption spectroscopy. The results obtained highlight the formation of high-purity SiO 2 /Au/SiO 2 -sandwiched stacks, in which the gold content and distribution, as well as the nanoparticle morphology, could be tailored by the sole variation of the sputtering time, without any further <b>ex</b> <b>situ</b> <b>treatment...</b>|$|E

The influence of bioremediation on leaching of oil from the soil was also investigated. The studies demonstrated the benefits of biostimulation to overcome nutrient limitation, as most of the soils were nutrient depleted. The application of both liquid and pelleted slow-release N and P fertilizers increased both the hydrocarbon biodegradation rates (by a factor of 1. 4 to 2. 9) and the percentage of hydrocarbon mass degraded (by > 30 % after 12 weeks and 80 % after 37 weeks), when compared with the unamended soils. Slow-release fertilizers can be particularly useful when multiple liquid applications are not practical or cost-effective. Bioaugmentation products containing inoculum plus fertilizer also increased biodegradation by 20 % to 37 % compared with unamended biotic controls; however, there was no clear evidence of additional benefits due to the inocula, compared with fertilizer alone. Therefore biostimulation is seen as the most cost-effective bioremediation strategy for contaminated soils with the levels of crude oil and refined products used in this study.

Two types of soils were used, Soil A which had been recently polluted and the aged Soil B. They contained 52. 4 and 50. 4 g of total petroleum hydrocarbons per kg of dry soil, respectively. The effect of passing a continuous small stream of air containing a low concentration of gaseous toluene through packed 0. 5 l (∅ = 5. 5 cm) columns was studied. For Soil A, after 62 days the THPs degradation was 28 % higher in the toluene treated columns than in controls. In aged Soil B the effect of toluene was not significant, probably due to bioavailability limitations. With Soil B, the combined effect of toluene as cosubstrate and a surfactant pretreatment was studied and the hydrocarbons degradation was 29 % higher in the toluene-amended columns than in the controls. Toluene removal was higher than 99 % in all cases. Surfactant addition increased hydrocarbon degradation when toluene was also added suggesting that the biological reaction was the limiting process.

Some experiments were conducted at 20 C and others at 50 C. After times ranging from 11 to 24 days, these experiments were opened, photographed and the soil was sampled from discrete locations in the containers.

Conversely, closer to the treatment rod containing SPC, concentrations of Hg were significantly increased over the original concentration. Preliminary results for elevated temperature sample are shown graphically in Figure 2. Apparently the Hg had migrated toward the SPC and reacted with sulfur to form Hg S.

Two types of silica- and alumina-containing iron (hydr) oxide catalysts were synthesized by sol-gel processing techniques (Chapter 2). Relative to iron oxides, such as hematite and goethite, these catalysts were 10 to 80 times more effective in catalyzing the production of * OH from H 2 O 2 under circumneutral conditions. The higher efficiency makes these catalysts promising candidates for ex situ advanced oxidation processes. Moreover, because alumina and silica alter the reactivity of the iron oxides with H 2 O 2, understanding the activity of iron associated with natural aluminosilicates and silica-containing minerals in the subsurface is crucial to explaining the variability of * OH production observed in in situ treatment systems. 	In addition to the sol-gel technique used in Chapter 2, silica-containing iron (hydr) oxide catalysts were synthesized by immobilizing iron oxide onto mesoporous silica supports, such as SBA- 15 (Chapter 5). The iron-containing SBA- 15 was 10 times more effective than iron oxides in catalyzing the production of * OH from H 2 O 2. Moreover, this catalyst could be employed for selective oxidation of small organic contaminants based on size exclusion. However, a major drawback of the mesoporous silica-based catalysts is their instability under circumneutral conditions (Chapter 6). The dissolution of mesoporous silica materials raises questions about their use for water treatment, because silica dissolution might compromise the behavior of the material. 	To gain insight into factors that control H 2 O 2 persistence and * OH yield in in situ processes, the {{decomposition of}} H 2 O 2 and transformation of contaminants were investigated in the presence of iron-containing minerals and aquifer materials (Chapter 3). Consistent with the observation described in Chapter 2, iron-containing aluminosilicates were more effective than iron oxides in converting H 2 O 2 into * OH. In both iron-containing mineral and aquifer material systems, the yield of *OH was inversely correlated with the rate of H 2 O 2 decomposition. In the aquifer material systems, the yield also inversely correlated with the Mn content, consistent with the fact that the decomposition of H 2 O 2 on manganese oxides does not produce * OH. The inverse correlation between Mn content and H 2 O 2 loss rate and * OH yield suggests that the amount of Mn in aquifer materials could serve as a proxy for predicting H 2 O 2 decomposition rates and contaminant oxidation efficiency. 	In addition to the surface and structure properties of iron solids, the presence of solutes, such as dissolved silica, also affected the decomposition of H 2 O 2 (Chapter 4). The adsorption of dissolved silica onto mineral surfaces altered the catalytic sites, thereby decreasing the reactivity of iron- and manganese-containing minerals with H 2 O 2. Therefore, the presence of dissolved SiO 2 could lead to greater persistence of H 2 O 2 in groundwater, which should be considered in the design of in situ H 2 O 2 -based treatment systems. In addition to in situ treatment, dissolved silica also can affect the reactivity of iron-containing catalysts used in ex situ processes. Therefore, its presence in contaminated industrial wastewater should be considered when <b>ex</b> <b>situ</b> <b>treatment</b> systems are designed...|$|E
40|$|Growing {{stockpiles}} of industrial liquid waste stored in lagoons are an outstanding problem worldwide. Self-sustaining Treatment for Active Remediation (STAR) is an emerging technology based on smouldering combustion {{that has been}} successfully deployed for in situ remediation of field sites (Grant et al., 2016). STAR is currently being developed as an <b>ex</b> <b>situ</b> <b>treatment</b> system (STARx) for industrial wastes by intentionally mixing them with sand. One engineering concept for STARx is the “hotpad”, for which some initial experiments have been conducted. However, a thorough experimental investigation is challenging due to the cost and time associated with each experiment. This work employed a two-dimensional (vertical cross-section) numerical model to systematically explore sensitivity of STARx hotpad performance to system design, operational parameters, and environmental factors. The phenomenological model that was used uniquely combines a multiphase flow code and a front expansion routine (MacPhee et al., 2012; Hasan et al., 2015). First, the model was calibrated and validated against pilot-scale (~ 2 m width) hotpad experiments, providing confidence that the rate and extent of treatment were correctly predicted. Pilot-scale simulations then investigated the sensitivity of system performance to: injected airflow rate, organic liquid concentration, hotpad configuration, system dimensions, heterogeneity of intrinsic permeability, and heterogeneity of organic liquid concentration. The expected performance of two field-scale configurations (~ 10 m width) was also explored. Hotpad performance is predicted to be most sensitive to the injected air flux, with higher air fluxes achieving higher rates of organic liquid destruction and treating larger fractions of the initial mass. The uniformity of the advancing smouldering front was predicted to be highly dependent on the effective permeability ratio between untreated and treated materials. As a result, increased heterogeneity – of intrinsic permeability in particular – is predicted to degrade remedial performance. Full-scale systems were predicted to achieve treatment rates {{an order of magnitude}} higher than the pilot-scale for a similar organic liquid concentration and injected air flux. It is anticipated that this work will increase understanding of several key processes that impact STARx performance and help optimize hotpad design and operation...|$|E

Potential exists for OSPW toxicity to be mitigated by aerobic degradation of the NAs by microorganisms indigenous to the oil sands tailings ponds, the success of which is dependent on the methods used to exploit the metabolisms of the environmental microbial community. Having hypothesized that the xenobiotic tolerant biofilm mode-of-life may represent a feasible way to harness environmental microbes for <b>ex</b> <b>situ</b> <b>treatment</b> of OSPW NAs, we aerobically grew OSPW microbes as single and mixed species biofilm and planktonic cultures under various conditions for the purpose of assaying their ability to tolerate and degrade NAs. The NAs evaluated were a diverse mixture of 8 commercially available model compounds. Confocal microscopy confirmed the ability of mixed and single species OSPW cultures to grow as biofilms {{in the presence of the}} NAs evaluated. qPCR enumeration demonstrated that the addition of supplemental nutrients at concentrations of 1 g L- 1 resulted in a more numerous population than 0. 001 g L- 1 supplementation by approximately 1 order of magnitude. GC-FID analysis revealed that mixed species cultures (regardless of the mode of growth) are the most effective at degrading the NAs tested. All constituent NAs evaluated were degraded below detectable limits with the exception of 1 -Adamantane carboxylic acid (ACA); subsequent experimentation with ACA as the sole NA also failed to exhibit degradation of this compound. Single species cultures degraded select few NA compounds. The degradation trends highlighted many structure-persistence relationships among the 8 NAs tested, demonstrating the effect of side chain configuration and alkyl branching on compound recalcitrance. Of all the isolates, the Rhodococcus spp. degraded the greatest number of NA compounds, although still less than the mixed species cultures. Overall, these observations lend support to the notion that harnessing a community of microorganisms as opposed to targeted isolates can enhance NA degradation ex situ. Moreover, the variable success caused by NA structure related persistence emphasized the difficulties associated with employing bioremediation to treat complex, undefined mixtures of toxicants such as OSPW NAs...|$|E

Single and multi-step processes, carried out either in the plasma chamber (one-step and two-step processes) or <b>ex</b> <b>situ</b> after plasma <b>treatment,</b> were explored to optimise the grafting efficiency. The mechanical properties of the grafted cotton were substantially unaffected. Grafting with XFDMA gave good results only when the plasma activation was performed on monomer-impregnated fabrics, as shown by gravimetry, ATR FT-IR spectroscopy, and water and oil repellence tests. On the contrary, with HEMA better results were obtained by in situ grafting from monomer vapour...|$|R

By investigation of hexagonal SiC surfaces the importance of atomic surface structure {{for control of the}} respective growth processes involved is elucidated. Dierent reconstruction phases prepared by <b>ex</b> <b>situ</b> hydrogen <b>treatment</b> or by Si deposition and annealing in vacuum were analyzed using scanning tunnel-ing microscopy (STM), Auger electron spectroscopy (AES) and low-energy electron diraction (LEED) crystallography. The extremely ecient dangling bond saturation of the SiC(0001) -(33) phase allows step flow growth for monocrystalline homoepitaxial layers. A switch to cubic layer stacking can be induced on hexagonal SiC(0001) samples when a (p 3 p 3) R 30 phase is prepared. This might serve as seed for polytype heterostructures. Finally, we succeeded in preparing an epitaxially well matching silicon oxide monolayer with (p 3 p 3) R 30 periodicity on both SiC(0001) and SiC(0001). This initial layer promises to facilitate low defect density oxide lms for MOS devices. 1...|$|R
