5000|$|... (Original {{description}} by W.H. Dall) The {{shell is}} higher (6 mm) than broad (5 mm). The shell resembles Seguenzia certoma Dall, 1919, {{but it is}} larger and differently sculptured. The minute nucleus is smooth, subglobular followed by seven sculptured whorls. The obscure suture is laid on the peripheral keel. The spiral sculpture shows four narrow prominent keels, of which the second is peripheral, the third marginates the base, and the fourth is on the base, the <b>interspaces</b> much wider and becoming narrower anteriorly. There are also seven closer even low threads on the base with subequal <b>interspaces.</b> The posterior wide <b>interspaces</b> are sculptured with close-set fine spiral thread. The axial sculpture shows numerous equal and equally spaced arcuate threads, with wide <b>interspaces,</b> which on the upper whorls bead the posterior carina, but later are chiefly visible in the <b>interspaces</b> and extend over the whole shell. The sulcus at the aperture next the body is shallow. The outer lip beyond it is moderatelyproduced and crenulate by the sculpture. The thin and arcuate columella has a very small notch at its base. There is a deep twisted perforate umbilicus and {{a thin layer of}} enamel on the body.|$|R
25|$|Male upperside black. Forewing {{with the}} {{following}} green markings: a spot at the extreme base of the costal margin, a transverse short bar near base of cell and seven spots beyond, two and two except the apical spot which is single; two spots beyond apex of cell; a spot at base of interspaces 1a and 1, followed by two oblique short macular bands; a discal series of spots decreasing in size towards the costa, and a postdiscal series of smaller spots that begins with two in <b>interspace</b> 1; the spots in <b>interspace</b> 7 in both series are out of line, placed outwards. Hindwing: three series of similarly-coloured markings that ran transversely across the wing more or less parallel to the dorsal margin, the upper markings (those in <b>interspace</b> 7) white; a short greenish stripe at the extreme base of the wing.|$|E
25|$|Female: Hindwing: {{the black}} on the costal margin as in cerberus, {{but there is}} always a large yellow spot at base of <b>interspace</b> 7; <b>interspace</b> 1 black, with a pale patch in the middle; the black {{terminal}} border broader, the inwardly extended cone-shaped markings prominent, those in interspaces 2 and 3 with pale buff lateral edgings, extended inwards to the postdiscal spots. In both male and female the hindwing on the upperside is clothed with soft, silky, long brownish-black hairs from base along the dorsal area.|$|E

40|$|In {{contrast}} to the conventional theory, the external and internal intercostal muscles show marked rostrocaudal gradients in their actions on the lung. We hypothesized that these gradients {{are the result of}} a non-uniform coupling between the ribs and the lung. Rib displacements (Xr) and the changes in airway opening pressure (Pa,o) were thus measured in anaesthetized, pancuronium-treated, supine dogs while loads were applied in the cranial direction to individual pairs of odd-numbered ribs and in the caudal direction to individual pairs of even-numbered ribs. During cranial loading, Xr induced by a given load increased gradually with increasing rib number. The decrease in Pa,o also increased from the third to the fifth rib pair but then decreased markedly to the eleventh pair. A similar pattern was observed during caudal loading, although Xr and ΔPa,o were smaller. These results were then combined to calculate the net Xr and the net ΔPa,o that a hypothetical intercostal muscle lying parallel to the longitudinal body axis would produce in different <b>interspaces.</b> The net Xr was cranial in all <b>interspaces.</b> However, whereas the net ΔPa,o was negative in the cranial <b>interspaces,</b> it was positive in the caudal <b>interspaces.</b> These observations confirm that the coupling between the ribs and the lung varies from the top {{to the base of the}} ribcage. This coupling confers to both the external and the internal intercostal muscles an inspiratory action on the lung in the cranial <b>interspaces</b> and an expiratory action in the caudal <b>interspaces...</b>|$|R

40|$|A {{prescribed}} burn {{was conducted}} in a juniper woodland approximately 40 km south of Tooele, Utah on 05 October 2006. Conditions were sub-optimal, and the fire did not encroach into mid- or late-successional areas; only the early-successional area burned successfully. This study evaluated {{the effects of the}} prescribed burn on biological soil crusts that occupy the soil surface and are important for soil stability, soil nutrient cycling, and the germination and survival of vascular plants. Biological soil crusts are composed primarily of cyanobacteria, green algae, lichens and mosses. Mosses were rare under juniper trees, so the effects of the fire were negligible; the burn significantly reduced the cover of mosses under sagebrush and in shrub <b>interspaces.</b> Lichens were uncommon under juniper and sagebrush. They were more common in shrub <b>interspaces,</b> but because the fire was spotty and of low intensity in the <b>interspaces,</b> they were minimally affected there. The burn significantly reduced the biomass of green algae and cyanobacteria under juniper and sagebrush; it was unaffected in the shrub <b>interspaces.</b> Similar trends were seen in algal density. This conclusion was confirmed by measurement of the density of green algae and cyanobacteria which also showed a significant decline in juniper and sagebrush understory, but not in the <b>interspaces.</b> Nitrogen fixation was significantly reduced under juniper trees but not under sagebrush or in the <b>interspaces.</b> Nitrogen fixation was approximately an order of magnitude greater in the shrub <b>interspaces</b> than beneath juniper and sagebrush. Because the <b>interspaces</b> were not greatly affected by the burn itself, there was no significant impact on nitrogen fixation there. In general, it appears that, while the burn negatively affected some components of biological soil crusts {{in some parts of the}} early successional stage of the juniper woodland, the overall impact on the crusts was minimal. If the intent of prescribed burning is a reduction in juniper, burning of early successional juniper woodland is appropriate because most affected trees were killed. Control of sagebrush can likewise be accomplished by low intensity, cool season fires without eliminating the crust component. Due to the spotty nature of the fire in the shrub <b>interspaces,</b> where most biological soil crusts occur, they were only minimally affected by the fire and may provide a good source of algal inoculants to re-colonize the soil in the juniper and sagebrush vegetation patch types which were more affected by the fire. The data suggest that intense fires should be avoided due to the potential for greater encroachment into the shrub <b>interspaces</b> which contain the majority of biological soil crust organisms. This information, plus the fact that late successional juniper woodlands are difficult to burn, suggests that burning of early successional juniper may be a preferred method for controlling juniper encroachment on western rangelands...|$|R
