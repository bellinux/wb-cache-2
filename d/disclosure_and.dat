5|$|At its 2010 {{summit in}} Seoul, South Korea, the G-20 collectively {{endorsed}} a new collection of capital adequacy and liquidity standards for banks recommended by Basel III. Andreas Dombret of the Executive Board of Deutsche Bundesbank has noted a difficulty in identifying institutions that constitute systemic importance via their size, complexity, {{and degree of}} interconnectivity within the global financial system, and that efforts {{should be made to}} identify a group of 25 to 30 indisputable globally systemic institutions. He has suggested they be held to standards higher than those mandated by Basel III, and that despite the inevitability of institutional failures, such failures should not drag with them the financial systems in which they participate. Dombret has advocated for regulatory reform that extends beyond banking regulations and has argued in favor of greater transparency through increased public <b>disclosure</b> <b>and</b> increased regulation of the shadow banking system.|$|E
40|$|Executive summary The recent {{financial}} crisis {{resulted in an}} increased attention on the risks of banks and their financial instruments. This article discusses the outcomes of {{a study on the}} quantity and quality of market, credit, <b>and</b> liquidity risk <b>disclosures</b> <b>and</b> the relationship 1) between the quantity <b>and</b> quality of <b>disclosures,</b> 2) between <b>disclosures</b> <b>and</b> bank size, 3) <b>disclosures</b> <b>and</b> bank profitability, <b>and</b> 4) <b>disclosures</b> <b>and</b> time. The 2005 - 2008 annual reports of a sample of German banks are studied <b>and</b> the <b>disclosures</b> are measured by using two disclosure index frameworks. The results provide a sound basis for future research like capital market research, event studies, and behavioral studies in relation to risk disclosures...|$|R

An index of pollution <b>disclosures</b> is developed <b>and</b> correlated with indices of pollution performance and economic performance. The results confirm earlier findings {{that there is no}} association between pollution <b>disclosures</b> <b>and</b> pollution performance. As far as the association between economic performance <b>and</b> pollution <b>disclosures</b> is concerned, the results show that the subgroup of large firms with poor economic performance provides the most detailed pollution information.

5|$|By {{the end of}} 1955, {{thousands}} of political prisoners had returned home, and told their experiences of the gulag labor camps. Continuing investigation into the abuses brought home the full breadth of Stalin's crimes to his successors. Khrushchev believed that once the stain of Stalinism was removed, the Party would inspire loyalty among the people. Beginning in October 1955, Khrushchev fought to tell the delegates to the upcoming 20th Party Congress about Stalin's crimes. Some of his colleagues, including Molotov and Malenkov, opposed the <b>disclosure,</b> <b>and</b> managed {{to persuade him to}} make his remarks in a closed session.|$|E
5|$|Still {{the subject}} of {{speculation}} and opprobrium in 1998, Hughes published Birthday Letters that year, his own collection of 88 poems {{about his relationship with}} Plath. Hughes had published very little about his experience of the marriage and Plath's subsequent suicide, and the book caused a sensation, being taken as his first explicit <b>disclosure,</b> <b>and</b> it topped best seller charts. It was not known at the volume's release that Hughes was suffering from terminal cancer and would die later that year. The book {{went on to win the}} Forward Poetry Prize, the T. S. Eliot Prize for Poetry, and the Whitbread Poetry Prize. The poems, written after Plath's death, in some cases long after, try to find a reason why Plath took her own life.|$|E
5|$|Like {{most state}} chief {{executives}} in the United States, the Governor is elected by the citizens of Maryland to serve a four-year term. Under the Constitution of Maryland, the Governor can run any number of times, {{but not more than}} twice in a row. This makes it possible for a two-term governor to run for the office again after remaining out of office for at least one term. An eligible candidate for Governor must be at least 30 years old, and also a resident of and a registered voter in Maryland for the five years preceding the election. If a candidate meets this minimum requirement, he or she must file his or her candidacy with the Maryland State Board of Elections, pay a filing fee, file a financial <b>disclosure,</b> <b>and</b> create a legal campaign financial body. The Governor, like all statewide officials in Maryland, is elected in the even-numbered years in which the election for President of the United States does not occur.|$|E
