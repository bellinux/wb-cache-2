500|$|Wilco {{signed to}} Reprise Records while Son Volt signed with Warner Bros. Records. Son Volt had an early college rock hit with [...] "Drown" [...] from the album Trace, but Wilco {{maintained}} a more commercially successful {{career in the}} years to follow. Regarding the possibility of a reunion, Mike Heidorn reported in a PopMatters interview that [...] "nothing's ever for sure, but <b>I</b> <b>would</b> <b>have</b> <b>to</b> <b>say,</b> 'No such thing'". Farrar said that he does not want the band to get back together, while Tweedy said that he believes that a reunion would not be productive musically.|$|E
2500|$|When it {{was decided}} to make the movie about his life called Serpico, Al Pacino invited Serpico to stay with him at a house that Pacino had rented in Montauk, New York. When Pacino asked why he had stepped forward, Serpico replied, [...] "Well, Al, I don't know. I guess <b>I</b> <b>would</b> <b>have</b> <b>to</b> <b>say</b> it would be because... if I didn't, who would I be when I listened to a piece of music?" [...] He has {{credited}} his grandfather who had once been assaulted and robbed and his uncle, a respected policeman in Italy, with his sense of justice.|$|E

2500|$|Mitchell's {{work has}} had an {{influence}} on many other artists, including Katy Perry, Ellie Goulding, Corinne Bailey Rae, Gabrielle Aplin, Mikael Åkerfeldt from Opeth, Marillion members Steve Hogarth and Steve Rothery, their former vocalist and lyricist Fish, Paul Carrack, Haim, and Taylor Swift. Madonna has also cited Mitchell as the first female artist that really spoke {{to her as a}} teenager; [...] "I was really, really into Joni Mitchell. I knew every word to Court and Spark; I worshipped her when I was in high school. Blue is amazing. <b>I</b> <b>would</b> <b>have</b> <b>to</b> <b>say</b> of all the women I've heard, she had the most profound effect on me from a lyrical point of view." ...|$|E
2500|$|The {{album was}} a {{farewell}} to Petra's first era of popularity {{and the sound}} it had cultivated with Volz's distinctive vocals. As constant touring took its toll on the band, Hartman and Volz began to disagree about Petra's future, both on stage and off. The tour, while it drew more fans than ever, was expensive, and it left Petra hurting financially. Increased competition from other Christian rock bands, for whom Petra had paved the way, led to lower-than-expected showings as the tour went on. As Hartman told CCM Magazine in 1986, [...] "If I had {{to put it in}} a nutshell without getting too deep, <b>I</b> <b>would</b> <b>have</b> <b>to</b> <b>say</b> it's business. Greg and I agree on just about everything except business." ...|$|E
2500|$|Promoted to full {{general in}} 1962, he was {{assigned}} as vice {{chief of staff of}} the U.S. Army amid speculation that he would soon succeed Army chief of staff George H. Decker, who was not expected to be reappointed. As vice chief of staff, Hamlett negotiated the creation of U.S. Strike Command with Air Force chief of staff Curtis E. LeMay, played a key role in Army operations during the Cuban Missile Crisis, and participated in the escalation of the Vietnam War. Reflecting on this period later, Hamlett said, [...] "I think the most important thing was something I didn't recommend; and that was that we didn't become involved in Vietnam to the point where we would have to commit combat forces. I think it was a failure, and <b>I</b> <b>would</b> <b>have</b> <b>to</b> <b>say</b> that I shared the responsibility because I didn't see far enough ahead to speak out." ...|$|E

Now what <b>I</b> <b>would</b> <b>have</b> <b>to</b> <b>say</b> to thee is this: I would beseech thee to remove all of those mischievous enchantments from that Valley of the Fountain and so set that valley free from the ills that happen to it. This I beseech thee of thy gentleness to do, but if thou wilt not do it because I so beseech thee, then I will compel thee here and now to remove those enchantments." ...|$|E
6000|$|This {{book is that}} story, {{reduced to}} {{manageable}} proportions, its whole course suggested and centred round the absurd cruelty of the Greenwich Park explosion. I had there a task I will not say arduous but of the most absorbing difficulty. But {{it had to be}} done. It was a necessity. The figures grouped about Mrs. Verloc and related directly or indirectly to her tragic suspicion that [...] "life doesn't stand much looking into," [...] are the outcome of that very necessity. Personally I have never had any doubt of the reality of Mrs. Verloc's story; but it had to be disengaged from its obscurity in that immense town, it had to be made credible, I don't mean so much as to her soul but as to her surroundings, not so much as to her psychology but as to her humanity. For the surroundings hints were not lacking. I had to fight hard to keep at arms-length the memories of my solitary and nocturnal walks all over London in my early days, lest they should rush in and overwhelm each page of the story as these emerged one after another from a mood as serious in feeling and thought as any in which I ever wrote a line. In that respect I really think that [...] "The Secret Agent" [...] is a perfectly genuine piece of work. Even the purely artistic purpose, that of applying an ironic method to a subject of that kind, was formulated with deliberation and in the earnest belief that ironic treatment alone would enable me to say all I felt <b>I</b> <b>would</b> <b>have</b> <b>to</b> <b>say</b> in scorn as well as in pity. It is one of the minor satisfactions of my writing life that having taken that resolve I did manage, it seems to me, to carry it right through to the end. As to the personages whom the absolute necessity of the case--Mrs. Verloc's case--brings {{out in front of the}} London background, from them, too, I obtained those little satisfactions which really count for so much against the mass of oppressive doubts that haunt so persistently on every attempt at creative work. For instance, of Mr. Vladimir himself (who was fair game for a caricatural presentation) I was gratified to hear that an experienced man of the world had said [...] "that Conrad must have been in touch with that sphere or else has an excellent intuition of things," [...] because Mr. Vladimir was [...] "not only possible in detail but quite right in essentials." [...] Then a visitor from America informed me that all sorts of revolutionary refugees in New York would have it that the book was written by somebody who knew a lot about them. This seemed to me a very high compliment, considering that, as a matter of hard fact, I had seen even less of their kind than the omniscient friend who gave me the first suggestion for the novel. I have no doubt, however, that there had been moments during the writing of the book when I was an extreme revolutionist, I won't say more convinced than they but certainly cherishing a more concentrated purpose than any of them had ever done in the whole course of his life. I don't say this to boast. I was simply attending to my business. In the matter of all my books I have always attended to my business. I have attended to it with complete self-surrender. And this statement, too, is not a boast. I could not have done otherwise. It would have bored me too much to make-believe.|$|E

50|$|In {{order to}} respond point by point {{to all the}} work {{published}} against me, <b>I</b> <b>would</b> <b>have</b> <b>to</b> go into much minutiae that occurred thirty, forty years ago, of which I remember little: <b>I</b> <b>would</b> <b>have</b> <b>to</b> search my old letters, of which many are lost. Moreover, in most cases I did not keep a copy, and when I did, the copy is buried in a great heap of papers, which I could sort through only with time and patience.

5000|$|He {{spent the}} last part of 2010 on an amateur {{contract}} with Greenock Morton, in the hope of moving permanently to Hearts in January 2011.

50|$|<b>I</b> <b>would</b> <b>have</b> <b>to</b> <b>say</b> From Here to Infirmary {{definitely}} {{started to}} shape {{things up with}} more of a straight up rock kind of sound. I think the previous two albums Goddamnit are really great, but are a bit meandering. I think From Here to Infirmary is when Matt Skiba and I both realized {{that we wanted to}} tighten the screws a bit, simplify things a little and focus more on punching you in the nuts with our rock; Metaphorically speaking of course.|$|E
