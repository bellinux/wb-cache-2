40|$|AbstractChildren with {{cerebral}} palsy participate less in everyday activities than children <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>general</b> <b>populations.</b> During adolescence, rapid physical and psychological changes occur which may be more difficult for adolescents with impairments. Within the European SPARCLE project we measured frequency of participation of adolescents with {{cerebral palsy}} by administering the Questionnaire of Young People's Participation to 667 adolescents {{with cerebral palsy}} or their parents from nine European regions and to 4666 adolescents from <b>the</b> corresponding <b>general</b> <b>populations.</b> Domains and single items were analysed using respectively linear and logistic regression. Adolescents with cerebral palsy spent less time with friends and had less autonomy in their daily life than adolescents <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>general</b> <b>populations.</b> Adolescents with cerebral palsy participated much less in sport but played electronic games at least as often as adolescents <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>general</b> <b>populations.</b> Severity of motor and intellectual impairment {{had a significant impact}} on frequency of participation, the more severely impaired being more disadvantaged. Adolescents with an only slight impairment participated in some domains as often as adolescents <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>general</b> <b>populations.</b> Regional variation existed. For example adolescents with cerebral palsy in central Italy were most disadvantaged according to decisional autonomy, while adolescents with cerebral palsy in east Denmark and northern England played sports as often as their <b>general</b> <b>populations.</b> Participation is an important health outcome. Personal and environmental predictors of participation of adolescents with cerebral palsy need to be identified in order to design interventions directed to such predictors; and in order to inform the content of services...|$|R

50|$|The Anti-Capitalistic Mentality is a {{book written}} by Austrian School {{economist}} and libertarian thinker Ludwig von Mises.

5|$|A {{well-documented}} {{example is}} found in the Amish migration to Pennsylvania in 1744. Two members of the new colony shared the recessive allele for Ellis–van Creveld syndrome. Members of the colony and their descendants tend to be religious isolates and remain relatively insular. As a result of many generations of inbreeding, Ellis-van Creveld syndrome is now much more prevalent among the Amish than <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>general</b> <b>population.</b>|$|E
5|$|Although the {{negative}} health consequences of obesity <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>general</b> <b>population</b> are well {{supported by the}} available evidence, health outcomes in certain subgroups seem to be improved at an increased BMI, a phenomenon known as the obesity survival paradox. The paradox was first described in 1999 in overweight and obese people undergoing hemodialysis, and has subsequently been found in those with heart failure and peripheral artery disease (PAD).|$|E
5|$|High {{amounts of}} {{ionizing}} radiation exposure {{can increase the}} risk of AML. Survivors of the atomic bombings of Hiroshima and Nagasaki had an increased rate of AML, as did radiologists exposed to high levels of X-rays prior to the adoption of modern radiation safety practices. People treated with ionizing radiation after treatment for prostate cancer, non-Hodgkin lymphoma, lung cancer, and breast cancer have the highest chance of acquiring AML, but this increased risk returns to the background risk observed <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>general</b> <b>population</b> after 12 years.|$|E

5|$|Another {{point of}} {{contention}} came from the navy's heavy use of corporal punishment for even minor offenses. While such measures had been banned <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>general</b> <b>population</b> since the Imperial Constitution of 1824 and in the army since 1874, the navy was only affected in November 1889, when the new republic's legislature forbade such discipline. They rescinded the law {{less than a year}} later amid widespread noncompliance. Instead, corporal punishment would only be allowed in a Companhia Correcional (Correctional Company). The legislature envisioned this as a curb on the practice, as only sailors with violent or subversive histories would face the lash. The reality was very different: because the companies existed anywhere on the ships, any sailor could be theoretically transferred to the Companhia Correcional but not have any change in their daily routines.|$|E

50|$|At a {{cultural}} level, egalitarian theories have developed in sophistication and acceptance {{during the past}} two hundred years. Among the notable broadly egalitarian philosophies are socialism, communism, social anarchism, libertarian socialism, left-libertarianism, one-nation conservatism and progressivism, some of which propound economic egalitarianism. Several egalitarian ideas enjoy wide support among intellectuals and <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>general</b> <b>populations</b> of many countries. Whether any of these ideas have been significantly implemented in practice, however, remains a controversial question. A position of opposition to egalitarianism is antiegalitarianism.|$|R
5|$|Behavior {{and mood}} {{alterations}} {{are more common}} in PD without cognitive impairment than <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>general</b> <b>population,</b> and are usually present in PD with dementia. The most frequent mood difficulties are depression, apathy, and anxiety. Establishing the diagnosis of depression {{is complicated by the}} fact that the body language of depression may masquerade as PD including a sad expressionless anxious face, a hang dog appearance, slow movement, and monotonous speech. Up to 30% of people with PD may experience symptoms of anxiety, ranging from a generalized anxiety disorder to social phobia, panic disorders and obsessive compulsive disorders. They contribute to impaired quality of life and increased severity of motor symptoms such as on/off fluctuations or freezing episodes.|$|E
5|$|Differences in the SFTPA1 gene {{sequence}} at {{the coding}} region determine SP-A genetic variants or haplotypes among individuals. More than 30 variants {{have been identified}} and characterized for SFTPA1 (and SFTPA2) in the population. SFTPA1 variants result from nucleotide changes in the codons of amino acids 19, 50, 62, 133, and 219. Two of these do not modify the SP-A1 protein sequence (amino acids 62 and 133), whereas the rest result in amino acid substitutions (amino acid 19, 50, 133, and 219).

Many young female members said they want to undergo post-secondary education, and some told Fortuny they were degree students. Both young men and women are equally encouraged to enter post-compulsory education.

5|$|Paradoxical reactions, such as {{increased}} seizures in epileptics, aggression, violence, impulsivity, irritability and suicidal behavior sometimes occur. These reactions have been explained as consequences of disinhibition {{and the subsequent}} loss of control over socially unacceptable behavior. Paradoxical reactions are rare <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>general</b> <b>population,</b> with an incidence rate below 1% and similar to placebo. However, they occur with greater frequency in recreational abusers, individuals with borderline personality disorder, children, and patients on high-dosage regimes. In these groups, impulse control problems {{are perhaps the most}} important risk factor for disinhibition; learning disabilities and neurological disorders are also significant risks. Most reports of disinhibition involve high doses of high-potency benzodiazepines. Paradoxical effects may also appear after chronic use of benzodiazepines.|$|E
5|$|Reported neuropsychiatric manifestations are anxiety, depression, {{a reduced}} display of {{emotions}} (blunted affect), egocentrism, aggression, and compulsive behavior, {{the latter of}} which can cause or worsen addictions, including alcoholism, gambling, and hypersexuality.

The prevalence of these symptoms is highly variable between studies, with estimated rates for lifetime prevalence of psychiatric disorders between 33% and 76%. For many sufferers and their families, these symptoms {{are among the most}} distressing aspects of the disease, often affecting daily functioning and constituting reason for institutionalization.
