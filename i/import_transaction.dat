40|$|A key {{emerging}} insight {{in international}} economics {{is that the}} scope for quality differentiation can help to explain patterns in export prices {{at the level of}} products or firms. In this paper, a unified theoretical framework of firm heterogeneity in cost and quality is brought to bear on an expansive data set of U. S. <b>import</b> <b>transaction</b> prices collected by the Bureau of Labor Statistics (BLS). The higher moments of the price distribution are used to identify the scope for quality differentiation at the detailed product level; highly differentiated products account for about half of U. S. import value. The product classification is then used to evaluate two claims in the nascent firm-level trade quality literature. First, the positive link between exporter capability and price is found to depend {{on the nature of the}} product: productive exporters simultaneously specialize in high-priced varieties in quality differentiated goods and low-priced varieties in more homogeneous goods. Second, a novel time series test documents firm sorting into export markets according to output quality. Imports - Prices...|$|E

40|$|This paper {{analyzes}} the economic effects of content-based import tariffs China imposed on imported auto parts. While China’s policy penalized any firm that assembled cars {{with less than}} 60 percent Chinese content, the policy was most likely to affect foreign affiliated firms who {{were more likely to}} exceed the content ceiling. To assess whether foreign-affiliated firms differentially changed their input sourcing this paper uses Chinese product trade data for 1997 to 2009 which report trade transactions by firm ownership type. Compared with import transactions for other firms, the data show that foreign-affiliated firms appear to have mitigated the effects of the policy by reducing <b>import</b> <b>transaction</b> prices, and by reducing their import quantities on the extensive margin. While China’s content-based auto import trade policy was repealed in 2009 after China lost its dispute case at the WTO, the extraordinary growth in China’s global export of auto parts since 2005 suggests that China’s short term trade policy may have contributed to enduring effects in global supply chains. content-based tariff policy, imported intermediate inputs...|$|E

These novel data {{can be linked to}} existing longitudinal business microdata that include information on such variables as employment, firm structure and revenue. In this paper, we describe the collected responses, their distribution across sectors, and some business activity patterns with reference to the U. S. economy as a whole.

40|$|This paper {{assesses the}} {{potential}} effects from trade facilitation {{in terms of}} increased trade flows both on average and specifically for the six regional groups of ACP countries negotiating Economic Partnership Agreements (EPAs) with the EU. Data from the World Bank’s Doing Business Database on {{the time required to}} export or import are used as indicators of cross-border transaction costs, and a gravity model on two-way bilateral trade between 22 EU countries and 100 developing countries is estimated using a sample selection approach. The results suggest that time delays {{on the part of the}} exporter and the importer generally significantly decrease trade flows, but also that this effect is not constant, in the sense that the elasticity of trade with respect to border delays declines at higher levels of time requirements. On average, lowering border delays in the exporting country by one day from the sample mean would yield an export-increasing effect of about 1 percent, while the same reduction in the importing country would increase imports by about 0. 5 percent. Significant negative effects are also found of both export and <b>import</b> <b>transaction</b> costs for most EPA groups, and the effects tend to be at least as large as the average or larger. The results are generally robust for a number of alternative estimation methods such as Poisson estimation, IV estimation taking sample selection into account and the sample selection approach suggested by Helpman et al (2007) ...|$|E

40|$|When {{transactions}} are complicated or {{are carried out}} {{for the purposes of}} tax planning, the need to determine whether they have been correctly characterised may arise in some situations. The general position is that however transactions have been classified, taxation should be based on their “true import”. One overall conclusion is that in addition to classification in accordance with the norms of private law, the true <b>import</b> of <b>transactions</b> may also be determined in accordance with specific tax law provisions or normative tax law principles. The support for a tax charge varies depending on the norm type, as do the methods of     interpretation. The thesis presents the methodological principles on which determination of true import should be based. It has proved essential to examine possible lex lata conclusions regarding the scope of the different norm types, particularly bearing in mind rule of law considerations. The material examined largely comprises income tax case law on taxation based on the true <b>import</b> of <b>transactions.</b> Much of the work has consisted of systemising this case law. Analyses are made and conclusions drawn as to how the Supreme Administrative Court determines the true <b>import</b> of <b>transactions</b> in general, and in particular as regards “composite” chains of transactions. The methodological principles on which determination of true import should be based and the conclusions as to how the Supreme Administrative Court determines the true <b>import</b> of <b>transactions</b> are applied to a specifically selected chain of events. In addition, an examination is made and conclusions drawn as to whether there is support for a substance-over-form approach in Swedish tax law, or whether private law sets the precedent for tax law, whether the taxpayer’s desire to achieve tax advantages should be taken into account, the importance of the economic effect when determining the true <b>import</b> of <b>transactions,</b> and whether assessments can be made both to the advantage of taxpayers and to their detriment...|$|R
