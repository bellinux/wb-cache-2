40|$|We re-analyse a {{combined}} 198 ks Chandra observation of NGC 4696, the brightest galaxy of the Centaurus cluster. We extract temperature and metallicity profiles from the data, and we confirm {{the presence of}} a sharp drop in iron abundance, from ~ 1. 8 Zsolar to ~ 0. 4 Zsolar, within the central 5 kpc of the cluster. We estimate that this abundance drop corresponds to a total "missing" iron mass of 1. 4 e 06 Msolar. We propose that part of this missing iron is locked up in cool (~ 19 K) far-IR emitting dust, as found by Spitzer and Herschel observations.

40|$|A 'standard' {{model of}} Active Galactic Nuclei (AGN), {{based upon a}} massive black hole {{surrounded}} by a thin accretion disk, is defined. It is argued that, although there is good evidence {{for the presence of}} black holes and orbiting gas, most of the details of this model are either inadequate or controversial. Magnetic field may be responsible for the confinement of continuum and line-emitting gas, for the dynamical evolution of accretion disks and for the formation of jets. It is further argued that gaseous fuel is supplied in molecular form and that this is responsible for thermal re-radiation, equatorial obscuration and, perhaps, the broad line gas clouds. Stars may also supply gas close to the black hole, especially in low power AGN and they may be observable in discrete orbits as probes of the gravitational field.

40|$|Significant {{reservoirs}} of cool gas {{are observed}} in the circumgalactic medium (CGM) surrounding galaxies. The CGM is also found to contain substantial amounts of metals and dust, which require some transport mechanism. We consider AGN (active galactic nucleus) feedback-driven outflows based on radiation pressure on dust. <b>Dusty</b> <b>gas</b> is ejected when the central luminosity exceeds the effective Eddington luminosity for dust. We obtain that a higher dust-to-gas ratio leads to a lower critical luminosity, implying that the more <b>dusty</b> <b>gas</b> is more easily expelled. Dusty outflows can reach large radii {{with a range of}} velocities (depending on the outflowing shell configuration and the ambient density distribution) and may account for the observed CGM gas. In our picture, dust is required in order to drive AGN feedback, and the preferential expulsion of <b>dusty</b> <b>gas</b> in the outflows may naturally explain the presence of dust in the CGM. On the other hand, the most powerful AGN outflow events can potentially drive gas out of the local galaxy group. We further discuss the effects of radiation pressure of the central AGN on satellite galaxies.

Local giant H II regions are used as references as they enable access to the distinct interstellar medium components {{that contribute to the}} mid-infrared spectrum of star-forming galaxies: photodissociation regions (PDRs), photoionized gas, stellar clusters, and embedded regions. Three objects are considered: NGC 3603 in the Milky Way, 30 Doradus in the Large Magellanic Cloud, and N 66 in the Small Magellanic Cloud. From the variations of the PAH/ 14 μ m ratio, we find that PAHs are destroyed in the ionized gas for a radiation field such that [Ne iii]/[Ne ii] > ~ 3. From the variations of the PAH/Hu α ratio, we find that the PAH emission sources in the giant H II regions follow the same photodestruction law regardless of metallicity. We then compare these results with observations of starburst galaxies, Hii galaxies, and blue compact dwarf galaxies (BCDs).
