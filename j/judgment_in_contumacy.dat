40|$|The {{purpose of}} this paper is to present a {{theoretical}} framework for case studies about teachers'moral <b>judgment</b> <b>in</b> teaching. Through consideration of studies on teachers'moral perception, teachers'teaching style, and teachers'pedagogical judgment, the following three points were abstracted as important viewpoints to grasp teachers'moral <b>judgment</b> <b>in</b> teaching. The first one is to focus on teachers'teaching style which is consistently presented in various expressions in teaching. The second is to focus on both of <b>judgment</b> <b>in</b> a one-time-only situation and the teaching style as a formed habit. The third is to grasp characteristics of teachers'moral <b>judgment</b> <b>in</b> one phase of teaching in such three temporal contexts, as 1) <b>judgment</b> <b>in</b> the teaching, 2) <b>judgment</b> <b>in</b> the development of the class and children since April, and 3) <b>judgment</b> <b>in</b> teachers'teaching career. In conclusion, this paper suggests that in order to explore teachers'moral <b>judgment</b> <b>in</b> teaching, case studies should be conducted with the theoretical framework in this paper...|$|R

The research pre-sented in this paper explores two possible causes for the compressed distance perception in virtual environments: (1) real-time computer graphics rendering, and (2) immer-sive display technology. Our results show there is a sig-nificant difference <b>in</b> distance <b>judgments</b> between real and virtual environments. However, the differences between dis-tance <b>judgments</b> <b>in</b> virtual photographic panorama environ-ments and traditionally rendered virtual environments are small, suggesting that the display device is affecting dis-tance <b>judgments</b> <b>in</b> virtual environments. 1...|$|R
