5|$|One night, she is {{dropped off}} {{at home by}} one of her male colleagues; Apu {{witnesses}} this and assumes that Chanda has been soliciting. She steals the money that Chanda has been collecting {{to pay for the}} math tuition and spends <b>it</b> <b>all</b> <b>on</b> food and new clothes. This devastates Chanda, who becomes depressed when Apu tells her that the money was not hard-earned. Chanda stops attending school and continues to work with the hope that Apu will join the Indian Administrative Service, after she is inspired by a kind District Commissioner (Sanjay Suri). In the meantime, Amar helps Apu realize her mistake by making her witness Chanda working at the restaurant. Apu rekindles her interest in school and begins to treat her mother with respect, having realized that she can perform well if she possesses the will. She brings her mother back to school and the duo finish their SSC year together.|$|E
5|$|When the Phoenicians {{first came}} {{to what is now}} Spain, they {{obtained}} so much silver that they could not fit <b>it</b> <b>all</b> <b>on</b> their ships, and as a result used silver to weight their anchors instead of lead. By the time of the Greek and Roman civilizations, silver coins were a staple of the economy: the Greeks were already extracting silver from galena by the 7th century BC, and the rise of Athens was partly made possible by the nearby silver mines at Laurium, from which they extracted about 30 tonnes a year from 600 to 300 BC. The stability of the Roman currency relied to a high degree on the supply of silver bullion, mostly from Spain, which Roman miners produced on a scale unparalleled before the discovery of the New World. Reaching a peak production of 200 tonnes per year, an estimated silver stock of 10000 tonnes circulated in the Roman economy {{in the middle of the}} second century AD, five to ten times larger than the combined amount of silver available to medieval Europe and the Abbasid Caliphate around AD 800. The Romans also recorded the extraction of silver in central and northern Europe in the same time period. This production came to a nearly complete halt with the fall of the Roman Empire, not to resume until the time of Charlemagne: by then, tens of thousands of tonnes of silver had already been extracted.|$|E

25|$|Jacob Rosenzweig (September 1876 – October 4, 1947) was an American gambler and underworld {{figure in}} New York City. He {{was one of}} several star {{witnesses}} in the Becker-Rosenthal trial, among these being fellow gamblers Bridgie Webber, Harry Vallon, and Sam Schepps. Rose's testimony was the most damaging because he directly implicated Becker in arranging the murder of Herman Rosenthal. As Becker's debt collector, Rose confessed to hiring the Lenox Avenue Gang, providing the getaway car. He testified he did <b>it</b> <b>all</b> <b>on</b> the orders of Charles Becker.|$|E
25|$|Gus Levy {{joined the}} {{firm in the}} 1950s as a {{securities}} trader, which started a trend at Goldman where there would be two powers generally vying for supremacy, one from investment banking and one from securities trading. For most of the 1950s and 1960s, this would be Weinberg and Levy. Levy was a pioneer in block trading and the firm established this trend under his guidance. Due to Weinberg's heavy influence at the firm, it formed an investment banking division in 1956 {{in an attempt to}} spread around influence and not focus <b>it</b> <b>all</b> <b>on</b> Weinberg.|$|E

Soon thereafter, he signed on as a teamster with the U.S. Army expedition heading to Salt Lake City, Utah in the spring of 1858. Little is known of Quantrill's journey out west, except that he excelled at the game of poker.

500|$|In autumn 1928, {{an early}} frost reduced farm incomes by between ten and 25 percent.

[...] Brownlee rejected such calls: [...] "Unless we are to say that individuals or companies who lend money in this Province in good faith must wait indefinitely for repayment, whatever may be the contract or agreement at the time, there comes a limit {{to the extent to which}} the Government is justified in interfering".|$|E

500|$|Critical {{reception}} of her fashion and style {{has been extensively}} written about by both designers and fashion stylists and has generally proved favorable.

[...] In terms of her own personal style, Sevigny cited the Australian film Picnic at Hanging Rock (1975), which features schoolgirls dressed in elaborate Victorian clothing, as a major inspiration; she has also cited it as one of her favorite films. She has also been outspoken in her favoritism of vintage clothing over designer pieces: [...] "I still prefer to buy vintage over spending <b>it</b> <b>all</b> <b>on</b> one designer", she told The Times. [...] "I'll go to Resurrection or Decades and be like, 'Oh, I'm going to buy everything,' but {{a lot of it is}} extremely expensive, so I'll go to Wasteland and satisfy that urge and it's not too hard on the pocketbook.
