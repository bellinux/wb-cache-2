40|$|This paper {{describes}} a protocol developed within the PRATIQUE project for applying cost/benefit analysis to select appropriate <b>phytosanitary</b> <b>measures</b> for use against quarantine pests. The protocol consists of nine steps, each underpinned by clear guidelines for collating and structuring the relevant data, to assist risk managers with the challenging task of assessing {{the benefits and}} costs of <b>phytosanitary</b> <b>measures</b> in a consistent, transparent and reproducible manner. Together with the decision-support scheme that generates contingency plants and prioritizes action during pest outbreaks, it provides a framework for decision making on <b>phytosanitary</b> <b>measures</b> and helps to provide economic justification for selecting appropriate measures. The practical application of the protocol is demonstrated using two examples: cost/benefit analysis of eradication measures against Anoplophora glabripennis in Northern Italy; and eradication and containment measures against Diabrotica virgifera virgifera in Germany...|$|R

If a pest is judged to present an unacceptable risk then <b>phytosanitary</b> <b>measures</b> should be identified that will reduce the risk to an acceptable level. <b>Phytosanitary</b> <b>measures</b> should accord with IPPC principles of necessity, managed risk, minimal impact, transparency, harmonization, non-discrimination and technical justification.|$|R

40|$|International {{treaties}} {{require that}} <b>phytosanitary</b> <b>measures</b> against introduction and spread of invasive plant pests are justified by a science-based pest risk analysis, including {{an assessment of}} potential economic consequences. This study evaluates the economic justification of the currently applied <b>phytosanitary</b> <b>measures</b> against {{potato spindle tuber viroid}} (PSTVd). It assesses the impact of an unregulated EU infestation, while accounting for uncertainty due to scarcity of data. Expert opinions were elicited to describe the possible range of PSTVd spread. Stochastic simulations, based on the assessments of separate experts, indicated that the direct impacts exceed the costs of current <b>phytosanitary</b> <b>measures</b> (€ 5. 6 M/year) with a probability of 44 %, but with large differences between experts making it hard to justify the measures solely by the expected savings in direct impacts. The direct impact on potato producers was estimated with partial budgeting. This impact is 2. 1 M€, based on an assumed prevalence of PSTVd of 0. 73 %, while the direct impact on tomato producers was estimated at 3. 5 M€. The total economic impact, considering price changes and higher costs for consumers, was estimated at 4. 4 M€ for potatoes and 5. 7 M€ for tomatoes. Consumers bore 92 % of the total costs of invasion in the case of potato and 77 % in the case of tomato. If the presence of PSTVd would imply export restrictions, resulting in an annual loss of more than 1 % of the total EU export value of potatoes and tomatoes, the cost of current <b>phytosanitary</b> <b>measures</b> would also be justified. The potential economic impacts of PSTVd into the European Union are therefore demonstrably of importance when considering market effects or export losses but questionable if only accounting for the direct losses. The large degree of uncertainty in the prevalence of disease contributes to the justifiability of measures based on the precautionary principle. The assessment approach can be useful for assessing the economic justification of <b>phytosanitary</b> <b>measures...</b>|$|R

The PRA concludes, that without taking <b>phytosanitary</b> <b>measures</b> the impact of Azalea sawfly will be relatively low, cause the deciduous rhododendrons are not indigenous in the Czech Republic.

40|$|The {{trade in}} plants for {{planting}} (P 4 P) {{is one of}} the major pathways for the introduction of pests. The strong increase in world trade in the past decades appears to have led to an increase in introductions of species transported by this pathway, and highlights the need for effective <b>phytosanitary</b> legislation and <b>measures.</b> The <b>phytosanitary</b> regulations in most countries are based on the International Plant Protection Convention and the World Trade Organisation's Agreement on Sanitary and <b>Phytosanitary</b> <b>Measures,</b> but there are large differences in countries' approaches to managing the risk of introducing invasive alien species through international plant trade. We reviewed elements of the phytosanitary legislations of ten countries on all continents and aimed to find regulations that prevent biological invasions. We found large differences in countries' phytosanitary regulations. New Zealand and Australia have the strictest phytosanitary regulations, while Europe maintains a general authorization for P 4 P imports. The remaining countries have regulations between these extremes. The evidence is sparse regarding the quality of implementation and effectiveness, and impact of individual <b>phytosanitary</b> <b>measures.</b> We recommend that National Plant Protection Organisations collect detailed information on P 4 P imports and the effectiveness of <b>phytosanitary</b> <b>measures.</b> Such information could provide a basis to improve a country's phytosanitary regulatory framework or could be used in risk assessments...|$|R
