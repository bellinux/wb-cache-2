40|$|A {{study of}} the Egyptian River Nile {{waterway}} and its characteristics is made to define the constraints on the dimensions of Nile <b>floating</b> <b>hotels.</b> Factors causing heeling moments or influencing {{the position of the}} ship’s centre of gravity, thus affecting the righting moment curve, are discussed in this paper to attain a better stability analysis for Nile <b>floating</b> <b>hotels.</b> Stability of Nile <b>floating</b> <b>hotels</b> can be easily and quickly checked by use of the proposed formula for the critical metacentric height. A mathematical model, for a specially designed computer program, which calculates the maximum sunshade area, is presented. Another proposal, for the calculation of maximum lateral projected area of Nile <b>floating</b> <b>hotels,</b> is presented. The River Nile weather conditions are also investigated to establish a specifi ed wind speed to be used in connection with stability calculation of Nile fl oating hotels...|$|R

25|$|On 24 June 2009, QE2 {{made her}} first journey after nearly {{eight months of}} {{inactivity}} since the liner arrived in Dubai. She manoeuvered under her own power into the Dubai Drydocks for inspection and hull repainting before her (then planned) voyage to Cape Town's V Waterfront to serve there as a <b>floating</b> <b>hotel</b> for the FIFA World Cup 2010 and beyond.|$|E
25|$|The {{ship was}} built in England in 1937–39, and when new she set a number of records for her size and power. She {{operated}} between Britain and New Zealand via Australia in civilian service 1938–40 and 1948–62 and was a troop ship 1940–47. She spent half of 1962 in the Port of Seattle as a <b>floating</b> <b>hotel</b> for the Century 21 Exposition and was then scrapped in Japan.|$|E
25|$|On 12 May 2009, DFDS {{reported}} {{they had agreed}} to sell Queen of Scandinavia to a new Finland-based company Nordic Sea Line, with a delivery date set for June 2009.

50|$|The hotel barge (fr. péniche hôtel) {{came into}} being {{following}} the decline in commercial and freight carrying on the canals of Europe. Many working barges have been converted into <b>floating</b> <b>hotels</b> of varying degrees of luxury. This trend began in the 1960s and has now grown into a network of hotel barges operating on the canals and rivers of France, Belgium, the Netherlands, Germany and the UK.|$|R
25|$|The {{second of}} Canadian Pacific's British Columbia Coast Steamship's two 365-foot-long, 56-foot-wide, 5,911-/6,062-ton (1963 refit) Fairfield Shipyards, Scotland-built steam turbo-electric {{passenger}} ships, the TEV Princess Patricia (Princess Patricia II), was named in 1948 for Princess Patricia of Connaught and launched by her as Lady Patricia Ramsay at Govan in that year. The first ship for Princess Cruises via a winter Mexican Riviera charter from CPL in 1965, she was retired from Alaskan cruising services in 1981 {{and served as}} a <b>floating</b> <b>hotel</b> in Vancouver, British Columbia for their 1986 World's Fair before being finally scrapped in 1989.|$|E
25|$|Norwegian Star was {{chartered}} {{to serve}} as a <b>floating</b> <b>hotel</b> for the 2010 Winter Olympics in Vancouver, British Columbia, Canada, however the deal was cancelled because of financial costs and lack of demand. The cancellation allowed NCL the extra two weeks to move up a refurbishment planned for late 2011. Norwegian Star entered drydock at the Victoria Shipyards in nearby Victoria on February 16. The majority of the renovations consisted of the relocation of the gift shops and lounge, as well as the addition of 58new suites and staterooms; a similar project was carried out on Norwegian Dawn a year later. Norwegian Star left Victoria on March 2 and returned to service four days later.|$|E
25|$|A {{comprehensive}} regeneration {{plan for}} the site is being implemented by West Dunbartonshire Council and Scottish Enterprise. This includes making the Clydebank waterfront more accessible to the public. Restoration of the historic Titan Crane — built by Sir William Arrol & Co. for the shipyard — was completed in 2007. A new campus for Clydebank College was opened in August 2008. Regeneration plans also include improved infrastructure, modern offices, a light industrial estate and new housing, retail and leisure facilities. It was hoped {{that as part of}} the plan Queen Elizabeth 2 would be returned to the city and river where she was built, but on 18 June 2007 Cunard Line announced that she would be sold to Dubai as a <b>floating</b> <b>hotel.</b>|$|E
40|$|The {{fact that}} the best known vessel in {{the recent history of}} {{navigation}} on the eastern coast of the Adriatic is a humble floating crane must be a surprise in today’s world of incredibly big container ships, towering <b>floating</b> <b>hotels</b> and all kinds of futuristic shaped vessels. But the glory of Veli Jože is immortal, kept in stories and memories by generations of the Adriatic islanders and seafarers. Certainly, it is worth sharing with the readership of ToMS...|$|R
40|$|Very large {{floating}} structures (VLFS) {{have attracted}} the attention of architects, city planners, and engineers because they provide an exciting and environmentally friendly solution for land creation from the sea as opposed to the traditional land reclamation method. The applications of VLFS as <b>floating</b> piers, <b>floating</b> <b>hotels,</b> <b>floating</b> fuel storage facilities, floating stadia, floating bridges, floating airports, and even floating cities have triggered extensive research studies in the past two decades. The VLFS technology has developed considerably and there are many innovative methods proposed to minimize the hydroelastic motion, improve the mooring system and structural integrity of the VLFS. This keynote paper summarizes the applications, research and development of VLFS over the past two decades...|$|R
50|$|Djibouti {{city has}} over 40 hotels. Most are {{situated}} within the capital area or along the Djibouti Palace Kempinski's beachfront.

To accommodate all visitors, new hotels are currently being constructed and <b>floating</b> <b>hotels</b> {{will be used in}} the future.|$|R
25|$|Olympic was {{withdrawn}} from the transatlantic service, and left New York {{for the last time}} on 5 April 1935, returning to Britain to be laid up. Her new owners considered using her for summer cruises for a short while, but this idea was abandoned and she was put up for sale. Among the potential buyers was a syndicate who proposed to turn her into a <b>floating</b> <b>hotel</b> off the south coast of France, but this came to nothing. After being laid up for five months alongside her former rival , she was sold to Sir John Jarvis – Member of Parliament for £97,500, to be partially demolished at Jarrow to provide work for the depressed region. Her superstructure was demolished in 1936, and in 1937, Olympics hull was towed to Inverkeithing to Thos W Ward's yard for final demolition.|$|E
25|$|The Augustus was {{retired from}} service in January 1976. On January 15, 1976, she was laid up in Naples. She {{was sold to}} Hong Kong and was renamed Great Sea. After a little use, she was renamed Ocean King in 1980. And in 1983, she was renamed Philippines. At that time, she served as an {{accommodation}} ship in Manila. She was renamed President in 1985. However, she was laid up in Kaohsiung, and in 1987, she was renamed Asian Princess and in 1997, she was moved to Subic Bay, where she was converted into cruising. However, the ship has failed in making money in this venture. Then she was moved and place at anchorage off Manila. She was dry-docked at Subic Bay in mid-1998, and in February 1999, she returned to Manila, where she was refitted {{for use as a}} <b>floating</b> <b>hotel</b> and restaurant venue as originally planned.|$|E
25|$|In January 2015, {{further details}} emerged in an {{interview}} with Xu Zengping by the South China Morning Post. Xu reported that he had been commissioned by the PLAN to purchase the vessel on its behalf, with the <b>floating</b> <b>hotel</b> and casino as a cover story. He was warned that the Chinese Navy did not have the budget to buy the ship, and the Chinese government did not support the purchase. However, Xu was so impressed when touring the ship that he resolved to purchase it using his personal funds. The previous year, Xu had borrowed HK$230 million from a Hong Kong business friend, spending HK$6 million to create Chong Lot as a Macau shell corporation. He described a harrowing negotiation in Kiev, lubricated by bribery and liquor, which helped to arrange victory at the auction. As a precaution, he shipped 40 tonnes of the carrier's blueprints to China overland in eight trucks.|$|E
25|$|The ships {{functioned as}} <b>floating</b> <b>hotels,</b> {{providing}} medical, laundry, housing, dining, and sleeping facilities for shoreline cleanup workers. They also provided communications support and functioned as {{command and control}} platforms and helipads for the forward deployment of helicopters. They supported base operations of the landing craft, providing maintenance, fuel, and docking. Deployed with the ships were United States Marine Corps CH-46 helicopters and Army medical evacuation helicopters, which performed a variety of essential missions. Naval ship operations centered in Prince William Sound and were especially important in open sea areas because commercial berthing vessels could not operate in the rough water.|$|R
50|$|The Phước Điền Temple {{is located}} in Châu Đốc. It is an {{official}} historic monument of Vietnam. The Victoria Hotel is the only notable hotel in the area. There are also many hotels in the center near the main market area, {{where you can get}} good value for money accommodation. There are other hotels that are situated near Nui Sam. There are a couple of new hotels on the road to Sam mountain. A worthwhile option to consider is a night (or two) on one of the <b>floating</b> <b>hotels</b> (there are 2, one reachable via footbridge, the other via boat).|$|R
