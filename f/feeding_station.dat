40|$|<b>Feeding</b> <b>stations</b> are {{commonly}} used to sustain conservation programs of scavengers but their impact on behaviour is still debated. They increase the temporal and spatial predictability of food resources while scavengers have supposedly evolved to search for unpredictable resources. In the Grands Causses (France), a reintroduced population of Griffon vultures Gyps fulvus can find carcasses at three types of sites: 1. "light feeding stations", where farmers can drop carcasses at their farm (spatially predictable), 2. "heavy feeding stations", where carcasses from nearby farms are concentrated (spatially and temporally predictable) and 3. open grasslands, where resources are randomly distributed (unpredictable). The impact of <b>feeding</b> <b>stations</b> on vulture’s foraging behaviour was investigated using 28 GPS-tracked vultures. The average home range size was maximal in spring (1272 ± 752 km 2) and minimal in winter (473 ± 237 km 2) and was highly variable among individuals. Analyses of home range characteristics and feeding habitat selection via compositional analysis showed that <b>feeding</b> <b>stations</b> were always preferred compared {{to the rest of}} the habitat where vultures can find unpredictable resources. <b>Feeding</b> <b>stations</b> were particularly used when resources were scarce (summer) or when flight conditions were poor (winter), limiting long-ranging movements. However, when flight conditions were optimal, home ranges also encompassed large areas of grassland where vultures could find unpredictable resources, suggesting that vultures did not lose their natural ability to forage on unpredictable resources, even when <b>feeding</b> <b>stations</b> were available. However during seasons when food abundance and flight conditions were not limited, vultures seemed to favour light over heavy <b>feeding</b> <b>stations,</b> probably because of the reduced intraspecific competition and a pattern closer to the natural dispersion of resources in the landscape. Light <b>feeding</b> <b>stations</b> are interesting tools for managing food resources, but don’t prevent vultures to feed at other places with possibly high risk of intoxication (poison) ...|$|R

40|$|Cervids are a {{widespread}} family of ungulates, {{native to the}} Americas, Europe and Asia and introduced to Australia. Densities of cervids have increased in North America, Europe and Japan during {{the last couple of}} decades, due to changes in land use, reduced hunting, lack of large carnivores and changes in management practices. Where they occur at high densities, native and introduced cervids may have profound effects on vegetation, causing knock-on effects on other taxa. Cervids are in some instances managed towards changing the local distribution through supplemental feeding. These supplemental <b>feeding</b> <b>stations</b> are causing localized areas of high cervid abundance in the landscape, and may have effects on plants and animal species. In this thesis I investigate how high cervid densities and the practice of supplemental feeding impact birds and small mammals through effects on; 1) food resources, and 2) habitat structure. Utilizing a simulated moose (Alces alces) browsing experiment, I tested how varying moose densities and varying site productivity affects vole preference for bilberry. I found that voles preferred unbrowsed bilberry at low productivity sites, while they preferred lightly browsed bilberry at high productivity sites, I was however unable to explain the preference pattern with the chemical composition of the bilberry. However, moose do impact vole food preferences and this could, depending on the productivity of the site, potentially affect food selection and population dynamics over large geographical areas. Moose browsing pressure and nutrient input gradually decline with distance from supplemental winter <b>feeding</b> <b>stations.</b> I utilized this gradient to test how moose activity affects reproduction in pied flycatchers (Ficedula hypoleuca) and great tits (Parus major). The two species showed contrasting responses to moose <b>feeding</b> <b>stations,</b> great tits preferred to nest away from <b>feeding</b> <b>stations</b> where they showed higher feeding frequency and also produced more fledglings compared to close to <b>feeding</b> <b>stations.</b> Pied flycatchers on the other hand preferred to nest close to <b>feeding</b> <b>stations</b> where they had higher feeding frequency and fledgling mass was higher compared to further away. Hence, for both species moose browsing is affecting food availability that subsequently affects reproductive performance. Moose supplemental <b>feeding</b> <b>stations</b> also changed the habitat for small mammals from dwarf shrub dominated to grass and forb dominated. This did not have any effect on reproductive performance of the small mammals, but it did affect species composition along a gradient from the <b>feeding</b> <b>stations.</b> There was higher abundance of Microtus spp. and common shrews (Sorex araneus) close to <b>feeding</b> <b>stations,</b> while bank voles (Myodes glareoleus) had higher abundance away from <b>feeding</b> <b>stations,</b> the latter however was not statistically significant. Small mammals in Australian coastal heath were generally negatively associated with introduced rusa deer (Cervus timorensis), however one species responded positively to historical densities of rusa deer. It was however not possible to confirm these effects as being due to changes in habitat structure for the small mammals. However they may be explained by qualitative changes in the vegetation or alternatively by direct effects of deer through trampling or predation. Cervids and their management have an impact on other fauna, however the effects vary depending on small mammal and bird species. The effects of cervids also depend on the habitat requirements and foraging preferences of the small mammals and birds. Effects may be mediated through both food resources and habitat structure and are dependent on site productivity and cervid density. PhD i biologiPhD in Biolog...|$|R
40|$|Two {{experiments}} examined multiple schedule behavioral {{contrast in}} a group foraging paradigm. Groups of five rats foraged simultaneously in a large open field apparatus with two <b>feeding</b> <b>stations.</b> Food pellets were delivered {{at each of the}} <b>feeding</b> <b>stations</b> on multiple Variable Time schedules. As predicted by both the matching law and the ideal free distribution, the relative distribution of behav-ior between the two <b>feeding</b> <b>stations</b> roughly matched the relative rate of food delivery at the <b>feeding</b> <b>stations.</b> These differences were reflected in both the behavior of individual animals and in the behav-ior of the group. Positive behavioral contrast was found in Experiment 1, evidenced by an increase in the frequency of response in one component produced by a decreased rate of food delivery in the other component. Negative behavioral contrast was found in Experiment 2, evidenced by a decreased frequency of response in one component produced by an increased rate of food delivery in the other component. Interestingly, there was virtually no correlation between the behavior of an individual animal and the number of pellets consumed by that animal. The present results support other attempts to compare the matching law to the ideal free distribution. The data also show that behavioral contrast is predicted by both models and in fact occurs in ways consistent with both models. Contrast effects come in many varieties.
