First developed in the 1970s and 1980s as a tract-home development, albeit one tailored to affluent buyers, the neighborhood's stock of large tract homes has expanded to include exceptional custom estates and mansions perched on the neighborhood's choicest ridges, which offer expansive, uninterrupted views of the south San Francisco Bay. One of the last undeveloped hillside parcels {{in the city of}} Oakland, this district has in recent years added a new, less exclusive subdivision on the western slopes below Campus Drive. Begun in 2005 by Desilva, a real estate developer, this latest subdivision has nearly completed its first phase of homes on the ridge where the Leona quarry (also known as the Alma pyrite mine) was once in use. The higher-priced segment of this latest subdivision has, as of 2016, begun to break ground on the restored upper reaches of the former quarry, which has undergone extensive environmental repair in preparation for the new subdivision. During the early 2010s, the country's continuing economic challenges in general, and the <b>depressed</b> <b>housing</b> market in particular, had slowed the pace of sales of existing units and the construction of the more upscale segment of the project. With the country's improved economic status by 2016, particularly for the affluent, and notably the ongoing, rapid citywide revitalization (some say [...] "hypergentrification") of Oakland, this development's home sales and additional construction have revitalized as well. Nevertheless, the undeveloped upper hillside of the former quarry -- even after having undergone extensive seeding and terraced hillside reconstitution -- is still visible for miles, even as far away as San Francisco across the Bay.|$|E

40|$|This {{dissertation}} {{study examines}} whether owner-occupation (OO), in <b>depressed</b> <b>housing</b> markets, has {{significant impact on}} foreclosure rates of residential multi-family properties in Manchester and Nashua, New Hampshire. The study is an extension on Wardrip & Pelletiere's 2008 research that covered four New England states: New Hampshire, Connecticut, Rhode Island and Massachusetts. In this study Wardrip & Pelletiere found that residential multi-family properties have significantly higher foreclosure rates compared to single-family properties. This researcher adds value to Wardrip & Pelletiere's study by arguing that owner-occupation is {{a significant factor in}} foreclosures of residential real estate in general, and especially, in foreclosures of residential multi-family properties, in general. To examine the problem of increasing and higher foreclosure rates amongst residential multi-family properties, the study uses quantitative and qualitative research methods. The quantitative component covers the entire population of residential 2 - to 4 -unit multifamily properties in Manchester and Nashua over the 2 -year period from 2007 to 2008. The study compares the foreclosure rates of owner-occupied and non-owner-occupied residential multi-family properties in the two cities. For hypothesis testing Independent Samples t Test was used to measure differences in the maintenance and upkeep of randomly selected owner-occupied and non-owner-occupied multi-family properties in Manchester. Geographical Information System (GIS) mapping was used to lay out and analyze the spatial distribution of all residential multi-family properties, and the location of foreclosures within that distribution, in Manchester. Detailed interviews were conducted with key informants representing major multi-family stakeholder institutions in New Hampshire to gather their perceptions on owner-occupied and non-owneroccupied multi-family homeownership. The study found that there are significant differences between the foreclosure rates of owner-occupied and non-owner-occupied multi-family properties in Manchester and Nashua, New Hampshire. To theoretically explain the differences in foreclosure rates of OO and NOO multi-family properties two theoretical frameworks were developed and applied, i. e., "Broken Windows" and "Meaning of Home". Broken Windows (BW) theory, attributed to two criminologists, James Wilson and George Kelling, says that if broken windows remain unrepaired, vandals will soon break the building's remaining windows and the windows of abutting properties and those of other properties in the neighborhood. This researcher uses "Broken Windows" {{as a metaphor for the}} hypothesized relative neglect in upkeep and maintenance of NOO multi-family properties. "Meaning of Home" theory is a construct developed from four concepts: "Home Use Value"; "Meaning of Home"; "Rental Value"; and "Investment Value" as applied to owner-occupied and non-owner-occupied multi-family homeownership, based on perceived and actual expectations, behaviors and the general psychology of multi-family homeowners. Homeowners are classified as owner-occupiers (OOs) and non-owner-occupiers (NOOs). The study argues that owner-occupiers are usually more financially and psychologically invested in the multi-family property and the neighborhood they live in. On the other hand, non-owner-occupying investors are hypothesized to be less socially and economically invested in the property and neighborhood, mainly because neither is their own home. The researcher argues that if rental income and investment value are not on a financially rewarding trajectory for the non-owner-occupying multi-family investor, there is no, or very little, incentive for him / her to continue holding on to the asset. The study found that, on average, owner-occupied multi-family properties are significantly better maintained, and have positive social and economic externalities for their neighborhoods, communities and local authorities. This is in keeping with the Meaning of Home theory as developed and advanced in this study. Non-owneroccupied multi-family properties were found to be significantly more in disrepair, to have significantly less curb appeal, and to have significantly greater risk of being foreclosed in <b>depressed</b> <b>housing</b> market conditions. Based on GIS mapping analyses of Manchester, New Hampshire, this study also found that owner-occupied and nonowner occupied multi-family buildings tend to cluster around each other or to be clustered in specific neighborhoods of the city. The study recommends that low-income to moderate-income multi-family homeownership policies be seriously considered in their varied formats, including but not limited to having exploratory and specific programs that support, promote and finance owner-occupation of residential multi-family properties. The study also raises a strong case for policy makers to promote policies that support mixed-income neighborhood development, and explore possibilities for the conversion of non-owneroccupied residential multi-family buildings to owner-occupied condominiums, housing co-operatives and land trusts.

40|$|The Housing Choice Voucher (HCV) {{program is}} the largest federally subsidized {{affordable}} housing program in the U. S., {{where one of the}} program’s goals is to deconcentrate poverty and alleviate the standard of living for program participants. However, a large growing number of HCV tenants have experienced involuntary eviction due to rental property foreclosures in recent years. On the other hand, due to the massive amount of foreclosures and the <b>depressed</b> <b>housing</b> market for homeownership, there is evidence that a plethora of owner-occupied units are being converted into rental housing units in a diverse income range of neighborhoods. In this regard, this dissertation has endeavored to shed light on whether the new rental housing supply created from previously foreclosed properties, has assisted the HCV program’s goal of poverty deconcentration. Accordingly, three large central metropolitan counties were analyzed using exploratory spatial data analysis, descriptive statistics, and multivariate negative binomial regression. The dissertation finds that though HCV households have dispersed widely, the distribution is quite uneven. Also, the share of HCV households residing in high-poverty neighborhoods is shown to have increased over time. Foreclosures appear to {{have played a role in}} this distribution change, as foreclosure are found to have a positive effect on HCV residencies in a neighborhood. Finally, the impact of foreclosures was found to be greater in lower-income higher-minority neighborhoods compared to higher-income lower-minority neighborhoods. As such, the findings suggest that policymakers need to strengthen protection for renters facing foreclosure, implement strategies to reduce exclusionary practices, and increase HCV availability, in order for the HCV program to further achieve its goal of poverty deconcentration.

40|$|Over {{the past}} four years, {{considerable}} attention {{has been focused on}} the problems of high unemployment in the State of Oregon. The percentage of jobless continued to be higher than that of the nation. The <b>depressed</b> <b>housing</b> market, caused by high interest rates, coupled with an increase in the import of Canadian timber managed to reduce the demand for Oregon lumber and wood products drastically. This has resulted in an abnormally high unemployment rate in many of Oregon 2 ̆ 7 s counties which are dependent on the wood industry; for example, the 1980 jobless rate in Harney County reached a record high of 29 percent. On {{the other side of the}} spectrum, less dependent counties such as Gilliam and Morrow continued to grow during the same period, with unemployment rates of merely 4. 9 and 5. 8 percent respectively. These rates are approximately half the state average. Community leaders, including the Governor, seem convinced that the only solution is economic diversification. It is an argument that makes a great deal of sense at first glance. The notion here is that if you diversify you will become less vulnerable to outside forces and hence will have a more stable economy. But what is diversification? How can we tell that one region is more diversified than another? Furthermore, having a diversified economy, does this ensure a lower rate of unemployment? The thrust of this dissertation deals with providing answers to these questions. Three schools of thought [...] ogive-norm, portfolio variance and entropy [...] were examined in an effort to determine a more proper measure of economic diversification. Various statistical procedures of hypothesis testing were employed together with stepwise regression and analysis of variance. The research findings indicate that there is a definite relationship between economic diversification and regional unemployment. However, only 28 percent of the change in the rate of unemployment is explainable by changes in the levels of diversification.

40|$|Although the Low-Income Housing Tax Credit (LIHTC) {{program has}} grown into the largest subsidized housing program in the U. S., we have limited {{understanding}} about {{the performance of the}} program. This study explores the associations between LIHTC subsidized households and uneven geography of opportunities in the cities of Charlotte, North Carolina, and Cleveland, Ohio, to identify socioeconomic inequalities for subsidized households using a variety of methods. First, the dissertation employs the simple bivariate analysis, in terms of a location quotient (LQ), to examine the empirical evidence on inequitable opportunities. Based on the results of location quotients, this study suggests that current patterns of LIHTC developments may perpetuate inequitable opportunities for subsidized households through pushing them into the vicious circle of residential segregation and inequality. This paper also explores impacts of the LIHTC program on nearby property values and neighborhood stability to contextualize the economic and neighborhood impacts of the program. To be more specific, this dissertation examined housing prices and housing turnover before and after the introduction of LIHTC developments into the neighborhood, based on housing sales data from 1996 to 2007. This data is merged with parcel-level data from Mecklenburg and Cuyahoga County. The study estimates an AITS-DID (Adjusted Interrupted Time Series-Difference in Differences) and an extended Cox hazard model with the difference-in-differences specification to clarify the direction of causality in the impacts of LIHTC developments. This research also explores impacts on neighboring housing prices and neighborhood stability from LIHTC developments citywide and in neighborhoods stratified by income. When it comes to estimating the relationships between the developments of LIHTC subsidized housing and surrounding housing prices, this study found that impacts of LIHTC developments varied across different housing market conditions (i. e., a ?hot? and a ?cold? market). The LIHTC developments had a negative impact on nearby property values in Charlotte while they had a positive impact in Cleveland. These results suggest that the LIHTC program may be implemented to revitalize or stimulate deteriorated areas, especially in <b>depressed</b> <b>housing</b> market conditions. In terms of examining the associations between the LIHTC developments and neighborhood stability, this study found significant negative impacts on stability of LIHTC developments in both cities, and the probability of housing turnover was significantly higher when LIHTC units were developed within the immediate neighborhood of each property. However, for the high-income submarket, there were strong spillover effects in Charlotte while there were no significant impacts in Cleveland. These results suggest that the vulnerability of neighborhood stability due to LIHTC development needs to be considered when implementing a successful subsidized housing program...|$|E
