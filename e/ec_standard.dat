40|$|Adopting {{standards}} {{to reduce emissions}} requires consideration {{of a variety of}} alternative approaches. This rulemaking development effort includes consideration of the timing of emission standards, the level of stringency, the appropriate test procedures, among other things. In this chapter, we present a variety of alternatives that we considered in preparing this rulemaking. While these alternatives were not adopted as part of the final rule, they are discussed here with an analysis of the associated costs and emission reductions involved and our rationale for not adopting them. 11. 1 Recreational Marine Diesel Engines While developing the CI recreational marine engine standards we analyzed two alternative approaches. The first approach was to apply the draft European Commission recreational marine emission {{standards to}} CI recreational marine engines used in the United States. Another approach we considered was to implement the CI recreational marine engine standards on the same schedule as for commercial marine engines. These two alternative approaches are discussed below. 11. 1. 1 Harmonization with Draft <b>EC</b> <b>Standard...</b>|$|E
40|$|Abstract niet beschikbaarWith {{reference}} tot the Memorandum Environmental Criteria for the Protection of Soil and Water against Chemical Pollutants, {{the objective}} {{of this study was to}} indicate whether dilution and degradation in the ground water had to be accounted for in case of Approval of Pesticides. In this report the possible occurrence of pesticides in the upper (1 m) layer of the ground water and the deep, extracted ground water has been evaluated based on the actual use of soil and pesticides in a number of vulnerable agricultural areas in the Netherlands. Dilution, defined as the physical process of mixing of water streams in the extraction well, is determined by two factors: the actual use of a pesticide and the acreage fractions of the crops to which a pesticide may be applied. In case of public drinking water supplies the dilution factor, defined as the ratio of the pesticide concentration in the upper (1 m) layer of the ground water and that in the deep, extracted ground water, has a minimum value of 3. 7 for pesticides which leaks into the ground water with resulting concentrations higher than 0. 1 mg. m - 3. This dilution factor can be much higher for the various combinations of pesticide and crops. This dilution cannot prevent that the <b>EC</b> <b>standard</b> (for all pesticides together) of 0. 5 mg. m - 3 in the extracted ground water is exceeded (by factors of 10 to 1000) and that for 13 of the 130 pesticides evaluated the individual <b>EC</b> <b>standard</b> of 0. 1 mg. m - 3 is exceeded. For private water extraction wells the situation may be somewhere between two extremes: no dilution (in case of very shallow extractions) or dilutions comparable to those of a public drinking water supply. It was concluded that degradation of the pesticides in the saturated zone may have a substantial effect on the concentrations in the extracted groundwater. The extent is determined by the relation between the residence time in this zone and the degradation rate of the pesticide in this zone. Only very limited information is available on the transformation of pesticides in the water satured zone and a reasonable certainty about the formation of harmless metabolites does not exist. Therefore the influence of transformation in the subsoil on the levels of pesticides in deep ground water has not been evaluated. In the discussion attention has been given to the uncertainties of the model (parameters) and the overground processes which determine the fraction of the dosage reaching the soil...|$|E

40|$|Master of ScienceDepartment of Psychological SciencesMary CainIndividuals {{suffering}} from depression primarily rely on pharmacological interventions {{to alleviate the}} incapacitating symptoms of the disorder. In addition to genetic differences underlying the etiology of depression, environmental factors {{play a key role}} as well. For example, environmental enrichment results in various neurotransmitter alterations, significantly affecting serotonin. To test the efficacy of novel antidepressant drugs in the preclinical laboratory setting, researchers commonly implement the forced swim test (FST) for rats or mice. However, the effect of environmental enrichment on the expression of depressive-like states in the FST is unclear, and it is unknown whether environmental enrichment or social isolation can alter the efficacy of the commonly prescribed antidepressant drug, fluoxetine. In the present study, locomotor activity and FST performance were measured after 30 days of rearing in enriched (<b>EC),</b> <b>standard</b> (SC), and isolated (IC) conditions. Results showed that regardless of the significant effect of fluoxetine on locomotor activity in EC, SC, and IC rats, fluoxetine failed to increase swimming and decrease immobility in all three environmental conditions, with enriched-fluoxetine rats displaying significantly less swimming behavior in the FST than enriched rats receiving vehicle control injections. These results suggest that differential rearing, specifically environmental enrichment, can alter the efficacy of antidepressants and may suggest that enrichment reverses the effects of fluoxetine...|$|E

It {{has been known for}} several years that an attacker generating these constants and seeing a long enough stretch of Dual EC output bits can predict all future outputs; but TLS does not natu-rally provide a long enough stretch of output bits, and the cost of an attack turns out to depend heavily on choices made in implementing the RNG and on choices made in implementing other parts of TLS. Specifically, this paper investigates OpenSSL-FIPS, Windows ’ SChannel, and the C/C++ and Java versions of the RSA BSAFE library. This paper shows that Dual EC exploitability is fragile, and in particular is stopped by an outright bug in the certified Dual EC implementation in OpenSSL. On the other hand, this paper also shows that Dual EC exploitability benefits from a modification made to the Dual <b>EC</b> <b>standard</b> in 2007; from several attack op-timizations introduced here; and from various proposed TLS extensions, one of which is implemented in BSAFE, though disabled in the version we obtained and stud-ied.

The rodent forced swim test (FST) is commonly used as a preclinical model of depression, with increases in escape-directed behavior reflecting antidepressant effects, and increases in immobility reflecting behavioral despair. Environmental enrichment leads to serotonergic alterations in rats, but it is unknown whether these alterations may influence the efficacy of common antidepressants. Male Sprague-Dawley rats were reared in enriched (<b>EC),</b> <b>standard</b> (SC), or isolated (IC) conditions. Following the rearing period, fluoxetine (10 or 20 mg/kg, i. p.) was administered 23. 5 hrs, 5 hrs, and 1 hr before locomotor and FST measures. Following locomotor testing and FST exposure, rats were weighed to assess fluoxetine-, FST-, and environmental condition-induced moderations in weight gain. Results revealed an antidepressant effect of environmental enrichment and a depressant effect of isolation. Regardless of significant fluoxetine effects on locomotor activity, fluoxetine generally decreased swimming and increased immobility in all three environmental conditions, with IC-fluoxetine (10 mg/kg) rats and EC-fluoxetine (20 mg/kg) rats swimming less than vehicle counterparts. Subchronic 20 mg/kg fluoxetine also induced significant weight loss, and differential rearing appeared to moderate weight gain following FST stress. These results suggest that differential rearing has the ability to alter FST behaviors, fluoxetine efficacy, and post-stressor well-being. Moreover, 20 mg/kg fluoxetine, administered subchronically, may lead to atypical effects of those commonly observed in the FST, highlighting the importance and impact of both environmental condition and dosing regimen in common animal models of depression...|$|E

In this report model choices and input data are described and discussed in detail. Model {{results indicate that}} at present nitrate concentrations are stable or slightly decreasing. The results also show that in 2030 the nitrate contents in the pumping stations located in the 'Achterhoek' will not exceed the EC drinking standard (50 mg L- 1), while in 'Twente' several pumping stations will exceed the <b>EC</b> <b>standard</b> after 2030. Special {{attention is paid to}} denitrification. All calculations are performed twice: with and without denitrification. It appears that denitrification leads to concentrations one order of magnitude lower than when denitrification is not taken into account. The groundwater qualitity situation in 2000 is not sufficiently known to be used as an initial condition. Therefore, the year 1950 has been chosen as the start of the simulation period. Errors due to an incorrect estimate of the situation in 1950 are small, when predictions for 2000 - 2030 are considered. Simulated data for the period before 2000 and measurements collected since 1968 are compared. For the majority of pumping stations the model results appear to be higher than the measured values.

Oocysts and cysts were visualized by using a fluorescent monoclonal antibody staining technique. For distilled water, the highest percent recovery for both the oocysts and cysts was obtained with the FM depth filter. However, when a 5 -s backwash was applied, the EC-HV membrane filter (EC-HV-R) was superior to other filters for recovery of both oocysts (n = 53 ± 15. 4 per 10 liters) and cysts (n = 59 ± 11. 5 per 10 liters). This was followed by results of the FM depth filter (oocysts, 28. 2 ± 8, P = 0. 015; cysts, 49. 8 ± 12. 2, P = 0. 4260), and SMF (oocysts, 16. 2 ± 2. 8, P = 0. 0079; cysts, 35. 2 ± 3, P = 0. 0079). Similar results were obtained with surface water samples. Giardia cysts were recovered at higher rates than were Cryptosporidium oocysts with all five filters, regardless of backwashing.

40|$|Aqueous {{aerosols}} {{produced by}} nebulizers used in clinical situations can rapidly change {{size as the}} patient inhales. This is caused by air with a relative humidity (RH) lower than inside the nebulizer being entrained and mixed with nebulized aerosol during the inhalation maneuver. A way to assess the change in size is to measure the aerosol in a test method that reflects the clinical situation. The <b>EC</b> <b>standard,</b> EN 13544 - 1, offers a first step towards this assessment. In this paper we have tested two nebulizer designs, one conventional constant output nebulizer and one breath-enhanced nebulizer, using the proposed standard {{in order to assess}} the effect of the relative humidity of entrained ambient air on nebulized aerosol size properties. The results indicate that aerosol size from the conventional nebulizer is greatly affected by the RH of the entrained air, while the breath-enhanced nebulizer is not affected. The results agree with theoretical expectations of how the entrained air interacts with nebulized aerosol. In the breath-enhanced nebulizer, the air is passed through the nebulizer interior and becomes saturated with moisture drawn from the relatively large nebulizer reservoir solution. With the conventional constant output nebulizer, ambient air is drawn over the nebulizer and draws its moisture from the relatively small volume of nebulized aerosol released from the nebulizer. For the conventional nebulizer design, we found a large decrease in measured nebulized aerosol size with decreasing relative humidity- 3. 1 mum MMAD at 75 % RH fell to 1. 9 mum MMAD at 20 % RH. For the breath-enhanced nebulizer design, the MMAD was stable between a similar humidity range. The results indicate that aerosol size is dependent on relative humidity of the entrained air for the constant output jet nebulizer design that has no air entrainment through the nebulizer. We found no significant effect of ambient humidity of entrained air on nebulized aerosol size from the breath-enhanced nebulizer design...|$|E
40|$|Problems {{related to}} Dioxins {{contamination}} in Southern Vietnam are until now still a hot newsreel and controversy subject in international conferences {{as well as}} in many articles. The adverse effects of Dioxins residue from chemicals used by U. S. Army during the Vietnam War (Ranch Hand Operation 1961 to 1971) have caused many consequences not only to Vietnamese ecosystem and people but also to the U. S army veterans that participated in the war at that period as reported in many scientific reports. In Vietnam, since 1980 many studies have been carried out in collaboration with overseas scientists and laboratories on Dioxin contamination levels as well as its influences on ecosystem and human health. However, regardless of many efforts, up to now the problem of Dioxin contamination and its consequences is not yet completely and appropriately solved. There is still relative high Dioxins residue in the areas named as "hot spot" in Southern Vietnam and its contamination is causing the adverse effects on local residents. Nowadays, studies on this subject are relatively difficult to perform due to many factors: over 30 years passed; land use disturbance; degradation and transfer of dioxin into biological food web; population emigration; etc [...] In addition, a lack of related documents and military secrets also contributed to this. With the support of SDC in frame of a collaboration project between Vietnam and Switzerland, we have carried out the research named "Sources and Fate of PCDDs and PCDFs in rural and urban ecosystem and food chains of South-Vietnam". Our research has examined integratelly the PCDD/Fs sources with special regard on the PCDD/Fs source from the war, but also consider the others possible sources such industrial and municipal combustions, agricultural used chemicals, etc. The selected locations for our research have been set up based on collected document from Division 10 - 80 and Office 33 (two responsible organizations for Dioxins and related problems in Vietnam) : CamLo District – QuangTri Province; DaNang City; MaDa Forest and BienHoa City (BienHoa Airforce Base and BienHung Lake) – DongNai Province; and industrial zone – Thu Duc – Hochiminh City. Seventeen 2, 3, 7, 8 -PCDD/Fs congeners have been chosen for our research due to their high toxicities. Soil, sediment, municipal waste incinerator (MWI) bottom ash, fish tissue, and human adipose are selected as the matrices to examine the PCDD/Fs residue. The result showed that even after more than 30 years, the PCDD/Fs concentration based on i-TEQ value (especially for 2, 3, 7, 8 -TCDD) is still higher than guideline values in some countries: very high i-TEQ value in cultivate soil of CamLo district and DaNang City. For the area named "hot spot" such BienHoa Airforce Base and BienHung Lake, the i-TEQ value and 2, 3, 7, 8 -TCDD concentration in soil and sediment are superior than values proposed by Agency for Toxic Substance and Disease Registry (ATSDR), Canadian Council of Ministers of the Environment (CCME) and U. S Environmental Protection Agency (U. S. EPA). The PCDD/Fs concentration in fish tissue of BienHung Lake (catfish and snake-head) is superior in comparison with European Council (<b>EC)</b> <b>standard.</b> The dioxin contamination risk for local resident health is very high {{due to the lack of}} information and inconsiderable attention of responsible organizations about this problem. As BienHoa was selected as a case-study for PCDD/Fs transfer in food chain, using statistic methods (cluster analysis and Principal Component Analysis - PCA), we have showed a high similarity of PCDD/Fs profiles pattern between BienHoa Airforce Base soils, BienHung Lake sediments and fish tissue. The similarity in PCDD/Fs relative i-TEQ profiles between MWIs bottom ash and soil of industrial zone ThuDuc proves that industrial and municipal combustions are responsible sources for PCDD/Fs in the soil of such these zones. However in comparison with the sites contaminated by Agent Orange (A. O) /Dioxin, the PCDD/Fs contamination level in the industrial soil is lower and mainly dominated by PCDFs than PCDDs. The result also showed comparables i-TEQ values in BienHoa residents with inhabitants of industrial countries, however Vietnam is only developing and agricultural country. Beside that, 2, 3, 7, 8 -TCDD has been detected in many tested cases. 2, 3, 7, 8 -TCDD is the most toxic compound and related to the A. O/Dioxins from the war, unfortunately we have not enough data to assess the relationship between A. O/Dioxin residue and these samples. To find out this relationship it is necessary an integrated large-scale investigation. Result of our research serves as a base for set-up a reference laboratory for PCDD/Fs and dioxin-liked compounds research in the South of Vietnam. At present time, a small laboratory for PCDD/Fs analysis has been installed in IER and serves as a member of VietNam Dioxin Research Network...|$|E

Our estimates are derived from data on ambient air quality in selected CEE locations, together with a model that links these ambient conditions to physical impacts on health and attaches economic values (in dollar terms) to these impacts. Given data limitations, our focus here is on three pollutants: particulates (PM), sulfur dioxide (SO 2), and lead (Pb). Our data set includes ambient concentrations for these pollutants in four CEE countries: Bulgaria, Hungary, Poland, and Ukraine. Given the ambient data, dose-response functions taken from the clinical and epidemiological literature in the U. S., Canada, and Western Europe are used to generate estimates of the change in physical effects. These effects then are given an economic value by applying two approaches for scaling unit valuation figures applicable to the U. S. A Monte Carlo model is constructed to propagate the uncertainties of the dose-response functions and unit values to obtain confidence intervals on the total benefits from pollutant reductions in each country. We examine scenarios where the CEE countries improve ambient conditions for the pollutants in question to meet European Community (<b>EC)</b> <b>standards</b> and then compare these scenarios to ones involving uniform percentage ambient reductions across locations in each country.

40|$|International audienceDifferent mass {{analysers}} [(quadrupole (Q), time-of-flight (TOF) and multicollector (MC) sector-field (SF) ] of ions {{produced in}} an {{inductively coupled plasma}} were evaluated for the determination of lead isotope ratios in wine samples. A population of 20 wines of different origin including two reference wines from the <b>EC</b> <b>Standards,</b> Measurement and Testing Programme with concentrations varying between 7 - 140 ?g Pb l- 1 was investigated. Wines were analyzed directly by Q ICP MS and MC ICP MS. The poor sensitivity of the TOF instrument, further aggravated by matrix signal suppression, did not allow the acquisition of data for wine samples that contained less than 50 ?g l- 1 in the direct sample introduction mode. The separation and preconcentration of lead were therefore required. The precision obtained for the 206 Pb/ 207 Pb and 208 Pb/ 206 Pb were similar and equal to 0. 14 - 2. 7 % for Q ICP MS, 0. 04 - 0. 17 % for TOF ICP MS and 0. 01 - 0. 12 % for MC ICP MS. The precision for 206 Pb/ 204 Pb was 0. 44 - 5. 29, 0. 15 - 1. 7, 0. 08 - 1. 6 %, respectively. On the level of accuracy, the data from TOF ICP MS and MC ICP MS were in good agreement. The accuracy of Q ICP MS data was judged satisfactory {{in comparison with the}} other techniques but their poor precision was a significant obstacle on the way of using these data for the determination of the geographic origin of wine. © 2001 Elsevier Science B.

40|$|Incidence of faecal {{coliforms}} in shell fish harvesting {{areas of the}} southern coastal district of Karnataka was examined for evaluating the sanitary quality {{in relation to the}} seasonal monsoon and river runoff. Faecal coliforms counts in seawater, mussel tissue and sediments were highest in monsoon. Geometric mean for FC in seawater was below 14 MPN/ 100 ml, standard set for approved area under NSSP classification during fishing seasons, bu the 90 th percentile were higher. The tissue E. coli levels complied with the <b>EC</b> Directive <b>standard</b> under the catagory A, during mussel fishing season commencing in October in the two mussel beds. MPN FC levels were strongly influenced by the seasonal variations in precipitation and river runoff. During the fishing seasons in pre monsoon and post monsoon months. the levels were below the limits...|$|R
