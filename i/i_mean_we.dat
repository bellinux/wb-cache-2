25|$|On 11 December 1998, Senior Minister Lee Kuan Yew {{responded to}} a gay man's {{question}} about the place of homosexuals in Singapore, live on CNN International by saying, '...what we are doing as a government is to leave people to live their own lives {{so long as they}} don't impinge on other people. <b>I</b> <b>mean,</b> <b>we</b> don't harass anybody.' Given Lee's stature as the venerated albeit authoritarian founding father of independent Singapore, these words helped set the tenor for official policy on homosexuality for many years to come. His comments may be {{regarded as one of the}} most significant events, as far as gay rights are concerned, of the decade.|$|E
500|$|While {{the group}} were {{considering}} {{a replacement for}} Bayley, Rod Smallwood convinced Steve Harris to invite Bruce Dickinson back into the band. Although Harris admits that he [...] "wasn't really into it" [...] at first, he then thought, [...] "'Well, if the change happens, who should we get?' The thing is, we know Bruce {{and we know what}} he's capable of, and you think, 'Well, better the devil you know.' <b>I</b> <b>mean,</b> <b>we</b> got on well professionally for, like, eleven years, and so... after I thought about it, I didn't really have a problem with it." ...|$|E
500|$|Sean Kinney {{said about}} the band's reunion: [...] "I never called Jerry; he never called me, and said, ’Hey, let’s get the band back together,’ you know? We had been taking every step {{extremely}} cautious and slow, and just doing whatever feels right: If it’s genuine and we’re doing it for genuine reasons and we’re all okay with it then we take a little step. None of us is broke. Nobody {{needs to be a}} rock dork, and you know, stroke their ego. <b>I</b> <b>mean,</b> <b>we</b> don’t really operate like that. So as long as it felt good and from the right place and it’s about making music and carrying on…".|$|E

500|$|Davis {{used the}} show to {{audition}} two new members—tenor saxophonist Azar Lawrence and guitarist Dominique Gaumont. Lawrence was the most highly regarded young saxophonist at the time, while Gaumont was enlisted by Davis in response to incumbent guitarist Reggie Lucas's demand for a pay raise. Although it was unexpected, Liebman later characterized the move as typical of the trumpeter: [...] "What he was doing—which he often does at big kinda gigs like that—is change the shit up, by doing something totally out. Totally unexpected. <b>I</b> <b>mean,</b> <b>we</b> had been a band together {{on the road for}} a year... And then, suddenly, a live date, New York City, Carnegie Hall, the cat pulls two cats who never even saw each other. I mean, you gotta say, 'Is the man mad or is he – he's either mad or extremely subtle." ...|$|E
500|$|In January 2017, Mike Inez {{stated in}} an {{interview}} that the band had begun work on a new album. In June 2017, it was reported that the band would return to Studio X in Seattle to record a new album later that month, for a tentative early 2018 release. The sessions will be helmed by Nick Raskulinecz, who produced the band's last two albums. Studio X was the studio where Alice in Chains recorded its 1995 self-titled album. According to Inez, the band is not currently signed to a label, having completed its previous two-record contract with the Universal Music Group. [...] "This , we're not sure where it's gonna land... <b>I</b> <b>mean,</b> <b>we</b> financed [...] on our own too, so we're not too worried about that stuff. We've just gotta get it out to ... a significant label [...]" ...|$|E
500|$|Adam Sweeney of Film School Rejects was {{positive}} about the episode, [...] "For {{anyone who has been}} complaining that Lost had been too slow lately, here you go. Those who watched 'The Variable' saw more action than (basketball player) Wilt Chamberlain. They, and by they <b>I</b> <b>mean</b> <b>we,</b> also got a clear explanation of how the islanders got onto the island. You wanted answers, you got them." [...] Sweeney also believed Davies's acting was the [...] "high point" [...] of the episode. David Oliver of CHUD.com gave the episode an 8.6 rating out of 10, and commented that it was a [...] "good" [...] episode, though he was [...] "bummed" [...] to see Daniel go. Oliver also said that while the episode did [...] "very little" [...] to advance the season storyline significantly, there were [...] "some significant" [...] developments and revelations in it. TV Verdict's Stephen Lackey said the episode was [...] "fast paced" [...] and featured [...] "one exciting twist after another".|$|E

500|$|At the time, it was {{unheard of}} for a debuting artist {{to receive the}} coveted rating. Author Matthew Gasteier writes, “It's {{difficult}} to overestimate the impact of receiving the five out of five mics, the first such rating given to any new release by the magazine since its then-editor Reginald Dennis put a moratorium on them." [...] Reginald Dennis, former music editor of the magazine and XXL co-founder, later recounted, [...] "Awarding records 5 mics – classic status – has always been, on some levels, troubling to me. <b>I</b> <b>mean,</b> <b>we</b> are not only saying that a particular piece of music is superior to everything that is out now, {{but it will be}} better than most things released in the future as well [...] I only gave one 5 under my watch and it went to Nas's Illmatic." [...] Dennis cited it as [...] "the only time I ever broke the 'no 5' rule" [...] and added, [...] "I told Jon that we'd work all of that stuff out {{when it was time to}} review the album. But everyday, Jon was like, 'yo, this album is 5 mics — seriously, Reg, 5 mics!' ...|$|E
500|$|On February 15 {{the session}} began at 6p.m. but Dylan simply {{sat in the}} studio working on his lyrics while the musicians played cards, napped and chatted. Finally, at 4a.m., Dylan called the musicians in and {{outlined}} {{the structure of the}} song. Dylan counted off and the musicians fell in, as he attempted his epic composition [...] "Sad Eyed Lady of the Lowlands". Kenny Buttrey recalled, [...] "If you notice that record, that thing after like the second chorus starts building and building like crazy, and everybody's just peaking it up 'cause we thought, Man, this is it... This is gonna be the last chorus and we've gotta put everything into it we can. And he played another harmonica solo and went back down to another verse and the dynamics had to drop back down to a verse kind of feel... After about ten minutes of this thing we're cracking up at each other, at what we were doing. <b>I</b> <b>mean,</b> <b>we</b> peaked five minutes ago. Where do we go from here?" [...] The finished song clocked in at 11 minutes, 23 seconds, and would occupy the entire fourth side of the album.|$|E
500|$|On March 15, 2012, Rihanna {{explained}} her {{collaboration with}} Brown to Ryan Seacrest during his morning show: [...] "The first song that came about was 'Birthday Cake'. <b>I</b> <b>mean,</b> <b>we</b> ended up recording {{them at the}} same time and executing them together. But I reached out to him about doing 'Birthday Cake' because that’s the only person that, really, it made sense to do the record. Just as a musician, despite everything else, that was going to be the person. You know I thought about rappers, and I’ve done that so many times, and the hottest R artist out right now is Chris Brown. So I wanted him on the track, and then in turn he was like, ‘Why don’t you do the remix to my track?’ and it was a trade-off. We did two records. One for my fans, one for his fans, and that way our fans can come together. There shouldn’t be a divide. You know? It’s music, and it’s innocent." [...] In March 2012, American rapper Fabolous released his own verse to the [...] "Birthday Cake" [...] remix. The following month, Rick Ross also released the track featuring an added rap verse from himself, along with the previously incorporated Chris Brown verses. Busta Rhymes released his own freestyle to the song along with rapper Reek da Villian.|$|E

2500|$|She is as {{involved}} {{as you can}} be in the recording process. This was a very good and big surprise for me!

[...] And absolutely not... <b>I</b> <b>mean</b> <b>we</b> co-produced the track and it's not just written on the credits [...] "co-produced by Martin Solveig and Madonna", we literally co-produced the tracks.

2500|$|During {{the writing}} and {{recording}} of One Hot Minute (1995), Flea integrated some use of slap-bass progressions, {{but continued to}} center his technique around the philosophy of [...] "less is more" [...] rather than complexity: [...] "I can't even think of anything I played that was complex even the slapping stuff is simple. It's original-sounding, and I'm proud of that– but what I played was {{more a matter of}} aesthetic choice." [...] This led Flea to alter the way he wrote music by playing alone, instead of the jam sessions that would dictate how the band conceived songs: [...] " [...] is the least jam-oriented record we've made. <b>I</b> <b>mean,</b> <b>we</b> definitely jammed on the ideas, but there's only one groove on the whole album that came from a jam, 'Deep Kick'. The rest of it came from my sitting down with a guitar or bass." ...|$|E

2500|$|Jovovich {{explained}} that the business folded because of increased demands on both her and Hawk's time, and because the business simply grew too big for them.

If you look at how much of our page is taken up with ads compared to the average search query. The average for us is a little less than 10 percent of the pages and the average for search is about 20 percent taken up with ads... That's the simplest thing we could do. But we aren't like that.
