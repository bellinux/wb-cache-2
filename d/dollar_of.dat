5|$|The wreath on {{the reverse}} is also derivative, having been {{previously}} used on Longacre's Type II gold <b>dollar</b> <b>of</b> 1854, and the three-dollar piece of the same year. It is composed of leaves of wheat, corn, cotton and tobacco, thus including produce associated with both the North and the South. The cotton leaves are sometimes said to be maple leaves; the two types are not dissimilar, and maple leaves are more widely known than cotton leaves. An ear of corn is also visible.|$|E
5|$|Fare is payable by MetroCard. Since {{this card}} enables free {{transfers}} for a continuing {{ride on the}} subway and bus systems, for many more riders there is effectively no fare at all for riding SIR. Riders are also allowed to transfer between a Staten Island bus, SIR, and a Manhattan bus or subway near South Ferry. Because of this, the SIR's farebox recovery ratio in 2001 was 0.16that is, for every <b>dollar</b> <b>of</b> expense, 16 cents was recovered in fares, the lowest ratio of MTA agencies. The low farebox recovery ratio {{is part of the}} reason the MTA wishes to merge the SIR with the subway proper which will simplify the accounting and subsidization of what is essentially a single line.|$|E
5|$|In 2005, the Puerto Rican Nationalist Party {{issued a}} limited amount of {{banknotes}} commemorating the Jayuya Uprising. The series included pesos of six denominations, including $1, $5, $10, $20, $50 and $100 bills. The designs of all banknotes feature Pedro Albizu Campos in the front side while the reverses are adorned with the flags of Puerto Rico, Jayuya and the Nationalist Party. Microprint with the names of Pedro Albizu Campos and Filiberto Ojeda Ríos are found throughout the pesos. On July 10, 2005, Liberty <b>Dollar</b> <b>of</b> Puerto Rico was created by Alfredo Pacheco Martínez. Silver ounces began circulating on October 8, 2005, marking {{the first time that a}} silver coin was distributed in more than a century. After an intervention with parent company Liberty Services concluded with its assets being confiscated, leading to a process that resulted in the indictment and conviction of founder Bernard von NotHaus, Pacheco Martínez continued to circulate the coins under the name of Dólar Boricua. In August 2010, he was also indicted on the same charges faced by Von NotHaus. Pacheco Martínez was found guilty on June 29, 2012, being subsequently sentenced to 19 years in prison.|$|E

25|$|Louisiana taxpayers {{receive more}} federal funding per <b>dollar</b> <b>of</b> federal taxes paid {{compared}} to the average state. Per <b>dollar</b> <b>of</b> federal tax collected in 2005, Louisiana citizens received approximately $1.78 {{in the way of}} federal spending. This ranks the state fourth highest nationally and represents a rise from 1995 when Louisiana received $1.35 per <b>dollar</b> <b>of</b> taxes in federal spending (ranked seventh nationally). Neighboring states and the amount of federal spending received per <b>dollar</b> <b>of</b> federal tax collected were: Texas ($0.94), Arkansas ($1.41), and Mississippi ($2.02). Federal spending in 2005 and subsequent years since has been exceptionally high due to the recovery from Hurricane Katrina.|$|E
25|$|Australia and New Zealand have a {{dividend}} imputation system, wherein companies can attach franking credits or imputation credits to dividends. These franking credits represent the tax {{paid by the}} company upon its pre-tax profits. One <b>dollar</b> <b>of</b> company tax paid generates one franking credit. Companies can attach any proportion of franking up to a maximum amount that is calculated from the prevailing company tax rate: for each <b>dollar</b> <b>of</b> dividend paid, the maximum level of franking is the company tax rate divided by (1 - company tax rate). At the current 30% rate, this works out at 0.30 of a credit per 70 cents of dividend, or 42.857 cents per <b>dollar</b> <b>of</b> dividend. The shareholders {{who are able to}} use them, apply these credits against their income tax bills at a rate of a dollar per credit, thereby effectively eliminating the double taxation of company profits.|$|E

25|$|With Mississippi's fiscal conservatism, {{in which}} Medicaid, welfare, food stamps, {{and other social}} {{programs}} are often cut, eligibility requirements are tightened, and stricter employment criteria are imposed, Mississippi ranks as having the second-highest ratio of spending to tax receipts of any state. In 2005, Mississippi citizens received approximately $2.02 per <b>dollar</b> <b>of</b> taxes {{in the way of}} federal spending. This ranks the state 2nd highest nationally, and represents an increase from 1995, when Mississippi received $1.54 per <b>dollar</b> <b>of</b> taxes in federal spending and was 3rd highest nationally. This figure is based on federal spending after large portions of the state were devastated by Hurricane Katrina, requiring large amounts of federal aid from the Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA). However, from 1981 to 2005, it was at least number four in the nation for federal spending vs. taxes received.|$|E

When the first check came after I entered the firm, Mr. Thurmond brought to my desk one-third of the amount of the check, explaining what it was for. I said to him that I was a member of the Legislature, representing the people of Fannin County, and that my experience had taught me that men who represent the people should be as far removed as possible from concerns whose interests he was liable to be called on to legislate concerning, and that on that ground I would not accept a <b>dollar</b> <b>of</b> the railroad's money, though I was legally entitled to it. I never did take a <b>dollar</b> <b>of</b> it. I have been guided by the principle in all my dealings.|$|E

25|$|The {{predominant}} currency {{produced by}} the Central Mint was the silver dollar.

This, {{and the fact that the}} coin was made of silver, enabled them to be circulated in the rest of China; thus, it was the currency of choice.|$|E

25|$|Sydney {{has been}} a {{manufacturing}} city since the protectionist policies of the 1920s. By 1961 the industry accounted for 39% of all employment and by 1970 over 30% of all Australian manufacturing jobs were in Sydney. Its status has declined in more recent decades, making up 12.6% of employment in 2001 and 8.5% in 2011. Between 1970 and 1985 there was a loss of 180,000 manufacturing jobs. The city is still the largest manufacturing centre in Australia. Its manufacturing output of $21.7 billion in 2013 was {{greater than that of}} Melbourne with $18.9 billion. Observers have noted Sydney's focus on the domestic market and high-tech manufacturing as reasons for its resilience against the high Australian <b>dollar</b> <b>of</b> the early 2010s.|$|E
25|$|The 24 {{stars on}} the reverse convey the same message that the 2★4 on the obverse of some {{specimens}} does—that Missouri was the 24th state to enter the Union.

Three-quarters of the banks in the Federal Reserve System reopened within the next three days. Billions of dollars in hoarded currency and gold flowed back into them within a month, thus stabilizing the banking system. By the end of 1933, 4,004 small local banks were permanently closed and merged into larger banks. Their deposits totalled $3.6billion; depositors lost a total of $540million, and eventually received on average 85 cents on the <b>dollar</b> <b>of</b> their deposits; it is a common myth that they received nothing back.|$|E
