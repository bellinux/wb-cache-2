5|$|Finally, the Court {{expressed}} {{the view that}} if free speech is to be favoured over the protection of reputation in applying a Reynolds-type defence, another issue {{that will have to}} be considered is what balance should be struck between the two competing interests. In this connection, Chan C.J. said that the court would have to decide whether freedom of expression is to be given preference over the protection of reputation, whether it is a fundamental right that trumps the protection of reputation unless it is shown that the <b>defamatory</b> <b>statement</b> was made maliciously, or whether it is co-equal with the protection of reputation.|$|E

Zeman was fined, but ignored the court ruling and never apologised.|$|E

25|$|One {{defense is}} {{reporting}} or passing through information {{as a general}} information or warning of dangerous or emergency conditions, and intent to defame must be proven. Also, {{the truth of the}} allegedly <b>defamatory</b> <b>statement</b> will always negate the claim (whether because the plaintiff fails to meet his/her burden of proving falsity or because the defendant proves the statement to be true).|$|E
500|$|The Chief Justice also {{suggested}} that the rationale in the Reynolds case might be given effect by continuing to find the defendant liable for defamation but {{reducing the amount of}} damages payable depending on how much care he or she took to ensure the accuracy of the information published. He noted: [...] "There is no reason why a defendant who has published a <b>defamatory</b> <b>statement</b> should be allowed to get off scot-free for injuring the plaintiff's reputation simply because he has satisfied the 'responsible journalism' test." ...|$|E
500|$|The {{questions}} during Verrilli's argument {{focused on}} the lack of injury caused by false claims of military honors. In nearly all the cases that the United States cited to support the proposition that there is no First Amendment value in falsity, the Court had addressed a false statement that harmed another, such as a <b>defamatory</b> <b>statement.</b> Relying on these cases, Verrilli stated, [...] "his Court has said in numerous contexts, numerous contexts, that the calculated factual falsehood has no First Amendment value for its own sake." [...] Justice Anthony Kennedy immediately retorted: ...|$|E

Maddox and two other Brawley advisers accused Assistant District Attorney Steven Pagones of abducting and raping Brawley. A grand jury exonerated Pagones and suggested that Brawley had concocted a hoax. Pagones sued Brawley and the three advisers for $395 million for twenty two alleged <b>defamatory</b> <b>statements.</b> A jury awarded Pagones a total of $345,000 in damages, with Maddox being found liable for $95,000 for two <b>defamatory</b> <b>statements.</b>|$|R

500|$|The case {{first went}} before Fulford J in the Queen's Bench Division of the High Court of Justice, with Fulford's {{judgment}} delivered on 16 October 2004. In it, he {{held that the}} High Court was bound to apply Bonnard v Perryman, but granted an injunction {{until such time as}} a more senior court could determine Bonnards status. The case then went to the Court of Appeal of England and Wales, where it was heard by May, Dyson and Brooke LJJ; Brooke delivered a judgment for the entire court on 5 November 2004. In it, the court refused to extend the [...] "more likely or not" [...] test found in the Human Rights Act 1998 to cover defamation as well as breach of confidentiality (the subject of the Cream case). While Brooke noted that the Bonnard test was inflexible, he also considered the distinction between defamation and breach of confidentiality; while [...] "confidentiality, once breached, is lost for ever", if a <b>defamatory</b> <b>statement</b> is taken to trial and the claimant wins, he or she is vindicated and suffers no lasting harm. As such, the Cream test should not be applied, because it would violate the delicate balance between the right to privacy and the freedom of the press.|$|E
2500|$|In {{the various}} states, whether by case law or legislation, there are {{generally}} several [...] "privileges" [...] {{that can get}} a defamation case dismissed without proceeding to trial. [...] These include the litigation privilege, which makes statements made {{in the context of}} litigation non-actionable, and the allegedly <b>defamatory</b> <b>statement</b> being [...] "fair comment and criticism", as it is important to society that everyone be able to comment on matters of public interest. The United States Supreme Court, however, has declined to hold that the [...] "fair comment" [...] privilege is a constitutional imperative.|$|E

According to Dickinson's attorney, Lisa Bloom, [...] "Calling Dickinson a liar is a <b>defamatory</b> <b>statement</b> {{under the law}} ... and that's the mistake Bill Cosby made." [...] Later court filings included sworn statements from friends and colleagues who confirm that Dickinson has provided a consistent story for many years about her alleged abuse. Pablo Fenjves, Dickinson's ghostwriter, as well as former ReganBooks president Judith Regan, both assert that Dickinson came forward with her allegations for her 2002 autobiography, {{but they were not}} included in the book because ReganBooks' parent company HarperCollins was afraid of being sued by Cosby.|$|E

50|$|Art Schreiber, an {{attorney}} for Werner Erhard and his organization Werner Erhard and Associates, stated {{that the fact that}} a <b>defamatory</b> <b>statement</b> had previously been published in another publication was not a proper defense against a possible claim of libel.|$|E
50|$|The law {{provides}} {{a number of}} defences, particularly when reporting on matters of public interest or concern. Truth of the <b>defamatory</b> <b>statement</b> is available as a defence in most libel cases other than those concerning {{the privacy of the}} plaintiff. Where privacy is infringed, truth is not an absolute defence, though some latitude is permitted if the plaintiff is a public figure. A plea of good faith is permitted by the courts in circumstances where the issues at stake concern matters of public interest. A defendant may be acquitted on that basis if the court is satisfied that the defendant has carried out at least a basic verification of the source of the information on which the <b>defamatory</b> <b>statement</b> is based.|$|E

5000|$|Therefore, the Court {{held that}} the {{language}} of Doe 6’s posts were not actionable <b>defamatory</b> <b>statements.</b> Rather, “they fall {{into the category of}} crude, satirical hyperbole which, while reflecting the immaturity of the speaker, constitute protected opinion under the First Amendment.” ...|$|R
50|$|The {{subsequent}} challenge The College Network raised {{was against}} the awards for lost profits. They claimed that Moore Education Publishers were already suffering from declining sales, and the <b>defamatory</b> <b>statements</b> did not precipitate this decline. Furthermore, the calculation for lost profits was calculated on a national scale, against the regional nature of the <b>defamatory</b> <b>statements.</b> The court waives both arguments as neither were raised or submitted specifically during the lower court case. Moreover, {{based on the evidence}} the defendants provide, Moore Educational Publishers had reasons to see a rise in profits from recent business maneuvers, such as an improved sales staff, an endorsement from an online college, and an economy seeing a rise in school enrollment.|$|R
