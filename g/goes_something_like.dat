25|$|Palestinians {{have sought}} to retroactively judge Israeli actions in the 1940s under new norms {{developing}} {{in the late twentieth}} and early twenty-first centuries. But international law does not work like that. Though it is no doubt deeply unsatisfying to Palestinians and their many supporters, the correct legal {{answer to the question of}} whether the 1947–49 refugees have a right of return under international law <b>goes</b> <b>something</b> <b>like</b> this: even if (or assuming that) the Israelis did intentionally expel every Palestinian refugee, it was not illegal when it occurred, though it almost certainly would be if done today under the same circumstances; and the law at the time did not require repatriation of the refugees to Israel, though it most likely would if the expulsion were to occur today.|$|E

'Cause I got {{something}} to say about it, And it <b>goes</b> <b>something</b> <b>like</b> this." [...] Handclaps and drum beats start as Madonna moves into the chorus of the song, with a thick vocal texture and high-pitched background singing. The chorus is aided by instrumentation from a saxophone and percussion. Madonna then sings the first verse of the song, as a violin sound is added after she finishes the bridge, [...] "Make you feel like a queen on the throne, make you love it till you never come down", a male voice repeating the last line. A synthesizer is played after the second verse as Madonna continues chanting the words [...] "Express yourself" [...] with background vocals singing [...] "Hey, hey, hey, hey" [...] alongside her.|$|E

Second, if we {{reconstruct}} a ship using all of the old planks, etc. from the Ship of Theseus, and we also have a ship that was built out of new boards (each added one-by-one over time to replace old decaying boards), which ship is the real Ship of Theseus? ...|$|E

2500|$|The {{ubiquitous}} rubric [...] "criticism of Israel", however, {{has also}} come to designate another kind of discourse—one that has almost become a politico-rhetorical genre unto itself, with its own identifiable vocabulary, narrative conventions, and predictable outcomes. At its ideational core is what the British scholar Bernard Harrison calls a [...] "dialectical scam". It <b>goes</b> <b>something</b> <b>like</b> this: (1) Spot an Israeli action that can serve as the ground of [...] "criticism of Israel" [...] (e.g., Israel's military incursion into the area near Jenin in April 2002 in response to Palestinian terrorist massacres); (2) Then [...] "dissent" [...] in the strongest possible terms, for instance by likening the [...] "razing of Jenin" [...] {{to the destruction of}} the Warsaw Ghetto, while anticipating that [...] "powerful" [...] and [...] "repressive" [...] Jewish institutions will try to [...] "silence" [...] the critics by calling them anti-Semites; (3) When taken to task by more sober-minded critics who find that, contrary to your charge, {{there was no such thing}} as [...] "the razing of Jenin" [...] and that the IDF has nothing in common with the SS, cry [...] "foul" [...] and claim their censure perfectly illustrates the point that there really is a Jewish organizational conspiracy to silence [...] "criticism of Israel" [...] by branding the authors of such criticism [...] "antisemites".|$|E
