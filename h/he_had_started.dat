5|$|At Cranbrook, Romney helped {{manage the}} ice hockey team, {{and he joined}} the pep squad. During his senior year, he joined the cross country running team. He belonged to eleven school {{organizations}} and school clubs overall, including the Blue Key Club, a booster group that <b>he</b> <b>had</b> <b>started.</b> During his final year there, his academic record improved but fell short of excellence.

5|$|During {{his stay}} in Mercia Wilfrid acted as bishop {{with the consent}} of King Æthelred. Information on Wilfrid's life at this time is meagre, as the Vita Sancti Wilfrithi says little of this period. He is {{generally}} considered to have been Bishop of Leicester until about 706, when he is held to have been transferred to Hexham. Wilfrid became involved in the missionary efforts to the Frisians, which <b>he</b> <b>had</b> <b>started</b> in 678 during his stay in Frisia. Wilfrid helped the missionary efforts of Willibrord, which were more successful than his own earlier attempts. Willibrord was a monk of Ripon who was also a native of Northumbria.|$|E
5|$|Following the {{completion}} of the third Four Quartets poem, The Dry Salvages, Eliot's health declined and he stayed in Shamley Green, Surrey while he recovered. During this time, Eliot started writing Little Gidding. The first draft was completed in July 1941 but he was dissatisfied with it. He believed the problems with the poem lay with his own inability to write, and that, precipitated by air raids on London, <b>he</b> <b>had</b> <b>started</b> the poem with too little preparation and had written it too quickly. After the first draft was written, he set the poem aside, and he left in September to lecture throughout Great Britain.|$|E

5|$|Icke met {{his first}} wife, Linda Atherton, in May 1971 at a {{dance at the}} Chesford Grange Hotel near Leamington Spa; she {{was working as a}} van driver for a garage. Shortly after they met, Icke had another of the huge rows <b>he</b> <b>had</b> <b>started</b> having with his father—always a domineering man, his father was upset that Icke's {{arthritis}} was interfering with his football career—so he packed his bags and left home. He moved into a bedsit and worked in a travel agency, travelling to Hereford twice a week in the evenings to play football.|$|E

About a year later he and his wife returned to England, and settled near Pulborough, West Sussex.|$|E
5|$|In 1971, Balabushka met Penndel, Pennsylvania native Gus Szamboti at a tournament. Szamboti {{had been}} working for RCA as a {{draftsman}} and designer, but RCA layoffs were common at the time, and <b>he</b> <b>had</b> <b>started</b> designing and selling pool cues as a more stable job path. Though he too started production with Titlist blanks as well as blanks manufactured by WICO of Chicago, Szamboti later began making his own. Balabushka was very impressed with Szamboti's blanks and, in addition to the two men becoming fast friends, he became Szamboti's first customer, buying blanks from him for $18 apiece.|$|E

5|$|The {{race was}} Alonso's second {{consecutive}} victory and his {{fourth of the}} 2010 season; <b>he</b> <b>had</b> <b>started</b> from pole position to win the Italian Grand Prix two weeks earlier.

In the Constructors' Championship Red Bull extended its lead to twenty-four points ahead of McLaren. Ferrari was a further forty points behind, with four races remaining in the season.|$|E
5|$|A {{frontline}} leg spinner and middle-order batsman, McCool was not {{prominent in}} the team's success. Although <b>he</b> <b>had</b> <b>started</b> his Test career strongly, McCool's form began to decline in the previous Australian season of 194748. In his first full Test season in 194647, which featured five Tests against England, McCool batted at No. 6 and scored 95 and 104 not out. He also took five wickets in an innings on two occasions. He ended the series with 272 runs {{at an average of}} 54.40 and took 18 wickets at just over 27 apiece. However, in the following season he made only 46 runs and took only three wickets in three Tests against India before being dropped. Nevertheless, McCool started the tour in Bradman's first-choice team, and was selected in the tour opener against Worcestershire and later against the MCC in his role as an all rounder.|$|E
