40|$|This study {{focuses on}} the {{composition}} of boards of directors and their monitoring committees (audit and compensation) for large Australian companies. For firms whose boards use a committee structure, much of the monitoring responsibility of the board is expected to rest with the independent committee members. We document a positive association between the proportion of independent directors on the <b>full</b> <b>board</b> and its monitoring committees, and {{a greater proportion of}} independent directors on both audit and compensation committees than the <b>full</b> <b>board.</b> Our hypotheses tests involve an examination of the impact of other mechanisms used to control agency conflicts on <b>full</b> <b>board</b> and committee independence, and the association between this independence and firm value. We find that <b>full</b> <b>board</b> independence is associated with low management ownership and an absence of substantial shareholders. Audit committee independence is associated with reduced monitoring by debtholders when leverage is low. While we predict a positive relationship between board and monitoring committee independence and firm value, our results do not support this conjecture...|$|R
