5|$|Campbell {{made his}} return to {{training}} in March 2011. Despite having seemingly recovered from the injury, Campbell suffered a recurrence of the ligament injury in the same knee {{in preparation for a}} match against Manchester City on 3 April 2011. After undergoing surgery on 20 April 2011, it was learned that Campbell would be out of action for 12 months. This injury ruled Campbell out of action {{for the remainder of the}} 2010–11 season and much of the 2011–12 season. Though he was proposed to return in March 2012, Steve Bruce revealed that Campbell was <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>frame</b> to return to action around Christmas time – three months ahead of schedule.|$|E
5|$|For {{landings}} and take-offs, wire flying riggings were devised and used. On location, {{these were}} suspended from tower cranes, {{whereas in the}} studio elaborate rigs were suspended from the studio ceilings. Some of the wire-flying work was quite audacious considering computer-controlled rigs were not then available—the penultimate shot where Superman flies out of the prison yard for example. Although stuntmen were used, Reeve did {{much of the work}} himself, and was suspended as high as 50feet in the air. Counterweights and pulleys were typically used to achieve flying movement, rather than electronic or motorized devices. The thin wires used to suspend Reeve were typically removed from the film in post-production using rotoscope techniques, although this wasn't necessary in all shots (in certain lighting conditions or when Superman is very distant <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>frame,</b> the wires were more or less imperceptible).|$|E

5|$|The P90 is a {{selective}} fire, straight blowback-operated weapon with a cyclic {{rate of fire}} of 900 RPM (rounds per minute). The weapon is chambered for FN's 5.7×28mm ammunition. Its unusual shape is based on extensive ergonomic research. The weapon is grasped {{by means of a}} thumbhole <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>frame</b> that acts as a pistol grip, as well as an oversized trigger guard that acts as a foregrip for the shooter's support hand. The P90 fires from a closed bolt for maximum accuracy, and its design makes extensive use of polymers for reduced weight and cost. Overall, the weapon is relatively lightweight, weighing 2.5kg (5.6lb) empty, or 3kg (6.6lb) with a loaded 50-round magazine.|$|E
5|$|Early {{shooting}} {{put more}} {{focus on the}} pool playing, but during filming Rossen {{made the decision to}} place more emphasis on the love story between Newman and Laurie's characters. Despite the change in emphasis, Rossen still used the various pool games to show the strengthening of Eddie's character and the evolution of his relationship to Bert and Sarah, through the positioning of the characters <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>frame.</b> For example, when Eddie is playing Findley, Eddie is positioned below Bert in a two shot but above Findley while still below Bert in a three shot. When Sarah enters the room, she is below Eddie in two shot while in a three shot Eddie is still below Bert. When Eddie is kneeling over Sarah's body, Bert again appears above him but Eddie attacks Bert, ending up on top of him. Eddie finally appears above Bert in two shot when Eddie returns to beat Fats.|$|E
5|$|For {{stationary}} shots where Superman is seen flying toward or {{away from}} the camera, blue screen matte techniques were used. Reeve would be photographed suspended against a blue screen. While a special device made his cape flap to give the illusion of movement, the actor himself would remain stationary (save for banking his body). Instead, the camera would use a mixture of long zoom-ins and zoom-outs and dolly in/dolly outs to cause him to become larger or smaller <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>frame.</b> The blue background would then be photochemically removed and Reeve's isolated image would be 'inserted' into a matted area of a background plate shot. The zoom-ins or zoom-outs would {{give the appearance of}} flying away or toward the contents of the background plate. The disparity in lighting and color between the matted image and the background plate, the occasional presence of black matte lines (where the matte area and the matted image—in this case, Superman—do not exactly match up), and the slightly unconvincing impression of movement achieved through the use of zoom lenses is characteristic of these shots.|$|E

Burright became the new second baseman, replacing Gilliam who moved to third base while the previous third baseman, Tommy Davis, moved to center field. Perranoski allowed singles to Orsino and Pagán after a ground out by Felipe Alou. The Giants pinch hit Harvey Kuenn for Matty Alou and Bob Nieman for Hiller, but both recorded outs to end {{the top of the}} seventh. Ernie Bowman replaced Nieman at second base for the Giants {{in the bottom of the}} inning and no runs scored <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>frame.</b> The Giants continued to hit Perranoski in the top of the eighth, with singles by Davenport and Mays to open the inning. Jack Smith entered in relief but allowed a single to Ed Bailey pinch hitting for Larsen which scored Davenport to cut the Dodgers' lead to 7–6. Mays attempted to advance to third on the play but was called out. The play drew arguments from Mays, Alvin Dark, and third base coach Whitey Lockman as third base umpire Jocko Conlan appeared to call Mays safe before changing it to out. Carl Boles pinch ran for Bailey, and Cepeda reached on an error on his fly ball which allowed Boles to move to third. Stan Williams relieved Smith and walked Felipe Alou to load the bases. Orsino hit a sacrifice fly to tie the game at seven runs apiece and Pagán grounded out to end the inning.|$|E

Charlie reveals the truth, that Ruby is actually her daughter and that she became pregnant when Grant Bledcoe raped her. Charlie's parents agreed to bring Ruby up as their own. Ruby tracks Grant down and accuses him of ruining everyone's lives. Grant tells Ruby she has convinced herself it was not consented, Charlie then kidnaps Grant to get the truth. Grant later turns up dead on the beach and Charlie and Ruby are <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>frame</b> for his murder, until Ross later admits he did it.|$|E
5|$|The {{major theme}} of Buffy's dream is {{her fear of}} the {{personal}} cost of {{her life as a}} Slayer, the isolation and loneliness she is forced to endure. This theme of aloneness is reiterated by several shots in which she is alone <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>frame,</b> most notably the wide shot of her in the vast and empty desert. Another source of anxiety is her relationship with her current boyfriend, Riley, whom she finds plotting world domination with Adam in his original, human, form. She fears what Riley could turn into {{as a result of his}} alliance with the military. She also fears the destabilizing effect of this alliance on their relationship, and the destabilizing effect of this relationship on her life as the slayer. She is shown putting mud on her face, mimicking the mud mask of the primal, First Slayer. By the end of her encounter in the desert with the First Slayer, Buffy realizes that she does not have to be entirely alone, that it is her closeness to friends and family that makes her a great Slayer, and once she experiences this revelation, the efforts of the First Slayer to continue to engage her in battle become fruitless and increasingly comical. The dream finally ends in a mundane way, as Buffy refuses to accept a tragic climax and instead insists on normality in her life.|$|E

5|$|Vagrant Story was {{conceived}} {{during a time}} when most games had made the transition into three-dimensional graphics. Games with real-time polygons were the mainstream, and it was decided for Vagrant Story to follow this trend. Murata, the main programmer, expressed his concerns in working towards a large-scale three-dimensional game for the first time. To avoid discrepancies <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>frame</b> rate caused by the large number of polygon models, the modeling team had to select an aspect of each character to focus their attention. Art director Minagawa mentioned that painstaking detail were given to each individual model, even to characters that only appear for a few seconds in the game. The same character models were used throughout the game to create a seamless transition between event cutscenes and actual gameplay. The sound effects of Vagrant Story are credited to Minoru Akao, the game's sound programmer; and Tomohiro Yajima, the sound editor and engineer.|$|E
