25|$|The {{county board}} called an {{emergency}} {{meeting to discuss}} {{the recommendations of the}} arbitration and especially the recommendation from Mulvey that Holland should resign. By 16 February, uncertainty had emerged over the status of the strike. While the county board and Holland met to discuss the issues, an expected vote by the county board to remove Holland was never called. Holland meanwhile issued a statement that didn't indicate if he had stepped down and stated that he was neutral saying: <b>I</b> <b>am</b> <b>my</b> own man and I am proud to be a Cork football man. Holland said the claim that six people had refused the job before him was false and there was no threat of strike when he took the job. However, a statement in support of the strike had been issued by the Gaelic Players Association on 13 November 2007, a week before Holland took the job.|$|E

In the passage, Romeo laments to Juliet" [...] a name, I know not how to tell who <b>I</b> <b>am.</b> <b>My</b> name, dear saint, is hateful to myself, because it is an enemy to thee.

2500|$|The {{intention}} of the organizers was to erect a memorial with the inscription [...] "Ich bin meine eigene Frau (<b>I</b> <b>am</b> <b>my</b> own wife) – Charlotte von Mahlsdorf – 18. März 1928 – 30. April 2002" [...] on {{the first anniversary of}} Charlotte's death. However, von Mahlsdorf's relatives demanded the inscription be changed. As questions remained about the disposition of her estate, and the [...] "Förderverein Gutshaus Mahlsdorf e. V." [...] was concerned that her relatives could demand the return of her furniture, they yielded to these demands.|$|E
2500|$|Charles and the {{children}} were officially Swiss nationals until they became naturalised on 22 October 1919. Dirac's father was strict and authoritarian, although he disapproved of corporal punishment. Dirac had a strained relationship with his father, so much so that after his father's death, Dirac wrote, [...] "I feel much freer now, and <b>I</b> <b>am</b> <b>my</b> own man." [...] Charles forced his children to speak to him only in French, in order that they learn the language. When Dirac found that he could not express what he wanted to say in French, he chose to remain silent.|$|E
2500|$|James Muldoon, {{a fundraiser}} for front runner Peter MacKay, {{described}} Chandler as [...] "the true black face of neoconservatism. He could {{live to be}} 100 and he'll never know the meaning of, <b>I</b> <b>am</b> <b>my</b> brother's keeper." [...] Chandler's statements were called [...] "bitter and resentful" [...] by MacKay, whom Chandler criticized for supporting of the passage of Bill C-250, which amended the Criminal Code by adding sexual orientation as a protected category under the Code offences prohibiting advocating genocide and publicly inciting hatred. Chandler suggested that the amendment {{would lead to the}} banning of the Bible and other religious texts in schools and public libraries.|$|E

2500|$|Gaahl is {{strongly}} opposed to Christianity. He {{has often been}} mistaken as a Satanist, but objects to being labeled as such. In a 1995 interview, he stated: [...] "I am my own God as <b>I</b> <b>am</b> <b>my</b> own Satan. So I'm not a Satanist judging by those terms". He jokingly added: [...] "Maybe {{you could call it}} Gaahlism". He reiterated this belief in the documentary True Norwegian Black Metal when he said: [...] "The god within yourself is the only true god". In an interview for the documentary —at which time he was Gorgoroth's vocalist—Gaahl was asked what inspired the band's music, to which his sole reply was [...] "Satan". When asked what Satan represented, he again answered with a single word: [...] "Freedom".|$|E
2500|$|One picture bride {{summarizes}} {{the feelings of}} many of the brides subsequent to meeting their husbands, she writes [...] "I came to Hawaii and was so surprised and very disappointed, because my husband sent his twenty-five-year-old handsome-looking picture...He came to the pier, but I see he's really old, old-looking. He was forty-five years more old than <b>I</b> <b>am.</b> <b>My</b> heart stuck." [...] On average, the grooms were ten to fifteen years older than their brides. The age of their husbands were not the only shock for the women, they were also taken aback by their living conditions. Many women expected to live in houses like ones in the photos the men sent them, but instead found plantation quarters that were crude, isolated, and racially segregated. One of the reasons that the grooms and go-betweens were not altogether truthful with the future brides was because they believed that the women would not come if they knew the reality of the man and his conditions.|$|E
2500|$|Harry Schwarz {{played a}} key role in the {{realignment}} of the opposition in South Africa. In the 1974 general election, Schwarz was elected into Parliament for Yeoville, along with other liberal members of Schwarz's Young Turks. In February 1975, Dick Enthoven MP was expelled from the United Party by Sir de Villiers Graaff for [...] "disloyalty". On 11 February 1975, when asked in Parliament by a National Party MP if he supported Enthoven's liberal positions, Schwarz replied [...] "I make no secret of it. <b>I</b> <b>am</b> <b>my</b> brother's keeper". For not following the party line, Schwarz was expelled from the party. This led to the resignation of four other MP's, Senator Brian Bramford, ten members of the Transvaal Provincial Council, which made it the official opposition party in the Transvaal Provincial Council, 14 out of the 36 Johannesburg City Councillors and four Randburg City Councillors. On the night of the expulsion, the Reform Party was launched, of which Schwarz as elected leader. The party's charter mainly incorporated the Mahlabatini Declaration's principles and called for universal franchise and for equality to be extended to all.|$|E

2500|$|Some abolitionists in the United States {{regarded}} the analogy as spurious. They believed that wage workers were [...] "neither wronged nor oppressed". Abraham Lincoln and the Republicans {{argued that the}} condition of wage workers was different from slavery, as laborers were {{likely to have the}} opportunity to work for themselves in the future, achieving self-employment. The abolitionist and former slave Frederick Douglass initially declared, [...] "now <b>I</b> <b>am</b> <b>my</b> own master", upon taking a paying job. But later in life, he concluded to the contrary, [...] "experience demonstrates that there may be a slavery of wages only a little less galling and crushing in its effects than chattel slavery, and that this slavery of wages must go down with the other". Douglass went on to speak about these conditions as arising from the unequal bargaining power between the ownership/capitalist class and the non-ownership/laborer class within a compulsory monetary market. [...] "No more crafty and effective devise for defrauding the southern laborers could be adopted than the one that substitutes orders upon shopkeepers for currency in payment of wages. It has the merit of a show of honesty, while it puts the laborer completely at the mercy of the land-owner and the shopkeeper.".|$|E
