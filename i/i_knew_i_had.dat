5|$|Israel entered one artistic gymnast {{into the}} Olympic competition. Two-time Olympian Alexander Shatilov {{qualified}} and claimed his Olympic {{spot in the}} men's apparatus and all-around events via the Olympic Test Event in Rio de Janeiro by participation. Shatilov participated in both the London and Beijing Olympics. He did not advance following the qualification round in the floor and horizontal bar events due to not achieving eighth place or higher in either. Shatilov's loss in the qualification rounds makes Rio his worst Olympic finish ever. In regards to the loss, he said “things didn’t go as I planned, but that happens in sport and there’s nothing I can do about it. You {{need to know how}} to cope with disappointments and life continues. I trained hard and wanted to have a good competition, but you can’t turn the clock back. I started my floor drill well, but a small mistake cost me and <b>I</b> <b>knew</b> <b>I</b> <b>had</b> no chance after that. I never imagined a scenario like this.” He performed poorly in both the floor and bar routines, scoring 13.5 points in the floor routine, and 14.066 points in the bar routine. The floor exercise was riddled with errors and ended with a landing where it appeared as if he was trying to break a fall.|$|E

The way I worked it out, {{it was to be}} me or Ken MacLeay and <b>I</b> <b>knew</b> <b>I</b> <b>had</b> a few years {{experience}} on him, having played Tests and more Sheffield Shield. This is the biggest thrill apart from my 1981 Test selection in England and helping bring back the Sheffield Shield to NSW last year.|$|E

500|$|In his {{theatrical}} debut, Gyllenhaal starred on the London {{stage in}} Kenneth Lonergan's revival of This Is Our Youth at the Garrick Theatre in 2002. Gyllenhaal said, [...] "Every actor I {{look up to}} has done theatre work, so <b>I</b> <b>knew</b> <b>I</b> <b>had</b> {{to give it a}} try." [...] The play, which had been a critical sensation on Broadway, ran for eight weeks in London's West End. Gyllenhaal received favorable critical reviews and an Evening Standard Theatre Award in the category [...] "Outstanding Newcomer".|$|E
500|$|Galvis {{was born}} November 14, 1989, in Punto Fijo, Falcón, Venezuela, and at age 14, the Philadelphia Phillies began to scout {{him during his}} days playing youth baseball. He participated on Latin America's team in the Little League World Series, but due to his slight stature ( [...] ), {{struggled}} to captivate scouts' attention. Galvis said, [...] "They told me that I couldn't play (pro) baseball. But <b>I</b> <b>knew</b> <b>I</b> <b>had</b> the ability." [...] In 2006, scouts Sal Agostinelli and Jesus Mendez signed him during the amateur player signing period. Galvis, 16 years old, was not a particularly heralded prospect, but did receive some attention from scouting experts before signing with the Phillies.|$|E
500|$|Shira is {{frequently}} shown playing the accordion, which Hadas Yaron {{did not know}} how to play. She described it as a [...] "very difficult instrument" [...] and stated, [...] "There was so much noise in [...] It was like rrrrrrnnnnngh , I was faking the melody and it was ugly, very weird stuff. I had to really switch this button [...] like don't listen to it and feel what you’'re feeling. It took a while because at the beginning, I was very aware of playing this horrible melody, if you could call it a melody, and <b>I</b> <b>knew</b> <b>I</b> <b>had</b> to feel something. It took a few takes because I thought, 'oh, how could [...] listen to that? The cinematographer!' It took a while to ignore that and just be in the moment." ...|$|E

It's nine minutes long. <b>I</b> <b>knew</b> <b>I</b> <b>had</b> to start minimal and give it space. Let notes ring, then give it space, and build up the {{anticipation}} from there, without tipping in either direction." [...] Djawadi stated that he refrained from using the typical Lannister theme, [...] "The Rains of Castamere", {{in order to create}} more of a mystery. The piece also featured vocals by two young boys singing in unison, with Djawadi describing how he pieced all of the separate pieces of the music together by saying [...] "The boys I recorded completely separate. The strings I recorded all together. Even the solo instruments, I recorded them separately — the solo violins and solo cellists were recorded separately. The piano, I played. And the organ as well." ...|$|E
500|$|Milk {{became more}} {{interested}} in political and civic matters when he was faced with civic problems and policies he disliked. One day in 1973, a state bureaucrat entered Milk's shop Castro Camera and informed him that he owed $100 as a deposit against state sales tax. Milk was incredulous and traded shouts with the man about the rights of business owners; after he complained for weeks at state offices, the deposit was reduced to $30. Milk fumed about government priorities when a teacher came into his store to borrow a projector because the equipment in the schools did not function. Friends also remember {{around the same time}} having to restrain him from kicking the television while Attorney General John N. Mitchell gave consistent [...] "I don't recall" [...] replies during the Watergate hearings. Milk decided that {{the time had come to}} run for city supervisor. He said later, [...] "I finally reached the point where <b>I</b> <b>knew</b> <b>I</b> <b>had</b> to become involved or shut up".|$|E
500|$|After the Seven Network dropped Neighbours in 1985, rival channel Network Ten {{picked the}} series up. It {{initially}} attracted low ratings and Ten began {{working hard to}} publicise the series. They revamped the show and added several new cast members. Kylie Minogue had had a fairly successful career as a child actress, having appeared in various television dramas, including Skyways and The Henderson Kids, but she was considering giving up acting after failing to find further work. After finishing her school exams in 1985, Minogue then auditioned {{for the role of}} Charlene. She attended the audition dressed as the character and won the role. Of hiring Minogue, Neighbours casting director Jan Russ commented [...] "Kylie had done a couple of things before I saw her, but she was only 18 and as shy as a mouse. She really hadn't evolved into anything at that stage, but the camera loved her and <b>I</b> <b>knew</b> <b>I</b> <b>had</b> my Charlene." [...] Minogue initially signed up to play Charlene for one week, this was then extended to 13 weeks and then through to mid-1988. She made her debut screen appearance in the episode broadcast on 17 April 1986.|$|E

500|$|Berry {{was famous}} for his {{attention}} to detail and preparation, which he used to overcome his physical limitations. Considered slow for a wide receiver, he ran the 40-yard dash in 4.8 seconds. Rather than speed, he was renowned for his precise pass patterns and sure hands; he rarely dropped passes, and he fumbled only once in his career. He would squeeze Silly Putty constantly to strengthen his hands. He and Unitas regularly worked after practice and developed the timing and knowledge of each other's abilities that made each more effective. The reason for this, according to Berry, was that the two did not think on the same wavelength. [...] "Every season we had {{to start all over}} on our timing, especially the long ball," [...] said Berry. [...] "He knew he had to release the ball when I was eighteen yards from scrimmage for me to receive it thirty-eight yards out. <b>I</b> <b>knew</b> <b>I</b> <b>had</b> to make my break in those first eighteen yards and get free within 2.8 seconds." [...] He also relied on shifty moves, and by his count, he had 88 different moves to get open, all of which he practiced every week.|$|E
500|$|Many Simpsons {{staff members}} were fans of English comedian Ricky Gervais and his British comedy series The Office that he created and starred. In January 2004, The Simpsons creator Matt Groening called Gervais to congratulate {{him on his}} double Golden Globe win. During the phone call, Gervais was invited to lunch with Groening and {{executive}} producer Al Jean since they were big fans and wanted to meet him. At this lunch, he was offered a chance to appear in and write an episode of The Simpsons. Groening first asked Gervais for just a guest appearance, but {{came to the conclusion}} that he might be interested in writing an episode too. Gervais told The Independent that when he got the offer, [...] "well, <b>I</b> <b>knew</b> <b>I</b> <b>had</b> to say yes, but fear kicked in at exactly the same time." [...] He became the first person to be credited with simultaneously writing and guest-starring in an episode of The Simpsons. He was also the first Briton to write an episode for the show. As a big follower of The Simpsons, Gervais saw the experience as [...] "a dream come true." ...|$|E

'And what would she do, remaining here?' continued Paul. Roger admitted {{that it would be}} awkward. 'I am determined that under no circumstances will <b>I</b> marry her. <b>I</b> <b>know</b> <b>I</b> <b>have</b> been a fool. <b>I</b> <b>know</b> <b>I</b> <b>have</b> been wrong.

2500|$|A {{month after}} the Gomez fight, it was {{announced}} that Jorge Rubio would become Khan's new trainer. Rubio was chosen because Khan thought that he had very good chemistry with the Cuban trainer. Khan said, [...] "Rubio was showing me all these new training techniques, and I felt so comfortable because it suited my style. <b>I</b> <b>knew</b> <b>I</b> <b>had</b> the hand speed and the footwork to do it and I {{knew it was going to}} make me a much better fighter".|$|E
2500|$|While at Yale, {{he became}} a member of Skull and Bones. He served {{apprenticeships}} at Time, Life, the United States Information Agency, and American Heritage, where he enjoyed research.

He graduated with honors in English literature (1955).|$|E

2500|$|The film {{score to}} All Is Lost is {{composed}} by Edward Sharpe and the Magnetic Zeros’ frontman Alex Ebert, who {{signed on to}} the film in November 2012. Speaking of the experience of working on the film, Ebert said, [...] "This project was a dream—an open space to play in but also space to listen to the elements—wind, water, rain, sun, are the story's other characters to me. <b>I</b> <b>knew</b> <b>I</b> <b>had</b> quite a task ahead of me: to at once allow the elements to sing and to give Redford a voice with which to, once in a while, respond."
