50|$|Aaron Soames was an elderly, former {{employee}} of Cord Conglomerate deprived of his pension benefits {{by a computer}} error. Soames stole the prototype suit of Mauler armor {{in the hopes of}} punishing Edwin Cord, who was indifferent to Soames' plight. Soames had two skirmishes with the hero Daredevil, and after humiliating Cord by symbolically erasing his existence as well by destroying <b>his</b> <b>driver's</b> license, credit <b>cards</b> and other means of personal identification (he did not intend to do him any actual harm), he was killed with advanced weaponry by Cord's men. Daredevil {{was one of the few}} mourners at Soames' funeral.|$|R

5000|$|A {{tachograph}} system comprises a {{sender unit}} mounted {{to the vehicle}} gearbox, the tachograph head and a recording medium. Tachograph heads are of either analogue or digital types. All relevant vehicles manufactured in the EU since 1 May 2006 must be fitted with digital tachograph heads. The recording medium for analogue heads are wax coated paper discs, and for digital heads there are two recording mediums: internal memory (which can be read out with one {{of a variety of}} download devices into a so-called [...]ddd file) and digital <b>driver</b> <b>cards</b> containing a microchip with flash memory. Digital <b>driver</b> <b>cards</b> store data in a format that can later also be read out as a [...]ddd file. These files - both those read from internal memory with a download device, and those read from the <b>driver</b> <b>cards</b> - can be imported into tachograph analysis/archival software.|$|R

50|$|A digital {{tachograph}} system {{consists of a}} digital <b>driver</b> <b>card,</b> the tachograph head, and a sender unit mounted to the vehicle gearbox. The sender unit produces electronic pulses as the gearbox output shaft turns. These pulses are interpreted as speed data by the head.|$|R
50|$|Drivers {{and their}} {{employers}} are legally required to accurately record their activities, retain the records (files from internal memory and from <b>driver</b> <b>cards</b> must both be retained) and produce them on demand to transport authorities {{who are in}} charge of enforcing regulations governing drivers' working hours.|$|R

5000|$|Oregon Ballot Measure 88 was {{a ballot}} measure in the U.S. state of Oregon in the 2014 midterm {{elections}} {{to determine whether}} or not to refer a [...] "law creating a four-year <b>driver's</b> <b>card,</b> shorter than the usual eight years for a driver's license, for those who meet all other qualifications other than proof of legal presence in the United States". The measure was rejected.|$|R
5000|$|Sherry [...] "Braces" [...] Strictler (voiced by Tabitha St. Germain) is Pac-Man's classmate and the {{daughter}} of Mr. Strictler. She is a pink Pac-Girl like Cylindria, but with a different hairstyle. She was nameless in the first 14 episodes of the show. Her nickname was first revealed in [...] "Driver's Pac" [...] on a <b>driver's</b> <b>card</b> as Braces. But in [...] "Peace without Slime", her real name is revealed to be Sherry.|$|R

50|$|The {{background}} for the referendum was a law SB 833 which would have allowed undocumented immigrants to get a <b>driver's</b> <b>card</b> which {{was passed by the}} Oregon Legislative Assembly and signed by Governor John Kitzhaber in 2013. An ad-hoc group, Protect Oregon Driver Licenses, subsequently collected more than the 58,142 signatures which was required to demand a citizens veto referendum and the law was put on the ballot as Measure 88 in the 2014 general election.|$|R
50|$|On 17 June 1953, {{during the}} East German uprising, Nuschke and <b>his</b> <b>driver</b> were kidnapped {{and brought to}} West Berlin. Some American {{military}} recognised him and saved him from the angry masses. He and <b>his</b> <b>driver</b> were brought to a police station, but released on 19 June. After that Nuschke and <b>his</b> <b>driver</b> returned to East Berlin. In a spontaneous interview given to RIAS reporter Peter Schultze, Nuschke claimed that the East German government had popular support and that the demonstrators included West Berliners.|$|R

The first accident was a head-on collision between Maan's vehicle and a truck on 9 January 2001 at a village near Rupnagar, Punjab. In this accident Maan's driver Tejpal died. Maan later admitted that <b>his</b> <b>driver</b> asked him to wear his seat belt minutes before the accident. Maan believes that {{if it had not}} been for <b>his</b> <b>driver's</b> advice, he would have been dead as well.

It is planned to use existing Fortran data collection software to drive the existing CAMAC electronics via a VME CAMAC branch <b>driver</b> <b>card</b> and associated Daresbury Unix driving software. The first usable Unix driver has been written and produces single-action CAMAC cycles from test software. The data acquisition code has been implemented in test mode under Unix with few problems and effort is now being directed toward finalizing calls to the CAMAC-driving software and ultimate evaluation of the complete system. 2 page(s...|$|R
40|$|The Level- 1 Data <b>Driver</b> <b>Card</b> (L 1 DDC) will be {{fabricated}} for {{the needs}} of the future upgrades of the ATLAS experiment at CERN. The L 1 DDC board is a high speed aggre gator board capable of communicating with a large number of front-end electronics. It collects the Level- 1 along with monitoring data and transmits them to a network interface through a single bidirectional fibre link. Finally, the L 1 DDC board distributes trigger, time and configuration data coming from a network interface to the front-end boards...|$|R
50|$|The Univac 1830, Navy {{designated}} CP-823/U, was {{a digital}} electronic computing machine which received problems and data and processed answers in numerical form. It used parallel binary arithmetic and logic operations; word length was 30 bits. All of the Central Processor (C.P.) logic and I/O logic control was microelectronic circuitry, constructed of integrated, monolithic semiconductor elements (resistors, {{diodes and transistors}} contained within a single chip of silicon). Logic cards that were not microelectronic are the Master Clock cards in the C.P and the Input amplifier and output data <b>driver</b> <b>cards</b> in the I/O units.|$|R
5000|$|... 7502 used a {{much closer}} {{integration}} between the processor and the display driver circuits. In 7503, the screen updates involved the processor specifying a screen {{address to the}} display <b>driver</b> <b>cards,</b> and then firing a sequence of characters to be stored in consecutive locations starting at the specified address. The display driver hardware included hardware registers to track where the next character was to be placed. In 7502, the display memory {{was part of the}} processors normal memory space. This meant that the processor could read or write any screen location directly.|$|R
