Abstract This paper investigated the stress levels of first-year <b>education</b> <b>students</b> who undertake teaching practicum and theory units during {{their first year of}} teacher education program. First, 139 first-year and 143 other years’ <b>education</b> <b>students</b> completed the PSS- 10 scale, which measures perceived level of stress. Then, 147 first-year <b>education</b> <b>students</b> completed an online questionnaire to identify the particular stressors in their learning experience. The first-year <b>education</b> <b>students</b> had significantly higher stress levels than other years’ <b>education</b> <b>students,</b> (p <. 01). Contributing stressors included academic work commitment; completing placement and related performance assessments in schools and at university; having a good understanding of the requirements of professional teaching, such as classroom management, and working with mentor teachers; and conflicting work and family commitments. These findings provide greater understanding about the stressors experienced by first-year <b>education</b> <b>students</b> and usefully inform ways to help this group achieve their study and career goals...|$|R

40|$|Thesis (MEd (Educational Psychology)) [...] North-West University, Potchefstroom Campus, 2013 A {{stable and}} healthy {{personality}} {{is a requirement}} {{to deal effectively with}} the different stressors and demands that are part and parcel of a profession in education. Therefore, it is of the utmost importance to ensure that prospective teachers present well balanced personality profiles, which will enable them to become good teachers. Against the abovementioned background, this research study had the aim to: • by means of a literature study, determine the criteria that are generally used in the selection process of prospective <b>education</b> <b>students</b> nationally and internationally, and to determine the role and function of a personality assessment in the selection of prospective education students; • by means of a literature study, determine the characteristics of the desired personality profile of a teacher by applying the Five Factor Model of personality; • empirically determine the characteristics of the personality profiles of full-time registered <b>education</b> <b>students</b> at a higher education institution; • empirically determine whether there are differences between the personality profiles of 1) male and female education students; 2) <b>education</b> <b>students</b> in the different education phases; 3) <b>education</b> <b>students</b> with different home languages; 4) <b>education</b> <b>students</b> at different academic levels; and 5) <b>education</b> <b>students</b> who indicated <b>education</b> as first choice of study, and those who did not; and • to determine what the application possibility of the NEO-FFI is in the selection of prospective <b>education</b> <b>students.</b> The literature study produced the following results: • Academic criteria are mostly used in selecting <b>education</b> <b>students,</b> nationally and internationally and personality assessment does not {{play a role in the}} selection of <b>education</b> <b>students</b> in South Africa. • The desired personality profile of teachers, according to the Five Factor Model of personality, renders low scores on Neuroticism and high scores on Extraversion, Openness to Experience, Agreeableness and Conscientiousness. The empirical study produced the following results: • The group of <b>education</b> <b>students</b> generally presented the characteristics of the theoretical preferred personality profile with regard to Neuroticism, Extraversion, Agreeableness and Conscientiousness, but they presented relatively low mean raw scores for Openness to Experience. • No meaningful differences were found between the personality profiles of <b>education</b> <b>students</b> with regard to the education phase, home language, academic year and education as study choice, however, there were meaningful differences between male and female <b>education</b> <b>students</b> pertaining Agreeableness, where female <b>education</b> <b>students</b> presented higher mean raw scores than their male counterparts. Stanines were calculated to develop norms which can be used for personality assessment in the selection of prospective <b>education</b> <b>students.</b> Gender-specific norms were developed for this purpose. On grounds of the results of the investigation, it is recommended that personality assessment form an integral part of the selection process of prospective <b>education</b> <b>students</b> and that the NEO-FFI appears to be fruitful in this regard.

40|$|Introduction The {{purpose of}} this study was to {{determine}} whether the attitudes of Elementary <b>Education</b> <b>students</b> and Secondary <b>Education</b> <b>students</b> toward children and teaching differ significantly prior to and after student teaching and whether these attitudes show a significant change as a result of the student-teaching experience. The study was also concerned with correlation between attitude change and the subject which the student teaches and correlation between attitude and the student 2 ̆ 7 s performance grade in student teaching. Method Subjects for the study were 33 Elementary <b>Education</b> <b>students</b> and 67 Secondary <b>Education</b> <b>students</b> at Utah State University who did their student teaching during the winter quarter, 1975. Secondary <b>Education</b> <b>students</b> were distributed in six areas as follows: Arts/Humanities, 11; Business Education/Distributive Education, 12; Math/Science, 5; Vocational Education, 23; Social Studies, 7; and Physical Education/Health, 9. Students participating in the study were tested on the Minnesota Teacher Attitude Inventory (MTAI) before and after student teaching. They were rated by university supervisors on Part I of the Instrument for the Observation of Teaching Activities (IOTA) during the final weeks of student teaching. Analysis of variance and analysis of covariance were used to compare group means on the pre- and post-tests of the MTAI. Analysis of variance was also used to compare mean group scores on the IOTA. Pearson 2 ̆ 7 s L product-moment correlation was used to determine significant relationships between student teachers 2 ̆ 7 attitude scores on the MTAI and performance scores on the IOTA. Findings 1. Prior to <b>student</b> teaching, Elementary <b>Education</b> <b>student</b> teachers had a significantly less realistic attitude toward children and teaching than Secondary <b>Education</b> <b>student</b> teachers had. Significance was at the. 01 level. 2. After student teaching, there was no significant difference between t he mean attitudes of Elementary Education and Secondary <b>Education</b> <b>students</b> toward children and teaching. 3. Elementary <b>Education</b> <b>students</b> and Secondary <b>Education</b> <b>students</b> had more realistic attitudes toward children and teaching (significant at the. 01 level) after student teaching. 4. There was no significant difference in the mean attitudes toward children and teaching, before and after student teaching, of Secondary <b>Education</b> <b>students</b> who taught in five of the six Secondary <b>Education</b> teaching areas. <b>Students</b> who taught in the area of Vocational Education had a significantly more realistic mean attitude toward children and teaching after the student teaching experience. Significance was at the. 01 level. 5. There was no significant difference in mean performance scores on the Instrument for the Observation of Teaching Activities (IOTA) for Elementary <b>Education</b> <b>student</b> teachers and Secondary <b>Education</b> <b>student</b> teachers. 6. There was no significant correlation between mean attitude scores and mean performance scores on the IOTA for Elementary <b>Education</b> <b>student</b> teachers and Secondary <b>Education</b> <b>student</b> teachers. 7. There was no significant correlation between mean attitude scores and mean performance scores on the IOTA for students in five of the six Secondary <b>Education</b> teaching areas. <b>Students</b> teaching in the area of Physical Education/Health had a significant correlation between their mean attitudes prior to and after student teaching, and their mean performance score on the IOTA.

40|$|This {{introductory}} workshop {{will focus}} on using critical questioning techniques to encourage <b>education</b> <b>students</b> to think through different lenses when approaching education methods and pedagogy. Undergraduate <b>education</b> <b>students,</b> particularly music <b>education</b> <b>students,</b> often enter university {{with a desire to}} replicate an educational experience, program, or teacher they had as an elementary or secondary school student. The use of critical questioning will help students think outside this narrow box of experience and create space to consider in what ways we may be complicit in perpetuating norms that may not be inclusive of all students. Research indicates that the use of critical questioning promotes student reflexivity and engages students in higher level thinking (Abramo, 2015; Pagliaro, 2011; Yang, Newby, 2 ̆ 6 Bill, 2005). In addition, this practice is important as <b>education</b> <b>students</b> and pre-service teachers with experience in critical questioning will have the tools necessary to promote critical thought and questioning in their own classrooms as educators.
