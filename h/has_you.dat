25|$|It {{is not my}} main {{ground of}} {{complaint}} that you have her, even though I loved her dearly; that she <b>has</b> <b>you</b> is my chief regret, a loss that touches me more closely. Loving offenders, I excuse you both thus: you love her, because you know I love her; similarly, she abuses me for my sake, in allowing my friend to have her. If I lose you, my loss is a gain to my love; and losing her, my friend picks up that loss. Both find each other, I lose both, and both lay this cross on me for my sake. But there is one consolation in this thought: my friend and I are one; therefore she loves me alone.|$|E

[...] Hillhouse rated the main event eight out of ten and the overall event six out of ten. When the Canadian Online Explorer polled its readers on the event, 26% did not watch the event, 5% thought it was disappointing, 6% thought it was okay and 63% thought it was great.|$|E

Viswanathan wrote, [...] "Kadhalikka Neramillai saw Nagesh walking into the hearts of Tamil filmgoers".|$|E
500|$|According to Houston, {{the song}} was direct, so she wanted the video to be direct and {{concentrate}} {{on her face and}} on the lyrics. Whitaker also expressed a same opinion of the song. He said, [...] "I've seen the video [...] It's like a thing she <b>has,</b> <b>you</b> know, that I guess people would say is like a charisma kinda thing that it zooms, you know, comes up. It's beautiful [...] It's magic, it's spirit." [...] The video aired on MTV on October 10, 1995. According to Marla Shelton, a writer for Camera Obscura, a journal of feminism and film theory, [...] "the video concept's originality stops with Houston's hair style as its stark simplicity underscores the 'straight and narrow' politics of the film." [...] When the film was released, the video was shown as a trailer prior to the beginning of films on 450 General Cinema screens in some major US media markets.|$|E

500|$|Becky Bain of Idolator {{commented on}} the simple {{structure}} and themes of the video, writing [...] "There’s not much to this simple vid, but it does feature Carey doing her usual hand waving theatrics while hitting some absolutely killer high notes." [...] Bain also observed {{that the vast majority}} of the shots of Carey are either long shots, showing the singer from a distance, or close up shots, showing Carey from the shoulders and above, so that the viewer was not able to easily recognise that she was pregnant. Nicole James of MTV Buzzworthy also praised the content of the video, writing [...] "Of course it wouldn't be a Mariah Carey video without some glitz and glam so the stage and backdrop are covered in (what else?) glitter. Mariah puts on a great show and sings her heart out with that famous eight-octave range... scrooges need not apply, 'Oh Santa!' is fun and festive and <b>has</b> <b>you</b> longing for a sip of eggnog." ...|$|E
500|$|The {{corresponding}} {{music video}} {{was directed by}} Ethan Lander, shot in September 2010 in the downtown of Los Angeles and released on September 8, 2010. Cameron Duddy was able to shot the behind-the-scenes {{in exchange for his}} jean jacket, which Mars used during the music video. The video features Peruvian-Australian actress Nathalie Kelley. Lander considers Bruno Mars a star. He adds [...] "The charisma that he <b>has,</b> <b>you</b> can’t teach.” Finishing with [...] "singer even manages to be suave in his mugshot, which is no small feat!" [...] He sees the video as a collaboration, the video director came up with the vision and Mars added his vision and so on. The video is a mixture of live action and stopped animation and through the animation Bruno shows his girlfriend how beautiful she is. He takes a cassette tape and starts creating images out of the tape and they start to get a life of their own.|$|E

[...] The Cincinnati Enquirer gave the game four stars out of five and said that [...] "What it lacks in originality it more than makes up for with its fun and easy-to-pick-up game play that will appeal to fans of the long-running comedy." [...] Entertainment Weekly gave it a B and said, [...] "If some of the missions seem repetitive, others stand out, like the one that <b>has</b> <b>you</b> confiscating copies of a particularly violent videogame (wink, wink) corrupting Springfield's youth." [...] In Japan, Famitsu gave the Xbox version a score of two eights, one seven, and one eight, for a total of 31 out of 40.|$|E

500|$|In The Observer, Tim Adams complimented {{the opening}} {{sections}} as [...] "nicely layered with the pretensions {{of a particular}} precocious kind of student" [...] but criticised the [...] "predictability" [...] of Mountstuart's [...] "walk-on part in literary history" [...] and ultimately the suspension of disbelief, particularly the Baader-Meinhoff passages, concluding [...] "For all the incident, for all the change he witnesses, Mountstuart never really feels like a credible witness either to history or emotion." [...] Tom Cox in The Daily Telegraph disagreed: he praised the characterisation, calling Mountstuart [...] "a man whose fragile egotism and loose-fitting story <b>has</b> <b>you</b> frequently forgetting you're reading fiction, and even more frequently forgetting you're reading at all." [...] Giles Foden, in The Guardian, found the New York art-scene sections weakest, saying they [...] "puncture the realism Boyd has so carefully built up {{in the rest of}} the novel." [...] Michiko Kakutani agreed that Mountstuart's youth was well evoked, but that the description of his retirement and poverty was [...] "as carefully observed and emotionally resonant". While in the early part of the book [...] "the characters' marionette strings [...] carefully hidden", later Boyd tried to play God, resulting in [...] "an increasingly contrived narrative that begins to strain our credulity." ...|$|E
500|$|The {{accompanying}} {{music video}} for [...] "White Horse" [...] {{was directed by}} Trey Fanjoy, who directed the majority of Swift's prior videos. Swift commented that Fanjoy was her first choice to film the video because she understood the direction Swift wanted to take {{and how to make}} the video different than the prior ones they filmed. The video's plot centered on infidelity. However, because the theme had appeared on the video for [...] "Picture to Burn", the scenario was reversed, rather than removed entirely, for Swift thought it was inevitable to include it. It was conceptualized so that Swift was not the person who someone was unfaithful to, but rather the one who someone was unfaithful with: [...] "This girl falls in love with this guy and he's perfect. He's adorable. He's charming. He's endearing. She falls in love with him. Then, she comes to realize that he's been leading a double life. He was already in a relationship years before he ever met her [...] You find out that I'm the one that was ruining a relationship without even knowing it." [...] Swift chose actor Stephen Colletti to portray the role of her love interest. She had previously seen him on the reality television series , where she acknowledged him to be [...] "cute", and later on One Tree Hill, where she was impressed by his acting skills; thus, Colletti was contacted to portray the character. Swift chose Colletti primarily because of his sweet and endearing demeanor. As a result, the character would seem very loyal, as though he would never betray his partner. Therefore, others did not expect for him to betray Swift either. [...] "That's always the hardest thing, when someone <b>has</b> <b>you</b> fooled so much that you think they're never gonna hurt you. And then they do. That's when you get the worst heartbreak", Swift said.|$|E
500|$|Weezer {{received}} generally favorable reviews. At Metacritic, which assigns {{a rating}} out of 100 to reviews from mainstream critics, the album received an average score of 73 out of 100. AllMusic senior writer Stephen Thomas Erlewine, {{who gave the}} album a [...] rating of {{four and a half}} stars, stated that [...] "this may seem like nothing special -- it's just punk-pop, delivered without much dynamic range but with a whole lot of hooks -- but nobody else does it this [...] so well, no matter how many bands try." [...] PopMatters' writer Jason Thompson also gave the album a positive review, praising the decision of the band to have Ric Ocasek produce them again: [...] "The guitar solos ring out as joyful as the words. And even the songs' lengths are nice and compact. Weezer comes in, plays the song, and exits. No overkill makes for many moments where you want to hear these songs again and again. Perhaps having producer Ric Ocasek back on board {{was one of the best}} ideas the band had, as the Green Album is certainly water tight all around." [...] Drowned in Sound gave the album a very positive review, saying [...] "After creating the two greatest pop-rock records in existence it's time to add a third. One listen to the Green Album <b>has</b> <b>you</b> eating out of Rivers Cuomo's hand just like in the past. [...] Rivers Cuomo is one of the greatest song-writers that has picked up a guitar. Anyone who can with hold the charms of the Geek-rock quartet are obviously made of stone and complete assholes. Sorry to be blunt but it's the way it is. God I think the sun's finally taking its toll." [...] The album would later rank at number 3 in their list of the best albums of 2001, tying with System of a Down's Toxicity and Mogwai's Rock Action. Q listed Weezer as one of the best 50 albums of 2001.|$|E

[...] However, the newspaper's television critic, Ally Ross, said that EastEnders had reached a [...] "dead end" [...] recently and their solution was to bring in Dyer: [...] "one of those slap-the-forehead appointments that instantly <b>has</b> <b>you</b> wondering, 'which one of them is slumming it?'

[...] USA Today gave the film three out of four stars. However, Richard Corliss in Time said that Raimi was not [...] "effective with actors" [...] and Peoples Ralph Novak called Darkman, a [...] "loud, sadistic, stupidly written, wretchedly acted film." [...] Entertainment Weekly gave the film a [...] "B" [...] rating and Owen Gleiberman wrote, [...] "The movie is full of jaunty, Grand Guignol touches (the main gangster enjoys snapping and collecting fingers), but Raimi's images also have a spectral, kinetic beauty." [...] In his review for the Washington Post, Joe Brown wrote, [...] "Though Raimi seems to be trying to restrain himself, his giddily sick sense of humor still pops out all over the place – Darkman is a frenetic funhouse ride that <b>has</b> <b>you</b> laughing and screaming at the same time." ...|$|E
