5|$|In 1928, {{building}} on Wolfgang Pauli's work, Paul Dirac produced {{a model of}} the electron– the Dirac equation, consistent with relativity theory, by applying relativistic and symmetry considerations to the hamiltonian formulation of the quantum mechanics of the <b>electro-magnetic</b> field. In order to resolve some problems within his relativistic equation, Dirac developed in 1930 {{a model of the}} vacuum as an infinite sea of particles with negative energy, later dubbed the Dirac sea. This led him to predict the existence of a positron, the antimatter counterpart of the electron. This particle was discovered in 1932 by Carl Anderson, who proposed calling standard electrons negatrons, and using electron as a generic term to describe both the positively and negatively charged variants.|$|E
25|$|On 26 November 1840, he {{exhibited}} his <b>electro-magnetic</b> {{clock in}} the library of the Royal Society, and propounded a plan for distributing the correct time from a standard clock to a number of local timepieces. The circuits of these were to be electrified by a key or contact-maker actuated by the arbour of the standard, and their hands corrected by electro-magnetism. The following January Alexander Bain took out a patent for an <b>electro-magnetic</b> clock, and he subsequently charged Wheatstone with appropriating his ideas. It appears that Bain worked as a mechanist to Wheatstone from August to December 1840, and he asserted that he had communicated the idea of an electric clock to Wheatstone during that period; but Wheatstone maintained that he had experimented in that direction during May. Bain further accused Wheatstone of stealing his idea of the <b>electro-magnetic</b> printing telegraph; but Wheatstone showed that the instrument was only a modification of his own <b>electro-magnetic</b> telegraph.|$|E

25|$|Solar Wind Loop: Also {{called a}} Dyson–Harrop {{satellite}} satellite. Here the satellite makes use {{not of the}} photons from the Sun but rather the charged particles in the solar wind which via <b>electro-magnetic</b> coupling generate a current in a large loop.|$|E
25|$|Converteam UK {{were working}} on an <b>electro-magnetic</b> {{catapult}} (EMCAT) system for the Queen Elizabeth-class aircraft carrier. In August 2009, speculation mounted that the UK may drop the STOVL F-35B for the CTOL F-35C model, which would have meant the carriers being built to operate conventional takeoff and landing aircraft using the UK-designed non-steam EMCAT catapults.|$|E

Items in the nearby environment that generate <b>electro-magnetic</b> fields, such as high tension wires and microwave towers, are avoided. The slope, if any, should be towards the east, {{and there should be}} no obstructions that block the sun's first rays.|$|E
25|$|The {{first test}} firing of the Brazo missile was {{conducted}} in April 1974, with the missile, launched from a USAF F-4D Phantom II, successfully shooting down a BQM-34 Firebee drone; four follow-up tests over the following year continued the missile's successful record, {{with none of the}} test shots failing despite difficult test conditions. However, despite the Brazo's success, the follow-on ERASE (<b>Electro-magnetic</b> RAdiation Source Elimination) project was cancelled, and no air-to-air antiradiation missiles would enter service in the West.|$|E
25|$|Modern {{sieve shakers}} {{work with an}} <b>electro-magnetic</b> drive which moves a spring-mass system and {{transfers}} the resulting oscillation to the sieve stack. Amplitude and sieving time are set digitally and are continuously observed by an integrated control-unit. Therefore, sieving results are reproducible and precise (an important precondition for a significant analysis). Adjustment of parameters like amplitude and sieving time serves to optimize the sieving for different types of material. This method {{is the most common}} in the laboratory sector.|$|E
25|$|An {{inertial}} frame is {{a frame of}} reference within which an object interacting with no forces (an idealized situation) appears either at rest or moving uniformly in a straight line. This is the fundamental definition of an {{inertial frame}}. These are characterized by the requirement that all forces entering the observer's physical laws originate from identifiable sources caused by fields, such as electro-static field (caused by static electrical charges), <b>electro-magnetic</b> field (caused by moving charges), gravitational field (caused by mass), and so forth.|$|E
25|$|In 1996, Vinnie Paz {{released}} the Amber Probe EP. This was the debut EP from the duo {{and it was}} released in 1996. It featured guest appearance from The Lost Children of Babylon. It was in 1997, Jedi Mind Tricks {{released the}}ir debut album; The Psycho-Social, Chemical, Biological & <b>Electro-Magnetic</b> Manipulation of Human Consciousness (often abbreviated as The Psycho-Social CD). The group only consisted of Vinnie Paz, and Stoupe the Enemy of Mankind at this time and featured Apathy, Jus Allah, and Black Thought.|$|E
25|$|The P-1 is {{equipped}} with many newly developed technology and features, particularly {{in terms of its}} avionics and missions systems. One such key feature is the use of a fly-by-light flight control system. This has the effect of decreasing <b>electro-magnetic</b> disturbances to the sensors in comparison to more common fly-by-wire control systems. The P-1 is the first production aircraft in the world to be equipped with such a flight control system. Various onboard systems are provided by Honeywell, who is the largest non-Japanese supplier to the project, such as the auxiliary power unit, environmental and pressurization control systems, ram air turbine, sonobuoy dispensers and elements of the avionics.|$|E
25|$|A ninth {{platform}} {{was added}} to Central station in 1889, but a major expansion {{took place in the}} years 1901–1906, when the platforms were lengthened and four platforms added on the west side; a second river crossing was provided. In 1904 Bridge Street station was substantially changed to provide carriage washing and stabling facilities; it closed as a passenger station on 1 March 1905. Central station was operated by a single signal box, staffed with ten men. It was commissioned on 3 May 1908; it had 374 miniature levers, the largest of its type in the world, operating points and signals by electro-pneumatic and <b>electro-magnetic</b> equipment.|$|E
25|$|A {{technique}} to eliminate mechanical scanning of the grating and still retain the maximum spatial resolution is electronic phase stepping. It scans the source spot of the x-ray tube with an <b>electro-magnetic</b> field. This causes {{the projection of}} the object {{to move in the}} opposite direction, and also causes a relative movement between the projection and the Moiré fringes. The images are digitally shifted to realign the projections. The end result is that the projection of the object is stationary, while the Moiré fringes move over it. This technique effectively synthesizes the phase stepping process, but without the costs and delays associated with mechanical movements.|$|E
25|$|Archers {{powerplant}} {{continued to}} give trouble, particularly the <b>electro-magnetic</b> clutches. If the clutch disengaged the engines would race at high revs {{and had to}} be shut down in order for repairs to be made. This was particularly problematic if aircraft were flying or there were enemy submarines nearby. On 26 June, Archer departed Freetown bound for Bermuda, where she was to undergo repairs. Work started on 15 July and took some fourteen weeks to complete. Archer then sailed to New York City where she joined Convoy UGS 2 which departed New York on 2 November bound for Casablanca, Morocco. She ferried 30 Curtiss P-40 Warhawks and US personnel to Casablanca. She then sailed to Gibraltar to join convoy MKF 3 which departed Gibraltar on 27 November. When Archer arrived in the UK, she was sent to Liverpool for another refit which commenced on 4 December. Her flight deck was lengthened at this refit.|$|E

[...] The system improved the vehicle's survivability rate, increasing it [...] by up to 80%. [...] Drozd was followed by Shtora in the late 1980s, which used an <b>electro-magnetic</b> jammer to confuse inbound enemy anti-tank missiles and rockets. [...] In late 1994 the Russian Army deployed {{a large number of}} armoured fighting vehicles to Chechnya, where they were ambushed and suffered heavy casualties. [...] The effectiveness of Chechen rocket-propelled grenades against Russian combat vehicles prompted the Kolomenskoye machine-building design bureau to devise the Arena active protection system in the early and mid-1990s. [...] An export variant, Arena-E, was also developed. [...] The system has been tested on the T-80UM-1, demonstrated at Omsk in 1997, and was considered for use on the South Korean K2 Black Panther main battle tank.|$|E
500|$|The Glenelg tram, {{part of the}} {{integrated}} Adelaide Metro public transport network, is a [...] route from the centre of Adelaide to the beachside suburb of Glenelg. Recently extended at its northern end, it is currently Adelaide's only remaining tramway. Trams run at approximately twenty-minute intervals at off-peak times, and as often as every 6 minutes during peak hour periods. Until January 2006, TypeH cars provided all services on the route. In 2005, the entire route was upgraded with new track and improved tram stops, then in 2006, eleven, thirtymetre long articulated low-floor Flexity Classic Light Rail vehicles, built by Bombardier in Germany, have since replaced the Type H trams in regular day-to-day service, although five refurbished Type H trams have been retained and operate a restricted 'heritage service' timetable on Saturdays, Sundays and Public Holidays. They have been fitted with safety measures {{similar to those of}} the new trams, including vigilance control and <b>electro-magnetic</b> track brakes.|$|E
500|$|Knifehead, {{the first}} Kaiju {{to appear in}} the film, is a tribute to the plodding kaiju of 1960s Japanese films, and is {{intended}} to look almost like a man in a rubber suit; its head was inspired by that of a goblin shark. Leatherback, the bouncer-like Kaiju which spews <b>electro-magnetic</b> charges, is a favorite of del Toro, who conceived it as a [...] "brawler with this sort of beer belly"; the lumbering movements of gorillas were used as a reference. The Kaiju Otachi homages the dragons of Chinese mythology. The director called it a [...] "Swiss army knife of a Kaiju"; with almost 20 minutes of screen time, it was given numerous features so the audience would not tire of it. The creature moves like a Komodo dragon in water, sports multiple jaws and an acid-filled neck sack, and unfurls wings when necessary. It is also more intelligent than the other Kaiju, employing eagle-inspired strategies against the Jaegers. Onibaba, the Kaiju that orphans Mako Mori, resembles a fusion of a Japanese temple and a crustacean. Slattern, the largest Kaiju, is distinguished by its extremely long neck and [...] "half-horn, half-crown" [...] head, which del Toro considered both demonic and majestic.|$|E

This would imply that all forces of nature (not just electromagnetism) must be invariant under the Lorentz transformation. In 1921 Lorentz credited Poincaré for establishing the principle and postulate of relativity and wrote: [...] "I have not established the principle of relativity as rigorously and universally true.
