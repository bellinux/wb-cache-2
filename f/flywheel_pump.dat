40|$|The {{impact of}} {{renewable}} energy installations connected to the utility grid {{is an important issue}} concerning the technical and economic viability of harnessing these emerging energy sources. Distribution networks must be carefully controlled in order to maintain an acceptable power supply quality. The major sources of non-conventional energy are small scale generation and storage from mini hydro, photovoltaic, wind power, fuel cells, battery, <b>flywheel,</b> <b>pump</b> storage and biomass. The aim of this thesis is to analyse the variation in voltage of the distribution network when renewable energy sources are interconnected to the distribution network, in terms of it's stability. In particular this study analyses the impact of interconnection of small synchronous generators to the utility power grid. Dynamic stability analysis is mainly concerned with analysing the response of electrical power system to small perturbation about a given operating point. These studies are particularly important due to the growing interest in interconnecting small renewable energy sources to large and complex power systems. Simulation studies were carried out in order to find out the transient stability and voltage stability of the non-conventional energy sources under different operating conditions. A 5 -second simulation was conducted using explicit numerical integration (Euler method) and an integration time step of 0. 002 second. Power System Toolbox was used for analysis. The multimachine power system models used in this thesis are generated in MATLAB code. The load flow is performed on the multimachine power system correponding to the loading condition to be investigated. The machines are represented by the two-axis models, the exciters by IEEE Type- 1 models and the loads are modelled as constant impedances. To save programming time, it has become common to limit the machine and exciter representations to some specified models. The network admittance matrix is reduced by retaining only the internal buses of the generators. The reduced network, machine and exciter data are then combined to form a linearised state-space model representing the entire system. The simulation studies are applied to a four machine ten bus system. It is clear from the analysis that much care should be taken based on the stability point of view while interconnecting the small renewable energy sources to the utility. The renewable energy sources should be interconnected at a point which provides higher stability margin. The renewable energy sources is a viable option if it is connected to the distribution network with necessary methods of improving transient stability and voltage stability...|$|E

The efficiency and cost of renewable solar and wind power systems using intermittent resources could significantly be improved by developing low cost, high efficiency and more sustainable energy storage systems. A comparison study between energy storage options is presented in this paper. The energy storage options include: (1) electro chemical storage: lead acid, Li-ions, Nickel-Cadmium, Nickel metal hydride, Sodium Sulfur, and vanadium flow batteries; (2) electro-magnetic energy storage: super capacitors and super conducting magnetic energy storage; (3) hydrogen storage: onboard systems and utility scale; (4) mechanical storage: compressed air, <b>flywheel,</b> <b>pumped</b> hydro, spring (composite and metal), and (5) thermal energy storage. The resource intensities and operational parameters of the energy storage options are compared in this study. The main objective is to review {{the various types of}} storage techniques and their characteristics and to determine the most appropriate technique for solar and wind energy applications: energy storage system with suitable discharge time, lowest resource intensities, best operation performance and lowest cost.

40|$|With {{the growing}} demand for electricity, {{renewable}} sources of energy have garnered a lot of support from all quarters. The problem with depending on these renewable sources is that the output from them is independent of the demand. Storage of electricity gives us an opportunity to effectively manage and balance the supply and demand of electricity. Fuel cells are a fast developing and market capturing technology that presents efficient means of storing electricity in the form of hydrogen. The aim of this research is to study the impact of integrating hydrogen fuel cell storage system with a wind farm to improve the reliability of the grid for allowing higher penetration of renewable energy sources in the power system. The installation of energy storage systems strongly depends on the economic viability of the storage system. We identified four types of fuel cells {{that could be used in}} a hydrogen fuel cell storage system. We bring together a range of estimates for each of the fuel cell systems for the economic analysis that is targeted towards the total capital costs and the total annualized costs for the storage system for individual applications like rapid reserve and load shifting. We performed sensitivity analysis to determine the effect of varying the rate of interest and cost of fuel cell on the total annualized cost of the storage system. Finally, we compared the costs of hydrogen based storage system with other storage technologies like <b>flywheel,</b> <b>pumped</b> hydro, CAES and batteries for the individual application cases...|$|R

This remarkable characteristic makes {{this type of}} bearing a suitable alternative to active magnetic bearings in fields such as kinetic energy storage <b>flywheels,</b> turbo <b>pumps,</b> high speed compressors, among others. However, the suspension can become unstable due to rotating damping. To obtain deeper understanding of this instability phenomenon this paper presents the analysis of stability of a four degree of freedom (4 dof) rotor supported by electrodynamic bearings. The 4 dof rotor model is coupled to the dynamic model of the eddy current forces generated by the electrodynamic bearing and {{the stability of the}} complete system is analyzed. This model is used to study the stability of both cylindrical and conical whirling motion of the rotor. In addition to the well known cylindrical whirl instability the possible occurrence of conical instability is demonstrated. Finally the effects of two stabilization strategies are analyze...|$|R

40|$|General Design Criterion 4 (Ref. 1) {{requires}} that structures, systems, and components {{of nuclear power}} plants important to safety be protected against the effects of missiles that might result from equipment failures. Because flywheels have large masses and rotate at speeds of 900 rpm or 1200 rpm during normal reactor operation, a loss of flywheel integrity could result in high energy missiles and excessive vibration of the reactor coolant pump assembly. The safety consequences could be significant because of possible damage to the reactor coolant system, the containment, or the engineered safety features. General Design Criterion 1 (Ref. 1) and 10 CFR Part 50, § 50. 55 a(a) (1) require that structures, systems, and components important to safety shall be designed, fabricated, erected and tested to quality standards which shall be identified and evaluated to determine their adequacy to assure a quality product {{in keeping with the}} required safety function. The following areas relating to reactor coolant <b>pump</b> <b>flywheel</b> integrity are reviewed by MTEB: 1. Materials Selection Reactor coolant <b>pump</b> <b>flywheels</b> are of a simple geometric shape, and are made of ductile material.

40|$|During {{the past}} two decades, the demand for the storage of {{electrical}} energy has mushroomed both for portable applications and for static applications. As storage and power demands have increased predominantly {{in the form of}} batteries, the system has evolved. However, the present electrochemical systems are too costly to penetrate major new markets, still higher performance is required, and environmentally acceptable materials are preferred. These limitations can be over-come only by major advances in new materials whose constituent elements must be available in large quantities in nature; nanomaterials appear to have a key role to play.

30|$|In recent years, {{ever-increasing}} energy {{demands and}} shortage of traditional fossil fuels seriously challenged the sustainable development of human society. At the same time, increasing concern about environment problems and carbon emissions {{of fossil fuels}} has provoked worldwide active research on the next-generation electric power system, which {{is known as the}} smart grid [1, 2, 3] and/or energy internet (EI) [4, 5]. It features renewable energy resources and intelligent energy management. The coming energy power generation system shifts from reliance on fossil fuels to various renewable energy resources, such as solar and wind power, etc. [6] However, the stochastic nature of some renewable resources also brings new challenges to the reliability and stability of existing power grids. Thus it is expected that using grid-connected energy storage system (ESS) for power buffering, peak shaving, load levelling and load frequency control, shall be important for modern electric power systems with large-scale renewable energy integration [7, 8]. Available energy storage technologies include batteries, super capacitors, <b>flywheels,</b> and <b>pumped</b> hydro storage, where batteries are generally considered as the dominant new solution for large-scale ESS due to its ability to supply power for periods of up to a few hours [9, 10]. The cost of batteries is descending rapidly and is expected to compete with pumped hydro in the near future [11].|$|R

The engine and all of the ancillary components - starter, generator/alternator, radiator, distributor, carburettor and all others - must be inspected and corrected to factory specifications. The engine itself, plus the transmission, clutch, overdrive unit, and even the driveshaft must be meticulously inspected, cleaned, and measured for wear. This will show up as deviation from original factory specifications. All of the parts - block, crankcase, head, transmission housing, etc. - should be inspected for cracks or other damage. All moving parts - pistons, crankshaft, camshaft, oil pump, bearing and bushings, <b>flywheel,</b> water <b>pump</b> and all others - must be cleaned and measured against factory specifications and, if necessary, machined or re-manufactured to bring them within specifications. The same goes for the transmission, clutch, differential and all other moving parts of the power line and drive line. All of the electrical system has to be inspected and, if it shows chafing, wear or damage, replaced. If the car is old enough to have used rubber or even fabric based electrical wiring insulation, this should be replaced even if looks okay and upgraded to modern insulation because it is a fire risk. Then the entire engine/driveline will have to be reassembled, replacing all worn bearing and bushings, seals, gaskets, belts and gears.|$|R

They are used widely in the field of ultra-high speed and ultra-precise numerical control machine tools, bearingless motors, high speed <b>flywheels,</b> artificial heart <b>pumps,</b> and molecular pumps, and they are being strengthened and extended in various important areas. In this paper, a comprehensive overview is given of different bearing topologies of RMBs with different stator poles that differ in their construction, the driving mode of electromagnets, power consumption, cost, magnetic circuits, and symmetry. RMBs with different poles and couplings between the two bearing axes in the radial direction responsible for cross-coupling generation are compared. In addition, different shaped rotors are compared, as the performances of magnetic bearing-rotor systems are of great concern to rotor constructions. Furthermore, the parameter design methods, the mathematical models and control strategies of the RMBs are described in detail. From the comparison of topologies, models and control methods for RMBs, the advantages, disadvantages and utilizable perspectives are also analyzed. Moreover, several possible development trends of the RMBs are discussed. Keywords: Radial magnetic bearings (RMBs), Topologies, Mathematical mode, Control strategies, Development trend...|$|R
40|$|Brief Description of {{the change}} (what is being changed and why) : This report {{summarizes}} changes to the AP 1000 reactor coolant pump design which have resulted from detailed design work. The major changes include: 1) The reactor coolant <b>pump</b> <b>flywheel</b> design has changed from depleted uranium to a design of bi-metallic construction. The change to a bi-metallic flywheel was necessary because the depleted uranium flywheel could not provide the inertia needed for the required pump coastdown without increasing the flywheel diameter to a size that resulted in stresses in the uranium which exceeded the design limits. 2) The thermal barrier cooling coil and wraparound heat exchanger configuration has been replaced with an externally mounted, conventional shell and tube heat exchanger and a stator cooling jacket. Utilizing an external heat exchanger mounted above the pump removable assembly allows for natural circulation cooling flow through the motor {{when it is not}} running. The natural circulation capability of the external heat exchanger configuration enables the elimination of the thermal barrier cooling coils. 3) A keyphasor and additional vibration monitors {{have been added to the}} design to allow fo...|$|R
40|$|Homopolar radial {{electrodynamic}} bearings (EDBs) are {{one type}} of passive magnetic bearing that exploits eddy currents developing in a rotating conductor to produce levitation forces. When the rotor spins at high speed and an external force causes the axis of rotation to move radially {{with respect to the}} symmetry axis of the static magnetic field, the relative motion between the two members causes currents to be induced in the rotor which in turn generate a reaction force. Since the currents are induced inside the rotor, the rotational loss is converted into heat in the rotating member. Because EDBs are especially suitable for applications that run continuously and that usually work in vacuum, e. g., <b>flywheels</b> and turbomolecular <b>pumps,</b> an evaluation of the bearing's losses in working conditions is of extreme importance. The present paper investigates the amount of rotational loss that is produced by an EDB in working conditions. The analysis is performed using an electromechanical model of the EDB coupled to a Jeffcott rotor model. The analysis allows deducing a set of design equations {{that can be used to}} predict the bearing's losses during the design phase. The model is validated by comparison with finite element model...|$|R
40|$|In an open-pool type {{research}} reactor, {{the primary}} cooling {{system can be}} designed to have a downward flow inside the core during normal operation because of the plate type fuel geometry. There is a flow inversion inside the core from the downward flow by the inertia force of the primary coolant to the upward flow by the natural circulation when the pump is turned off. To delay the flow inversion time, an innovative passive system with <b>pump</b> <b>flywheel</b> and GCCT is developed to remove the residual heat. Before the primary cooling pump starts up, the water level of the GCCT {{is the same as}} that of the reactor pool. During the primary cooling pump operation, the water in the GCCT is moved into the reactor pool because of the pump suction head. After the pump stops, the potential head generates a downward flow inside the core by moving the water from the reactor pool to the GCCT and removes the residual heat. When the water levels of the two pools are the same again, the core flow has an inversion of the flow direction, and natural circulation is developed through the flap valves...|$|R
40|$|The {{temporal}} mismatches in {{the varying}} demand and supply pose {{a major challenge}} for today’s U. S. electricity grid. Demand response (DR), aiming at reducing demand on the grid during times of electricity generation capacity shortage and very high wholesale prices, {{is one of many}} approaches to address this challenge. Unlike the sophisticated automatic controls to operate appliances (such as lights and air-conditioning) on shifted or reduced schedules, which are more common in the commercial sector, the proposed DR scheme discharges storage when demand on the grid is high so as to enable DR without affecting actual appliance usage. As small-scale storage technologies and residential demand response tariffs (e. g., time-of-use tariffs, which charge in differing rates for peak times and off-peak times) become more available, distributed energy storage for the residential sector DR is now technically ready and has the opportunity to generate financial incentives for residential consumers. However, such storage-based DR is still largely underutilized in the residential sector, partly due to consumers’ concerns about cost-effectiveness of storage. Thus, these concerns call for a comprehensive economic analysis to answer the following two questions: 1) Could storage yield actual profits (i. e., electricity cost reduction via arbitrage minus levelized storage cost) for residential consumers? And 2) Which particular combination of storage technology and tariff yields the highest profit? In addition, {{from the perspective of the}} grid, a third question is yet to be answered: If a large portion of households were to apply economically optimized storage-based DR systems, what would be the implications and emission impacts (i. e., CO₂, NOₓ, and SO₂ emissions) for the grid? To address the above questions, I 1) develop a levelized storage cost model, based on the simulated storage lifetime — a hybrid of the total-energy-throughput lifetime and the calendar lifetime. Storage technologies included in this dissertation are conventional and flow batteries, <b>flywheel,</b> magnetic storage, <b>pumped</b> hydro, compressed air, and capacitor; 2) devise an agent-based, appliance-level demand model to simulate demand profiles for an average household in the U. S.; 3) dispatch storage via loadshifting (to time-shift energy requirements from peak times to off-peak times) and peak shaving (to reduce peak power, i. e., kW, demands and smooth demand profiles) strategies, under realistic tariffs (Con Edison, New York); and 4) optimize the storage capacity (in kWh) and the demand limit on the grid (in kW; above which the strategy will attempt to use stored electricity in addition to grid electricity to satisfy appliance demand; used for the peak shaving strategy only) and determine the potential profits (or losses). I find that: 1) For economically viable technologies, annual profits range from < 1 % to 28 % of the household’s non-DR electricity bill by utilizing the loadshifting strategy and from < 1 % to 37 % by implementing the peak shaving strategy, depending on the storage technologies; 2) Of the two DR strategies, the peak shaving strategy can render more storage technologies economically viable. To evaluate the potential implications for the New York state grid, the electricity consumption features of households in New York state are then fed into the demand model. A dispatch curve is then developed, based on the marginal generation cost of each power plant, to simulate the dispatch order of the available power plants in New York state. The potential implications and emission impacts are investigated by comparing the statewide demand profiles as well as generation emissions with and without residential sector storage and DR. I find that: 1) Although yielding substantial financial incentives for households, the peak shaving strategy only leads to minor impact on the grid (assuming 15 % household participation rate); 2) The loadshifting strategy would cause extra grid stress, and likely lead to brownouts, when all participating households start to re-charge their storage by purchasing inexpensive electricity uncoordinatedly; and 3) The overall emission impacts for both strategies are less than 5 % of the total non-DR emissions in the state of New York...|$|R
