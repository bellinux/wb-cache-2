CL cases, solutions, and water taps were cultured for bacteria, which amoebae require for growth. Acanthamoeba spp were isolated from water drawn from six bathroom cold water <b>taps</b> (<b>tank</b> supplied), five in the presence of limescale, and from one kitchen cold water tap (mains supplied). There was an association between the presence of limescale in water and direct culture for free-living amoebae, suggesting that scale provides a favourable microenvironment for amoebae. Acanthamoebae were also found in dust from around one washbasin. Nineteen of 50 CL cases, 12 / 122 CL care rinsing solutions, and 59 / 100 cold water taps yielded Gram negative bacteria which could be ingested by amoebae. It is concluded from this study that CLs should not be washed in first-drawn tank-fed cold water, especially if limescale is present, and that soft CLs should be rinsed in manufactured single-use, sterile solutions. Rigid CL and CL cases should only be washed with boiled tap water (preferably hot), or single-use sterile solutions, and stored dry to prevent multiplication of amoebae and Gram negative bacteria...|$|R

40|$|Entry of contaminants, such as {{metals and}} non-metals, into {{rainwater}} harvesting systems can occur directly from rainfall with contributions from collection surfaces, accumulated debris and leachate from storage systems, pipes and taps. Ten rainwater harvesting systems {{on the east}} coast of Australia were selected for sampling of roof runoff, storage systems and tap outlets to investigate the variations in rainwater composition as it moved throughout the system, and to identify potential points of contribution to elemental loads. A total of 26 elements were screened at each site. Iron was the only element which was present in significantly higher concentrations in roof runoff samples compared with <b>tank</b> <b>tap</b> samples (P < 0. 05). At one case study site, results suggested that piping and tap material can contribute to contaminant loads of harvested rainwater. Increased loads of copper were observed in hot tap samples supplied by the rainwater harvesting system via copper piping and a storage hot water system (P < 0. 05). Similarly, zinc, lead, arsenic, strontium and molybdenum were significantly elevated in samples collected from a polyvinyl chloride pipe sampling point that does not supply household uses, compared with corresponding roof runoff samples (P < 0. 05). Elemental composition was also found to vary significantly between the <b>tank</b> <b>tap</b> and an internal cold tap at one of the sites investigated, with several elements fluctuating significantly between the two outlets of interest at this site, including potassium, zinc, manganese, barium, copper, vanadium, chromium and arsenic.

40|$|Objective To {{identify}} {{the prevalence of}} Acanthamoeba in drinking water treatment plants {{during the course of}} the purification processes. Methods Samples were taken from two drinking water purification plants and monitored for the presence of Acanthamoeba in order to estimate the removal capacity of treatment methods employed. Water samples were collected at each step in the purification, during the one year survey, and analysed for the presence of Acanthamoeba spp. by plating on bacterial-seeded plates. Results : The results showed that amoebae were present in surface raw waters in 100 % of the samples tested. Acanthamoeba spp. were isolated from 71 % and 57 % of the water samples collected from post flat-bottom clarifier 1 and post-sedimentation plant respectively. Considering the outflow drinking waters, the removal capacity was 100 % in both purification plants monitored. The occurrence of Acanthamoeba was not associated with seasonality. Conclusion : These findings confirm that water purification plants employing methods of flocculation, sedimentation, and filtration in combination with activated charcoal filtration, ozonisation and chlorination exhibited sufficient Acanthamoeba removal capacity and the presence of amoebae in the tap water may be due to older plumbing, water storage <b>tanks,</b> <b>tap</b> water hygiene, and/or environmental settings...|$|R
40|$|Water {{quality and}} {{availability}} are important issues {{in many developing}} countries where portions of populations still lack access to potable water. Throughout the English-speaking Caribbean and parts of Latin America, households and businesses invest in water supply systems even when they are connected to and pay for water services from a private or state owned provider. Inconsistent supplies of water from the water companies have led many people to invest in storage tanks which, if operated correctly, can provide water throughout the day even when the supply from the main is low or zero. While these individual systems help to guarantee a more constant supply of water, they may impact water quality when it does reach the household <b>tap.</b> The <b>tanks</b> could become breeding grounds for vectors of human disease and may also affect the concentrations of bacteria, heavy metals and organics in the water. The goal of this research was to understand how households use water storage tanks and determine the effect of these tanks and the individual practices on water quality. Target plots were used to visualize linkages between water quality parameters and household surveys of localized water practices and perception on water quality. The study focused on three field sites: Siparia, Trinidad and Tobago, Region 4 Subset in Guyana, and Villa Litoral, Bolivia. Convenience sampling was used to administer surveys to households in the rural areas of Siparia (39), Region 4 Subset (40), and Villa Litoral (57). The Region 4 Subset is comprised of two rural areas, Mon Repos and Mocha, and Georgetown, the country 2 ̆ 7 s capital.

40|$|Higher Doctorate - Doctor of Philosophy (PhD) Research in {{the field}} of {{rainwater}} harvesting and harvested rainwater quality has increased substantially over the past decade, as countries explore alternative water sources to supplement mains water supplies. Despite the increased interest in rainwater harvesting, there remain several gaps in the literature with regard to both external sources of contamination of rainwater tanks (e. g. atmospheric deposition), and components of the rainwater harvesting system (RWHS) itself. Previous studies have focussed either on relatively few study sites, low sample numbers, or have investigated only a handful of organic or inorganic contaminants. This research project comprised a relatively large number (41) of RWHSs located in eastern and southern Australia. Samples were collected from the available sampling points of RWHSs, including: a downpipe for the collection of roof runoff, a tap located close {{to the base of the}} rainwater tank (‘tank tap’), an indoor cold tap supplied by the RWHS, and an indoor hot tap supplied by the RWHS. Samples were then analysed for a range of organic and inorganic contaminants. A method was developed that allowed harvested rainwater samples to be screened for a large number of organic compounds from different classes, using gas chromatography – mass spectrometry (GC-MS). These compounds included fatty acids, sterols, phthalate esters, polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs) and aliphatic hydrocarbons. Inorganic contaminants of interest included a suite of 26 metals and non-metals, analysed by high resolution inductively coupled plasma – mass spectrometry (HR ICP-MS). A number of statistical comparisons were undertaken to determine whether organic and inorganic composition of roof-harvested rainwater differed significantly at the regional and individual site level. Organic and inorganic composition of roof-harvested rainwater was found to be highly variable, resulting in large standard error values. Roof-harvested rainwater samples contained organic compounds consistent with or indicative of biological debris and decay, faecal contamination from birds and small mammals, pollutants from atmospheric deposition and compounds leached from catchment surfaces. High variances meant that there were no significant differences in organic composition of roof-harvested rainwater at the regional level. Variations did, however, occur between urban, rural and industrial locations, and between RWHSs located in the same regions. This was assumed to be a result of differences in the micro-climates in which individual RWHSs were located, in addition to differences in individual system components (e. g. roofing / tank materials). Roof-harvested rainwater collected from sites located in industrial areas contained significantly higher levels of barium, copper and lead than samples collected from urban and rural areas (P< 0. 05). When inorganic composition of roof-harvested rainwater was compared between sampling points of all 41 RWHSs included in the large-scale study, only cobalt was found to differ significantly, with hot tap samples containing significantly higher levels of this element than <b>tank</b> <b>tap</b> and cold tap samples (P< 0. 05). However, a number of case studies were also carried out, in order to characterise potential variations in composition between sampling points at the individual site level. These case studies indicated that inorganic composition could indeed differ consistently and significantly between sampling points. Levels of zinc and manganese were elevated in roof runoff samples compared with samples from other available sampling points, from 1 case study site (Tank 7). This may have been the result of atmospheric deposition and/or leaching from roofing materials. In-tank processes such as sedimentation, flocculation, dilution and actions of biofilm bacteria may then act to reduce levels of these elements in <b>tank</b> <b>tap</b> samples and other outlets downstream of the storage tank. Many elements were lower in concentration in surface runoff samples compared with various sampling points for the stored rainwater at another case study site (Site E), suggesting that atmospheric deposition may not always represent the major contribution to the total contaminant load of stored rainwater. Copper piping was shown to contribute to levels of copper, and old PVC piping was shown to contribute to levels of lead, nickel and zinc in roof-harvested rainwater. Tank construction materials did not appear to significantly affect elemental composition of roof-harvested rainwater, when Aquaplate™, concrete and plastic tanks were compared. Levels of copper, zinc, lead and nickel were also shown to differ significantly between the <b>tank</b> <b>tap</b> outlets of 4 plastic RWHSs located on the same site and fed by the same roof catchment surface (P< 0. 05). Possible explanations for these site-level differences include variations in climatic factors such as temperature and time spent in full sun versus full shade, due to the differences in aspect of each of the RWHSs. Usage patterns may also influence elemental composition of harvested rainwater in these 4 rainwater tanks. Although studies investigating the quality of harvested rainwater have often been criticised for including too few study sites, large-scale studies were shown by this research to mask differences between regions, or sampling points, due to the high variability associated with harvested rainwater composition contributed by RWHS design, plumbing and construction. The end user of a RWHS exists at the individual site level. It is therefore at this level that contaminant sources and harvested rainwater quality are most important. Large scale studies should therefore be combined with several case studies, comprising replicate samples collected from all available sampling points, in order to accurately determine harvested rainwater quality and potential contaminant sources at the level of the end user. These case studies will ultimately provide guidance on RWHS design and maintenance optimisation, for the collection of higher quality rainwater, which can then replace mains water supplies for a greater number of uses...|$|R
50|$|Ulithi (Wulthiy, Yulthiy, or Wugöy) is an atoll in the Caroline Islands of {{the western}} Pacific Ocean, about 191 km (103 {{nautical}} mi) east of Yap. It consists of 40 islets totalling 4.5 km2, surrounding a lagoon about 36 km long and up to 24 km wide—at 548 km2 {{one of the largest}} in the world. It is administered by the state of Yap in the Federated States of Micronesia. Ulithi's population was 773 in 2000. There are four inhabited islands on Ulithi Atoll. They are Falalop (Fl'aalop), Asor (Yasor), Mogmog (Mwagmwog), and Fedarai (Fedraey). Falalop is the most accessible with an air strip, a small resort hotel, gas dealership, store and one of three public high schools in Yap state. Mogmog is the seat of the high chief of Ulithi Atoll though each island has its own chief. Other important islands are Losiap (L'oosiyep), Sorlen (Sohl'oay), and Potangeras (Potoangroas). The atoll is in the westernmost of the Caroline Islands, 360 mi southwest of Guam, 850 mi east of the Philippines and 1300 mi south of Tokyo. It is a typical volcanic atoll, with a coral reef, white sand beaches and palm trees. Ulithi's forty small islands barely rise above the sea, with the largest being only 1/2 sq mi in area. However the reef runs roughly 20 mi north and south, by 10 mi across, enclosing a vast anchorage with an average depth of 80 to(-) 100 ft.Ulithi was a major staging area for the U.S. Navy in the final year of the Second World War.

5000|$|The Gibraltar Caving Group {{discovered}} {{the location of}} the long-sought-after Operation Tracer in December 1996. It had become known locally as Stay Behind Cave, as the official name was a mystery at the time. The group that made the discovery comprised Richard Durrell, Jean Paul Latin, Mark Ainsworth, and Ian Bramble. They had heard rumours of a secret military complex in Gibraltar since they were children. The group had analysed the possible locations and realised that in order for the World War II observation post to monitor both the Mediterranean Sea and the Bay of Gibraltar, the chamber would have to be positioned very high up in the Upper Rock. One day while exploring tunnels, the men experienced an unexpected gust of wind. It induced them to closely examine the tunnel walls. Carefully breaking down a portion of the corrugated galvanised iron wall, they {{discovered the}} doorway to a passage, which led to a chamber. Examining the interior of the room and its associated passages, they found that the west side observation post over the bay was a slit that was concealed with a concrete wedge. The east side observation post had a larger opening through which someone could climb onto a narrow ledge and still be concealed. The group also found the remains of a bicycle that had been used to generate electricity and power a ventilation system. In addition, there was a water tank with a capacity of 10000 imp gal. While sludge initially came out of the <b>tank's</b> <b>tap,</b> the water soon ran clear. The group exploring the chambers quickly realised that they had discovered Stay Behind Cave. Although a survival manual for Operation Tracer was compiled, the Gibraltar Caving Group has not yet been able to access it. Under the auspices of the Gibraltar Museum, the group performed a survey of the complex in conjunction with the Spanish organisation GIEX, a Speleological Research Group from Jerez de la Frontera. After detailed measurements, member Mark Ainsworth used a computer to generate drawings of the complex. In addition, 3-dimensional images were created utilising a survey technique by GIEX member J.

The experiments were conducted with jet velocities ranging from 0.7 to 4.77  m/s under a discharge range of 2.3 to 3.6  L/s. Thickness of jet was manually adjusted by scaling the vertical opening between pipe outlet and aerator end. For obtaining the amount of oxygen transferred to water in the tank for a particular jet aerator, a known volume of water was filled in the tank. An estimated quantity of sodium sulfite (Na 2 SO 3) along with cobalt chloride (CoCl 2) as catalyst was added to bring dissolved oxygen level of water in the tank between 1.0 and 2.0  mg/L (Deswal 2008), and a sample of water was taken for initial DO (C 0) measurement. Then, the aerator was allowed to run for a specified period of time. (It was ensured that the device was run for a period (t) that DO of water in the tank does not reach the saturation value at the test temperature, T°C, and the final DO (Ct) was then measured.) Two samples are collected from the tank for final DO determination, and the average DO value of two samples is considered as final DO (Ct). The temperature of water in the tank is measured by a mercury thermometer with a minimum accuracy of ±[*] 0.1  °C. The procedure was repeated for various runs of observations by using different jet aerators. The value of volumetric oxygen transfer coefficient (KLa) was then estimated.|$|R
