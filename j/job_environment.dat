Job satisfaction and personal satisfaction together should determine how long one remains at a job.

50|$|The {{distinction}} {{made between}} {{job satisfaction and}} dissatisfaction in quality of working life reflects the influence of job satisfaction theories. Herzberg at al., (1959) used “Hygiene factors” and “Motivator factors” {{to distinguish between the}} separate causes of job satisfaction and job dissatisfaction. It has been suggested that Motivator factors are intrinsic to the job, that is; job content, the work itself, responsibility and advancement. The Hygiene factors or dissatisfaction-avoidance factors include aspects of the <b>job</b> <b>environment</b> such as interpersonal relationships, salary, working conditions and security. Of these latter, {{the most common cause of}} job dissatisfaction can be company policy and administration, whilst achievement can be the greatest source of extreme satisfaction.|$|E
50|$|In {{response}} {{to one of}} the disadvantages of Motivator-Hygiene Theory, Job Characteristics Theory added an individual difference factor into the model. While Herzberg et al. took into account the importance of intrinsically and extrinsically motivating job characteristics there was no consideration of individual differences. The importance of individual differences had been demonstrated by previous work showing that some individuals are more likely to positively respond to an enriched <b>job</b> <b>environment</b> than others. Thus, the original version of the theory posits an individual difference characteristic, Growth Need Strength (GNS), that moderates the effect of the core job characteristics on outcomes. Jobholders with high Growth Need Strength should respond more positively to the opportunities provided by jobs with high levels of the five core characteristics compared to low GNS jobholders.|$|E
50|$|From {{analyzing}} these interviews, {{he found}} that job characteristics related to what an individual does — that is, {{to the nature of}} the work one performs — apparently have the capacity to gratify such needs as achievement, competency, status, personal worth, and self-realization, thus making him happy and satisfied. However, the absence of such gratifying job characteristics does not appear to lead to unhappiness and dissatisfaction. Instead, dissatisfaction results from unfavorable assessments of such job-related factors as company policies, supervision, technical problems, salary, interpersonal relations on the job, and working conditions. Thus, if management wishes to increase satisfaction on the job, it should be concerned with the nature of the work itself — the opportunities it presents for gaining status, assuming responsibility, and for achieving self-realization. If, on the other hand, management wishes to reduce dissatisfaction, then it must focus on the <b>job</b> <b>environment</b> — policies, procedures, supervision, and working conditions. If management is equally concerned with both, then managers must give attention to both sets of job factors.|$|E

5000|$|On the IBM 1620 {{there are}} four switches, and their state can be tested via special forms of the IF-statement offered by the FORTRAN {{compiler}} for the IBM 1620. For the IBM 1130 there are sixteen switches matching the sixteen-bit word size of the computer, plus a toggle switch adjacent to the power on/off switch. These bit-switches are more normally used with the computer stopped to specify some memory address to be viewed (via the indicator lights on the front panel), or set. The state of these switches can be determined by a program, and so a running program might modify its behavior depending on the switches, such as change the amount of progress information printed, alter the tactics of a multi-variable optimization attempt, and so on. The IBM 1130 also has an [...] "Interrupt Request" [...] key associated with the console printer, whose pressing might cause a suitably programmed long-running program to type a progress report on the console printer. In the more usual batch <b>job</b> <b>environment,</b> it was pressed by the computer operator to signal the operating system to terminate a running program that had perhaps overrun its allowed time, or commenced misbehavior such as repeatedly printing blank lines.|$|E

40|$|Graduation date: 1986 The {{primary purpose}} of this study was to test the {{conventional}} view of job factors as satisfiers and dissatisfiers of members of the National Association of Directors of Christian Education. The conventional view stated that all job factors can potentially contribute to job satisfaction and to job dissatisfaction. A second view, known as the motivation-hygiene view, stated that factors that dealt with the job itself can lead only to job satisfaction and factors that dealt with the <b>job</b> <b>environment</b> can lead only to job dissatisfaction. A literature review provided information that supported both perspectives. Two questionnaires developed by Friedlander (1964) were used to measure eighteen job factors as satisfiers and dissatisfiers. One hundred and four subjects provided answers for the two questionnaires which were analyzed with an ANOVA F statistic and with the Least Significant Difference test.
