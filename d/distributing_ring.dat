The state space of time-extended Petri nets is mapped onto its basic underlying stochastic process, which can be shown to be Markovian under the assumption of exponentially <b>distributed</b> <b>ring</b> times. The integration of exponentially and non-exponentially distributed timing {{is still one of the}} major problems for the analysis and was rst attacked for continuous time Petri nets at the cost of structural or analytical restrictions. We propose a discrete deterministic and stochastic Petri net (DDSPN) formalism with no imposed structural or analytical restrictions where transitions can re either in zero time or according to arbitrary ring times that can be represented as the time to absorption in a nite absorbing discrete time Markov chain (DTMC). Exponentially <b>distributed</b> <b>ring</b> times are then approximated arbitrarily well by geometric distributions. Deterministic r-ing times are a special case of the geometric distribution. The underlying stochastic process of a DDSPN is then also a DTMC, from which the transient and stationary solution can be obtained by standard techniques. A comprehensive algorithm and some state space reduction techniques for the analysis of DDSPNs are presented comprising the automatic detection of con icts and confusions, which removes a major obstacle for the analysis of discrete time models...|$|R

The available downstream bandwidth in the centralized scheme is reduced due to LAN emulation and upstream bandwidth allocation functions.

To address this problem, we implement a LAN capable <b>distributed</b> <b>ring</b> architecture, where Optical Line Terminal is relieved from the burden of upstream bandwidth allocation and inter-ONU communication. Consequently, this increases the available downstream bandwidth and thereby enhancing downstream performance in terms of queuing delay, utilization, and packet loss ratio...|$|R
40|$|Abstract In a <b>distributed</b> <b>ring</b> {{signature}} scheme, {{a subset}} of users cooperate to compute a distributed anonymous signature on a message, {{on behalf of a}} family of possible signing subsets. The receiver can verify that the signature comes from {{a subset of}} the ring, but he cannot know which subset has actually signed. In this work we use the concept of dual access structures to construct a <b>distributed</b> <b>ring</b> signature scheme which works with general families of possible signing subsets. The length of each signature is linear on the number of involved users, which is desirable for some families with many possible signing subsets. The scheme achieves the desired properties of correctness, anonymity and unforgeability. The reduction in the proof of unforgeability is tighter than the reduction in the previous proposals which work with general families. We analyze the case in which our scheme runs in an identity-based scenario, where public keys of the users can be derived from their identities. This fact avoids the necessity of digital certificates, and therefore allows more efficient implementations of such systems. But our scheme can be extended to work in more general scenarios, where users can have different types of keys. 1 Introduction In standard public key cryptosystems, the public keys of the users must be authenticated via a Public Key Infrastructure (PKI) based on digital certificates, which link the identities of the users with their public keys.

40|$|AbstractWe {{study the}} bit {{complexity}} of pattern recognition in a <b>distributed</b> <b>ring</b> with a leader. Each processor gets as input {{a letter from}} some alphabet, and these concatenated letters, starting at the leader, form {{the pattern of the}} ring. The leader initiates an algorithm that accepts or rejects this pattern. Thus each algorithm recognizes a language over a given alphabet. We prove the following (n is the size of the ring, not known a priori to any of the processors) : 1. (1) A language is recognized by an algorithm that uses O(n) bits if any only if it is regular. 2. (2) Every non-regular language requires at least Î©(nlogn) bits for its recognition (clearly, every language requires no more than O(n 2) bits for its recognition). 3.

The method has been used earlier for solving problems of free vibration analysis and large amplitude deflection analysis of isotropic and orthotropic spherical shellsâ€”static analysis (Dumir et al. 1984; Nath and Jain 1986).

40|$|Digital {{signatures}} {{are one of}} {{the most}} important consequences of the appearance of public key cryptography, in 1976. These schemes provide authentication, integrity and non-repudiation to digital communications. Some extensions or variations of the concept of digital signature have been introduced, and many specific realizations of these new types of nature schemes have been proposed. In this thesis, we deal with the basic definitions and required security properties of traditional signature schemes and two of its extensions: distributed signature schemes and ring signature schemes. We review the state of the art in these two topics; then we propose and analyze new specific schemes for different scenarios. Namely, we first study distributed signature schemes for general access structures, based on RSA; then we show that such schemes can be used to construct other cryptographic protocols: distributed key distribution schemes and metering schemes. With respect to ring signatures, we opose schemes for both a scenario where the keys are of the Discrete Logarithm type and a scenario where the public keys of users are inferred from their personal identities. Finally, we also propose some <b>distributed</b> <b>ring</b> signature schemes, a kind of schemes which combine the concepts of <b>distributed</b> signatures and <b>ring</b> signatures. We formally prove the security of all these proposals, assuming that some mathematical problems are hard to solve. Specifically, we base the security of our schemes in the hardness of either the RSA problem, or the Discrete Logarithm problem, or the Computational Diffie-Hellman problem.

40|$|Abstract In a ring {{signature}} scheme, a signer in {{a subset}} (or ring) of potential signers produces a signature {{of a message}} {{in such a way}} that the receiver can verify that the signature comes from a member of the ring, but cannot know which member has actually signed. In this work, we extend this concept to that of <b>distributed</b> <b>ring</b> signatures, where a subset of users cooperate to compute a distributed anonymous signature on a message, on behalf of a family of subsets. We propose two schemes, one for general families of subsets, and a more efficient one for threshold families of subsets. The security of both proposals is formally proved, assuming the hardness of the Computational Diffie-Hellman problem. Our two schemes run in an identity-based scenario, where public keys of the users can be derived from their identities. This fact avoids the necessity of digital certificates, and therefore allows more efficient implementations of such systems. 1 Introduction In a standard public key scenario: each user U has a secret key S...|$|R

40|$|In {{order to}} {{understand}} the transmission of a disease across a population we will have to understand not only the dynamics of contact infection but the transfer of health-care beliefs and resulting health-care behaviors across that population. This paper is a first step in that direction, focusing on the contrasting role of linkage or isolation between sub-networks in (a) contact infection and (b) belief transfer. Using both analytical tools and agent-based simulations we show that it is the structure of a network that is primary for predicting contact infectionâ€”whether the networks or sub-networks at issue are <b>distributed</b> <b>ring</b> networks or total networks (hubs, wheels, small world, random, or scale-free for example). Measured in terms of time to total infection, degree of linkage between sub-networks plays a minor role. The case of belief is importantly different. Using a simplified model of belief reinforcement, and measuring belief transfer in terms of time to community consensus, we show that degree of linkage between sub-networks {{plays a major role in}} social communication of beliefs. Here, in contrast to the case of contract infection, network type turns out to be of relatively minor importance. What you believe travels differently. In a final section we show that the pattern of belief transfer exhibits a classic power law regardless of the type of network involved. Authors...|$|R
