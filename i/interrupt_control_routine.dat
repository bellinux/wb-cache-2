40|$|Electron {{microscopy}} (EM) is {{an important}} tool in organellar proteomics, where {{it is used to}} validate sample purity and to confirm protein presence. Current sample preparation techniques are manual, labor-intensive and time-consuming. To overcome these problems, an electron microscopy proteomic organellar preparation (EMPOP) robot is being developed for parallel preparation of up to 96 subcellular fraction samples in an efficient, repeatable and standardized manner. This thesis describes the development and validation of the software that controls the EMPOP robot. The software was organized in two coordinated levels consisting of a: (1) human-machine interface (HMI), and (2) low-level real-time <b>control</b> <b>routines.</b> The HMI was designed to be 'friendly and flexible', and to enable the operator to modify system parameters on-the-fly. Contrarily, the low-level <b>control</b> <b>routines</b> are responsible for controlling all EMPOP system processes.

We propose {{that it is possible}} to build a general purpose vision system, that is, one that can support a wide variety of tasks, and take advantage of such constraints. The central idea within our proposed architecture is the reactive skill. Skills are concurrent <b>control</b> <b>routines</b> assembled at run time using instructions from a symbolic execution system. Visual modules are used as resources in the construction of these skills. Skills control the agent as continuous feedback loops but are constructed using discrete, symbolic instructions. The key to general-purpose vision is the ability to parametrize the primitive elements of the vision system and to compose visual and <b>control</b> <b>routines</b> in a variety of ways.

40|$|Current {{radiation}} protection {{standards for the}} public include a limit on effective dose in any year for individuals in critical groups. This paper considers {{the question of how}} the annual dose limit should be applied in <b>controlling</b> <b>routine</b> exposures of populations consisting of individuals of all ages. The authors assume that the fundamental objective of {{radiation protection}} is limitation of lifetime risk and, therefore, that standards for <b>controlling</b> <b>routine</b> exposures of the public should provide a reasonable correspondence with lifetime risk, taking into account the age dependence of intakes and doses and the variety of radionuclides and exposure pathways of concern. Using new calculations of the per capita (population-averaged) risk of cancer mortality per unit activity inhaled or ingested in the US Environmental Protection Agency`s Federal Guidance Report No. 13, the authors show that applying a limit on annual effective dose only to adults, which was the usual practice in radiation protection of the public before the development of age-specific effective dose coefficients, provides a considerably better correspondence with lifetime risk than applying the annual dose limit to the critical group of any age...|$|R

40|$|This paper {{describes}} {{the development of}} an adaptive computer <b>control</b> <b>routine</b> for a robotically, deployed focused, ultrasonic hyperthermia cancer treatment system. The control algorithm developed herein uses physiological models of a tumor and the surrounding healthy tissue regions and transient temperature data to estimate the treatment region`s blood perfusion. This estimate is used to vary the specific power profile of a scanned, focused ultrasonic transducer to achieve a temperature distribution {{as close as possible to}} an optimal temperature distribution. The controller is evaluated using simulations of diseased tissue and using limited experiments on a scanned, focused ultrasonic treatment system that employs a 5 -Degree-of-Freedom (D. O. F.) robot to scan the treatment transducers over a simulated patient. Results of the simulations and experiments indicate that the adaptive <b>control</b> <b>routine</b> improves the temperature distribution over standard classical control algorithms if good (although not exact) knowledge of the treated region is available. Although developed with a scanned, focused ultrasonic robotic treatment system in mind, the control algorithm is applicable to any system with the capability to vary specific power as a function of volume and having an unknown distributed energy sink proportional to temperature elevation (e. g., other robotically deployed hyperthermia treatment methods using different heating modalities) ...|$|R

We discuss how the management <b>control</b> <b>routines</b> of one organisation emerged and reproduced (through software), and moved towards a situation of becoming accepted and generally unquestioned {{across much of the}} industry. The creativity and championing of one particular person was found to be especially important in this unfolding change process.

40|$|DC marine {{architecture}} {{integrated with}} variable speed diesel generators (DGs) has garnered {{the attention of}} the researchers primarily because of its ability to deliver fuel efficient operation. This paper aims in modeling and to autonomously perform real-time load scheduling of dc platform supply vessel (PSV) with an objective to minimize specific fuel oil consumption (SFOC) for better fuel efficiency. Focus has been on the modeling of various components and <b>control</b> <b>routines,</b> which are envisaged to {{be an integral part of}} dc PSVs. Integration with photovoltaic-based energy storage system (ESS) has been considered as an option to cater for the short time load transients. In this context, this paper proposes a real-time transient simulation scheme, which comprises of optimized generation scheduling of generators and ESS using dc optimal power flow algorithm. This framework considers real dynamics of dc PSV during various marine operations with possible contingency scenarios, such as outage of generation systems, abrupt load changes, and unavailability of ESS. The proposed modeling and <b>control</b> <b>routines</b> with real-time transient simulation scheme have been validated utilizing the real-time marine simulation platform. The results indicate that the coordinated treatment of renewable based ESS with DGs operating with optimized speed yields better fuel savings.

Furthermore, SFOC minimization at multiple suboptimal points with its treatment in the real-time marine system is also highlighted...|$|R
