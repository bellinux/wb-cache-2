40|$|Emergency {{planning}} and preparedness are sometime {{omitted from the}} management of a dyeing factory. Since different processes are operating in a dyeing factory involving use of large machinery, use of hot steam and large amount of chemicals, etc. Failure in the operation may lead to explosion of machinery and spillage of toxic chemical, etc. Therefore, the emergency {{planning and}} preparedness are vital to the dyeing factory because when an emergency does occur, a quick and correct response is necessary to reduce injuries, illness, property damage, environment harm and public concern. Management should identify the types of emergencies the dyeing factory needs to plan, organise, practise and prepare for. A good emergency planning and preparedness could introduce the following:• Fewer claims, resulting in lower insurance premiums;• Less absenteeism and sickness;• Fewer injury and damage accidents;• Better levels of health (both occupational and general);• Higher productivity and efficiency;• Better utilisation of plant and equipment because of less down time;• Higher levels of quality and product safety;• Better legislative compliance;• Higher employee morale and motivation;• Better cost control and reduction; and• Better enterprise image. It could be seen that emergency planning and preparedness means considerably more than providing a first-aid kit, stretcher, emergency shower and <b>eye-wash</b> <b>fountain,</b> or fire blanket. Instead, {{there should be a}} written plan of action for every facility detailing the actions to be taken when an emergency occurs. This ensures appropriate responses when facing extraordinary circumstances. The effectiveness of any of these plans usually is proportionate to the thoroughness and soundness of the planning effort. This paper will introduce the methods of emergency planning and preparedness to be implement in a dyeing factory. Institute of Textiles and ClothingRefereed conference pape...|$|E
