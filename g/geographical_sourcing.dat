40|$|International {{sourcing}} {{is growing}} in importance. As businesses {{around the world have}} become global, the intense competition drives cost cutting within purchasing. Rising up as the world’s number one sourcing market with its 1. 3 billion citizens in only a few decades; China is a success story. But as the Chinese now seeks the next generation of growth far away from low value added production many companies and the global production network will need to adjust. But which instruments and models will companies need to use to find the next low cost sourcing area? This thesis aims to develop a geographic sourcing area evaluation model {{to be used in the}} sourcing decision process. By building a model based upon existing literature and adding new aspects, the authors have tried to develop a comprehensive tool for sourcing evaluation. The study undertaken during the thesis indicates that the model is applicable for the textile and clothing industry. However, a suggestion for further research is to test the <b>geographical</b> <b>sourcing</b> area evaluation model on other industries...|$|E
40|$|Rennet is used {{in animal}} and human {{foodstuffs}} (including cheese and food supplements) and in medicinal products and for the manufacture of lactose. Rennet can be produced from animals, mostly calves and adult cattle, from plant materials and by genetic engineering. As rennet may be sourced from certain TSE-susceptible animal species (besides using biotechnological processes or certain plant sources), the SSC was invited to prepare a general opinion on the safety of rennet obtained from calves, adult cattle, small ruminants and pigs with regard to animal TSE risks and particularly BSE risks, including those resulting from the method of harvesting, risks from the epithelium, contamination with lymphoid tissues, contamination with feed, feed bans, risk from cross-contaminated feed, and <b>geographical</b> <b>sourcing.</b> The SSC asked the TSE/BSE ad hoc Group to prepare a scientific report on the subject, which could serve as input into the discussions when preparing its opinion. This report is attached. It served {{as the basis for}} the opinion hereafter, which considers only rennet produced from animals and particularly calves and adult cattle. OPINION In the opinion hereafter the Scientific Steering Committee assumes that animal rennet is derived from materials from animals that are fit for human consumption. A. RENNET FROM RUMINANTS The source of any TSE infectivity in rennet is from the abomasum, from TSE-infected feed within its lumen at the time of slaughter or from cross-contamination. The feed bans that are currently in place in the EU apply equally to bovines and small ruminants and should therefore exclude the presence of TSE-infected feed in the lumen at the time of slaughter. A number of TSE-risk reduction strategies are currently in use in abattoirs in the EU that reduce risks from cross-contamination and should eliminate them if properly enforced. With regard to the possible abomasum-related risk, the SSC considers...|$|E

40|$|Acacia tortilis is an {{important}} woody species in Sudan with regard to protection and production. Its distribution {{is limited to the}} northern, north-eastern and central Sudan. It tolerates salinity and drought stresses. The objective {{of this study is to}} investigate the tolerance of A. tortilis seedlings from two <b>geographical</b> <b>sources</b> to saline condition with regard to survival, mineral content and vegetative growth. Two <b>geographical</b> <b>sources</b> were selected as seed sources according to soil types (Rufaa and Port Sudan). The seeds were sown in silt loam soil on polyethylene bags and irrigated every two days. The irrigation water consists of five levels of salinity EC: (0. 4 as control, 4, 8, 12 and 16 dSm- 1) and survival, plant mineral content and vegetative growth were measured. The results showed that both sources can tolerate salinity but Port Sudan source had significantly higher survival percent, potassium content and growth values than Rufaa source. It was concluded that A. tortilis, from Port Sudan can be included in the Red Sea refforestation program.

Samples grouped according to their geographical region of origin appeared to contain distinctive impurities in certain cases (Elliot Lake and Bancroft, Ontario). The key impurities responsible for differentiating groups of samples from a particular geological deposit type were identified and the use of certain impurities as signatures of processing history is discussed.

Genetic diversity within and among population {{is an important factor}} for initiating breeding program. Aim in this study was to evaluate genetic structure of C. calothyrsus in Indonesia, to obtain {{a better understanding of the}} history of the distribution and efficiency of breeding strategy of this species. Leaf samples were collected in a seedling seed orchard plot from 10 populations. Six RAPD markers consisted of 34 loci were used to analyze genetic diversity and genetic structure. The results showed that genetic diversity was in low to moderate level (mean HE= 0. 321). The AMOVA analysis showed that genetic differentiation among <b>geographical</b> <b>sources</b> was significant, also among populations within <b>geographical</b> <b>sources</b> and among individual within populations as well. It was revealed that the 10 populations originated from only two ancestors. The limited number of ancestors resulted low to moderate genetic distances among populations (mean Da= 0. 070). In conclusion, C. calothyrsus has moderate genetic diversity within population and weak genetic structure among populations. Genetic diversity in population/individual level should be considered as a selection unit in the breeding strategies...|$|R
