The purpose of this extended essay is to determine whether the <b>duration</b> <b>of</b> cold <b>storage</b> applied affects the germination behavior of a certain type of seed. The hypothesis formed for the claimed research question “How does the <b>duration</b> <b>of</b> cold <b>storage</b> applied for 0, 2, 4, 6 and 8 weeks to five groups of scallion seeds affect their behavior of germination under same conditions?” is {{that there would be a}} significant increase in the number of germinated seeds and affect its efficiency as the <b>duration</b> <b>of</b> exposure increases. So as to support the hypothesis, scallion seeds were exposed to cold storage for 0, 2, 4, 6 and 8 weeks for five different test groups with the exact same conditions. The <b>duration</b> <b>of</b> cold <b>storage</b> was the independent variable. In order to observe the effect more easily, the seeds were let to germinate in a water bathe then stratified on sterilized soil. The results have showed that there was a significant mean difference between the number of germinated seeds in each test group when the <b>duration</b> <b>of</b> applied cold <b>storage</b> is changed.

50|$|Refrigerated {{storage of}} {{planting}} stock {{has been developed}} largely {{with the aim of}} overcoming problems experienced in using flushed planting stock. Storage provides a means of holding stock for use when fresh stock is either unavailable or at a stage of development that renders it unsuitable for planting. It also offers possibilities of manipulating the physiological condition of the stock. However, there are problems associated with storage, e.g., mold, cold injury, desiccation, and depletion of food reserves. The rate of deterioration depends very much on the physiological condition of the planting stock at the time of lifting, {{as well as on the}} storage environment and <b>duration</b> <b>of</b> <b>storage.</b> In attempts to devise safe schedules for spring-lifting of stock for frozen storage, Mullin (1978) used a base of 0 °C and accumulated daily maximum soil temperatures at 15 cm depth to calculate degree days (DD). He interpreted the evidence to mean that white spruce destined for frozen storage should have accumulated no more than 50 DD before being lifted. With regard to cool-stored, spring-lifted stock, the main ingredients for success are lifting before flushing has begun, prevention of desiccation, maintenance of a constant temperature within 1 or 2 degrees of freezing, minimization of mold by good temperature control and sanitation, avoidance of crushing and other mechanical damage, and avoidance of longer than necessary periods of storage.|$|E
40|$|The <b>duration</b> <b>of</b> <b>storage</b> of transfused {{red blood}} cells (RBC) has been {{associated}} with poor clinical outcomes in some studies. We sought to establish whether prolonged storage of transfused RBC in cancer patients influences overall survival (OS) or cancer recurrence.

Transfused RBC units were categorized as "new" if stored for less than 14 days, "intermediate" if stored between 14 and 28 days and "old" if stored for more than 28 days. Baseline characteristics between the comparative groups were compared by ANOVA test. Categorical variables and continuous variables were compared using Chi-squared and Wilcoxan rank-sum tests respectively. Overall survival was not associated with <b>duration</b> <b>of</b> <b>storage</b> of transfused RBC with a median survival of 1. 2, 1. 7, 1. 1 years for only new, intermediate and old RBC units respectively (p = 0. 36).

40|$|Objective: To assess embryo {{survival}} after vitrification of 2 PN oocytes {{and evaluate}} the impact <b>of</b> the <b>duration</b> <b>of</b> cold <b>storage</b> and patient age. Setting: Department of Obstetrics and Gynaecology, Division of Reproductive Endocrinology and Infertility, Schleswig-Holstein University, Campus Luebeck. Design: Retrospective study. Materials and methods: Cohort analysis of 576 thawing cycles after vitrification performed between 2004 and 2010. Results were used to construct a model to predict the embryo survival based on vitrification cycles. Data were categorized {{with respect to the}} <b>duration</b> <b>of</b> cold <b>storage,</b> number <b>of</b> 2 PN oocytes on each cryo-top, and patient age. Main outcome measures: The survival rate of 2 PN zygotes after thawing, implantation rate (IR) per transferred embryo, and clinical pregnancy rate (CPR). Results: In 576 thawed cycles, the survival rate of 1. 349 2 PN warmed zygotes was 89. 39 %. Similar results concerning the survival rates of the 2 PN oocytes after thawing for all age groups (40 years, 99. 9 %) were noted. A total of 1159 embryos were transferred, leading to an overall IR of 7. 72 % and a CPR of 16. 3 %. The CPR decreased with age, as follows: CPR 40 years, 5. 8 %.

40|$|Red mud can {{be derived}} from the {{processing}} of bauxite using different methods. The chemical and mineralogical composition of the combined Bayer Process and bauxite calcination red mud (BPBCRM) differs markedly from those of the pure Bayer Process red mud (PBPRM). In this study, red mud derived from a combined Bayer Process and bauxite calcination method was characterized. The results show that pH of the red mud decreased with increasing <b>duration</b> <b>of</b> <b>storage</b> time. Na dominated among the soluble cations, but the concentration of soluble Na decreased with increasing <b>duration</b> <b>of</b> <b>storage</b> time as a result of leaching. Cation exchange capacity also decreased with increasing <b>duration</b> <b>of</b> <b>storage</b> time, probably due to a decrease in pH causing a reduction in negatively charged sites on the red mud particles. Ca was the predominant exchangeable cation in the fresh red mud but the concentration of exchangeable Ca markedly decreased in the old red mud, which was dominated by exchangeable Na. The degree of crystallization and thermal stability of the red mud increased with increasing <b>duration</b> <b>of</b> <b>storage.</b> The acid neutralizing capacity of red mud obtained from this study was about 10 mol kg− 1, which is much greater than the reported values for the pure Bayer Process red mud.

It is conservatively estimated that the simultaneous removal rates of Cd, Zn and Cu by red mud are over 22, 250 mg kg− 1, 22, 500 mg kg− 1 and 25, 000 mg kg− 1, respectively. The affinity of these metals to the red mud was in the following decreasing order: Cu > Zn > Cd. In general, the fresh red mud retained more heavy metals than the old red mud did. ...|$|E

Four milking frequencies were studied in 6 dairy cows averaging 118 ± 22 dim: 2 milkings/d separated by 11 - and 13 -h intervals (2 M 11 - 13) or by 4 - and 20 -h (2 M 4 - 20) and 1 milking/d (1 M 24). The experimental trial was a double Latin square 3 × 3 with 2 wk periods. In post-experiment, milking frequency of 36 -h (1 M 36) was repeated twice. Compared with 2 M 11 - 13, 1 M 24 reduced milk and milk fat yields and increased fat content, without any effect {{on the size of}} MFG which agrees with previous research. 2 M 4 - 20 had no significant effect on milk fat yield and content but tended to increase the size of the MFG. Lipolysis, measured on morning milk, was weaker with 1 M 24. Milk fatty acid composition was not modified by milking frequency. When data were analyzed according to kinetics <b>of</b> milk <b>storage</b> <b>duration</b> (from 4 to 36 -h), the highest fat content and the largest diameters of MFG were obtained on milks from 4 - and 36 -h milking (respectively 62. 8 g/kg and 4. 15 µm and 57. 7 g/kg and 4. 09 µm). Such observations could have 2 origins: the richness in residual milk of the 4 -h milk and the coalescence of MFG related to the long storage duration in the 36 -h milk. Independently, for each <b>duration</b> <b>of</b> milk <b>storage,</b> there was a relationship between MFG size and fat yield (R 2 from 0. 31 to 0. 81).

For the UHT milk with 1. 6 % milk fat statistically significant (p < 0. 05) decrease of psychometric chroma b* occurs after 60 days, and for milk with 3. 2 % milk fat established on 45 th day <b>of</b> <b>storage...</b>|$|R
40|$|The {{stability}} of plasma glutathione peroxidase under different temperatures (4 degrees C vs. - 15 degrees C), various <b>durations</b> <b>of</b> <b>storage</b> (0, 1, 2, 3, 7, 14, 28 and 56 d), and storage {{under inert gas}} (nitrogen (N 2)) vs air is described. The glutathione peroxidase activity of swine plasma decreased consistently with storage at either 4 degrees C or - 15 degrees C 1 - 56 d after collection, and differed (P {{less than or equal}} to 0. 01) from the initial values. Storage under N 2 at - 15 degrees C slowed the rate of enzyme activity decrease but did not maintain the initial activity. For absolute measurements, it is suggested that swine plasma glutathione peroxidase activity be measured immediately after separation from the blood cells or be assayed within 24 h in plasma samples stored at - 15 degrees C with air space displaced by N 2. If relative treatment differences in enzyme activity are satisfactory, then assays can be conducted after controlled periods <b>of</b> <b>storage...</b>|$|R
40|$|The {{influence}} of Lactobacillus rhamnosus GG and Bifidobacterium animalis subsp. lactis BB 12 in cofermentation with traditional starters on metabolite formation in set yoghurt was evaluated. Microbial activity during fermentation and refrigerated storage was investigated by monitoring bacterial population dynamics, milk acidification and overall changes in yoghurt metabolite profiles. A complementary metabolomics approach using solid-phase microextraction-gas chromatography/mass spectrometry and 1 H {{nuclear magnetic resonance}} resulted {{in the identification of}} 37 volatile and 43 non-volatile metabolites, respectively. Results demonstrated that the two probiotic strains did not influence acidity and the key-aroma volatile metabolites of set yoghurt. However, a contribution by the presence of L. rhamnosus GG on the non-volatile metabolite profile of yoghurt was specifically noticed during storage. Multivariate analysis allowed yoghurts fermented by different starter combinations and different <b>durations</b> <b>of</b> <b>storage</b> to be differentiated according to their metabolite profiles. This provides new insights regarding the impact of probiotics on the metabolome of yoghurt...|$|R

40|$|The aim of {{the present}} paper is to present a {{prototype}} of a decision support model simulating the feed and vitamin supply during a year on a farm self-sufficient with feed. The model takes into account that the content of vitamin and minerals depends on choice of crops, conservation method, season, plant development at harvest, quality of the silage production, and <b>duration</b> <b>of</b> <b>storage</b> together with traditional optimizing of the feeding scheme...|$|E
40|$|BACKGROUND: Therapeutic {{storage of}} {{platelet}} concentrate is a challenging problem for Transfusion Medicine, so that {{many studies have}} been carried out with the aim of improving the <b>duration</b> <b>of</b> <b>storage</b> of platelet concentrates. Little attention, however, has been given to the most appropriate biochemical methods for evaluating the quality of the stored platelet concentrates. MATERIAL E METHODS: Platelet concentrates (n= 10) were saved under gentle stirring at 22 masculineC for a total period of 8 days. Glucose 0. 5...|$|E

Fifty-five percent imbibition was essential for germination and this capability was achieved by 12 weeks old seeds. With growing <b>duration</b> <b>of</b> dry <b>storage,</b> imbibition and germination increased, although germination declined on prolonged dry storage for over 36 weeks. A soil moisture of 50 % was essential and 100 % was optimal for germination. A correlation was found between imbibition and germination...|$|R
