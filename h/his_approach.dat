5|$|Book I {{serves as}} Pliny's preface, {{explaining}} <b>his</b> <b>approach</b> {{and providing a}} table of contents.|$|E
5|$|Etty {{felt that}} <b>his</b> <b>approach</b> {{to the work}} {{illustrated}} a moral warning about the pursuit of pleasure, but <b>his</b> <b>approach</b> was not entirely successful. The Bard was about a supposed curse on the House of Plantagenet placed by a Welsh bard following Edward I of England's attempts to eradicate Welsh culture, and critics felt that Etty had somewhat misunderstood the point of Gray's poem. Some reviewers greatly praised the piece, and in particular Etty's technical abilities, but audiences of the time {{found it hard to}} understand the purpose of Etty's painting, and his use of nude figures led some critics to consider the work tasteless and offensive.|$|E
5|$|Grissom {{is often}} {{regarded}} as well-educated, but unusual in <b>his</b> <b>approach</b> toward {{his work and}} social life. In the series, some of his comments and actions {{can be seen to}} dumbfound his co-workers and superiors. His relationship with his subordinates in the office is portrayed as being a father figure to the team, but very professional in his work.|$|E
50|$|St. Deacon Lawrence hears of <b>his</b> <b>approaching</b> {{death from}} St. Pope Sixtus.|$|R
60|$|They {{caught the}} sound of <b>his</b> <b>approaching</b> step. He entered, sat down, and began to talk.|$|R
60|$|Dalgetty {{once more}} grinned intelligence, and withdrew to victual his charger and himself, for the {{fatigues}} of <b>his</b> <b>approaching</b> mission.|$|R
5|$|Marking Specter's {{entire career}} in the Senate and, indeed, in all his public offices was one {{overriding}} fact: First and foremost, he considered himself essentially a trial attorney rather than a professional politician. During his tenures on Senate committees, <b>his</b> <b>approach</b> to their hearings was very similar to courtroom examinations of trial witnesses.|$|E
5|$|Of {{the many}} {{decisions}} made by Captain Boutelle in managing the park, <b>his</b> <b>approach</b> to fisheries had significant and lasting impact. Boutelle was an avid angler and recognized the angling potential in Yellowstone waters. In 1889 he suggested the U.S. Fish Commission consider stocking many of the fish-less lakes and streams in Yellowstone.|$|E
5|$|Spoilt Rotten {{received}} a mostly favourable reception in the media. Dalrymple was praised {{for carrying out}} a thought-provoking and convincing analysis of a newly emerged cultural phenomenon which sees emotion substituted for reason. Some critics, however, accused the author of cynicism and misanthropic pessimism in <b>his</b> <b>approach,</b> and the historian Noel Malcolm claimed that Dalrymple had overreached in his analysis.|$|E
50|$|Chapter 6, A Fortuitous Encounter, {{describes}} Donahue's first {{correspondence with}} the Secret Service, and reviews the conclusions {{that led to}} <b>his</b> <b>approaching</b> them.|$|R
60|$|Monty turned {{round at}} the sound of <b>his</b> <b>approaching</b> footsteps. The two men stood face to face. Trent looked eagerly for some sign of recognition--none came.|$|R
50|$|In September 2013 Hamilton {{began writing}} a book based on <b>his</b> <b>approaching</b> 35 years in radio and the {{evolution}} of the broadcast industry since he began in 1979.|$|R
5|$|After Si Ronda, Lie and Tan {{collaborated on}} three further films. Lie left Tan's in 1932, {{reportedly}} as <b>his</b> <b>approach</b> no longer matched Tan's low-class target audience and caused the works {{to go over}} budget. Effendi continued to work with Tan's until 1932, when he left to head the cinema magazine Doenia Film. Momo continued acting until 1941, first with Tan's and later with Standard Film. The film is likely lost. The American visual anthropologist Karl G. Heider writes that all Indonesian films from before 1950 are lost. However, JB Kristanto's Katalog Film Indonesia (Indonesian Film Catalogue) records several as having survived at Sinematek Indonesia's archives.|$|E
5|$|After this success, he {{was sent}} to Asia Minor, where the Turkish raids on the Byzantine borderlands had become a menace, and where Turkish {{settlers}} had begun encroaching upon imperial territory. He remained there until 1267 and achieved some success, securing the lands around the valley of the Maeander River and restoring the defences of the region. The historian George Pachymeres certainly praised his conduct of these operations, and alleged that the mere mention of <b>his</b> <b>approach</b> caused fear to his enemies.|$|E
5|$|Although {{he was a}} {{newcomer}} to the Castro District, Milk had shown leadership in the small community. He was starting {{to be taken seriously}} as a candidate and decided to run again for supervisor in 1975. He reconsidered <b>his</b> <b>approach</b> and cut his long hair, swore off marijuana, and vowed never to visit another gay bathhouse again. Milk's campaigning earned the support of the teamsters, firefighters, and construction unions. Castro Camera became the center of activity in the neighborhood. Milk would often pull people off the street to work his campaigns for him—many discovered later that they just happened to be the type of men Milk found attractive.|$|E
6000|$|Kenneth shuddered. Crispin's words {{reminded}} him again of <b>his</b> <b>approaching</b> end. The ruffler paused a moment, as if awaiting a reply or {{a word of}} encouragement. Then, as none came, he continued: ...|$|R
6000|$|He appeared, for the moment, to {{be quite}} {{overwhelmed}} and stupefied {{by the prospect of}} <b>his</b> <b>approaching</b> happiness; but recovering, entered the shop. He returned immediately, saying in a tone of despair ...|$|R
6000|$|... "You don't {{look me in}} the face, old lady!" [...] quoth Tom to himself. [...] "Very well! {{between you}} two it lies; unless that old gentleman implicates himself also, in <b>his</b> <b>approaching</b> confession." ...|$|R
5|$|Before {{the war he}} was put {{in charge}} of {{analyzing}} technical advances at home and abroad and his enthusiasm for innovation earned him the nickname Armee Modernissimus ("the army modernization fanatic"). Model fought nearly all his battles in the northern and central parts of the Eastern Front; he was never tested on the steppes of southern Russia, where the open terrain would have made mobile warfare a more attractive proposition. Nevertheless, his defensive record indicated the value of <b>his</b> <b>approach.</b> At Rzhev, Orel, in Galicia and in Estonia he stymied opponents who expected to overwhelm him, and as late as November 1944, he gave the U.S. 12th Army Group a bloody nose in the Battle of Hürtgen Forest.|$|E
5|$|Bo's {{stint as}} Minister of Commerce {{significantly}} raised his international profile and generated media attention both in China and abroad. Described as good-looking, articulate and open-minded in <b>his</b> <b>approach</b> to problems, Bo's rise from a municipal official {{to the central}} government generated great media fanfare and elevated his status to something of a 'political star.' Bo's political persona was considered {{a departure from the}} generally serious and conservative leadership in Beijing. With his youthful vigour, populism, and purported popularity with female reporters, Bo's political rise had been compared to that of John F. Kennedy.|$|E
5|$|British {{military}} leadership, {{which had}} been decisive up to Brock's death, suffered a blow with his loss. His direct successor, Major-General Sheaffe, although successful in <b>his</b> <b>approach</b> at Queenston Heights, {{was never able to}} live up to Brock's reputation. He was criticised by many, including John Strachan, for his retreat at the Battle of York, and was shortly after recalled to England, where he continued a successful, if not brilliant, military career.|$|E
60|$|As Dick had foretold {{would be}} the case, Mark {{received}} a very warm letter from Sir Charles Harris, congratulating him upon <b>his</b> <b>approaching</b> marriage, and insisting upon his taking up his quarters with him.|$|R
60|$|Pronouncing {{these words}} {{with an easy}} and benevolent smile, and looking round complacently on the display of luxurious {{confusion}} about him, Vetranio retired to the bath that was to prepare him for <b>his</b> <b>approaching</b> triumph.|$|R
60|$|He held her, stooped down, {{and their}} lips met. Then she stood apart from him. Her eyes were {{for a moment}} closed, her hands were {{extended}} as though to prevent any chance of <b>his</b> <b>approaching</b> her again.|$|R
5|$|C. L. R. James {{believes}} that St Hill planned to play professional cricket in England around this point, but his {{failure in the}} trial matches meant {{that he was not}} selected to tour England with the West Indies team in 1923. James records how upset St Hill's supporters were by his omission and they believed the West Indian selectors feared a black batsman being successful in England. He also describes St Hill became more single-minded and less willing to moderate <b>his</b> <b>approach</b> after this decision.|$|E
5|$|Christopher Douglas {{argues that}} Jardine liked {{to make his}} runs when his side was in {{difficulty}} and enjoyed being tested; <b>his</b> <b>approach</b> would often lead his team to recovery from an unfavourable situation. Douglas comments that Jardine held {{his place in the}} England side despite strong competition from other batsmen. His defensive technique rescued England from weak positions in around a dozen innings and only played in two losses with England (which were his two least successful games with the bat). He also excelled in the main Gentlemen v Players fixture at Lord's, making a good score in each of his appearances in this match. Jack Hobbs classed him as a great batsman and believed that he was under-rated by his contemporaries.|$|E
5|$|For {{his work}} in Basutoland, Clarke drew praise from the {{economist}} John A. Hobson in his treatise Imperialism for his devotion to the education {{and development of the}} native people, while Viscount Bryce noted that <b>his</b> <b>approach</b> fostered goodwill amongst native people towards Britain. In Zululand, Clarke granted considerable authority and special judicial functions to the hereditary chiefs; and was commended by Sir Walter Hely-Hutchinson, Governor of Natal, for his action in the face of potential famine. He recommended to the Imperial Government the return from exile of Dinuzulu, the paramount chief. While in Southern Rhodesia, he was appointed to protect the interests of native people against the overarching ambitions of the British South Africa Company.|$|E
60|$|The various guises {{under which}} Ruin makes <b>his</b> <b>approaches</b> to <b>his</b> victims: to the {{merchant}}, {{in the guise}} of a merchant offering speculations; to the young heir, a jolly companion; to the maiden, a sighing, sentimentalist lover.|$|R
50|$|Curly is out practising for <b>his</b> <b>approaching</b> driving test. Dazzled by sunlight, {{he loses}} concentration, {{sparking}} an outburst of road-rage from an impatient driver behind him. Shaken, he rests at home but the incident brings back memories of Changi.|$|R
6000|$|On <b>his</b> <b>approaching</b> them soon afterwards, though {{without seeming}} to have any {{intention}} of speaking, Miss Lucas defied her friend to mention such a subject to him; which immediately provoking Elizabeth to do it, {{she turned to him}} and said: ...|$|R
5|$|He {{attended}} Yale University, but by his {{own account}} had problems adjusting to the college, and failed out twice. Among the influential teachers from his days in New Haven was Professor H. Bradford Westerfield, whom Cheney repeatedly credited with having helped to shape <b>his</b> <b>approach</b> to foreign policy. He later attended the University of Wyoming, where he earned both a Bachelor of Arts and a Master of Arts in political science. He subsequently started, but did not finish, doctoral studies at the University of Wisconsin–Madison.|$|E
5|$|He was {{preoccupied with}} his own security, {{regularly}} changing where he slept and sometimes grounding all other planes in Libya when he was flying. He made particular requests when traveling to foreign nations. During his trips to Rome, Paris, Madrid, Moscow, and New York City, he resided in a bulletproof tent, following his Bedouin traditions. Gaddafi was notably confrontational in <b>his</b> <b>approach</b> to foreign powers, and generally shunned Western ambassadors and diplomats, believing them to be spies.|$|E
5|$|Henry {{undertook}} {{a wave of}} castle-building during his visit in 1171 to protect his new territories—the Anglo-Normans had superior military technologies to the Irish, and castles gave them a significant advantage. Henry hoped for a longer term political solution, however, similar to <b>his</b> <b>approach</b> in Wales and Scotland, and in 1175 he agreed to the Treaty of Windsor, under which Rory O'Connor would be recognised as the high king of Ireland, giving homage to Henry and maintaining stability on the ground on his behalf. This policy proved unsuccessful, as O'Connor was unable to exert sufficient influence and force {{in areas such as}} Munster: Henry instead intervened more directly, establishing a system of local fiefs of his own through a conference held in Oxford in 1177.|$|E
6000|$|... "And the Crown Prince, Mr. Sievers, {{how does}} he conduct himself at this {{interesting}} moment? or is his mind so completely engrossed by the anticipation of his Imperial alliance {{that he has no}} thought for anything but <b>his</b> <b>approaching</b> bride." ...|$|R
60|$|To {{the best}} of my {{knowledge}} and observation, he was, of all the men that ever I knew, one of the most modest, and the most easily to be discountenanced in <b>his</b> <b>approaches</b> either to <b>his</b> superiors or his equals.|$|R
60|$|After this {{campaign}} Bradley {{went back to}} his studies at the seminary and to his work in Brown's office. Milton did not go back. Deering made him his assistant in the treasurer's office, and he confided to Bradley <b>his</b> <b>approaching</b> marriage with Eileen.|$|R
