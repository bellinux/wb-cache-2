5|$|Compared {{to former}} Russian armies, Shein's army was {{significantly}} modernised. Dissatisfied with their traditional formations of musket-equipped infantry (the streltsy), the Russians looked to foreign officers {{to update the}} equipment and training of their troops based on the Western <b>European</b> <b>model</b> of regulars, dragoons, and reiters. Eight such regiments, totaling 14,000 to 17,000 men, comprised a part of Shein's army.|$|E
5|$|Into modern times, {{his legacy}} has {{remained}} {{more pronounced in}} Ireland and Scotland than in his native Norway. Among the few domestic developments known during his reign, Norway developed a more centralised rule and {{moved closer to the}} <b>European</b> <b>model</b> of church organisation. Popularly portrayed as a Viking warrior rather than a medieval monarch, Magnus was the last Norwegian king to fall in battle abroad, and he may in some respects be considered the final Viking king.|$|E
5|$|Former Polish {{estimates}} {{of the size of}} the Russian forces varied from 25,000 through 30,000 to 34,500, with 160 artillery pieces. Recent research on 17th-century Russian archive documents showed that the size of the Russian army was 23,961. Compared to former Russian armies, Shein's army was significantly modernised.

5|$|His {{expenditures}} {{in trying to}} remold Hawaii's monarchy into the <b>European</b> <b>model</b> added to the public debt, helping to increase the kingdom's expenditures on the monarchy by 50%. Kalākaua decided to have the coronation he had previously been denied due to the political climate when he was elected. On the 1883 anniversary of his 9th year in office, an elaborate public coronation ceremony was held at expenses exceeding $50,000. Kalākaua crowned himself. In 1886, Kalākaua's two-week 50th birthday Jubilee added more expense, reported by Harper's Weekly to be $75,000.|$|E

25|$|The arches used in Portuguese Romanesque {{buildings}} {{follow the}} basic <b>European</b> <b>model</b> and are nearly always semicircular, for openings such as doors and windows, for vaults and for arcades. Wide doorways are usually surmounted by a semi-circular arch, except where a {{door with a}} lintel is set into a large arched recess and surmounted by a semi-circular lunette with decorative carving. These doors sometimes have a carved central jamb.|$|E
25|$|During 1935, Turkey was {{becoming}} an industrial society on the Western <b>European</b> <b>model</b> set out by Atatürk. At {{the time of}} his death, most regions of Turkey had viable micro-economic stability and some macro economic stability. These signs of sound economic policies were marked by the first-ever emergence of local banks. However, the gap between Mustafa Kemal’s goals and the achievements of the socio-political structure of the country was not closed.|$|E

25|$|As Joseph E. Inikori argues, {{the history}} of the region shows that the effects were still quite deleterious. He argues that the African {{economic}} model of the period was very different from the <b>European</b> <b>model,</b> and could not sustain such population losses. Population reductions in certain areas also led to widespread problems. Inikori also notes that after the suppression of the slave trade Africa's population almost immediately began to rapidly increase, even prior to the introduction of modern medicines.|$|E

The BSA 1926 was manufactured in 9mmP and 7.63mm Mauser and were tested by various governments, including France, in the mid-1920s.

25|$|The Spanish {{arrived here}} in 1528, killing the local Aztec governor, Ixcóatl. Credit for the Spanish {{conquest of the}} Pachuca area has been given Francisco Téllez, an artilleryman who came to Mexico with Hernán Cortés in 1519. He and Gonzalo Rodriguez were the first Spaniards here, {{constructing}} two feudal estates, and calling the area Real de Minas de Pachuca. Téllez was also given credit for laying out the colonial city of Pachuca on the <b>European</b> <b>model</b> but this story has been proven false, with no alternative version.|$|E
25|$|According to {{architectural}} historian Neil Larson, {{the house}} represents {{the culmination of}} Ulster County's traditional stone houses. Originally built on a <b>European</b> <b>model</b> for urban areas, they had been small rectangles similar to the Jean Hasbrouck House and the other older Huguenot Street homes, sometimes with their sides facing the street as in that neighborhood's Bevier House. As {{the children of the}} Duzine moved out into the surrounding lands, the houses evolved into farmhouses with a three-room plan, since builders could take advantage of larger lots. Using this form may have been a conscious choice on Major Hasbrouck's part to preserve his ancestral culture, since some of his contemporaries later built themselves homes in more English-influenced styles like Josiah Hasbrouck's Locust Lawn.|$|E
25|$|Early 1980-1985 models {{featured}} butterfly opening windows, round side indicators, only {{a single}} set of tail lights {{on each side of}} the car, no rear defroster, and usually a black interior with a black dashboard, and many metal trim pieces such as window crank handles and door handles. Since around 1985, the cars received more comfortable seating, a blue or brown dashboard, two-part tail lights on each side, square side signals, rear defroster, redesigned instrument cluster, and butterfly windows that did not open. In 1990, a fuel filler flap was added instead of a twist cap, and some minor interior and instrument cluster changes were implemented. In 1991, the dashboard was redesigned first for the Yugo GVX and then for the <b>European</b> <b>model,</b> side butterfly windows were removed, and a bigger tank was introduced. In 2000, the car received a new front fascia with new bumpers, rear spoiler, a redesigned dashboard, and seats. The latest changes were in 2007, with the introduction of a new instrument cluster.|$|E
