5|$|During {{the second}} season of Millionaire in the United States, the show crowned its first million-dollar winner. On November 19, 1999, John Carpenter won the show's top prize without using any lifelines, save for a phone call on the <b>final</b> <b>question</b> to tell his father {{he was going to}} win the million dollars. After Carpenter {{answered}} the <b>final</b> <b>question,</b> which concerned Richard Nixon's appearance on Laugh-In in 1968, host Regis Philbin proclaimed Carpenter the show's (and worldwide format's) first top prize winner.|$|E
5|$|In January 2001, when no {{contestant}} had won $1 {{million in}} any show that aired {{over a period}} of five months, the top prize was then changed from a flat $1 million to an accumulating jackpot that increased by $10,000 for each episode where the top prize was not won. On April 10, 2001, Kevin Olmstead correctly answered the <b>final</b> <b>question</b> and won $2,180,000, making him the biggest winner in television history at the time. The top prize for correctly answering the <b>final</b> <b>question</b> returned to $1 million following Olmstead's win and has remained unchanged since; just five days after Olmstead's win, the standard $1 million prize was awarded to Bernie Cullen. The last top prize winner on the original network version was Ed Toutant, on the episode aired September 7, 2001; he had previously appeared on the episode aired January 31, 2001 when the jackpot was $1,860,000, where he was ruled to have answered his $16,000 question incorrectly, but when it was discovered that there was a mistake in that question, Toutant was invited back and won the $1,860,000 jackpot. On the Super Millionaire spin-off, Robert Essig won $1,000,000 after answering the twelfth question and then walked away, not reaching the <b>final</b> <b>question</b> for $10,000,000.|$|E
5|$|The tournament {{began on}} the episode aired November 9, 2009, and playing in order from the lowest to the highest seed, tournament contestants played {{one at a time}} {{at the end of that}} episode and the next nine. The rules were exactly the same as they were for a normal million dollar {{question}} under the clock format introduced the season before, except here, the contestants had no lifelines at their disposal. Each contestant received a base time of 45 seconds. For each question they had answered before walking away, the contestants received any unused seconds that were left when they gave their answers. The accumulated total of those unused seconds was then added to the base time to give the contestants their <b>final</b> <b>question</b> time limit.|$|E

25|$|Out of all contestants {{that have}} played the game, few {{have been able to}} win the top prize on any {{international}} version of the show. The first was John Carpenter, who won the top prize on the U.S. version on 19 November 1999. Carpenter did not use a lifeline until the <b>final</b> <b>question,</b> using his Phone-a-Friend not for help but to call his father to tell him he had won the million.|$|E

25|$|In {{the second}} round, the contestants {{attempted}} {{to match the}} celebrities whom they had not matched in the first round. On the CBS version, the challenger always began the second round (unless that contestant had matched all six stars; in this situation, the champion selected from the two questions available). This meant that a champion who had only answered one question could be ahead of a challenger who had played both questions, rendering the <b>final</b> <b>question</b> moot. On the syndicated versions, the leader after a round played first in the next round. In case of a tie score, the contestant who had not selected their own question in the previous round made the selection in the tie-breaker round.|$|E
25|$|The {{first two}} members of each family {{appeared}} at the face-off podium and were asked a question to which only the number-one answer was available. Giving the top answer added the value for that question to the family's bank. The process then repeated with the four remaining members from each family. On {{the first half of}} the daytime version, families were staked with $2,500. The first question was worth $500, with each succeeding question worth $500 more than the previous, with the <b>final</b> <b>question</b> worth $2,500. This allowed for a potential maximum bank of $10,000. For the second half of the daytime version, and also on the syndicated version, all values were doubled, making the maximum potential bank $20,000. The team that eventually won the game played for their bank in Fast Money.|$|E
25|$|If {{the contestants}} {{had the same}} score {{at the end of}} the game, the scores were reset and the contestants played one tiebreaker {{question}} each, again attempting to match all six celebrities. On Match Game PM, or on the syndicated daytime show if time was running short, a time-saving variant of the tie-breaker was used that reversed the game play. The contestants wrote their answers first on a card in secret, then the celebrities were canvassed to give their answers verbally. Originally, this included regulars Somers, Reilly and Dawson only, but when Dawson left the show, the canvass was expanded to include all six panelists in the usual order. The first celebrity response to match a contestant's answer gave that contestant the victory. If there was still no match, which was rare, the round was replayed with a new question. On the CBS version, the tie-breaker went on until there was a clear winner. If it came to the sudden-death tie-breaker, only the <b>final</b> <b>question</b> (the one that ultimately broke the tie) was kept and aired.|$|E
50|$|There {{are five}} <b>final</b> <b>questions</b> {{that the team}} must answer.

500|$|The <b>final</b> <b>question</b> {{before the}} Court {{was whether the}} District Court rightly {{exercised}} ancillary jurisdiction over the counties' cross-claim against the state for indemnification. The Court rejected, as having [...] "no basis in law," [...] the Second Circuit's theory that [...] "by violating a federal statute, the State consented to suit in federal court by any party on any claim, state or federal, growing {{out of the same}} nucleus of operative facts as the statutory violation." [...] Although the counties' cross-claim would meet the traditional criteria for ancillary jurisdiction, the Court found those criteria foreclosed by the Eleventh Amendment.|$|E

Carell and Ryan also made up the Jaws song parody ("Dunder...Dunder...") while filming, and Carell made up the subsequent line [...] "We're circling it" [...] about their good sketch idea. The extras were told not to laugh or react at all to the [...] "SlumDunder Mifflinaire" [...] sketch, but Carell and Ryan were not told of those instructions {{in order to create a}} genuine stage fright awkwardness among the two actors; Ryan in particular was thrown off guard by their lack of response.|$|E

40|$|Nowadays, {{examination}} {{is one of}} {{the important}} process in education. It is either done orally, in the form of written paper and practiced-based examination as well as participating in a course work. The rapid and constant paces of technology changing are creating both opportunities and challenges for schools and higher education community such as the universities. One of the challenges is the leakage of question papers before the final examination being conducted. The quality of the education system and the achievement of its objective are exposed to a serious threat with actions and practices that weaken the credibility of examination. In some countries, a centralized examination system is used and most education community does not realize the occurrence of <b>final</b> examination <b>question</b> paper leakage. It can affects the candidates in the whole country where the exam can be postponed or cancelled due to the leakage of question papers. The government are losing {{a lot of money to}} replace the leaked <b>final</b> examination <b>question</b> papers. The confidentiality of the question papers must be strictly maintained. Thus, this project emphasize strongly on developing a desktop based application that can hide <b>final</b> examination <b>question</b> paper in a digital bitmap cover image by using Image Steganography technique intended for the use of lecturer during the preparation of <b>final</b> examination <b>question</b> paper. This project focus on the Least Significant Bit algorithm in Image Steganography while providing a practical understanding of what Steganography is and how to accomplish it.

500|$|The {{development}} {{begins with}} the piano repeating its entry to the solo exposition, {{this time in the}} relative major of E-flat. The Concerto No. 20 is the only other of Mozart's concertos in which the solo exposition and the development commence with the same material. In the Concerto No. 24, the material unfolds in the development in a manner different from the solo exposition: the opening solo motif, with its half cadence, is repeated four times, with one intervention from the woodwinds, as if asking question after question. The <b>final</b> <b>question</b> is asked in C minor, and is answered by a descending scale from the piano that leads to an orchestral statement, in F minor, of the movement's principal theme. The orchestral theme is then developed: the motif of the theme's fourth and fifth measures descends through the circle of fifths, accompanied by an elaborate piano figuration. After this, the development proceeds to a stormy exchange between the piano and the orchestra, which the twentieth-century Mozart scholar Cuthbert Girdlestone describes as [...] "one of the few [...] in Mozart where passion seems really unchained", and which Tovey describes as a passage of [...] "fine, severe massiveness". The exchange resolves to a passage in which the piano plays a treble line of sixteenth notes, over which the winds add echoes of the main theme. This transitional passage ultimately modulates to the home key of C minor, bringing about the start of the recapitulation with the conventional re-statement, by the orchestra, of the movement's principal theme.|$|E
