5|$|As {{well as his}} {{chancery}} duties, Neville occasionally {{sat with}} the barons of the exchequer or with royal justices, {{and he had a}} role in the appointment of royal justices. In 1230 he was regent of England while Henry was absent in France, during which time he met with Llywelyn the <b>Great</b> <b>in</b> an unsuccessful attempt to negotiate an agreement that would resolve the disputes between the English and the Welsh. In 1232, during the events surrounding the de Burgh's downfall Neville, along with Ranulf, the Earl of Chester, urged that de Burgh should not be dragged from sanctuary to face the royal accusations against him. Neville's pleas prevailed for a time, but eventually de Burgh was removed from sanctuary.|$|E
5|$|At {{some point}} between {{the death of}} Cnut the <b>Great</b> <b>in</b> 1035 {{and the death of}} Edward the Confessor in early 1066, the {{independent}} Kingdom of Cornwall was annexed by the neighbouring Kingdom of Wessex, a part of the Kingdom of England. In late 1066 Cornwall, {{along with the rest of}} the lands under the control of the English king, was conquered by the Normans and came under the control of William the Conqueror. By the late 12thcentury the metal mines were brought under the control of the Crown; operation of the tin mines was devolved to the Lord Warden of the Stannaries, and mining of other metals was directly controlled by the Crown as Mines Royal.|$|E
5|$|Castell y Bere is a Welsh castle near Llanfihangel-y-pennant in Gwynedd, Wales. Constructed by Llywelyn the <b>Great</b> <b>in</b> the 1220s, {{the stone}} castle was {{intended}} to maintain his authority over the local people and to defend the south-west part of the princedom of Gwynedd. In 1282 war with Edward I of England resulted {{in the death of}} Llywelyn's grandson, Llywelyn ap Gruffudd, and Castell y Bere fell to English forces. Edward I expanded the castle further and established a small town beside it. In 1294 the Welsh leader Madoc ap Llywelyn mounted a major revolt and the castle was besieged and apparently burnt. Edward did not repair it and it became ruined. Today it {{is in the hands of}} Cadw and operated as a tourist attraction.|$|E

5|$|Class {{differences}} were not as <b>great</b> <b>in</b> the Vendée as in Paris or in other French provinces. In the rural Vendée, the local nobility {{seems to have been}} more permanently in residence and less bitterly resented than in other parts of France. Alexis de Tocqueville noted that most French nobles lived in cities by 1789. An Intendants' survey showed one of the few areas where they still lived with the peasants was the Vendée. Consequently, the conflicts that drove the revolution in Paris, for example, were also lessened in this particularly isolated part of France by the strong adherence of the populace to their Catholic faith.|$|E

40|$|Two {{experiments}} {{were conducted to}} evaluate fermented fish meal as a new animal protein source on N balance, Apparent Total Tract (ATTD) and ileal AA Digestibility (AID) in weanling pigs. In Exp. 1 : total 40 [(LandracexYorkshire) xDuroc] barrows were randomly allocated 4 treatments (10 pigs per treatment) for a 12 days metabolic trial. The dietary treatments of Exp. 1 and 2 were SFM (small fish), LFM (small fish fermented with L. acidophilus), AMFM (Anchovy-Mackerel Fish Meal, LT ®) and MFM (Mackerel Fish Meal, BIO-CP ®).

John de Braose acquired the castle in 1220 and repaired it, constructing a stone curtain wall to replace the older defences.

5|$|Russia {{had made}} a {{previous}} attempt to capture Viborg; in October 1706, a siege corps was sent there {{under the command of}} Robert (Roman) Bruce. On 22 October, mortars were placed and the bombardment began, which continued for four days and caused five fires in the fort at Viborg. After the bombardment, Russian forces retreated to Saint Petersburg after commanders realized that a siege could not be carried out without naval support and larger cannon. Also, autumn was not considered a suitable time for siege operations. The idea to reattempt a capture of Viborg was first proposed by Peter the <b>Great</b> <b>in</b> 1708, but rejected by the military due to the recent Swedish offensive.|$|E

40|$|Nonalcoholic {{steatohepatitis}} (NASH) {{is typically}} associated with pro-apoptotic caspase activation. A potential role for pro-inflammatory caspases remains incompletely understood. Our aims were to examine a potential role of caspase 1 {{in the development of}} liver damage and fibrosis in NASH. C 57 BL/ 6 wild-type (WT), developed marked steatohepatitis, HSC activation, fibrosis, and increased hepatic caspase 1 and IL- 1 β expression when placed on the methioninecholine deficient (MCD) diet. Marked caspase 1 activation was detected in the liver of MCD-fed mice. Hepatocyte and non-parenchymal fractionation of the livers further demonstrated that caspase 1 activation after MCD feeding was mainly localized to non-parenchymal cells. Caspase 1 -knockout (Casp 1 −/−) mice on the MCD diet showed marked reduction in mRNA expression of genes involved in inflammation and fibrogenesis (TNFα was 7. 6 -fold <b>greater</b> <b>in</b> WT vs. Casp 1 −/−MCD-fed mice; F 4 / 80 was 1. 5 -fold <b>greater</b> <b>in</b> WT vs. Casp 1 −/ − MCD-fed mice; α-SMA was 3. 2 -fold <b>greater</b> <b>in</b> WT vs. Casp 1 −/ − MCD-fed mice; Collagen 1 -alpha was 7. 6 –fold <b>greater</b> <b>in</b> WT vs. Casp 1 −/ − MCD-fed mice; TGFβ was 2. 4 -fold <b>greater</b> <b>in</b> WT vs. Casp 1 −/ − MCD-fed mice; CRP 2 was 3. 2 -fold <b>greater</b> <b>in</b> WT vs. Casp 1 −/ − MCD-fed mice).

40|$|Graduation date: 1968 Chironomidae {{occurring}} in stabilization lagoons were studied from 1964 to 1966 in Oregon. Observations of other insects {{and their impact}} on the lagoon environment are included. Quantitative data were obtained from two lagoons near Corvallis and qualitative observations from preliminary work on two other lagoons are reported. The objectives of this investigation were to determine (1) species composition and abundance of Chironomidae {{occurring in}} lagoons; (2) the microdistribution of dominant larval species; (3) rates of adult midge emergence from lagoons; (4) larval tolerance to some physical and chemical stress factors occurring in lagoons, and (5) future areas of research. Ecological conditions in one lagoon were complicated by changes in amount of sewage loading, and by the reversal of loading sequence from primary to secondary cell. A total of 11 species of Chironomidae, including six species new to science, were recovered from two lagoons. Significant differences in larval abundance showed the following order of dominance: Glyptotendipes barbipes (Staeger) > Chironomus riparius Townes > Anatopynia dyari (Coquillett). The order of tolerance to physiochemical stress factors was G. barbipes > A. dyari > C. riparius. The established dominance order in lagoons was thought to be because larval A. dyari required more space for growth and development than did the tube dwelling species. Statistical analysis of dredging results of one lagoon showed that total larval abundance was <b>greater</b> <b>in</b> winter, <b>greater</b> <b>in</b> the primary cell, and consistently <b>greater</b> <b>in</b> peripheral zones. Larval abundance of G. barbipes was <b>greater</b> <b>in</b> winter, <b>greater</b> <b>in</b> the primary cell, and <b>greater</b> <b>in</b> the peripheral zones. Larval abundance of A. dyari and C. riparius was <b>greater</b> <b>in</b> the summer, <b>greater</b> <b>in</b> the secondary cell, and <b>greater</b> <b>in</b> the peripheral zones. The main factors affecting these differences are considered to be: sewage influent quality and quantity, depth of water, degree of peripheral slope, and duration and degree of dissolved oxygen stratification. Thus the microdistribution and abundance of chironmid larvae in stabilization lagoons can be explained in terms of the selective effect of the environment acting upon the limits of tolerance of the larvae...|$|R
