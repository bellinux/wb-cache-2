40|$|Essentially any {{behavior}} in simple and complex animals depends on neuronal network function. Currently, the best-defined system to study neuronal circuits is the nematode Caenorhabditis elegans, as the connectivity of its 302 neurons is exactly known. Individual neurons can be activated by photostimulation of Channelrhodopsin- 2 (ChR 2) using blue light, allowing to directly probe {{the importance of}} a particular neuron for the respective behavioral output of the network under study. In analogy, other excitable cells can be inhibited by expressing Halorhodopsin from Natronomonas pharaonis (NpHR) and subsequent illumination with yellow light. However, inhibiting C. elegans neurons using NpHR is difficult. Recently, proton pumps from various sources were established as valuable alternative hyperpolarizers. Here we show that archaerhodopsin- 3 (Arch) from Halorubrum sodomense and a proton pump from the fungus Leptosphaeria maculans (Mac) can be utilized to effectively inhibit excitable cells in C. elegans. Arch is the most powerful hyperpolarizer when illuminated with yellow or green light while the action spectrum of Mac is more blue-shifted, as analyzed by light-evoked behaviors and electrophysiology. This allows these tools to be combined in various ways with ChR 2 to analyze different subsets of neurons within a circuit. We exemplify this by means of the polymodal aversive sensory ASH neurons, and the downstream command interneurons to which ASH neurons signal to trigger a reversal followed by a directional turn. Photostimulating ASH and subsequently <b>inhibiting</b> <b>command</b> interneurons using two-color illumination of different body segments, allow...|$|R

40|$|Control {{systems for}} modern High-Energy Physics (HEP) {{detectors}} are large distributed software systems managing a signicant data volume and implementing complex operational procedures. The control {{software for the}} LHC experiments at CERN is built {{on top of a}} commercial software used in industrial automation. However, HEP specic requirements call for extended functionalities. This thesis focuses on the design and implementation of the control system for the CMS Silicon Strip Tracker but presents some general strategies that have been applied in other contexts. Specic design solutions are developed to ensure acceptable response times and to provide the operator with an effective summary of the status of the devices. Detector safety is guaranteed by proper conguration of independent hardware systems. A software protection mechanism is used to avoid the widespread intervention of the hardware safety and to <b>inhibit</b> dangerous <b>commands.</b> A wizard approach allows non expert operators to recover error situations and minimizes the downtime due to errors. Finally, the possibility of using a model-based methodology for prototyping 3 D user interfaces for control systems is investigated. The presented software is in continuous operation for the control of the CMS tracker while some general solutions have been adopted in the control systems of other CMS sub-detectors...|$|R
2500|$|In April 2011, Nissan {{announced}} that {{customers in the}} United States and Japan reported problems in restarting their Leaf vehicles after switching the motor off. Nissan said the problem does not pose any accident risk. On April 15. Nissan {{announced that}} the problem only affected {{a small proportion of}} Leafs. Nissan engineers identified a programming error in an air conditioning system sensor that sometimes triggers an erroneous high voltage alert when the air conditioning unit is switched on, due to the increased demand for power. The system issues an <b>Inhibit</b> Restart <b>command,</b> which does not prevent driving the vehicle, but does prevent it restarting after it is turned off. [...] The solution requires reprogramming of the Vehicle Control Module by a Nissan dealer. Nissan announced a [...] "service campaign" [...] to apply the software fix to all 5,300 Nissan Leafs in operation around the world, but it was not an official recall because it was not a safety issue. The applied software update also improves the carâ€™s on-board range calculation system, which several Leaf owners reported was overestimating the number of miles left. In addition, the update changes the state-of-charge bars display to provide a true reserve capacity; the driver now has up to five miles to find a charging spot after the car reaches the zero miles remaining mark.|$|R
40|$|We {{used the}} {{behavioral}} task and theoretical construct of the countermanding paradigm {{to test whether}} there is any difference between the inhibitory control of the finger, wrist, and arm. Participants were instructed (primary task) {{to respond to a}} directional go signal presented at the fovea by pressing a button with either their index or middle fingers, moving a joystick with their wrists, or reaching to a stimulus on a touch screen with their arms. They were also instructed (secondary task) to withhold their responses when a stop signal was presented on 25 % of trials. The participants' ability to inhibit each of the commanded movements was captured by their inhibition probability function, which describes how withholding is increasingly difficult as the delay between the go and stop signals increased. By modeling each participant's inhibition function, we estimated that the time needed to <b>inhibit</b> a <b>commanded</b> movement was about 240 ms, a variable that did not differ significantly between the three limb segments. Moreover, we found that the best-fit model of each segment's inhibition function could fit equally well the inhibition functions obtained with the other two segments. These results provide evidence that the upper limb segments share a common inhibitory control, which may facilitate the regulation of neuronal activity within the distributed motor cortical representations and thus simplify the voluntary control of multi-segmental movements.

40|$|Organized {{behaviour}} requires central neural {{mechanisms to}} prevent the simultaneous occurrence of incompatible movements. We investigated neural pathways in crayfish that suppress slow flexion of the abdomen during rapid flexions ('tailflips') produced by a separate set of muscles. The slow flexors are innervated in each half segment of the abdomen by five motor neurones and one peripheral inhibitor. In isolated preparations of the abdominal nervous system, stimulation of identified command neurones, which trigger tailflips in intact animals, inhibited spontaneous activity in the motor neurones to the slow flexors and excited the peripheral inhibitor. These effects are mediated by a population of interganglionic intemeurones interposed between the command cells and the slow flexor efferents. Slow flexor reflexes also were <b>inhibited</b> by escape <b>commands.</b> This inhibi-tion includes pathways that act upon early stages of sensory input. As a result, habituation of reflexes, which normally is produced by repeated stimulation, is abolished if each sensory stimulus is preceded by a burst of impulses in the command neurone...|$|R
40|$|The {{nervous system}} grants animals {{the ability to}} react to the complex and ever-changing environment. The ability of the nervous system to control {{behavior}} relies not only on the functional properties of individual neurons, but also on the specific pattern of connections in the neural circuits that make up the brain. This dissertation presents the functional study of a simple circuit, specifically the egg-laying circuit in the nematode Caenorhabditis elegan, as a model to understand the principles by which networks of neurons generate behavioral patterns. We first studied the circuit mechanism for individual egg-laying events using neural imaging and laser microsurgery. Our results indicated that the HSN and VC motorneurons together with vulval muscles (vm 1 and vm 2) comprise a core circuit that produces egg- laying events upon activation in the absence of sensory inputs. HSN serves as the command neuron of this core circuit, while the VCs, which are reciprocally connected to HSNs, provide a negative feedback loop as well as redundantly exciting the vulval muscles. The roles of two neurotransmitters expressed in these motorneurons, acetycholine and serotonin, have been investigated by directly monitoring both the activities of neurons in the egg-laying circuit in biosynthetic mutants. With this information about the functional roles of the egg-laying neurons, the egg-laying circuit provides a nice system for studying the effects of specific receptors and channels on neuronal function. As an example, we characterized a newly cloned novel voltage gated cation channel, NCA- 1, and demonstrated its function in cellbody-to-synapse excitation in the HSNs. Based on our results, we have proposed a theoretical model for how the clustered temporal pattern in the egg-laying behavior is generated in wild type animals. The VCs are suggested to work as "the single egg counter" that is activated by individual egg-laying events and <b>inhibits</b> the <b>command</b> neuron HSN {{for a short period of}} about 20 seconds. The uv 1 cell may serve as "the cluster egg counter", activated by a cluster of closely spaced egg-laying events and inhibiting HSN activity for a longer time of about 20 minutes. Together, these two pathways could produce the observed clustered temporal pattern by acting as negative regulators acting on different time scale...|$|R
