40|$|Abstract — The hose {{resource}} provisioning model {{promises to}} provide an easy–to–use characterization framework for Virtual Private Network service offerings. Significant research effort has recently been spent on proposing new algorithms for provisioning cost–optimal networks specified according to this new model. However, a detailed comparison of the bandwidth requirement for networks designed based on the <b>hose</b> <b>model</b> and networks designed based on the traditional pipe model has not been performed. The first contribution {{of this paper is}} a detailed comparison of the bandwidth needs of the two models assuming a range of network sizes and network topologies. This numerical evaluation required efficient calculation methods for determining resource allocation based on the <b>hose</b> <b>model</b> parameters, therefore, a linear programming based formulation is also presented for this purpose. The second contribution is the calculation of a lower bound for the hose based realization. This lower bound is very useful in evaluating the two models given that the problem of provisioning a minimal cost network based on the <b>hose</b> <b>model</b> specification can only approximately be solved in polynomial time.

Past work has focused on designing the network to support all hose matrices (all matrices not exceeding marginal bounds at the nodes).

Another extreme is the fixed demand model, where one designs the network to support peak point-to-point demands. We introduce a capped <b>hose</b> <b>model</b> to explore a broader range of traffic matrices which includes the above two as special cases. It is known that optimal designs for the <b>hose</b> <b>model</b> are always determined by single-hub routing, and for the fixed-demand model are based on shortest-path routing. We shed light on the wider space of capped hose matrices in order to see which traffic models are more shortest path-like as opposed to hub-like. To address the space in between, we use hierarchical multi-hub routing templates, a generalization of hub and tree routing. In particular, we show that by adding peak capacities into the <b>hose</b> <b>model,</b> the single-hub tree-routing template is no longer cost-effective.

40|$|We study an {{optimization}} problem {{which can be}} interesting in several network applications, especially in telecommunication. Given a capacitated directed network G in which a flow, related to a certain commodity, has to be sent from a given set of origins to a given set of destinations, we want to compute a maximum congested cut, i. e., a cut (S, T) of G which maximizes the ratio between the net demand of T and {{the capacity of the}} cut. We will show that a maximum congested cut can be computed in polynomial time by formulating the problem as a special maximum mean-weight cut problem, and solving it by Newton’s method for linear fractional combinatorial optimization (Radzik, Complexity in Numerical Optimization, World Scientific, Singapore, 1993). The introduced formulation will be extended to the case in which the flow demands vary in a polyhedron D, and a cut has to be determined which maximizes the congestion with respect to the flow demands in D, addressing a robust version of the problem. We will prove that the robust maximum congested cut problem is coNP-Hard. Special cases solvable in polynomial time as well as approximation algorithms for some relevant hard cases will be proposed. The specialization of the proposed approaches to the well-studied class of <b>Hose</b> <b>models</b> (Duffield et al., Proc., Conf Appl Technol Architect Protocol CompComm 29 (1999), 95 – 108) will be discussed.

40|$|Motivated {{and driven}} by the {{development}} of real-time multimedia applications, Quality of Service (QoS) has been a hot research area in computer networks for quite a long time. However, providing QoS in computer networks always faces network resource constraints: bandwidth, delay, and etc. Therefore, in this thesis, we try to alleviate these problems using additional information. The objective of the online QoS routing problem is to minimize the call blocking probability due to insufficient network resources while supporting the required quality of service. A scheme is proposed to protect those critical links/paths that are crucial for future requests. In this problem, the network resource constraint is the limited network routing ability and the information we made use of is the co-relationship among the network paths/links which can reflect link criticality. The second problem is the provisioning problem with enhanced <b>Hose</b> <b>model</b> in Virtual Private Networks (VPN).

40|$|The Agile All-Photonic Network (AAPN) uses Time Division Multiplexing (TDM) {{to better}} utilize the {{bandwidth}} of Wavelength Division Multiplexing (WDM) systems. It uses agile all-photonic switches as {{advances in the}} photonic switching technology made the design of all-photonic devices with switching latency in the sub-microseconds feasible. The network has a simplified overlaid star architecture that can be deployed in a Metropolitan Area Network (MAN) or a Wide Area Network (WAN) environment. This overlaid architecture, as opposed to general mesh architecture, scales network capacity to multiples of Tera bits per second, simplif�ies routing, increases reliability, eliminates wavelength conversion, {{and the need for}} accurate traffic engineering. The objective of this thesis is to propose and analyze dif�ferent load balancing methods for the deployment of the AAPN network in a WAN environment. The analysis should provide interested Internet Service Providers (ISPs) with a comprehensive study of load balancing methods for using the AAPN network as their backbone network. The methods balance the load at the ow level to reduce packet reordering. The methods are stateless and can compute routes quickly based on the packet flow identi�er. This is an important issue when deploying AAPN as an Internet backbone network where the number of flows is large and storing ow state in lookup tables can limit the network performance. The load balancing methods, deployed at the edge nodes, require reliable signaling with the bandwidth schedulers at the core nodes. To provide a reliable channel between the edge and core nodes, the Control Messages Delivery Protocol (CMDP) is proposed as part of this thesis work. The protocol is designed to work in environments where propagation delays are long and/or the error rates are high. It is used to deliver a burst of short messages in sequence and with no errors. Combined with the reliable routing protocol proposed previously for the AAPN network, they form the control plane for the network. To extend the applicability of the load balancing methods to topologies beyond AAPN overlaid star topology, the Valiant Load Balancing (VLB) method is used to build an overlaid star topology on top of the physical network. The VLB method provides guaranteed performance for highly variable tra�c matrices within the <b>hose</b> traffic <b>model</b> constraints. In addition to the guaranteed performance, deploying the VLB method in the AAPN network, eliminates signaling and replaces the dynamic core schedulers with static scheduler that can accommodate all tra�c matrices within the <b>hose</b> tra�c <b>model</b> boundaries...|$|R

In this paper, we propose a forwarding paradigm based on MPLS (Multi Protocol Label Switching) which makes use of a novel mechanism, denoted as MPLS splitting policy.

The MPLS splitting policy {{has been designed to}} allow for load balancing and fast local restoration. With such a mechanism, it is crucial to properly determine the set of split ratios, as they determine how the traffic is routed across the network.
