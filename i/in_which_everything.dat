5|$|The Galilean moons were {{discovered}} in either 1609 or 1610 when Galileo made improvements to his telescope, which enabled him to observe celestial bodies more distinctly than ever. Galileo's discovery showed {{the importance of the}} telescope as a tool for astronomers by proving that there were objects in space that cannot be seen by the naked eye. More importantly, the incontrovertible discovery of celestial bodies orbiting something other than Earth dealt a serious blow to the then-accepted Ptolemaic world system, or the geocentric theory <b>in</b> <b>which</b> <b>everything</b> orbits around Earth.|$|E

The sociologist Lewis F. Carter saw his ideas as rooted in Hindu advaita, in which the human experiences of separateness, duality and temporality are held {{to be a kind of}} dance or play of cosmic consciousness <b>in</b> <b>which</b> <b>everything</b> is sacred, has absolute worth and is an end in itself. While his contemporary Jiddu Krishnamurti did not approve of Rajneesh, there are clear similarities between their respective teachings.|$|E
25|$|In Adone, Marino quotes and rewrites {{passages}} from Dante's Divine Comedy, Ariosto, Tasso and the French {{literature of the}} day. The aim of these borrowings is not plagiarism but rather to introduce an erudite game with the reader who must recognise the sources and appreciate {{the results of the}} revision. Marino challenges the reader to pick up on the quotations and to enjoy {{the way in which the}} material has been reworked, as part of a conception of poetic creation <b>in</b> <b>which</b> <b>everything</b> in the world (including the literature of the past) can become the object of new poetry. In this way, Marino also turns Adone into a kind of poetic encyclopaedia, which collects and modernises all the previous productions of human genius.|$|E
25|$|Certain {{philosophers}} {{of science}} argue that while causal determinism <b>in</b> <b>which</b> <b>everything</b> including the brain/mind {{is subject to}} the laws of causality is compatible with minds capable of science, fatalism and predestination is not. These philosophers make the distinction that causal determinism means that each step is determined by the step before and therefore allows sensory input from observational data to determine what conclusions the brain reaches, while fatalism in which the steps between do not connect an initial cause to the results would make it impossible for observational data to correct false hypotheses. This is often combined with the argument that if the brain had fixed views and the arguments were mere after-constructs with no causal effect on the conclusions, science would have been impossible and the use of arguments would have been a meaningless waste of energy with no persuasive effect on brains with fixed views.|$|E

25|$|Modern maps of Oz {{are almost}} universally drawn with the Winkies {{in the west}} and the Munchkins in the east, {{although}} west and east often appear reversed. Many Oz fans believe this is the correct orientation, perhaps as a result of Glinda's spell, which has the effect of confusing most standard compasses; perhaps resembling its similarity to the world Alice found through the looking glass <b>in</b> <b>which</b> <b>everything</b> was a mirror image; or perhaps just reflecting the alien nature of Oz. In Robert A. Heinlein's book The Number of the Beast he posits that Oz is on a retrograde planet, meaning that it spins in the opposite direction of Earth so that the sun seems to rise on one's left as one faces north. March Laumer's The Magic Mirror of Oz attributes the changes to a character named Till Orangespiegel attempting to turn the Land of Oz orange.|$|E
25|$|Price lining {{is the use}} of {{a limited}} number of prices for all product offered by a business. Price lining is a {{tradition}} started in the old five and dime stores <b>in</b> <b>which</b> <b>everything</b> cost either 5 or 10 cents. In price lining, the price remains constant but quality or extent of product or service adjusted to reflect changes in cost. The underlying rationale of this tactic is that these amounts are seen as suitable price points for a whole range of products by prospective customers. It has the advantage of ease of administering, but the disadvantage of inflexibility, particularly in times of inflation or unstable prices. Price lining continues to be widely used in department stores where customers often note racks of garments or accessories priced at predetermined price points e.g. separate racks of men's ties, where each rack is priced at $10, $20 and $40.|$|E
25|$|New Orleans and St. Louis {{joined the}} United States and grew rapidly; entirely new cities were begun at Pittsburgh, Marietta, Cincinnati, Louisville, Lexington, Nashville and points west. The {{coming of the}} {{steamboat}} after 1810 made upstream traffic economical on major rivers, especially the Hudson, Ohio, Mississippi, Illinois, Missouri, Tennessee, and Cumberland rivers. Historian Richard Wade has {{emphasized the importance of}} the new cities in the Westward expansion in settlement of the farmlands. They were the transportation centers, and nodes for migration and financing of the westward expansion. The newly opened regions had few roads, but a very good river system <b>in</b> <b>which</b> <b>everything</b> flowed downstream to New Orleans. With the coming of the steamboat after 1815, it became possible to move merchandise imported from the Northeast and from Europe upstream to new settlements. The opening of the Erie Canal made Buffalo the jumping off point for the lake transportation system that made important cities out of Cleveland, Detroit, and especially Chicago.|$|E

25|$|The Church of Scotland has no {{compulsory}} prayer book, {{although it}} does have a hymn book (the 4th edition was published in 2005). Its Book of Common Order contains recommendations for public worship, which are usually followed fairly closely in the case of sacraments and ordinances. Preaching is the central focus of most services. Traditionally, Scots worship centred on the singing of metrical psalms and paraphrases, but for generations these have been supplemented with Christian music of all types. The typical Church of Scotland service lasts about an hour, and has been characterised jokingly as a hymn-prayer sandwich, <b>in</b> <b>which</b> <b>everything</b> leads up to a climax in a 15-minute sermon near the end. There is normally no sung or responsive liturgy, but worship {{is the responsibility of the}} minister in each parish, and the style of worship can vary and be quite experimental. In recent years, a variety of modern song books have been widely used to appeal more to contemporary trends in music, and elements from alternative liturgies including those of the Iona Community are incorporated in some congregations. Although traditionally worship is conducted by the parish minister, participation and leadership by members who are not ministers in services is becoming more frequent, especially in the Highlands and the Borders.|$|E
25|$|Taking its {{example from}} other European modernists like Joan Miró, the Color Field {{movement}} encompasses several decades from the mid 20th century {{through the early}} 21st century. Color Field painting actually encompasses three separate but related generations of painters. Commonly used terms {{to refer to the}} three separate but related groups are Abstract expressionism, Post-Painterly Abstraction, and Lyrical Abstraction. Some of the artists made works in all three eras, that relate to all of the three styles. Color Field pioneers such as Jackson Pollock, Mark Rothko, Clyfford Still, Barnett Newman, Adolph Gottlieb and Robert Motherwell are primarily thought of as Abstract Expressionists. Artists like Helen Frankenthaler, Sam Francis, Richard Diebenkorn, Jules Olitski, and Kenneth Noland were of a slightly younger generation {{or in the case of}} Morris Louis esthetically aligned with that generations point of view; that started out as Abstract Expressionists but quickly moved to Post-Painterly Abstraction. While younger artists like Frank Stella, Ronald Davis, Larry Zox, Larry Poons, Walter Darby Bannard, Ronnie Landfield, Dan Christensen, began with Post-Painterly Abstraction and eventually moved forward towards a new type of expressionism, referred to as Lyrical Abstraction. Many of the artists mentioned as well as many others have practiced all three modes at one phase of their careers or another. During the later phases of Color Field painting; as reflections of the zeitgeist of the late 1960s (<b>in</b> <b>which</b> <b>everything</b> began to hang loose) and the angst of the age (with all of the uncertainties of the time) merged with the gestalt of Post-Painterly Abstraction, producing Lyrical Abstraction which combined precision of the Color Field idiom with the malerische of the Abstract Expressionists. During the same period of the late 1960s early 1970s in Europe, Gerhard Richter, Anselm Kiefer and several other painters also began producing works of intense expression, merging abstraction with images, incorporating landscape imagery and figuration that by the late 1970s was referred to as Neo-expressionism.|$|E

500|$|As Jon Mee, {{a scholar}} of British radicalism, writes: [...] "Paine {{believed}} [...] [...] [...] a revolution in religion was the natural corollary, even prerequisite, of a fully successful political revolution." [...] Paine lays out a vision of, in Davidson and Scheick's words, [...] "an age of intellectual freedom, when reason would triumph over superstition, when the natural liberties of humanity would supplant priestcraft and kingship, which were both secondary effects of politically managed foolish legends and religious superstitions." [...] It is this vision that scholars have called Paine's [...] "secular millennialism" [...] and it appears {{in all of his}} works—he ends the Rights of Man, for example, with the statement: [...] "From what we now see, nothing of reform in the political world ought to be held improbable. It is an age of revolutions, <b>in</b> <b>which</b> <b>everything</b> may be looked for." [...] Paine [...] "transformed the millennial Protestant vision of the rule of Christ on earth into a secular image of utopia," [...] emphasizing the possibilities of [...] "progress" [...] and [...] "human perfectibility" [...] that could be achieved by humankind, without God's aid.|$|E

[...] Second placed Swift on the other hand, was disappointed by missing out on a possible win: [...] "Obviously, it's quite disappointing to get second – so close to the win – but you have got to be happy to be back on the podium in a Monument." [...] Fernando Gaviria shed tears after his late fall, which he felt cost him a possible victory: [...] "I am very sad about what happened. It was my fault, I was in a perfect position but then I lost my focus for two seconds, because I began thinking on how to sprint. I touched the wheel of the guy in front of me. That was enough to throw away all the hard work of the team." [...] Nacer Bouhanni in turn was furious after the finish. Some hundred metres before the finish line, he had been in a good position before his chain slipped off, taking away his chances. After crossing the line, he threw away his bike in anger.|$|E
