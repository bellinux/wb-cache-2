40|$|The aim of {{this thesis}} was to compare the {{analytical}} and sensory attributes of wines aged in different storage containers for {{a certain period of}} aging. The theoretical section describes wine storage containers from history to the present, their advantages and disadvantages. There are more details of barrique barrels, their processing and burning. The following section discusses the selection of appropriate containers for alcoholic fermentation. There is an important process of biological degradation of acid before red wine maturing, which is described in the next chapter. A large part of the chapter is devoted to wine aging. There are some effects in terms of oxygen, depending on maturation, pH for red wine colours, pH of the acid. An important chapter is the aging of wines in barrique barrels, followed by a change of phenolic compounds, dependence of oak and volatile compounds on physico -chemical characteristics of wines. In subsequent chapters there is explained the concept of wine aging, there are cataracts, diseases and <b>defects</b> <b>of</b> <b>wines</b> that may occur during aging. In the experimental part I used two red wines and one white wine. Wines were divided into inert containers and various barrels of different manufacturers and volumes. Red wines were produced in the same technology manner and the aging conditions (temperature, humidity) were the same as well. The aim was to evaluate the analytical and sensory values of wines for the time of one year. The attempt for white wine was aimed for the time of three months. The main intention was to monitor changes in the content of phenolic compounds : polyphenols, anthocyanins, polyphenols amount of gallic acid, hydroxycinnamic acids and flavonoids. Differences for each wine were observed depending on the container size and the ripening time. The senzory evaluation was an important parameter. Wines matured in barrels showed aromatic complexity and tannin structure with finesse...|$|E

40|$|This {{theoretical}} thesis {{deals with}} the biodynamics in viticulture. Literary section begins with an introduction to biodynamics, its expansion and growing of its popularity. Subsequently are described the organizations, that provide a biodynamic certification. The fifth chapter deals with general principles of winemaking {{in the context of}} biodynamics. Then it {{deals with the}} impact of astronomical phenomena in relation to the grape harvest, but also to other processes during vinification. It also explains the impact of grapes quality on wine. The seventh part is focused on general rules of working in the basement and the importance of the cellar construction itself. The following part deals with the winemaking. The structure of this theme depends on production methods that help reduce the content of SO 2 and overall contribution to reduce the interventions during production, which {{is an important part of}} the biodynamic principles. The work deals with possible <b>defects</b> <b>of</b> <b>wine,</b> which are related to wine production with minimizing doses of SO 2 and generally small interventions during production and aging <b>of</b> <b>wine.</b> It also includes recommendations to prevent them.

40|$|The light-struck {{taste is}} a <b>defect</b> <b>of</b> bottled white <b>wine</b> {{due to the}} light {{exposure}} and involving the riboflavin (RF), as a photosensitizer, and methionine. The reaction pathways lead {{to the formation of}} volatile sulfur compounds, methanethiol and dimethyldisulphide, conferring cabbage-like aromas. The development <b>of</b> this <b>defect</b> is limited at low RF concentrations. In this study, the yeast-mediated release of RF, RF degradation kinetics in model solution and white wine, and RF removal by using insoluble adjuvants were investigated. The results showed the RF release was a strain-dependent property and the fermentation rate did not affect the RF synthesis. The RF degradation followed a 1 st order kinetic in both model solution and white wine in which the degradation rate was halved. Among the adjuvants tested, bentonite and active charcoal were the most effective in RF removal and higher concentrations were needed for effectively treating white <b>wine.</b> The selection <b>of</b> low RF-producing yeasts and the treatment with active charcoal could represent useful tools to avoid the white wine spoilage during the shelf-life...|$|R

40|$|The {{capacity}} <b>of</b> <b>wine</b> yeast {{to utilize}} the nitrogen available in grape must directly correlates with the fermentation and growth rates <b>of</b> all <b>wine</b> yeast fermentation stages and is, thus, of critical importance for wine production. Here we precisely quantified the ability of low complexity nitrogen compounds to support fast, efficient and rapidly initiated growth of four commercially important wine strains. Nitrogen substrate abundance in grape must failed to correlate with the rate or the efficiency of nitrogen source utilization, but well predicted lag phase length. Thus, human domestication of yeast for grape must growth has had, at the most, a marginal impact on wine yeast growth rates and efficiencies, but may have left a surprising imprint on {{the time required to}} adjust metabolism from non growth to growth. Wine yeast nitrogen source utilization deviated from that of the lab strain experimentation, but also varied between wine strains. Each wine yeast lineage harbored nitrogen source utilization defects that were private to that strain. By a massive hemizygote analysis, we traced the genetic basis of the most glaring <b>of</b> these <b>defects,</b> near inability <b>of</b> the PDM <b>wine</b> strain to utilize methionine, as consequence of mutations in its ARO 8, ADE 5, 7 and VBA 3 alleles. We also identified candidate causative mutations in these genes. The methionine <b>defect</b> <b>of</b> PDM is potentially very interesting as the strain can, in some circumstances, overproduce foul tasting H 2 S, a trait which likely stems from insufficient methionine catabolization. The poor adaptation <b>of</b> <b>wine</b> yeast to the grape must nitrogen environment, and the presence <b>of</b> <b>defects</b> in each lineage, open up wine strain optimizatio...|$|R
