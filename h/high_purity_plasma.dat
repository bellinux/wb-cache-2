40|$|Background: Microfluidic-based {{systems are}} ideal for {{handling}} small microliter volumes of samples and reagents, but 'real-world' or clinical samples for bioanalysis are often on the milliliter scale. We aimed to develop and validate a large-volume centrifugal or compact disc-based device for blood plasma separation, capable of processing 2 ml undiluted blood samples. Results: This automated blood sample preparation device was shown to yield <b>high</b> <b>purity</b> <b>plasma</b> in {{less than half the}} time of commercial plasma preparation tubes, while enabling integration with downstream analysis and detection steps. Conclusion: This article draws upon a novel large-volume device to further illustrate the challenges in combining microfluidics structures with large-volume samples and the implications for sample-driven microfluidics systems. open 222...|$|E
40|$|In this paper, {{continuous}} plasma extraction under viscoelastic {{fluid in}} a straight channel with asymmetrical expansion-contraction cavity arrays (ECCA channel) is demonstrated by exploiting the Dean-flow-coupled elasto-inertial effects. First, the forces experienced by particles in the ECCA channel were discussed. Then, 4. 8 ¿m diameter particles, which mimic the behaviour of red blood cells (RBCs), were used to {{study the effects of}} poly(ethylene oxide) (PEO) concentrations and flow rates on particle viscoelastic focusing. Also, 3 ¿m, 4. 8 ¿m and 10 ¿m diameter particles, which are comparable in size to platelets, RBCs, and white blood cells (WBCs), respectively, were used to study the effect of particle size on particle viscoelastic focusing. Finally, plasma extraction from diluted blood samples under viscoelastic conditions was conducted, and the purity of the collected blood plasma was measured. After two series of filtration with the same ECCA channel, the purity of 3 ¿m, 4. 8 ¿m and 10 ¿m diameter particles reached 100 %, and the plasma purity reached 99. 99 %, as measured by a hemocytometer. In addition, flow cytometry data further validated the filtration performance of blood plasma. By exploiting the Dean-flow-coupled elasto-inertial effects, the ECCA channel offers a continuous, sheathless, and <b>high</b> <b>purity</b> <b>plasma</b> extraction...|$|E
40|$|Abstract Background The plasma {{membrane}} (PM) is a compartment of significant interest because cell surface proteins influence {{the way in}} which a cell interacts with its neighbours and its extracellular environment. However, PM is hard to isolate because of its low abundance. Aqueous two-phase affinity purification (2 PAP), based on PEG/Dextran two-phase fractionation and lectin affinity for PM-derived microsomes, is an emerging method for the isolation of <b>high</b> <b>purity</b> <b>plasma</b> membranes from several vertebrate sources. In contrast, PM isolation techniques in important invertebrate genetic model systems, such as Drosophila melanogaster, have relied upon enrichment by density gradient centrifugation. To facilitate genetic investigation of activities contributing to the content of the PM sub-proteome, we sought to adapt 2 PAP to this invertebrate model to provide a robust PM isolation technique for Drosophila. Results We show that 2 PAP alone does not completely remove contaminating endoplasmic reticulum and mitochondrial membrane. However, a novel combination of density gradient centrifugation plus 2 PAP results in a robust PM preparation. To demonstrate the utility of this technique we isolated PM from fly heads and successfully identified 432 proteins using MudPIT, of which 37 % are integral membrane proteins from all compartments. Of the 432 proteins, 22 % have been previously assigned to the PM compartment, and a further 34 % are currently unassigned to any compartment and represent candidates for assignment to the PM. The remainder have previous assignments to other compartments. Conclusion A combination of density gradient centrifugation and 2 PAP results in a robust, high purity PM preparation from Drosophila, something neither technique can achieve on its own. This novel preparation should lay the groundwork for the proteomic investigation of the PM in different genetic backgrounds in Drosophila. Our results also identify two key steps in this procedure: The optimization of membrane partitioning in the PEG/Dextran mixture, and careful choice of the correct lectin for the affinity purification step in light of variations in bulk membrane lipid composition and glycosylation patterns respectively. This points the way for further adaptations into other systems. </p...|$|E

Thermal, {{electrical}} and mechanical properties of <b>high</b> <b>purity</b> niobium and tantalum refractory rare metals were investigated {{to evaluate the}} physical <b>purity.</b> <b>Higher</b> <b>purity</b> niobium and tantalum metals showed lower hardness due to smaller solution hardening effect.

Remarkable decrease in electrical resistivity was observed for a <b>high</b> <b>purity</b> specimen at low temperature.

When the samples were sintered in Ar with O 2 impurity, their low field Jc decreased as the O 2 content increased. The high field Jc, in contrast, was improved as the concentration of the O 2 impurity increased. For the sample sintered in Ar with H 2 impurity, its Jc is significantly higher than that of the sample sintered in <b>high</b> <b>purity</b> Ar.

We adopted sand blasting and acid etching in the recovering process of waste silicon chips. On the experiment we removed the impurity layers {{on the surface of the}} waster silicon chips and reclaimed the <b>high</b> <b>purity</b> silicon chips by sand-blasting method. In addition, the admixture of HF 、HNO 3 and CH 3 COOH was used to etch the metal-intermingled layers on the surface of the waster silicon chips so that <b>high</b> <b>purity</b> silicon chips were reclaimed. We can identify that the two methods of sand-blasting and acid etching would be available in reclaiming <b>high</b> <b>purity</b> silicon materials from waste electronic grade silicon chips. Sand-blasting is suitable to reclaim silicon chips with large size, and acid-etching is suitable to reclaim silicon chips with small size or silicon grains.
