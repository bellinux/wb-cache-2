5000|$|Amongst other useful {{effects of}} using {{high levels of}} Natural Oil Polyols to make foams are the {{improvements}} seen in the long-term performance of the foam under humid conditions and also on the flammability of the foams; compared to equivalent foams made without {{the presence of the}} NOP.People perspire; and so foams used for the construction of matrasses or furniture will, over time, tend to feel softer and give less support. The perspiration gradually softens the foam. Foams made with high levels of NOPs are much less prone to this problem, so that the useful lifetime of the upholstered product can be extended.The use of high levels of NOP also make it possible to manufacture foams with flame retardants which are permanent, and therefore are not later emitted into the household or work place environment. These relatively recently developed materials can be added at very low levels to NOP foams to pass such well known tests as California Technical Bulletin 117, which is a well-known flammability test for furniture. These permanent flame-retardants are halogen free and key into the foam matrix and are therefore fixed there. An additional effect of using these new, highly efficient, permanent flame retardants, is that the smoke seen during these standard fire tests, may be considerably reduced compared to that produced when testing foams made using non-permanent <b>flame</b> <b>retardant</b> <b>materials,</b> which do not key themselves into the foam structure. More recent work during 2014 with this [...] "Green Chemistry" [...] has shown that foams containing about 50 percent by weight of natural oils can be made which produce far less smoke when involved in fire situations.

40|$|Fire {{safety of}} cables is {{becoming}} increasingly important {{as the use of}} electrical equipment steadily increases. Due to their excellent dielectric properties, polyolefin materials are widely used as insulating materials for cables. However, polyolefins are inherently flammable and need to be protected to meet the requirements on flame retardancy. The work presented in this thesis covers the study of a halogen-free <b>flame</b> <b>retardant</b> <b>material</b> system based on polyethylene copolymers together with calcium carbonate and silicone elastomer. The <b>flame</b> <b>retardant</b> mechanism of this system is a combination of dilution by the calcium carbonate, formation of a stable foam, and formation of a protective silica layer on the surface. This layer will act as a barrier for mass transport of both oxygen into the insulation, and volatile decomposition products out of the material. The effect of different copolymers on the formation of the foamed structure and burning characteristics of the system has been investigated. Poly(ethylene-co-butyl acrylate) (EBA) and poly(ethylene-co¬-methacrylic acid) (EMAA) have been compared. Acrylic acid, formed at elevated temperatures from EBA and present in virgin EMAA, reacts with the calcium carbonate to form ionomeric cross-links that increase the melt viscosity. This effect is more pronounced when EMAA is used as the copolymer and leads to less intense burning and lower dripping. Several different additives have been evaluated as components in the system described above. Small amounts of clay, with at least one dimension in the nanometre scale, reduce the dripping and heat release rate. Different metal oxides have been studied with various results. Some additives show promising effects in certain tests but fail to improve the overall <b>flame</b> <b>retardant</b> behaviour. The results show, that rather small changes in formulation have large impact on the performance in a fire situation.

It indicated that the effect of smoke suppressor about PE-MH-NC was remarkable through the cone calorimetry test, and its <b>flame</b> <b>retardant</b> performance was the best which satisfy many requirements of the <b>flame</b> <b>retardant</b> cable <b>material...</b>|$|R
40|$|Six new {{flame-retardant}} poly(ester-imide) s (9 a-f) {{with high}} inherent viscosity and containing phos-phine oxide moieties {{in the main}} chain were synthesized from the polycondensation reaction of N,N-(3, 3 -diphenylphenyl phosphine oxide) bistrimellitimide diacid chloride (7) with 6 aromatic diols (8 a-f) by 2 different methods:–solution and microwave-assisted polycondensation. The results showed that com-pared to solution polycondensation, the microwave-assisted polycondensation reaction using a domestic microwave oven proceeded rapidly and was completed within about 9 - 12 min. All of the obtained poly-mers were fully characterized by means of elemental analysis, viscosity measurement, solubility testing, and FT-IR spectroscopy. Thermal properties and <b>flame</b> <b>retardant</b> behavior of the PEIs (9 a-f) were in-vestigated by using thermal gravimetric analysis (TGA and DTG) and the limited oxygen index (LOI). Data obtained by thermal analysis (TGA and DTG) revealed that these poly(ester-imide) s had good thermal stability. Furthermore, high char yields in TGA and good LOI values indicated that incorporat-ing phosphine oxide moieties in the polymer backbone markedly improved their flame retardancy. These polymers can be potentially utilized in <b>flame</b> <b>retardant</b> thermoplastic <b>materials.</b> Key Words: Flame-retardant polymers,;hosphine oxide moieties, N-(3, 3 -diphenylphenyl phosphine oxide) bistrimellitimide diacid chloride, romatic diols...|$|R
