40|$|Abstract – In {{a future}} {{electric}} power system, there will exist {{a lot of}} distributed energy resources such as energy storage devices, renewable generation and cogeneration in the demand side. A system operator can utilize the dis-tributed energy storage devices to control power flow of transmission networks and supply-demand balance con-cerned with bilateral transactions. For management of such distributed energy storage de-vices, a mobile agent which can migrate in computer net-works is available. This paper proposes an application of the mobile agent to management of the <b>distributed</b> storage <b>devices</b> for power flow control of transmission network. Management of <b>distributed</b> storage <b>devices</b> is done hierar-chically. On the transmission-level, the system operator controls power flows by using a lot of <b>distributed</b> storage <b>devices</b> connected in distribution networks. On distribu-tion-level, the mobile agent aggregates the information about such <b>distributed</b> storage <b>devices</b> and makes charge-discharge schedules of individual storage devices.

40|$|This paper proposes an {{integrated}} device control system called Control Architecture for Networked Devices in Location Environments (CANDLE), which controls devices with Google Maps. Google Maps provides a global map interface and flexible APIs. The main motivation {{for this study}} is to provide a search and control system for physically <b>distributed</b> <b>devices</b> using Google Maps. To achieve this, the requirements of the system are (1) to coordinate device information with map information on Google Maps and (2) all distributed information has to be integrated on one interface. Device information is a set of information to control devices on an interface of Google Maps. CANDLE is {{an integrated}} device control system using Google Maps designed to meet these requirements. Using CANDLE, a user can control physically <b>distributed</b> <b>devices</b> through a web browser. In CANDLE, all device information is integrated into one map. CANDLE enables device control, searches, and display of information on <b>distributed</b> <b>devices</b> on an interface of Google Maps through a web browser.

40|$|Peripheral {{devices are}} {{hardware}} components that {{are connected to}} a computer and they supplement the functionality of a computer. Over the years, a huge improvement has been observed both in variety and capabilities of peripheral devices. Starting from the input/output and storage devices of early days, today's peripheral devices support all aspects of a computer, with peripherals like Graphical Processing Units (GPUs) even supplementing the computational capabilities of a processor. At the same time, the support for peripheral devices in computers has vastly improved. While the earlier computers only supported static configuration of devices, the plug-and-play capabilities in present day computers allow devices to be added or removed at run time, thus reducing the complexity of managing peripheral devices. Today, {{it is not an}} exaggeration to state that, beyond the computational capability of a computer, it is the peripheral devices that define the user experience. With the advancements in networking and distributed computing, the definition of what constitutes a computer has been blurred: Mainframes and Supercomputing clusters support batch processing, where processors/cores are treated as resources, and number of processors/cores available for a specific computation can be requested on demand. With cloud computing, users access services hosted across the Internet. However, usage models for peripheral devices have not caught up accordingly. For the most part, Peripheral devices are still limited to the computers they are physical attached to. Device virtualization solutions exist that can extend the device protocols over the network, enabling users to access devices connected to a different computer. However, these device virtualization solutions still need direct access to both the computer that has the device plugged in (Device Server) and to the computer that intends to use the device (Device Client) and they do not support remote plug-and-play. So, {{there is a need for}} a device consolidation framework that supports new device usage models that are in line with the evolving models of computation. In this thesis, we propose a framework called "Distributed Device Bus", which extends the concept of a conventional peripheral bus to include in its scope, the ports of all the computers that are connected over a network. Like a peripheral bus, a <b>Distributed</b> <b>Device</b> Bus is also associated with a computer called Master node. A <b>Distributed</b> <b>Device</b> Bus supports dynamic addition/deletion of ports and each of these ports can physically belong to any computer in the network. Computers that contribute ports to a <b>Distributed</b> <b>Device</b> Bus are called Provider nodes. A device plugged into any port that is assigned to a <b>Distributed</b> <b>Device</b> Bus is immediately made accessible to applications on master node. This device consolidation framework treats devices as a resource and access to a device is configurable rather than being limited to the computer the device is physically attached to...|$|R
40|$|In {{this paper}} {{we attempt to}} parallelise a {{commodity}} database for OLAP on a cluster of commodity PCs by using a distributed high-performance storage subsystem. By parallelising the underlying storage architecture we eliminate {{the need to make}} any changes to the database software. We look at two options that di#er in their complexity and features: <b>Distributed</b> <b>devices</b> and distributed file systems. The former aggregates several single disks within the cluster into a RAID device across the network. The latter offers all the features of a real file system at the price of a considerably increased complexity. We configured a Linux version of ORACLE to run on various <b>distributed</b> <b>devices</b> or distributed file systems, respectively, and ran a TPC-D benchmark on our cluster of commodity PCs interconnected by a Gigabit Ethernet. While <b>distributed</b> <b>devices</b> achieve at least the performance of local disks, they o#er the benefit of using all surplus storage in a cluster. The distributed file systems seem to run into performance problems due to their increased complexity. We explain the experimental results with an analytic model of the cluster architecture and include a comparison of the same workload on an architecture that distributes the TPC-D queries at a higher level (and not just the underlying storage system). We conclude with suggestions for higher performances in future clusters of commodity PCs...|$|E

Although different systems in a network can function independently, their interaction is usually subjected to definite rules. These rules often form algorithms of interaction for distributed systems and devices. The main goal is to understand how control algorithms in distributed systems organize computational processes. Characteristics of distributed computational processes are considered from the algorithmic perspective. Conditions are found when such a network controlled by algorithm functions as a single algorithm and types of such unifying algorithms are determined. All mathematical models of distributed computation, including such popular structures as neural networks, Petri nets, systolic arrays, iterative arrays, and cellular automata, are synthesized in the concept of grid automaton.
