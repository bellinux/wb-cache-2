500|$|The {{development}} of special fuel {{was attributed to}} the work of [...] "Rod" [...] Banks, an engineer who specialised in fuels and engine development. After using neat benzole for early ground test runs; a mixture of 11% aviation petrol and 89% benzole, plus 5cubic centimetres (cc) of tetra-ethyl lead per Imperial gallon (4.5L) was tried. This blend of fuel was used to win the 1929 Schneider Trophy race, and continued to be used until June 1931. It was discovered that adding 10% methanol to this mixture resulted in a 20hp (15kW) increase, with the further advantage of reduced fuel weight– particularly important for aircraft use– due to its lowered specific gravity. For the 1931 airspeed record attempt acetone was added to prevent intermittent misfiring, the composition of this <b>final</b> <b>blend</b> was 30% benzole, 60% methanol, and 10% acetone, plus 4.2cc of tetra-ethyl lead per gallon.|$|E

40|$|The {{inter-comparison}} {{of different}} soil moisture (SM) products over the Tibetan Plateau (TP) reveals the inconsistency among different SM products, {{when compared to}} in situ measurement. It highlights the need to constrain the model simulated SM with the in situ measured data climatology. In this study, the in situ soil moisture networks, combined with the classification of climate zones over the TP, were used to produce the in situ measured SM climatology at the plateau scale. The generated TP scale in situ SM climatology was then used to scale the model-simulated SM data, which was subsequently used to scale the SM satellite observations. The climatology-scaled satellite and model-simulated SM were then blended objectively, by applying the triple collocation and least squares method. The <b>final</b> <b>blended</b> SM can replicate the SM dynamics across different climatic zones, from sub-humid regions to semi-arid and arid regions over the TP.

40|$|Biodiesel is an {{alternative}} fuel derived from vegetable oils, animal fats and used frying oils. Due to its chemical structure, it is more susceptible to oxidation or autoxidation during long-term storage compared to petroleum diesel fuel.

40|$|To have {{a better}} {{understanding}} of the different behavior of selected geographical origins of green coffee during roasting in an industrial plant, in the present work five different green coffees (two arabica from Brazil and Costa Rica and three robusta from Vietnam, India and Ivory Coast) were treated in a batch roasting plant, taking samples for analysis at regular intervals. The evaluated parameters were volume, weight, moisture and color of the grains and grounds. The experimental results provided knowledge of the differences in roasting degree of selected coffee origins and also allowed us to observe the changes in physical attributes with roasting time. The conditions used by roasting machines result in a volume increase and a loss in weight and density with slight changes according to the origin. Lightness initially increase then decrease to lower values. Lightness of the grounds is higher with respect to that of the grains showing that that the roasting process took place from the outer to the bulk of the beans but at the end of the process lightness is uniform, outside and inside.

40|$|The {{blending}} {{performance in}} a resonant acoustic mixer (RAM) was characterized. The system showed to be highly effective in blending low concentrations of cohesive active pharmaceutical ingredients (APIs) and lubricants. A summary of these results will be described and changes in material properties were observed. Those changes, and their effects on tablet characteristics, were also studied. Changes in particle size, powder flow properties, and hydrophobicity of the blend were investigated. Tablets were then compressed, using a tablet press simulator, and characterized. The tableting compression force, tablet hardness, tablet weight, and tablet dissolution were considered. Results indicated that the powder blend material properties and tablet characteristics were significantly affected by acceleration (mixing intensity), blending time, and thus, total energy input. The RAM was shown to be an excellent choice for blending low concentrations of cohesive APIs, but {{care must be taken}} when blending hydrophobic lubricants because the high-energy input can adversely affect the final tablet properties such as hardness and dissolution. In addition, the material properties of the blends and tablets were correlated to the total energy input.
