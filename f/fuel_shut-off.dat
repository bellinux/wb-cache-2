2500|$|The report {{went on to}} {{note that}} the fire {{extinguisher}} handles had been manually deployed by the crew before the <b>fuel</b> <b>shut-off</b> switches. The fire extinguisher handles also have the effect of cutting off power to the fuel switches, meaning that the fuel may continue to flow – a potentially dangerous situation. The report restated a previous Boeing Service Bulletin giving procedural advice that fuel switches should be operated before fire handles. It went on: [...] "This was not causal to the accident but could have had serious consequences {{in the event of a}} fire during the evacuation." ...|$|E
50|$|There {{are four}} {{distinct}} electrical systems {{that may be}} used in autogas systems - fuel gauge sender, <b>fuel</b> <b>shut-off,</b> closed loop feedback mixture control and injection control.|$|E
50|$|The manual <b>fuel</b> <b>shut-off</b> petcock was removed, {{with the}} PGM-FI an {{automotive}} style fuel gauge was added. When {{the fuel level}} reaches the E symbol a low-fuel warning light begins to flash letting the rider {{know that they have}} about 1.1 gallons of fuel remaining, or enough for approximately 28 miles of reserve range. Battery capacity was increased from 14AH to 18AH.|$|E
50|$|A two air bag {{supplementary}} {{restraint system}} (SRS) with 2-way occupant protection was standard. The air bags would adjust deployment force depending on crash severity. Features included SecuriLock with smart key and engine immobilizer, security approach lamps, four-wheel {{anti-lock braking system}} (ABS), side-intrusion door beams, post-crash <b>fuel</b> pump <b>shut-off</b> and three-point safety belts for all rows of seating with tension and locking retractors.|$|R
50|$|Other {{features}} included side-intrusion door beams, security approach lamps, SecuriLock with {{smart key}} and engine immobilizer, BeltMinder, three-point safety belts for all rows of seating, post-crash <b>fuel</b> pump <b>shut-off,</b> {{tire pressure monitoring system}} (TPMS) and four-wheel, four-sensor, four-channel {{anti-lock braking system}} (ABS) with electronic brakeforce distribution (EBD) and emergency brake assist (EBA). AdvanceTrac electronic stability control with traction control system was introduced as an optional extra. The electronic traction and stability mitigation system would expand to include roll stability control (RSC) for the 2005 model year.|$|R
5000|$|... 911 Assist: A form of Advanced Automatic Collision Notification, when sensors {{detect the}} vehicle has been {{involved}} in a collision involving airbag deployment and, on certain vehicles, where the emergency <b>fuel</b> pump <b>shut-off</b> is activated, 911 Assist puts the occupant(s) of the car directly in touch with a 911 operator. 911 Assist provides a 10-second window where occupants have the option to cancel the call before dialing. Where occupants of the car are unable to speak, 911 Assist delivers an emergency message to the 911 operator (Not available outside North America).|$|R
5000|$|The mid-level Challenger R/T {{is powered}} by a 345 cuin L Hemi V8 coupled to a 5-speed {{automatic}} transmission or a Tremec TR-6060 6-speed manual transmission. On cars equipped with the automatic transmission, the engine features the Multi-Displacement System and produces [...] (SAE) and 398 lbfft Nm torque. With the 6-speed manual transmission, the Multi-Displacement System option was deleted and the engine produced [...] (SAE) and 404 lbfft Nm torque. Another feature was the Intelligent Deceleration <b>Fuel</b> <b>Shut-Off</b> (iDFSO) available for the automatic models only. The first to combine both a Multi-Displacement system and <b>fuel</b> <b>shut-off.</b> The final drive ratio was 3.06:1 on cars with the automatic transmission, 3.73:1 on cars with the 6-speed manual and 18 in wheels or 3.92:1 with the 6-speed manual and optional 20 in wheels. Also available on R/T was the [...] "Track Pak" [...] option group, which includes the Tremec manual transmission, a limited slip differential and self-leveling rear shock absorbers.|$|E
50|$|On the inbound {{flight to}} Malaga the aircraft’s left engine fuel {{advisory}} light became illuminated, indicating a possible {{defect in the}} <b>fuel</b> <b>shut-off</b> valve. On landing, Jet2.com arranged for a spare valve to be fitted but the problem remained. It was not possible for the problem to be resolved before the airport shut for the evening. The following day engineers discovered a wiring defect in the fuel valve circuit which required repairing. As a result Jet2.com sent a specialist engineer and spare wiring from its hangar at Leeds Bradford airport. In the meantime Jet2.com decided to bring another aircraft from Glasgow to take passengers from Malaga to Manchester.|$|E
50|$|Fuel is piped through {{fuel lines}} to a fuel control valve (usually {{known as the}} fuel selector). This valve serves several {{function}}s. The first function is {{to act as a}} <b>fuel</b> <b>shut-off</b> valve. This is required to provide the crew with a means to prevent fuel reaching the engine in case of an engine fire. The second function is to allow the pilot to choose which tank feeds the engine. Many aircraft have the left tank and right tank selections available to the pilot. Some Cessna airplanes feed only from both tanks; and many have the option to feed from left, right, or both tanks. The reason to have left only and right only options is to allow pilots to balance fuel load to reduce the banking moment. In some aircraft, the shut-off function is a different valve located after the fuel selector valve.|$|E
50|$|Other safety {{features}} include side-intrusion door beams, security approach lamps, SecuriLock with smart key and engine immobilizer, BeltMinder, three-point safety belts for all rows of seating, post-crash <b>fuel</b> pump <b>shut-off,</b> {{tire pressure monitoring system}} (TPMS), AdvanceTrac electronic stability control (ESC) with {{roll stability control}} (RSC), traction control system (TCS), and four-wheel, four-sensor, four-channel anti-lock braking system (ABS) with electronic brakeforce distribution (EBD) and emergency brake assist (EBA). 911 Assist, perimeter alarm and SOS Post-Crash Alert features were added for 2009-onward models. SOS Post-Crash Alert will activate the Expedition's horn and continuously flash the hazard/caution lights as well as the lane departure indicators on the side view mirrors after a collision.|$|R
5000|$|Typical safety {{equipment}} for contemporary top fuel dragsters: full face helmets with fitted HANS devices; multi-point, quick release safety restraint harness; full body fire suit made of Nomex or similar material, complete with face mask, gloves, socks, shoes, and outer sock-like boots, all made of fire-resistant materials; on board fire extinguishers; kevlar or other synthetic [...] "bullet-proof" [...] blankets around the superchargers and clutch assemblies to contain broken {{parts in the}} event of failure or explosion; damage resistant fuel tank, lines, and fittings; externally accessible <b>fuel</b> and ignition <b>shut-offs</b> (built to be accessible to rescue staff); braking parachutes; {{and a host of other}} equipment, all built to the very highest standards of manufacturing. Any breakthrough or invention that is likely to contribute to driver, staff, and spectator safety is likely to be adopted as a mandated rule for competition. The 54-year history of NHRA has provided hundreds of examples of safety upgrades.|$|R

5000|$|For 1996, Ford finally retired {{the aging}} 5.0L V8 in the Mustang GT and SVT Cobra, {{replacing}} it with a new aluminum 4.6L DOHC modular unit that was smoother and had slightly better fuel economy. Starting with the 1996 model year, every Cobra engine was hand-assembled by two-person teams at the Ford Romeo Engine Plant in Romeo, Michigan, a practice that continued through the remainder of SVT Cobra production. Each engine had a label (later, a metal plaque on the 2003-2004 Cobra engines) bearing the names and signatures of the two engine builders. The Romeo engine, as it was called, produced [...] and [...] of torque, enabling the new Cobra to go 0-60 mph in 5.9 seconds and do the quarter mile in 13.99 seconds at 101.6 mph. However, Car and Driver magazine was able to hit 60 mph in 5.4 seconds and the quarter mile in 14.00 seconds at 102 mph during a comparison test in their December 1995 issue. The 1996 Cobra engine redlined at 6,800 rpm, with <b>fuel</b> <b>shut-off</b> occurring at 7,000 rpm.|$|E
