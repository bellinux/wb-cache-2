50|$|The current {{which will}} flow in an {{intrinsic}} semiconductor consists of both electron and hole current. That is, the electrons {{which have been}} freed from their lattice positions into the conduction band can move through the material. In addition, other electrons can hop between lattice positions to fill the vacancies left by the freed electrons. This additional mechanism is called <b>hole</b> <b>conduction</b> because {{it is as if}} the holes are migrating across the material in the direction opposite to the free electron movement. The current flow in an intrinsic semiconductor is influenced by the density of energy states which in turn influences the electron density in the conduction band.

40|$|Observations {{of the hot}} gas {{surrounding}} Sgr A * and a {{few other}} nearby galactic nuclei imply electron and proton mean free paths comparable to the gas capture radius: hot accretion likely proceeds under weakly-collisional conditions in these systems. As a result, thermal conduction, rather than convection, may be important on all scales and affect the global flow properties. The self-similar ADAF solution of Narayan & Yi (1994) is generalized to include a saturated form of thermal conduction, as is appropriate for the weakly-collisional regime of interest. Conduction provides extra heating and yet it reduces the free-free radiative efficiency of the accretion flow (by potentially large factors). These idealized solutions suggest that thermal conduction may be an important physical ingredient to understand hot accretion onto dim accreting black <b>holes.</b> <b>Conduction</b> could also play a role in reducing the rate at which black holes capture ambient gas and in providing an evaporation mechanism for an underlying cold thin disk.
