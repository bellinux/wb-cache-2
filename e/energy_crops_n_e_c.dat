40|$|This paper evaluates {{life cycle}} {{greenhouse}} gas (GHG) emissions {{from the use}} of different biomass feedstock categories (agriculture residues, dedicated <b>energy</b> <b>crops,</b> forestry, industry, parks and gardens, wastes) independently on biomass-only (biomass as a standalone fuel) and cofiring (biomass used in combination with coal) electricity generation systems. The statistical evaluation of the life cycle GHG emissions (expressed in grams of carbon dioxide equivalent per kilowatt hour, gCO 2 e/kWh) for biomass electricity generation systems was based on the review of 19 life cycle assessment studies (representing 66 biomass cases). The mean life cycle GHG emissions resulting {{from the use of}} agriculture residues (N = 4), dedicated <b>energy</b> <b>crops</b> (<b>N</b> = 19), forestry (N = 6), industry (N = 4), and wastes (N = 2) in biomass-only electricity generation systems are 291. 25 gCO 2 e/kWh, 208. 41 gCO 2 e/kWh, 43 gCO 2 e/kWh, 45. 93 gCO 2 e/kWh, and 1731. 36 gCO 2 e/kWh, respectively. The mean life cycle GHG emissions for cofiring electricity generation systems using agriculture residues (N = 10), dedicated <b>energy</b> <b>crops</b> (<b>N</b> = 9), forestry (N = 9), industry (N = 2), and parks and gardens (N = 1) are 1039. 92 gCO 2 e/kWh, 1001. 38 gCO 2 e/kWh, 961. 45 gCO 2 e/kWh, 926. 1 gCO 2 e/kWh, and 1065. 92 gCO 2 e/kWh, respectively. Forestry and industry (avoiding the impacts of biomass production and emissions from waste management) contribute the least amount of GHGs, irrespective of the biomass electricity generation system...|$|R

40|$|Potential {{feedstocks}} from crop-based {{energy production}} systems range from starchy and sugary tuberous crops to woody, oilseed, or herbaceous crops (including corn, sweet and grain sorghums, and several grasses). An important characteristic of biomass crops {{is that the}} ratio of energy of the biomass product be large compared to the energy used to pro­ duce the crop. Because {{one of the most}} costly inputs in the latter component is nitrogen (N) fertilizer, any evaluation of potential <b>energy</b> <b>crops</b> must emphasize <b>N</b> inputs. Given its high N requirement, corn is not likely to meet all future ethanol demands.

40|$|Assessment of crop {{nitrogen}} use efficiency (NUE) {{is important}} in agricultural research. Various approaches exist to analyze NUE. A recently proposed NUE concept is further developed and a calculation tool for practical use presented. A critical component in the NUE concept is the plants’ mean nitrogen (N) content during the main growth period (N’). The N’ is delimited by the critical crop phenology stages initiating and terminating accelerated <b>crop</b> <b>N</b> uptake. Especially when experimental treatments and/or crop cultivars cause great variation in phenology, it is often not feasible to perform destructive plant harvests at the critical phenology stages for all treatments and cultivars, which may result in inaccurate estimates of N’ and, ultimately, the NUE components N uptake efficiency and yield-specific N efficiency. A method is proposed to accurately calculate the <b>crop</b> <b>N</b> contents at the relevant critical phenology stages even when sampling is made at other time points. The only requirements are two separate destructive plant harvests performed within the main growth period, together with the time points for the critical phenology events. The method was exemplified using data from wheat and the perennial <b>energy</b> <b>crop</b> Salix, and an electronic calculation tool for the various NUE components is provided...|$|R

40|$|<b>Energy</b> <b>crops</b> {{production}} is considered as environmentally benign and socially acceptable, offering ecological benefits over fossil fuels through {{their contribution to}} the reduction of greenhouse gases and acidifying emissions. <b>Energy</b> <b>crops</b> are subjected to persistent policy support by the EU, despite their limited or even marginally {{negative impact on the}} greenhouse effect. The present study endeavors to optimize the agricultural income generated by <b>energy</b> <b>crops</b> in a remote and disadvantageous region, with the assistance of linear programming. The optimization concerns the income created from soybean, sunflower (proxy for <b>energy</b> <b>crop),</b> and corn. Different policy scenarios imposed restrictions on the value of the subsidies as a proxy for EU policy tools, the value of inputs (costs of capital and labor) and different irrigation conditions. The results indicate that the area and the imports per <b>energy</b> <b>crop</b> remain unchanged, independently of the policy scenario enacted. Furthermore, corn cultivation contributes the most to iFncome maximization, whereas the implemented CAP policy plays an incremental role in uptaking an <b>energy</b> <b>crop.</b> A key implication is that alternative forms of motivation should be provided to the farmers beyond the financial ones in order the extensive use of <b>energy</b> <b>crops</b> to be achieved...|$|R
40|$|<b>Energy</b> <b>crops</b> are {{cultivated}} {{primarily for}} bioenergy production, {{but can also}} have wider benefits to agriculture and the environment. Policies put {{in place in the}} UK and Europe have promoted bioenergy and the growth of <b>energy</b> <b>crops.</b> Despite the various policy support mechanisms the cultivation of perennial <b>energy</b> <b>crops</b> has proceeded at a low rate. This study rigorously analyses some of the key UK bioenergy policies since 1990 to assess why perennial <b>energy</b> <b>crops</b> have not fulfilled their potential. The UK <b>energy</b> <b>crops</b> market is scrutinised and shows the industry is still nascent compared to Government aspirations. Case studies of both successful and unsuccessful projects are evaluated to reveal how effective different policies have been in establishing UK perennial <b>energy</b> <b>crops.</b> This original review shows significantly that none of the projects, initiatives or schemes described can be viewed as an absolute success. The main obstacles that have hindered progress include: the lack of long term supportive <b>energy</b> <b>crops</b> policy, the failure of headline projects and organisations, the lack of competitiveness of long term perennial crop options compared to annual crops, bureaucracy of schemes, over-ambitious projects, and large-scale support schemes tending to favour imported biomass rather than support domestic supply. 25 years of failed <b>energy</b> <b>crops</b> policy suggests {{there needs to be a}} long term strategy.

Therefore, we studied {{the effect of}} drought, salinity, phosphorus (P) deficiency, and sulfur (S) deficiency on leaf N estimates derived from SPAD and LCC measurements in a greenhouse experiment. Linear relations between chlorophyll concentration and leaf N concentration based on dry weight (Ndw) between SPAD values adjusted for leaf thickness and Ndw and between LCC scores adjusted for leaf thickness and Ndw could be confirmed for all treatments and varieties used. Leaf spectral reflectance measurements did not show a stress-dependent change in the reflectance pattern, indicating that no specific element of the photosynthetic complex was affected by the stresses and at the stress level applied. We concluded that SPAD and LCC are potentially useful tools for improved N management in moderately unfavorable rice environments. However, calibration for the most common rice varieties in the target region is recommended to increase the precision of the leaf N estimates...|$|R

40|$|The {{production}} of biofuel feedstocks result in greenhouse gas fluxes {{to the atmosphere}} {{as a result of}} fertilizer application, land management practices and land use changes. While the life cycle greenhouse gas emissions associated with feedstock conversion to liquid fuels through final combustion are fairly well understood, emissions from agricultural lands used to grow feedstocks for biofuel production continue to be poorly accounted for in life cycle assessment. There exists a lot of variability in the results reported to date due to dependence of trace gas fluxes on soil, weather, management practices and plant type. ^ This study evaluates the soil biogeochemical model DAYCENT for six bioenergy cropping systems and provides a framework for calculating the lifecycle greenhouse gas emissions combining the soil emissions from DAYCENT with the life cycle emissions from GREET. Indirect land use change emissions from the GTAP model are added to the total life cycle emissions to fully evaluate the potential of these feedstocks to reduce greenhouse gas emissions. This approach is applied to two counties in Indiana to explore the greenhouse gas fluxes associated with the {{production of}} cellulosic feedstocks; corn stover, miscanthus and switchgrass. ^ Greenhouse gas flux results show that <b>energy</b> <b>crops</b> have higher yields and fare better in terms of emissions reduction, with miscanthus showing great promise due to its carbon sequestration potential. The collection of residues for biofuel production from croplands has higher emission compared to <b>energy</b> <b>crops,</b> due to <b>N</b> 2 O flux from extra fertilizer additions and loss of carbon from the soil. Miscanthus has the highest reduction compared with gasoline (90 - 95 %), followed by switchgrass (56 - 60 %), and corn stover (33 - 69 %) for the two conversion pathways considered. ^ The study provides a holistic framework for the estimation of emissions associated with cellulosic biofuel production that is more complete than any other previous analysis.

40|$|The {{objective}} {{of this paper is}} to present a broad overview of the potential environmental impacts of biomass <b>energy</b> from <b>energy</b> <b>crops</b> [...] particularly the cellulosic <b>energy</b> <b>crops</b> current under development. For this discussion, the term <b>energy</b> <b>crop</b> refers to a crop grown primarily to create feedstock for either making biofuels such as ethanol or burning in a heat or electricity generation facility. Cellulosic <b>energy</b> <b>crops</b> are designed to be used in cellulose-based ethanol conversion processes (as opposed to starch or sugar-based ethanol conversion processes). As more cellulose can be produced per hectare of land than can sugar or starch, the cellulose-based ethanol conversion process is a more efficient sue of land for ethanol production. Assessing the environmental impacts of biomass <b>energy</b> from <b>energy</b> <b>crops</b> is complex because the environmental impact of using biomass for energy must be considered in the context of alternative energy options while the environmental impact of producing biomass from <b>energy</b> <b>crops</b> must be considered in the context of alternative land-uses. Using biomass-derived energy can reduce greenhouse gas emissions or increase them; growing biomass <b>energy</b> <b>crops</b> can enhance soil fertility or degrade it. Without knowing the context of the biomass energy, one can say little about its specific environmental impacts. The primary focus of this paper is an evaluation of the environmental impacts of growing cellulosic <b>energy</b> <b>crops</b> especially at the landscape or regional scale. However, to set the stage for this discussion, the authors begin by comparing the environmental advantages and disadvantages of biomass-derived energy relative to other energy alternatives such as coal, hydropower, nuclear power, oil/gasoline, natural gas and photovoltaics...|$|R
