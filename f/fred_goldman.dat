50|$|With {{her husband}} imprisoned Chynoweth {{began to change}} her mind about {{polygamy}} and left the Church of the Lamb of God. In 1990, knowing that it was highly unlikely that she would be tried again, she published a “breezy, tell all memoir” about her life with Ervil LeBaron in which she admitted to shooting Rulon Allred. While being interviewed on Sally, Chynoweth was served with a summons to answer civil charges of causing the unlawful death of Rulon C Allred. The charges were filed by the Allred family who still sought justice for Rulon’s death. The trial took place in February 1992. Chynoweth did not appear at the trial as she claimed that the Lambs of God were still after her for leaving the church. Chynoweth was found liable for the wrongful death of Rulon Allred and ordered to pay $52 million in damages to the Allred family. The Allreds never collected the money. <b>Fred</b> <b>Goldman</b> later cited this case as a precedent for not collecting any money from his son’s death when O. J. Simpson was found liable for the wrongful death of Ron Goldman.|$|E
