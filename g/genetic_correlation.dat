The summation of these effect sizes into a polygenic risk score can explain at least 7% of the variability in liability for schizophrenia. Around 5% of cases of schizophrenia are understood to be at least partially attributable to rare copy number variants (CNVs), including 22q11, 1q21 and 16p11. These rare CNVs increase the risk of an individual developing the disorder by as much as 20-fold, and are frequently comorbid with autism and intellectual disabilities. There is a genetic relation between the common variants which cause schizophrenia and bipolar disorder, an inverse <b>genetic</b> <b>correlation</b> with intelligence and no <b>genetic</b> <b>correlation</b> with immune disorders.|$|E
2500|$|Though the {{evolution}} of exaggerated male traits {{as a result of}} female mate choice was at one point controversial, the Diopsidae are now regarded as a classic example of animals that exhibit sexually selected traits. [...] One view maintains that male ornaments co-evolve with female preferences. [...] The selection of an ornamented mate causes genes that influence expression of the selected male trait and genes coding for female preference for this trait to be passed on to offspring [...] This process creates linkage disequilibrium between selected alleles, with the magnitude of resulting genetic correlations influencing evolutionary outcomes. [...] If the <b>genetic</b> <b>correlation</b> is high relative to the heritability of the male ornament, then a runaway process can occur leading to extreme sexually selected traits, such as the incredible eye spans observed in male stalk-eyed flies. [...] Otherwise, the trait and preference for the trait increase until viability natural selection against further trait elaboration balances sexual selection.|$|E
