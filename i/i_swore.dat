5|$|The first Persian {{invasion}} was {{a response}} to Greek involvement in the Ionian Revolt, when the Eretrians and Athenians had sent a force to support the cities of Ionia in their attempt to overthrow Persian rule. The Eretrian and Athenian force had succeeded in capturing and burning Sardis (the regional capital of Persia), but was then forced to retreat with heavy losses. In response to this raid, the Persian king Darius <b>I</b> <b>swore</b> to have revenge on Athens and Eretria.|$|E

2500|$|Anderson {{moved to}} Los Angeles in 1992, {{and spent a}} year auditioning. The same year, she {{appeared}} in her first feature-length film The Turning, starring Karen Allen and Tess Harper – the film drama is an adaptation of the play Home Fires Burning. Although she had once vowed she would never do television, being {{out of work for}} a year changed her mind. Anderson recalled: [...] "First of all, <b>I</b> <b>swore</b> I'd never move to Los Angeles, and once I did, <b>I</b> <b>swore</b> I'd never do television. It was only after being out of work for almost a year that I began going in [...] on some stuff that I would pray that I wouldn't get because I didn't {{want to be involved in}} it." [...] She broke into mainstream television in 1993, with a guest appearance on the collegiate drama, Class of '96, on the fledgling Fox Network.|$|E
2500|$|The next verse, [...] "And I {{will bring}} you into the land which <b>I</b> <b>swore</b> to give to Abraham, to Isaac, and to Jacob; I will {{give it to you}} for a possession. I am the Lord." [...] (...) was not {{fulfilled}} until the generation following the Passover story, and the rabbis could not decide whether this verse counted as part of the Passover celebration (thus deserving of another serving of wine). Thus, a cup was left for the arrival of Elijah.|$|E

[...] says: [...] "And the Lord said to him (Moses): ‘This is the land that <b>I</b> <b>swore</b> to Abraham, to Isaac, and to Jacob, saying [...] [...] [...] [...]'" [...] Rabbi Samuel ben Nahman reasoned that the word [...] "saying" [...] here indicates that just before Moses died, God told Moses to say to Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob that God had carried out the oath that God had sworn to them. The Gemara explained that God told Moses to tell them so that they might be grateful to Moses for what he had done for their descendants.|$|E

2500|$|During {{his rule}} in Kabul, {{when there was}} a time of {{relative}} peace, Babur pursued his interests in literature, art, music and gardening. Previously, he never drank alcohol and avoided it when he was in Herat. In Kabul, he first tasted it at the age of thirty. He then began to drink regularly, host wine parties and consume preparations made from opium. Though religion had a central place in his life, Babur also approvingly quoted a line of poetry by one of his contemporaries: [...] "I am drunk, officer. Punish me when I am sober". He quit drinking for health reasons before the Battle of Khanwa, just two years before his death, and demanded that his court do the same. But he did not stop chewing narcotic preparations, and did not lose his sense of irony. He wrote, [...] "Everyone regrets drinking and swears an oath (of abstinence); <b>I</b> <b>swore</b> the oath and regret that." ...|$|E
2500|$|Nakasone {{describes}} his early childhood and youth as a happy one, and {{himself as a}} [...] "quiet, easy-going child" [...] nicknamed [...] "Yat-chan". He attended a local primary school in Takasaki and was a poor student until the fourth grade, after which he excelled and {{was at the top}} of his class. He entered Shizuoka High School in 1935, where he excelled in history and literature and learned to speak fluent French. In the autumn of 1938, Nakasone entered Tokyo Imperial University. During World War II, he was a commissioned officer and paymaster in the Imperial Japanese Navy. He later wrote of his return to Tokyo in August 1945 after Japan's surrender: [...] "I stood vacantly amid the ruins of Tokyo, after discarding my officer's short sword and removing the epaulettes of my uniform. As I looked around me <b>I</b> <b>swore</b> to resurrect my homeland from the ashes of defeat". Nakasone is the only postwar Prime Minister to have seen active service.|$|E
