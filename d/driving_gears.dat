50|$|Roy Fedden, Bristol's primary engine designer, became {{interested}} in the concept and by 1927 he had constructed a working two-cylinder V as a test bed, with the idea of developing it into a V-12. Problems cropped up on the design, notably the sleeves bursting during the power stroke and stripping their <b>driving</b> <b>gears.</b> A long series of tests and materials changes and improvements required six years and an estimated £2 million to cure. By 1933, the problems had been worked out and the Perseus {{went on to become the}} first sleeve valve aero-engine in the world, to be put into large quantity production.|$|E
50|$|As evening rush-hour approached, {{escalator}} #4 {{was turned}} on at 16:30 Moscow time. As the first commuters {{began to use}} it to descend, a poorly-attached step came loose, completing the cycle of coming all the way down and then back up on {{the opposite end of the}} chain. At 17:00, as it passed the upper mechanism, it got stuck and deformed the upper working gears and rods. This broke the clutch between the <b>driving</b> <b>gears</b> of the engine, and the thread, now free to move in any direction, began to accelerate from the weight of the passengers. Automatically the engine was immediately turned off and the brakes were applied. However, the standard working brakes lacked the strength to stop the momentum of the thread (heavily laden with passengers at this rush-hour), or even to reduce its acceleration.|$|E

40|$|The wabble gear {{principle}} {{was applied}} {{in the design of}} a driving mechanism for controlling spacecraft solar panels. The moving elements, other than the output gear, are contained within a hermetically sealed package to prevent escape of lubricants and ingestion of contaminant particles. The <b>driving</b> <b>gear</b> contains one more tooth than the output gear on a concave, conical pitch surface of slightly larger apex angle. The two gears mesh face to face such that engagement takes place at one point along the circumference. The <b>driving</b> <b>gear</b> is not permitted to rotate by virtue of its attachment through the bellows which permits flexure in the pitch and yaw position, but not in roll. As the bearing carrier rotates, the inclined mounting of the bearing causes the <b>driving</b> <b>gear</b> to perform a wabbling, irrotational motion. This wabbling motion causes the contact point between the output <b>gear</b> and the <b>driving</b> <b>gear</b> to traverse around the circumference of the gears once per revolution of the bearing carrier...|$|R

40|$|This book {{chapter is}} closed access. The {{internal}} combustion engine produces a fluctuating torque due to combustion as well as induced inertial imbalance in the reciprocating motion of pistons. When the clutch is engaged, the resulting torsional oscillations of the crankshaft are transmitted to the transmission. In the transmission the fixed <b>driving</b> <b>gears</b> (pinions) transfer the motion to the driven unselected gears (loose gears) through impacting teeth pairs in close proximity due to the compact nature of modern transmission systems. The driven gears in turn rotate freely on their bearings, as they are unselected (referred to as loose gears). As a result, the idle (loose) gears oscillate within their backlash limits, leading to impacts with the <b>driving</b> <b>gears.</b> The vibrations caused by these impacts are transferred through the transmission shafts and their support bearings to the transmission bell housing, and is mostly radiated as sound that resembles the noise produced when a marble rolls inside a metallic can. This sound is onomatopoeically referred to as rattle...|$|E

40|$|Noise {{produced}} by components in a diesel affect {{the quality of}} the engine noise. One component source related to consumer complaints is gear rattle. Gear rattle is caused by gear tooth impacts resulting from fluctuations in differential torsional acceleration of the <b>driving</b> <b>gears.</b> Previous work in this area has focused on rating the overall sound quality of diesel engines without specifically focusing on models for predicting the perception of gear rattle. Here, a method to generate sounds having different levels of gear rattle is described. First, diesel engine noise recordings were analyzed to determine the engine speed time histories; they were then used to guide gear impact timing and to generate gear noise components. The gear noise transfer paths were then tuned {{to improve the quality of}} the gear noise predictions. The gear noise simulation tool is presently being used to generate sounds for subjective tests designed to quantify the detectability, perception of growth, and annoyance of gear rattle. The noise prediction coupled with the sound quality models based on the analysis of the subjective data will provide a way to predict how people perceive gear rattle so that component noise targets can be set directly related to human perception...|$|E
40|$|Component {{sound quality}} is an {{important}} factor in the design of competitive diesel engines. One component noise that causes complaints is the gear rattle that originates in the front-of-engine gear train which drives the fuel pump and other accessories. The rattle is caused by repeated tooth impacts resulting from fluctuations in differential torsional acceleration of the <b>driving</b> <b>gears.</b> These impacts generate a broadband, impulsive noise that is often perceived as annoying. In most previous work, the overall sound quality of diesel engines has been considered without specifically focusing on predicting the perception of gear rattle. Gear rattle level has been quantified based on angular acceleration measurements, but those measurements can be difficult to perform. Here, the emphasis was on developing a metric based on subjective testing of the perception of gear rattle. In the first part of the present work, a method to simulate gear rattle noise and incorporate it into a no-gear-rattle (baseline) recording was developed. That procedure enabled controlled variation of rattle within the total engine noise signal. The simulations were then used in a psychoacoustic test that was designed to quantify detectable levels, perception of growth, and increase in annoyance due to the presence of gear rattle noise. Forty subjects participated in the threshold detection tests and a paired comparison annoyance test. The responses of people who reported having experience with diesel engines were compared to those of a more general population. The subjects with diesel engine experience were found to be better at detecting gear rattle noise and found rattle more annoying than the other subjects, particularly at high rattle levels. Current work is focused on development of metrics that accurately reflect human responses to gear rattle...|$|E
50|$|The {{driving wheels}} of the S6 had the rather unusual {{diameter}} of 2,100 mm {{in order to keep}} the rpm down and to guarantee the smooth running of the <b>driving</b> <b>gear.</b> Originally a diameter of 2,200 mm had been planned, but in the end it was reduced by 100 mm. The heavy balancing masses of the <b>driving</b> <b>gear</b> were badly affected by weight savings. That resulted in serious jerkiness when running. A remedy was achieved by coupling the tender closer to the locomotive and thus raising the compression of the buffer springs.|$|R

Evidences suggest that the key of the right coupling had sheared off sometime in the past.

40|$|Fractographic study {{confirmed}} that the <b>driving</b> <b>gear</b> of the multiplicator had failed by fatigue. There was multiple fatigue crack initiation and in all the cases, the fatigue crack had initiated at the tooth root. In two cases, the teeth got fractured and lost by tooth bending fatigue. In another case, after initiation, the fatigue crack had propagated into {{the hub of the}} gear and continued propagation further along the hub fillet. After propagation to a critical length, this fatigue crack had resulted in fracturing of a segment of the gear. Following this fracture, the impact with the input gear of the gear cluster had resulted in second fracture and chewing off of remaining teeth in the <b>driving</b> <b>gear.</b> Subsequently, the gear assembly had seized leading to torsional overload failure of the quill shaft transmitting power from the AGB to the multiplicator. The fatigue failure in the <b>driving</b> <b>gear</b> appears to be stress related. Evidences suggest that probably, the load on the gear assembly was more than the usual. The power transmission system down the multiplicator needs to be examined as a whole for establishing the cause(s) for excessive load on the gear assembly...|$|R

40|$|In {{continuation}} of the earlier investigation on the IGB failure of a helicopter (NAL Report No: MT-FA- 937 - 06 - 2005), a few more components were examined to establish the cause of excessive load on the gears. Observations revealed that the <b>driving</b> <b>gear</b> failure was initiated due to minute oscillatory motion (slip) between the shaft and the bore of the roller bearing (45 mm inner dia). This was evident from the fretting on the <b>driving</b> <b>gear</b> shaft {{as well as the}} inner race of the roller bearing. Analysis suggests that excessive surface undulations on the shaft and/or bore of the bearing would have promoted fretting. The excessive load on the tooth flank appears to be due to slip between the shaft and the roller bearing. This slip would have also resulted in improper meshing of the gears...|$|R
