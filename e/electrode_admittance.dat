40|$|The {{reliability}} of different <b>electrode</b> <b>admittance</b> equations {{in the case}} of the Ag/Ag I electrode is critically discussed. It is shown that the admittance equation already derived for the metal amalgam/metal-Ion reversible electrode reaction coupled with reactant adsorption offers some advantages compared to the admittance equation for the reversible electrode reaction on the metal/metal-ion electrode. New results of impedance measurements of the Ag/Ag I electrode are reported...|$|E
40|$|Equations {{are derived}} for the {{interfacial}} admittance of an electrode {{at which the}} electrode reaction O+neR occurs assuming that the charge transfer is infinitely fast and that either O or R {{is involved in a}} first-order homogeneous reaction delivering the substance Y, or that both O and R are involved in a catalytic reaction. If, moreover, adsorption of O and R or Y at the electrode surface is assumed, rather, more complicated expressions are obtained. A number of simpler limiting cases are treated in more detail and it is concluded that in many practical cases the corresponding reduced equations describe the <b>electrode</b> <b>admittance</b> with sufficient precisio...|$|E
40|$|Periodic current {{oscillations}} during anodic {{dissolution of}} monocrystalline p-Si(100) in buffered ammonium fluoride solutions (0. 1 mol dm(- 3) fluoride, pH 4. 5) were investigated using a flow cell {{in order to}} eliminate mass transport limitations. The flow cell was designed to permit simultaneous in-situ ellipsometry, impedance and potential modulated microwave reflectivity measurements. Analysis of the ellipsometric response showed that the current oscillations are accompanied by a synchronous variation of the overall oxide thickness with an amplitude of 4. 5 +/- 0. 1 nn. Analysis {{of the relationship between}} the total oxide thickness and the current during the oscillation cycle shows that to a first approximation the rate of chemical dissolution of anodic oxide remains constant. Oscillations of the <b>electrode</b> <b>admittance</b> and potential modulated microwave reflectivity were also measured. The imaginary component of the admittance is related to the oscillation in thickness of a narrow inner region of 'dry' oxide and to changes in the accumulation capacitance. The oscillation in the potential modulated microwave reflectivity is interpreted in terms of the changes in the density of holes accumulated at the p-Si SiO 2 interface. (C) 2001 Elsevier Science B.

40|$|A {{multichannel}} logger {{for long-term}} measurements of sweat activity is presented. The logger uses skin surface <b>electrodes</b> for unipolar <b>admittance</b> measurements in the stratum corneum. The logger is developed {{with emphasis on}} clinical use. The portability of the logger enables recording of sweat activity under circumstances such as daily errands, exercise and sleep. Measurements have been done on 24 healthy volunteers during relaxation and exercise with heart rate monitoring. Recordings of sweat activity during sleep have been done on two healthy subjects. Early results show good agreement with the literature on sweating physiology and electrodermal activity. Results are presented showing measurements related to physical exercise, dermatomes, distribution of sweat glands and sympathetic activity. This study examines the normal sweating patterns for the healthy population, and we present results with the first 24 healthy volunteers. Comparing these results with similar measurements on hyperhidrosis patients {{will make it possible}} to find the most useful parameters for diagnosis and treatment evaluation...|$|R
40|$|This paper {{presents}} {{a new system}} for measuring water conductivity {{as a function of}} electrophysical property (admittance). The system is cheap and its manufacturing is easy. In addition, it dose not require any sort of electrolysis and calibration. The system consists of four electrodes made of silver (Ag 92. 5 g to Cu 7. 5 g) fixed in a plastic tube filled by water which allows the use of two and four <b>electrode</b> setups. The <b>admittance</b> (reciprocal of impedance) is measured for different water sources (distilled, rainfall, mineral, river and tap water) using different frequencies between 50 Hz and 100 kHz. These measurements were taken twice, once with four electrodes and another with two electrodes of two modes (inner and outer electrodes). The results have shown good correlation between the measured admittance and the conductivity of all the water sources and the best correlation was found at low frequencies between 50 Hz and 20 kHz. The highest efficiency can be achieved by performing the four electrodes system which allows circumventing the effect of the electrode impedance. This result makes the system efficient compared to traditional conductivity meters which usually require high frequencies for good operation. doi: 10. 5617 /jeb. 203 J Electr Bioimp, vol. 2, pp. 86 - 92, 2011 ...|$|R
40|$|International audienceDuring {{the last}} decade, piezoelectric-based microresonators {{have shown a}} great {{interest}} in the micro electromechanical systems (MEMS) field, especially for biosensing applications. Micromembranes have revealed a particular potential for biological experiments [1]. In order to optimize their design, the analytical modeling of their dynamic behavior is of critical importance. We report the elaboration of an analytical model for the case of a micromembrane with piezoelectric actuation and detection vibrating either in air or in a viscous fluid. The model, based on an equivalent electrical circuit, enables the computation of specific characteristics like mass sensitivity, resonance frequency and minimum detectable mass. The model was established for a five-layer stack membrane with a circular lead zirconate titanate 46 / 54 PbZrxTi 1 -xO 3 (PZT) active cell (Fig 1). The method was based on the separation of the membrane's electromechanical behaviour into three parts. First, a purely mechanical transfer function, linking the force exerted on the membrane by the piezoelectric layer to the relative displacement of the membrane, was determined[2]. Then, the actuation coupling coefficient was determined by relating the applied voltage and moment applied to the membrane [3]. Finally, the sense electromechanical coupling coefficient is found linking the deflection of the membrane and the resulting charge creation at output <b>electrode.</b> The global <b>admittance,</b> resulting from the merging of the three previous parameters corresponds to an equivalent electrical circuit modeling the vibrations of the piezoelectric membrane in air. We also realised the implementation of the model for the case of vibration in a viscous fluid by adding two extra equivalent electrical components modelling the effects of the surrounding fluid (a. k. a fluidic resistance and inductance) respectively corresponding to the damping and added mass induced by the fluid. The final equivalent electrical circuit allows the determination of theoretical values for the membranes' characteristics as biosensors. The fabrication process has been described in details elsewhere [4] and a top view of a membrane's chip is shown on fig 2. The dynamic behaviours of fabricated membranes, with a 100 µm global radius and piezoelectric cell radius of 30, 50 and 70 µm, have been extracted experimentally. The curves for real and imaginative part of the complex admittance were obtained with a HP 4294 A impedance analyzer. The comparison between experimental and theoretical behaviour is reported for the three types of membranes and good agreement between the theoretical experimental curves is observed for the case of vibrations in air (Fig 3). In the case of operation in fluid, good accordance in amplitude is observed even though a constant shift in frequency (8 %) between theoretical and experimental values still remains as shown on fig 4. Work is now under progress to compare the theoretical and the experimental mass sensitivity and minimum detectable mass of the membranes in real biological assays...|$|R
40|$|A new {{detection}} technique called Fast Fourier Transform Square-Wave Voltammetry (FFT SWV) {{is based on}} measurements of <b>electrode</b> <b>admittance</b> {{as a function of}} potential. The response of the detector (microelectrode), which is generated by a redox processes, is fast, which makes the method suitable for most applications involving flowing electrolytes. The carbon paste electrode was modified by nanostructures to improve sensitivity. Synthesized dysprosium nanowires provide a more effective nanotube-like surface [1 - 4] so they are good candidates for use as a modifier for electrochemical reactions. The redox properties of diclofenac were used for its determination in human serum and urine samples. The support electrolyte that provided a more defined and intense peak current for diclofenac determination was a 0. 05 mol L− 1 acetate buffer pH = 4. 0. The drug presented an irreversible oxidation peak at 850 mV vs. Ag/AgCl on a modified nanowire carbon paste electrode which produced high current and reduced the oxidation potential by about 100 mV. Furthermore, the signal-to-noise ratio was significantly increased by application of a discrete Fast Fourier Transform (FFT) method, background subtraction and two-dimensional integration of the electrode response over a selected potential range and time window. To obtain the much sensivity the effective parameters such as frequency, amplitude and pH was optimized. As a result, CDL of 2. 0 × 10 − 9 M and an LOQ of 5. 0 × 10 − 9 M were found for the determination for diclofenac. A good recovery was obtained for assay spiked urine samples and a good quantification of diclofenac was achieved in a commercial formulation...|$|E
