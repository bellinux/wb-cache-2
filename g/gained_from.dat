Applying a heterogenous Ã–rm model we simulate {{trade integration}} in Asia {{in three different}} scenarios (CIFTA, ASEAN+ 3, and ASEAN+ 6). The paper makes three contributions to the literature. First, in addition to traditional <b>gains</b> <b>from</b> specialisation, we also account for <b>gains</b> arising <b>from</b> increased number of different varieties. Second, we explicitly account for diÂ§erences in trade gains between variable and fixed trade cost reduction. Third, using {{a unique set of}} firm-level panel data we estimate the underlying trade modelÃ­s structural parameters econometrically. We find that the <b>gains</b> <b>from</b> trade integration are substantial. Reducing trade barriers by 15 percent induces trade growth up to 60 percent, which due to the additional extensive margin is more than in trade models with representative firms. Similarly, due due additional welfare <b>gains</b> <b>from</b> variety growth, the <b>gains</b> <b>from</b> trade are up to 17 percent higher than in models with homogenous products.

40|$|The {{theory of}} {{international}} trade is rich in reasons why countries may <b>gain</b> <b>from</b> trade. In this paper we investigate whether new sources of <b>gains</b> <b>from</b> trade necessarily lead to larger <b>gains</b> <b>from</b> trade. The main contribution of our paper {{is to show that}} for a particular but important class of models, independently of the number of channels through which countries may <b>gain</b> <b>from</b> trade, the total size of the <b>gains</b> <b>from</b> trade is pinned down by the value of two su ¢ cient statistics: (i) the share of expenditure on domestic goods; and (ii) a gravity-based estimate of the elasticity of imports with respect to variable trade costs. Accordingly, the mapping from observed trade data to the total size of the <b>gains</b> <b>from</b> trade is independent of the details of the model we use. Although it may be tempting to conclude that richer trade models necessarily entail larger <b>gains</b> <b>from</b> trade, our theoretical analysis demonstrates {{that this is not the}} case.
