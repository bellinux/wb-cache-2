The text recommends restraining oneself from salt, mustard, acidic foods, spicy astringent pungent foods. The text also states that the yoga student should avoid fasting, early morning baths, sexual intercourse, and sitting near fire. Milk and ghee (clarified butter), cooked wheat, <b>green</b> <b>gram</b> and rice are foods the text approves of, in verses 46–49.

K 4 K 3 When {{a company}} or persons or {{individuals}} invests time, money {{and other resources}} in a project, the primary concern is what they are getting in return, for their investments. Statistics regarding agribusiness projects in Kinango which include maize, sorghum, cowpeas, <b>green</b> <b>grams</b> and cassava have shown that their performance are below expectations in terms of output and financial returns. In addition, current production per hectare of the agribusiness projects in question is lower compared to potential production per hectare thus resulting to low gross margin per acre. Food insecurity in Kinango area is very high hence {{the need to improve}} performance of agribusiness projects thus increasing-output and financial returns in order to address hunger, dependency on relief food and prevailing extreme poverty levels and poor socio-economic welfare of the rural fork. Agribusiness projects' performance depend on adherence to the principles of project management which include: needs establishments from all the stakeholders; sound planning; effective organizational frame work; effective implementation strategies; monitoring and control and finally evaluation. The researcher's study therefore sought to assess the effects of project management principles to performance of agribusiness projects in Kinango area of Kwale County. The study used descriptive research design. Data collected to help answer the research questions of the study included: the percentage of application of principles of project management to all agribusiness projects (maize, cassava, cowpeas, <b>green</b> <b>grams</b> and sorghum); the percentage of application of principles of project management per project and each agribusiness project pertormance in terms of oUtPUI variation and financial returns variation, The population under consideration waj 5 mixed farming households in Kinango area of Kwale County who adds up to 7, 519. The researcher used stratified sampling procedure to determine the sample size since different farmers' undertake different agribusiness projects hence a partitioned sample frame existed. In order to collect meaningful and unbiased data, the study used questionnaire, interview and observation as the data collection tools. Data analysis included sorting, cleaning and organization of data from the field questionnaires. The information was coded and entered into a spread sheet and analyzed using SPSS (statistical package for social sciences). The data was analyzed using both qualitative and quantitative techniques. The data was presented using descriptive statistics, percentages and frequency tables. The study established that quality project management practices which included planning, risks assessment, needs establishment, effective and efficient plan implementation, effective organizational framework, monitoring, controlling and evaluation of the projects' results promoted the performance of agribusiness projects but the respondents (80. 4...|$|R

With land fragmentation, resource conflicts are likely to arise. For the Turkana pastoralist, the communal land tenure system is pivotal to livelihood security because it allows for livestock mobility to take advantage of pasture and water resources that are only seasonally accessible (Kameri-Mbote 2013). Turkana herders own a wide range of indigenous livestock species, which are selected on the basis of survival and productivity and are well adaptation to the prevailing climatic conditions (Notenbaert et al. 2007).
