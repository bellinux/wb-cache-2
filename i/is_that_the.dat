5|$|A {{consequence}} of this design <b>is</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> m-derived half section will match a k-type section on one side only. Also, an m-type section of one value of m will not match another m-type section of another value of m except on the sides which offer the Zi of the k-type.|$|E
5|$|A {{detailed}} topographic {{analysis of}} the Hawaiian – Emperor seamount chain reveals the hotspot {{as the center of}} a topographic high, and that elevation falls with distance from the hotspot. The most rapid decrease in elevation and the highest ratio between the topography and geoid height are over the southeastern part of the chain, falling with distance from the hotspot, particularly at the intersection of the Molokai and Murray fracture zones. The most likely explanation <b>is</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> region between the two zones is more susceptible to reheating than most of the chain. Another possible explanation <b>is</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> hotspot strength swells and subsides over time.|$|E
5|$|A further {{complication}} <b>is</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> Pictish Chronicle says Amlaíb {{was killed}} in battle in Scotland, whereas the sagas say Olaf {{was killed in}} battle in Ireland. Hudson proposes a solution for this apparent contradictionthe Vikings did not distinguish between the Gaelic peoples of Scotland and Ireland.|$|E
50|$|Equivalent {{conditions}} <b>are</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> line bundle KX <b>is</b> big, or <b>that</b> <b>the</b> d-canonical map <b>is</b> generically injective (<b>that</b> <b>is,</b> a birational map to its image) for d sufficiently large.|$|R
25|$|The {{result of}} the 1845 Bill {{submission}} <b>was</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> preamble <b>was</b> proved but <b>that</b> <b>the</b> Committee stage in the House of Lords rejected the Bill: this meant <b>that</b> <b>the</b> desirability of the line <b>was</b> accepted, but <b>that</b> <b>the</b> detail of Moorsom's design was considered unsafe.|$|R
30|$|One {{reason of}} these {{increases}} might <b>be</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> impact of FTO substrate samples {{on the environment}} is reduced, in which the process was in a nitrogen-filled glovebox while the reported process was in the air. The second reason might <b>be</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> resistivity of the ITO substrate increases after annealing treatment at high temperature while the resistivity of the FTO substrate does not. For ITO, the oxygen hole as carrier reduction causes the decrease of conductivity after annealing. The third reason might <b>be</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> light transmittance of the FTO substrate was a little higher than <b>that</b> of <b>the</b> ITO substrate.|$|R
5|$|A general {{drawback}} of conduction {{through a}} wall technologies <b>is</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> retorts are more costly when scaled-up due to the resulting large amount of heat conducting walls made of high-temperature alloys.|$|E
5|$|A major {{difference}} from the US Navy tables <b>is</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> repetitive group designators represent nitrogen levels in all tissues, unlike the USN table which represent only the 120-minute compartment. The Huggins repetitive group indicates {{a percentage of the}} M0 for the most saturated tissue, and this is intended to make the tables more applicable to multilevel diving procedures.|$|E
5|$|A {{major problem}} in sending space probes to Jupiter <b>is</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> planet has no solid surface on which to land, {{as there is a}} smooth {{transition}} between the planet's atmosphere and its fluid interior. Any probes descending into the atmosphere are eventually crushed by the immense pressures within Jupiter.|$|E

30|$|Here it has <b>been</b> {{observed}} <b>that</b> <b>the</b> {{weighted average}} of CN is increasing, and from graph also it <b>is</b> observed <b>that</b> <b>the</b> run-off <b>is</b> increasing from 1990 to 2009. So it has <b>been</b> concluded <b>that</b> <b>the</b> run-off will increase if the CN increases.|$|R
50|$|A common motif in {{propaganda}} <b>was</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> Soviet Union <b>was</b> peace-loving.|$|R
5|$|A {{mirror on}} the back wall {{reflects}} the upper bodies and heads of two figures identified from other paintings, and by Palomino, as King PhilipIV(10) and Queen Mariana(11). The most common assumption <b>is</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> reflection shows the couple in the pose they are holding for Velázquez as he paints them, while their daughter watches; and that the painting therefore shows {{their view of the}} scene.|$|E
5|$|A recent (2005) {{hypothesis}} <b>is</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> star of Bethlehem was {{a supernova}} or hypernova {{occurring in the}} nearby Andromeda Galaxy. Although {{it is difficult to}} detect a supernova remnant in another galaxy, or obtain an accurate date of when it occurred, supernovae remnants have been detected in Andromeda.|$|E
5|$|Additionally, {{civilian}} vessels produce sonar {{waves in}} order to measure the depth of the body of water in which they are. Similar to the navy, some boats produce waves that attract porpoises, while others may repel them. The problem with the waves that attract <b>is</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> animal may be injured or even killed by being hit by the vessel or its propeller.|$|E
50|$|Expectation <b>was</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> boat {{could achieve}} more than 200 mph or 320 kmh.|$|R
50|$|Another troubling issue <b>was</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> patents had {{two years}} to run, so <b>that</b> it <b>was</b> {{unlikely}} <b>that</b> <b>the</b> final judgment could occur during {{the life of the}} patents. Some justices wondered whether it was worthwhile to decide the case in light of this factor.|$|R

5|$|Although the Deseret {{alphabet}} has letter case, {{the only}} difference between the minuscule and majuscule forms <b>is</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> majuscule forms are larger.|$|E
5|$|An {{alternative}} hypothesis suggest that lenticulae are actually small areas of chaos {{and that the}} claimed pits, spots and domes are artefacts resulting from over-interpretation of early, low-resolution Galileo images.

5|$|Another {{aspect of}} the hospice {{philosophy}} <b>is</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> care is patient-centered, to treat the whole patient. Many healthcare agencies in the US market themselves as patient-centered; for hospice, this patient-directed care is integral and interwoven throughout the care which is provided. Related Medicare regulations reflect this philosophy.|$|E

5|$|Early {{drafts of}} the novel {{entitled}} Trimalchio: An Early Version of The Great Gatsby have been published. A notable difference between the Trimalchio draft and The Great Gatsby is a less complete failure of Gatsby's dream in Trimalchio.

25|$|The Slovak National Uprising {{was mostly}} {{crushed by the}} time Soviet units secured Slovak territories; {{one of the main}} reasons for it <b>was</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> German {{resistance}} in the Dukla Pass was much heavier than expected. Another factor <b>was</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> Slovak insurgent forces failed to secure the other side of the pass, as planned by the Slovak and Soviet commanders during early preparations.|$|R
25|$|<b>The</b> general {{conclusion}} <b>was</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> present procurement regimes are counter productive towards {{the efforts of}} CSME. The dismal picture painted by {{the findings of the}} CARICOM research project demonstrated the dire need for comprehensive procurement reform. One of the significant recommendations of <b>the</b> project <b>was</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> proposed regional and domestic public procurement legislative and policy reforms should be based on the UNCITRAL Model Law.|$|R
5|$|For presentation, one {{suggestion}} <b>is</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> pilchards {{be arranged}} with their tails toward {{the centre of}} the pie and their heads poking up through the crust around the edge. As it includes potatoes and pastry, the pie can be served on its own or with crusty bread, sometimes with vegetables. Other suggested accompaniments are Cornish Yarg cheese, rhubarb chutney, poached eggs or a slice of lemon.|$|E
5|$|Highly {{energetic}} {{chemistry is}} thought to have produced a self-replicating molecule around 4 billion years ago, and half a billion years later the last common ancestor of all life existed.

The beginning of life may have included self-replicating molecules such as RNA and the assembly of simple cells.|$|E
5|$|In Fischer v.
