5|$|On December3, the Regional Specialized Meteorological Centre (RSMC) in Nadi, Fiji, {{upgraded}} {{a tropical}} disturbance, located {{to the west}} of the Solomon Islands, to Tropical Depression 04F. On December5, as the depression moved towards the west into the Fijian archipelago, both the Joint Typhoon Warning Center (JTWC) and RSMC Nadi upgraded it to Cyclone <b>Daman.</b> On December7 the cyclone reached its peak intensity with winds of 185km/h, (115mph 10-minute sustained) which made <b>Daman</b> a Category 4 cyclone on the Australian Tropical Cyclone Intensity Scale. Later that day <b>Daman</b> also reached its peak intensity by 1-minute means with winds of 205km/h (125mph) which made it a Category 3 tropical cyclone on the Saffir-Simpson Hurricane Scale. Early on December8, Cyclone <b>Daman</b> brushed by the Fijian island of Cikobia, causing damage to housing, crops and vegetation. <b>Daman</b> then weakened the next day into a tropical depression and dissipated on December10.|$|E
5|$|Severe Tropical Cyclone <b>Daman</b> (RSMC Nadi {{designation}} 04F, JTWC designation 05P) was {{the strongest}} cyclone of the 2007–08 South Pacific cyclone season. Cyclone <b>Daman</b> was the fourth tropical depression and the first severe tropical cyclone to form east of longitude 180° during the 2007–08 South Pacific cyclone season. Due to {{the severity of the}} storm, the name <b>Daman</b> was retired and replaced with Denia.|$|E
5|$|A {{hurricane}} warning was then declared {{at this time}} for the Yasawa Group, northern Viti Levu, Vanua Levu as well as smaller islands located nearby. Later that day, as <b>Daman</b> reached its peak, all areas of Fiji were under a gale warning. Early on December 7 RSMC Nadi canceled some of the warnings for Fiji, including the gale force warning for southwestern Viti Levu, and then later that day downgraded all the warnings that were still in effect for Fiji to gale force as <b>Daman</b> was weakening.|$|E
5|$|Because {{there were}} no deaths and only 65 people had been {{directly}} affected by Cyclone <b>Daman,</b> the Fijian government, {{with the help of}} the Red Cross, decided not to request any International Aid or any external assistance. The Fijian Government, on January 15, 2008, allocated $530,000 2008FJD for the relief and rehabilitation programme of Cikobia. By August 2008, all work rebuilding Cikobia after Cyclone <b>Daman</b> had been completed.|$|E
5|$|Due to {{the impact}} of this system, the name <b>Daman</b> was {{subsequently}} retired, from the list of names for the region by the World Meteorological Organization.|$|E
5|$|<b>Daman</b> {{did most}} of its damages on Cikobia island, which has a {{population}} of around 120. Damage on Cikobia included extensive damages to houses, school buildings, crops, fruitbearing trees and foliage. Water pipes were damaged by fallen trees as a result of high winds from the storm. Despite initial fears of there being some fatalities on Cikobia, no loss of life was recorded due to the storm. This was because the islands 120 residents had evacuated to caves on Cikobia. The Fijian Dependency of Rotuma experienced a significant amount of rainfall from December 5 until December 7, when Cyclone <b>Daman</b> was located near Rotuma.|$|E
5|$|Early on December 5, RSMC Nadi {{started to}} issue special weather bulletins on Cyclone <b>Daman</b> as a {{tropical}} cyclone gale warning had been issued for the Fijian dependency of Rotuma. Later that morning, as the Cyclone moved over Rotuma, RSMC Nadi issued a tropical cyclone alert {{for the rest}} of Fiji. During that afternoon, RSMC Nadi canceled the tropical cyclone gale warning for Rotuma and then upgraded the cyclone alerts for the northwest of Fiji to a tropical cyclone gale warning later that day. Early the next day, as the storm was intensifying, they upgraded the gale warnings for parts of northwest of Fiji to storm warnings while expanding the warnings to the western and central sides of Viti Levu and the western side of Vanua Levu. During that afternoon RSMC Nadi further revised the warnings as Cyclone <b>Daman</b> had become a severe tropical cyclone.|$|E
5|$|Late on December 2, the Joint Typhoon Warning Center (JTWC) {{started to}} monitor {{an area of}} {{disturbed}} weather that was located within the South Pacific convergence zone to the northwest of Apia, Samoa. Located beneath an anticyclone, the system maintained deep convection near its elongated but well-defined circulation center. Early the next day, the Regional Specialized Meteorological Center in Nadi, Fiji, (RSMC Nadi), started to monitor the area of disturbed weather as Tropical Depression 04F. Over the next two days, the depression moved towards the west, conditions surrounding the depression barely changed {{and as a result}} the depression steadily intensified. Early on December 5, the system had convective bands spiraling into and wrapping tightly around the low level circulation center. As a result of this, the JTWC started advisories on Tropical Cyclone 05P, with winds equivalent to a tropical storm. At 0200UTC, RSMC Nadi reported that the tropical depression had intensified into a category one tropical cyclone on the Australian tropical cyclone intensity scale and named it as <b>Daman.</b> During that day <b>Daman</b> passed over Rotuma island while gradually intensifying further.|$|E
5|$|The latest {{population}} figures {{are based on}} data from the 2011 census of India. During the decade of 20012011, India's annual population growth rate has slowed down from 2.15 percent to 1.76 percent. Based on decennial census data, Dadra and Nagar Haveli have the fastest growth rate of 55.5percent, followed by <b>Daman</b> and Diu (53.5percent), Meghalaya (27.8percent) and Arunachal Pradesh (25.9percent). Nagaland recorded the lowest growth rate of -0.5percent.|$|E
5|$|Mumbai is {{the seat}} of the Bombay High Court, which {{exercises}} jurisdiction over the states of Maharashtra and Goa, and the Union Territories of <b>Daman</b> and Diu and Dadra and Nagar Haveli. Mumbai also has two lower courts, the Small Causes Court for civil matters, and the Sessions Court for criminal cases. Mumbai also has a special Terrorist and Disruptive Activities (TADA) court for people accused of conspiring and abetting acts of terrorism in the city.|$|E
5|$|The {{union territories}} of Andaman and Nicobar, Delhi and Puducherry are headed by lieutenant-governors. Since Delhi and Puducherry have {{a measure of}} {{self-government}} with an elected legislature and council of ministers, {{the role of the}} lieutenant-governor there is a mostly ceremonial one, akin to that of a state's governor. The other four union territories—Chandigarh; Dadra and Nagar Haveli; <b>Daman</b> and Diu; and Lakshadweep—are governed by an administrator. Unlike the administrators of other territories, who are drawn from the Indian Administrative Service, since 1985 the Governor of Punjab has acted as the ex-officio Administrator of Chandigarh.|$|E
5|$|Portugal, in contrast, {{resisted}} diplomatic solutions. It viewed {{its continued}} possession of its Indian enclaves {{as a matter}} of national pride and, in 1951, it amended its constitution to convert its possessions in India into Portuguese provinces. In July 1954, an uprising in Dadra and Nagar Haveli threw off Portuguese rule. The Portuguese attempted to send forces from <b>Daman</b> to reoccupy the enclaves, but were prevented from doing so by Indian troops. Portugal initiated proceedings before the International Court of Justice to compel India to allow its troops access to the enclave, but the Court rejected its complaint in 1960, holding that India was within its rights in denying Portugal military access. In 1961, the Constitution of India was amended to incorporate Dadra and Nagar Haveli into India as a Union Territory.|$|E
5|$|The {{opening of}} the Protestant German Basel Mission of 1834 in Mangalore brought many {{handicraft}} industries, such as cotton weaving and tile-manufacturing, to the region {{and led to a}} large-scale rise in employment. In 1836–37, the political situation in Portugal was in turmoil. Antonio Feliciano de Santa Rita Carvalho, a Portuguese priest, was appointed Archbishop-elect of Goa in September 1836 without authorisation from the then Pope, Gregory XVI. Many Mangalorean Catholics did not accept the leadership of Carvalho but instead submitted to the Vicar Apostolic of Verapoly in Travancore, while some of them continued to be {{under the jurisdiction of the}} Roman Catholic Archdiocese of Goa and <b>Daman.</b> The parishes in South Canara were divided into two groups—one under Goa and the other under Verapoly.|$|E
5|$|The {{integration}} of the princely states {{raised the question of}} the future of the remaining colonial enclaves in India. At independence, the regions of Pondicherry, Karikal, Yanam, Mahe and Chandernagore were still colonies of France, and <b>Daman</b> and Diu, Dadra and Nagar Haveli and Goa remained colonies of Portugal. An agreement between France and India in 1948 provided for an election in France's remaining Indian possessions to choose their political future. A plebiscite held in Chandernagore on 19 June 1949 resulted in a vote of 7,463 to 114 in favour of being integrated with India. It was ceded to India on a de facto basis on 14 August 1949 and de jure on 2 May 1950. In the other enclaves, however, the pro-French camp, led by Edouard Goubert, used the administrative machinery to suppress the pro-merger groups. Popular discontent rose, and in 1954 demonstrations in Yanam and Mahe resulted in pro-merger groups assuming power. A referendum in Pondicherry and Karaikal in October 1954 resulted in a vote in favour of merger, and on 1 November 1954, de facto control over all four enclaves was transferred to the Republic of India. A treaty of cession was signed in May 1956, and following ratification by the French National Assembly in May 1962, de jure control of the enclaves was also transferred.|$|E
25|$|<b>Daman,</b> {{approximately}} 72km2 in area, is at {{the south}} end of Gujarat bordering Maharashtra and just about 193km north of Bombay. The countryside is broken and interspersed with marsh, salt pans, streams, paddy fields, coconut and palm groves. The river <b>Daman</b> Ganga splits the capital city of <b>Daman</b> into halves—Nani <b>Daman</b> (Damão Pequeno) and Moti <b>Daman</b> (Damão Grande). The strategically important features were <b>Daman</b> Fort and the Air Control Tower of <b>Daman</b> Airport.|$|E

25|$|The {{advance on}} the enclave of <b>Daman</b> was {{conducted}} by the 1st Maratha Light Infantry Battalion {{under the command of}} Lieutenant-Colonel SJS Bhonsle in a pre-dawn operation on 18 December. The plan was to capture <b>Daman</b> piecemeal in four phases, to start with the area of the airfield, then progressively to area garden, Nani <b>Daman</b> and finally Moti <b>Daman</b> to include the fort.|$|E
25|$|Peres {{left for}} <b>Daman,</b> another Portuguese enclave, north of Bombay. He was welcomed {{there by the}} constitutionalists and {{supporters}} who still recognised him as prefect. He established a provisional government that lasted until 1837. Peres received arms and armaments from Faria for the defence of <b>Daman,</b> should his opposer's have attacked <b>Daman.</b> In return, Faria was to receive customs exemptions. Being in debt, Rogério de Faria asked for his money back (a sum of Rs. 67,957). The bureaucrats of <b>Daman</b> refused to clear the bills.|$|E
25|$|The Catholics in Goa {{state and}} <b>Daman</b> and Diu union {{territory}} {{are served by}} the Metropolitan Roman Catholic Archdiocese of Goa and <b>Daman,</b> the primatial see of India, in which the titular Patriarchate of the East Indies is vested.|$|E
25|$|Traditional music {{includes}} the instruments surna and <b>daman</b> (shenai and drum).|$|E
25|$|Dadra and Nagar Haveli {{were two}} Portuguese {{landlocked}} exclaves of the <b>Daman</b> district, totally surrounded by Indian territory. The {{connection between the}} exclaves and the coastal territory of <b>Daman</b> {{had to be made}} by crossing about 20km of Indian territory. Dadra and Nagar Haveli did not have any Portuguese military garrison, but only police forces.|$|E
25|$|After India gained {{independence}} from the British in 1947, India requested that Portuguese territories on the Indian subcontinent be ceded to India. Portugal refused to negotiate on the sovereignty of its Indian enclaves. On 19 December 1961, the Indian Army began military operations with Operation Vijay resulting in the annexation of Goa, <b>Daman,</b> and Diu into the Indian union. Goa, along with <b>Daman</b> and Diu, was organised as a centrally administered union territory of India. On 30 May 1987, the union territory was split, and Goa was made India's twenty-fifth state, with <b>Daman</b> and Diu remaining a union territory.|$|E
25|$|Minority of Goans of Luso-Indian descent speak <b>Daman</b> and Diu Portuguese.|$|E
25|$|In the <b>Daman</b> sector, Indian Mysteres flew 14 sorties, {{continuously}} harassing Portuguese artillery positions.|$|E
25|$|Denial of airfields at <b>Daman</b> and Diu, which were, however, {{not to be}} {{attacked}} without prior permission.|$|E
25|$|Andhra Pradesh, Assam, Delhi, Haryana, Kashmir, Maharashtra, Manipur, Uttarakhand, <b>Daman</b> & Diu and Dadra and Nagar Haveli, {{will allow}} foreign retailers.|$|E
25|$|These {{surviving}} Norteiro creoles {{have suffered}} drastic {{changes in the}} last decades. Standard Portuguese re-influenced the creole of <b>Daman</b> in the mid-20th century.|$|E
25|$|On 1 May 1928 the Diocese of Goa {{was renamed}} and was {{promoted}} to the Metropolitan Archdiocese of Goa and <b>Daman</b> (Goa e Damão). It is the oldest diocese in terms of activity in the East, with its origins linked {{to the arrival of}} the Portuguese on the Malabar Coast. The Metropolitan Archbishop of Goa and <b>Daman</b> also uses the title of Primate of the Indies or Primate of the East and honorifically receives the title of Patriarch of the East Indies.|$|E
25|$|The Portuguese {{acquired}} several territories {{from the}} Sultans of Gujarat: <b>Daman</b> (occupied 1531, formally ceded 1539); Salsette, Bombay, and Baçaim (occupied 1534); and Diu (ceded 1535).|$|E
25|$|In {{some parts}} of former Portuguese India, namely Goa and <b>Daman</b> and Diu, the {{language}} is still spoken by about 10,000 people. In 2014, an estimated 1,500 students were learning Portuguese in Goa.|$|E
25|$|These {{possessions}} {{became the}} Northern Province of Portuguese India, which extended almost 100km {{along the coast}} from <b>Daman</b> to Chaul, and in places 30–50km inland. The province was ruled from the fortress-town of Baçaim.|$|E
25|$|The Indian Government {{started to}} develop {{isolation}} actions against Dadra and Nagar Haveli already in 1952, including {{the creation of}} impediments to the transit of persons and goods between the two landlocked enclaves and <b>Daman.</b>|$|E
25|$|Yuquan Shenxiu (神秀 606?-706) was {{the most}} {{important}} successor to <b>Daman</b> Hongren. In 701 he was invited to the Imperial Court by Wu Zetian, who paid him due imperial reverence. The first lineage documents were produced in this period.|$|E
25|$|<b>Daman</b> and Diu is a union {{territory}} of India which, like Goa, {{was a former}} colonial possession of Portugal. Consequently, both native Gujarati food and traditional Portuguese food are common. Being a coastal region, the communities are mainly dependent on seafood. Normally, rotli and tea are taken for breakfast, rotla and saak for lunch, and chokha along with saak and curry are taken for dinner. Some of the dishes prepared on festive occasions include puri, lapsee, potaya, dudh-plag, and dhakanu. While alcohol is prohibited in the neighbouring state of Gujarat, drinking is common in <b>Daman</b> and Diu. Better known as the “pub” of Gujarat. All popular brands of alcohol are readily available.|$|E
25|$|States {{with low}} {{sanitation}} coverage in 2001 that improved coverage by 4–10% points are , Odisha, Bihar, Jharkhand, Madhya Pradesh, Rajasthan and Uttar Pradesh. Himachal Pradesh, <b>Daman</b> and Diu, Haryana, Sikkim, Punjab, Dadra and Nagar Haveli, Goa and Uttarakhand registered increased coverage {{by more than}} 20 percentage points.|$|E
25|$|Upon the {{surrender}} of the Portuguese governor general, Goa, <b>Daman</b> and Diu was declared a federally administered Union Territory placed directly under the President of India, and Major-General K. P. Candeth was appointed as its military governor. The war had lasted two days, and had cost 22 Indian and 30 Portuguese lives.|$|E
