The thermal stability of two different phenolic resins as binder on the frictional performance of brake composite material was studied. The two phenolic resins used are <b>Durite</b> phenolic resin and Bakelite phenolic resins. They were tested for friction, wear, thermal stability and degradation. This was executed by using a universal friction tester (UFT) for testing friction and wear, then on thermo gravimetric analysis (TGA) and the TGA results indicate more mass loss of NB samples contrary to test results. When individual materials were heated, Bakelite lost less mass compared to <b>Durite.</b> The friction test indicates more friction when used the NB samples but they had less wear and more stability nevertheless this could vary for other compositions and conditions...|$|E
30|$|Heidaigou coal is a {{low-rank}} {{bituminous coal}} {{with a high}} ash content. The sulfur content is low and dominated by pyritic sulfur. The Al 2 O 3 content is high while SiO 2 is relatively low in the ash. This results a high ash fusion temperature. The mine {{is located at the}} north edge of the carboniferous-permian coal accumulation basin in Northern China. The vitrinite content is lower than the average of the area while the inertinite and liptinite contents are higher (Han 1996). The dominant vitrinite macerals are telocollinite and desmocollinite. A small amount of telinite is also present. The liptinite group is mainly represented by sporinite, which disperses in the desmocollinite and in the matrix of the inertinite in the bedding direction. Fragmental fusinite usually mixes with semifusinite. The main microlithotypes are vitrite, trimacerite and <b>durite</b> while a small amount of clarite, inertrite and vitrinertite are present. Vitrite is usually uniform while trimacerite is fragmental or of lineation shape. <b>Durite</b> is composed of an inertinite matrix and a clastic texture.|$|E

40|$|The AGR- 1 and AGR- 2 {{compacting}} process involved overcoating TRISO {{particles and}} compacting {{them in a}} steel die. The overcoating step {{is the process of}} applying matrix to the OPyC layer of TRISO particles in a rotating drum in order to build up an overcoat layer of desired thickness. The matrix used in overcoating is a mixture of natural graphite, synthetic graphite, and thermosetting resin in the ratio, by weight, of 64 : 16 : 20. A wet mixing process was used for AGR- 1 and AGR- 2, in that the graphites and resin were mixed in the presence of ethyl alcohol. The goal of the wet mixing process was to 'resinate' the graphite particles, or coat each individual graphite particle with a thin layer of resin. This matrix production process was similar to the German, Chinese, Japanese, and South African methods, which also use various amount of solvent during mixing. See Appendix 1 for information on these countries matrix production techniques. The resin used for AGR- 1 and AGR- 2 was provided by Hexion, specifically Hexion grade <b>Durite</b> SC 1008. <b>Durite</b> SC 1008 is a solvated (liquid) resole phenolic resin. A resole resin does not typically have a hardening agent added. The major constituent of SC 1008 is phenol, with minor amounts of formaldehyde. <b>Durite</b> SC 1008 is high viscosity, so additional ethyl alcohol was added during matrix production in order to reduce its viscosity and enhance graphite particle resination. The current compacting scale up plan departs from a wet mixing process. The matrix production method specified in the scale up plan is a co-grinding jet mill process where powdered phenolic resin and graphite are all fed into a jet mill at the same time. Because of the change in matrix production style, SC 1008 cannot be used in the jet milling process because it is a liquid. The jet milling/mixing process requires that a suite of solid or powdered resins be investigated. The synthetic graphite used in AGR- 1 and AGR- 2 was provided by SGL Carbon, grade KRB 2000. KRB 2000 is a graphitized petroleum coke. The availability of KRB 2000 is perhaps in question, so a replacement synthetic graphite may need to be identified. This report presents data on potential replacements for KRB 2000...|$|E
40|$|Quantitative and {{reproducible}} {{information concerning}} {{the development of the}} extraradical mycelium of arbuscular mycorrhizal fungi (AMF) is lacking due to the difficulties in extracting, identifying and estimating hyphal lengths. In this study, using a rhizobox growth system, the lengths of hyphae of AMF estimated using an image analysis system were not significantly different from data obtained by a trained observer using a modified grid-line intersect method. The assessment of lengths of hyphae on membrane filters or slides was, however, much quicker using image analysis, and allowed the complete sample to be quantified, unlike the grid-line method where a limited number of fields of view are assessed. The image analysis procedure is objective, observer-independent and less laborious than the manual method of assessment. Of the four different methods of sample preparation compared, membrane filter methods were found to be the most appropriate for quantitative sampling from three non-soil substrates. Glomus monosporum (UKC M 3) produced twice as much extraradical mycelium and hyphal length per centimetre of colonised root than G. geosporum (BEG 11) on both leek and linseed in a <b>durite</b> sand at final harvest (63 days). Both AMF also produced more hyphal length per centimetre of colonised root on linseed than on leek. The spatial distribution of both AMF, however, was similar in <b>durite</b> sand and no correlation with levels of NaHCO 3 -extractable phosphorus was noted. In a third experiment, with G. manihotis (UKC INDO- 1) colonising a tropical forage legume, Pueraria phaseoloides, in two other growth substrates, a different pattern of development of the extraradical mycelium was observed. Because of a higher content of particulate matter, which collected on the membrane filters, the extraction technique had to be modified to give optimal performance of the image analysis system...|$|E

30|$|It is {{possible}} to estimate the sedimentation conditions in the original peat bog {{in connection with the}} temperature conditions. The high content of collotelinite (up to 59  vol.%, Table  3) with a discernible cellular structure of plant tissues indicates a humid environment and woody plant vegetation, whereas the higher content of collodetrinite (up to 13  vol.%, Table  3) indicates the subsequent intensive degradation of this woody plant vegetation or the decomposition of a higher amount of herbaceous vegetation. The observed increased liptinite and inertinite contents in <b>durite,</b> trimacerite and carbargilite (see Supplementary material, point 6, Figs VII–X) implies a more intensive decomposition of the organic matter in an arid and oxidizing environment. The ranges of the selected plant species in the Central and Western Bohemian Basins are reported by Pešek (2004) and Opluštil et al. (2016); the plants are described by Kvaček and Straková (1997) and Turek et al. (1998). Intensive degradation of vegetation and decomposition of organic matter under given sedimentation conditions suggests a relatively easy conversion of organic matter to coal, but there is nothing to indicate high temperatures during conversion.|$|E
40|$|Phenolic resins {{are used}} in many aspects of {{everyday}} life, e. g. as the matrix material for carbon fibre laminates used in the aerospace industry. Consequently detailed knowledge of this material, especially while under shock loading, is extremely useful {{for the design of}} components that could be subjected to impact during their lifespan. The shock Hugoniot equation of state for phenolic resin (<b>Durite</b> SC- 1008), with initial density of 1. 18 gcm − 3 have been determined using the plate-impact technique with in situ manganin stress gauges. The Hugoniot equation in the shock velocity-particle velocity plane was found to be non- linear in nature with the following equation: Us = 2. 14 + 3. 79 up - 1. 68 up 2. Further, the Hugoniot in the pressure-volume plane was observed to largely follow the hydrostatic curve. Lateral gauge measurements were also obtained. An ANSYS Autodyn TM 2 D model was used to investigate the lateral stress behaviour of the SC- 1008.

40|$|The {{major oil}} and gas fields in Australia produce from coal measure sediments, in {{contrast}} to the giant oil fields of the Northern Hemisphere which are associated with the marine rocks. The organic matter in the Australian fields is present both as coal seams and fragments of coaly material dispersed through the adjacent sediments. The {{purpose of this study is}} to determine whether the organic matter in the coal seams and as dispersed fragments is the same, different or systematically related. The type of organic matter in each may indicate that one is better, or the same, as a source for hydrocarbons. The sedimentary sequences examined are those of the Permian- Triassic Cooper Basin, the Permian Pedirka Basin, the Triassic Simpson Desert Basin, and the Jurassic-Cretaceous Eromanga Basin, all of which are located in central Australia. In addition, the relationship of organic matter type to the depositional environment for the Permian sequence in the Cooper Basin was investigated. AH of the studies were carried out using reflected and transmitted light microscopic techniques for analyses of the organic matter. Relationships have been found between the maceral types of the dispersed organic matter (DOM) and the maceral and microlithotypecompositions of the associated coals. Exinite (sporinite) DOM correlates with vitrinite and sporinite in the associated coals in the Cooper and Eromanga Basins, Exinite (cutinite) DOM correlates negatively with cutinite in the coal in the Simpson Desert Basin, Sporinite DOM correlates with vitrite plus clarite and intermediate, microlithotypes (duroclarite, clarodurite and vitrinertite) in the coals of the Cooper Basin. Vitrinite DOM correlates with vitrinite and the intermediate microlithotypes in associated coal in the Cooper Basin, and with resinite in the coal of the Eromanga Basin, Inertinite DOM, mostly inertodetrinite, correlates with inertodetrinite and <b>durite</b> plus inertite in the associated coals in the Cooper Basin. The microlithotype compositions of coals formed in association with a large lake environment are distinctly different from the microlithotype compositions of coals formed on the lower coastal plain and in areasdominated by coal swamps in the Permian of the Cooper Basin, Channel belt coals are also distinct in type from those of the lower coastal plain, upper coastal plain and areas dominated by coal swamps. Lower coastal plain coals can be differentiated from upper coastal plain coals on the basis of their microlithotype compositions. Those coals with the highest vitrite plus clarite contents have formed in channel belts and associated with large lakes. Coals with the highest <b>durite</b> plus inertite contents have formed in the areas dominated by coal swamps. Given that exinite is the coal maceral richest in hydrogen, and therefore the best material for generating hydrocarbons, the best source rocks in the Permian of the Cooper Basin are those which have formed in the large lake and channel belt environments. If inertinite has the least potential as a source for hydrocarbons, then the sequences in areas dominated by coal swamps have the lowest potential as source rocks for hydrocarbons...|$|E
30|$|Petrographically, {{vitrinite}} {{group of}} macerals dominate followed by inertinite and relatively in lesser concentration are macerals of the liptinite group. Among the vitrinites, collotelinite record the highest followed by vitrodetrinite and collodetrinite. In the studied coals, inertinite {{also has a}} major presence indicating dry episodes {{in the development of}} the peat. Among the microlithotypevitrite followed by inertite, clarite and <b>durite</b> are major entities in the coals. The rank of the coal as per the volatile matter is between sub-bituminous ‘B’ and sub-bituminous ‘A’. Hydrocarbon generation potential is low as indicated by rock–eval pyrolysis. Based on HI and OI plots and elemental H/C and O/C ratio, the investigated coals have been characterized as kerogen Type III, suggestive of dominantly terrestrial and lacustrine organic matter. The peat development on basis of microlithotype composition suggest their evolution in limno-telmatic zones having floral inputs characteristic of forest moor with intermittent hydrological conditions. The Gelification Index and Tissue Preservation Index are suggestive of terrestrial origin with high tree density. Further, moderately high GI and exceedingly high telovitrinite based TPI along with high ash content are indicative of their origin in intermittent dry forested swamps. The Ground Water Index suggests that these coals have evolved in bogs under ombrotrophic hydrological conditions. The Vegetation Index values are indicative of preponderance of herbaceous plants in the formation of the coals. The plots on a depositional model given by Smyth (1979) indicate their deposition under fluvio-lacustrine control with the development of upper deltaic and lower deltaic conditions near the fresh water lacustrines.|$|E
40|$|The Early Permian coal {{samples for}} the study were {{obtained}} from the Vasse Shelf, southern Perth Basin, located approximately 200 km south- west of Perth. The selected coal samples {{for the study}} were also obtained from the Premier Sub-basin of the Collie Basin and the Irwin Sub-basin of the Perth Basin. The Early Permian coal measures are described as the Sue Coal Measures from the Vasse Shelf, the Ewington Coal Measures from the Premier Sub-basin and the coal measures from the Irwin sub-basin are described as the Irwin River Coal Measures. The Vasse Shelf coal is finely banded and the dominant lithotypes are dull and dull banded types, followed by bright banded and banded types, with minor bright types. The variation of dull and bright lithotypes represents fluctuating conditions of water table level during the growth of peat in the swamp. The maceral composition of the coal is predominantly composed of inertinite, followed by vitrinite and minor exinite and mineral matter. The coal is characterized by very low to medium semifusinite ratio and medium to high vitrinite content, supporting the deposition in anaerobic wet conditions with some degree of oxidation. The coal is classified as sub- bituminous to high volatile bituminous of the Australian classification. In terms of microlithotype group, the predominance of inertite over vitrite suggests the coal was formed under drier conditions with high degree of oxidation during its deposition. On the basis of the interpretations of lithotypes, macerals, microlithotypes and trace elements, the depositional environment of the coal is braided and meandering deltaic-river system without any brackish or marine influence. The maceral composition of the Collie coal predominantly consists of inertinite and vitrinite, with low exinite and mineral matter. The very low to low semifusinite ratio and low to medium vitrinite content of ++the coal indicate that the coal was formed under aerobic dry to wet conditions with some degree of oxidation. The coal is categorized as sub-bituminous according to the Australian classification. The domination of inertite and <b>durite</b> over vitrite and clarite contents in the coal reflects the deposition under drier conditions with fluctuations in the water table. On the basis of the interpretations of macerals, microlithotypes and trace elements distribution, the depositional environment of the coal is lacustrine, braided to meandering fluvial system, without the influence of any marine influx. The maceral composition of the Irwin River coal consists predominantly of vitrinite and inertinite, and minor exinite and mineral matter. The coal has very low semifusinite ratio and medium to high vitrinite content, suggesting the coal was deposited in anaerobic wet conditions with some degree of oxidation. The coal is classified as sub-bituminous of the Australian classification. The predominance of vitrite and clarite over inertite and <b>durite</b> contents in the coal indicates that the coal was formed in wetter conditions and in high water covers with a low degree of oxidation. Based on macerals and microlithotypes contents, the depositional environment of the coal is braided fluvial to deltaic, which is in accordance with the interpreted non- marine and mixed marine environment of deposition in the sub-basin. The petrological comparisons of Vasse Shelf, Collie and Irwin River coals show that the average vitrinite content of the Irwin River coal is highest (49. 1 %) and of the Collie coal is lowest (37. 3 %) of the three. The inertinite content is highest in Collie coal (49. 1 %), followed by Vasse Shelf (46. 4 %) and Irwin River (39. 2 %) coals. The exinite content is low in Irwin River coal (6. 3 %) as compared with Vasse Shelf (9. 0 °/,) and Collie (8. 3 %) coals. The mineral matter content ++is relatively low for all the three coals. The rank of the Vasse Shelf coal is high as compared with the Collie and Irwin River coals, either due to tectonic uplift after the deposition in post-Permian in the southern Perth Basin, or due to the average depth of burial over Vasse Shelf which is much greater than that of Collie and Irwin River coals. The comparisons of the coal from Western Australia with the selected Gondwana coals show that the predominance of inertinite over vitrinite occurs in the Western Australian coals (Vasse Shelf and Collie Basin). On the other hand, the Brazilian, eastern Australian, Indian and Western Australian (Irwin Sub-basin) coals are dominated by vitrinite over inertinite. The exinite content is highest in the Indian coals and lowest in the eastern Australian coals. The mineral matter content is highest in the Brazilian and Indian coals, and lowest in Western Australian (Vasse Shelf) and eastern Australian (Sydney Basin) coals. The rank of the coals ranges from sub- bituminous to medium volatile bituminous according to the Australian classification...|$|E
40|$|The shock {{response}} {{of a complex}} laminate has been investigated using a single stage gas gun, with manganin pressure gauges employed to investigate the shock profile. The complex laminate investigated was known by the acronym TWCP and is a tape wrapped carbon fibre composite with phenolic resin matrix. Carbon fibre composites {{are used in the}} aerospace industry due to their high strength to weight ratio, so understanding of different loading conditions is needed. To investigate the {{shock response}} of the TWCP, four weave orientations were studied. The orientations investigated with respect to the shock front were 0 ◦ (parallel to the shock front or perpendicular to the direction of travel), 25 ◦, 45 ◦ and 90 ◦ (perpendicular to the shock front or parallel to the direction of travel). As well as the TWCP the shock response of the matrix material, a phenolic resin <b>Durite</b> SC- 1008 was also investigated. For the phenolic resin matrix material a non-linear Hugoniot was found in the US-up plane with the equation of US = 2. 14 + 3. 79 up - 1. 68 u 2 p. Such non-linear Hugoniot behaviour has been seen in other polymeric materials, e. g. PMMA. In the pressure-volume plane deviation was seen in the higher pressure data most likely due to the materials non-linear response. For the TWCP composite, linear Hugoniots were found for all four orientations with the corresponding equations shown below. • 0 ◦ US = 3. 69 + 0. 59 up • 25 ◦ US = 3. 45 + 0. 73 up • 45 ◦ US = 3. 44 + 1. 12 up • 90 ◦ US = 3. 96 + 0. 46 up The four Hugoniots are comparable in nature and it is possible to assign a single Hugoniot with the equation US = 3. 56 + 0. 84 up through the majority of data points. The largest deviation from this “average” response was obtained from the 90 ◦ orientation due to the high elastic sound speed of this weave angle. Convergence was also seen between the Hugoniots in the US-up plane towards the higher up values (approximately 1 mm μs− 1). In the pressure-up plane there was very little difference between all of the experimental data, meaning that for the stress in this material, orientation makes no difference...|$|E
40|$|The Early Jurassic coal {{samples for}} the study were {{obtained}} from CRA Exploration Pty Ltd. (CRAE), drilled in the Gairdner and Mintaja Blocks, Gairdner Range of the Hill River Area, northern Perth Basin, Western Australia. The area is located approximately 280 km north of Perth. The coal measures subcrop in a half- graben bounded by the Lesueur-Peron Fault in the west, and the Warradarge Fault in the east. The coal occurs within the shallow sequence of the Cattamarra Member which is also described as the Cattamarra Coal Measures of the Cockleshell Gully Formation. Six sub-seams of seam G, namely G 1 to G 6, from the six drill cores, were examined for petrological and geochemical investigation. The coal predominantly comprises of banded, dull banded, and dull lithotypes, with minor bright banded, bright and fusainous types. Based on maceral analyses, the dominant maceral groups are vitrinite and inertinite, whilst the exinite and mineral matter are in minor contents. The vitrinite content has a range between 47. 2 % to 73. 0 %, and it is composed mainly of telocollinite and desmocollinite. The inertinite is dominated by semifusinite, fusinite, and inertodetrinite, {{and it has a}} range from 10. 4 % to 24. 8 %. The exinite group varies between 7. 2 % to 20. 8 % in content, and it is represented by sporinite, cutinite, alginite and resinite. The mineral matter dominated by clays and pyrite, ranges between 4. 5 % to 20. 6 %. The microlithotype analyses shows that the vitrite plus clarite content varies from 47. 0 % to 70. 0 %, intermediates between 8. 0 % to 26. 0 %, whilst inertite plus <b>durite</b> content is relatively low, varying from 6. 55 % to 14. 0 %. The maximum reflectance of vitrinite has a value between 0. 47 % and 0. 53 %, which represents rank at sub-bituminous level based on the Australian rank values and corresponding to the sub-bituminous A and B rank of the ASTM classification and to the metalignitous type of the Pareek classification. On the basis of carbon and hydrogen content, the coal is categorised as per-hydrous meta- to ortho-lignitous type. The trace elements As, B, Be, Cd, Co, Cr, Cu, Ga, Mn, Mo, Ni, Pb, Sr, Th, U, V, Y, Zn, and Zr, are spectrographically analysed in the coal ash. The B content in the coal supports the presence of marine influence during peat deposition in the basin. On the basis of lithotype, maceral, microlithotype, trace element distribution, pyrite and total sulphur in the coal, the depositional environment for coal and the coal measures, is interpreted as an upper to lower delta type within a regressive phase of marine transgression...|$|E
