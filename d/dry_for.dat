As well as stems, the rhizomes—extensions of the trunk {{below the surface of}} the ground shaped like {{enormous}} carrots—were also dug up to be cooked. In the early 1840s, Edward Shortland said Māori preferred rhizomes from trees growing in deep rich soil. They dug them in spring or early summer just before the flowering of the plant, when they were at their sweetest. November was the favourite month for preparing kāuru in the South Island.|$|E
5|$|After the American Civil War, {{returning}} residents {{found that}} their slaves, livestock and farm equipment had been taken. Most residents relocated. However, in the early 20th century, farmers returned {{and the town of}} Green Lake modestly grew to an approximate population of 300 in 1914. At the time, much of the land in the vicinity was used for livestock grazing. The only profitable commercial uses for the lake itself included transportation of lumber and fishing. Approximately US$100,000 worth of fish were caught in the lake from 1900 to 1915. Nevertheless, the lake bed remained <b>dry</b> <b>for</b> extended periods and vegetation covered certain areas. Local residents soon began to use the bed to grow cotton.|$|E
5|$|Although {{paleontology}} became established around 1800, earlier thinkers {{had noticed}} {{aspects of the}} fossil record. The ancient Greek philosopher Xenophanes (570–480 BC) concluded from fossil sea shells that some areas of land were once under water. During the Middle Ages the Persian naturalist Ibn Sina, known as Avicenna in Europe, discussed fossils and proposed a theory of petrifying fluids on which Albert of Saxony elaborated in the 14th century. The Chinese naturalist Shen Kuo (1031–1095) proposed a theory of climate change based {{on the presence of}} petrified bamboo in regions that in his time were too <b>dry</b> <b>for</b> bamboo.|$|E

Smith plant were subjected to four different postharvest drying times (6, 24, 48 and 72 h, respectively) to study the effect of post-harvest drying period on its essential oil yield and composition. The essential oils were extracted using the hydrodistillation method for 5 h. The oils were analyzed by capillary GC and GC/MS. The highest yield was obtained from leaves <b>dried</b> <b>for</b> 48 h (0. 16 % v/w), pseudostems <b>dried</b> <b>for</b> 24 h (0. 013 % v/w), rhizomes <b>dried</b> <b>for</b> 6 h (0. 047 % v/w) and inflorescences <b>dried</b> both <b>for</b> 24 and 72 h (0. 1 % v/w), respectively. Thirty five compounds were identified from essential oils of leaves, 18 from pseudostems, 28 from rhizomes and 20 from inflorescences, of which 42 compounds had not been detected previously. The most prominent compounds identified with the highest percentages were 2 -cyclohexen- 1 -one (93. 42 %) from leaves <b>dried</b> <b>for</b> 6 h, 2 -tridecanone (51. 55 %) from pseudostems <b>dried</b> <b>for</b> 24 h, 1 -dodecanol from rhizomes (63. 64 %) <b>dried</b> <b>for</b> 48 h and from inflorescences (54. 48 %) <b>dried</b> <b>for</b> 24 h...|$|R

5|$|Conditions were <b>dry</b> <b>for</b> {{qualifying}} on Saturday afternoon. Qualifying {{consisted of}} three parts, 18, 15 and 12 minutes in length respectively, with five drivers eliminated from competing after {{each of the first}} two sessions. Only the two Mercedes drivers were capable of proceeding into the second part of qualifying (Q2) without having to use the faster, soft tyres. Nico Rosberg was fastest, ahead of Williams' Valtteri Bottas and Lewis Hamilton. As Carlos Sainz was unable to compete following his crash in practice, only four running drivers were eliminated. Those were both Marussia drivers, the Sauber of Marcus Ericsson and Fernando Alonso for McLaren.|$|E
5|$|Current {{sea level}} rise, {{increased}} cyclonic activity, increased ambient temperatures, and increasingly fickle precipitation patterns are {{effects of global}} warming that have affected or are projected to impact India. Thousands {{of people have been}} displaced by ongoing sea level rises that have submerged low-lying islands in the Sundarbans. Temperature rises on the Tibetan Plateau are causing Himalayan glaciers to retreat, threatening the flow rate of the Ganges, Brahmaputra, Yamuna, and other major rivers; the livelihoods {{of hundreds of thousands of}} farmers depend on these rivers.

5|$|In {{contrast}} to the rain-affected practice and qualifying sessions, the track was <b>dry</b> <b>for</b> {{the duration of the}} race. All of the drivers except Jenson Button, Jarno Trulli and the two Red Bull drivers started on the softer option tyre. The first lap was eventful: Alonso started better than polesitter Massa and was able to take the inside line into turn one and gain the lead. Hamilton passed Räikkönen for third into the first corner, then drove round the outside of Massa into turn two to take second place. Meanwhile, the suspension on Adrian Sutil's Spyker failed at turn four, causing it to collide with Button's Honda and retire from the race. Button continued after making an early pitstop to repair the damage. Liuzzi and Sato also collided at turn four, causing Liuzzi to pit for a new front wing. After the race the drivers blamed each other for the incident.|$|E
