40|$|The {{presence}} of the thiazolidine ring in penicillins and related derivatives was the first recognition of thiazolidines in nature. As these heterocyclic compounds have important biological properties, such as potential anti-inflammatory and analgesic activity, according to previous works (Singh et al. - 1986; Boschelli et al. - 1992). This fact drove us to the synthesis of new derivatives with potential anti-inflammatory activity. We synthesized and identified the physicochemical characteristics of a new <b>thiazolidine</b> <b>derivative</b> (LPSF/SF- 22).

The scope is fairly large as the range of aldehydes and active methylene compounds used afforded products in very good to excellent yields. Other prominent features are as follows: the reaction time is shorter, no polluting volatile solvents are used, reaction work-up is simple, no toxic by-products are formed during aqueous work-up, and all these green aspects place this method at an advantageous position compared to already reported methods for these molecules of commercial value.|$|R

Comparing rates of closure of the oxazolidine ring with attack of external hydroxide ion on the iminium ion yields a ratio of rate constants of 25 for intra- and inter-molecular attack of oxyanion nucleophiles in this endo-cyclic ring-closure reaction. This ratio is significantly lcss than the factor of 103 - 104 commonly observed for similar exo-cyclic ring closures and {{is consistent with the}} presence of ring strain in the endo-cyclic transition state as envisaged in Baldwin’s rules. Changes in N-alkyl substituent (Me, Et, Bu, Pri, But and phenyl) lead to mild (and parallel) changes in reaction rates and equilibrium constants for oxazolidine ring closure. For the corresponding thiazolidine rings, comparison of the N-H <b>thiazolidine</b> <b>derivative</b> of benzaldehyde with N-butyl and N-phenyl derivatives of cinnamaldehyde shows a much larger variation in rate constants for ring closure with N-substituent (lO*-fold), but still small changes in equilibrium constants and rate constants for attack of hydroxide ion upon the iminium ion (<loo-fold).

This is why a large number of <b>thiazolidines</b> <b>derivatives</b> is present in the catalogues of the major world chemical suppliers. The synthesis of thiazolidines is based on the reaction of 2 -aminoethanethiols and their esters with aldehydes under heating conditions. Despite high yields and easy work up procedures, long reaction time are necessary especially when sterically hindered aldehydes are used. Instability of certain aldehydes further limits batchwise approach to thiazolidines. Therefore, we decided to investigatewhether continuous-flow synthesis could be used in this context in order to shorten reaction times and increase reaction yields. Thus the experimental set up showed in scheme 1 was designed. The Weinreb amide was reduced by lithium aluminium hydride. In-line quenching and separation of the resulting aluminium salts resulted in high putity aldehydes. The aldehydes was then mixed with an equimolar solution of cysteine ethyl ester to gain the final thiazolidine. A DoE-assisted optimization of the experimental setup allowed the selection of the most suitable parameters for synthesizing thiazolidines in excellent yields (80 - 100 %) and purities (> 95 %).

40|$|A novel {{fluorescence}} probe {{capable of}} discriminatively and simultaneously detecting Cys, Hcy and GSH has been developed. This specially designed probe can selectively react with Cys and Hcy to form thiazinane and <b>thiazolidine</b> <b>derivatives</b> {{in the presence}} of diverse amino acids, protected Cys and glucose and display the expected aggregation-induced emission (AIE) properties. Relying on the differences in kinetics, Cys can be easily and discriminately detected over Hcy by the observation of FL responses. GSH shows great interference with the detection of Cys and Hcy and it can be quantitatively detected by the FL spectroscopic titration method. The threshold of the FL turn-off concentration for GSH is measured to be 1 mM. This is the first report of using a single fluorescent probe to discriminately detect Cys, Hcy and GSH by FL turn-on and turn-off strategies. The discrimination relies on the reaction-dependent fluorophore aggregation, or the solubility of adducts of the probe molecule and analytes. The present strategy is intrinsically a fluorescent titration, which combines the high sensitivity of FL spectroscopy and the reliability of precipitate titration methodology. The threshold concentration of Cys (375 mu M, at which the FL is turned-on) coincides with the upper margin of the deficient Cys levels in human plasma, and the primary investigation of the FL response to deproteinized human plasma indicates that this FL probe is a promising one for the discriminatory detection of Cys over Hcy and GSH on a clinical level...|$|R

In this study, DNA purified from the liver, stomach, duodenum and jejenum of mice dosed with 35 S radiolabelled captan was found to contain radioactivity equivalent to Covalent Binding Indices in the range 38 - 91; that from the bone marrow had a CBI of 2. 8. The distribution of radioactivity between the various tissues did not reflect the target organ specificity of captan. Attempts to further purify the DNA samples using caesium chloride gradients resulted in partial separation of the radioactivity from the DNA suggesting that covalent binding to the DNA may not have occurred.

We now report on the molecular mechanism that results in LJ 001 's specific inhibition of virus-cell fusion. The antiviral activity of LJ 001 was light-dependent, required the presence of molecular oxygen, and was reversed by singlet oxygen ((1) O 2) quenchers, qualifying LJ 001 as a type II photosensitizer. Unsaturated phospholipids were the main target modified by LJ 001 -generated (1) O 2. Hydroxylated fatty acid species were detected in model and viral membranes treated with LJ 001, but not its inactive molecular analog, LJ 025. (1) O 2 -mediated allylic hydroxylation of unsaturated phospholipids leads to a trans-isomerization of the double bond and concurrent formation of a hydroxyl group {{in the middle of}} the hydrophobic lipid bilayer. LJ 001 -induced (1) O 2 -mediated lipid oxidation negatively impacts on the biophysical properties of viral membranes (membrane curvature and fluidity) critical for productive virus-cell membrane fusion. LJ 001 did not mediate any apparent damage on biogenic cellular membranes, likely due to multiple endogenous cytoprotection mechanisms against phospholipid hydroperoxides. Based on our understanding of LJ 001 's mechanism of action, we designed a new class of membrane-intercalating photosensitizers to overcome LJ 001 's limitations for use as an in vivo antiviral agent. Structure activity relationship (SAR) studies led to a novel class of compounds (oxazolidine- 2, 4 -dithiones) with (1) 100 -fold improved in vitro potency (IC 50 < 10 nM), (2) red-shifted absorption spectra (for better tissue penetration), (3) increased quantum yield (efficiency of (1) O 2 generation), and (4) 10 - 100 -fold improved bioavailability.
