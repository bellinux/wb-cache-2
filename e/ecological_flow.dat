It becomes an important issue to guarantee the <b>ecological</b> basic <b>flow.</b> In fact, {{even if there was}} no interference from human, the river flow would also change constantly and would form certain ecological functions. Taking Baoji Section of Wei river as an instance, this paper, based on the analysis of its flow process with fine status, draws a conclusion that ecological function of the river is concerned with factors of both the flow capacity and the duration time of the flow. Various computational methods for <b>ecological</b> basic <b>flow</b> have been presented previously just with minimum discharge, however, time quantum is ignored.

Supply and demand of the {{water resource}}s in basins interacts {{with the development of}} social economy as well as the aquatic ecosystem. Therefore once suffering crisis of water shortage, not only the socioeconomic system will be confronted with large financial loss, but also the original aquatic ecological equilibrium in basins will be broken. This paper constructed an early warning system of water shortage by using Stella software based on the system dynamics (SD) model, which has been believed to delineate clearly the coupling correlation between the water resource and the social economic system and aquatic ecosystem. The <b>ecological</b> <b>flow</b> was considered as an indispensable element in the water demand.

This study focused on the Jinping cascaded reservoirs as a case study. An optimization model was developed to explore {{a balance between the}} <b>ecological</b> <b>flow</b> requirement (EFR) of a target fish species (Schizothorax chongi) in the dewatered natural channel section, and annual power production. The EFR for the channel was determined by the Tennant method and a fish habitat model, respectively. The optimization model was solved by using an adaptive real-coded genetic algorithm. Several operation scenarios corresponding to the <b>ecological</b> <b>flow</b> series were evaluated using the optimization model. Through comparisons, an optimal operational scheme, which combines relatively low power production loss with a preferred <b>ecological</b> <b>flow</b> regime in the dewatered channel, is proposed for the cascaded reservoirs. Under the recommended scheme, the discharge into the Dahewan river reach in the dry season ranges from 36 to 50 m(3) /s.

The study demonstrates that the use of EFRs is an efficient approach to the optimization of {{reservoir operation}} in an ecologically friendly way.

While the estimation of model parameters for ungauged catchments is a challenging research task in itself, it is important to evaluate whether simulated time series preserve critical aspects of the streamflow hydrograph. To address this question, seven calibration objective functions were evaluated for their ability to preserve ecologically relevant streamflow characteristics of the average annual hydrograph using a runoff model, HBV-light, at 27 catchments in the southeastern United States. Calibration trials were repeated 100 times to reduce parameter uncertainty effects on the results, and 12 <b>ecological</b> <b>flow</b> characteristics were computed for comparison.

Runtime: 56 : 13 minutesSustainable and ecological discourses of urban design and planning are overwhelming in recent literatures, however, focusing mostly on normative criteria or policy oriented tools. Operational approaches to connecting ecological analysis and urban design are largely unexplored. The book argues {{for the third}} ecology proposition, a perspective that cities as a system contains <b>ecological</b> <b>flows.</b> Its approach to urban design articulates urban form and <b>ecological</b> <b>flows</b> to create symbiotic relationship of urban, industrial and natural systems. The distinction between traditional urban design and ecological systems design has been made. Traditional designs tend to be deterministic in form making, while ecosystem approaches to urban design deal with ecological processes that are stochastic. Traditional urban design treats âecology in citiesâ as ways of preserving or adding ecological elements such as green spaces to urban environment. Ecological systems design advocates âecology by designâ, an inherently ecology-structured urban system, and sees ecology as a driving force of urban transformation to reconstruct ecosystems compatibility by linking the urban forms and flows of material, energy, water and organism across the system boundaries. The design methodology of ecological urbanism provides a set of organizational principles of ecological urban spaces that are operated based on the measures of ecological performances of urban geometric form, perceptual quality and material surface. They are situated in cross-scale contexts of hierarchical complex systems of cities, and {{should be considered in}} temporal dimension, system threshold and stochastic process to manage urban change and make sustainable progress...|$|R
40|$|It is {{possible}} to reduce flood risk in estuaries without having to drastically modify the river banks by levees or to block shipping routes and <b>ecological</b> <b>flows</b> by dams. âStorm surge barriersâ close off a river mouth at times of high sea water levels, but keep the river open during calmer times. âMoveable river flood barriersâ direct a river towards less urbanised parts of the delta. It is likely that with climate change and continuing economic growth more of these barriers will be built worldwide. The influential Dutch state commission the âDelta Commissionâ has adopted an idea by Delft University of Technology to flood-proof the Dutch Rhine-Meuse delta {{by a number of}} existing and new moveable barriers. These will direct high water flows in desired directions, particularly at times when a storm at sea coincides with high river discharges. This would create a historically complex system of flood defenses, thus needing thorough modelling and more detailed design to evaluate benefits and costs. This paper will compare a number of alternatives as follows: locate the various barriers on different locations, see where additional river widenings would be possible, calculate the remaining required levee modifications (dictated by Dutch national flood law) as a function of sea level rise, determine the effects on urbanisation of the river banks, on shipping, and if possible also on <b>ecological</b> <b>flows.</b> This comparison will in this paper not lead to the âbest configurationâ, but to valuable insight in the system.

The key parameter of EHRA is to fix the watercourse cross-sectional flow area corresponding to EHR, by which the relation between parabola shaped cross-sectional flow area and hydraulic radius is deduced. The EHRA not only meets the requirement of flow velocity for adequate fish spawning migration, but also is applicable to the ecological flows in regard with other ecological issues (such as the calculation of the instream flow requirements for transporting sediment and for pollution self-purification, etc.). This essay has illuminated the computational process taking the estimation of ecological water requirement of Zhuba Hydrological Station watercourse in Niqu branch of the Yalong River as an example.

In this study, we evaluate future river flow alterations in the entire Danube River basin by means of ecologically relevant river flow indicators under different climate warming scenarios (Representative Concentration Pathway (RCP) 2. 6, RCP 4. 5, and RCP 8. 5). The process-based watershed model SWIM was applied for 1124 sub-catchments to simulate daily time series of river discharge for the Danube River and its tributaries under future scenario conditions. The derived hydrological data series were then statistically analyzed using eight eco-hydrological indicators to distinguish intra-year variations in the streamflow regime. The results are used to: (a) analyze the possible impacts of climate change on the ecologically relevant flow regime components; and (b) identify regions at the highest risk of climate change-driven flow alterations. Our results indicate that climate change will distinctively alter the recent <b>ecological</b> <b>flow</b> regime of the Danube River and, in particular, the tributaries of the Middle and Lower Danube basin.
