5|$|From the league's {{founding}} in 1920 until 1932, {{there was no}} scheduled championship game. From 1920–1923, the championship was awarded to a team {{by a vote of}} team owners at the annual owners' meeting. From 1924–1932, the team <b>having</b> <b>the</b> <b>best</b> winning percentage was awarded the championship. As each team played a different number of games, simply counting wins and losses would have been insufficient. Additionally, tie games were not counted in the standings in figuring winning percentage (under modern rules, ties count as ½ win and ½ loss).|$|E

5|$|For the 1937–38 cricket season, Miller {{transferred}} to the VCA Colts, where he won the team's batting trophy for <b>having</b> <b>the</b> <b>best</b> average. At this stage, his method of playing was slow and steady accumulation of runs. Late in the summer, he made his first-class debut for Victoria and hit 181 against Tasmania at the Melbourne Cricket Ground. In 1938–39, he rejoined South Melbourne and also played four further matches for Victoria, scoring 125 runs {{at an average of}} 25.00. However, he was yet to play in the Sheffield Shield competition, having appeared only in one-off matches.|$|E

Steffi Martin and Sylke Otto—at 36, the oldest female {{individual}} gold medalist at the Winter Games—are the only lugers with two gold medals in their career. Ortrun Enderlein, representing the Unified Team of Germany, {{was the first woman}} to win the singles event in 1964. She {{was on the verge of}} defending her title at the 1968 Grenoble Games, <b>having</b> <b>the</b> <b>best</b> overall time after all the runs, but was disqualified together with fellow countrywomen Anna-Maria Müller (2nd) and Angela Knösel (4th) when it was discovered that the runners in their sleds had been illegally heated before the runs.

5|$|Success {{followed}} in 2002 when the Galaxy won the Supporters' Shield for <b>having</b> <b>the</b> <b>best</b> regular season {{record in the}} league. Schmid was lauded for his defensive tactics after adjusting the team's standard formation to a 3–5–2 early in the season. The shift allowed Alexi Lalas to play as a sweeper without specific marking responsibilities in the three-man defensive line. Schmid also brought Guatemalan forward Carlos Ruiz to the team; Ruiz won league Most Valuable Player(MVP) award that year. Amidst criticism for failing to win in previous years, the franchise won its first MLS Cup with a 1–0 overtime victory against New England. The team again reached the Open Cup final but lost to the Columbus Crew.|$|E
5|$|The trophy was {{accepted}} by the league at its May 15, 1927 meeting in Montreal. The criteria for winning was variously reported. The Montreal Gazette and The Globe and Mail reported that it was 'to be awarded each year to the goaltender in the National Hockey League <b>having</b> <b>the</b> <b>best</b> (goals against) average,' while the Toronto Star reported that the trophy went to the 'most valuable' goaltender in the league. When Hainsworth won his third Vezina {{at the end of}} the 1928–29 NHL season, the trophy was reported to be for the 'most outstanding' goaltender in the league. However, later reports state that the trophy was based on the lowest goals against average (GAA).|$|E

5|$|Although young, Kennedy was {{successful}} with Toronto from the start. In his first season, the 18-year-old finished {{second on the}} team in scoring and then in his sophomore year was considered the star of Toronto's upset of the record-breaking Montreal Canadiens of 1944–45. He established himself {{as the leader of}} the team and became captain in 1948. Although not the best skater in the league, Kennedy was a fierce forechecker and skilled playmaker. Kennedy was a perfect fit into coach Hap Day's emphasis on defense and positional play. He gained a reputation for scoring the important goal and excelling in the playoffs. Kennedy holds the Toronto Maple Leafs' all-time record for career points in the Stanley Cup Finals and is the youngest player in the history of the NHL to have scored a Stanley Cup winning goal. A Sports Illustrated poll of hockey experts in 1998 rated Kennedy as <b>having</b> <b>the</b> <b>best</b> face-off skills in the history of the NHL.|$|E
5|$|In 1980, after <b>having</b> <b>the</b> <b>best</b> {{record in}} the first stages of the Brasileirão, Atlético lost to Flamengo in a {{controversial}} final of the competition. Three Galo players were sent off, among them Reinaldo, who received a straight red card after scoring twice. The team was then eliminated from the following year's Copa Libertadores undefeated, in another decisive match marked by controversy: a play-off against Flamengo that ended after 37 minutes, following the sendings-off of five Atlético players. During the 1980s, the club participated in and won international friendly competitions, such as the Amsterdam Tournament and the Tournoi de Paris. Atlético had the best statistic league records of the 1980, 1983, 1985, 1986 and 1987 Brasileirão seasons, but did not win the title, falling in the finals or semi-finals of those editions. In {{the second half of}} the decade, the club continued its success in the state, winning the Campeonato Mineiro in 1985, 1986, 1988 and 1989. Atlético was one of Brazil's top sides of the 1980s, providing many players to the Brazilian national team, being dominant at state level and having good performances in the Brasileiro, but a tendency to lose in its final knockout stages prevented a new title in this competition.|$|E
5|$|On a team-basis, Malhotra's {{first season}} with the Canucks saw them earn the Presidents' Trophy for <b>having</b> <b>the</b> <b>best</b> regular season record in the league. In {{the midst of his}} recovery, Malhotra made an {{appearance}} during the team's pre-game ceremony at Rogers Arena, co-accepting the trophy with captain Henrik Sedin. Despite original statements from the team that he would not return for the playoffs, Malhotra began working his way up from light practices with the team in May 2011. By the end of the month, he was cleared by doctors to play in the Stanley Cup Finals. Though he remained out of the lineup for Game 1, he returned for the following contest and played the rest of the series as the team's fourth-line centre (late-season acquisition Maxim Lapierre filled in for Malhotra on the third line). Playing against the Boston Bruins, the Finals went to a seventh game, which the Canucks lost. Malhotra's regular season performance earned him six first-place votes out of 125 for the Selke Trophy. He ranked fifth in balloting, as teammate Ryan Kesler won the distinction at the year-end Awards Ceremony.|$|E

Back with the Wings, he centered a line with Brady Leisenring and Andrew Fournier and had a 12-game point-scoring streak early in the season. In early January, Daavettila was loaned to the Griffins, where he played in one game before being returned. He was named ECHL Player of the Week for the week ending on February13 after scoring five goals and two assists in four games, including his first professional hat trick on February12 against the Greenville Road Warriors.

Daavettila was also named an ECHL second-team all-star and shared the ECHL Reebok Plus Performer Award with Brendan Connolly of the Greenville Road Warriors. In the playoffs, Daavettila scored 6goals and 22assists in 18games, leading the league in playoff scoring, and helped the Wings defeat the Florida Everblades, Reading Royals and Wheeling Nailers on their way to the Kelly Cup Finals. In that series, Kalamazoo lost to the Alaska Aces 4–1.|$|E
