5|$|A binder {{with the}} film's storyboards {{served as a}} {{reference}} for live-action filming, shots that would be filmed {{in front of a}} chroma key blue screen, and shots that would be composed using CGI. The sets were often built with the parts that would be required on screen; often they were built only up to the heights of the actors. Chroma key was extensively used for <b>digital</b> <b>set</b> extensions, backgrounds or scenes that required cinematographer David Tattersall to seek powerful lamps to light the sets and visual effects supervisor John Knoll to develop software that would remove the blue reflection from shiny floors. Knoll, who remained on set through most of the production, worked closely with Tatterstall to ensure that the shots were suitable to add effects later. The cameras were fitted with data capture models to provide technical data for the CGI artists.|$|E
500|$|Filming of {{the final}} episode began on Friday, February 25, after {{the first half of}} the day was spent {{completing}} [...] "Terra Prime". Principal photography took eight days to complete, one day longer than usual. The snowy complex set of Rigel X, first seen in the pilot episode, was used, as was the rarely seen Enterprises galley. Enterprise-D locations such as hallways and the observation lounge were re-created. Frakes and Sirtis arrived at the lot at the same time that a [...] "Save Enterprise" [...] rally was being held outside the gates. Similar to [...] "What You Leave Behind", many of the production staff cameoed for a large crowd scene at the end of the episode, as Archer prepares to give his speech. Fifteen [...] "VIPs" [...] including writers Judith and Garfield Reeves-Stevens, André Bormanis, and Manny Coto joined two dozen extras in forming part of the audience. The rest of the <b>digital</b> <b>set</b> was filled by a computer-generated crowd. After their parts were finished, the final dismissal of each cast member was met with applause. Jolene Blalock and Scott Bakula were the last actors to be released, and Bakula gave a speech thanking the production crew for making the cast feel welcome. Filming ended on Tuesday, March 8, and the sets were struck. Frakes and Sirtis returned on March 9 to complete green screen shots, which would be used when their characters entered or exited the holodeck. [...] Before the episode's release, Berman would not elaborate on the final episode's content, saying [...] "It's going to have some surprising twists and turns. It's somewhat of a valentine." ...|$|E
500|$|The {{transition}} from treatment to storyboards {{took on an}} extra layer of complexity due to the profusion of storylines. Where Toy Story focused heavily on Woody and Buzz, with the other toys serving mostly as sidekicks, A Bug's Life required in-depth storytelling for several major groups of characters. Character design also presented a new challenge, in that the designers had to make ants appear likable. Although the animators and the art department studied insects more closely, natural realism would {{give way to the}} film's larger needs. The team took out mandibles and designed the ants to stand upright, replacing their normal six legs with two arms and two legs. The grasshoppers, in contrast, received a pair of extra appendages to appear less attractive. The story's scale also required software engineers to accommodate new demands. Among these was the need to handle shots with crowds of ants. The film would include more than 400 such shots in the ant colony, some with as many as 800. It was impractical for animators to control them individually, but neither could the ants remain static for even a moment without appearing lifeless, or move identically. Bill Reeves, one of the film's two supervising technical directors, dealt with the quandary by leading the development of software for autonomous ants. The animators would only animate four or five groups of about eight individual [...] "universal ants". Each one of these [...] "universal ants" [...] would later be randomly distributed throughout the <b>digital</b> <b>set.</b> The program also allowed each ant to be automatically modified in subtle ways (e.g. different color of eye or skin, different heights, different weights, etc.). This ensured that no two ants were the same. It was partly based on Reeves's invention of particle systems {{a decade and a half}} earlier, which had let animators use masses of self-guided particles to create effects like swirling dust and snow.|$|E

40|$|Traditionally, foreign {{languages}} were educated in a classroom, {{and although the}} presence of a professor was mandatory it missed the natural interaction that favors an authentic experience with a target language. Over the past few years we have seen an increase in the access to new digital media; as a result the contact with the target language and its native speaker has been simplified. This thesis will investigate the development of intercultural communicative competences acquired while learning a foreign language in different settings. The research is based upon experiences of Dutch students at the University of Utrecht who are taking a course to acquire level B 2 Spanish. Both the differences and the similarities between the control group in the traditional classroom and the experimental group in the 3 D virtual world of Second Life are described in order to answer the research question: In which way does the <b>digital</b> <b>setting,</b> that makes interaction with a native speaker possible, favor the growth of the intercultural communicative competences while learning a foreign language? The first part of this thesis will deal with the theoretic framework of the research. First, it will describe the different theories behind cultural aspects which link to our participants. Secondly, these aspects are linked to the verbal interaction, which allows for a prediction of several patterns that are to be expected in the participants. Third, the communicative context in which the participants take part is explained: the workings of communication and how these workings are translated within the <b>digital</b> <b>setting</b> for educating {{foreign languages}}. Finally, before entering the analysis, the study is explained within its context, presenting the subquestions and its objective. The second part of this thesis will present an analysis of the data. With the research questions we analyze each group based on their tasks, then measuring the progress they made throughout these tasks. First, the experimental group in Second Life is presented, secondly the control group in the traditional classroom. Finally, a comparison between the two groups is made in order to answer the research question. The results show several tendencies in the <b>digital</b> <b>setting</b> that provides more opportunities to develop personal competences comparing it to the traditional classroom. First, {{the presence of a}} native speaker offers more samples of the target language and brings the presence of more cultural knowledge. Consequently, the participants will adopt more easily the discourse of a native speaker. Secondly, the <b>digital</b> <b>setting</b> provides a clearer division within the interaction; the verbal interaction becomes the most important factor which positively influences the turn taking division. Thirdly, there was a noticeable difference {{in the development of the}} two groups: the experimental group increased its efficiency, presenting fewer themes than discussed by the control group, but maintaining the profundity of the themes while dedicating more time to them. The <b>digital</b> <b>setting</b> offers thus a considerable higher possibility for authentic interaction, which in turn allows for more development of intercultural communicative competences. Participants will have the possibility to increase their fluency in the target language greatly. However, although this research provides various examples of stimuli that promote the use of a <b>digital</b> <b>setting,</b> the limited scope of this research requests further investigation into this topic.
