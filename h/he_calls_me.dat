500|$|In 1995, Hanna-Barbera {{producer}} Fred Seibert offered Bakshi {{the chance}} to create two animated short films for Cartoon Network's What a Cartoon!: Malcom and Melvin and Babe, <b>He</b> <b>Calls</b> <b>Me,</b> focusing on a trumpet-playing cockroach named Malcom and his best friend, a clown named Melvin. Both were heavily edited after Bakshi turned them in and he disowned them as a result. Bakshi was subsequently contacted by HBO, which was looking to launch the first animated series specifically for adults, an interest stirred by discussions involving a series based upon Trey Parker and Matt Stone's video Christmas card, Jesus vs. Santa. Bakshi enlisted a team of writers, including his son Preston, to develop Spicy Detective, later renamed Spicy City, an anthology series set in a noir-ish, technology-driven future. Each episode was narrated by a female host named Raven, voiced by Michelle Phillips. The series premiered in July 1997—one month before the debut of Parker and Stone's South Park—and thus became the first [...] "adults only" [...] cartoon series. Although critical reaction was largely unfavorable, Spicy City received acceptable ratings. A second season was approved, but the network wanted to fire Bakshi's writing team and hire professional Los Angeles screenwriters. When Bakshi refused to cooperate, the series was canceled.|$|E

60|$|AMAH. I velly pletty girl {{long time}} ago. Daisy's father, <b>he</b> <b>call</b> <b>me</b> his little lotus flower, <b>he</b> <b>call</b> <b>me</b> his little peach-blossom.

6000|$|... 'No! <b>Call</b> <b>me</b> what I am!--what <b>he</b> <b>called</b> <b>me</b> just now!--but do {{not take}} me away! Strike me, as he struck me!--anything but parting!' ...|$|R
60|$|Xodar {{had been}} at the wheel as I talked with my son, and now <b>he</b> <b>called</b> <b>me.</b>|$|R
6000|$|... "Was {{there ever}} sich ingratitude?" [...] says the Spicy. [...] "I found this year 'oss in a pond, I saves him from drowning, I brings {{him back to}} his master, and <b>he</b> <b>calls</b> <b>me</b> a rascal!" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Trouble? Nothing was the trouble. Except {{with old}} Goglefogle. I made one little break in my {{accounts}}. Why, if old Gogie {{had to keep}} track of seventy-'leven accounts and watch every single last movement of a fool girl that can't even run the adding-machine, why, he'd get green around the gills. He'd never do anything but make mistakes! Well, I guess the old codger must have had a bum breakfast this morning. Wanted some exercise to digest it. Me, I was the exercise--I was the goat. <b>He</b> <b>calls</b> <b>me</b> in, and <b>he</b> <b>calls</b> <b>me</b> down, and me--well, just lemme tell you, Wrenn, I calls his bluff!" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Oh, I do as auntie did," [...] said Mary; [...] "as long as we're not {{away from}} the {{children}} more than a fortnight together I play the game. <b>He</b> <b>calls</b> <b>me</b> `Manalive;' and you must write it all one word, or he's quite flustered." ...|$|E
60|$|Then, {{and then}} only, {{at the very}} last of all our years, <b>he</b> <b>called</b> <b>me</b> by that name.|$|R
60|$|MOON. I'll swear <b>he</b> <b>called</b> <b>me</b> {{an idiot}} and a lout; the words made a deep {{impression}} on me.|$|R
60|$|And yet--and the {{incident}} is delicious--Jake Oppenheimer was intellectually honest. That night, as I was dozing off, <b>he</b> <b>called</b> <b>me</b> with the customary signal.|$|R
6000|$|... 'Call him!' echoed Barnaby, sitting upright {{upon the}} floor, and staring vacantly at Gabriel, as he thrust his {{hair back from}} his face. 'But who can make him come! <b>He</b> <b>calls</b> <b>me,</b> and makes me go where he will. He goes on before, and I follow. He's the master, and I'm the man. Is that the truth, Grip?' ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I don't feel {{nearly so}} wild; {{you know the}} world has come round to me. Touchett and I have kept up a sort of {{parliamentary}} debate {{all the way from}} London. I tell him he's the last of the Tories, and <b>he</b> <b>calls</b> <b>me</b> the King of the Goths--says I have, down to the details of my personal appearance, every sign of the brute. So you see there's life in him yet." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "For {{some time}} I hesitated {{how to change}} it. Then one day I came here to see my friend Giatron--we came {{together}} from Italy. I hand him the note. I ask him please change. He give me the change and I stay {{to have a drink}} with the head waiter, who is a friend of mine. Presently Giatron comes out. <b>He</b> <b>calls</b> <b>me</b> into the office. Then I begin to tremble. He looks at me and I tremble more.|$|E
6000|$|... "She came {{straight}} to Seymour Street from here. She saw him alone first; then <b>he</b> <b>called</b> <b>me</b> in. THAT luxury lasted about an hour." ...|$|R
60|$|So I rose to go, but as I went some impulse {{seemed to}} take him and <b>he</b> <b>called</b> <b>me</b> back and made me sit down again.|$|R
60|$|Each time I saw Ellesworth {{he looked}} a little shabbier than the last. Then one day <b>he</b> <b>called</b> <b>me</b> up on the telephone, and made an appointment.|$|R
6000|$|... "Can't be done; the Sergeant {{has got a}} very nasty job {{down there}} about one o'clock, and I promised to be handy in case <b>he</b> <b>calls</b> <b>me</b> up," [...] and {{he pointed to the}} {{portable}} field telephone that fortunately we had brought with us from England, which was fixed closed by, adding, [...] "if only that silly thing had another few hundred yards of wire, I'd come; but, you see, it hasn't and I must be in touch with the work." ...|$|E
60|$|Were {{therefore}} the tempted but aware, he might say, Ay, Satan, so I am, I am a sinner {{of the biggest}} size, and therefore have most need of Jesus Christ; yea, because I am such a wretch, therefore Jesus Christ calls me; yea, <b>he</b> <b>calls</b> <b>me</b> first: the first proffer of the Gospel is {{to be made to}} the Jerusalem sinner: I am he, wherefore stand back Satan; make a lane, my right is first to come to Jesus Christ.|$|E
6000|$|... "My name's Cornelia; but father, <b>he</b> <b>calls</b> <b>me</b> Corny, which mother {{hates to}} hear the very sound of," [...] said she; [...] "and {{the rest of it}} is Mary Chipperton. Father, he came down here because he had a weak lung, and I'm sure I don't see what good it's going to do him to sit out there in the rain. We'll take a man next time. And father and I'll be sure to be here early to-morrow to go out fishing with you. Good-bye!" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Well, sir," [...] pursued Joe, [...] "this {{is how it}} were. I were at the Bargemen t'other night, Pip;"--whenever he {{subsided}} into affection, <b>he</b> <b>called</b> <b>me</b> Pip, {{and whenever}} he relapsed into politeness <b>he</b> <b>called</b> <b>me</b> sir; [...] "when there come up in his shay-cart, Pumblechook.

6000|$|The Babu looked shyly {{down his}} nose. 'Well, you see, I am fearful man, and I {{do not like}} responsibility. You were sick, you see, and I {{did not know where}} deuce-an'-all the papers were, and if so, how many. So when I had come down here I slipped in private wire to Mahbub--he was at Meerut for races--and I tell him how case stands. He comes up with his men and he consorts with the lama, and then <b>he</b> <b>calls</b> <b>me</b> a fool, and is very rude--' ...|$|E
6000|$|... "But your {{grandmother}} has not died, and your sorrow {{is not of}} the kind that requires or is supposed to require retirement." [...] He gave way at last, and on the Tuesday afternoon Mr. Monk called for him at Mrs. Bunce's house, and went down with him to Westminster. They reached their destination somewhat too soon, and walked the length of Westminster Hall two or three times while Phineas tried to justify himself. [...] "I don't think," [...] said he, [...] "that Low quite understands my position when <b>he</b> <b>calls</b> <b>me</b> a coward." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "He {{looked at}} me, a queer, long look {{that made me}} shiver, and then he walked off, and he never spoke to me again {{directly}} for six months. And from that day he almost never speaks to me except through the children. <b>He</b> <b>calls</b> <b>me</b> names through them. He cuts me every time he can. He does {{everything he can to}} hurt me. He never dresses up, and he wears his hat in the house at all times, and rolls up his sleeves at the table, just because he knows it makes me suffer. Sometimes I think he is crazy, and yet----" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "But I {{have not}} been. It was he that talked with me first. It was he that did every thing first. <b>He</b> <b>called</b> <b>me</b> cousin--and <b>he</b> is my cousin." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Allan," [...] said Anscombe to me {{a little}} later, for by now <b>he</b> <b>called</b> <b>me</b> by my Christian name, [...] "I suppose you haven't heard {{anything}} about those oxen, have you?" ...|$|R

6000|$|... "All right, Colonel! I {{have got}} Sergeant Jackson {{in charge of}} the reliefs in the passage outside, and I think that I can depend upon him, but I will tell him to wake me up {{whenever}} he changes the sentries. I don't say I shall turn out myself, but as long as <b>he</b> <b>calls</b> <b>me</b> I shall know that he is awake, and that it is all right. I had better tell him to call you half an hour before bugle-call, Sullivan, so that you can wake the others and get the wine here; he mustn't be a minute after the half-hour. Thank goodness, we don't have to furnish the outposts to-night." ...|$|E
60|$|Were {{therefore}} the tempted but aware, he might say, 'Ay, Satan, so I am, I am a sinner {{of the biggest}} size, and therefore have most need of Jesus Christ; yea, because I am such a wretch, therefore Jesus Christ calls me; yea, <b>he</b> <b>calls</b> <b>me</b> first; the first proffer of the gospel is {{to be made to}} the Jerusalem sinner; I am he, wherefore stand back, Satan; make a lane, my right is first to come to Jesus Christ.' This now would be like for like. This would foil the devil; this would make him say, I must not deal with this man thus; for then I put a sword into his hand to cut off my head.|$|E
6000|$|... "When I ask {{mother to}} tell me about her once being a gypsy she says I am a bad 'quisitive little girl, and to put on my hat and come with her to the prayer-meeting; and when I asked father to let me see mother's gypsy frock he made me learn Psalm forty-eight by heart. But once I see'd it, and {{it was a long time}} ago, as long as a week ago. Micah Dow gave me rowans to put in my hair, and I like Micah because <b>he</b> <b>calls</b> <b>me</b> Miss, and so I woke in my bed because there was noises, and I ran down to the parlor, and there was my mother in her gypsy frock, and my rowans was in her hair, and my father was kissing her, and when they saw me they jumped; and that's all." ...|$|E
60|$|We rode {{together}} {{to the edge}} of the town, where he desired that I should separate from him. I had saluted, and was turning my horse, when <b>he</b> <b>called</b> <b>me</b> back.|$|R

5000|$|According to a {{biography}} of Natalie Wood, she almost {{did not get the}} role of Judy because Nicholas Ray thought that she did not fit the role of the wild teen character. While on a night out with friends, she got into a car accident. Upon hearing this, Ray rushed to the hospital. While in delirium, Wood overheard the doctor murmuring and calling her a [...] "goddamn juvenile delinquent"; she soon yelled to Ray, [...] "Did you hear what <b>he</b> <b>called</b> <b>me,</b> Nick?! <b>He</b> <b>called</b> <b>me</b> a goddamn juvenile delinquent!
