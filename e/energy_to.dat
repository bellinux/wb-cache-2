5|$|A hydro-electric {{scheme was}} built in 2016 on Radyr Weir to {{generate}} renewable energy. The Radyr Weir scheme channels more than 500 million cubic metres of water per year through two screw turbines {{and is expected to}} generate 400kW — enough <b>energy</b> <b>to</b> power three of the city’s leisure centres — which will save 700 tonnes of CO2 annually.|$|E

5|$|Because no ammonia was {{initially}} {{found in the}} vented material by INMS or UVIS, which could act as an antifreeze, it was thought such a heated, pressurized chamber would consist of nearly pure liquid water with a temperature of at least , because pure water requires more <b>energy</b> <b>to</b> melt.|$|E

5|$|In 1990, Zappa was {{diagnosed}} with terminal prostate cancer. The disease had been developing unnoticed for ten years and was considered inoperable. After the diagnosis, Zappa devoted most of his <b>energy</b> <b>to</b> modern orchestral and Synclavier works.

5|$|In plants, algae, and cyanobacteria, photosystem II uses light <b>energy</b> <b>to</b> remove {{electrons}} from water, releasing oxygen as a waste product. The electrons then {{flow to the}} cytochrome b6f complex, {{which uses}} their <b>energy</b> <b>to</b> pump protons across the thylakoid membrane in the chloroplast. These protons move back through the membrane as they drive the ATP synthase, as before. The electrons then flow through photosystem I and can then either be used to reduce the coenzyme NADP+, {{for use in the}} Calvin cycle, which is discussed below, or recycled for further ATP generation.|$|E

5|$|Jupiter's low axial tilt {{means that}} the poles {{constantly}} receive less solar radiation than at the planet's equatorial region. Convection within {{the interior of the}} planet transports more <b>energy</b> <b>to</b> the poles, balancing out the temperatures at the cloud layer.|$|E
5|$|Liquid xenon {{is used in}} calorimeters {{to measure}} gamma rays, and as a {{detector}} of hypothetical weakly interacting massive particles, or WIMPs. When a WIMP collides with a xenon nucleus, theory predicts it will impart enough <b>energy</b> <b>to</b> cause ionization and scintillation. Liquid xenon is useful for these experiments because its density makes dark matter interaction more likely and it permits a quiet detector through self-shielding.|$|E

40|$|We {{introduce}} the "Energy-based Generative Adversarial Network" model (EBGAN) which views the discriminator as an energy function that attributes low <b>energies</b> <b>to</b> the regions near the data manifold and higher <b>energies</b> <b>to</b> other regions. Similar to the probabilistic GANs, a generator {{is seen as}} being trained to produce contrastive samples with minimal energies, while the discriminator is trained <b>to</b> assign high <b>energies</b> <b>to</b> these generated samples. Viewing the discriminator as an <b>energy</b> function allows <b>to</b> use {{a wide variety of}} architectures and loss functionals in addition to the usual binary classifier with logistic output. Among them, we show one instantiation of EBGAN framework as using an auto-encoder architecture, with the energy being the reconstruction error, in place of the discriminator. We show that this form of EBGAN exhibits more stable behavior than regular GANs during training. We also show that a single-scale architecture can be trained to generate high-resolution images.
