60|$|PRINCE PAUL. They {{have been}} printed {{for the last}} six months, Sire. <b>I</b> <b>knew</b> <b>you</b> <b>would</b> need them.|$|E
60|$|SHE. Dearest boy, <b>I</b> <b>knew</b> <b>you</b> <b>would.</b> I--Sh! [she {{rushes to}} the door, {{and holds it}} ajar, {{listening}} breathlessly].|$|E
60|$|Trick. No, I am {{prepared}} for any foolish freak of yours: <b>I</b> <b>knew</b> <b>you</b> <b>would</b> have a qualm, {{when you came}} to settlement.|$|E
6000|$|... "Hush, Mr. Bertram; not so; do {{not speak}} so. <b>I</b> <b>know</b> that <b>you</b> <b>would</b> not wrong me; <b>I</b> <b>know</b> <b>you</b> <b>would</b> not lead me into trouble--not into further trouble; into worse misery." ...|$|R
60|$|MRS. GWYN. [With {{the same}} quivering smile.] My darling, <b>I</b> <b>know</b> <b>you</b> <b>would,</b> until <b>you</b> {{fell in love}} yourself.|$|R
6000|$|I <b>would</b> send <b>you</b> some {{of these}} PP. Po√®mes of mine, only <b>I</b> <b>know</b> <b>you</b> <b>would</b> never {{acknowledge}} receipt or return them.--Yours, and Rothschild's, ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Aha! Squeaky, <b>I</b> <b>knew</b> <b>you</b> <b>would</b> smell out {{the supper}} double quick," [...] cried Billy with a laugh, {{as he looked}} towards the door.|$|E
6000|$|... "It {{is greater}} humbug," [...] said Rachel. [...] "But <b>I</b> <b>knew</b> <b>you</b> <b>would</b> not agree, at least beforehand, it is {{appreciation}} that I want." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Ah," [...] said Carrie, [...] "that's what I like! You're bracing up; <b>I</b> <b>knew</b> <b>you</b> <b>would!</b> However, I must go back. Breakfast must be cooked." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "There, now, <b>I</b> <b>knowed</b> <b>you</b> <b>would,</b> Coonrod. Now, fawther!" [...] This {{appeal was}} to make the old man say {{something}} in recognition of Conrad's sacrifice.|$|R
6000|$|... "You mean well," [...] Amelius answered; [...] "and I thank <b>you.</b> If <b>you</b> <b>knew</b> what <b>I</b> <b>know,</b> <b>you</b> <b>would</b> {{take her}} upstairs, too. Show the way." ...|$|R
6000|$|... 'Objection!' {{said the}} little man. 'Now be gracious for once, Tommy, {{and say that}} you'd rather they went with us. <b>I</b> <b>know</b> <b>you</b> <b>would.</b> Be gracious, Tommy.' ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Tommy, you're a sport! <b>I</b> <b>knew</b> <b>you</b> <b>would</b> be! Let's {{drink to}} success." [...] She poured some cold dregs of tea into the two cups.|$|E
6000|$|... "O, <b>I</b> <b>knew</b> <b>you</b> <b>would</b> walk up," [...] said Huish. [...] "Now for the letter. There's paper, pens, and ink. Sit {{down and}} I'll dictyte." ...|$|E
6000|$|HESTER. I didn't {{know you}} had heard it. But <b>I</b> <b>knew</b> <b>you</b> <b>would</b> agree with me. A woman who has sinned should be punished, shouldn't she? ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I need hardly {{ask you if}} {{you have}} succeeded in reconnoitring their positions, for <b>I</b> <b>know</b> <b>you</b> <b>would</b> not come back before morning had you not carried out your orders.|$|R
6000|$|... "No, really, Ginger, <b>I</b> <b>know</b> <b>you</b> <b>would</b> do {{anything}} <b>you</b> could, {{but this is}} just something I must worry through by myself. When do you go down to this place?" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Now, lads, <b>I</b> <b>know</b> <b>you</b> <b>would</b> {{rather be}} off. I remember, when I was a midshipman, I was always glad enough to escape, when I had to dine with the captain." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "You're as noble as I thought," [...] said Laura. [...] "I {{knew why}} you hesitated and it wasn't for yourself. But <b>I</b> <b>knew</b> <b>you</b> <b>would</b> go." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "That is right, old fellow; <b>I</b> <b>knew</b> <b>you</b> <b>would</b> if {{you could}} only once peep {{in through the window}} of an evening and see her face." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Papa! papa! I know you! <b>I</b> <b>knew</b> <b>you</b> <b>would</b> come to me! Oh, papa, don't go away again! Crazy Jim {{said you}} were dead! Oh, papa!" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Stern judgments, Alick. <b>I</b> <b>know</b> <b>you</b> <b>would</b> {{not speak}} thus without warrant; but take it {{into account that}} {{marriage}} makes many a girl's selfishness dual, and at last drowns the self." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Suppose I {{should take}} this case, and {{spend an hour}} or two on it, how do <b>I</b> <b>know</b> <b>you</b> <b>would</b> come here each morning to black my boots, as you propose?" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "No {{news of the}} truant?" [...] asked Gaston. [...] "Who but <b>you</b> <b>would</b> {{have thought}} of going after him? Well did <b>I</b> <b>know</b> <b>you</b> <b>would</b> never prosper without me at your elbow." ...|$|R
6000|$|... 'Yes, <b>I</b> <b>knew</b> <b>you</b> <b>would</b> put {{right and}} duty first; and I suppose {{by doing so}} you make it certain to end rightly, one way or other.' ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Yes, {{and that}} gave me courage to come to you, even after {{the way in which}} we parted this morning. <b>I</b> <b>knew</b> <b>you</b> <b>would</b> not {{misunderstand}} me"-- ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I dried {{that out}} for you, sir, for <b>I</b> <b>knew</b> <b>you</b> <b>would</b> want it, and to-morrow morning my man {{will take your}} clothes up to the house." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Oh, <b>I</b> <b>know,</b> David, <b>I</b> <b>know!</b> <b>You</b> <b>would</b> save {{me if you}} could. But maybe --maybe it ain't what {{we think}} it is. Maybe he was outlawed by staying away so long?" ...|$|R
6000|$|However, he conquered {{himself by}} the time he had reached the door, and came back to say, [...] "I beg your pardon, mother, <b>I</b> <b>know</b> <b>you</b> <b>would</b> not say so without need." ...|$|R
60|$|Lyndar. If I {{should be}} so kind a fool, to take This little {{satisfaction}} which <b>you</b> make, <b>I</b> <b>know</b> <b>you</b> <b>would</b> presume some other time Upon my goodness, and repeat your crime.|$|R
6000|$|WISE MAN. <b>I</b> <b>knew</b> <b>you</b> <b>would</b> all say that; {{but do not}} be afraid. I {{will not}} be angry. Tell me the truth. Do you not believe? ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I 've been so busy; and <b>I</b> <b>knew</b> <b>you</b> <b>would</b> {{n't care}} to hear about my doings, for {{they are n't the}} sort you like," [...] {{answered}} Polly.|$|E
6000|$|... "And then," [...] Babbie said, hiding her face, [...] "I {{could not}} tell you what I was because <b>I</b> <b>knew</b> <b>you</b> <b>would</b> loathe me. I could only go away." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I can," [...] thought I, [...] "but {{it would}} not do to {{communicate}} that general idea to you. Besides, if I {{said she did not}} love <b>you,</b> <b>I</b> <b>know</b> <b>you</b> <b>would</b> not believe me." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Of course," [...] she assented slowly. [...] "How stupid of me! Some day I'll show <b>you,</b> but <b>I</b> <b>know</b> <b>you</b> <b>would</b> {{lose the}} way now. If you like, I'll come for you--to the Milan." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "God bless <b>you,</b> Mabel! <b>I</b> <b>know</b> <b>you</b> <b>would,</b> and <b>I</b> do not {{say that}} the feeling is not right, for I suppose it is; and yet I believe there is another that is more so." ...|$|R
