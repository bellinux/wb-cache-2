40|$|ABSTRACT: The {{growth of}} two annual crops, okra (Abelmoschus escutentus) and egg-plant (Solatium melongena and one {{perennial}} crop, andiroba (Carapa guianensis, a native forest tree of Amazonia) under different treatments with organic manure derived from termite nest material of wood-feeding Nasutitermes species was tested (randomized block design). The use of 25 - 100 g of nest material gave no {{significant increase in}} okra productivity, and 25 - 200 g gave no significant response in andiroba. The combined use of NPK with 200 g of nest material gave a significant higher production in egg-plant (total number and total fresh weight of fruits) {{when compared to the}} control (without fertilizer) and to the treatment with NPK only. The results suggest the possibility to use termite nest material to enhance crop production in Amazonia, particularly in combination with low amounts of mineral <b>fertilizer.</b> <b>Research</b> lines for further investigations are outlined...|$|E

Topsoil from this area {{is used in the}} current work to investigate the growth behaviour of Spring wheat (Triticum aestivum L., cv. Paragon) when amended with organo-zeolitic <b>fertilizer.</b> <b>Research</b> has shown that soil substrates amended with ammoniated zeolitic tuff promote large populations of nitrifying bacteria which, as the result of ensuing enzyme reactions, produce available nitrogen together with H+ ions. It appears that the proton activity promotes cation mobilization allowing plant uptake to reach levels which, to a large extent, satisfy the nutritional requirements of the plant; only in the case of Zn is the level far exceeded. Very large differences in plant morphology occur when plants are grown in the amended substrates and the resulting development of large dense root systems, which have the ability to bind soil particles, are particularly important in their ability to reduce surface erosion and pollution from run-off...|$|E

40|$|This paper briefly {{presents}} {{the knowledge of}} plant nutrition in 1900 and its expansion since then in two areas {{the discovery of the}} micronutrients and the absorption of nutrients from soils. Application of macro- and micronutrient fertilizers has contributed substantially to the huge increase in world food production experienced this century. In developed countries, excessive fertilizer use has led to serious problems of nutrient pollution; here, plant nutritionists will be concerned with monitoring nutrient status of crops and soils to maintain crop production with minimum loss of nutrients to the environment, and development of cultivars with high nutrient efficiency in soils with luxury supplies of nutrients. In many developing countries, soil infertility limits productivity; here, plant nutritional research can raise productivity bY diagnosis of nutrient deficiencies and toxicities of crops on previously unfertilized soils, their correction with minimal fertilizer and treatment costs, and development of cultivars with high nutrient efficiency in deficient soils and high tolerance of natural toxicities.

40|$|Soil {{data were}} {{collected}} from a 30 ha commercial field using a 60 m sampling grid. Monitored yield data were also collected in this field between 1996 and 1999, when it had a wheat-processing tomato-bean-sunflower crop rotation. A comparison between SSURGO-NRCS soil-unit definition and field-measured soil data showed that in this field the former are a good approximation and starting point for precision agriculture studies and management. In a second test, the EPIC model, using the SSURGO database soil type definitions, was found to reproduce the yield variability within this field with reasonable accuracy. The model's performance was not as good when tested with data from soil samples, apparently due to the way EPIC simulates water holding capacity from texture information and the lack of some key variables (not sampled), such as water content at field-capacity (FC), wilting-point (WP), and soil saturated conductivity. A set of runs was performed to simulate the yield at 13 point-locations in the field using FC, WP, and bulk density.
