25|$|The {{match with}} Ketchel was {{originally}} {{thought to have}} been an exhibition, and in fact it was fought by both men that way, until the 12th round, when Ketchel threw a right to Johnson's head, knocking him down. Quickly regaining his feet, and very annoyed, Johnson immediately dashed straight at Ketchell and threw a single punch, an uppercut, a punch for which he was famous, to Ketchel's jaw, knocking <b>him</b> <b>out.</b> <b>The</b> punch knocked out Ketchell's front teeth; Johnson can be seen on videotape removing them from his glove, where they had been embedded.|$|E

25|$|The {{character}} was specifically written for Mead, {{who was known}} for his work in musical theatre. Originally, Mead was contracted to the show for a year and was not required to complete any medical training for the role. Lofty is portrayed as a nice person who is likeable and popular. He is very clumsy and occasionally naïve but a brilliant nurse and team player with good intentions. Lofty's backstory states he used his parents' money to party regularly, but when his parents grew tired of his attitude, they kicked <b>him</b> <b>out.</b> <b>The</b> character's introduction saw him found to be living in Robyn Miller (Amanda Henderson) and Max Walker's (Jamie Davis) loft.|$|E
25|$|Except for Brophy, all {{crew members}} of the Lancaster managed to escape the burning bomber. Five left through the front escape hatch {{on the floor of}} the cockpit. When bomb aimer Jack Friday, tried to release the escape hatch cover in the aircraft's nose, the rushing wind ripped it from his hands. The hatch cover caught him above his left eye and knocked him out. He fell into the open hatch and jammed it closed until Flight {{engineer}} Roy Vigars reached him to quickly clip on Friday's parachute and toss <b>him</b> <b>out</b> <b>the</b> hatch while pulling the unconscious crewman's rip cord. Only Mynarski managed to leave via the rear escape door.|$|E

Later that year, Ringer tore his ACL, which kept <b>him</b> <b>out</b> <b>the</b> final six games of the season, and his 'shaky grades' plus a low ACT score took him off the map to attend Ohio State University.

25|$|The creators found {{themselves}} with {{a problem with the}} character of Lt. Aiden Ford (Rainbow Sun Francks) in season two, a first season regular that the producers, and the actor himself, felt had not worked as intended and was highly underused as a result. Unwilling to write <b>him</b> <b>out,</b> <b>the</b> writers came up with an idea to make the character more important, but that downgraded him to recurring. To replace him, they created Ronon Dex as a sidekick for Lt. Col. John Sheppard, but finding an actor with the physical presence and the acting ability necessary was not easy until they saw Jason Momoa's tape. X-files veteran Mitch Pileggi and Kavan Smith were added to the cast in the recurring roles of Col. Steven Caldwell and Maj. Evan Lorne. Paul McGillion's character, Dr. Carson Beckett, became a regular in season two.|$|E
25|$|Tyson {{attacked}} Spinks {{from the}} opening bell, landing a solid left hook in the first ten seconds and forcing Spinks to cover up. Spinks clinched and was driven back to the ropes by another Tyson attack. He moved off the ropes but Tyson trapped him again; a left uppercut and a right hand to the body forced Spinks to take a knee after a minute, which marked the second time Spinks had been knocked down in his professional career since Braxton during the eighth round of their 1983 encounter. Spinks took a count of four before rising. As the two men moved towards each other Tyson turned away from a Spinks right hand and responded with a left-right combination to the head which put Spinks down again. This time {{he was unable to}} rise and referee Frank Cappuccino counted <b>him</b> <b>out.</b> <b>The</b> fight was over after 91 seconds, presently the sixth shortest heavyweight title fight in history. Just ten punches were landed, eight by Tyson, two by Spinks. The round was named round of the year for 1988 by Ring Magazine.|$|E

25|$|The {{situation}} {{continued to}} escalate as a superior {{court ruled that}} neither Alonzo or Robertson should be seated until situation was resolved. They then forwarded {{the case to the}} Indiana Supreme Court who ruled in favor of Robertson. On the morning of February 24, Robertson entered the Senate chamber to take his seat, but as soon as he walked through the door, he was attacked by several Democratic Senators who rushed him and beat him to the floor. The Senate leader ordered him removed from the chamber by guards, who then locked <b>him</b> <b>out.</b> <b>The</b> Republicans immediately went wild, attacking their nearest Democrat. The fight continued for several minutes until one Democrat pulled a gun and fired it into the ceiling threatening to start killing Republicans, ending the fight but making the rest of the building aware of it. The brawl soon spread to the House of Representatives and throughout the building as Republicans began to attack Democrats. Unlike the Senate, the rest of the building had a strong Republican majority, and the Democrats were soon overwhelmed. Six-hundred Republicans then beat down the door of the Senate Chamber and dragged out the Democratic Senators, threatening to kill them. Gray ordered police and other officials to break up the fight, which ended after nearly a full four hours of fighting.|$|E
25|$|The {{severity}} of the wrist injury kept <b>him</b> <b>out</b> <b>the</b> entire 2002–03 season while he recovered and regained his strength. However, in 2003–04, Souray returned {{to play for the}} Canadiens and had a breakout season, amassing a surprising 15 goals and 35 points. He had exceeded expectations with the sudden development of his offensive game, especially given his reputation as a defence-first rearguard throughout his NHL career up to that point. This was of course possible because his powerful slapshot had returned along with his health, he was using his shot more often than ever before, and the Canadiens were giving him plenty of scoring opportunities by using him on the power play and increasing his overall ice time. During this season, he participated in the 2004 All-Star Game for the first time, and shared a win in the Skills Competition's hardest shot contest. Both he and Adrian Aucoin recorded blasts of 102.2mph in the event. During the 2004–05 NHL lockout, he played for Färjestad BK of the Swedish Elitserien. While in Sweden, Souray wrote a correspondence in the Montreal Gazette with the assistance of hockey writer Dave Stubbs. The correspondence chronicled Souray's experience in a new country, and the different style of play that is popular overseas compared to the North American style of play. He also had the chance to represent his home country internationally by playing for Team Canada in the 2005 IIHF World Championships. Due to the lockout, this tournament featured a much higher percentage than usual of NHL players, of which Souray was one.|$|E
500|$|After the end {{of season}} 1, the series producers, and the actor himself, felt that Ford had not worked as {{intended}} and was highly underused as a result. Unwilling to write <b>him</b> <b>out,</b> <b>the</b> writers {{came up with an}} idea to make the character more important, but that downgraded him to a recurring character. Producer Joseph Mallozzi said in 2009 that [...] "We can assume [...] went down [...] with the ship" [...] in [...] "The Hive". Rainbow Sun Francks was disappointed about the evolution of his character, saying Ford did not evolve a backstory which the other characters did. Although Francks called the situation [...] "tough", he reacted positively towards the development of character during the second season.|$|E
