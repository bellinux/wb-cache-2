5|$|<b>If</b> <b>one</b> removes from a 1-tree one of {{the edges}} in its cycle, {{the result is a}} tree. Reversing this process, <b>if</b> <b>one</b> augments a tree by {{connecting}} any two of its vertices by a new edge, the result is a 1-tree; the path in the tree connecting the two endpoints of the added edge, together with the added edge itself, form the 1-tree's unique cycle. <b>If</b> <b>one</b> augments a 1-tree by adding an edge that connects one of its vertices to a newly added vertex, the result is again a 1-tree, with one more vertex; an alternative method for constructing 1-trees is to start with a single cycle and then repeat this augmentation operation any number of times. The edges of any 1-tree can be partitioned in a unique way into two subgraphs, one of which is a cycle and the other of which is a forest, such that each tree of the forest contains exactly one vertex of the cycle.|$|E

60|$|Now, the {{economical}} {{usefulness of}} a thing depends not merely on its own nature, but {{on the number of}} people who can and will use it.
