50|$|The <b>helmeted</b> <b>manakin</b> (Antilophia galeata) {{is a small}} {{species of}} bird in the Pipridae family, the manakins. It {{is found in the}} cerrado and pantanal of Brazil; also {{northeast}} Paraguay, and a border region of northeast Bolivia. Unlike most other manakins, it does not occur in regions with humid primary forest (e.g., the Amazon), but is found in various types of forest and woodland in semi-humid or fairly arid regions, but commonly near water. Until 1998 when the far rarer Araripe manakin was described, the <b>helmeted</b> <b>manakin</b> was {{the only member of the}} genus Antilophia.|$|E
50|$|Fauna include {{maned wolf}} (Chrysocyon brachyurus), cougar (Puma concolor) and {{southern}} crested caracara (Caracara plancus).Other species include the giant anteater (Myrmecophaga tridactyla), rock cavy (Kerodon rupestris), lesser nothura (Nothura minor), <b>helmeted</b> <b>manakin</b> (Antilophia galeata) and hyacinth visorbearer (Augastes scutatus).|$|E
50|$|The <b>helmeted</b> <b>manakin</b> is {{a sexually}} dimorphic species with the male being a black bird {{with a red}} crest; the female is a dull olivish green, with a reduced olive crest. Both sexes have a long tail for a manakin. Unlike many other manakins, the males do not form leks, but have their own territory.|$|E
50|$|Fauna include cougar (Puma concolor), {{crab-eating fox}} (Cerdocyon thous), maned wolf (Chrysocyon brachyurus), ferrets, tufted {{capuchin}} (Sapajus apella), southern tamandua (Tamandua tetradactyla), <b>helmeted</b> <b>manakin</b> (Antilophia galeata), hummingbirds, salamanders and snakes such as boa constrictor (Boa constrictor), rattlesnakes, coral snake (Micrurus lemniscatus) and Bothrops jararacussu.In 2007 {{researchers from the}} PUC Minas observed 27 species of amphibians, including one that is probably new to science.|$|E
50|$|Building of {{the nest}} (an open cup, {{generally}} low in vegetation), incubation for 18 to 21 days, and care of the young for 13 to 15 days are undertaken by the female alone, since most manakins do not form stable pairs. (The <b>helmeted</b> <b>manakin</b> does form pairs, but the male's contribution is limited to defending the territory.) The normal clutch is two eggs, which are buff or dull white, marked with brown.|$|E
5000|$|The Araripe manakin (Antilophia bokermanni) is a {{critically}} endangered bird {{from the family}} of manakins (Pipridae). It was discovered in 1996 and scientifically described in 1998. The species epithet commemorates Brazilian zoologist and wildlife filmmaker Werner Bokermann, who died in 1995. Because of its helmet-like crown it has received the Portuguese name soldadinho-do-araripe which means [...] "little soldier of Araripe". This name also associates it with the related, but more widespread, <b>helmeted</b> <b>manakin</b> (Antilophia galeata), which is known simply as the soldadinho.|$|E
50|$|A {{survey of}} the park and its area of {{influence}} recorded 41 species of mammals, 219 of birds, 4 of reptiles and 50 amphibians.Vertebrates include small mammals such as rodents, marsupials and bats; larger mammals such as paca, fox, maned wolf, tapir and jaguar; primates such as robust capuchin monkeys, howler monkeys and black-tufted marmosets; birds such as guan, hummingbird, seriema and black-chested buzzard-eagle; snakes, lizards, turtles, alligators, frogs and toads.Species endemic to the cerrado are rufous-winged antshrike (Thamnophilus torquatus), <b>helmeted</b> <b>manakin</b> (Antilophia galeata) and curl-crested jay (Cyanocorax cristatellus).|$|E
50|$|Birds include parrots, toucans, emus, buzzards, blue macaws, Merganser, Inhambu-Carapé and sharp-tailed grass tyrant.The veery (Catharus fuscescens) of North America {{lives in}} the unit in from November to February.Nine endemic species of bird have been found. Large-billed antwren (Herpsilochmus longirostris), <b>helmeted</b> <b>manakin</b> (Antilophia galeata) and white-striped warbler (Myiothlypis leucophrys) {{are found in the}} forest {{formations}} of the unit. The collared crescentchest (Melanopareia torquata), rufous-sided pygmy tyrant (Euscarthmus rufomarginatus), curl-crested jay (Cyanocorax cristatellus), shrike-like tanager (Neothraupis fasciata), white-rumped tanager (Cypsnagra hirundinacea) and coal-crested finch (Charitospiza eucosma) are found in the closed cerrado.|$|E
50|$|As {{typical of}} most manakins, {{males and females}} have a strong sexual {{dimorphism}} in {{the colors of the}} plumage. As in the <b>helmeted</b> <b>manakin,</b> it is a relatively large and long-tailed manakin, with a total length of c. 14.5 centimetres. The strikingly patterned males have a predominantly white plumage. With the exception of the white wing coverts, the wings are black as the tail. From the frontal tuft, over the crown, down to the middle back runs a carmine red patch. The iris is red. The females are mainly olive green and have pale green upperparts. They have a reduced olive green frontal tuft.|$|E
40|$|The Cerrado region still {{receives}} {{relatively little}} ornithological attention, {{although it is}} regarded as the only tropical savanna in the world considered to be a biodiversity hotspot. Cerradão is one of the least known and most deforested Cerrado physiognomies and few recent bird surveys have been conducted in these forests. In order to rescue bird records and complement the few existing inventories of this under-studied forest type in the state of São Paulo, we looked for published papers on birds of cerradão. Additionally we surveyed birds at a 314 -ha cerradão remnant located in central São Paulo, Brazil, from September 2005 -December 2006 using unlimited distance transect counts. Out of 95 investigations involving cerradão bird studies, only 17 (18 %) investigations teased apart bird species recorded inside cerradão from those recorded in other physiognomies of Cerrado. Except for one study, no research found more than 64 species in this type of forest, a result shared within many regions from Brazil and Bolivia. Differences in species richness do not seem be related with levels of disturbance of landscape or fragment size. Considering all species recorded in cerradão in Brazil and Bolivia, a compilation of data accumulated 250 species in 36 families and 15 orders. In recent surveys at central São Paulo, we recorded 48 species in 20 families, including the Pale-bellied Tyrant-Manakin Neopelma pallescens, threatened in São Paulo, and the <b>Helmeted</b> <b>Manakin</b> Antilophia galeata, near threatened in the state and endemic to the Cerrado region. Among the most abundant species inside this fragment, none was considered to be neither threatened nor endemic...|$|E
