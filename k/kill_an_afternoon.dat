5|$|In the Second World War {{thousands}} of children were evacuated from metropolitan areas such as London, Birmingham and Liverpool. One evacuee from Woolwich, Patricia Armstrong aged nine, was knocked down by a passenger train and <b>killed</b> on <b>a</b> Saturday <b>afternoon</b> in May 1943 while using the Gelynis foot crossing at Morganstown. She was lodged with a family in Morganstown. As air raids on Cardiff increased, even younger children from Radyr were evacuated to boarding schools at Rhoose and Bridgend.|$|R
5000|$|James Hunter of Rolling Stone {{gave the}} album 4 stars out of 5 and {{commented that the}} band had [...] "found a vital place between art-metal {{seriousness}} and pop pleasure. It begins right away with the trancelike 'Regular John', a track that layers Homme's yelping guitar accents over a fuzzy groove. While other metalheads play around with sequencers, Queens of the Stone Age have {{something a little more}} heated and classical in mind. The rest of the album charges on with its compelling contrasts between Homme's papery vocals and the surrounding rampage. Sometimes the songs explore pure heaviness, as on the wall-rattling 'Walkin' on the Sidewalks'. But more often they thrillingly toy with elements like vocal hooks ('You Would Know') and metal frenzy ('How to Handle a Rope') without giving in to either." [...] Writing in Spin, Joe Gross scored Queens of the Stone Age 7 out of 10, saying [...] "While there's really nothing in this collection worth trading in those Melvins albums for, it's strangely compelling to hear how Homme and his cohorts <b>killed</b> many <b>an</b> <b>afternoon</b> in <b>a</b> thick THC haze with Can's Tago Mago, then worked it into their patented pedal abuse." ...|$|R
50|$|On May 19, 2017, morning, two coyotes {{attacked}} {{a man who}} took his dog {{for a walk in}} Calgary, Alberta. While the man avoided injury, the small dog was <b>killed.</b> That <b>afternoon,</b> <b>a</b> walker suffered another attack around 4:30pm. It seems that yet another attack had occurred the Saturday before, likely by the same pair of animals. The animals have been observed in the small pocket of green (51.149373, -114.089617) for a couple of years, and to feed from a golf clubhouse nearby. So far, city officials have chosen just to close the walking path instead of relocating the aggressive animals from that limited habitat, despite the threat to golfers and a community children play ground just 900m away.|$|R
