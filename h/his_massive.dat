5|$|The series—presented {{as if it}} were a real documentary—depicts the {{everyday}} lives of office employees in the Scranton, Pennsylvania, branch of the fictional Dunder Mifflin Paper Company. In this episode, Robert California (James Spader) decides to sell his mansion following his divorce and Kevin Malone (Brian Baumgartner) suggests that he have an office pool party. There, Erin Hannon (Ellie Kemper) tries to make Andy Bernard (Ed Helms) jealous by flirting with Dwight Schrute (Rainn Wilson). Meanwhile, Robert gives everyone a tour of <b>his</b> <b>massive</b> home.|$|E
5|$|After Bart and Lisa see Krusty the Clown do {{his show}} at the Mt. Splashmore water park on TV, they {{consistently}} irritate and supplicate Homer about going there. Homer gets annoyed, but reluctantly decides to take them there. The family goes to Mt. Splashmore, where Bart, Lisa and Homer ride an intense water slide named H2WHOA!. Due to his weight, Homer gets lodged in the water slide mid-course and the park's rescue crew are forced {{to shut down the}} ride and remove him {{with the help of a}} large crane. Homer is made a fool of on the news for <b>his</b> <b>massive</b> size and admits that he needs to lose weight.|$|E

5|$|Balzac's usual mode of {{revision}} involved vast, complicated edits made to galley proofs {{he received}} from the printer. When creating La Cousine Bette, however, he submitted the work to his editor piece by piece, without viewing a single proof. The book was serialized in Le Constitutionnel from 8October to 3December, and Balzac rushed {{to keep up with}} the newspaper's rapid printing schedule. He produced an average of eight pages each day, but was struck by the unexpected enormity of the story as it evolved. Balzac was paid 12,836 francs for the series, which was later published with Le Cousin Pons as a twelve-volume book by Chiendowski and Pétion. The first collected edition of La Cousine Bette was organized into 132 chapters, but these divisions were removed when Balzac added it to <b>his</b> <b>massive</b> collection La Comédie humaine in 1848.|$|E
5|$|Castle Acre Castle {{was built}} by William de Warenne, the Earl of Surrey, in the manor of Acre during the 1070s. William was a Norman lord who had {{accompanied}} William the Conqueror in the conquest of England in 1066; he was rewarded with extensive estates across England. Acre was already an Anglo-Saxon estate centre {{and at the time}} of the invasion was owned by a wealthy man called Toki, but he was quickly replaced by Frederick, a Flemish lord and William's brother-in-law. When Frederick died around 1070, William acquired control of the manor, which formed part of <b>his</b> <b>massive</b> land holdings across the region.|$|E
5|$|In February 1976, Koubek {{contributed a}} third {{high-rise}} office building to Farragut Square, {{this one a}} brick-and-solarized glass structure with a glass-and-aluminum penthouse at 818 Connecticut Avenue NW. <b>His</b> <b>massive,</b> grid-like 400 North Capitol Street, {{one of the few}} office buildings he designed with a plaza between two wings, opened in June. His 12-story International Square building—with its inverted setbacks above the Farragut West Washington Metro station, ninth-floor balcony with non-structural columns, interior atrium, and ground level set-back retail concourse—opened in November. Originally just a single office building on a corner for a city block, it expanded to occupy nearly the entire block with the addition of two almost identical towers in 1979 and 1980. (The atrium was upgraded and a fountain added in 1992.) Two blocks to the west, in April 1977 Koubek also designed a fairly nondescript office building at 1990 K Street NW.|$|E

50|$|George W. Palmer (February 22, 1894 - April 1972) was a Democratic State Senator from Prince Edward County, Virginia and was {{a school}} board member {{during the period of}} <b>his</b> county's <b>massive</b> {{resistance}} opposition to racial integration of the public schools.|$|R
5|$|Link can {{transform}} at will into different creatures: the Deku Mask transforms Link into a Deku Scrub, the Goron Mask into a Goron, and the Zora Mask into a Zora. Each form features unique abilities: Deku Link can perform a spin attack, shoot bubbles from his mouth, skip on water, and fly {{for a short}} time by launching from Deku Flowers; Goron Link can roll at high speeds (and grow spikes at higher speeds), punch with deadly force, stomp the ground with <b>his</b> <b>massive,</b> rock-like body, walk in lava without taking damage, and weigh down heavy switches; Zora Link can swim rapidly, throw boomerang-like fins from his arms, generate a force field, and walk on the bottoms of bodies of water. Many areas can be accessed only by use of these abilities.|$|E
5|$|Scholars debate {{when the}} third Lombard–Gepid War started; {{it is agreed}} that it took place {{two years after the}} second war. The {{possible}} dates are either 551 or 552. The 551 date is upheld by those who argue that since in 552 Audoin had already dispatched 5,500 of his warriors to Narses' Italian campaign, the third Lombard–Gepid War must have already ended by then; against this scholars such as Walter Pohl protest that this is in contradiction with Audoin's reproaches to Justinian on the few troops sent against the Gepids, despite <b>his</b> <b>massive</b> support to Narses.|$|E
5|$|In the 1992–93 season, {{despite a}} 32.6 ppg, 6.7 rpg, and 5.5 apg campaign, Jordan's streak of {{consecutive}} MVP seasons ended as {{he lost the}} award to his friend Charles Barkley. Coincidentally, Jordan and the Bulls met Barkley and his Phoenix Suns in the 1993 NBA Finals. The Bulls won their third NBA championship on a game-winning shot by John Paxson and a last-second block by Horace Grant, but Jordan was once again Chicago's leader. He averaged a Finals-record 41.0 ppg during the six-game series, {{and became the first}} player in NBA history to win three straight Finals MVP awards. He scored more than 30 points in every game of the series, including 40 or more points in 4 consecutive games. With his third Finals triumph, Jordan capped off a seven-year run where he attained seven scoring titles and three championships, but there were signs that Jordan was tiring of <b>his</b> <b>massive</b> celebrity and all of the non-basketball hassles in his life.|$|E

5|$|When Schaefer {{rejected}} Hearst's {{offer to}} suppress the film, Hearst banned every newspaper and station in his media conglomerate from reviewing—or even mentioning—the film. He also had many movie theaters ban it, and many did not show it through fear of being socially exposed by <b>his</b> <b>massive</b> newspaper empire. The Oscar-nominated documentary The Battle Over Citizen Kane lays {{the blame for the}} film's relative failure squarely at the feet of Hearst. The film did decent business at the box office; it went on to be the sixth highest grossing film in its year of release, a modest success its backers found acceptable. Nevertheless, the film's commercial performance fell short of its creators' expectations. Hearst's biographer David Nasaw points out that Hearst's actions were not the only reason Kane failed, however: the innovations Welles made with narrative, as well as the dark message {{at the heart of the}} film (that the pursuit of success is ultimately futile) meant that a popular audience could not appreciate its merits.|$|E
5|$|While {{most of the}} {{employees}} are congregated in the pool area, Robert gives some of the male employees a tour of <b>his</b> <b>massive</b> home, spending {{most of the time}} mournfully describing how it was intended to be the location for wild, uninhibited parties. He offers those present on the tour a free bottle of wine from his wine cellar and the staff proceed to get drunk. Jim Halpert (John Krasinski) had intended to make a token appearance at Robert's party and quickly return home to his wife and kids; however, Robert, sensing his reluctance to be there, insists that Jim stay {{for the duration of the}} tour in order to punish him for laughing at an inopportune moment earlier that day as Robert had complained about having to sell his house. Eventually, Robert realizes that he is hosting one of the parties he had always imagined, at which point he jumps into the pool completely naked, followed by Gabe Lewis (Zach Woods) and Ryan Howard (B. J. Novak), who had both been battling all night to impress him. Jim takes this as his cue to leave, sneaking away and driving home at top speed. At the end of the night, Gabe and Ryan, both drunk and unwilling to concede defeat in their brown-nosing battle, remain at the party with Robert even as the CEO passes out.|$|E

25|$|In the 1960s, Vasyl Avramenko visited Australia and {{experienced}} similar successes in developing dancers {{on yet another}} continent and promoting the Ukrainian Folk-Stage Dance style which he and Vasyl Verkhovynets had pioneered.

25|$|This was the feudal system, {{in which}} new princes and kings arose, the {{greatest}} {{of which was the}} Frank ruler Charlemagne.

25|$|Chang'an {{had been}} settled since Neolithic times, {{during which the}} Yangshao Culture was {{established}} in Banpo in the city's suburb.

25|$|The commander, General Benjamin Butler, {{subjected}} New Orleans to {{a rigorous}} martial law so tactlessly administered as greatly to intensify the hostility of South and North.
