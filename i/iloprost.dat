25|$|The {{prostaglandin}} <b>iloprost</b> is used {{to manage}} critical ischemia and pulmonary hypertension in RP, and the endothelin receptor antagonist bosentan {{is used to}} manage severe pulmonary hypertension and prevent finger ulcers in scleroderma.|$|E
25|$|The primary {{treatment}} is avoiding the cold. Other measures include the discontinuation of nicotine or stimulants use.

Severe disease may rarely be complicated by skin sores or gangrene.|$|E
2500|$|Topical {{treatment}} for the skin changes of scleroderma do not alter the disease course, but may improve pain and ulceration. A range of NSAIDs (nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs) {{can be used to}} ease painful symptoms, such as naproxen. There is limited benefit from steroids such as prednisone. Episodes of Raynaud's phenomenon sometimes respond to nifedipine or other calcium channel blockers; severe digital ulceration may respond to prostacyclin analogue <b>iloprost,</b> and the dual endothelin-receptor antagonist bosentan may be beneficial for Raynaud's phenomenon. The skin tightness may be treated systemically with methotrexate and ciclosporin. and the skin [...] thickness treated with penicillamine.|$|E
5000|$|Vital signs {{should be}} {{monitored}} while initiating inhaled <b>iloprost</b> therapy. Dose adjustments or {{a change in}} therapy should be considered if exertional syncope occurs. Inhaled <b>iloprost</b> should not be initiated in patients with systolic blood pressure lower than 85 mm Hg. <b>Iloprost</b> should be stopped immediately if signs of pulmonary edema occur. This {{may be a sign}} of pulmonary venous hypertension. <b>Iloprost</b> has not been evaluated in patients with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), severe asthma, or with acute pulmonary infections.|$|E
50|$|<b>Iloprost</b> {{activates}} EP2, EP3, and EP4 receptors; it is {{in clinical}} use to treat diseases involving pathological constriction of blood vessels such as pulmonary hypertension, Raynauds disease, and scleroderma. Presumably, <b>Iloprost</b> works by stimulating EP2, and EP4 receptors which have vasodilation actions.|$|E
50|$|<b>Iloprost</b> is a {{synthetic}} analogue of prostacyclin PGI2. <b>Iloprost</b> dilates systemic and pulmonary arterial vascular beds. It also affects platelet aggregation but {{the relevance of}} this effect {{to the treatment of}} pulmonary hypertension is unknown. The two diastereoisomers of <b>iloprost</b> differ in their potency in dilating blood vessels, with the 4S isomer substantially more potent than the 4R isomer. While <b>Iloprost</b> is an analog of PGI2 that activates PGI2's receptor, the Prostacyclin receptor, to stimulate vasodilation, it has little selectivity in that it binds to and activates all four receptors for prostaglandin E2 viz., Prostaglandin EP1 receptor, Prostaglandin EP2 receptor, Prostaglandin EP3 receptor, and Prostaglandin EP4 receptor. Activation of the EP2 and EP4 receptors cause vasodilation but activation of the EP3 receptor causes vasoconstriction.|$|E
5000|$|<b>Iloprost</b> is also {{available}} in an intravenous form, developed and marketed by Schering AG under the trade name Ilomedine. [...] IV <b>iloprost</b> is usually administered diluted, via a peripheral vein or central venous catheter. The diluted <b>iloprost</b> should be delivered by an accurate rate delivery system such as a syringe driver. Doses vary with individuals as side effects are better tolerated by some patients than others. The duration of the treatment is typically 3 days. This is usually repeated every 8 to 12 weeks ...|$|E
50|$|In the U.S., <b>iloprost</b> is inhaled {{specifically}} {{using the}} I-Neb AAD or Prodose AAD delivery systems. In Europe <b>iloprost</b> {{has been approved}} for use with two compressed air nebulizers with AAD delivery systems (Halolite and Prodose) {{as well as with}} two ultrasonic nebulizers Ventaneb and I-Neb.|$|E

50|$|<b>Iloprost</b> {{is a drug}} used {{to treat}} {{pulmonary}} arterial hypertension (PAH), scleroderma, Raynaud's phenomenon and other diseases in which the blood vessels are constricted and blood can't flow to the tissues. This damages the tissues and causes high blood pressure. <b>Iloprost</b> works by opening (dilating) the blood vessels to allow the blood to flow through again. It {{was developed by the}} pharmaceutical company Schering AG and is marketed by Bayer Schering Pharma AG in Europe and Actelion Pharmaceuticals in the USA.|$|E
50|$|Serious {{adverse events}} {{reported}} {{with the use}} of inhaled <b>iloprost</b> include congestive heart failure, chest pain, supraventricular tachycardia, shortness of breath, peripheral edema, and kidney failure.|$|E
50|$|Blood vessel dilating (vasodilating) {{medications}} such as <b>iloprost</b> {{may prevent}} blood vessel blockage. This treatment might be appropriate in grades 2-4 frostbite, {{when people get}} treatment within 48 hours.|$|E
50|$|Complete {{information}} regarding use of <b>iloprost</b> in specific populations (e.g. nursing mothers, pediatrics, patients with hepatic or renal impairment), drug interactions, and overdosage {{can be found}} in full prescribing information.|$|E
5000|$|<b>Iloprost</b> as Ventavis is {{intended}} for inhalation administration only via the I-Neb AAD or Prodose AAD Systems, pulmonary drug delivery devices. It has not been studied with any other nebulizers.|$|E
5000|$|Should {{signs of}} {{pulmonary}} edema occur when inhaled <b>iloprost</b> is administered {{in patients with}} pulmonary hypertension, the treatment should be stopped immediately. This {{may be a sign}} of pulmonary venous hypertension.|$|E
50|$|Pulmonary {{arterial}} hypertension, Who group 1 (see Pulmonary hypertension#Causes), {{in humans}} in commonly treated with specific pulmonary artery vasodilators that increase survival {{such as the}} prostacyclin I2 (PGI2) mimetics including Treprostinil, epoprostanol, <b>Iloprost,</b> and beraprost. Recent studies find that DP1 {{as well as the}} PGI2 receptor protein are expressed in human pulmonary arteries and veins; that treprostinil but not <b>iloprost</b> caused pulmonary vein relaxation in part by acting through DP1 in insolated human pulmonary vascular preparations; and that the effect of treprostinil on DP1 in human pulmonary veins may contribute to its therapeutic efficacy in primary pulmonary hypertension.|$|E

50|$|The first inhaled dose of <b>iloprost</b> {{should be}} 2.5 µg (as {{delivered}} at the mouthpiece). If this dose is well tolerated, dosing should be increased to 5 µg and maintained at that dose. Any patient who cannot tolerate the 5 µg dose should be maintained at 2.5 µg.|$|E
50|$|There is no cure. Treatment {{depends on}} the type of disease. A number of {{supportive}} measures such as oxygen therapy, diuretics, and medications to inhibit clotting may be used. Medications specifically for the condition include epoprostenol, treprostinil, <b>iloprost,</b> bosentan, ambrisentan, macitentan, and sildenafil. A lung transplant may be an option in certain cases.|$|E
50|$|Prostacyclin (prostaglandin I2) is {{commonly}} {{considered the most}} effective treatment for PAH. Epoprostenol (synthetic prostacyclin) is given via continuous infusion that requires a semi-permanent central venous catheter. This delivery system can cause sepsis and thrombosis. Prostacyclin is unstable, and therefore {{has to be kept}} on ice during administration. Since it has a half-life of 3 to 5 minutes, the infusion has to be continuous, and interruption can be fatal. Other prostanoids have therefore been developed. Treprostinil can be given intravenously or subcutaneously, but the subcutaneous form can be very painful. An increased risk of sepsis with intravenous Remodulin has been reported by the CDC. <b>Iloprost</b> is also used in Europe intravenously and has a longer half life. <b>Iloprost</b> was the only inhaled form of prostacyclin approved for use in the US and Europe, until the inhaled form of treprostinil was approved by the FDA in July 2009.|$|E
5000|$|In {{clinical}} studies, common {{adverse reactions}} due to inhaled <b>iloprost</b> included: vasodilation (flushing, 27%), cough (39%), headache (30%), flu syndrome (14%), nausea (13%), neck spasms (12%), hypotension (11%), insomnia (8%), and fainting (syncope) (8%); other serious adverse events reported {{with the use}} of Ventavis included congestive heart failure, chest pain, supraventricular tachycardia, dyspnea, swelling of the limbs (especially around the ankles and feet), and kidney failure.|$|E
50|$|IP {{receptor}} agonists, {{particularly when}} used intravenously, {{have been associated}} with the rapid development of pulmonary edema, hypotension, bleeding due to inhibition of platelet aggregation, and tachycardia. Clinical use of these agonists is contraindicated in patients suffering many conditions. For example, the IP agonist <b>iloprost</b> is contraindicated in patients with unstable angina; decompensated cardiac failure (unless under close medical supervision); severe cardiac arrhythmias; congenital or acquired heart valve defects; increased risk of bleeding; a history of myocardial infarction in the past 6 months; or a history of cerebrovascular events (e.g. stroke) within 3 months.|$|E
50|$|The {{approved}} {{dosing regimen}} for <b>iloprost</b> is 6 to 9 times daily (no more than every 2 hours) during waking hours, according to individual need and tolerability. The significant clinical effects {{observed in the}} pivotal study of patients with PAH were achieved with a median dose of 30 µg per day (range: 12.5 to 45 µg delivered at the mouthpiece), corresponding to 6 daily inhalations of 5 µg. The majority of patients (> 80%) in the pivotal study used this median dose or a higher dose with an excellent treatment compliance after 12 weeks.|$|E
50|$|Topical {{treatment}} for the skin changes of scleroderma do not alter the disease course, but may improve pain and ulceration. A range of NSAIDs (nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs) {{can be used to}} ease painful symptoms, such as naproxen. There is limited benefit from steroids such as prednisone. Episodes of Raynaud's phenomenon sometimes respond to nifedipine or other calcium channel blockers; severe digital ulceration may respond to prostacyclin analogue <b>iloprost,</b> and the dual endothelin-receptor antagonist bosentan may be beneficial for Raynaud's phenomenon. The skin tightness may be treated systemically with methotrexate and ciclosporin. and the skin thickness treated with penicillamine.|$|E
50|$|Standard prostanoids {{have the}} {{following}} relative efficacies as receptor ligands in binding to and activating IP: PGI2>>PGD2=PGE2=PGF2α>TXA2. In typical binding studies, PGI2 has one-half of its maximal binding capacity and cell-stimulating actions at ~1 nanomolar {{whereas the other}} prostaglandins are >50-fold to 100-fold weaker than this. However, PGI2 is very unstable, spontaneously converting to a far less active derivative 6-keto-PGF1 alpha within 1 minute of its formation. This instability makes defining the exact affinity of PGI2 for IP difficult. It also makes it important to have stable synthetic analogs of PGI2 for clinical usage. The most potent of these receptor agonists for binding to and activating IP are <b>iloprost,</b> taprostene, and esuberaprost which have Kd values (i.e. concentrations which bind to half of available IP receptors) in the low nanamole/liter range (http://www.guidetopharmacology.org/GRAC/ObjectDisplayForward?objectId=345/).|$|E
50|$|The FP {{receptor}} is {{the least}} selective of the prostenoid receptors {{in that it is}} responsive to PGD2 {{and to a lesser extent}} PGE2 at concentrations close to those of PGF2α. Standard prostanoids have the following relative efficacies as receptor ligands in binding to and activating FP: PGF2α>PGD2>PGE2>PGI2=TXA2. In typical binding studies, PGF2α has one-half maximal binding and cell stimulating actions at ~1 nanomolar whereas PGD2 and PGE2 are ~5- to 10-fold and 10-100-fold weaker than this. The synthetic analogs that like PGF2α act as selective receptor agonists of FP viz., cloprostenol, flupostenol, latanoprost, and tafluprost (acid form) have FP binding affinities and stimulating potencies similar to PGF2α while others as enprostil, sulprostone, U46619, carbacyclin, and <b>iloprost</b> are considerably weaker FP agonists. Fluprostenol is a widely used clinically as a selective FP receptor agonist; latanoprost is a suitable substitute.|$|E
50|$|PRX-08066 {{is a drug}} {{discovered}} and developed by Predix (later Epix) Pharmaceuticals S. Dhanoa et al. Patent US 7,030,240 B2, which acts as a potent and selective antagonist at the serotonin 5-HT2B receptor, with a 5-HT2B binding affinity (Ki) of 3.4nM, and high selectivity over the closely related 5-HT2A and 5-HT2C receptors and other receptor targets. PRX-08066 and other selective 5-HT2B antagonists are being researched {{for the treatment of}} pulmonary arterial hypertension, following the discovery that the potent 5-HT2B agonist norfenfluramine produces pulmonary arterial hypertension and subsequent heart valve damage. In animal studies, PRX-08066 has been found to reduce several key indicators of pulmonary arterial hypertension and improved cardiac output, with similar efficacy to established drugs for this condition such as bosentan, sildenafil, beraprost and <b>iloprost.</b> It is also being researched for potential anti-cancer applications, due to its ability to inhibit fibroblast activation.|$|E
50|$|IP {{receptor}} agonists are front-line {{drugs to}} treat pulmonary hypertension. Major drugs {{in this category}} include PGI2 itself (i.e. epoprostenol), <b>iloprost,</b> treprostinil, and beraprost with epoprostenol being favored in some studies. However, newly developed IP agonists with favorable pharmacological features such as Selexipag have been granted by the US FDA Orphan Drug status {{for the treatment of}} pulmonary hypertension. IP agonists are also to treat severe vasoconstriction in Raynaud's disease, Raynaud's disease-like syndromes, and scleroderma. Epoprostenol causes improvements in hemodynamic parameters and oxygenation in patients suffering the acute respiratory distress syndrome but due to the limited number of randomized clinical trials and lack of studies investigating mortality, its use cannot be recommended as standard of care for this disease and should be reserved for those refractory to traditional therapies. A meta-analysis of 18 clinical trials on the use of prostanoids including prinicpally IP receptor agonists on patients with sever lower limb peripheral artery disease due to diverse causes found that these drugs may reduce the extent of limb tissue that needed to be amputated. However, the studies did not support extensive use of prostanoids in patients with critical limb ischemia as an adjunct to revascularization or as an alternative to major amputation in cases which cannot undergo revascularization.|$|E
40|$|AbstractObjectivesThis study {{investigated}} the cytoprotective effects of N-acetylcysteine (NAC) and <b>iloprost</b> on spinal cord ischemia in an experimental model. Materials and methodsThirty-five (male) New Zealand white rabbits were included in five study groups (n= 7, each group). One group served as Sham. Rabbits in other groups had their abdominal aorta cross-clamped just above the iliac bifurcation for 40 min. During aortic cross clamping, <b>iloprost,</b> NAC, both <b>iloprost</b> and NAC or saline (control) were infused. ResultsIn NAC, <b>iloprost,</b> and iloprost+NAC groups, neurological status of rabbits (Tarlov score) 24 and 48 h after the operation {{was better than the}} control group (p< 0. 01), but worse than the Sham group (p< 0. 01). There was minimal neuronal damage in the <b>iloprost</b> treated groups compared to the NAC group (p< 0. 05). Mean viability index values in NAC, <b>iloprost</b> and iloprost+NAC groups were higher than the control group (p< 0. 01). Viability index in the NAC group was lower than the <b>iloprost</b> and iloprost+NAC groups. ConclusionsThe use of <b>iloprost</b> and NAC may provide better protection from spinal cord ischemia...|$|E
40|$|OBJECTIVES: This study {{investigated}} the short- and long-term outcome of children with pulmonary arterial hypertension (PAH) treated with inhaled <b>iloprost.</b> BACKGROUND: Inhaled <b>iloprost</b> has been approved {{for the treatment of}} adults with PAH, but {{little is known about the}} effects in children with PAH. METHODS: We evaluated the acute effects of inhaled <b>iloprost</b> on hemodynamic status and lung function and the response to long-term therapy in 22 children (range 4. 5 to 17. 7 years) with PAH (idiopathic, n = 12; congenital heart disease, n = 10). Cardiac catheterization, standard lung function testing before and after <b>iloprost</b> inhalation, 6 -min walk test, World Health Organization functional class, and hemodynamic parameters were monitored. RESULTS: Acute administration of inhaled <b>iloprost</b> lowered mean pulmonary artery pressure equivalent to the response to inhaled nitric oxide with oxygen. Acute <b>iloprost</b> inhalation reduced forced expiratory volume in 1 s and mid-volume forced expiratory flow by 5 % and 10 %, respectively, consistent with acute bronchoconstriction. At 6 months, functional class improved in 35 %, decreased in 15 %, and remained unchanged in 50 % of children. Sixty-four percent of patients continued receiving long-term <b>iloprost</b> therapy, 36 % stopped <b>iloprost,</b> due to lower airway reactivity, clinical deterioration, or death. In 9 patients on chronic intravenous prostanoids, 8 transitioned from intravenous prostanoids to inhaled <b>iloprost,</b> which continued during follow-up. CONCLUSIONS: Inhaled <b>iloprost</b> caused sustained functional improvement in some children with PAH, although inhaled <b>iloprost</b> occasionally induced bronchoconstriction. Most patients tolerated the transition from intravenous to inhaled prostanoid therapy. Clinical deterioration, side effects, and poor compliance, owing to the frequency of treatments, could limit chronic treatment in children...|$|E
