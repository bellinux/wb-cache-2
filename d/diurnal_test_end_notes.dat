Three vehicles with and without evaporative emission control systems have been tested to quantify gasoline evaporative emissions, including both diurnal and running loss emissions. Measurements were made in a Sealed Housing for Evaporative Determination over a range of ambient temperatures. The standard <b>diurnal</b> <b>test</b> shows that evaporative emissions increase progressively with increasing fuel temperature. South African gasoline poweredmotor vehicles exhibitedevaporative emissions 10 times higher than that allowed by the United States Environmental Protection Agency. The extended-time <b>diurnal</b> <b>test</b> shows that the fuel emittedfrom gasoline-poweredmotor vehicles in South Africa is about 97 million litres of gasoline every year...|$|R

40|$|Abstract. In this paper, three typical {{test methods}} for thermal {{efficiency}} of biomass stoves were discussed. The effect {{factors such as}} operation process, <b>test</b> <b>ending</b> time, pot sizes, amount {{of water on the}} thermal efficiency of domestic biomass cookstoves were studied. The results show that the <b>test</b> <b>ending</b> time and the amount of water used have major impacts on thermal efficiency. The amount of water is in positive correlation with the thermal efficiency of the stove (R= 0. 92) when the heat needed for the selected amount of water is less than actual power output of stoves. The thermal efficiency is more controllable and accurate when the <b>test</b> <b>ending</b> time is 2 ℃ lower than the boiling point and the amount of water is selected according to the actual power output of stoves...|$|R
