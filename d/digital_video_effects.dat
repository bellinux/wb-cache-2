2500|$|Though the CG scenes, {{and those}} {{containing}} live action combined with digital elements, {{could have been}} created in a suitable widescreen format, a cost-saving decision was taken to produce them in the 4:3 aspect ratio. The intention was to then crop {{the top and bottom}} of the images, and upscale the resolution for any future widescreen release or broadcast. In 2000, when the show was transferred to widescreen for airing on the Sci-Fi Channel prior to its eventual DVD release, the plan was not followed, as John Copeland recalls: [...] "They did another video hack, and simply used a digital post production device like a DVE (<b>Digital</b> <b>Video</b> <b>Effects)</b> to blow the material up. They essentially stretched it approximately 1/3 to fill the larger aspect ratio." ...|$|E

This {{was based on}} Quantel's own hardware, plus a Hewlett-Packard computer for custom program effects. It was capable of warping a live video stream by texture mapping it onto an arbitrary three-dimensional shape, around which the viewer could freely rotate or zoom in real-time. It could also interpolate, or morph, between two different shapes. It was considered the first real-time 3D <b>video</b> <b>effects</b> processor, and the progenitor of subsequent DVE (<b>Digital</b> <b>video</b> <b>effect)</b> machines. In 1985, Quantel went on to produce [...] "Harry", the first all-digital non-linear editing and effects compositing system.|$|R

It was the first computer that used the just invented (also by Sony) 3.5" [...] micro floppy disk drive that later became industry standard. It had a few distinctive aspects that set it aside from many of it contemporary systems. For example, it did not use a version of Microsoft BASIC, but its own Sony developed BASIC, and it could handle and display kanji characters.|$|R

50|$|Video {{poetry is}} a wide-ranging {{category}} where very different typologies of works converge. Some video poetry works use digital elaboration to achieve Digital poetry that is entirely generated by software. When absent of <b>digital</b> <b>effects,</b> <b>video</b> poetry {{is akin to}} performance works or a poetry reading recorded in <b>video</b> (<b>digital</b> or analogue) but goes beyond the straightforward act of recording to establish a link with video art. In this sense, video poetry is a particular form of video art comprising poetry texts elaborated at various acoustic and visual levels.|$|R

5000|$|<b>Digital</b> <b>Video</b> <b>Effects,</b> {{commonly}} called DVEs, are visual effects that provide comprehensive video image manipulation, {{in the same}} form as optical printer effects in film.

5000|$|... 405 {{involved}} both {{live action}} and computer-generated imagery that took {{three and a}} half months to make. Branit and Hunt taught themselves the use of visual effects software before working as professionals. Both had been working as visual effects artists for a few years before making 405. While Hunt had a degree in filmmaking the use of digital effects software was not commonly taught in school at that time. The camera used to make 405 was a Canon Optura, a type of <b>digital</b> <b>video</b> camera. The <b>effects</b> were done on a Pentium II and Pentium III computer. The software used was LightWave 3D, Digital Fusion, and Adobe Premiere.|$|R
40|$|Digital image {{processing}} has experienced explosive {{growth over the}} past two decades. Public awareness has increased by way of <b>video</b> games, <b>digital</b> <b>video</b> special <b>effects</b> used in the entertainement industry, as well as articles in the mainstream press. However, the most significant impact of digital {{image processing}} in the 90 s will be in the area of applications of real world problems. To help readers keep pace, author Kenneth R. Castleman concentrates on those techniques that have proven most useful in practice. Part I presents several important concepts that can be developed without detailed mathematical analysis for a basic understanding. Part II addresses techniques that rely more on mathematics and eaborates analytically on certain concepts introduced in Part I. Part III covers specific application aread that are particularly in industry, science, and medicine.

5000|$|An {{example of}} {{computing}} power progressing to make non-linear editing possible was {{demonstrated in the}} first all-digital non-linear editing system, the [...] "Harry" [...] effects compositing system manufactured by Quantel in 1985.

5000|$|As {{with all}} video {{switchers}} that use a frame buffer to create DVEs (<b>digital</b> <b>video</b> <b>effects),</b> the video {{path through the}} Toaster hardware introduced delays in the signals when the signal was in [...] "digital" [...] mode.

50|$|Starting in {{the late}} 1970s to the early 1980s, several types of video {{production}} equipment that were digital in their internal workings were introduced, such as time base correctors (TBC) and <b>digital</b> <b>video</b> <b>effects</b> (DVE) units. They operated by taking a standard analog composite video input and digitizing it internally. This {{made it easier to}} either correct or enhance the video signal, {{as in the case of}} a TBC, or to manipulate and add effects to the video, in the case of a DVE unit. The digitized and processed video information was then converted back to standard analog video for output.|$|E
50|$|The video quality first {{introduced}} with Avid's Media Composer in 1989 {{was incapable of}} producing broadcast quality images due to computer processing limitations.
