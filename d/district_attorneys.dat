5|$|Ferraro's first {{full-time}} political job came in , {{when she}} was appointed Assistant District Attorney for Queens County, New York, by her cousin, District Attorney Nicholas Ferraro. At the time, women prosecutors in the city were uncommon.

The following year, Ferraro was assigned to the new Special Victims Bureau, which prosecuted cases involving rape, child abuse, spouse abuse, and domestic violence. She was named head of the unit in 1977, with two other assistant <b>district</b> <b>attorneys</b> assigned to her. In this role, she became a strong advocate for abused children.

25|$|The boroughs were {{originally}} intended to retain some local governance in the consolidated city. Each borough individually elects a borough president and used to elect two at-large city council members, {{in addition to those}} elected based on each borough's population. The borough presidents once wielded considerable power as members of the New York City Board of Estimate, but the position is now largely ceremonial and advisory. Boroughs function as counties for certain purposes, but have no county government. Each of the five New York City <b>district</b> <b>attorneys,</b> however, is still elected by county (for example, the district attorney for Brooklyn is called the Kings County District Attorney).|$|E
25|$|The {{case was}} {{assigned}} to U.S. District Judge Barbara Brandriff Crabb, who scheduled a hearing for March 27. The two county clerks named as defendants supported the plaintiffs' position. <b>District</b> <b>attorneys</b> in Milwaukee and Eau Claire counties agreed not to prosecute the plaintiffs under the marriage evasion law. Prompted by Judge Crabb, who noted that several rulings against state bans of same-sex marriage in other jurisdictions had been stayed, on March 12 the plaintiffs withdrew their request for injunctions against the state's enforcement of both its ban on same-sex marriage and the marriage evasion law, and {{asked the court to}} set an expedited schedule.|$|E

25|$|Drug {{sentencing}} guidelines {{under state law}} in America are generally much less harsh than the federal {{sentencing guidelines}}, although great irregularities exist. The vast majority of drug felonies and almost all drug misdemeanors in the United States are prosecuted at the state level. The federal government tends to prosecute only drug trafficking cases involving large amounts of drugs, or cases which have been referred to federal prosecutors by local <b>district</b> <b>attorneys</b> seeking the harsher sentences provided under the federal sentencing guidelines. In rare instances, some defendants are prosecuted both federally and by the state for the same drug trafficking conduct. The United States Supreme Court has ruled that a defendant does not face double jeopardy if he is convicted and sentenced by {{both the state and}} federal government for the same underlying criminal conduct.|$|E
25|$|The Edge of Night {{played on}} more artistic levels than {{probably}} any other soap of its time. It was unique among daytime soap operas {{in that it}} focused on crime, rather than domestic and romantic matters. The police, <b>district</b> <b>attorneys,</b> and medical examiners of fictional Monticello, USA, dealt with a steady onslaught of gangsters, drug dealers, blackmailers, cultists, international spies, corrupt politicians, psychopaths, and murderous debutantes, {{while at the same}} time coping with more usual soap opera problems like courtship, marriage, divorce, child custody battles, and amnesia. The show's particular focus on crime was recognized in 1980, when, in honor of its 25 years on the air, The Edge of Night was given a special Edgar Award by the Mystery Writers of America. The Edge of Night had more prominent male characters than most soap operas, and included genuine humor in its scripts to balance the heaviness of the storylines.|$|E
25|$|The {{matter is}} then {{taken over by}} a pair of representatives from the New York County District Attorney's Office, an Executive Assistant District Attorney and an Assistant District Attorney. They discuss deals, prepare the {{witnesses}} and evidence, and conduct the People's case in the trial. The <b>District</b> <b>Attorneys</b> work together and with the Medical Examiner's office, the crime laboratory (including fingerprint analysts, DNA profilers and ballistics analysts), and psychologists or psychiatrists (if the defendant uses an insanity plea), all of whom may be needed to testify in court for the prosecution. The police may also reappear to testify in court or to arrest another suspect, but most investigation in the second segment is done by the D.A.'s office, in consultation with the District Attorney for advice on the case, as the D.A., being an elected official, sometimes brings political considerations to bear concerning decisions to prosecute various alleged offenders. If the case is very weak then the police would re-investigate.|$|E
