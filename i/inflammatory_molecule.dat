However, it is not known whether visfatin directly contributes to endothelial dysfunction. Here, we investigated the effect of visfatin on vascular inflammation, a key step in a variety of vascular diseases. Visfatin induced leukocyte adhesion to endothelial cells and the aortic endothelium by induction of the cell adhesion molecules, ICAM- 1 and VCAM- 1. Promoter analysis revealed that visfatin-mediated induction of CAMs is mainly regulated by nuclear factor-κB (NF-κB). Visfatin stimulated IκBα phosphorylation, nuclear translocation of the p 65 subunit of NF-κB, and NF-κB DNA binding activity in HMECs. Furthermore, visfatin increased ROS generation, and visfatin-induced CAMs expression and NF-κB activation were abrogated {{in the presence of the}} direct scavenger of ROS. Taken together, our results demonstrate that visfatin is a vascular <b>inflammatory</b> <b>molecule</b> that increases expression of the inflammatory CAMs, ICAM- 1 and VCAM- 1, through ROS-dependent NF-κB activation in endothelial cells...|$|E

40|$|Ageing has {{pronounced}} {{effects on}} the immune system, including on innate immune cells. Whilst most studies suggest that total numbers of different innate immune cell populations do not change dramatically during ageing, many of their functions such as phagocytosis, antigen presentation and <b>inflammatory</b> <b>molecule</b> secretion decline. In contrast, many endogenous damage-associated molecular patterns (DAMPs) accumulate during ageing. These include reactive oxygen species (ROS) released from damaged mitochondria, extracellular nucleotides like ATP, high mobility group box (HMGB) 1 protein, oxidized low density lipoprotein, amyloid-beta (Aβ), islet amyloid polypeptide and particulates like monosodium urate (MSU) crystals and cholesterol crystals. Some of these DAMPs trigger the activation of inflammasomes, cytosolic danger sensing signalling platforms that drive both the maturation of specific pro-inflammatory mediators such as IL- 1 β, {{as well as the}} initiation of pro-inflammatory pyroptotic cell death. Herein, we review the evidence that dysregulated inflammasome activation, via altered innate immune cell functions and elevated levels of DAMPs, contributes to the establishment of chronic, low-grade inflammation (characterized by elevated levels of IL- 6 and C-reactive protein) and the development of age-related pathological processes...|$|E
40|$|Epidemiologic {{studies have}} linked {{fructose}} intake with the metabolic syndrome, {{and it was}} recently reported that fructose induces an inflammatory response in the rat kidney. Here, we examined whether fructose directly stimulates endothelial inflammatory processes by upregulating the <b>inflammatory</b> <b>molecule</b> intercellular adhesion molecule- 1 (ICAM- 1). When human aortic endothelial cells were stimulated with physiologic concentrations of fructose, ICAM- 1 mRNA and protein expression increased in a time- and dosage-dependent manner, which was independent of NF-κB activation. Fructose reduced endothelial nitric oxide (NO) levels and caused a transient reduction in endothelial NO synthase expression. The administration of an NO donor inhibited fructose-induced ICAM- 1 expression, whereas blocking NO synthase enhanced it, suggesting that NO inhibits endothelial ICAM- 1 expression. Furthermore, fructose resulted in decreased intracellular ATP; administration of exogenous ATP blocked fructose-induced ICAM- 1 expression and increased NO levels. Consistent with the in vitro studies, dietary intake of fructose at physiologic dosages increased both serum ICAM- 1 concentration and endothelial ICAM- 1 expression in the rat kidney. These data suggest that fructose induces inflammatory changes in vascular cells at physiologic concentrations...|$|E
30|$|With {{a central}} role in {{recruiting}} and infiltrating neutrophils into inflammatory sites, IL 8 is known as a main <b>inflammatory</b> <b>molecule</b> involved in host defense against K. pneumoniae infection (Harada et al., 1994). We thus next explored whether NdpA regulates the expression of IL 8 in human alveolar epithelial cells during K. pneumoniae infection. The data from quantitative real-time PCR showed that compared with the wild-type (WT) K. pneumoniae strain, the NdpA-overexpressing K. pneumoniae strain significantly down-regulated the mRNA of IL 8 in A 549 cells (Fig.  1 G). Accordingly, the secretion of IL 8 was apparently attenuated by the overexpression of NdpA in K. pneumoniae as analyzed by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) (Fig.  1 H). To determine whether the inhibitory effects of NdpA on IL 8 production is dependent on ERK signaling pathway, we pretreated A 549 cells with U 0126, a specific inhibitor of ERK pathway, before the infection assay, and we found that the WT K. pneumoniae strain and the NdpA-overexpressing K. pneumoniae strain showed similar amount of IL 8 production during infection of A 549 cells (Fig. S 3 A and S 3 B).|$|E
40|$|SummaryPeroxisome proliferator-activated {{receptor}} γ (PPARγ) is a lipid-activated {{transcription factor}} regulating lipid metabolism and inflammatory response in macrophages and dendritic cells (DCs). These immune cells exposed to distinct inflammatory milieu show cell type specification {{as a result}} of altered gene expression. We demonstrate here a mechanism how <b>inflammatory</b> <b>molecules</b> modulate PPARγ signaling in distinct subsets of cells. Proinflammatory molecules inhibited whereas interleukin- 4 (IL- 4) stimulated PPARγ activity in macrophages and DCs. Furthermore, IL- 4 signaling augmented PPARγ activity through an interaction between PPARγ and signal transducer and activators of transcription 6 (STAT 6) on promoters of PPARγ target genes, including FABP 4. Thus, STAT 6 acts as a facilitating factor for PPARγ by promoting DNA binding and consequently increasing the number of regulated genes and the magnitude of responses. This interaction, underpinning cell type-specific responses, represents a unique way of controlling nuclear receptor signaling by <b>inflammatory</b> <b>molecules</b> in immune cells...|$|R
40|$|Objective: Hematopoietic {{stem cell}} {{transplantation}} (HCT) is a stressful and rigorous medical procedure involving significant emotional and immune challenges. The endocannabinoid (eCB) signaling system {{is involved in}} regulation of both {{the immune system and}} emotional reactivity, yet little is known about its function during HCT. We investigated the role of the eCB signaling system in a group of HCT recipients. Methods: A total of 19 HCT recipients were enrolled and provided psychosocial data and blood samples at three peri-transplant time points: prior to transplant, hospital discharge, and approximately 100 days post-transplant. Psychosocial factors, <b>inflammatory</b> <b>molecules,</b> and the eCBs were determined and assessed for changes over this period and association with each other. Results: HCT recipients demonstrated significant changes over the peri-transplant period in <b>inflammatory</b> <b>molecules</b> and psychosocial functioning, but not in circulating concentrations of the eCBs. Associations among these variables were most likely to be present pre-transplant and least likely to be present immediately post-transplant, with depressive symptoms and inflammation most significantly associated. The eCB 2 -arachidonoylglycerol (2 -AG) was significantly, positively associated with both interleukin (IL) - 6 and C-reactive protein (CRP) and negatively associated with depressive symptoms. Conclusions: The eCB signaling system may have alternative sources and regulatory mechanisms in addition to the immune system. Given the significant associations with <b>inflammatory</b> <b>molecules</b> and depressive symptoms in the peri-transplant period, it is important to better understand this system and its potential implications in the setting of complex and stressful medical procedures such as HCT...|$|R

Its physiologic role is uncertain, as is its cellular mechanism of action. There are no identified resistin receptors on neutrophils, nor are there any known resistin-dependent intracellular signaling pathways. Resistin concentrations ≤ 20  ng/ml do not appear to negatively affect neutrophil migration [10], whereas hyperresistinemia in sepsis has been associated with a greater disease severity and worse outcomes [11, 13, 19]. In some patients, resistin levels remain elevated for 4  weeks or longer after the initial presentation [12, 13].|$|E

This study aimed to investigate the mechanisms by which SM 22 α regulates vascular inflammatory response. The ligation injury model of SM 22 α−/− mice displayed up-regulation of inflammatory molecules MCP- 1, VCAM- 1, and ICAM- 1 in the carotid arteries. Similar results were discovered in human atherosclerotic samples. In vitro studies, overexpression of SM 22 α attenuated TNF-α-induced IκBα phosphorylation and degradation, accompanied by decreased NF-κB activity and reduced <b>inflammatory</b> <b>molecule</b> expression. Using coimmunoprecipitation, we found that SM 22 α interacted with and stabilized IκBα in quiescent VSMCs. Upon TNF-α stimulation, SM 22 α was phosphorylated by casein kinase (CK) II at Thr 139, leading to dissociation of SM 22 α from IκBα, followed by IκBα degradation and NF-κB activation. Our findings demonstrate that SM 22 α is a phosphorylation-regulated suppressor of IKK–IκBα–NF-κB signaling cascades.
