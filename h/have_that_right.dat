25|$|The 1844 Bank Charter Act {{tied the}} issue of notes to the gold {{reserves}} and gave the Bank sole rights with regard to {{the issue of}} banknotes. Private banks that had previously had that right retained it, provided that their headquarters were outside London and that they deposited security against the notes that they issued. A few English banks continued to issue their own notes until the last of them was taken over in the 1930s. Scottish and Northern Irish private banks still <b>have</b> <b>that</b> <b>right.</b>|$|E
500|$|Under U.S. law {{and with}} rare exceptions, people (whether {{criminal}} suspects or defendants or not) {{have the right}} to remain silent as part of their right not to incriminate themselves under the Fifth Amendment to the United States Constitution. Remaining silent is optional—they may speak or be silent as they wish. The Miranda warning concerns the duty of the police or other formal questioners {{to make sure that the}} suspect is aware they <b>have</b> <b>that</b> <b>right</b> prior to questioning, in case they want to be silent at some point or the suspect later pleads ignorance that they had the right (and would have relied upon it had they been aware). Miranda v. Arizona [...] and related cases contemplate that a suspect might invoke their rights (make clear they wish to rely on them), waive their rights (make clear they do not wish to rely on them), or do neither of these. A number of cases such as the present one, refine Miranda by addressing when and at what point a suspect, who is aware that they {{have the right to}} remain silent, is said to have begun to rely on that right, as opposed to when they were aware of the right but were not choosing to rely on it.|$|E

500|$|According to Billboard, In the Zone marks {{a musical}} {{departure}} for Spears. Instead of traditional pop, {{the album is}} darker and more dance-oriented. Spears talked about the overall sound of the album with Rolling Stone, saying, [...] "I'd describe it as trance-y, kind of vibe record—something you could listen to that's no so song-structured [...] Of course I'm not doing '...Baby One More Time' and those massive hits anymore. I think this record is where I am at right now in my life. It's sensual, it's sexual. I'm probably writing about that subconsciously because I don't <b>have</b> <b>that</b> <b>right</b> now." [...] Amy Schriefer of NPR stated the album {{is a mix of}} dance, house, crunk, Diwali beats, reggae and hip hop. According to William Shaw of Blender, the main theme of In the Zone is [...] "Spears’s awakening to her sexuality as a single woman." [...] The first single from the album, [...] "Me Against the Music", [...] features Madonna, but was constructed as a duet after she was added to the track. Spears and Madonna trade lines during the verses, and Madonna sings solo in the bridge. The instrumentation in the song includes influences of hip hop and funk guitars. The song's lyrics feature Spears and Madonna singing of the pleasures of letting go on the dancefloor, in [...] "I'm up against the speaker / Trying to take on the music / It's like a competition". The second song, [...] "I Got That (Boom Boom)", is an Atlanta-style hip hop track featuring the Ying Yang Twins.|$|E
2500|$|Eisenstadt v. Baird (1972) {{extended}} its holding to unmarried couples, whereas the [...] "right of privacy" [...] in Griswold {{was said to}} only apply to marital relationships. The argument in Eisenstadt {{was that it was}} a violation of the Equal Protection Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment to deny unmarried couples the right to use contraception when married couples did <b>have</b> <b>that</b> <b>right</b> (under Griswold). Writing for the majority, Justice Brennan wrote that Massachusetts could not enforce the law against married couples because of Griswold v. Connecticut, so the law worked [...] "irrational discrimination" [...] if not extended to unmarried couples as well.|$|E

Thou art no captive, but a child and free; Thou wast not made for laws, but laws for thee; And thou must use them as thy light will bear it; They that say otherwise, do rend and tear it, More like to wicked tyrants, who are cruel, And add unto a little fire, more fuel. But those who are true shepherds of the sheep, To quench such burnings would most gladly weep.

6000|$|The Judge alludes {{very often}} {{in the course of}} his remarks to the {{exclusive}} right which the States have to decide the whole thing for themselves. I agree with him very readily that the different States <b>have</b> <b>that</b> <b>right.</b> He is but fighting a man of straw when he assumes that I am contending against the right of the States to do as they please about it. Our controversy with him is in regard to the new Territories. We agree that when the States come in as States they have the right and the power to do as they please. We have no power as citizens of the free-States, or in our Federal capacity as members of the Federal Union through the General Government, to disturb slavery in the States where it exists. We profess constantly that we have no more inclination than belief in the power of the government to disturb it; yet we are driven constantly to defend ourselves from the assumption that we are warring upon the rights of the Sates. What I insist upon is, that the new Territories shall be kept free from it while in the Territorial condition. Judge Douglas assumes that we have no interest in them,--that we have no right whatever to interfere. I think we have some interest. I think that as white men we have. Do we not wish for an outlet for our surplus population, if I may so express myself? Do we not feel an interest in getting to that outlet with such institutions as we would like to have prevail there? If you go to the Territory opposed to slavery, and another man comes upon the same ground with his slave, upon the assumption that the things are equal, it turns out that he has the equal right all his way, and you have no part of it your way. If he goes in and makes it a slave Territory, and by consequence a slave State, is it not time that those who desire to have it a free State were on equal ground? Let me suggest it in a different way. How many Democrats are there about here ["A thousand"] who have left slave States and come into the free State of Illinois to get rid of the institution of slavery? [Another voice: [...] "A thousand and one."] I reckon there are a thousand and one. I will ask you, if the policy you are now advocating had prevailed when this country was in a Territorial condition, where would you have gone to get rid of it? Where would you have found your free State or Territory to go to? And when hereafter, for any cause, the people in this place shall desire to find new homes, if they wish to be rid of the institution, where will they find the place to go to? ...|$|E
60|$|I answer, we <b>have</b> <b>that</b> <b>right</b> {{whenever}} the scientific canons of induction {{give it to}} us; that is, {{whenever the}} induction can be complete. We have it, for example, {{in a case of}} causation in which there has been an experimentum crucis. If an antecedent A, superadded to a set of antecedents in all other respects unaltered, is followed by an effect B which did not exist before, A is, in that instance at least, the cause of B, or an indispensable part of its cause; and if A be tried again with many totally different sets of antecedents and B still follows, then it is the whole cause. If these observations or experiments have been repeated so often, and by so many persons, as to exclude all supposition of error in the observer, a law of nature is established; and so long as this law is received as such, the assertion that on any particular occasion A took place, and yet B did not follow, without any counteracting cause, must be disbelieved. Such an assertion is not to be credited on any less evidence than what would suffice to overturn the law. The general truths, that whatever has a beginning has a cause, and that when none but the same causes exist, the same effects follow, rest on the strongest inductive evidence possible; the proposition that things affirmed by even a crowd of respectable witnesses are true, is but an approximate generalization; and—even if we fancy we actually saw or felt the fact which is in contradiction to the law—what a human being can see {{is no more than a}} set of appearances; from which the real nature of the phenomenon is merely an inference, and in this inference approximate generalizations usually have a large share. If, therefore, we make our election to hold by the law, no quantity of evidence whatever ought to persuade us that there has occurred any thing in contradiction to it. If, indeed, the evidence produced is such that it is more likely that the set of observations and experiments on which the law rests should have been inaccurately performed or incorrectly interpreted, than that the evidence in question should be false, we may believe the evidence; but then we must abandon the law. And since the law was received on what seemed a complete induction, it can only be rejected on evidence equivalent; namely, as being inconsistent not with any number of approximate generalizations, but with some other and better established law of nature. This extreme case, of a conflict between two supposed laws of nature, has probably never actually occurred where, in the process of investigating both the laws, the true canons of scientific induction had been kept in view; but if it did occur, it must terminate in the total rejection of one of the supposed laws. It would prove that there must be a flaw in the logical process by which either one or the other was established; and if there be so, that supposed general truth is no truth at all. We can not admit a proposition as a law of nature, and yet believe a fact in real contradiction to it. We must disbelieve the alleged fact, or believe that we were mistaken in admitting the supposed law.|$|E
