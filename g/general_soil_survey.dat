With {{the construction of a}} geographically referenced database taken from the second national <b>general</b> <b>soil</b> <b>survey</b> materials and based on 1546 typical cropland soil profiles, the paddy field and dryland SOC storage among six regions of China were systematically quantified to characterize the spatial pattern of cropland SOC storage in China and {{to examine the relationship between}} mean annual temperature, precipitation, soil texture features and SOC content. In all regions, paddy soils had higher SOC storage than dryland soils, and cropland SOC content was the highest in Southwest China.

The third objective was a characterisation of some of the physical and hydraulic properties of the defined soil variants within the Puketeraki Association. 4. The fourth objective was to use a soil map delineating the soil variants, to subdivide the basin into zones of similar hydrological response, as a method for defining the response units required for building a hydrological response model.

40|$|Soil {{organic carbon}} (SOC) was {{considered}} to be a key index in evaluation of soil degradation and soil C sequestration. To discuss the spatial-temporal dynamics of SOC in arable layer in reversed desertification area, a case study was conducted in Yulin City, Shaanxi Province, China. Data of SOC were based on <b>general</b> <b>soil</b> <b>survey</b> in 1982 and repeated soil sampling in 2003. Soil organic carbon content (SOCC) was determined by K(2) Cr(3) O(7) -FeSO(4) titration method, and soil organic carbon density (SOCD) was calculated by arithmetic average and area weighted average method, respectively. On average, SOCC and SOCD of the arable layer in the study area from 1982 to 2003 had increased 0. 51 g/kg and 0. 16 kg/m(2), respectively. Considering main soil types, the widest distributed Arid-Sandic Entisols had lowest values and increments of SOCC and SOCD during the study period; while the second widest Los-Orthic Entisols had higher values and increments of SOCC and SOCD, compared to the mean values of the whole region. The results indicated that reversed desertification process was due to the modification of land use and management practices, such as natural vegetation recovery, planting grass, turning arable land to grassland, and soil and water conservation etc., which can improve SOCC and SOCD and thus enhance soil C sequestration...|$|E
40|$|A {{small scale}} soil survey (1 : 250, 000) {{was carried out}} in Southern Spain with the aid of Landsat MSS images and medium scale aerial photographs. One of the {{objectives}} of the project was to give a quantitative of the maps resulting from the interpretation of the two types of imagery with a view to testing the reliability of the soil boundaries interpreted from the Landsat imagery, using the API soil map as the standard. The maps were purposely prepared in the following stages in order to facilitate comparison: Visual interpretation of black and white prints and color composites of a spring and autumn scene of Landsat imagery without groundtruth documents. These were reinterpreted with the addition of geological and topographic information, followed by a three-week reconnaissance soil survey. The resulting soil map was shelved. This phase was succeeded by air photointerpretation of representative sample areas chosen {{on the basis of the}} Lands at soil map, followed by six weeks detail field work in the sample areas. The last stage comprised, photointerpretation and three weeks <b>general</b> <b>soil</b> <b>survey</b> outside the sample areas and the final soil map compilation (API). The map comparison consisted of the following: (i) Planimetric measurement of the surface areas of equivalent map units followed by linear regression analysis, (Computer). (ii) Dot-grid count of the overlaid maps. The counts were scored in a rectangular matrix with mapping units of one map against those of the other map. A high correlation co-efficient was obtained for the areas of the two maps by the regression analysis methods. This was tested statistically and was found to be highly significant. According to the dot-grid count, more than 70 % of most of the 9 land types on the Landsat soil map agreed with those on the API soil map. A few however indicated large areas of omission and. commission. The agreement of Landunits on both maps were represented graphically by overlapping squares. The dot-grid method of comparison was more efficient in that it indicated errors of omission and commission...|$|E

30|$|Conventional soil maps provide {{information}} about soil properties that relate to soil genesis, morphology, and classification using polygons for spatial representation (Soil Science Division Staff 2017). The mapping scale is generally dependent upon the specific management goals of the project. Soil data available are usually representative values of named soil types, which are aggregated for spatial representation in polygons. This results in soil map units that can have coarse representation of soil property variability within the polygon. A variety of conventional soil maps have been compiled as the Harmonized World Soil Database (HWSD; Table  1) to provide global coverage (Wieder et al. 2014). These polygon-based maps of global extent generally have coarse spatial resolution and somewhat generalized attribute information due to limitations of mapping such large areas. Many regional soil maps cover individual countries at various resolution and detail. In the US, there are three main soil products including the Digital <b>General</b> <b>Soil</b> Map of the United States (STATSGO 2; <b>Soil</b> <b>Survey</b> Staff 2018 c), <b>Soil</b> <b>Survey</b> Geographic Database (SSURGO; <b>Soil</b> <b>Survey</b> Staff 2018 b), and gridded SSURGO (gSSURGO; <b>Soil</b> <b>Survey</b> Staff 2018 a) (Table  1). These provide more detailed information than global datasets, with estimated soil properties and interpretations for land management (Soil Science Division Staff 2017). While these maps are produced by expert soil scientists, there are limitations on the quantification of soil property variability and spatial distribution across the landscape.|$|R

40|$|Digital {{soil mapping}} {{approaches}} that require quantitative data for prediction {{are difficult to}} implement in countries with limited data on soil and auxiliary variables. However, in many such cases there is a wealth of qualitative information available, such as profile descriptions, catenas or <b>general</b> purpose <b>soil</b> <b>surveys.</b> This type of information opens possibilities for more qualitative approaches to digital soil mapping when quantitative mapping is unfeasible. In this study we used a classification tree approach combined with literature and a small dataset of 40 point SOC observations to map the topsoil organic carbon (SOC) content for a data-poor environment in the Senegalese Peanut Basin. A literature review provided {{an overview of the}} driving factors of soil variability in the Peanut Basin. Geomorphology, topography, vegetation, and land use were identified as the main factors explaining the spatial variation of SOC in the Peanut Basin. These factors were represented in a classification tree by variables that were derived from a digital elevation model and a satellite image. Threshold values and actual predictions for the classification tree were based on literature and the small soil dataset. Next the classification tree was used to create a map of SOC for the study area. Using cluster random sampling, 155 locations were sampled for validation. Validation of the model results showed a poor model performance with large prediction errors. Error analysis showed that although the variables that were used to predict SOC were important sources of variability, a larger soil dataset is needed to better calibrate the classification tree model.

The {{program is designed to}} map, classify and provide interpretative data of human disturbed <b>soils.</b> A <b>soil</b> <b>survey</b> technical advisory committee was formed to ensure participation of survey users. Twenty-five urban soil series concepts have been developed and evaluated during mapping activities. Two intensive <b>soil</b> <b>surveys</b> have been completed in different urban environments. Several studies have been completed in trace elements, quality and temperature of urban soils. The NYC <b>Soil</b> <b>Survey</b> Program scope is dynamic. Future <b>soil</b> <b>survey</b> activities have been planned to continue gaining knowledge of urban soils, their behavior, mapping, interpretation and classification...|$|R
40|$|Paper {{copies in}} Archives, Acc #: 2013 - 0059 <b>Soils</b> have been <b>surveyed</b> {{in various parts}} of Alaska to meet {{resource}} -development needs since territorial days. These surveys have been conducted and published by the National Cooperative <b>Soil</b> <b>Survey</b> since 1952 and are a joint effort of the United States Department of Agriculture Soil Conservation Service and the Alaska Agricultural Experiment Station. Initially, government agencies were the major users of such <b>soil</b> <b>surveys</b> because land ownership was controlled almost entirely by government agencies. However, the demand for soils and geographic information increased substantially as population increased and urban areas grew following the discovery of oil on the Kenai Peninsula during the 1950 s and on the North Slope in the late 1960 s. Interest also heightened when the state gained titles to a large portion of land following statehood in 1959. The National Cooperative <b>Soil</b> <b>Survey</b> (NCSS) published many <b>soil</b> <b>surveys</b> for areas of intensive land use or potential land development. These <b>soil</b> <b>surveys</b> often are underutilized or misused. This publication, "Soil Survey and Its Use in Alaska," was developed over three years based on my field reviews of NCSS activities in Alaska as well as on my discussions with users of <b>soil</b> <b>surveys</b> regarding questions and problems arising from using the reports. In this publication, <b>soil</b> <b>surveys</b> and their use in Alaska are reviewed and discussed...|$|R
