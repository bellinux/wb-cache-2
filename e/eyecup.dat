The RDH 10 protein levels in mouse <b>eyecups</b> and bovine tissues were examined by Western blot analysis using a polyclonal antibody against RDH 10.

40|$|Teleost retinas {{adapted to}} light show {{numerous}} spinules invaginated in the cone pedicles and small nematosomes in the distal horizontal cells. Darkness induces {{the dissolution of}} spinules {{and the presence of}} large and numerous nematosomes. The aim of this work is to study the influence of optic nerve integrity on spinule formation/dissolution and changes in nematosome size during light or dark adaptation of black bass (Micropterus salmoides) retinas. Eyes from fish, dark- or light-adapted, were removed and the <b>eyecups</b> placed in oxygenated Ringer's solution and immediately exposed to light or dark, respectively, for 1 h. The number of spinules per pedicle and the nematosome diameter were measured on electron micrographs. Isolation of <b>eyecups</b> in the dark, impaired both spinule formation and nematosome size reduction when they were superfused in light. In the same way, isolation of <b>eyecups</b> in the light, impaired both spinule dissolution and nematosome size increase when they were superfused in dark. No significant differences in spinule number and nematosome size, following dopamine superfusion, were found in comparison to retinas superfused with Ringer's solution only.

40|$|Retinal {{synthesis}} of melatonin, a potent modulator of rhythmic retinal processes, is elevated at night {{as a result}} of regulation by a circadian clock. Despite high nocturnal synthetic capacity, both melatonin content and release are low in the retina of the frog Xenopus laevis. We report here that cultured <b>eyecups</b> from Xenopus have the capacity for rapid metabolic breakdown of melatonin. Pharmacological analysis indicates that the initial step in this degradation pathway is deacetylation of melatonin by the enzyme aryl acylamidase (aryl-acylamide amidohydrolase, EC 3. 5. 1. 13). This produces 5 -methoxytryptamine, which is then deaminated by monoamine oxidase [amine:oxygen oxidoreductase (deaminating) (flavin-containing), EC 1. 4. 3. 4], producing 5 -methoxyindoleacetic acid and 5 -methoxytryptophol. Inhibition of aryl acylamidase with eserine dramatically increases the release of endogenous melatonin by <b>eyecups</b> cultured at night, indicating that this pathway is the normal fate of retinal melatonin. Metabolism within the eye suggests a local neuromodulatory role for retinal melatonin, in contrast to the hormonal role of pineal melatonin...|$|R

Electron spin resonance (ESR) spectroscopy was shown to provide a quantitative measure of melanin and {{was used as a}} non-destructive measure of melanin content. Results indicated an age-related melanin loss in RPE cells, with melanin content diminishing 2. 5 -fold between the first and the ninth decade of life. To determine whether photo-oxidation may contribute to age-related changes in RPE melanin, RPE in human <b>eyecups,</b> isolated human and bovine RPE cells, purified melanin granules, or synthetic dopa melanin were irradiated with various wavelengths and intensities of visible light. Samples were analysed for changes in melanin content by ESR spectroscopy, and by absorption and emission spectrophotometry. The concentration of hydrogen peroxide was measured in some samples, and some human <b>eyecups</b> were examined by transmission electron microscopy. Irradiation of RPE in <b>eyecups</b> with intense visible light was found to produce a time-dependent photobleaching of melanosomes that was accompanied by the formation of hydrogen peroxide. Photobleaching of isolated RPE melanosomes and synthetic dopa melanin resulted in enhanced melanin fluorescence, as previously shown for melanin from aged donors by others, and significantly reduced ESR signal intensity, resembling the changes in melanin with aging observed here. We conclude that the content of melanin in RPE cells undergoes an age-related change to which photo-oxidation may contribute.

40|$|The {{organization}} of the rod photoreceptor cytoskeleton suggests that microtubules (MTs) and F actin are important in outer segment (OS) membrane renewal. We studied {{the role of the}} cytoskeleton in this process by first quantifying OS membrane assembly in rods from explanted Xenopus <b>eyecups</b> with a video assay for disc morphogenesis and then determining if the rate of assembly was reduced after drug disassembly of either MTs or F actin. Membrane assembly was quantified by continuously labeling newly forming rod OS membranes with Lucifer Yellow VS (LY) and following the tagged membranes' distal displacement along the OS. LY band displacement displayed a linear increase over 16 h in culture. These cells possessed a longitudinally oriented network of ellipsoid MTs between the sites of OS protein synthesis and OS membrane assembly. Incubation of <b>eyecups</b> in nocodazole, colchicine, vinblastine, or podophyllotoxin disassembled the ellipsoid MTs. Despite their absence, photoreceptors maintained a normal rate of OS assembly. In contrast, photoreceptors displayed a reduced distal displacement of LY-labeled membranes in <b>eyecups</b> treated with cytochalasin D, showing that our technique can detect drug-induced changes in basal rod outer segment assembly. The reduction noted in the cytochalasin-treated cells was due to the abnormal lateral displacement of newly added OS disc membranes that occurs with this drug (Williams, D. S., K. A. Linberg, D. K. Vaughan, R. N. Fariss, and S. K. Fisher. 1988. J. Comp. Neurol. 272 : 161 - 176).

Methods: To identify genes that are modulated by β-catenin activity in the embryonic retina, we performed gene expression profiling in Li +-treated retinal explants, a pharmacological model of β-catenin activation. The Li +-modulated gene data set was searched for β-catenin/T-cell specific transcription factor binding sites. Results: Functional annotations of this data set revealed significant enrichments for genes involved in chromatin organization, neurogenesis, and cell motion/migration. Quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction (qRT–PCR) analysis confirmed the modulation of 12 genes in Li +-treated explants and retinas of mice with Cre-mediated induction of constitutively active β-catenin (β-cat act).

40|$|AbstractThe {{epithelial}} {{layers of}} the ciliary body (CB) and iris are non-neural structures that differentiate from the anterior region of the <b>eyecup,</b> the ciliary margin (CM). We show here that activation of the canonical Wnt signaling pathway is sufficient and necessary for the normal development of anterior eye structures. Pharmacological activation of β-catenin signaling with lithium (Li+) treatment in retinal explants in vitro induced the ectopic expression of the CM markers Otx 1 and Msx 1. Cre-mediated stabilization of β-catenin expression in the peripheral retina in vivo induced a cell autonomous upregulation of CM markers {{at the expense of}} neural retina (NR) markers and inhibited neurogenesis. Consistent with a cell autonomous conversion to peripheral eye fates, the proliferation index in the region of the retina that expressed stabilized β-catenin was identical to the wild-type CM and there was an expansion of CB-like structures at later stages. Conversely, Cre-mediated inactivation of β-catenin reduced CM marker expression as well as the size of the CM and CB/iris. Aberrant CB development in both mouse models was also associated with a {{reduction in the number of}} retinal stem cells in vitro. In summary, activation of canonical Wnt signaling is sufficient to promote the development of peripheral <b>eyecup</b> fates at the expense of the NR and is also required for the normal development of anterior <b>eyecup</b> structures...|$|E
