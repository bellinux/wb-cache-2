25|$|In 2008, morale was low at the {{beginning}} of the SuperSonics season as talks with the City of Seattle for a new arena had broken down. The Sonics <b>had</b> <b>gotten</b> <b>a</b> franchise player with second overall pick in the NBA draft with Durant. However, with the Allen trade the Sonics did not have much talent to surround their rookie forward, as they lost their first eight games under coach P. J. Carlesimo on the way to a 3-14 record in the first month of the season. Durant would live up to expectations, as he led all rookies in scoring at 20.3 ppg and won the Rookie of the Year. However, the Seattle SuperSonics posted a franchise worst record of 20-62. It would end up being the final season in Seattle as Bennett ended up getting the rights to move the team after settling all the legal issues with the city.|$|E
25|$|Like other Polish Jews, the Jews {{living in}} Leczna were mostly {{craftsmen}} such as shoemakers, tailors and butchers. In 1674, the Jews constituted 33% of the 547 individuals living in town. Shortly after the Jewish community <b>had</b> <b>gotten</b> <b>a</b> permit {{to establish their}} own synagogue, which still stands on the same place as in the 17th century. The Jewish community of Leczna enjoyed a relatively free and unrestricted everyday life, unlike other towns in eastern Europe and Poland specifically. Although some restrictions were imposed on the production of liquor (Herszek Kodenski, for example, was allowed to produce 400 cauldrons of Vodka, having to pay an annual fee of 400 zloti), owning of pubs, distilleries and other alcoholic facilities was allowed, unlike in other places, and the Jews had rights of to vote for every forth mayor who came from a Christian family. The decision to tax vodka in 1777 made the Jews earn a bigger income, and eventually gained the community the ability to raise a community trust.|$|E
25|$|Robert J. Maynard, Jr., {{a co-founder}} of the company, {{resigned}} in June 2007 amid questions about his past {{and the integrity of}} his story regarding his founding of LifeLock. Maynard spent several days in a Maricopa County Jail in 2003 because of an alleged unpaid $16,000 casino marker from The Mirage. Under Nevada law, casino markers are considered the same as checks. Maynard reportedly came up with the plan for LifeLock while sitting in his jail cell. An investigation by the Phoenix New Times revealed that the $16,000 casino marker actually was his. The Mirage <b>had</b> <b>gotten</b> <b>a</b> copy of his Arizona driver's license when it made him the loan, and charges were dropped after Maynard repaid the marker. The New Times found that Maynard had been banned for life from the credit-repair industry after an agency he owned was shut down for numerous deceptive practices. It found evidence he ordered an American Express card in his father's name and ran up $150,000 in fraudulent charges. Maynard no longer has any affiliation with LifeLock.|$|E

25|$|Several strips made {{allusions to}} Wally's disappearance, {{including}} one featuring Becky Howard's car having a POW/MIA bumper sticker and her placing a U.S. flag on an unidentified grave. In the July 12, 2009, strip, it is finally shown that Wally {{is alive and}} in full military uniform; a backstory revealed that Funky <b>had</b> <b>gotten</b> <b>a</b> call from his ex-wife, Cindy, informing him that Wally was alive {{and that she had}} conducted an interview that was to air on the news that evening. It was revealed that Wally had been held as a prisoner of war in Iraq for the past decade (possibly taken hostage around the time of Lisa's death), and—unaware that he was presumed dead and that Becky had remarried—stated during that interview that what kept him sane during his time in captivity was thinking about his wife and family. Funky visits the Howards to reveal that Wally was alive and in good health. In the August 9, 2009, strip, it was revealed that the grave Becky had visited all these years was that of Wally's assumed remains. Wally has made occasional appearances since his return to Westview, and made his first appearance as a central character in a storyline that began February 1, 2010, strip.|$|E

According to show creator Matt Groening, Phil Hartman was cast in the role due to his ability to pull [...] "the maximum amount of humor" [...] out of any line he was given. McClure's visual appearance {{is similar to that of}} Hartman himself. When he was designed, McClure was given an extra line under his eyes to suggest that the character <b>had</b> <b>gotten</b> <b>a</b> facelift.|$|E

[...] The Spartans were forced to flee to a nearby beach, where Alcibiades landed his men in an attempt to seize the Spartan ships. [...] The Spartans, however, with the assistance of a Persian army, began to drive this Athenian force into the sea; seeing this, Thrasybulus landed his own force to temporarily relieve pressure on Alcibiades, and meanwhile ordered Theramenes to join up with Athenian land forces nearby and bring them to reinforce the sailors and marines on the beach. [...] The Spartans and Persians, overwhelmed by the arrival of multiple forces from several directions, were defeated and driven off, and the Athenians captured all the Spartan ships which were not destroyed.|$|E

500|$|Jeffrey Blitz {{wanted the}} film's music to be [...] "sweet {{and a touch}} melancholy and just a step out of rhythm", demonstrating Hal's sense of himself in the world, and to express his teenage angst while [...] "maintain an {{underlying}} sweetness". While writing the Rocket Science script, Blitz had been listening to indie rock band Clem Snide's music and suggested {{the use of their}} music on the soundtrack to the HBO executive producers. He contacted Clem Snide's lead singer Eef Barzelay to use some of the band's songs, but Barzelay says [...] "it just made more sense for me to write original instrumental music", and composed the incidental score himself. When choosing instruments, he tried to create sounds that would match Hal's awkwardness. [...] "I had this little ukulele that I never played... And Jeffrey [...] <b>had</b> <b>gotten</b> <b>a</b> little bee in his bonnet about the accordion... and then at one point I started using a kazoo." [...] One of his original songs, [...] "I Love the Unknown", was chosen from the 1999 album Your Favorite Music.|$|E
500|$|The SmartBike DC bike sharing service, a {{predecessor}} to Capital Bikeshare, {{debuted in}} 2008 with 10 stations and 120 bicycles. It {{was the first}} of its kind in the United States. D.C. Department of Transportation Director Gabe Klein came into office four months later and he eager to expand it, but found the private partner had a [...] "lackluster commitment." [...] Because the agreement specifically prohibited DDOT from paying for anything related to SmartBike, an expansion required DDOT to renegotiate the contract. But in his first meeting with Clear Channel he found that Clear Channel believed they <b>had</b> <b>gotten</b> <b>a</b> bad deal on the original contract that created SmartBike; that following their purchase by Bain Capital they were no longer interested in [...] "municipal street furniture" [...] and that they had neither desire nor obligation to expand the program. In addition, it was difficult and expensive to install new stations, because they required the local utility company to bring electricity to each station. As a result, Klein chose to end the program and instead work with Arlington County, Virginia, to build a new, regional bikesharing program to be called Capital Bikeshare.|$|E

However, Homer gets recognized by others who take him to the ceremony. Homer arrives in time to see Angry Dad win the Oscar. Bart goes up to accept the Oscar and thanks Lisa for having the idea to make the film into a short film, the animation studio, and Homer.

500|$|Numismatic {{historian}} Don Taxay {{thought it}} likely {{that members of the}} House Committee on Coinage, Weights and Measures had agreed to support a Hawaii half dollar prior to a bill being submitted, as preparations had already begun. Legislation for such was introduced into the House of Representatives by the territory's delegate to Congress, Victor Stewart Kaleoaloha Houston, on December 5, 1927. It was referred to the coinage committee, of which New Jersey Congressman Randolph Perkins was the chair, and which held hearings on the bill on January 23, 1928. Delegate Houston appeared in support of his bill, and to the surprise of committee members, <b>had</b> <b>gotten</b> <b>a</b> statement from Treasury Secretary Andrew Mellon, stating that Mellon did not oppose the bill. [...] Usually, when a commemorative coin was proposed, Mellon argued that a medal should be issued instead. [...] This had been the case for the Norse-American medal three years previously; its sponsor, committee member Ole J. Kvale of Minnesota, had scuttled plans for a coin because of Treasury Department opposition. Congressman Kvale was [...] "very much interested in learning what powers of persuasion have been exercised by the gentleman from Hawaii to bring out such a favorable report". Kvale, a Norse-American, asked, [...] "why this discrimination against two and a half million people in the United States has come about in favor of about 35,000 whites in that Territory?" ...|$|E
500|$|After {{being formed}} and {{finishing}} {{third in the}} seventh series of The X Factor in 2010, One Direction were signed by Simon Cowell to a £2 million Syco Records record contract. Recording for their debut album began in January 2011, as they flew to Los Angeles to work with Moroccan-Swedish producer RedOne. In February 2011, One Direction and nine other contestants from the series participated in the X Factor Live Tour. After the tour concluded in April 2011, the group continued working on their debut album. Recording took place in Sweden, the United States, and the United Kingdom, as One Direction worked with producers Carl Falk, Savan Kotecha, Steve Mac, RedOne, Toby Gad and Rami Yacoub, among others. The album also features songs written by Ed Sheeran, Kelly Clarkson, and Tom Fletcher. In May 2011, Kotecha spoke to Digital Spy, and he elaborated that One Direction were [...] "experimenting" [...] with sounds on their debut album. Kotecha {{said that he was}} involved in the [...] "early stages" [...] of producing the record. [...] "The stuff I've heard has been really catchy and everyone loves the guys, so it's just about capturing that in the music, which I think is what they're going to be doing." [...] Sonny Takhar, {{the chief executive officer of}} Syco Records, in an August 2011 issue of Music Week, described the recording process as a [...] "very intensive period" [...] for the group. Takhar added the resulting album was one of the best pop records made by Syco Records in the past few years, and that he was confident it would be successful. In November 2011, they signed a record deal with Columbia Records in North America. Steve Barnett, the co-chairman of Columbia Records, said it was not a difficult decision to sign with One Direction.

500|$|The bill came to {{the floor}} of the House of Representatives on February 16. [...] As soon as the bill was read, California Representative John E. Raker pressed an {{amendment}} to provide for a California Diamond Jubilee half dollar. He explained that Senator Samuel Shortridge <b>had</b> <b>gotten</b> <b>a</b> bill through the Senate that was nearly identical to his amendment, and [...] "the Senator is exceptionally anxious that it go through." [...] Vestal asked to be heard in opposition to the amendment, stating that his committee, after recommending the Bennington bill, had decided to promote no further coin bills. He added that because of this, Washington Representative Albert Johnson had agreed to withdraw his bill for a commemorative honoring the centennial of Fort Vancouver, in his state. The Minority Leader, Democratic Congressman Finis J. Garrett of Tennessee, asked why the committee had not set the rule before considering the Bennington bill, and Vestal admitted that was hard to answer. The House voted, and the California amendment was added. But Representative Johnson to applause from his colleagues moved a further amendment, to add [...] "and Vancouver, Wash." [...] (that is, the state of Washington) The amendment passed, as did the bill. Johnson realized that such a simple amendment might not result in a coin being issued, and returned to the House floor soon thereafter, asking that the bill be reconsidered, so he could couch his amendment in the same phrasing as for the other two coins. Once the bill was again being considered, Johnson added his amendment, but Vestal moved that the bill be returned to his committee. His motion failed, 24 ayes to 67 noes. Lengthy procedural wrangling followed over whether that vote could be objected to because there was no quorum present. [...] Once this was resolved, the House passed the bill again. The bill was returned to the Senate the following day. Kansas' Charles Curtis moved on behalf of Greene that the Senate agree to the House amendments, [...] and the bill, authorizing all three coins, was enacted by Coolidge's signature on February 24, 1925. Anthony Swiatek and Walter Breen, in their 1988 book on commemoratives, state that the bill would probably not have passed Congress if Coolidge had not been known to have an interest in the Bennington observances.|$|E
