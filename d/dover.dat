5|$|In late 2009, <b>Dover</b> was {{selected}} as a Technical/Coach Advisor for the Canadian dressage team, with a contract that extended through the 2010 World Equestrian Games in Lexington, Kentucky. After the Games, {{it was announced that}} <b>Dover</b> and the Canadian team {{had not been able to}} agree on contract renewal terms, but in late 2010 it was announced that <b>Dover</b> would remain as the interim trainer for the first quarter of 2011. In March 2011, German equestrian Markus Gribbe was hired, and Dover's term as a Canadian coach came to an end. <b>Dover</b> is known for his coaching abilities, with some of the best dressage riders with top international titles to their credit coming from his stables.

5|$|In October 1916, the Flanders Flotilla {{was finally}} {{reinforced}} by the German Admiralty with two full torpedo boat flotillas. The transfer of the 3rd and 9th Torpedo Boat Flotillas to Flanders had immediate consequences to {{the balance of power}} in the <b>Dover</b> Strait. Whereas before, the Flanders Flotilla had been equipped with only three large torpedo boats and several of the smaller inferior A-class torpedo boats, they now possessed 23large torpedo boats capable of meeting the British <b>Dover</b> Patrol in combat. Due to the lack of large torpedo boats, the Flanders Flotilla had not sortied against the <b>Dover</b> Patrol in several months and as a result British defences were quite lax in the area.|$|E
