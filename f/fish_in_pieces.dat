25|$|Maniaq (lit. «roasted thing») is roasted (barbecued) over an {{open fire}} fish. All parts of the fish except the guts are used.

40|$|In {{our project}} we {{investigated}} {{the performance of}} different material used for building {{a part of a}} thermoacoustic engine. We tested 5 materials of 3 types; metal (stainless steel, aluminum), plastic (PET, kapton) and paper (paper tape). We formed stacks from tapes of those materials, rolled with <b>fishing</b> line <b>pieces</b> <b>in</b> between. We put the stacks in the same thermoacoustic device and used electronic devices to control sound wave parameters and collected data. During the experiment we obtained temperature various differences from 2, 1 ⁰C (aluminum) to 17, 18 ⁰C (stainless steel) in frequency range from 250 Hz to 370 Hz. Our experiment showed that the best performing material is stainless steel with the biggest temperature difference, followed by the group of plastics (PET 11, 19 ⁰C and Kapton 11, 38 ⁰C) then paper (with highest temperature difference of 10, 01 ⁰C). In each measurement we did, aluminum stack was the worst, with highest temperature difference of 5, 51 ⁰C. Our results contradict literature which we found while preparing for our experiment...|$|R
40|$|The {{following}} story motivated me {{to write}} this poem [...] One early morning as I walked along the beach at Keppel Sands, Central Queensland (2001), I came across a very large dead cod that had washed up in the tide the night before. Each morning I walked along the shore of Darumbal Country (Rockhampton & Capricorn Coast Region) and looked out across the waters and islands of the Woppaburra (Keppel Islands). From the look of it, the great fish had been pulled up from the deep depths of Woppaburra waters by a big trawler and discarded. It had a large gapping hole in its flesh under its mouth and its eyes had popped. Pamela Croft rang the Livingstone Shire Council who were doing roadworks nearby and organised for a backhoe {{and a few of}} the workmen to help us move the fish. Pamela also had an idea of how to use the great <b>fish</b> <b>in</b> a <b>piece</b> of public art to restore its dignity. By the time the men and equipment arrived and the tide was right to access the fish, children had already poked sticks into its eyes and dogs had biten into its flesh. We placed the fish onto our trailer and drove out of town to the environmental park. We searched around for a place to lay the fish respectfully on the earth. We put it near an ants nest and covered it with chicken wire which we heavily weighted down to stop the dingos getting to it and ripping it apart. The next day a man knocked on my front door asking about the great fish. He wanted it's head to mount on a piece of wood for his bar. I sent him away. The breast plate of the fish has now been cast in bronze and it awaits a suitable public art project. Pamela Croft and I look forward to the day when the great fish will reside within the beach area of the Capricorn Coast again - the day when it will once again look out across Darumbal Country and Woppaburra Country...|$|R

40|$|Shoaling {{behaviour}} {{has been}} shown to provide many benefits to group members. In this study we examined the ability of fish shoals to escape from a novel trawl apparatus. <b>Fish</b> <b>in</b> shoals of 5 found, and escaped through, a hole in the oncoming trawl more quickly than <b>fish</b> <b>in</b> pairs. <b>Fish</b> <b>in</b> the larger shoals displayed a significant decrease in escape latencies over a series of five trawls, providing clear evidence of net avoidance learning, whereas <b>fish</b> <b>in</b> pairs showed no evidence of learning over successive runs. Observations suggested that more information on the location of the escape route was available to <b>fish</b> <b>in</b> larger shoal sizes owing to social stimulation...|$|R
