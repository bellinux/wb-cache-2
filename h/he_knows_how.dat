Janine eventually finds an envelope containing a one-way ticket to Poland and Archie throws her out onto the street telling her <b>he</b> <b>knows</b> <b>how</b> she and Ryan tried to double-cross him. Archie is visited by Jack who threatens to kill him if he hurts Ronnie again. Archie finds Ian searching his living room for the CD and Archie says it is on his laptop and he can make copies at any time, threatening Ian with a phone call to Jane, before ejecting him from the pub. Sam returns and attempts to confront Archie but he shuts the door on her. Ronnie then arrives and tells him with no emotion that he will not make her care for him and she would not care if he died. Archie throws her out onto the street reminding her that it was the exact spot she pushed Danielle onto the night she died.|$|E

While waiting for their flight, Mitchell realizes {{that he does not}} have his wallet - that includes his ID - with him and he has to go back and get it. Phil offers to drive him back home, something that upsets Claire because Phil leaves her alone while <b>he</b> <b>knows</b> <b>how</b> much nervous she is when they are about to fly.

25|$|On Monday 28 December, {{the first}} day of the runoff campaign, the {{incumbent}} president Stjepan Mesić indicated that he supports Ivo Josipović to be his successor. He praised his manifesto and said Croatia needs a president working actively against corruption and for justice. He also insulted Milan Bandić saying it was impossible he only spent 3million kuna for the campaign saying <b>he</b> <b>knows</b> <b>how</b> much a campaign costs. He pleaded for more transparency and called on him to release the names of those who were really financing his campaign. Bandić responded by saying that Mesić hasn't released the names of his donors to this day and that he was a part of both of his campaigns so <b>he</b> <b>knows</b> <b>how</b> nontransparent they were. Mesić called Bandić a liar saying he was the only one in those days to release the name of every single person who contributed to his victory. He said his campaign reports were published, on Croatian, not English, clearly referring to the fact that Bandić couldn't speak proper English. He also suggested there could be one debate held entirely in English, mocking Bandić since he previously claimed he speaks the language. Bandić responded saying he would be glad to attend that debate only if Mesić was moderating it, referring to the fact that the president himself was also not an English speaker. He also called the president an 'old man' saying it was only natural he forgot about the help he provided him during his two campaigns.|$|E

25|$|Lively {{tries to}} {{drive a wedge between}} Kenehan and the miners by convincing a young widow, Bridey Mae Tolliver, to falsely accuse Kenehan of sexual assault, and he plants a letter which makes Kenehan appear to be the infiltrator. Danny Radnor overhears Hickey and Griggs talking about the scheme but is caught and held by the two men. The agents intend to keep a watchful eye on Danny, but become drunk and are not paying {{attention}} that night when Danny, while preaching at the Freewill church, relates a parable about Joseph that convinces the miners that they have been deceived by a false story. One of the miners hurries to the camp to find Few Clothes (James Earl Jones), who had drawn the short straw for who would kill Kenehan for his assumed treachery. Few Clothes tells Kenehan he is there to guard him when he comments on the gun the black miner has. Asked whether <b>he</b> <b>knows</b> <b>how</b> to use it, Few Clothes says yes, {{that he was in the}} Spanish–American War of 1898. Kenehan tells him that he was in Fort Leavenworth Military Penitentiary in 1917, and saw Mennonites imprisoned for refusing to bear arms passively resist having their beards shaved and rip the buttons off their prison clothes, since all these were against their religion. They were punished by being handcuffed to cell bars for eight hours per day, until the cuffs had cut into their wrists and caused gangrene. Despite it all, they ripped off re-sewn buttons with their teeth, not one giving up. Kenehan says he never saw braver men, and ironically they were in there for refusing to fight. This tale of bravery and injustice leaves Few Clothes conflicted and unsure about his mission to execute Kenehan. Another miner arrives and tells Few Clothes the truth and Kenehan's execution is called off just in time. Meanwhile, Sephus has made his way back to town and informed the others of Lively's betrayal, furiously burning down his restaurant. Lively flees town by swimming across the Tug Fork River.|$|E

He is the best one of the province, with a great influence over the minds of the Indians, and <b>he</b> <b>knows</b> <b>how</b> to lead them firmly whenever necessary."

500|$|Before {{his arrival}} on screen, Barber {{described}} Rhys as being determined and focused, while Daniel Kilkelly of Digital Spy said his arrival {{would cause a}} stir. Rhys is ambitious, persuasive and manipulative. His profile on the official Neighbours website states that he believes Erinsborough is [...] "a bit of a backwater", while he {{is more of a}} city guy. Rhys is an enthusiastic young doctor and often riles his colleague, Karl, in his quest to become a surgeon. He wants to succeed and can justify why he does certain things, which hurt other people. Rhys is good at separating his work life from his home life and <b>he</b> <b>knows</b> <b>how</b> to have a good time. Barber revealed that Rhys does have a sensitive side and he can mean well.|$|E
500|$|The {{episode was}} shot in Vancouver during the summer, where {{temperatures}} were over 100 degrees Fahrenheit. Executive producer Jeff Pinkner commented that despite the heat, guest actor Leonard Nimoy [...] "was doing pages and pages of dialogue, and he handled it like a pro," [...] while co-star Joshua Jackson joked that [...] " [...] wife said he practices biofeedback, so <b>he</b> <b>knows</b> <b>how</b> to control his body temperature". Chappelle called the episode [...] "intriguing because it's a summation of everything that came before it, so we're resolving {{a lot of issues}} and a lot of questions. But it's also a springboard into the rest of the season". Actor John Noble, who played Walter Bishop, called it [...] "probably one of our strongest and densest episodes" [...] because it [...] "changes the whole direction of the show".|$|E

He was one of 30 midseason candidates for the John R. Wooden Award and one of 11 finalists for the Bob Cousy Award. He was also invited to the Portsmouth Invitational Tournament. Fran Fraschilla of ESPN named Lin {{as one of the}} 12 most versatile players in college basketball. Lin gained national attention for his performance against the 12th-ranked Connecticut Huskies, against whom he scored a career-high 30 points and grabbed 9 rebounds on the road. After the game, Hall of Fame Connecticut coach Jim Calhoun said of Lin: [...] "I've seen a lot of teams come through here, and he could play for any of them.

500|$|Earlier, in January 1913, the Flood Sufferers {{pulled out}} from the 12-team Central League and joined the newly formed Interstate League, which {{included}} eight clubs. [...] According to Sporting Life, the new league was expected to include teams from Akron, Youngstown, Canton, Steubenville, Wheeling, and either Johnstown or McKeesport. [...] In February, the paper confirmed that the Interstate League (which included Johnstown, not McKeesport) had achieved Class B status {{on the basis of}} the eight cities' combined populations. [...] Sporting Life, which estimated the total population of the league's participating cities at 412,415, noted that Youngstown (with a population of 79,066) was the largest city in the Interstate League. [...] Later that month, the paper reported that the new league's [...] "salary limit of $2000 makes it imperative for each club to hold down expenses in every way; consequently Marty Hogan, of the Zanesville Club, will be the only bench manager in the league, and <b>he</b> <b>knows</b> <b>how</b> to save his salary in various ways".|$|E
500|$|Alison Rowat of The Herald {{perceived}} Doomsday as [...] "decidedly everyday" [...] for a thriller, with Marshall's script {{having too}} many unanswered questions and characters not fully developed despite a decent cast. Rowat said, [...] "In his previous films, Marshall made {{something out of}} nothing. Here he does the opposite". The critic acknowledged the attempted homages and the B-movie approach but thought that [...] "there {{has to be something}} more". Steve Pratt of The Northern Echo weighed in, [...] "As a writer, Marshall leaves gaping holes in the plot while as a director <b>he</b> <b>knows</b> <b>how</b> to extract maximum punch from car chases, beatings and fights without stinting on the gore as body parts are lopped off with alarming frequency and bodies squashed to a bloody pulp." [...] Philip Key of the Liverpool Daily Post described the film, [...] "Doomsday is a badly thought-out science fiction saga which leaves more questions than answers." ...|$|E

500|$|... "Shivers" [...] {{received}} {{critical acclaim}} {{and became a}} major underground success in Australia, bringing more national attention to the band. Nick Cave cited it in hindsight as {{the main reason for}} the Boys Next Door's eminence. In a retrospective review for AllMusic, critic Will Lerner wrote that [...] "it's impressive how, even at this early stage, Nick Cave was a confident and unique singer, perfectly aware of the strengths and limitations of his voice … <b>he</b> <b>knows</b> <b>how</b> to come across in a scary and theatrical manner that perfectly complements the music. Nowhere is this more apparent than on … 'Shivers', an unashamedly melodramatic example of post-adolescent anguish". [...] "Shivers", along with other songs Howard composed, were [...] "crucial to guiding the band in the darker, wilder direction" [...] that defined the Birthday Party's music, according to Dan Lawrence of Stereogum. The song has since been considered an Australian classic and labelled by ABC Television as [...] "possibly Australia's most enduring cult hit".|$|E

David Benioff began by speaking about Sandor [...] "the Hound" [...] Clegane, saying [...] "I think suffering a near death experience probably changes anyone, and that certainly has changed Sandor Clegane. He's a more thoughtful person than he was when we last saw him, he's probably more aware of his vulnerabilities, <b>he</b> <b>knows</b> <b>how</b> close he came to dying, and he's really thinking about his past in a way that he never had before." [...] Weiss continued, [...] "The unfortunate, ugly reality of the kind of pacifism that Ray is preaching is often suicidal when you're {{in the middle of the}} kind of world that they're all in. Something sad about the fact that this person who tried desperately to walk away from what he was is being given no real choice but to go full throttle back in the direction of what he really is, which is a killer." ...|$|E

500|$|Rhys has a {{one-night stand}} with Kate Ramsay (Ashleigh Brewer) not long after his introduction. Rhys meets Kate in the local bar {{and they have a}} [...] "big night out"; the {{following}} morning Kate wakes up in Rhys' apartment. Brewer told a writer for Inside Soap [...] "You don't actually see the lead-up– one minute she meets Rhys in a bar, the next minute we see that they've already slept together!" [...] Kate feels awkward about the situation, but it is made worse when she is unable to remember Rhys' name. When Kate and Rhys meet again, they have different attitudes to their one-night stand. Brewer said Rhys is [...] "a bit of a player", so it is not a big deal to him. He does not have any expectations of Kate, but she is uncomfortable with it and tries to cover her tracks. In November 2011, Brewer said {{it would be interesting to}} revisit the relationship between Rhys and Kate. Barber also thought it would be interesting to see where the characters could go together. The actor added that [...] "sparks fly" [...] when Rhys is around Kate, as <b>he</b> <b>knows</b> <b>how</b> to [...] "press her buttons".|$|E
500|$|As their {{relationship}} progresses, Audrey invites Lewis {{to move in}} with her. Nicholls told Suzanne Byrne of RTÉ Ten that Lewis appears to brush Audrey off, before eventually agreeing to move in. Nicholls said, [...] "And then in his usual charming style he brings her breakfast in bed on her birthday, which she adores him for. He's clever like that, <b>he</b> <b>knows</b> <b>how</b> to bring the balance back to the relationship." [...] In May 2010, the Daily Mirror's Brian Roberts reported that a new plot for Audrey and Lewis could see them leaving Weatherfield for a new life in Greece. The couple go on holiday to a Greek island and Audrey is taken with Lewis' idea of opening a hotel and living a glamorous life out there. Roberts likened the plot development to that of the 1989 film, Shirley Valentine. Roz Laws of the Sunday Mercury noted that Lewis seemed uncomfortable with the plan; Nicholls said that Audrey is unaware of his doubts. Laws also compared the plot to a similar one in another ITV soap opera, Emmerdale, involving Diane Sugden (Elizabeth Estensen) and Charlie Haynes (George Costigan), and predicted that both storylines would end in heartache. Nicholls wanted Audrey and Lewis to leave together and have a happy ending, and wanted to see a spin-off series focusing on the pair and their new life in Greece. Olivia Buxton from the Daily Mirror questioned whether Lewis would go through with the plan; she wrote that two endings to his story arc had been filmed, one of which showed him making a dramatic exit.|$|E

Unbeknownst to everyone, there is a [...] "mystery man" [...] going around TGS in a black cape completing all of the tasks that Kenneth would do. While Jack is recording a video, he catches Kenneth in his office, revealing that Kenneth has been the one completing all of his old tasks. Kenneth {{says that he is}} there because <b>he</b> <b>knows</b> <b>how</b> much he is needed, but Jack tells him that they do not need him and he must move on with his life. Hurt and bewildered, Kenneth leaves, and Jack says in the video for his unborn child that the exchange between him and Kenneth was really [...] "tough love" [...] and he had just sent Kenneth on a journey. Meanwhile, Kenneth Parcell gets a phone call from Angie, who is delirious on pain killers. [...] At the same time, as Tracy is on the game show, Angie tells Kenneth to find Tracy. [...] Unable to do so, Kenneth takes a cardboard cut-out of Tracy and pretends to be him as she is giving birth until Tracy comes in and pushes Kenneth out of the way.
