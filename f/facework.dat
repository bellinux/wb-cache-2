Collectivistic cultures operate in a more indirect, high context <b>facework</b> emphasizing nonverbal subtleties. There are three prevalent <b>facework</b> strategies: dominating, avoiding, and integrating. Dominating <b>facework</b> is characterized by trying to maintain a credible image {{with the goal of}} winning the conflict. Avoiding <b>facework</b> attempts to preserve harmony in the relationship by dealing with the conflict indirectly. Integrating <b>facework</b> focuses on content resolution and maintaining the relationship.|$|E

5000|$|Along {{the face}} concern/orientation dimension, <b>facework</b> is at play before (preventative), during, and after (restorative) the situation. Preventative <b>facework</b> {{is an attempt}} to {{minimize}} face-loss before the threat occurs. Preventative strategies include credentialing, appealing for suspended judgment, pre-disclosure, pre-apology, hedging, and disclaimers. [...] Collectivistic cultures tend to employ more preventative strategies than individualistic cultures. Restorative <b>facework</b> attempts to repair face that was lost. Restorative strategies include excuses, justifications, direct aggression, humor, physical remediation, passive aggressiveness, avoidance, and apologies. [...] Individualistic cultures are more likely to use restorative <b>facework</b> than collectivistic cultures.|$|E
50|$|Reflecting on {{the final}} assumption, intercultural <b>facework</b> {{competence}} consists of another component of face-negotiation theory. <b>Facework</b> competence is conceptualized as an optimal integration of knowledge, mindfulness and communication skills in managing self's and other's face-related concerns. To act competently in an intercultural conflict episode, the theory posits that individuals have to enhance their cultural knowledge and mindfulness in applying context-sensitive <b>facework</b> interaction skills.|$|E

50|$|The {{heart of}} Face Negotiation Theories are 24 propositions. They {{are based on}} the seven {{assumptions}} and five taxonomies that have been proven in numerous cases and studies. They describe <b>facework</b> on three levels of communication: cultural, individual, and situational.|$|E

50|$|Interaction skill {{refers to}} our {{abilities}} to communicate appropriately, effectively and adaptively {{in a given}} situation.

5000|$|Knowledge here {{refers to}} the process of {{in-depth}} understanding of certain phenomenon via a range of information gained through conscious learning and personal experiences.

50|$|Ting-Toomey expands this {{thinking}} and conceptualizes face as an individual's claimed sense of favorable social self-image in a relational and network context. <b>Facework</b> {{is defined as}} clusters of communicative behaviors {{that are used to}} enact self-face and to uphold, challenge/threaten, or support the other person's face.|$|E
50|$|Mindfulness means {{attending}} to one's internal assumptions, cognitions and emotions and simultaneously attuning attentively to the other's assumptions, cognitions and emotions while focusing the five senses. To {{be mindful of}} intercultural <b>facework</b> differences, {{we have to learn}} to see the unfamiliar behavior from a fresh context. Thus, on a general level, mindfulness demands creative thinking and living.|$|E
5000|$|Masumoto, Oetzel, Takai, Ting-Toomey, & Yokochi (2000) defined [...] "facework" [...] as [...] "the {{communicative}} strategies {{one uses}} to enact self-face and to uphold, support, or challenge another person's face". In terms of interpersonal communication, <b>Facework</b> {{refers to an}} individual’s identity in a social world and how that identity is created, reinforced, diminished, and maintained in communicative interactions.|$|E
50|$|<b>Facework</b> {{differs from}} {{conflict}} styles by employing face-saving strategies {{which can be}} used prior to, during, or after a conflict episode and {{can be used in a}} variety of identity-threatening and identity-protection situations. These strategies are focused on relational and face identity beyond conflict goal issues. Conflict styles are specific strategies used to engage or disengage from a conflict situation. Preventative and restorative face-work strategies are typically employed when one's face is being threatened.|$|E

5000|$|This study {{implemented}} {{by the author of}} this theory Stella Ting-Toomey, John Oetzel, Martha Idalia Chew-Sanchez, Richard Harris, Richard Wilcox, and Siegfried Stumpf observed how <b>facework</b> in conflict with parents and siblings is affected by culture, self-concept, and power distance. There were 449 people from four different countries and cultures that participated. Germany, Japan, Mexico, and the United States were the countries used in the study. The survey looked at 3 apprehensions of face and 11 behaviors of [...] "facework". The results are as follows.|$|E
50|$|Ting-Toomey {{asserts that}} several {{conditions}} must {{be perceived as}} severe {{in order for a}} negotiator to feel his face is threatened; the importance of the culturally approved <b>facework</b> that is violated, feelings of mistrust because of a large distance between cultures, the importance of the conflict topic, the power distance between the two parties, and the perception of the parties as outgroup members are all conditions which must be made salient for face-threatening communication to occur. Whether or not a person engages in a conflict depends on how face-threatening the situation is perceived.|$|E
5000|$|Face-negotiation {{theory is}} a theory first {{proposed}} by Brown and Levinson (1978) to understand how people from different cultures manage rapport and disagreements. The theory posits [...] "face", or self-image, as a universal phenomenon that pervades across cultures. In conflicts, one's face is threatened; and thus the person tends to save or restore his or her face. This set of communicative behaviors, according to the theory, is called [...] "facework". Since people frame the situated meaning of [...] "face" [...] and enact [...] "facework" [...] differently from one culture to the next, the theory poses a cultural-general framework to examine <b>facework</b> negotiation.|$|E
5000|$|With these {{concepts}} and frameworks, Face-Negotiation Theory investigates intercultural conflict styles. The perceived or actual conflict differences revolve around three issues: content, relational, and identity. [...] Content conflict {{refers to the}} substantive issues external to the individual involved. Relational conflict refers to how individuals define, or would like to define, the particular relationship in that particular conflict episode. Identity-based conflict concerns issues of issues of identity confirmation-rejection, respect-disrespect, and approval-disapproval. [...] In this way, identity issues are tided closely to culture-based face-orientation factors. A face-threatening episode is an identity expectancy violation episode. Thus, the Face-Negotiation Theory views conflict, intercultural conflict in particular, as a situation that demands active <b>facework</b> management from the two interdependent conflict parties.|$|E
50|$|In 1929 {{the company}} secured {{title to the}} lane off Wickham Street beside their 1912 store, and in 1930-31, just as Australia was being {{caught up in a}} severe, {{worldwide}} economic depression, McWhirters Ltd constructed a four and five-storeyed brick building on the corner of Brunswick and Wickham Streets, linking the facades of their 1912 and 1923 buildings. The steel framed building with reinforced concrete walls and <b>facework</b> in brick and terracotta, was designed by the Brisbane architectural firm of TR Hall and LB Phillips (who also designed the Brisbane City Hall, Shell House, and the Tattersalls Club Members Dining Room). It featured a principal truncated corner, richly decorated in the Art Deco style, which became a landmark advertisement for the store on the busy Valley Corner. The builder was George Alexander Stronach of Brisbane, who tendered with a price of £112,000; the 800 tons of structural steel was manufactured and erected by local firm Evans, Deakin, & Co. Ltd; and Wunderlich supplied the terracotta tiles used on the truncated corner as well as pressed metal and fibrous cement ceilings. McWhirters department store now had a floor space of 6.5 acres.|$|E

This research will investigate how theories of <b>facework</b> might fill particular gaps in LMX theory’s explanations of superior-subordinate communication.

40|$|This {{research}} {{focuses on}} cross-cultural differences in <b>facework</b> between English and German conversation. Specifically, the research addresses <b>facework</b> occurring as {{part and parcel of}} sociable conversation, as it is played out within moments of focused topic development - what I term 'sociable episodes'. Drawing on extant literature, the study identifies a range of communicative parameters along which English and German communicative style has been shown to differ, non more so than those suggesting different <b>facework</b> norms, and orientation to face needs as opposed to such things as ideational aspects of talk. In an attempt to address these differences, the study develops a model of <b>facework</b> - <b>facework</b> as alignment -which is posited as being appropriate to the study of essentially apolite conversational interaction. Further, although utilising the notions of ritual equilibrium (Goffman 1967) and positive - negative aspects of face (Brown and Levinson), the posited model of <b>facework</b> focuses specifically on aspects of sociable selfhood informing sociable conversation. It is argued that <b>facework</b> in sociable episodes is a matter of positive and negative alignment of sociable selves in and through the claiming of solidarity with and autonomy from other co-participants in terms of expressions of definitions, evaluations, experiences. In terms of English - German differences, these are demonstrated {{to be a matter of}} alignment of different sociable selves, ones normatively and routinely positively and negatively aligned in the achievement of sociable conversation, and ones indexing prevailing but culturally differing positive social values (Goffman 1967). The study concludes by identifying areas for future research based on the <b>facework</b> as alignment model developed and applied throughout the thesis.

40|$|According to researchers, face is an {{important}} possession carried by individuals into interactions with others. Face has been studied in diverse areas such as: politeness, compliance gaining, emotional discourse, negotiations, face-negotiation theory, and conflict. Perhaps because of its value, face can be vulnerable during conflict situations. <b>Facework</b> behaviors are the communicative strategies that people use during conflicts to protect face (theirs or others), threaten others 2 ̆ 7 face, and to avoid or resolve conflicts. So far, studies about <b>facework</b> behaviors have focused on face-to-face interactions. Preliminary studies have shown: a. <b>facework</b> behaviors may affect the outcomes of online discussion teams, b. sex {{may play a role}} in the relationship between <b>facework</b> behaviors and online discussion outcomes, and c. conflicts among online discussion team members may influence discussion outcomes. This research explores more completely the role that <b>facework</b> behaviors play during conflicts, their influence on online discussion outcomes, and the role that sex plays in these matters. Data gathered from surveys and transcripts of participants 2 ̆ 7 online discussion postings show that <b>facework</b> behaviors: a. influence conflict levels, b. influence the outcomes of the online discussion teams, and c. play a moderating role on the relationship between conflicts and online discussion outcomes. They also indicate that sex plays a moderating role in these relationships. Moreover, this study shows that the typology of <b>facework</b> behaviors, originally developed to describe face-related aspects of face-to-face interactions, has value in understanding online discussions...|$|E
40|$|Western and Asian {{cultures}} conceptualize {{the notion}} of ‘face’ in significantly different ways. Though ‘face’ and ‘facework’ have been quite well researched both theoretically and empirically, few previous studies have specifically dealt with the conceptualisation of <b>facework</b> of intercultural interlocutors in their workplaces. Additionally, no previous study on <b>facework</b> has explored Vietnamese culture in Western-Asian intercultural interaction. Given the cultural differences possessed by Vietnamese international students and Australian international student advisors and the sensitive, exclusive situations in which they interact with each other, this paper attempts to examine their perceptions of face and <b>facework</b> through two cultural dimensions: individualism-collectivism and power distance. Vietnamese international students’ concern for face is found to govern their use of direct or indirect requests, what they disclose or not disclose in interaction and to explain their meticulous consideration. Australian student advisors also have similar concern but are not fully aware of Vietnamese students’ <b>facework</b> strategies...|$|E
