500|$|In April 1990 Mobutu {{announced}} he would accommodate multi-party politics. Lihau, {{who was at the}} time presiding over a meeting of exiled politicians in Brussels, demanded that before opposition elements return to the country Mobutu's government guarantee the tolerance of a genuine multi-party system, agree to organise a round table conference for political reconciliation, and begin disbanding state security forces. Lihau did eventually return to the Congo. Once there, he joined the UDPS in endorsing the formation of a [...] "Conference Nationale Souveraine" [...] to discuss political reform in the country. One soon convened, but Lihau protested the large number of delegates summoned by Mobotu to participate, accusing him of trying to stack the representation in his own favor. Throughout the conference's existence Lihau chaired its constitutional commission. At one point during the conference, Lihau denounced the perceived Baluba dominance of the UDPS and joined the Alliance des Bangala, a party with financial support from Mobutu that promoted politicians from Équateur. Eventually the constitutional commission produced a <b>draft</b> <b>recommendation</b> of a federal system that was intended to maintain the national integrity of the Congo while respecting its diversity. The conference disbanded in December 1992 having greatly reinvigorated democratic thought in the country but ultimately failing to enact significant institutional change. Lihau went back to the United States to receive medical treatment.|$|E
