The {{search for}} {{bioactive}} plants {{which can be}} used as non-conventional anthelmintics (AHs) has received considerable attention in recent times because of the increasing, worldwide development of resistance to chemical anthelmintics in worm populations. However, scientific evidence to validate the use of plants remains limited. The criteria required for the scientific validation of phytomedicine and nutraceuticals are similar to those expected for chemical anthelmintics: definition and quality, efficacy, identification of side-effects. However, the methods of investigation need to take into account i) the variability in bioactive compounds in the natural resources, ii) the mode of <b>distribution</b> <b>to</b> <b>animals</b> and iii) the potential anti nutritional and side-effects of some bioactive compounds and the possible occurrence of regulative mechanisms in the hosts. These points are critically discussed, in particular by reference to the example of tannin rich plants with anthelmintic properties from both temperate and tropical regions...|$|E

40|$|The light {{microscope}} is traditionally {{an instrument of}} substantial size and expense. Its miniaturized integration would enable many new applications based on mass-producible, tiny microscopes. Key prospective usages include brain imaging in behaving animals towards relating cellular dynamics <b>to</b> <b>animal</b> behavior. Here we introduce a miniature (1. 9 g) integrated fluorescence microscope made from mass-producible parts, including semiconductor light source and sensor. This device enables high-speed cellular-level imaging across ～ 0. 5 mm 2 areas in active mice. This capability allowed concurrent tracking of Ca 2 + spiking in> 200 Purkinje neurons across nine cerebellar microzones. During mouse locomotion, individual microzones exhibited large-scale, synchronized Ca 2 + spiking. This is a mesoscopic neural dynamic missed by prior techniques for studying the brain at other length scales. Overall, the integrated microscope is a potentially transformative technology that permits <b>distribution</b> <b>to</b> many <b>animals</b> and enables diverse usages, such as portable diagnostics or microscope arrays for large-scale screens...|$|R

40|$|In 2008, after 9 {{years of}} presumed local extinction, brush-tailed rock-wallabies (Petrogale penicillata) were reintroduced at Moora Moora Creek in the Grampians National Park, western Victoria. Since {{little is known}} about this species in Victoria, the {{reintroduction}} presented an important opportunity to gain information on the species’ ecology. Radio-tracking was undertaken and home range determined for three individuals released 11 months before this study and a further five individuals that were released at the commencement of the study in October 2009. Home-range size showed little variation amongst individuals, with a mean overall home range of 26 ha (± 1. 69, s. e.) and a mean core home range of 2. 5 ha (± 0. 24, s. e.). Newly reintroduced individuals showed higher levels of association with wallabies from the same release and greater site fidelity when known conspecifics were close. Within 5 months of release, newly reintroduced animals showed home ranges similar in both size and <b>distribution</b> <b>to</b> those of <b>animals</b> released 11 months prior.

5|$|Wallace, {{following}} {{on earlier}} work by de Candolle, Humboldt and Darwin, made major contributions to zoogeography. Because of {{his interest in}} the transmutation hypothesis, he paid particular attention <b>to</b> the geographical <b>distribution</b> of closely allied species during his field work first in South America and then in the Malay archipelago. While in the archipelago he identified the Wallace line, which runs through the Spice Islands dividing the fauna of the archipelago between an Asian zone and a New Guinea/Australian zone. His key question, as to why the fauna of islands with such similar climates should be so different, could only be answered by considering their origin. In 1876 he wrote The Geographical Distribution of Animals, which was the standard reference work for over half a century, and a sequel, Island Life, in 1880 that focused on island biogeography. He extended the six-zone system developed by Philip Sclater for describing the geographical <b>distribution</b> of birds <b>to</b> <b>animals</b> of all kinds. His method of tabulating data on animal groups in geographic zones highlighted the discontinuities; and his appreciation of evolution allowed him to propose rational explanations, which had not been done before.|$|R
40|$|Using a {{specific}} alpha-skeletal actin antibody, we have previously shown, that during hypertension-associated cardiac hypertrophy in the rat, {{the expression of}} alpha-skeletal actin in the myocardium is increased, but maintains focal <b>distribution,</b> compared <b>to</b> normotensive <b>animals.</b> In the present study, we have investigated whether alpha-skeletal actin expression can be induced {{in the absence of}} hypertension. For this purpose, we have examined transgenic mice overexpressing angiotensinogen exclusively in the heart. These animals are characterized by high cardiac angiotensin II levels and cardiac hypertrophy accompanied or not by high blood pressure depending on their genetic background, i. e. presence of one or two renin genes. Alpha-skeletal actin levels were highly increased in transgenic compared to wild-type myocardium independently of the number of renin genes, indicating that angiotensin II can stimulate alpha-skeletal actin expression in normotensive animals. Additional in vitro experiments using cultured mouse and rat cardiomyocytes showed that angiotension II not only increases alpha-skeletal actin expression but also induces an increase of its incorporation within II-bands compared to control cardiomyocytes. Angiotensin II increases also the expression of alpha-smooth muscle actin in sarcomeres of cardiomyocytes as well as in fibroblastic cells present within the culture...|$|R

40|$|Theiler's murine {{encephalomyelitis}} {{virus is}} a neurotropic enterovirus {{known to cause}} biphasic neural disease after intracerebral inoculation into adult mice. The present study characterizes a neonatal mouse model with a high disease incidence {{for the study of}} the acute phase of the pathogenesis of the DA strain of Theiler's murine encephalomyelitis virus after oral infection. The route of viral spread to and within the central nervous system (CNS) was determined by examining the kinetics of viral replication in various organs and by performing histopathological analysis. Viral antigen was detected widely in the neonatal CNS, mainly in the gray matter, and it was asymmetrical and multifocal in its distribution, with considerable variation in lesion <b>distribution</b> from <b>animal</b> <b>to</b> <b>animal.</b> Necrotizing lesions appeared to expand by direct extension from infected cells to their close neighbors, with a general disregard of neuroanatomical boundaries. The diencephalon showed particular susceptibility to viral infection. Other areas of the CNS, including the cerebellum and dentate gyrus of the hippocampus, were consistently spared. Neurons with axons extending peripherally to other organs or receiving direct input from the peripheral nervous system were not preferentially affected. The kinetics of viral replication in the liver, spleen, and CNS and the histopathological findings indicate that viral entry to the CNS is via a direct hematogenous route in orally infected neonatal mice and that the disease then progresses within the CNS mainly by direct extension from initial foci...|$|R

40|$|In Western research, cruelty <b>to</b> <b>animals</b> in {{childhood}} {{has been associated}} with comorbid conduct problems and with interpersonal violence in later life. However, there is little understanding of the etiology of cruelty <b>to</b> <b>animals,</b> and what in the child 2 ̆ 7 s life may require attention if the chain linking animal cruelty and later violence is to be broken. The study reported in this paper investigated the association between parent-reported cruelty <b>to</b> <b>animals,</b> and parent- and self-reported psychological strengths and weaknesses in a sample of 379 elementary school children in an Eastern context, Malaysia.
