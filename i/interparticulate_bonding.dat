40|$|In this thesis, factors {{important}} in tableting operations and for tablet properties {{have been studied}} and characterised by different spectroscopic techniques {{as well as by}} some more conventionally used particle characterisation techniques. The spectroscopic techniques solid-state NMR, FT-IR and NIR spectroscopy, proved to be valuable tools in the estimation of particle and tablet properties, offering both specificity and sensitivity in the measurements. Because of the large amount of information obtained in a spectrum, multivariate data analysis was in some cases used in the processing of the spectral data. Correlations between the solid state structure measured by spectroscopy and the particle and tablet properties could be obtained including useful prediction models. The surface area obtained using different principles has in this thesis been shown to reflect different properties and tableting behaviour of a collection of pharmaceutical materials. The particle shape and the external surface area of the powders measured by permeametry, were found to be important factors for the tensile strength of tablets made of hydroxypropyl methylcellulose. Furthermore, the external surface area could be used to access dominating <b>interparticulate</b> <b>bonding</b> mechanisms in compacts of different materials by normalising the tablet tensile strength for the tablet surface area. It was also shown that for materials prone to develop solid bridges, the actual surface area participating in the bonding was more important than the average interparticulate distance. When studying the properties of microcrystalline cellulose and cellulose powder from the alga Cladophora sp., the cellulose fibril surface area estimated by solid-state NMR resulted in better correlations to the tableting behaviour and to tablet disintegration than the external permeametric surface area did. It was suggested that the difference in fibril surface area of the two celluloses was the primary factor responsible for properties like the crystallinity and the disintegration of the tablets...|$|E
40|$|The effect, {{of varying}} the {{proportion}} of binder starch paste (SP) and the disintegrant sodium starch glycolate (SSG), on the compaction behavior of wet granulated acetaminophen (ACM) formulations using a fully instrumented rotary tablet press, was studied. Wet granulation formulations were prepared using ACM, SP as binder (equal to 2. 5 %, 5 % or 10 % starch concentration), SSG as disintegrant (0 %, 4 %, 8 %, or 12 % w/w), microcrystalline cellulose (MCC) and magnesium stearate (MS) (1. 5 % w/w). Upper and lower punch force displacement data during in-die compaction was captured using a fully instrumented rotary tablet press at 13. 8 rpm at 96 ± 8, 163 ± 13, 235 ± 12 MPa compaction pressures. Elastic energy [EE] and tablet tensile strength was determined {{as a function of}} starch and SSG concentration and compaction pressure. At a given compaction pressure, increasing {{the proportion of}} SSG resulted in higher values of elastic energy (0. 28 to 0. 76 Nm with increase in SSG from 0 % to 12 % at 5 % starch and 235 ± 12 MPa compaction pressures). The negative effect of SSG on the overall compressibility of granules was due to its high elastic energy anddecrease in <b>interparticulate</b> <b>bonding.</b> When examining the elastic energy at increasing SP levels, a decrease in elastic energy was evident (0. 60, 0. 50 and 0. 31 Nm for 2. 5 %, 5 % and 10 % starch at 4 % SSG and 235 ± 12 MPa compaction pressures respectively). At a given composition, an increase in compaction pressure led to an increase in elastic energy (0. 15, 0. 33 and 0. 50 Nm at 4 % SSG and 5 % starch for 96 ± 8, 163 ± 13, 235 ± 12 MPa compaction pressures, respectively). When changing SSG and binder (SP) concentration levels tensile strength was indirectly proportional to elastic energy during compaction. Negative influence of SSG on elastic energy indicated by increased EE and decreased tensile strength and positive influence of SP was evident onlower elastic energy and higher tensile strength of tablets...|$|E
40|$|This thesis {{presents}} an experimental study {{designed for the}} characterization of the tablettingbehaviors of Starch 1500 ?, Starcap 1500 ?, LHPC LH- 11 and LHPC LH-B 1, chosen for their displayof self-lubrication properties, {{in the form of}} efficient stress transmission, low ejection forcesand anti-capping propensities, with two specific aims:Firstly, the mechanisms underlying the tabletting performance of the materials were investigated. Secondly, in order to develop a robust experimental characterization method, the value ofthe experimental indicators used in this work was assessed. The time dependence of plastic flow was evidenced through a strain rate sensitivity study: thevariations of a set of experimental parameters with the compaction rate were observed. On theone hand, the axial (AER) and diametral (DER) tablet relaxations provided an indirect measureof the elastic deformation of the powder bed. On the other hand, the Heckel Yield Stress (?yH),Kawakita parameters a and b, and the maximum stress transmission coefficient (STCM), allowedan evaluation of the extent of plastic flow. Secondly, the initial (SRR 0), final (SRRF) and average (SRRAv) stress relaxation rates, as wellas the proportion of stress lost during relaxation (?PM) of the four powders were quantified fromstress relaxation experiments. Also, a new approach based on linear combinations of exponentialdecay functions, was proposed for the analysis of stress relaxation curves obtained for powderbeds. Finally, the maximum ejection force and profiles, used in conjunction with the unejected compactsurface roughness and the final tablet shape served to elucidate the different relaxation phenomenataking place during the unloading and ejection phases, as well as investigate die wallfriction. The mechanical strength of the final tablets allowed an estimation of the final particlecohesion achieved. The major finding of this work is that the tabletting behaviors of the powders result from thespecific balance between their degrees of plastic and elastic deformations. More precisely, plasticflow governs the compact consolidation through <b>interparticulate</b> <b>bonding,</b> but also the strengthof the adhesive junctions formed between the tablet and the die wall, responsible for friction. Axial elastic recovery of the tablet during unloading causes the weakening of interparticulatebonds through their stretching, but also the cleavage of the compact-die wall plastic junctionsand thus a reduction in the friction force between them. The fine-tuning of these two phenomenacould lead to the formation of a tablet of satisfactory mechanical strength with minimal die wallfriction.

40|$|Due {{to various}} {{advantages}} such as high-precision dosing, manufacturing efficiency and patient compliance helped making tablets {{the most popular}} dosage forms among all available dosages forms. Compaction, which is an essential manufacturing step {{in the manufacture of}} tablets, mainly includes compression (i. e. reduction of volume of the powder under consideration and particle rearrangement) and consolidation (i. e., formation of <b>interparticulate</b> <b>bond</b> to facilitate stable compaction). The success of the compaction process depends not only on the physico-technical properties of drugs and excipients, but also on the instrument settings with respect to rate and magnitude of force transfer. Tablet manufacturing speed and pre/main compression force profile also have an influence {{on the quality of the}} final tablet. Mechanical aspects of tablet formation can be studied using, instrumented punches/dies, instrumented tablet punching machines, and compaction simulators. These have potential application in pharmaceutical research and development, such as studying basic compaction mechanism, various process variables, scale-up parameters, trouble shooting problems, creating compaction data library, and fingerprinting of new active pharmaceutical ingredients (APIs) or excipients. Mathematical models, force-time, force-distance, and die-wall force parameters of tablet manufacturing are used to describe work of compaction, elasticity/plasticity, and time dependent deformation behavior of pharmaceuticals powder under consideration...|$|R
40|$|Microcrystalline {{cellulose}} (MCC) is {{the most}} frequently used excipient for direct compaction of tablets within the pharmaceutical industry. It has earlier been indicated that the interactions between the hydration shell – surrounding the drug molecules in an MCC tablet – and the cellulose regulate the speed of the drug release process. These interactions, and the charge transport governed by moisture, are therefore important to analyze and understand to be able to tailor make new functional drug delivery systems. In this thesis the physical parameters affecting the water-induced ionic transport have been studied with impedance spectroscopy, transient current measurements, nitrogen adsorption and scanning electron microscopy. Dielectric relaxation processes, pertaining to other processes, have also been assessed and analysed, and a generalized regular singular point model {{has been shown to be}} able to describe all features of the dielectric spectrum. It has been shown that the ionic charge transport mechanism in humid MCC most likely is governed by two parallel processes: One involving water constituent ions diffusing between adjacent lowest energy sites (free OH- groups) in disordered regions of the cellulose and the other caused by impurity ions, such as Na+, and protons or H 3 O+ ions, jumping between neighboring cellulose OH- groups to which primary water molecules are attached. At relative humidities of ~ 37 % (representing monolayer coverage) and higher, the latter process is totally dominating the charge transport. At a given moisture content, there are two parameters determining the magnitude of the water-induced ionic conductivity in MCC: The connectedness of the <b>interparticulate</b> <b>bonds</b> and the connectedness of pores with a diameter in the 5 - 20 nm size range. The presented findings emphasize the importance of analysing and being able to control the nanostructure of a pharmaceutical cellulose-based system in order to tailor the drug transport properties. The presented results should also be significant for other areas where cellulose-water interactions are of key issue; such as for paper and sanitary product research and for food industries using cellulose-based gels...|$|R
