5|$|Districts {{established}} under U.S. <b>federal</b> <b>guidelines</b> generally {{begin the}} process of designation through a nomination to the National Register of Historic Places. The National Register is the official recognition by the U.S. government of cultural resources worthy of preservation. While designation through the National Register does offer a district or property some protections, it is only in cases where the threatening action involves the federal government. If the federal government is not involved, then the listing on the National Register provides the site, property or district no protections. For example, if company A wants to tear down the hypothetical Smith House and company A is under contract with the state government of Illinois, then the federal designation would offer no protections. If, however, company A was under federal contract the Smith House would be protected. A federal designation is little more than recognition by the government that the resource is worthy of preservation.|$|E

5|$|Like {{other wines}} {{produced}} in the United States, Oregon wines are marketed as varietals. Oregon law requires that wines {{produced in the}} state must be identified by the grape variety from which it was made, and for most varietals it must contain at least 90% of that variety. The exceptions to the 90% law are the following varietals: Red and White Bordeaux varietals, Red and White Rhône varietals, Sangiovese, Tempranillo, Zinfandel and Tannat. For these wines, they follow the <b>Federal</b> <b>guidelines</b> of 75%. Oregon law has long forbidden use of place names, except as appellations of origin. Oregon is most famous for its Pinot noir, which is produced throughout the state. Pinot noirs from the Willamette Valley have received much critical acclaim from wine connoisseurs and critics, and Oregon is {{regarded as one of}} the premier Pinot-producing regions in the world.|$|E
5|$|On April 29, 2010, MDOT {{announced}} plans to transfer M-108 in its entirety to the Village of Mackinaw City and Emmet County. In preparation for this transfer, MDOT repaved, widened and reconstructed the roadway. While rebuilding {{the section of the}} highway between US23 and the northern terminus, the welcome center was closed. Plans had this section to be completed, and the center to be reopened, for Memorial Day weekend, with the remainder of construction to be completed in August. Following the transfer to local control, M-108 ceased to be a state highway and the designation was decommissioned. Previous news reports stated that the roadway was too small to merit highway status under <b>federal</b> <b>guidelines.</b> The transfer was completed on December 9, 2010, when MDOT and local officials signed memoranda of understanding to finalize the transfer. The section within the Village of Mackinaw City was transferred to the village, and the remainder to Emmet County.|$|E

Despite following EPA best-practice clean-up guidelines on broken CFLs, researchers were unable to remove mercury from carpet, and agitation of the carpet— such as by young children playing— created localized concentrations as high as 0.025mg/m3 in air close to the carpet, even weeks after the initial breakage.|$|E

On request, workers' representatives on completion of their training courses had to have an employment relationship of unlimited duration.
