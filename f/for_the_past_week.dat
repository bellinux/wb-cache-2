25|$|On 24 July, YPG-led forces {{advanced}} again, {{crossing the}} highway and capturing the village of Malhah, once again cutting off ISIL's last supply route to Sarrin. Heavy fighting continued around the urban areas of Sarrin. It was reported that the Euphrates Volcano (Burkan Al-Firat) forces had been pounding Sarrin with artillery <b>for</b> <b>the</b> <b>past</b> <b>week,</b> and that ISIL shot at civilians who tried to leave the town. On the next day, YPG and FSA forces advanced further southward, capturing the village of Milhah, located {{to the south of}} Malhah, further securing the siege of Sarrin. Later on the same day, in response to the YPG and FSA advances, ISIL attacked YPG fighters on the road between Magharatayn and Malhah, which ran into the southern part of Sarrin, before firing mortar bombs on the area after their initial attack failed.|$|E
2500|$|Paul sent a {{telegram}} from nearby Benson to Deputy U.S. Marshal Virgil Earp. When Virgil received it at 10:00pm, he deputized Wyatt and Morgan Earp, Bat Masterson, who was dealing faro at the Oriental Saloon, and Wells Fargo agent Marshall Williams. Pima County Sheriff Behan and Deputy Sheriff Billy Breakinridge joined in. They arrived at Drew's Station around dawn. Behan {{tried to talk}} them out of following the murders. The Earps were skilled trackers and Masterson could read sign like an Indian. Virgil insisted they pursue the killers and told Behan he could ride along or ride back to Tombstone. Behan indifferently agreed to stay, and they tracked three pairs of boots to a nearby hiding spot where the outlaws mounted their horses, accompanied by a fourth rider. Bob Paul thought he recognized the voices of Bill Leonard and Jim Crain. Wyatt had seen Cowboys {{who worked for the}} Clantons—Bill Leonard, Harry [...] "The Kid" [...] Head, Jim Crain and a drifter named Luther King—camped out in an old adobe along the stage route <b>for</b> <b>the</b> <b>past</b> <b>week,</b> and he suspected they were watching the stage for an opportunity to rob it.|$|E

60|$|Having settled {{this matter}} in his mind, {{and decided that}} no amount of {{thinking}} would enable him to see a way of escaping; Harry dismissed the subject from his thoughts, ate his rice, and lay down as soon as it became dark, having had but little rest <b>for</b> <b>the</b> <b>past</b> <b>week.</b>|$|E
60|$|The {{master of}} the {{merchantman}} assured him that from the position at which they had picked him up, and the prevailing winds <b>for</b> <b>the</b> <b>past</b> <b>week</b> {{he could have been}} on no other island than one of the Cape Verde group, which lie off the West Coast of Africa in about 16 degrees or 17 degrees north latitude.|$|E
60|$|Harry was {{not sorry}} to turn in. He had had but little sleep <b>for</b> <b>the</b> <b>past</b> <b>week.</b> Everything {{had seemed to}} be going well, but at any moment there might be some hitch in the arrangements, and he had been anxious and excited. Wrapping himself in his poncho he lay down in the stern of the boat and slept soundly until morning.|$|E

60|$|With {{the sheets}} hauled tight aft, the cutter was just able to lie her course, outside {{the line of}} breakers.

60|$|He did not halt at Fontainebleau, for now he {{knew that}} the Court of the Tuileries was in a panic, that neither the Comte d'Artois, nor the Duc de Berry, nor any of the royal princes had succeeded in keeping the army together: that defections had been rife <b>for</b> <b>the</b> <b>past</b> <b>week,</b> even before Napoleon had shown himself, and that Marshal Ney, the bravest soldier in France, had joined his Emperor at Auxerre.|$|E

60|$|Cynthia {{turned over}} the sheet, and read many {{interesting}} items: one concerning the beauty and fashion and intellect which attended the party at Mr. Gamaliel Ives's; in the Clovelly notes she saw that Miss Judy Hatch, of Coniston, was visiting relatives there; she learned {{the output of the}} Worthington Mills <b>for</b> <b>the</b> <b>past</b> <b>week.</b> Cynthia was about to fold up the paper and send it to Miss Lucretia, whom she thought it would amuse, when her eyes were arrested by the sight of a familiar name.|$|E

He took pen, ink, and paper, and made some elaborate calculations. Money that he had too generously lent, or too freely given away, appeared in his statement of expenses, as well as money that he had spent on himself. The result may be plainly stated in his own words: [...] "Goodbye to the hotel; I must go into lodgings." ...|$|E

60|$|Andrew caught Whitney's {{glance and}} {{understood}} it {{as a warning}} not to speak. It had been blowing hard <b>for</b> <b>the</b> <b>past</b> <b>week</b> and {{he thought of the}} great battleships rolling until it was scarcely possible to keep a footing on their stripped decks, while anxious men slept beside the guns and bitter seas foamed across the ponderous, low-sided hulls. It would be worse on the swift destroyers, driving, half submerged, through the gale and trembling when the combers struck them, until their thin steel skin and beams racked and bent with the strain. No man could really keep a lookout in the blinding clouds of spray, and their decks would be swept from end to end with icy water. Rankine knew this, but he smiled tranquilly as he turned to Staffer.|$|E
6000|$|My pipe was {{behaving}} like the ideal pipe; and, as I strolled spaciously about the lawn, my novel was growing nobly.

I am {{not one of those}} men whose minds work in placid independence of the conditions of life. But I was making up for lost time now. With each blue cloud that left my lips and hung in the still air above me, striking scenes and freshets of sparkling dialogue rushed through my brain. Another uninterrupted half hour, and I have no doubt that I should have completed the framework of a novel which would have placed me in that select band of authors who have no christian names. Another half hour, and posterity would have known me as [...] "Garnet." ...|$|E

You see, we are not allowed to ride beyond St. Ambrogio, or Rivoli at farthest, for once beyond that, we should be liable to be caught by the enemy's scouting parties. Of course we have a strong force at Rivoli, but except to drive off small parties of the enemy who may venture to come up too close, they are forbidden to engage in any affairs. It is annoying, but one can understand that the general is anxious to avoid encounters in which the enemy is sure to be superior in force, until his reinforcements come up and we are able to take the field in earnest." ...|$|E
