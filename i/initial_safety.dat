The Phase II portion of the trial sought to compare the efficacy of Abituzumab, cetuximab, and irinotecan compared to cetuximab and irinotecan in patients with KRAS (exon 2) wild-type metastatic colorectal cancer. Patients included in the study failed treatment with oxaliplatin, and <b>initial</b> <b>safety</b> studies included comparing Abituzumab, cetuximab, and irinotecan with standard of care.

40|$|Abstract—An {{approach}} for formally verifying {{the safety of}} automated vehicles is proposed. Due to the uniqueness of each traffic situation, we verify safety online, i. e., during {{the operation of the}} vehicle. The verification is performed by predicting the set of all possible occupancies of the automated vehicle and other traffic participants on the road. In order to capture all possible future scenarios, we apply reachability analysis to consider all possible behaviors of mathematical models considering uncertain inputs (e. g. sensor noise, disturbances) and partially unknown <b>initial</b> states. <b>Safety</b> is guaranteed with respect to the modeled uncertainties and behaviors if the occupancy of the automated vehicle does not intersect that of other traffic participants for all times.
