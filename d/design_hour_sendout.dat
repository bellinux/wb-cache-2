40|$|Guidelines {{for the use}} of right-turn lanes at {{access points}} on urban two-lane and four-lane {{sections}} of the state highway system in Nebraska were developed in this research. The guidelines are {{based on the results of}} a benefit-cost analysis conducted over the range of conditions representative of those on urban sections of the state highway system in Nebraska. The guidelines define the <b>design</b> <b>hour</b> traffic volumes for which the benefits of right-turn lanes exceed their costs. The benefits used in the analysis were operational and accident cost savings they provide to road users. The operational cost savings were those associated with reductions in stops, delay, and fuel consumption experienced by through traffic. These operational effects were determined by computer simulation. The accident cost savings were those associated with the reduction in accidents expected from the lower speed differences between right-turning and through traffic provided by right-turn lanes. The relationship between speed differential and accidents established by Solomon (14) was used to estimate the reduction in rearend accidents that would be expected to result from the provision of a right-turn lane. The right-turn lane costs used in the development of the guidelines were typical right-turn lane construction costs on urban sections of the state highway system in Nebraska. These costs were computed as a function of roadway speed and right-of-way cost. The right-of-way costs used included zero for construction within the existing right-of-way and values representative of low, medium, and high urban right-of-way costs in Nebraska. ^ The guidelines define the right-turn <b>design</b> <b>hour</b> volume required to justify a right-turn lane as a function of the following factors: (1) directional <b>design</b> <b>hour</b> volume, (2) roadway speed, (3) number of lanes on the roadway, and (4) right-of-way cost. The guidelines indicate that the right-turn <b>design</b> <b>hour</b> volume that warrants a right-turn lane is lower on roadways with higher directional <b>design</b> <b>hour</b> volumes and higher roadway speeds, because the road user costs associated with the operational and safety effects of right turns are greater on higher-volume, higher-speed roadways. Likewise, the right-turn <b>design</b> <b>hour</b> volume required to justify a right-turn lane on a two-lane roadway is lower than that on a four-lane roadway. Comparison with guidelines developed by others indicates that the guidelines developed in this research are within the range of existing guidelines. In addition, they are more definitive than the other guidelines because they account for the effects of roadway speed and right-of-way costs. ...|$|R

These buildings represent large, lumpy investments so it is important to provide the capacity to accommodate the forecast traffic. However, this depends on at least two factors; the accuracy of the forecast of future demand and the process of translating these forecasts into designs. Errors in either of these can be financially catastrophic.

This paper will look in detail at the process of translating demand forecasts into conceptual terminal designs.

The alternative design has separated oncoming lanes and a lane design that follows that of the existing road with an addition of two 1, 5 km long overtaking sections. The total length of the road is 15 km and no substantial traffic flows enter or exit the road along the studied stretch. All analyses were to be based on simulation results of the VTI rural traffic simulation model, RuTSim. AADT along the road has been estimated to 13 280 vehicles for the design horizon year 2025. Two hourly traffic flows for the simulation were constructed based on this estimate.

40|$|Shared-use paths are paved, {{off-road}} facilities {{designed for}} travel {{by a variety}} of nonmotorized users, including bicyclists, pedestrians, skaters, runners, and others. Shared-use path planners and designers face a serious challenge in determining how wide paths should be and whether the various modes of travel should be separated from each other. Currently, very little substantive guidance is available to aid in those decisions. This document describes how to use a new method to analyze the quality of service provided by shared-use paths of various widths that accommodate various travel mode splits. Given a count or an estimate of the overall path user volume in the <b>design</b> <b>hour,</b> the new method described here can provide the level of service (LOS) for path widths ranging from 2. 4 to 6. 1 meters (8. 0 to 20. 0 feet).

30|$|The {{literature}} clearly {{indicates that}} severe weather conditions trigger variations in highway traffic. However, past studies {{in this area}} are limited to total traffic. Understanding of truck traffic variations (or behavior) under severe weather conditions could provide useful information for transportation planning and engineering applications. An attempt has been made in this study to quantify the truck traffic variations under different weather conditions (mainly Snow and Cold). Vehicle classification data from the WIM site located on a highway site (LEDUC) in the province of Alberta, Canada, are used in this study. The WIM traffic data are grouped into three truck classes: single-unit trucks, single-trailer, and multi-trailer units. The association of truck type distribution with the winter months is examined by means of two statistical tests: χ 2 and BP distribution tests. Based on the combined and BP test results, it can be concluded that the truck type distribution is not associated with the winter months for the LEDUC site. These findings have practical implications for rationalization of the length and frequency of traffic counts including classified traffic monitoring programs throughout the year. For example, a short duration traffic count can be taken even during winter season to get reasonably good estimates of truck traffic on highways like studied in this research. The knowledge about independency of truck type distribution with various seasons is likely to help in effective traffic monitoring and estimation of the highway planning and design parameters like AADTT, ADTT, and <b>design</b> <b>hour</b> truck volume. Transportation authority can dispatch maintenance fleets based on regular schedule irrespective of the severity of winter weather conditions to the highway studied in this research.|$|R
40|$|Nowadays, many ASIP {{systems with}} high {{computational}} capabilities are designed {{in order to}} fulfill the increasing demands of technical applications. However, the design of ASIP system usually takes many man hours. Therefore, a number of EDA tools are developed to ease the design effort, but they limit the design freedom due to their predefined design templates. Consequently, designers are forced to use lower level HDLs which offer high design flexibility but require substantial <b>design</b> <b>hours.</b> A novel <b>design</b> automation tool called NoGap was proposed to balance such issues. The NoGap system, which is especially used in ASIPs and accelerator design, effectively provides high design flexibility and saves design effort for designers. The efficiency and design ability of NoGap were investigated in this thesis work. NoGap was used to implement an eight-way SIMD datapath of an ASIP called Sleipnir, which was devised by the Division of Computer Engineering at Linköping University. For contrast, the manually crafted HDL implementation of the Sleipnir was taken. The critical path implementations, done by both design approaches, were synthesized to the Altera Strtix IV FPGA. The synthesize results showed that the NoGap design although used 1. 358 times as many hardware units as the original HDL design. Their timing performance is comparable (HDL/NoGap- 60. 042 / 58. 156 Mhz). In this thesis, based on the design experience of SIMD datapath, valuable aspects were suggested to benefit the future users who will use NoGap to implement SIMD structures. In addition, the hidden bugs and insufficient features of NoGap were discovered, and the referable suggestions were provided in order to help the developers to improve the NoGap system...|$|R
