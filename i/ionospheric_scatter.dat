A statistical analysis of backscatter data spanning 20 years from 1996 to 2015 in the total field {{of view of the}} two HF radars was carried out {{in order to determine the}} solar cycle, the annual and the diurnal variations of backscatter (<b>ionospheric</b> <b>scatter</b> and ground scatter) in both Super Dual Auroral Radar Network (SuperDARN) radars over a longer time period.

Statistical theory, including information theory, is used throughout the paper. Gross aspects of multiple-mode propagation and <b>ionospheric</b> <b>scattering</b> are discussed, and previous efforts to improve systems affected by these disturbances are reviewed. System capacities are computed for the transmission of band-limited white Gaussian signals through fixed multiple-mode dis-turbances, and the optimum spectral distribution of transmitter power is found. In general, presence of additional paths does not upset the message-handling capabilities of the channel if suitable wide-band signals are used. Quasi-stationary path fluctuations are considered, and a technique for measurement of the multipath characteristic by the receiver is suggested. Capacities arefound for slow path delay fluctuations. Single-mode scatter propagation is considered as a complex multiplicative Gaussian process. The probability computing receiver is found analytically, and a physical realization is developed for small signal-to-noise ratios.

To {{establish the}} origin of the density irregularities responsible for low‒velocity SAIS, it is necessary to distinguish between the effects of high frequency (HF) propagation and irregularity occurrence itself on the observed backscatter distribution. We compare range, azimuth, and elevation data from the Blackstone SuperDARN radar with modeling results from ray tracing coupled with the International Reference Ionosphere assuming a uniform irregularity distribution. The observed and modeled distributions are shown to be very similar. The spatial distribution of backscattering is consistent with the requirement that HF rays propagate nearly perpendicular to the geomagnetic field lines (aspect angle ≤ 1 °). For the first time, the irregularities responsible for low‒velocity SAIS are determined to extend between 200 and 300 km altitude, validating previous assumptions that low‒velocity SAIS is an F‒region phenomenon. We find that the limited spatial extent of this category of ionospheric backscatter within SuperDARN radars' fields‒of‒view is a consequence of HF propagation effects and the finite vertical extent of the scattering irregularities.

Over large areas, these radars emit oblique HF signals and receive <b>ionospheric</b> <b>scatter</b> (IS) and ground/sea scatter (GS) echoes, which are backscattered from decameter-scale electron density irregularities in the E or F region ionosphere and from irregularities {{on the ground or}} sea surface, respectively. Gjerloev et al. (2007) first reported that sub-auroral Pi 2 pulsations detected by the Wallops radar were highly correlated with those in the magnetic field from a nearby ground station. Modeling of the event indicated that the predominantly shear Alfvén mode from an altitude of 1000  km provides amplitudes and phase relations that agree with the observations. By using data obtained by the Blackstone SuperDARN radar and nearby ground magnetometers, which were located in the pre-midnight sector of the sub-auroral region, Frissell et al. (2011) studied the fine spatial and temporal details of radar data at the ionospheric projection of the plasmapause and found evidence of field-line compressions. Comparing these Pi 2 pulsations and the earthward-moving busty bulk flows (BBFs) observed by the THEMIS E and D satellites, Frissell et al. (2011) concluded that these compressions provide support for a BBF-driven Pi 2 model, which is an alternative generation mechanism for mid- and low-latitude Pi 2 pulsations that was first proposed by Kepko and Kivelson (1999). In the BBF-driven Pi 2 model, quasiperiodical braking of earthward-flowing BBFs from the magnetotail produces compressional waves in the inner magnetosphere, which directly drive Pi 2 pulsations from high to low latitudes. These compression features can be detected only by radars that provide significantly better spatial resolution of the range gate cell along the line of sight.|$|E

Being ubiquitous in the collisionless terrestrial space plasma environment, ULF waves represent important physical processes in the transfer of energy and momentum. This thesis comprises three distinct studies to observe, model and analyse ULF phenomena. The first two studies focus on ULF wave observations at high-latitudes in the terrestrial ionosphere using a collection of both space- and ground-based instruments. The first study provides a detailed analysis of the time evolution of a ULF wave using the characteristics of the observed ULF wave as input-parameters to a 1 -D numerical model. As the wave signature evolves towards a Field Line Resonance (FLR) a change in the incident wave mode from a partially Alfvénic wave to a purely shear Alfvénic wave is observed. The second study presents statistics of 25 large spatial-scale ULF waves with observations from a high-latitude Doppler sounder and ground-based magnetometers, complemented by model results. The third and final study describes the implementation of a well established radar technique ("double-pulse"), which is new for the Super Dual Auroral Radar Network (SuperDARN), which aims to provide an unprecedented temporal resolution for ULF wave studies. The new pulse sequence increases the temporal resolution of SuperDARN by a factor of three. Preliminary findings suggest this technique yields impressive results for <b>ionospheric</b> <b>scatter</b> with steady phase values but that the method cannot be used for data when the phase is rapidly changing or if the data originates from slowly decorrelating plasma irregularities.

For the best comparison with radar observations, realistic ionospheric conditions are used. In the case study for the Halley HF radar in Antarctica, it is found that the radar's main propagation mode is one-hop propagation, and that the radar scatter is mostly organised in ranges in the order of E- region scatter, F- region scatter, and ground scatter.

AWFCs tend to overlap the equatorward {{edge of the}} auroral oval, and their life cycle is often synchronised to that of substorms: they commence close to substorm expansion phase onset, intensify during the expansion phase, and then decay during the recovery phase. Here we define {{for the first time}} the relationship between an AWFC, large-scale field-aligned current (FAC), the ring current, and plasmapause location. The Tasman International Geospace Environment Radar (TIGER), a Southern Hemisphere HF SuperDARN radar, observed a jet-like AWFC during ~ 08 : 35 to 13 : 28 UT on 7 April 2001. The initiation of the AWFC was preceded by a band of equatorward expanding <b>ionospheric</b> <b>scatter</b> (BEES) which conveyed an intense poleward electric field through the inner plasma sheet. Unlike previous AWFCs, this event was not associated with a distinct substorm surge; rather it occurred during an interval of persistent, moderate magnetic activity characterised by AL~- 200 nT. The four Cluster spacecraft had perigees within the dusk sector plasmasphere, and their trajectories were magnetically conjugate to the radar observations. The Waves of High frequency and Sounder for Probing Electron density by Relaxation (WHISPER) instruments on board Cluster were used to identify the plasmapause location. The Imager for Magnetopause-to-Aurora Global Exploration (IMAGE) EUV experiment also provided global-scale observations of the plasmapause. The Cluster fluxgate magnetometers (FGM) provided successive measurements specifying the relative location of the ring current and filamentary plasma sheet current. An analysis of Iridium spacecraft magnetometer measurements provided estimates of large-scale ionospheric FAC in relation to the AWFC evolution.

The expected performance {{is the same as the}} German FGAN radar performance. For parameter estimation we apply Bayesian statistical inversion. We start from a four-parameter model (amplitude, target range, ve...|$|R

Previous work suggested the feasibility of a system using a 50 watt transmitter and a phaselock receiver with a lock range of 300 cps and signal bandwidths between 5 and 100 cps. To substantiate former work in which recommendations were based on test results using an unmodulated carrier, a similar system was designed with provisions for frequency modulation. Dictated by the frequency stability of the entire system, the lock range was increased to 775 cps. Much of this thesis is devoted to the design and analysis of the phaselock detector and to the testing of the receiving system. Some pertinent properties of the receiver have been theoretically predicted and tested under simulated field operating conditions. In order to test the system under actual field conditions the 50 watt transmitter and the phaselock receiver were placed at Uranium City and Saskatoon, Saskatchewan, respectively. It was observed that sufficient signal to lock the system could e received for {{only a small portion of}} the total propagation time. This fact tentatively has been attributed to the effect which Doppler frequency shifts may have on a phaselock system with a relatively large lock range. The geometry of propagation and atmospheric conditions were not as favourable as during previous experiments. Recommendation have been made regarding improvements of the present receiver design and regarding the analysis of other, possibly superior, receiving systems...|$|R
