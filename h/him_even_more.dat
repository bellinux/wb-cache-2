5|$|Although the {{resolution}} {{was not as}} strong as Mason had liked—he wanted Virginia to threaten to cut off tobacco—Mason worked in the following years for non-importation. The repeal of most of the Townshend duties (excepting that on tea) made his task more difficult. In March 1773, his wife Ann died of illness contracted after another pregnancy. Mason was the sole parent to nine children, and his commitments made <b>him</b> <b>even</b> <b>more</b> reluctant to accept political office that would take him from Gunston Hall.|$|E

Later that winter, Scott was injured when he slipped on the icy steps of the governor's mansion; the injury left him confined to crutches {{for the rest of}} his life and rendered <b>him</b> <b>even</b> <b>more</b> dependent on Bledsoe to perform many of his official functions. His physical condition continued to worsen throughout his term {{as governor}}.|$|E

25|$|Gu Li was {{initially}} a servant under Sun Quan. Sun Quan liked {{him for his}} attentive and forthright personality and promoted him {{to the position of}} a Close Attendant (親近監).

25|$|The high {{standards}} he endorsed earned <b>him</b> <b>even</b> <b>more</b> popularity, {{as well as}} a salary worth twice that of local staff. Nevertheless, his contract was terminated in 1833 or 1834. The reason for this is unclear: some sources have attributed it to Vaillant's advocacy of nationalist tenets in front of his students, which reportedly rose suspicions from Russia, who was overseeing administration of the country under the Regulamentul Organic regime; others still indicate that he was involved in a conflict with Inspector Petrache Poenaru (in turn, this clash was attributed to Valliant's activities as Freemason or to him having continued to teach privately, thus competing with his state employers).|$|E
25|$|Rosa's {{eyesight}} {{had been}} very poor since his childhood. In 2006 and 2007 he began having new difficulties, which made drawing a very slow and tedious process for <b>him,</b> <b>even</b> <b>more</b> so than normally. In March 2008, Rosa suffered a severe retinal detachment and underwent emergency eye surgery {{that proved to be}} only partially successful. Further surgery in both eyes made drawing even more difficult. On June 2, 2008, during an interview at the Danish Komiks.dk fair, Rosa stated that he would not do any more Disney comics, citing eye troubles, low pay, and the constant use of his stories in special hardback or album editions by international Disney licensees without any payment of royalties or requests for permission for the use of his name.|$|E
50|$|Marty often acts as 'the good guy' when Rick {{sets off}} on his usual {{activity}} of insulting people.

Even though still married to JR, Babe starts to have romantic {{feelings}} for Josh and feels {{the need to}} be there for him when Dr. Greg Madden (the man he believes to be his father) goes missing. Babe supports Josh, talks him down, and tries to be there for him as a friend. When it is found that Greg Madden has died due to being buried alive underground for weeks, Babe sticks by Josh and seeks to help him through this. This enrages JR, causing more problems for their marriage. Due to the lack of communication, JR's murder attempt on her, their increased fighting, the Greg Madden murder mystery looming over their heads, and the search for Kate (JR's long-lost sister), JR and Babe begin shutting down on one another. This leads Babe to turn to Josh, confiding in <b>him</b> <b>even</b> <b>more</b> and spending more time with him.|$|E
25|$|Gung Ye first {{joined the}} troops of Gi Hwon in 891 but left shortly after as Gi Hwon {{did not fully}} trust him. Gung Ye joined Yang Gil's {{rebellion}} force in 892, and became leading general of the rebel forces by defeating the local Silla army and other rebel groups. Most local aristocrats of Myeongju and Paeseo, including Wang Gun, submitted to his force, making <b>him</b> <b>even</b> <b>more</b> powerful than his master Yang Gil. Silla, after nearly a millennium as a centralized kingdom was quickly declining, and Gung Ye instigated his own rebellion in present-day Kaesŏng in 898. After turning against his master, Yang Gil, He eventually defeated and subjugated him and other local lords in central Korea to proclaim himself king of Hugoguryeo in 901.With his rival Gyeon Hwon's Hubaekje {{taking control of the}} peninsula's southwest, he opened up the Later Three Kingdoms period of Korean History, a reference to the so-called Three Kingdoms period of Korea, several centuries earlier.|$|E

500|$|In 1750, Linnaeus became rector of Uppsala University, {{starting}} {{a period where}} natural sciences were esteemed. Perhaps the most important contribution he made during his time at Uppsala was to teach; many of his students travelled to various {{places in the world}} to collect botanical samples. Linnaeus called the best of these students his [...] "apostles". His lectures were normally very popular and were often held in the Botanical Garden. He tried to teach the students to think for themselves and not trust anybody, not even <b>him.</b> <b>Even</b> <b>more</b> popular than the lectures were the botanical excursions made every Saturday during summer, where Linnaeus and his students explored the flora and fauna in the vicinity of Uppsala.|$|E
500|$|Napoleon {{maintained}} strict, efficient work habits, prioritizing {{what needed}} to be done. He cheated at cards, but repaid the losses; he had to win at everything he attempted. He kept relays of staff and secretaries at work. Unlike many generals, Napoleon did not examine history to ask what Hannibal or Alexander or anyone else did in a similar situation. Critics said he won many battles simply because of luck; Napoleon responded, [...] "Give me lucky generals", aware that [...] "luck" [...] comes to leaders who recognize opportunity, and seize it. Dwyer states that Napoleon's victories at Austerlitz and Jena in 1805–06 heightened his sense of self-grandiosity, leaving <b>him</b> <b>even</b> <b>more</b> certain of his destiny and invincibility.|$|E
500|$|In 1808, Champollion {{received}} a scare when French Archeologist Alexandre Lenoir published {{the first of}} his four volumes on Nouvelles Explications des Hieroglyphes. making the young scholar fear that his budding work had already been surpassed. But he was relieved to find that Lenoir still operated under the assumption that the hieroglyphs were mystic symbols and not a literary system expressing language. This experience made <b>him</b> <b>even</b> <b>more</b> determined {{to be the first to}} decipher the language and he began dedicating himself even more to the study of Coptic, writing in 1809 to his brother: [...] "I give myself up entirely to Coptic... I wish to know Egyptian like my French, because on that language will be based my great work on the Egyptian papyri." [...] That same year, he was appointed to his first academic post, in history and politics at the University of Grenoble.|$|E

500|$|Glicken's {{father said}} in 1991 {{that his son}} died {{pursuing}} his passion, {{and that he was}} [...] "totally absorbed" [...] with volcanology. United States Geological Survey co-worker Don Peterson adds that Glicken was keen in his enthusiastic approach to observation, and praises his accomplishments throughout his career and as a graduate student. Speaking about Glicken's personal passion for his field, his mentor and professor Richard V. Fisher writes, [...] "What happened at St. Helens is something that troubled [...] deeply for a very long time, and, in a way, I think it made <b>him</b> <b>even</b> <b>more</b> dedicated than he was before." [...] Associate Robin Holcomb remarks that [...] "Harry was very enthusiastic, very bright, and very ambitious, ambitious to do something worthwhile on volcanoes." [...] Many studies have utilized Glicken's criteria for volcanic landslide recognition, and many subsequent papers on avalanches have acknowledged or referenced Glicken's 1996 report. Reflecting on Glicken's body of work, USGS employee Don Swanson names him as [...] "a world leader in studies of volcanic debris avalanches".|$|E
500|$|Terlecki openly {{participated in}} students' strikes {{at his old}} {{university}} in Łódź and across Poland {{over the next few}} months, providing food to the students by the car-load. ŁKS cancelled his registration in early 1981. Majchrzak stresses that Terlecki was the only player involved in the incident not to regain his place in the Poland team, and claims that this was down to an intense grudge held against him by the Ministry of Internal Affairs and Secret Police (SB). Terlecki developed his own theory that the media circus following the airport incident had been deliberately engineered by the SB to head the players off forming their own trade union. There were several other incidents of drunkenness involving Młynarczyk, Majchrzak writes, but this was the only occasion when any player was punished for it. In October 1981, when the team travelled to Argentina, Młynarczyk arrived at Okęcie [...] "completely drunk", according to Iwan, but far from reprimanding him, team staff gave <b>him</b> <b>even</b> <b>more</b> alcohol during the flight to help ease the pain of his broken finger.|$|E

The official website also states that they portrayed the character in his early stages as a [...] "modern day Robin Hood", as he would commit petty crimes and gain finances to help his mother run her household.
