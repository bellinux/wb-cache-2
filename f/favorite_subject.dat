5|$|Bauer's <b>favorite</b> <b>subject</b> was Swedish nature, {{the dense}} forests {{where the light}} trickled down through the tree canopies. Ever since he was little he had wandered in the dark woods of Småland imagining all the creatures living there. His {{paintings}} frequently included detailed depictions of plants, mosses, lichens and mushrooms found in the Swedish woods. He {{is best known for}} his illustrations of Among Gnomes and Trolls.|$|E
5|$|Murasaki {{became a}} popular subject of {{paintings}} and illustrations highlighting {{her as a}} virtuous woman and poet. She is often shown at her desk in Ishimyama Temple, staring at the moon for inspiration. Tosa Mitsuoki made her the subject of hanging scrolls in the 17th century. The Tale of Genji became a <b>favorite</b> <b>subject</b> of Japanese ukiyo-e artists for centuries with artists such as Hiroshige, Kiyonaga, and Utamaro illustrating various editions of the novel. While early Genji art was considered symbolic of court culture, {{by the middle of}} the Edo period the mass-produced ukiyo-e prints made the illustrations accessible for the samurai classes and commoners.|$|E
5|$|From {{the start}} of his notoriety, McCarthy served as a <b>favorite</b> <b>subject</b> for {{political}} cartoonists. He was traditionally depicted in a negative light, normally pertaining to McCarthyism and his accusations. Herblock's cartoon that coined the term McCarthyism appeared less than two months after the senator's now famous February 1950 speech in Wheeling, West Virginia. In 1953, the popular daily comic strip Pogo introduced the character Simple J. Malarkey, a pugnacious and conniving wildcat with an unmistakable physical resemblance to McCarthy. After a worried Rhode Island newspaper editor protested to the syndicate that provided the strip, creator Walt Kelly began depicting the Malarkey character with a bag over his head, concealing his features. The explanation was that Malarkey was hiding from a Rhode Island Red hen, a clear reference to the controversy over the Malarkey character.|$|E

500|$|An {{influential}} {{image was}} created by John William Waterhouse, from 1895 to 1905, entitled A Mermaid. An example of late British Academy style artwork, the piece debuted to considerable acclaim (and secured Waterhouse's place {{as a member of}} the Royal Academy), but disappeared into a private collection and did not resurface until the 1970s.

500|$|Critical {{reaction}} to the album's lyrical content was mixed. Thom Jurek of Allmusic felt the [...] "dark, unrelentingly twisted-as-fuck lyrics reflect a singular intensity," [...] and praised the band for connecting their anti-religion stance with a belief that religion has underscored many wars throughout history. However, Rolling Stones Chris Steffen mourned that it had become [...] "downright painful to hear Tom Araya — at 45 years old! — continue to belt out the band's increasingly self-parodying, anti-religious lyrics," [...] and singled out lyrics such as [...] "Religion's a whore" [...] and [...] "I've made my choice: six six six!" [...] as over the top. Jamie Thomson of The Guardian wrote that the album left [...] "no blasphemy... unuttered", while Peter Atkinson of KNAC.com observed that [...] "when not fixating on religion, the band revisit their other <b>favorite</b> <b>subject</b> — war — in surprisingly familiar terms," [...] and remarked that Slayer had sunk [...] "to the level of God-repelling dunderheads Deicide."

500|$|The {{authenticity}} of Dunne's use of dialect was controversial {{even in his}} own lifetime. [...] Dunne's partisans claimed that it was genuine Roscommon dialect, phonetically transcribed. But Dunne never called it such, making it clear in the columns that Mr. Dooley had been in America for many years, and so his dialect would have been modified by decades of exposure to an Archey Road wherein was known every way of speaking heard from Armagh to Bantry Bay, and more besides. Dunne was not always consistent in his usages, and spells Dooley's <b>favorite</b> <b>subject,</b> [...] "polytics", [...] "polliticks", [...] "pollytics" [...] and correctly. According to Ellis, while Dunne was no philologist, {{he had a good}} ear, and the biographer considered the Dooley pieces the outstanding use of Irish-American dialect in written form. Paul Green, though, in his introduction to the 1988 edition of Mr. Dooley in Peace and in War, averred that scholars in Ireland have stated that Dunne did not capture the dialect, and have written that the Dooley pieces were not popular there. According to Dunne's son Philip, except in a few of the early pieces, Dooley [...] "spoke always as an American, dealing with American and world issues. Eliminate the brogue and the pieces stand out as what they were: pure Americana." ...|$|E
