The Canadian and American teams outscored opponents in the preliminary round by 41–2 and 31–1 margins, respectively. This brought on more criticism about uneven competition. IOC president Jacques Rogge said, [...] "There is a discrepancy there, everyone agrees with that. This is maybe the <b>investment</b> <b>period</b> in women's ice hockey. I would personally give them more time to grow {{but there must be}} a period of improvement. We cannot continue without improvement." [...] Swedish team coach Peter Elander said it is hard for other nations to compete {{because of a lack of}} funding and a smaller pool of players to choose from. He said, [...] "The finances for all teams have to be the same. ... If you want to have a close tournament in Sochi (for the 2014 Olympics), have (comparable) national programs in all countries." [...] Some critics suggested that a mercy rule be implemented to prevent such lopsided scores. René Fasel said the IIHF would consider adding one. Chinese team coach Hannu Saintula, whose team was defeated 12–1 by the Americans, and American coach Mark Johnson, did not favor the idea.|$|E

40|$|In a two-period general {{equilibrium}} model, I {{study the}} effects of intertemporal emission permit trading in a cap-and-trade scheme when firms' investments in abatement have long-term effects. To meet their caps, firms optimally choose levels of trading and <b>investment</b> in each <b>period</b> by equalizing the marginal benefit of abatement to the marginal cost of abatement in each period. The fact that investments have long-term effects introduces new effects: <b>investments</b> in <b>period</b> 1 have both an additional benefit (the reduction of emissions in period 2) and an additional cost (the decrease in abatement opportunities in period 2). This changes the standard condition of equalization of marginal costs across periods for cost-effectiveness. Without intertemporal trading, some <b>investments</b> in <b>period</b> 1 are entirely driven by second-period abatement needs. In that case, allowing intertemporal trading may reduce <b>investment</b> in <b>period</b> 1 as some long-term investments are substituted by intertemporal permit trading.

5000|$|SWITCH is a {{power system}} model, focused on {{renewables}} integration. It can identify which generator and transmission projects to build {{in order to satisfy}} electricity demand at the lowest cost over a several year period while also reducing [...] emissions. SWITCH utilizes multi-stage stochastic linear optimization with the objective of minimizing the present value of the cost of power plants, transmission capacity, fuel usage, and an arbitrary per-tonne [...] charge (to represent either a carbon tax or a certificate price), {{over the course of a}} multi-year <b>investment</b> <b>period.</b> It has two major sets of decision variables. First, at the start of each <b>investment</b> <b>period,</b> SWITCH selects how much generation capacity to build in each of several geographic load zones, how much power transfer capability to add between these zones, and whether to operate existing generation capacity during the <b>investment</b> <b>period</b> or to temporarily mothball it to avoid fixed operation and maintenance costs. Second, for a set of sample days within each <b>investment</b> <b>period,</b> SWITCH makes hourly decisions about how much power to generate from each dispatchable power plant, store at each pumped hydro facility, or transfer along each transmission interconnector. The system must also ensure enough generation and transmission capacity to provide a planning reserve margin of 15% above the load forecasts. For each sampled hour, SWITCH uses electricity demand and renewable power production based on actual measurements, so that the weather-driven correlations between these elements remain intact.|$|E

40|$|Purpose – The {{purpose of}} this paper is to discuss a {{multiscale}} pricing model for the French stock market by combining wavelet analysis and Fama-French three-factor model. The objective is to examine the relationship between stock returns and Fama-French risk factors at different time-scales. Design/methodology/approach – Exploiting the scale separation property inherent to the maximal overlap discrete wavelet transform, the data set are decomposed into components associated with different time-scales. This wavelet-based decomposition scheme allows the three Fama-French models to be tested over different <b>investments</b> <b>periods.</b> Findings – The obtained results show that the explanatory power of the Fama-French three-factor model becomes stronger as the wavelet scale increases. Besides, the relationship between the portfolio returns and the risk factors (i. e. the market, size and value factors) depends significantly upon the considered time-horizon. Practical implications – The proposed methodology offers investors the opportunity to construct dynamic portfolio management strategies by taking into account the multiscale nature of risk and return. Moreover, it gives a new insight to fund rating and fund selection issues in relation to heterogeneous <b>investments</b> <b>periods.</b> Originality/value – The paper uses wavelets as a relatively new and powerful tool for statistical analysis that allows a new understanding of pricing models. The paper will be of interest not only for academics in the field of asset pricing but also for fund managers and financial market investors.

In October 2015, liquidation proceedings began against Kela. During the proceedings, more than 300 million NIS of unfulfilled debt, mostly from investors, were set before the court. In addition, the court appointed liquidator produced a report claiming that funds in the Kela fund were not actually used for [...] "Capital completion", but rather funneled into Rubicon Business Group, and that in addition that funds were moved from Rubicon to Bramly and his family, due to which a court order prohibiting disposition of assets was placed on Bramly and members of his family. As a result, the Kela fund, Rubicon Business Group, and a number of held companies were placed in permanent liquidation by the Tel-Aviv district court in January 2016 after the court determined that funds were inter-meshed between the companies, and that debts, mainly to investors, exceeded assets.|$|E
