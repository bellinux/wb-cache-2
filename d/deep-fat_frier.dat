Then, potato strips were cut into 1. 2 × 1. 2 × 4 cm 3 pieces and fried at 150, 170 and 190 ˚C for 90, 180, 270 and 360 seconds. The results showed that by increasing process temperature from 150 to 190 ˚C, shrinkage of fried potato strips is increased. Moreover, increasing process time during <b>deep-fat</b> <b>frying</b> led to increasing of this parameter. Also, by increasing process temperature and time, shrinkage was increased. In additioin, sodium chloride and β-cyclodextrin treatments in both concentrations, separately and simultaneously, decreased the shrinkage, compared to the control samples, from 0. 314 to 0. 278 (11. 46 %) on average. Due to the lack of suitable experimental models in the literature for shrinkage modeling during <b>deep-fat</b> <b>frying,</b> a number of experimental models were proposed to model the parameter.

The total fish lipid fraction was injected into the HPLC system coupled on line with a second order mass spectrometer (MS-MS) by means of electronebulization interface (ESI), without a prior clean-up of the phospholipid fraction. The <b>deep-fat</b> <b>frying</b> process caused significant changes on PE and PC molecular species composition of the fish fillet. In all cases, the <b>deep-fat</b> <b>frying</b> process caused a significant (.

At the same time, a depletion of the percentage of the PE and PC species formed by two docosahexaenoic acid residues in fried fillets was registered. Anyway, this depletion was statistically significant for PC, but not for PE. Both PE and PC compositions were not influenced by the frying temperature, whereas the nature of the culinary fat had an effect on the PC composition.

40|$|Introduction: Fast and {{convenience}} foods are abundant, relatively inexpensive, and accommodating to the fast-paced lifestyle of many Americans. One popular method of cooking {{used by many}} fast food establishments is <b>deep-fat</b> <b>frying.</b> Soybean oil is commonly used for frying and is rich in polyunsaturated fatty acids (PUFA) such as linoleic acid (LA). When soybean oil is used for <b>deep-fat</b> <b>frying,</b> LA becomes oxidized (Ox-LA). Endogenous Ox-LA {{has the capacity to}} be a ligand to peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor gamma (PPAR¥ã), a nuclear transcription factor that regulates adipocyte maturation. It is not yet known whether or not dietary Ox-LA has the same capacity with respect to PPAR¥ã. Considering the fact that dietary oxidized lipids are abundant in the typical American diet, {{it is important to know}} if they regulate weight gain and especially adipose tissue mass. In this study, we investigate the effects of fresh and heated soybean oil on weight gain and adiposity in mice fed isocaloric low fat diets. Methods: Soybean oil was heated on a hot plate, under a hood, at 190 ¨¬C for three hours. Fresh soybean oil served as the source of unoxidized oil (Unox-oil) and the heated oil served as the source of oxidized oil (Ox-oil).

40|$|Several {{studies have}} {{highlighted}} {{the importance of}} the cooling period in oil absorption in <b>deep-fat</b> <b>fried</b> products. Specifically, it has been established that the largest proportion of oil which ends up into the food, is sucked into the porous crust region after the fried product is removed from the oil bath, stressing the importance of this time interval. The main objective of this paper was to develop a predictive mechanistic model {{that can be used to}} understand the principles behind post-frying cooling oil absorption kinetics, which can also help identifying the key parameters that affect the final oil intake by the fried product. The model was developed for two different geometries, an infinite slab and an infinite cylinder, and was divided into two main sub-models, one describing the immersion frying period itself and the other describing the post-frying cooling period. The immersion frying period was described by a transient moving-front model that considered the movement of the crust/core interface, whereas post-frying cooling oil absorption was considered to be a pressure driven flow mediated by capillary forces. A key element in the model was the hypothesis that oil suction would only begin once a positive pressure driving force had developed. The mechanistic model was based on measurable physical and thermal properties, and process parameters with no need of empirical data fitting, and can be used to study oil absorption in any <b>deep-fat</b> <b>fried</b> product that satisfies the assumptions made...|$|R

At {{the end of the}} first frying process (10 min at 180 degreesC), the {{concentration of}} the dihydroxyphenol components was reduced to 50 - 60 % of the original value, and after six frying operations only about 10 % of the initial components remained. However, tyrosol (p-HPEA) and its derivatives (p-HPEA-EDA and p-HPEA-EA) in the oil were much more stable during 12 frying operations. The reduction in their original concentration was much smaller than that for hydroxytyrosol and its derivatives and showed a roughly linear relationship with the number of frying operations. The antioxidant activity of the phenolic extract measured using the DPPH test rapidly diminished during the first six frying processes, from a total antioxidant activity higher than 740,mumol of Trolox/kg down to less than 250 mumol/kg. On the other hand, the concentration of polar compounds, oxidized triacylglycerol monomers (oxTGs), dimeric TGs, and polymerized TGs rapidly increased from the sixth frying operation onward, when the antioxidant activity of the phenolic extract was very low, and as a consequence the oil was much more susceptible to oxidation.

40|$|Two {{important}} {{classes of}} minor constituents of {{oils and fats}} are tocopherols and sterols. Both these classes are biologically active and they also affect the stability and performance of an oil at elevated temperatures. Tocopherols are phenolic antioxidants that react with free radicals and their concentration is reduced signifantly when the oil is heated. α-TocopheroI is lost faster during <b>deep-fat</b> <b>frying</b> than the beta, gamma and delta homologues. In the presence of stronger antioxidants, natural or synthetic, losses of α-tocopherol can be eliminated. Unchanged phytosterols naturally present in vegetable oils {{are believed to be}} beneficial for the health. Depending on the chemical structure, phytosterols may act as prooxidants or antioxidants. Sterols with an ethylidene group in the side chain have been found effective in retarding polymerisation at temperatures similar to those of <b>deep-fat</b> <b>frying.</b> Under unfavourable conditions (high temperature, presence of air) oxidation products are formed from sterols and a marked increase in the oxidation rate of the fat is observed. Oxidation products of the main phytosterols, β-sitosterol and stigmasterol, are: hydrocarbons (3, 5 -diene and 3, 5, 22 -triene), mono-, di- and triunsaturated ketosteroids (4 -en- 3 -one, 3, 5 -dien- 7 -one, 3, 5, 22 -trien- 7 -one), 5, 6 -epoxy derivatives, 3, 7 -diols and pregnane derivatives.

40|$|<b>Deep-fat</b> <b>fried</b> foods, such as potato chips, are {{prevalent}} in modern consumption habits. Low-pressure <b>deep-fat</b> <b>frying</b> {{has become increasingly}} popular in today’s food products industry, and is used extensively {{by some of the}} largest potato chip manufacturers. Notably, an alternative technology has emerged: frying in a vacuum. The alternative approach allows frying to occur at much lower temperatures than regular atmospheric temperatures. Further, as shown in this paper, the alternative process [...] in application to the potato chip industry [...] reduces the amount of the carcinogen acrylamide formed process as compared to current practices, a noteworthy advantage. To conduct the comparative analysis, a theoretical model was formulated and implemented using commercial software in order to further refine our understanding of the principles supporting low-pressure (vacuum) frying. The model can assist our understanding by presenting analyses that can be instrumental in determining the optimal operating parameters, such as oil temperature and pressure. As a starting point, an existing model of atmospheric potato chip frying was utilized and subsequently modified and improved upon to reflect more appropriate and accurate behavior under vacuum frying. The modeling results for moisture content, acrylamide content, and additional measures are then compared to existing measures from previous experiments for potato chip frying in a vacuum. The analysis shows that acrylamide formation is significantly reduced by vacuum frying at the lower temperature. The analysis performed also indicates that the moisture content profiles for the new process cook more quickly under the vacuum process as compared to the atmospheric process. In addition, the idea of frying potato chips in vacuum as a potential food source for astronauts is explored. Astronauts have indicated they become tired of packaged foods on long space flights, but still require a constant stream of nutrition and energy sources; thus, the use of vacuum frying technology may be of interest to international space programs.

A {{limit of detection}} of 0. 04 mg kg(- 1), a limit of quantitation of 0. 08 mg kg(- 1), mean recoveries varying from 82 % to 92 %, and coefficients of variation ranging from 2. 5 % to 5. 0 % for repeatability and from 3. 6 % to 6. 5 % for within-laboratory reproducibility were obtained during in-house validation. The levels of the compounds in the evaluated samples, expressed as free 3 -MCPD equivalent, ranged from not detected to 0. 99 mg kg(-) (1), and the highest concentrations were observed in samples of chopped onion and garlic. A preliminary estimation of 3 -MCPD intake using these occurrence data suggested low risks to human health, but a potential concern may arise in particular cases of consumers of fried food...|$|R
40|$|Chicken {{breasts were}} coated using {{breading}} of different particle size. Breading particle size {{was divided into}} small (particle size U. S. No. 20 sieve mesh size). Chicken breasts were battered, breaded and <b>deep-fat</b> <b>fried</b> for 240 sec. at an initial temperature of 160 oC. The fried products were analysed for coating adhesion, moisture content and yield parameters. Yield parameters measured were coating pickup, cooking loss and cooked yield. Coating adhesion {{was found to be}} highest in coating formed from the small particle size breading. Coating formed from the large particle size breading had the lowest coating adhesion. Chicken breasts coated using the small particle size breading showed significantly higher moisture content in the surface region of the chicken meat {{as well as in the}} coating. Microstructure of the coatings showed a higher degree of merging between the breading and the batter with decreasing breading particle size. No significant differences were observed in coating pickup, cooking loss and cooked yield between samples coated with different particle size breading...|$|R
