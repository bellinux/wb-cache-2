30|$|NESTLON has a {{different}} approach to nestedness detection: It selects the largest set of nodes that exhibit some level of nestedness.

The larger the disorder the more of these nodes exist. Indeed, for ρ _rew≳ 7, the size of the nested component, as detected by NESTLON, vanishes.|$|R

40|$|Many VLSI routing applications, {{as well as}} the {{facility}} location problem involve computation of Steiner trees with non-linear cost measures. We consider two most frequent versions of this problem. In the power-p Steiner problem the the cost is defined as the sum of the <b>edge</b> length <b>raised</b> to power p, while in the bottleneck Steiner problem the cost is the maximum of the edge lengths. In contrast to the classical Steiner problem, the objective of the power-p and bottleneck Steiner tree problems is to minimize the sum of the <b>edge</b> lengths <b>raised</b> to the p power or the maximum edge length, respectively. We show that the both problems are NP-hard and, moreover, the bottleneck Steiner trees cannot be approximated with the factor less than 2, unless P = NP. We prove that the minimum spanning tree only constant times worse than the power-p Steiner tree in any metric space. In particular, for p = 2, we show that the minimum spanning tree is at most 23. 3 times worse than the optimum and construct [...] ...|$|R
40|$|In this study, a novel {{method is}} {{presented}} for segmentation of the endocardium and epicardium {{of the left}} ventricle in cardiac magnetic resonance images using snake models. We first generalize the DDGVF snake model by introducing two spatially varying weighting functions which characterize the boundary information; this generalized DDGVF snake can conquer the spurious <b>edges</b> <b>raised</b> by artifacts while maintaining the desirable properties of DDGVF of distinguishing {{the positive and negative}} boundaries. This is especially helpful for the tasks on hand because the endocardium and epicardium of the LV in MR images can be characterized as positive and negative boundaries. Observed that the left ventricle is roughly a circle, a shape constraint based on circle is introduced into the snake model. This new constraint can prevent the snake contour from being trapped and leaking out so as to maintain the global shape of the snake contour during evolution. In addition, fourth-order PDEs are employed for noise removal. We demonstrate the proposed approach on an in vivo dataset and compare the segmented contours with manual collections; the results show its effectiveness...|$|R
