5|$|Investigating {{appropriations}} led Randall {{to focus}} on financial impropriety in Congress and the Grant administration. The most famous of these was the Crédit Mobilier scandal. In this scheme, the Union Pacific Railroad bankrupted itself by overpaying its construction company, the Crédit Mobilier of America. Crédit Mobilier was owned by the railroad's principal shareholders and, as the investigation discovered, several congressmen also owned shares {{that they had been}} allowed to purchase at discounted prices. Randall's role in the investigation was limited, but he proposed bills to ban such frauds and sought to impeach Vice President Schuyler Colfax, who had been implicated in the scandal. Randall was involved with the investigation of several other scandals, as well, including tax fraud by private tax collection contractors (known as the Sanborn incident) and <b>fraud</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> awarding of postal contracts (the star route scandal).|$|E

25|$|There are {{two types}} of {{misrepresentation}}: <b>fraud</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> factum and fraud in inducement. <b>Fraud</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> factum focuses on whether the party alleging misrepresentation knew they were creating a contract. If the party did not know that they were entering into a contract, there is no meeting of the minds, and the contract is void. Fraud in inducement focuses on misrepresentation attempting to get the party to enter into the contract. Misrepresentation of a material fact (if the party knew the truth, that party would not have entered into the contract) makes a contract voidable.|$|E

40|$|The study {{examines}} {{the application of}} forensic auditing <b>in</b> <b>fraud</b> control <b>in</b> Nigerian banks. Nigerian banks over the past decades suffered from the menace of frauds which resulted to distresses and liquidations which hamper the roles of banks <b>in</b> <b>the</b> economy. The external auditors failed to detect <b>the</b> <b>frauds</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> course of carrying out their work. Regulatory evidences have shown that bank frauds increase on daily basis. Analysis {{of the types of}} frauds and forgeries perpetrated show that the most common types are: ATM fraud; fraudulent transfers/withdrawals; internet banking; lodgement of stolen warrants; presentation of forged cheques; suppression of customer deposit. The study analysed <b>the</b> trend <b>in</b> <b>fraud</b> cases from 2001 - 2012, included are <b>the</b> amounts involved <b>in</b> <b>frauds,</b> <b>the</b> most frequent types of fraud, and the losses sustained by banks. The analysis revealed that there are up and down movements <b>in</b> <b>fraud</b> cases. Since banks continually lose huge sums of money {{as a result of the}} inability of the auditors and the supervisory regulators to curtail the trend, there is therefore the need to devise different means of tackling <b>frauds</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> banks. The study therefore suggests employment of forensic auditing in Nigerian banks by amending <b>the</b> existing statutes, <b>in</b> such a way that forensic auditors are included <b>in</b> <b>the</b> audit team.
