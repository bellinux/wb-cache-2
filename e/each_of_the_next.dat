In 2006–07, Bryan Colangelo's first full season as President and General Manager, a {{combination}} of Bosh, 2006 first overall NBA draft pick Andrea Bargnani and a revamp of the roster helped the Raptors qualify for their first playoff berth in five years, capturing the Atlantic Division title with 47 wins.

Hunt returned a week later and scored a try in <b>each</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>next</b> three games. However, he only scored three more tries in the remaining sixteen weeks of the season. Hunt {{was a part of the}} junior Australian representative team at the end of the 2005 season, but was not considered for the game against Papua New Guinea for personal reasons.|$|E

In 1976, which would be Mitchell's last with the team, they fell off a bit with a 93 record, but they still remained in the top-fifteen nationwide. Mitchell helped develop Leroy Cook who was a two-time All-America selection drafted in the 10th round of the 1976 NFL Draft by the Dallas Cowboys and selected as one of two defensive ends on the All-time Alabama team named by Sports Illustrated in 2006.|$|E

5|$|The {{following}} {{season in}} 1963–64, O'Neill started poorly, passing 12 {{only once in}} his first six innings. However, he was retained for the team for the First Test against South Africa in Brisbane, where he scored 82 and 19 not out in a drawn match. He continued his resurgence with 36 and 61 not out the following fixture against Victoria, but was injured during the second innings and forced to retire hurt. This meant that he missed the Second Test, which Australia won by eight wickets. O'Neill returned and scored half centuries in <b>each</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>next</b> two Tests. He also took two wickets to end the series with 285 runs at 40.71 and three wickets at 32.33. He added a further two half-centuries in the remaining Shield matches.|$|E

After some run-ins with Van Exel, displeasure with Harris's strategies, and a first round loss to the Rockets, Johnson decided to retire for the final time after the season.|$|E

5|$|Harvey {{played against}} an {{international}} outfit {{for the first}} time in the following match against the touring England cricket team, but made only three in his solitary innings. However, he continued to score consistently, making a half-century in <b>each</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>next</b> three matches. From the third of these matchesagainst South Australiaonwards, he generally opened the batting for Queensland. On his first innings back as an opener, he narrowly missed a century, being dismissed for 95 by Geff Noblet. However, it was enough for the Queenslanders to take a 162-run first innings lead in a low-scoring match in which only one team surpassed 240 once, and set up an eight-wicket victory, the only time his state won a match for the season. Harvey’s performance tapered away in the last two matches of the season. He made only 0 and 2 in the last match against Victoria, and 48 runs in his last four innings.|$|E
5|$|The Cardinals {{were leading}} the Yankees 3–0 {{by the end}} of the inning. The Yankees failed to produce any offense in the fifth inning, but the Cardinals added to their lead by picking up a run when Billy Southworth beat the tag at home {{following}} a Jim Bottomley grounder to second base. Ruether was then replaced by Bob Shawkey, who closed out the inning by yielding two weak infield groundouts. The Yankees picked up one hit in <b>each</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>next</b> two innings, but could not produce any runs. Yankees pitcher Myles Thomas came in to pitch a hitless ninth inning. With one out in the top of the ninth inning, Lou Gehrig hit a line drive single into right field, but Lazzeri grounded into a double play, ending the game as a 4–0 Cardinals victory. Haines pitched a complete game shutout, and only gave up five hits total, two of which came from Gehrig.|$|E
5|$|The team {{struggled}} in <b>each</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>next</b> two seasons, winning just 14 of their 42 league matches in each season, resulting in league finishes of 14th and 17th respectively. In 2004–05, the club had its most successful FA Trophy campaign, reaching the Third round before being eliminated 2–1 by Histon. During {{the summer of}} 2006, head coach Paul Tisdale left the club {{to take up the}} vacant manager's position at Exeter City. He was replaced at Team Bath by Andy Tillson, a former Grimsby Town and Bristol Rovers defender. The 2006–07 season brought success to both Bath clubs; Bath City won the Southern League, and Team Bath finished as runners-up. In the playoffs, Team Bath won their semi final against Hemel Hempstead Town 3–1, and advanced to play Maidenhead United in the final. Maidenhead, who had been relegated from the Conference South the season before, won the match 1–0, consigning Team Bath to another season in the Southern League. Team Bath repeated their league form the following season, and once again finished as runners-up, this time behind King's Lynn. A 4–1 victory against Bashley in the playoff semi-final, aided by a hat-trick from the league's top-scorer Sean Canham, saw Bath reach their second successive playoff final. Team Bath improved on the previous season, beating Halesowen Town 2–1 in the final, Canham once again providing Bath with a decisive goal in the 89th minute. The win secured the team a place in the Conference South.|$|E
