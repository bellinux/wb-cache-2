40|$|The {{rivers in}} northernmost Europe support {{many of the}} largest wild Atlantic salmon stocks {{supplying}} up to 60 % of the total annual catch in the world, but very {{little is known about}} their relative contributions to coastal fisheries. We generated a comprehensive Atlantic salmon genetic baseline consisting of 185 populations along the Norwegian, Barents and White Sea coasts, genotyped for a high number of genetic markers, which has a <b>dense</b> <b>geographical</b> <b>coverage</b> and includes all notable stocks in the region. The hierarchical genetic structure observed was the basis for defining 7 regional and 26 local re 3 porting groups (RGs) enabling practical implementation of genetic stock identification (GSI). The GSI accuracy varied across populations and the study area, depending on the level of genetic structuring, but a high level of accuracy was achieved when individuals were classified to regional (97 %) or to local (90 %) RGs. Simulations showed that salmon from the majority of the largest populations in northernmost Europe can be reliably identified in Norwegian and Russian coastal mixed-stock fisheries. The baseline will be an invaluable resource for development of future adaptive management regimes for Atlantic salmon in northern Europe...|$|E
40|$|Increasingly, user {{generated}} content (UGC) {{in social}} media postings and their associated metadata such as time and location stamps {{are being used to}} provide useful operational information during natural hazard events such as hurricanes, storms and floods. The main advantage of these new sources of data are twofold. First, in a purely additive sense, they can provide much <b>denser</b> <b>geographical</b> <b>coverage</b> of the hazard as compared to traditional sensor networks. Second, they provide what physical sensors are not able to do: By documenting personal observations and experiences, they directly record the impact of a hazard on the human environment. For this reason interpretation of the content (e. g., hashtags, images, text, emojis, etc) and metadata (e. g., keywords, tags, geolocation) have been a focus of much research into social media analytics. However, as choices of semantic tags in the current methods are usually reduced to the exact name or type of the event (e. g., hashtags '#Sandy' or '#flooding'), the main limitation of such approaches remains their mere nowcasting capacity. In this study we make use of polysemous tags of images posted during several recent flood events and demonstrate how such volunteered geographic data can be used to provide early warning of an event before its outbreak...|$|R
