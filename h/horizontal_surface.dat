5|$|Lissitzky, {{aware of}} severe {{mismatch}} between his {{ideas and the}} existing urban landscape, experimented with different configurations of the <b>horizontal</b> <b>surface</b> and height-to-width ratios so that the structure appeared balanced visually ("spatial balance is in the contrast of vertical and horizontal tensions"). The raised platform was shaped {{in a way that}} each of its four facets looked distinctly different. Each tower faced the Kremlin with the same facet, providing a pointing arrow to pedestrians on the streets. All eight buildings were planned identically, so Lissitzky proposed color-coding them for easier orientation.|$|E
5|$|Steel {{cylinders}} {{are manufactured}} with domed (convex) and dished (concave) bottoms. The dished profile {{allows them to}} stand upright on a <b>horizontal</b> <b>surface,</b> and is the standard shape for industrial cylinders. The cylinders used for emergency gas supply on diving bells are often this shape, and commonly have a water capacity of about 50 litres ("J"). Domed bottoms give a larger volume for the same cylinder mass, and are the standard for scuba cylinders up to 18 litres water capacity, though some concave bottomed cylinders have been marketed for scuba.|$|E
5|$|This martin {{builds a}} deep bowl nest on a {{sheltered}} <b>horizontal</b> <b>surface,</b> or a neat quarter-sphere against a vertical rock face or wall. The nest is constructed with mud pellets and lined with grass or feathers, {{and may be}} built on natural sites under cliff overhangs or on man-made structures such as buildings and bridges. It is often reused for subsequent broods or in later years. This species is often a solitary breeder, but small groups may breed close together in suitable locations. The two or three eggs of a typical clutch are white with brown and grey blotches, and are incubated by both adults for 16–19 days prior to hatching. Both parents then feed the chicks. Fledging takes another 22–24 days, although the young birds {{will return to the}} nest to roost for {{a few days after the}} first flight.|$|E
40|$|The {{structure}} {{and distribution of}} the sponge community in ¢ve sites and four habitats in Cagarras Archipelago, Rio de Janeiro, Brazil, are described. The archipelago has three major islands (Cagarra, Palmas, and Comprida), and four islets. Qualitative samples were taken by SCUBA diving in the three islands and in two islets, and quantitative samples were taken in Palmas Island only. Cluster analysis using Jaccard’s coe⁄cient on qualitative data grouped the two islets (Cagarra Bank and Cagarra Islet), which are more exposed to wave action, and the three islands formed a group of relatively sheltered sites. Cluster analysis using Bray^Curtis coe⁄cient on quantitative data from di¡erent habitats in Palmas Island allowed distinction of three groups of samples: overhangs, shallow <b>horizontal</b> <b>surfaces</b> (6 m depth), and vertical walls plus deeper <b>horizontal</b> <b>surfaces</b> (17 m depth). Sponge abundance was greater in overhangs (61. 2 indm 2), which were dominated by Protosuberites sp. and Clathrina conifera. Abundance was reduced in vertical walls (31. 1 indm 2) and deep <b>horizontal</b> <b>surfaces</b> (16. 8 indm 2). Pachychalina sp. dominated the deep <b>horizontal</b> <b>surfaces</b> and Clathrina conifera was dominant in overhangs. Values of Shannon’s diversity in overhangs, vertical walls (both with H 02. 1 bits ind 1) and deep <b>horizontal</b> <b>surfaces</b> (H 01. 7 bits ind 1) were moderate and similar, whereas in shallow <b>horizontal</b> <b>surfaces</b> the sponges were both less diverse (H 00. 37) and less abundant (8. 5 indm 2). Shallow <b>horizontal</b> <b>surfaces</b> were dominated by Hymeniacidon heliophila. The reduced species richness of the sponge community in Cagarras Archipelago when compared with other sites in Brazil and elsewhere is probably {{due in part to}} the pollution from the city of Rio de Janeiro. Wave action appears to reduce the number of sponge species at a local scale, whereas substrate inclination a¡ects more strongly the species composition and abundance than the diversity of sponges...|$|R

5|$|After {{completing}} all but {{its last}} moult, the caterpillar spins a cocoon out of silk. The cocoon {{can be in}} the tree crown or between two leaves, but is most often near the ground, between moss and bark. It is an open network cocoon with large and irregular mesh. In the warm season, the cocoon takes about 10 hours to spin, the metamorphosis takes place about 29 hours later and lasts about 6 minutes. These durations are slightly longer in the cold season. The chrysalis stage lasts 17 days in November, the warmest month, and 23 days in July, the coldest month. Five to six days before eclosion, the motifs of the wings start to become visible. The moth emerges during the night or in low light, by splitting the pupal case from the top. Once out of the pupal exuvia (the pupal exoskeleton), the moth finds a <b>horizontal</b> <b>surface,</b> from which it suspends itself by its four anterior legs. The wings are deployed in about 10 minutes, by pumping haemolymph into the wing veins. The moth then beats them a few times, waits 45 minutes to let them harden, then beats them lightly again. The moth finally takes flight between one and a half to two hours later.|$|E
25|$|The {{effect is}} caused by {{resonances}} in {{a body of water}} that has been disturbed by one or more factors, most often meteorological effects (wind and atmospheric pressure variations), seismic activity, or tsunamis. Gravity always seeks to restore the <b>horizontal</b> <b>surface</b> of a body of liquid water, as this represents the configuration in which the water is in hydrostatic equilibrium.|$|E
25|$|The {{bacterium}} Micrococcus flacidifex danai also infects larvae. Just before pupation, {{the larvae}} migrate to a <b>horizontal</b> <b>surface</b> and die {{a few hours}} later, attached only by one pair of prolegs, with the thorax and abdomen hanging limp. The body turns black shortly after. The bacterium Pseudomonas aeruginosa has no invasive powers, but causes secondary infections in weakened insects. It is a common {{cause of death in}} laboratory-reared insects.|$|E

40|$|A {{series of}} tests {{was made in the}} N. A. C. A. free {{spinning}} tunnel to find the effect upon spinning characteristics of systematic changes in tail arrangement. The tests were made with a 1 / 16 -scale made of a low-wing monoplane of modern design. The changes consisted of: (1) variation of the fuselage length; (2) variation of the fore-and-aft location of the vertical surfaces; and (3) variation of the vertical location of the <b>horizontal</b> <b>surfaces.</b> The spinning characteristics of the model, including the number of turns required for recovery, were found to vary systematically and regularly with systematic changes in the tail arrangement. The following changes in tail arrangement had harmful effects upon the recovery characteristics (which originally were excellent) : (1) shortening the fuselage; (2) placing the vertical surfaces directly above the <b>horizontal</b> <b>surfaces</b> as compared with locations either fore or aft of this position; (3) moving the <b>horizontal</b> <b>surfaces</b> downward from their original location {{at the top of the}} fuselage...|$|R

25|$|Eddies are formed, like hydraulics, on the {{downstream}} {{face of an}} obstruction. Unlike hydraulics, eddies swirl on the <b>horizontal</b> <b>surface</b> of the water. Typically, they are calm spots where the downward movement of water is partially or fully arrested—a nice place to rest or to make one's way upstream. However, in very powerful water, eddies can have powerful, swirling currents which can flip boats and from which escape can be very difficult.|$|E
25|$|Likewise, UV {{intensity}} can {{be higher}} or lower for surfaces at different angles to the horizontal. For example, if people are walking or standing outdoors, UV exposure to the eyes and vertical surfaces of skin, such as the face, can actually be more severe {{when the sun is}} lower (though UVB:UVA ratio can also differ), such as the end of a summer's day, or winter afternoons on a ski trail. This is partly a consequence {{of the fact that the}} measurement equipment upon which the index is based is a flat <b>horizontal</b> <b>surface.</b>|$|E
25|$|Rock Band 3 {{introduced}} keyboard {{parts for}} songs {{for the first}} time in a rhythm game. MadCatz produced the new keyboard controller for the official release which resembles a keytar with a handle to one side; this allows it to be either worn using a guitar strap or placed on a <b>horizontal</b> <b>surface.</b> The keyboard features 25 full-sized velocity-sensitive keys, and is MIDI compatible, allowing it to be used outside the game. For instance, Freezepop, a band which has close ties to members of Harmonix, has used the keyboard controller as a keytar for their stage shows.|$|E

50|$|Polarized {{sunglasses}} use {{the principle}} of Brewster's angle to reduce glare from the sun reflecting off <b>horizontal</b> <b>surfaces</b> such as water or road. In a large range of angles around Brewster's angle, the reflection of p-polarized light is lower than s-polarized light. Thus, if the sun is low in the sky, reflected light is mostly s-polarized. Polarizing sunglasses use a polarizing material such as Polaroid sheets to block horizontally-polarized light, preferentially blocking reflections from <b>horizontal</b> <b>surfaces.</b> The effect is strongest with smooth surfaces such as water, but reflections from roads and the ground are also reduced.|$|R

25|$|At {{this stage}} of development, it is {{relatively}} large compared to the earlier instars. The caterpillar completes its growth. At this point, it is 25 to 45mm long and 5 to 8mm wide. This {{can be compared to}} the first instar, which was 2 to 6mm long and 0.5 to 1.5mm wide. Fifth-instar larvae increase in weight 2000 times from first instars. Fifth-stage instar larva chew through the petiole or midrib of milkweed leaves and stop the flow of latex. After this, they eat more leaf tissue. Before pupation, larva must consume milkweed to increase their mass. Larva stop feeding and search for a pupation site. The caterpillar attaches itself securely to a <b>horizontal</b> <b>surface,</b> using a silk pad. At this point, it latches on with its hindlegs and hangs down. It then molts into an opaque, blue-green chrysalis with small gold dots. At normal summer temperatures, it matures in 8–15 days. The cuticle of the chrysalis becomes transparent and the monarch's characteristic orange-and-black wings become visible. At the end of metamorphosis, the adult emerges from the chrysalis, expands and dries its wings and flies away. Monarch metamorphosis from egg to adult occurs during the warm summer temperatures in as little as 25 days, extending to as many as seven weeks during cool spring conditions. During the development, both larva and their milkweed hosts are vulnerable to weather extremes, predators, parasites and diseases; commonly fewer than 10% of monarch eggs and caterpillars survive.|$|E

40|$|We present planforms of line plumes {{formed on}} <b>horizontal</b> <b>surfaces</b> in {{turbulent}} convection, {{along with the}} length of line plumes measured from these planforms, in a six decade range of Rayleigh numbers (10 (5) < Ra < 10 (11)) and at three Prandtl numbers (Pr = 0. 7, 5. 2, 602). Using geometric constraints on the relations for the mean plume spacings, we obtain expressions for the total length of near-wall plumes on <b>horizontal</b> <b>surfaces</b> in turbulent convection. The plume length per unit area (L(p) /A), made dimensionless by the near-wall length scale in turbulent convection (Z(w)), remains constant for a given fluid. The Nusselt number is shown to be directly proportional to L(p) H/A for a given fluid layer of height H. The increase in Pr has a weak influence in decreasing L(p) /A. These expressions match the measurements, thereby showing that the assumption of laminar natural convection boundary layers in turbulent convection {{is consistent with the}} observed total length of line plumes. We then show that similar relationships are obtained {{based on the assumption that}} the line plumes are the outcome of the instability of laminar natural convection boundary layers on the <b>horizontal</b> <b>surfaces...</b>|$|R

2500|$|A common {{situation}} {{with a simple}} stress pattern is when a straight rod, with uniform material and cross section, is subjected to tension by opposite forces of magnitude [...] along its axis. [...] If the system is in equilibrium and not changing with time, {{and the weight of}} the bar can be neglected, then through each transversal section of the bar the top part must pull on the bottom part with the same force F.

In the simple case of a mass resting on a <b>horizontal</b> <b>surface,</b> the only component of the normal force is the force due to gravity, where [...] In this case, the magnitude of the friction force is the product of the mass of the object, the acceleration due to gravity, and the coefficient of friction. However, the coefficient of friction is not a function of mass or volume; it depends only on the material. For instance, a large aluminum block has the same coefficient of friction as a small aluminum block. However, the magnitude of the friction force itself depends on the normal force, and hence on the mass of the block.|$|E
2500|$|In exposed systems, wind {{can create}} turbulent, spiral-formed surface {{currents}} called Langmuir circulations (Fig. 3). [...] Exactly how these currents become established {{is still not}} well understood, but {{it is evident that}} it involves some interaction between <b>horizontal</b> <b>surface</b> currents and surface gravity waves. [...] The visible result of these rotations, which can be seen in any lake, are the surface foamlines that run parallel to the wind direction. [...] Positively buoyant particles and small organisms concentrate in the foamline at the surface and negatively buoyant objects are found in the upwelling current between the two rotations. [...] Objects with neutral buoyancy tend to be evenly distributed in the water column. This turbulence circulates nutrients in the water column, making it crucial for many pelagic species, however its effect on benthic and profundal organisms is minimal to non-existent, respectively. The degree of nutrient circulation is system specific, as it depends upon such factors as wind strength and duration, as well as lake or pool depth and productivity.|$|E
