5|$|A {{compound}} <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>milk</b> of the tammar wallaby called AGG01 has {{the potential}} to be a new and powerful antibiotic. AGG01 is a protein, and in laboratory tests has proven to be 100 times more effective than penicillin. It has killed over 99% of the pathogenic bacteria, (both Gram-positive and Gram-negative), that it was incubated with, including Salmonella, Proteus vulgaris and Staphylococcus aureus. It also killed one species of fungus. Subsequent analysis of the genome has led to the discovery of several cathelicidin peptides, which could also be used as antibiotics.|$|E
5|$|As {{one of his}} {{grandparents}} was born in Wales he was eligible {{to play for the}} Welsh national team, and after representing the country at under-19 and under-21 level he won his first senior cap, an award given to a player representing his national team, in 2005. In 2008, he won his twelfth cap, breaking the record for the most international caps received by a Gillingham player. Crofts was selected for the Welsh national under-19 team in 2002, qualifying due to having a Welsh grandparent. He made his first appearance for the team <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>Milk</b> Cup tournament in Northern Ireland, but was forced to return home after suffering an ankle injury in the Welsh team's first match.

5|$|The schoolboys {{sections}} of Shamrock Rovers and Tallaght Town merged in 1997 {{to form a}} new section to serve the Tallaght area of South West Dublin. Tallaght Town initially remained in operation with three intermediate teams participating in the Leinster Senior League. Two of these teams continue to compete, but under the name of Shamrock Rovers. Tallaght Town exists as a limited company and as trustee of a training facility used by the youth teams at Shamrock Rovers. There are sixteen of these teams, composed of over 200 players and 35 managers and coaches. They cater for players in the six to nineteen years of age group. The club's youth teams have participated <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>Milk</b> Cup and Dallas Cup. The club operates scholarships covering all levels of education. In conjunction with IT Tallaght, they offer third level education to players and have introduced a scholarship scheme that facilitates primary school students through the Junior Certificate cycle.|$|E
40|$|The aim of {{this thesis}} was to {{evaluated}} fertility and milk performance due to multiple milking technology which was used. The monitoring was carried in 2011 in farms Agrospol, Malý Bor a. s. and the farm Dub. System evaluation of fertility and milk performance of dairy cows at multiple milking were evaluated in 186 lactations of Czech pied cattle breeding. The average number of <b>milking</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> parlour was 2. 96 x/day and robot 2. 36 x/day. 107 lactations were obtained during <b>milking</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>milking</b> parlour and 79 of lactation during milking by robots. In this thesis were measured indicators of fertility (insemination interval, service period, the mean time and age at first calving) and indicators of milk production (lactation length, <b>the</b> amount of <b>milk</b> fat, protein and lactose content). <b>In</b> <b>the</b> reproductive indicators were taken statistically highly difference in age at first calving, where the average difference was 195 days. For other indicators of fertility were all statistically significant results in favor of <b>milking</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>milking</b> parlour (2. 96 x/day). Czech pied cattle <b>milked</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>milking</b> parlour per normative lactation average amount of milk produced 8 599. 8 kg, cows milked by robot 7 272. 5 kg. Among these values was statistically highly significant difference. <b>The</b> best results <b>in</b> <b>the</b> production of <b>milk</b> per normative lactation were gained by <b>milked</b> cows <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>milking</b> parlour (9 284. 4 kg) and the second lactation cows <b>milked</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>milking</b> parlour (9 033. 0 kg) on the third and more lactation. <b>The</b> lowest <b>milk</b> production <b>in</b> normative lactation gained dairy cows milked by robot at first lactation (6 874. 7 kg). The higher average fat content had dairy cows <b>milked</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>milking</b> parlour with a value of 4. 47 %, dairy cows milked by robot had fat content of 4. 15 %. Between these values was statically highly significant difference. <b>In</b> <b>the</b> average protein content in dairy cows has been demonstrated statistically significant difference. Dairy cows <b>milked</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>milking</b> parlour reached <b>the</b> value 3. 41 % compared to cows milked by a robot, where the average value of protein was 3. 47 %. <b>The</b> difference <b>in</b> lactose content between groups was not statistically significant...|$|R

40|$|Abstract. The aim of {{the study}} was to analyse the effect of {{changing}} <b>the</b> <b>milking</b> sys-tem (from a milking parlour to automatic milking) on daily yield of cows and cytolo-gical quality of their milk. GLM and FREQ procedures of the SAS package were used <b>in</b> <b>the</b> statistical calculations. <b>The</b> change <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>milking</b> system caused a short-term decrease in daily yield and an increase in milk somatic cell count (SCC). <b>In</b> <b>the</b> long term (12 months), daily yield increased (P ≤ 0. 01) from 27. 7 kg milk for cows <b>milked</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>milking</b> parlour to 31. 1 kg milk for cows <b>milked</b> automatically. <b>The</b> change <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>milking</b> system from <b>the</b> <b>milking</b> parlour to automatic milking had a positive effect on milk somatic cell count as the natural logarithm of SCC decreased from 12. 44 to 11. 97. <b>The</b> proportion of <b>milk</b> samples with low SCC ( 400, 000 cells · ml− 1) decreased by 5. 68 %.

25|$|Microfiltration is {{a process}} that {{partially}} replaces pasteurization and produces milk with fewer microorganisms and longer shelf life without a change in the taste of the milk. In this process, cream is separated from the whey and is pasteurized in the usual way, but the whey is forced through ceramic microfilters that trap 99.9% of microorganisms <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>milk</b> (as compared to 99.999% killing of microorganisms in standard HTST pasteurization). The whey then is recombined with the pasteurized cream to reconstitute the original milk composition.|$|E
25|$|Fires have {{historically}} been a vital component of the grassland ecosystem, but {{pose a threat to}} human life and property. <b>In</b> <b>the</b> <b>Milk</b> River Natural Area, management policy is suppression of wildfires, with prescribed controlled burns allowed for ecosystem maintenance purposes to manage the grassland in its climax state. Campfires are permitted but discouraged. Following the 2007 wildfire, inventories were conducted which showed an increase in species richness and also good recovery of native species with little invasion of exotics. Invasive weed species that have been found in the area, such as nodding thistle, are being controlled by spot spraying and hand picking. Larger species like the Russian olive are cut down and spot-treated.|$|E
25|$|Milk {{often is}} homogenized, a {{treatment}} that prevents a cream layer from separating {{out of the}} milk. The milk is pumped at high pressures through very narrow tubes, breaking up the fat globules through turbulence and cavitation. A greater number of smaller particles possess more total surface area than {{a smaller number of}} larger ones, and the original fat globule membranes cannot completely cover them. Casein micelles are attracted to the newly exposed fat surfaces. Nearly one-third of the micelles <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>milk</b> end up participating in this new membrane structure. The casein weighs down the globules and interferes with the clustering that accelerated separation. The exposed fat globules are vulnerable to certain enzymes present in milk, which could break down the fats and produce rancid flavors. To prevent this, the enzymes are inactivated by pasteurizing the milk immediately before or during homogenization.|$|E
40|$|A {{portable}} {{wireless device}} with a “vocal commands” feature for activating <b>the</b> mechanical <b>milking</b> phase <b>in</b> conventional milking parlors {{was developed and}} tested to increase the level of automation <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>milking</b> procedures. <b>The</b> device was tested <b>in</b> <b>the</b> laboratory and <b>in</b> a milking parlor. Four professional milkers participated <b>in</b> <b>the</b> experiment. Before {{the start of the}} tests, a set of acoustic models with speaker-dependent commands defined for the project was acquired for each milker using a dedicated “milker training procedure”. Two experimental sessions were performed by each milker, with one session <b>in</b> <b>the</b> laboratory and a subsequent session <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>milking</b> parlor. <b>The</b> device performance was evaluated based on <b>the</b> accuracy demonstrated <b>in</b> <b>the</b> vocal command recognition task and rated using the word recognition rate (WRR). The data were expressed as %WRR and grouped based on the different cases evaluated. Mixed effects logistic regression modeling was used to evaluate the association between the %WRR and explanatory variables. The results indicated significant effects due to the location where the tests were performed. Higher values of the %WRR were found for tests performed <b>in</b> <b>the</b> laboratory, whereas lower values were found for tests performed <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>milking</b> parlor (due to the presence of background noise). Nevertheless, the general performance level achieved by the device was sufficient for increasing the automation level of conventional milking parlors...|$|R

25|$|Lactose {{is also a}} {{commercial}} food additive used for its texture, flavor, and adhesive qualities. It is found in additives labelled as casein, caseinate, whey, lactoserum, milk solids, modified milk ingredients, etc. As such lactose is found in foods such as processed meats (sausages/hot dogs, sliced meats, pâtés), gravy stock powder, margarines, sliced breads, breakfast cereals, potato chips, processed foods, medications, prepared meals, meal replacements (powders and bars), protein supplements (powders and bars), and even beers <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>milk</b> stout style. Some barbecue sauces and liquid cheeses used in fast-food restaurants may also contain lactose. Lactose is often used as the primary filler (main ingredient) in most prescription and non-prescription solid pill form medications, though product labeling seldom mentions the presence of 'lactose' or 'milk', and neither do product monograms provided to pharmacists, and most pharmacists are unaware of the very wide scale yet common use of lactose in such medications until they contact the supplier or manufacturer for verification.|$|E
25|$|Upon {{standing}} for 12 to 24 hours, fresh milk {{has a tendency}} to separate into a high-fat cream layer on top of a larger, low-fat milk layer. The cream often is sold as a separate product with its own uses. Today the separation of the cream from the milk usually is accomplished rapidly in centrifugal cream separators. The fat globules rise {{to the top of a}} container of milk because fat is less dense than water. The smaller the globules, the more other molecular-level forces prevent this from happening. In fact, the cream rises in cow's milk much more quickly than a simple model would predict: rather than isolated globules, the fat <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>milk</b> tends to form into clusters containing about a million globules, held together by a number of minor whey proteins. These clusters rise faster than individual globules can. The fat globules in milk from goats, sheep, and water buffalo do not form clusters as readily and are smaller to begin with, resulting in a slower separation of cream from these milks.|$|E
25|$|Domestic kobolds {{are linked}} to a {{specific}} household. Some legends claim that every house has a resident kobold, regardless of its owners' desires or needs. The means by which a kobold enters a new home vary from tale to tale. One tradition claims that the kobold enters the household by announcing itself at night by strewing wood chips about the house and putting dirt or cow manure <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>milk</b> cans. If {{the master of the}} house leaves the wood chips and drinks the soiled milk, the kobold takes up residence. The kobold Heinzelmann of Hundermühlen Castle arrived in 1584 and announced himself by knocking and making other sounds. Should someone take pity on a kobold {{in the form of a}} cold, wet creature and take it inside to warm it, the spirit takes up residence there. A tradition from Perleberg in northern Germany says that a homeowner must follow specific instructions to lure a kobold to his house. He must go on St John's Day between noon and one o'clock, into the forest. When he finds an anthill with a bird on it, he must say a certain phrase, which causes the bird to transform into a small person. The figure then leaps into a bag carried by the homeowner, and he can then transfer the kobold to his home. Even if servants come and go, the kobold stays.|$|E

25|$|The Milk River Natural Area {{is part of}} the Grasslands Natural Region, one of six natural {{regions in}} Alberta. Within the Grasslands Region, it {{is part of the}} Dry Mixedgrass Natural Subregion, {{characterized}} by the most arid conditions in Alberta, with hot summers, cold winters with little snow cover, and high evaporation leaving a large moisture deficit in the growing season. Annual precipitation averages less than 300mm (12 inches). Soils of the area are primarily solonetzic and brown chernozemic. At the next sub-level, {{it is part of the}} Northwestern Glaciated Plains Ecoregion, the predominant ecoregion throughout the Milk River watershed. With its diverse landscape of grasslands, shrubs, badlands, wetlands, and riparian woodlands, the Milk River Natural Area supports a large number of rare, threatened, and endangered species in a relatively small amount of space. Overall, 80% of Alberta's species at risk are concentrated <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>Milk</b> River Watershed area as a whole. Fire is a significant ecological process, with the last large wildfire having occurred in August 2007. It was caused by a lightning strike in Montana and crossed the international border, but was quickly suppressed after burning 125 hectares of the natural area and 38 hectares in neighboring Kennedy Coulee Ecological Reserve. As a relatively large and undisturbed representation of natural mixedgrass containing rare or unique landforms, habitat for focal species, and intact riparian areas, it has been identified as an Environmentally Significant Area (ESA) with national significance.|$|E
