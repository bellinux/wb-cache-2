5|$|The Elmer S. Dailey was {{originally}} {{known as the}} Claire B. Follette when it was built by William H. Follette in 1915 at Tonawanda, New York. In 1928, the ship was rebuilt by Brown Drydock on Staten Island and acquired the name Elmer S. Dailey. Brown Drydock installed two Fairbanks-Morse in-line six-cylinder diesel engines and added the pilothouse and stack. At an unspecified later date, one engine was removed and a <b>direct-drive</b> engine, rated at 180 or 210 horsepower, operated on compressed air. In its final configuration, the vessel was manned by a three-man crew.|$|E
5|$|The {{survivors}} were refitted {{several times}} during the interwar period to remedy these issues, although no comprehensive modernisation was ever planned. These included installation of director control mounted in new tripod foremasts, replacement of the rangefinders by larger units, the addition of more rangefinders, the alteration of the main gun turrets to allow elevation up to 23°, partial replacement of the coal-fired boilers by oil-fired units, the replacement of the <b>direct-drive</b> turbines by geared turbines, the removal of the bow armour to reduce the weight forward, and the addition of more modern anti-aircraft guns.|$|E
5|$|Unable to {{construct}} new capital ships until 1931, Japan resorted to upgrading battleships and battlecruisers. In July 1926, Haruna {{became the first}} of Japan's vessels to undergo extensive modernization and modification, in drydock at Yokosuka Naval Arsenal. Over the next two years, her horizontal armor near her ammunition magazines was strengthened, and the machinery spaces within the hull were increased. Anti-torpedo bulges were added along the waterline, as permitted by the Washington Treaty. She was refitted to accommodate three Type90 Model0 floatplanes. To increase her speed and power capacities, all 36 Yarrow boilers were removed and replaced with 16 newer boilers, and Brown-Curtis <b>direct-drive</b> turbines were installed. Harunas forward funnel was removed, and her second funnel was enlarged and lengthened. The modifications to her hull increased her armor weight from 6,502 to 10,313long tons, directly violating {{the terms of the}} Washington Treaty. In July 1928, Haruna—now capable of speeds of —was reclassified as a battleship.|$|E
25|$|<b>Direct-drive</b> reels {{have the}} spool and handle {{directly}} coupled. When the handle moves forwards, the spool moves forwards, and vice versa. With a fast-running fish, {{this may have}} consequences for the angler's knuckles. Traditional fly reels are <b>direct-drive.</b>|$|E

25|$|DJ turntablism has {{origins in}} the {{invention}} of <b>direct-drive</b> turntables. Early belt-drive turntables were unsuitable for turntablism and mixing, since they had a slow start-up time, and they were prone to wear-and-tear and breakage, as the belt would break from backspinning or scratching. The first <b>direct-drive</b> turntable was invented by Shuichi Obata, an engineer at Matsushita (now Panasonic), based in Osaka, Japan. It eliminated belts, and instead employed a motor to directly drive a platter on which a vinyl record rests. In 1969, Matsushita released it as the SP-10, the first <b>direct-drive</b> turntable on the market, and the first in their influential Technics series of turntables.|$|E

25|$|O-7: Three O-2s {{refitted}} {{with the}} 510-hp (380kW) Packard 2A-1500 <b>direct-drive</b> engine. Two were later converted to O-2 standards, {{and one to}} the O-2C standard.|$|E
25|$|The Continental C90 and O-200 are {{a family}} of air-cooled, {{horizontally}} opposed, four-cylinder, <b>direct-drive</b> aircraft engines of 201 in³ (3.29 L) displacement, producing between 90 and 100 horsepower (67 and 75kW).|$|E
25|$|The Bo 207 is a wood construction, single-engined, {{cantilever}} low-wing cabin monoplane with {{a conventional}} landing gear with a tail wheel. The aircraft {{is powered by a}} Lycoming O-360 four-cylinder, <b>direct-drive,</b> horizontally opposed, air-cooled, piston engine.|$|E
25|$|The Lycoming O-360 is {{a family}} of four-cylinder, <b>direct-drive,</b> {{horizontally}} opposed, air-cooled, piston aircraft engines. Engines in the O-360 series produce between 145 and 225 horsepower (109 to 168kW), with the basic O-360 producing 180.|$|E
25|$|Most modern {{direct or}} {{indirect}} extrusion presses are hydraulically driven, {{but there are some}} small mechanical presses still used. Of the hydraulic presses there are two types: <b>direct-drive</b> oil presses and accumulator water drives.|$|E
25|$|MTorres {{initiated}} {{their activities}} in the Wing Energy field in 1998, with the launch of their newly developed Wind Turbine TWT-1.5/70, a 1500 KW variable-speed <b>direct-drive</b> multipole Wind Turbine with a full-power converter and a 70 meters rotor diameter.|$|E
25|$|<b>Direct-drive</b> oil presses are {{the most}} common because they are {{reliable}} and robust. They can deliver over 35 MPa (5000 psi). They supply a constant pressure throughout the whole billet. The disadvantage is that they are slow, between 50 and 200mm/s (2–8 ips).|$|E
25|$|Accumulator water drives {{are more}} {{expensive}} and larger than <b>direct-drive</b> oil presses, and they lose about 10% of their pressure over the stroke, but they are much faster, up to 380mm/s (15 ips). Because of this they are used when extruding steel. They are also used on materials that must be heated to very hot temperatures for safety reasons.|$|E
25|$|The Cheetah was {{developed}} from the earlier Lynx using the increased bore cylinders from the Armstrong Siddeley Panther but the engine retained the stroke of the Lynx. Initially only <b>direct-drive</b> variants were produced with later engines being made available with propeller reduction gear of various ratios. Superchargers were also available for later variants, both geared and directly driven by the crankshaft.|$|E
25|$|The penny-farthing is a <b>direct-drive</b> bicycle, {{meaning the}} cranks and pedals are fixed {{directly}} to the hub. Instead of using gears to multiply the revolutions of the pedals, the driven wheel is enlarged {{to be close to}} the rider's inseam, to increase the maximum speed. This shifts the rider nearly on top of the wheel and makes it impossible for the rider to reach the ground while sitting on the seat.|$|E
25|$|Persistent {{difficulties}} with the geared 200hp Hispano-Suiza 8B prompted {{development of the}} Dolphin Mk III, which used a <b>direct-drive</b> version of the 200hp engine. The Mk III first flew in October 1918 and went into production just as hostilities ended. Many existing Dolphins were also converted to Mk III standard at aircraft repair depots, by removing the reduction gearing and fitting a modified cowling to accommodate the resultant lowered thrust line.|$|E
25|$|In six-engined {{configuration}} the R-class zeppelins had single pusher {{engines in}} the rear of the front control gondola and two engine cars either side amidships, with a further three engines {{in the rear}} gondola. Of the rear gondola engines, one drove a pusher propeller direct at the rear of the gondola and two more in the centre of the gondola drove propellers, via gearboxes and transmission shafts, mounted on framework either side of the gondola. Five-engined R-class zeppelins omitted the rear gondola <b>direct-drive</b> centre engine.|$|E
25|$|The {{standard}} IBM CGA {{graphics card}} {{was equipped with}} 16kilobytes of video memory and could be connected either to a dedicated <b>direct-drive</b> CRT monitor using a 4-bit digital (TTL) RGBI interface, such as the IBM 5153 color display, or to an NTSC-compatible television or composite video monitor via an RCA connector. The RCA connector provided only baseband video, so to connect the CGA card to a standard television set required a separate RF modulator unless the TV had an RCA jack though with the former combined with an amplifier sometimes was more practical since one could then hook up an antenna to the amplifier and get wireless video.|$|E
25|$|With four <b>direct-drive</b> {{engines in}} a tandem {{push-pull}} arrangement, and a fully enclosed cockpit, the R.VI design required {{none of the}} complex gearboxes of other R-types. Each R.VI bomber cost 557,000 marks and required {{the support of a}} 50-man ground crew. The R.VI required a complex 18-wheel undercarriage consisting of twin nosewheels and a quartet of four-wheeled groupings for its main gear to support its weight, and carried two mechanics in flight, seated between the engines in open niches cut {{in the center of each}} nacelle. The bombs were carried in an internal bomb bay located under the central fuel tanks, with three racks each capable of holding seven bombs. The R.VI was capable of carrying the 1000kg PuW bomb.|$|E
25|$|The M-34 began {{development}} in 1928 {{as a replacement}} for the Mikulin M-17, a license-built copy of the BMW VI. It had similar dimensions and attachment points, but was otherwise an entirely new design. It was a <b>direct-drive,</b> block-type engine with the cylinder block connected by long internal studs with centrally coupled articulated connecting rods. The development of the engine process was prolonged, with the engineering drawings not completed until April 1931. The first engine was delivered to TsIAM (Tsentralniy Institut Aviatsionnogo Motorostroeniya, Russian: Центральный Институт Авиационного Моторостроения) on 21 September 1931 for bench testing with imported carburetors and magnetos. It began state testing in November 1931, but failed. It was submitted again a year later with Soviet-designed K-34 carburetors, but was again rejected. It was resubmitted in January 1933, but again failed. It was flight-tested in a Tupolev TB-3 in October 1933.|$|E
25|$|The {{first known}} {{electric}} locomotive {{was built in}} 1837 by chemist Robert Davidson of Aberdeen in Scotland, and it was powered by galvanic cells (batteries). Thus {{it was also the}} earliest battery electric locomotive. Davidson later built a larger locomotive named Galvani, exhibited at the Royal Scottish Society of Arts Exhibition in 1841. The seven-ton vehicle had two <b>direct-drive</b> reluctance motors, with fixed electromagnets acting on iron bars attached to a wooden cylinder on each axle, and simple commutators. It hauled a load of six tons at four miles per hour (6 kilometers per hour) for a distance of one and a half miles (2 kilometers). It was tested on the Edinburgh and Glasgow Railway in September of the following year, but the limited power from batteries prevented its general use. It was destroyed by railway workers, who saw it as a threat to their job security.|$|E
25|$|In 1972, Technics {{started making}} their SL-1200 {{turntable}}, {{which became the}} most popular turntable for DJs due to its high torque direct drive design. The SL-1200 had a rapid start and its durable direct drive enabled DJs to manipulate the platter, as with scratching techniques. Hip hop DJs began using the Technics SL-1200s as musical instruments to manipulate records with turntablism techniques such as scratching and beat juggling rather than merely mixing records. These techniques were developed in the 1970s by DJ Kool Herc, Grand Wizard Theodore, and Afrika Bambaataa, as they experimented with Technics <b>direct-drive</b> decks, finding that the motor would continue to spin at the correct RPM even if the DJ wiggled the record {{back and forth on}} the platter. Although Technics stopped producing the SL-1200 in 2010, they remain the most popular DJ turntable due to their high build quality and durability.|$|E
25|$|In {{the late}} 1930s Baldwin and the Pennsylvania Railroad made an all-in {{bet on the}} future of steam in {{passenger}} rail service with Baldwin's duplex-drive S1 locomotive. It proved difficult to operate, unreliable, costly to maintain, and unsuited for its intended service. Baldwin developed a revision of the same basic design with the T1, introduced in 1943. While the T1s were actually used for PRR's long distance express trains, they still had many of the problems of the S1. The whole S1-T1 venture resulted in losses for PRR and investment in a dead-end development effort for Baldwin at a critical time for both companies. In the early 1940s Baldwin embarked upon its efforts to develop steam turbine power, producing the S2 <b>direct-drive</b> turbine locomotive in 1944. Baldwin's steam turbine program failed to produce a single successful design. Baldwin's steam-centered development path had left them flat-footed in the efforts necessary to compete in the postwar diesel market dominated by EMD and ALCO-GE.|$|E
25|$|In 1906, Mauretania was {{launched}} by the Duchess of Roxburghe. At {{the time of her}} launch, she was the largest moving structure ever built, and slightly larger in gross tonnage than Lusitania. The main visual differences between Mauretania and Lusitania were that Mauretania was five feet longer and had different vents (Lusitania had oil drum-shaped vents, which proved fragile on winter runs and were eventually replaced with the cowl design vents of her sister ship). Mauretania also had two extra stages of turbine blades in her forward turbines, making her slightly faster than Lusitania. Mauretania and Lusitania were the only ships with <b>direct-drive</b> steam turbines to hold the Blue Riband; in later ships, reduction-geared turbines were mainly used. Mauretanias usage of the steam turbine was the largest application yet of the then-new technology, developed by Charles Algernon Parsons. During speed trials, these engines caused significant vibration at high speeds; in response, Mauretania received strengthening members aft and redesigned propellers before entering service, which reduced vibration.|$|E
25|$|Steam {{power was}} first used to {{supplement}} the fully developed hydropower sources in Lowell in the 1860s, and by the mid-1870s, it was the dominant energy source. Electricity allowed the mills to run on hydroelectricity, instead of <b>direct-drive</b> hydropower. These improvements allowed Lowell to continue increasing its industrial output with a lesser {{increase in the number}} of workers. However, the move away from pure hydropower was leading to Lowell being eclipsed by cities with better locations for the new power sources. For example, in the 50 years after the Civil War, Fall River, Massachusetts and New Bedford, Massachusetts both became larger factory towns than Lowell based on output. The reason was largely because their seaport locations made the importation and exportation of goods and materials, and particularly coal, more economical than the considerably inland, and therefore only accessible by train, Lowell. By 1920, it was being seriously suggested that the Merrimack be dredged from Newburyport to Lowell so that barges could access the city. However, the events of the 1920s ensured that would never happen.|$|E
25|$|Turntables allow DJs to play vinyl records. By {{adjusting}} the playback {{speed of the}} turntable, either by {{adjusting the}} speed knob, or by manipulating the platter (e.g., by slowing down the platter by putting a finger gently along the side), DJs can match the tempos of different records so their rhythms can be played together {{at the same time}} without clashing or make a smooth, seamless transition from one song to another. This technique is known as beatmatching. DJs typically replace the rubber mat on turntables that keeps the record moving in sync with the turntable with a slipmat that facilitates manipulating the playback of the record by hand. With the slipmat, the DJ can stop or slow down the record while the turntable is still spinning. <b>Direct-drive</b> turntables are the type preferred by DJs, with the Technics SL-1200 being the most popular model of turntables for DJs. Belt-drive turntables are less expensive, but they are not suitable for turntablism and DJing, because the belt-drive motor does not like being slowed down, as it can stretch out the belt. Some DJs, most commonly those who play hip hop music, go beyond merely mixing records and use turntables as musical instruments for scratching, beat juggling, and other turntablism techniques.|$|E
