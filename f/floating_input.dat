40|$|This thesis has {{developed}} an eﬃcient methodology for automatic kinematic analysis of planar linkages using the concept of modular kinematics. Unlike conventional general purpose kinematic analysis packages where each joint in the mechanism is represented using a set of non-linear constraint equations which need to be solved by some iterative numerical procedure, modular kinematics {{is based on the}} original observation by Assur that kinematic state of a mechanism involving large number of links can be constructed out of the kinematic states of patterns of sub chains called modules taken in a given sequence called module sequence which in turn emulates the step by step construction procedure of traditional graphical methods. The position, velocity and acceleration analysis of modules are available in closed form. Kinematic analysis of modules later in the sequence is enabled by those of the ones earlier in the sequence, hence, the kinematic analysis of a mechanism is accomplished without any iterative endeavor by doing the kinematics of the modules as given in the module sequence. [102] classiﬁed all modules into three fundamental types namely input, dyad and transformation and also introduced the concept of constraint module for analyzing graphically non-constructible mechanisms within the paradigm of modular kinematics where a small step of numerical search was needed in an over all closed form kinematic formulation. Module sequence for a mechanism using the modules is not unique. Choice of a later module in the sequence depends upon the selection of modules earlier in the sequence. This thesis has presented a systematic approach of identifying all such methods for all the inversions of the mechanism and represented {{in the form of a}} module hierarchy or a module tree where each path from root to the leaf node represents a valid module sequence for the kinematic chain in hand. The work also extended the set of modules by adding eight new modules to what has already been used in literature to make it complete in the sense that all planar mechanisms involving revolute, prismatic and pin-in-slot (including circular slots) can be handled. The computational eﬀort involved for analyzing these mechanisms thus depend on the number of constraint modules occurring in succession in the module sequence. However, maximum possible number of constraint modules in any mechanism with up to twelve links is only two. The derivative analysis also uses the same module sequence, but they are always devoid of any iterative steps. During the process of generation of a module sequence, at every stage multitude of modules could be identiﬁed for their potential placement in the sequence. But for every module sequence the diﬀerence between the number of input modules and that of constraint modules is constant and is equal to the kinematic degrees-of-freedom (d. o. f) of the mechanism. The algorithm presented in this thesis minimizes the number of generalized inputs (and hence extraneous constraints) and thus attempting to identify the simplest of the module sequences. In that sense the module sequences represented in the module tree are all optimal module sequences. The present work introduced the concept of multi phase modular kinematics which enables a large variety of mechanisms, conventionally identiﬁed as complex mechanisms, to be solved in closed form. This is achieved through the use of novel virtual link and virtual joints. Virtual link is slightly diﬀerent from a normal rigid link in the sense that the joint locations on this are functions of some independent parameters. Since, the locations of joints are not ﬁxed even in the local coordinate frame of the virtual link, the relative velocities between joints are not zero, they need to be appropriately accounted in kinematic analysis. The theory presented in the thesis is implemented in a computer program written in C++ on Windows platform and Graphics library (OpenGL) is used to display linkage conﬁgurations and simulations. The program takes the data of joints, input pairs, ground link in certain format through a ﬁle. Geometric models developed in any of the existing modeling softwares like ProE, Ideas, AutoCad etc. can be imported in VRML format to the links and in case of no geometric models a simple convex 2 D geometry is created for each link for the purpose of visualization. Geometric import of links helps not only in understanding the simulations better but also in useful for dynamic analysis, dynamic motion analysis and interference analysis. A complete kinematic analysis (position, velocity and acceleration) is given for a four bar mechanism and illustrated the positional (conﬁguration) analysis using modular kinematics for several other examples like old-ham, quick-return mechanisms etc. in the current work. Multi-phase modular approach is illustrated using a ﬁve bar with <b>ﬂoating</b> <b>input</b> pairs, a back actor and a drafter mechanism and the Back actor conﬁguration is shown with the imported link geometries. It is observed in practice that there are many apparently spatial Mechanisms, which are constructed out of symmetric dispositions of planar mechanisms in space. A pseudo spatial mechanism concept is proposed to solve this class of spatial mechanisms, which can actually be analyzed with the eﬀort of solving only one such component. This concept is illustrated with Shaker and Umbrella mechanisms. Possible extensions of the concept for modeling and analysis of more general class of pseudo-spatial mechanisms are also indicated...|$|E

A new program execution based approach to automated test data generation using iterative relaxation methods has been developed.

New algorithms to generate test data for statement, branch, data flow and path coverage have been developed. They are general in their applicability as they can generate test data for programs with branch predicates that compute linear and nonlinear functions of input. They can detect linear infeasible paths and can handle programs using arrays, records, pointers and loops.

40|$|The {{classical}} {{approach for}} signal conditioning individual resistance strain gages is to connect each installed gage with three lead wires {{to a set}} of three fixed completion resistors, all arranged electrically in a Wheatstone bridge circuit. An alternative approach for strain gage signal conditioning, sometimes called the Anderson loop, was developed at NASA's Dryden Flight Research Center. 1 This technique offers some significant advantages when used with the strain gage rosettes employed in experimental stress analysis. Invented 2 to eliminate the measurement uncertainties due to random electrical impedance variations in lead wires and connections found in harsh test environments, NASA's loop circuit approach delivers twice the equivalent bridge output level, and simplifies wiring, temperature compensation and data analysis as well. Circuitry The enabling technology for this technique is the dual-differential subtractor measurement circuit function defined in Fig. 1. As illustrated in eq. 1, a subtractor's output is the difference between two independent <b>floating</b> differential <b>inputs.</b> vout = A 1 v 1 – A 2 v 2 (1) The subtractor's two differential input voltages, v 1 and v 2, are processed by amplification factors A 1 and A 2, respectively, to yield an output voltage, vout. In a strain rosette application, amplification factors A 1 and A 2 are typically set to unity. Noise voltages rejected by this ideal subtractor arrangement include: all identical noise voltage components at the two inputs, the common-mode voltages, vcm 1 and vcm 2 at each differential input, and the interior-mode voltage, vim. Practical subtractors can be designed to operate with sub-microvolt stability and essentially no energy transfer with the strain gage circuitry they observe.

This approach {{is compatible with}} modern digital CMOS technologies and is readily extended to novel circuit applications. We highlight advantages of the technique by applying it {{to the design of}} an adaptive floating gate comparator (AFGC). This is the first use of this technique for adaptation in a nonlinear circuit. The AFGC computes appropriate voltages for locally adapting the <b>input</b> <b>floating</b> gate nodes to cancel offsets. The technique is amenable to both local and nonlocal adaptation which allows greater design flexibility. The AFGC has been fabricated in a commercially available 0. 35 µm CMOS process.

40|$|This release {{had large}} {{contributions}} from Eric Larson, Brendan Moloney, Nolan Nichols, Basile Pinsard, Chris Johnson and Nikolaas N. Oosterhof. 	New feature, bugfix release with minor API breakage; 	Minor API breakage: default write of NIfTI / Analyze image data offset value. The data offset {{is the number}} of bytes from the beginning of file to skip before reading the image data. Nibabel behavior changed from keeping the value as read from file, to setting the offset to zero on read, and setting the offset when writing the header. The value of the offset will now be the minimum value necessary {{to make room for the}} header and any extensions when writing the file. You can override the default offset by setting value explicitly to some value other than zero. To read the original data offset as read from the header, use the offset property of the image dataobj attribute; 	Minor API breakage: data scaling in NIfTI / Analyze now set to NaN when reading images. Data scaling refers to the data intercept and slope values in the NIfTI / Analyze header. To read the original data scaling you need to look at the slope and inter properties of the image dataobj attribute. You can set scaling explicitly by setting the slope and intercept values in the header to values other than NaN; 	New API for managing image caching; images have an in_memory property that is true if the image data has been loaded into cache, or is already an array in memory; get_data has new keyword argument caching to specify whether the cache should be filled by get_data; 	Images now have properties dataobj, affine, header. We will slowly phase out the get_affine and get_header image methods; 	The image dataobj can be sliced using an efficient algorithm to avoid reading unnecessary data from disk. This makes it possible to do very efficient reads of single volumes from a time series; 	NIfTI 2 read / write support; 	Read support for MINC 2; 	Much extended read support for PAR / REC, largely due to work from Eric Larson and Gregory R. Lee on new code, advice and code review. Thanks also to Jeff Stevenson and Bennett Landman for helpful discussion; 	parrec 2 nii script outputs images in LAS voxel orientation, which appears to be necessary for compatibility with FSL dtifit / fslview diffusion analysis pipeline; 	Preliminary support for Philips multiframe DICOM images (thanks to Nolan Nichols, Ly Nguyen and Brendan Moloney); 	New function to save Freesurfer annotation files (by Github user ohinds); 	Method to return MGH format vox 2 ras_tkr affine (Eric Larson); 	A new API for reading unscaled data from NIfTI and other images, using img. dataobj. get_unscaled(). Deprecate previous way of doing this, which was to read data with the read_img_data function; 	Fix for bug when replacing NaN values with zero when writing floating point data as integers. If the <b>input</b> <b>floating</b> point data range did not include zero, then NaN would not get written to a value corresponding to zero in the output; 	Improvements and bug fixes to image orientation calculation and DICOM wrappers by Brendan Moloney; 	Bug fixes writing GIfTI files. We were using a base 64 encoding that didn't match the spec, and the wrong field name for the endian code. Thanks to Basile Pinsard and Russ Poldrack for diagnosis and fixes; 	Bug fix in freesurfer. read_annot with orig_ids=False when annot contains vertices with no label (Alexandre Gramfort); 	More tutorials in the documentation, including introductory tutorial on DICOM, and on coordinate systems; 	Lots of code refactoring, including moving to common code-base for Python 2 and Python 3; 	New mechanism to add images for tests via git submodules...|$|R
