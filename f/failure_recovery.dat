40|$|Despite a {{proliferation}} {{of a number of}} studies on service <b>failures</b> and <b>recovery</b> in e-service settings, there is a paucity of knowledge of ways in which service <b>failures</b> and <b>recovery</b> practices are implemented in the fashion industry. Drawing on constructivist perspective, this study offers a new perspective on an effective relational mechanism that would bridge the rupture between consumers and companies particularly in the on-line fashion sector. The analysis adds to studies on service <b>failures</b> and <b>recovery</b> by elucidating recovery strategies relevant to retailers’ operations in on-line environments. This analysis advances knowledge of on-line service <b>failures</b> and <b>recovery</b> in the UK fashion industry. Findings indicate that consumer expectations of service <b>failures</b> and <b>recovery</b> are context driven, which requires companies to fine-tune their recovery strategies to improve recovery satisfaction...|$|R

40|$|To date, {{researchers}} have largely considered service <b>failure</b> and <b>recovery</b> {{as a combination}} of individual constructs, often in isolation, rather than viewing <b>failure</b> and <b>recovery</b> holistically. Consequently, our understanding is fragmented. Furthermore, while some attempt {{has been made to}} gain a better understanding of service <b>failure</b> and <b>recovery</b> from both the customer and the employee’s perspective (cf. Bitner et al. 1990; McColl-Kennedy and Sparks 2003), no study has employed an interpretative perspective that potentially offers a rich, in-depth approach to this important area of research. Given this gap, our paper presents the value of taking a customer-based interpretive approach to obtaining a fuller understanding of the way customers view service <b>failure</b> and <b>recovery.</b> In this paper we report the findings of our phenomenography study of twenty in-depth interviews. Not only do we argue the benefits of adopting this fresh approach to studying service <b>failure</b> and <b>recovery,</b> we also present an innovative conceptual framework derived from our phenomenographic research findings, which has significant theoretical and practical implications...|$|R

40|$|In {{the last}} few years it has been {{advocated}} the need for systems that adapt automatically to changes in their environment.

If SRG diversity is not achieved then the failure of that SRG fails both primary path and back-up paths simultaneously. Therefore, the two calculated paths must be SRG diverse.|$|E

40|$|Abstract—Smart energy grid is an {{emerging}} area for new applications of machine learning in a non-stationary environ-ment. Such a non-stationary environment emerges when large-scale failures occur at power distribution networks due to external disturbances such as hurricanes and severe storms. Power distribution networks {{lie at the}} edge of the grid, and are especially vulnerable to external disruptions. Quantifiable approaches are lacking and needed to learn non-stationary behaviors of large-scale <b>failure</b> and <b>recovery</b> of power distri-bution. This work studies such non-stationary behaviors in three aspects. First, a novel formulation is derived for an entire life cycle of large-scale <b>failure</b> and <b>recovery</b> of power distribution. Second, spatial-temporal models of <b>failure</b> and <b>recovery</b> of power distribution are developed as geo-location based multivariate non-stationary GI(t) /G(t) / ∞ queues. Third, the non-stationary spatial-temporal models identify a small number of parameters to be learned. Learning is applied to two real-life examples of large-scale disruptions. One is from Hurricane Ike, where data from an operational network is exact on <b>failures</b> and <b>recoveries.</b> The other is from Hurricane Sandy, where aggregated data is used for inferring <b>failure</b> and <b>recovery</b> processes at one of the impacted areas.

40|$|Abstract—Resilience {{of power}} {{distribution}} is {{pertinent to the}} energy grid under severe weather. This work develops an ana-lytical formulation for large-scale <b>failure</b> and <b>recovery</b> of power distribution induced by severe weather. A focus is on incorporat-ing pertinent characteristics of topological network structures into spatial temporal modeling. Such characteristics are new notations as dynamic failure- and recovery-neighborhoods. The neighborhoods quantify correlated <b>failures</b> and <b>recoveries</b> due to topology and types of components in power distribution. The resulting model is a multi-scale non-stationary spatial temporal random process. Dynamic resilience is then defined based on the model. Using the model and large-scale real data from Hurricane Ike, unique characteristics are identified: The failures follow the 80 / 20 rule where 74. 3 % of the total failures result from 20. 7 % of failure neighborhoods with up to 72 components “failed” together. Thus the hurricane caused {{a large number of}} correlated failures. Unlike the <b>failures,</b> the <b>recoveries</b> follow 60 / 90 rule: 59. 3 % of recoveries resulted from 92. 7 % of all neighborhoods where either one component alone or two together recovered. Thus about 60 % recoveries were uncorrelated and required individual restorations. The <b>failure</b> and <b>recovery</b> processes are further studied through the resilience metric to identify the least resilient regions and time durations. I...|$|R

Our approach also addresses delivery ordering issues that arise when multiple clients communicate with a process group concurrently, or a single client transmits multiple multicast messages to a group without pausing to wait until each is received.
