25|$|A {{bifold door}} is {{a unit that}} has several sections, folding in pairs. Wood {{is the most common}} material, and doors may also be metal or glass. Bifolds are most {{commonly}} made for closets, but may also be used as units between rooms. Bi-fold doors are essentially now doors that let the outside in. They open in concert; where the panels fold up against one another and are pushed together when opened. The main <b>door</b> <b>panel</b> (often known as the traffic door) is accompanied by a stack of panels that fold very neatly against one another when opened fully, which almost look like room dividers.|$|E
25|$|The 1974 Rambler American was a carryover. The only {{difference}} was {{the presence of}} the rear five-mile-per-hour bumper and the rear license plate was relocated {{to the center of the}} rear panel over the gas filler. The standard wheels for the year were VAM's new 14x6-inch five-spoke design with volcano hubcaps. The 258 six included an evaporative canister to reduce emissions, and a slightly lower 8.3:1 compression ratio. However, during the mid-year, the compression ratio was lowered even more to 7.6:1. In both cases, the engines were still advertised as having an output of 170hp. The seat and <b>door</b> <b>panel</b> designs were revised. The parking brake pedal received a new smaller rubber pad.|$|E
500|$|For the Lexus LS, the Tahara plant {{developed}} new molds {{and enhanced}} assembly techniques and instituted measures aimed at increasing {{the precision of}} the sedan's fit and finish. The 1989 LS 400 became the first production automobile to receive extensive laser welding, allowing for seamless steel welds. A large sheet metal press was developed to reduce or eliminate panel gaps by stamping large sections whole instead of singly. Separately installed parts, such as exterior lights, were also spring-loaded for a tighter fit. On the LS 400, engineers reduced <b>door</b> <b>panel</b> gaps in half versus Toyota-brand vehicles, from , with measurements made within on the LS 430, measurement margins were increased tenfold, to [...] When production switched to the LS 460, the number of laser welds was doubled.|$|E
40|$|This thesis {{work has}} been {{conducted}} at International Automotive Components Group in Torslanda, Sweden. The company produces <b>door</b> <b>panels,</b> instrument panels, consoles and cockpits for the automotive industry. During the production of <b>door</b> <b>panels,</b> defects such as pressure marks and scratches emerge which results in scrap and rework. The objective of the thesis work was to identify the causes of pressure marks and scratches and also to suggest measures {{to reduce the amount}} of scrap and rework on <b>door</b> <b>panels.</b> Through observations, interviews and experiments, several causes leading to pressure marks and scratches on <b>door</b> <b>panels</b> were identified. Small pieces of plastics on fixtures, the operator's rough handling and specific process steps are the main causes that result in pressure marks and scratches. Pressure marks and scratches emerge at several places on the <b>door</b> <b>panels</b> during the production. To reduce the amount of pressure marks and scratches both short-term and long-term measures were suggested. Some of the measures are:  Use vacuum cleaners at some stations  Add padding on unpadded areas and edges  Make new instructions that emphasize to keep production stations clean and to avoid rough handling  Introduce workshops to engage operator...|$|R

Barisano da Trani also made relief <b>door</b> <b>panels</b> for churches in Astrano and in Ravello on the Amalfi Coast.|$|R
2500|$|The {{interior}} for 1970 {{was also}} a one-year design featuring a broad dashboard (wood grained on SST models), new center console, revised interior <b>door</b> <b>panel</b> trim, and tall [...] "clamshell" [...] bucket seats with integral headrests available in vinyl, corduroy, or optional leather upholstery. A new two-spoke steering wheel was available with a [...] "Rim Blow" [...] horn.|$|E
2500|$|Inside, a new flat {{instrument}} panel (shared with LeSabre, Estate Wagon and Riviera) with horizontal sweep speedometer (silver facing with black lettering) replaced the wrap-around cockpit dash of previous years and <b>door</b> <b>panel</b> trim was revised.

2500|$|For 1992 the Century {{received}} another slight facelift {{featuring a}} bigger radiator grille and different headlamps. Also the interior received new door panels moving the window switches and door lock switches {{into a more}} convenient configuration found on more modern cars, where the switch location corresponds with the window location in the car body. Interestingly this feature never appeared on its sibling the Oldsmobile Ciera, which retained the inline switch bank mounted flush with the <b>door</b> <b>panel,</b> the rear switch being the drivers door window. Another interesting note is that the Century windows switches were not backlit, but lit by a small bulb in the <b>door</b> <b>panel</b> trim above the switch bank. Other interior changes included new seat covers, and relocating the front outboard seat belts from the A pillar into the door, functioning as [...] "automatic" [...] seat belts so that the belts could be buckled and {{the door opened and}} closed while still buckled. The driver and front passenger could enter and exit the vehicle while the seat belt was still fastened.|$|E
2500|$|With the Impala {{no longer}} being produced, a new base Caprice four-door model was {{introduced}} (similar to the previous Impala). Still available was a four-door sedan, coupe and eight-passenger station wagon, while a new Brougham four-door sedan joined the model line-up. Brougham models featured a 55/45 front seat with armrest, and a new [...] "pillow design" [...] with velour fabrics. Broughams featured woodgrain appliqué on its dash fascia, a dome map light, front-door courtesy lights and 20oz carpeting. Power window controls for all models moved from the <b>door</b> <b>panel</b> to the armrest for improved ergonomics.|$|E
2500|$|The Eighty Eight {{was given}} a mild {{facelift}} in 1990, eschewing the former chromed grille for a body-colored fascia with four slots and the Oldsmobile Rocket logo. [...] In the rear, new taillights and backup lights extended across the body; once again, chrome trim was deleted. Minor revisions were also made to the interior. Part of the <b>door</b> <b>panel</b> was revised and 1990 also offered new cloth for the seats. The Pillow Cushion seats on the Brougham were deleted. A revised armrest console was also added, this one provided more room. As an option was a revised electronic climate control system. A new choice of alloy wheels was an option.|$|E

25|$|The {{seats and}} <b>door</b> <b>panels</b> were also redesigned. The new <b>door</b> <b>panels</b> {{contained}} integrated armrests, with the controls {{for the power}} windows and locks mounted flat on its frontal part, allowing the driver to operate them without moving their arm. These switches, along {{with all of the}} main controls, would become illuminated when the headlights were turned on, allowing the driver to easily see them at night.|$|R
50|$|The 1972 {{models were}} {{very similar to the}} 1971 models, with the only change being the rear view mirror was glued to the {{windshield}} rather than bolted to top of the cab, and metal or vinyl-covered flat <b>door</b> <b>panels</b> were no longer available; all trim level <b>door</b> <b>panels</b> were molded plastic with integral armrests and wood grain inserts on Cheyenne and Sierra trim levels. For restoration, {{it should also be noted}} that the door and window cranks were slightly longer due to the molded plastic <b>door</b> <b>panels,</b> and the vent windows were now secured with a single screw on the inside of the door, thus differentiating it from the 1971 model year.|$|R

2500|$|The DIN 18101 {{standard}} has {{a normative}} size (Nennmaß) {{slightly larger than}} the panel size (Türblatt) as the standard derives the panel sizes from the normative size being different single door vs double door and molded vs unmolded doors. The DIN 18101/1985 defines interior single molded doors to have a common panel height of 1985mm (normativ height 2010mm) at panel widths of 610mm, 735mm, 860mm, 985mm, 1110mm, plus a larger <b>door</b> <b>panel</b> size of 1110mm x 2110mm. The newer DIN 18101/2014 drops the definition of just five standard door sizes {{in favor of a}} basic raster running along 125mm increments where the height and width are independent. The panel width may be in the range 485mm to 1360 mmm, and the height may be in the range of 1610mm to 2735mm. The most common interior door is 860mm x 1985mm (33.8" [...] x 78.1").|$|E
2500|$|In 1989 and 1990, a new {{trim level}} to the Electra was offered: the Park Avenue Ultra. The Ultra was {{essentially}} an upgrade to the Electra Park Avenue line, and featured a standard leather trimmed interior with dual 20-way electric front seats (shared with Cadillac's restyled 1989 Sixty Special), lower-body accent exterior paint treatment, distinctive thick-padded vinyl top with limousine-style rear-window surround (available only on Ultra), simulated burled elm trim on the doors and instrument panel, unique aluminum wheels, anti-lock brakes, chromed B-pillar moldings, specific grille and tail lamps, leather-wrapped steering wheel, electronic instrumentation, padded glove-compartment door, unique interior <b>door</b> <b>panel</b> trim, {{and a variety of}} otherwise minor changes.
