500|$|Eventually, Stanton's oppositional rhetoric took {{on racial}} overtones. Arguing {{on behalf of}} female suffrage, Stanton posited that women voters of [...] "wealth, education, and refinement" [...] were needed to offset the effect of former slaves and {{immigrants}} whose [...] "pauperism, ignorance, and degradation" [...] might negatively affect the American political system. She declared it to be [...] "a serious question whether we had better stand aside and see 'Sambo' walk into the kingdom [...] first." [...] Some scholars have argued that Stanton's emphasis on property ownership and education, opposition to black male suffrage, and desire to hold out for universal suffrage fragmented {{the civil rights movement}} by pitting African-American men against women and, together with Stanton's emphasis on [...] "educated suffrage," [...] in part <b>established</b> <b>a</b> <b>basis</b> <b>for</b> the literacy requirements that followed {{in the wake of the}} passage of the Fifteenth Amendment.|$|E

Ehlers, a specialist on recent polychaetes, recorded them from the Jurassic Solenhofen Stone of Bavaria, Germany, demonstrating their affinity and proposing the generic names Eunicites and Lumbriconereites.

40|$|Lacustrine ostracodes {{have been}} studied {{during the last three}} decades because of their {{apparent}} utility in reconstructing aquatic paleoenvironments. These microcrustaceans are ideal for paleoenvironmental analysis because: 1) they are cosmopolitan and abundant lacustrine inhabitants; 2) they show high diversity; 3) they are sensitive to climate- related limnological variations; 4) their valves incorporate some trace elements from host waters that may oxygen isotope equilibruiun with the host water.
