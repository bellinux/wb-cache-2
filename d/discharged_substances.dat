40|$|Proceedings of the 1995 Georgia Water Resources Conference, April 11 and 12, 1995, Athens, Georgia. Discharges into highly {{unsteady}} flows, such as tidal waters, create {{special problems}} for assessing their environmental impact and compliance with mixing zone regulations. Exposures to toxic materials {{at the edges}} of the mixing zone are highly intermittent, and time series of contaminant concentrations would be expected to contain extended periods of zeros. The time-average value of such a time series is likely to have little ecological significance, despite the use of time-averaged values in regulatory requirements. At the same time that environmental regulations have become increasingly strict, the capability and instrumentation for measurement of physical parameters in coastal and estuarine waters has increased dramatically. This has placed new demands on the abilities of mathematical models to use these data to predict the behavior of <b>discharged</b> <b>substances.</b> In this paper, we present the results of detailed modeling of the behavior of sewage discharged into coastal waters. The models use data measured from Acoustic Doppler Current Profilers (ADCPs) and thermistor strings directly. The ADCPs measure water velocity over the whole water column, and the thermistor strings measure temperature, and hence density, over the water column. These instruments provide vastly more data than has been previously possible. The data are used to compute environmental exposures around the outfall, including the "visitation frequency" of the plume at any location. Sponsored and Organized by: U. S.

Without {{the implementation of a}} cooperative and harmonized monitoring approach and organizational guidelines, the reduction of diffuse <b>substance</b> <b>discharges</b> will not be verifiable.

Suitable monitoring concepts are available in the German Federal Republic and its Federal States, nevertheless, a political impulse for their implementation is missing.|$|R
40|$|AbstractThe {{offshore}} {{oil and gas}} industry will use and discharge large quantities of chemicals into the marine environment during operational activities, with some of those chemicals considered hazardous. Chemical substitution, as part of the environmental regulatory regime, has been advocated as a simple and effective tool to reduce inputs of hazardous substances to the environment. In 2007 the UK National Plan was introduced, to prioritise into four groups and subsequently phase out in stages the most hazardous <b>substances</b> used and <b>discharged</b> during {{offshore oil}} and gas operations. Level 1 substances categorised for phase out in 2010 were virtually eliminated from discharge between 2006 and 2012 and there was a significant decline in <b>discharge</b> of <b>substances</b> at Level 2 to 4 over the same period. The <b>discharge</b> of substitutable <b>substances</b> had been reduced to less than 5 tonnes at most production installations by 2012. More than 91 % of this discharge is contributed by corrosion inhibitor, scale inhibitor, demulsifier and water clarifier formulations. The discharge of corrosion inhibitors accounted for the largest contribution to UK National Plan Level 2 substitutable <b>substance</b> <b>discharges,</b> and they appear to be the type of product with the fewest options found for substitution. This implies that a finite <b>discharge</b> of <b>substances</b> from these groups will continue to require formal justification beyond the target date, as occurred for Level 1 substances after the 2010 target date. The overall figures for substitutable <b>substance</b> <b>discharges</b> from 2006 to 2012 suggest that the introduction of the UK National plan with prioritisation of substances for substitution and ongoing encouragement of operators and, indirectly, suppliers to work towards reduction goals for substitutable substances is resulting in a reduction in discharges and contributing to their ultimate phase out. The next few years will be particularly challenging as the deadline for the phase-out of <b>discharges</b> of substitutable <b>substances</b> included in OSPAR Recommendation, 2006 / 3 is 1 January 2017 and, in addition, by 2018 all chemical substances used offshore will need to have been registered under the EC REACH Regulation. The approach described in this paper illustrates the benefits of a prioritised strategy for chemical substitution and an ongoing dialogue between the industry and regulator. A continuing case by case dialogue with offshore operators and suppliers will be essential to ensure that alternative technical solutions are trialled and options for substitution are investigated at the earliest stage...|$|R
30|$|Background, aim {{and scope}} In 2007, the German {{government}} approved a national strategy on biological diversity.

Reducing these diffuse <b>substance</b> <b>discharges</b> to long-term ecologically compatible levels {{is one of the main}} action targets.

40|$|The "VacuSIP ” is a {{simplification}} of the SIP system {{developed by}} Yahel et al. (2007), {{and it is}} considerably cheaper and adapted for SCUBA base work. The system was originally designed after Wright and Stephens (1978) and Riisgård (1991) for direct in situ sampling of the rates and efficiencies by which suspension feeders remove (or <b>discharge)</b> <b>substances</b> from (to) the water they filter. Nevertheless, VacuSIPs can be used wherever a controlled and clean, point-source water sample is required. A simple valve operation or needle piercing by a SCUBA diver allows the external water pressure to force the sampled water into an evacuated sample container. The small ID of the tubing (usually 20 - 50 μm PEEK) insures controlled suction rate during the sampling (see below) and a negligible dead volume. Fig. 1. A pair of VacuSIPs is used for simultaneous sampling of the water inhaled and exhaled by a solitary ascidian (Micrcosmus exasperatus). East Mediterranean, 10 m depth. For in situ sampling of suspension feeders metabolism, the pumping activity of each specimen sampled is first visualized by releasing fluorescein dyed seawater next to the inhalant orifice(s) and then observing it flow from the excurrent (e. g.

40|$|The Toxics Release Inventory (TRI) is {{the most}} {{comprehensive}} and widely reported information on hazardous discharges to the environment in the United States. Unfortunately, the fledgling nature of the TRI may lead to simplistic interpretations of the results. In particular, TRI summaries typically report total releases of toxic chemicals by weight, implicitly assuming that a <b>discharge</b> of <b>substance</b> A is equivalent to an equal weight <b>discharge</b> of <b>substance</b> B. In contrast, various indices of the toxicity to humans of the chemicals reported in the Inventory indicate that the most harmful are more than 1, 000, 000 times more toxic than the least harmful. Thus, the simple rankings and time trends of facilities, industries, counties, and states as sources of toxic releases can be misleading because they have neglected relevant toxicological data. We contrast the one-to-one ranking of the TRI data with a ranking based on relative toxicity, using ”threshold limit value ” (TLV) indices. The weighting scheme presented here is a useful first step for correcting the TRI but is certainly not definitive.
