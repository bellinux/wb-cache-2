5|$|For the {{commemorative}} ceremony on the 25th {{anniversary of the}} massacre in 2014, the city of Montreal entrusted the technical aspect of the ceremony to the multimedia production company Moment Factory, who installed fourteen searchlights representing the 14 victims of the massacre on the esplanade of Mount Royal. The light beams turned skyward first appeared shortly after four o'clock, the <b>hour</b> <b>when</b> the attack had started 25 years earlier.|$|E
5|$|In July 1985, Roberts won {{the pole}} {{position}} at the prestigious Suzuka 8 Hours endurance race, held in Japan. Teamed with Tadahiko Taira, the duo were leading the race until the final <b>hour,</b> <b>when</b> mechanical problems dropped them back to seventeenth place. Roberts returned {{to compete in the}} 1986 Suzuka 8 Hours, this time teaming up with American Mike Baldwin. He qualified second behind Wayne Gardner, but failed to finish the race.|$|E
5|$|McCudden {{remained}} in England until July 1918 {{when he was}} given command of No. 60 Squadron RAF. He flew to Farnborough in a Vickers F.B.16 to collect his new Royal Aircraft Factory S.E.5a before returning to France to lead his new Squadron. On 3 July he flew back in this fighter and over his home in Kingston upon Thames, taking the aircraft to 17,000 feet and circling London for an <b>hour.</b> <b>When</b> he landed he made his last entry into his log book. His total flying time had reached 872 hours and 40 minutes.|$|E

5000|$|The {{player was}} criticized for its low battery {{performance}} and lack of DRM playback facilities. The battery playback on the device is stated at 3 and a half <b>hours</b> <b>when</b> watching video or 10 <b>hours</b> <b>when</b> listening to music.|$|R
5|$|Each side then {{attempted}} to rush all available pilots into the system, and the game's time dilation software engaged. Time dilation {{is a game}} feature created by developer CCP Games to handle heavy loads on the game server without the game lagging or disconnecting players. In time dilation, the game slows to ten percent normal speed, with each second of game time displaying as ten seconds of real time. The two sides traded Titan kills every <b>hour,</b> <b>when</b> their Doomsday weapons could fire again, and the system became filled with warp disruption bubbles, making extraction difficult. For a while neither side gained any real advantage, though CFC/Rus managed to on-line their Territorial Control Units and held a slight lead {{in the number of}} enemy Titans destroyed. Throughout the engagement, related battles played out across the entire game universe as fleets tried to block reinforcements, destroy fleeing capitals and super-capitals, or trap pilots attempting to enter the fray.|$|E
5|$|In {{the last}} 16 of the competition, Luton faced Ipswich Town of the Second Division. Without several senior players because of ineligibility and injury, Luton scored early through Brian Stein's strike, and then {{produced}} a solid defensive performance, reliant on goalkeeper Les Sealey {{to earn a}} place in the quarter-finals. The result marked Ipswich's first defeat of the season, having earlier recorded 10 wins and two draws at Portman Road. Luton hosted Bradford City in the fifth round of the competition on 19 January 1988. A mistake by Bradford goalkeeper Paul Tomlinson handed Luton the lead four minutes before the <b>hour,</b> <b>when</b> he gave away a free kick for handling the ball in his area. A shot from Danny Wilson in the 65th minute resulted in Luton's second goal; though his effort was saved by Tomlinson, the goalkeeper could not fend off the advancing Harford's header.|$|E
5|$|Next in the line, to the north, was Quinn's Post, {{defended by}} the 15th Battalion and the 2nd Light Horse Regiment. For {{some time after}} the start of the Turkish attack, the Turks {{opposite}} Quinn's just threw hand grenades at the post. Around 03:30 the Turks' machine-guns and rifles opened fire at the Australians. This lasted for about an <b>hour</b> <b>when</b> the Turks went over the top and assaulted the post. As elsewhere, they were stopped by the weight of the Australian fire, not only from the trench they were attacking, but also by the defenders at Pope's and from the 2nd New Zealand Artillery Battery. Three more Turkish attacks were also repulsed in a similar fashion.|$|E
50|$|Elimination: Pentamidine has {{an average}} {{half-life}} of 5-8 <b>hours</b> <b>when</b> given intravenously and 7-11 <b>hours</b> <b>when</b> given intramuscularly. However, these may increase with severe kidney problems. Pentamidine can {{remain in the}} system {{for as long as}} 8 months after the first injection.|$|R
2500|$|Carbamazepine is {{relatively}} slowly but well absorbed after oral administration. Its plasma half-life is about 30 <b>hours</b> <b>when</b> it is given as single dose, {{but it is}} a strong inducer of hepatic enzymes and the plasma half-life shortens to about 15 <b>hours</b> <b>when</b> it is given repeatedly.|$|R
30|$|As it {{is shown}} by Table[*] 3, the two {{traditional}} constructions present a small increase in the interval of hours of comfort (18 °C>T> 30 °C), and the maximal temperature is less than that obtained for the other cases. On the other hand, the minimal temperature is higher compared to the first case. For WD house, the average interval of the <b>hours</b> <b>when</b> T> 34 °C has decreased from 2.03 % to 0.98 %, {{and there is a}} slight increase of percentage of <b>hours</b> <b>when</b> 30 °C>T> 32 °C from 6.96 % to 7.02 %. The average percentage of the <b>hours</b> <b>when</b> T> 15 °C has not changed. However, we notice an increase in number of the <b>hours</b> <b>when</b> temperature is 15 °C>T> 30 °C from 12.94 % to 14.25 %.|$|R
5|$|The Staffords' first radio {{appearance}} was on Los Angeles station KHJ {{as part of}} The Happy Go Lucky <b>Hour</b> <b>when</b> Jo was 16, a role they secured after hopefuls at the audition {{were asked if they}} had their own musical accompanist(s). Christine Stafford said that Jo played piano, and the sisters were hired, even though she had not previously given a public piano performance. The Staffords were subsequently heard on KNX's The Singing Crockett Family of Kentucky, and California Melodies, a network radio show aired on the Mutual Broadcasting System. While Stafford worked on The Jack Oakie Show she met John Huddlestona backing singer on the programmeand they were married in October 1937. The couple divorced in 1943.|$|E
5|$|The first {{shots were}} fired at 12:30 by Persanne close to the island of Pelagosa (Palagruža), but the main action did not begin for another <b>hour,</b> <b>when</b> Alceste and Pomone {{exchanged}} shots from their stern and bow guns. By 13:40, Alceste was firing her broadside into Pomone and simultaneously pressing on all sail {{in an effort to}} reach Pauline, but this ambition was thwarted when a shot from Pomone brought down Alcestes main topmast, slowing her suddenly and allowing Pauline to pull a little ahead. At 14:00, Active had arrived in action and was also firing into Pomone, forcing Montfort to bring Pauline round to protect her outgunned colleague. By 14:20 the conflicts between Active and Pomone and Alceste and Pauline had separated into different duels, Pomone particularly suffering severely but Active also taking heavy damage, a 32-pounder carronade shot severing Captain Gordon's leg {{at the height of the}} engagement.|$|E
5|$|The Simpson Family Smile-Time Variety Hour is {{a parody}} of the 1960s and 1970s live variety shows. Mainly it is {{a parody of}} The Brady Bunch Hour, a {{short-lived}} spin-off of the 1970s sitcom The Brady Bunch. The replacement of Lisa in the third segment with another girl reflects the recasting of Jan Brady in the Brady Bunch <b>Hour</b> <b>when</b> Eve Plumb refused to participate. The Simpson family is {{made to look like}} The Partridge Family. Also, the segment holds numerous references to Laugh-In. Kent Brockman introduces the show from inside a broadcast booth in a style similar to Laugh-In, there is a joke wall similar to the one in Laugh-In where The Sea Captain opens a porthole. There is also a Laugh-In-like montage wherein other characters comment on the skit itself. When Hans Moleman reads a poem, it is based on Henry Gibson reading a poem on Laugh-In. Other shows parodied during the variety show include The Sonny and Cher Comedy Hour, and The Smothers Brothers Comedy Hour.|$|E
