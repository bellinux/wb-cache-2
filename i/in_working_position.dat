40|$|Introduction Factors such as {{prolonged}} {{sitting at}} work or improper posture of head during work may have a great role in neck pain occurrence among office employees, particularly among {{those who work with}} computers. Although some studies claim a significant difference in head posture between patients and pain-free participants, in literature the forward head posture (FHP) has not always been associated with neck pain. Since head, cervical and thoracic postures and their relation with neck pain has not been studied in Iranian office employees, {{the purpose of this study}} was to investigate the relationship between some work-related and individual factors, such as poor posture, with neck pain in the office employees. Material and methods It was a cross-sectional correlation study carried out to explore the relationship between neck pain and sagittal postures of cervical and thoracic spine among office employees in forward looking position and also in a working position. Forty-six subjects without neck pain and 55 with neck pain were examined using a photographic method. Thoracic and cervical postures were measured using the high thoracic (HT) and craniovertebral (CV) angles, respectively. Results High thoracic and CV angles were positively correlated with the presence of neck pain only <b>in</b> <b>working</b> <b>position</b> (p 0. 05). Conclusions Our findings have revealed that office employees had a defective posture while working and that the improper posture was more severe in the office employees who suffered from the neck pain...|$|E
40|$|This paper {{presents}} a constructive solution {{proposed by the}} authors {{in order to achieve}} of a cutting and extracting device for the decommissioning of the horizontal fuel channels in the CANDU 6 nuclear reactor. The Cutting and Extraction Device (CED) performs the dismantling, cutting and extraction of the fuel channel components. It's a flexible and modular device, which is designed to work inside the fuel channel and has the following functions: moving with variable speed, temperature monitoring and video surveillance inside the pipe, unblock and extract the channel closure plug (from End Fitting - EF), unblock and extract the channel shield plug (from Lattice Tube - LT), block and cut the middle of the pressure tube, block and cut the end of the pressure tube, block and extract the half of pressure tube. The Cutting and Extraction Device (CED) consists of following modules: guiding-fixing module, traction modules, cutting module, guiding-extracting module and flexible elements for modules connecting. The guiding-fixing module is equipped with elastic guiding rollers and fixing claws <b>in</b> <b>working</b> <b>position,</b> the traction modules are provided with variable pitch rollers for allowing variable travel speed through the fuel channel. The cutting module is positioned {{in the middle of the}} device and it is equipped with three knife rolls for pressure tube cutting, using a system for cutting place video surveillance and pyrometers for monitoring cutting place temperature. The Cutting and Extraction Device (CED) is fully automated, connected by wires to a Programmable Logic Controller (PLC) and controlled from a Human Machine Interface (HMI). The design of the Cutting and Extraction Device (CED) shall be achieved according to the particular features of the fuel channel components to be dismantled and to ensure radiation protection of workers. ...|$|E

Both of these methods produced an elongated shape of the head.

40|$|AbstractMany {{people spend}} the greater {{percentage}} of a day <b>working</b> on computers <b>in</b> many different line of work. Some kinds of works even require continuous prolonged time for seated work on computers. Thus, a computer workstation should be comfortable as <b>working</b> long time <b>in</b> same sitting position {{could lead to a}} repetitive strain injury. To increase comfort of computer workstation, a workstation capable of multiple <b>working</b> <b>positions</b> by implementing ergonomic principles was proposed and a Multi-Position Ergonomic Computer Workstation was developed. Positions of this workstation were controlled using linear actuators. A <b>working</b> <b>position</b> of the workstation was a combination of positions of each part, namely seat, backrest, footrest and monitor post. In this paper, effects of multiple <b>working</b> <b>position</b> on user comfort were investigated using the developed ergonomic computer workstation. Four types of <b>working</b> <b>positions</b> were selected to compare the corresponding effects on comfort. Subjective evaluation methods were used to assess comfort <b>in</b> multiple <b>working</b> <b>positions.</b> The subjective evaluation was conducted by using selected volunteer people that tested the workstation for a given time interval. Test subjects answered questionnaire by rating the comfort scale of the workstation for major body parts based on their feelings <b>in</b> each <b>working</b> <b>position.</b> Results showed that different <b>working</b> <b>positions</b> have different scale of comfort; and in particular, one kind of position gives better comfort for specific body parts than another position. On the other hand, one kind of position was very suitable for some kind of tasks but not as suitable for different kind of tasks...|$|R

40|$|Working {{rehabilitation}} is {{the topic}} of my diploma thesis. Finding out the ways of securing working rehabilitation by the employment offices {{in the region of}} Ústí nad Labem on the basis of secondary sources and qualitative talks is the aim of this diploma thesis. So far in the Czech Republic hasn´t been the system providing comprehensive solution of the health handicapped employment. The Act Employment n. 435 / 2004, Code introduces the institute of <b>working</b> rehabilitation <b>in</b> order to provide the access and comeback to the labour market for the health handicapped. Supporting the policy which enable to employ these handicapped people is the the next objective of this institute. The employment offices as the state administration bodies provide the employment facilities in a given region, they are independent subjects, territorially organized in districts and their legislative duties contain working rehabilitation securing. Research respondents were the particular employment offices in the region of Ústí nad Labem personnel who are interested <b>in</b> <b>working</b> rehabilitation and really practise it. The region of ústí nad Labem belongs to the Czech Republic area maintaining the primacy in the field of the unemployment. The unemployment as a result of labour market functioning is one of the contemporary world problems. Labour market is very dynamic phenomenon which reacts to technological development and economic situation. Nowadayas with the essential decrease <b>in</b> <b>working</b> <b>positions</b> there is a decrease <b>in</b> free <b>working</b> <b>positions</b> reserved for the handicapped and thus the participation of the handiccaped in the total number of job applicants has been steadily increased. The integration of these handiccaped to the labour market is affected by lots of factors among others by insuficcient awareness of their needs and weak points of the contemporary functioning from the legistation and practise view point. Creating procedures which enable to make provision for needs and skills of working rehabilitation participants and thereby increasing their participation at labour market was the intention of this diploma thesis. The targets were fulfilled so there were suggested three variants which show various possibilities of the initiation of working rehabilitation process and enable the effective usage of their particular forms. The diploma thesis results can be used either by the employment offices personnel throughout the Czech Republic or by the specialized experts who are interested in the problem of working rehabilitation...|$|R
