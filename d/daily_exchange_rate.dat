50|$|As {{hyperinflation}} accelerated, {{the value}} of the Zimbabwe dollar declined fast against other currencies, yet official exchange rates published by the Reserve Bank of Zimbabwe were infrequently updated; this made it impossible to tell from an official source how much the Zimbabwe dollar was really worth against other currencies on a particular day, which in turn disrupted international business transactions involving Zimbabwe dollars. Staff from WM/Reuters devised an indirect means of measurement that was termed the Old Mutual Implied Rate (OMIR). This took the daily price of shares in the insurance company Old Mutual that traded in the London and Harare stock markets and derived from it a notional <b>daily</b> <b>exchange</b> <b>rate</b> between the Zimbabwe dollar and the pound. Shares had much less strict capital controls than through the Zimbabwe banking system, so the shares were used as a vehicle for moving capital between currencies by buying stock in either London or Harare and then selling in the other location.|$|E

40|$|Abstract: This {{paper is}} the first to utilize the informational content {{embodied}} in Federal funds futures contracts for extracting day-to-day changes in expectations of future US monetary policy, {{in the context of a}} study of day-to-day exchange rate changes. We analyze more than 12 years of <b>daily</b> <b>exchange</b> <b>rate</b> data and show that continuous day-to-day changes in expectations of future US monetary policy has a significant and systematic impact on day-to-day changes in exchange rates. Our results imply that monetary policy matters for <b>daily</b> <b>exchange</b> <b>rate</b> determination in more ways than merely through infrequent, actual policy changes. Furthermore, when focusing on the actual monetary policy changes, the paper confirms that only the unexpected element of a policy change impacts exchange rates.

40|$|This paper {{investigates the}} most {{appropriate}} model for generating scenarios for <b>daily</b> foreign <b>exchange</b> <b>rates</b> for {{a long history of}} a large number of <b>daily</b> <b>exchange</b> <b>rates</b> and finds: returns are not normal; a mean reversion model is rarely appropriate; sampling from historical returns (natural log differenced data) will capture the basic features of the mean of the return data but will ignore the autocorrelation in the mean and variance of returns; using a fat-tailed distributional assumption by matching the kurtosis of the historical data will capture the excess kurtosis of the data but similarly ignore these autocorrelations; a GARCH(1, 1) model is in most cases sufficient to model time dependence of the conditional variance and will generate returns with excess kurtosis. In some cases an MA(1) - GARCH(1, 1) model is required to capture residual autocorrelation, and in a few case more complicated ARMA(p,q) - GARCH(1, 1) models are needed. ...|$|R
