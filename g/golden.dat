5|$|In 2015 a major DNA {{study of}} <b>golden</b> jackals {{concluded}} that the six C.aureus subspecies found in Africa should be reclassified under the new species C.anthus (African <b>golden</b> wolf), {{reducing the number of}} <b>golden</b> jackal subspecies to seven. The phylogenetic tree generated from this study shows the <b>golden</b> jackal diverging from the wolf/coyote lineage 1.9million years ago and the African <b>golden</b> wolf diverging 1.3million years ago. The study found that the <b>golden</b> jackal and the African <b>golden</b> wolf shared a very similar skull and body morphology and that this had confused taxonomists into regarding these as one species. The study proposes that the very similar skull and body morphology is due to both species having originated from a larger common ancestor.|$|E
5|$|A {{haplotype}} is a {{group of}} genes found in an organism that is inherited from one of its parents. A haplogroup {{is a group}} of similar haplotypes that share a single mutation inherited from their common ancestor. The mDNA haplotypes of the <b>golden</b> jackal form two haplogroups: the oldest haplogroup is formed by <b>golden</b> jackals from India, and the other, younger, haplogroup diverging from this includes <b>golden</b> jackals from all of the other regions. Indian <b>golden</b> jackals exhibit the highest genetic diversity, and those from northern and western India are the most basal, which indicates that India was the center from which <b>golden</b> jackals spread. The extant <b>golden</b> jackal lineage commenced expanding its population in India 37,000 years ago. During the Last Glacial Maximum, 25,000 to 18,000 years ago, the warmer regions of India and Southeast Asia provided a refuge when compared with the surrounding areas. At the end of the Last Glacial Maximum {{and the beginning of the}} warming cycles, the <b>golden</b> jackal lineage expanded out of India and into Eurasia to reach the Middle East and Europe.|$|E
5|$|Affleck has {{appeared}} in more than 50 films, and won many accolades throughout his career as an actor, writer, and director. He first gained recognition as a writer {{when he won the}} <b>Golden</b> Globe and the Academy Award for Best Original Screenplay for Good Will Hunting (1997), which he co-wrote with Matt Damon. As an actor, he received a <b>Golden</b> Globe nomination for his performance in Hollywoodland (2006). The film Argo (2012), which he directed, co-produced, and starred in, won him the <b>Golden</b> Globe Award, BAFTA, and Directors Guild Award for Best Director, as well as the <b>Golden</b> Globe Award, BAFTA, the Producers Guild Award, and the Academy Award for Best Picture.|$|E
5|$|Ajay {{ends up in}} Yuma's {{mountain}} prison, {{from which}} he manages to escape. In the process he finds out that Yuma has started despising Pagan, primarily because of his affections toward Ajay's late mother. The <b>Golden</b> Path pushes into the north, and while Ajay attempts to reconnect with another faction of the rebels, Pagan, aware of Yuma's plotting against him, betrays Yuma to the <b>Golden</b> Path. Ajay is drawn into a confrontation with her and prevails, but tensions between Amita and Sabal reach new heights, and Ajay is forced to make a final decision as to who will lead the <b>Golden</b> Path. Whichever leader he chooses then sends Ajay to kill the other {{to prevent them from}} starting another civil war, and Ajay can choose to either kill them as ordered or let them go. With the <b>Golden</b> Path now united under a single leader, Ajay joins them for an attack on Pagan's fortress and pushes on alone to Pagan's palace while the <b>Golden</b> Path holds off the military.|$|E
5|$|All species {{within the}} wolf-like canids possess 78 {{chromosomes}} {{and therefore can}} potentially interbreed. Genetic analysis reveals that hybridization takes place between gray wolves and jackals, creating a jackal-wolf hybrid. Hybridization also occurs between female <b>golden</b> jackals and male dogs, which produces fertile offspring, a jackal–dog hybrid. There was 11%–13% of ancient gene flow into the <b>golden</b> jackal from the population that was ancestral to wolves and dogs, and an additional 3% contributed from extant wolf populations. Up to 15% of the Israeli wolf genome is derived from admixure with <b>golden</b> jackals in ancient times.|$|E
5|$|Allison played college {{football}} for the Waterloo Lutheran <b>Golden</b> Hawks as a quarterback. By his final {{year with the}} <b>Golden</b> Hawks in 1972, Allison {{was known as a}} dual-threat quarterback who frequently utilized triple option running plays out of the wishbone formation. He led the <b>Golden</b> Hawks to victories in the Yates Cup game and the Atlantic Bowl as a senior. The <b>Golden</b> Hawks then played in the 8th Vanier Cup (then known as the College Bowl), losing 7–20 to the Alberta <b>Golden</b> Bears.|$|E

5|$|In 2003, the {{criterion}} for the award was changed {{in an effort to}} further stimulate the Dutch film industry. Films released after January 1, 2003 had to reach paying audiences of 100,000 to qualify for the <b>Golden</b> Film and 400,000 for the Platinum Film. All films that had received a <b>Golden</b> Film before 2003 would also have received a <b>Golden</b> Film under the new criterion. From 2003 until 2007, the percentage of cinema visitors in the Netherlands who watched a Dutch film was between 9.20% and 13.4%.|$|E

Following its 2010 renovation, the New Texas Giant again ranked highly in the <b>Golden</b> Ticket Awards (this time amongst steel roller coasters), achieving ranks of 6 and 5 in 2011 and 2012, respectively. The ride also won a <b>Golden</b> Ticket Award for being the Best New Ride of 2011.|$|E
5|$|In Dalmatia, the <b>golden</b> jackal's diet {{consists}} of mammals, fruits, vegetables, insects, birds and their eggs, grasses and leaves. Jackals change their diet to {{more readily available}} foods. In Serbia, their diet is primarily livestock carcasses that are increasingly prevalent {{due to a lack}} of removal, and this may have led to the expansion of their population. In Hungary, 55% of their diet is composed of common voles and bank voles, and 41% is composed of wild boar carcasses. Information on the diet of the <b>golden</b> jackal in northeastern Italy is scant, but it is known to prey on small roe deer and hares. In Israel, <b>golden</b> jackals are significant predators of snakes; during a poisoning campaign against <b>golden</b> jackals there was an increase in human snakebite reports, but a decrease when the poisoning ceased.|$|E
5|$|In Europe <b>golden</b> jackals are {{not listed}} under the 1973 Convention on International Trade in Endangered Species of Wild Fauna and Flora nor the 1979 Convention on the Conservation of Migratory Species of Wild Animals. <b>Golden</b> jackals in Europe fall under various {{international}} legal instruments. These include the 1979 Berne Convention on the Conservation of European Wildlife and Natural Habitats, the 1992 Convention on Biological Diversity, and the 1992 European Union Council Directive 92/43/EEC on the Conservation of Natural Habitats and of Wild Fauna and Flora. The Council Directive provides both guidance and limits on what participating governments can do when {{responding to the}} arrival of expanding jackals. These legislative instruments aim to contribute to conserving native wildlife; some governments argue that the <b>golden</b> jackal is not native wildlife but an invading species. The <b>Golden</b> Jackal informal study Group in Europe (GOJAGE) is an organization that is formed by researchers from across Europe to collect and share information on the <b>golden</b> jackal in Europe. The group also has an interest in the <b>golden</b> jackal's relationship with its environment across Eurasia. Membership is open to anyone that has an interest in <b>golden</b> jackals.|$|E

5|$|In {{the late}} 1990s and early 2000s, the IFAB experimented with ways of {{creating}} a winner without requiring a penalty shootout, which was often seen as an undesirable way to end a match. These involved rules ending a game in extra time early, either when the first goal in extra time was scored (<b>golden</b> goal), or if one team held a lead {{at the end of}} the first period of extra time (silver goal). <b>Golden</b> goal was used at the World Cup in 1998 and 2002. The first World Cup game decided by a <b>golden</b> goal was France's victory over Paraguay in 1998. Germany was the first nation to score a <b>golden</b> goal in a major competition, beating Czech Republic in the final of Euro 1996. Silver goal was used in Euro 2004. Both these experiments have been discontinued by IFAB.|$|E
5|$|Like other white-eyes, the <b>golden</b> white-eye is diurnal. In {{contrast}} to the bridled white-eye, which forages in groups and is not territorial, the <b>golden</b> white-eye occurs in pairs or small family groups consisting of a breeding pair and fledged young. The <b>golden</b> white-eye is also territorial, and pairs will sing throughout the day in response to neighbouring pairs. Groups can become aggressive when they encounter one another. The <b>golden</b> white-eye is also aggressive towards the smaller bridled white-eye, chasing it away from food and perches and flying through flocks of {{them in order to}} disperse them. While it chases other forest passerines, it is less aggressive towards them, and in fact the rufous fantail seeks out the <b>golden</b> white-eye, foraging behind it to snatch insects flushed by the latter species. The <b>golden</b> white-eye is socially dominant over the bridled white-eyes and rufous fantails, but it is subordinate to the Micronesian myzomela and is chased by that species. It is also occasionally chased by the fantails if it approaches their nests too closely.|$|E

5|$|Outside of India, <b>golden</b> jackals in the Caucasus and Turkey {{indicate}} the next highest genetic diversity, while those in Europe indicate low genetic diversity, which confirms their more recent expansion into Europe. Genetic data {{indicates that the}} <b>golden</b> jackals of the Peloponnese Peninsula in Greece and the Dalmatian coast in Croatia may represent two ancient populations that have survived into modern times. <b>Golden</b> jackals in the Balkans originated from those expanding from southeast Europe and from the Caucasus. <b>Golden</b> jackals from both the Balkans and the Caucasus are expanding into the Baltic. In the Middle East, <b>golden</b> jackals from Israel have a higher genetic diversity than European jackals. This {{is thought to be}} due to Israeli jackals having hybridized with dogs, gray wolves, and African <b>golden</b> wolves, creating a hybrid zone in Israel.|$|E
