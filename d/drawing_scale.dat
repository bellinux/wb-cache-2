40|$|This {{study was}} {{designed}} to investigate {{the reliability and validity of}} the Play, Language and Drawing Representational Behavior Scale (Workman and Owings, 1983). This investigator researched the test-retest reliability, content validity and construct validity of the Play, Language and <b>Drawing</b> <b>Scale.</b> Children from nine months to five years of age were assessed using the scale. Sixteen to eighteen children per stage were observed; the investigator, therefore, was 95 % confident that the estimate of the proportions (p) was within 15 % of the true proportions (P). Four children at each stage were then randomly chosen for a two-week retest. To analyze the data the following formulas or strategies were used for each particular type of reliability or validity: 1) Content valid- ity was established by citing a research reference for each item, by conducting an item analysis for the scale, and by conducting a "goodness of fit " analysis. 2) Construct validity was established by citing a theoretical or research based rationale for each item of the scale. 3) Test-retest reliability was analyzed using the Pearson product-moment correlation and by calculating a reliability percentage (number of matches/number of items).

40|$|The aim of {{the present}} study was to {{investigate}} body dissatisfaction and eating attitudes and the moderating role of gender, parental influences, body-mass index (BMI), and physical activity in 9 ± 10 -year-old children. Sixty-eight 9 ± 10 -year-old children (36 boys, 32 girls) were asked to indicate their perceived and ideal body size using the figure <b>drawing</b> <b>scale</b> of Childress et al. (1993). Physical activity levels were assessed with a diary method over 7 consecutive days. Questionnaires were used to collect information on children's eating habits and children's perception of parental weight, parental attitudes towards body size, and eating habits. Children's weight and height were measured and the BMI calculated. 44 % of boys and 34 % of girls wanted to be thinner than they perceived themselves to be. Multiple regression analyses indicated that this desire was predicted by children's BMI, perceived overweight of mother, and eating patterns indicating restraint eating style. Given that only 13 % were overweight, the percentage of children wanting to be thinner is of concern. The current results indicate that there may be an increasing trend for a thinner body ideal in boys compared to previous reports...|$|E

High levels of body dissatisfaction have already been reported in the trans population; however, the root of this dissatisfaction, and its association with eating disordered behaviours, has not been studied in-depth. This study aims to assess eating disorder risk by comparing 200 trans people, 200 people with eating disorders and 200 control participants' scores on three subscales of the Eating Disorders Inventory- 2 (EDI- 2) and to further explore dissatisfaction in the trans participants using the Hamburg Body <b>Drawing</b> <b>Scale</b> (HBDS). The results showed that overall participants with eating disorders scored higher than trans or control groups on all EDI- 2 measures, but that trans individuals had greater body dissatisfaction than control participants and, importantly, trans males had comparable body dissatisfaction scores to eating disordered males. Drive for thinness was greater in females (cis and trans) compared with males. In relation to HBDS body dissatisfaction, both trans males and trans females reported greatest dissatisfaction not only for gender-identifying body parts but also for body shape and weight. Overall, trans males may be at particular risk for eating disordered psychopathology and other body image-related behaviours...|$|E
40|$|The {{alteration}} of sex-specific body features {{and the establishment}} of a satisfactory body image are known to be particularly relevant for individuals with Gender Dysphoria (GD). The aim {{of the study was to}} first develop new scales and examine the psychometric properties of the Hamburg Body <b>Drawing</b> <b>Scale</b> (Appelt & Strau 1988). For the second part of this study, the satisfaction with different body features in young GD adults before cross-sex treatment were compared to female and male controls. Data collection took place within the context of the European Network for the Investigation of Gender Incongruence (ENIGI) including 135 female-to-male (FtMs) and 115 male-to-female (MtFs) young GD adults and 235 female and 379 male age-adjusted controls. The five female and six male body feature subscales revealed good internal consistency. The ENIGI sample reported less satisfaction with overall appearance (d = 0. 30) and with all of their body features than controls, but no subgroup differences for sexual orientation (FtM and MtF) and Age of Onset (FtM) were found. Body dissatisfaction was higher with regard to sex-specific body features (largest effect sizes of d = 3. 21 for Genitalia in FtMs and d = 2. 85 for Androgen-responsive features and genitalia in MtFs) than with those that appeared less related to the natal sex (d = 0. 64 for Facial features in FtMs and d = 0. 59 for Body shape in MtFs). Not only medical body modifying interventions, but also psychosocial guidance with regard to body image might be helpful for GD individuals before transitioning...|$|E

40|$|In {{an earlier}} study, we adopted the Stunkard nine-figure scale to examine body shape dissatisfaction in Hong Kong adults. Due to ethnic specificity, {{a set of}} Chinese-based body shape {{silhouette}} would be more helpful in understanding the weight-related concepts of this population. The present study aimed to develop a set of self-rating figural scale for Chinese adults and compared the discrepancies between the actual BMI (measured) and the BMI represented in the chosen figure (perceived) of the Stunkard scale and the new scale. The new figure dimensions were based on published anthropometric database from China and Taiwan. Figure # 5 represents the mean BMI (21. 9 kg/m 2) and figures # 1 and 9 anchor respectively the 3 rd and 97 th percentile of the population BMI. In a preliminary study, male (n= 53) with BMI ranging between 15. 9 – 28. 0, indicated strongly that the new scale better represents the body proportion and shape of Chinese male when presented with both scales in a random and blinded fashion (2 = 18. 132, P < 0. 001). They were asked to select the figure that best match their current body shape. The BMI difference (actual minus perceived) was – 2. 47 with the Stunkard scale and 0. 083 with the new scale (t= 12. 806, P < 0. 001). Hence when provided with the Stunkard scale, subjects tended to pick a figure that is larger than actual.

40|$|Background Parentification is {{a pattern}} of family {{interactions}} when either a child or an adolescent accepts roles and obligations fulfilled by adults. Being burdened with duties {{and taking care of}} parents makes separation, as well as fulfilment of development tasks and acceptance of roles suitable for a child, difficult. Simultaneously parentification might constitute a factor which forms resilience and functional coping manners. The aim {{of the study was to}} broaden the knowledge about parentification and its connections with the features of the family system. Participants and procedure The participants were 89 people divided into triads including the youngster in his/her late teens and his/her parents. The youngsters filled in Hooper’s Parentification Inventory and Olson’s Family Evaluation Scale (FES), in Margasiński’s adaptation, and assessed the bond with family members using a <b>drawing</b> <b>scale.</b> The parents also filled in the FES, and additionally they evaluated the level of conflict intensity and tension in a partner relationship by means of a modified version of the Cantril Ladder. Results Perception of the benefits of parentification differentiated the adolescents from well-balanced and ill-balanced families. Additionally, the stronger the bond the adolescents shared with their parents and the higher they assessed their satisfaction with family life and communications in the family, the more positive was their view of the effects of parentification. The predictor for the perception of the benefits of parentification by adolescents turned out to be the family’s cohesion. Conclusions The assessment of the functioning of the family system is essential. When, according to adolescents, the family system is functioning effectively, they can use the family resources and positively reformulate even negative experiences concerned with parentification...|$|E

Participants viewed thirteen female images and then completed three surveys that assessed their body dissatisfaction and acceptance of abusive behaviors.
