5|$|Huntington's disease, {{particularly}} {{the application of}} the genetic test for the disease, has raised several ethical issues. The issues for genetic testing include defining how mature an individual should be before being considered eligible for testing, ensuring the confidentiality of results, and whether companies should be allowed to use test results for decisions on employment, life insurance or other financial matters. There was controversy when Charles Davenport proposed in 1910 that compulsory sterilization and immigration control be used for people with certain diseases, including HD, as part of the eugenics movement. In vitro fertilization has some issues regarding its use of embryos. Some HD research has ethical issues due to its use of animal testing and <b>embryonic</b> <b>stem</b> <b>cells.</b>|$|E

He also supported gun control, voting for the Brady Bill and supporting a reinstatement of the Federal Assault Weapons Ban. At different times he voted to ban flag-burning and partial-birth abortions, though he reversed his positions on both issues. On education, he expressed support for the public education system, universal pre-kindergarten, and full funding for the No Child Left Behind program. Moran was given a 100% rating by the NARAL and 0% by the National Right to Life Committee, indicating a pro-choice voting record. He also voted to expand research of <b>embryonic</b> <b>stem</b> <b>cells</b> and to allow minors to go across state lines to receive abortions.|$|E
5|$|Turning Urine Samples into Brain Cells: This new {{technique}} of reprogramming ordinary cells present in urine into immature brain cells that can form multiple types of functioning neurons and glial cells {{was developed by}} Chinese researchers in China, and {{was published in the}} scientific journal Nature Methods in December 2012. Instead of using retrovirus, they used vectors which the researchers say is a breakthrough This does not involve <b>embryonic</b> <b>stem</b> <b>cells</b> which come with serious drawbacks when transplanted, such as the risk of developing tumours. This technique makes the procedure of generating Induced pluripotent stem cells far easier and non-invasive, as the cells can be obtained from a urine sample instead of a blood sample or biopsy. This research proves human excreta could be a powerful source of cells to study disease, bypassing some of the problems of using stem cells, and could be useful for research studying the cellular mechanisms of neurodegenerative conditions such as Alzheimer's and Parkinson's and for testing the effects of new drugs that are being developed to treat them.|$|E

5|$|The {{discovery}} of insulin at the University of Toronto in 1921 is {{considered among the}} most significant events {{in the history of}} medicine. The stem cell was discovered at the university in 1963, forming the basis for bone marrow transplantation and all subsequent research on adult and <b>embryonic</b> <b>stem</b> <b>cells.</b> This was the first of many findings at Toronto relating to stem cells, including the identification of pancreatic and retinal stem cells. The cancer stem cell was first identified in 1997 by Toronto researchers, who have since found stem cell associations in leukemia, brain tumors and colorectal cancer. Medical inventions developed at Toronto include the glycaemic index, the infant cereal Pablum, the use of protective hypothermia in open heart surgery and the first artificial cardiac pacemaker. The first successful single-lung transplant was performed at Toronto in 1981, followed by the first nerve transplant in 1988, and the first double-lung transplant in 1989. Researchers identified the maturation promoting factor that regulates cell division, and discovered the T cell receptor, which triggers responses of the immune system. The university is credited with isolating the genes that cause Fanconi anemia, cystic fibrosis and early-onset Alzheimer's disease, among numerous other diseases. Between 1914 and 1972, the university operated the Connaught Medical Research Laboratories, now part of the pharmaceutical corporation Sanofi-Aventis. Among the research conducted at the laboratory was the development of gel electrophoresis.|$|E

40|$|This {{thesis is}} {{concerned}} with two different aspects of human <b>embryonic</b> <b>stem</b> <b>cell</b> research: legal and moral. These are not two distinct areas the law cannot regulate this controversial area of science without the input of morality. There is not one moral viewpoint {{on the use of}} human embryos in scientific research and as such this thesis discusses several different moral viewpoints before moving on to consider how the law takes into account these wide ranging and diverse stances. The science of human <b>embryonic</b> <b>stem</b> <b>cell</b> research is discussed briefly so as to ensure that the reader comprehends the science that the law is seeking to regulate and over which there is so much ethical debate. The majority of this thesis then considers the legal aspects of human <b>embryonic</b> <b>stem</b> <b>cell</b> research. The focus is upon the human embryo and human <b>embryonic</b> <b>stem</b> <b>cell</b> interface how the legislation which governs human embryo research has been used to subsequently regulate human <b>embryonic</b> <b>stem</b> <b>cell</b> research. The examination of the legal aspects of human <b>embryonic</b> <b>stem</b> <b>cell</b> research starts with a historical chapter on how the legislation came into force. This is necessary so as to understand how and why we regulate human <b>embryonic</b> <b>stem</b> <b>cell</b> research as we do and what the legislation does, before moving onto the finer detail. The role of research ethics committees, the HFEA and the UK <b>Stem</b> <b>Cell</b> Bank in human <b>embryonic</b> <b>stem</b> <b>cell</b> research are all analysed in depth, problem areas highlighted and solutions suggested. An analytical discussion of the reform process which led to the Human Fertilisation and Embryology Act 2008 is the last step in the examination of the regulation of human <b>embryonic</b> <b>stem</b> <b>cell</b> research. Finally comparisons are made to the State of California, USA which was the first US state to permissively fund <b>stem</b> <b>cell</b> research. The law stated is correct as of the 13 th November 2008 when the Human Fertilisation and Embryology Act 2008 received Royal Assent. EThOS - Electronic Theses Online ServiceGBUnited Kingdo...|$|R
