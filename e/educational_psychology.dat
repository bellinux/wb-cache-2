Honora Sneyd is often listed amongst the members or associates of the Bluestockings, educated upper class literary women who disdained traditional female accomplishments and often formed close female friendships. The depiction of the effect of consumption on her {{has been used as a}} symbol of the pervasiveness of the disease in eighteenth century culture. The work she started on <b>educational</b> <b>psychology</b> would prove to be immensely influential throughout the nineteenth century. Her name is also inextricably entwined with that of Anna Seward in the literature of lesbian relationships and female friendship.|$|E

5|$|Stratton saw humans not as {{machines}} {{to be analyzed}} mechanistically, but also as seating will, emotion and drives, all of which had to analyzed as scientifically as the traditional psychological concepts of sensation, perception and memory. He also believed in a supreme actuality behind the world registered by our senses. This was the theme of his last published book, Man-Creator or Destroyer, completed in 1952 when he was eighty-seven years old. His book Developing Mental Power was a foray into <b>educational</b> <b>psychology,</b> addressing the question of general versus specific training in terms teachers could understand and use. Stratton aimed at this goal via a simple and generally applicable look at the basic workings of mental life. John F. Dashiell, writing in the Journal of Abnormal Psychology, found this a failure. Dashiell saw the path from the psychological concepts—emotion, intelligence, and will—to teaching methodology, not clearly described in the book. Stratton also applied psychological concepts {{to figure out how}} to avert war. He was optimistic it was possible to harness the creative and destructive facets of individuals to get nations to coexist peacefully. He saw nations as consisting of ethnicities and races which had to coexist in harmony. In line with the prevailing view in his field, he did not see the races as inherently equally intelligent.|$|E
25|$|<b>Educational</b> <b>psychology</b> can in part be {{understood}} through {{its relationship with}} other disciplines. It is informed primarily by psychology, bearing a relationship to that discipline analogous {{to the relationship between}} medicine and biology. It is also informed by neuroscience. <b>Educational</b> <b>psychology</b> in turn informs a wide range of specialities within educational studies, including instructional design, educational technology, curriculum development, organizational learning, special education, classroom management, and student motivation. <b>Educational</b> <b>psychology</b> both draws from and contributes to cognitive science and the learning sciences. In universities, departments of <b>educational</b> <b>psychology</b> are usually housed within faculties of education, possibly accounting for the lack of representation of <b>educational</b> <b>psychology</b> content in introductory psychology textbooks.|$|E

40|$|Background and {{objectives}} : This study aimed to compare mental health status between students of two faculties of Alzahra University: physical education vs. <b>educational</b> sciences and <b>psychology.</b> Material and Methods : This cross-sectional {{study was conducted}} in physical educations and <b>educational</b> sciences and <b>psychology</b> faculties. A total number of 242 and 265 students were surveyed in these faculties respectively by GHQ- 28 general health questionnaire. Data were extracted and analyzed using SPSS- 17. Results : Results indicated that among 265 students, 135 participants (55. 8 %) in physical education faculty and 170 participants in <b>educational</b> sciences and <b>psychology</b> faculty (60. 3 %) were suspected to suffer from mental disorders. Results showed that prevalence of mental disorders in physical education faculty and faculty of <b>educational</b> sciences and <b>psychology</b> was 9. 4 % and 30. 2 % respectively (p Conclusion : The results demonstrated that students of physical education faculty significantly scored lower than students of <b>educational</b> sciences and <b>psychology</b> faculty in all four scales of mental health.
