500|$|The {{lyrics of}} [...] "Waka Waka (This Time for Africa)" [...] compare {{football}} (soccer) players to soldiers on a battlefield {{and encourage them}} to fight for their goals. Fraser McAlpine from BBC Music Chart Blog described them to be [...] "about an undisclosed event which <b>is</b> <b>about</b> <b>to</b> <b>happen</b> for Africa, in which everyone gets together and enjoys the fruits of their hard work, even though there have been many hardships along the way."

500|$|Homer's catchphrase, the annoyed grunt [...] "D'oh!", is {{typically}} uttered when he injures himself, {{realizes that he}} has done something stupid, or when something bad has happened or <b>is</b> <b>about</b> <b>to</b> <b>happen</b> to him. During the voice recording session for a Tracey Ullman Show short, Homer was required to utter what was written in the script as an [...] "annoyed grunt". Dan Castellaneta rendered it as a drawn out [...] "d'ooooooh". This was inspired by Jimmy Finlayson, the mustachioed Scottish actor who appeared in 33 Laurel and Hardy films. Finlayson had used the term as a minced oath to stand in for the word [...] "Damn!" [...] Matt Groening felt that it would better suit the timing of animation if it were spoken faster. Castellaneta then shortened it to a quickly uttered [...] "D'oh!" [...] The first intentional use of D'oh! occurred in the Ullman short [...] "The Krusty the Clown Show" [...] (1989), and its first usage in the series was in the series premiere, [...] "Simpsons Roasting on an Open Fire".|$|E
