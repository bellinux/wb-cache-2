5000|$|Primer is a paint {{product that}} allows <b>finishing</b> <b>paint</b> to adhere {{much better than}} if it were used alone. [...] For this purpose, primer is {{designed}} to adhere to surfaces and to form a binding layer that is better prepared to receive the paint. Because primers {{do not need to}} be engineered to form a durable finished surface, they can instead be engineered to have improved filling and binding properties with the material underneath. Sometimes this is achieved by chemistry, as in the case of aluminium primer, but more often this is achieved through controlling the primer's physical properties, such as porosity, tackiness, and hygroscopy. In practice primer is often used when painting many kinds of porous materials, such as concrete and especially wood (see detailed description below). Priming is mandatory if the material is not water resistant and will be exposed to the elements. Priming gypsum board (drywall) is also standard practice with new construction because it seals the wall and aids in preventing mold. Primers can also be used for dirty surfaces which cannot be cleaned, or before painting light colors over existing dark colors.|$|E

30|$|Industrial {{effluents}} are {{the major}} sources of heavy metal contamination of water resources. Nickel, arsenic and cadmium {{are some of the}} toxic pollutants present in wastewater for electroplating, battery, mining and metallurgy, aircraft, pigments and ceramic industries (Salem and Awwad 2011). Bioaccumulation of these heavy metals in the food chain causes serious health hazards and disorders to all the biotic components of the ecosystem, including human beings. Cadmium toxicity results {{in a wide range of}} syndromes including renal dysfunction, hypertension, hepatic injury, lung damage and teratogenic effects. Excessive exposure to nickel can significantly increase the risk of lung, cardiovascular and kidney diseases in humans (Heidari et al. 2013). Chromium (Cr), cadmium (Cd) and nickel (Ni) compounds are also widely used in industries, such as leather tanning, electroplating, metal <b>finishing,</b> <b>paint</b> and pigments, and therefore discharge of these metals in large quantities into industrial effluents cannot be ruled out. Water containing a high concentration of these metals can cause serious environmental problems as well as induce toxic and carcinogenic health effects on humans. Therefore, the removal or minimizing the toxicity of the metal ions from wastewaters has been a matter of great concern.|$|E
40|$|In India {{the cost}} of {{corrosion}} prevention in marine industries may be {{of the order of}} Rs. 100 crores. The different areas of service are: (1) Immersed in seawater (2) 'Splash waterline (3) Super structure area near seawater. Painting is the principal means of protection; other methods such as cathodic protection, are used only in conjunction with paint coatings. Hence it is necessary to provide long term maintenance-free protection and to minimise the time out of service when maintenance of ship is essentially required. In this article the mechanism of corrosion prevention by paints, pretreatment, paint system, method of application of paint for &fferent types of structures and equipments used in marine environments are described. A comprehensive protective system consisting of primer + under coat + <b>finishing</b> <b>paint</b> + antifouling paints is included. Application of the organic coatings and details of type of fouling and the use of different types of antifouling compounds used in the paint formulation are given. The protective schemes for dock and harbour installation, offshore structure, super structures and deck areas are discussed. The causes of paint failure and the specification, requirements of paints are described...|$|E
40|$|Welded joints form an {{integral}} part of steel constructions. Welded joints are undetachable joints, which are however subjects of corrosion processes. The internal energy increases during the fusion welding especially in the heat affected places around the welded joint, which become initiating spot of corrosion degradation. The aim of the experiment is to put a welded joint produced by the MAG method to a test of corrosion degradation under the conditions of the norm ÄŒSN ISO 9227 (salt-spray test). Organic and inorganic anticorrosion protections were applied on welded beads. First of all, there were prepared welded beads using the method MAG; secondly, metallographical analyses of welded metal, heat affected places and base material were processed. Further, microhardness as well as analysis of chemical composition using the EDS microscope were analysed. Based on a current trend in anticorrosion protections, there were chosen three types of protective coatings. First protective system was a double-layer synthetic system, where the base layer is formed by paint Pragroprimer S 2000 and the upper layer by <b>finishing</b> <b>paint</b> Industrol S 2013. Second protective system is a duplex system formed by a combination of a base zinc coating with Zinorex paint. The last protective system was formed by zinc dipping only. Corrosion resistance of the individual tested samples was evaluated based on degradation of protective coating. The corrosion origin as well as the corrosion process were observed, the main criteria was the observation of welded bead...|$|E

During the 1860s, Monet and Renoir sometimes painted on canvases prepared with the traditional red-brown or grey ground.

40|$|AbstractBy {{utilizing}} the self-designed test platform {{to carry out}} tests on the edge ignition time and center ignition time of wooden panels coated with <b>finishing</b> fire-retardant <b>paints</b> to different fire-retardant degrees and analyzing the factors affecting the edge ignition time and center ignition time, this paper proposes the indicators {{for the assessment of}} fire-retardant properties of wooden panels coated with <b>finishing</b> fire-retardant <b>paints,</b> i. e. the edge ignition time and the center ignition time.
