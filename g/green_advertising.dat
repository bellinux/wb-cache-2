40|$|In 2016, it is {{no longer}} {{possible}} to deny the existence of global warming and its harmful effects on our planet and the environment. Not only experts, but also consumers, have become increasingly concerned about the environment. This increased awareness and concern has increased consumers’ interest in purchasing environmentally friendly food products, and has caused companies to focus on programs intent on reducing their environmental impact and helping the environment. Companies have introduced more environmentally friendly food products, accessible on a large scale, and have changed their communication to focus more on green products and green product attributes. Scandinavian countries have some of the largest numbers of organic food consumers in Europe and the world, with the Swedish organic food industry measuring the highest growth rate in organic food sales in 2015. Therefore, this study focuses on the Swedish green food industry. A major way for companies to make consumers aware of their available environmentally friendly food products is through <b>green</b> <b>advertising.</b> An increasingly frequent problem, however, is that consumers tend to distrust these green ads. They have knowledge of green washing practices and misleading information in <b>green</b> <b>advertising.</b> In this thesis, the relationships between green consumerism, green washing and <b>green</b> <b>advertising</b> skepticism were investigated. The potential relationship between demographic factors such as gender, age, income and level and area of study, and <b>green</b> <b>advertising</b> skepticism were tested as well. A research model with three main hypotheses was used in this thesis. The results showed a significant relationship between green consumerism and <b>green</b> <b>advertising</b> skepticism when green washing was a moderator. There was also a significant negative relationship between attitude towards green products and <b>green</b> <b>advertising</b> skepticism and a positive relationship between environmental concern and <b>green</b> <b>advertising</b> skepticism.

40|$|Introduction With the {{increased}} interest and awareness toward environmental issues among Swedish consumers, their demands on what constitutes value in advertisements have also changed. Advertising-in-general is often {{regarded as a}} rather unwelcomed intrusion {{and a source of}} irritation by consumers and a common reason is that many advertisers have overdramatized or even spread false claims about products, causing great skepticism among consumers. With the increase of environmentally minded consumers, it is of great importance for advertisers to understand the particular differences between advertising-in-general and <b>green</b> <b>advertising</b> and how to approach the two differently for desired effect. Are there certain factors perceived to be more important in <b>green</b> <b>advertising</b> than in advertising-in-general and how could it affect current techniques used by advertisers? Purpose The purpose of the thesis is to examine and compare Swedish consumers’ attitudes toward advertising-in-general and <b>green</b> <b>advertising</b> found in printed media. Method To fulfill the purpose of the study, a quantitative research approach was selected. A questionnaire was distributed electronically to measure the attitude toward advertising-in-general and <b>green</b> <b>advertising</b> among Swedish consumers. Several statistical analyses were applied to the data to test the generated hypotheses to enable findings and a discussion on the research questions of the study. Findings and Conclusion The study suggested that there are perceived differences in certain factors among Swedish consumers, when comparing advertising-in-general to <b>green</b> <b>advertising.</b> New groupings of already-existing factors were also discovered, indicating a need for a development of the existing model with a focus on <b>green</b> <b>advertising.</b> Managerial implications concerned the continued development and focus upon providing a high level of informativeness and credibility, in advertisements with environmental claims...|$|E

First, having consumers engage in a pro-environmental behavior is a critical first step toward promoting pro-environmental behaviors. In doing so, communications claiming the synergistic value from collaborative works among household consumption, community, and retail industry would be effective for the promotion of greener lifestyles and <b>green</b> product purchases/consumption. <b>Advertising</b> and campaign messages that activate environmental concern and one’s obligation to act in pro-environmental ways would be able to encourage spillover—performing one behavior leads people to adopt other pro-environmental behaviors. Additionally, the result about spillover between past recycling behavior and green apparel shopping behaviors can signify the potential contribution that corporate social/environmental performance can make to corporate marketing and financial performance. Corporate virtue and support towards social and environmental responsibility will pay off by affecting customers’ choices for green products/services.|$|R
30|$|According to {{population}} size, Millennials represent a target segment consisting of over 80 million people (Taken Smith, 2014). Companies often conduct specific research {{to better understand}} Millennials’ characteristics, values, preferences, motives, attitudes and behaviour, hoping to identify appropriate levers to draw their attention, provide them with information and have them buy their products (Hill Hyun-Hwa Lee, 2012). Millennials have a preference for social responsible products and brands which {{have a positive impact}} on the environment, the production of which does not have harmful effects or a negative influence on nature (Chu et al., 2013). Being aware of the potential represented by this customer segment, retailers try to please them by means of <b>green</b> communication <b>advertising</b> and messages (Taken Smith, 2014). By following this strategy, retailers have been able to activate the conative component of consumers’ attitudes, making them purchase green products. Millennials are attracted by catchwords such as “eco-friendly”, “green”, “social responsible” or “recycled” accompanying the promotion of sustainable products (Smith, 2010). The use of these catchwords on packaging, as part of communication strategies and actions, have boosted product marketing and sales, leading to greater revenues for companies (Taken Smith, 2014). Unlike Millennials, Gen Xers are easier to “target” by means of advertisements, as they allow themselves to be more easily influenced by other people (Acar, 2014). Being pragmatic in character, they make decisions with full knowledge of the facts and information about products, services, brands, etc., often coming from members of the reference groups to which they belong or identify themselves with.|$|R
40|$|This article {{reports on}} a study {{undertaken}} to {{determine the influence of}} conative attitudes towards <b>green</b> <b>advertising</b> on black Generation Y students’ environmental behaviour in the South African context. In South Africa, the Generation Y cohort, which is defined as including individuals born between 1986 and 2005, accounted for 40 percent of the country’s population in 2011. The African portion of this cohort (hereafter referred to as black Generation Y) comprise an estimated 84 percent of this cohort. This translates into black Generation Y individuals being a market force of significant importance to marketers, including those engaged in <b>green</b> <b>advertising</b> efforts. Despite the importance of this market segment, their consumer behaviour remains under researched in general, specifically concerning their attitudes towards environmental issues and marketing. In order to address this shortfall in the literature, a structured, self-administered questionnaire was used to gather data on conative attitudes towards <b>green</b> <b>advertising</b> and how this influences environmental behaviour from a sample of 400 black Generation Y students across four South African public registered higher education institutions’ campuses situated in the Gauteng province. Data analysis included measurement of model fit, independent z-tests and path analysis using structural equation modelling. According to the results, there was acceptable fit between the proposed two-dimensional model for measuring conative attitudes towards <b>green</b> <b>advertising</b> and the data in the sample.

40|$|The {{empirical}} study featuring in {{this paper}} is contextualised within the statistics provided by a national survey on older volunteerism. Older volunteers are nowadays viewed as a valuable resource, a reliable and experienced labour pool. In Malta, many persons aged 60 and above volunteer many hours each month in local environmental organisations in their goal to preserve the earth for future generations even though they will not personally see the benefits. Through the data emanating from a qualitative survey this paper highlights the possible positive returns accruing from green volunteering in later life which are of a physical, cognitive, and social nature. It thus argues {{that there is a}} potential for moreolder volunteers in green non-governmental organisations. It is on this basis that a number of policy options and action strategies to improve the engagement of older persons in green volunteering are recommended. These include expanding the participation by older persons who are ageing actively, presenting green volunteering as a course module in pre-retirement educational programmes, <b>advertising</b> <b>green</b> volunteering as a means of self-actualisation rather than as a form of unpaid work, and designing green volunteer roles that do not necessitate high levels of education...|$|R
30|$|Further {{constraints}} {{on the evolution of}} the regime included, despite the recognition of having become an immigration country, the mobilisation of anti-immigrant public attitudes combined with tactical electoral considerations, which limited the room for reform to elite-level negotiations (Green, 2005; Howard, 2008). The SPD-Green coalition provided an opportunity in this respect, but their nationality law reform in 2000 fell short of expectations and did not result in a law as liberal as it was <b>advertised</b> (<b>Green,</b> 2012). But one remarkable development was the introduction of a model of jus soli conditional upon the renunciation of any other citizenship at the age of majority. It has taken yet another decade to introduce plural citizenship into the government agenda as a compromise for the ‘grand coalition’ formed after the 2013 federal election, and the 2014 reform brought about the tolerance of plural citizenship in the form of waiving the requirement of choosing only one citizenship. Although this last change is not a full endorsement of plural citizenship and only applies to those who are entitled to German citizenship as a birthright (Hailbronner & Farahat, 2015), it is eventually possible to be a dual citizen in Germany after a slow and gradual evolution of its citizenship regime.|$|R
