It will be {{operated}} over a large temperature range from - 10 to 30 ^∘C, so the temperature effect of the whole detection system should be studied in detail. The temperature dependence of the PSD system is mainly contributed by the three parts: the plastic scintillator bar, the photomultiplier tube (PMT), and the <b>Front</b> <b>End</b> Electronics (<b>FEE).</b> These three parts have been studied in detail and the contribution of each part has been obtained and discussed. The temperature coefficient of the PMT is - 0. 320 (± 0. 033) %/^∘C, and the coefficient of the plastic scintillator bar is - 0. 036 (± 0. 038) %/^∘C. This result means that after subtracting the FEE pedestal, the variation of the signal amplitude of the PMT-scintillator system due to temperature mainly comes from the PMT, and the plastic scintillator bar is not sensitive to temperature over the operating range. Since the temperature effect cannot be ignored, the temperature dependence of the whole PSD has been also studied and a correction has been made to minimize this effect. The correction result shows that the effect of temperature on the signal amplitude of the PSD system can be suppressed. Comment: 9 pages, 9 figure...|$|R

The electronics has also been adopted by the EMCal detector of ALICE with the same APD readout, but operated at an ambient temperature of + 20 C and with a shaping time of 100 ns. The CR-RC 2 signal shapers on the FEE cards are implemented in discrete logic on a 10 -layer board with two shaper sections for each input channel. The two shaper sections with gain ratio of 16 : 1 are digitized by 10 -bit ADCs and provide an effective dynamic range of 14 bits.

40|$|The ALICE Time Projection Chamber (TPC) is {{the main}} {{tracking}} detector of the central barrel of the ALICE (A Large Ion Collider) Experiment at the Large Hadron Collider (LHC), being constructed at CERN, Geneva. It is a 88 m$^{ 3 }$ cylinder filled with gas and divided into two drift regions by the central electrode located at its axial center. The readout chambers of the TPC are multi-wire proportional chambers with cathode pad readout. About 570 000 pads are read-out by an electronics chain of amplification, digitalization and pre-processing. One of the challenges in designing the TPC for ALICE is the design of <b>Front</b> <b>End</b> Electronics (<b>FEE)</b> {{to cope with the}} data rates and the channel occupancy. The Readout Control Unit (RCU), which is presented in this work, is designed to control and monitor the <b>Front</b> <b>End</b> Electronics, and to collect and ship data to the High Level Trigger and the Data Acquisition System, via the Detector Data Link (DDL - optical fibre). The RCU must be capable of reading out up to 200 Mbytes/s from the <b>Front</b> <b>End</b> Electronics, operating at a maximum of 40 MHz. The handling and distribution of the central trigger and clock signals are done with an incorporated TTCrx chip. Interfacing the front-end electronics with the Detector Control System (DCS) is done via a Slow Control bus. The DCS itself communicates with the control layer via high level protocols running on an Ethernet fieldbus. For the prototype of the Readout Control Unit (RCU) the Altera EP 20 K 400 Field Programmable Gate Array (FPGA) has been used for application specific system integration. Chapter 1 gives an overview of the physics observables and thus defines the requirements for the performance of the ALICE TPC and its FEE. In chapter 2 TPC technologies and their development and use in selected heavy ion experiments are discussed. At the end of the chapter the TPC of the ALICE experiment is presented.

40|$|We present {{details of}} the design for the CCD readout {{electronics}} for the Subaru Telescope Prime Focus Spectrograph (PFS). The spectrograph is comprised of four identical spectrograph modules, each collecting roughly 600 spectra. The spectrograph modules provide simultaneous wavelength coverage over the entire band from 380 nm to 1260 nm {{through the use of}} three separate optical channels: blue, red, and near infrared (NIR). A camera in each channel images the multi-object spectra onto a 4 k x 4 k, 15 um pixel, detector format. The two visible cameras use a pair of Hamamatsu 2 k x 4 k CCDs with readout provided by custom electronics, while the NIR camera uses a single Teledyne HgCdTe 4 k x 4 k detector and ASIC Sidecar to read the device. The CCD readout system is a custom design comprised of three electrical subsystems: the Back End Electronics (BEE), the <b>Front</b> <b>End</b> Electronics (<b>FEE),</b> and a Pre-amplifier. The BEE is an off-the-shelf PC 104 computer, with an auxiliary Xilinx FPGA module. The computer serves as the main interface to the Subaru messaging hub and controls other peripheral devices associated with the camera, while the FPGA is used to generate the necessary clocks and transfer image data from the CCDs. The FEE board sets clock biases, substrate bias, and CDS offsets. It also monitors bias voltages, offset voltages, power rail voltage, substrate voltage and CCD temperature. The board translates LVDS clock signals to biased clocks and returns digitized analog data via LVDS. Monitoring and control messages are sent from the BEE to the FEE using a standard serial interface. The Pre-amplifier board resides behind the detectors and acts as an interface to the two Hamamatsu CCDs. The Pre-amplifier passes clocks and biases to the CCDs, and analog CCD data is buffered and amplified prior to being returned to the FEE. Comment: 14 pages, 15 figures, SPIE ATI 2014, Montrea...|$|R

Emphasis is on display oriented <b>front</b> <b>end</b> interfaces that allow the user to have multiple windows. <b>Front</b> <b>end</b> interlaces can be split into three categories based upon the type of machine the software runs on and how they interface with the programming environment's tools. After presenting these categories, current trends and issues relevant to <b>front</b> <b>end</b> interfaces are discussed. Finally, several <b>front</b> <b>end</b> interfaces are examined in detail and classified according to these categories. ~: This worle {{was supported in part by}} grants from the National Science Foun...|$|R
40|$|Submitted to SIGPLAN Notices for publication. Abstract It is difficult, if not impossible, for {{the code}} analyzers to employ <b>front</b> <b>end</b> from compilers, because these <b>front</b> <b>ends</b> extract {{different}} program information using different strategy. This paper describes our experiences in building C++ <b>front</b> <b>end</b> {{as a part}} of code analysis toolset. The <b>front</b> <b>end</b> customizes the lexical analyzer incorporating a special preprocessing technique to accurately associate program entities with physical source code location. To support analysis of different C++ languages, the <b>front</b> <b>end</b> employs YACC to generate the parser, and uses token lookahead technique to disambiguate C++ grammar for YACC...|$|R

40|$|In {{this paper}} {{we seek to}} {{streamline}} various operations within the <b>front</b> <b>end</b> of a speech recognizer, both to reduce unnecessary computation and to simplify the conceptual framework. First, a novel view of the <b>front</b> <b>end</b> in terms of linear transformations is presented. Then we study the invariance property of recognition performance with respect to linear transformations (LT) at the <b>front</b> <b>end.</b> Analysis reveals that several LT steps can be consolidated into a single LT, which effectively eliminates the Discrete Cosine Transform (DCT) step, part of the traditional MFCC (Mel-Frequency Cepstral Coefficient) <b>front</b> <b>end.</b> Moreover, a highly simplified, data-driven front-end scheme is proposed as a direct generalization of this idea. The new setup has no Mel-scale filtering, {{another part of the}} MFCC <b>front</b> <b>end.</b> Experimental results show a 5 % relative improvement on the Broadcast News task. 1.
