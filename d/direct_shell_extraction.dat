40|$|Clams of {{the species}} Meretrix casta and Paphia malabarica are popular in Mulki estuary mainly for edible purpose, {{targeting}} domestic markets of Mulki and Mangalore. Dried clam shells {{are used in the}} making of lime. In March 2005, due to high natural mortality, the resource formed a layer of dead and live clams near the bar mouth. Large-scale exploitation of these clam shells was observed from the estuary mainly for lime industry. This has generated income for fishers engaged in estuarine fishing activities and they have resorted to organized shell collection. As with other forms of harvesting, the environmental effects of <b>shell</b> <b>extraction</b> largely result from the physical disturbance of the clam bed. Hence, close monitoring of such activities for the exploitation of shell is require...|$|R
50|$|The {{entrance}} tower {{facing the}} town stands above the eastern wall and housed living rooms and, {{on the lowest}} floor, a chapel. To prevent <b>direct</b> <b>shelling</b> of the gates the gateway was constructed in a light curve. The east wing originally consisted of narrow two-floor battlements, the lower floor had open arcades and loop-holes. In 1777 the Baroque, so called Lazarettbau (military hospital) was erected above the eastern foundation walls for the Prussian garrison. The south-eastern bastion was expanded for the museum in 1913. The north-east tower has housed a student club since 1972.|$|R

40|$|In {{this paper}} recent {{experiments}} on nonlinear dynamics of shells are described, such experiments were focused to circular cylindrical shells subjected to axial loads. Different types of axial loads were considered: inertial loads due to rigid bodies {{connected to the}} shell; static and dynamic loads induced by <b>direct</b> <b>shell</b> excitation. The latter type of loading allows to study the effect of pre-compression, which typically induces natural frequency variation and changing of the dynamic scenario. The experiments show an extremely complex dynamic scenario, which needs a deep analysis to be interpreted and explained.

5000|$|The basic minigun is a six-barrel, air-cooled, and {{electrically}} driven {{rotary machine}} gun. The electric drive rotates the weapon within its housing, with a rotating firing pin assembly and rotary chamber. The minigun's multi-barrel design helps prevent overheating, but also serves other functions. Multiple barrels {{allow for a}} greater capacity for a high firing rate, since the serial process of firing/extraction/loading {{is taking place in}} all barrels simultaneously. Thus, as one barrel fires, two others are in different stages of <b>shell</b> <b>extraction</b> and another three are being loaded. The minigun is composed of multiple closed-bolt rifle barrels arranged in a circular housing. The barrels are rotated by an external power source, usually electric, pneumatic, or hydraulic. Other rotating-barrel cannons are powered by the gas pressure or recoil energy of fired cartridges. A gas-operated variant, designated XM133, was also developed. [...] It is nearly identical but has barrels with ports that align with the piston drive {{in the center of the}} barrel cluster. It fired over 3000 rpm but was not put into production.|$|R

It deftly removes the {{operculum}} or [...] "lid" [...] and extracts the snail, seldom breaking the <b>shell.</b> The <b>extraction</b> takes 10 to 20 seconds. The orange-yellow yolk gland of female snails is usually shaken loose and not eaten. It often leaves piles of empty shells at favored spots.|$|R
30|$|All {{patients}} were treated in supine position and immobilised with Beam <b>Directed</b> <b>Shell</b> (BDS). Planning CT scan was fused with post operative MRI scan to delineate tumour volume. Gross Tumour Volume (GTV) {{was defined as}} all visible tumour on post operative MRI scan and planning CT scan. Clinical Target Volume (CTV) was created by adding a 15  mm margin to the GTV. CTV to Planning Treatment Volume (PTV) margin was 5  mm. The prescribed dose was 54  Gy in 30 fractions (1.8  Gy per fraction). The radiation was delivered by a linear accelerator with energy of 6  MV. Patients were assessed for side effects and compliance with treatment {{on a weekly basis}} during therapy. Patients underwent 3 monthly follow-up MRI scans in the first year and then 6 monthly thereafter.|$|R
50|$|It has {{the ability}} to eject the empty shells out of either in the right side or left side for ambidextrous operation. The bolt has seven lugs and an {{extractor}} on the left and right, with no ejector. The extractors are spring-loaded and which way cases are ejected is selected by pressing a case through a small hole located past the port. It is small and optimized for the tip of a bullet to fit. The ejection port is open on both sides and <b>directs</b> <b>shells</b> at a 45 degree angle from the barrel. The cocking lever is on the bolt carrier and can be positioned on either side by pulling it out, swinging it through the ejection port, and pushing it in to secure it in place.|$|R

40|$|The {{increase}} in human induced atmospheric CO 2 level {{leads to an}} {{increase in}} ocean acidification (OA). Mitigation of this increase by storage of CO 2 in abandoned marine oil and gas reservoirs is seen as an interesting cost effective solution. However, this involves a risk of CO 2 loss causing localised reductions in seawater pH. In this paper we report on the effects of CO 2 enhancement on the growth of the bivalve Cerastoderma edule in mesocosms. The experiments show significant reductions in shell length, shell weight and cockle flesh dry weight at increased CO 2 level suggesting both <b>direct</b> (<b>shell</b> erosion) and indirect (metabolic) effects. Indirect effects were analysed and interpreted using a Dynamic Energy Budget model by describing changes in 3 metabolic processes: assimilation, maintenance, and growth. Based on cockle size data only we could not differentiate between these processes, however, by using variability of DEB parameter values in 11 bivalve species, we showed growth to be the least relevant process...|$|R
5000|$|In the 1990s Shell {{decided that}} Lensbury {{should be seen}} not as {{exclusively}} a [...] "staff benefit" [...] but as a [...] "profit centre". Driven by the Shell Group's new Chairman J.S. Jennings, and implemented by the new Chairman of the Club, Clive Mather, changes were instituted that were designed first to reduce and then to eliminate Shell's subsidy. This meant that the decision that had been taken in 1974 to make Lensbury a members club without <b>direct</b> <b>Shell</b> involvement was reversed and all the members committees were abolished. The club became a subsidiary like any of Shell's other assets and like them it {{was defined as a}} business whose goal was to maximise its profits. A plan was proposed by members that would have achieved this objective whilst retaining the essential character of the club (including all the team sports) but this was rejected by the Shell directors. Instead they insisted on drastic changes to the club's raison d'être.|$|R
5000|$|Shell {{managed to}} get into a {{conflict}} based on foreign traditions inviting top leaders in 10 countries like Iraq, uae, Qatar, Kuwait, Malaysia, US, Australia [...]. Etc after <b>directing</b> <b>Shell's</b> employees to defame them publicly on the internet and among people. The conflict ended with settlement ensuring right and wrong was applied and justice was served. The issue was revisited later on by one of Shell's Evps to make sure the offenders(of both defaming and stealing) were substituted. They depended on one of the technicians in the Engineering Department in University of Aberdeen (the spheres technician that managed to glue some spheres in a conduit - Grant). The issue was escalated and the University was involved trying to make a gain for the offenders which was discussed by a group of the employees and their management in the Engineering department. Traditionally, in all locations the right owners have to attend the gathering to make sure that their rights and decisions are intact. Unfortunately, this did not happen and the issue is still on hold. This is referenced to Royal Dutch Shell Dubai Offices.|$|R
50|$|Numerous {{methods are}} used in the {{production}} of Pacific oysters.

40|$|A {{high-performance}} Fortran code {{is developed}} {{to calculate the}} spin- and parity-dependent shell model nuclear level densities. The algorithm {{is based on the}} extension of methods of statistical spectroscopy and implies exact calculation of the first and second Hamiltonian moments for different configurations at fixed spin and parity. The proton-neutron formalism is used. We have applied the method for calculating the level densities for a set of nuclei in the sd-, pf-, and pf+g 9 / 2 - model spaces. Examples of the calculations for 28 Si (in the sd-model space) and 64 Ge (in the pf+g 9 / 2 -model space) are presented. To illustrate the power of the method we estimate the ground state energy of 64 Ge in the larger model space pf+g 9 / 2, which is not accessible to <b>direct</b> <b>shell</b> model diagonalization due to the prohibitively large dimension, by comparing with the nuclear level densities at low excitation energy calculated in the smaller model space pf.
