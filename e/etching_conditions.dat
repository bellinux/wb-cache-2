40|$|Recently, metal-assisted {{chemical}} etching (MaCE) {{has been proposed}} as a promising method for micro- and nanostructures fabrication on silicon (Si) with high aspect ratio, high geometric uniformity and low cost. In MaCE, electron holes (h+) are injected into Si through catalytic reduction of H 2 O 2 on metal catalyst thin film patterns. Si beneath the metal is etched through a redox reaction where h+ are involved. This work investigated a fundamental electrochemical process during MaCE: the transport of h+, and revealed its unique correlation with the 3 D profile of the etching results. It is discovered that under the uniform <b>etching</b> <b>condition,</b> <b>etching</b> occurs both in the Si beneath the catalysts {{as well as on}} the sidewall of the etched space. On N-type Si, the sidewall etching is intrinsically depressed, and highly vertical HAR structures are formed; on P-type Si and undoped Si, the sidewall tapering becomes significant as the pattern number and density increase. The variation of the 3 D profile can be explained by the CT during etching using a Schottky junction model, which show dependence on the intrinsic properties of the Si. CT involved in the two etching process can further be correlated by diffusion or drift of h+, which explains the influence of catalysts geometry. © The Author(s) 2015. Published by ECS.
