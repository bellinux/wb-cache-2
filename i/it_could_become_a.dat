5|$|In 2012, the Fleur-de-Lys Administrative Committee and the Birkirkara Local Council {{announced}} that they were planning to rebuild the arch to the same dimensions of the original. The police force had initially objected to the project, believing <b>it</b> <b>could</b> <b>become</b> <b>a</b> traffic hazard, but of similar risk comparisons to other monumental arches and gates in Malta, such as the Portes de Bombes. The plans were eventually approved by the Malta Environment and Planning Authority in October of the same year, but they were placed on hold since a tender appeal had to be sorted out. In April 2013, the tender was awarded to Vaults Ltd instead of V Contractors who had originally won the tender. The replica arch cost €280,000 to build, and €100,000 of these were donated by the Bank of Valletta. €40,000 {{were taken from the}} Good Causes Fund, while the remaining €140,000 were paid by the Birkirkara Local Council.|$|E

25|$|When Congress {{passed the}} Second Organic Act in 1912, Alaska was reorganized, and renamed the Territory of Alaska. By 1916, its {{population}} was about 58,000. James Wickersham, a Delegate to Congress, introduced Alaska's first statehood bill, but it failed {{due to the}} small population and lack of interest from Alaskans. Even President Warren G.

The most populous of the divisions, whose capital was Juneau, wondered if <b>it</b> <b>could</b> <b>become</b> <b>a</b> separate state from the other three. Government control was a primary concern, with the territory having 52 federal agencies governing it.|$|E

25|$|North American beavers {{were also}} {{released}} in Finland in 1937, {{before it was}} realized that they formed a separate species. (Eurasian beavers had been extirpated from the region, so the release {{was intended as a}} reintroduction project.) By 1999, it was estimated that 90% of beavers in Finland were the American species. The species is not considered invasive, as in Europe it has a similar keystone effect to European beavers, which have not recolonized the area. The beaver population has been controlled by issuing hunting licenses. A report in 2010 concluded that while the current population was not problematic, as the species has larger litters than European beavers and builds somewhat larger dams, <b>it</b> <b>could</b> <b>become</b> <b>a</b> problem if its range continues expanding into Russia, but this {{does not seem to be}} taking place.|$|E
25|$|Ashot III's {{official}} investiture as king of Armenia {{took place}} in 961, following the relocation of the Holy See from Vaspurakan to Argina, {{near the city of}} Ani. In attendance were several contingents of the Armenian military, 40 bishops, the king of Caucasian Albania, as well as Catholicos Anania Mokatsi who crowned the king with the title of shahanshah. In that same year, Ashot had also relocated the capital from Kars to Ani. The Bagratuni kings had never chosen a city to settle in, alternating from Bagaran to Shirakavan to Kars; Kars never did reach a status where <b>it</b> <b>could</b> <b>become</b> <b>a</b> capital and Dvin was disregarded altogether, given its proximity to the hostile emirates. Ani's natural defenses were well suited Ashot's desire to secure an area which could withstand siege and fell on a trade route that passed from Dvin to Trebizond.|$|E
25|$|Meanwhile, the Upper Avon Navigation between Stratford and Evesham {{was owned}} by {{relatives}} of Lord Windsor, {{who had died in}} 1758, and its condition gradually deteriorated. Because of the sinuous course of the upper river, it was never really considered as a through navigation, except for a brief period when William James thought <b>it</b> <b>could</b> <b>become</b> <b>a</b> through route. He bought all of the shares in the Upper Avon company in 1813, and persuaded the Stratford Canal shareholders {{that there should be a}} junction between their canal and the river at Stratford, which was opened on 24 June 1816. In 1822, he spent £6,000 repairing the locks on the upper river, and became bankrupt. The navigation was taken over by seven men, all connected with the Stratford Canal, who turned Lucy's lock at Stratford into a two-rise staircase lock, constructed three new locks, and improved the river by dredging. Most of the subsequent traffic was local, competing with the Lower Avon for the delivery of coal to Evesham. The Upper Avon was leased to the Stratford Canal from 1842, but there was little traffic, and the lease was not renewed in 1847. The arrival of the Oxford, Worcester and Wolverhampton Railway at Stratford sealed its fate, and when the company failed to sell the navigation to local landowners for £150, they effectively abandoned it in 1857. John Broughton, who was the railway manager at Stratford, was persuaded to buy the navigation for £300 by local traders, but the venture was short-lived. Broughton was succeeded, and the railway, now called the West Midland Railway, became part of the Great Western Railway. In 1875, the GWR decided it would no longer maintain the river, and an appeal to the Railway Commissioners in 1877 ruled that they were not obliged to do so.|$|E

5000|$|Until {{the middle}} of the 19th century, {{psychology}} was widely regarded as a branch of philosophy. Whether <b>it</b> <b>could</b> <b>become</b> <b>an</b> independent scientific discipline was questioned already earlier on: Immanuel Kant (1724-1804) declared in his Metaphysical Foundations of Natural Science (1786) that psychology might perhaps never <b>become</b> <b>a</b> [...] "proper" [...] natural science because its phenomena cannot be quantified, among other reasons. Kant proposed an alternative conception of an empirical investigation of human thought, feeling, desire, and action, and lectured on these topics for over twenty years (1772/73-1795/96). His Anthropology from a Pragmatic Point of View (1798), which resulted from these lectures, looks like an empirical psychology in many respects.|$|R
