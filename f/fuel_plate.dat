40|$|It {{has been}} {{observed}} that during irradiation of a dispersion <b>fuel</b> <b>plate,</b> fuel/matrix interactions can impact the overall <b>fuel</b> <b>plate</b> performance. To continue {{the investigation of the}} irradiation performance of Si-rich fuel/matrix interaction layers, RERTR- 6 <b>fuel</b> <b>plate</b> V 1 R 010 (U- 10 Mo/ 6061 Al) was characterized using scanning electron microscopy. This <b>fuel</b> <b>plate</b> was of particular interest because of its similarities to <b>fuel</b> <b>plate</b> R 1 R 010, which had U- 7 Mo particles dispersed in 6061 Al. Both fuel plates were irradiated as part of the RERTR- 6 experiment and saw very similar irradiation conditions. R 1 R 010 was characterized in another study and was observed to form relatively uniform Si-rich layers during fabrication that remained stable during irradiation. Since U- 10 Mo does not interact as much with 6061 Al at high temperatures to form layers, it was of interest to characterize a <b>fuel</b> <b>plate</b> with these particles since it would allow for a comparison of fuel plates with different amounts of preirradiation interaction zone formation, which were then exposed to similar irradiation conditions. This paper demonstrates how the lower amount of interaction layer development in V 1 R 010 during fabrication appears to impact the overall performance of the <b>fuel</b> <b>plate,</b> such that it does not behave as well as R 1 R 010 in terms of interaction layer stability. Additionally, {{the results of this study}} are applied to improve the understanding of fuel/cladding interactions in monolithic fuel plates that consist of U- 10 Mo foils encased in 6061 Al cladding...|$|E
40|$|The {{starting}} microstructure of a <b>fuel</b> <b>plate</b> {{will impact}} how it performs during irradiation. As a result, microstructural characterization has been performed on as-fabricated monolithic fuel plates {{to determine the}} changes in <b>fuel</b> <b>plate</b> microstructure that may result from changes in fabrication parameters.

In addition, burnable absorber materials for potential incorporation into monolithic fuel plates have been characterized to identify their as-fabricated microstructures. This information will be important when trying to understand the PIE data from fuel plates with burnable absorbers that are irradiated in future irradiation experiments.

40|$|In 2004 the Global Threat Reduction Initiative (GTRI) was {{established}} by the National Nuclear Security Administration (NNSA) to quickly identify, secure, remove and/or closely monitor nuclear and radiological materials that pose a high-risk threat to the United States and the international community. Part of GTRI's mission is to convert high performance research reactors and isotope production facilities from their current High Enriched Uranium (HEU) fuel to Low Enriched Uranium (LEU) foil based fuel. In compliance with the conversion portion of the GTRI's mission, the University of Missouri Research Reactor (MURR) is currently trying to convert its reactor fuel. The proposed fuel uses a monolithic U- 10 Mo foil meat with a zirconium barrier between the aluminum cladding. This is different than the current HEU fuel meat which is comprised of Uranium dispersed in an aluminum matrix in an aluminum cladding. In addition {{to a change in}} the physical structure of the fuel, the <b>fuel</b> <b>plate</b> thickness has been significantly decreased. The fuel plates in the MURR reactor are subject to high velocity coolant (water) flow. A decreased thickness in the <b>fuel</b> <b>plate</b> suggests that the rigidity of the <b>fuel</b> <b>plate</b> will decrease as well. With concerns about the hydro-mechanical stability of the newly designed <b>fuel</b> <b>plate</b> being exposed to the high velocity flows in the reactor, {{there is a need to}} characterize the structural response of a very thin plate in presence of a velocity flow. Fluid structure interaction (FSI) simulations have been developed to analyze all of the characteristics of a thin <b>fuel</b> <b>plate</b> as the velocity of the water increases across the <b>fuel</b> <b>plate.</b> These models are developed by coupling CFD software, STAR CCM+, with Finite Element Analysis (FEA) software, ABAQUS, to determine the magnitude, location and direction of the deflection of the <b>fuel</b> <b>plate</b> along with other useful metrics to characterize attributes of the flow and movement of the plate. The FSI simulations were designed to replicate the plate thickness, fluid channel geometry and velocities of the experimental set up. The experimental set up consists of a flow loop and curved test section have been constructed for studying plate deflection and channel pressure drop under a variety of fluid flow velocities. The test section consists of two concentric steel cylinders bolted together with spacers between the two to form a fluid channel. The <b>fuel</b> <b>plate</b> inside the test section is clamped at the edges to maintain the axial location of the plate in the fluid channel. The aluminum <b>fuel</b> <b>plate</b> in the test section is 25. 5 inches long, 16 mils (0. 016 inches) thick and has an arc of 45 degrees. The outer cylinder of the test section has five plexi-glass windows that allow deflection data to be collected at various locations by the laser measurement system. The laser measurement system was fixed at the leading edge of the <b>fuel</b> <b>plate</b> because that is where the maximum deflection has been shown to occur. Since the focus of this study is on the maximum deflection of the <b>fuel</b> <b>plate,</b> the laser measurement system was fixed at that point. The FSI simulations were based on seven different geometries. The first consideration was an ideal geometry that the test section was designed to reflect. This consisted of a 130 mils thick inner fluid channel and a 78 mils thick outer fluid channel. Because the test section was assembled at Argonne National Laboratory (ANL) and then shipped to the University of Missouri, the dimensions of the test section fluid channel geometry was altered during transit. This change in the shape of the fluid channels lead to the need to characterize the shape of the <b>fuel</b> <b>plate</b> and fluid channels again. Since it is physically impossible to characterize the geometry of the entire <b>fuel</b> <b>plate</b> and the azimuthal geometry of the fluid channels of the test section without disassembling it, several geometric options were considered. Three geometries for the shape of the <b>fuel</b> <b>plate</b> were considered. The three <b>fuel</b> <b>plate</b> shapes were based on the distance of the plate based on the distance between the inner radius of the outer cylinder and the location of the <b>fuel</b> <b>plate</b> in the fluid channel. These measurements were obtained by measuring the outer channel gap thickness with a depth micrometer at the pressure tap locations that coincide with the location of the plate. Although this was helpful, it only helped to characterize the shape of the plate between the leading and trailing edges of the plate. This left about eight inches of the <b>fuel</b> <b>plate</b> (4 inches at each end) uncharacterized, leading to the three geometric considerations. The three geometric considerations were combined with two geometric considerations for the fluid channels. An azimuthally constant and varied geometry was considered. This was prompted by the inability to measure the distance of the fluid channels in the azimuthal direction due to the design of the test section. This lead to developing a geometry for the fluid channels that was constant along the azimuthal direction of the <b>fuel</b> <b>plate</b> and another where the fluid channel decreased in thickness as the azimuthal location progressed from the middle of the test section to the edges where the spacers are located. The FSI simulations and the experiments produced deflection results for the 16 mils (0. 016 inches) thick <b>fuel</b> <b>plate</b> at velocities ranging from approximately 2 m/s to 4 m/s. Because the <b>fuel</b> <b>plate</b> is so thin, it has been decided that the velocity in the FSI simulations and experiments should be kept relatively low to avoid permanently damaging the aluminum plate in the test section. The As-Built numeric models have been shown to compare well with the experimental results. The As-Built numeric model results also show that the constant azimuthal fluid channel geometry produces a smaller magnitude of deflection for all three <b>fuel</b> <b>plate</b> shapes considered when compared to the models with a varying azimuthal geometry. the FSI simulations "crashed" for all models ran with a velocity beyond 4 m/s. The experimental results showed that maximum deflection results can be obtained beyond 4 m/s. This provides the opportunity to investigate the differences between the experimental and modeling geometries and recalibrate the model to obtain maximum deflection results through the FSI simulations...|$|E

40|$|The first <b>fuel</b> <b>plate</b> frame {{assembly}} of the AFIP- 6 MKII experiment was irradiated as planned from December, 2011 through February, 2012 in the center flux trap of the Advanced Test Reactor during cycle 151 A. Following irradiation in this cycle and while reconfiguring the experiment in the ATR canal, a non-fueled component (the bottom plate) of the first <b>fuel</b> <b>plate</b> {{frame assembly}} became separated from the rail sides. There {{is no evidence that}} the fueled region of the <b>fuel</b> <b>plate</b> frame assembly was compromised by this incident or the irradiation conditions. The separation of this component was determined to have been caused by flow induced vibrations, where vortex shedding frequencies were resonant with a natural frequency of the bottom plate component. This gave way to amplification, fracture, and separation from the assembly. Although parallel flow induced vibrations were analyzed, vortex shedding flow induced vibrations was an unfamiliar failure mode that was difficult to identify. Both the once-irradiated first <b>fuel</b> <b>plate</b> and un-irradiated second <b>fuel</b> <b>plate</b> frame assemblies were planned for irradiation in the subsequent cycle 151 B.

40|$|Aluminum (Al) is a {{commonly}} used matrix for research reactor <b>fuel</b> <b>plates.</b> It {{has been found}} that a reaction between the fuel and the aluminum matrix may reduce or increase the irradiation stability of the fuel. To further understand the contribution of the reaction to the irradiation stability, experiments to develop a non-reacting matrix were performed. The work focused on magnesium (Mg), which is an excellent non-reacting matrix candidate and has a neutron absorption coefficient similar to Al. To avoid the formation of a liquid Al/Mg phase, improvements were made to the roll bonding process to achieve acceptable bonding at 415 C.

The results of this work showed the presence of a bubble superlattice within the U- 7 Mo grains that accommodated fission gases (e. g., Xe). The presence of this structure helps the U- 7 Mo exhibit a stable swelling behaviour during irradiation. Furthermore, TEM analysis showed that the Si-rich interaction layers that develop around the fuel particles at the U- 7 Mo/matrix interface during <b>fuel</b> <b>plate</b> fabrication and irradiation become amorphous during irradiation, and in regions of the interaction layer that have relatively high Si concentrations the fission gas bubbles remain small and contained within the layer but in areas with lower Si concentrations the bubbles grow in size.

The total stress, composed of the sum of the flow stress and the thermal stress at a point, could be reduced if the thermal loads tend to relax when the stress magnitude approaches the yield stress of the material. The potential of this occurring would be very significant in assessing the structural reliability of the <b>fuel</b> <b>plates</b> and has been investigated through experiment. The results of this investigation are given in this report...|$|R
40|$|Evaluation of the PIE {{results of}} the {{monolithic}} plates that were irradiated {{as part of the}} RERTR- 6 experiment has continued. Specifically, comparisons have been made between the microstructures of the fuel plates before and after irradiation. Using the results from the rigorous characterization that was performed on the as-fabricated plates using scanning electron microscopy, it is possible to improve understanding of how monolithic fuel plates perform when they are irradiated. This paper will discuss the changes that occur, if any, in the microstructure of a monolithic <b>fuel</b> <b>plate</b> that is fabricated using techniques like what were employed for fabricating RERTR- 6 fuel plates. In addition, the performance of fuel/cladding interaction layers that were present in the fuel plates due to the fabrication process will be discussed, particularly in the context of swelling of these layers and how these layers exhibit different behaviors depending on whether the fuel alloy in the <b>fuel</b> <b>plate</b> is U- 7 Mo or U- 10 Mo...|$|E
40|$|RERTR U-Mo {{dispersion}} fuel plates {{are being developed}} for application in research reactors throughout the world. Of particular interest is the irradiation performance of U-Mo {{dispersion fuel}}s with Si added to the Al matrix. Si is added to improve the performance of U-Mo dispersion fuels. Microstructural examinations have been performed on fuel plates with Al- 2 Si matrix after irradiation to around 50 % LEU burnup. Si-rich layers were observed in many areas around the various U- 7 Mo fuel particles. In one local area {{of one of the}} samples, where the Si-rich layer had developed into a layer devoid of Si, relatively large fission gas bubbles were observed in the interaction phase. There may be a connection between the growth of these bubbles and the amount of Si present in the interaction layer. Overall, it was found that having Si-rich layers around the fuel particles after <b>fuel</b> <b>plate</b> fabrication positively impacted the overall performance of the <b>fuel</b> <b>plate...</b>|$|E
40|$|This report {{documents}} {{a detailed}} {{evaluation of the}} swaging process used to connect fuel plates to side plates in Advanced Test Reactor (ATR) fuel elements. The swaging is a mechanical process that begins with fitting a <b>fuel</b> <b>plate</b> into grooves in the side plates. Once a <b>fuel</b> <b>plate</b> is positioned, a lip on each of two side plate grooves is pressed into the <b>fuel</b> <b>plate</b> using swaging wheels to form the joints. Each connection must have a specified strength (measured in terms, of a pullout force capacity) to assure that these joints do not fail during reactor operation. The {{purpose of this study}} is to analyze the swaging process and associated procedural controls, and to provide recommendations to assure that the manufacturing process produces swaged connections that meet the minimum strength requirement. The current fuel element manufacturer, Babcock and Wilcox (B&W) of Lynchburg, Virginia, follows established procedures that include quality inspections and process controls in swaging these connections. The procedures have been approved by Lockheed Martin Idaho Technologies and are designed to assure repeatability of the process and structural integrity of each joint. Prior to July 1994, ATR fuel elements were placed in the Hydraulic Test Facility (HTF) at the Idaho National Engineering Laboratory (AGNAIL), Test Reactor Area (TRA) for application of Boehmite (an aluminum oxide) film and for checking structural integrity before placement of the elements into the ATR. The results presented in this report demonstrate that the pullout strength of the swaged connections is assured by the current manufacturing process (with several recommended enhancements) without the need for- testing each element in the HTF...|$|E
40|$|The reactor for {{the planned}} Advanced Neutron Source will use closely spaced arrays of <b>fuel</b> <b>plates.</b> The plates are thin {{and will have}} a core {{containing}} enriched uranium silicide fuel clad in aluminum. The heat load caused by the nuclear reactions within the <b>fuel</b> <b>plates</b> will be removed by flowing high-velocity heavy water through narrow channels between the plates. However, the plates will still be at elevated temperatures while in service, {{and the potential for}} excessive plate deformation because of creep must be considered.
