The light blue lines indicate the <b>isopleths</b> {{as we would}} normally encounter them, confined to a two-dimensional plane. The dark blue curves show the actual locations of the <b>isopleths</b> in three dimensions. Thus, the light blue lines are simply the projections of the <b>isopleths</b> in three-dimensional space onto a two-dimensional plane. Again, recall that an isopleth is just a titration curve—that is, the path that is traced if pH is varied while PCO2 is held constant. The green surface describes all combinations of PCO2, HCO3− and pH that satisfy equilibrium for the system. All <b>isopleths</b> in their actual three-dimensional orientations must be confined to this surface.|$|E

40|$|In the HHRA, EPA {{has defined}} the {{exposure}} areas (EAs) for the direct contact scenarios as those areas, within a parcel {{or group of}} parcels, which are bounded by the water’s edge and the 1 ppm <b>isopleth.</b> This approach is reasonable for those areas where the specific activity being evaluated is expected to occur only within the 1 ppm <b>isopleth</b> or when the activity within the 1 ppm <b>isopleth</b> {{is expected to continue}} {{for an extended period of}} time during each day of exposure. In these cases, it is reasonable to assume that the majority of the soil contacted or ingested during that activity would be derived solely from within the 1 ppm <b>isopleth.</b> For example, an individual who is fishing on the edge of Woods Pond is likely to spend a substantial portion of the day there and would likely remain close to the river (i. e., within the 1 ppm <b>isopleth)</b> during all the time spent there. Thus, even if the 1 ppm <b>isopleth</b> is a very small portion of the area around Woods Pond, it is reasonable to expect that all of the soil contacted or ingested during that activity would be derived from the 1 ppm <b>isopleth.</b> There are numerous other areas/activities, however, for which this approach is not reasonable. For example, at EA 29, to which the HHRA assigns a general recreational scenario, it appears that less than 10 percent of Parcel K 3 - 1 - 1, on which EA 29 is located, is included in the 1 pp...|$|R

40|$|Interpolation {{procedures}} used in <b>isopleth</b> mapping are {{closely tied to}} methods of areal interpolation, which is a technique used to transfer attribute information from source zones with known values to the target zones with unknown values. This research first presents and describes new local polycategorical methods for solving areal interpolation problems. Two different types of local neighborhoods for selecting observations used to estimate density coefficients are presented: one spatially based and one statistically based. The new local polycategorical methods are evaluated against a number of existing methods. Results suggest that polycategorical methods provide comparable results to the local statistical areal interpolation models, especially with enhanced land cover data sets, but with much less computational requirements. Remotely sensed land cover data are widely used as control data in intelligent areal interpolation methods. This research then examines the usefulness of different publicly available remotely sensed land cover data sets as control data {{used in conjunction with}} different areal interpolation methods. Results show that greater detail in the land use classification of developed areas was important for areal interpolation. Even more important is the further enhancement of remotely sensed land cover categories by incorporating local road or parcel data layers. Overall weaker methods using enhanced remote sensing-derived land cover data produce more accurate results than overall stronger methods using only the original land cover data. The results also show that parcels produce better enhancements than road buffers Finally, this research reunites areal interpolation with the <b>isopleth</b> mapping process to construct intelligent <b>isopleth</b> maps. Two types of interpolated population density surfaces are used as inputs for pycnophylactic smoothing procedures, one is target zone population density surface and the other is control zone population density surface. Results suggest that control zone population density surface-derived <b>isopleth</b> maps has more peaks and variations in population distributions than target zone population density surface-derived <b>isopleth</b> maps. And intelligent <b>isopleth</b> maps with control data are better than simple <b>isopleth</b> map derived from areal weighting results. Furthermore, intelligent <b>isopleth</b> maps based on parcel enhanced land cover data sets have less overall error values than those derived from land cover data sets without any enhancement...|$|R
40|$|Abstract. Thematic map {{effectiveness}} can {{be defined}} {{only in terms of}} specific user require-ments. Consideration of common requirements results in four criteria by which map effective-ness is evaluated: effectiveness for direct acquisition of both specific and general information and for memory of both specific and general information. The influence of visual map complexity and two methods of symbolization (choropleth and shaded <b>isopleth</b> maps) on each aspect of complexity is evaluated. Though <b>isopleth</b> maps prove to be consistently less complex than choropleth maps, the only significant difference in effectiveness between the methods is for memory of general patterns, in which case <b>isopleth</b> maps are more effective. Map complexity is found to have two components that influence effectiveness in quite different ways. Complexity of a mapped distribution is inversely related to effectiveness of maps in communicating general patterns but has little relation to communication of specific details. The second aspect of com-plexity, the number of classes, is inversely related to communication of specific details but exhibits little relationship to communication of general patterns.

40|$|Employing a multi-year radar {{database}} of precipitation in a mid-Atlantic coast region, {{the authors have}} characterized rain cell size statistics. The measurements were made with a high resolution, high power radar in which equicircle diameter contours of resolutions of 1 km and greater were identified out to ranges of 100 km from the radar. The rain cell was constructed by its core intensity <b>isopleth</b> and a family of enveloping contours having defined rain rate intervals in the regions between them. The <b>isopleth</b> statistics were extracted from a culled database whose cores had intensities of RLN = 7 (18 - 24 mm/h) and greater. This implies a bias of the statistics toward various types of convective rains generally associated with thunderstorms in the mid-Atlantic coast. Since the radar measurements {{were made in the}} mid-Atlantic coast region, the <b>isopleth</b> statistics may not be directly applicable to other geographic regions (such as the tropics) ...|$|R
50|$|T-LoCoH (time local convex hull) is an {{enhanced}} version of LoCoH which incorporates time {{into the home}} range construction. Time is incorporated into the algorithm via an alternative measure of 'distance', called time scaled distance (TSD), which combines the spatial distance and temporal distance between any two points. This presumes that each point has a time stamp associated with it, as with GPS data. T-LoCoH uses TSD rather than Euclidean distance to identify each point's nearest neighbors, resulting in hulls that are localized in both space and time. Hulls are then sorted and progressively unioned into <b>isopleths.</b> Like LoCoH, UDs created by T-LoCoH generally {{do a good job}} modeling sharp edges in habitat such as water bodies; in addition T-LoCoH <b>isopleths</b> can delineate temporal partitions of space use. T-LoCoH also offers additional sorting options for hulls, allowing it to generate <b>isopleths</b> that differentiate internal space by both intensity of use (the conventional UD) and a variety of behavioral proxies, including directionality and time use metrics.|$|E

50|$|A second key {{concept is}} that {{movement}} along a buffer line must correspond {{to a change}} in PCO2. Thus, like the <b>isopleths,</b> the buffer line as drawn on a typical Davenport Diagram (e.g., Fig 6) is actually the projection of a line existing in three-dimensional space onto a two-dimensional plane. As with the <b>isopleths,</b> buffer lines in their actual three-dimensional orientation are confined to the surface representing the values of PCO2, HCO3− and pH that satisfy equilibrium for the system. In Fig. 10, the dark red lines are the actual buffer lines in three-dimensional space, while the light red lines are the projections of the buffer lines onto a two-dimensional plane. (We will see later how multiple, parallel buffer lines can be determined for a given system).|$|E
50|$|The sample <b>isopleth</b> {{shown in}} red on the {{nomogram}} {{at the top}} of this article calculates the value of T when S = 7.30 and R = 1.17.

Note that any variable can be calculated from values of the other two, a feature of nomograms that is particularly useful for equations in which a variable cannot be algebraically isolated from the other variables.|$|R
50|$|While the Arctic Oscillation has an annular {{structure}} centered {{over and}} covering the entire Arctic, the Arctic dipole anomaly has two poles of opposite sign: {{one over the}} Canadian Arctic Archipelago and northern Greenland, the other over the Kara and Laptev Seas. This dipole structure leads to a pressure gradient with a zero <b>isopleth</b> oriented from the Bering Strait, across the Arctic to the Greenland and Barents Seas. As a result, anomalous winds are generally directed parallel to the zero <b>isopleth</b> either towards the Greenland and Barents Seas (positive Arctic dipole anomaly) or toward the Bering Strait (negative Arctic dipole anomaly).|$|R

5000|$|The term isogloss (Ancient Greek [...] ísos [...] "equal, similar" [...] and [...] glōssa [...] "tongue, dialect, language") is {{inspired}} by contour lines, or <b>isopleths,</b> such as isobars. However, the isogloss separates rather than connects points. Consequently, it has been proposed for the term heterogloss ( [...] héteros [...] "other") to be used instead.|$|E
50|$|The {{buffer line}} {{can be used to}} predict the result of varying the PCO2 within a range close to the {{experimentally}} determined points. Additionally, for each experimental point, a titration experiment can be performed in which pH is varied while PCO2 is held constant, and titration curves can be generated for each of the partial pressure of carbon dioxide (Fig. 7). In the Davenport Diagram, these titration curves are called <b>isopleths,</b> because they are generated at a fixed partial pressure of carbon dioxide.|$|E
50|$|Other {{types of}} {{graphical}} calculators such as intercept charts, trilinear diagrams and hexagonal charts are sometimes called nomograms.

50|$|An emagram {{is one of}} four {{thermodynamic}} diagrams used {{to display}} temperature lapse rate and moisture content profiles in the atmosphere. The emagram has axes of temperature (T) and pressure (p). In the emagram, the dry adiabats make an angle of about 45 degrees with the isobars, isotherms are vertical and <b>isopleths</b> of saturation mixing ratio are almost straight and vertical. Usually, temperature and dew point data from radiosondes are plotted on these diagrams to allow calculations of convective stability or Convective Available Potential Energy. Wind barbs are often plotted at the side of a tephigram to indicate the winds at different heights.|$|E
50|$|The {{product of}} the {{calculations}} is usually a set of <b>isopleths</b> or mapped contour lines either in plan view or cross sectional view. Typically these might be stated as concentrations of carbon monoxide, total reactive hydrocarbons, oxides of nitrogen, particulate or benzene. The air quality scientist can run the model successively to study techniques of reducing adverse air pollutant concentrations (for example, by redesigning roadway geometry, altering speed controls or limiting certain types of trucks). The model is frequently utilized in an Environmental Impact Statement involving a major new roadway or land use change which will induce new vehicular traffic.|$|E
50|$|The major use for skew-T log-P {{diagrams}} is the plotting of radiosonde soundings, {{which give}} a vertical {{profile of the}} temperature and dew point temperature throughout the troposphere and lower stratosphere.

Many skew-T log-P diagrams also include a vertical representation of the wind speed and direction using wind barbs. Important atmospheric characteristics such as saturation, atmospheric instability, and wind shear are critical in severe weather forecasting, by which skew-T log-P diagrams allow quick visual analysis.|$|E
40|$|High-elevation {{regions in}} the United States lack {{detailed}} atmospheric wet-deposition data. The National Atmospheric Deposition Program/ National Trends Network (NADP/NTN) measures and reports precipitation amounts and chemical constituent concentration and deposition data for the United States on annual <b>isopleth</b> maps using inverse distance weighted (IDW) interpolation methods. This interpolation for unsampled areas {{does not account for}} topographic influences. Therefore, NADP/NTN <b>isopleth</b> maps lack detail and potentially underestimate wet deposition in high-elevation regions. The NADP/NTN wet-deposition maps may be improved using precipitation grids generated by other networks. The Parameter-elevation Regressions on Independent Slopes Model (PRISM) produces digital grids of precipitation estimates from many precipitation-monitoring networks and incorporates influences of topographical and geographical features. Because NADP/NTN ion concentrations do not vary with elevation as much as precipitation depths, PRISM is used with unadjusted NADP/NTN data in this paper to calculate ion wet deposition in complex terrain to yield more accurate and detailed <b>isopleth</b> deposition maps in complex terrain. PRISM precipitation estimates generally exceed NADP/NTN precipitation estimates for coastal and mountainous {{regions in the}} western United States. NADP/NTN precipitation estimates generally exceed PRISM precipitation estimates for leeward mountainous regions in Washington, Oregon, and Nevada, where abrupt changes in precipitation depths induced by topography are not depicted by IDW interpolation. PRISM-based deposition estimates for nitrate can exceed NADP/NTN estimates by more than 100 % for mountainous regions in the western United States...|$|R

He is mainly remembered for his melting phase diagrams of metal alloys, i.e. studying how mixtures of metals melt depending on the relative amounts of the components, which is important for metallurgy. Roozeboom also was the first to plot ternary phase equilibria in two-dimensional plots that were taken as vertical or horizontal slices from the three-dimensional solid diagrams. These are termed, respectively, <b>isopleths</b> and isotherms. He also contributed to the science of chiral substances, clarified how to distinguish the different types of crystalline racemates and predicted how mixtures of enantiomers behave in a heterogeneous system of solid and solution.|$|E
40|$|Stock-rebuilding time <b>isopleths</b> relate {{constant}} {{levels of}} fishing mortality (F), stock biomass, and management goals to rebuilding times for overfished stocks. We used simulation models with uncertainty about FMSY and variability in annual intrinsic growth rates (ry) to calculate rebuilding time <b>isopleths</b> for Georges Bank yellowtail flounder, Limanda ferruginea, and cowcod rockfish, Sebastes levis, in the Southern California Bight. Stock-rebuilding time distributions from stochastic models were variable and right-skewed, indicating that rebuilding may take less or substantially {{more time than}} expected. The probability of long rebuilding times increased with lower biomass, higher F, uncertainty about FMSY, and autocorrelation in ry values. Uncertainty about FMSY had the greatest effect on rebuilding times. Median recovery times from simulations were insensitive to model assumptions about uncertainty and variability, suggesting that median recovery times {{should be considered in}} rebuilding plans. <b>Isopleths</b> calculated in previous studies by deterministic models approximate median, rather than mean, rebuilding times. Stochastic models allow managers to specify and evaluate the risk (measured as a probability) of not achieving a rebuilding goal according to schedule. Rebuilding time <b>isopleths</b> can be used for stocks with a range of life histories and can be based on any type of population dynamics model. They are directly applicable with constant F rebuilding plans but are also useful in other cases. We used new algorithms for simulating autocorrelated process errors from a gamma distribution and evaluated sensitivity to statistical distributions assumed for ry.
