5|$|Morton soon {{gained a}} {{reputation}} as a strong advocate for allowing free enterprise and business to take precedence over planning controls and <b>government</b> <b>regulation.</b> His time as Minister was marked by increasing strains on state infrastructure and his pro-development stance was largely attributed as an attempt to alleviate these problems. Despite this, Morton and his State Planning Authority were continuously criticised for not being totally accountable to the public, particularly as the pro-business Sydney Commissioners worked side-by-side with the Planning authority to increase developments in the Sydney CBD to their highest levels ever, embodied by the construction of the MLC Centre, the demolition of the Theatre Royal, Sydney and the Australia Hotel. Among the most controversial schemes planned by his government were also a massive freeway system that was planned to be driven through the hearts of historic inner-city suburbs including Glebe and Newtown and an equally ambitious scheme of 'slum clearance' that would have brought about the wholescale destruction of the historic areas of Woolloomooloo and The Rocks. This eventually culminated in the 1970s Green ban movement led by Unions Leader Jack Mundey, to protect the architectural heritage of Sydney.|$|E
5|$|Stossel {{has written}} three books. Give Me a Break: How I Exposed Hucksters, Cheats, and Scam Artists and Became the Scourge of the Liberal Media is a 2005 {{autobiography}} from Harper Perennial documenting {{his career and}} philosophical transition from liberalism to libertarianism. It describes his opposition to <b>government</b> <b>regulation,</b> his belief in free market and private enterprise, support for tort reform, and advocacy for shifting social services from the government to private charities. It was a New York Times bestseller for 11 weeks. Myths, Lies, and Downright Stupidity: Get Out the Shovel– Why Everything You Know Is Wrong, {{which was published in}} 2007 by Hyperion, questions the validity of various conventional wisdoms, and argues that the belief he is conservative is untrue. On April 10, 2012, Threshold Editions, an imprint of Simon & Schuster, published Stossel's third book No, They Can't: Why Government Fails– But Individuals Succeed. It argues that government policies meant to solve problems instead produce new ones, and that free individuals and the private sector perform tasks more efficiently than the government does.|$|E

This paper presents an integrated supply chain model for simultaneous strategic and operational planning of a strategic business unit (SBU) in a global supply chain affected by <b>government</b> <b>regulations.</b> The model incorporates impact of changes in cost of inputs on expected product cost and solves for an optimal strategic and operational plan for the entire supply chain. In addition, the model includes exchange rates, border crossing costs and solves a multi-period model with due consideration of uncertainties in demand and transportation time.

40|$|The main {{objective}} of this thesis was to research whether or not books used in teaching pupils in schools took into consideration {{the aims of the}} Norwegian <b>government</b> <b>regulations</b> and the theory of multiple intelligences, which coincide in several aspects. In order to do achieve this objective, two books used in teaching pupils in the first year English in the programmes for general studies were analysed based on criteria of the <b>government</b> <b>regulations</b> and principles for teaching through framework based on the theory of multiple intelligences. On the basis of these analyses, this thesis revealed a discrepancy between the aims provided by the <b>government</b> <b>regulations</b> and the principles of the theory of multiple intelligences {{and the extent to which}} the books reflected these aims. The principal conclusion was that the analysed books only took into consideration a few of the intelligences and did not provide pupils with adapted learning, thus showed little consideration for the aims in the <b>government</b> <b>regulations</b> and the theory of multiple intelligences...|$|R
