40|$|BRICs {{development}} financing flows have increased significantly {{and are expected}} to become more prominent in the post-crisis era. We investigate the potential implications on the country-allocation of loan commitments and the degree <b>of</b> <b>concessionality</b> using a panel vector autoregression model and single equation dynamic panel estimation. We find that BRICs lend more to LICs with weaker institutions. Land-locked, resource-scarce LICs receive significantly less financing than other resource-rich LICs. The degree <b>of</b> <b>concessionality</b> is negatively correlated with the amount of loans and positively correlated with better institutional indicators suggesting that the higher the risks, the higher the required returns that BRICs expect.

40|$|Under what {{conditions}} should grants be preferred to loans? To answer this question, {{we present a}} simple model Ã  la Krugman (1988) and show that, for any given level of developmental assistance, the optimal degree <b>of</b> loan <b>concessionality</b> is positively associated with economic growth if countries are poor, have bad policies, and high debt obligations. We then test our model by estimating a modified growth model for a panel of developing countries, and find evidence supporting our predictions. Finally, we assess the determinants of current aid allocations and find that the degree <b>of</b> <b>concessionality</b> is negatively correlated with countries'' levels of development.

40|$|The paper {{examines}} a {{wide range}} of issues relating to the mix between loans and grants as well as the degree <b>of</b> <b>concessionality</b> <b>of</b> loans. A number of empirical tests are carried out based on annual panel data over 1970 to 1999 for 22 donor countries and 72 recipient countries. Based on the tests, we are able to identify a number of economic and political factors that have influenced donors 2 ̆ 019 past decisions on the grant-loan mix. We also observe that for bilateral donors, past grant-loan mix (and, hence, reflows from past transfers) do not influence the volume of current resource transfers. In addition, we find that loans are better suited than grants in promoting recipient governments budgetary discipline, as is commonly understood in fiscal reform literature. Our tests also show that the rate of official borrowing by the recipients (and, by deduction, the extent of their past debt burden) is positively influenced by the extent <b>of</b> the <b>concessionality</b> <b>of</b> such loans 2 ̆ 014 irrespective of whether it is in the form of subsidized interest rates or longer grace periods. The paper concludes with a review of the circumstances in which grants, soft loans and non-concessional loans might have their respective comparative advantage, as well as a discussion of the need, so as to overcome the negative incentive problems of soft loans, for a typical concessional loan package to be separated into two constituent parts. This would enable the recipient to be given the grant component and the option to take from the non-concessional loan component as much as desired. 2 ̆ 013 aid; ODA; grants; official loans; soft loans; grant element; grace period; bilateral aid; multilateral ai...|$|R
40|$|Scott 1 The {{definition}} of Official Development Assistance (ODA) has for 40 years been the global standard for measuring donor efforts in supporting development co-operation objectives. It {{has provided the}} yardstick for documenting the volume and {{the terms of the}} concessional resources provided, assessing donor performance against their aid pledges and enabling partner countries, civil society and others to hold donors to account. Yet for all its value, the ODA definition has always reflected a compromise between political expediency and statistical reality. It is based on interpretation and consensus and therefore allows for flexibility. It has evolved over the decades, while preserving the original concepts of a definition based on principal developmental motivation, official character and a degree <b>of</b> <b>concessionality.</b> While agreement on the ODA concept was a major achievement, discussion of the appropriateness of this measure has never ended.

40|$|Debate {{about the}} {{effectiveness}} of foreign aid has intensified in recent years, as budgetary pressures on aid have increased in donor countries. Whatever the merits of opposing arguments, the question is: do conventional measures of aid (such as OECD's Net ODA), which lump together grants and loans, accurately reflect true aid flows? The authors analyze the methodological shortcomings of conventional measures of aid and propose a new approach, which measures official aid flows as the sum of grants and the grant-equivalents of official loans (in a new aggregate they call"Effective Development Assistance,"or EDA). They show how results using this conceptually superior measure may differ significantly from conventional aggregates, providing a quite different view on major aid trends. They implement their approach empirically using data on some 40, 000 official loans from the World Bank's DRS database [...] virtually all of the official loans to 133 developing countries from 1975 to 1995. The numerical results underscore several points: 1) The conventional approach has led to systematic overestimates <b>of</b> the <b>concessionality</b> <b>of</b> official loans. This overestimate has increased significantly since the mid- 1980 s. Conventional methods show a rising trend; the new method shows the opposite. 2) Net ODA increasingly overstates the true aid content of official flows, although the divergence between the two approaches is somewhat muted by the rising relative importance of grants over loans in total official flows.
