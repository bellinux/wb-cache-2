5|$|After {{clinching}} {{a spot in}} {{the championship}} game, Tech defeated ACC opponent Duke, then prepared for a game against traditional rival Georgia before heading to Jacksonville for the ACC championship. <b>In</b> <b>the</b> <b>game</b> against Georgia, the No. 16 Yellow Jackets were upset by the unranked Bulldogs, who intercepted Tech quarterback Reggie Ball twice and held him to just 42passing yards <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>game.</b> Georgia's victory marked the sixth consecutive victory in the rivalry and sent Tech into the ACC Championship Game on a down note.|$|E
5|$|After the turnover, Florida State {{received}} {{the ball at}} its 32-yard line with a 2017 lead and 12:08 remaining <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>game.</b> On the first play after the turnover, Rix completed a 51-yard pass to Walker for a first down at the Tech 18-yard line. The three plays that followed netted only three yards, and Beitia was sent into the game to attempt a 35-yard field goal.

5|$|Both coaches {{told the}} media that they {{believed}} their respective teams should play far better {{than they did in}} the National semifinal games if they wanted to win the upcoming game. Coach Smith expressed concerns over Georgetown's shooting ability and feared that Floyd would come out shooting very well from the field. In addition, Smith noted that Ewing would play a large factor <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>game</b> because his defensive presence <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>game</b> limits second chance opportunities for Georgetown's opponents.

Fields was also the recipient of a play that tied for the longest pass play of the game, a 37-yard toss from Reesing halfway through the third quarter. Cornerback and game MVP Aqib Talib came into the game as a receiver several times, but because his appearance <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>game</b> was such an unusual occurrence, the Virginia Tech defense was able {{to zero in on}} him and prevent him from catching the ball.|$|E
