5|$|Walpole {{was born}} in Auckland, New Zealand, the eldest of three {{children}} of the Rev Somerset Walpole and his wife, Mildred Helen, née Barham (1854–1925). Somerset Walpole had been an assistant to the Bishop of Truro, Edward White Benson, from 1877 until 1882, when he was offered the <b>incumbency</b> of St Mary's Pro-Cathedral, Auckland; on Benson's advice he accepted.|$|E
5|$|Gallaher {{was also}} a {{national}} selector from 1907 to 1914, and with George Nicholson co-coached the All Blacks against the 1908 Anglo-Welsh team. A number of Gallaher's team-mates from the 1905–06 tour {{were included in the}} New Zealand squad for the series; of three Tests, the All Blacks won two and drew the other. During Gallaher's <b>incumbency</b> as a national selector, New Zealand played 50 matches, won 44, lost four and drew two. This included 16 Tests, of which only one was lost and two drawn.|$|E
5|$|Voorhis had the {{advantage}} of <b>incumbency,</b> but this was balanced by other factors favoring Nixon. Due to the press of Congressional business, Voorhis was able to devote only two months to the campaign, while Nixon campaigned in the district for ten months. Voorhis's time was further limited when, while en route to California from Washington D.C. in August, he was forced to have surgery for hemorrhoids in Ogden, Utah. He spent two weeks in an Ogden hotel recuperating from the operation.|$|E

5|$|As {{the result}} of a 2015 {{referendum}} in Houston, a mayor is elected for a four-year term, and can be elected to as many as two consecutive terms. The term limits were spearheaded in 1991 by conservative political activist Clymer Wright. During 1991–2015, the city controller and city council members were subjected to a two-year, three-term limitation – the 2015 referendum amended term limits to two four-year terms. As of 2017 some councilmembers who served two terms and won a final term will have served eight years in office, whereas a freshman councilmember who won a position in 2013 can serve up to two additional terms under the previous term limit law – a select few will have at least 10 years of <b>incumbency</b> once their term expires.|$|E
5|$|In {{avoiding}} {{war with}} Great Britain, he guaranteed {{a decade of}} peace and profitable trade by securing the Jay Treaty in 1795, despite intense opposition from the Jeffersonians. He oversaw {{the creation of a}} strong, well-financed national government that maintained neutrality in the French Revolutionary Wars, suppressed the Whiskey Rebellion, and won wide acceptance amongst Americans. Washington's <b>incumbency</b> established many precedents still in use today, such as the cabinet system, the inaugural address, and the title Mr. President. His retirement from office after two terms established a tradition that lasted until 1940 and was later made law by the 22nd Amendment. He remained non-partisan, never joining the Federalist Party, although he largely supported its policies. Washington's Farewell Address was an influential primer on civic virtue, warning against partisanship, sectionalism, and involvement in foreign wars.|$|E
5|$|In the {{aftermath}} of the debate Bentinck resigned the leadership and was succeeded by Lord Granby; Disraeli's own speech, thought by many of his own party to be blasphemous, ruled him out for the time being. While these intrigues played out, Disraeli was working with the Bentinck family to secure the necessary financing to purchase Hughenden Manor, in Buckinghamshire. The possession of a country house, and <b>incumbency</b> of a county constituency were regarded as essential for a Tory with ambitions to lead the party. Disraeli and his wife alternated between Hughenden and several homes in London {{for the rest of their}} marriage. The negotiations were complicated by Bentinck's sudden death on 21 September 1848, but Disraeli obtained a loan of £25,000 from Bentinck's brothers Lord Henry Bentinck and Lord Titchfield.|$|E

5000|$|Warner {{was educated}} at Trinity College, Dublin and ordained in 1926.

5|$|One of {{the more}} populous of the two dozen or so villages which now {{comprise}} the Metropolitan Borough of Gateshead, Low Fell has a long and rich history. In {{stark contrast to the}} industrial development of its near neighbour Sheriff Hill, the settlement at Low Fell developed through the building of a new road to bypass the steep turnpike road which ran through Sheriff Hill, which in turn encouraged both private enterprise (particularly public houses) and the <b>incumbency</b> of dozens of wealthy individuals who built substantial villas in which they could escape the dirt and grime of 19thcentury Newcastle upon Tyne.|$|E
5|$|The nearby vicarage {{dates from}} 1638. The Reverend White Kennett (1660–1728) was vicar of Ambrosden from 1685 until 1708. During his <b>incumbency,</b> Kennett became tutor and vice-principal at St Edmund Hall, Oxford and {{published}} {{a number of}} scholarly works. Kennett was also Rector of St Botolph's Aldgate in London from 1700, Archdeacon of Huntingdon from 1701 and Dean of Peterborough from 1707. It therefore seems likely that Kennett may have been largely absent from Ambrosden in the latter years of his tenure. He relinquished the living of Ambrosden in 1708. Kennett was consecrated Bishop of Peterborough in 1718.|$|E
5|$|Henry Hastings, {{the third}} earl, was a zealous {{promoter}} of puritanism and founded Ashby Grammar School to provide education {{in accordance with}} his religious views. Anthony Gilby had lived in exile in Geneva {{during the reign of}} Mary, but was invited to Ashby by the earl and made the town a nationally important centre for radical Protestantism. Attempts by the church authorities to discipline him failed, and he died after 25 years spent preaching and pamphleteering. Hastings' influence meant that between 1562 and 1632 Ashby had a succession of Puritan ministers. The last of these was Arthur Hildersham, another influential figure who sought to internationalise radical Protestantism, but became vulnerable to the strictures of his bishop after Henry Hastings died in 1595. Hildersham was barred from preaching or deprived of his living for 17 of the 38 years of his <b>incumbency,</b> Earl Henry was interred in St Helen's after a lavish funeral befitting his status as Lord President of the Council of the North.|$|E

5|$|With the {{advantages}} of <b>incumbency</b> and a generally popular record, Garrard garnered large majorities in the state's western counties, Jefferson County, and the Bluegrass region of central Kentucky. Surprisingly, he even found support among some voters who had favored Logan four years earlier. The final voting showed Garrard the winner with 8,390 votes, followed by Greenup with 6,746, Logan with 3,996, and Todd with 2,166. Due to the term limits imposed by the new constitution, Garrard was the last Kentucky governor elected to succeed himself until a 1992 amendment to the state constitution loosened the prohibition on gubernatorial succession, and Paul E. Patton was reelected in 1999. In 1801, Garrard nominated Todd to fill the next vacancy on the Kentucky Court of Appeals after the election. Similarly, he appointed Greenup to {{a position on the}} Frankfort Circuit Court in 1802.|$|E

25|$|In {{the early}} 1960s, during the <b>incumbency</b> of Harry Reynolds Smythe, the present narthex and porch were added, {{as was the}} porch and the Walsingham Shrine of the lady chapel. The narthices of both the church and chapel are of a {{somewhat}} post-modern style (before its time) {{as opposed to the}} Gothic sympathy of the original 1915 building.|$|E
25|$|Historians {{often use}} 1979-80 to date a {{philosophical}} realignment within the American electorate away from Democratic liberalism and toward Reagan Era conservatism. However, some liberals hold a minority view {{that there was}} no real shift and that Kennedy's defeat was merely by historical accident caused by his poor campaign, international crises and Carter's use of the <b>incumbency.</b>|$|E
25|$|In the 1996 state elections, DMK came {{to power}} on {{strength}} of corruption charges against J.Jayalalithaa and the alliance with Tamil Maanila Congress (TMC), headed by G.K. Moopanar and supported by cine actor Rajinikanth. However, in 2001, the AIADMK, on strength of a strong alliance and the <b>incumbency</b> factor against DMK, came back to power in the state assembly elections.|$|E
