40|$|ABSTRACT In {{concurrent}} with reformation and decentralization, {{number of}} sub-national administrative in Indonesia increase significantly. Existing regions has been splitting {{to create new}} regions. As the result, number of municipalities and districts in Indonesia in recent years are more than 450. The creation of new regions has been expected will increase citizens’ welfare in the regions and reduce regional inequality. However, <b>indicative</b> <b>evidences</b> shows negative impacts of this reform such as increase of inefficient administration cost of government, decrease capacity to deliver public services and increase potential for inter-group conflict. All of these <b>indicative</b> <b>evidences</b> will affect the welfare of citizens as seen on the human development indicators. Based on this background, {{the aim of this}} article is to analyze the relation of creation of new regions with the evolution of regional welfare inequality. The study employed human development index (HDI) at sub-national level (kota/kabupaten) as the indicator of welfare. The evolution of regional inequality of the HDI is analyzed by comparing coefficient of variation in the HDI from 1996 to 2005. This paper also estimated a preliminary empirical model to assess the impact of pemekaran on the within province inequality. The policy implication of this finding is that pemekaran should be controlle...|$|R

Moreover, it is investigated that adequate utilization of external knowledge and maximum output from internal innovation is rarely possible without R&D department. Therefore, R&D department is essential to expedite the SMEs’ open innovation system. Hence, external knowledge, internal innovation, and R&D department are the major determinants of firm’s open innovation performance in Malaysian SMEs. Additionally, SMEs require {{a certain level of}} external knowledge acquisition.

We provide empirical evidence for manufacturing sectors that the reforms carried out under the EU Single Market Programme (SMP) were associated with increased product market competition, as measured by average profitability, and with a subsequent increase in innovation intensity and productivity growth. We exploit exogenous variation in the expected impact of the SMP across countries and industries to identify the effects of reforms on average profitability, {{and the effects of}} profitability on innovation and productivity growth. We also find some <b>indicative</b> <b>evidence</b> that increased competition is associated with faster productivity growth in service sectors...|$|E

40|$|Independent {{candidates}} are legally prohibited in the Tanzanian electoral system. Promoting representative democracy; preserving peace, order, and security, {{and the ability}} of political parties to advance people’s interests have often been cited as the rationale for such proscription.

Based on documentary analysis and primary data gathered by the author, the paper argues that the proscription of independent candidates in Tanzania under the guise of people’s interests fails the test of validity. Further, although independent {{candidates are}} prohibited in Tanzania, findings suggest that the country’s 2010 general election results presented a case for their de facto presence. The remarkable discrepancies in electoral support between the parliamentary and presidential candidates of the same political parties present <b>indicative</b> <b>evidence</b> to that effect...|$|E

Focusing on specific events, we test if aid accelerations correspond to policies and shocks in the recipient country. For a large sample of 145 recipient countries and 33 donors from 1960 - 2007, we find that positive regime changes and wars are significant predictors of aid accelerations. Disaggregating aid flows by donors, we find <b>indicative</b> <b>evidence</b> for competing allocation rules, particularly among European donors. We argue that drivers of aid accelerations differ from drivers of average aid flows - a distinction that can reconcile some of the ambiguous empirical results in the aid literature.

40|$|The surface {{structures}} of doped semiconductor photocatalysts {{play a vital}} role in determining visible light absorbance, transfer and redox potentials of charge carriers, as well as the inhibition of recombination. We examine the photocatalysis of anatase TiO 2 with surface terminating Ti-O-B-N structures from both experimental and computational perspectives. This codoped titania system shows much better photocatalytic activity in generating center dot OH radical species and degrading organic pollutants in comparison with B-doped anatase titania. We present <b>indicative</b> <b>evidence</b> that the Ti-O-B-N surface structures can exhibit bifunctionality in promoting photocatalysis, (i) supplying partially occupied localized states attributed to B-N coupling with spectral distribution that is advantageous for enhancing visible light absorption and (ii) acting as photocatalytic "hot sites" to support localization and separation of charge carriers at the surface. These results offer important implications for designing highly efficient photocatalysts based on codoping strategies...|$|E

40|$|Mainly in {{response}} to the policy drive to avoid unnecessary acute hospital admissions and delayed discharge on social grounds, there has been a gradual development of social work services attached to emergency departments (EDs) in the UK.

It is argued that social workers may be able to contribute to the efficiency and effectiveness of hospital services while providing a key point of access to social care services. A number of obstacles remain to the implementation of this model of service, including the narrow focus of current social care practice, the hours that a social work service is normally provided, chronic under-funding, and continuing perverse incentives in the health and social care system.
