60|$|<b>I</b> <b>have</b> <b>safely</b> {{received}} your cheque this morning, {{and will}} {{hand it over}} forthwith to the honorary secretary of the hospital. I hope you have read the little speech in the hospital's publication of it. They had it taken by their own shorthand-writer, and it is done verbatim.|$|E
60|$|<b>I</b> <b>have</b> <b>safely</b> arrived here, {{just in time}} to add a line to that effect, and {{get this}} off by to-morrow's English mail from New York. Catarrh rather better. Everything triumphant last night, except no sleep again. I suppose Dolby to be now {{on his way back to}} join me here. I am much mistaken if the {{political}} crisis do not damage the farewells by almost one half.|$|E
6000|$|SECTION XCIV. Eighth side. God {{creating}} Man. Represented as a throned figure, with a glory {{round the}} head, laying {{his left hand}} {{on the head of}} a naked youth, and sustaining him with his right hand. The inscription puzzled me for a long time; but except the lost r and m of [...] "formavit," [...] and a letter quite undefaced, but to me unintelligble, before the word Eva, {{in the shape of a}} figure of 7, <b>I</b> <b>have</b> <b>safely</b> ascertained the rest.|$|E
60|$|The {{excitement}} had now burned itself out: she {{had dropped}} her head wearily on my shoulder, and bade me take her back. When <b>I</b> <b>had</b> <b>safely</b> deposited {{her on the}} couch again, she remained for some minutes with her face covered, silently weeping.|$|R
5000|$|I greatly joyed that <b>I</b> <b>had</b> <b>safely</b> found {{a certain}} token of their safe being at Croatoan, {{which is the}} place where Manteo was born, and the savages of the island our friends. [...] White had {{instructed}} them that if anything happened to them, they should carve a Maltese cross on a tree nearby, indicating that their disappearance had been forced. As there was no cross, White took this to mean they had moved to [...] "Croatoan Island" [...] (now known as Hatteras Island). Upon finding the message of CROATOAN carved on the palisade, White also wrote: ...|$|R
6000|$|By {{this time}} <b>I</b> <b>had</b> {{pushed the door}} open and walked into the room. ‘Your highness,’ said I, ‘this is no time for moralising; with a little {{promptness}} we may save this creature’s life; and as for the other, he need cause you no concern, for <b>I</b> <b>have</b> him <b>safely</b> under lock and key.’ ...|$|R
6000|$|... "The {{fact remains}} as I have stated it," [...] Lord Chelsford said slowly. [...] "My {{information}} is positive. When {{you came to}} me and suggested that you should make two copies of everything, one correct, one a mass of incorrectness, I must admit that I thought the idea farfetched and unworkable. Events, however, have proved otherwise. <b>I</b> <b>have</b> <b>safely</b> received everything which you sent me, and up to the present, with the exception of that first plan of the Winchester forts, our secrets are unknown. But now we have come to a deadlock." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "'It will {{be within}} the {{recollection}} of many present,' said Professor Challenger, 'that similar foolish and unmannerly scenes marked the last meeting at which I {{have been able to}} address them. On that occasion Professor Summerlee was the chief offender, and though he is now chastened and contrite, the matter could not be entirely forgotten. I have heard to-night similar, but even more offensive, sentiments from the person who has just sat down, and though it is a conscious effort of self-effacement to come down to that person's mental level, I will endeavor to do so, in order to allay any reasonable doubt which could possibly exist in the minds of anyone.' (Laughter and interruption.) 'I need not remind this audience that, though Professor Summerlee, {{as the head of the}} Committee of Investigation, has been put up to speak to-night, still it is I who am the real prime mover in this business, and that it is mainly to me that any successful result must be ascribed. <b>I</b> <b>have</b> <b>safely</b> conducted these three gentlemen to the spot mentioned, and I have, as you have heard, convinced them of the accuracy of my previous account. We had hoped that we should find upon our return that no one was so dense as to dispute our joint conclusions. Warned, however, by my previous experience, I have not come without such proofs as may convince a reasonable man. As explained by Professor Summerlee, our cameras have been tampered with by the ape-men when they ransacked our camp, and most of our negatives ruined.' (Jeers, laughter, and 'Tell us another!' from the back.) 'I have mentioned the ape-men, and I cannot forbear from saying that some of the sounds which now meet my ears bring back most vividly to my recollection my experiences with those interesting creatures.' (Laughter.) 'In spite of the destruction of so many invaluable negatives, there still remains in our collection a certain number of corroborative photographs showing the conditions of life upon the plateau. Did they accuse them of having forged these photographs?' (A voice, 'Yes,' and considerable interruption which ended in several men being put out of the hall.) 'The negatives were open to the inspection of experts. But what other evidence had they? Under the conditions of their escape it was naturally impossible to bring a large amount of baggage, but they had rescued Professor Summerlee's collections of butterflies and beetles, containing many new species. Was this not evidence?' (Several voices, 'No.') 'Who said no?' ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Ay, marry, is it!" [...] said Woodcock; [...] "but I wish I could hood thee {{as they do}} the hawks, for thou starest as wildly as if you sought another fray {{or another}} fanfarona. <b>I</b> would <b>I</b> <b>had</b> thee <b>safely</b> housed, for thou lookest wild as a goss-hawk." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "The plan {{might be}} as good as another, though I own that it had not {{occurred}} to me; but it would certainly necessitate my having him held prisoner until <b>I</b> <b>had</b> got <b>safely</b> out of France, otherwise my fate would assuredly be to be broken on the wheel." ...|$|R
6000|$|By {{this time}} <b>I</b> <b>had</b> {{pushed the door}} open and walked into the room. [...] "Your highness," [...] said I, [...] "this is no time for moralising; with a little {{promptness}} we may save this creature's life; and as for the other, he need cause you no concern, for <b>I</b> <b>have</b> him <b>safely</b> under lock and key." ...|$|R
60|$|And when, in my excited {{frame of}} mind, {{it seemed as}} if the escape was but just begun, I found myself in the thicket amid those lads who had been my playmates since I could remember, while each strove to show in silence how delighted he was that <b>I</b> <b>had</b> come <b>safely.</b>|$|R
60|$|The {{fellow was}} overdoing it a little, I thought; then, when <b>I</b> <b>had</b> seen him <b>safely</b> {{locked up for}} the night, I {{walked back to the}} kitchen slowly and very thoughtfully.|$|R
6000|$|... 'Oh! you wicked child,' {{cried the}} Witch. 'What is this I hear? <b>I</b> thought <b>I</b> <b>had</b> hidden you <b>safely</b> {{from the whole}} world, {{and in spite of}} it you have managed to deceive me.' ...|$|R
6000|$|Somehow he had {{my hands}} in his. How did he ever get them? I was sure <b>I</b> <b>had</b> them <b>safely</b> tucked out of harm's way behind me. [...] "You know, Kitty, that I love you. I am a poor man--perhaps I may never be {{anything}} else--and this may seem to you very presumptuous. But I cannot let you go like this. Will you be my wife, dear?" ...|$|R
6000|$|<b>I</b> <b>had</b> {{given her}} time; <b>I</b> <b>had</b> seen her <b>safely</b> to shore. It was quite what <b>I</b> <b>had</b> meant to do, but she now took still better {{advantage}} than <b>I</b> <b>had</b> expected of her opportunity. She not only scrambled up the bank, she recovered breath and turned round. [...] "Do you imagine {{he would have}} told me?" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I {{brought my}} {{mistress}} {{home from the}} Opera, sir. I rode on the box with Mrs. Delarey's chauffeur. After <b>I</b> <b>had</b> seen her <b>safely</b> in the hotel, I went {{up to my room}} for two minutes and left the hotel by the back entrance." ...|$|R
60|$|With my {{recognition}} of the place to which <b>I</b> <b>had</b> now wandered, came remembrance of the dangers <b>I</b> <b>had</b> left behind me on the rock-track that led from the mainland to the promontory--dangers of narrow ledges and treacherous precipices, which <b>I</b> <b>had</b> passed <b>safely,</b> while unconscious {{of them in the}} mist, but which I shrank from tempting again, now that I recollected them, until the sky <b>had</b> cleared, and <b>I</b> could see my way well before me. The atmosphere was still brightening slowly over the tossing, distant waves: I determined to wait until it had lost all its obscurity, before I ventured to retrace my steps.|$|R
6000|$|Does this {{discovery}} of some one lost, this return of some one so long gone, come upon {{him as a}} strong confirmation of his hopes? Does he think, [...] "Shall I not, with the aid <b>I</b> <b>have,</b> recall her <b>safely</b> after this, there being fewer hours in her case than there are years in his?" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I {{hope that}} you will get it long before that, Mikail. The journey is too long to do in one summer. I shall winter somewhere in the north, and I hope to be in England by the {{following}} autumn; therefore, if <b>I</b> <b>have</b> got <b>safely</b> away, you may look for a letter before the Christmas after next. If it does not come by that time, you will know that <b>I</b> <b>have</b> failed in my first attempt, and then you will, I hope, get one a year later. I shall, of course, be careful what I say; in case it should be opened and read, there will be nothing in it about your knowing that I intended to escape." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Remember," [...] John said, [...] "that if misfortune befalls us, <b>I</b> <b>have</b> never laid {{claim to}} any divine commission. We are all agents of God, {{and it may}} be that he has {{specially}} chosen me as one of his instruments; but this I cannot say, beyond the fact that, so far, <b>I</b> <b>have</b> been carried <b>safely</b> through great dangers, and have been enabled to win successes over the Romans. But I do not set up as a specially-appointed leader.|$|R
6000|$|... "What's the use--what's the use?" [...] exclaimed le Bourdon {{a little}} impatiently, {{when he found}} the {{corporal}} getting to be in earnest in his proposal. [...] "Here <b>have</b> <b>I</b> lived, <b>safely,</b> two seasons in Castle Meal, without any pickets or palisades; and yet you want to turn this new house into a regular garrison!" ...|$|R
60|$|Part {{of the way}} {{was black}} as sin, {{but for the most}} it was fairly well lighted. The stretch where I must hug the left wall to avoid the pits was darkest of them all, and I was nearly {{over the edge of the}} abyss before I knew that I was near the danger spot. A narrow ledge, scarce a foot wide, was all that had been left to carry the {{initiated}} past that frightful cavity into which the unknowing must surely have toppled at the first step. But at last <b>I</b> <b>had</b> won <b>safely</b> beyond it, and then a feeble light made the balance of the way plain, until, at the end of the last corridor, I came suddenly out into the glare of day upon a field of snow and ice.|$|R
60|$|At {{the far end}} I {{could see}} that erosion from above had washed down {{sufficient}} rubble to form a narrow ribbon of beach. Toward this I swam with all my strength. Not once did I look behind me, since every unnecessary movement in swimming detracts so much from one's endurance speed. Not until <b>I</b> <b>had</b> drawn myself <b>safely</b> out upon the beach did I turn my eyes back toward the sea for the hyaenodon. He was swimming slowly and apparently painfully toward the beach upon where I stood.|$|R
6000|$|... "However, I do {{not think}} you will find him at Badajos. No doubt, {{as soon as he}} heard <b>I</b> <b>had</b> got <b>safely</b> down into the valley of the Tagus, he made off. There is just a {{possibility}} that the contractors, knowing that their lives will be forfeited by the discovery of the frauds, might at once have sent in supplies of powder, flour, and other things, {{to take the place of}} the casks and sacks of earth; in which case he would probably deny the truth of my statement altogether, and declare that <b>I</b> <b>had</b> simply invented it in order to do credit to myself. But I hardly think that possible. In the first place, there are the soldiers both of my escort and of Colonel Mendez, who assisted in the work of examination; besides which more than half the commissaries escaped while this was taking place, and, on an offer of pardon, would no doubt gladly come forward and give evidence, especially as the execution of their comrades will have shown them that the governor is determined to throw them over." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Well, ladies," [...] Reuben said, as {{he entered}} the room, [...] "we are just off. So I will say goodbye to you; and I hope that, on my return, I shall find Mr. Donald much better. I am sure that Mr. Ruskin would not have left, this morning, unless he felt that he had quite turned the corner. Pray take care of yourselves, while we are away. You know I don't want to alarm you, but pray be careful. I shall not feel comfortable, as to your safety, till <b>I</b> <b>have</b> that villain <b>safely</b> in my hands." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I assure you, my dear," [...] he continued, [...] "that the {{recollection}} of what I {{suffered from the}} Laphams at that dinner of yours is an anguish still. It wasn't their behaviour,--they behaved well enough--or ill enough; but their conversation was terrible. Mrs. Lapham's range was strictly domestic; and when the Colonel got me in the library, he poured mineral paint all over me, till <b>I</b> could <b>have</b> been <b>safely</b> warranted not to crack or scale in any climate. I suppose we shall have to see {{a good deal of}} them. They will probably come here every Sunday night to tea. It's a perspective without a vanishing-point." ...|$|R
60|$|And now she beset me {{with fresh}} thanks and fresh {{expressions}} of wonder at my generous readiness to befriend her--a wonder all devoid of suspicion touching the single-mindedness of my purpose. But I reminded her {{that we had}} little leisure to stand talking, and left her to make her preparations for the journey, whilst I went below to see that my mule and her horse were saddled. I made bold to pay the reckoning, and when presently she spoke of it, with flaming cheeks, and would have pledged me a jewel, I bade her look upon it as a loan which anon she might repay me when <b>I</b> <b>had</b> brought her <b>safely</b> to her kinsman's Court at Pesaro.|$|R
6000|$|... "I {{was just}} leaving the Tower when he arrived. I {{spoke to him}} at the door. <b>I</b> <b>had</b> seen Capet <b>safely</b> {{installed}} in the room, and gave orders to the woman Simon to let citizen Cochefer have a look at him, too, and then to lock up the brat in the inner room and install Cochefer in the antechamber on guard. I stood talking to Cochefer for a few moments in the antechamber. The woman Simon and the man-of-all-work, Dupont--whom I know well--were busy with the furniture. There could not have been any one else concealed about the place--that I'll swear. Cochefer, after he took leave of me, went straight into the room; he found the woman Simon in the act of turning the key in the door of the inner chamber. <b>I</b> <b>have</b> locked Capet in there,' she said, giving the key to Cochefer; 'he will be quite safe until to-night; when the other commissaries come.' ...|$|R
60|$|From {{that time}} good modern {{pictures}} have risen in the scale. Even as articles {{of commerce and}} safe investments for money, they have now (as some disinterested collectors who dine at certain annual dinners I know of, can testify) distanced the old pictures in the race. The modern painters who have survived {{the brunt of the}} battle, have lived to see pictures for which they once asked hundreds, selling for thousands, and the young generation making incomes by the brush in one year, which it would have cost the old heroes of the easel ten to accumulate. The posterity of Mr. Pickup still do a tolerable stroke of business (making bright modern masters for the market which is glutted with the dingy old material), and will, probably, continue to thrive and multiply in the future: the one venerable institution of this world which we can safely count upon as likely to last, being the institution of human folly. Nevertheless, if a wise man of the reformed taste wants a modern picture, there are places for him to go to now where he may be sure of getting it genuine; where, if the artist is not alive to vouch for his work, the facts at any rate have not had time to die which vouch for the dealer who sells it. In my time matters were rather different. The painters we throve by had died long enough ago for pedigrees to get confused, and identities disputable; and if <b>I</b> <b>had</b> been desirous of really purchasing a genuine Old Master for myself--speaking as a practical man--I don't know where <b>I</b> should <b>have</b> gone to ask for one, or whose judgment <b>I</b> could <b>have</b> <b>safely</b> relied on to guard me from being cheated, before I bought it.|$|R
60|$|My time grows very short. All the {{manuscript}} <b>I</b> <b>have</b> written is <b>safely</b> smuggled {{out of the}} prison. There is a man I can trust who will {{see that it is}} published. No longer am I in Murderers Row. I am writing these lines in the death cell, and the death-watch is set on me. Night and day is this death-watch on me, and its paradoxical function is to see that I do not die. I must be kept alive for the hanging, or else will the public be cheated, the law blackened, and a mark of demerit placed against the time-serving warden who runs this prison and one of whose duties is to see that his condemned ones are duly and properly hanged. Often I marvel at the strange way some men make their livings.|$|R
6000|$|... "I came," [...] he said quietly, [...] "to {{bring you}} the {{assurance}} that he <b>has</b> got <b>safely</b> away, and to tell you upon what manner of errand <b>I</b> <b>have</b> sent him." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "No, <b>I</b> <b>have</b> {{been expecting}} to see them brought up every minute. Now I am {{beginning}} to hope that they <b>have</b> got <b>safely</b> off. <b>I</b> think the fellows began their attack at our end of the village.|$|R
6000|$|It {{appeared}} that the resolute side of him had held {{out as far as}} Frizinghall. He had put the whole case plainly before the magistrate, and the magistrate had at once sent for the police. The first inquiries instituted about the Indians showed that they had not so much as attempted to leave the town. Further questions addressed to the police, proved that all three had been seen returning to Frizinghall with their boy, on the previous night between ten and eleven--which (regard being had to hours and distances) also proved that they had walked straight back after performing on our terrace. Later still, at midnight, the police, having occasion to search the common lodging-house where they lived, had seen them all three again, and their little boy with them, as usual. Soon after midnight <b>I</b> myself <b>had</b> <b>safely</b> shut up the house. Plainer evidence than this, in favour of the Indians, there could not well be. The magistrate said there was not even a case of suspicion against them so far. But, as it was just possible, when the police came to investigate the matter, that discoveries affecting the jugglers might be made, he would contrive, by committing them as rogues and vagabonds, to keep them at our disposal, under lock and key, for a week. They had ignorantly done something (I forget what) in the town, which barely brought them within the operation of the law. Every human institution (justice included) will stretch a little, if you only pull it the right way. The worthy magistrate was an old friend of my lady's, and the Indians were [...] "committed" [...] for a week, as soon as the court opened that morning.|$|R
6000|$|... "We are in," [...] he said, [...] "for {{a furious}} tempest. It is the {{breaking}} {{up of the}} monsoon. It is a fortnight earlier than usual. <b>I</b> <b>had</b> hoped that we should <b>have</b> got <b>safely</b> up the Hoogly before it began." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I {{wish the}} Duke would come home. I can't {{go that way}} now till <b>I</b> <b>have</b> called. <b>I</b> <b>have</b> no end {{of things to say}} to you," [...] she added, and her little lively ponies shot ahead of the old rectorial steed. However, she waited at the entrance. [...] "Who do you think is come? Colin Keith made his {{appearance}} this morning. He <b>has</b> <b>safely</b> captured his Ouralian bear, though not without plenty of trouble, and he could not get him on to Avonmouth till he had been to some chemical institution about an invention. Colin thought him safe there, and rushed down by the train to see us. They go on to-morrow." ...|$|R
