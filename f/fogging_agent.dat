5000|$|Magenta developer: This {{contains}} a chemical <b>fogging</b> <b>agent</b> that makes {{all of the}} remaining undeveloped silver developable. If everything has worked correctly, nearly all of this silver is in the magenta layers. The developer and magenta coupler work just like the cyan and yellow developers to produce magenta dye that is insoluble and stays in the film.|$|E
40|$|ABSTRACT Studies {{carried out}} at the {{laboratory}} and in the field identified many potential problems during disinfection of poultry units naturally con-taminated with Salmonella enteritidis. There appeared to be variations in the efficiency of commonly used disinfectants within a disinfectant group when used in a contaminated house. It was possible for Salmonella and other coliforms to be amplified during the pressure washing or steam cleaning process. If an effective terminal disinfectant was not used after this, then high levels of Salmonella were likely to persist. The efficiency of the disinfection regimen was not directly dependent on the standard of physical cleaning if this was carried out to a reasonable standard, as {{a high level of}} elimination of Salmonella could be achieved even in the presence of substantial quantities of residual organic matter. Disinfection regimens involving formaldehyde/either as part of a terminal compound disinfectant spray or as a final <b>fogging</b> <b>agent,</b> were found to be the most effective in the field...|$|E
50|$|Chemical deterrents {{range from}} {{products}} for turf to avicides. There are taste aversion products for geese, and <b>fogging</b> <b>agents</b> used for birds. Many localities have {{restrictions on the}} use of chemicals and pesticides targeted at birds if they intend to kill them. Chemical deterrents that do not harm birds are widely used with limited results.|$|R
50|$|In 1970, Agfa marketed Agfacontour Professional Film, which {{simplified}} {{the process}} of obtaining consistent results for images that looked similar to pseudo-solarised images and therefore it was widely used in equidensitometry and art. As of 2002, Agfacontour Film was no longer being produced. The Agfacontour film contained special emulsions and {{in combination with the}} Agfacontour developer, which contained chemical <b>fogging</b> <b>agents,</b> no exposure was necessary during the developing phase.|$|R
5000|$|In the UK, the Chemical Regulations Directorate (CRD), {{part of the}} Health and Safety Executive, {{oversees the}} use of {{adjuvant}}s. CRD defines an adjuvant as a substance other than water which is not in itself a pesticide but which enhances or is intended to enhance {{the effectiveness of the}} pesticide with which it is used. Adjuvants for use with agricultural pesticides have been categorised as extenders, wetting agents, sticking <b>agents</b> and <b>fogging</b> <b>agents.</b>|$|R
