5|$|Celtic Christianity {{differed}} in some <b>in</b> <b>respects</b> from {{that based on}} Rome, most importantly {{on the issues of}} how Easter was calculated and the method of tonsure, but there were also differences in the rites of ordination, baptism and in the liturgy. Celtic Christianity was heavily based on monasticism. Monasteries differed significantly from those on the continent, and were often an isolated collection of wooden huts surrounded by a wall. Because much of the Celtic world lacked the urban centres of the Roman world, bishoprics were often attached to abbeys. In the 5th, 6th and 7th centuries, Irish monks established monastic institutions in parts of modern-day Scotland. Monks from Iona, under St. Aidan, then founded the See of Lindisfarne in Anglian Northumbria. The part of southern Scotland dominated by the Anglians in this period had a Bishopric established at Abercorn in West Lothian, and it is presumed that it would have adopted the leadership of Rome after the Synod of Whitby in 663, until the Battle of Dunnichen in 685, when the Bishop and his followers were ejected. By this time the Roman system of calculating Easter and other reforms had already been adopted in much of Ireland. The Picts accepted the reforms of Rome under Nechtan mac Der-Ilei around 710. The followers of Celtic traditions retreated to Iona and then to Innishbofin and the Western isles remained an outpost of Celtic practice for some time. Celtic Christianity continued to influence religion in England and across Europe into the late Middle Ages as part of the Hiberno-Scottish mission, spreading Christianity, monasteries, art and theological ideas across the continent.|$|E

He began to build Walker Road in 1860, and hire many employees, such as salesmen, office workers or skilled trade workers.

The expensive Superman cartoons, having lost their novelty value with exhibitors, ended production in 1943, {{a year after}} Famous' inception. They were replaced by a series starring Saturday Evening Post comic strip character Little Lulu. Also in 1943, Famous began producing the formerly black-and-white Popeye cartoons in Technicolor, and began {{a new series of}} one-shot cartoons under the umbrella title Noveltoons (similar <b>in</b> <b>respects</b> to the Color Classics series from Fleischer Studios, and also the Looney Tunes and Merrie Melodies series from Warner Bros.).|$|E

On MADtv, the parody was by Michael McDonald. O'Reilly himself has appeared on MADtv. Richards also played O'Reilly in an episode of Mind of Mencia where O'Reilly is a senator in the year 2016. The show was also spoofed by the TV series The Boondocks; first in the episode [...] "The Trial of R. Kelly" [...] where O'Reilly is shown talking about R. Kelly's latest legal trouble. Later in [...] "Return of the King", O'Reilly is shown attacking Martin Luther King for saying that America should [...] "love thy enemy" [...] and [...] "turn the other cheek", even <b>in</b> <b>respects</b> to the 9/11 attacks.

2500|$|The 1890s proved {{difficult}} <b>in</b> <b>respects</b> {{other than}} strictly financial. Because {{of the general}} recession, and due to some speculation that the University might have to resultingly close, enrollment dropped. Yet {{with the aid of}} Alumni, trustees, and the State of Pennsylvania, the young University pulled through. This era closed with the spectacular fire of the Physics building, April 6, 1900. With the improved economy of the 1900s, the new century offered stronger horizons. The Physics building was quickly rebuilt. And with the sale of the Packer Estate's interest in the Lehigh Valley Railroad (June 1, 1900), the school ceased to be known as a [...] "railroad university". Fortuitously a new benefactor would take its stead: Bethlehem Steel. The first intercollegiate Greek-lettered organization for Latino students was founded at Lehigh as this time. Psi Alpha Kappa, a fraternity for international Latin American students was founded in the fall of 1900. Psi Alpha Kappa also had a chapter at M.I.T. making it the first intercollegiate Latino fraternity in the United States.|$|E

Mrs Plornish, now established in the small grocery and general trade in a snug little shop at the crack end of the Yard, {{at the top of the}} steps, with her little old father and Maggy acting as assistants, habitually held forth about him over the counter in conversation with her customers. Mr Plornish, who had a small share in a small builder's business in the neighbourhood, said, trowel in hand, on the tops of scaffolds and on the tiles of houses, that people did tell him as Mr Merdle was the one, mind you, to put us all to rights <b>in</b> <b>respects</b> of that which all on us looked to, and to bring us all safe home as much as we needed, mind you, fur toe be brought. Mr Baptist, sole lodger of Mr and Mrs Plornish was reputed in whispers to lay by the savings which were the result of his simple and moderate life, for investment in one of Mr Merdle's certain enterprises. The female Bleeding Hearts, when they came for ounces of tea, and hundredweights of talk, gave Mrs Plornish to understand, That how, ma'am, they had heard from their cousin Mary Anne, which worked in the line, that his lady's dresses would fill three waggons. That how she was as handsome a lady, ma'am, as lived, no matter wheres, and a busk like marble itself. That how, according to what they was told, ma'am, it was her son by a former husband as was took into the Government; and a General he had been, and armies he had marched again and victory crowned, if all you heard was to be believed. That how it was reported that Mr Merdle's words had been, that if they could have made it worth his while to take the whole Government he would have took it without a profit, but that take it he could not and stand a loss. That how it was not to be expected, ma'am, that he should lose by it, his ways being, as you might say and utter no falsehood, paved with gold; but that how it was much to be regretted that something handsome hadn't been got up to make it worth his while; for it was such and only such that knowed the heighth to which the bread and butchers' meat had rose, and it was such and only such that both could and would bring that heighth down.|$|E

The first section of the paper provides a network analysis of patents <b>in</b> <b>respect</b> of biofuels across the three generations. It provides empirical research <b>in</b> <b>respect</b> of patent subject matter, ownership, and strategy <b>in</b> <b>respect</b> of biofuels. The second section provides {{a case study of}} significant patent litigation over biofuels. There is an examination of the biofuels patent litigation between the Danish company Novozymes, and Danisco and DuPont. The third section examines flexibilities <b>in</b> <b>respect</b> of patent law and clean technologies {{in the context of the}} case study of biofuels. In particular, it explores the debate over substantive doctrinal matters <b>in</b> <b>respect</b> of biofuels – such as patentable subject matter, technology transfer, patent pools, compulsory licensing, and disclosure requirements.
