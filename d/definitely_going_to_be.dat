40|$|Basically, my design {{functions}} as a Tunisian Restaurant. It will be located at the most {{east side of the}} Tunis and <b>is</b> <b>going</b> <b>to</b> give the new experience of dining at ‘the end of the world’. This restaurant <b>is</b> <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> a collection of market tables and stations, where customers can choose their preferred ingredients and ask the chefs to cook them, according to the customers’ preference as well. Other than that, customers <b>are</b> able <b>to</b> discuss with the experienced chefs about the cookery and also buy the raw ingredients if they wanted to. Concept of my building is ‘Beyond’ which represents the variability of my building’s program and functions. ‘Beyond dining’, people not <b>going</b> <b>to</b> come here to eat, but it is about an exploration of Tunisian food. The inspiration of my design is a spaceship, which symbolically, it will bring the customers to another world – this represents the new way of dining. Basic cube shapes has <b>been</b> used <b>to</b> synchronize the common shape of the Tunisian existed buildings. The structure which locates the dining and food stations <b>is</b> <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> a steel framed structure, clad by see-through glasses. This would allow natural light to enter the building and reduces the amount of energy used to provide light for the building. A transparent cladding would also allow the customer to see the view of Tunis outside as well as manipulate the space inside (looks more spacious by doing this). People outside the building could also see inside the building (which soon would attract them to experience what inside it) and at night, this building <b>is</b> <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> shine and this would create a new view of a night in Tunis as the existed buildings mostly are opaqued structures. Most part of the building <b>is</b> <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> about 5 metre above the ground, which will create a public space under it. This area could <b>be</b> used <b>to</b> organize any exhibitions, campaigns, or even a place for people of Tunis to meet and hang out. Area like this would definitely foster the community spirit. Moreover, this building would also adapt the usage of renewable energy which wind turbines will be applied {{at the top of the}} pinnacles and solar panel that facing south will be applied at the top of the roof. Hopefully, this building could be an example of the sustainable building that can be followed by other constructions/buildings in Tunis. The idea of this market style restaurant on the whole came from the various types of ingredients that could be used in Tunisian dishes. Most Tunisian dishes allow you to choose the ingredients for toppings and fillings (e. g. meat, fish, or vegetables). Thus, this concept would also give the opportunity to the customers to try different combination of ingredients, each time they go there. As it is a tradition for the Tunisian people to sometimes have a grand meal with their family, friends, or relatives, this restaurant <b>definitely</b> <b>is</b> <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> a best place for this, as it will satisfy the taste of different people, probably at the maximum level. This restaurant would also be a suitable place for the tourist to dine, as usually tourists <b>are</b> really interested <b>to</b> try new and different cuisines, but yet still fulfil their preference. Thus, tourist can enjoy the Tunisian food with their own taste type (e. g. the amount of hot peppers can <b>be</b> decided <b>to</b> delicate their palate). This restaurant would also introduce the Tunisian cuisine to the tourist as they will explore them from the ingredients, the way of cooking, and until the cuisine get served. Subsequently, this restaurant <b>is</b> able <b>to</b> become the main attraction in Tunis, promote a new tourism, or even it could potentially become one of the best restaurants in the world!DESA 1002 (Design and Practice...|$|R
