Tell him to do everything within his power to help you, and that nothing would be more pleasing to me than to see this livery on <b>each</b> <b>of</b> <b>my</b> children. They should all strive to make reparation for the outrages my Son is subjected to in the sacrament of his love. See the graces that will be poured forth on those who will wear it with confidence and help you to spread this devotion.|$|E

In {{an interview with}} Daily Nexus in June 2006, Mackin revealed that the conducting was the easy part and that the composing part was much harder. In this interview, Mackin also commented, [...] "composing was getting so frustrating since I wasn’t writing as fast as my mind was thinking, so going back I {{wanted to make sure}} that <b>each</b> <b>of</b> <b>my</b> arrangements for this album and the 12 different songs were completely different".|$|E

500|$|Lichtenstein's {{approach}} to presenting his own works within his works was non-traditional. The works were revisited as exact duplicates {{rather than the}} more standard distanced revisitation. This choice of exact duplication contrary to popular practice intrigued Lichtenstein. Lichtenstein liked this quality of his paintings within his paintings, saying [...] "I like {{the combination of a}} very separate quality that <b>each</b> <b>of</b> <b>my</b> paintings has within the painting, and the fact that everything works as one painting too." [...] In fact, Lichtenstein commented on this as an attempt to eliminate any modulation: ...|$|E

Sometimes I feel like the company's psychiatrist, but I do feel like listening to people and hearing about their problems (personal and professional) cleans out the cobwebs and keeps the organization humming.” ...|$|E
500|$|Back in Ainola, Sibelius busied {{himself by}} making new {{arrangements}} of old songs. However, his mind returned frequently to the now apparently moribund symphony. In February 1943 {{he told his}} secretary, Santeri Levas, that he hoped to complete a [...] "great work" [...] before he died, but blamed the war for his inability to make progress: [...] "I cannot sleep at nights when I think about it." [...] In June he discussed the symphony with his future son-in-law Jussi Jalas and provided another reason for its non-completion: [...] "For <b>each</b> <b>of</b> <b>my</b> symphonies I have developed a special technique. It can't be something superficial, {{it has to be}} something that has been lived though. In my new work I am struggling with precisely these issues." [...] Sibelius also told Jalas that all rough sketches and drafts were to be burned after his death; he did not want anyone labelling these rejected scraps as [...] "Sibelius letzten [...] Gedanken" [...] (Sibelius's last thoughts).|$|E

2500|$|Through the campaign, Godbout relentlessly {{repeated}} the formal promise : [...] "The government will never declare military conscription.
