5000|$|World War II, {{with its}} {{unprecedented}} push {{for industrial production}} of every kind, is probably the event that first put most laypersons {{in contact with the}} internal-wrenching hexagon drive. (Popular Science magazine would note in 1946 that [...] "Cap screws and setscrews with <b>heads</b> <b>recessed</b> to take hexagonal-bar wrenches are coming into increasing use.") ...|$|R
50|$|Fundamentally, a jointer's table {{arrangement}} is designed with two levels like a narrower thickness planer {{so that it}} consists of two long, narrow parallel tables in a row with a cutter <b>head</b> <b>recessed</b> between them, but with a side guide. This cutter head is typically driven by an electric induction motor. (Older machines were driven by belts from line shafts.) A moveable fence is normally set perpendicular to the tables, though some models may allow settings (adjustments) to various angles.|$|R

Each night these are brought out to the streets, where they stand in readiness for instant use.|$|R
50|$|The {{pedestal}} of veined marble {{is approximately}} 3.5 metres high, is alike {{on all four}} faces, and comprises plinth, dado and entablature. The plinth is a diminishing panelled block with a heavy moulding above. Inscriptions on the four panels of the plinth read: THOMAS JOSEPH BYRNES MLA for Warwick, 1896-98 (east face), Born Brisbane 1860 (north face), Premier of Queensland 1898 (west face), and Died 1898 (south face). At {{the base of the}} east face of the plinth is the inscription: Andrews Bros Sydney. The dado forms the shaft of the pedestal. At each corner is a column with foliated capital set in a rectangular recess, and each face has two pilasters either side of a semi-circular <b>headed</b> <b>recess.</b> The entablature consists of architrave, frieze and projecting cornice, with a panelled pediment at the centre of each face. 1902 is inscribed on the pediment of the east face.|$|R
25|$|The 13th-century south aisle {{contains}} the church square-paneled and plank south door, that is recessed {{to the same}} style as the chancel south door. A further small plank door at the south aisle north-east wall is within a pointed doorway with a continuous moulded surround, an entrance to a previous rood loft, defined externally by the south aisle turret. To {{the east of the}} door are twin aumbries. In the south wall is a 14th-century piscina with cusped head, set within an ogee <b>headed</b> <b>recess.</b> The north aisle, also 13th-century, contains within {{the north side of the}} chancel arch pier a further piscina with a seven-cusped arch surround with spandrels within a rectilinear frame, this sitting on a projecting ledge, with above, an entablature containing three floriate carvings; running on the entablature are crenellations. In the north wall is a further aumbry with wooden door. At the west end of the north aisle sits the church organ.|$|R
5000|$|The FLT Tour Glide was {{introduced}} in 1979 as a 1980 model. [...] Sold alongside the existing FLH Electra Glide, the FLT had a larger frame with rubber engine mounts, a five-speed transmission, the [...] engine, and a frame-mounted fairing. In order that the FLT frame, which was larger and heavier than the large and heavy FLH frame, would handle acceptably, the front forks were given radical steering geometry which had them mounted behind the steering head, with the frame behind the steering <b>head</b> being <b>recessed</b> to allow adequate steering lock.|$|R

50|$|Despite {{the alleged}} early Christian roots, written {{documentation}} only {{goes back to}} the 14th century. Most of the ornamentation that survives today dates to much later. The nave features a holy water font, a window and a broken bell chamber on the west wall. A high semi-Gothic arch divides the nave from the chancel, which may be a later addition to the church. A recess in the north wall reportedly served as a tomb like a similar structure in Kilfenora Cathedral. A prominent hood is crowned by a mitred <b>head.</b> A <b>recess</b> in the south wall may have once been a window with two Gothic arches topped by a carved head wearing a flat cap. It was reconstructed in a drawing by Thomas Johnson Westropp.|$|R
50|$|The south eastern facade, {{where the}} {{principal}} entrance is located, is terminated {{at both ends}} by the projecting elevations of the transverse wings. These bays have hipped roofs partially concealed by a decorative parapeted gable, surmounted at the apex by a pedimented feature, supported on reeded pilasters and flanked by pilasters surmounted by finials. Various round and square-headed arched openings, with both recessed and projecting surrounds are found symmetrically arranged on the elevation of the end bays. The south western wing has a more recent one storeyed entrance porch providing access to the chapel. The rendered masonry porch of rectangular plan has two round headed arched openings within a round <b>headed</b> arched <b>recess,</b> and moulded string courses and is surmounted by an entablature above which is an Italianate balustrade.|$|R

After going over the test, the class <b>heads</b> to <b>recess.</b> Sandra overhears one student who {{received}} a high test score asking another, “Do you really be-lieve that stuff about molecules? ” The other replies, “No way! ” The teacher has never heard such an ex-change in 10 years of teaching. She wonders if it is rare for students to disbelieve ideas they have en-countered in class or if this occurs regularly and she has just never noticed. In this article, we will show that students frequently do not believe what they are learning in school, in science, and in other classes. Because of this, teachers must seriously consider the role of persuasive teaching in their classes...|$|R
5000|$|On {{the west}} elevation, which faces Marine Parade, the {{decorative}} gable element features a loggia, consisting {{of an open}} porch with three round headed arches supported on two [...] "barley sugar" [...] twisted columns. The arches feature prominent keystone and raised edge detailing. Directly above the porch on the gable lettering spells [...] "BATHING PAVILION", with a cartouche with the date of construction, 1934. The edge of the stylised Baroque parapet has raised edge detailing which culminate in spiralled curves {{on the face of}} the gable. There are three doorways from the loggia, one of which has an overhead window opening, now boarded. The eastern elevation has a similar decorative parapeted gable housing six boarded window openings. The surrounds of these windows are round <b>headed</b> arched <b>recesses.</b> The skillion roofed wings on either side of the parapet element, previously fin walls forming entrances, are now infilled with weatherboard.|$|R

40|$|This review {{describes}} {{the development of}} arthroscopy of the hip over the past 15 years with reference to patient assessment and selection, the technique, the conditions {{for which it is}} likely to prove useful, the contraindications and complications related to the procedure and, finally, to discuss possible developments in the future. Arthroscopic surgery of the hip has evolved considerably in recent years and offers the opportunity of treatment of many previously unrecognised intra-articular abnormalities. 1 One of the early pioneers of the technique was Burman 2 who, in 1931, undertook hip arthro-scopy as part of a study on cadavers. However, the procedure did not gain popularity until the late 1970 s. The reasons for this slow growth in interest were twofold. First, the femoral <b>head</b> is deeply <b>recessed</b> in the bony acetabulum with...|$|R
50|$|The {{property}} is three-storeys, built of yellow brick and has full height pilasters at each corner with a dentilled cornice. There are four sash windows at each floor on The Avenue elevation and {{three on the}} Rockstone Place elevation. The ground floor windows are round-headed with arched <b>recessed</b> <b>heads,</b> and shell tympana decoration. The main door is at {{the centre of the}} Rockstone Place elevation; the stone doorcase has a shallow moulded cornice hood on brackets and pilasters over a round-headed keyed door opening.

5000|$|The FG 42 was a select-fire {{air-cooled}} {{weapon and}} one of the first to incorporate the [...] "straight-line" [...] recoil configuration. This layout, combined with the side magazine, placed both the center of gravity and the position of the shoulder stock nearly in line with the longitudinal axis of the bore, a feature increasing controllability during burst or automatic fire. The operating system was derived from that used in the successful Lewis light machine gun with a gas piston-actuated turning-bolt locking mechanism. This system used pressurized exhaust gases from the bore and channeled them through a port drilled in the barrel into a gas cylinder located under the barrel. The rapid build-up of propellant gases imparted rearward pressure on a long-stroke piston, driving it backwards, while an extension of the bolt carrier interacted with a helical camming slot machined into the bolt carrier, converting this linear movement into an angular velocity and forcing the bolt into a rotary motion, clearing the locking juts and unlocking it near the end of the bolt carrier's travel. The weapon was locked into battery by two lugs on the bolt <b>head</b> which <b>recessed</b> into appropriate cavities machined into the receiver walls. Owing to its main intended use by paratroopers, the rear sight (which necessarily was rather high due to the straight stock design) was a flip-up construction.|$|R

50|$|A {{new version}} of the Giulietta Berlina debuted at the Frankfurt Motor Show in 1959. Mechanical changes were limited to {{shifting}} the fuel pump from the cylinder head to a lower position below the distributor, and moving the previously exposed fuel filler cap from the tail to the right rear wing, under a flap. The bodywork showed a revised front end, with more rounded wings, <b>recessed</b> <b>head</b> lights, and new grilles with chrome frames and two horizontal bars. The rear also showed changes, with new larger tail lights on vestigial fins, which replaced the earlier rounded rear wings. The interior was much more organized and upholstered in new cloth material; the redesigned dashboard included a strip speedometer flanked by two round bezels, that on the T.I. housed a tachometer and oil and water temperature gauges. The T.I. also received a front side repeater mounted in a small spear, unlike the Normale which kept the earlier small round lamp with no decorations. During 1959 the type designation for all models was changed from 750 and 753 to 101.|$|R
40|$|This master thesis {{researches}} {{the necessity}} and possibilities of new/innovative lock gate technologies for future large & high head locks, like the Panama Canal Expansion Project. A historical data analysis has been performed, contemplates over 220 {{of the worlds}} largest locks throughout time, analyzing the development and application of conventional lock gate technologies. From this, the conclusions have been drawn that the required lock gate dimensions {{of a number of}} future projects, fall far outside the application area of current technologies, and that it may not be assumed that conventional technologies will lead to optimal solutions at this scale. In addition, a number of aspects will be highlighted for future large & high head lock gate design, especially reliability, water consumption and its effects on the locks accessibility. A new lock gate technology has been developed specifically attuned to the future dimensions and highlighted requirements resulting into the design of: ‘The Sliding Arch Gate’, an extremely slender gate design, using (tension) arch action to transfer loads to the lock <b>head</b> structure, minimizing <b>recess</b> dimensions and water consumption. In addition, the absence of submerged moving / mechanical parts, minimizes maintenance requirements and the modular design of the gate enhances ease of maintenance, transport and manufacture. The Sliding Arch Gate has been worked out to an operational design level, using the Panama Canal Expansion Project as reference, in order to evaluate its potential performance and to make comparison with conventional technologies. From the evaluation it has been concluded that Sliding Arch Gate will require higher initial investments but that major benefits are achieved by reduced water consumption and low maintenance. The first of which can result into over $ 2, 000 mln. in added revenues for the Panama Canal, during the commercial lifetime of the gate, due to increased lockage capacity. It has thus been concluded that new/innovative technologies, like the Sliding Arch Gate, can outperform up-scaled conventional technologies. However as the design of the Sliding Arch Gate is still in a pioneering stage, there are many optimizations to be found and uncertainties to be investigated.
