5|$|Some of {{the species}} in the {{freshwater}} mussel family, Unionidae, commonly known as pocketbook mussels, have evolved an unusual reproductive strategy. The female's mantle protrudes from the shell and develops into an imitation small fish, complete with fish-like markings and false eyes. This decoy moves in the current and attracts the attention of real fish. Some fish see the decoy as prey, while others see a conspecific. They approach <b>for</b> <b>a</b> <b>closer</b> <b>look</b> and the mussel releases huge numbers of larvae from its gills, dousing the inquisitive fish with its tiny, parasitic young. These glochidia larvae are drawn into the fish's gills, where they attach and trigger a tissue response that forms a small cyst around each larva. The larvae then feed by breaking down and digesting the tissue of the fish within the cysts. After a few weeks they release themselves from the cysts and fall to the stream bed as juvenile molluscs. The fish are relatively unharmed.|$|E

As he had not been instructed to not look at the negatives before sending them, he did.

40|$|Over {{the last}} two decades, {{there has been a}} radical shift in {{anthropology}} from stable, rooted and mappable identities to fluid, transitory and migratory forms of belonging. Displacement has become the new trope through which anthropologists have come to look at the world. As a result, place has received an ambiguous position. Focusing on the life experiences of one Somali refugee woman living in Melbourne and her engagement with place, this article questions the current emphasis on space and boundlessness in anthropological discourses on displacement. It argues that rather than developing theoretical concepts that bypass people's experiences, the zooming in on individuals' lifeworlds allows <b>for</b> <b>a</b> <b>close</b> <b>look</b> at the particularity and everydayness of being-in-place.

2500|$|The RAPTOR system (Rapid Telescopes for Optical Response) is a {{specialized}} suite of telescopes designed {{to detect and}} track transient objects, including gamma-ray bursts and near-earth objects. RAPTOR was built by a Los Alamos team headed by astrophysicist Tom Vestrand. The system consists of six robotic observatories—RAPTOR-A, -S, -P, -K, and -T are located at Fenton Hill and RAPTOR-B {{is located at the}} Los Alamos Neutron Science Center, [...] away. The telescopes are all networked and controlled by a centralized computer system. The older RAPTOR telescopes, RAPTORs A, B, S and P each consist of a wide-field telescope and a narrow-field telescope. They are mounted on platforms that can swivel to any point in the sky in less than 3 seconds, making them the fastest moving telescopes ever built. Each wide-field telescope has a nominal field of view of 38 by 38 degrees, which equates to being able to cover the sky in eleven patches. Each telescope is actually two telescopes giving stereoscopic vision. There is a zoom mechanism built into each telescope as well. While in monitoring mode, RAPTOR takes two consecutive 30-second exposures through its two wide-field telescopes and analyzes the resulting digital images. If it sees an interesting event, RAPTOR zooms in <b>for</b> <b>a</b> <b>closer</b> <b>look</b> with the two narrow-field telescopes.|$|E
