40|$|Introduction. The {{consequences}} of autologous and allogeneic stem cell transplantation (stem cells of hematopoiesis), applied in {{adults and children}} suffering from leukemia or some other malignant disease, are well-known and sufficiently recognizable in pediatric clinical practice regardless of the indication for the treatment. However, the efficacy of <b>fetal</b> <b>stem</b> <b>cell</b> transplantation is unrecognizable when the indications are psychomotor retardation and epilepsy. Case Outline. With the exception of neurological psychiatric problems, a boy aged 9. 5 years was in good general health before transplantation with allogeneic fetal stem cells. The main aim of allogeneic <b>fetal</b> <b>stem</b> <b>cell</b> transplantation was treatment of psychomotor retardation and epilepsy. After 13 months of treatment, he was admitted to hospital in a very serious, life-threatening condition due to sepsis and severe pleuropneumonia. The humoral immunity in the boy was adequate, unlike cellular immunity. The immune imbalance in terms of predominance of T-suppressor lymphocytes contributes to delayed and late development of sepsis and severe pleuropneumonia. The boy still shows the same severity of psychomotor retardation, dyslalia, epilepsy, strabismus and amblyopia. Conclusion. Implementation of <b>fetal</b> <b>stem</b> <b>cell</b> therapy for unconfirmed indications abuses the therapeutic approach, harms patients, misleads parents, and brings financial harm to the healthcare system of any country, including Serbia...|$|E

40|$|Since the {{isolation}} of <b>fetal</b> <b>stem</b> <b>cell</b> populations from perinatal tissues, such as umbilical cord blood and placenta, interest has been growing in understanding their greater plasticity compared with adult stem cells and exploring their potential in regenerative medicine. The phenomenon of fetal microchimerism (FMC) naturally occurring during pregnancy through the transfer of fetal stem/progenitor cells to maternal blood and tissues has been integral in developing this dogma. Specifically, microchimeric mesenchymal stem cells and endothelial progenitors of fetal origin have now demonstrated a capacity for tissue repair in the maternal host. However, the use of similar fetal stem cells in therapy has been significantly hampered by the availability of clinically relevant cell numbers and/or contamination with cells of maternal origin, particularly when using the chorionic and decidual placenta.

40|$|Microchimerism {{refers to}} the status of {{harboring}} cells from another individual at low levels. It is well known that cells traffic bidirectionally between fetus and mother during pregnancy. This situation resembles a naturally occurring long lasting <b>fetal</b> <b>stem</b> <b>cell</b> transplantation. The fetus acts as the donor and the mother acts as the recipient. To study the role of microchimerism in tissue regeneration, we constructed a murine microchimerism model with wild type C 57 BL/ 6 J female mice carrying progenies which expressed green fl uorescent proteins (GFP). Our data indicated that skin injuries in the female mice during pregnancy increased microchimerism of GFP expressing cells from the GFP transgenic progenies. The GFP positive cells also appeared at the site of spinal cord where injury occurred during pregnancy. Our study suggests that the amount of fetal cells in maternal mice significantly increased if injuries occurred during pregnancy.

40|$|During {{differentiation}} in vitro, {{embryonic stem}} (ES) cells generate progenitors for most hemato-lymphoid lineages.

Upon transfer into lymphoid deficient mice, the B 220 + population generated a single transient wave of IgM+ IgD+ B cells but failed to generate T cells. In contrast, transfer of the B 220 − fraction achieved long-term repopulation of both T and B lymphoid compartments and restored humoral and cell-mediated immune reactions in the recipients. To assess the hemato-lymphopoietic potential of ES cell subsets in comparison to their physiological counterparts, cotransplantation experiments with phenotypically homologous subsets of fetal liver cells were performed, revealing a more potent developmental capacity of the latter. The results suggest that multipotential and lineage-committed lymphoid precursors are generated during in vitro differentiation of ES cells and that both subsets can undergo complete final maturation in vivo...|$|E

40|$|Human solid tumors contain rare cancer side {{population}} (SP) cells, which expel {{the fluorescent}} dye Hoechst 33342 (H 33342) and display {{cancer stem cell}} characteristics. Transcriptional profiling of cancer SP cells isolated by H 33342 fluorescence analysis is a newly emerging approach to discover cancer stem cell markers and aberrant differentiation pathways. Using Affymetrix expression microarrays and quantitative reverse transcription-PCR, we investigated differential gene expression between SP and non-SP (NSP) cells isolated from human mammary carcinoma cell lines. A total of 136 genes were up-regulated in breast cancer SP relative to NSP cells, {{one of which was}} the <b>fetal</b> <b>stem</b> <b>cell</b> factor and Wnt/β-catenin signaling pathway target SOX 17. Strikingly, we discovered that SOX 17 was down-regulated by H 33342 in a dose-dependent manner. In SP cells, which expel H 33342, down-regulation of SOX 17 was less pronounced than in NSP cells, which retain H 33342. As a result of this, SOX 17 displayed a 10 – 20 -fold overexpression in cancer SP relative to NSP cells. Similar results were obtained for further stemness-related genes, namely EPC 1 and SPRY 1. These findings establish a previously unidentified gene-regulatory impact of H 33342 as a novel mechanism responsible for differential gene expression in cancer SP cells. This has significant implications for the future interpretation of cancer SP cells...|$|E
40|$|The murine <b>fetal</b> <b>stem</b> <b>cell</b> marker AA 4 has {{recently}} been cloned and {{is known to be}} the homolog of the human phagocytic C 1 q receptor involved in host defense. We herein report the molecular cloning and the cellular expression pattern of the rat AA 4 antigen. Modular architecture analysis indicated that the rat AA 4 is a member of C-type lectin-like family and, interestingly, displays similar domain composition and organization to thrombomodulin. Northern blot and reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction analyses indicated that rat AA 4 was encoded by a single transcript of 7 kilobases expressed constitutively in all tissues. In situhybridization showed that AA 4 was expressed predominantly by pneumocytes and vascular endothelial cells. Using an affinity purified polyclonal antibody raised against a rat AA 4 -Fc fusion protein, AA 4 was identified as a glycosylated protein of 100 kDa expressed by endothelial cells > platelets > NK cells and monocytes (ED 1 + cells). The staining was associated to the cell surface and intracytoplasmic vesicles. Conversely, erythrocytes, T and B lymphocytes, neutrophils, and macrophages (ED 2 + cells) were consistently negative for AA 4. As expected, the macrophage cell line NR 8383 expressed weak levels of AA 4. Taken together, our results support the idea that AA 4 /C 1 qRp is involved in some cell-cell interactions...|$|E
40|$|Introduction. Recent {{advances}} in molecular diagnostics and imaging technology now provide an unprecedented capacity for prenatal {{identification of a}} wide range of serious genetic and chromosomal disorders. Early diagnosis has far exceeded our ability to correct debilitating disorders, especially those for which there is no satisfactory postnatal treatment, and this has been the impetus for research into prenatal therapy. The rationale is that early detection allows early treatment, thus potentially curing a uniformly fatal disorder or preventing irreversible postnatal sequelae, especially those affecting the central nervous system. Stem cells hold far-reaching possibilities for the treatment of both acquired and congenital diseases. They can be used therapeutically to replace dysfunctional cells and tissues, or via ex vivo genetic manipulation to reconstitute a missing gene product (stem cell-based gene therapy). Stem cell transplantation in utero offers the exciting prospect of effectively treating inherited haematological, metabolic and other early-onset genetic diseases. This chapter addresses the current status of <b>fetal</b> <b>stem</b> <b>cell</b> therapy, its limitations and its future development. Sources of stem cells. Stem cells are rare primitive cells that share two distinct properties regardless of their source: the capacity for self-renewal. multi-lineage potential. Embryonic stem (ES) cells from the inner cell mass have the advantage of pluripotency or even totipotency but their clinical use is hindered by the real possibility of teratoma formation in vivo, which largely limits clinical application to tissue engineering rather than cell therapy...|$|E
