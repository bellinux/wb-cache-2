40|$|The {{analysis}} {{contained in}} the YHEC report indicates that the report did not consider adequately the role of competition {{in the market for}} health insurance. This is a major weakness and appears in part to be due to a late deletion of competition from the report’s final research brief by the HIA. (p. 90) The evidence on the average age of BUPA Ireland members, 38 years and VHI members, 44 years provides no basis for transfers from BUPA Ireland to VHI. In the case of females between 38 and 44 years health expenditures decline with extra years. The regressiveness of the transfers and cross subsidies in Irish health insurance under community rating is illustrated by the internal transfers from low cost profitable Plans A and B within VHI to high cost loss making Plans C, D and E. Under the proposed transfer of € 34 m a year from BUPA Ireland to VHI a low cost BUPA essential health insurance cover with a premium of € 272. 39 would be levied to cross subsidise VHI Plan E costing € 1, 316. 33 per adult. The price of the most expensive subsidised product under the HIA proposal is 4. 8 times the price of the product to be levied in order to finance the cross subsidisation. The average BUPA premium was € 327 while the average VHI premium was € 435. The price of the average product to be subsidised is therefore 33 % greater than the price of the average product to be levied to finance the cross subsidisation. CSO data confirms that expenditure on health insurance rises over all ten income deciles. Incomes in the top decile are 10. 1 times those in the bottom decile but health insurance expenditure is 22. 9 times greater. Section C of this report deals with the HIA letter to BUPA Ireland requiring the <b>equalisation</b> <b>payment</b> of € 34 m annually from BUPA Ireland for transfer to VHI which had operating profits of € 73. 3 m (before unexpired risk reserve) in their accounts to February 2004. The HIA presents no analysis of the rationale for the payment. It mistakenly asserts that consumers as a whole will be better off from levying one firm in order to cross-subsidise another. It asserts without evidence that the payments required are significant, rising, likely to rise further in the absence of risk equalisation and that in their absence the stability of the industry will be threatened. While there is recognition of possible withdrawal from BUPA Ireland of some younger members because of the price rise in order to finance payments to VHI there is no recognition in the letter of the benefits of competition to health insurance consumers. Section D examines the competition issues neglected by both YHEC and HIA and the benefits foregone by the anti-competitive levies imposed on BUPA. The Irish health service is characterised by high costs and rent-seeking by producers which are extreme by EU standards. The scope for immediate cost savings and further future leveraged savings in a high cost health service is therefore large but these benefits are foregone by regulators adopting the anticompetitive levies recommended by the regulator in this sector. ...|$|E

Cases of provable, systematically effected targeting by the Stasi, and resulting in employment-related losses and/or health damage, can be pursued under a law covering settlement of torts (Unrechtsbereinigungsgesetz, or 2.

40|$|The aims of {{this paper}} are to {{evaluate}} the risk equalisation (RE) arrangement in Australia’s private health insurance against practices in other countries with similar arrangements and to propose ways of improving the system to advance economic efficiency and solidarity. Possible regulatory responses to insurance market failures are reviewed based on standard economic arguments. We describe various regulatory strategies used elsewhere to identify essential system features against which the Australian system is compared. Our results reveal that RE is preferred over alternative regulatory strategies such as premium rate restrictions, premium compensation and claims equalisation. Compared with some countries’ practices, the calculated risk factors in Australia should be enhanced with further demographic, social and economic factors and indicators of long-term health issues. Other coveted features include prospective calculation and annual clearing of <b>equalisation</b> <b>payments.</b> Australia currently operates with a crude mechanism for RE in which the scheme incentivises insurers to select on risk {{rather than focusing on}} efficiency and equity-promoting actions.

Since 1994, {{there have been a}} number of studies and reports in relation to risk equalisation in Ireland. As such, the issue of risk equalisation has been the subject of extensive analysis and debate over many years. The arguments of interested parties have been considered throughout and the conclusion has consistently been reached that risk equalisation is necessary in order to maintain community rating. Following the quashing of the 2003 Risk Equalisation Scheme, the Government announced its intention to introduce a new risk equalisation system that is “robust, transparent and effective”. The Government introduced interim measures to support community rating in the Health Insurance (Miscellaneous Provisions) Act, 2009 while other long-term measures are being developed. 3 Following the Government Decision on health insurance in May 2010, the Minister wrote to the Authority on 8 June and asked it to carry out a consultation process regarding a new comprehensive risk equalisation system to take effect in 2013 and transitional arrangements to apply in 2012 and to report to the Minister...|$|R

The Polish negotiation position was planned to be introduced in November 1999. Poland expects free trade in food and agriculture and a system of structural funds and compensation payments as well as guaranteed adequate production quotas. The huge amount of regulations and the volume o f ELTs budget spent on agriculture make that the sector of economy becomes the most problematical part of negotiations.

40|$|The Austrian Federal {{government}} is striving {{to achieve a}} balanced national budget for 2002. In terms of budgetary distribution, {{it is assumed that}} the Länder (Federal states) will deliver a surplus of 0. 75 percent of GDP, whereas the communities will arrive at a balanced budget. Accordingly, the Federal budget could then have a deficit margin of 0. 75 percent of GDP. The budget proposed for 2002 meets this stability target. Current economic prospects, however, will not help to achieve the objective of a balanced budget. The Federal government attempts to meet its budgetary goal by raising additional (tax) revenues and by instituting savings on the expenditure side. Compared to 2000, the one-time effects on the revenue side of the 2002 budget are markedly lower, {{while at the same time}} the overall tax ratio is rising. Apart from ATS 1 billion, all of the additional revenues from taxation, which are estimated at about ATS 28 billion, will flow into Federal budget. At the same time, the Länder have raised their consolidation contribution to the Federal budget from ATS 2. 29 billion (from 2001) to ATS 4. 29 billion. Federal expenditures show substantial shifts due to budget consolidation. Altogether, both personnel expenses and transfers in the 2002 budget follow the original targets. The preliminary result for 2000 indicates that objectives were met, so that a solid foundation was built for the budgets for 2001 and 2002. The 2002 budget makes it clear that Bundesimmobiliengesellschaft is now investing a substantial part of the funds for construction and buildings which were formerly invested directly under the Federal budget. As a consequence, construction investment is noticeably lower in the Federal budget (at € 197 million in 2002, it is posted at more than 40 percent below the 2000 figure), whereas expenditure on rents has risen by almost € 400 million between 2000 and 2002. Other expenditure items similarly illustrate that the Federal {{government is}} increasingly outsourcing works and services to third parties rather than rendering them directly. Transfer payments are mostly within the scope of social expenditure. More than half of these payments are made to cover old-age pensions. At ATS 177. 3 billion (€ 12. 9 billion) in 2002, they will be 8. 2 percent higher than in 2000. The greater part of this sum is used as Federal contribution to the statutory pension insurance scheme (including <b>equalisation</b> <b>payments)</b> and transfers to the equalisation funds held by the pension insurance institutions. Apart from covering old-age pensions, a substantial share of the transfer payments involves family subsidies. The new child-care benefit (payable as of 2002) will make for a considerable increase of this item. Taking into account the abolishing of the parental leave benefit, the new child-care benefit will call for another ATS 6. 4 billion (€ 0. 46 billion) by 2002. Two components on the expenditure side will make an important contribution to budget consolidation: interest on the national debt and transfer payments to other public bodies. Lower budget deficits will make for interest payments in 2002 at roughly the 2001 level. Payments to other territorial authorities and funds are budgeted at ATS 113. 4 billion in 2002 (compared to ATS 113. 2 billion in 2000), as a consequence of the Federal government's attempt to reduce its financing functions.

40|$|This study {{presents}} a quantitative policy impact analysis of alternative policy and macroeconomic assumptions {{in the agricultural}} farming sector. Three scenarios are considered: direct payment scenario, macroeconomic environment scenario and WTO scenario. We apply the CAPRI-Farm model, an extension of CAPRI which disaggregates the standard Nuts 2 regional resolution of the supply models in CAPRI further to farm type models, capturing farm heterogeneity in terms of farm specialization and farm size across all EU regions and MS. The advantage of the CAPRI-Farm model compared to other similar models is that it represents comprehensively all major farm types in the EU and it links farm level behaviour with output and input market price responses. The direct <b>payment</b> scenario assumes <b>equalisation</b> of decoupled <b>payments</b> - a regional flat-rate scheme - at the Nuts 1, MS and EU levels. According to simulation results, the value of re-distributed payments vary strongly between the three flat-rate systems. The value of payments reallocated between farms in the EU increases from 9 % (3. 7 billion Eur) of the total CAP budget in the Nuts 1 scenario to 19 % (8. 2 billion Eur) in the EU flat-rate scenario. Particularly negatively affected are large- and medium-sized farms and dairies, mixed crops and livestock, general field and mixed cropping, olives, cereals and oilseeds and permanent crops. Small farms {{tend to be less}} affected. However, sheep, goats and grazing, the residual farm category and mixed livestock farms realise higher premiums and incomes. The study shows relatively minor allocative market responses and thus small price effects for all three scenarios. The WTO scenario aims to quantify the impact of trade liberalization on farming sector. More precisely, the scenario considers the impact of the proposal made by the chair of the WTO's agriculture negotiations, Ambassador Crawford Falconer. The simulation results show that tariff reduction increases consumer welfare in the EU by 8. 5 billion Eur, whereas agricultural income decreases by 6. 8 billion Eur (- 3 %), mainly driven by losses realised in the animal sector. The analyses show sizable impacts on farm income for different farm types. Generally, farm types specialised in livestock production lose the most. The largest negative income effects were observed for cattle, dairying, rearing and fattening, dairy, mixed crops and livestock; and sheep and goat farms. The macroeconomic environment scenario simulates the farm-level effects of a hypothetical economic recovery scenario that may lead to higher GDP growth and higher oil prices. Two shocks are assumed: an increase in the crude oil price by 50 % and an annual world GDP growth rate increase by 1 % relative to the baseline level. The results indicate that a higher GDP growth causes stronger price and market effects than does the increase in the oil price. With the oil price shock, farmers are affected by two opposing effects: an increase in production costs and an increase in revenues. In most cases, increasing costs dominate such that the overall farm income declines. The effect of higher GDP on income across farm types is generally positive due to the rising demand for agricultural products, which generates an increase in the prices of agricultural commodities. Farmers react to the new macro environment with adjustments of their production leading to an increase in arable land and intensification of crop and animal production activities. Further, a tendency to substitute grassland for arable land can be observed. JRC. DDG. J. 5 -Agriculture and Life Sciences in the Econom...|$|R
