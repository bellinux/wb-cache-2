500|$|According to Casting Crowns' lead vocalist Mark Hall, {{the concept}} for Come to the Well is the song [...] "The Well". Hall wrote the song {{based on the}} Biblical story of [...] "woman at the well {{and the fact that}} she was {{standing}} there talking to Jesus about water and Jesus was talking to her about water, but they weren't talking about the same water". Hall noted that, in his life, [...] "when I come to Jesus, I've already got my well figured out, I've already got what <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>is</b> <b>going</b> <b>to</b> sustain me, I just need him to sprinkle some magic Jesus dust on it and make it work. We have our wells figured and we want Jesus to fix our wells, but our wells are really holes in the ground". Hall argued that instead of using that approach, Christians should [...] "start with Jesus, then we go to the world", and said that approach is what the album is about. In writing the album, Hall worked with outside songwriters Steven Curtis Chapman, Matthew West, and Tom Douglas on several tracks; he received writing credit on eleven out of the album's twelve tracks, the exception being [...] "Face Down", which was penned by Hector Cervantes and Marc Byrd.|$|E
500|$|In May 2011, it was {{revealed}} that Susan and Karl's marriage would be run into trouble, when Susan becomes emotionally involved with another man. Susan strikes up a friendship with local builder, Jim Dolan (Scott Parmeter), as he fights cancer, causing problems between herself and Karl. When asked by Channel 5 about her reaction to the storyline, Woodburne said [...] "I think it's a great story. Karl and Susan are both in their 50s; they've been married together; they've raised a bunch of kids; they’ve had careers and jobs. And to use the popular term 'empty nesters', that's what they’re looking at. For him he thinks, 'That's great, terrific! More time for us; we can travel.' But for her it's, 'Well, I don't know how to be that person. I know how to be this person, who's someone who's wrangling kids and busy doing things.' But her challenge <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>is</b> <b>going</b> <b>to</b> be to find out who she is as one half of a couple, as opposed to being the hub of a wheel." [...] The actress revealed she and Fletcher were both worried about Susan and Karl breaking up and having to work with new people, but they believe any new development for the characters is good. Woodburne told Daniel Kilkelly of Digital Spy that she thought the new storyline was great and said any relationship which has been going {{for as long as the}} Kennedys' has, will have its [...] "turbulent patches". Woodburne said Susan develops a very strong attachment to Jim because of her desire to help and be needed. When asked if she was worried about revisiting old ground with the storyline, Woodburne said the new conflict, which arises within Karl and Susan's relationship, is [...] "very appropriate" [...] for the time of their lives and where they are at.|$|E

6000|$|There {{are plenty}} of {{difficulties}} in this immense task in England, and I {{am not sure that}} I will exclude Scotland, but I said England in order to save your feelings. One of the obstacles is the difficulty of finding out for certain what actually happens. Scare headlines in the bills of important journals are misleading. I am sure many of you must know the kind of mirror that distorts features, elongates lines, makes round what is lineal, and so forth. I assure you that a mirror of that kind does not give you a more grotesque reproduction of the human physiognomy, than some of these tremendous telegrams give you as to what is happening in India. Another point is that the Press is very often flooded with letters from Indians or ex-Indians--from Indicus olim, and others--too oftened coloured with personal partisanship and deep-dyed prepossessions. There is a spirit of caste outside the Hindu sphere. There {{is a great deal of}} writing on the Indian Government by men who have acquired the habit while they were in the Government, and then unluckily retain the habit after they come home and live, or ought to live, in peace and quietness among their friends here. That is another of our difficulties. Still, when all such difficulties are measured and taken account of, it is impossible to overrate the courage, the patience and fidelity, with which the present House of Commons faces what is not at all an easy moment in Indian Government. You talk of democracy. People cry, [...] "Oh! Democracy cannot govern remote dependencies." [...] I do not know; it is a hard question. So far, after one Session of the most Liberal Parliament that has ever sat in Great Britain, this most democratic Parliament so far at all events, has safely rounded an extremely difficult angle. It is quite true that in reference to a certain Indian a Conservative member rashly called out one night in the House of Commons [...] "Why don't you shoot him?" [...] The whole House, Tories, Radicals, and Labour men, they all revolted against any such doctrine as that; and I augur from the proceedings of the last Session--with courage, patience, good sense, and willingness to learn, that democracy, in this case at all events, has shown, and <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>is</b> <b>going</b> <b>to</b> show, its capacity for facing all our problems.|$|E

5000|$|It's such {{a no-brainer}} that {{there needs to}} be female heroes. It's about keeping the stories {{interesting}} and having fresh stories to tell. I always like that about Ant-Man and Wasp because it dealt with gender politics as well as superhero stuff. In the comics, particularly in the '60s comics, the Janet van Dyne Wasp was clearly written by all men and was pretty one-dimensional. She’s gotten much more dimensionalized since then. That's one of those things that <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>is</b> <b>going</b> <b>to</b> be really exciting and fresh about this movie. You do feel a certain amount of responsibility. At the end of the day it's organic to that character and the movie. —Director Peyton Reed, on the Wasp's inclusion in the film. In June 2015, Peyton Reed, director of Ant-Man, stated, [...] "If we were lucky enough to be able to do a sequel or even a prequel, I'd be way into it. I've really fallen in love with these characters... There's a lot of story to tell with Hank Pym." [...] In July, Michael Douglas, who portrayed Pym, expressed the desire to have his wife Catherine Zeta-Jones play Janet van Dyne, while Evangeline Lilly hoped to see Michelle Pfeiffer in the role. Douglas also revealed he was not signed for any additional films, but [...] "would look forward to more if it comes my way". Producer Kevin Feige revealed that the studio had [...] "a supercool idea for the next Ant-Man film, and if audiences want it, we'll find a place to do it." [...] Reed also mentioned that there had been talks of doing a standalone adventure with Hank Pym as Ant-Man, possibly including the original opening to Ant-Man that featured Jordi Mollà, which had been cut from the final film. Eric Eisenberg of Cinema Blend opined that a standalone adventure with Pym and the cut sequence would be a good candidate to revive the Marvel One-Shots short film series. By the end of the month, David Dastmalchian expressed interest in returning for a sequel as Kurt.|$|E
5000|$|For Murray, in {{addition}} to their shared abandonment issues, Lucas's love for literature also appealed to him.

Woodburne has named the Karl, Susan and Izzy love triangle {{as one of her}} favourite storylines. Woodburne believes that Karl and Susan have a strong connection that is [...] "based upon such a good grounding". Karl and Susan are best friends who enjoy each other's company, share a deep connection and take joy in each other's quirks and ways. Woodburne described them as having a [...] "really solid foundation for a marriage" [...] and she has said that she does not want to see Susan and Karl's relationship break up again.

Karl and Susan have been caught in the nude together on three occasions; at the beach, in Lou Carpenter's (Tom Oliver) spa and when they went skinny-dipping in the bush. When asked what makes Karl and Susan popular with viewers, Woodburne said [...] "Because I think they're so flawed. There's two things: they make horrendous mistakes, both of them, but they both are coming from a place of well meaning.
