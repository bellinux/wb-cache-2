40|$|Cisplatin is {{a widely}} {{prescribed}} anticancer agent that causes hair loss in patients. Since the dermal papilla (DP) fibroblasts {{are known to be}} a key mediator in controlling hair growth and loss, understanding the effect and underlying mechanism of cisplatin on these cells may lead to new strategy for <b>hair</b> loss <b>protection</b> in chemotherapy patients.

We thus treated DP cells with cisplatin (0 - 250 mmol/L) and found that cisplatin induced DP cell death in a concentration-dependent manner.

40|$|Background: Hearing Preservation is {{becoming}} increasingly important in cochlear implantation as there is growing evi-dence that preserving the residual hearing, especially in the low frequencies {{in combination with the}} electric stimulation can significantly improve hearing and speech outcomes in noise. Besides the ongoing development of atraumatic implant electro-des and insertion techniques, the implementation of pharmacologic <b>hair</b> cell <b>protection</b> is thought to increase hearing preser-vation. This study investigates the effects of preoperative intratympanic glucocorticoid application on hearing preservation rates in cochlear implantation. Study Design: Prospective interventional study. Setting: Tertiary neurotology referral center. Patients: Patients undergoing cochlear implantation with measurable preoperative hearing thresholds using either a Flex soft electrode or a Flex EAS electrode depending on the degree of residual low frequency hearing. Intervention: Preoperative intratympanic steroid application during cochlear implantation via round window insertion.

40|$|Cisplatin {{has been}} {{regarded}} as an effective and versatile chemotherapeutic agent for nearly 40 years. Though the associated dose-dependent ototoxicity is known, the cellular mechanisms by which cochleovestibular hair cell death occur are not well understood. We have previously shown that aminoglycoside ototoxicity is mediated in part by cytosolic protein synthesis inhibition. Despite a lack of molecular similarity, aminoglycosides were shown to elicit similar stress pathways to cisplatin. We therefore reasoned {{that there may be}} some role of protein synthesis inhibition in cisplatin ototoxicity. Employing a modification of the bioorthogonal noncanonical amino acid tagging (BONCAT) method, we evaluated the effects of cisplatin on cellular protein synthesis. We show that cisplatin inhibits cellular protein synthesis in organ of Corti explant cultures. Similar to what was found after gentamicin exposure, cisplatin activates both the c-Jun N-terminal kinase (JNK) and mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR) pathways. In contrast to aminoglycosides, cisplatin also inhibits protein synthesis in all cochlear cell types. We further demonstrate that the multikinase inhibitor sorafenib completely prevents JNK activation, while providing only moderate <b>hair</b> cell <b>protection.</b> Simultaneous stimulation of cellular protein synthesis by insulin, however, significantly improved hair cell survival in culture. The presented data provides evidence for a potential role of protein synthesis inhibition in cisplatin-mediated ototoxicity...|$|R
40|$|Reactive {{oxygen species}} are {{important}} elements in ototoxic damage to hair cells (HCs), appearing {{early in the}} damage process. Higher levels of natural antioxidants are positively correlated with resistance to ototoxins and many {{studies have shown that}} exogenous antioxidants can protect HCs from damage. While a very wide variety of antioxidants with different characteristics and intracellular targets exist, most ototoxicity studies have focused upon one or a few well-characterized compounds. Relatively little research has attempted to determine the comparative efficacy of large variety of different antioxidants. This has been in part {{due to the lack of}} translation between cell culture and in vivo measures of efficacy. To circumvent this limitation, we used an in vitro assay based on micro-explants from the basal and middle turns of the neonatal mouse organ of Corti to screen a commercial redox library of diverse antioxidant compounds for their ability to protect mammalian HCs from a high dose of the ototoxic antibiotic gentamicin. The library included several antioxidants that have previously been studied as potential treatments for HC damage, as well as many antioxidants that have never been applied to ototoxicity. The micro-explants were treated with 200 μM gentamicin alone, gentamicin plus one of three dosages of a redox compound, the highest dosage of compound alone, or were untreated. HC counts were determined before the gentamicin insult and at 1, 2, and 3 days afterward to evaluate the HC survival. From a total of 81 antioxidant compounds, 13 exhibited significant protection of HCs. These included members of a variety of antioxidant classes with several novel antioxidants, not previously tested on HCs, appearing to alleviate the damaging gentamicin effect. Some compounds previously shown to be protective of HCs were correspondingly protective in this in vitro screen, while others were not. Finally, one of the three pro-oxidant compounds included in the library as well as six antioxidants exhibited evidence of toxicity in the absence of gentamicin. The results demonstrate the wide variability in the ability of antioxidants to protect HCs from high-dose gentamicin damage, and identify promising candidate leads for further study as potential drug targets.

40|$|Clinical ototoxicityâpermanent {{hearing loss}} caused by medicationsâis {{estimated}} to affect millions of patients annually. Two classes of drug are largely to blame: platinum-based chemotherapeutics, primarily cisplatin, and aminoglycoside antibiotics. Development of methods to prevent ototoxicity depends upon {{an understanding of}} its mechanisms and may benefit from an understanding of native protective pathways of the inner ear. As the mechanisms behind cisplatin ototoxicity remain unclear, I first sought, and herein report, a refined mouse model of cisplatin ototoxicity which will allow for further in vivo investigation of cisplatin ototoxicity and potential methods for its prevention. This low-dose, multi-cycle model was found to accurately reproduce cisplatin ototoxicity {{as it has been}} described clinically and histopathologically. I then used this mouse model of cisplatin ototoxicity to investigate cisplatin pharmacokinetics in the cochlea and their role in driving cisplatin ototoxicity. Cisplatin was found to be retained within the cochlea for months following its administration. This initial finding in mice was extended to cochlear tissue samples from deceased human patients. Analysis of intra-cochlear cisplatin distribution in murine and human tissue identified the stria vascularis region of the cochlea as a promising target for intervention. With the nature of aminoglycoside ototoxicity better understood, I investigated a native inner ear protective pathway which could be leveraged to promote sensory hair cell survival. The improved hair cell survival that has previously been demonstrated as a result of heat stress was found to be mediated by cell-cell communication via extracellular vesicles. Further, <b>hair</b> cell <b>protection</b> against aminoglycosides could be reproduced through the application of exogenous, non-inner ear-derived extracellular vesicles. In sum, these data provide new insight into mechanisms of ototoxicity and details of cellular pathways which can help protect against it. </p...|$|R
40|$|In humans, most {{hearing loss}} results from death of hair cells, the mechanosensory receptors {{of the inner}} ear. Two goals of current hearing {{research}} are to protect hair cells from degeneration and to regenerate new hair cells, replacing those that are lost due to aging, disease, or environmental challenges.

5000|$|The only {{difference}} between hair and fur is semantics. Technically, both are made from keratin, {{which is also the}} protein that makes up skin, feathers, nails, hooves, claws, and horns. [...] "The way I {{think a lot of people}} understand fur versus hair is in the density of follicles," [...] says Ross McPhee, Curator of the Department of Mammalogy at the American Museum of Natural History. [...] "So for fur-bearing animals—which were converted into coats and so-forth—people always wanted it to be something that was very dense, so there’s the idea therefore that fur is dense, and it certainly is in the kinds of fur-bearers that we use for this purpose. Whereas hair is not so dense. There's less of it." [...] This remains untrue however, because the human head has as the same [...] "follicle density" [...] as a mouse, but it just so happens to be genetically predisposed to stop at the head and not continue down the body. [...] There are three types of hair: ground hair, guard hair, and whiskers. [...] "Ground hair is used primarily as insulation and is soft, while guard <b>hair</b> is for <b>protection</b> from the elements and tends to be coarse." [...] Both ground hair and guard hair are classified as fur. Because human hair acts as both, it can technically be called [...] "fur".

40|$|In {{the present}} study, the {{influence}} of hypoxia/ischemia on the cochlea was examined using the organotypic culture of wistar rats (postnatal days 3 - 5). The inner hair cells were shown to be more vulnerable to the two events than the outer hair cells (OHC) with plasma membrane calcium ATPase and electrolytes {{have an important role}} to play. Under ischemic condition, an increase in the potassium (K+) -concentration resulted in protective efficiency. Magnesium and MK 801 (NMDA antagonist) also had protective effects on the hair cells. Growth factors like rhEPO, rhIGF and rhEGF reduced the apoptotic and necrotic hair cell death. The interference of signal pathways may result in a <b>hair</b> cell <b>protection.</b> The gene expression and its changes induced in culture or by hypoxia were examined in 3 cochlear regions: organ of Corti (OC), modiolus (MOD) and stria vascularis (SV). On postnatal days 3 - 5, biological attributes are already pronounced. Genes of calcium and K+ homeostasis were found in the OC, genes of development, maturation and regulation of neuronal structures were found in the MOD, and genes of the ion homeostasis, cochlear blood flow and protection against radicals were found in the SV. In culture, genes of the glucose metabolism, cytokines, Hmox and Mapk 9 were up-regulated in the OC. Genes that are involved into neurotransmission and signal transmission were down-regulated. The most obvious changes were found to occur in the MOD. Changes in the gene expression may indicate preparation- and culture-induced trauma or normal developmental processes, which have different pathways in culture and in vivo. Hypoxia of 5 h duration resulted in small changes. Growth factors, ion channels, genes of neurotransmission were up-regulated in the MOD. Hypoxia-inducible factor- 1 (HIF- 1) is a transcription factor of the adaptation of cells/tissue to hypoxia/ischemia. In the cochlea, the two events led to an activation of HIF- 1 with its highest activities being found in the MOD and OC. The HIF- 1 alpha mRNA value did not change in normoxia and hypoxia, and it was found to be lower in the MOD than in the OC and SV. The expressions of HIF- 1 alpha mRNA and protein did not coursed in parallel. Therefore, the HIF- 1 regulation is assumed to occur on the post-translation level. Therapeutic approaches may be provided by regulation of target genes. The HIF- 1 -dependend genes Slca 1 and Igfbp 2 were highly expressed in the SV in normoxia. In culture, genes that are responsible for glucose metabolism (Gapdh), glucose transport (Slca 1), activity of the growth hormone IGF, iron transport (Tf, Tfrc), blood flow and elimination of reactive oxygen species were highly expressed in the cochlea. Hypoxia induced small changes. In the MOD, Igf 2 increased. The motor protein prestin is of importance for the OHC function. The prestin mRNA value increased two-fold in the OC of the newborn rat during development in vitro and in vivo and an apical-basal gradient developed. In Ischemia, the prestin mRNA expression decreased in parallel to the OHC loss. The present study reports new findings of the effect of hypoxia/ischemia on the cochlea, which may deliver new approaches for the therapy and prevention of hypoxia/ischemia-induced hearing disturbances...|$|R
