50|$|In {{indirect}} firing, {{the fuel}} is ground by an intermittently run mill, {{and the fine}} product is stored in a silo of sufficient size to supply the kiln though fuel mill stoppage periods. The <b>fine</b> <b>fuel</b> is metered out of the silo at a controlled rate and blown into the kiln. This method is now favoured for precalciner systems, because both the kiln and the precalciner can be fed with fuel from the same system. Special techniques are required to store the <b>fine</b> <b>fuel</b> safely, and coals with high volatiles are normally milled in an inert atmosphere (e.g. CO2).|$|E
30|$|The slight {{increase}} in <b>fine</b> <b>fuels</b> (< 2.54 cm in diameter) over the 31 -year post-fire time period in the research plots (Figure 6) {{may be attributed to}} several possibilities. Although data were not collected after the prescribed fire in 1972, observation of the area indicated that many of the understory trees were killed and that about half of the woody and <b>fine</b> <b>fuels</b> were consumed. The increase in <b>fine</b> <b>fuels</b> may be due to post-fire woody fuels from trees killed by the 1972 prescribed fire or from subsequent tree damage or mortality due to non-fire causes. Also, litterfall from the residual stands that may exceed decomposition rates in these relatively productive sites could contribute to the increase in <b>fine</b> <b>fuels.</b> Alternatively, the increase in <b>fine</b> <b>fuels</b> could be attributed to the difference in sampling methods used between the two time periods. In 1971, <b>fine</b> <b>fuels</b> were collected from paired sub-plots and weighed before and after burning, while in 2003, depth measurements were made in the field and converted to fuel load using depth/weight relationships (van Wagtendonk et al. 1998).|$|R
40|$|The {{dynamics}} of the <b>fine</b> forest <b>fuel</b> 2 ̆ 7 s response to moisture changes have not been fully recognized. Fire behavior systems now in use consider all <b>fine</b> <b>fuels</b> to have a 1 -hour response time. Experimental results of testing {{a wide range of}} <b>fine</b> <b>fuels</b> show the change in moisture content does follow a negative exponential in time. In addition, there is great variability in the desorption and adsorption response times of recently cast and weathered materials. Fuels such as cheatgrass stems and leaves, rockhair lichens, and Cladonia spp. have response times of 1 hour or less. However, other needle fuels such as lodgepole pine, Douglas-fir, and Engelmann spruce have response times greater than 15 hours. Adsorption response times are generally longer than desorption. Weathering for 1 year does shorten response times, but they still remain longer than 1 hour. The effect of a weather diurnal cycle is demonstrated...|$|R
30|$|Fuels {{decreased}} {{by reducing the}} shrub layer. As {{was the case with}} B, the <b>fine</b> <b>fuels</b> were comprised primarily of leaves that are not highly flammable. However, there was a greater proportion of <b>fine</b> live <b>fuels</b> (graminoids and herbs) relative to the other treatments. Reductions in basal area increased exposure, which, combined with a more flammable fuel bed, may facilitate fire in MB stands. However, predicted and observed fire intensity in the MB treatment was low relative to the other treatments (Waldrop et al. 2010).|$|R
50|$|The {{condition}} of the herbaceous (live) vegetation and the 1-hr. timelag fuel moisture are then integrated in the calculation the <b>fine</b> <b>fuel</b> moisture (FFM) which expresses the effective moisture content of the fine fuels.|$|E
50|$|The {{moisture}} {{content of the}} dead component of the <b>fine</b> <b>fuel</b> (1-hr. timelag fuel moisture) {{is determined by the}} state of the weather (sunny or cloudy), air temperature, and relative humidity {{at the time of the}} 2 p.m. fire weather observation.|$|E
50|$|The closer {{the initial}} {{temperature}} of the fuel is to the ignition temperature, the more likely a fire will result when a firebrand in introduced into the <b>fine</b> <b>fuel</b> complex, since not a much energy is required to raise the fuel particle to its ignition temperature.|$|E

5000|$|Throughout {{the early}} months of 2017, there was {{significant}} rainfall over most of California thus temporarily mitigating the state's severe drought conditions. However, according to a report published by the National Interagency Fire Center, the potential for large fires was [...] "expected to remain near normal through the spring, but once <b>fine</b> <b>fuels</b> dry out, there will likely be a spike in grass fire activity.” ...|$|R
5000|$|Mitsubishi's new clean {{diesel engines}} use a [...] {{high-pressure}} {{common rail injection system}} to improve combustion efficiency. The 4N13 1.8-liter uses solenoid fuel-injectors. The larger 4N14 2.3-liter engine uses piezo fuel-injectors that produce a <b>finer</b> <b>fuel</b> spray. Both engines feature a fast ceramic glowplug system. The engines {{are designed to}} operate at a lower compression ratio, thus lowering the combustion pressure, allowing the use of an aluminium cylinder block that reduces weight.|$|R
50|$|Fire kills or {{severely}} damages G. microcephala, allowing controlled burns {{to be used}} in {{the management}} of its populations. Burns must be done carefully, as G. microcephala may recolonize burned sites if moisture conditions and competition is favorable, giving mixed success for prescribed burns. Burns can be limited by insufficient amounts fine fuel; if there is enough <b>fine</b> <b>fuel,</b> burns are generally effective if fuel moisture and relative humidity are low, the air temperature is between 24 - 32 C, and there is a gentle breeze.|$|E
5000|$|The Spread Component is {{a rating}} of the forward rate of spread of a headfire. Deeming states that [...] "the spread {{component}} is numerically equal to the theoretical ideal rate of spread expressed in feet-per-minute." [...] This carefully worded statement indicates both guidelines (it's theoretical) and cautions (it's ideal) that must be used when applying the Spread Component. Wind speed, slope and <b>fine</b> <b>fuel</b> moisture are key inputs in the calculations of the spread component, thus accounting for a high variability from day-to-day. The Spread Component is expressed on an open-ended scale; thus it has no upper limit.|$|E
5000|$|... (A {{component}} of the NFDRS-National Fire Danger Rating System)The Ignition Component is a number which relates {{the probability that a}} fire will result if a firebrand is introduced into a <b>fine</b> <b>fuel</b> complex. The ignition component can range from 0 when conditions are cool and damp, to 100 on days when the weather is dry and windy. Theoretically, on a day when the ignition component registers a 60 approximately 60% of all fire brands that come into contact with wildland fuels will require suppression action. Ignition normally takes place in the dead {{component of}} the fine fuels. Three distinct steps must be considered in this ignition process.|$|E
30|$|If {{the fuel}} loads in the 1971 pre-fire {{research}} plots are anomalously low {{due to a}} different sampling method (<b>fine</b> <b>fuels)</b> or transect length used (woody fuels), then the 31 -year post-fire fuel loads may not have actually increased over pre-fire levels, but are rather, an artifact of the sampling method. In any case, when all fuels are included, the 31 -year post-fire fuel loads are similar to, or slightly less than, those in untreated areas. These results could indicate that decomposition may be approaching fuel accumulation rates after about 30 years without treatment, {{consistent with the findings}} of Kittredge (1955). Although total fuel load increased somewhat in the unburned ponderosa pine monitoring plots after 50 – 90 years without fire, basal area was much higher (59.9 m 2 ha− 1) than that for the research plots or burned monitoring plots. A difference in basal area may account for the variation in fuel accumulation patterns among the different ponderosa pine forest sampling sites. Continued monitoring of these unburned areas is necessary to confirm whether the <b>fine</b> <b>fuels</b> and the larger woody fuel components continue to increase or whether accumulation has stabilized.|$|R
40|$|Anthropogenic {{fires in}} {{seasonally}} dry tropical forests are a regular occurrence {{during the dry}} season. Forest managers in India, who presently follow a fire suppression policy in such forests, would benefit from a system of assessing the potential risk to fire on a particular day. We {{examined the relationship between}} weather variables (seasonal rainfall, relative humidity, temperature) and days of fire during the dry seasons of 2004 - 2010, based on MODIS fire incident data in the seasonally dry tropical forests of Mudumalai in the Western Ghats, southern India. Logistic regression analysis showed that high probabilities of a fire day, indicating successful ignition of litter and grass fuel on the forest floor, were associated with low levels of early dry season rainfall, low daily average relative humidity and high daily average temperatures. These weather conditions are representative of low moisture levels of <b>fine</b> <b>fuels,</b> suggesting that the occurrence of fire is moderated by environmental conditions that reduce the flammability of <b>fine</b> <b>fuels</b> in the dry tropics. We propose a quantitative framework for assessing risk of a fire day to assist forest managers in anticipating fire occurrences in this seasonally dry tropical forest, and possibly for those across South Asia...|$|R
30|$|Fuels {{decreased}} {{by reducing the}} shrub layer but {{at the expense of}} increased <b>fine</b> <b>fuels.</b> Until these fuels decompose, they may make the stand more susceptible to wildfire. Predictive models suggest that these wildfires would be very intense and have rapid spread rates (Waldrop et al. 2010). If such fires were to occur, desirable levels of overstory mortality, herbaceous layer establishment, and oak regeneration could result (Hagan et al. 2015). However, relying on a wildfire to meet restoration objectives is not recommended.|$|R
50|$|The {{design of}} the CRPU was {{extremely}} simple. The tubing was strong enough that the propellants were fed to the engine by pressure alone. This eliminated the need for turbopumps. The engine was ablatively cooled, {{eliminating the need for}} <b>fine</b> <b>fuel</b> passages and heat-resistant kerosene. The engine did not gimbal; instead, the vehicle was steered by throttling one side's CRPUs versus the opposite side. Thus, the engine was simply built into the tube walls, with the only mechanisms being the throttling valves. No separate pressurising system was included; the tanks were simply left with an ullage space, which was then filled with gas to a few hundred psi. Because of the narrow tubing, the bulkheads between sections could be simple plates, instead of domes like virtually all other rocket stages. There was no ignition system; instead, a slug of furfuryl alcohol was injected before the kerosene. The furfuryl alcohol ignited spontaneously upon contact with the nitric acid.|$|E
30|$|An ISI {{value of}} 5.5 is {{equivalent}} to a 10 m wind speed of approximately 2.7 km h− 1 at 10 % <b>fine</b> <b>fuel</b> moisture content; ISI of 6.5 {{is equivalent to}} 10 m winds of 6.0 km h− 1 at 10 % <b>fine</b> <b>fuel</b> moisture.|$|E
40|$|Various {{approaches}} and {{models have been}} developed to determine moisture content for all fuel levels since the amount of moisture in fuel determines how much of the fuel will burn. All well-known integrated rating systems such as the Canadian Forest Fire Weather Index (FWI), the McArthur Fire Danger Index (FDI), the remote sensing based Fire Potential Index (FPI), and the U. S. National Fire Danger Rating System (NFDRS) include sub-models for estimating <b>fine</b> <b>fuel</b> availability and <b>fine</b> <b>fuel</b> moisture. The most commonly used sub-models are the Keetch-Byram Drought Index (KBDI) from Keetch and Byram (1968) and the time lag fuel moisture classes of the NFDRS, the <b>fine</b> <b>fuel</b> moisture, duff and drought codes of the Canadian FWI, and the drought factor and the fuel moisture sub-model of the FDI. In this paper the Fd index was used to investigate the potential for characterization of fuel dryness in Mediterranean shrublands where the canopy volume is larger than in grassland and the fuel includes living vegetation and dead material...|$|E
50|$|The {{index is}} a whole number that ranges between 0 and 20 in France and up to above 30 in Canada. It is {{computed}} from five components. The first three components are numeric ratings of the moisture content of litter and other <b>fine</b> <b>fuels,</b> the average moisture content of loosely compacted organic layers of moderate depth, and the average moisture content of deep, compact organic layers. The last two components are the rate of fire spread if fuel is available for combustion, and the frontal fire intensity.|$|R
40|$|In {{the mixed}} conifer {{forests of the}} Sierra Nevada, it appears that fire {{dynamics}} have changed from predominantly low and moderate intensity surface fires to {{a greater proportion of}} larger, stand-replacing fires. To help reduce fuels and speed the restoration process, the Forest Service harvests dead trees and uses herbicides to control early stages of shrubs. But there are concerns about these post-burn restoration treatments and their infl uence on emerging <b>fine</b> <b>fuels.</b> Some of these treatments have been linked to an increase in annual grass invasions, specifi cally non-native grasses, which have the potential to significantly alter fuel characteristics, promote repeat fires, and hinder forest regeneration efforts. For that reason, the U. S. Geological Survey ecologists and the University of California, Berkeley foresters—with the support of the Forest Service—conducted a scientific study to determine how logging fi re-killed trees and using herbicides affect plant community composition, fuel load, fuel structure, and potential fire behavior in four major fire areas of the Sierra Nevada. By using existing treatments on national forests that have detailed site histories, researchers were able to quantify the effects of restoration treatments on <b>fine</b> <b>fuels</b> over time and to provide the scientific input needed to fine-tune future restoration plans...|$|R
30|$|The {{estimated}} importance {{measure for}} wind speed {{was more than}} three times that of the closest input factor of <b>fine</b> dead <b>fuel</b> moisture. This finding supports the argument that fires burning under Santa Ana conditions are wind driven events, {{to the extent that the}} Rothermel equations in the HFire model structure represent the physical process of fire spread. In contrast, <b>fine</b> dead <b>fuel</b> moisture was responsible for less than 15 % of the variation in simulated fire size. The HFire model is still being improved upon, and the identification of wind speed and <b>fine</b> dead <b>fuel</b> moisture as influential factors contributes to the conceptual validation of the model, as these inputs describe known and expected influential determinants of fire size. This research established that the model behaves in a way that conforms to the expectations for the physical system, increasing the confidence that can be placed in the model predictions.|$|R

40|$|Abstract. Understanding fuel {{dynamics}} in fire-prone ecosystems {{is important because}} fuels {{play a central role}} in shaping fire hazard and behaviour. There is ongoing debate over whether fire hazard continually increases with time since fire in shrublands of Mediterranean-type climates, and studies of the temporal changes in fuel loads can contribute to this discussion. We used a chronosequence of fire ages to investigate fuel dynamics and recovery of vegetation structure in the Acacia-dominated shrublands of interior south-west Western Australia. We collected and measured fuels from vegetation with fire ages ranging from 6 to 80 þ years and then fitted linear, negative exponential, quadratic and logarithmicmodels to explore temporal patterns of fuel accumulation. Components of fine (, 1 cm) fuel (ground, aerial live, aerial dead) and total <b>fine</b> <b>fuel</b> levels were found to accumulate rapidly in the first few years following a fire and then gradually increase for many decades thereafter. On average, total <b>fine</b> <b>fuel</b> was, 10 t ha 1 at 10 years post fire, and, 20 t ha 1 after 40 – 60 years. Akaike’s Information Criterion did not confidently discriminate between linear models and those that plateau at a certain fire age. However, all models showed gradual accumulation of fuel between 10 and 60 years post fire. Dead <b>fine</b> <b>fuel</b> (both litter and aerial) was virtually absent from young shrubland (, 10 years) but accumulated slowly with age and comprised around 40 % of total <b>fine</b> <b>fuel</b> in long-unburnt stands (. 50 years). Although there is some evidence of shrub senescence in very long-unburnt vegetation (. 60 years), no corresponding decline in fuel levels was detected, suggesting lag effects or inter-fire recruitment to maintain vegetation structure and fuel levels. Fuel structure and quantity varied considerabl...|$|E

30|$|Downed woody debris had {{the highest}} {{variability}} in consumption of any fuel variable measured. Generally across sites, DWD decreased in Phases 1 and 2, with the largest reduction in Phase 1. In Phase 3, we generally observed an increase in DWD, particularly in the larger size class (100 -h fuels), but the variability was high across sites. This variability was probably due to continuity of <b>fine</b> <b>fuels</b> {{and their ability to}} carry fire, and also to the wide variety of fuel moisture and weather conditions for which these treatments were implemented across the woodland sites.|$|R
30|$|The other {{vegetation}} types at Mkambati (i.e., {{forests and}} Themeda grasslands) tend to burn much less frequently (> 5 yr), most likely {{as a result}} of localized climatic conditions and different fuel characteristics. Grass fuels are characterized by loosely packed <b>fine</b> <b>fuels,</b> whereas forests have coarser fuels with higher fuel moisture contents (Hoffmann et al. 2012). Being situated along the coast, the Themeda grasslands are influenced by salt spray and wind from the ocean, causing cooler, moister conditions and stunted plant growth form, which likely account for the extended FRIs (Shackleton 1989).|$|R
40|$|Civil {{aircraft}} combustor designs {{will move}} from rich-burn to lean-burn {{due to the}} latter's advantage in low NOx and nvPM emissions. However, the operating range of lean-burn is narrower, requiring premium mixing performance from the fuel injectors. As the OPR increases, the corresponding combustor inlet temperature increase can benefit greatly with fuel composition improvements. Hydro-treatment can improve coking resistance, allowing <b>finer</b> <b>fuel</b> injection orifices to speed up mixing. Selective cetane number control across the fuel carbon-number distribution may allow delayed ignition at high power while maintaining low-power ignition characteristics...|$|R
40|$|The <b>Fine</b> <b>Fuel</b> Moisture Code (FFMC) is a numeric {{rating of}} the {{moisture}} content of litter and other cured fine fuels. This code is {{an indicator of the}} relative ease of ignition and the flammability of <b>fine</b> <b>fuel.</b> This {{is part of a larger}} dataset providing gridded field calculations from the Canadian Fire Weather Index System using weather forcings from the European Centre for Medium-range Weather Forecast (ECMWF) ERA-Interim reanalysis dataset (Di Giuseppe et al., 2016). The dataset has been developed through a collaboration between the Joint Research Centre and ECMWF under the umbrella of the Global Wildfires Information System (GWIS), a joint initiative of the GEO and the Copernicus Work Programs. The whole dataset consists of seven indices, each of which describes a different aspect of the effect that fuel moisture and wind have on fire ignition probability and its behavior, if started. The indices are called: <b>Fine</b> <b>Fuel</b> Moisture Code (FFMC), Duff Moisture Code (DMC), Drought Code (DC), Initial Spread Index (ISI), Build Up Index (BUI), Fire Weather Index (FWI) and Daily Severity Rating (DSR). For convenience, each index is archived separately. This dataset can be manipulated using the caliver R package (Vitolo et al. 2017 a, b).

50|$|Targeted grazing {{is another}} {{tool in the}} land manager’s toolbox for {{constructing}} desirable ecosystems and landscapes. Targeted grazing is often used {{in combination with other}} technologies such as burning, herbicide applications or land clearing. However, in many areas such as large roadless areas or areas where prescribed burning is a major constraint, targeted grazing might be the best and/or only viable alternative. Research and on-the-ground experience have shown that targeted grazing can rival traditional herbicide and mechanical control methods for many invasive plants and has been used to reduce <b>fine</b> <b>fuels</b> in fire prone areas.|$|R
40|$|Fire-prone {{tropical}} savanna and grassland {{systems are}} {{a significant source of}} atmospheric emissions of greenhouse gases.  In recent years, substantial research has been directed towards developing accounting methodologies for savanna burning emissions to be applied in Australia’s National Greenhouse Gas Inventory, as well as for commercial carbon trading purposes.  That work has focused on woody savanna systems.  Here, we extend the methodological approach to include tussock grasslands and associated Melaleuca -dominated open woodlands ( 1, 000 mm/annum) regions of northern Australia.  Field assessments under dry season conditions focused on deriving fuel accumulation, fire patchiness and combustion relationships for key <b>fuel</b> types: <b>fine</b> <b>fuels</b> − grass and litter; coarse woody fuels − twigs 6 mm diameter; and shrubs.  In contrast with previous savanna burning assessments, fire treatments undertaken under early dry season burning conditions resulted in negligible patchiness and very substantial consumption of <b>fine</b> <b>fuels.</b>  In effect, burning in the early dry season provides no benefits in greenhouse gas emissions and emissions reductions in tussock grasslands can be achieved only through reducing the extent of burning.  The practical implications of reduced burning in higher rainfall northern Australian grassland systems are discussed, indicating that there are significant constraints, including infrastructural, cultural and woody thickening issues.  Similar opportunities and constraints are observed in other international contexts, but especially project implementation challenges associated with legislative, political and governance issues...|$|R
30|$|Because {{the young}} juniper {{woodlands}} {{did not have}} an abundance of 1000 -h DWD and exhibited high variability, the observations of these fuel categories were not normally distributed and were therefore excluded from statistical analysis.

For future studies, we recommend longer transects or a different sampling methodology for the 1000 -h fuel categories for fuels assessments in sagebrush steppe and juniper woodlands.|$|R
