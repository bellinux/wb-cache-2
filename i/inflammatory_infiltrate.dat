5|$|The {{cause is}} not entirely clear, but {{is thought to be}} multifactorial. It has even been {{suggested}} that aphthous stomatitis is not a single entity but rather a group of conditions with different causes. Multiple research studies have attempted to identify a causative organism, but aphthous stomatitis appears to be non-contagious, non-infectious and not sexually transmissible. The mucosal destruction is thought {{to be the result of}} a T cell (T lymphocyte) mediated immune response which involves the generation of interleukins and tumor necrosis factor alpha (TNF-α). Mast cells and macrophages are also involved, secreting TNF-α along with the T cells. When early aphthous ulcers are biopsied, the histologic appearance shows a dense <b>inflammatory</b> <b>infiltrate,</b> 80% of which is made up of T cells. Persons with aphthous stomatitis also have circulating lymphocytes which react with peptides 91–105 of heat shock protein 65–60, and the ratio of CD4+ T cells to CD8+ T cells in the peripheral blood of individuals with aphthous stomatitis is decreased.|$|E

40|$|Background/purpose: Although {{some studies}} have shown {{induction}} of cyclooxygenase 2 (COX- 2) in oral lichen planus (OLP), an association between COX- 2 upregulation and OLP clinical severity has not been investigated. Therefore, we aimed to compare COX- 2 expression in OLP with that in normal oral tissues, and to determine correlations between COX- 2 expression and both clinical criteria and visual analog scale (VAS) scores. Materials and methods: COX- 2 expression was studied in 25 OLP and 13 normal oral tissues by immunohistochemistry. Both clinical criteria and VAS scores were {{used to evaluate the}} clinical severity of OLP. The differences in COX- 2 expression between OLP and normal tissues, and the correlations between COX- 2 expression and clinical severity were determined by the nonparametric statistical tests. Results: COX- 2 expression was significantly increased in OLP epithelium when compared with normal epithelium (P <  0. 001), and intense COX- 2 staining in <b>inflammatory</b> <b>infiltrates</b> was observed in the OLP lamina propria. COX- 2 expression in OLP epithelium and <b>inflammatory</b> <b>infiltrates</b> was significantly correlated with the clinical criteria score (r =  0. 428, P =  0. 007, and r =  0. 681, P <  0. 001, respectively), whereas a significant correlation with the VAS score was observed only in OLP <b>inflammatory</b> <b>infiltrates</b> (r =  0. 605, P <  0. 001). Conclusion: Enhanced COX- 2 expression in both OLP epithelium and <b>inflammatory</b> <b>infiltrates</b> correlates well with the clinical severity. An association between VAS score and COX- 2 expression in OLP <b>inflammatory</b> <b>infiltrates</b> suggests an important role of additional COX- 2 expression from inflammation in causing pain in OLP patients...|$|R

25|$|The most {{striking}} histopathological {{changes of the}} aneurysmatic aorta are seen in the tunica media and intima layers. These changes include the accumulation of lipids in foam cells, extracellular free cholesterol crystals, calcifications, thrombosis, and ulcerations and ruptures of the layers. Adventitial <b>inflammatory</b> <b>infiltrate</b> is present.|$|E
25|$|The acute {{pancreatitis}} (acute hemorrhagic pancreatic necrosis) {{is characterized by}} acute inflammation and necrosis of pancreas parenchyma, focal enzymic necrosis of pancreatic fat and vessel necrosis (hemorrhage). These are produced by intrapancreatic activation of pancreatic enzymes. Lipase activation produces the necrosis of fat tissue in pancreatic interstitium and peripancreatic spaces as well as vessel damage. Necrotic fat cells appear as shadows, contours of cells, lacking the nucleus, pink, finely granular cytoplasm. It is possible to find calcium precipitates (hematoxylinophilic). Digestion of vascular walls results in thrombosis and hemorrhage. <b>Inflammatory</b> <b>infiltrate</b> is rich in neutrophils. Due to the pancreas lacking a capsule, the inflammation and necrosis can extend to include fascial layers {{in the immediate vicinity}} of the pancreas.|$|E
500|$|Tissue biopsy is {{not usually}} required, unless to rule out other {{suspected}} conditions such as oral squamous cell carcinoma. The histopathologic appearance is not pathognomonic (the microscopic appearance is not specific to the condition). Early lesions have a central zone of ulceration covered by a fibrinous membrane. In the connective tissue deep to the ulcer there is increased vascularity and a mixed <b>inflammatory</b> <b>infiltrate</b> composed of lymphocytes, histiocytes and polymorphonuclear leukocytes. The epithelium {{on the margins of}} the ulcer shows spongiosis and there are many mononuclear cells in the basal third. There are also lymphocytes and histiocytes in the connective tissue surrounding deeper blood vessels near to the ulcer, described histologically as [...] "perivascular cuffing".|$|E
40|$|Buruli ulcer (BU) is a devastating, necrotizing, {{tropical}} {{skin disease}} caused by infections with Mycobacterium ulcerans. In contrast to other mycobacterioses, BU {{has been associated}} with minimal or absent inflammation. However, here we show that in the mouse M. ulcerans induces persistent inflammatory responses with viru-lence- dependent patterns. Mycolactone-positive, cytotoxic strains are virulent for mice and multiply progres-sively, inducing both early and persistent acute inflammatory responses. The cytotoxicity of these strains leads to progressive destruction of the <b>inflammatory</b> <b>infiltrates</b> by postapoptotic secondary necrosis, generating necrotic acellular areas with extracellular bacilli released by the lysis of infected phagocytes. The necrotic areas, always surrounded by acute <b>inflammatory</b> <b>infiltrates,</b> expand through the progressive invasion of healthy tissues around the initial necrotic lesions by bacteria and by newly recruited acute inflammatory cells. Our observations show that the lack of <b>inflammatory</b> <b>infiltrates</b> in the extensive areas of necrosis seen in advanced infections results from the destruction of continuously produced <b>inflammatory</b> <b>infiltrates</b> and not from M. ulcerans-induced local or systemic immunosuppression. Whether this is the mechanism behind the predomi-nance of minimal or absent inflammatory responses in BU biopsies remains to be elucidated.

40|$|The {{controversy}} {{on whether}} or not <b>inflammatory</b> <b>infiltrates</b> in chronic lymphocytic thyroiditis predispose to cancer, has now merged into a debate over the role of the <b>inflammatory</b> <b>infiltrates.</b> The question is how and why some cells become transformed and what factors allow them to spread and in some cases become invasive. Here, we show that the amount of inflammatory mediators such as nitric oxide (NO) and high mobility group Box 1 protein (HMGB 1) produced in thyroiditis microenvironment increases in tumors and could be involved in the cellular transformation process. NO and HMGB 1 are known to attract macrophages that would promote angiogenesis, matrix remodelling and suppression of an efficient immune response. <b>Inflammatory</b> <b>infiltrates</b> could increase the risk of papillary cancer in patients with autoimmune lymphocytic thyroiditis. Cytokines and soluble inflammatory mediators involved in cancer-related inflammation are not only a target for innovative diagnostic and therapeutic strategies but they also represent a future challenge for oncologists...|$|R
30|$|It {{has been}} shown [16] that active {{inflammation}} (as defined by findings of inflamed mucosa or <b>inflammatory</b> <b>infiltrates</b> on endoscopy or histopathology respectively) has {{a greater degree of}} mural thickening on MRE (Fig.  4 a, b) compared with chronic inflammation or fibrostenotic disease (mean maximal wall thickness 6.7  mm versus 3.3  mm respectively). A direct positive correlation has been demonstrated between the degree of acute inflammation on histopathology (defined by an acute inflammatory score) and the degree of mural thickening on MRE [17]. This is not surprising as mural thickening is probably due to a combination of oedema and <b>inflammatory</b> <b>infiltrates.</b>|$|R

Methods:  Mice of different ages were used. <b>Inflammatory</b> <b>infiltrates</b> were quantified using the focus score. Acinar aquaporin- 5 subcellular distribution was determined by immunohistochemistry and quantified using labelling indices. Results:  Minor <b>inflammatory</b> <b>infiltrates</b> were present in r 1 f/r 2 n mice. Massive <b>inflammatory</b> <b>infiltrates</b> and acinar destruction were observed in 24 -week-old non-obese diabetic mice, 10 -and 13 -month-old IQI/JIC mice and some r 1 ΔT/r 2 n mice.

METHODS [...] Synthetic peptides (16 - 33 amino acids in length) representing selected amino acid sequences of the rubella virus envelope (E 1 and E 2) and capsid (C) proteins were used in lymphocyte stimulation assays with peripheral blood mononuclear cells or synovial <b>inflammatory</b> <b>infiltrates</b> to determine T lymphocyte {{recognition of}} antigenic sites within the synthetic peptides. A rubella virus specific polymerase chain reaction was used to determine the persistence of rubella virus in the patient's cells. RESULTS [...] The patient's peripheral blood mononuclear cells showed abnormally increased lymphoproliferative responses to three E 1 synthetic peptides encompassing residues 219 - 234, 389 - 411, and 462 - 481, and one E 2 synthetic peptide containing the sequence 50 - 72, of which the last three were predicted to contain T cell antigenic sites. Although the patient's peripheral blood mononuclear cells showed positive proliferative responses to C synthetic peptides, these were not unusual. The number of synthetic peptides within the E 1, E 2, and C panels recognised by the patient's peripheral blood mononuclear cells was greater than was previously observed in normal healthy subjects. The recognition of synthetic peptides by synovial <b>inflammatory</b> <b>infiltrates</b> was similar to peripheral blood mononuclear cells but the responses measured were lower. The polymerase chain reaction was negative for rubella virus detection in peripheral blood mononuclear cells and synovial <b>inflammatory</b> <b>infiltrates.</b> CONCLUSIONS [...] Abnormally increased T cell recognition of antigenic sites within rubella virus E 1 and E 2 proteins observed in this patient with rubella associated arthritis suggests chronic antigenaemia due to persistent rubella virus in tissue sites other than peripheral blood mononuclear cells or synovial <b>inflammatory</b> <b>infiltrates...</b>|$|R

We used in situ hybridization to analyze the expression of fibrinolytic genes in aneurysm wall from eight AAA patients. All specimens exhibited specific areas of <b>inflammatory</b> <b>infiltrates</b> with macrophage-like cells expressing urokinase-type plasminogen activator (u-PA) and tissue-type PA (t-PA) mRNA. Type 1 PA inhibitor (PAI- 1) mRNA was expressed {{at the base of the}} necrotic atheroma of all specimens and also within some of the <b>inflammatory</b> <b>infiltrates</b> where it frequently colocalized in regions containing u-PA and t-PA mRNA expressing cells. However, in these areas, the cellular distribution of the transcripts for t-PA and u-PA extended far beyond the areas of PAI- 1 expression. These observations suggest a local ongoing proteolytic process, one which is only partially counteracted by the more restricted expression of PAI- 1 mRNA. An abundance of capillaries was also obvious in all <b>inflammatory</b> <b>infiltrates</b> and may reflect local angiogenesis in response to active pericellular fibrinolysis. The increased fibrinolytic capacity in AAA wall may promote angiogenesis and contribute to local proteolytic degradation of the aortic wall leading to physical weakening and active expansion of the aneurysm...|$|R
