We examine processes of graphitic carbon emplacement and deformation {{in the active}} Alpine Fault Zone, New Zealand by analysing samples obtained from Deep Fault Drilling Project (DFDP) boreholes. Optical and scanning electron microscopy reveal a microtextural record of graphite mobilization {{as a function of}} temperature and ductile then brittle shear strain. Raman spectroscopy allowed interpretation of the degree of graphite crystallinity, which reflects both thermal and mechanical processes. In the amphibolite-facies Alpine Schist, highly crystalline graphite, indicating peak metamorphic temperatures up to 6408 C, occurs mainly on grain boundaries within quartzo-feldspathic domains. The subsequent mylonitization process resulted in the reworking of graphite under lower temperature conditions (500 - 6008 C), resulting in clustered (in protomylonites) and foliation-aligned graphite (in mylonites). In cataclasites, derived from the mylonitized schists, graphite is most abundant (, 50 % as opposed to, 10 % elsewhere), and has two different habits: inherited mylonitic graphite and less mature patches of potentially hydrothermal graphitic carbon.

40|$|Graphite {{deposits}} {{result from}} the metamorphism of sedimentary rocks rich in carbonaceous matter or from precipitation from carbon-bearing fluids (or melts). The latter process forms vein deposits which are structurally controlled and usually occur in granulites or igneous rocks. The origin of carbon, the mechanisms of transport, and the factors controlling <b>graphite</b> <b>deposition</b> are discussed {{in relation to their}} geological settings. Carbon in granulite-hosted graphite veins derives from sublithospheric sources or from decarbonation reactions of carbonate-bearing lithologies, and it is transported mainly in CO 2 -rich fluids from which it can precipitate. Graphite precipitation can occur by cooling, water removal by retrograde hydration reactions, or reduction when the CO 2 -rich fluid passes through relatively low-fO 2 rocks. In igneous settings, carbon is derived from assimilation of crustal materials rich in organic matter, which causes immiscibility and the formation of carbon-rich fluids or melts. Carbon in these igneous-hosted deposits is transported as CO 2 and/or CH 4 and eventually precipitates as graphite by cooling and/or by hydration reactions affecting the host rock. Independently of the geological setting, vein graphite is characterized by its high purity and crystallinity, which are required for applications in advanced technologies. In addition, recent discovery of highly crystalline graphite precipitation from carbon-bearing fluids at moderate temperatures in vein deposits might provide an alternative method for the manufacture of synthetic graphite suitable for these new applications...|$|E
40|$|Massive <b>graphite</b> <b>deposition</b> {{resulting}} in volumetrically large occurrences in volcanic environments is usually hindered {{by the low}} carbon contents of magmas and by the degassing processes occurring during and after magma emplacement. In spite of this, two graphite deposits are known worldwide associated with volcanic settings, at Borrowdale, UK, and Huelma, Spain. As inferred from the Borrowdale deposit, graphite mineralization resulted from the complex interaction of several factors, {{so it can be}} considered as an example of self-organized critical systems. These factors, in turn, could be used as potential guides for exploration. The key factors influencing graphite mineralization in volcanic settings are as follows: (1) an unusually high carbon content of the magmas, {{as a result of the}} assimilation of carbonaceous metasedimentary rocks; (2) the absence of significant degassing, related to the presence of sub-volcanic rocks or hypabyssal intrusions, acting as barriers to flow; (3) the exsolution of a carbon-bearing aqueous fluid phase; (4) the local structural heterogeneity (represented at Borrowdale by the deep-seated Burtness Comb Fault); (5) the structural control on the deposits, implying an overpressured, fluid-rich regime favouring a focused fluid flow; (6) the temperature changes associated with fluid flow and hydration reactions, {{resulting in}} carbon supersaturation in the fluid, and leading to disequilibrium in the system. This disequilibrium is regarded as the driving force for massive graphite precipitation through irreversible mass-transfer reactions. Therefore, the formation of volcanic-hosted graphite deposits can be explained in terms of a self-organized critical system. ...|$|E

Carbon isotope ratios in fluid-deposited graphite are powerful tools for unravelling the ultimate origin of carbon (organic matter, mantle, or carbonates) and help to constrain the fluid history and the mechanisms involved in <b>graphite</b> <b>deposition.</b> Graphite precipitation in fluid-deposited occurrences results from CO 2 - and/or CH 4 -bearing aqueous fluids. Fluid flow {{can be considered as}} both a closed (without replenishment of the fluid) or an open system (with renewal of the fluid by successive fluid batches). In closed systems, carbon isotope systematics in graphite is mainly governed by Rayleigh precipitation and/or by changes in temperature affecting the fractionation factor between fluid and graphite. Such processes result in zoned graphite crystals or in successive graphite generations showing, in both cases, isotopic variation towards progressive 13 C or 12 C enrichment (depending upon the dominant carbon phase in the fluid, CO 2 or CH 4, respectively). In open systems, in which carbon is episodically introduced along the fracture systems, the carbon systematics is more complex and individual graphite crystals may display oscillatory zoning because of Rayleigh precipitation or heterogeneous variations of δ 13 C values when mixing of fluids or changes in the composition of the fluids are the mechanisms responsible for graphite precipitation...|$|E
40|$|The volcanic-hosted {{graphite}} deposit at Borrowdale in Cumbria, UK, {{was formed}} through precipitation from C–O–H fluids. The δ 13 C {{data indicate that}} carbon was incorporated into the mineralizing fluids by assimilation of carbonaceous metapelites of the Skiddaw Group by andesite magmas of the Borrowdale Volcanic Group. The graphite mineralization occurred as the fluids migrated upwards through normal conjugate fractures forming the main subvertical pipe-like bodies. The mineralizing fluids evolved from CO 2 –CH 4 –H 2 O mixtures (XCO 2 = 0. 6 – 0. 8) to CH 4 –H 2 O mixtures. Coevally with <b>graphite</b> <b>deposition,</b> the andesite and dioritic wall rocks adjacent to the veins were intensely hydrothermally altered to a propylitic assemblage. The initial graphite precipitation was probably triggered by the earliest hydration reactions in the volcanic host rocks. During the main mineralization stage, graphite precipitated along the pipe-like bodies due to CO 2 → C + O 2. This agrees with the isotopic data which indicate that the first graphite morphologies crystallizing from the fluid (cryptocrystalline aggregates) are isotopically lighter than those crystallizing later (flakes). Late chlorite–graphite veins were formed from CH 4 -enriched fluids following the reaction CH 4 + O 2 → C + 2 H 2 O, producing the successive precipitation of isotopically lighter graphite morphologies. Thus, as mineralization proceeded, water-generating reactions were involved in graphite precipitation, further favouring the propylitic alteration. The structural features of the pipe-like mineralized bodies {{as well as the}} isotopic homogeneity of graphite suggest that the mineralization occurred in {{a very short period of}} time. ...|$|E

40|$|The {{reaction}} kinetics and reversibility for hydrogen sorption were investigated for supported Mg 2 Cu nanoparticles on carbon. A new preparation method is proposed to synthesize the supported alloy nanoparticles. The motivation {{of using a}} support is to separate the nanoparticles to prevent sintering at elevated temperatures. Supported nanocrystallites with an average size of 20 nm were obtained on porous graphite and larger particles (300 nm) on non-porous <b>graphite</b> by first <b>deposition</b> of metallic Cu species, using solution impregnation, followed by addition of molten Mg and hydrogenation. The temperature for hydrogen release of the 20 nm particles was much lower (150 C) than the micronsized material, and the reaction was reversible with the same improved kinetic performance after several hydrogen sorption cycles. The 20 nm Mg 2 Cu crystallites had a lower activation energy for the hydrogen desorption reaction compared to the bulk material (97 (9) and 128 (6) kJ mol 1 respectively). A desorption enthalpy of 66 (3) kJ mol 1 and an entropy value of 126 (10) J mol K 1 were found for this system. The use of a porous carbon support was beneficial for obtaining Mg 2 Cu nanoparticles, which improved the hydrogen sorption kinetics...|$|R
40|$|International audienceThe {{scanning}} vibrating electrode technique (SVET) {{was employed}} to investigate oxygen reduction catalysis {{by the presence of}} enzyme in an aerobic medium. Heme protoporphyrin (hemin) was chosen as a model of the enzymes that are able to catalyze oxygen reduction. A strict experimental protocol was defined for preparing the <b>graphite</b> surface by <b>deposition</b> of hemin with a simple configuration mimicking the presence of enzyme on the samples. The same configuration was adapted to a stainless steel electrode. Different geometric arrangementswere investigated by SVET to approach the local conditions. The results demonstrated that hemin deposited on the electrode surface led to an increase in the cathodic current, which indicated a catalytic effect. Based on the SVET analysis, itwas demonstrated that hemin caused the appearance of galvanic cells on the material surface. The SVET proved able to locate active catalytic centres and therefore to foresee the contribution of the enzyme to the creation of galvanic cells, thus leading to localized corrosion.

30|$|The {{distributions}} of sizes of silver nanoparticles that were deposited on monolayer, bilayer, and trilayer graphene films were observed. Deposition {{was carried out}} by thermal evaporation and the graphene films, placed on SiO 2 /Si substrates, were obtained by the mechanical splitting of <b>graphite.</b> Before the <b>deposition,</b> optical microscopy and Raman spectroscopy were utilized to identify the number of the graphene layers. After the deposition, scanning electron microscopy was used to observe the morphologies of the particles. Systematic analysis revealed that the average sizes of the nanoparticles increased with the number of graphene layers. The density of nanoparticles decreased as the number of graphene layers increased, revealing a large variation in the surface diffusion strength of nanoparticles on the different substrates. The mechanisms of formation of these layer-dependent morphologies of silver on n-layer graphene are related to the surface free energy and surface diffusion of the n-layer graphene. The effect of the substrate such as SiO 2 /Si was investigated by fabricating suspended graphene, and the size and density were similar to those of supported graphene. Based on a comparison of the results, the different morphologies of the silver nanoparticles on different graphene layers were theorized to be caused only by the variation of the diffusion barriers with the number of layers of graphene.|$|R
40|$|Pulsed Laser Deposition (PLD) {{has been}} shown to be an {{effective}} method for producing a wide variety of thin films of high-value-added materials. The high average powers and high pulse repetition frequencies of lasers under development at LLNL make it possible to scale-up PLD processes that have been demonstrated in small systems in a number of university, government, and private laboratories to industrially meaningful, economically feasible technologies. A copper vapor laser system at LLNL has been utilized to demonstrate high rate PLD of high quality diamond-like-carbon (DLC) from <b>graphite</b> targets. The <b>deposition</b> rates for PLD obtained with a 100 W laser were {approx} 2000 {mu}m{center_dot}cm{sup 2 }/h, or roughly 100 times larger than those reported by chemical vapor deposition (CVD) or physical vapor deposition (PVD) methods. Good adhesion of thin (up to 2 pm) films has been achieved on a small number of substrates that include SiO{sub 2 } and single crystal Si. Present results indicate that the best quality DLC films can be produced at optimum rates at power levels and wavelengths compatible with fiber optic delivery systems. If this is also true of other desirable coating systems, this PLD technology could become an extremely attractive industrial tool for high value added coatings...|$|R
40|$|An {{experimental}} {{activity was}} performed to observe and {{study the effects of}} <b>graphite</b> dispersion and <b>deposition</b> on thermal hydraulic phenomena in a Reactor Cavity Cooling System (RCCS). The small scale RCCS experimental facility (16. 5 cm x 16. 5 cm x 30. 4 cm) used for this activity represents half of the reactor cavity with an electrically heated vessel. Water flowing through five vertical pipes removes the heat produced in the vessel and releases it in the environment by mixing with cold water in a large tank. PIV technique was used to study the velocity field of the air inside the cavity. A set of 52 thermocouples was installed in the facility to monitor the temperature profiles of the vessel and pipes walls and air. 10 g of a fine graphite powder (particle size average 2 [mu]m) were injected into the cavity through a spraying nozzle placed {{at the bottom of the}} vessel. Temperatures and air velocity field were recorded and compared with the measurements obtained before the graphite dispersion, showing a decrease of the temperature surfaces which was related to an increase in their emissivity. The results contribute to the understanding of the RCCS capability in case of an accident scenario...|$|R
40|$|The {{decommissioning}} {{of nuclear}} power plants {{around the world will}} produce a major waste stream of irradiated graphite. Graphite has been used extensively as a reactor moderator and reflector material that becomes irradiated and contaminated over time. In the coming years 250, 000 tonnes of irradiated graphite will require management making this a significant waste management issue worldwide. Irradiated graphite is categorised as Intermediate Level Waste mostly due to its content of Carbon- 14 (C- 14) which is a long-lived radioisotope which could be released into the biosphere. In addition the Low Level Waste (LLW) repository at Drigg has very strict guidelines regarding C- 14 authorisation and there is currently no deep geological repository available in the UK. Varying amounts of carbonaceous deposits have been identified on irradiated graphite samples removed from reactor cores. If these deposits are rich in C- 14, treatment of the waste graphite by oxidation could reduce the C- 14 inventory of the remaining graphite. This is the primary focus of this research. In order to investigate a technique that would decontaminate graphite from the carbonaceous deposits it was necessary to produce a range of carbonaceous deposits on virgin graphite material to act as a simulant for the deposits present on reactor <b>graphite.</b> Two <b>deposition</b> techniques were investigated: microwave plasma assisted chemical vapour deposition and a combination of solution deposition and charring. C- 13 precursors were used as they facilitate the study of the selective removal of the deposit by mass spectrometry and spectroscopy. Using C- 13 analogues instead of C- 14 prevents the need to work in active laboratories and allows higher concentrations of deposit to be used which is beneficial when developing a technique for selective removal. A thermal treatment which utilised the application of a vacuum was investigated to determine whether the carbonaceous deposits could be selectively removed with minimal oxidation to the underlying graphite. As carbon deposits were more amorphous than crystalline graphite it was thought that they would oxidise quicker at lower temperatures than graphite. Virgin graphite and samples with deposits were characterised before and after thermal treatment using Scanning Electron Microscopy, Raman Spectroscopy, Thermal Gravimetric Analysis and Mass Spectrometry. An additional area of investigation was conducted using thermogravimetric studies of the oxidation of irradiated graphite which was carried out at the National Nuclear Laboratory’s Preston Lab. This would determine the distribution of C- 14 in the carbonaceous deposits and underlying irradiated graphite which could be a key factor in the determination of possible treatments and eventual storage/disposal routes of the waste graphite...|$|R
30|$|Graphene, a 2 D carbon material with one-atom thickness, {{has become}} one of the hottest {{research}} topics in the field of biosensors. Similar to CNTs, sp 2 -bonded carbon atoms in graphene are closely packed in a honeycomb lattice structure. Owing to their unusual structure, graphene and its derivatives exhibit several extraordinary properties including high thermal conductivity, tunable optical property, high planar surface, superior elasticity, and mechanical strength [90]. In addition, many research results have revealed that graphene and its derivatives possess remarkable electronic properties, such as a high quantum Hall effect at room temperature [91], an ambipolar electric field effect along with ballistic conduction of charge carriers [92], electron–hole symmetry, and internal degrees of freedom [93]. These notable properties make graphene an attractive candidate for the development of the new generation of biosensors with outstanding performance [94, 95]. Currently, there are several physical and chemical methods for producing graphene and graphene-related materials, such as mechanical exfoliation of bulk <b>graphite,</b> chemical vapor <b>deposition</b> (CVD) of hydrocarbons on metal substrates, and chemical or thermal exfoliation of graphite oxide to graphene oxide sheet [94]. Among them, chemical or thermal exfoliation has attracted much attention because of easy operation and high yields of bulk-quantity graphene and graphene oxide. Based on different reduction approaches, thermally reduced graphene oxide (TRGO), chemically reduced graphene oxide (CRGO), and electrochemically reduced graphene oxide (ERGO) can be produced [36]. Although made with different methods, all graphene products made by these methods contain large amounts of defects and oxygen-bearing groups. The presence of these defects can be beneficial to the further functionalization of chemical or biomolecules [96].|$|R
