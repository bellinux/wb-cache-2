Methods: This was a cross-sectional study including 28 cases of FG that were operated in Surgery department of Zahedan University of Medical Sciences during a 10 -year period from April 2002 to March 2012. The study analyzed 9 parameters including the body temperature, heart rate, respiratory rate, hematocrit, {{white blood count}} (WBC), and serum levels of sodium, potassium, creatininee (twice for 2 for acute renal failure), and bicarbonate for <b>Fournier</b> Gangrene Severity <b>Index</b> (FGSI) score. The aspects taken into account were age, gender, predisposing factors, duration of symptoms, hospitalization period, and number of debridements, disease outcome and the FGSI. Results: All patients were males, aged from 26 to 68 years, with mean age 44. 6 ± 8. 49 years.

This study examines whether erosivity can be accurately mapped for Africa using 3 -hourly TRMM Multi-satellite Precipitation Analysis (TMPA) precipitation data.

40|$|Rainfall can be {{the most}} erosive agent with respect to {{rainfall}} induced erosion, particularly {{within the context of a}} tropical maritime environment. Mauritius provides an example of such an environment, which, due to its location and elevated topography, is subject to frequent erosive rainfall events as well as occasional cyclones which potentially threaten loss of soil and may accelerate land degradation. Such intense rainfall forms a key part of the “R-factor” in the USLE and RUSLE soil loss equations, which are commonly used worldwide in deriving the soil loss of an area. This project focuses on various attributes of rainfall erosivity on the central and western parts of Mauritius over a six year assessment period. A steep rainfall gradient exists; 600 mm in the western plains and 4000 mm per year in the higher central region. Rainfall and erosivity attributes are investigated in these two regions on the island to assess the role that topographic elevation has on rainfall erosivity. Using the EI 30 method to find the “R-factor”, erosivity is calculated for the period of 2003 – 2008. Varying time intervals were used in calculating EI 30 to determine the value that high resolution data has in erosivity calculations and is compared to the use of the Modified <b>Fournier</b> <b>Index.</b> This project also speculates on the potential impacts of changing rainfall intensity and erosivity associated with climate change in the future. A difference was found in the erosivity experienced in the elevated central interior and the rain-shadowed western lava plains. Stations on the western plains recorded 25 % of the erosivity experienced by stations in the interior and large differences were found in the number of erosive events, rainfall, erosive rainfall totals, seasonality, and annual erosivity totals of erosivity. The central interior showed greater variability in R-factor values; however these remained similar in extent despite the large difference in total annual rainfall and the number of events that each station recorded. High resolution data did account for erosivity that lower resolution does not, but the extent of erosivity for all stations within the respective regions were markedly similar. Use of the Modified <b>Fournier</b> <b>Index</b> caused erosivity to be overestimated on the island when compared to the EI 30 method. Changes in erosivity are speculated to occur with changes in rainfall intensities but the central interior of the island will notice fluctuations in climate (with respect to rainfall erosivity) more than the western plains.

40|$|The Erosivity Index (EI) and the Modified <b>Fournier</b> <b>Index</b> (MFI) are two {{commonly}} used methods in calculating the R factor {{of the universal}} soil loss equation/ revised universal soil loss equation formula. Using Mauritius as a case study, the value of high-resolution data versus long-term totals in erosivity calculations is investigated. A limited number of four Mauritius Meteorological Services stations located {{on the west coast}} and the Central Plateau provided the study with detailed rainfall data for 6 years at 6 -min intervals. Rainfall erosivity for erosive events was calculated using different set interval data. In this study, within the EI, the use of 6 -min rainfall intervals during erosive rainfall gave estimates of around 10 % more erosivity than the 30 -min time intervals and 33 % more rainfall erosivity than the 60 -min rainfall measurements. When the MFI was used to determine erosivity through annual and monthly rainfall totals, substantially higher erosivity than the EI method was calculated in both regions. This stems from the large amount of non-erosive rainfall that is generated on Mauritius. Even when the MFI was used to calculate erosivity through monthly and annual rainfall totals derived purely from erosive rainfall, erosivity calculations were not comparable to those from high-resolution data within the EI. We suggest that for the computation of erosivity, rainfall data with the highest possible resolution should be utilised if available and that the application of annual and monthly rainfall totals to assess absolute soil erosion risk within a high rainfall tropical environment must be used with caution.

40|$|Purpose: This study {{aimed to}} (1) {{increase}} {{understanding of the}} relation between sediment yield and environmental variables at the catchment scale; (2) test and validate existing and newly developed regression equations for prediction of sediment yield; and (3) identify how better predictions may be obtained. Materials and methods: A correlation and regression analysis was performed between sediment yield and over 40 environmental variables for 61 Spanish catchments. Variables were selected based on availability and expected relation with diverse soil erosion and sediment transport processes. For comparison, the Area Relief Temperature (ART) sediment delivery model was applied to the same catchments. Sediment yield estimates obtained from reservoir surveys were used for model calibration and validation. Results and discussion: Catchment area, catchment perimeter, stream length, relief ratio, Modified <b>Fournier</b> <b>Index,</b> the RUSLE's R factor, and catchments percentage with poor vegetation cover showed highest correlations with sediment yield. Stepwise linear regression revealed that variables representing topography, climate, vegetation, lithology, and soil characteristics are required for the best prediction equation. Although calibration results were relatively good, validation showed that the models were unstable and not suitable for extrapolation to other catchments. Reasons for this unstable model performance include (1) lack of detail and quality of the data sources; (2) large variation in catchment characteristics; (3) insufficient representation of all relevant erosion and sediment transport processes; and (4) the presence of nonlinear relations between sediment yield and environmental variables. The nonlinear ART model performed relatively well but systematically overpredicted sediment yield. A model reflecting human impacts, including dams and conservation measures, is expected to provide better results. This, however, requires significantly more input data. Conclusions: Although important insight is obtained into the relation between sediment yield and environmental factors, prediction of sediment yield at the catchment scale requires alternative approaches. More detailed information is required on land cover (change), and the effect of soil conservation measures. Validation of regression equations is a necessity, and better predictions are obtained by nonlinear models. © 2011 Springer-Verlag. Peer reviewe...|$|E
40|$|Among {{the major}} factors {{controlling}} soil erosion, as vegetation cover or soil erodibility, rainfall erosivity has a paramount importance {{since it is}} difficult to predict and control by humans. Accurate estimation of rainfall erosivity requires continuous rainfall data; however, such data rarely demonstrate good spatial and temporal coverage. Daily weather records are now commonly available, providing good coverage that better represents rainfall intensity behavior than do more aggregated rainfall data. In the present study annual rainfall erosivity was estimated from daily rainfall records, and compared to data obtained employing the RUSLE R factor procedure. A spatially-dense precipitation database of high temporal resolution (15 min) was used. Two methodologies were applied: (i) daily rainfall erosivity estimated using several parametric models, and, (ii) annual rainfall erosivity estimated by regression-based techniques employing several intensity precipitation indices and the modified <b>Fournier</b> <b>index.</b> To determine the accuracy of estimates, several goodness-of-fit and error statistics were computed in addition to a spatial distribution comparison. The daily rainfall erosivity models accurately predicted annual rainfall erosivity. Parametric models with few combined parameters and a periodic function simulating intra-annual rainfall behavior provided the best results. Where daily rainfall records were not available, good estimates of annual rainfall erosivity were also obtained using regression-based techniques based on 5 -day maximum precipitation events, the maximum wet spell duration, and the ratio between the lengths of average wet and dry spells. Inherent limitations remain in the use of daily weather records for estimating rainfall erosivity. Future research should focus on incorporating measures of natural rainfall properties of the particular region, including kinetic energy and intensity, and their effects on the soil.

40|$|An {{analysis}} {{was made of}} the Precipitation Concentration Index using the new MOPREDAS database of monthly precipitation in Spain (Monthly Precipitation Data base of Spain). The database was compiled after exhaustive quality control of the complete digitalized Spanish Meterological Agency (AEMet) archives and contains a total set of 2670 complete and homogeneous monthly precipitation series from 1946 to 2005. Thus, MOPREDAS currently holds the densest information available for the 1946 – 2005 period for Spain and ensures a high resolution of results. The Precipitation Concentration Index (PCI) is a powerful indicator of the temporal distribution of precipitation, traditionally applied at annual scales; as the value increases, the more concentrated the precipitation. Furthermore PCI {{is a part of the}} well-known <b>Fournier</b> <b>index,</b> with a long tradition on natural system analyses, as for example soil erosion. In this paper, the mean values of annual, seasonal and wet and dry periods of PCI in the conterminous Spain and for two normal periods (1946 – 1975 and 1976 – 2005) were studied. Precipitation in Spain follows a general NW-SE spatial pattern during the wet (months) period due to the Atlantic storm track, while during the dry (months) period, it follows a predominantly N-S spatial pattern. As a result, the annual values of PCI combine the two patterns and show a SW-NE PCI gradient. The analyses of the two sub-periods show significant changes in the precipitation occurred in conterminous Spain from 1946 to 2005, and precipitation concentration increased across most of the IP. At an annual scale, PCI increases mostly due to an increase in precipitation concentration during the wet season. At a seasonal scale significant changes were detected between 1945 – 1975 and 1976 – 2005, particularly in autumn (increase of PCI values), while changes in winter, spring and summer were mostly localized and not generalized (both increase and decrease). Changes in PCI seem to be complex and appear to be related to global atmospheric features and synoptic and local factors affecting precipitation trends. We discuss the possible explanation linked to the atmospheric pattern and monthly trends and their implications...|$|E
40|$|Perennial floodinghas {{become a}} major feature in urban areas in {{developing}} economies generating research interest towards finding alternative approaches to stormwater management which could complement the existing systems and help address the challenge of flooding. One of such alternative approaches is nature-based stormwater management and flood control, the implementation {{of which could be}} affected by soil erosion. This paper, as part of a wider research, was developed {{to determine the extent of}} the threat of soil erosion to stormwater management in an urban area on the example of Greater Accra Metropolitan Area, Accra Ghana as the focus of the research. Landsat 8 images (2014) were used in the research to prepare the Landcover maps. Daily rainfall data from 6 raingauge stations from 1972 to 2014 were utilized to prepare the rainfall erosivity factor maps, whereas DEM was used to prepare the slope and slope length (SL) factor maps. The land cover map with an overall accuracy of 73. 6 and Kappa 0. 7122 was combined with literature sources to prepare the vegetative cover factor map, and conservation practice factor map. A soil series map, prepared and updated with literature sources and data from the Harmonized World Soil Database on physical parameters, was used to calculate the soil erodibility factor (K factor) for each soil series. These were integrated into RUSLE model as 30 m raster maps to generate a soil loss map at tons/ha/yr. The results produced rainfall erosivity index values based on the modified <b>Fournier</b> <b>index</b> ranging between 0. 058 and 23. 197 which is classified as low. Low soil erodibility factor (K) ranging between 2. 9 × 10 – 5 and 8. 5 × 10 – 2 (t ha/MJ mm) indicated low susceptibility to erosion, SL factor value showing areas of low to almost flatrelief with a few isolated areas of moderate slope length were generated. A soil loss of 69, 5918 tons/ha/yr classified the soils as having high potential soil loss. The results showed a very low soil loss threat of 0 – 5. 1853 tons/Ha/yr for more than 90 % of the study area. Targeted intervention for source areas with high potential soil loss will contain any threat of erosion and sediment yield to the implementation of an infiltration-based stormwater management and flood control syste...|$|E
