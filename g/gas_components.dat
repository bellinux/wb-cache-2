500|$|Decompression can be {{accelerated}} {{by the use of}} breathing gases during ascent with lowered inert gas fractions (as a result of increased oxygen fraction). This will result in a greater diffusion gradient for a given ambient pressure, and consequently accelerated decompression for a relatively low risk of bubble formation. Nitrox mixtures and oxygen are the most commonly used gases for this purpose, but oxygen rich trimix blends can also be used after a trimix dive, and oxygen rich heliox blends after a heliox dive, and these may reduce risk of isobaric counterdiffusion complications. Doolette and Mitchell showed that when a switch is made to a gas with a different proportion of inert <b>gas</b> <b>components,</b> it is possible for an inert component previously absent, or present as a lower fraction, to in-gas faster than the other inert components are eliminated (inert gas counterdiffusion), sometimes resulting in raising the total tissue tension of inert gases in a tissue to exceed the ambient pressure sufficiently to cause bubble formation, even if the ambient pressure has not been reduced {{at the time of the}} gas switch. They conclude that [...] "breathing-gas switches should be scheduled deep or shallow to avoid the period of maximum supersaturation resulting from decompression".|$|E

Comparison of the dark matter distribution mapped using lensing with {{the distribution of the}} baryons using optical and X-ray data reveals the interplay of the dark matter with the stellar and <b>gas</b> <b>components.</b> A notable example of such a joint analysis is the so-called Bullet Cluster.

2500|$|Inert <b>gas</b> <b>components</b> of the diver's {{breathing}} gas {{accumulate in}} the tissues during exposure to elevated pressure during a dive, {{and must be}} eliminated during the ascent to avoid formation of symptomatic bubbles in tissues where the concentration is too high to remain in solution. This process is called decompression. [...] Most recreational and professional scuba divers avoid obligatory decompression stops by following a dive profile which only requires a limited rate of ascent for decompression, but will commonly also do an optional short shallow decompression stop known as a safety stop to further reduce risk before surfacing. In some cases, particularly in technical diving, more complex decompression procedures are necessary. Decompression may follow a pre-planned series of ascents interrupted by stops, or may be monitored by a personal decompression computer.|$|E

In order to obtain a selective conductivity value for these saline-containing ions (with the maximum potential for corrosion), all remaining carbon dioxide must {{be removed from the}} sample in order to accurately determine the presence of corrosive ions. There are generally two methods for removing carbon dioxide from the water sample: use of a reboiler to heat the sample and expel the CO2, and use of inert gasses. In the latter method, an inert gas which does not contain CO2 is passed through the sample water, whereby the <b>gas</b> <b>components</b> in the sample water are displaced by the <b>gas</b> <b>components</b> of the inert gas.

In this study, we model and predict the joint dynamics of butanes, propane and naphtha traded in the north European market. Our approach is to use multivariate time series with unobservable components.

The in-sample and out-of-sample results indicated that <b>gas</b> <b>component</b> prices follow stochastic processes with trend and autoregressive effects that continuously change over time while the seasonal patterns seem to be stationary.

DETAILED DESCRIPTION - The {{potentiometric sensor}} for the combined determination of the concentration of a first and a second <b>gas</b> <b>component</b> of a <b>gas</b> sample that is introduced into a measurement gas chamber (1), comprises a sodium ion (Na+) -conducting, solid electrolyte (2), a measuring electrode (3), which has a first material that is gas-sensitive with respect to the first and/or the second <b>gas</b> <b>component</b> and which is brought into or is in gas connection with the measurement gas chamber and which is in planar contact with the solid electrolyte, a reference electrode (4), which has a second material that is gas-sensitive with respect to the first and/or the second <b>gas</b> <b>component</b> and which is brought into or is in gas connection with the measurement gas chamber and which is in planar contact with the solid electrolyte and which is electrically insulated from the measuring electrode, and a referencing electrode (5), which is in planar contact with the solid electrolyte and which is electrically insulated from the measuring electrode and from the reference electrode and which is sealed off in a gas-tight manner from the measurement gas chamber. The sensor is formed for the determination of potential difference such as potential difference between the measuring electrode and the reference electrode, the potential difference between the measuring electrode and the reference electrode and the potential difference between the reference electrode and referencing electrode. The potential difference is electrically connected at both electrodes and/or the sensor is formed so that the first potential difference depends on the partial pressure of the first <b>gas</b> <b>component</b> and the second <b>gas</b> <b>component,</b> the third potential difference depends on the partial pressure of the second <b>gas</b> <b>component</b> and the first <b>gas</b> <b>component,</b> and/or the second potential difference depends on the partial pressure of the first and the second <b>gas</b> <b>component.</b> The measuring electrode, the reference electrode and/or the referencing electrode comprises an electric conductive electrode lead by which the electric potential of the measuring-, reference- and/or referencing electrode is tapped. The electrode lead is formed as metal wire and/or as printed layer and/or has an electrode grid {{in the form of a}} printed, partially permeable layer containing gold or platinum.

The solid electrolyte consists of oxides of sodium and aluminum (Na 2 O. nAl 2 O 3), where n= 5 to 11. The solid electrolyte is formed as printed layer on a substrate containing aluminum oxide and zirconium oxide and is formed as a mold body produced from starting powder by pressing and sintering of starting powder and/or as a cation-beta-aluminum oxide-diffusion layer formed over a solid body reaction with a cation in an aluminum oxide substrate. The first material and/or the third material has a pure or a mixed alkali- and/or earth alkali carbonate such as sodium carbonate with gold and/or platinum. The second material and/or the third material consist of a quantity of silica and sodium silicate with gold and/or platinum and/or a mixture of titanium dioxide and sodium titanium oxide with gold and/or platinum. The second material and/or the third material consist of nickel oxide-containing borate glass. The first material, the second material and/or the third material comprises alkali- and/or alkali-earth nitrates such as sodium nitrate with gold and/or platinum or alkali- and/or alkali-earth sulfate such as sodium sulfate with gold and/or platinum.
