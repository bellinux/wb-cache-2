2500|$|In the mid-1970s, the Australian {{television}} industry {{was at a}} crossroads. Since its inception in 1956, commercial television in Australia had developed a reliance on <b>imported</b> <b>programmes,</b> particularly from the United States, as buying them was cheaper than commissioning Australian productions. Agitation for more Australian-made programming gained impetus from the [...] "TV: Make it Australian" [...] campaign in 1970. This led to a government-imposed quota system in 1973. The advent of colour transmissions in 1975 markedly improved sport as a television spectacle and, importantly, Australian sport counted as local content. However, sports administrators perceived live telecasts to have an adverse effect on attendances. The correlation between sports, corporate sponsorship and television exposure was not evident to Australian sports administrators at the time.|$|R

These included Miami Vice (known as Misdaad in Miami), [...] The Six Million Dollar Man, (Steve Austin: Die Man van Staal) and Beverly Hills, 90210. This also applied to German and Dutch programmes dubbed in Afrikaans, such as the German detective series Derrick, and the Dutch soap opera Medisch Centrum West, known in Afrikaans as Hospitaal Wes Amsterdam.|$|R

SABC TV also produced lavish musical shows featuring the most popular South African composers, solo musicians, bands and orchestras. For example, the pianist and composer, Charles Segal, was given a half-hour special show: The Music of Charles Segal, where a selection of his music was performed by various local artists, such as Zane Adams, SABC Orchestra and others. However, it also broadcast pop music series like Pop Shop, which consisted of overseas and local music, and Double Track, which consisted entirely of local acts.|$|R

An immediate change was that the news department was shut down the same evening and would be replaced by short news updates without hosts the next day. C4 Partners intends to give the channel a new profile and change it from a free-to-air channel into a pay channel. The owner of C4 Partners, Hans Linder, also owned Xover TV that had previously produced Gameplay, a programme about video games, for TV7.

She gave Johnny Morris his first TV appearances as The Hot Chestnut Man (1953-1961). Her policy was in the tradition of Lord Reith, thus her programmes were aimed at education as much as entertainment, and she strongly resisted cartoons and <b>imported</b> <b>programmes.</b> Although the programmes were widely approved of by adults, the launch of ITV in 1955 soon made it clear that many children wanted something different, and the ratings for the BBC's children's programmes plummeted over the following year, when Lingstrom was replaced as Head of BBC Children's Television by Owen Reed.

40|$|The aim of {{this paper}} is to {{determine}} how contract conditions in licensing agreements between Poland and the industrialized market-economy countries influence the long-term effects of imports of modern technology. Analysis is confined to two essential aspects of this problem. The first concerns the effects of the diffusion of modern technical solutions throughout the whole economy. Unlike technology purchases by individual western enterprises, technology imports in a planned economy are considered as a source of modernization of entire branches or industries, and not only of certain enterprises. The second issue dealt with the export-promotion effect. When, after 1970, Poland launched an extensive technology <b>importing</b> <b>programme,</b> it was assumed that this would prove an essential stimulus which would in the long run change Poland's position in the international division of labour; in the short term, export growth would constitute the main source of foreign exchange needed to repay credits drawn for technology imports...|$|R

40|$|Higher {{education}} is not value free. Notions of what is optimal or ideal are locally contextualised by such factors as the predominant religion, political system, language, the local employment market {{and the quality of}} local secondary schooling. As such, the external quality assurance of higher education must also be contextualised {{if it is to be}} effective. In the case of Dubai, the task of designing a contextualised quality assurance system is quite particular. Like many developing higher education sectors, Dubai is heavily reliant upon imported higher education; but unlike most of its peer states, Dubai, through targeted Free Zones, is specifically seeking to maintain the international nature of the <b>imported</b> <b>programmes</b> rather than customise them through the application of localised accreditation standards. It has developed a method of institutional and programme validation that requires initial selection of institutions based upon credible approvals from the place of origin, complemented with evidence of effective transnational quality assurance processes. Alongside the federal accreditation process and institutions established by Royal Decree, this has resulted in a pluralistic framework that enables a variety of models of quality higher education to be available within the United Arab Emirates...|$|R
