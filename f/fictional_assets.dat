40|$|The Victorian premier’s {{performance}} on {{education is not}} bad. It’s just not top class, either, according to David Hayward I KNOW Steve Bracks well enough to realise that he’s got to be severely provoked before he loses his cool. His terse rejoinder to the Age’sKenneth Davidson (‘How my government has rebuilt state education’, 19 September) {{tells me that he}} has been wronged. But what if Davidson is not to blame? Davidson argued (‘Bracks has pulled a swifty over education funding’) that education dollars have been falling in real terms in recent times, but the budget papers are so crook these days you would need a degree to work it out. Bracks reckons that Davidson got his numbers wrong ‘again’ because ideology has blinded him to the facts. Labor has invested an ‘additional 3. 7 billion’ in education and there are 4000 extra staff to prove it, not to mention falling student-teacher ratios, and lots of new schools as well as refurbished ones in which our kids are now taught. All this sounds compelling, but maybe things are more complex than the premier would allow? There’s certainly something fishy going on, for Bracks’s numbers don’t add up. At November’s state election, Labor claimed it had put ‘more than 2. 75 billion back into Victoria’s education system’. Yet the budget papers show that education expenses climbed by only 1. 2 billion (budget paper No. 2, page 297) during Labor’s first term, or a little over half that if we adjust for inflation. Bracks now reckons his government is spending 3. 7 billion more. In the one budget since the election, Labor announced new output and investment initiatives worth only 189 million for the next financial year. So where is the missing 800 million? Maybe it’s money that has not been spent yet. The budget these days shows the cost of new initiatives {{over the next four years}} and it’s the total cost the government quotes when it informs us of its generosity. Thus the latest budget injects 2. 4 million into principals’ professional development, but in reality this is an annual 600, 000 that has been multiplied by four. And while some initiatives take full effect immediately, others don’t kick in for some time down the track. Thus, while 82 million is to be spent on 450 new secondary teachers, only 4. 5 million is earmarked for the present financial year, and the big dollars won’t flow till 2005. What all this means is that Bracks’s 3. 7 billion as well as the 2. 75 billion touted at the last election perhaps owe more to double counting than they do to reality. In addition, they include depreciation and a <b>fictional</b> ‘capital <b>asset</b> charge’, in which Treasury gives each department an amount of money equivalent to its annual cost of capital, which is then promptly returned to Treasury in full. To these ‘fictional’ sums must be added superannuation expenses, which have no bearing on day-to-day running costs of schools. For those interested in cash flows over time, or real spending trends by function, the budget papers these days are of no use. These crucial figures have not been published since the 1990 s, when Alan Stockdale decided Victorians should no longer be troubled with this sort of basic information. The only way to solve this problem is to focus on cash spent on salaries and supplies, which are shown in the budget papers, but only for the past two years. This is what Davidson did - and they show that real education spending is declining. But one need not go to these lengths to show that education has not fared all that well. However they are measured, education expenses this year will account for a smaller share of Victoria’s economy than they did in Jeff Kennett 2 ̆ 7 s last year, and all the other states will spend more of their income on education than we will, except probably NSW. While Bracks is right to say that ‘Victoria 2 ̆ 7 s proportion of recurrent expenditure devoted to employing teachers is significantly above the national average’, that’s not something that Labor should necessarily treat with pride. It means we underspend on curriculum development and renewal, to the long-term detriment of our education system. This is about to worsen, for 300 poor souls in head office are about to be made redundant courtesy of budget cuts announced last May, taking staff numbers there back to levels not seen since 1999. What about teacher numbers? While 3000 more teachers have been employed, there are still almost 3000 fewer than there were when Kennett started sacking them way back in 1993. This is not to say that Labor’s education record is bad. It’s just not a top-class effort, which is what Bracks would seem to believe. But premiers are busy people and they depend on others for advice. Our normally good-natured premier might do well to have a word with those whose rubbery numbers got him fired up enough to have an unnecessary scrap with the bearer of some uncomfortable news. David Hayward, director of the Institute for Social Research at Swinburne University, is the author of a Community and Public Sector Union report on education funding.
