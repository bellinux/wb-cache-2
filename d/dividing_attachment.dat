25|$|All colon surgery {{involves}} {{only three}} maneuvers that may vary in complexity {{depending on the}} region of the bowel {{and the nature of the}} disease. The maneuvers are the retraction of the colon, the division of the attachments to the colon and the dissection of the mesentery. After the resection of the colon, the surgeon normally <b>divides</b> the <b>attachments</b> to the liver and the small intestine. After the mesenteric vessels are dissected, the colon is divided with special surgical staplers that close off the bowel while cutting between the staple lines.|$|R

Teoretisk anvendes Doreen Masseys begreb om stedsidentitet og stedstilknytning samt Thomas Højrups tre livsformer for at klarlægge Carsten og Laurits’ levevilkår og stedstilknytning. Her afspejles projektets tværfaglighed, gennem teorier af både er sociologisk og geografisk (PRR) karakter. I projektets analyse undersøges de to fiskeres tilhørsforhold til den rurale eller den urbane livsform samt deres stedstilknytning til deres respektive byer. Resultatet af analysen var at de to fiskere havde levevilkår som lå både i den rurale og den urbane livsform samt en splittet stedstilknytning. Disse tre faktorer blev taget op i diskussionen for at kunne besvare projektets problemformulering.   Carsten og Laurits – one profession, {{two lives}} This project will explore how life plays into {{attachment}} of place home in Nexø and Gilleleje. Theoretically Doreen Massey's concepts of identity {{of place and}} attachment of place were used, as well as Thomas Højrup’s three life forms to clarify Carsten and Laurits' living conditions and attachment of place. This reflects the project's interdisciplinary approach, through the theories of both sociological and geographical (PRR) character. The project's analysis examined the two fishermen’s belonging to the rural or the urban lifestyle and their attachment to their individual cities. It found that the two fishermen’s way of life were in both the rural and the urban lifestyle and a <b>divided</b> <b>attachment</b> of place. These three factors were addressed in the discussion to answer the project's research question...|$|R
40|$|Entry ratio {{tables are}} often a {{convenient}} mechanism for capturing information that is subject only to scale transforms. For example, the National Council on Compensation Insurance, Inc. (NCCI) stores excess loss factors (ELFs) in entry ratio tables. To determine an ELF at an attachment point, you simply <b>divide</b> the <b>attachment</b> point by the mean loss, and use that "entry ratio " value to look up the ELF in the table. A key assumption is that the underlying size of loss distribution changes only by a uniform scale transform over time (or by a transform that is close enough to a scale transform; c. f. Venter [3] {{for a discussion of}} scale adjustments and excess losses). In fact, there can be forces at work that change the shape of size of loss distributions in ways that are not captured by scale transforms. For example, large claims might have greater trend factors than small claims (differential severity trend). Also, the frequency of small claims might decrease more than the frequency of large claims over some period of time (differential frequency trend). Not surprisingly, both of these possible effects act to "stiffen " the siz...|$|R
40|$|AbstractThe early {{steps in}} {{hepatitis}} B virus (HBV) infection, a human hepadnavirus, initiates from cell attachment followed by entry {{and delivery of}} the genetic information to the nucleus. Despite {{the fact that these}} steps determine the virus-related pathogenesis, their molecular basis is poorly understood. Cumulative data suggest that this process can be <b>divided</b> to cell <b>attachment,</b> endocytosis, membrane fusion and post-fusion consecutive steps. These steps are likely to be regulated by the viral envelope proteins and by the cellular membrane, receptors and extracellular matrix. In the absence of animal model for HBV, the duck hepadnavirus DHBV {{turned out to be a}} fruitful animal model. Therefore data concerning the early, post-attachment steps in hepadnaviral entry are largely based on studies performed with DHBV in primary duck liver hepatocytes. These studies are now starting to illuminate the mechanisms of hepadnavirus route of cell entry and to provide some new insights on the molecular basis of the strict species specificity of hepadnavirus infection...|$|R
30|$|While {{awaiting}} repair, {{the infant}} {{continued to have}} fluctuating respiratory status and on two occasions had a cause identified: a respiratory infection with enterorhinovirus and an Enterobacter cloacae urinary tract infection. At 4.5  months of age, flexible bronchoscopy, esophagoscopy, resection and ligation of the proximal tracheoesophageal fistula, and tracheopexy were performed. During bronchoscopy, severe tracheomalacia was identified with direct visualization of the tracheal lumen demonstrating approximately 90 % collapse during spontaneous respirations. The small, high proximal fistula was visualized and a small flexible guide wire was gently introduced across the fistula to aid location of the defect during surgical repair. A cervical approach to the high proximal tracheoesophageal fistula was undertaken through a collar incision. The sternocleidomastoid muscle was retracted laterally, <b>dividing</b> the sternal <b>attachments.</b> The thyroid was mobilized medially and the tracheoesophageal groove was defined while ensuring that the recurrent laryngeal nerve was identified and preserved. The fistula was isolated. It was then divided and oversewn on both the tracheal and esophageal sides with absorbable suture. An intervening flap of strap muscle was placed between suture lines to prevent refistulization. Careful dissection was then performed on the undersurface of the manubrium {{to the level of}} the innominate vein. Using a series of interrupted absorbable polydioxanone sutures, the anterior surface of the trachea was secured to the posterior aspect of the manubrium. In this manner, a modified, sub-manubrial tracheopexy was accomplished.|$|R
40|$|The {{papillomavirus}} E 2 protein {{functions in}} viral transcriptional regulation, DNA replication, and episomal genome maintenance. Viral genomes are maintained in <b>dividing</b> cells by <b>attachment</b> to mitotic chromosomes {{by means of}} the E 2 protein. To investigate the chromosomal tethering function of E 2, plasmid stability assays were developed in Saccharomyces cerevisiae to determine whether the E 2 protein could maintain plasmids containing the yeast autonomous replication sequence replication element but with the centromeric element replaced by E 2 -binding sites. E 2 expression was not sufficient to maintain such plasmids, but plasmid stability could be rescued by expression of the mammalian protein Brd 4. In the presence of both Brd 4 and E 2 proteins, plasmids with multiple E 2 -binding sites were stable without selection. S. cerevisiae encodes a homolog of Brd 4 named Bdf 1 that does not contain the C-terminal domain that interacts with the E 2 protein. A fusion protein of Bdf 1 and the Brd 4 C-terminal “tail” could support E 2 -mediated plasmid maintenance in yeast. Using a panel of mutated E 2 proteins, we determined that plasmid stability required the ability of E 2 to bind DNA and to interact with Brd 4 and mammalian mitotic chromosomes but did not require its replication initiation and transactivation functions. The S. cerevisiae-based plasmid maintenance assays described here are invaluable tools for dissecting mechanisms of episomal viral genome replication and screening for additional host protein factors involved in plasmid maintenance...|$|R
40|$|Este artigo tem como propósito a contextualização do romance A Pianista, de Elfriede Jelinek, no âmbito de uma tradição literária austríaca caracterizada pela visão crítica da sociedade e de seus conflitos, da qual fizeram parte grandes expoentes das letras deste país no período entre-guerras. Se no pós-guerra o {{establishment}} literário austríaco empenhou-se pelo estabelecimento de um consenso social por meio da difusão de uma ideologia harmonística, que visava reinstaurar elementos da sociedade habsburga na 2 ª. República, o ressurgimento de uma literatura de rebeldia e estranhamento na Áustria da década de 1980 pode ser compreendido como uma reação a este projeto de restauração de um ideário anacrônico. Neste sentido, a confrontação, em A Pianista, entre Erika Kohut, sua mãe e Walter Klemmer pode ser uma representação metafórica de conflitos próprios de uma sociedade dividida entre o apego às glórias de uma tradição cultural que se deseja preservar e o assédio permanente de uma mass-media globalizada e estruturada sobre parâmetros que estão em oposição diametral a esta tradição. Ao mesmo tempo, busca-se contextualizar as visões de mundo e formas de comportamento representadas no romance no âmbito da chamada Österreich Ideologie, onde surgem como princípios de convívio social herdados da ideologia habsburga, e que permanecem como substratos parcialmente anacrônicos e parcialmente ilusórios na cultura austríaca dos anos 1980. The {{purpose of}} this article is the contextualization of Elfriede Jelinek's Die Klaverspielerin within the tradition of social criticism in Austrian literature, to which several authors from the interbellum period belong. After 1945, Austria's literary establishment strove to create social peace by means of the diffusion of a harmonistic ideology. The aim of this ideology was to reestablish a system of values inherited from the Monarchy in te 2 nd. Republic and the emergence of a literature of protest and estrangement in Austria in the 1980 's can be seen as a reaction against this project of restoration of an anachronistic ideology. The central conflict structuring Jelinek's narrative - a conflict between Erika Kohut, her mother and Walter Klemmer - is here seen as a kind of metaphorical representation of conflicts characteristic of a society <b>divided</b> between its <b>attachment</b> to the glories of a vanished cultural tradition and the unremitting assault of global mass media, structured over parameters that are diametrically opposed to this tradition. At the same time, I attempt to situate specific ways of behavior and Weltanschauungen portrayed in this novel within the cultural atmosphere where they emerge, particularly that of the so-called Österreich Ideologie, pointing to principles of social conviviality that seem to derive from Habsburg ideology and which remain as partly unconscious and illusory undercurrents in Austrian culture in the 1980 's and 1990 's. Der Ziel dieses Artikels ist die Kontextualisierung von Elfriede Jelineks Roman Die Klavierspielerin innerhalb einer kritischen Tradition der österreichischen Literatur des 20. Jahrhunderts, zu welcher fast alle bedeutenden Autoren dieses Landes in den 20 er. und 30 er. Jahren irgendwie gehören. Nach 1945 gelang es dem österreichischen literarischen Establishment eine harmonistishce Ideologie durchzusetzen, die alle gesellschaftliche Gegensätze durch eine eskapistische Tendenz und eine Rückkehr zu Elemente der habsburgische Ideologie ersetzten. Die Protest-Literatur der 1980 er. kann als Reaktion gegen diese sogenannte Österreich Ideologie verstanden werden. Die Klavierspielerin scheint auf einem Konflikt strukturiert zu sein und dieser Konflikt zeichnet sich als Opposition zwischen einer festen Beziehung zur österreichischen Vergangenheit, ins besondere zur vergangenen Musiktradition einerseits, und dem ständigen Einfluss der globalisierten Mass-media andererseits. Erika Kohut, ihre Mutter und Walter Klemmer, die Protagonisten des Romans, können daher als Sinnbilder verschiedener Weltanschauungen gedeutet werden, die zwischen den Trümmern der Ideologie der verschollenen Doppelmonarchie und der Integration in der globalisierten Welt schwanken. Dadurch können sie auch als bedeutende Symbole der österreichischen Gesellschaft unserer Zeit verstanden werde...|$|R
