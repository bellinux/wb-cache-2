In this paper, we present a reachability-based optimization which can be used in any one of the construction algorithms to reduce the <b>intermediate</b> <b>memory</b> requirements. The optimization is pre-sented in conjunction with an easily understood (and implemented) canonical automaton construction algorithm.

40|$|The {{effects of}} {{levodopa}} on tests measuring auditory and visual perception, auditory, and visual short-term memory, verbal learning, and on {{attention and concentration}} were studied in 29 patients with Parkinsonism. Thirty-two control subjects matched with the Parkinsonism patients on age, educational level, and verbal IQ were administered the same tests to control for practice effects. Significant improvement occurred for the Parkinsonism patients in verbal learning (an <b>intermediate</b> <b>memory</b> test) and in auditory perception. These improvements were unrelated to changes in anticholinergic medications, increases in alertness or concentration, lessening of depression, or improved motor ability or control. There was no test evidence of levodopa improving visual perception, short-term auditory or visual memory, alertness or concentration. Thus, there is no objective test evidence for levodopa producing a generalized awakening or an alerting effect in Parkinsonism patients who are intellectually alert and well-orientated. Interpretation of the test findings suggests a specific awakening effect, that of improvement in <b>intermediate</b> <b>memory</b> but not in short-term memory.

40|$|There is an ever {{widening}} {{performance gap}} between processors and main memory, a gap bridged by small <b>intermediate</b> <b>memories,</b> cache memories, storing recently referenced data. A miss in the cache {{is an expensive}} operation because it requires data to be fetched from main memory. It is therefore crucial to understand application cache behavior. Caches only work well for applications with good data locality; insufficient data locality leads to poor cache utilization which quickly becomes a major performance bottleneck. Analysing and understanding the cache behavior helps in improving data locality and identifying such bottlenecks. In this thesis, we study a method for efficiently analysing application cache behavior. We implement the method in a cache analysis tool. The method uses a statistical cache model that only requires a sparse data locality fingerprint as input. The input is based on reuse distances between cache lines. By adjusting architecture-specific parameters, such as cache line size, the tool can output working-set graphs {{for a wide range}} of architectures. Readily available hardware performance counters combined with intelligent sampling are used to enable an implementation with low overhead. We evaluate our cache analysis tool using the SPEC CPU 2006 benchmarks and our results show good accuracy and performance. The difference between the cache miss ratio estimated by our tool and a reference tool was nearly always below one percentage point. The run-time overhead was on average 17 %. We also do an analysis of the overhead to identify the components of our implementation that are most costly and should be the focus for optimizations. We propose a number of optimizations that could reduce the overhead further. Phase-guided sampling is proposed as a key optimization where application phase behavior is used to determine when to sample memory references. We also build a prototype implementation of this optimization and the preliminary results were promising...|$|R

We hypothesized that anti-retroviral suppression of T cell activation levels would lead to alterations in the T cell differentiation of total and HIV- 1 specific CD 8 + T cell responses among recently HIV- 1 infected adults. Methodology/Principal Findings: We performed a longitudinal study simultaneously measuring T cell activation and maturation markers on both total and antigen-specific T cells in recently infected adults: prior to treatment; after the initiation of HAART; and after treatment was halted. Prior to treatment, HIV- 1 Gag–specific CD 8 + T cells were predominantly of a highly activated, <b>intermediate</b> <b>memory</b> (CD 27 +CD 282) phenotype, while CMV pp 65 -specific CD 8 + T cells showed a late memory (CD 272 CD 282), low activation phenotype.

In addition, this ability seems to share unique variance with reasoning. In this study, we therefore examined whether process-based training of the ability to learn and remember associations has the potential to induce transfer effects to untrained episodic memory and reasoning tasks in healthy older adults (60 - 75 years). For this purpose, the experimental group (n = 36) completed 30 sessions of process-based object-location memory training, while the active control group (n = 31) practiced visual perception on the same material.
