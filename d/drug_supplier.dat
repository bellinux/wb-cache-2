2500|$|The Commonwealth of Virginia {{justified}} its {{enactment of}} the regulation {{on the grounds of}} maintaining the professionalism of pharmacists, asserting that aggressive price competition among pharmacists would make it difficult for pharmacists to provide the proper professional services. [...] Blackmun responded that while regulation of the pharmacy profession was both necessary and within the prerogative of the several States through their police power, the statute promoted consumers’ ignorance, effectively keeping them in the dark about prescription drug prices. [...] Blackmun dismissed this rationale as paternalistic, saying that if consumers had sufficient access to information regarding drug pricing and availability, it would only serve to aid them in their decisions about choosing a prescription <b>drug</b> <b>supplier.</b>|$|E

40|$|This paper {{studies the}} effects of generic drug’s entry on bidding {{behavior}} of <b>drug</b> <b>suppliers</b> in procurement auctions for pharmaceuticals, and the consequences on procurer’s price paid for drugs. Using an unique data set on procurement auctions for off-patent drugs organized by Brazilian public bodies, we surprisingly find no statistically difference between bids and prices paid for generic and branded drugs. On the other hand, some branded <b>drug</b> <b>suppliers</b> leave auctions in which there exists a supplier of generics, whereas the remaining ones lower their bidding price. These findings explain why {{we find that the}} presence of any <b>supplier</b> of generic <b>drugs</b> in a procurement auction reduces the price paid for pharmaceuticals by 7 percent. To overcome potential estimation bias due to generic’s entry endogeneity, we exploit variation in the number of days between drug’s patent expiration date and the tendering session. The two-stage estimations document the same pattern as the generalized least square estimations find. This evidence indicates that generic competition affects branded supplier’s behavior in public procurement auctions differently from other markets...|$|R
