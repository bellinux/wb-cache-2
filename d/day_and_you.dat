[...] "Let me say this: I don't believe that I ought to quit because I'm not a quitter. And, incidentally, Pat's not a quitter. After all, her name was Patricia Ryan and she was born on St. Patrick's <b>Day,</b> <b>and</b> <b>you</b> know the Irish never quit." ...|$|E

The fourth thing in this series, whether a person or a utensil, is then rendered impure with an impurity lasting until the evening — a first-grade impurity ( [...] , rishon l'tumah).|$|E

What could have been the design of the Almighty in this wonderful occurrence is not for me to say; but I can say that the curse is not yet taken off the sons of Canaan, neither will be until it is affected by as great power as caused it to come; and the people who interfere the least with the decrees and purposes of God in this matter, will come under the least condemnation before him; and those who are determined to pursue a course which shows an opposition and a feverish restlessness against the designs of the Lord, will learn, when perhaps it is too late for their own good, that God can do his own work without the aid of those who are not dictate by his counsel."

2500|$|Brando {{acknowledged}} {{his professional}} decline, writing later, [...] "Some {{of the films}} I made during the sixties were successful; some weren't. Some, like The Night of the Following Day, I made only for the money; others, like Candy, I did because a friend asked me to and I didn't want to turn him down... In some ways I think of my middle age as the Fuck You Years." [...] Candy was especially appalling for many; a 1968 sex farce film directed by Christian Marquand {{and based on the}} 1958 novel by Terry Southern, the movie satirizes pornographic stories through the adventures of its naive heroine, Candy, played by Ewa Aulin. It is generally regarded as the nadir of Brando's career. The Washington Post observed: [...] "Brando's self-indulgence over a dozen years is costing him and his public his talents." [...] In the March 1966 issue of The Atlantic, Pauline Kael wrote that in his rebellious days, Brando [...] "was antisocial because he knew society was crap; he was a hero to youth because he was strong enough not to take the crap", but now Brando and others like him had become [...] "buffoons, shamelessly, pathetically mocking their public reputations." [...] In an earlier review of The Appaloosa in 1966, Kael wrote that the actor was [...] "trapped in another dog of a movie... Not for the first time, Mr. Brando gives us a heavy-lidded, adenoidally openmouthed caricature of the inarticulate, stalwart loner." [...] Although he feigned indifference, Brando was hurt by the critical mauling, admitting in the 2015 film Listen to Me Marlon, [...] "They can hit you every <b>day</b> <b>and</b> <b>you</b> have no way of fighting back. I was very convincing in my pose of indifference, but I was very sensitive and it hurt a lot." ...|$|E
