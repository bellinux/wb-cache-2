Escape from Tomorrow {{is not the}} first film made in whole, or part, this way at the Disney parks. In 2010, the British street artist Banksy shot a scene for Exit Through the Gift Shop in one of the parks with his collaborator Mr. Brainwash. They managed to smuggle the footage out after being detained and questioned by park security. The following year, a viral <b>found</b> <b>footage</b> short, Missing in the Mansion, filmed in the Haunted Mansion, was distributed online without interference from Disney.|$|E

A rescue mission, led by the New York University anthropologist Harold Monroe, recovers the film crew's lost cans of film, which an American television station wishes to broadcast. Upon viewing the reels, Monroe is appalled by the team's actions, and after learning their fate, he objects to the station's intent to air the documentary. The presentation of the crew's lost footage, functioning similarly to a flashback, revolutionized the <b>found</b> <b>footage</b> style of narrative filmmaking, later popularized by such films as The Blair Witch Project.|$|E

5|$|The title Project X was {{initially}} a placeholder {{for a final}} title, but interest generated by the secretive title kept it in place. A nationwide open casting call was employed to find fresh faces. The majority of the cast were sourced from this casting call, but a few with prior acting credits, such as Mann, were accepted after multiple auditions.

Most scenes were captured by four cameras simultaneously: these included a handheld camera operated by Gyllenhaal, cameras clipped to Gyllenhaal and Peña's vests, and dashboard footage from their patrol car. Some scenes were shot entirely by Gyllenhaal. An alternate ending of the film was shot where both of the main characters died, but Ayer ultimately chose to retain the original ending.|$|E

Greb repeats this trick, and encourages Figgleif to go on a killing spree—Figgleif takes a gun, bursts onto the taping of a science-fiction show about alien abduction, and kills several actors. Greb's methods and effectiveness are dismissed until he reveals the story's epigram. Figgleif's spree was caught on camera, and broadcast by another network as a <b>found</b> <b>footage</b> special.

25|$|The film is {{partially}} {{presented in a}} <b>found</b> <b>footage</b> format by featuring fictional interviews, news footage, and video from surveillance cameras. The story, which explores themes of humanity, xenophobia, and social segregation, begins in an alternate 1982, when an alien ship appears over Johannesburg, South Africa. When a population of sick and malnourished insect-like aliens is found aboard the ship, the South African government confines them to an internment camp called District 9. Years later, during the government's relocation of the aliens to another camp, one of the confined aliens named Christopher Johnson tries to escape with his son and return home, crossing paths with a bureaucrat named Wikus van der Merwe.

500|$|An {{aspect of}} the film criticized in {{numerous}} reviews was its handheld camerawork and cinematography. Richard Corliss wrote for Time that the <b>found</b> <b>footage</b> style of cinematography [...] "borders on the ludicrous" [...] and that [...] "the tactic fatally substitutes photo realism for fauxto realism". Similarly, The Washington Post Michael O'Sullivan found the aesthetic gimmicky, overused, and [...] "an unnecessary distraction from the story". On the other hand, Amy Biancolli of the San Francisco Chronicle felt that although the cinematography was inconsistent, [...] "it's used to deepen its main characters" [...] and [...] "lends the film a lively intimacy".|$|E

500|$|In 2012, The Devil Inside, a low-budget <b>found</b> <b>footage</b> horror film {{following}} in the steps of Cloverfield, opened the weekend after New Year's Day. Critics, for whom {{it had not been}} screened, reviewed it harshly if and when they did see it, and audiences reacted angrily to the film's abrupt ending, which directed them to a website for more information. Yet, as Cargill notes, its success was proof that even on that low-potential weekend, a disengaged audience will [...] "throw money at a terrible movie if it looks like it's good." [...] The film's opening weekend take of $33.7 million ranks in the top ten for January. The Devil Inside went on to make over $50 million domestically and almost that much abroad to break $100 million in total receipts.|$|E
