Singing lowers blood pressure by releasing pent up emotions, boosting relaxation and reminding them of happy times. It also allows singers to breathe more easily. Patients with lung disease and chronic pulmonary disease experience relief from their symptoms from singing just two times a week. In addition to breathing related illness, singing also has numerous benefits for stroke victims when it comes to relearning the ability to speak and communicate by singing their thoughts. Singing activates {{the right side of the}} brain when the left side cannot function (the left side is the area of the brain responsible for speech), so it is <b>easy</b> <b>to</b> <b>see</b> <b>how</b> singing can be an excellent alternative to speech while the victim heals.|$|E

But it's also <b>easy</b> <b>to</b> <b>see</b> <b>how</b> he acquired his awkward reputation when you hear his Violin Concerto, dating from 1940. It's an immensely attractive work, full of his trademark Armenian folk flourishes, and the swaying, hypnotic Andante is notably beautiful. But the unforced optimism of the outer movements now seems unthinking when we realise it was composed at a time when Stalin was giving Prokofiev and Shostakovich hell." [...] In 2003 conductor Marin Alsop opined that Khachaturian is [...] "very underperformed" [...] and [...] "somewhat underrated". She commented further: [...] "His music, of course, has {{a little bit of the}} edginess of the 20th-century sound, the dissonances coming in. But at the same time it marries this beautiful neo-romanticism and lush orchestration and the over-the-top approach, so I think, he can be quite relevant these days." ...|$|E

2500|$|His ever-expanding {{interests}} led {{him into}} plant population genetics, a field that he essentially founded. [...] His particular interest was in the population genetics of Inbreeding species, and included wild plants such as Collinsia, Avena barbata and Avena fatua. [...] His interest in inbreeding species probably stemmed from his interactions with Ledyard Stebbins, who was also at U.C. Davis, and had predicted that wild inbreeding plant populations should be devoid of genetic variation. As a plant breeder who had done selection on inbreeding species in cultivated plants, Allard {{knew that there was}} ample genetic variation within [...] "pure lines." [...] It is <b>easy</b> <b>to</b> <b>see</b> <b>how</b> he would have become intriqued with inbreeding wild species. And indeed starting in the early 1960s he worked with experimental populations of wheat, barley, and lima beans as well as the wild plants Collinsia, Avena barbata, and Avena fatua investigating a wide variety of issues important to the population genetics of inbreeding species. [...] He published numerous foundational papers on the effects of mating systems, selection, gene-environment interactions, linkage disequilibrium, and genetic drift on the genetic variation of inbreeding plant populations.|$|E
2500|$|Frege's first work, the Begriffsschrift ("concept script") is a rigorously axiomatised {{system of}} propositional logic, relying on just two connectives (negational and conditional), two rules of {{inference}} (modus ponens and substitution), and six axioms. [...] Frege {{referred to the}} [...] "completeness" [...] of this system, {{but was unable to}} prove this. [...] The most significant innovation, however, was his explanation of the quantifier in terms of mathematical functions. [...] Traditional logic regards the sentence [...] "Caesar is a man" [...] as of fundamentally the same form as [...] "all men are mortal." [...] Sentences with a proper name subject were regarded as universal in character, interpretable as [...] "every Caesar is a man".

2500|$|Rock {{music was}} not viewed favorably by most {{traditional}} and fundamentalist Christians {{when it became}} popular with young people from the 1950s, although early rock music was often influenced by country and gospel music. In 1952 Archibald Davison, a Harvard professor, summed up the sound of traditional Christian music and why its supporters may not like Rock music when he said: [...] "... a rhythm that avoids strong pulses; a melody whose physiognomy is neither so characteristic nor so engaging as to make an appeal in its own behalf; counterpoint, which cultivates long-breathed eloquence rather than instant and dramatic effect; a chromaticism which is at all times restricted in amount and lacking in emotionalism; and modality which creates an atmosphere unmistakably ecclesiastical." [...] Based upon Archibald Davison's statement it is <b>easy</b> <b>to</b> <b>see</b> <b>how</b> different these two genres of music are. [...] Religious people in many regions of the United States did not want their children exposed to music with unruly, impassioned vocals, loud guitar riffs and jarring, hypnotic rhythms. Rock and roll differed from the norm, and thus it {{was seen as a}} threat. Often the music was overtly sexual in nature, {{as in the case of}} Elvis Presley, who became controversial and massively popular partly for his suggestive stage antics and dancing. However, Elvis was a religious person who even released a gospel album: Peace in the Valley. Individual Christians may have listened to or even performed rock music in many cases, but it was seen as anathema to conservative church establishments, particularly in the American South.|$|E
