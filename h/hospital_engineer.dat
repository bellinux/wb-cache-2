40|$|The core {{activity}} of the medical physics expert (MPE) is to ensure optimal use of ionising radiation in healthcare. It is essential that these healthcare professionals are trained to the highest level, defined as European Qualifications Framework for Lifelong Learning (EQF) level 8 by the European Commission's Radiation Protection Report 174 'Guidelines on the MPE'. The main objective of the EUTEMPE-RX project {{is to provide a}} model training scheme that allows the medical physicist in diagnostic and interventional radiology (D&IR) to reach this high level. A European network of partners was brought together in this FP 7 EC project to ensure sufficient expertise in all aspects of the subject and to create a harmonised course programme. Targeted participants are medical physicists in D&IR in <b>hospitals,</b> <b>engineers</b> and scientists in medical device industries and officers working in regulatory authorities. Twelve course modules will be developed at EQF level 8, with radiation safety and diagnostic effectiveness being prevalent subjects.

This unique cooperation led to the first product of the soon to be established Biomedical Engineering Department of The Technion - Israel Institute of Technology. It was an electronic device capable of recording arterial pulsations and the mechanical events of the heart without actually making contact with the chest wall. This device was first described in the American Journal of Cardiology, February 19, 1967, Vol. 19, pp. 224-230 and in subsequent publications (list below).|$|R

The current turbine produces 300 kW (0.3MW) of power. It replaced a much smaller turbine that could only produce 60 kW (0.06MW). The new power station was inaugurated at Kisiizi Hospital's Golden Jubilee weekend 14-16 November 2008 when there was a time of celebration and thanksgiving for the work and ministry of the Hospital in its first 50 years. The surplus power generated by the new station is shared with the other institutions within the hospital complex and the rest is sold to the neighboring community to generate operational funds for the station.|$|R
40|$|ObjectiveThis report chronicles an {{outbreak}} of a multiply resistant strain of Pseudomonas aeruginosa and the measures required to contain this outbreak. MethodsLaboratory-based ward-liaison surveillance allowed the detection of a multiply resistant strain of P. aeruginosa infecting patients in our hematology/oncology unit. Sampling of the immediate environment was carried out. Pulsed field gel electrophoresis {{was used to compare}} the patients' organisms with those found in the environment. Extensive dismantling of the drainage system, repeated cleaning and disinfection, and a review of the departmental antibiotic policy were some of the infection control measures instigated. ResultsDuring a period of 11 months, three patients in the hematology department and two patients in the oncology department were infected with multiply resistant P. aeruginosa. There were two cases of pneumonia, one of which was fatal, and two cases of neutropenic septicaemia. Pulsed field gel electrophoresis performed on the isolates showed that the isolates from geographically separate areas could be divided into two strains that were closely related but distinct. Two genotypically identical strains were also isolated from the plumbing systems in the areas of each ward where patients had been treated. ConclusionThe potential for serious nosocomial infections with P. aeruginosa is well recognized. Eradication of the organism from the environment may require the co-ordinated efforts of clinicians, nurses, pharmacy and <b>hospital</b> <b>engineers,</b> working in collaboration with the hospital infection control team. To date, the same strains have not been isolated despite repeated surveillance over the past 18 months and therefore these measures have, in our opinion, successfully removed the potential for nosocomial infection with this resistant organism in our hospital...|$|R

This study {{has been carried out}} to find possible solution using SIP-based event notification for alerting the technical staff about the Biomedical Device (BMD) status and Patients treatment session. The Session Initiation Protocol (SIP) can be used to create a medical event notification system. SIP can work on a variety of devices. Its adoption as the protocol of choice for third generation wireless networks allows for a robust and scalable environment. One of the advantages of SIP is that it supports personal mobility through the separation of user addressing and device addressing. The solution for Telemed alert notification system is based on SIP- Specific Event Notification.

40|$|In {{response}} to the 2003 outbreak of {{severe acute respiratory syndrome}} (SARS) the Hong Kong Government promptly constructed 558 new state-of-the-art SARS isolation rooms with more than 1300 beds in 14 hospitals. These were completed by the end of 2003 and some will be available for H 5 N 1 influenza patients, if any human cases occur. We investigated the ventilation of the wards after 18 months of operation and identified the major factors that affect ventilation effectiveness. Negative pressure, airflow path, air change rate and local ventilation effectiveness in selected rooms in 9 major hospitals were measured and their performance assessed against CDC requirements. Testing in 38 rooms found that 97 % met the recommended negative pressure difference of 2. 5 Pa between corridor and anteroom, 89 % of 48 met the same requirement between anteroom and cubicle. No leakage of air to the corridor was found, but 60 % of the toilets/bathrooms were operated under positive pressure. Over 90 % of corridor-anteroom or anteroom-cubicle doors had bi-directional flow when the door was open. Of 35 tested cubicles, 26 % had an air change rate < 12 ACH and their ventilation was non-uniform. Despite using state-of-the-art technologies, 28 % of the rooms tested still failed to meet the 12 ACH ventilation requirement and 60 % had the wrong airflow direction for the toilets/bathrooms, but all satisfied the requirement of no air leakage to the corridor. Regular checks of airflow direction and air change rate are highly recommended together with specific education or training of <b>hospital</b> maintenance <b>engineers</b> and health care workers. © SAGE Publications 2007. link_to_subscribed_fulltex...|$|R
