5|$|Ida is {{classified}} as an S-type asteroid based on ground-based spectroscopic measurements. The composition of S-types was uncertain before the Galileo flybys, but was interpreted to be either of two minerals found in meteorites that had fallen to the Earth: ordinary chondrite (OC) and stony-iron. Estimates of Ida's density are constrained to less than 3.2g/cm3 by the long-term stability of Dactyl's orbit. This all but rules out a stony-iron composition; were Ida made of 5g/cm3 iron- and nickel-rich material, {{it would have to}} contain more than 40% <b>empty</b> <b>space.</b>|$|E
5|$|The player acts as {{pilot for}} a cargo ship, {{performing}} space runs for various corporations. The ship is a flat platform {{made up of}} hexagonal tiles. The player places weapons and modules on the tiles in order to defend the ship from enemies and hazards. Different structures have varying placement requirements, or may require more than one tile to be placed. For example, most weapons must be placed facing outward into <b>empty</b> <b>space,</b> while some require power to be supplied by an adjacent power source.|$|E
5|$|It {{was thought}} at the time that <b>empty</b> <b>space</b> was filled with a {{background}} medium called the luminiferous aether in which the electromagnetic field existed. Some physicists thought that this aether acted as a preferred frame of reference for the propagation of light and therefore {{it should be possible to}} measure the motion of the Earth with respect to this medium, by measuring the isotropy of the speed of light. Beginning in the 1880s several experiments were performed to try to detect this motion, the most famous of which is the experiment performed by Albert A. Michelson and Edward W. Morley in 1887. The detected motion was always less than the observational error. Modern experiments indicate that the two-way speed of light is isotropic (the same in every direction) to within 6 nanometres per second.|$|E

5|$|The {{proportions}} {{of all types}} of matter and energy have changed over the history of the Universe. Today, ordinary matter, which includes atoms, stars, galaxies, and life, accounts for only 4.9% of the contents of the Universe. The present overall density of this type of matter is very low, roughly 4.5 × 10−31 grams per cubic centimetre, corresponding to a density of the order of only one proton for every four cubic meters of volume. The nature of both dark energy and dark matter is unknown. Dark matter, a mysterious form of matter that has not yet been identified, accounts for 26.8% of the contents. Dark energy, which is the energy of <b>empty</b> <b>space</b> and is causing the expansion of the Universe to accelerate, accounts for the remaining 68.3% of the contents.|$|E
5|$|As a player, Adams {{created the}} concept of the shortstop position, {{according}} to Thorn and Baseball Hall of Fame researcher Freddy Berowski. In the first five years the Knickerbockers played, the team fielded anywhere from eight to eleven players. The only infielders were the players covering each of the bases; if there were more than eight players, extra outfielders were sometimes used. The outfielders had difficulty throwing baseballs into the infield, because of the balls' light weight. Adams' shortstop position, at which he started playing in about 1849 or 1850, was used to field throws from the outfielders and throw to the three infielders. With the advent of higher-quality baseballs, Adams moved toward the infield, since the distance the balls could travel increased. Prior to the invention of the shortstop, large gaps existed in the defensive positioning of infields; defensive players tended to stand by bases, leaving <b>empty</b> <b>space</b> in between them for batters. The shortstop filled one of the two gaps.|$|E
5|$|Before the launch, Metroplex sacrifices {{himself by}} {{transferring}} {{all of his}} Energon to the Ark. Optimus then calls for the launch to try and escape through the portal before it closes, but the Decepticons arrive in the Nemesis to stop them. Soundwave leads {{the first wave of}} troops onto the ship through giant cables and destroys the Arks automated defense system. Optimus sends Jetfire into space to disengage the cables. Bruticus launches from the Nemesis and destroys the Arks fuel line before being fatally injured and blasted off the ship into <b>empty</b> <b>space</b> by Jazz and Jetfire. Nearby, Bumblebee takes the fatal hit for Optimus and the two rival leaders engage in a battle to death. Depending on the players choice to play as either Optimus or Megatron, one manages to defeat the other and deal a fatal blow. But before the final blow can be dealt, both Optimus and Megatron are pulled off of the hull of the Ark and into the portal with both ships. The portal finally closes, leaving their home planet in peace and quiet.|$|E

5|$|In May 1843, Etty was one {{of eight}} artists chosen by Prince Albert to paint frescoes {{on the theme of}} Milton's Comus for a new {{pavilion}} being built in the grounds of Buckingham Palace. Etty was unhappy with his selection, as fresco was a medium with which he had no experience, but reluctantly did so, choosing to paint on the theme of Circe and the Sirens Three. The result was a disaster. Etty found himself unable to retouch or alter his existing work, as any freshly applied paint would flake away from the existing paint layer, and the lunette shape of the panel left Etty with a large <b>empty</b> <b>space</b> above the central figures. Etty's fresco was deemed unsalvageable, and although he offered to paint a replacement on the theme of Hesperus he was rejected, and William Dyce was commissioned to paint a replacement fresco. Etty was paid only a token £40 fee.|$|E
5|$|In modern thought, {{the orbits}} of the planets are viewed as the paths of those planets through mostly <b>empty</b> <b>space.</b> Ancient and medieval thinkers, however, {{considered}} the celestial orbs to be thick spheres of rarefied matter nested one within the other, each one in complete contact with the sphere above it and the sphere below. When scholars applied Ptolemy's epicycles, they presumed that each planetary sphere was exactly thick enough to accommodate them. By combining this nested sphere model with astronomical observations, scholars calculated what became generally accepted values at {{the time for the}} distances to the Sun (about 4 million miles), to the other planets, and {{to the edge of the}} universe (about 73 million miles). The nested sphere model's distances to the Sun and planets differ significantly from modern measurements of the distances, and the size of the universe is now known to be inconceivably large and possibly infinite.|$|E
5|$|Initial {{results were}} {{surprising}} as the material excavated {{by the impact}} contained more dust and less ice than had been expected. The only models of cometary structure astronomers could positively rule out were the very porous ones which had comets as loose aggregates of material. In addition, the material was finer than expected; scientists compared it to talcum powder rather than sand. Other materials found while studying the impact included clays, carbonates, sodium, and crystalline silicates which were found by studying the spectroscopy of the impact. Clays and carbonates usually require liquid water to form and sodium is rare in space. Observations also revealed that the comet was about 75% <b>empty</b> <b>space,</b> and one astronomer compared the outer layers of the comet to the same makeup of a snow bank. Astronomers have expressed interest in more missions to different comets {{to determine if they}} share similar compositions or if there are different materials found deeper within comets that were produced {{at the time of the}} Solar System's formation.|$|E

40|$|<b>Empty</b> <b>spaces</b> in {{literature}} and Bible translation Texts and sentences contain <b>empty</b> <b>spaces</b> which have to be filled by readers {{in the construction of}} meaning. The way in which these spaces are filled is not completely arbitrary. Readers fill them {{on the basis of the}} textual context and/or their own field of reference. There are thus limits and constraints of interpretation. The purpose of <b>empty</b> <b>spaces</b> is to involve the reader actively in the process of interpretation and the generation of meaning. Translators should therefore be careful to fill the <b>empty</b> <b>spaces</b> of the original text. Only in cases where it is absolutely unclear how they should be filled can the translator assist the reader in filling them. One such example is Galatians 2 : 4. By filling most of the <b>empty</b> <b>spaces,</b> the translators of the 1983 Afrikaans translation weakened the communication function of the text. Examples are Ephesians 1 : 3 - 14, Romans 5 : 12 - 17 and Galatians 2 : 6. On the other hand, the 1983 translation is much more intelligible and accessible to the everyday reader than its predecessors. The solution for a possible new Afrikaans translation lies somewhere between the 1933 / 1953 and the 1983 translations...|$|R

5|$|Removing the {{original}} tablet {{to the victims}} of the East Ham Sewage Works accident had left an unsightly gap in {{the original}} row of tiles. In 1931, Mary Watts tracked down Fred Passenger, a former employee of DeMorgan who had, after the closure of the business, set up his own ceramics business using DeMorgan designs. Passenger was by this time working for a pottery business in Bushey Heath established by artist Ida Perrin, but Mary Watts persuaded him to produce a single panel in the style of DeMorgan to fit into the <b>empty</b> <b>space.</b> Herbert Maconoghu, a schoolboy who had died in 1882 attempting to rescue two friends from drowning, {{had been one of the}} names originally suggested by Watts, and Passenger produced a tablet to Maconoghu in the style of the original central row, which was installed in April 1931. Maconoghu was actually Herbert Moore McConaghey, the son of Matthew and Martha McConaghey, and he was born in Mynpoorie in Indian where Matthew was working as a settlement officer for the Imperial Civil Service.|$|E
5|$|The {{potential}} for generating solar {{energy from the}} Sahara Desert is huge, the highest found on the globe. Professor David Faiman of Ben-Gurion University has stated that the technology now exists to supply all of the world's electricity needs from 10% of the Sahara Desert. Desertec Industrial Initiative was a consortium seeking $560 billion to invest in North African solar and wind installations over the next forty years to supply electricity to Europe via cable lines running under the Mediterranean Sea. European interest in the Sahara Desert stems from its two aspects: the almost continual daytime sunshine and plenty of unused land. The Sahara receives more sunshine per acre than any part of Europe. The Sahara Desert also has the <b>empty</b> <b>space</b> totalling hundreds of square miles required to house fields of mirrors for solar plants.|$|E
5|$|In 2010, the Kinect was {{released}} by Microsoft as a 3D scanner/webcam hybrid peripheral device which provides full-body detection of Xbox 360 players and hands-free control of the user interfaces of video games and other software on the console. This was later modified by Oliver Kreylos of University of California, Davis {{in a series of}} YouTube videos which showed him combining the Kinect with a PC-based virtual camera. Because the Kinect is capable of detecting a full range of depth (through computer stereo vision and Structured light) within a captured scene, Kreylos demonstrated the capacity of the Kinect and the virtual camera to allow free-viewpoint navigation of the range of depth, although the camera could only allow a video capture of the scene as shown {{to the front of the}} Kinect, resulting in fields of black, <b>empty</b> <b>space</b> where the camera was unable to capture video within the field of depth. Later, Kreylos demonstrated a further elaboration on the modification by combining the video streams of two Kinects in order to further enhance the video capture within the view of the virtual camera. Kreylos' developments using the Kinect were covered among the works of others in the Kinect hacking and homebrew community in a New York Times article.|$|E

5|$|Outer space, or just space, is {{the expanse}} {{that exists between}} {{celestial}} bodies, including Earth. Outer space is not completely empty, but consists of a hard vacuum containing a low density of particles, predominantly a plasma of hydrogen and helium as well as electromagnetic radiation, magnetic fields, neutrinos, dust, and cosmic rays. The baseline temperature, as set by the background radiation from the Big Bang, is 2.7kelvins (K) (−270.45°C; −454.81°F). Plasma with a number density of less than one hydrogen atom per cubic metre and a temperature of millions of kelvins {{in the space between}} galaxies accounts for most of the baryonic (ordinary) matter in outer space; local concentrations have condensed into stars and galaxies. Observations indicate that 90% of the mass in most galaxies is in an unknown form, called dark matter, which interacts with other matter through gravitational but not electromagnetic forces. Other observations indicate {{that the majority of the}} mass-energy in the observable universe is a poorly understood vacuum energy of space which astronomers label dark energy.
