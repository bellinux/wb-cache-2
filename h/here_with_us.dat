Of them all, I may {{be permitted to}} say that while they all differed from each other, they all exhibited features of character and conduct {{that would have given}} them prominence anywhere in the business world. No doubt in some one or two important respects, each one excelled the others. This was shown in those matters and things to which they gave their chief attention. Speaking of them and their families, so well represented <b>here</b> <b>with</b> <b>us</b> and elsewhere, {{it can be said that}} they have always stood for better things, not with assumption or pharisaically, but openly and firmly. They pushed their business enterprises with diligence, and had there been more of such men it would have been better for the city and for them also, I have no doubt.|$|E

In 1999 President Clinton awarded Bentsen the Presidential Medal of Freedom, {{one of the}} nation's highest honors given to civilians. President Clinton singled Bentsen out for applause during his final State of the Union address in 2000, saying: 'In 1993 we began to put our fiscal house in order with the Deficit Reduction Act, which you'll all remember won passages in both Houses by just a single vote. Your former colleague, my first Secretary of the Treasury, led that effort and sparked our long boom. He's <b>here</b> <b>with</b> <b>us</b> tonight. Lloyd Bentsen, you have served America well, and we thank you.' Bentsen appeared {{in the summer of}} 2004 at the portrait unveilings at the White House of former President Bill Clinton and former First Lady Senator Hillary Clinton.|$|E

5000|$|Al-Sebai {{subsequently}} {{claimed that}} MEMRI had mistranslated his interview, and that among other errors, {{he had actually}} said: [...] there is no term in Islamic jurisprudence called civilians.
