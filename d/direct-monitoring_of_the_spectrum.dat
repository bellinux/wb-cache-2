50|$|<b>The</b> core focus <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>Spectrum</b> Policy Task Force is {{to ensure}} the {{efficient}} and effective use <b>of</b> <b>the</b> radio <b>spectrum.</b> <b>The</b> radio <b>spectrum</b> currently being used plays {{a vital role in}} a vast amount of government and commercial services. These services include radio and television broadcasts, satellite communications, wireless networks, public safety communications, weather forecasting, etc. <b>The</b> radio <b>spectrum</b> is <b>the</b> section <b>of</b> <b>the</b> electromagnetic <b>spectrum</b> that spans from about 3 kilohertz to 300 gigahertz. Television broadcasts, radios, mobile phones, and military and government communication systems are best operated in the 100 MHZ to 3GHz radio <b>spectrum.</b> <b>The</b> current use <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>spectrum</b> is mostly focused on <b>the</b> lower 1% <b>of</b> these frequencies. With the gradual increases in technological innovation and wireless communication, <b>the</b> usable part <b>of</b> <b>the</b> radio <b>spectrum</b> has also been greatly expanded. From here on, there will only be gradual increases in the technology and devices that depend on <b>the</b> radio <b>spectrum</b> for their functionality. The National Telecommunication and Information Administration (NTIA) deals with radio <b>spectrum</b> policies on <b>the</b> international level as well as federal government use <b>of</b> <b>the</b> radio <b>spectrum.</b> <b>The</b> allocation <b>of</b> <b>the</b> radio <b>spectrum</b> differs around <b>the</b> globe, but since electromagnetic waves travel the same way through <b>the</b> air, <b>spectrum</b> management decisions are generally coordinated internationally. The Federal Communication Commission’s (FCC) primary focus is on all the nonfederal, state, and local governments’ use <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>spectrum.</b> To manage <b>the</b> <b>spectrum,</b> both <b>the</b> NTIA and FCC used the “command-and-control” approach; they dictated how each segment <b>of</b> <b>the</b> radio <b>spectrum</b> is used and who is eligible to use it. The command-and-control approach worked in <b>the</b> initial days <b>of</b> wireless communication, but in order to meet <b>the</b> needs <b>of</b> new technology innovations and modern mobile devices using wireless communication, a policy was required that was more consumer-oriented. The FCC formed a task force—the Spectrum Policy Task Force—whose primary role was to evaluate changes in <b>the</b> <b>spectrum</b> policy, ensure <b>the</b> efficient and effective use <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>spectrum,</b> and derive public benefit from <b>the</b> use <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>spectrum.</b>|$|R
