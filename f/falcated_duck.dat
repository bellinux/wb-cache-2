50|$|The <b>falcated</b> <b>duck</b> {{requires}} {{coastal wetlands}} for its survival. One {{of the most}} ecologically sensitive areas {{in the world is}} the eastern end of Nanhui county, China, and is a site for the <b>falcated</b> <b>duck</b> during the migratory season. This area is crucial for the <b>falcated</b> <b>duck</b> due to its population being extremely low. Urbanization and economic growth of this area has led to a significant environmental disturbance in this area. A reclamation project to create artificial wetlands was started in 1999 and finished in 2005. Studies have been done to see if the artificial wetlands were as efficient as the natural ones, and although the artificial wetlands did see migratory shorebirds present, their population was not as high as the natural wetlands. Much more research needs to be done before the artificial wetlands can match the natural wetlands, and provide an acceptable habitat for the <b>falcated</b> <b>duck.</b>|$|E
50|$|The <b>falcated</b> <b>duck</b> or falcated teal (Mareca falcata) is a gadwall-sized dabbling duck.|$|E
50|$|It is {{estimated}} that there are about 89,000 <b>falcated</b> <b>ducks</b> in total; this {{is much higher than}} the previous population estimate of 35,000 worldwide.|$|R
50|$|Around {{the time}} of the {{harvesting}} seasons during the Chinese spring festival of winter in Nanhui County of Shanghai, China, the pond managers drain the water in the pond in order to catch fish for commercial purposes. Around that time, the pond was dominated by <b>falcated</b> <b>ducks</b> roosting there. After the pond is drained it remains dry until the following spring when water is replenished for fresh cultivation. The time that the water is replenished is very critical for migrant waterbirds in the spring. If the water is replenished too late then the dry pond is inapt for shorebirds and herons.|$|R
50|$|There {{are several}} {{proposed}} plans {{of action in}} protecting the <b>falcated</b> <b>duck.</b> Conservationists are keen to continue monitoring populations that have unfortunately stopped breeding, and plan to petition for hunting and shooting regulations on both the local and national level, respectively. Conservationists are also aware as to the great lack of education in regards to waterfowl extinction. For hunters who make a living off of either using the <b>falcated</b> <b>duck</b> as a food source or from simple sport hunts, conservationists are looking for alternative employment opportunities. Finally, conservationists hope to improve the management and coordination of already existing nature reserves where the <b>falcated</b> <b>duck</b> is present.|$|E

50|$|A {{fieldwork}} {{study at}} Hyo-ko Waterfowl Park, a nature preserve in Niigata, Japan, found what they presumed {{was a male}} hybrid of a <b>falcated</b> <b>duck</b> and a Eurasian wigeon. They have found these “wild” hybrids in several instances {{over the past few}} years. These birds shared morphological traits with both species. Still, most of the traits favored the <b>falcated</b> <b>duck.</b> It was reported that these hybrid birds have joined courting parties of Eurasian widgeon and even attempted to compete with widgeon males. Grunt-whistling, and burping calls being the method of inciting courtship, even resemble that of the <b>falcated</b> <b>duck</b> and not of the Eurasian wigeon. The hybrid bird most be closely watched, was quite sexually active, however, it is not yet known if they can reproduce with either of the female species. Hybridization between two different species often leaves the offspring sterile, but this genus shows a surprising amount of hybrid fertility. This hybrid species performed courtship rituals more closely related to the <b>falcated</b> <b>duck,</b> yet socially was active in Eurasian wigeon flocks. Successful reproduction was not seen between the hybrid species and a pure Eurasian wigeon female during the fieldwork study. Further study of hybrid avian species can help shed light onto avian reproduction and their evolutionary biology.|$|E
50|$|<b>Falcated</b> <b>duck</b> {{populations are}} present {{in a number of}} {{wildlife}} preservers, national parks, zoos, and other protected areas such as the Colusa National Wildlife Refuge in Sacramento, California.|$|E
50|$|It {{should be}} noted that the <b>falcated</b> <b>duck</b> is {{primarily}} native to Asia. The range of Anas falcata, in more colloquial terms, is from eastern Siberia and Mongolia to northern Japan with wintering grounds in southeast Asia to eastern India. There have also been sightings of falcated teals in America, Poland and Thailand. However, these sightings have been attributed to vagrant ducks and ducks that have escaped from captivity, and while the <b>falcated</b> <b>duck</b> has the capacity to immigrate from the far east to the west, it is rare to find the bird outside of Asia and Eurasia.|$|E
50|$|During {{a survey}} done in Central China, a migratory {{area in the}} winter for the <b>falcated</b> <b>duck,</b> the numbers of animals sighted was minimal. In 2004 only 4 were recorded, and in 2005 only 10.|$|E

5000|$|The <b>falcated</b> <b>duck</b> is {{currently}} {{in a state of}} [...] "near threatened" [...] on the IUCN's Red List. They are protected under the Migratory Bird Treaty Act, and their overall population seems to be (for the most part) stable and growing.|$|E
50|$|There {{are three}} extant species: the Eurasian wigeon (Anas penelope), the American wigeon (A. americana) and the Chiloé wigeon (A. sibilatrix). A fourth species, the Amsterdam wigeon (Anas marecula), became extinct in the 19th century. The wigeons {{are closely related}} to the gadwall and the <b>falcated</b> <b>duck.</b>|$|E
50|$|The female <b>falcated</b> <b>duck</b> is dark brown, with plumage {{much like}} a female wigeon. Its long grey bill is an aid to identification. The eclipse male is like the female, but darker {{on the back and}} head. In flight both sexes show a pale grey underwing. The blackish {{speculum}} is bordered with a white bar on its inner edge. Young birds are buffer than the female and have short tertials.|$|E
50|$|The <b>falcated</b> <b>duck</b> breeds {{in eastern}} Asia. It nests in eastern Russia, in Khabarovsk, Primorskiy, Amur, Chita, Buryatia, Irkutsk, Tuva, eastern Krasnoyarsk, south central Sakha Sakhalin, extreme northeastern North Korea and {{northern}} China, in northeastern Inner Mongolia, and northern Heilongjiang, and in northern Japan, Hokkaidō, Aomori, and the Kuril Islands. It is widely recorded well outside its normal range, but {{the popularity of}} this beautiful duck in captivity clouds the origins of these extralimital birds.|$|E
50|$|All three wigeons are {{similarly}} shaped, with a steep forehead and bulbous rear to the head. Males have a distinctive breeding plumage, in their eclipse plumage they resemble females, which {{are similar in}} appearance year-round. The three species' closest relatives within the genus Anas are the gadwall and the <b>falcated</b> <b>duck.</b> All three wigeon species hybridise in captivity while American and Eurasian wigeons hybridise in the wild. An American wigeon × mallard hybrid has also been recorded.|$|E
50|$|Falcated ducks {{have a very}} {{intricate}} courtship ritual. Females {{perform a}} series of inciting calls and other movements while preening behind the wings of their targeted male. Males use a courting method similar {{to others in the}} Anas genus, including an introductory shake, a neck-stretching burp call, a grunt whistle, and a head-up-tail-up display. During the mating season the falcated ducks form monogamous pairs that last throughout the mating season.It is not known how long the <b>falcated</b> <b>duck</b> lifespan is. There is also not much information on their territory size because these ducks are not studied as closely as other more popular species like swans or geese.|$|E
50|$|Falcated ducks {{have food}} habits {{generally}} consisting of small invertebrate and other insects {{as well as}} plant foods. They mainly eat vegetation or insects near to the water, consuming animals such as larvae, crustaceans, and mollusks. They likewise eat plant foods: leaves as well as seeds, grains, and nuts. Many assume that the <b>falcated</b> <b>duck</b> helps disperse seeds over large areas because of their diet. These ducks are primarily herbivorous. These ducks are hosts {{to a number of}} different parasites (ticks, fleas, lice) and thus carry diseases such as: the West Nile virus, avian influenza, avian pox, salmonellosis, staphylococcosis, and E. coli. Moreover, they carry viruses, bacteria, fungi and protozoans that can be transferred to other creatures, for instance vertebrates and even humans.|$|E
50|$|Like one of {{many species}} of birds, the <b>falcated</b> <b>duck</b> migrates through the Atlantic Ocean. It has a large range, with an {{estimated}} global extent of occurrence of 1,000,000-10,000,000 km2. Like 32 other species this bird flies from Eurasia to the eastern United States between the months of August and September. However, 32 species of birds is {{a small percentage of}} the population that actually migrate in between hemispheres. These migrations from country to country can cause some diseases (viruses) from insects such as mosquitoes, spread from Europe to North America. The infection happens when the mosquito bites one of the members of the ducks while in one place, for instance West Nile, and carry the infectious blood into the New World.|$|E
5000|$|The crested {{shelduck}} was initially collected in April 1877 near Vladivostock, Russia. However, {{it was not}} described until 1890 when the English zoologist Philip Lutley Sclater decided that the specimen was a possible hybrid between the ruddy shelduck (Tadorna ferruginea) and <b>falcated</b> <b>duck</b> (Anas falcata). Around 1913, a pair was collected in Korea, and the male was presented to Japanese ornithologist Nagamichi Kuroda. Kuroda noted that the plumage of the specimens was not definitively intermediate between Sclater's suggested parents of the alleged hybrid. Another female was collected and given to Kuroda in 1916, and supported by three specimens of a bird which was clearly not a hybrid and a historical record of the species in Japan, Kuroda described this bird as Pseudotadorna cristata in 1917. The 1916 female was designated the holotype and preserved with the male in Kuroda's collection. A {{member of the family}} Anatidae, this species was considered distinct enough to merit its own genus by Kuroda, but is now placed in the genus Tadorna, which includes six other species of Old World shelducks. The genus name Tadorna comes from the Celtic word tadorne and means [...] "pied waterfowl", essentially the same as the English [...] "shelduck". The specific epithet, cristata, comes from the Latin word for crested. The species' common name is derived from the tuft of green feathers from the shelduck's head. This species is also known as the Korean {{crested shelduck}}, Korean sheldrake, and Korean Mandarin.|$|E
50|$|There {{are many}} species that have {{mitochondrial}} DNA lineages that are phylogenetically intermixed with other species, but studies have rarely tested {{the cause of}} such paraphyly. In a study that was conducted, there were tested two hypotheses that could explain mitochondrial paraphyly of Holarctic gadwalls (Anas strepera) with respect to Asian falcated ducks (A. falcata). First, hybridization could have resulted in <b>falcated</b> <b>duck</b> mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) introgressing into the gadwall gene pool. Second, gadwalls and falcated ducks could have diverged so recently that mtDNA lineages have not sorted to reciprocal monophyly. They used coalescent analyses of three independent loci to distinguish between these two hypotheses. Two lines of evidence support introgression. First, analyses of the three loci combined show that some introgression is necessary to explain current genetic diversity in gadwalls. Second, they generated alternative predictions regarding time since divergence estimated from mtDNA: falcated ducks and gadwalls would have diverged between 65,000 and 700,000 years before present (ybp) under the introgression hypothesis and between 11,000 and 76,000 ybp under the incomplete lineage sorting hypothesis. The two independent nuclear introns indicated that these species diverged between 210,000 and 5,200,000 ybp, which did not overlap the predicted time for incomplete lineage sorting. These analyses also suggested that ancient introgression (similar to 14,000 ybp) {{has resulted in the}} widespread distribution and high frequency of falcated-like mtDNA (5.5% of haplotypes) in North America. This is the first study to use a rigorous quantitative framework to reject incomplete lineage sorting as the cause of mitochondrial paraphyly.|$|E

40|$|Genetic {{diversity}} and divergence at a locus {{are the result}} of interactions among the fundamental evolutionary forces of mutation, genetic drift, gene flow and natural selection. Variation in the strength of these forces can cause high heterogeneity in {{diversity and}} divergence across the genome. The overall objective of this thesis was to examine the role of population history vs. selection in generating heterogeneity in genetic diversity and differentiation. In Chapter 1, I examine the role of dispersal behavior in causing genetic differentiation and population structure within and between two morphologically distinct Australian duck species that differ in ecology and life history characteristics. A five-locus nuclear dataset revealed nearly no divergence and similar values of genetic diversity between species. However, as predicted, I found significant population structure in the sedentary chestnut teal (Anas castanea) but no structure within the vagile grey teal (A. gracilis). In Chapter 2, a more rigorous examination of differentiation among nineteen autosomal loci also failed to uncover a genetic distinction between these two species. However, DNA sequences from seven loci sampled from the Z-chromosome revealed strong differentiation between chestnut and grey teal. Furthermore, the most divergent loci are clustered on the shorter p-arm of the chromosome, close to the centromere, suggesting this region as an island of differentiation that may have been important in the speciation process. These two species of Australian teal are perhaps the most recently diverged taxa examined to date that reveal a large Z-effect. In Chapter 3, I quantitatively tested the contribution of gene flow and introgression to the heterogeneity of genetic diversity and differentiation in two deeply divergent taxa, the <b>falcated</b> <b>duck</b> (A. falcata) and the gadwall (A. strepera). Consistent with previously published mitochondrial DNA analyses, 19 nuclear loci revealed the introgression of nuclear DNA from the <b>falcated</b> <b>duck</b> into the allopatric population of gadwall in North America, but not into the sympatric population in Eurasia. Furthermore, gene flow was insufficient to explain the high heterogeneity in genetic diversity in both species and differentiation between the taxa. Indeed, this heterogeneity failed to fit neutral models of population history, suggesting that selection may be having a pervasive effect throughout the genome. Overall, this research reveals heterogeneous patterns of diversity and differentiation among nuclear loci in both early and later stages of divergence. Gene flow alone could not explain this heterogeneity, suggesting a prominent role of selection. Substantial divergence at some loci suggests that the strength of divergent selection overrides the homogenizing effects of gene flow and maintains species integrity...|$|E
40|$|The surface-feeding, dabbling, or {{similarly}} described ducks are a {{group of}} about thirty-six species of mostly freshwater ducks that occur throughout the world. Many of them are temperate or arctic-breeding species that nest on dry land near freshwater ponds, marshes, rivers, or similar rather shallow bodies of water. Associated with this breeding habitat are their adaptations for foraging by 2 ̆ 2 tipping-up 2 ̆ 2 rather than by diving for food, an ability to land and take off abruptly from small water areas or land, and a moderately good walking ability but reduced perching capabilities as compared with perching ducks. Also unlike perching ducks, iridescent coloration on the wing is limited to the secondary feathers, or in rare cases is lacking altogether. The surface-feeding ducks are among the most abundant and familiar of all North American ducks and include such popular sporting species as mallards, pintails, wigeons, and various teals. They range in size from less than a pound to more than three pounds and are among the most agile of waterfowl in flight, relying on maneuverability rather than unusual speed to elude danger. The number of North American breeding species is somewhat uncertain, but is at least nine. Additionally, the European wigeon very probably nests occasionally in continental North America, the Baikal teal is possibly a very rare nester, and the Bahama pintail breeds in the West Indies. Further, the 2 ̆ 2 Mexican duck 2 ̆ 2 is often considered to be a separate species from the common mallard, as are the populations called the Florida duck and mottled duck, so these might also be added, bringing the possible total to fourteen. Beyond these, the <b>falcated</b> <b>duck</b> is recognized by the A. O. D. (1957) as belonging on the list of North American birds although there is no evidence for breeding, and in recent years there have been several sight records for the garganey, as well as an occurrence of the Chinese spot-billed duck (Anas poecilorhyncha) on Adak Island (Byrd et al., 1974). Some of the records of <b>falcated</b> <b>duck,</b> Baikal teal, and garganey may well have been the result of escapes from captivity, but it seems likely that others of them represent wild birds, and thus these species are included in this book. In most respects, the surface-feeding ducks closely resemble the perching ducks in their anatomy and biology, but differ from them in that they are nearly all ground-nesting species that are ill-adapted for perching. Although considerable diversity in bill shape exists among the surface-feeding ducks, most biologists now agree that recognition of a single genus (Anas) is most representative of the close relationships that exist among these species, rather than maintenance of the traditional separate genera for the shovelerlike ducks, the wig ons, and other subgroups. Similarly, it is quite clear that recognition of separate species of Old World and New World green-winged teals and species recognition for the endemic Mexican, Florida, and Gulf coast populations of mallards are not in keeping with the modem species concept of potentially interbreeding natural populations. Although such changes force some modifications of traditional vernacular names of these populations, these disadvantages seem minor compared to the distortions of natural relationships forced by the retention of traditional nomenclature...|$|E

In nearly all species both sexes have iridescent wing speculum markings, and in all species the trachea has an enlarged bulla at the syrinx.
