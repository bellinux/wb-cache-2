The rains most significantly affected {{the municipalities of}} Ponce, Juana Díaz, Santa Isabel, and Coamo. Several stations reported 100 year flooding, just five months after similar floods affected the island. The <b>floods</b> <b>in</b> May generally affected the northern portion of the island, and the October event generally affected southern Puerto Rico, although the town of Barceloneta experienced <b>floods</b> <b>in</b> both events. Several rivers exceeded their banks, and the Toa Vaca reservoir filled to its capacity {{for the second time}} since it was constructed in 1972.|$|E

500|$|Minnesota {{is prone}} to <b>flooding</b> <b>in</b> its major rivers by spring {{snowmelt}} runoff and ice jams. [...] Spring flooding to some degree occurs almost annually on some Minnesota rivers, but major <b>floods</b> have occurred <b>in</b> 1965, 1969, 1997, 2001, and 2009. [...] The <b>flooding</b> <b>in</b> 1965 was the worst <b>flood</b> <b>in</b> Minnesota history on the Mississippi River, while the <b>flooding</b> <b>in</b> 1997 was the worst in history on the Red River. The Red River flood of 1997 was aided heavily by the 11 blizzards that struck Minnesota that winter. Besides heavy winter and spring snowfall, cold winter temperatures and heavy autumn and spring rains causing sudden run-off surges are also common causes of spring river <b>flooding</b> <b>in</b> Minnesota.|$|R

40|$|In this {{investigation}} of agoraphobic patients, 3 different flooding procedures were compared: (1) prolonged exposure <b>in</b> vivo, (2) <b>flooding</b> <b>in</b> the imagination by a ‘live’ therapist and (3) {{a combination of}} <b>flooding</b> <b>in</b> the imagination and <b>flooding</b> <b>in</b> vivo. After an intermediate-test all clients were treated by the self-observation method, {{with a minimum of}} therapeutic intervention. Assessments were made at the beginning of treatment, during {{and at the end of}} treatment and at the follow-up one month later. Assessments were carried out by the therapist (in vivo measurement; phobic anxiety and avoidance scales; anxious mood and panic), by an independent observer (idem. minus in vivo measurement) and by the client (phobic anxiety and avoidance scales; FSS; social anxiety scale; SDS and I-E scale). Prolonged exposure in vivo plainly proved to be superior to <b>flooding</b> <b>in</b> the imagination. Combined <b>flooding</b> resulted <b>in</b> a greater improvement than <b>flooding</b> <b>in</b> the imagination, though only on the therapist's ratings. Self-observation did not add much to the effect of prolonged exposure in vivo and of flooding combined whereas self-observation, preceded by <b>flooding</b> <b>in</b> the imagination, resulted in a significant improvement on nearly all the variables...|$|R
