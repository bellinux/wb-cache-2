50|$|Bass and panfish <b>flies,</b> <b>bugs</b> and poppers are {{generally}} designed to resemble both surface and sub-surface insect, crustacean, baitfish prey consumed by warm-water {{species such as}} Largemouth bass or bluegill. This genus of flies generally includes patterns that resemble small mammals, birds, amphibians or reptiles that may fall prey to fish, {{or in the case}} of panfish flies, small aquatic insects or crustaceans.|$|R
50|$|The scarlet myzomela is arboreal, {{foraging}} in the crowns of trees, darting from flower to flower, probing for nectar {{with its}} long curved bill. It sometimes hovers {{in front of}} flowers while feeding. Trees visited include turpentine (Syncarpia glomulifera), paperbarks (Melaleuca spp.) and banksias. Insects eaten include beetles, <b>flies,</b> <b>bugs</b> and caterpillars. It is omnivorous, and also feeds on insects as well as nectar, sallying for flying insects in the canopy.|$|R
5000|$|Upland {{sandpipers}} forage in fields, {{picking up}} food by sight. They are frequently sighted on fence posts and even telephone poles. When an [...] "uppy" [...] alights, it holds its wings {{up for a}} few seconds. They are constantly scanning the horizon for intruders. The upland sandpiper's diet includes grasshoppers, crickets, weevils, beetles, moths, ants, <b>flies,</b> <b>bugs,</b> centipedes, millipedes, spiders, snails and earthworms. It also eats some grains and seeds.|$|R
5|$|Juvenile loggerheads {{share the}} Sargassum habitat {{with a variety}} of other organisms. The mats of Sargassum contain as many as 100 {{different}} species of animals on which the juveniles feed. Some of the prey, such as ants, <b>flies,</b> <b>bugs,</b> leafhoppers, and beetles, are carried by the wind to these areas. plant prey of the mats include barnacles, small crab larvae, fish eggs, and plantonn colonies. Marine mammals and commercial fish, such as tuna, also inhabit the mats.|$|R
5000|$|Elizabeth Marks {{alone or}} jointly {{described}} 38 new mosquito species, {{as well as}} new species of fruit <b>flies,</b> <b>bugs,</b> cockroaches and ticks. Another 43 species of mosquito identified by her, have yet to be described satisfactorily. [...] She was well known for her practical streak, being able to solve problems with inventive solutions. She was equally famous for her Army metal soup ladle which was used to collect mosquito larvae and as an oar when an outboard motor might break down.|$|R
50|$|Desert Storm is {{a double}} looping roller coaster located at Castles N' Coasters, an {{amusement}} park in Phoenix, Arizona. It {{is one of the}} two roller coasters there, the other being the smaller Patriot roller coaster. Desert Storm passes over top of the Li'l Indy go-cart track and extremely close to Splashdown, the park's log flume. The track has a green and white color scheme and the queue line passes by the <b>Flying</b> <b>Bugs</b> and Spinning Tops kiddie rides, climbs stairs and enters the boarding area.|$|R
50|$|The {{species is}} often seen alone or in small groups of up to four birds. If startled it may crouch to avoid detection, or may run away, but seldom flies unless danger is very close. Even then, it flies with rapid wingbeats for only a short distance. It forages by {{scratching}} in the plant litter like a chicken, leaving distinctive circular depressions. It mainly feeds on invertebrates and has a particular liking for termite larvae. One individual {{was found to have}} eaten snails, cockroaches, beetles, <b>flies,</b> <b>bugs</b> and caterpillars. It may also eat seeds.|$|R
50|$|The diet {{consists}} {{primarily of}} ants, with <b>flies,</b> beetles, <b>bugs,</b> and soft-bodied larvae. They separate themselves from other organisms, {{which is why}} there is little info on the Xantusia arizonae.|$|R
2500|$|This species {{constructs}} conspicuous tubular silken nests under {{rocks and}} wood {{on the ground}} and sometimes grape vines. They remain inside these at night and during bad weather. Molting, egg laying and sometimes courtship and mating occur inside these nests. Most of the time they feed on prey about half their own size, but a range from [...] to about [...] has been observed. Although found to feed {{on a wide variety of}} insects (e.g., <b>flies,</b> <b>bugs</b> and moth caterpillars and adults), they also prey heavily on spiders. Cannibalism does occur from time to time, in the form of females feeding on males.|$|R

50|$|The {{black-necked stilt}} is an {{interesting}} bird {{that can be found}} at Weed Lake. It has a black head, very pink legs and is approximately 36 to 38 cm. It usually likes to eat <b>flies,</b> <b>bugs,</b> tadpoles and small fish in and around Weed Lake. When female black necked stilt are full grown, they will look for a male and find a home to have babies. They make a nest in grassy areas on the ground and lay the eggs from about 25 days. These birds are quite rare and uncommon so you will need to look carefully to spot them. They do however make a loud yip-yip-yip noise in the summer months, and kek-kek-kek while they are flying.|$|R

40|$|Strong {{adhesion}} between solids with {{rough surfaces}} is only possible if {{at least one}} of the solids is elastically very soft. Some lizards and spiders are able to adhere (dry adhesion) and move on very rough vertical surfaces due to very compliant surface layers on their attachment pads. <b>Flies,</b> <b>bugs,</b> grasshoppers and tree frogs have less compliant pad surface layers, and in these cases adhesion to rough surfaces is only possible because the animals inject a wetting liquid into the pad - substrate contact area, which generates a relative long-range attractive interaction due to the formation of capillary bridges. In this presentation I will discuss some aspects of wet adhesion for tree frogs and give some comments related to tire applications...|$|R
60|$|We gave {{up trying}} to beat him on variety after that, and settled down to the {{apparently}} simple task of trying to find out how many insects he could eat before calling halt. But even here K'dunk was too much for us; we never, singly or all together, reached the limit of his appetite. Once we fed him ninety rose-bugs without stopping. Another afternoon, when three boys appeared at the same hour, we put our catch together, a varied assortment of <b>flies,</b> <b>bugs,</b> and creeping things, a hundred and sixty-four head all told. Before dark K'dunk had eaten them all, and went hopping off to the garden on his night's hunting--as if he had not already done enough to prove himself our friend for the entire summer.|$|R

[...] The consumption of insects by these bats can be quite significant.|$|R
50|$|Later {{that night}} at 08:00, Porky Pig sets the alarm clock as Gabby {{complains}} about {{having to go to}} bed early. Porky reminds Gabby that if they are late again, they will be fired. Porky climbs into bed, and they both fall asleep until a bunch of cats next door wake them up; and later a <b>fly</b> <b>bugs</b> them, literally. Later that night, the moon comes out and its light wakes up Porky. One of Porky's attempts to close the window ends up wrecking his bed. As the night progresses, a thunderstorm occurs while Porky is sleeping in Gabby's bed. A leak in the roof disturbs Gabby, who then opens an umbrella in the house with Porky telling him that it's bad luck. Gabby ignores Porky's statement until lightning destroys the umbrella. When Gabby quotes that he should try sleeping under Niagara Falls, a lot of water comes through the roof and down on them.|$|R
