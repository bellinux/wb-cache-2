2500|$|Promulgation is the act {{by which}} the {{legislator}} manifests to those subject to his jurisdiction the decision {{that he has made}} and makes known to them his intention to bind them to the observance of his law. Without having been promulgated, the canonical law in question has no legal effect, since promulgation is [...] "an essential factor of legislation" [...] and [...] "an absolute condition for the effectiveness of a law". Philosophically {{it is a matter of}} dispute whether promulgation <b>is</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>essence</b> of a law. It seems indisputable that the essential element of a law is the will of the legislator, but it is clear that the legislator should make known his will and intention in one way or another. This manifestation is the promulgation of the law, which is not necessarily distinct from the very elaboration of the law, provided that this takes place by external acts. Once promulgation takes place, a canonical law acquires its last [...] "essential condition" [...] and takes immediate effect, subject to the vacatio legis imposed by universal law, or by the particular legislator issuing a law (see section below). Promulgation is a [...] "formal and fundamental element" [...] of canon law. For the purposes of canonical jurisprudence, promulgation is equivalent to publication, although the promulgation of a law must not be confounded with its publication, the object of the first being to make known the will of the legislator, of the second to spread the knowledge of legislative enactments among subjects bound to observe them.|$|E
2500|$|Jacobs' book {{advances}} {{the view}} that Quebec's eventual independence is best for Montreal, Toronto, the rest of Canada, and the world; and that such independence can be achieved peacefully. As precedent, she cites Norway's secession from Sweden and how it enriched both nations. The origins of the contemporary secessionist-movement in the Quiet Revolution are examined, along with Canada’s historical reliance on natural resources and foreign-owned manufacturing for its own economic development. Jacobs asserts that such an approach is colonial and hence backward, citing by example Canada buying its skis and furniture from Norway or Norwegian-owned factories in Canada, the latter procedure being a product of Canadian tariffs designed specifically to foster such factories. The relevant public views of René Lévesque, Claude Ryan, and then Prime Minister Pierre Trudeau are also critically analyzed, an example being their failure to recognize that two respective, independent currencies {{are essential to the}} success of an independent Quebec and a smaller resultant Canada, an issue that is central to her book. Jacobs stresses the need for Montreal to continue developing its leadership of Québécois culture, but that such a need can ultimately never be fulfilled by Montreal's increasing tendencies toward regional-city status, tendencies foretelling economic, political, and cultural subservience to English-speaking Toronto. Such an outcome, Jacobs believed, would in the long run doom Quebec's independence as much as it would hinder Canada's own future. She concludes with her observation that the popular equating of political secession with political and economic failure {{is the result of the}} Enlightenment, which perceived nature as a force for [...] "standardization, uniformity, universality, and immutability." [...] Since then, naturalists and their readers have gradually realized that nature is a force for diversity, and that, [...] "diversity itself <b>is</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>essence</b> of excellence." [...] The right kind of secession, Jacobs states, can lead to the right kind of diversity, and Quebec and Canada are capable of both, and must achieve both, to survive.|$|E

This fact is essential, because the evidence of old writers, from Herodotus to Egede, corroborates the evidence of travellers, Indian Civil Servants, and missionaries of today, by what Dr. Tylor, when defending our materials, calls 'the test of recurrence.' Professor Millar used the same argument in his Origin of Rank, in the last century.
