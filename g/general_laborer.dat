50|$|In the mid-1960s, craft service {{employees}} still operated as <b>general</b> <b>laborers.</b> They {{had also been}} {{put in charge of}} answering the telephone and making coffee. At Universal Studios, they had huge roll-around carts where they would brew coffee. These carts could be shut during takes so that the bubbling machines would not spoil a sound take. There was a dish into which cast and crew members could throw a quarter for their coffee at Universal, not at other studios. Eventually, the laborers added doughnuts as a revenue stream, but often had to interrupt the display to dig a trench for dolly tracks or clean up after animals.|$|R

2500|$|Lao {{society was}} divided with the {{religious}} and secular authority {{of the royal family}} at the top, followed by nobles, and then the peasantry which included merchants, artisans, farmers, and <b>general</b> <b>laborers.</b> [...] Outside the system but above all were the sangha or clergy, which provided not only social mobility but also a means for education.

50|$|The {{most common}} color scheme is white for managers, architects, engineers, foremen or supervisors. Other hard hat styles may be {{required}} for a job; brown fiberglass hard hats are worn by welders and other workers for high heat applications. Green often signifies a safety inspector, but is also occasionally used for new workers. <b>General</b> <b>laborers</b> and earth-moving operators often wear yellow. Carpenters, technical advisers and temps may wear blue. Orange is sometimes used for road crews, new employees or visitors. Some companies offer loaner hard hats in pink for workers who forget their own hard hat; the color operates as both a stigmatization penalty and a deterrent against theft. At one time, blasters traditionally wore red.|$|R

25|$|Throughout {{the latter}} half of the nineteenth century and into the early twentieth century, North Dakota, along with most of the midwest, {{experienced}} a mass influx of newcomers, from both the eastern United States and immigrants from Europe. North Dakota was a known popular destination for immigrant farmers and <b>general</b> <b>laborers</b> and their families, mostly from Norway, Sweden, Germany and the United Kingdom. Much of this settlement gravitated throughout the western side of the Red River Valley, as was similarly seen in South Dakota and in a parallel manner in Minnesota. This area is well known for its fertile lands. By the outbreak of the First World War, this was among North America's richest farming regions. But a period of higher rainfall ended, and many migrants weren't successful in the arid conditions. Many family plots were too small to farm successfully.|$|R

50|$|As part of French Indochina both Laos and Cambodia {{were seen}} {{as a source of}} raw {{materials}} and labor for the more important holdings in Vietnam. French colonial presence in Laos was light; the Resident Superieur was responsible for all colonial administration from taxation to justice and public works. The French maintained a military presence in the colonial capital under the Garde Indigene made up of Vietnamese soldiers under a French commander. In important provincial cities like Luang Prabang, Savannakhet, and Pakse there would be an assistant resident, police, paymaster, postmaster, schoolteacher and a doctor. Vietnamese filled most upper level and mid-level positions within the bureaucracy, with Lao being employed as junior clerks, translators, kitchen staff and <b>general</b> <b>laborers.</b> Villages remained under the traditional authority of the local headmen or chao muang. Throughout the colonial administration in Laos the French presence never amounted to more than a few thousand Europeans. The French concentrated on the development of infrastructure, the abolition of slavery and indentured servitude (although corvee labor was still in effect), trade including opium production, and most importantly the collection of taxes.|$|R

The list included 21 names with a total in collected rewards of over $12,000; naturally, Hardin headed the list. However, changing times on the Texas frontier ultimately forced Duncan to seek more mundane forms of employment; later in life he worked as: Dallas Sanitation Inspector, <b>general</b> <b>laborer,</b> carpenter, hotel clerk, and as watchman for the Corps of Engineers. He married Emma Jane Bowles on October 20, 1884, in Dallas, Texas. They had four children in 13 years.|$|E
5000|$|The fort was substantial. The palisades that {{protected}} it were 750 ft long, 450 ft wide and about 20 ft high.

The Governor's residence {{was in the}} center of Fort Vancouver was two stories tall. Inside was a dining hall where company clerks, traders, physicians and priest would dine with the supervising Chief Factor. In general the entire Governor's building and its meals were typically barred for <b>general</b> <b>laborers</b> and traders. After dinner the majority of these men would relocate to the [...] "Bachelor's Hall" [...] to [...] "amuse themselves as they please, either in smoking, reading, or telling and listening to stories of their own and others' curious adventures." [...] As Dunn recalled; [...] "The smoking room ... presents the appearance of an armoury and a museum.

25|$|The {{services}} sector also employs {{a significant percentage}} of females and, possibly, for similar reasons. Service jobs such as culinary arts, retail, and administrative work, similar to agriculture, is low-skill, low-paying labor-intensive work. Many bodies are needed to complete generally basic routine tasks. Accordingly, they are more suited to women in developing countries as higher-paying jobs may require a specificity of skills beyond those of the <b>general</b> female <b>laborer</b> and in countries with gender biases.|$|R
40|$|This paper {{analyzes}} socioeconomic {{characteristics of}} more than 1, 300 extremely poor households randomly selected from rural areas in four regions of Thailand in 1999. These "ultra poor " households are observed to share the same demographic and socioeconomic characteristics as the ordinary-poor households in Thailand, such as relatively large fam-ily sizes, large demographic dependency ratios, household heads with low or no school-ing, and lack of land assets. However, unlike the general poor, the ultra poor are more like-ly to be <b>general</b> <b>laborers</b> (instead of farm laborers), have {{a higher incidence of}} widows as heads of households, fewer number of working days, and greater burden of chronically ill and disabled persons in the family. Surprisingly, despite the Thai government's large num-ber of social assistance schemes, very few of the ultra poor report receiving any assis-tance. A large proportion of the ultra poor are very pessimistic about their prospects for escaping poverty. To help the ultra poor, the paper concludes that the government will need to maintain macroeconomic and sectoral policies that bring about economic growth, adopt general anti-poverty policies that promote income-generating opportunity and capability of the poor, and provide safety nets for those whose family members suffer from catastrophic and chronic illnesses and disabilities...|$|R
