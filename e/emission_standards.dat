5|$|In July 2016, the new Mayor of London Sadiq Khan {{announced}} the South Circular would {{become part of}} the London Ultra-Low Emission Zone boundary in 2020, meaning a daily charge of £12.50 for cars/vans/motorcycles and £100 for coaches/HGVs/buses, would need to be paid by vehicles not meeting key exhaust <b>emission</b> <b>standards.</b> The boundary had originally been proposed by Johnson the previous year, but covering a narrower area.|$|E
5|$|In November 2012 Transport for London (TfL) {{presented}} {{a proposal to}} abolish the Greener Vehicle Discount that benefited, among others, vehicles with small diesel engines that avoid the charge because their engines produce emissions of less than 100g per km of CO2. Approved by Mayor Boris Johnson in April 2013, the Ultra Low Emission Discount (ULED) went into effect on 1 July 2013. The ULED introduced more stringent <b>emission</b> <b>standards</b> that limit the free access to the congestion charge zone to all-electric cars, some plug-in hybrids, and any car or van that emits 75g/km or less of CO2 and meets the Euro 5 <b>emission</b> <b>standards</b> for air quality. The measure was designed to curb {{the growing number of}} diesel vehicles on London's roads. About 20,000 owners of vehicles registered for the Greener Vehicle Discount by June 2013 were granted a three-year sunset period before they have to pay the full congestion charge. The sunset period ended on 24 June 2016.|$|E
5|$|Developments in technology, such as computers, {{satellite}} communication, and the Internet, {{have contributed}} to many improvements within the industry. These developments have increased the productivity of company operations, saved {{the time and effort}} of drivers, and provided new, more accessible forms of entertainment to men and women who often spend long periods of time away from home. In 2006, the United States Environmental Protection Agency implemented revised <b>emission</b> <b>standards</b> for diesel trucks (reducing airborne pollutants emitted by diesel engines) which promises to improve air quality and public health.|$|E

25|$|The <b>emission</b> <b>standards</b> for {{vehicles}} for trucks (lorries) and buses {{are defined by}} engine energy output in g/kWh; this is unlike the <b>emission</b> <b>standards</b> for passenger cars and light commercial vehicles, which are defined by vehicle driving distance in g/km - a general comparison to passenger cars is therefore not possible, as the kWh/km factor depends (among other) on the specific vehicle.|$|E
25|$|For COMINCO, {{their company}} being subject to <b>emission</b> <b>standards</b> meant {{potentially}} limiting {{the output of}} their smelter. For {{the better part of}} twenty years the company fought every attempt to impose any sort of regulatory regime aimed at production levels.

We consider the cases where the number of firms is fixed and where there is free entry and exit of firms. When the number of firms is fixed (i) an <b>emission</b> <b>standard</b> is welfare-superior to a pollution-equivalent emission tax, and (ii) an emission tax is emission-superior to welfare-equivalent <b>emission</b> <b>standard.</b> Under free entry and exit, the results are just the opposite when the inverse demand function is concave...|$|R

25|$|Over the years, {{sour gas}} {{processing}} technology steadily improved. By 1970, more stringent <b>emission</b> <b>standards</b> were technically feasible.

25|$|Any {{motor vehicle}} built before the Euro <b>emission</b> <b>standards</b> were in force (called pre-E) {{is not allowed}} to enter the {{restricted}} zone (ZTL) from October 15 to April 15, as these vehicles have the worst polluting engines and the weather during this period worsens air quality. This is a restriction in force in the entire Lombardy region since 2007. Cleaner vehicles are exempted from the pollution charge and there is free access for all vehicles on Saturdays and Sundays, except as noted above. The amount of the charge payable depends on the type of vehicle according with their compliance with the European <b>emission</b> <b>standards,</b> and there is a discounted annual pass for residents within the restricted zone (ZTL). The following table details the daily and annual charges and the type of vehicles that are exempted.|$|E
50|$|The National <b>Emissions</b> <b>Standards</b> for Hazardous Air Pollutants, {{also using}} the acronym NESHAP, are <b>emissions</b> <b>{{standards}}</b> {{set by the}} United States Environmental Protection Agency—EPA.

25|$|By {{the late}} 90s, sales of all sporty coupes were declining in North America, so the Supra was {{withdrawn}} from the Canadian market in 1996 and the US in 1998.

25|$|In the United States, {{many states}} now use OBD-II testing instead of {{tailpipe}} testing in OBD-II compliant vehicles (1996 and newer).
