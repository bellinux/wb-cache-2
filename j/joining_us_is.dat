6000|$|... "Then you {{had better}} <b>join</b> <b>us.</b> We <b>are</b> going to try Stannard's line down the gully. I don't engage to make the woods, but I don't see another plan." ...|$|R
6000|$|... 'What can I do for you, Mr. Fagin?' inquired the man, as he {{followed}} {{him out to}} the landing. 'Won't you <b>join</b> <b>us?</b> They'll <b>be</b> delighted, every one of 'em.' ...|$|R
6000|$|There {{that when}} we were severed, how day dulled [...] Till time <b>joined</b> <b>us</b> anew, <b>was</b> chronicled: And {{arguments}} and battlings in defence of me [...] That heart recorded clearly and ruddily.|$|R
6000|$|... "Cantrip {{would not}} <b>join</b> <b>us.</b> There <b>is</b> no evil in {{politics}} so great {{as that of}} seeming to buy the men who will not come without buying. These rewards are fairly given for political support." ...|$|R

[...] "Are {{you of the}} mind to <b>join</b> <b>us,</b> or <b>is</b> it more to your liking to follow Amos Nelson and act as lickspittle to any lobster back you chance to come upon?" ...|$|R
60|$|At last {{my father}} <b>joined</b> <b>us.</b> He <b>was</b> {{extremely}} angry. I remember the out-thrust of his protruding underlip as he glared {{down at the}} wild pigs. He snarled something like a dog, and I remember that his eye-teeth were large, like fangs, and that they impressed me tremendously.|$|R
6000|$|... 'Why, I {{am going}} to have a small {{juvenile}} party to-night,' said Mrs. Alicumpaine; 'and if you and Mr. Orange and baby would but <b>join</b> <b>us,</b> we should <b>be</b> complete.' ...|$|R

6000|$|... "Here," [...] he remarked, [...] "we dwell {{for a few}} brief {{moments in}} Bohemia. I do not {{introduce}} you. You sit down and <b>join</b> <b>us.</b> You <b>are</b> one of <b>us.</b> That you speak only English counts for nothing. Mademoiselle Alice here is American.

6000|$|... “Leo! And you, too, Carl! Delighted to see you!” Nathan Wampole’s face {{took on a}} smile, and the boy was forgotten. “So {{you thought}} you would <b>join</b> <b>us</b> again. I <b>was</b> {{on the point of}} sending for you.” ...|$|R
6000|$|... 'Yesterday,' {{said the}} {{domestic}} mother. 'They talk of soon <b>joining</b> <b>us.</b> But Pluto <b>is</b> at present so busy, {{owing to the}} amazing quantity of wars going on now, that I am almost afraid he will scarcely be able to accompany her.' ...|$|R
6000|$|... "We {{will take}} our seats on that side," [...] Chris said, [...] "and {{as we move}} in shout to them to <b>join</b> <b>us.</b> It will <b>be</b> {{a great thing to}} get as many people we know in here as possible." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "It will be {{rectified}} in London, you know. Some English spirit will {{perhaps be}} mixed. But I must {{not tell you}} {{the secrets of the}} trade till you <b>join</b> <b>us.</b> That Bios <b>is</b> distilled from the bark of the Duffer-tree is a certainty." ...|$|R

We all like a play. Have not I done well, mother?" ...|$|R
5|$|Maurice Princet <b>joined</b> <b>us</b> often... it <b>was</b> as {{an artist}} that he {{conceptualized}} mathematics, as an aesthetician that he invoked n-dimensional continuums.

In Ireland, we should find tens of {{thousands}} of brave hearts ready to <b>join</b> <b>us,</b> but they <b>are</b> unarmed, undrilled, and undisciplined, and would be of comparatively slight assistance to us against the English troops. Defeat would bring down fresh persecutions, fresh confiscations, and greater misery upon the land." ...|$|R
