50|$|Chick sexing is {{optionally}} done {{to improve}} uniformity - since males grow faster, the weights are more uniform if males and females are raised separately. The birds are bred so that males and females have unique feather patterns or color differences. Unlike <b>egg-laying</b> <b>poultry,</b> males are not culled.|$|E
50|$|In meat-type breeds, feather sexing {{was not so}} {{extended}} to commercialbroiler production because resulting poorly-feathered males are very prone to scratches in {{the skin of the}} belly, which can descredit carcass quality. After all, unlike <b>egg-laying</b> <b>poultry,</b> meat-type male chicks are not culled, so broiler males can be set apart later, once sexual differences become evident.|$|E
40|$|Dermanyssus gallinae has a {{worldwide}} distribution {{and is considered}} to be the most serious and economically significant ectoparasite affecting <b>egg-laying</b> <b>poultry</b> in Europe. Recombinant Bm 86 and subolesin proteins derived from Boophilus microplus ticks and Aedes albopictus mosquitoes were used to immunise poultry in an attempt to control D. gallinaein vitro. Immunisation with subolesin and Bm 86 stimulated different profiles of IgY response, whilst Bm 86 but not subolesin was recognized by IgY on western blots. Orthologues for Bm 86 were not found in D. gallinae by PCR, but a 150 bp fragment aligned with mammalian akirin 1 and a 300 bp fragment aligned with Amblyomma hebraeum were amplified by subolesin PCR. D. gallinae mortality after feeding was 35. 1 % higher (P = 0. 009) in the Subolesin group and 23 % higher (not significant) in the Bm 86 compared to the Control group. Thus it can be concluded that immunisation with recombinant subolesin can stimulate a protective response in laying hens against D. gallinae...|$|E
500|$|Since their domestication, a {{large number}} of breeds of {{chickens}} have been established, but {{with the exception of the}} white Leghorn, most commercial birds are of hybrid origin. In about 1800, chickens began to be kept on a larger scale, and modern high-output poultry farms were present in the United Kingdom from around 1920 and became established in the United States soon after the Second World War. By the mid-20th century, the poultry meat-producing industry was of greater importance than the <b>egg-laying</b> industry. <b>Poultry</b> breeding has produced breeds and strains to fulfil different needs; light-framed, egg-laying birds that can produce 300 eggs a year; fast-growing, fleshy birds destined for consumption at a young age, and utility birds which produce both an acceptable number of eggs and a well-fleshed carcase. Male birds are unwanted in the egg-laying industry and can often be identified as soon as they are hatch for subsequent culling. In meat breeds, these birds are sometimes castrated (often chemically) to prevent aggression. [...] The resulting bird, called a capon, has more tender and flavorful meat, as well.|$|R
50|$|Incubation {{refers to}} {{the process by which}} certain oviparous (egg-laying) animals hatch their eggs; it also {{refers to the}} {{development}} of the embryo within the egg. Multiple and various factors are vital to the incubation of various species of animal. In many species of reptile for example, no fixed temperature is necessary, but the actual temperature determines the sex ratio of the offspring. In birds in contrast, the genders of offspring are genetically determined, but in many species a constant and particular temperature is necessary for successful incubation. Especially in poultry, the act of sitting on eggs to incubate them is called brooding. The action or behavioral tendency to sit on a clutch of eggs is also called broodiness, and most <b>egg-laying</b> breeds of <b>poultry</b> have had this behavior selectively bred out of them to increase production.|$|R

The name derives from the town of Bantam in Java where European sailors bought the local small chickens for their shipboard supplies.

40|$|The {{quality of}} eggshells is an {{important}} trait for commercial egg production. A {{number of studies have}} linked polymorphisms in the gene encoding the eggshell protein ovocalyxin- 32 (OCX 32) with eggshell features including strength and thickness, indicating that variants in the gene may be relevant to the selection of commercial <b>egg-laying</b> <b>poultry</b> lines. In this study (Fulton et al., 2012), exons 2 - 6 of the OCX 32 gene were sequenced in multiple elite commercial egg-laying lines, and SNP detection and analysis carried out using LGC’s KASPTM genotyping chemistry to identify multiple polymorphisms. The genotype data was used to identify changes in amino acids, infer novel protein haplotypes, and associate these protein variations with a range of egg traits. The study identified 28 SNPs and 1 SNP/InDel in exons 2 - 6 of the OCX 32 gene, which encompasses 78 % of the gene coding region. SNP analysis data indicated that the poultry lines tested carry 19 different variants of the OCX 32 protein. Trait association studies indicated that the variants were linked to different degrees with traits including eggshell colour, early egg weight, albumen height, puncture score, and yolk weight. Selection pressure for some variants over time was also evident in three of the poultry lines, indicating that some polymorphisms in the OCX 32 gene may confer changes in egg traits that are desirable for commercial egg production...|$|E
40|$|Estimating optimal {{sample size}} for {{microbiological}} surveys {{is a challenge}} for laboratory managers. When insufficient sampling is conducted, biased inferences are likely; however, when excessive sampling is conducted valuable laboratory resources are wasted. This report presents a statistical model for the estimation of the sample size appropriate for the accurate identification of the bacterial subtypes of interest in a specimen. This applied model for microbiology laboratory use {{is based on a}} Bayesian mode of inference, which combines two inputs: (ii) a prespecified estimate, or prior distribution statement, based on available scientific knowledge and (ii) observed data. The specific inputs for the model are a prior distribution statement of the number of strains per specimen provided by an informed microbiologist and data from a microbiological survey indicating the number of strains per specimen. The model output is an updated probability distribution of strains per specimen, which can be used to estimate the probability of observing all strains present according to the number of colonies that are sampled. In this report two scenarios that illustrate the use of the model to estimate bacterial colony sample size requirements are presented. In the first scenario, bacterial colony sample size is estimated to correctly identify Campylobacter amplified restriction fragment length polymorphism types on broiler carcasses. The second scenario estimates bacterial colony sample size to correctly identify Salmonella enterica serotype Enteritidis phage types in fecal drag swabs from <b>egg-laying</b> <b>poultry</b> flocks. An advantage of the model is that as updated inputs from ongoing surveys are incorporated into the model, increasingly precise sample size estimates are likely to be made...|$|E
40|$|Infection of <b>egg-laying</b> <b>poultry</b> with Salmonella enteritidis and the {{associated}} transmission of illness to consumers of contaminated eggs has been a prominent international public health concern for many years. Testing and risk reduction programs for laying flocks have been implemented in many nations with some success. However, several critical parameters of S. enteritidis infections in chickens, including {{the relationship between the}} magnitude of oral exposure and the frequency and duration of bacterial shedding in voided feces, remain incompletely defined or explained. In the present study, groups of laying hens were experimentally infected with oral doses of 10 4, 10 6, or 10 8 CFU of a phage type 13 a strain of S. enteritidis and the frequency at which the pathogen was shed in voided feces was determined at 8 weekly post-inoculation intervals. At 1 wk post-inoculation, the frequency of fecal shedding of S. enteritidis ranged from 23. 8 % for the 10 4 CFU dose to 87. 5 % for the 10 8 CFU dose. No fecal shedding was detected after 3 wk post-inoculation from hens inoculated with 10 4 CFU, but a small proportion (2. 5 % to 5. 0 %) of hens that received doses of 10 6 or more CFU of S. enteritidis were still shedding at 8 wk post-inoculation. The results {{of this study indicate that}} the oral exposure dose can significantly influence the frequency and duration of S. enteritidis fecal shedding into the environment by infected laying hens. A more complete understanding of how different levels of exposure are detected by particular sampling methods will support the effective application and interpretation of testing protocols for controlling poultry infections and preventing transmission to humans...|$|E
40|$|Ambient {{temperature}} in {{the central part of}} Vietnam in summer can reach 32 – 35 °C; in some places it can be more than 42 °C. Hot climate strongly affects the animal organism alongside with the animal weight reduction and reduction the quantity of <b>egg-laying</b> in <b>poultry.</b> Therefore, air conditioning in livestock buildings is necessary. There are several ways to cool the {{temperature in}} such buildings, and each one has its own advantages and disadvantages. We propose to use underground water at the temperature of 24 – 25 °C for this purpose. One of the methods of cooling sheds for livestock is sprinkler irrigation of water on the roof. For calculating the amount of heat, removed from the indoor air in the shed to the cooling water, in the first approximation specialists believe in some cases that an appropriate amount of heat being removed is determined mainly by heat transfer from the air inside the shed to the cooling water through the surface of the roof, represented by {{the lower part of the}} wave that form the surface of a metal tile, neglecting the influence of heat conduction on top of the wave of the tile surface. Consequentially, such a simplification leads to possible errors. Therefore, the authors solved the problem of cooling shed by irrigation of water on the roof by an analytical method. Specifically, we solved the problem of heat conductivity of the fin of the finite length of constant cross section, wherein different sides of the fin are conjugate with different environments. Additionally, the calculation considered the effect of solar radiation. For this purpose, the authors have created a heat balance equation at steady state for any infinitesimal element of the fin, and solved the differential equation afterwards. The authors applied the results for calculating practical problem of ground water irrigation of a roof of a livestock shed made of metal areas tiles.  </p...|$|R
