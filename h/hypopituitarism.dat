5|$|Generally, {{the finding}} of a {{combination}} of a low pituitary hormone together with a low hormone from the effector gland is indicative of <b>hypopituitarism.</b> Occasionally, the pituitary hormone may be normal but the effector gland hormone decreased; in this case, the pituitary is not responding appropriately to effector hormone changes, and the combination of findings is still suggestive of <b>hypopituitarism.</b>|$|E
5|$|<b>Hypopituitarism</b> {{is usually}} permanent. It {{requires}} lifelong treatment {{with one or}} more medicines.|$|E
5|$|The {{pituitary}} {{was known}} to the ancients, such as Galen, and various theories were proposed about {{its role in the}} body, but major clues as to the actual function of the gland were not advanced until the late 19th century, when acromegaly due to pituitary tumors was described. The first known report of <b>hypopituitarism</b> was made by the German physician and pathologist Dr Morris Simmonds. He described the condition on autopsy in a 46-year-old woman who had suffered severe puerperal fever eleven years earlier, and subsequently suffered amenorrhea, weakness, signs of rapid aging and anemia. The pituitary gland was very small and there were few remnants of both the anterior and the posterior pituitary. The eponym Simmonds' syndrome is used infrequently for acquired <b>hypopituitarism,</b> especially when cachexia (general ill health and malnutrition) predominates. Most of the classic causes of <b>hypopituitarism</b> were described in the 20th century; the early 21st century saw the recognition of how common <b>hypopituitarism</b> could be in previous head injury victims.|$|E
5|$|The {{signs and}} {{symptoms}} of <b>hypopituitarism</b> vary, depending on which hormones are undersecreted and on the underlying cause of the abnormality. The diagnosis of <b>hypopituitarism</b> is made by blood tests, but often specific scans and other investigations are needed to find the underlying cause, such as tumors of the pituitary, and the ideal treatment. Most hormones controlled by the secretions of the pituitary can be replaced by tablets or injections. <b>Hypopituitarism</b> is a rare disease, but may be significantly underdiagnosed in people with previous traumatic brain injury. The first description of the condition was made in 1914 by the German physician Dr Morris Simmonds.|$|E
5|$|Recent {{studies have}} shown that people with a {{previous}} traumatic brain injury, spontaneous subarachnoid hemorrhage (a type of stroke) or radiation therapy involving the head have a higher risk of <b>hypopituitarism.</b> After traumatic brain injury, as much as a quarter have persistent pituitary hormone deficiencies. Many of these people may have subtle or non-specific symptoms that are not linked to pituitary problems but attributed to their previous condition. It is therefore possible that many cases of <b>hypopituitarism</b> remain undiagnosed, and that the annual incidence would rise to 31 per 100,000 annually if people from these risk groups were to be tested.|$|E
5|$|Several {{studies have}} shown that <b>hypopituitarism</b> is {{associated}} with an increased risk of cardiovascular disease and some also an increased risk of death of about 50% to 150% the normal population. It has been difficult to establish which hormone deficiency is responsible for this risk, as almost all patients studied had growth hormone deficiency. The studies also do not answer the question as to whether the <b>hypopituitarism</b> itself causes the increased mortality, or whether some of the risk is to be attributed to the treatments, some of which (such as sex hormone supplementation) have a recognized adverse effect on cardiovascular risk.|$|E
5|$|Treatment of <b>hypopituitarism</b> is threefold: {{removing}} the underlying cause, treating the hormone deficiencies, and addressing any other repercussions {{that arise from}} the hormone deficiencies.|$|E
5|$|Difficult {{situations}} {{arise in}} deficiencies of the hypothalamus-pituitary-gonadal axis in people (both men and women) who experience infertility; infertility in <b>hypopituitarism</b> may {{be treated with}} subcutaneous infusions of FSH, human chorionic gonadotropin–which mimics the action of LH–and occasionally GnRH.|$|E
5|$|Long-term {{follow up}} by specialists in {{endocrinology}} is generally needed {{for people with}} known <b>hypopituitarism.</b> Apart from ensuring the right treatment is being used and at the right doses, this also provides an opportunity to deal with new symptoms and to address complications of treatment.|$|E
5|$|Several hormone {{deficiencies}} {{associated with}} <b>hypopituitarism</b> {{may lead to}} secondary diseases. For instance, growth hormone deficiency is associated with obesity, raised cholesterol and the metabolic syndrome, and estradiol deficiency may lead to osteoporosis. While effective treatment of the underlying hormone deficiencies may improve these risks, it is often necessary to treat them directly.|$|E
5|$|For TSH, basal {{measurements}} are usually sufficient, {{as well as}} measurements of thyroxine {{to ensure that the}} pituitary is not simply suppressing TSH production in response to hyperthyroidism (an overactive thyroid gland). A stimulation test with thyrotropin-releasing hormone (TRH) is not regarded as useful. Prolactin can be measured by basal level, and is required for the interpretation of LH and FSH results in addition to the confirmation of <b>hypopituitarism</b> or diagnosis of a prolactin-secreting tumor.|$|E
5|$|If the TSH {{level is}} normal or low and serum free T4 levels are low, this is suggestive of central {{hypothyroidism}} (not enough TSH or TRH secretion by the pituitary gland or hypothalamus). There {{may be other}} features of <b>hypopituitarism,</b> such as menstrual cycle abnormalities and adrenal insufficiency. There might also be symptoms of a pituitary mass such as headaches and vision changes. Central hypothyroidism should be investigated further to determine the underlying cause.|$|E
5|$|Other {{tests that}} may {{assist in the}} {{diagnosis}} of <b>hypopituitarism,</b> especially if no tumor is found on the MRI scan, are ferritin (elevated in hemochromatosis), angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE) levels (often elevated in sarcoidosis), and human chorionic gonadotropin (often elevated in tumor of germ cell origin). If a genetic cause is suspected, genetic testing may be performed.|$|E
5|$|After {{an episode}} of {{pituitary}} apoplexy, 80% of people develop <b>hypopituitarism</b> and require some form of hormone replacement therapy. The most common problem is growth hormone deficiency, which is often left untreated but may cause decreased muscle mass and strength, obesity and fatigue. 60–80% require hydrocortisone replacement (either permanently or when unwell), 50–60% need thyroid hormone replacement, and 60–80% of men require testosterone supplements. Finally, 10–25% develop diabetes insipidus, the inability to retain fluid in the kidneys {{due to a lack}} of the pituitary antidiuretic hormone. This may be treated with the drug desmopressin, which can be applied as a nose spray or taken by mouth.|$|E
5|$|The {{diagnosis}} of <b>hypopituitarism</b> is made on blood tests. Two types of blood tests {{are used to}} confirm {{the presence of a}} hormone deficiency: basal levels, where blood samples are taken–usually in the morning–without any form of stimulation, and dynamic tests, where blood tests are taken after the injection of a stimulating substance. Measurement of ACTH and growth hormone usually requires dynamic testing, whereas the other hormones (LH/FSH, prolactin, TSH) can typically be tested with basal levels. There is no adequate direct test for ADH levels, but ADH deficiency can be confirmed indirectly; oxytocin levels are not routinely measured.|$|E
5|$|The hormones of the {{pituitary}} {{have different}} {{actions in the}} body, and the symptoms of <b>hypopituitarism</b> therefore depend on which hormone is deficient. The symptoms may be subtle and are often initially attributed to other causes. In most of the cases, three or more hormones are deficient. The most common problem is insufficiency of follicle-stimulating hormone (FSH) and/or luteinizing hormone (LH) leading to sex hormone abnormalities. Growth hormone deficiency {{is more common in}} people with an underlying tumor than those with other causes.|$|E
5|$|Neurocognitive {{symptoms}}, such as fatigue, mood disturbances, {{and other}} related symptoms are common sequelae. Even in those who have made good neurological recovery, anxiety, depression, posttraumatic stress disorder, and cognitive impairment are common; 46 {{percent of people who}} have had a subarachnoid hemorrhage have cognitive impairment that affects their quality of life. Over 60 percent report frequent headaches. Aneurysmal subarachnoid hemorrhage may lead to damage of the hypothalamus and the pituitary gland, two areas of the brain that {{play a central role in}} hormonal regulation and production. More than a quarter of people with a previous SAH may develop <b>hypopituitarism</b> (deficiencies in one or more of the hypothalamic-pituitary hormones such as growth hormone, luteinizing hormone, or follicle-stimulating hormone).|$|E
5|$|Sometimes, {{there are}} {{additional}} symptoms {{that arise from}} the underlying cause; for instance, if the <b>hypopituitarism</b> {{is due to a}} growth hormone-producing tumor, there may be symptoms of acromegaly (enlargement of the hands and feet, coarse facial features), and if the tumor extends to the optic nerve or optic chiasm, there may be visual field defects. Headaches may also accompany pituitary tumors, as well as pituitary apoplexy (infarction or haemorrhage of a pituitary tumor) and lymphocytic hypophysitis (autoimmune inflammation of the pituitary). Apoplexy, in addition to sudden headaches and rapidly worsening visual loss, may also be associated with double vision that results from compression of the nerves in the adjacent cavernous sinus that control the eye muscles.|$|E
25|$|<b>Hypopituitarism</b> {{commonly}} develops after {{radiation therapy}} for sellar and parasellar neoplasms, extrasellar brain tumours, {{head and neck}} tumours, and following whole body irradiation for systemic malignancies. Radiation-induced <b>hypopituitarism</b> mainly affects growth hormone and gonadal hormones. In contrast, adrenocorticotrophic hormone (ACTH) and thyroid stimulating hormone (TSH) deficiencies are the least common among people with radiation-induced <b>hypopituitarism.</b> Changes in prolactin-secretion is usually mild, and vasopressin deficiency appears to be very rare {{as a consequence of}} radiation.|$|E
25|$|Hypoprolactinemia {{can result}} from <b>hypopituitarism,</b> {{excessive}} dopaminergic action in the tuberoinfundibular pathway and ingestion of D2 receptor agonists such as bromocriptine.|$|E
25|$|Some {{systemic}} {{conditions may}} cause delayed tooth development, such as nutritional factors, endocrine disorders (hypothyroidism, <b>hypopituitarism,</b> hypoparathyroidism, pseudohypoparathyroidism), undiagnosed and untreated celiac disease, anemia, prematurity, low birth weight, renal failure, heavy metal intoxication or tobacco smoke, among others.|$|E
25|$|In {{childhood}} and adulthood, the diagnosing doctor {{will look for}} these features accompanied by corroboratory evidence of <b>hypopituitarism</b> such as deficiency of other pituitary hormones, a structurally abnormal pituitary, or a history of damage to the pituitary. This would confirm the diagnosis; {{in the absence of}} pituitary pathology, further testing would be required.|$|E
25|$|The term <b>hypopituitarism</b> {{is often}} used interchangeably with GH {{deficiency}} by endocrinologists but more often denotes GH deficiency plus deficiency {{of at least one}} other anterior pituitary hormone. When GH deficiency (usually with other anterior pituitary deficiencies) is associated with posterior pituitary hormone deficiency (usually diabetes insipidus), the condition is termed panhypopituitarism.|$|E
25|$|Hemorrhage, {{or heavy}} blood loss, {{is still the}} leading cause of death of {{birthing}} mothers in the world today, especially in the developing world. Heavy blood loss leads to hypovolemic shock, insufficient perfusion of vital organs and death if not rapidly treated. Blood transfusion may be life saving. Rare sequelae include <b>Hypopituitarism</b> Sheehan's syndrome.|$|E
25|$|Severe {{prenatal}} {{deficiency of}} GH, as occurs in congenital <b>hypopituitarism,</b> has {{little effect on}} fetal growth. However, prenatal and congenital deficiency can {{reduce the size of}} a male's penis, especially when gonadotropins are also deficient. Besides micropenis in males, additional consequences of severe deficiency in the first days of life can include hypoglycemia and exaggerated jaundice (both direct and indirect hyperbilirubinemia).|$|E
25|$|In {{the even}} smaller {{minority}} of cryptorchid infants who have other obvious birth defects of the genitalia, further testing is crucial {{and has a}} high likelihood of detecting an intersex condition or other anatomic anomalies. Ambiguity can indicate either impaired androgen synthesis or reduced sensitivity. The presence of a uterus by pelvic ultrasound suggests either persistent Müllerian duct syndrome (AMH deficiency or insensitivity) or a severely virilized genetic female with congenital adrenal hyperplasia. An unambiguous micropenis, especially accompanied by hypoglycemia or jaundice, suggests congenital <b>hypopituitarism.</b>|$|E
25|$|GH {{treatment}} can confer {{a number of}} measurable benefits to severely GH-deficient adults, such as enhanced energy and strength, and improved bone density. Muscle mass may increase {{at the expense of}} adipose tissue. Although adults with <b>hypopituitarism</b> have been shown to have a reduced life expectancy, and a cardiovascular mortality rate more than double controls, treatment has not been shown to improve mortality, although blood lipid levels do improve. Similarly, although measurements of bone density improve with treatment, rates of fractures have not been shown to improve.|$|E
25|$|Endocrine {{abnormalities}} {{in other}} areas have also been present with the disorder. These include hypothyroidism, growth hormone deficiency and <b>hypopituitarism.</b> Findings affecting pituitary function in some JBS patients have included such anomalies as {{the formation of a}} glial hamartoma (a neoplasm, or tumor composed of glial cells) on a lobe of the pituitary gland, as well congenital underdevelopment of the anterior pituitary. Growth failure and associated short stature (dwarfism) in JBS can be attributed to growth hormone deficiency caused by diminished anterior pituitary function, with malabsorption of fats playing a subsequent role.|$|E
25|$|In {{addition}} to sepsis, distributive shock {{can be caused}} by systemic inflammatory response syndrome (SIRS) due to conditions other than infection such as pancreatitis, burns or trauma. Other causes include, toxic shock syndrome (TSS), anaphylaxis (a sudden, severe allergic reaction), adrenal insufficiency, reactions to drugs or toxins, heavy metal poisoning, hepatic (liver) insufficiency and damage to the central nervous system. Causes of adrenal insufficiency leading to distributive shock include acute worsening of chronic adrenal insufficiency, destruction or removal of the adrenal glands, suppression of adrenal gland function due to exogenous steroids, <b>hypopituitarism</b> and metabolic failure of hormone production.|$|E
500|$|Hormonal {{disturbances}} {{may occur}} secondary to <b>hypopituitarism,</b> occurring immediately or years after injury in 10 to 15% of TBI patients. Development of diabetes insipidus or an electrolyte abnormality acutely after injury indicate need for endocrinologic work up. Signs {{and symptoms of}} <b>hypopituitarism</b> may develop and be screened for in adults with moderate TBI and in mild TBI with imaging abnormalities. [...] Children with moderate to severe head injury may also develop <b>hypopituitarism.</b> Screening should take place 3 to 6 months, and 12 months after injury, but problems may occur more remotely.|$|E
500|$|There is {{only one}} study that has {{measured}} the prevalence (total number of cases in a population) and incidence (annual number of new cases) of <b>hypopituitarism.</b> This {{study was conducted in}} Northern Spain and used hospital records in a well-defined population. [...] The study showed that 45.5 people out of 100,000 had been diagnosed with <b>hypopituitarism,</b> with 4.2 new cases per year. 61% were due to tumors of the pituitary gland, 9% due to other types of lesions, and 19% due to other causes; in 11% no cause could be identified.|$|E
500|$|<b>Hypopituitarism</b> is the {{decreased}} (hypo) secretion {{of one or}} more of {{the eight}} hormones normally produced by the pituitary gland at the base of the brain. If there is decreased secretion of most pituitary hormones, the term panhypopituitarism (pan meaning [...] "all") is used.|$|E
2500|$|... the ACTH {{stimulation}} test, {{which is}} sometimes used {{to stimulate the}} production of aldosterone along with cortisol to determine whether primary or secondary adrenal insufficiency is present. However, ACTH has only a minor role in regulating aldosterone production; with <b>hypopituitarism</b> there is no atrophy of the zona glomerulosa.|$|E
2500|$|Prior to its {{production}} by recombinant DNA technology, growth hormone {{used to treat}} deficiencies was extracted from the pituitary glands of cadavers. [...] Attempts to create a wholly synthetic HGH failed. [...] Limited supplies of HGH resulted in the restriction of HGH therapy {{to the treatment of}} idiopathic short stature. [...] Very limited clinical studies of growth hormone derived from an Old World monkey, the rhesus macaque, were conducted by John C. Beck and colleagues in Montreal, in the late 1950s. The study published in 1957, which was conducted on [...] "a 13-year-old male with well-documented <b>hypopituitarism</b> secondary to a crainiophyaryngioma," [...] found that: [...] "Human and monkey growth hormone resulted in a significant enhancement of nitrogen storage... (and) there was a retention of potassium, phosphorus, calcium, and sodium.... There was a gain in body weight during both periods.... There was a significant increase in urinary excretion of aldosterone during both periods of administration of growth hormone. This was most marked with the human growth hormone.... Impairment of the glucose tolerance curve was evident after 10 days of administration of the human growth hormone. No change in glucose tolerance was demonstrable on the fifth day of administration of monkey growth hormone." [...] The other study, published in 1958, was conducted on six people: the same subject as the Science paper; an 18-year-old male with statural and sexual retardation and a skeletal age of between 13 and 14 years; a 15-year-old female with well-documented <b>hypopituitarism</b> secondary to a craniopharyngioma; a 53-year-old female with carcinoma of the breast and widespread skeletal metastases; [...] a 68-year-old female with advanced postmenopausal osteoporosis; and a healthy 24-year-old medical student without any clinical or laboratory evidence of systemic disease.|$|E
2500|$|PCS, which shares {{symptoms}} with {{a variety}} of other conditions, is highly likely to be misdiagnosed in people with these conditions. [...] Cognitive and affective symptoms that occur following a traumatic injury may be attributed to mTBI, but in fact be due to another factor such as post-traumatic stress disorder, which is easily misdiagnosed as PCS and vice versa. [...] Affective disorders such as depression have some symptoms that can mimic those of PCS and lead to a wrongful diagnosis of the latter; these include problems with concentration, emotional lability, anxiety, and sleep problems. Depression, which is highly common in persistent PCS, can worsen other PCS symptoms, such as headaches and problems with concentration, memory, and sleep. PCS also shares symptoms with chronic fatigue syndrome, fibromyalgia, and exposure to certain toxins. Traumatic brain injury may cause damage to the hypothalamus or the pituitary gland, and deficiencies of pituitary hormones (<b>hypopituitarism)</b> can cause similar symptoms to post-concussion syndrome; in these cases, symptoms can be treated by replacing any hormones that are deficient.|$|E
50|$|Sheehan's syndrome, {{also known}} as Simmond's syndrome, {{postpartum}} <b>hypopituitarism</b> or postpartum pituitary gland necrosis, is <b>hypopituitarism</b> (decreased functioning of the pituitary gland), caused by ischemic necrosis due to blood loss and hypovolemic shock during and after childbirth.|$|E
