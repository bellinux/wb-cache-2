5000|$|Shortly {{after the}} botched coup attempt of 15 July 2016, the Turkish {{government}} {{claimed that the}} coup attempt had been organized by Gülen and/or his movement. Turkish prime minister Binali Yıldırım in late July 2016 told The Guardian: [...] "Of course, since {{the leader of this}} terrorist organisation is residing in the United States, there are question marks {{in the minds of the}} people whether there is any U.S. involvement or backing. So America from this point on should really think how they will continue to cooperate with Turkey, which is a strategic ally for them in the region and world." [...] Gülen, who denied any involvement in the coup attempt and denounced it, has in turn accused Erdoğan of [...] "turning a failed putsch into a slow-motion coup of his own against constitutional government." [...] On 19 July, the Turkish prime minister stated that an official request had been sent to the U.S. for the extradition of Fethullah Gülen: “We have sent four dossiers to the United States for the extradition of the terrorist chief." [...] On the same day, the White House Press Secretary Josh Earnest said that president Obama had earlier in the day had a phone conversation with his Turkish counterpart and the [...] "status of Mr. Gülen was discussed on the call"; he further elaborated on the extradition issue: I can tell you that also <b>earlier</b> <b>this</b> <b>morning,</b> separate from the phone call, there were materials presented by the Turkish government in electronic form to the U.S. government related to Mr. Gülen's status. And the Department of Justice and the Department of State will review those materials, consistent with the requirements of the extradition treaty between the United States and Turkey that's been on the books for more than 30 years now. But the President also made clear a couple of other things. The first is that the United States doesn't support terrorists. The United States doesn't support individuals who conspire to overthrow democratically elected governments. The United States follows the rule of law. And as it relates to Mr. Gülen's status, there is a process that is established in the extradition treaty that we will follow. There also is due process to which people who live in the United States are entitled. And we'll make sure that that due process is followed as well. The decision about Mr. Gülen's status and the decision to extradite him is not a decision that is made by the President of the United States. It is a legal decision that is made pursuant to a legal process, part of which is codified in a longstanding treaty between the United States and Turkey. So that's the process that we'll follow. Again, I can't say definitively at this point that a formal request has been made. We're still reviewing the materials that were submitted by the Turkish government, and we'll do that consistent with the process that's been established both in U.S. law and in the extradition treaty between the United States and Turkey. At the end of July, the Turkish prime minister in his interview with The Wall Street Journal expressed frustration over the perceived lack of support on the part of the U.S. administration regarding the extradition request saying that the evidence against Gülen was [...] "crystal clear". On 4 August 2016, the U.S. State Department said it had received what would amount to a formal extradition request as well as documents purported to be the incriminating evidence and was [...] "in the process of going through those documents". According to senior U.S. officials, the evidence only pertained to certain alleged pre-coup criminal activity. On September 19, Turkish government officials met with retired Army Lt. General Mike Flynn, former CIA Director James Woolsey, and others to discuss legal and potentially illegal ways to take Gülen from the US to Turkey without going through the standard extradition process. In March 2017, Flynn registered as a foreign agent for his 2016 lobbying work on behalf of the government of Turkey.|$|E

40|$|The remarkably {{consistent}} unifying {{theme of}} this conference has been this one: can the methodology of modern analytical macroeconomics be used to address major questions about the goals and implementation of monetary policy? As Lawrence Christiano pointed out in his comments <b>earlier</b> <b>this</b> <b>morning,</b> it is amazing how similar are the tools, scientific methodology, and assumptions that each and every presenter has used. When the Bank of Japan (BOJ) created its two Honorary Adviser positions decades ago, the initial appointments were the warring prophets of Monetarism and Keynesianism, Milton Friedman and James Tobin. But I {{think it is fair}} to say that the three current and former Honorary Advisers present today—myself, Bennett T. McCallum, and John B. Taylor—share a fairly common framework for thinking about standard macro issues, even though Taylor and I happen to be in the line of descent from Tobin, whereas McCallum is a descendant of Friedman. That macro framework, as the papers we have discussed show, is increasingly eclectic and nondenominational. Its widespread acceptance testifies to the significant scientific progress that macroeconomists have made over the last three decades...|$|E
