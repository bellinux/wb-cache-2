25|$|Expanded-bed {{adsorption}} (EBA) chromatography is {{a convenient}} and effective technique for {{the capture of}} proteins directly from unclarified crude sample. In EBA chromatography, the settled bed is first expanded by upward flow of equilibration buffer. The crude feed, a mixture of soluble proteins, contaminants, cells, and cell debris, is then passed upward through the expanded bed. Target proteins are captured on the adsorbent, while particulates and contaminants pass through. A change to <b>elution</b> <b>buffer</b> while maintaining upward flow results in desorption of the target protein in expanded-bed mode. Alternatively, if the flow is reversed, the adsorbed particles will quickly settle and the proteins can be desorbed by an <b>elution</b> <b>buffer.</b> The mode used for elution (expanded-bed versus settled-bed) depends {{on the characteristics of}} the feed. After elution, the adsorbent is cleaned with a predefined cleaning-in-place (CIP) solution, with cleaning followed by either column regeneration (for further use) or storage.|$|E
25|$|A much quicker, single-step {{method of}} {{separation}} is protein A/G affinity chromatography. The antibody selectively binds to protein A/G, so {{a high level}} of purity (generally >80%) is obtained. However, this method may be problematic for antibodies that are easily damaged, as harsh conditions are generally used. A low pH can break the bonds to remove the antibody from the column. In addition to possibly affecting the product, low pH can cause protein A/G itself to leak off the column and appear in the eluted sample. Gentle <b>elution</b> <b>buffer</b> systems that employ high salt concentrations are available to avoid exposing sensitive antibodies to low pH. Cost is also an important consideration with this method because immobilized protein A/G is a more expensive resin.|$|E
25|$|To achieve maximum purity in {{a single}} step, {{affinity}} purification can be performed, using the antigen to provide specificity for the antibody. In this method, the antigen used to generate the antibody is covalently attached to an agarose support. If the antigen is a peptide, it is commonly synthesized with a terminal cysteine, which allows selective attachment to a carrier protein, such as KLH during development and to support purification. The antibody-containing media is then incubated with the immobilized antigen, either in batch or as the antibody is passed through a column, where it selectively binds and can be retained while impurities are washed away. An elution with a low pH buffer or a more gentle, high salt <b>elution</b> <b>buffer</b> is then used to recover purified antibody from the support.|$|E

We report on the optimization of native multi-lectin affinity chromatography, combining three lectins, namely, concanavalin A, jacalin, and wheat germ agglutinin for fractionation of cellular glycoproteins from MCF- 7 breast cancer lysate.

Zwitterionic and non-ionic detergents {{were used for the}} extraction of recombinant glycoprotein D (gD- 1) of herpes simplex virus type 1 (HSV- 1) from insect cells infected with recombinant baculovirus. The highest yield was obtained with the two alkyl carboxybetaine detergents (N-dodecyl-N,N-dimethylammonio) undecanoate [DDMAU, critical micelle concentration (CMC) = 0. 13 mM] and (N-dodecyl-N,N-dimethylammonio) butyrate (DDMAB, CMC= 4. 3 mM). Therefore these zwitterionic detergents were used as additives to the <b>elution</b> <b>buffers</b> in ion-exchange high-performance liquid chromatography (HPIEC) to purify gD- 1 of HSV- 1 from the extracts. The non-ionic detergent pentaethyleneglycol monodecyl ether (C(10) E(5)) that was used in earlier studies [R. A. Damhof, M. Feijlbrief, S. Welling-Wester: G,W Welling, J. Chromatogr. A, 676 (1994) 43] was used for comparison. Two columns were used, Mono Q and Resource Q, at 1 and 5 ml/min flow-rates, respectively. The results show that the detergents DDMAU and C(10) E(5) are superior to DDMAB, when the detergents were used as additives to the <b>elution</b> <b>buffers</b> at 0. 2 % (w/v). With 0. 2 % DDMAB in the eluent, purification of HSV gD- 1 was not possible. Detergents with a high CMC may be less suitable as additives in <b>elution</b> <b>buffers.</b> HPIEC at flow-rates of 1 and at 5 ml/min showed satisfactory results. At 5 ml/min HSV gD- 1 was mainly concentrated in two eluent fractions. The highest recovery of gD- 1 was obtained either by chromatography of a C(10) E(5) extract using a Mono Q column at a flow-rate of 1 ml/min or by chromatography of a DDMAU extract using a Resource Q column at a flow-rate of 5 ml/min.

40|$|Nucleic acid (NA) {{purification}} from clinical samples {{is commonly}} achieved using silica solid phase extraction {{in the presence}} of a chaotropic salt. Versions of these protocols have been adapted for point of care (POC) diagnostic devices in miniaturized platforms. Most such protocols require a high net amount of input NA, which is often achieved by adding exogenous carrier NA to the clinical sample. As a result, for samples containing less than 1 μg of total NA, NA recovery is low in the absence of carrier NA. Clinical samples used in POC diagnostics may contain very low NA concentrations (~ 1 ng/ml), which result in NA-limited interactions with the solid phase that are outside the dynamic range of POC diagnostics. This work is a study of DNA-silica interactions in the DNA-limiting regime to gain fundamental understanding of the mechanisms at play in order to increase the dynamic range and sensitivity of miniaturized NA based POC diagnostics. DNA adsorption and recovery from silica surfaces for concentrations less than 1 μg/ml are studied. A protocol was designed and developed to systematically quantify the adsorption of DNA onto a silica surface and the amount of DNA recovered by elution at very low concentrations. Various adsorption conditions were examined including a range of pH, different chaotropes, and DNA concentrations down to 2. 5 pg/ml. DNA recovery was further optimized for low concentration samples by varying <b>elution</b> <b>buffers.</b> DNA-silica adsorption was enhanced by low pH and was further improved by the presence of a chaotrope.

Versions of these protocols have been adapted for point of care (POC) diagnostic devices in miniaturized platforms, but commercial kits require a high amount of input DNA. Thus, when the input clinical sample contains less than 1 μg of total DNA, the target-specific DNA recovery from most of these protocols is low without supplementing the sample with exogenous carrier DNA. In fact, many clinical samples used in the development of POC diagnostics often exhibit target DNA concentrations as low as 3 ng/mL. With the broader goal of improving the yield and efficiency of nucleic acid-based POC devices for dilute samples, we investigated both DNA adsorption and recovery from silica particles by using 1 pg- 1 μg of DNA with a set of adsorption and <b>elution</b> <b>buffers</b> ranging in pH and chaotropic presence. In terms of adsorption, we found that low pH and the presence of chaotropic guanidinium thiocyanate (GuSCN) enhanced DNA-silica adsorption.

Unrecovered DNA was either not initially adsorbed or irreversibly bound on the silica surface.

In the present study this novel approach {{was applied to the}} purification of the integral membrane glycoprotein D of Herpes simplex virus types 1 and 2. The glycoproteins D of types 1 (gD- 1) and 2 (gD- 2) were cloned into the baculovirus expression system and produced in protein-free cultured insect cells. Detergent extracts of recombinant baculovirus-infected insect cells containing gD- 1 or gD- 2 were prepared using pentaethyleneglycol monodecyl ether, for extraction (final concentration 2 %, w/v). The same detergent was used as additive in the <b>elution</b> <b>buffers</b> for HPIEC on a Mono Q HR 5 / 5 column. At low (0. 005 %) detergent concentration, most of the proteins present in the extract including part of gD were eluted with the sodium chloride gradient whereas a subsequent blank run using the same gradient at higher detergent concentration (0. 1 %) resulted in selective elution of pure gD...|$|R
