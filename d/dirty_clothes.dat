5|$|The Dhumavati Tantra {{describes}} {{her as an}} old and ugly widow. She is thin, tall, unhealthy, and has a pale complexion. She is described as restless and wicked. Unadorned with jewellery, she wears old, <b>dirty</b> <b>clothes</b> and has dishevelled hair. Her eyes are fearsome, her nose long and crooked, {{and some of her}} long fang-like teeth have fallen out, leaving her smile with gaps. Her ears are ugly and rough; her breasts hang down. In one of her trembling hands, she holds a winnowing basket, while the other makes a boon-conferring gesture (varada-mudra) or knowledge-giving gesture (cinmudra). She rides in a horseless chariot bearing an emblem of a crow and a banner. She is astute and crafty, though. Always hungry and thirsty, Dhumavati initiates quarrels and invokes fear.|$|E
5|$|Clinicians {{assess the}} {{physical}} aspects {{such as the}} appearance of a patient, including apparent age, height, weight, and manner of dress and grooming. Colorful or bizarre clothing might suggest mania, while unkempt, <b>dirty</b> <b>clothes</b> might suggest schizophrenia or depression. If the patient appears much older than his or her chronological age this can suggest chronic poor self-care or ill-health. Clothing and accessories of a particular subculture, body modifications, or clothing not typical of the patient's gender, might give clues to personality. Observations of physical appearance might include the physical features of alcoholism or drug abuse, such as signs of malnutrition, nicotine stains, dental erosion, a rash around the mouth from inhalant abuse, or needle track marks from intravenous drug abuse. Observations can also include any odor which might suggest poor personal hygiene due to extreme self-neglect, or alcohol intoxication. Weight loss could also signify a depressive disorder, physical illness, anorexia nervosa or chronic anxiety.|$|E
5|$|Some time later, the Eds {{wake up in}} {{a trailer}} home, where three girls are staring down at them. The boys have already been changed out of their <b>dirty</b> <b>clothes</b> and put into clean robes, which the girls inform them each belong {{to one of their}} three {{respective}} dads. Explaining that they are new to the area, the girls introduce themselves as Lee (Janyse Jaud), Marie (Kathleen Barr) and May Kanker (Erin Fitzgerald). The Eds begin to offer their own introductions, but are stopped short by the sisters who are already familiar with the boys' names. As the Kankers head into the kitchen to prepare food for the Eds, Double D anxiously proposes that the three of them leave. However, Eddy stops him, insisting that they stay at least for the free food. Looking around, the boys notice drawings of themselves, each paired with one the Kankers: Ed with May, Double D with Marie, and Eddy with Lee. Although left unsettled by this discovery, they eagerly accept the food that is brought out to them and begin to relax, as the Kankers slip a movie into the VCR and go upstairs to freshen up.|$|E

25|$|The Ganga Action Plan, {{which was}} taken on {{priority}} and with much enthusiasm, was delayed for two years. The expenditure was almost doubled. But {{the result was}} not very appreciable. Much expenditure was done over the political propaganda. The concerning governments and the related agencies were not very prompt {{to make it a}} success. The public of the areas was not taken into consideration. The releasing of urban and industrial wastes in the river was not controlled fully. The flowing of dirty water through drains and sewers were not adequately diverted. The continuing customs of burning dead bodies, throwing carcasses, washing of <b>dirty</b> <b>clothes</b> by washermen, and immersion of idols and cattle wallowing were not checked. Very little provision of public latrines was made and the open defecation of lakhs of people continued along the riverside. All these made the Action Plan a failure.|$|E
25|$|Deadly Premonition is a {{survival}} horror game set {{in an open}} world environment and played from an over-the shoulder third-person perspective. The game's objective is to guide the player character, FBI Special Agent Francis York Morgan, as he investigates {{the identity of the}} Raincoat Killer, who is responsible for a murder in the rural town of Greenvale. York receives in-game money for numerous actions—both for finishing levels and for minor events, such as shaving or changing suits; he can also be fined for poor performance, such as wearing <b>dirty</b> <b>clothes.</b> Additionally, he requires food and sleep at regular intervals, as indicated by the gauges measuring his hunger and need for sleep. If his gauge for sleepiness reaches zero, he will become hungry more quickly; if his gauge for hunger depletes, he will begin to lose health. Sleeping restores his health and tiredness, while food and items to ward off sleepiness, such as coffee, can be purchased from stores in Greenvale.|$|E
500|$|Bharathiraja wanted Chithra Lakshmanan, {{who was an}} {{assistant}} director with K. Bhagyaraj, to sign Kamal Haasan {{for the role of}} Chappani, expecting to pay Kamal [...] since the actor had received [...] for Aayirathil Oruthi (1975). When Kamal asked for , Lakshmanan suggested that Bharathiraja offer the role to Sivakumar since the production unit could not afford Kamal's request; however, Bharathiraja saw Kamal as the ideal choice and agreed to pay him [...] For his character, the actor grew his curly hair long and wore lungis and khadi high-buttoned shirts. In 2017, Kamal recalled, [...] "Years ago, a man sporting a soiled dhoti and shirt came to my office to narrate a script. Had I turned the offer down {{on the basis of his}} <b>dirty</b> <b>clothes,</b> I wouldn’t have been here talking to you. After listening to the script, I realised that he was such a genius and the movie was the cult classic , and he was none other than ace Bharathiraja sir". Bharathiraja also recalled that he showed a [...] "handsome Kamal Haasan in an ugly way" [...] as he wanted to prove that characters need not always be attractive, and to break this stereotype in the film industry.|$|E
5000|$|Clean/dirty lockers {{normally}} {{have two or}} three parts within the locker. One part is meant for <b>dirty</b> or <b>clothes</b> that are worn, and the other side for clean clothes. These lockers are meant for hospitals or other medical workplaces where it is useful to keep work and personal clothes apart {{to reduce the risk of}} infection. These lockers are also useful for factories where work <b>clothes</b> can become <b>dirty</b> and it can be very useful to keep them apart from personal clothes.|$|R
50|$|Children {{under the}} age of Bar and Bat Mitzvah are {{generally}} included in the lighter mourning practices as training for mitzvah-observance. Thus, they will also refrain from listening to music or getting haircuts during the entire Three Weeks. However, young children who frequently soil or <b>dirty</b> their <b>clothes</b> are allowed to wear freshly washed clothes, and parents are allowed to launder those clothes for their children during the Nine Days. Similarly, children may bathe in warm water as frequently as necessary for basic hygiene.|$|R

2500|$|Recurrent {{humor is}} {{generated}} {{on the show}} by contrasting the 'squeaky-clean' habits of June and Ward with the 'grubby' ones of Wally and Beaver. While Ward and June stress cleanliness, bathing, and good grooming (ordering both boys to wash their faces, hands, and fingernails before dinner), both boys generally prefer being unwashed and dressed in <b>dirty</b> <b>clothes.</b> In the premiere episode, Wally and Beaver fake bathing by rumpling towels and tossing [...] "turtle dirt" [...] in the bathtub. In [...] "Cleaning Up Beaver", June and Ward commend Wally on his neat appearance and chide Beaver for his untidiness. When Wally calls Beaver a [...] "pig", Beaver moves into the guest room where he can be his own dirty, messy self without comment or criticism from others. Frightening shadows in the room force {{him back to his}} old bedroom and the safety of being with his brother. The two boys strike a middle ground: Beaver will be a bit tidier than he usually is and Wally will be a bit sloppier.|$|E
2500|$|In 1794, Caroline and the Prince of Wales were engaged. They {{had never}} met—George {{had agreed to}} marry her because he was heavily in debt, and if he {{contracted}} a marriage with an eligible princess, Parliament would increase his allowance. Caroline seemed eminently suitable: she was a Protestant of royal birth, and the marriage would ally Brunswick and Britain. Although Brunswick was only a small country, Britain was at war with revolutionary France so eager to obtain allies on the European mainland. Brunswick was ruled by Caroline's father, the esteemed soldier Charles William Ferdinand, Duke of Brunswick, who himself had married Princess Augusta, the sister of George III. On 20 November 1794, Lord Malmesbury arrived at Brunswick to escort Caroline to her new life in Britain. In his diary, Malmesbury recorded his reservations about Caroline's suitability as a bride for the prince: she lacked judgement, decorum and tact, spoke her mind too readily, acted indiscreetly, and often neglected to wash, or change her <b>dirty</b> <b>clothes.</b> He {{went on to say}} that she had [...] "some natural but no acquired morality, and no strong innate notions of its value and necessity." [...] However, Malmesbury was impressed by her bravery; on the journey to England, the party heard cannon fire, as they were not far from the French lines. While Caroline's mother, who was accompanying them to the coast as chaperone, was concerned for their safety, Caroline was unfazed.|$|E

60|$|The Bat's hut {{was larger}} than the rest and a rude veranda {{occupied}} the front. There was no furniture except some mats and stools, and a badly-cleaned paraffin lamp gave a dim light. The Bat sat on a carved stool and wore a striped tennis jacket over his <b>dirty</b> white <b>clothes.</b> His legs and feet were bare; his lips stuck out and his nostrils were wide, and Marston felt that to fear and shrink from him was ridiculous. Yet he did shrink. Then he noted with some surprise that Father Sebastian occupied a mat in the corner. Next moment the Bat looked up with a mocking grin.|$|R
60|$|There is that {{sketch of}} him in the Musée Carnavalet, drawn just before he, in his turn, went to expiate his crimes on that very guillotine, which he had {{sharpened}} and wielded so powerfully against his fellows. The artist has well caught the slouchy, slovenly look of his loosely knit figure, his long limbs and narrow head, with the snakelike eyes and slightly receding chin. Like Marat, his model and prototype, Merlin affected <b>dirty,</b> ragged <b>clothes.</b> The real Sanscullottism, the downward levelling of his fellowmen to the lowest rung of the social ladder, pervaded every action of this noted product of the great Revolution.|$|R

His expression was proud, apprehensive, and concentrated, {{like that of a}} small child entrusted {{for the first time with}} a box of matches and the permission to strike a light. But Mrs Verloc, gratified by her brother’s docility, recommended him not to <b>dirty</b> his <b>clothes</b> unduly in the country.

The miners were allowed to purchase alcoholic beverages only for personal consumption, thus preventing the public drunkenness that often ensued when groups of drinkers treated each other to rounds.
