5|$|MD 410's name becomes EastWest Highway {{again as}} it heads east from MD 650 as a four-lane {{undivided}} highway through {{the northern part}} of Chillum. The highway has frontage roads on either side of its crossing of Sligo Creek, then becomes divided ahead of its intersection with MD 212 (Riggs Road). MD 410 briefly has six lanes as it heads southeast to Ager Road, which leads toward the West Hyattsville Station on the Washington Metro's Green Line. MD 410 has a partial intersection with Ager Road; the missing movements between MD 410 and Ager Road are made via 23rd Avenue to the east. MD 410 crosses Northwest Branch Anacostia River and enters the city of Hyattsville. The highway expands to six lanes as it passes between The Mall at Prince George's and Prince George's Plaza Station on the Green Line. East of University Town Center and the headquarters of the National Center <b>for</b> <b>Health</b> <b>Statistics,</b> MD 410 has a four-way intersection with the northern end of MD 500 (Queens Chapel Road) and the southern end of Adelphi Road.|$|E

25|$|FI {{is thought}} to be very common, but much under-{{reported}} due to embarrassment. One study reported a prevalence of 2.2% in the general population. It affects people of all ages, but is more common in older adults (but it should not be considered a normal part of aging). Females are more likely to develop it than males (63% of those with FI over 30 may be female). In 2014, the National Center <b>for</b> <b>Health</b> <b>Statistics</b> reported that one out of every six seniors in the U.S. who lived in their own home or apartment had FI. Men and women were equally affected. 45–50% of people with FI have severe physical and/or mental disabilities.|$|E
25|$|Tables {{published}} by the government's National Center <b>for</b> <b>Health</b> <b>Statistics</b> show that life expectancy at birth was 47.3 years in 1900, rose to 68.2 by 1950 and reached 77.3 in 2002. The latest annual report of the Social Security Agency (SSA) trustees projects that life expectancy will increase just {{six years in the}} next seven decades, to 83 in 2075. A separate set of projections, by the Census Bureau, shows more rapid growth. The Census Bureau projection is that the longer life spans projected for 2075 by the Social Security Administration will be reached in 2050. Other experts, however, think that the past gains in life expectancy cannot be repeated, and add that the adverse effect on the system's finances may be partly offset if health improvements or reduced retirement benefits induce people to stay in the workforce longer.|$|E
25|$|The National Center <b>for</b> <b>Health</b> <b>Statistics</b> {{says that}} {{national}} birth rates for teenagers are at historic lows – during 2007–2010, teen birth rates fell 17% nationally;. West Virginia, however, ranked last with a 3% increase in birth rates for teenagers. A study by West Virginia's Marshall University showed that 19% of babies {{born in the}} state have evidence of drug or alcohol exposure. This is several times the national rate, where studies show that about 5.9% of pregnant women in the U.S. use illicit drugs, and about 8.5% consume any alcohol. An Institute for Health Policy Research study determined that mortality rates in Appalachia are correlated with coal production. In twenty West Virginia coal counties mining more than 1 million tons of coal per year and having a total population of 850,000, there are about 10,100 deaths per year, with 1,400 of those statistically attributed to deaths from heart, respiratory and kidney disease from living in an Appalachian coal county.|$|E

25|$|Births have {{declined}} for three consecutive years, {{and are now}} 7% below the peak in 2007. This drop has continued through 2010, according to data released by the U.S. National Center <b>for</b> <b>Health</b> <b>Statistics</b> in June 2011. Numerous experts have suggested that this decline is largely a reflection of unfavorable economic conditions. This connection between birth rates and economic downturns partly {{stems from the fact}} that American birth rates have now fallen to levels that are comparable to the Great Depression of the 1930s. Teen birth rates in the U.S. are at the lowest level in U.S. history. In fact, teen birth rates in the U.S. have consistently decreased since 1991 through 2011, except for a brief increase between 2005 and 2007. The other aberration from this otherwise steady decline in teen birth rates is the 6% decrease in birth rates for 15- to 19-year-olds between 2008 and 2009. Despite these years of decrease, U.S. teen birth rates are still higher than in other developed nations. Racial differences prevail with teen birth and pregnancy rates as well. The American Indian/Alaska Native, Hispanic, and non-Hispanic black teen pregnancy rates are more than double the non-Hispanic white teen birth rate.|$|E
500|$|The U.S. government's National Center <b>for</b> <b>Health</b> <b>Statistics</b> {{reported}} 33,736 {{motor vehicle}} traffic deaths in 2014. This exceeded {{the number of}} firearm deaths, which was 33,599 in 2014. According to another U.S. government office, the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration, motor vehicle crashes on U.S. roadways claimed 32,744 lives in 2014 and 35,092 in 2015. (The National Center <b>for</b> <b>Health</b> <b>Statistics</b> may have different criteria for inclusion or a slightly different methodology from the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration.) The National Highway Traffic Safety Administration report comparing 2015 to 2014 noted that fatalities increased from 2014 to 2015 in almost all segments of the population: passenger vehicle occupants, passengers of large trucks, pedestrians, pedalcyclists (commonly referred to as cyclists), motorcyclists, alcohol-impaired driving fatalities, male/female, daytime/nighttime. Fatalities of drivers of large trucks remained unchanged. The National Highway Traffic Safety Administration performed a regression analysis between monthly roadway fatalities and various possible explanatory variables over the five-year period 2011–2015. The strongest correlation was with vehicle miles traveled (VMT), which had a correlation of [...]80, followed by average monthly temperature, which had a correlation of [...]74, meaning that higher temperatures were associated with increased fatalities. Part {{of the reason for}} that pattern may be that more people are out walking and biking in the warmer months, and pedestrians and cyclists are often victims of collisions with motor vehicles. The report also suggests that there may be more vacation travel during warmer months. (It is not stated whether the analysis used annual vehicle miles traveled or monthly vehicle miles traveled.) Although not mentioned, motorcycle use, and therefore motorcyclist fatalities, may also increase in warmer months.|$|E
