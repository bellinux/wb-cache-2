40|$|The {{verification}} of digital intellectual property (IP) blocks {{has always been}} a challenge. Simple IP blocks with straightforward test inputs, can be quite thoroughly verified with software simulators such as Modelsim. But the {{verification of}} a complex System-on-Chip (SoC) on a software simulator can last days or even weeks, and that assumes that every IP on the SoC has a working simulation model. Although modern programmable chips can be monitored in real time with tools like Altera’s Signaltap II, they still only offer monitoring capabilities for a limited amount of signals and for a limited amount of time. To overcome this deficiency, IP <b>information</b> <b>registers</b> (IIR) were developed for this thesis. These registers are used to store information pertaining to the IPs and the SoC as a whole. The information can be static or dynamic, ie. generated before or during run-time. The information itself can be used for many different purposes along with the verification of single IPs or whole SoCs. The case study in this thesis has three parts where three of those purposes are examined with Terasic’s second generation development and education (DE 2) board. This physical platform was fitted with two systems, a 2 D graphics system embedded with <b>information</b> <b>registers</b> and a system to monitor the first one using these registers. The first part examined the identification aspects with static information whereas the second and third part examined the dynamic aspects of the <b>information</b> <b>registers</b> with their verification and optimization capabilities. Each of these aspects was deemed to offer a good service for developers designing digital circuits...|$|R

40|$|In recent years, {{the attack}} which leverages <b>register</b> <b>information</b> (e. g. {{accounts}} and passwords) leaked from 3 rd party applications to try other applications is popular and serious. We call this attack "database collision". Traditionally, {{people have to}} keep dozens of accounts and passwords for different applications to prevent this attack. In this paper, we propose a novel encryption scheme for hiding users' <b>register</b> <b>information</b> and preventing this attack. Specifically, we first hash the <b>register</b> <b>information</b> using existing safe hash function. Then the hash string is hidden, instead a coefficient vector is stored for verification. Coefficient vectors of the same <b>register</b> <b>information</b> are generated randomly for different applications. Hence, the original information is hardly cracked by dictionary based attack or database collision in practice. Using our encryption scheme, each user only needs to keep one password for dozens of applications...|$|R

The use of LDGM codes permits to efficiently exploit the intrinsic spatial correlation between the <b>information</b> <b>registered</b> by the sensors, whereas BCH codes are selected to lower the error floor due to the MAC ambiguity about the transmitted symbols. The new scheme significantly outperforms state-of-the-art coding schemes.|$|R
