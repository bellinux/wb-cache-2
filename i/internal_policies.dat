25|$|Bose {{was elected}} {{president}} of the Indian National Congress for two consecutive terms, but had to resign from the post following ideological conflicts with Mohandas K.

He established a separate political party, the All India Forward Bloc and continued to call for the full and immediate independence of India from British rule. He was imprisoned by the British authorities eleven times.|$|E
30|$|The {{instrumentation}} {{does not}} modify the original control flow of an app. It only replaces {{the targets of}} those calls to sensor-related API. The only potential attack surface incurred by the inserted code is that it introduce a new IPC channel to the original app. This IPC channel {{is used by the}} <b>internal</b> <b>Policy</b> Manager to get up-to-date control policies from external Policy Manager. Without considering potential bugs in Android’s IPC mechanism, the only possible way for a third-party app to attack the instrumented app through this IPC channel is to impersonate the external Policy Manager to the <b>internal</b> <b>Policy</b> Manager. But, with the help of Android IPC mechanism and PackageManager, the <b>internal</b> <b>Policy</b> Manager can verify the package name and signature of the connected external Policy Manager, which prevents the impersonation attack.|$|R

40|$|Recent {{scholarship}} on advisory systems has focussed on the externalization of advisory capacities and sectoral dynamics of change, whereas changes of <b>internal</b> <b>policy</b> advisory systems {{have not yet}} been approached systematically. This article proposes an analytical concept for exploring change dynamics in <b>internal</b> <b>policy</b> advisory systems by means of three logics for assessing policy advice (political salience, credibility and representativeness). The approach is illustrated by analysing changes within the <b>internal</b> <b>policy</b> advisory system of the German federal government (1990 – 2015). The analysis relies on three original datasets on ministerial departments, research agencies and governmental advisory bodies. We find that the internal advisory system of the German federal government is characterized by a differentiated hybridization of advisory logics, which has changed the nature of policy advice. This is a post-peer-review, pre-copyedit version of an article published in Policy Sciences. The final authenticated version is available online at: [URL]...|$|R
25|$|Hoxha's <b>internal</b> <b>policies</b> {{were true}} to Stalin's {{paradigm}} which he admired, and the personality cult {{developed in the}} 1970s organized around him by the Party also bore {{a striking resemblance to}} that of Stalin. At times it even reached an intensity similar to the personality cult surrounding Kim Il-sung (which Hoxha condemned) with Hoxha being portrayed as a genius commenting on virtually all facets of life from culture to economics to military matters. Each schoolbook required one or more quotations from him on the subjects being studied. The Party honored him with titles such as Supreme Comrade, Sole Force and Great Teacher.|$|E
25|$|In recent years, {{the number}} of female {{circular}} migrants has increased rapidly. In {{the second half of}} the nineteenth century, South Africa's <b>internal</b> <b>policies</b> only permitted men to legally migrate to the city. This influx control was lifted in 1986, thus paving the way for women to begin migrating to urban areas. However, the change first affected permanent migration patterns, as female circular migration did not begin to increase substantially until over a decade later, mostly due to changing economic conditions. Overall, mobility in South Africa is high and continues to grow, as circular migration is carried out to look for work and raise children in areas with better schools.|$|E
25|$|The Government of Denmark {{operates}} as a cabinet government, where executive authority is exercised—formally, {{on behalf of the}} Monarch—by Prime Minister and other cabinet ministers, who head ministries. As the executive branch, the Cabinet is responsible for proposing bills and a budget, executing the laws, and guiding the foreign and <b>internal</b> <b>policies</b> of Denmark. The position of prime minister belongs to the person most likely to command the confidence of a majority in the Folketing; this is usually the current leader of the largest political party or, more effectively, through a coalition of parties. A single party generally does not have sufficient political power {{in terms of the number}} of seats to form a cabinet on its own; Denmark has often been ruled by coalition governments, themselves sometimes minority governments dependent on non-government parties.|$|E

25|$|Unlike the First Empire, the {{administration}} during the Second Bulgarian Empire was {{heavily influenced by}} the Byzantine system of administration. Most of the titles of the nobility, the court, and {{the administration}} were directly adopted from their Byzantine counterparts in Byzantine Greek, or were translated into Bulgarian. There were some differences in the ranking systems between the two countries—there are few surviving sources about the precise obligations, insignia, or ceremonial affairs of the medieval Bulgarian administration. The Bolyar Council included the greater bolyars and the Patriarch; it discussed issues about external and <b>internal</b> <b>policies,</b> such as declarations of war, formations of alliances, or the signing of peace treaties. The highest-ranking administrative officials were the great logothete, who had the functions of a first minister, and the protovestiarios, {{who was responsible for}} the treasury and finance. High court titles such as despot and sebastokrator were awarded to the Emperor's relatives but were not strictly concerned with administrative functions.|$|E
25|$|The 1971 war and {{separation}} of East-Pakistan demoralized and shattered the nation. President General Yahya Khan {{handed over the}} political power to Zulfikar Ali Bhutto of the Pakistan Peoples Party. With PPP's coming to power, the democratic socialists and visionaries came to the power {{for the first time}} in the country's history, under a democratic transition. Bhutto made critical decision after dismissing chiefs of army, navy and the air force while authorized home confinement orders for General Yahya Khan and several of his collaborators. He adopted the East-Pakistan Commission's recommendations and authorized large-scale court-martial of army officers tainted for their role in East Pakistan. To keep the country united, Bhutto launched a series of internal intelligence operations to crack down on the fissiparous nationalist sentiments and movements in the provinces. Proponents of socialism were supported as part of the <b>internal</b> <b>policies</b> and the PPP faced serious challenges, both on internal and foreign fronts.|$|E
