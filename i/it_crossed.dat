5|$|By 26 March, {{an area of}} {{disturbed}} {{weather was}} located within the near-equatorial trough near Papua New Guinea. Initially located within an area of easterly wind shear, it tracked westward due {{to the presence of}} a ridge to its south, and on 27 March a low pressure area formed over Western New Guinea. Thunderstorm activity increased around a mid-level circulation as <b>it</b> <b>crossed</b> into the Arafura Sea, and its overall organisation continued to increase. On 29 March, a low-level circulation was visible, though significant tropical development was prevented due to wind shear and land interaction with islands in the Indonesian archipelago. It developed into a tropical low on 30 March, and after turning to the southwest, <b>it</b> <b>crossed</b> the island of Flores on 31 March; upon doing so its convection greatly increased due to increased upper-level divergence, which produced heavy rainfall on Flores and Timor. On 1 April, wind shear decreased as <b>it</b> <b>crossed</b> into the Savu Sea, and by early on 1 April it developed into a tropical cyclone to the northeast of Sumba.|$|E
5|$|Early on October 25, Hurricane Fox {{entered the}} Atlantic Ocean. <b>It</b> <b>crossed</b> central Andros and turned east across the Bahamas. On October 26, the {{hurricane}} briefly re-intensified as <b>it</b> <b>crossed</b> Cat Island. The center became ill-defined, and the cyclone quickly weakened. It turned north {{and then took}} an erratic northeast turn as it weakened to a tropical storm on October 27. The system gained extratropical characteristics as it merged with a polar frontal boundary, and it dissipated west-southwest of Bermuda on October 28.|$|E
5|$|Highway74 {{began at}} an {{intersection}} with Highway3 {{in the community}} of New Sarum, midway between the city of St. Thomas to the west, and the town of Aylmer to the east. <b>It</b> <b>crossed</b> the St. Thomas and Eastern Railway just north of Highway3 before curving to cross the West Catfish Creek, which it meandered alongside into Mapleton. Immediately north of that community, the route curved to the north and was straight for the remainder of its route. The highway continued, entering the village of Belmont, where it intersected a Canadian Pacific Railway line. North of there <b>it</b> <b>crossed</b> the boundary between Elgin County to the south and Middlesex County to the north. North of the county line, Highway74 continued into the community of Derwent. Shortly thereafter, <b>it</b> <b>crossed</b> and interchanged with Highway401 at Exit195. The highway ended just north of Highway401 in Nilestown at an intersection with Middlesex County Road29 (Hamilton Road).|$|E

5|$|A {{significant}} tropical wave {{with very}} little deep convection left Africa on July 22. <b>It</b> <b>crossed</b> the Atlantic, with convection associated with its southern part passing over the Windward Islands on July 28 and crossing Central America on July 31.|$|E
5|$|A {{tropical}} wave emerged off {{the western}} coast of Africa on July10. Once {{north of the}} Greater Antilles, convective growth {{and the development of}} a well-defined surface low led to the formation of a tropical depression just south of Acklins Island by 06:00UTC on July22. Amid a brief reprieve in strong upper-level winds, the depression intensified into Tropical Storm Bonnie as <b>it</b> <b>crossed</b> Ragged Island around 23:15UTC that day. It later traversed Andros Island at peak intensity, with sustained winds of 45mph (75km/h), and weakened slightly before moving ashore near Elliott Key, Florida, with winds of 40mph (65km/h) on July23. Bonnie weakened to a tropical depression as <b>it</b> <b>crossed</b> South Florida, and the persistent effects of strong wind shear prevented intensification in the Gulf of Mexico. The cyclone degenerated into a remnant low by 00:00UTC on July25 and later moved into southeastern Louisiana before dissipating later that day.|$|E

The storm tracked generally westward for much of its duration, and on December 7 <b>it</b> <b>crossed</b> into the western Pacific Ocean. Much of its track was characterized by fluctuations in intensity, and on December 10 the cyclone attained typhoon status as <b>it</b> <b>crossed</b> the Marshall Islands. On December 16, Paka struck Guam and Rota with winds of 230km/h (145mph), and it strengthened further to reach peak winds on December 18 over open waters. Subsequently, it underwent a steady weakening trend, and on December 23 Paka dissipated.|$|E
