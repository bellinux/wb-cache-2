25|$|Prioritizing a fast {{production}} of weapon-grade material regardless of secrecy: The {{fastest way to}} produce weapon usable material was seen in modifying a prior civil fusion power station. Unlike in some nuclear power stations, there is no weapon compatible material during civil use. Even {{without the need for}} covert action this modification would still take about 2 months to start the production and at least an additional week to generate a significant amount for weapon production. This was seen as enough time to detect a military use and to react with diplomatic or military means. To stop the production, a military destruction of inevitable parts of the facility leaving out the reactor itself would be sufficient. This, together with the <b>intrinsic</b> <b>safety</b> of fusion power would only bear a low risk of radioactive contamination.|$|E

40|$|Picking time {{reduction}} {{has been}} the traditional perspective for warehouse optimization. When structural safety is considered, optimization of warehouse operations should be read even in terms of load mass distribution. In many practical cases the static safety {{of the system is}} related to mass distribution and barycenter highness, for example when a vehicle hits the structure or even in the extreme case of an earthquake. To investigate the problem a simulation model is developed with AutoMod™ software. The model developed simulates a generalized AS/RS warehouse where the single physical location is managed. To evaluated the performances of the AS/RS a simulation experiment is completed.

Detailed analysis of the resulting data, which included value sketches, written value scenarios, and semistructured discussion, led to specific design opportunities, related to values (e. g., supporting trust and desire to help others), function (e. g., documenting harms for future purposes), and form (e. g., leveraging social expectations for how mobile phones can be used to influence behavior).

40|$|Unfractionated heparin (UFH) {{has been}} used as an {{antithrombotic}} agent in the treatment of various clinical entities for over 60 years. Low-molecular-weight heparin (LMWH) com- pounds have gradually replaced UFH for these indications as they have several advantages, including subcutaneous administration and the lack of need for laboratory monitoring.

The best answer is given by direct comparison of two or more preparations; however, such trials are very scarce. Comparison using classical meta-analysis is limited as {{only a small number of}} trials with the respective low-molecular-weight heparin compounds are available. The objective of the present analysis has been to use a novel way of plotting the odds ratios of the different studies to compare the efficacy and safety of different LMWH compounds in the initial treatment of patients with venous thromboembolism.

JICF configurations are used in practical applications where high mixing rates are desirable between the jet and the cross-flow fluids such as fuel injection nozzles and dilution holes in gas turbine combustors. This study examines a nitrogen-diluted hydrogen transverse jet exiting a square nozzle perpendicularly into a cross-flow of heated air. Improved understanding of the flame stabilization mechanism acting downstream of the transverse fuel jet will enable the formulation of more reliable guidelines for design of fuel injection nozzles which promote <b>intrinsic</b> flashback <b>safety</b> by reducing {{the likelihood of the}} flame anchoring at the injection site. The core of the heat release is located near the trailing edge of the fuel jet, at approximately 4 nozzle diameters away from the wall, and is characterized by the simultaneous occurrence of locally stoichiometric reactants and low flow velocities in the mean.

The above mentioned parameters were investigated without any substantial changes to drug treatment during a check-up subsequent to VNS activation [mean: 7. 7 months].
