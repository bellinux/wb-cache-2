5|$|The appellants {{contended that}} Minister had fettered his {{discretion}} when making Order 123. They alleged that publications had been banned {{because of the}} <b>deregistration</b> of the Jehovah's Witnesses and not because Minister had been satisfied of their undesirability.|$|E
5|$|In Thio Li-ann's view, {{it appears}} that the High Court allowed the matter to be decided {{according}} to the subjective discretion of the Minister. The only explanation given for <b>deregistration</b> was that the Jehovah's Witnesses' refusal to perform national service was contrary to the public interest. The Court did not require the executive to elaborate on exactly how a failure to perform national service would be contrary to public interest. It accepted the executive's discretion to derogate a fundamental right without a close scrutiny of the executive's rationale and explanations.|$|E
5|$|The High Court {{also held}} that the orders were neither irrational nor disproportionate. The order banning all WTBTS {{publications}} was reasonable {{as it would be}} administratively impossible to monitor any order other than a blanket ban. As for the <b>deregistration</b> order, the Court accepted that the Jehovah's Witnesses' refusal to perform national service prejudiced national security, and was thus appropriately issued in the interest of public order. The Court noted that Singapore's administrative law does not recognize proportionality as a distinct ground of judicial review.|$|E

5|$|The appellants {{contended that}} under Article 15(4) of the Constitution {{restrictions}} {{on the right of}} freedom of religion could be imposed only if public order, public health or morality is affected, and section 24(1)(a) of the SA provides for registered organizations to be dissolved only if they threaten public peace, welfare or good order. The appellants therefore submitted that {{there had to be a}} clear and immediate danger to public order before freedom of religion can be circumscribed. Since the activities of Jehovah's Witnesses posed no such threat, the <b>deregistration</b> order was unconstitutional and ultra vires the SA.|$|E
5|$|In Chan Hiang Leng Colin v. Public Prosecutor (1994), the Minister of Home Affairs had deregistered the Jehovah's Witnesses by Order No. 179/1972 made {{pursuant}} to section 24(1)(a) of the Societies Act. This provision {{allows for the}} dissolution of registered organizations considered to be threats to public peace, welfare or good order. The Minister had also made Order No. 123/1972 and Order No. 405/1994 {{pursuant to}} section 3(1) of the Undesirable Publications Act, prohibiting publications by the Watch Tower Bible and Tract Society relating to the Jehovah's Witnesses. The appellants were convicted in a district court for possession of prohibited publications. They appealed and sought to challenge {{the constitutionality of the}} Minister's prohibition order and the <b>deregistration</b> of the Jehovah's Witnesses, arguing that their right to freedom of religion guaranteed by Article 15(1) of the Constitution had been infringed.|$|E
25|$|Throughout Australia, {{there is}} a Player and Official <b>Deregistration</b> Policy, which allows players and {{officials}} with a poor tribunal record to be deregistered from playing football for life. As of 2011, this <b>deregistration</b> is automatically applied to any player or official who, {{since the age of}} 16, has been suspended for a cumulative total of 16 matches or more in any suburban, country or state league, or in the AFL, except that for the purpose of the cumulative total, suspensions in the AFL count only 50% of their value. Players may appeal for re-registration, but if successful a further suspension will result in <b>deregistration</b> without the right to a further appeal. The rule was first established in 2007, and is applied uniformly across all levels of football in Australia.|$|E
50|$|From April 2010, the COE quota {{calculation}} was amended. Under the new methodology, the Land Transport Authority (LTA) recycles the COE quota {{from the}} actual vehicle <b>deregistrations</b> {{in the most recent}} six-month period back into the system. Instead of an annual quota, figures will be revised every six months. For example, there are 800,000 vehicles as of January. Based on the allowable growth rate of 1.5 percent, there will be an additional 6000 COEs for sale every six months. On top of the number of vehicles deregistered in the same period (for example, 20,000) this means the COE quota for July to December will be 26,000.|$|R
40|$|We {{examine a}} {{comprehensive}} sample of going-dark <b>deregistrations</b> where companies cease SEC reporting, but continue to trade publicly. We document {{a spike in}} going dark that is largely attributable to the Sarbanes-Oxley Act. Firms experience large negative abnormal returns when going dark. We find that many firms go dark due to poor future prospects, distress and increased compliance costs after SOX. But we also find evidence suggesting that controlling insiders take their firms dark to protect private control benefits and decrease outside scrutiny, particularly when governance and investor protection are weak. Finally, we show that going dark and going private are distinct economic events. ...|$|R
40|$|The early 1990 s saw {{concerns}} about entrepreneurship and {{the publication of}} spatially disaggregated VAT data generate a burst of studies of UK firm formation, and ultimately Scotland's "business birth rate strategy". We use twenty years of county VAT data to revisit the evidence on entrepreneurship and assess its policy implications. By investigating the relationships between registrations, <b>deregistrations</b> and population density the analysis shows that a strategy aimed at the net birth rate might, in principle, be just as effective in achieving its objective if aimed at reducing the death rate, rather than raising the birth rate. Indeed {{it might be more}} efficient, since it implies less start-ups that are 'wasted'. By this we mean the necessity, if targets are to be reached, to encourage those individuals who are patently unsuited to running their own business into business ownership. Recent attempts to unite the enterprise and social exclusion agendas In the early 1990 s {{concerns about}} entrepreneurship and the first publication of spatially disaggregated VAT data combined to stimulate a burst of studies on the regional variations of firm formation in the UK and Ireland (see Keeble and Parker, 1994; Hart e...|$|R

25|$|Designed with a ductile steel frame, the {{building}} was {{to go up in}} record time. Construction commenced in 1974 but was held up for around nine years {{as a result of a}} political standoff between the Muldoon government and the Boilermakers Union.

The building was eventually completed in 1984 and now stands as a striking landmark on the Wellington CBD skyline.|$|E
25|$|The NTUC {{was created}} in 1961 when the Singapore Trades Union Congress (STUC), which had backed the People's Action Party (PAP) in its {{successful}} drive for self-government, split into the pro-PAP NTUC and the leftist Singapore Association of Trade Unions (SATU). The SATU collapsed in 1963 following the government's detention of its leaders during Operation Coldstore and its subsequent official <b>deregistration</b> on 13 November 1963, leaving the NTUC as the sole trade union centre. Presently, over 98% of union members are in unions affiliated with the NTUC.|$|E
40|$|Abstract {{copyright}} UK Data Service {{and data}} collection copyright owner. The aims of the study are: (i) to identify the key characteristics of (a) a sample of newly formed Northern businesses; and (b) the founders of those businesses; (ii) to track the perceptions founders have, at different points {{during the first two}} years of life, of likely business prospects over a range of time horizons; (iii) to track the actual development of the businesses in their first two years in such a way that the perceptions identified in (ii) can be compared with what actually happened; (iv) to analyse the relationship between the key characteristics of the sample businesses and their founders identified in (i) and: (a) the perceptions identified in (ii); (b) the actual development identified in (iii); and (c) the gap between perceptions and outcomes; (v) to analyses the determinants of changes in relationship between perceptions and actual outcomes. Main Topics : The key characteristics of the respondents and their businesses were analysed. Information was provided on such variables as sectoral breakdown, employment growth, markets, competition, difficulties, challenges, financing and assistance from external agencies. Questions relating to respondents focused on educational, social and economic background including work experience. The project also looked at how small businesses change and develop over time. At each interview stage respondents' perceptions of future business prospects over different time horizons were elicited. These periods coincided with planned subsequent interviews which would facilitate comparison of forecasts with actual outcomes. Although the study mainly addressed the issues of survival, employment, turnover and product mix, respondents were also asked about likely future changes in a number of other aspects of business activity and organisation. Various investigative techniques such as regression, logit analysis and some parametric and non-parametric tests were used to analyse the dataset. The dataset also provided the means to examine whether the survey firms improved their forecasting ability between the first and second two six month periods. Some insight was also provided into the nature of VAT data on registration and <b>deregistrations.</b> In particular, the opportunity was provided to examine, firstly, the extent to which registrants are involved in setting up entirely new businesses and secondly, the relationship between the date of registration and the start of trading. The depositor states The results suggested that some caution should be exercised in the use of VAT registration statistics in the analysis of firm births...|$|R

25|$|When the Labour Party {{was taken}} over by Chinese-educated members with more leftist views—eventually leading to the party's <b>deregistration</b> by the government, Tan left the party to form Gerakan, with the {{objective}} of attracting Malays away from race-based parties such as the United Malays National Organisation (UMNO), a major party in the Alliance catering to the Malay majority of the population. Gerakan, together with the Democratic Action Party (DAP) which took similar stances to Gerakan, were very successful in the 1969 general elections, and appeared {{to be on the verge}} of denying the Alliance the 2/3 Parliamentary majority required to amend the Constitution. In Selangor, Tan's home state, the State Assembly was tied between Alliance and opposition assemblymen.|$|E

The by-election for the new mayor was contested by 10 candidates including Labour's John Biggs, Andy Erlam representating Red Flag Anti-Corruption, and Rabina Khan who was elected as a councillor representating Tower Hamlets First in the 2014 election. Khan, who received the backing of Rahman, stood as an independent following the <b>deregistration</b> of Tower Hamlets First.

25|$|The {{perceived}} lack {{of implementation}} of successful referendums {{has led to}} calls for such referendums to be made binding on {{the government of the}} day, similar to the direct democracy said to exist in Switzerland. ACT New Zealand, Family First New Zealand, the Sensible Sentencing Trust and Kiwi Party all advocate binding referendums. However, Kiwi Party President Larry Baldock failed to submit enough signatures for a petition that might have led to a non-binding referendum on whether or not binding citizens referenda should be introduced after being granted permission to circulate a petition calling for that innovation, so the status quo remains. Although the Kiwi Party applied for <b>deregistration,</b> the cause has been taken up by the Conservative Party of New Zealand and its leader, Colin Craig.|$|E
25|$|A {{prolonged}} thirteen-year {{political and}} legal battle, Figueroa v. Canada ensued, which won the support of widespread popular opinion, reflected {{in a number of}} members of parliament openly supporting the challenge and other small political parties joining the case, most notably the Green Party. Never before had a single court challenge resulted in legislative action on three separate occasions to amend a standing law. Bill C-2 (2000) amended the Canada Elections Act to (among other things) remove the unconstitutional seizure of party assets for failure to field 50 candidates in a general election and provided for the full refund of candidates’ deposits. The party had its <b>deregistration</b> overturned and its seized assets restored. Bill C-9 (2001) reduced the threshold from 50 to 12 candidates for the party identifier to appear on the ballot. Bill C-3 (2003) scrapped the 50-candidate rule altogether for party registration. This victory was celebrated by many of the other small parties – regardless of political differences – on the principle that it was a victory for the people's right to democratic choice.|$|E
500|$|One of the {{submissions}} {{raised by}} the appellants was that the prohibition and <b>deregistration</b> orders were made in breach of the natural justice principle of audi alteram partem, or [...] "hear the other side". This {{is regarded as a}} cardinal principle of natural justice, requiring that no person shall be condemned unless he or she has been given prior notice of the allegations against him or her and a fair opportunity to be heard. In general, Article 12(1) of the Constitution protects rights such as this. Audi alteram partem has been referred to by the Court of Appeal as one of the two rules that make up the administrative law rules of natural justice, the other being nemo iudex in causa sua ("no man a judge in his own cause").|$|E
