2500|$|A loose form of rent {{regulation}} {{was introduced}} {{under the name}} of [...] "Vergleichmieten" [...] ('comparable rents'), together with the provision of [...] "for family-friendly housing" [...] freight or rent subsidies to owners of apartments or houses whose ceiling had been adapted to increased expenses or incomes (1970). In addition, a law for the creation of property for workers was passed, under which a married worker would normally keep up to 95% of his pay, and <b>graded</b> <b>tax</b> remission for married wage-earners applied up to a wage of 48,000 marks, which indicated the economic prosperity of West Germany at that time. The Town Planning Act (1971) encouraged the preservation of historical heritage and helped open up the way to the future of many German cities, while the Urban Renewal Act (1971) helped the states to restore their inner cities and to develop new neighbourhoods. In addition, gGuidelines of December 1972 on the usage of federal funds in assisting social housing construction laid down that a certain standard needed to be observed when building homes for severely handicapped persons.|$|E

50|$|In the UK during 1909, the Liberal Government {{included}} a land tax {{as part of}} several taxes in the People's Budget intended to redistribute wealth (including a progressively <b>graded</b> income <b>tax</b> and an increase of inheritance tax). This caused a crisis which resulted indirectly in reform of the House of Lords. The budget was passed eventually—but without the land tax. During 1931, the minority Labour Government passed a land value tax as part III of the 1931 Finance act. However, this was repealed during 1934 by the National Government {{before it could be}} implemented.|$|R

40|$|Legislation in 22 states allows {{qualified}} {{high school}} students to enroll simultaneously {{in high school and college}} courses. Known as dual enrollment, the law varies in its details from state to state, but all versions contain similar core elements. This legislation sup-ports a student’s need to move beyond the 12 th-grade curriculum while still enrolled in high school, and thus, by inference, pro-vides a justification for sequential content acceleration through-out K– 12. It also surfaces several important, though controver-sial, issues: shifting control for educational decisions, awarding course credit and <b>grades,</b> and reallocating <b>tax</b> dollars for tuition. Factors in developing a student’s K– 16 seamless transition are considered. Acceleration is a well-researched, desirable option that improves achievement for gifted students (Benbow & Lupinski, 1996). Yet, it is rarely a solution chosen by schools (Jones & Southern, 1989).

5000|$|Taxes levied {{on local}} {{populations in the}} wake of early Islamic conquests could be of three types, based on whether they were levied on individuals, on the land, or as {{collective}} tribute. During the first century of Islamic expansion, the words jizya and kharaj were used in all these three senses, with context distinguishing between individual and land taxes ("kharaj on the head", [...] "jizya on land", and vice versa). In the words of Dennett, [...] "since we are talking in terms of history, not in terms of philology, the problem is not what the taxes were called, but what we know they were." [...] Regional variations in taxation at first reflected the diversity of previous systems. The Sasanian Empire had a general tax on land and a poll tax having several rates based on wealth, with an exemption for aristocracy. In Iraq, which was conquered mainly by force, Arabs controlled taxation through local administrators, keeping the <b>graded</b> poll <b>tax,</b> and likely increasing its rates to 1, 2 and 4 dinars. The aristocracy exemption was assumed by the new Arab-Muslim elite and shared by local aristocracy by means of conversion. The nature of Byzantine taxation remains partly unclear, but it appears to have involved taxes computed in proportion to agricultural production or number of working inhabitants in population centers. In Syria and upper Mesopotamia, which largely surrendered under treaties, taxes were calculated in proportion to the number of inhabitants at a fixed rate (generally 1 dinar per head). They were levied as collective tribute in population centers which preserved their autonomy and as a personal tax on large abandoned estates, often paid by peasants in produce. In post-conquest Egypt, most communities were taxed using a system which combined a land tax with a poll tax of 2 dinars per head. Collection of both was delegated to the community on the condition that the burden be divided among its members in the most equitable manner. In most of Iran and Central Asia local rulers paid a fixed tribute and maintained their autonomy in tax collection, using the Sasanian dual tax system in regions like Khorasan.|$|R
40|$|The {{transition}} to a low carbon transport world requires a host of demand and supply policies to be developed and deployed. Pricing and taxation of vehicle ownership plays a major role, as it affects purchasing behavior, overall ownership and use of vehicles. There is a lack in robust assessments {{of the life cycle}} energy and environmental effects of a number of key car pricing and taxation instruments, including <b>graded</b> purchase <b>taxes,</b> vehicle excise duties and vehicle scrappage incentives. This paper aims to fill this gap by exploring which type of vehicle taxation accelerates fuel, technology and purchasing behavioral transitions the fastest with (i) most tailpipe and life cycle greenhouse gas emissions savings, (ii) potential revenue neutrality for the Treasury and (iii) no adverse effects on car ownership and use. The UK Transport Carbon Model was developed further and used to assess long term scenarios of low carbon fiscal policies and their effects on transport demand, vehicle stock evolution, life cycle greenhouse gas emissions in the UK. The modeling results suggest that policy choice, design and timing can play crucial roles in meeting multiple policy goals. Both CO 2 grading and tightening of CO 2 limits over time are crucial in achieving the {{transition to}} low carbon mobility. Of the policy scenarios investigated here the more ambitious and complex car purchase tax and feebate policies are most effective in accelerating low carbon technology uptake, reducing life cycle greenhouse gas emissions and, if designed carefully, can avoid overburdening consumers with ever more taxation whilst ensuring revenue neutrality. Highly graduated road taxes (or VED) can also be successful in reducing emissions; but while they can provide handy revenue streams to governments that could be recycled in accompanying low carbon measures they are likely to face opposition by the driving population and car lobby groups. Scrappage schemes are found to save little carbon and may even increase emissions on a life cycle basis. The main policy implication of this work is that in order to reduce both direct and indirect greenhouse gas emissions from transport governments should focus on designing incentive schemes with strong up-front price signals that reward 'low carbon' and penalize 'high carbon'. Policy instruments should also be subject to early scrutiny of the longer term impacts on government revenue and pay attention to the need for flanking policies to boost these revenues and maintain the marginal cost of driving...|$|R
40|$|LVT (Land Value Tax), {{unlike other}} taxes, causes no distortions in {{economic}} decision-making and therefore does not compromise {{the efficiency of}} a market economy. While there have been various challenges to this conclusion, {{it seems that the}} neutrality of LVT has been proven in the literature. Although it has been established conceptually that LVT is non-distortive, it is important to empirically test the effects of LVT reform in diverse aspects. Unlike other studies, this dissertation examines the economic, spatial, and welfare effects of LVT reform in a second-best situation employing an urban (and spatial) CGE (Computable General Equilibrium) model. In addition, it examines the distributional effects among different income groups and the short-term aspects of LVT as well. The feature that the present dissertation incorporates as the second-best situation includes LLZ (Large Lot Zoning). The computation and the assumptions about parameters for the current CGE model are made based on demographic, physical, and economic features of the Atlanta urban area in Georgia. The results suggest the following: (1) LVT reform is economically feasible, (2) the tax on land rent stabilizes prices and contracts the CBD (Central Business District) and urban boundary in the economy where the CBD and urban area are endogenously determined, while the tax on land rent is purely neutral in the economy where the CBD and urban area are fixed, (3) LVT reform increases the money-metric welfare of residents by about 20 % of the tax revenue in the economy where residents are landowners, while LVT reform increases the money-metric welfare of residents by about 45 % of the tax revenue in the economy where the lands are owned by absentee, (4) LVT reform more increases the money-metric welfare of the less-income groups that own the smaller land area, which is contrary to the case of LLZ, (5) LLZ and property tax can cause the sprawl of an urban area, but at a very low elasticity of substitution between land and the other factors (0. 1), even switching from the land tax to the property <b>tax</b> (or <b>graded</b> property <b>tax)</b> can contract the urban area, (6) LLZ, in the long-term during which housing capital and urban boundary are not fixed and in the economy where residents are landowners, can improve the welfare of households, while LLZ worsens the welfare of households both in the economy where the lands are owned by absentee and in the short-term during which housing capital is immobile in any economy, (7) When we consider that housing capital is immobile, the increase in the money-metric welfare due to LVT reform becomes weak, compared to the case with perfectly mobile housing capital...|$|R
