40|$|International audienceAbstractBackgroundGenomic best linear {{unbiased}} prediction (GBLUP) is {{a statistical}} method {{used to predict}} breeding values using single nucleotide polymorphisms for selection in animal and plant breeding. Genetic effects are often modeled as additively acting marker allele effects. However, the actual mode of biological action can differ from this assumption. Many livestock traits exhibit genomic imprinting, which may substantially contribute to the total genetic variation of quantitative traits. Here, we present two statistical models of GBLUP including imprinting effects (GBLUP-I) {{on the basis of}} genotypic values (GBLUP-I 1) and gametic values (GBLUP-I 2). The performance of these models for the estimation of variance components and prediction of <b>genetic</b> <b>values</b> across a range of genetic variations was evaluated in simulations. ResultsEstimates of total genetic variances and residual variances with GBLUP-I 1 and GBLUP-I 2 were close to the true values and the regression coefficients of total <b>genetic</b> <b>values</b> on their estimates were close to 1. Accuracies of estimated total <b>genetic</b> <b>values</b> in both GBLUP-I methods increased with increasing degree of imprinting and broad-sense heritability. When the imprinting variances were equal to 1. 4 % to 6. 0 % of the phenotypic variances, the accuracies of estimated total <b>genetic</b> <b>values</b> with GBLUP-I 1 exceeded those with GBLUP by 1. 4 % to 7. 8 %. In comparison with GBLUP-I 1, the superiority of GBLUP-I 2 over GBLUP depended strongly on degree of imprinting and difference in <b>genetic</b> <b>values</b> between paternal and maternal alleles. When paternal and maternal alleles were predicted (phasing accuracy was equal to 0. 979), accuracies of the estimated total <b>genetic</b> <b>values</b> in GBLUP-I 1 and GBLUP-I 2 were 1. 7 % and 1. 2 % lower than when paternal and maternal alleles were known. ConclusionsThis simulation study shows that GBLUP-I 1 and GBLUP-I 2 can accurately estimate total genetic variance and perform well for the prediction of total <b>genetic</b> <b>values.</b> GBLUP-I 1 is preferred for genomic evaluation, while GBLUP-I 2 is preferred when the imprinting effects are large, and the genetic effects differ substantially between sexes...|$|R
40|$|Best linear {{unbiased}} prediction (BLUP) {{has been}} used to estimate the fixed effects and random effects of complex traits. Traditionally, genomic relationship matrix-based (GRM) and random marker-based BLUP analyses are prevalent to estimate the <b>genetic</b> <b>values</b> of complex traits.

We used 35, 675 SNPs and R package "rrBLUP" for the BLUP analysis. The SNP-SNP relationship matrix was calculated using the GRM and Sherman-Morrison-Woodbury lemma. The SNP-GBLUP result was very similar to G-BLUP in the prediction of <b>genetic</b> <b>values.</b> However, there were many discrepancies between SNP-BLUP and the other two BLUPs.

50|$|Males can {{potentially}} fertilize eggs {{at a much}} faster rate than females can produce them, meaning a male can best increase his reproductive success by finding and fertilizing as many different females as possible. In Drosophila melanogaster, the reproductive success of males increased {{with the number of}} matings, but for females there was no direct relationship with number of mates and number of offspring produced. When males have multiple mating partners, they sometimes have to share parentage of the offspring, reducing the <b>genetic</b> <b>value</b> of the offspring to him and thus reduces the relative benefit of staying to help. When paternity is shared between multiple males, males are expected to be less likely to stay in order to help the female care for the offspring because there is little benefit in staying to help raise the other offspring when there are other males present.|$|E
40|$|Maximum {{likelihood}} {{techniques for}} estimating variance components have desirable features. Nevertheless, {{the use of}} maximum likelihood methods for estimating variance components from unbalanced data is difficult. Moreover, additional complications arise {{in the context of}} maternal effects models. In this thesis, procedures for generating maximum likelihood estimates of variance components in a maternal effects model are derived for the case of unbalanced data. A hierarchical design where by each sire is mated to several dams is used, there being observations on parents and offspring. The special structure of the data together with the assumption that the sires and the dams are unrelated is exploited in order to obtain explicit expressions for the inverse and the determinant of the variance-covariance matrix of the observations, which arises in the likelihood function and the partial derivatives thereof. Algorithms are proposed to generate the likelihood function and its partial derivatives which are required for constrained and unconstrained optimization of the function. As an illustration, the procedures are applied to weaning weight data of sheep and 8 -week weights of pigs. The procedures are extended to estimate variance components in a multiple-trait setting. Provided the relevant genetic variances and covariances are known, best linear unbiased prediction techniques can be used to predict direct and maternal <b>genetic</b> <b>values.</b> Predicting direct and maternal <b>genetic</b> <b>values</b> of all animals is not difficult since this is a special case of a multiple-trait evaluation. However, if the objective is to eliminate the influence of the maternal effect so that selection is for direct genetic merit, predictions are required for the direct <b>genetic</b> <b>values</b> of all animals of interest and the maternal <b>genetic</b> <b>values</b> of just their dams. Although no analysis is carried out using actual data, best linear unbiased prediction equations for predicting direct <b>genetic</b> <b>values</b> of all animals and the maternal <b>genetic</b> <b>values</b> of their dams are derived. In the process, the rapid method of inverting the relationship matrix is modified to enable the inversion of the variance-covariance matrix of the genetic effects.

It was thought that increasing the gain is always accompanied by a loss in effective number of clones, but it has shown that both can be obtained in the same time by genetic thinning using the linear deployment algorithm if applied to some rather unbalanced seed orchards.

Ultrasound has been investigated as a cheaper means of collecting carcass information. The literature indicates that carcass traits measured via ultrasound on yearling seedstock will respond to selection. Although the literature is variable on the subject, there are reported genetic correlation (r g) estimates between live animal ultrasound and actual carcass attributes that are greater than. 70 for all ultrasonically measured carcass traits. When r g between seedstock ultrasound and slaughter cattle carcass measures are > 0. 70, similar or greater genetic progress in finished cattle carcass merit could be achieved by using ultrasound information entirely compared to using typical carcass progeny information; however, the maximum accuracy of prediction using ultrasound information in lieu of finished cattle carcass information would be r g. Therefore both actual and live animal, ultrasonically measured carcass traits should be included in genetic evaluation programs, which will allow for an increase in the accuracy of prediction of carcass <b>genetic</b> <b>values</b> on young seedstock animals due to the inclusion of ultrasound information, and will also allow for the possible production of high accuracy sires based on finished cattle progeny carcass information.

40|$|One {{specific}} hypothesis {{explaining the}} evolution of extra-pair reproduction (EPR) by socially monogamous females is that EPR is under indirect selection because extra-pair offspring (EPO) sired by extra-pair males have higher additive <b>genetic</b> <b>value</b> for fitness than the within-pair offspring (WPO) a female would have produced had she solely mated with her socially paired male. This hypothesis has not been explicitly tested by comparing additive <b>genetic</b> <b>value</b> between EPO and the WPO they replaced. We show that the difference in additive genetic breeding value (BV) between EPO and the WPO they replaced {{is proportional to the}} genetic covariance between offspring fitness and male net paternity gain through EPR, and estimate this covariance with respect to offspring recruitment in free-living song sparrows (Melospiza melodia). Recruitment and net paternity gain showed non-zero additive genetic variance and heritability, and negative genetic covariance. Opposite to prediction, EPO therefore had lower BV for recruitment than the WPO they replaced. We thereby demonstrate an explicit quantitative genetic approach to testing the hypothesis that EPR allows polyandrous females to increase offspring additive <b>genetic</b> <b>value,</b> and suggest that there may be weak indirect selection against female EPR through reduced additive <b>genetic</b> <b>value</b> for recruitment of EPO versus WPO in song sparrows...|$|E

Is the conventional approach for data simulation in this field an appropriate basis to optimize such methods in view of experimental data? Here, we present an alternative approach, striving to simulate more realistic data based on a genotype-phenotype map which includes a simulated metabolome level.

40|$|Abstract Background Genome-wide {{approaches}} to analyze {{single nucleotide polymorphism}} (SNP) data have proliferated due to the increased availability and affordability of markers, but in practice {{a small number of}} markers may be selected from sets that do not approach dense genome-wide coverage. This study focused on a genome-wide approach to identify markers useful to a breeding program using a Bayesian method to estimate effects for markers distributed across the genome at varied densities. A simulated dataset containing 4665 individual phenotypes for a quantitative trait and genotypes for 6000 SNPs spaced in 0. 1 cM increments across six chromosomes was analyzed using a Bayesian approach in which effects for all single markers are simultaneously estimated. The dataset was also analyzed with marker densities reduced to 0. 5, 1. 0, 2. 0 and 5. 0 cM. Type I errors were not a major concern but replications of each analysis were performed to determine acceptance of estimated marker effects. Results The Bayesian analysis of the original dataset was able to estimate <b>genetic</b> <b>values</b> for markers in a small number of regions while shrinking other marker effects to zero. Analysis of the reduced density datasets also showed clear signals in a small number of regions where some effects appeared to be distributed across multiple markers.

Conclusion A Bayesian multiple marker approach appears to be suitable for predicting <b>genetic</b> <b>values,</b> even with reduced density datasets where large numbers of markers are not yet available for many species.

Predictions of <b>genetic</b> <b>value</b> remained accurate even when the training and evaluation data were 10 generations apart. Best linear unbiased prediction (BLUP) of SNP effects does not take full advantage of the genome sequence data, and nonlinear predictions, such as the Bayesian method used here, are needed to achieve maximum accuracy. On the basis of theoretical work, the results could be extended to more realistic genome and population sizes...|$|E
40|$|A finite locus {{model has}} been {{developed}} which models an individual’s <b>genetic</b> <b>value</b> as being the aggregate effect {{of a series of}} loci. Established Monte Carlo Markov Chain (MCMC) techniques are used to sample fixed effects and the error variance, while a new sampling method is used to sample genotypes and locus effects and is based on sampling all genotypes in a pedigree jointly. The model is tested using unselected populations...|$|E
40|$|ABSTRACT- Based on a {{polygenic}} {{system of}} a diploid species, without epistasis, and a population in Hardy-Weinberg equilibrium, without inbreeding and under linkage equilibrium, {{it can be}} shown that: (1) the narrow sense heritability at half-sib family level {{is equal to the}} square of the correlation coefficient between family mean and the additive <b>genetic</b> <b>value</b> of its common parent; (2) the narrow sense heritability at full-sib family level is equal to the square of the correlation coefficient between family mean and the mean of the additive genetic values of its parents; (3) the narrow sense heritability at S n family level is exactly equal to the square of the correlation coefficient between family mean and the additive <b>genetic</b> <b>value</b> of its parent only in absence of dominance or when allele frequencies are equal; and (4) the broad sense heritability at full-sib or S n family level can be used to analyze selection efficiency, since the progeny genotypic mean is, in general, a good indicator of parents, or S n- 1 plan...|$|E
40|$|The {{objective}} {{of this study was}} to evaluate the genotype-environment interaction (GEI) in the body weight adjusted to 550 days of age (W 550) of Polled Nellore cattle raised in Northeastern Brazil using reaction norms (RN) models. Hierarchical RN models included fixed effects for age of cow (linear and quadratic) and random effects for contemporary groups (CG) and additive genetic RN level and slope. Four RN hierarchical models (RNHM) were used. The RNHM 2 S uses the solutions of contemporary groups estimated by the standard animal model (AM) and considers them as environmental level for predicting the reaction norms and the RNHM 1 S, which jointly estimate these two sets of unknowns. Two versions were considered for both models, one with a homogeneous (Hm) and another with a heterogeneous (He) residual variance. The one-step homogeneous residual variance model (RNHM 1 SHm) offered better adjustment to the data when compared with other models. For the RNHM 1 SHm model, estimates of additive genetic variance and heritability increased with environment improvement (260. 75 ± 75. 80 kg 2 to 4298. 39 ± 356. 56 kg 2 and 0. 22 ± 0. 05 to 0. 82 ± 0. 01, for low- and high-performance environments, respectively). High correlation (0. 97 ± 0. 01) between the intercept and the slope of RN shows that animals with higher <b>genetic</b> <b>values</b> respond better to environment improvement. In the evaluation of breeding sires with higher <b>genetic</b> <b>values</b> in the various environments using Spearman’s correlation, values between 0 and 0. 98 were observed, pointing to high reclassification, especially among <b>genetic</b> <b>values</b> obtained by the animal model in comparison with those obtained via RNHM 1 SHm. The existence of GEI is confirmed, and so is the need for specific evaluations for low, medium and high level production environments...|$|R
40|$|We {{suggest a}} new {{approximation}} for {{the prediction of}} <b>genetic</b> <b>values</b> in marker-assisted selection. The new approximation is compared to the standard approach. It is shown that the new approach will often provide substantially better prediction of genetic values; furthermore the new approximation avoids some of the known statistical problems of the standard approach. The advantages of the new approach are illustrated by a simulation study in which the new approximation outperforms both the standard approach and phenotypic selection...|$|R
40|$|This {{study was}} carried out at the Department of Fisheries, Faculty of Agriculture, Khon Kaen University, Khon Kaen, Thailand during April to September 2007 to {{determine}} DNA patterns of Pla-mong fish (Pangasuis bocourti Sauvage 1880) {{with the use of}} RAPD-PCR amplification. One hundred twenty individual fish samples were harvested from four locations along the Mae Kong River, i. e., Nongkhai, Nakornphanom, Mukdaharn and Ubon Ratchatani provinces, each location has thirty individual fish samples and the four locations were used as treatments and thirty individual fish of each location were used as replications. Sixteen RAPD decamer primers from three kits of Operon Technologies were subjected to a preliminary test and only seven decamer primers were suited most for PCR amplification. The results on both similarity correlation coefficients and genetic distances revealed that the fish of Pla-mong of the Mae Kong River could be divided into two groups, i. e., the first group included the fish harvested from Nongkhai and Nakornphanom provinces with their <b>genetic</b> <b>values</b> ranged from 0. 20 to 0. 36 and the second group included the harvested fish from Mukdaharn and Nakornphanom provinces with their <b>genetic</b> <b>values</b> ranged from 0. 20 to 0. 44...|$|R
