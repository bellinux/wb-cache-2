30|$|Usage {{status of}} the <b>implant</b> <b>card</b> {{retained}} by the above patients (“implant card” refers to the card which described the record of implant placed in the patient, such as the implant manufacturer, implant type, length, diameter. This questionnaire {{does not require a}} publisher, such as manufacturers and a society. If the respondent replies that the <b>implant</b> <b>card</b> had been used, he/she had written the publisher.).|$|E
30|$|The {{objective}} {{of this study was}} to ascertain the situation relevant to implants, the status of oral self-care, the status of aftercare provided by the dentist who placed the implant, and the usage status of the <b>implant</b> <b>card,</b> in homebound or institutionalized older adults who are receiving home-visit dental care due to the inability to visit a dental clinic on their own.|$|E
5000|$|Invited to Nazi Germany during World War II, Dr. Asagumo {{is asked}} by Hitler to {{collaborate}} in researching the new weapon [...] "Big X". Concerned {{about the possible}} effects of this weapon, Dr. Asagumo intentionally delays {{the progress of the}} research, conspiring with his co-researcher, the devious Dr. Engel. Immediately before Germany is defeated by the Allies, Dr. Asagumo is shot to death by the German army but not before <b>implanting</b> a <b>card</b> inscribed with the secret of Big X into his son, Shigeru. An organization claiming alliance with the Nazis appears, steals the card from Shigeru, who now lives in Tokyo, and completes the Big X project, which is revealed to be a drug that can expand the human body without limitation. Dr. Engel's grandson has joined the Nazi Alliance. Recovering Big X from the enemy, Shigeru's son Akira fearlessly challenges the Nazi Alliance and Hans Engel, who are plotting to conquer the world.|$|R

During the match, Ken reveals {{that he had}} {{undergone}} through a surgery to <b>implant</b> a <b>card</b> sensor into his fingernail which allows {{the details of a}} certain card into the person's brain. The people following Mr. Ko start a revolution against him after watching Lionel Messi of Barcelona score against Real Madrid, winning them. After killing them all, Mr. Ko tries finding Ken. Ken starts shooting cards in retaliation. [...] "Cool", is revealed to be wearing the mask of one of Mr. Ko's crew, whom had secretly diverted the ship back towards the waters, which police are now making their way to.

30|$|In addition, {{the number}} of {{patients}} with implants placed at the dentist’s own clinic accounted for only one third, suggesting that the remaining two thirds of the patients had the implants placed at other dental clinics. Ideally, this implies a great need for the standardization on size and shape of screw or driver used for implants, which would likely be useful to ensure continued post-operative implant care. It will be necessary to encourage implant manufacturers to do so through academic societies and dental associations. However, since basic research on mechanical performance is also necessary, it is difficult to promptly promote it, so it seems realistically to promote standardized implant cards. Even the dentists who do not offer implant treatment clearly recognized the need for implant cards, as Visser et al. [8] suggested the necessity for an “implant passport” [7]. In actuality, however, more than 50 % of the dentists offering implant treatment do not use the <b>implant</b> <b>card</b> and, even in cases where it is used, most of the cards are not standardized ones. Thus, we strongly hope that a systematized <b>implant</b> <b>card</b> will gain widespread use.|$|E
30|$|A survey {{questionnaire}} {{was sent by}} post mail to 2339 people who are representative members or dental specialists belonging {{to any of the}} following three academic societies: Japanese Society of Oral Implantology, Japanese Society of Gerodontology, and Japan Prosthodontic Society. The survey questions asked were about provision/no provision of implant treatment, provision/no provision of home-visit dental care, the situation of patients after implant treatment, the situation of implants in the context of home-visit dental care, and the usage status and recognition of the <b>implant</b> <b>card.</b>|$|E
30|$|Therefore, {{a survey}} {{was carried out}} to {{investigate}} the rate of having received implant treatment in receiving long-term care or home-visit dental care patients and the actual status of oral self-care, {{as well as the}} actual status of post-operative care by the dentist who placed the implants, in homebound or institutionalized older adults who are receiving home-visit dental care due to the inability to visit a dental clinic on their own. Additionally, usage status and recognition of the <b>implant</b> <b>card</b> (it refers to the card which described the record of implant placed in the patient, such as the implant manufacturer, implant type, length, diameter), which contains information on the implanted implant and may contribute to continuing post-operative implant care, were surveyed.|$|E
30|$|No {{less than}} 30 % of the dentists had {{patients}} who were {{admitted to the hospital}} or became homebound after receiving implant treatment at their clinic. Twenty-two percent of the dentists had been consulted about the implants. Dentists who continued to provide post-operative implant care through home-visit dental care accounted for approximately 80 %. On the other hand, however, 40 % of the dentists did not know the post-implantation status of their implant patients. Of the patients receiving home-visit dental care, approximately 3 % had implants (identified mainly by visual inspection). It was found that more than 50 % of the dentists offering implant treatment did not use the <b>implant</b> <b>card,</b> and even in cases where it was used, most of the cards were not in the standardized format.|$|E
30|$|Approximately 3 % of the {{patients}} seen in home-visit dental care had implants. Lantto et al. reported a lower proportion of having implants among older adults receiving long-term care compared to healthy controls [11]. Meanwhile, the rate of having implants among older adults that was calculated {{based on the results}} of the Survey of Dental Diseases is approximately 3 %, which is largely consistent with the results of the present study among the older adults receiving long-term care. However, as the results of the present study and the Survey of Dental Diseases were mostly examined by visual inspection, it could not deny the possibility that have failed to detect potentially more implants, it is necessary to investigate the actual situation in the future. Fifty-six percent of {{the patients}} with implants were unable to perform oral self-care, which is lower compared to 77 % in patients without implants. The outcome may be attributable to a high level of interest in the oral condition seen in patients with implants as well as the difference in the general condition such as age, cognition function, and cerebrovascular disease between the two groups, which is a subject for future research. However, the percentage, 56 %, in itself is a high level as the proportion of patients incapable of oral self-care, and hence, it is important to provide them with professional care/management despite the issue of manpower [12, 13]. Moreover, some case, it is difficult for elderly patients or carers to clean their implant-supported prosthesis [8], so it is important to elucidate how the position or number of implants influences the complexity of care. Therefore, it might be necessary to promote a unified and standardized <b>implant</b> <b>card</b> describing necessary and sufficient implant information.|$|E
