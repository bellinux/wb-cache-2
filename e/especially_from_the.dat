5|$|Except for his autobiography, MalcolmX left no {{published}} writings. His {{philosophy is}} known almost entirely {{from the many}} speeches and interviews he gave from 1952 until his death. Many of those speeches, <b>especially</b> <b>from</b> <b>the</b> {{last year of his}} life, were recorded and have been published.|$|E
5|$|LARP {{has been}} a subject of {{academic}} research and theory. Much of this research originates from role-players, <b>especially</b> <b>from</b> <b>the</b> publications of the Nordic Knutepunkt role-playing conventions. The broader academic community has recently begun to study LARP as well, both {{to compare it to}} other media and other varieties of interactive gaming, and also to evaluate it in its own right.|$|E
5|$|Mieszko thus {{strove to}} subdue Pomerania at the Baltic coast. The area {{was the site}} of wealthy trade emporia, {{frequently}} visited by traders, <b>especially</b> <b>from</b> <b>the</b> east, west and north. Mieszko had {{every reason to believe that}} great profits would have resulted from his ability to control the rich seaports situated on long distance trade routes such as Wolin, Szczecin and Kołobrzeg.|$|E

The Belfast Telegraph dedicated several pages to the match the following day, including {{the front and}} back covers, whereas The News Letter, a largely unionist publication, had sparse coverage, highlighting traditional attitudes to Gaelic games in Northern Ireland.|$|E
5|$|Aarhus is the {{principal}} centre for education in the Jutland region. It draws students from a large area, <b>especially</b> <b>from</b> <b>the</b> western and southern parts of the peninsula. The relatively large influx of young people and students creates a natural base for cultural activities. Aarhus has the greatest concentration of students in Denmark, fully 12% of citizens attending short, medium or long courses of study. In addition to around 25 institutions of higher education, several research forums have evolved {{to assist in the}} transfer of expertise from education to business. The city is home to more than 52,000 students.|$|E
5|$|An early plan {{conceived}} by British Rail {{in the early}} 1970s for a route passing through Tonbridge met considerable opposition on environmental and social grounds, <b>especially</b> <b>from</b> <b>the</b> Leigh Action Group and Surrey & Kent Action on Rail (SKAR). A committee {{was set up to}} examine the proposal under Sir Alexander Cairncross; but in due course environment minister Anthony Crosland announced that the project had been cancelled, together with the plan for the tunnel itself.|$|E

5|$|Bronze Age {{settlers}} also constructed megaliths {{at various}} sites, {{many of them}} dating from the second millennium BC, although the chambered cairns were replaced by burial cists, found on for example, Inchmarnock. Settlement evidence, <b>especially</b> <b>from</b> <b>the</b> {{early part of this}} era is however poor. The Queen of the Inch necklace is an article of jewellery made of jet found on Bute that dates from circa 2000 BC. During the early Iron Age Brythonic culture held sway, there being no evidence that the Roman occupation of southern Scotland extended to these islands.|$|E
5|$|In 1933, Indian Muslims, <b>especially</b> <b>from</b> <b>the</b> United Provinces, {{began to}} urge Jinnah {{to return and}} take up again his {{leadership}} of the Muslim League, an organisation which had fallen into inactivity. He remained titular president of the League, but declined to travel to India to preside over its 1933 session in April, writing {{that he could not}} possibly return there {{until the end of the}} year.|$|E
5|$|In the meantime, war-weariness had set {{in among}} the Venetians, who {{suffered}} from the disruption in trade. Peace feelers {{were sent to the}} Ottomans, but their demand for the full concession of Crete as a condition for peace was unacceptable to the Republic. With {{the end of the war}} between France and Spain however, the Venetians became encouraged, hoping to receive increased assistance in money and men, <b>especially</b> <b>from</b> <b>the</b> French, whose traditionally good relations with the Porte had soured of late.|$|E

5|$|Paulucci reorganised the Kingdom's infantry, {{increasing}} the number of the troops, modifying the brigade system and facing both enthusiastic approval and bitter critic, <b>especially</b> <b>from</b> <b>the</b> heir to the throne, Prince Carlo Alberto. Carlo Felice died in March 1831, and Paulucci was eventually discharged of all his positions. The new king, only days later, suppressed the rank of Full General in the Sardinian Army.|$|E
5|$|Peter is {{put under}} house arrest for assault and soon begins to miss his friends. Peter has {{a vision of the}} Pawtucket Patriot, a fictional ale mascot, from his ale can label and on his advice opens a bar in his {{basement}} so that his friends can come to visit. The basement bar soon becomes a local hotspot. Lois is upset about this, until she gets a chance to sing on stage before an appreciative crowd. As she savors the spotlight over the next few days, Peter becomes increasingly uncomfortable with the attention she is getting, <b>especially</b> <b>from</b> <b>the</b> male patrons. Peter demands that she quit singing, but she refuses.|$|E
5|$|Tamagnino {{is known}} to have left Brescia while the {{construction}} of the sanctuary was ongoing, evidently finding his work undervalued and underpaid. The reasons for the bias are unclear, but it is possible that Cairano enjoyed local favour, <b>especially</b> <b>from</b> <b>the</b> directors of the company commissioning the shrine, which allowed him to prevail over Tamagnino despite the latter's technical superiority. Tamagnino then won the prestigious contract for the façade of the Certosa of Pavia, to be installed under the aegis of Father Amedeo and Antonio Mantegazza. The corporate pact between the artist and the two sculptors strengthened in May 1492, providing Tamagnino with a unique training experience as well as a remarkable leap in his career.|$|E

5|$|The Green Revolution was {{a series}} of research, development, and {{technology}} transfer initiatives, between the 1940s and the late 1970s. It increased agriculture production around the world, <b>especially</b> <b>from</b> <b>the</b> late 1960s. The initiatives, led by Norman Borlaug and credited with saving over a billion people from starvation, involved the development of high-yielding varieties of cereal grains, expansion of irrigation infrastructure, modernization of management techniques, distribution of hybridized seeds, synthetic fertilizers, and pesticides to farmers.|$|E
5|$|The flow of {{the river}} has {{decreased}} in power in recent years, partly because of surface run-off in the upper catchment of the Hazel Brook, <b>especially</b> <b>from</b> <b>the</b> large retail centre at Cribbs Causeway, which sends {{a good deal of}} silt into the system, slowing the flow and creating a risk of flooding downstream. This problem has now been partially alleviated by the construction of the Catbrain attenuation reservoir near Cribbs Causeway. Measurements of pollution by the city council show the water to be relatively clean.|$|E
5|$|The obverse {{is similar}} to coins from Merovingian France, <b>especially</b> <b>from</b> <b>the</b> {{southern}} parts, as well as showing influences from Visigothic Spain. The reverse side, however, has no known predecessors in Merovingian or Visigothic coinage. Although by the late 6th century, Merovingian and Visigothic kings were putting their names on their coins, no surviving coins from either kingdom name a bishop. The design of the figure is derived from Byzantine imperial coins, and the cross itself is large and closely resembles an altar cross.|$|E

5|$|There are {{numerous}} important prehistoric remains in Orkney, <b>especially</b> <b>from</b> <b>the</b> Neolithic period, four of which form a World Heritage Site. There are diverse {{reasons for the}} abundance of the archaeological record. The sandstone bedrock provides easily workable stone materials and the wind-blown sands have helped preserve several sites. The relative lack of industrialisation and low incidence of ploughing also have helped to preserve these ancient monuments. Local tradition hints at both a fear and veneration of these ancient structures (perhaps inherited from the Norse period of occupation) that may have helped to retain their structural integrity..|$|E
5|$|There were {{calls for}} Diefenbaker's retirement, <b>especially</b> <b>from</b> <b>the</b> Bay Street {{wing of the}} party as early as 1964. Diefenbaker {{initially}} beat back attempts to remove him without trouble. When Pearson called an election in 1965 in the expectation of receiving a majority, Diefenbaker ran an aggressive campaign. The Liberals fell two seats short of a majority, and the Tories improved their position slightly {{at the expense of the}} smaller parties. After the election, some Tories, led by party president Dalton Camp, began a quiet campaign to oust Diefenbaker.|$|E
5|$|Two {{statues of}} Riel {{are located in}} Winnipeg. One of the Winnipeg statues, the work of {{architect}} Étienne Gaboury and sculptor Marcien Lemay, depicts Riel as a naked and tortured figure. It was unveiled in 1970 {{and stood in the}} grounds of the Legislative Assembly of Manitoba for 23 years. After much outcry (<b>especially</b> <b>from</b> <b>the</b> Métis community) that the statue was an undignified misrepresentation, the statue was removed and placed at the Collège universitaire de Saint-Boniface. It was replaced in 1994 with a statue designed by Miguel Joyal depicting Riel as a dignified statesman. The unveiling ceremony was on 16 May 1996, in Winnipeg.|$|E
