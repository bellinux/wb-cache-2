500|$|Very {{was known}} as an eccentric, prone to odd {{behavior}} and may have suffered from bipolar disorder. The first signs of a breakdown came shortly after meeting Emerson, as Very was completing an essay on William Shakespeare. As Very later explained, [...] "I felt within me a new will... {{it was not a}} feeling of my own but a sensible will that was not my own... These two consciousnesses, as I may call them, continued with me". In August 1837, while traveling by train, he was suddenly overcome with terror at its speed until he realized he was being [...] "borne along by a divine engine and undertaking his life-journey". As he told Henry Ware Jr., professor of pulpit eloquence and pastoral care at Harvard Divinity School, divine inspiration helped him suddenly understand the twenty-fourth chapter of the Gospel of Matthew and that Christ was having his Second Coming within him. When Ware did not believe him, Very said, [...] "I had thought you did the will of the Father, and that I should receive some sympathy from you—But I now <b>find</b> <b>that</b> <b>you</b> are doing your own will, and not the will of your father". Very also claimed that he was {{under the influence of the}} Holy Spirit and composed verse while in this state. Emerson did not believe Very's claim and, noting the poor writing, he asked, [...] "cannot the spirit parse & spell?" [...] Very said he was also tormented by strong sexual desires which he believed were only held in check by the will of God. To help control himself, he avoided speaking with or even looking at women—he called it his [...] "sacrifice of Beauty".|$|E

I, {{not to mention}} the other {{individuals}} who have also moved and fallen, have often advised on this matter. Regrettably, my brother, if you look back, you will <b>find</b> <b>that</b> <b>you</b> are the person solely responsible for all this because you undertook the mission, and during six months, we only lost what we built in years." ...|$|E
2500|$|Pottinger {{accepted}} Foreign Secretary Lord Palmerston's {{offer of}} the post of envoy and plenipotentiary in China and superintendent of British trade, thus replacing Charles Elliot. In 1841, when Pottinger was sent to China, Palmerston instructed him to [...] "examine with care the natural capacities of Hong Kong, and you will not agree to give up that Island unless you should <b>find</b> <b>that</b> <b>you</b> can exchange it for another in the neighbourhood of Canton, better adapted for the purposes in view; equally defensible; and affording sufficient shelter for Ships of War and Commerce". On 4 November 1841, Palmerston's successor Lord Aberdeen wrote to Pottinger that he had doubts over Hong Kong's acquisition since it would incur administrative expenses, and complicate relations with China and other nations.|$|E

"The earl {{will be in}} a nice way, when he <b>finds</b> <b>that</b> <b>you</b> have gone," [...] Roger said, as {{he stood}} in the stern to watch the rapidly {{receding}} towers of Dunbar. [...] "There will be a hot hue and cry for you. The earl is not accustomed to be thwarted, and they say that he is a mighty hot-tempered man. I have no doubt that, as soon as his fellows bring him word of what has happened to them, and he <b>finds</b> <b>that</b> <b>you</b> have quitted the inn, he will send parties of horse out to scour the roads to Berwick and Haddington; and to search the country, far and near." ...|$|R
2500|$|His {{style has}} been noted for its unique instrumentation, {{utilizing}} {{a vast array of}} ethnic instruments, recorded sounds, synthetic textures, and the traditional orchestra, often concurrently. [...] When asked about his inclination for embracing new techniques and constantly shifting his musical palette throughout his career, Goldsmith said, [...] "It seems like it's me, and that's that! [...] Certain composers are doing {{the same thing over and}} over again, which I feel is sort of uninteresting. [...] I don't <b>find</b> <b>that</b> <b>you</b> grow very much in that way. [...] I like to keep changing, trying to do new things. [...] Basically, I'm saying the same thing with a little different twist on it. Once you get caught up in the creative process, something inside takes over, and your subconscious just does it for you." ...|$|E
2500|$|The leading naturalist Sir John Herschel wrote from Cape Town on 20 February 1836, thanking Lyell {{for sending}} {{a copy of}} Principles and praising the book as opening a way for bold {{speculation}} on [...] "that mystery of mysteries, the replacement of extinct species by others" [...] – by analogy with other intermediate causes, [...] "the origination of fresh species, could it ever come under our cognizance, would be {{found to be a}} natural in contradistinction to a miraculous process". Lyell replied: [...] "In regard to the origination of new species, I am very glad to <b>find</b> <b>that</b> <b>you</b> think it probable that it may be carried on through the intervention of intermediate causes. I left this rather to be inferred, not thinking it worth while to offend a certain class of persons by embodying in words what would only be a speculation." ...|$|E

"He {{arrived the}} day before the Welsh raid on your estate, sir. <b>Finding</b> <b>that</b> <b>you</b> were absent, he {{intended}} to return home the next morning; but the matter delayed him, for a day, as he rode out with your knights to punish the marauders; who, however, made off before they could be overtaken." ...|$|R

But you are friends of my great enemy, King Anko, {{and it will}} annoy him very much when he <b>finds</b> <b>that</b> <b>you</b> have been destroyed by me.
