40|$|Abstract. The aim of {{this work}} is to develop an {{integrated}} system for facilitating the process of designing the drawing dies and their component. The developed system {{is based on the}} integration between Computer Aided Process Planning in Sheet Metal Drawn parts “CAPP”, and the Computer Aided Design in <b>Deep</b> <b>Drawing</b> <b>Die</b> components “CAD”. Both modules are coded using Visual Basic program and joined with AutoCAD. The CAPP module made to report the drawing load and to plot the shape of the drawn shell in each stage of the Axis-Symmetric Deep Drawing process. Based on the reported shell geometry, the dimensions of the die components are calculated and transferred to the CAD module. The CAD module, which is based on many data bases (standard parts, sheet metal data), plots the required <b>deep</b> <b>drawing</b> <b>die</b> components for each drawn stage on the AutoCAD monitor. A demonstrated example is presented to validate the developed system and to show that the system results are acceptable...|$|E
40|$|Aim of {{this work}} is the {{tribological}} investigation of micro structured surfaces generated by micro milling and the performance testing of a micro structured micro <b>deep</b> <b>drawing</b> <b>die.</b> Three samples exhibiting different micro structured surfaces with arithmetical mean heights Sa {{in a range of}} 148 nm to 741 nm were manufactured by micro milling. The surface texture is determined by the process parameters of the micro milling operation. Tribological properties of the micro structured surfaces were investigated by means of a ball-on-plate micro tribometer and compared to those of a polished reference sample (Sa = 24 nm), a clear dependence of the frictional properties on the surface roughness was found. Lowest friction Î¼ = 0. 26 was achieved for the sample with a roughness Sa = 148 nm. Surfaces with higher or lower roughness provoked increased friction in tribological testing being associated with an interlocking of surfaceâ s asperities or dominant adhesion, respectively. Subsequently, micro structures were machined into the surface of a micro <b>deep</b> <b>drawing</b> <b>die</b> for drawing of rectangular micro cups. The performance of this die was tested in deep drawing experiments against a polished reference die by means of achievable drawing ratio. At this stage the full advantage of the micro structuring of die surfaces was not achieved, yet.

40|$|A recent {{development}} in {{sheet metal forming}} industry is the application of tailored blanks: blanks prepared from separate pieces of sheet material, welded together prior to the forming process. The pieces of sheet material can have different properties, enabling weight reduction of components, corrosion resistance using cathodic protection or the possibility to create local weak spots, resulting in well defined deformation zones {{in the event of}} an accident (e. g. crash zones in automotive applications). However, a major draw back in the utilisation of these pre-welded or tailored blanks is that the weld between the pieces of sheet exhibits increased hardness and roughness, leading to possible abrasive wear of the sheet metal forming tool [1]. In this work a model is developed describing the abrasive wear of <b>deep</b> <b>drawing</b> <b>dies</b> caused by the application of tailored blanks. Many surface contact models are based on the assumption that surfaces are composed of a collection of small asperities of which the tips are equally sized and spherically shaped and have some kind of statistical height distribution. This approach w as used in 1966 by Greenwood and Williamson [2] and was successfully followed by many researchers during the following decades. The statistical representation of surface topography enables calculation of contact forces and asperity deformations with reasonable accuracy using well-established equations. Although this approach ha...|$|R
40|$|High {{strength}} steel materials, {{coated sheet}} metals and other metallic materials for manufacturing car bodies require an advanced {{quality of the}} cutting tools and <b>deep</b> <b>drawing</b> <b>dies.</b> Laser beam hardening has been established as the standard technology for increasing strength and lifetime of cutting edges and <b>deep</b> <b>drawing</b> tools. Laser cladding can be applied advantageously as a repair technology for tools. But {{more important is the}} application as »negative milling«-technology for fast design changes during the fitting loops of the tools. Once made at external specialists these technologies are getting integrated in manufacturing lines of tool makers. Fraunhofer IWS developed systems and components for applying these technologies. Automated processing supported by measuring and control systems reduce existing application barriers at operators who are well skilled in mechanical treatment but less experienced with heat treatment and cladding. Since laser beam hardening and cladding is frequently necessary in the same line machine costs can be reduced if both processes share a laser. The optimum beam quality for both processes is quite similar and can be delivered by modern fiber coupled high power diode lasers. Since the precision demands a rather moderate articulated robots can be used as machine system. They can get extended by linear axis or turning tables for achieving a larger field of operation. Fraunhofer IWS has developed laser process modules which can be adapted to a robot hand via robotic tool changers. With a simple subroutine a laser hardening machine can get transferred into a laser cladding machine and reverse. Each process module is connected to a separate laser fiber and via bus communication all subsystems interchange necessary information. That development has been supported by important customers like Audi and Volkswagen what are the first users of those process modules...|$|R

The invention further relates to a method for deep drawing a workpiece (4) with a <b>deep</b> <b>drawing</b> <b>die</b> (1), wherein a workpiece (4) is inserted between a top die and a bottom die (2, 3) and deep drawn by closing the top and bottom dies (2, 3), and wherein at least one actuator (8) is controlled to generate a holding force during deep drawing. Essentially, the invention presented controls the flange feed of a workpiece (4) in the tool (1) by pressure distributions which are adjustable in the forming process. By selectively increasing forces in the flange feed at selected locations between holding down clamp (2 a) and die plate (3 a) it is possible to control the flow of material into the die plate (3 a) during deep drawing. Using this control, it is possible to relieve the load on regions with high deforming work, so that tears or cracks at these points in the finished component can be prevented. This involves increasing the friction between die plate (3 a) and plate (4) or between plate (4) and holding down clamp (2 a) by generating holding forces, as a result of which the material is held fast and prevented from flowing at this location...|$|E

40|$|One of {{the most}} common {{outcomes}} in deep drawing process is earing, or the formation of uneven height at the top rim of a drawn part due to the material anisotropy. The present study involves experimental and numerical studies of earing formation in deep drawing process. The main objective of the present study is to determine the accuracy of Hill’s 1948 and Barlat 1991 yield criteria in predicting earing using only uniaxial tensile test data for FCC materials. The second objective is to investigate the effects of blank diameter and blank holder force (BHF) on earing behavior. A <b>deep</b> <b>drawing</b> <b>die</b> for cylindrical cup has been designed for the present study. For the experiments, two groups of blanks made from aluminum alloy AA 1100 and commercially pure copper were drawn using two sets of BHF. The earing profiles were measured at every increment of 5 degrees from original sheet metal rolling direction, which were then symmetrized and normalized for comparison. For the finite element analysis, the process is modeled as a 3 dimensional, quarter-model in MSC. PATRAN with MSC. MARC as nonlinear implicit solver. Results showed that using only uniaxial tensile test data, Hill’s 1948 yield criterion was able to accurately predict earing behavior for aluminum. However, Hill’s 1948 criterion did not accurately predict earing for copper due to simplifying assumptions used in the FEA. The yield stresses and plastic flow curve should be averaged for all orientations for materials with high angular yield stress difference such as copper. Barlat 1991 criterion was observed to be unable to predict earing behavior for both metals due to its dependency on yield stresses input only. It was also observed that percentage earing increases with increasing blank diameter. BHF did not affect earing behavior directly, but insufficient BHF were observed to cause wrinkling, resulted in irregular height profiles. The results concluded that using only uniaxial tensile test data, Hill’s 1948 criterion performed well in predicting earing profile for aluminum alloys, which is significant to accurately predict earing behavior for aluminum alloys with yield criterion approach using only uniaxial tensile test data in engineering applications...|$|E
40|$|The {{utilization}} of {{aluminum die casting}} as enclosures where internal equipment is rotating inside of the casting and could fracture requires a strong housing to restrain the fractured parts. A typical example would be a supercharger. In case of a failure, unless adequately contained, fractured parts could injure people operating the equipment. A number of potential reinforcement materials were investigated. The initial work was conducted in sand molds to create experimental conditions that promote prolonged contact of the reinforcing material with molten aluminum. Bonding of Aluminum bronze, Cast iron, and Ni-resist inserts with various electroplated coatings and surface treatments were analyzed. Also toughening of A 354 aluminum cast alloy by steel and stainless steel wire mesh with various conditions was analyzed. A practical approach to reinforcement of die cast aluminum components {{is to use a}} reinforcing steel preform. Such performs can be fabricated from steel wire mesh or perforated metal sheet by stamping or deep drawing. A hemispherical, dome shaped casting was selected in this investigation. A <b>deep</b> <b>drawing</b> <b>die</b> was used to fabricate the reinforcing performs. The tendency of aluminum cast enclosures to fracture could be significantly reduced by installing a wire mesh of austenitic stainless steel or a punched austenitic stainless steel sheet within the casting. The use of reinforcements made of austenitic stainless steel wire mesh or punched austenitic stainless steel sheet provided marked improvement in reducing the fragmentation of the casting. The best strengthening was obtained with austenitic stainless steel wire and with a punched stainless steel sheet without annealing this material. Somewhat lower results were obtained with the annealed punched stainless steel sheet. When the annealed 1020 steel wire mesh was used, the results were only slightly improved because of the lower mechanical properties of this unalloyed steel. The lowest results were obtained with unreinforced 356 aluminum casting. Good strength can be obtained with a sound die casting without any defects produced by squeeze casting. The use of higher pressure to produce the squeeze casting has been shown to increase the strength of a hemispherical dome casting. This dome shape casting has been produced both with and without reinforcement and tested to determine its pressure resistance under internal pressure of water. Only a slight improvement in strength could be determined because of water leaks at the seal between hemispherical dome and its flat supporting side. However, when the ability of the casting was tested under the compressive force of a plunger, the strengthening effect of wire mesh or sheet was evident. Higher loads to failure were obtained because of the reinforcement of the stainless steel wire and punched sheet. Rather than a sudden failure occurring, the reinforcement of the stainless steel wire or the punched hard stainless steel sheet held the material together and prevented any loss of the fractured casting to the surroundings. Unalloyed steel did not have the required strength or mechanical properties to increase the properties of the casting...|$|E

Especially in forming processes such as <b>deep</b> <b>drawing,</b> a reduced use of lubricants is highly promising for saving resources and reducing production costs. Ultimately, the highest savings can be realised by a complete lubricant free <b>deep</b> <b>drawing</b> process - namely dry <b>deep</b> <b>drawing.</b> In this paper, a combined approach consisting of a new tool design for <b>deep</b> <b>drawing</b> in lubricant free applications and development of a protective tool coating is presented. The combination of macro and micro structuring of the tools and the protective coating ensure a stable process with a sufficiently wide process window under dry conditions. Since the friction in the flange area and die radius has the largest contribution to the drawing force, these parts of the tool will be adapted for the new tool design. In order to decrease the level of friction force in flange area for a given friction coefficient, the integral of the contact pressure over the contact area has to be reduced. This is achieved by macro structuring of the tool. The absence of lubricants in <b>drawing</b> <b>die</b> radius has to be compensated by tetrahedral amorphous carbon ta-C films, which combine low friction coefficients and anti-adhesive behaviour with a high hardness and wear resistance.
