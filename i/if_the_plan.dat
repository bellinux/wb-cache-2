5|$|As a precautionary move Alboin {{strengthened}} his {{alliance with}} the Avars, signing what Paul calls a foedus perpetuum ("perpetual treaty") and what is {{referred to in the}} 9th-century Historia Langobardorum codicis Gothani as a pactum et foedus amicitiae ("pact and treaty of friendship"), adding that the treaty was put down on paper. By the conditions accepted in the treaty, the Avars were to take possession of Pannonia and the Lombards were promised military support in Italy should the need arise; also, for a period of 200years the Lombards were to maintain the right to reclaim their former territories <b>if</b> <b>the</b> <b>plan</b> to conquer Italy failed, thus leaving Alboin with an alternative open. The accord also had the advantage of protecting Alboin's rear, as an Avar-occupied Pannonia would make it difficult for the Byzantines to bring forces to Italy by land. The agreement proved immensely successful, and relations with the Avars were almost uninterruptedly friendly during the lifetime of the Lombard Kingdom.|$|E
5|$|The conspirators practiced {{different}} ways of murdering Turner. According to informant statements to law enforcement, one of the conspirators was to pretend there was car trouble, and the others would then approach Turner with their guns. Informants later told law enforcement officials that the conspirators intended to hide out at an international network of Rajneesh communes <b>if</b> <b>the</b> <b>plan</b> was successful. According to The Oregonian the assassinations were not carried out because Ma Anand Sheela became distracted by political power plays within the Rajneesh commune {{and other members of}} the organization who were trying to remove her from her position within the group. And according to witness information, Ma Anand Sheela was persuaded not to carry out this action through conversations with Carol Matthews, who stated to her that this was not a solution in any way and would be a horrendous action.|$|E

25|$|Field Marshal Sir Douglas Haig, {{commander}} of the British Expeditionary Force (BEF) on the Western Front, had already agreed with Joffre that the British would launch wearing-out attacks in 1917, but demanded (6 January) written confirmation of Nivelle’s earlier assurance that <b>if</b> <b>the</b> <b>plan</b> {{did not succeed in}} forcing a general German withdrawal, Nivelle would take over British line to free up British reserves for his planned Flanders offensive. By Edward Spears’ account Nivelle accused Haig of having “une idée fixe” about Flanders and of trying to “hog all the blanket for himself” rather than seeing the front as a whole. David Lloyd George, the British Prime Minister, backed Nivelle because he thought he had “proved himself to be a Man” at Verdun.|$|E
25|$|On 27 January, Manstein {{was sacked}} as Chief of Staff of Army Group A and {{appointed}} commander {{of an army}} corps in East Prussia. To silence Manstein, Halder had instigated his transfer to Stettin on 9 February. Manstein's staff brought his case to Hitler, who had independently suggested an attack at Sedan, {{against the advice of}} OKH. On 2 February, Hitler was told of Manstein's plan and on 17 February, Hitler summoned Manstein, generals Rudolf Schmundt (Chief of Personnel of the German army) and Alfred Jodl, the Chief of Operations at Oberkommando der Wehrmacht (OKW, German armed forces high command), to attend a conference. The next day, Hitler ordered Manstein's thinking to be adopted, because it offered the possibility of decisive victory. Hitler recognised the breakthrough at Sedan only in tactical terms, whereas Manstein saw it as a means to an end. He envisaged an operation to the English Channel and the encirclement of the Allied armies in Belgium; <b>if</b> <b>the</b> <b>plan</b> succeeded, it could have a strategic effect.|$|E

25|$|London Underground has {{a history}} of {{building}} small batches of prototype trains in order to try out ideas, prior to building a large production run of new trains. Thus in 1935, four six-car trains were supplied by Metropolitan Cammell Carriage and Wagon Company, which were used as a test-bed for ideas which would be incorporated into the later 1938 stock, while in 1986, three trains, each of four cars and built by different manufacturers, were ordered with subsequent larger orders in mind. The 1960 stock was part of a similar solution, and consisted of twelve motor cars, built by Cravens of Sheffield, incorporating a number of features which it was anticipated would form the basis for a major batch of vehicles to replace the pre-1938 stock then in use on the Central line. <b>If</b> <b>the</b> <b>plan</b> had proceeded, a further 338 motor cars would have been built. However, assessment of the new features took longer than the time available, and the Central line refurbishment was achieved using 1962 stock, which was based on the previous batch of 1959 stock. Many of the design features of the 1960 stock were eventually incorporated into the 1967 stock built for the opening of the Victoria line.|$|E
25|$|Shortly after 6:00pm, {{word spread}} at Fort Tiuna that Chávez-loyalist General Carneiro was still seeking to {{implement}} Plan Ávila. Head {{of the army}} General Efraín Vásquez Velasco was meeting at the Army School with other officers concerned about Chávez's use of violence when Chávez ordered General Carneiro, one of Vásquez Velasco's subordinates, {{to go ahead with}} Plan Ávila. Vásquez Velasco, who founded the Office of Human Rights of the Venezuelan Army, knew that <b>if</b> <b>the</b> <b>plan</b> were implemented that he would be blamed since he {{was the head of the}} army. Soon after, General Vásquez Velasco learned that General Carneiro did not comply with his orders and was sending about 20 tanks to Miraflores to support Chávez. Vásquez Velasco called the tank commander ordering him to return with the commander complying with the general. General Vásquez Velasco then ordered a nationwide military lockdown with military movements requiring written documentation and approval, a move by Vásquez Velasco that was to prevent troops loyal to Chávez from suppressing the march and would also deter rebellious attacks from the military against Chávez. Vásquez Velasco then ordered the Chávez-loyalist General Carneiro be arrested before he could arrest the other officers under Chávez's orders, but Carneiro complied with Vásquez Velasco.|$|E
500|$|While no church {{from this}} {{age in the}} Slavic-populated parts of the Balkans was {{up-to-date}} with contemporary Byzantine architecture, the Round Church differs markedly because of its centralized, circular plan, which is unique in medieval Bulgarian architecture. The rounded and dynamic nature of its shapes is {{in contrast with the}} sharp rectangular designs of that period. [...] It is most likely based on the abundant examples of late Roman or early Byzantine buildings that lay ruined in the Bulgarian lands. The layout, particularly the rotunda, resembles churches from the time of Justinian I such as the Basilica of San Vitale in Ravenna, the Little Hagia Sophia in Constantinople (today Istanbul), and the Rotunda of Galerius in Thessaloniki.

500|$|In August 1794, a French ship {{captured}} in St. Domingo arrived in Halifax. A plan to house these prisoners in Halifax met with {{opposition from the}} citizenry because of a fear of [...] "fever"; indeed, surgeon John Halliburton suggested that <b>if</b> <b>the</b> <b>plan</b> was carried out, [...] "the popular would burn down [...] with the sick prisoners inside". Halliburton rented Kavanagh's Island, likely on the suggestion of Governor John Wentworth, and by June 1795 had sent 70 sick and wounded prisoners to its makeshift prison hospital. The other prisoners were kept on the La Felix prison ship. Sixteen soldiers of the Royal Nova Scotia Regiment acted as guards for the hospital beginning in 1796. Because of overcrowding aboard La Felix, some of its prisoners were allowed to live in Halifax, where some created such a disturbance that they were sent to Kavanagh's Island to be imprisoned. In 1801, the Treaty of Amiens resulted {{in most of the}} prisoners being returned to France, and the site was abandoned.|$|E

500|$|As McCarthy {{planned to}} visit Miami, Florida, Democratic bigwigs decided to stage their own {{rally in the}} state. It was unclear <b>if</b> <b>the</b> <b>plan</b> had {{developed}} from the White House, but diversionary tactics were used to take away attention from a McCarthy appearance when establishment Democrats scheduled a meeting of their own on the same days in Tallahassee. The purpose of McCarthy's visit was to campaign and begin discussion about the presidential nominating slate for the May 28 Florida primary. He discussed civil rights during the trip, remarking that [...] "it would take 30 to 50 years of constant action and concern to carry out all promises to the emancipated Negro who has been treated as a colonial people in America." [...] Following the speech, the Conference of Concerned Democrats unanimously decided to award him pledged delegates {{from the state of}} Florida. Meanwhile, an anonymous poll showed that no members of Congress described McCarthy as the strongest candidate for the Democratic nomination, with the majority naming President Johnson. However, he gained the endorsement of the Americans for Democratic Action, who failed to support an incumbent Democratic president {{for the first time in}} 20 years.

The Austrian center stood around San Bonifacio. Most of Eugène's army was deployed north of Arcole, though a few units lined {{the west bank of the}} Adige below the confluence of that river with the Alpone.
