Conversely, victims can intentionally leave crucial traces behind. In one case, a victim who <b>knew</b> <b>she</b> <b>was</b> <b>going</b> to be transported, allowed insects to bite her in hopes of being found and traced back to her area.|$|E
500|$|In December 2010, Keri {{confirmed}} a clean {{version of}} the song would be included on her album. Some lyrical modifications were made. The line [...] "I got the kind of pussy that'll keep you out the streets" [...] was replaced by [...] "I got the kind of lovin' that'll keep you out the streets", and the word [...] "fuck" [...] was replaced with the word [...] "thug", while in others it was removed altogether. Ross told Jason Rodriguez of MTV News: [...] "When I got the record, I most definitely <b>knew</b> <b>she</b> <b>was</b> <b>going</b> to another level and I was excited for [...] I {{love to see the}} creative side. She's a sexy female and I think she showed that. When I think of Janet Jackson when I was coming up and she was doing her Control thing, I loved it. So if that's the feeling that young people [...] or whoever is feeling the music, if that's the inspiration they get, I think it's dope." ...|$|E
500|$|Patrick Duffy, {{who would}} play Pamela's {{on-screen}} love, knew the part was ideal for Principal {{the minute he}} set his eyes on her. He recalled {{that one of the}} finalists for Pamela [...] "was a remarkably talented young actress from New York... really good. , in walked Victoria Principal with the tightest jeans I've ever seen and the most unbelievable blouse. I just went, 'Hello, Pam'. I <b>knew</b> <b>she</b> <b>was</b> <b>going</b> to be Pam Ewing." [...] Producer Michael Filerman (Knots Landing and Falcon Crest) offered insight, [...] "Principal really wanted that role...and worked very hard to get it. And there's a humanity about her that's just winning. And the camera likes her very much. The camera just loves her. That's real important." [...] During the pilot filming, Principal became very close with teenaged actress Charlene Tilton, who played Lucy Ewing. Principal explained that [...] "the location shooting was hard on Tilton, who was only seventeen and had never been away from home".|$|E

2500|$|The {{crossing}} gate struck {{the top of}} Brody's SUV before sliding down its rear and becoming stuck. Hope backed up to give her room to do the same. He instead saw Brody get out and walk to the rear, apparently trying to free it. [...] "What struck me was how calm she was—she didn't seem to be panicking, or in a hurry at all, even though the gate was down," [...] he said later. [...] "She wasn't in a hurry at all, {{but she had to}} have known that a train was coming." [...] Brody looked at him, and he motioned to her to come back in his direction, although he allows that she may not have seen him due to the glare from his headlights. Brody then returned to her vehicle and, according to Hope, seemed to pause as if she was adjusting her seat belt. The train was getting closer and the situation more urgent. [...] "The thing's dinging, red lights are flashing, it's going off," [...] he said. [...] "I just <b>knew</b> <b>she</b> <b>was</b> <b>going</b> to back up—never in my wildest dreams did I think she'd go forward." ...|$|E
2500|$|The character's [...] "scantily clad" [...] attire {{has been}} commented {{on in the}} British tabloid press, with Tony Stewart from [...] the Daily Mirror {{suggesting}} that Gemma Bissix might [...] "turn up in Albert Square starkers next". In May 2008, Clare was shown dressed as Princess Leia, and according to Stewart she looked like [...] "a porno version" [...] of the Star Wars character, [...] "in white hot pants and a skimpy top that [...] her galactic orbs to bounce about". In {{an article in the}} Daily Mail, the journalist suggested that the character had quickly made a name for herself [...] "thanks to her plunging necklines and knee-high boots [...] dressed in a tight, short silver dress and fishnet tights [...] her love of fitted clothes has attracted the attention of many of Albert Square's male residents." [...] Commenting on her character's revealing clothing, Bissix has said, [...] "I wasn't aware {{she was going to be}} so scantily clad. I <b>knew</b> <b>she</b> <b>was</b> <b>going</b> to be a minx but not that she was going to wear so little so often. Samantha Janus [...] told me she was in low-cut tops all the time when she started so I think it's a bit of an initiation." ...|$|E
2500|$|The {{character}} {{was featured in}} various other storylines, including a feud with Grant Mitchell (Ross Kemp); a tug-of-love for Ricky's affections with his first wife Sam Mitchell (Danniella Westbrook); a one-night stand with Lenny Wallace (Des Coleman), causing a sexually transmitted disease scare; {{and the death of}} her best friend Tiffany Mitchell (Martine McCutcheon). In November 1998, the BBC announced that Patsy Palmer had decided to leave EastEnders {{to spend more time with}} her family. The BBC said that Bianca would not be killed off, and a spokesman commented: [...] "Bianca has always been an amazingly powerful character and the door is open to her if she wants to return in the future. She has been fantastic in the years she has been in EastEnders and we will miss her." [...] Palmer was one of several high-profile EastEnders stars to announce their departures that year; McCutcheon and Kemp also decided to leave, and Gillian Taylforth left the serial in 1998 after 13 years playing Kathy Beale. The BBC said, [...] "no-one is bigger than the show, which is doing extremely well at the moment. We will send her off with all our very best wishes." [...] Richard Stokes, EastEnders series editor and producer of Palmer's exit storyline commented, [...] "you don't expect people to stay here for ever. But it's a double-edged sword. Yes, it's a shame when a well-loved character announces they're going, but the flipside is that it provides us with the space to do the best possible story. If someone is going, you can up the stakes. The whole of Bianca's story was developed once we <b>knew</b> <b>she</b> <b>was</b> <b>going</b> to go." ...|$|E

60|$|It rained heavily {{all the way}} to Bright River, {{to which}} station they had to go, since the branch line train from Carmody did not connect with the boat train. Charlie and Gilbert were on the station {{platform}} when they reached it, and the train was whistling. Anne had just time to get her ticket and trunk check, say a hurried farewell to Diana, and hasten on board. She wished she were going back with Diana to Avonlea; she <b>knew</b> <b>she</b> <b>was</b> <b>going</b> to die of homesickness. And oh, if only that dismal rain would stop pouring down as if the whole world were weeping over summer vanished and joys departed! Even Gilbert's presence brought her no comfort, for Charlie Sloane was there, too, and Sloanishness could be tolerated only in fine weather. It was absolutely insufferable in rain.|$|E
6000|$|At {{this point}} {{there came a}} sound from within the marquee as of skirts {{sweeping}} forward sharply, imperiously, followed by a softer frou-frou, and Mrs. Thrall put aside the curtain of the tent with one hand, and stood challenging our little Altrurian group, while Lady Moors peered timidly at us from over her mother's shoulder. I felt a lust of battle rising in me at sight of that woman, {{and it was as}} much as I could do to control myself; but in view of the bad time I <b>knew</b> <b>she</b> <b>was</b> <b>going</b> to have, I managed to hold in, though I joined very scantly in the polite greetings of the Chrysostoms and Aristides, which she ignored {{as if they had been}} the salutations of savages. She glared at her husband for explanation, and he said, gently, [...] "This is a delegation from the Altrurian capital, my dear, and we have been talking over the situation together." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "You {{might have}} thought," [...] went on Robina, [...] "that she was {{dressing}} {{for her own}} funeral. She said she <b>knew</b> <b>she</b> <b>was</b> <b>going</b> to catch her death of cold, sitting on the wet grass. Something told her. I reminded her it hadn't rained for three weeks, and that everything was as dry as a bone, but she said that made no difference to grass. There is always a moisture in grass, and that cushions and all that only helped to draw it out. Not that it mattered. The end had to come, and {{so long as the}} others were happy--you know her style. Nobody ever thought of her. She was to be dragged here, dragged there. She talked about herself as if she were some sacred image. It got upon my nerves at last, so that I persuaded Janie to let me offer to stop at home with her. I wasn't too keen about going myself; not by that time." ...|$|E

60|$|Jim {{was a new}} type, and she {{admitted}} that he attracted her, but his attraction was largely physical and sometimes she felt repelled. He was handsome and forceful; she liked his steady look, his athletic figure, and his clean brown skin. Then she liked the respect he showed her and his obvious wish to please. This was flattering and his strength and candor made an appeal, but she was highly cultivated {{and he was not}} rude. Indeed, when he stood on the bank, hot and triumphant after the fight, there was something barbarous about him. His virility moved her, but to live with him would demand some pluck; Evelyn knew he could not, so to speak, be tamed. His refusal to come to Dryholm, when he <b>knew</b> <b>she</b> <b>was</b> <b>going,</b> was a proof. It was significant that the dam he was building made a stronger claim. Evelyn was drawn in different ways and, on the whole, it was a relief when Mrs. Halliday came in.|$|E
60|$|Miss Cornelia it was; moreover, Miss Cornelia had {{not come}} to make any brief and fashionable wedding call. She had her work under her arm in a {{substantial}} parcel, and when Anne asked her to stay she promptly took off her capacious sun-hat, which had been held on her head, despite irreverent September breezes, by a tight elastic band under her hard little knob of fair hair. No hat pins for Miss Cornelia, an it please ye! Elastic bands had been good enough for her mother and they were good enough for HER. She had a fresh, round, pink-and-white face, and jolly brown eyes. She did not look in the least like the traditional old maid, {{and there was something}} in her expression which won Anne instantly. With her old instinctive quickness to discern kindred spirits she <b>knew</b> <b>she</b> <b>was</b> <b>going</b> to like Miss Cornelia, in spite of uncertain oddities of opinion, and certain oddities of attire.|$|E

Louise returned my affection, but her mother, learning of my quarrel with my father, refused to sanction our engagement until I was acknowledged his heir. I was forbidden her house, but naturally we met elsewhere, and when I <b>knew</b> <b>she</b> <b>was</b> <b>going</b> to Europe with you, sir, who had never seen me, we hit upon {{what we thought was}} a happy and innocent plan to avoid the long separation. I decided to go to Europe also, and without you or your other nieces suspecting, my identity, attach myself to your party and enjoy the society of Louise while she remained abroad. So I followed you on the next ship and met you at Sorrento, where I introduced myself as Count Ferralti--a name we had agreed I should assume before we parted in America.|$|E

6000|$|Aunt Polly's {{happiness}} was complete, and Mrs. Thatcher's nearly so. It {{would be}} complete, however, {{as soon as}} the messenger dispatched with the great news to the cave should get the word to her husband. Tom lay upon a sofa with an eager auditory about him and told the history of the wonderful adventure, putting in many striking additions to adorn it withal; and closed with a description of how he left Becky and went on an exploring expedition; how he followed two avenues as far as his kite-line would reach; how he followed a third to the fullest stretch of the kite-line, and was about to turn back when he glimpsed a far-off speck that looked like daylight; dropped the line and groped toward it, pushed his head and shoulders through a small hole, and saw the broad Mississippi rolling by! And if it had only happened to be night he would not have seen that speck of daylight and would not have explored that passage any more! He told how he went back for Becky and broke the good news and she told him not to fret her with such stuff, for she was tired, and <b>knew</b> <b>she</b> <b>was</b> <b>going</b> to die, and wanted to. He described how he labored with her and convinced her; and how she almost died for joy when she had groped to where she actually saw the blue speck of daylight; how he pushed his way out at the hole and then helped her out; how they sat there and cried for gladness; how some men came along in a skiff and Tom hailed them and told them their situation and their famished condition; how the men didn't believe the wild tale at first, [...] "because," [...] said they, [...] "you are five miles down the river below the valley the cave is in" [...] --then took them aboard, rowed to a house, gave them supper, made them rest till two or three hours after dark and then brought them home.|$|E
