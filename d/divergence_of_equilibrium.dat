40|$|We use {{computer}} simulations {{to study the}} glass transition of dense fluids made of polydisperse, repulsive spheres. For hard particles, we vary the volume fraction, phi, and use compressible particles to explore finite temperatures, T> 0. In the hard sphere limit, our dynamic data show evidence of an avoided mode-coupling singularity near phi_MCT 0. 592, they are consistent with a <b>divergence</b> <b>of</b> <b>equilibrium</b> relaxation times occurring at phi_ 0 0. 635, but they leave open {{the existence of a}} finite temperature singularity for compressible spheres at volume fraction phi > phi_ 0. Using direct measurements and a new scaling procedure, we estimate the equilibrium equation of state for the hard sphere metastable fluid up to phi_ 0, where pressure remains finite, suggesting that phi_ 0 corresponds to an ideal glass transition. We use non-equilibrium protocols to explore glassy states above phi_ 0 and establish the existence of multiple equations of state for the unequilibrated glass of hard spheres, all diverging at different densities in the range phi ∈ [0. 642, 0. 664]. Glassiness thus results in the existence of a continuum of densities where jamming transitions can occur. Comment: 16 pages; 7 figure...|$|E

40|$|In this paper, we {{extend the}} basic {{model of the}} {{restricted}} four-body problem introducing two bigger dominant primaries m_ 1 and m_ 2 as oblate spheroids when masses of the two primary bodies (m_ 2 and m_ 3) are equal. The {{aim of this study}} is to investigate the use of zero velocity surfaces and the Poincaré surfaces of section to determine the possible allowed boundary regions and the stability orbit <b>of</b> the <b>equilibrium</b> points. According to different values of Jacobi constant C, we can determine boundary region where the particle can move in possible permitted zones. The stability regions <b>of</b> the <b>equilibrium</b> points expanded due to presence of oblateness coefficient and various values of C, whereas for certain range of t (100 < t < 200), orbits form a shape of cote's spiral. For different values of oblateness parameters A_ 1 (0 <A_ 1 < 1) and A_ 2 (0 <A_ 2 < 1), we obtain two collinear and six non-collinear equilibrium points. The non-collinear equilibrium points are stable when the mass parameter μ lies in the interval (0. 0190637, 0. 647603). However, basins of attraction are constructed with the help of Newton Raphson method to demonstrate the convergence as well as <b>divergence</b> region <b>of</b> the <b>equilibrium</b> points. The nature of basins of attraction <b>of</b> the <b>equilibrium</b> points are less effected in presence and absence of oblateness coefficients A_ 1 and A_ 2 respectively in the proposed model.

40|$|Traits {{that cause}} assortative mating {{such as the}} {{flowering}} time in plants and body size in animals can produce reproductive isolation between hybridizing populations. Can selection against unfit hybrids cause two populations to diverge in their mean values {{for these kinds of}} traits? Here I present a haploid analytical model of one population that receives gene flow from another. The partial pre-zygotic isolation between the two populations is caused by assortative mating for a trait that is influenced by any number of genes with additive effects. The post-zygotic isolation is caused by selection against genetic incompatibilities that can involve any form of selection on individual genes and gene combinations (epistasis). The analysis assumes that the introgression rate and selection coefficients are small. The results show that the assortment trait mean will not diverge from the immigrants unless there is direct selection on the trait favouring it to do so or there are genes of very large effect. The amount <b>of</b> <b>divergence</b> at <b>equilibrium</b> is determined by a balance between direct selection on the assortment trait and introgression from the other population. Additional selection against hybrid genetic incompatibilities reduces the effective migration rate and allows greater <b>divergence.</b> The role <b>of</b> assortment in speciation is discussed in the light of these results...|$|R

40|$|We {{study the}} {{thermodynamics}} and thermodynamic geometry of a five-dimensional Reissner-Nordström-AdS {{black hole in}} the extended phase space by treating the cosmological constant as being related {{to the number of}} colors in the boundary gauge theory and its conjugate quantity as the associated chemical potential. It is found that the contribution of the charge of the black hole to the chemical potential is always positive and the existence of charge make the chemical potential become positive more easily. We calculate the scalar curvatures of the thermodynamical Weinhold metric, Ruppeiner metric and Quevedo metric, respectively, in the fixed N^ 2 case and the fixed q case. It is found that in the fixed N^ 2 case the <b>divergence</b> <b>of</b> the scalar curvature is related to the <b>divergence</b> <b>of</b> the specific heat with fixed electric potential in the Weinhold metric and Ruppeiner metric, and the <b>divergence</b> <b>of</b> the scalar curvature in the Quevedo metric corresponds to the <b>divergence</b> <b>of</b> the specific heat with fixed electric charge density. In the fixed q case, however, the <b>divergence</b> <b>of</b> the scalar curvature is related to the <b>divergence</b> <b>of</b> the specific heat with fixed chemical potential in the Weinhold metric and Ruppeiner metric, while in the Quevedo metric the <b>divergence</b> <b>of</b> the scalar curvature corresponds to the <b>divergence</b> <b>of</b> the specific heat with fixed number of colors and the vanishing of the specific heat with fixed chemical potential.

40|$|This paper {{introduces}} the concept <b>of</b> <b>divergence</b> <b>of</b> sentiment to the behavioral finance literature. We measure {{the distance between}} people with positive and negative sentiment {{on a daily basis}} for 20 countries by using data from status updates on Facebook. The prediction is that a higher <b>divergence</b> <b>of</b> sentiment leads to more diverging views on prospects and risks, and thus to more diverging views on the value of a stock. In line with this prediction, <b>divergence</b> <b>of</b> sentiment is positively related to trading volume. We further predict and find a positive relation between <b>divergence</b> <b>of</b> sentiment and stock price volatility. The observed relations are stronger when individual investors are more likely to trade. We compare the effect of our country-specific measures to a global measure <b>of</b> <b>divergence</b> <b>of</b> sentiment. We find that the separate effects of country-specific and global divergence measures depend on a country's level of market integration...|$|R
40|$|Inspired by {{the concept}} of {{trajectory}} sensitivity of dynamic systems {{and based on the}} knowledge of domain of attraction and asymptotic stability of dynamic systems, the authors proposed a new principle {{that could be used to}} aid in judging power system transient stability. It could be known from this principle that whether an initial point lied in the domain of attraction <b>of</b> an <b>equilibrium</b> point <b>of</b> autonomous nonlinear dynamic systems or not was able to be decided by the asymptotic stability <b>of</b> <b>equilibrium</b> point <b>of</b> its linearized system, which had a lot of 'good' properties that could be exploited. A positive constant was defined as the acceleration factor of the linear system, which could accelerate the convergence or <b>divergence</b> <b>of</b> this system so as to decrease the simulation time of the power system dynamics for transient stability analysis. Results of applying the proposed principle to single-machine infinitive-bus system and multi-machine system show that this principle is correct and feasible. link_to_subscribed_fulltex...|$|R

We measure surface and bulk deformation of a thin elastic film near a three-phase contact line using fluorescence confocal microscopy. The out-of-plane deformation is well fit by a linear elastic theory incorporating an out-of-plane restoring force due to the surface tension of the gel. This theory predicts that the deformation profile near the contact line is scale-free and independent of the substrate elastic modulus. Comment: 4 pages, 3 figure...|$|R
