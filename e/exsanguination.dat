40|$|SummaryA 69 -year-old {{woman with}} a history of graft {{replacement}} of descending aortic aneurysm was referred to our hospital due to massive hematemesis with shock status. Additionally, the deterioration of respiratory status made us start the management under mechanical ventilation. The emergent gastrointestinal endoscopy by a general practitioner showed ulcer-like lesion of the upper esophagus and arterial bleeding. A contrast-enhanced computed tomography showed thoracic aortic aneurysm surrounded by low density mass and contrast medium protruding from the aneurysm. The findings suggested that thoracic aortic aneurysm perforated into esophagus and made an aortoesophageal fistula. Hemodynamic deterioration rapidly progressed and she passed away 4 days after her hospitalization. Autopsy showed that a new thoracic aortic aneurysm arose from the proximal site of the graft. The aneurysm ruptured to esophagus with 6. 0 cm× 5. 0 cm sized fistula. The fistula was filled with a large thrombus. The large thrombus filling with the fistula worked as the tamponade and prevented her from the fatal <b>exsanguinations</b> and sudden death. The mechanism of the sentinel bleeding and the fatal <b>exsanguinations</b> known as Chiari's triad was revealed in our report...|$|R
40|$|BACKGROUND: The Philippine General Hospital (PGH) is {{the pioneer}} in trauma {{care in the}} country, being the first to create a {{dedicated}} Trauma Service in 1989. The service has not conducted a review of its admissions and mortalities since 1992. The {{purpose of this study}} is to describe the mortality patterns of this service. METHODS: A descriptive and retrospective 3 -year review, covering January 2004 June 2007, was conducted using an electronic patient database. Review of patient records included: population demographics, mechanism of injury, length of stay prior to death, and the cause of death. RESULTS: Of the 4947 patients admitted to the Division of Trauma during the study period, there were 231 (4. 7 %) deaths. The most common mechanisms of injuries were stab wounds (32. 9 %), vehicular crashes (28. 6 %), and gunshot wounds (25. 5 %). Multiple organ failure/Sepsis (37. 7 %) was the most frequent causes of death, followed by <b>Exsanguinations</b> (27. 7 %), Central Nervous System failure (18. 6 %) and other causes (10. 8 %). Forty four (66. 7 %) of the 66 patients who died within the first 24 hours died from <b>Exsanguinations,</b> while 66 (61. 1 %) of the 8 patients who died after 72 hours died from Multiple organ failure/Sepsis. CONCLUSIONS: Intentional causes of injury (i. e. penetrating interpersonal violence) caused the majority of trauma deaths in this series from the Philippine General Hospital. This highlights the need for prioritizing a public health approach to violence prevention in the Philippines. Further research must be conducted to identify risk factors for interpersonal violence. Early identification of lethal injuries that may cause <b>exsanguinations</b> and definitive control of hemorrhage should be the primary focus to prevent acute deaths, within 24 hours of admission. Further adjuncts to the definitive treatment of hemorrhage, the critical care of TBI and MOF/Sepsis are needed to reduce deaths occurring more than 72 hours after admission...|$|R

40|$|Melanocortin- 4 {{receptor}} (MC 4 R) is a G-protein coupled receptor predominantly {{expressed in}} hypothalamic regions which {{are known for}} their roles in feeding behavior, energy homeostasis and HPA axis regulation. In this study, we analyzed the effect of a missense mutation (Asp 298 Asn) in the porcine MC 4 R gene on physiological stress response and carcass composition in pigs of two crosses: A (♀Duroc x ♂Swedish Landrace) x ♂Pietrain (n= 25) and B (♀Swedish Landrace x ♂Large White) x ♂Pietrain (n= 21). All pigs included in this study were heterozygous (Nn) for the stress syndrome gen. Blood samples were collected before loading and at <b>exsanguinations</b> to measure cortisol, lactate, glucose, serum enzymes activity and some haematological parameters. Because only one pig with AA genotype was observed, there was no indicated effect of this genotype on investigated parameters. The heterozygous (AG) pigs showed a lower increase (P< 0. 05) in CK and AST activity after <b>exsanguinations</b> as well as trend towards lower increase (P< 0. 10) in cortisol and lactate levels and higher increase (P< 0. 10) in RBC and haemoglobin content. Higher increase (P< 0. 05) in LDH activity was observed in GG homozygous pigs from group B, but not in pigs from group A. In addition, the heterozygous (AG) pigs had a higher backfat thickness and lower estimated lean (P< 0. 05) than homozygous (GG) pigs.

25|$|A {{tourniquet}} can {{be defined}} as a constricting or compressing device used to control arterial and venous blood flow to a portion of an extremity for a period of time. Pressure is applied circumferentially around a portion of a limb at a desired location; this pressure is transferred to the walls of blood vessels, causing them to become temporarily occluded or restricted. In surgical settings, a tourniquet is used to occlude arterial blood flow following <b>exsanguination</b> to produce a relatively bloodless operative field and to minimize blood loss. In emergency settings, a tourniquet is used stop traumatic bleeding such that medical care can be provided in time before the injured person bleeds out. In rehabilitation settings, a tourniquet is used to restrict arterial blood flow at a consistent and safe pressure for short periods of time during low intensity exercise to more rapidly increase muscle size and strength.|$|E
25|$|Eating meat : Both {{initiated}} and uninitiated Sikhs {{are strictly}} prohibited from eating meat from animals slaughtered by halal method, known as Kutha meat, where {{the animal is}} killed by <b>exsanguination</b> (via throat-cutting). According to Eleanor Nesbitt, the general issue of vegetarianism versus non-vegetarianism is controversial within Sikhism, and contemporary Sikhs disagree. The ban on kutha meat, along with ban on any sexual relations with Muslims and a ban on smoking habit common among 18th-century Indian Muslims, states Nesbitt, {{was a part of}} Sikh Guru's efforts to socially isolate Muslims. Amritdhari Sikhs, or those baptised with the Amrit, have been strict vegetarians, abstaining from all meat and eggs. Sikhs who eat meat seek the Jhatka method of producing meat believing it to cause less suffering to the animal. The uninitiated Sikhs too are not habitual meat-eaters by choice, and beef (cow meat) has been a traditional taboo. Typically meat is not served in community free meals such as langar.|$|E
25|$|In the 2000s, {{the silicon}} ring tourniquet, or elastic ring tourniquet, was {{developed}} by Dr. Noam Gavriely, {{a professor of medicine}} and former emergency physician. The tourniquet consists of an elastic ring made of silicone, stockinet, and pull straps made from ribbon that are used to roll the device onto the limb. The silicone ring tourniquet exsanguinates the blood from the limb while the device is being rolled on, and then occludes the limb once the desired occlusion location is reached. Unlike the historical mechanical tourniquets, the device reduces the risk of nerve paralysis. The surgical tourniquet version of the device is completely sterile, and provides improved surgical accessibility due to its narrow profile that results in a larger surgical field. It {{has been found to be}} a safe alternative method for most orthopedic limb procedures, but it does not completely replace the use of contemporary tourniquet devices. More recently the silicone ring tourniquet has been used in the fields of emergency medicine and vascular procedures. Recently, Feldman et. al. reported 2 cases of pulmonary embolism after silicon ring tourniquet application in patients with traumatic injuries. The serious and potentially fatal complication was reported involving procedures performed on the lower limb when silicone ring tourniquet was used for <b>exsanguination</b> on the affected limb.|$|E

2500|$|Vasa previa {{is present}} when {{unprotected}} fetal vessels traverse the fetal membranes over the internal cervical os. These vessels may be from either a velamentous insertion of {{the umbilical cord}} or may be joining an accessory (succenturiate) placental lobe to the main disk of the placenta. If these fetal vessels rupture the bleeding is from the fetoplacental circulation, and fetal <b>exsanguination</b> will rapidly occur, leading to fetal death. It is thought that vasa previa arises from an early placenta previa. As the pregnancy progresses, the placenta tissue surrounding the vessels over the cervix undergoes atrophy, and the placenta grows preferentially toward the upper portion of the uterus. This leaves unprotected vessels running over the cervix and in the lower uterine segment. This has been demonstrated using serial ultrasound. Oyelese et al. found that 2/3 of patient with vasa previa at delivery had a low-lying placenta or placenta previa that resolved prior {{to the time of}} delivery.|$|E
2500|$|In {{situations}} where direct pressure and elevation are either not possible or proving ineffective, {{and there is}} a risk of <b>exsanguination,</b> some training protocols advocate the use of pressure points to constrict the major artery that feeds the point of the bleed. [...] This is usually performed at a place where a pulse can be found, such as in the femoral artery. [...] There are significant risks involved in performing pressure point constriction, including necrosis of the area below the constriction, and most protocols give a maximum time for constriction (often around 10 minutes). [...] There is particularly high danger if constricting the carotid artery in the neck, as the brain is sensitive to hypoxia and brain damage can result within minutes of application of pressure. Pressure on the carotid artery can also cause vagal tone induced bradycardia, which can eventually stop the heart. Other dangers in use of a constricting method include rhabdomyolysis, which is a buildup of toxins below the pressure point, which if released back into the main bloodstream may cause renal failure.|$|E

However, the high prevalence of FVL (up to 15 %) in the general population suggests that it has given an evolutionary advantage. In this review, we discuss possible mechanisms of the evolutionary survival advantage associated with FVL.
