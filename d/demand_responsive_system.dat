40|$|Abstract — In this paper, {{we argue}} that a {{large-scale}} <b>demand</b> <b>responsive</b> <b>system</b> is the missing element from the spectrum of the urban transport modes. To this end, we provide a comprehensive analysis addressing this broad question from several aspects including the customers ’ perception, various technical aspects, and the related societal aspects. In each case, {{we are able to}} give sound arguments why a mass demand responsive transport (DRT) service can improve the current situation considerably. The mass DRT will not make other transport modes obsolete, but can complement them in surprisingly efficient manner leading to considerable internal and external cost savings – a true win-win situation the modern computer and information technology has enabled.

40|$|This paper {{introduces}} {{an innovative}} transportation concept called Flexible Mobility on Demand (FMOD), which provides personalized services to passengers. FMOD is a <b>demand</b> <b>responsive</b> <b>system</b> {{in which a}} list of travel options is provided in real-time to each passenger request. The system provides passengers with flexibility to choose from a menu that is optimized in an assortment optimization framework. For operators, there is flexibility in terms of vehicle allocation to di erent service types: taxi, shared-taxi and mini-bus. The allocation of the available fleet to these three services is carried out dynamically and based on demand and supply so that vehicles can change roles during the day. The FMOD system {{is built based on}} a choice model and consumer surplus is taken into account in order to improve the passenger satisfaction. Furthermore, pro fits of the operators are expected to increase since the system adapts to changing demand patterns. In this paper, we introduce the concept of FMOD and present preliminary simulation results that quantify the added value of this system.

40|$|This paper {{presents}} a preliminary {{study of the}} feasibility of checkpoint dial-a-ride systems. Their cost-effectiveness is {{compared to that of}} fixed route systems with no transfers and door-to-door dial-a-ride systems. The results are derived for a simple routing strategy, and involve some simplifications which facilitate the comparisons. For high demand levels, the total cost per passenger for fixed route and checkpoint systems is very close. In fact, their optimal configurations are so alike, and the occurrence of route deviations is so rare, that fixed route systems should be preferred, as they can be operated on a schedule and require less dispatching effort. As the demand level decreases, <b>demand</b> <b>responsive</b> <b>systems</b> become relatively more attractive than fixed route systems, and checkpoint systems might possibly become cost-effective. However, by the time <b>demand</b> <b>responsive</b> <b>systems</b> are significantly better than fixed route systems, door-to-door service can be provided at an even lower cost. This appears to limit the situations where checkpoint dial-a-ride systems can be applied efficiently to a small window of demand levels (and special situations) where they only narrowly outperform other systems. ...|$|R

40|$|AbstractThe {{realization}} of innovative transport services requires greater flexibility and inexpensive service. In {{many cases the}} solution is to realize <b>demand</b> <b>responsive</b> transportation <b>system.</b> A <b>Demand</b> <b>Responsive</b> Transport <b>System</b> (DRTS) requires the planning of travel paths (routing) and customer pick-up and drop-off times (scheduling) according to received requests. In particular, the problem has to deal with multiple vehicles, limited capacity of the fleet vehicles and temporal constraints (time windows). A DRTS may operate according to static or dynamic mode. In the static setting, all the customer requests are known beforehand and the DRTS solves a Dial-a-Ride Problem (DaRP) instance, to produce the tour of each bus, respecting the pick up and delivery time windows while minimising the solution cost. In the dynamic mode, the customer requests arrive over time to a control station and, consequently, the solution may also change over time. In this work, we address a <b>Demand</b> <b>Responsive</b> Transport <b>System</b> capable of managing incoming transport demand using a two-stage algorithm by solving a DaRP instance. The solutions provided by the heuristics are simulated in a discrete events environment in which it is possible to reproduce the movement of the buses, the passengers’ arrival to the stops, the delays due to the traffic congestion and possible anomalies in the behaviour of the passengers. Finally, a set of performance indicators evaluate the solution planned by the heuristics...|$|R

40|$|The {{provision}} of traditional public transport services {{in rural areas}} have shown to be very inefficient and ineffective. In fact, rural areas are naturally categorized by low levels of population density leading to complex demand patterns (low levels and high spatial and temporal dispersion), which leads to low levels of service of conventional transport services (low frequencies, usage of old vehicles, etc). <b>Demand</b> <b>Responsive</b> Transport <b>systems</b> {{have been seen as}} an effective alternative solution already adopted in several countries.

40|$|This {{dissertation}} {{begins with}} proposing a novel street Connectivity Indicator (C. I.) to predict transit performance {{by identifying the}} role that street network connectivity plays in influencing the service quality of <b>demand</b> <b>responsive</b> feeder transit services. This new C. I. definition is dependent upon the expected shortest path between any two nodes in the network, includes spatial features with transit demand distribution information and is easy to calculate for any given service area. Subsequently, a methodology to identify and locate critical links within a grid street system for operating feeder transit services is also developed. A 'critical' street link causes the largest change in transit performance due to the link's removal or addition to an existing network. The most important contribution of this section on link criticality is to present a simple closed-form analytical formula in locating the critical link(s) for a grid street network system of 'any' size. Easily computable formulas have been provided and validated by simulation analyses. Another related model is proposed to compute the optimal grid street spacing that would enhance performance of a <b>demand</b> <b>responsive</b> feeder transit <b>system.</b> The model is tested using simulation. Lastly, an analytical model is also developed for estimating optimal service cycle length or headway of a <b>demand</b> <b>responsive</b> feeder transit service designed to serve passengers, especially during peak periods of demand. Simulation analyses over a range of networks have been conducted to validate the new C. I. definition. Results show a desirable monotonic relationship between transit performance and the proposed C. I., whose values are directly proportional and therefore good predictors of the transit performance, outperforming other available indicators, typically used by planners. Further, useful insights indicate a monotonic decrease in link criticality as we depart from the centrally located links to those located at boundaries. Using a real case example from Denver of the Call-n-Ride system operating similar to a <b>demand</b> <b>responsive</b> feeder transit, optimal cycle lengths differed very modestly from those computed using the model.

40|$|These days, automation, {{digitalization}} {{and mobile}} application are driving {{forces in the}} development of innovations in public transportation. Interactive digital approaches like serious games are a promising way to introduce new mobility services to the public in a contemporary manner. The trend towards a flexibilization of life- and workstyles entails a growing demand for individualized and more flexible forms of personal mobility. People no longer want to adapt their need for mobility to fixed schedules of public transport. The emergence of new mobility services that are based on reservation and payment via mobile devices, for example Car 2 Go (carsharing), CallaBike (bikesharing), Uber (ride sharing) or BlaBlaCar (carpooling), proves the need for demand driven mobility services. A growing flexibility can be expected to be accompanied by an increase in the inherent complexity of mobility services. This results in an increasing relevance of users’ information requirements that have to be incorporated in mobility services to enable planning and projection of routes and arrivals. An insufficient provision of information about how to use the mobility service or the absence of a transparent and understandable information environment could create usage barriers that cause a refusal of the mobility service. New mobility systems need to be systematically introduced to the prospective users. To improve users’ conceptual understanding of a new <b>demand</b> <b>responsive</b> transport <b>system</b> a serious game is developed by the authors.
