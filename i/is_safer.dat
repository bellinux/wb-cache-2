5|$|Phenformin, another biguanide, was {{withdrawn}} from the market because of {{an increased risk of}} lactic acidosis (rate of 40-64 per 100,000 patient-years). However, metformin <b>is</b> <b>safer</b> than phenformin, and the risk of developing lactic acidosis is not increased except for known high-risk groups.|$|E
5|$|Modern Leslie {{speakers}} have an 11-pin interface that <b>is</b> <b>safer</b> to service, as {{the mains}} power is carried separately using a standard IEC mains connector. The Hammond-Suzuki Leslie 2101 also includes line in and line out jacks, so a combo preamp {{is no longer}} required. Its settings can also be controlled via MIDI.|$|E

5|$|The {{greatest}} risk in flying is in takeoff and landing, meaning that longer aircraft trips are safer per mile. Commuter planes used on shorter flights have higher risk than larger jet aircraft. Driving on U.S. Interstate highways, which {{are almost always}} controlled-access divided highways, <b>is</b> <b>safer</b> than driving on most other roads and highways.|$|E
5|$|Briseis, {{at least}} for now, is equally {{affected}} {{by the possibility of}} separation from her lover. Troilus goes to her room and they spend the night together, trying to comfort each other. Troilus is part of the escort to hand her over the next day. Once she is with the Greeks, Diomedes is immediately struck by her beauty. Although she is not hostile, she cannot accept him as her lover. Meanwhile Calchas tells her to accept for herself that the gods have decreed Troy's fall and that she <b>is</b> <b>safer</b> now she is with the Greeks.|$|E
5|$|The Knight on c6 <b>is</b> <b>safer</b> than on g6, and is well-placed {{as part of}} {{a general}} {{strategy}} to control the central dark squares. It can go to d4 while the other Knight can go to c5 via a6 or d7. After 6.Nf3 Bc5 White has difficulties castling short, because the plan to exchange the dark-squared bishops with Bd3/Qe2/Be3 can be met by Bg4/Nd4 to muddy the waters. As Lalic points out:White can no longer castle kingside and will usually have to go the other way. However, this is rather slow and gives Black time to try to undermine the white centre. To this end Bc8â€“g4 often comes in handy, in order to pin the white knight on f3 against the white queen. Note that Black should wait until his opponent has wasted a tempo with Qe2.|$|E

25|$|The first {{vaccine is}} {{administered}} at infancy. The baby is injected with the DTaP vaccine which is 3 inactive toxins in one injection. DTaP protects against diphtheria, pertussis, and tetanus. This vaccine <b>is</b> <b>safer</b> than the previously used DTP.|$|E
25|$|According {{to recent}} {{research}} on the British Columbia halibut fishery, where the commons has been at least partly privatized, substantial ecological and economic benefits have resulted. There is less damage to fish stocks, the fishing <b>is</b> <b>safer,</b> and fewer resources are needed to achieve a given harvest.|$|E
25|$|Thus, DA {{means that}} a cocking action {{separate}} from the trigger pull is unnecessary; every trigger pull {{will result in a}} complete cycle. This allows uncocked carry, while also allowing draw-and-fire using only the trigger. A longer and harder trigger stroke is the trade-off. However, this drawback can also be viewed as a safety feature, as the gun <b>is</b> <b>safer</b> against accidental discharges from being dropped.|$|E

25|$|Bondage <b>is</b> <b>safer</b> when {{conducted}} between sober, trusted {{partners who}} are {{fully aware of}} the risks involved and the precautions necessary to ensure safety, such as informed consent. Partners who are in committed relationships may have a greater basis for trusting each other. Performing acts in a supervised location, such as a dungeon, or with a group of trusted friends may also increase safety.|$|E
25|$|Finally, the stag hunt game in Fig. 5 shows a {{situation}} in which both players (hunters) can benefit if they cooperate (hunting a stag). However, cooperation might fail, because each hunter has an alternative which <b>is</b> <b>safer</b> because it does not require cooperation to succeed (hunting a hare). This example of the potential conflict between safety and social cooperation is originally due to Jean-Jacques Rousseau.|$|E
25|$|Nesting {{most often}} occurs at night for {{protection}} from predators. The prime season for nesting is from December to June, butr peak months are January through March. Females are uneasy when coming ashore. If they feel threatened, they return to the water and wait until the shore <b>is</b> <b>safer.</b> Approximately two months after nesting the hatchlings emerge. They are around 46mm long when hatched, smaller than other Chelonia hatchlings.|$|E

25|$|The {{surgical}} procedure {{most often used}} to implant the device is called mastoidectomy with facial recess approach (MFRA). If a person's individual anatomy prevents MFRA, other approaches, such as through the suprameatal triangle are used. A systematic literature review published in 2016 found that studies comparing the two approaches were generally small, not randomized, and retrospective so were not useful for making generalizations; {{it is not known}} which approach <b>is</b> <b>safer</b> or more effective.|$|E
25|$|Germany {{has brought}} the U-boat name into the 21st century with the new Type 212. The 212 {{features}} an air-independent propulsion system using hydrogen fuel cells. This system <b>is</b> <b>safer</b> than previous closed-cycle diesel engines and steam turbines, cheaper than a nuclear reactor and quieter than either. While the Type 212 is also being purchased by Italy, the Type 214 has been designed as the follow-on export model and has been sold to Greece, South Korea and Turkey.|$|E
25|$|The patient being {{examined}} or treated is usually awake during catheterization, ideally with only local anaesthesia such as lidocaine and minimal general sedation, throughout the procedure. Performing the procedure {{with the patient}} awake <b>is</b> <b>safer</b> as the patient can immediately report any discomfort or problems and thereby facilitate rapid correction of any undesirable events. Medical monitors fail to give a comprehensive view of the patient's immediate well-being; how the patient feels is often a most reliable indicator of procedural safety.|$|E

25|$|The EV Plug Alliance is an {{association}} of 21 European manufacturers which proposes an alternative connecting solution. The project is to impose an IEC norm and to adopt a European standard for the connection solution with sockets and plugs for electric vehicle charging infrastructure. Members (Schneider Electric, Legrand, Scame, Nexans, etc.) argue that the system <b>is</b> <b>safer</b> because they use shutters. General consensus is that the IEC 62196 and IEC 61851-1 already {{have taken care of}} safety by making parts non-live when touchable.|$|E
25|$|Despite this, Everest <b>is</b> <b>safer</b> for climbers than {{a number}} of peaks by some measurements, but {{it depends on the}} period. Some {{examples}} are Kangchenjunga, K2, Annapurna, Nanga Parbat, and the Eiger (especially the nordwand). Mont Blanc has more deaths each year than Everest, with over one hundred dying in a typical year and over eight thousand killed since records were kept. Some factors that affect total mountain lethality include the level of popularity of the mountain, the skill of those climbing, and of course the difficulty of the climb.|$|E
25|$|Another form {{of salmon}} production, which <b>is</b> <b>safer</b> but less controllable, {{is to raise}} salmon in {{hatcheries}} until they {{are old enough to}} become independent. They are released into rivers in an attempt to increase the salmon population. This system is referred to as ranching. It was very common in countries such as Sweden, before the Norwegians developed salmon farming, but is seldom done by private companies. As anyone may catch the salmon when they return to spawn, a company is limited in benefiting financially from their investment.|$|E
