500|$|The {{plan for}} a large {{telescope}} was leaked around September 1944 {{in the form of}} the University's budget proposals. [...] Wright and Joseph H. Moore, interim wartime Lick director, imagined an [...] or [...] reflector based upon the funds proposed in the budget by Sproul. [...] Mayall and Gerald E. Kron sent a letter to Sproul representing the younger Lick staff members, in which they requested a meeting to discuss the kind of telescope to be built. [...] They met with Sproul in December 1944 in Sproul's Los Angeles office. [...] Mayall spoke of the key need for a telescope exceeding [...] [...] At the Caltech optical shop in Pasadena he had seen the nearly completed [...] Pyrex <b>glass</b> <b>disc</b> that was initially planned to be used as a flat in the auto-collimation test of the [...] Palomar mirror and urged Sproul to have the Lick telescope use a mirror of that size. [...] Much to their surprise, Sproul agreed.|$|E
500|$|It {{was already}} {{clear from the}} work of Michael Faraday that {{electricity}} and galvanism were essentially the same. [...] Bird realised this, but continued to divide his apparatus into electrical machines, which (according to him) delivered a high voltage at low current, and galvanic apparatus, which delivered a high current at low voltage. [...] The galvanic equipment available to Bird included electrochemical cells such as the voltaic pile and the Daniell cell, a variant of which Bird devised himself. [...] Also part of the standard equipment were induction coils which, together with an interrupter circuit, were used with one of the electrochemical cells to deliver an electric shock. [...] The electrical (as opposed to galvanic) machines then available were friction-operated electrostatic generators consisting of a rotating <b>glass</b> <b>disc</b> or cylinder on which silk flaps were allowed to drag as the glass rotated. [...] These machines had to be hand-turned during treatment, but it was possible to store small amounts of static electricity in Leyden jars for later use.Payne and McConnellSimpson, pp. 7–8Morus, pp. 179 ...|$|E

50|$|Eadward Muybridge {{created his}} Zoopraxiscope in 1879 and lectured until 1894 with this {{projector}} for <b>glass</b> <b>discs</b> on which pictures in transparent paint {{were derived from}} his chronophotographic plates.|$|R

500|$|An {{encounter}} with the work and ideas of photographic pioneer Eadweard Muybridge appears to have spurred Edison to pursue {{the development of a}} motion picture system. On February 25, 1888, in Orange, New Jersey, Muybridge gave a lecture that may have included a demonstration of his zoopraxiscope, a device that projected sequential images drawn around the edge of a <b>glass</b> <b>disc,</b> producing the illusion of motion. The Edison facility was very close by, and the lecture was possibly attended by both Edison and his company's official photographer, William Dickson. Two days later, Muybridge and Edison met at Edison's laboratory in West Orange; Muybridge later described how he proposed a collaboration to join his device with the Edison phonograph—a combination system that would play sound and images concurrently. No such collaboration was undertaken, but in October 1888, Edison filed a preliminary claim, known as a caveat, with the U.S. Patent Office announcing his plans to create a device that would do [...] "for the Eye what the phonograph does for the Ear". It is clear that it was intended as part of a complete audiovisual system: [...] "we may see & hear a whole Opera as perfectly as if actually present". In March 1889, a second caveat was filed, in which the proposed motion picture device was given a name, Kinetoscope, derived from the Greek roots [...] ("movement") and [...] ("to view").|$|E

50|$|A funnel with a fritted <b>glass</b> <b>disc</b> {{can be used}} immediately. For {{a funnel}} with a {{perforated}} plate, filtration material {{in the form of}} filter paper is placed on the plate, and the filter paper is moistened with a liquid to prevent initial leakage. The liquid to be filtered is poured into the cylinder and drawn through the perforated plate/fritted <b>glass</b> <b>disc</b> by vacuum suction.|$|E
50|$|The famous English {{pioneer of}} {{photographic}} motion studies Eadweard Muybridge built a phenakisticope projector {{for which he}} had his photographs rendered as contours on <b>glass</b> <b>discs.</b> The results were not always very scientific; he often edited his photographic sequences for aesthetic reasons and for the <b>glass</b> <b>discs</b> he sometimes even reworked images from multiple photographs into new combinations. An entertaining example is the sequence of a man somersaulting over a bull chased by a dog. For only one disc he chose a photographic representation; the sequence of a running horse skeleton, which was probably to detailed to be painted on <b>glass.</b> This <b>disc</b> was most likely the very first time a stop motion technique was successfully applied. Muybridge first called his apparatus Zoogyroscope, but soon settled on the name Zoöpraxiscope. He used it in countless lectures on human and animal locomotion between 1880 and 1895.|$|R

30|$|Chemicals and {{reagents}} {{were purchased}} from Sigma Aldrich (Taufkirchen, Germany) and used without further purification, unless stated otherwise. PEM films were assembled on germanium crystals (Komlas, Berlin, Germany) and/or borosilicate <b>glass</b> <b>discs</b> (diameter 15  mm, B 33 glass, Schott, Jena, Germany). The substrates were cleaned with detergents and deionized water prior to film assembly. <b>Glass</b> <b>discs</b> were etched with concentrated nitric acid immediately before the coating procedure. Germanium surfaces were plasma etched for 5  min {{in order to}} generate hydroxyl groups and the PEM coating procedure was initiated immediately. PEM films were assembled from poly-l-lysine (PLL, 30 – 70  kDa), poly-l-glutamic acid (PGA, 50 – 100  kDa) and chondroitin sulfate (CS, ~ 63  kDa, from shark cartilage). The polyelectrolytes were dissolved in HEPES/NaCl buffer (25  mM 4 -(2 -hydroxyethyl)- 1 -piperazineethanesulfonic acid, 137  mM NaCl, pH 7.4) at a concentration of 1  mg/ml.|$|R
50|$|Assessing Pollution Induced Community Tolerance {{can be done}} {{utilizing}} in situ techniques. Many {{of these}} techniques involve the use of known or created chemical exposure gradients. One such example {{is the use of}} a known concentration gradient of Tri-n-butylin to assess PICT in periphyton. Tolerance patterns showed that tolerance was highest closest to the marina that was the source of contamination. The use of reference sites in addition to contaminated sites is also commonly used for translocation assessments of PICT. A study in Germany cultured periphyton on <b>glass</b> <b>discs</b> in two river systems north of Leipzig, Germany. One system was the contaminated area of study and the other was 10 km upstream and uncontaminated, intended {{to be used as a}} reference. After the colonization period, 6 of the 10 racks of <b>glass</b> <b>discs</b> were trans-located to the other river system. During the experiment the community structure present on the <b>glass</b> <b>discs</b> from the reference site, when translocated to the contaminated site changed to mirror that of the control discs that were left in the contaminated sites. In another study in Denmark enclosure experiments were done allowing for an assessment of PICT utilizing the lake water from Lake Bure as a baseline. By using this water from the lake potentially confounding variables would be nullified by comparing results to the control. Concentrations of Atrazine and Copper were added to these enclosures in varying concentrations. As in other experiments previously discussed periphyton communities were used in this experiment and were cultured using <b>glass</b> <b>discs.</b> Photosynthetic activity was measured and used as a measurement of PICT throughout the experiment. The experiment showed that elevated levels of Cu lead to community tolerance of the phytoplankton community as well as co-tolerance of zinc. Total Biomass decreased at the outset of the trials involving high concentrations of Cu indicating that Community Tolerance was increased due to direct mortality of the sensitive species.|$|R

40|$|XRF {{analysis}} of {{major and minor}} elements in silicate rocks using fused <b>glass</b> <b>discs</b> at high dilution ratio. X-ray fluorescence (XRF) is an accurate, rapid spectroscopic technique for chemical element determinations on rock samples. The aim {{of this research was}} to evaluate a calibration method for the determination of major and minor elements (Na, Mg, Al, Si, P, K, Ca, Ti, Mn, Fe) in silicate rocks using fused <b>glass</b> <b>discs</b> with a 1 : 30 sample/borate dilution. The analytical method has been calibrated by using forty-two international rock standards. The accuracy appears acceptable for many mineralogical and petrographic purposes. A high dilution ratio makes possible the use of a small amount of sample (225 mg) to obtain good castings in high-melting materials. By contrast, the decrease of the analytical intensity makes not easy the determination of trace elements at the typical concentration levels of geological samples...|$|R

50|$|The most {{significant}} exhibit {{is one of}} the original mechanical speaking clocks, made with rotating <b>glass</b> <b>discs.</b> This is one (number 2) of the four Mark II machines produced in England for use in Australia, which were received in Australia in the early 1950s. The discs were originally read using an exciter and a detector made with valve technology.

Univers was rapidly licensed and re-released by Monotype, Linotype, American Type Founders, IBM and others for phototypesetting, for metal type and reproduction by typewriter. Historian James Mosley has described it as [...] "probably the last major" [...] release of a large family as metal type.|$|R
