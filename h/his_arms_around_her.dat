500|$|Mia Farrow, who {{had come}} and gone from the ashram before, left again and drifted around India before {{returning}} to the United States. Geoffrey Giuliano in Revolver: The Secret History of the Beatles says that, before leaving, she told the Beatles that the Maharishi had made a pass at her. Ned Wynn, one of Farrow's childhood friends, wrote in his 1990 memoir that she had told him in the early 1970s that the Maharishi had definitely made sexual passes at her. In her 1993 autobiography, Cooke de Herrera wrote that Farrow had confided to her, before the arrival of the Beatles, that the Maharishi had made a pass during a private puja ceremony by stroking her hair. Cooke de Herrera wrote that she told Farrow that she had misinterpreted the Maharishi's actions. Farrow's 1997 memoirs are ambiguous, describing an encounter with the Maharishi in his private meditation [...] "cave" [...] when he tried to put <b>his</b> <b>arms</b> <b>around</b> <b>her.</b> She reports that her sister Prudence told her that it was [...] "an honour" [...] and [...] "a tradition" [...] for a [...] "holy man" [...] to touch someone after meditation.|$|E
500|$|She was {{particularly}} affectionate towards the latter because it {{allowed her to}} appear on camera with her two children, {{and said it was}} her favorite. Certain elements of Rand's characterization were developed by Whitney and Shatner; Whitney would go to Shatner's side when their characters were put in danger – in response, Shatner would put <b>his</b> <b>arms</b> <b>around</b> <b>her,</b> such as in [...] "Balance of Terror". The character was written out of the episode [...] "Dagger of the Mind", which Whitney attributed to the romantic liaison that Kirk has with the female lead in that episode being so overt that it would have caused issues for later plots. This was because the script had Kirk and the female lead sleep with each other. Although Whitney found it difficult to watch as her character had been removed from the episode, she understood why. Part of her outfit was dictated by attempting to increase the duties of the Captain's Yeoman on screen. In order to provide support while part of an away team on a planet, Roddenberry suggested that she could wear a device on an over-the-shoulder strap which she could use as an electronic camera. He also suggested immediately that it could be expanded in order to be sold as a toy for young girls. This was part of the development process that {{led to the creation of}} the tricorder.|$|E
2500|$|Linda and Noor {{were sitting}} on a {{two-seater}} couch with Charlotte sitting on the arm, when Noor started touching Linda in a sexual way. He spoke into her ear, put <b>his</b> <b>arms</b> <b>around</b> <b>her</b> waist and refused to let her go. Kathleen then started screaming at him and a verbal altercation took place where Kathleen Mulhall was alleged to have instructed them to ”just kill him for me" [...] Charlotte picked up a Stanley knife and struck Noor across the throat, inflicting a wound that {{sent him to the}} ground. Linda then picked up a hammer and hit him on the head a number of times. Their mother looked on but didn't participate. Noor was stabbed at least 27 times. It may have been more, but pathologists had no opportunity to examine the full body.|$|E
60|$|He passed <b>his</b> <b>arm</b> <b>around</b> <b>her</b> {{and pulled}} her down on his knees.|$|R
60|$|He passed <b>his</b> <b>arm</b> <b>around</b> <b>her</b> tiny waist. She {{looked at}} him with frightened eyes.|$|R
60|$|He put <b>his</b> <b>arm</b> <b>around</b> <b>her</b> shoulders, and the {{strength}} of it seemed to calm her.|$|R
60|$|CURTIS--[Puts <b>his</b> <b>arms</b> <b>around</b> <b>her</b> protectingly.] Nonsense! You're not {{the sort}} that ever grows old.|$|E
60|$|He put <b>his</b> <b>arms</b> <b>around</b> <b>her</b> {{and drew}} her head close to his. Their lips met.|$|E
60|$|He wound <b>his</b> <b>arms</b> <b>around</b> <b>her,</b> and, {{without a}} word, {{commenced}} dragging {{her across the}} road.|$|E
60|$|He passed <b>his</b> <b>arm</b> <b>around</b> <b>her.</b> A wild {{flash in}} her eyes had {{suddenly}} revealed her thought.|$|R
60|$|He put <b>his</b> <b>arm</b> <b>around</b> <b>her</b> {{and led her}} to an oak bench {{near the}} big fireplace.|$|R
60|$|The lady's tears {{became her}} vastly. Hardly {{knowing what he}} did, Scrymgeour put <b>his</b> <b>arm</b> <b>around</b> <b>her.</b>|$|R
60|$|And then {{he sort of}} stumbles {{across the}} room, and goes down on his knees, and gets <b>his</b> <b>arms</b> <b>around</b> <b>her.</b>|$|E
60|$|He {{drew her}} to him, and, with <b>his</b> <b>arms</b> <b>around</b> <b>her,</b> pressed back {{her head and}} covered her lips with kisses.|$|E
60|$|He {{told her}} what more he had to say, but it was with <b>his</b> <b>arms</b> <b>around</b> <b>her</b> and his eyes close to hers.|$|E
60|$|He, however, {{repeated}} the question, touched with her charming preoccupation, and passing <b>his</b> <b>arm</b> <b>around</b> <b>her</b> little waist.|$|R
60|$|So saying, he put <b>his</b> <b>arm</b> <b>around</b> <b>her,</b> {{and half}} leading, half carrying, {{took her to}} her room.|$|R
5000|$|In [...] "Dwight Christmas", Pete and Erin watch Die Hard {{together}} in Andy's office, {{to take her}} mind off Andy sending her an email saying he'll be staying in the Bahamas an extra three weeks. When Erin begins to cry, Pete puts <b>his</b> <b>arm</b> <b>around</b> <b>her</b> to comfort her. She reminds him that she's still Andy's girlfriend, which Pete acknowledges, though she tells him he can leave <b>his</b> <b>arm</b> <b>around</b> <b>her.</b>|$|R
60|$|The {{tears came}} to his eyes, and he put <b>his</b> <b>arms</b> <b>around</b> <b>her</b> neck. He nestled against her heart as a child might have done.|$|E
6000|$|Happy tears fell fast, as Thistle folded <b>his</b> <b>arms</b> <b>around</b> <b>her,</b> crying, [...] "O Lily-Bell, dear Lily-Bell, awake! I {{have been}} true to you, and now my task is done." ...|$|E
6000|$|The {{reply was}} so {{unexpectedly}} mild for Aunt Sally, that Jeff put <b>his</b> <b>arms</b> <b>around</b> <b>her</b> {{and kissed her}} hard cheek. [...] "And I've got some quail, aunty, knowin' you liked em." ...|$|E
60|$|She {{came to him}} as {{a little}} child comes to its mother, and he put <b>his</b> <b>arm</b> <b>around</b> <b>her.</b>|$|R
60|$|She {{frowned at}} his facetiousness--a pretty, adorable frown {{that made him}} put <b>his</b> <b>arm</b> <b>around</b> <b>her</b> and kiss it away.|$|R
6000|$|... "I'm almost {{bursting}} with vanity {{from listening to}} you," [...] he laughed, passing <b>his</b> <b>arm</b> <b>around</b> <b>her</b> and drawing her against him.|$|R
60|$|Suddenly Kells {{stepped to}} her from behind and put <b>his</b> <b>arms</b> <b>around</b> <b>her.</b> Joan grew stiff. She had been taken off her guard. She was {{in his arms and}} could not face him.|$|E
6000|$|... "Why, Marcia!" [...] he said, [...] "what {{a strange}} girl you are!" [...] He sunk {{into his chair}} again, and, putting <b>his</b> <b>arms</b> <b>around</b> <b>her</b> waist, drew her upon his knee, like a child.|$|E
60|$|With no gentle hand {{he grasped}} {{her arm and}} forced her to look at him. But the misery in her eyes overcame him, and he roughly threw <b>his</b> <b>arms</b> <b>around</b> <b>her</b> and held her close.|$|E
60|$|He passed <b>his</b> <b>arm</b> <b>around</b> <b>her</b> waist unconsciously; she {{permitted}} it as unconsciously, as he half {{supported her}} figure while they hurried forward.|$|R
6000|$|... "Shall I {{tell you}} why?" [...] he said, fondly, passing <b>his</b> <b>arm</b> <b>around</b> <b>her</b> waist, and drawing her pretty head nearer his shoulder.|$|R
6000|$|MISS LORE--My! One {{evening he}} has <b>his</b> <b>arm</b> <b>around</b> <b>her,</b> {{and the next}} morning he's ready to break her head! Just like a man! ...|$|R
60|$|Clambering {{into the}} wagon, he put <b>his</b> <b>arms</b> <b>around</b> <b>her</b> neck, {{pressing}} his cheek close against hers, and during {{what seemed a}} very long while the two remained silent, not daring to give words to their fears.|$|E
60|$|Nothing of {{the sort}} happened, however. There was a queer, a mystifying change in Laura's expression. She was {{looking down at the}} floor. Suddenly her face was hidden in her hands. The Inspector threw <b>his</b> <b>arms</b> <b>around</b> <b>her.</b>|$|E
6000|$|... "Oh no, it is n't!" [...] {{and behind}} her back her fingers slowly crushed the petals of a blood-red poppy. She shook her head, smiling a {{brilliant}} smile. The blossoms fell, he flung <b>his</b> <b>arms</b> <b>around</b> <b>her,</b> and {{kissed her on the}} lips.|$|E
60|$|He passed <b>his</b> <b>arm</b> <b>around</b> <b>her</b> {{and gripped}} her fingers tightly. So {{they were sitting}} when, by and by, Selingman burst into the room.|$|R
60|$|But Daylight {{was bent}} on having his way, {{and when he}} sat down it was with her beside him and <b>his</b> <b>arm</b> <b>around</b> <b>her.</b>|$|R
60|$|She looked up. He {{ventured to}} put <b>his</b> <b>arm</b> <b>around</b> <b>her</b> waist. She shook herself free, very weakly. He tried again and with success.|$|R
