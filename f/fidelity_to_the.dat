5|$|In 1971, Castro visited Chile, where Marxist President Salvador Allende {{had been}} elected {{as the head of}} a left-wing coalition. Castro {{supported}} Allende's socialist reforms, but warned him of right-wing elements in Chile's military. In 1973, the military led a coup d'état and established a military junta led by Augusto Pinochet. Castro proceeded to Guinea to meet socialist President Sékou Touré, praising him as Africa's greatest leader, and there received the Order of <b>Fidelity</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> People. He then went on a seven-week tour visiting leftist allies: Algeria, Bulgaria, Hungary, Poland, East Germany, Czechoslovakia and the Soviet Union, where he was given further awards. On each trip, he was eager to visit factory and farm workers, publicly praising their governments; privately, he urged the regimes to aid revolutionary movements elsewhere, particularly those fighting the Vietnam War.|$|E

5|$|The May Revolution {{began the}} Argentine War of Independence, {{although}} no formal {{declaration of independence}} was issued {{at the time and}} the Primera Junta continued to govern {{in the name of the}} deposed king, FerdinandVII. As similar events occurred in many other cities of the continent, the May Revolution is also considered one of the early events of the Spanish American wars of independence. Historians today debate whether the revolutionaries were truly loyal to the Spanish crown or whether the declaration of <b>fidelity</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> king was a necessary ruse to conceal the true objective—to achieve independence—from a population that was not yet ready to accept such a radical change. A formal declaration of independence was finally issued at the Congress of Tucumán on July9, 1816.|$|E
5|$|The {{mission of}} Santa Ana de Velasco {{was the final}} World Heritage Site-inscribed mission to be established. It was founded by the Jesuit priest Fr. Julian Knogler in 1755. The {{original}} native inhabitants of the missions were the Covareca and Curuminaca tribes. The mission church was designed after the expulsion of the Jesuits between 1770 and 1780 by an unknown architect and built entirely by the indigenous population. The complex, consisting of the church, bell tower, sacristy and a grassy plaza lined by houses, is considered {{to have the most}} <b>fidelity</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> original plan of the Jesuit reductions. Starting in 1989 and lasting until 2001, the mission underwent partial restoration through the efforts of Hans Roth and his team.|$|E

40|$|Entanglement is {{a unique}} quantum {{mechanical}} attribute and a fundamental resource of quantum technologies. Entanglement can be achieved in various individual degrees of freedom, nonetheless some systems are able to create simultaneous entanglement in multiple degrees of freedom - hyper-entanglement. A hyper-entangled state of light represents a valuable tool capable of reducing the experimental requirements and resource overheads and it can improve the success rate of quantum information protocols. Here, we report on demonstration of polarization and time-bin hyper-entangled photons emitted from a single quantum dot. We achieved this result by applying resonant and coherent excitation on a quantum dot system with marginal fine structure splitting. Our results yield <b>fidelities</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> maximally entangled state of 0. 81 (6) and 0. 87 (4) in polarization and time-bin, respectively. Comment: 5 pages, 3 figure...|$|R

25|$|During his reign, King Sigismund granted several royal castles and {{the royal}} domains {{attached}} to them {{to the members of}} the barons' leagues; by 1407, the number of royal castles decreased from 111 to 66. The king, however, wanted to strengthen his position and for this purpose, in 1408, he founded the Order of the Dragon, a chivalric order whose 22 members (e.g., the Palatine Nicholas II Garai, count Hermann II of Celje, Stibor of Stiboricz and the Despot Stefan Lazarević) swore <b>fidelity</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> king, his queen and their future children.|$|E

The design methodology is based on combining hierarchical modeling with data-driven modeling. Related work done in variable-resolution modeling is a generalization for any modeling technique, while our proposed guidelines are specific for development of agent based models. ...|$|R

25|$|Badiou's {{ultimate}} ethical maxim {{is therefore}} one of: 'decide upon the undecidable'. It is {{to name the}} indiscernible, the generic set, and thus name the event that re-casts ontology in a new light. He identifies four domains in which a subject (who, {{it is important to}} note, becomes a subject through this process) can potentially witness an event: love, science, politics and art. By enacting <b>fidelity</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> event within these four domains one performs a 'generic procedure', which in its undecidability is necessarily experimental, and one potentially recasts the situation in which being takes place. Through this maintenance of fidelity, truth has the potentiality to emerge.|$|E
