5|$|After the United States officially {{entered the}} war, Hispanic Americans {{were among the}} many American {{citizens}} who {{joined the ranks of}} the United States Marine Corps as volunteers or through the draft.

One of the major {{differences between the two}} E-9 ranks is that master gunnery sergeants retain their Military Occupational Specialty (MOS), while sergeants major are given a new MOS to reflect their general command focus. This reinforces the master gunnery sergeant's role as a provider of technical military leadership.|$|E
