Thus, detecting <b>heat</b> <b>leakages</b> on building walls is a new research problem. In this study, we propose a novel system to detect thermal leakages automatically from thermal camera images. To this end, we use sequential thermal images of buildings. First, we start with fusing thermal image sequences to obtain rectified building facade with higher resolution. Then, we detect L-shaped features using a set of steerable filters. We use L-shaped features and perceptual organization rules to detect windows and doors from rectified thermal image. After eliminating detected doors and windows from building facade, we detect problematic regions. One of the advantage of proposed system is that, it {{can also be used to}} detect building damages automatically even in night time.

The optimal allocation of the heat-transfer areas of the heat-exchangers in the refrigeration cycles is discussed in detail. The results obtained here are more general and useful than the relevant results in literature and can provide some valuable guidance for the optimal design and operation of real active thermal potentiostatting systems.

40|$|ABSTRACT: Infrared (IR) images depict thermal {{radiation}} of physical objects. Imaging the building façades and the roofs with an IR camera, thermal inspections {{of the buildings}} can be carried out. In such inspections a spatial correspondence between IR-images and the existing 3 D building models can be helpful. Texturing 3 D building models with IR images this spatial correspondence can be created. Furthermore in textures <b>heat</b> <b>leakages</b> can be detected and the heat bridges can be stored together with 3 D building data. However, before extracting leakages, the windows should be located. In IR images glass reflects the surrounding and shows false results for the temperature measurements. Consequently, the windows should be detected in IR images and excluded for the inspection. The most common algorithms for window detection were developed for the images in the visual band. In this paper, an algorithm for window detection in textures extracted from terrestrial IR images is proposed. In the first step, small objects have to be removed by scaling down the image (texture). Then in the scaled image, regions are detected using a local dynamic threshold. Morphological operations are used to remove false detections and unify substructures of the windows. For every extracted region, which {{is a candidate for}} a window, the center of gravity is calculated. It is assumed that windows on façades are ordered in regular rows and columns.

40|$|In Sweden {{and many}} other {{northern}} countries, {{it is common for}} heat to be distributed to homes and industries through district heating networks. Such networks consist of pipes buried underground carrying hot water or steam with temperatures in the range of 90 - 150 C. Due to bad insulation or cracks, <b>heat</b> or water <b>leakages</b> might appear. A system for large-scale monitoring of district heating networks through remote thermography has been developed and is in use at the company Termisk Systemteknik AB. Infrared images are captured from an aircraft and analysed, finding and indicating the areas for which the ground temperature is higher than normal. During the analysis there are, however, many other warm areas than true water or energy leakages that are marked as detections. Objects or phenomena that can cause false alarms are those who, for some reason, are warmer than their surroundings, for example, chimneys, cars and <b>heat</b> <b>leakages</b> from buildings. During the last couple of years, the system has been used in a number of cities. Therefore, there exists a fair amount of examples of different types of detections. The purpose of the present master’s thesis is to evaluate the reduction of false alarms of the existing analysis that can be achieved {{with the use of a}} learning system, i. e. a system which can learn how to recognize different types of detections.   A labelled data set for training and testing was acquired by contact with customers. Furthermore, a number of features describing the intensity difference within the detection, its shape and propagation as well as proximity information were found, implemented and evaluated. Finally, four different classifiers and other methods for classification were evaluated. The method that obtained the best results consists of two steps. In the initial step, all detections which lie on top of a building are removed from the data set of labelled detections. The second step consists of classification using a Random forest classifier. Using this two-step method, the number of false alarms is reduced by 43 % while the percentage of water and energy detections correctly classified is 99 %...|$|R

40|$|Currently {{promising}} development {{direction of}} space propulsion engineering is to use, as spacecraft controls, low-thrust rocket engines (RDTM) on clean fuels, such as oxygen-methane. Modern RDTM {{are characterized by}} a lack regenerative cooling and pulse mode of operation, during which there is accumulation of heat energy {{to lead to the}} high thermal stress of RDTM structural elements. To get an idea about the thermal state of its elements, which further will reduce the number of fire tests is therefore necessary in the development phase of a new product. Accordingly, the aim of this work is the mathematical modeling and computational study of the thermal state of gaseous oxygen-methane propellant RDMT operating in pulse mode. In this paper we consider a model RDTM working on gaseous propellants oxygen-methane in pulse mode. To calculate the temperature field of the chamber wall of model RDMT under consideration is used the mathematical model of non-stationary heat conduction in a two-dimensional axisymmetric formulation that takes into account both the axial <b>heat</b> <b>leakages</b> and the nonstationary processes occurring inside the chamber during pulse operation of RDMT. As a result of numerical study of the thermal state of model RDMT, are obtained the temperature fields during engine operation based on convective, conductive, and radiative mechanisms of heat transfer from the combustion products to the wall. It is shown that the elements of flanges of combustion chamber of model RDMT act as heat sinks structural elements. Temperatures in the wall of the combustion chamber during the engine mode of operation are considered relatively low. Raised temperatures can also occur in the mixing head in the feeding area of the oxidant into the combustion chamber. During engine operation in the area forming the critical section, there is an intensive heating of a wall, which can result in its melting, which in turn will increase the minimum nozzle throat area and hence will change the operating conditions of engine. </p...|$|R
