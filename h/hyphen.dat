5|$|In English, when unit {{names are}} {{combined}} to denote multiplication {{of the units}} concerned, they are separated with a <b>hyphen</b> or a space (e.g. newton-metre or newton metre). The plural is formed by converting the last unit name to the plural form (e.g. ten newton-metres).|$|E
5|$|Strings of data octets {{within a}} URI are {{represented}} as characters. Permitted characters within a URI are the ASCII characters for the lowercase and uppercase {{letters of the}} modern English alphabet, the Arabic numerals, <b>hyphen,</b> period, underscore, and tilde. Octets represented by any other character must be percent-encoded.|$|E

5|$|In {{the table}} above, genitive pronouns all end with -gin, which is {{separated}} orthographically by a <b>hyphen</b> that normally divides morphemes. The -gin form {{here is not}} a separate morpheme and cannot be lexically segmented; {{there is no such}} word as nganing that would be formed by removing -gin from nganing-gin 'my/mine'. The fact that the genitive forms have regular endings across the entire pronoun paradigm may have been a historical accident.|$|E
5|$|The {{newspaper}} shortened {{its name}} to The New-York Times on September 14, 1857. It dropped the <b>hyphen</b> in the city name on December 1, 1896. On April 21, 1861, The New York Times departed from its original Monday–Saturday publishing schedule and joined other major dailies in adding a Sunday edition to offer daily coverage of the Civil War. One of the earliest public controversies it was involved with was the Mortara Affair, the subject of twenty editorials it published alone.|$|E
5|$|The scheme, {{consisting}} of a sequence of characters beginning with a letter and followed by any combination of letters, digits, plus (+), period (.), or <b>hyphen</b> (-). Although schemes are case-insensitive, the canonical form is lowercase and documents that specify schemes must do so with lowercase letters. It {{is followed by a}} colon (:). Examples of popular schemes include http(s), ftp, mailto, file, data, and irc. URI schemes should be registered with the Internet Assigned Numbers Authority (IANA), although non-registered schemes are used in practice.|$|E

Though {{members of this}} church have traditionally been called Latter Day Saints (without the <b>hyphen),</b> the Community of Christ has more recently stated that it rejects {{the use of the}} term Saints as a designation for its members in any official reference or publication.|$|E
5|$|Early work on {{this new}} {{category}} of nova was performed during the 1930s by Walter Baade and Fritz Zwicky at Mount Wilson Observatory. They identified SAndromedae, what they considered a typical supernova, as an explosive event that released radiation approximately equal to the Sun's total energy output for 107 years. They decided to call this new class of cataclysmic variables super-novae, and postulated that the energy was generated by the gravitational collapse of ordinary stars into neutron stars. The name super-novae was first used in a 1931 lecture at Caltech by Zwicky, then used publicly in 1933 {{at a meeting of}} the American Physical Society. By 1938, the <b>hyphen</b> had been lost and the modern name was in use.|$|E
5|$|Abnormally {{developed}} milk caps infested by the parasitic sac fungus Hypomyces lateritius (syn. Peckialla laterita) are occasionally {{found in}} summer and autumn. The infested fruit bodies are usually more or less heavily malformed with a harder and more solid flesh than typical fruit bodies, {{so that they are}} more resistant to rot and can even survive the winter. They do not create gills; instead, the cap bottom is covered by an initially soft, white <b>hyphen</b> fungus, also known as a subiculum. Early on the mycelia becomes denser and takes on a white-grey colour. The perithecia are created after about 10–14 days. Perithecia are fruit bodies of the Hypomyces and other sac fungi, in which the spindle-shaped asci are produced. Besides L.deterrimus, L.deliciosus and L.sanguifluus can become infested, rarely other milk caps. Hypomyces lateritius, H.ochraceus, H.rosellus, H.odoratus, among other Hypomyces species live parasitically on different milk caps and brittlegills {{as well as on the}} fruit bodies of species from other genera.|$|E
25|$|There was a {{tendency}} in the 18th century to use <b>hyphens</b> excessively, that is, to hyphenate all previously established solid compound verbs. American English, however, has diminished {{the use of}} <b>hyphens,</b> while British English is more conservative.|$|R
5000|$|To get the teens, toista {{is added}} to the base number. Toista is the partitive form of toinen, meaning [...] "second group of ten". <b>Hyphens</b> are written here to {{separate}} morphemes. In Finnish text, <b>hyphens</b> are not written.|$|R
5000|$|<b>Hyphens</b> are minimized, but for {{compound}} group names, <b>hyphens</b> {{are used}} only to connect two names that are themselves bird species or families, e.g., [...] "Eagle-Owl", [...] "Wren-Babbler", {{or when the}} combined name {{would be difficult to}} read, e.g., [...] "Silky-flycatcher" ...|$|R
25|$|Also nonbreaking <b>hyphen,</b> non-breaking <b>hyphen</b> and {{no-break}} <b>hyphen.</b> This character looks {{identical to}} the regular <b>hyphen,</b> but it is treated as a letter by word processors, namely that the hyphenated word will not be divided at the <b>hyphen</b> should this fall at {{what would be the}} end of a line of text; instead, the whole hyphenated word either will remain in full at the end of the line or will go in full to the beginning of the next line. The non-breaking space exists for similar reasons.|$|E
25|$|In the tables, the <b>hyphen</b> has two {{different}} meanings. A <b>hyphen</b> after the letter {{indicates that it}} must be {{at the beginning of a}} syllable, e.g. j- in jumper and ajar. A <b>hyphen</b> before the letter indicates that it cannot be at the beginning of a word, e.g. -ck in sick and ticket.|$|E
25|$|Hylton-Stewart's surname {{is written}} without a <b>hyphen</b> in some non-cricketing references, {{regularly}} with a <b>hyphen</b> in cricketing references. Both {{his father and}} his older brother, Charles Hylton Stewart (1884–1932), who achieved fame as a composer of church music including settings for Psalms and as the organist at Rochester and Chester Cathedrals and at St George's Chapel, Windsor, are generally written without a <b>hyphen.</b>|$|E

25|$|It {{is proper}} {{to write the}} name of the earlier school as Wheaton-Warrenville High School, with a <b>hyphen.</b> When the school was renamed, the <b>hyphen</b> was dropped to symbolize a lack of division.|$|E
25|$|Because early {{comic book}} letterers {{were not aware}} of the typographic {{convention}} of replacing a typewritten double <b>hyphen</b> with an em dash, the double <b>hyphen</b> became traditional in American comics.

50|$|The {{original}} one-story {{office and}} kitchen pavilions, and their connecting <b>hyphens,</b> were altered in the 19th century with the house's conversion to a hotel, {{by a second}} story added to the <b>hyphens</b> and the west wing. These changes have since been reversed, and the building approximates its original outward appearance, both inside and out.|$|R
25|$|It may be {{necessary}} to distinguish an incidental line-break <b>hyphen</b> from one integral to a word being mentioned (as when used in a dictionary) or present in an original text being quoted (when in a critical edition)—not only to control its word wrap behavior (which encoding handles with hard and soft hyphens having the same glyph) but also to differentiate appearance (with a different glyph). Merriam-Webster's Third New International Dictionary and the Chambers Dictionary use a double <b>hyphen</b> for integral hyphens and a single <b>hyphen</b> for line-breaks, whereas Kromhout's Afrikaans–English dictionary uses the opposite convention. The Concise Oxford Dictionary (fifth edition) repeated an integral <b>hyphen</b> {{at the start of the}} following line.|$|E
25|$|The <b>hyphen</b> {{is often}} used in reduplicatives.|$|E
25|$|With the {{introduction}} of letter-spacing in the Middle Ages, the <b>hyphen,</b> still written beneath the text, reversed its meaning. Scribes used the mark to connect two words that had been incorrectly separated by a space. This era also saw {{the introduction}} of the marginal <b>hyphen,</b> for words broken across lines.|$|E
