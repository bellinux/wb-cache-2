5|$|Throughout the state, Hurricane Isabel {{resulted}} in a damage total of $1.85billion (2003USD, $2.17billion 2008USD). The hurricane destroyed more than 1,186homes and 77businesses, severely damaged 9,110homes and 333businesses, and left 107,908homes and over 1,000businesses with minor damage. Across the state, the hurricane generated an estimated 660,000dump trucks of debris. At least tenpeople were directly killed by the storm, and hundreds more were injured. A total of 1.8million electrical customers were left without power, with <b>electrical</b> <b>damage</b> totaling $128million (2003USD, $150million 2008USD). Dominion Virginia Power reported 2,311broken utility poles, 3,899snapped crossarms, and 7,363spans of downed power lines, with 72% of its primary distribution circuits damaged. The passage of the hurricane {{resulted in}} an agricultural damage total of about $117million (2003USD, $137million 2008USD).|$|E
5|$|Communications on {{the island}} failed due to the winds; the entire island was left without power and phone service. The winds greatly damaged 715power poles and 513transformers, leaving about $52million in <b>electrical</b> <b>damage</b> {{reported}} (2002USD, $ USD). The local weather office's communication link was cut off after flooding damaged a telecommunication facility, causing the National Weather Service in Honolulu, Hawaii, to provide backup support by temporarily issuing warnings and advisories. Many anemometers near the northern coastline failed from the winds. The winds collapsed several walls at the Guam Memorial Hospital, resulting in major damage throughout the northern two-thirds of the facility and several units being shut down. Several hotels, churches, and schools received moderate damage, and the Antonio B. Won Pat International Airport received damage to navigation equipment. Typhoon Pongsona also left 65% of the island's water wells inoperable, with most of Guam left without water service following the storm. Officials estimate the typhoon destroyed 1,300homes, severely damaged 1,825, and lightly damaged 4,800.|$|E
5|$|While filming in Washington, D.C., {{the crew}} {{shot on the}} National Mall, and Bay stated {{that there would be}} a car race on the location. Two further {{locations}} announced were the Milwaukee Art Museum and the former Tower Automotive complex on Milwaukee's north side, then under redevelopment for mixed use as well as the city's equipment yard. Filming was scheduled to take place there after work was done in Chicago. On September 23, scenes were filmed at the former city hall in Detroit. On October 16, a scene in the later-1960s was shot at the Johnson Space Center in Houston, utilizing extras with period fashion and hairstyles. One day of shooting was also spent at the Angkor Wat temple complex in Cambodia. Other planned filming locations included Africa and China. Though about 70% of the film's live action footage was shot in 3-D using Arri Alexa and Sony F35 cameras, more than half of the film still had to be converted into 3-D in post production to fix technical flaws 3-D filming produces. Other footage that needed to be converted into 3-D in post production was either entirely computer generated or shot in the anamorphic format on 35mm film. 35mm film was used for scenes filmed in slow motion and scenes such as closeups of faces or shots of the sky which required higher image quality than the HD digital 3-D cameras could provide. 35mm cameras were also used for scenes where the 3-D cameras proved to be too heavy, or were subject to strobing or <b>electrical</b> <b>damage</b> from dust. Principal photography officially concluded on November 9, 2010.|$|E

2500|$|In {{addition}} to turbine2, turbines7 and 9 also suffered severe damage and were destroyed, while the turbine room roof and ceilings fell on and caused additional damage to turbines1 and 3, with slight damage to turbines4, 5, 8, and 10. [...] Turbine6, {{which was in}} scheduled repair {{at the time of}} the accident, received only minor damage and was the only one of the station's 10 turbines that did not receive <b>electrical</b> <b>damage</b> due to shorting of the associated transformers. [...] Water immediately flooded the engine and turbine rooms and caused a transformer explosion. [...] Transformers 1 and 2 were destroyed, while transformers 3, 4, and 5 were left in satisfactory condition. Other damage was also severe as the machinery hall was destroyed, including the roof, ceilings, and floor.|$|E
2500|$|Illustrious {{suffered}} a similar battering, especially off of Malta in 1941 when hit by German dive bombers and {{late in the}} war was limited to 22knots (41km/h) because her centreline shaft was disabled due to accumulated wartime damage; she spent five years as a training and trials carrier (1948â€“53) and was disposed of in 1954. Indomitable was completely refit to like-new condition, only to suffer a severe gasoline explosion on board, which caused [...] "considerable structural and <b>electrical</b> <b>damage</b> to the ship". Indomitable was refitted between 1948 and 1950 and served as flagship of the Home Fleet then served a {{tour of duty in}} the Mediterranean, where she was damaged by the petrol explosion. She was partially repaired before proceeding under her own power to Queen Elizabeth II's 1953 Coronation Review, before being placed in reserve in 1954. Indomitable was scrapped in 1956. The explosion which occurred on Indomitables hangar deck, while severe, would also have caused severe casualties and extensive damage to an Essex-class carrier, several of which returned to service after hangar explosions, primarily due to the USN's considerable financial and material resources. The postwar Royal Navy could only afford to rebuild Victorious and had to abandon plans to rebuild four other armoured carriers due to cost, and to provide crews to man the postwar built carriers, such as , due to reductions in manpower.|$|E

40|$|AbstractThis {{paper is}} to {{elucidate}} on the cold plasma-mediated surface modification of organic cells and biomaterials. We demonstrate that the non-aggressive cold plasma can apply on organic materials without causing thermal and <b>electrical</b> <b>damages.</b> The atmospheric pressure cold plasma was generated by utilizing the combination of corona discharge-induced plasma on a tip edge, and the dielectric barrier discharge (DBD). Specifically, this work presents {{the transformation of the}} hydrophobic to the hydrophilic surface of sunflower seeds. Therefore, our cold plasma becomes an alternative method of surface treatment for the organic- and bio-materials...|$|R
40|$|We numerically {{investigate}} {{the effect of}} magnetic and <b>electrical</b> <b>damages</b> {{at the edge of}} a perpendicular magnetic random access memory (MRAM) cell on the spin-transfer-torque (STT) efficiency that is defined by the ratio of thermal stability factor to switching current. We find that the switching mode of an edge-damaged cell is different from that of an undamaged cell, which results in a sizable reduction in the switching current. Together with a marginal reduction of the thermal stability factor of an edge-damaged cell, this feature makes the STT efficiency large. Our results suggest that a precise edge control is viable for the optimization of STT-MRAM...|$|R

40|$|International audienceSuperconducting cables {{have now}} become a mature {{technology}} for energy transport, high-field magnets (MRI, LHC) and fusion applications (ToreSupra, and eventually ITER and DEMO). The superconductors are extremely brittle and suffer from <b>electrical</b> <b>damages</b> brought by mechanical strain induced by electromagnetic field that they generate. An optimal wiring architecture, obtained by simulation, can limit these damages. However, the simulation is a complex process and needs validation. This validation is performed on real 3 D samples by the means of image processing.
