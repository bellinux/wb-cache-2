40|$|This thesis {{focused on}} the study of the {{influence}} of different exopolysaccharide types produced by two strains of Streptococcus thermophilus on the physical properties of <b>fermented</b> <b>milk.</b> First, the fermentation factors affecting EPS production were studied to ascertain required carbon source and environmental conditions which would support their production. Higher fermentation temperature (42 °C) resulted in a greater cell growth and EPS production. EPS production was growth associated in glucose or lactose-containing M 17 medium. The examined strains appeared to be able to utilize galactose for the EPS assembly and produced comparable amounts of EPS, albeit restrictive cell growth. The EPS production of the two strains was comparable, ranging from ~ 100 to ~ 600 mg/L. Secondly, the EPS were rheologically characterized to show their resistance to deformation. Influence of temperature, pH and concentration on the flow behaviour of these EPS was also assessed. Under acidic conditions, capsularropy EPS was less responsive to temperature with a higher zero shear viscosity ηo (14. 36 to 150. 82 mPa s) than capsular EPS (93. 72 to 9. 24 mPa s), and slightly higher relaxation time τ (0. 43 to 15. 82 s for capsular-ropy EPS and 0. 72 to 9. 36 s for capsular EPS). The opposite behavior was observed under neutral pH. EPS concentration did not give significant effect (P> 0. 05) on ηo and τ. The second study examined the effects of types of EPS on yoghurt texture under selected conditions. <b>Fermented</b> <b>milk</b> made using capsular-ropy EPS showed greater resistance to flow with less solid-like behaviour. It also had greater water holding capacity although the milk gel was less compact and brittle compared to <b>fermented</b> <b>milk</b> with capsular EPS. The EPS production in milk during fermentation between the two strains was comparable with maximum concentration was 840 plus/minus 47. 5 mg EPS/kg <b>fermented</b> <b>milk.</b> Syneresis was lower in <b>fermented</b> <b>milk</b> incubated in low temperature, was ranging from 4. 1 - 2. 4 g/ 100 g <b>fermented</b> <b>milk</b> with capsular-ropy-EPS, and 10. 9 - 26. 6 g/ 100 g in <b>fermented</b> <b>milk</b> with capsular EPS. G’ was 23. 8 - 365. 1 Pa and 57. 6 - 1040 Pa for <b>fermented</b> <b>milk</b> with capsular ropy and capsular EPS, respectively. The third study examined the involvement of EPS in the texture creation of <b>fermented</b> <b>milk</b> supplemented with calcium and/or sucrose, or calcium and whey proteins. Calcium addition to milk base resulted in increased acidity and greater syneresis (~ 20 - 30 g/ 100 g in <b>fermented</b> <b>milk</b> with capsular-ropy EPS and ~ 30 - 50 g/ 100 g in <b>fermented</b> <b>milk</b> with capsular EPS) and thixotropy of <b>fermented</b> <b>milk,</b> as compared to <b>fermented</b> <b>milk</b> without added calcium. Sucrose affected the parameters in opposite manner. EPS production did not differ from that of the control <b>fermented</b> <b>milk.</b> Storage modulus (G’) was 96 - 230. 4 Pa, and 502. 8 - 1143. 5 for <b>fermented</b> <b>milk</b> with capsular ropy and capsular EPS, respectively. The effect of heat-untreated whey protein isolate or whey protein concentrate on calcium-fortified <b>fermented</b> <b>milk</b> was studied using capsular ropy EPS producer. Result showed that combined effect of both supplement was detrimental to texture of <b>fermented</b> <b>milk</b> to make it resemble that of drinking yoghurt. Syneresis was up to ~ 50 g/ 100 g, while G’ was only around 4 mPa. The next experiment studied the effect of heat-treated whey protein isolate addition on <b>fermented</b> <b>milk</b> texture. Results showed that heat-treatment applied to added whey protein preserved the G’ and syneresis with the values close to those of normal <b>fermented</b> <b>milk.</b> However, at high concentration of added heat-treated whey protein (whey protein:casein 3 : 1), the texture became very hard with 0 m 2 permeability. Gelation was started very early in <b>fermented</b> <b>milk</b> added with heatdenatured whey protein. Whey protein addition induced the beginning of gelation. Supplemented <b>fermented</b> <b>milk</b> made using capsular-ropy EPS producer consistently showed lower G’, lower syneresis, and more shear-resistant compared to that made using capsular EPS. In conclusion, capsular ropy EPS, both in dispersion and in <b>fermented</b> <b>milk</b> with or without different supplementation, exhibited less solid-like properties and more shear-resistant behavior compared to capsular EPS...|$|R

For this purpose, viability and metabolic activity (expressed as pH, lactic and acetic acid production and utilization of soluble carbohydrates) of probiotic bacteria were determined. Retention of viability of B. lactis Bb- 12 and L. acidophilus La- 5 was greater in <b>fermented</b> <b>milk</b> with RFOs. The pH of probiotic <b>fermented</b> <b>milk</b> at 21 days of storage was lower (4. 27) compared with probiotic <b>fermented</b> <b>milk</b> with RFOs (4. 37). The highest levels of lactic and acetic acid were produced in probiotic <b>fermented</b> <b>milk</b> without RFOs compared with probiotic <b>fermented</b> <b>milk</b> with RFOs during storage at 4 °C. Soluble carbohydrates were utilised in <b>fermented</b> <b>milk</b> with and without RFOs, respectively, for maintaining B. lactis Bb- 12 and L. acidophilus populations during refrigerated storage. In conclusion, all these experiments provide convincing evidence that RFOs have beneficial effects on the survival of these probiotic cultures in dairy products. As a result, such stored dairy products containing both probiotics and prebiotics have synergistic actions in the promotion of health.

40|$|This study {{investigates the}} effect of feeding <b>fermented</b> <b>milks</b> with Lactobacillus casei, Lactobacillus acidophilus and a mixture of both {{micro-organisms}} on the specific and non-specific host defence mechanisms in Swiss mice. Animals fed with <b>fermented</b> <b>milk</b> for 8 days (100 micrograms/day) showed an increase in both phagocytic and lymphocytic activity. This activation {{of the immune system}} began on the 3 rd day, reached a maximum on the 5 th, and decreased slightly on the 8 th day of feeding. In the 8 -day treated mice, boosted with a single dose (100 micrograms) on the 11 th day, the immune response increased further. The feeding with <b>fermented</b> <b>milk</b> produced neither hepatomegaly nor splenomegaly. These results suggest that L. casei and L. acidophilus, associated with intestinal mucosae, can influence the level of activation of the immune system.

Acidification profiles and factors that affect viability (postfermentation acidification, acidity and dissolved oxygen) were also studied during 35 days at 4 C. <b>Fermented</b> <b>milk</b> prepared with a coculture of ST and Bifidobacterium lactis gave the most constant rheological behavior and the best cell viability during cold storage; it was superior to ST plus LA for probiotic <b>fermented</b> <b>milk</b> production...|$|R
40|$|The aim of {{this study}} was to {{determine}} the impact of the bioactive ingredient – oat β-glucan – on the quality characteristics of the <b>fermented</b> <b>milk</b> products (kefir, yogurt and <b>fermented</b> <b>milk</b> beverages) made on buttermilk-skimmed milk mixture base and establish the influence of the consumption of one of them on the health characteristics of volunteers. The enrichment of <b>fermented</b> <b>milk</b> products with 0. 6 % oat β-glucan had no impact on the fermentation time, enhanced the apparent viscosity and changed sensory properties. The experiments of medical nutrition of volunteers showed a significant decrease of total (p< 0. 05) and low density lipoprotein (p< 0. 05) cholesterol, increase in high density lipoprotein cholesterol (p< 0. 01) in their blood after a 21 -day period of consumption of fermented product with β-glucan. According to these findings, consumption of <b>fermented</b> <b>milk</b> beverage prepared on the buttermilk-skimmed milk base and enriched with oat β-glucan had a beneficial effect on human health...|$|R
40|$|Milk {{proteins}} are precursors {{of different}} biologically active peptides. They are inactive within {{the sequence of}} the precursor proteins but can be released by enzymatic proteolysis, e. g. during the production of <b>fermented</b> <b>milk</b> by selected bacterial strains. Two {{of the most interesting}} biological activities recognised in milk peptides are angiotensin-I converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitory and immunomodulatory activity. The present work uses an enzymatic assay to identify ACE-inhibitory activity of standard <b>milk</b> <b>fermented</b> by two bacterial strains, Enterococcus faecalis TH 563 and Lactobacillus delbrueckii subsp. bulgaricus LA 2, isolated from local dairy products and selected for their different proteolytic activity. In addition, <b>fermented</b> <b>milks</b> were evaluated for immunomodulatory activity by studying the proliferation of bovine peripheral blood lymphocytes taken from nine nonpregnant, non-lactating, clinically healthy cows by the MTT test. Cells were incubated (3 * 106 cell mL- 1) for 48 h in a 96 -well microplate with increasing concentrations of the two <b>fermented</b> <b>milks,</b> with or without concanavalin A (conA; 2 μg mL- 1).

40|$|Today {{approximately}} 10 % of <b>fermented</b> <b>milk</b> products {{stick to}} the packaging material inner surface, and therefore {{it is not possible}} to pour all of the dairy product from the package. This is both an economical and environmental issue. The product loss is expensive for consumer and makes recycling of package less effective. As they do not yet exist the development of packaging materials to which <b>fermented</b> <b>milk</b> products stick less, it would make it possible to both save money and protect our environment. The aim of this work was to provide knowledge and understanding of the important factors involved in the phenomenon when <b>fermented</b> <b>milk</b> products adhere to the inner surface of a packaging material. Studies were done on materials having different surface properties, such as polarity and relative oxidation. They were incubated in <b>fermented</b> <b>milk</b> and other dairy products varying in fat concentration and protein type up to 168 h. The systems were investigated gravimetrically, with Fourier Transform Infra Red/Attenuated Total Reflectance Spectroscopy, Scanning Electron Microscopy and Contact Angle measurements. <b>Fermented</b> <b>milk</b> contains amphiphilic components and therefore can interact both with polar and non-polar surfaces, such that the relative oxidation of the surface does not contribute to the adhesion. The adhesion of <b>fermented</b> <b>milk</b> is an equilibrium reaction, which depend on the fat concentration before equilibrium as well as the protein concentration after equilibrium. The adhesion seems to follows the Vroman effect, with smaller molecules associating faster and thereby adhering to the surface initially, but are displaced by larger molecules that associates slower as times passes...|$|R

40|$|Safety {{condition}} of commercial <b>fermented</b> <b>milk</b> that {{put on the}} market in banda aceh based on nutritive value and pathogenic bacteria ABSTRACT. <b>Fermented</b> <b>milk</b> has much value primarily for the health of digestive system. However without hygienically and sterilized treatment it can become toxic to consumers. This research was conducted to observe nutritive value, the present of pathogenic bacteria, and the safety {{condition of}} commercial <b>fermented</b> <b>milk</b> that put {{on the market in}} Banda Aceh. Samples of commercial <b>fermented</b> <b>milk</b> tested were obtained from recognized retailers in Banda Aceh. Factorial completely randomized design with six replications was applied in this research. Variety of <b>fermented</b> <b>milk</b> products (yoghurt and drink yoghurt) was the first factor to be analyzed, and the second one was expired date of the products (the date of production and the date of by expired). The amount of crude protein and lipid, pH level, and the amount of lactic acid bacteria, Coliform and Staphilococcus aureus were the parameter determined. The variety and the expired date of the products influenced the amount of crude protein and lipid, the pH level, the amount of lactic acid bacteria, Coliform and Staphilococcus aureus in the level of highly significant different (P< 0, 01). There was also found in highly significant interaction (P< 0, 01) between factors that influenced the amount of lactic acid bacteria and Staphilococcus aureus. On the other hand, the amount of Coliform was not influenced by those factors. The study also results in decreasing of the amount of crude protein and lipid as well as lactic acid bacteria caused by the ongoing time of storing. The longer <b>fermented</b> <b>milk</b> was stored, the lower the level of crude protein, lipid and lactic acid bacteria presented. The lipid level of <b>fermented</b> <b>milk</b> products those put on the market in Banda Aceh have been complied with the requirement standard of SNI 01 - 2981 - 1992. However, crude protein level has not achieved the requirement standard yet. Due to the amount of Staphylococcus aureus present, the <b>fermented</b> <b>milk</b> products tested, in fact, were not saved to be consumed. On the contrary, although Coliform was also present, the products were in the category of saved to be consumed...|$|R
