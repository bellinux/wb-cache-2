5|$|The {{principal}} façade is {{the great}} south front, a two-storey colonnade of Corinthian columns superimposed on Tuscan, the whole surmounted by a central pediment. The columns are not stone, but wood coated in stucco. It is possible this facade was inspired by work done in Paris on the church of S. Sulpice by Giovanni Niccolo Servandoni who was working in England from 1747–51; some drawings made for Sir Francis Dashwood in emulation of his uncle's patronage of Palladian style, survive by him in the collection at West Wycombe. The executant architect for this elevation and {{for much of the}} work on the house appears to have been the minor architectural view painter John Donowell, who worked between 1761 and 1763 (although he had to wait until 1775 for payment). The façade, which has similarities to the main façade of Palladio's Palazzo Chiericati of 1550, was originally the entrance front. The front door is still in the centre of the ground floor leading into the main entry hall. This is a substantial deviation from the classical form of English Palladianism in which the main entrance and principal rooms would be on the first floor reached by an outer staircase, giving the main reception rooms elevated views, with the ground floor given over to service rooms. Such a radical re-arrangement was not possible <b>here</b> <b>since</b> <b>the</b> house was a partial rebuild rather than a wholly new structure.|$|E

25|$|The {{existence}} of a monastic community <b>here</b> <b>since</b> <b>the</b> seventh century is proved by gravestones. In 794, even before {{the completion of the}} buildings, Fastrada, one of the wives of Charlemagne, was buried here. Charlemagne co-financed the construction. Later the Archbishops of Mainz had their last resting-place here, which was previously, until the time of Saint Boniface, at St. Hilarius's.|$|E
25|$|This {{section was}} created without {{reference}} to the original paper and there are some errors in it (for instance, the ionic strength is off by a factor of two). Once these are rectified, this section should probably be moved to the nondimensionalization article and then be linked from <b>here,</b> <b>since</b> <b>the</b> nondimensional version of the Poisson–Boltzmann equation isn't necessary to understand the D theory.|$|E
25|$|Drúadan Forest: Pine-woods {{that covered}} {{outskirts}} of the White Mountains in east Anórien, south of the Great West Road. Its name, which is a partial translation of Sindarin Tawar-in-Drúedain, derives {{from the fact that}} the forest was populated by the Drúedain or the Wild Men, who survived <b>here</b> <b>since</b> <b>the</b> First Age and shunned the Númenóreans. After Aragorn was crowned he made the Forest an independent state under Gondor's protection.|$|E

25|$|MR {{images have}} also been {{obtained}} from the brain of a 3200-year-old Egyptian mummy. The perspectives are slim, however, that any three-dimensional imaging dataset of a fossil, semi-fossil or mummified brain will ever be of much use to morphometric analyses of the kind described <b>here,</b> <b>since</b> <b>the</b> processes of mummification and fossilization heavily alter the structure of soft tissues in a way specific to the individual specimen and subregions therein.|$|E
25|$|The end {{of history}} is, alas, also {{the end of the}} dustbins of history. There are no longer any dustbins for {{disposing}} of old ideologies, old regimes, old values. Where are we going to throw Marxism, which actually invented the dustbins of history? (Yet there is some justice <b>here</b> <b>since</b> <b>the</b> very people who invented them have fallen in.) Conclusion: if there are no more dustbins of history, this is because History itself has become a dustbin. It has become its own dustbin, just as the planet itself is becoming its own dustbin.|$|E
25|$|The {{line between}} Sukkerhusbryggen and Bradbenken opened on 3 July 1897. However, demand was poor. In 1900, the section between Sukkerhusbryggen and Engen was {{replaced}} by the line to Kalfaret, and at the opposite end the tram {{was replaced by}} another between Mariakirken and Bradbenken. This was actually a beside track to the Sandviken Line. Demand was also poor <b>here.</b> <b>Since</b> <b>the</b> Sandviken Line's tracks were in Øvregaten, it often took more time to take the tram from Torget to Bradbenken than to walk. It was therefore closed the same year. The intersection between Engen and Sukkerhusbryggen was served by the Line 2 until it closed in 1910.|$|E

25|$|Although {{the clay}} soil {{is not very}} fertile, the high {{rainfall}} and warm weather mean that the island is densely forested throughout. Native plants include the world's southernmost dense forest of podocarps (southern conifers) and hardwoods such as rātā and kāmahi in the lowland areas with mānuka shrubland at higher elevations. The trees {{are thought to have}} become established <b>here</b> <b>since</b> <b>the</b> last ice age from seeds brought across the strait by seabirds, which would explain why the beech trees that are so common in New Zealand, but whose seeds are dispersed by the wind rather than birds, are not found on Stewart Island.|$|E
25|$|The Coachella Valley has a Jewish community, and {{according}} to the United Jewish Citizens of the Desert, the Coachella Valley has an estimated 20,000 American Jews, one of California's largest Jewish communities, a result of being a major retirement destination and connections to the Hollywood film industry. Many faiths and denominations are represented in the area, the largest church being Roman Catholic belonging to the church's regional diocese of San Bernardino. There is also a sizable Mormon community, settling <b>here</b> <b>since</b> <b>the</b> early 1900s, with three stakes formerly branches of The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints which experienced rapid growth and Mormons form a large population in the Inland Empire (California) and High Desert (California) regions. The Islamic Society of the Coachella Valley has a mosque in the city of Coachella which serves the local Muslim population.|$|E

Adam was tortured as part of the Nazis' research into his immortality, leaving him with a hatred of the Nazis and a sympathy for other Holocaust survivors, including Abe. Adam first appeared as Henry's appointed psychiatrist and convinced a patient that he could pass on his immortality. [...] Adam continued {{to try to find a}} lost dagger, one that not only caused Adam's first death but also was used to kill Julius Caesar. [...] Adam appears in five episodes.|$|E
500|$|The next {{bridge is}} the Town Bridge. There {{has been a}} bridge <b>here</b> <b>since</b> <b>the</b> 13th century, when Bridgwater was granted a charter by King John.

In March 1958 a new reinforced concrete road bridge, the Blake Bridge, was opened as part of a bypass to take traffic away from the centre of Bridgwater. It now carries the A38 and A39 roads.

Slightly further east is a modern concrete bridge which carries the M5 motorway over both the river and the railway line. It was started in 1971 and opened in 1973.|$|E
