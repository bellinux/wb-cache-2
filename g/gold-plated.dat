5|$|The Finsta Chapel or St Eric's Chapel on the north-west {{corner of}} the chancel houses the relics of Eric the Holy, {{the patron saint of}} Sweden, who was killed in 1160 on the site where Uppsala Cathedral was later built. His shrine was moved from the first cathedral in Gamla Uppsala as soon as work began on the new building. In 1580, King John III melted his shrine down but {{replaced}} it with a new <b>gold-plated</b> one which still contains Eric's relics and crown. The name Finsta originates from the Uppland estate where Judge Birger Persson and his wife were born. They were entombed in the chapel in 1328. A relic of their daughter Saint Bridget housed in a small <b>gold-plated</b> shrine was donated by the Saint Bridget Order in 1990.|$|E
5|$|This new trophy is not {{awarded to}} the winning nation permanently. World Cup winners retain the trophy only until the post-match celebration is finished. They are awarded a <b>gold-plated</b> replica rather than the solid gold {{original}} immediately afterwards.|$|E
5|$|Behind his seemingly-perfect life of glamorous friends, <b>gold-plated</b> tyre swings, and {{personal}} chefs, {{there is a}} dark history of medical experiments, addiction and loss. But Bubbles has fought against his personal and professional problems and, with his help of man-pet Michael Jackson, he has grown to become bigger than King Kong—figuratively speaking.|$|E
5|$|In 1952, {{following}} {{pressure from}} Tesla's nephew, Sava Kosanović, Tesla's entire estate was shipped to Belgrade in 80 trunks marked N.T. In 1957, Kosanović's secretary Charlotte Muzar transported Tesla's ashes from the United States to Belgrade. The ashes {{are displayed in}} a <b>gold-plated</b> sphere on a marble pedestal in the Nikola Tesla Museum.|$|E
5|$|The James Webb Space Telescope {{will have}} 18 {{hexagonal}} beryllium sections for its mirrors. Because JWST {{will face a}} temperature of 33 K, the mirror is made of <b>gold-plated</b> beryllium, capable of handling extreme cold better than glass. Beryllium contracts and deforms less than glass – and remains more uniform – in such temperatures. For the same reason, the optics of the Spitzer Space Telescope are entirely built of beryllium metal.|$|E
5|$|The Sovereign came in satin chrome and <b>gold-plated</b> models, {{with leather}} pouches and fitted wooden cases. It had an 8-digit seven-segment display that used red {{light-emitting}} diodes, with a decimal {{point to the}} right of each digit that could be illuminated as necessary. Power was provided by two 1.35 mercury button cells. The Sovereign measured , which made it small and sleek compared to other calculators of the time.|$|E
5|$|Norton {{spent his}} days {{inspecting}} San Francisco's streets in an elaborate blue uniform with <b>gold-plated</b> epaulettes, {{given to him by}} officers of the United States Army post at the Presidio of San Francisco. He also wore a beaver hat decorated with a peacock feather and a rosette. He frequently enhanced this regal posture with a cane or umbrella. During his inspections, Norton would examine the condition of the sidewalks and cable cars, the state of repair of public property, and the appearance of police officers. Norton would also frequently give lengthy philosophical expositions on a variety of topics to anyone within earshot.|$|E
5|$|On April 6, {{the cannon}} {{appeared}} {{in front of}} the Green Building sporting a giant 21-pound <b>gold-plated</b> aluminum Brass Rat around its barrel, which was positioned to point towards Pasadena, and female MIT students mockingly posted pictures of themselves posing in bikinis with the cannon. It was revealed that preparations for the heist had been underway since December. MIT was softly criticized for not leaving a note explaining that the theft was a prank, as required by Caltech's pranking ethics, which were said to be more stringent than MIT's, but the prank was largely taken in good humor at both campuses.|$|E
5|$|A Limited Edition of {{the game}} was {{confirmed}} on February 20, 2008. On July 14, 2008, {{more information about the}} Limited Edition's contents was revealed. The edition features alternative cover art, a SteelBook case with a bonus content DVD, a book entitled Beneath the Surface: An Inside Look at Gears of War 2, which includes concept art and story-related information, a keepsake photo of Dominic and Maria, and an exclusive Xbox Live code to unlock a <b>gold-plated</b> Lancer for online play. As a bonus item promoted by electronics store Best Buy, customers who preordered the Limited Edition also received a bonus Remote Control Centaur Tank replica, just like the new vehicle introduced in the game, free of charge.|$|E
5|$|During the Mongol {{invasion}} in 1240, the monastery {{is believed to}} have been damaged seriously. The Mongols damaged the cathedral and removed its <b>gold-plated</b> domes. The cloister subsequently fell into disrepair and there is no documentation of it for the following two and a half centuries. By 1496, the monastery had been revived and its name was changed from St. Demetrius' Monastery to St. Michael's after the cathedral church built by Sviatopolk II. After numerous restorations and enlargements during the sixteenth century, it gradually became one of the most popular and wealthiest monasteries in Ukraine. In 1620, Iov Boretsky made it the residence of the renewed Orthodox metropolitan of Kiev, and in 1633, Isaya Kopynsky was named a supervisor of the monastery.|$|E
5|$|Sennheiser sound {{equipment}} {{was used for}} the audio. According to Matt Napier, Madonna's monitor engineer, they used Sennheiser's Wireless Systems Manager software to tweak frequencies. Madonna used an HSP 4 headset {{at the beginning of the}} show, later switching to a Sennheiser SKM 5200-II handheld transmitter. Sennheiser transmitters were also used by Minaj, M.I.A. and LMFAO, and Green's microphone used an MD 5235 capsule. Napier said in a Mix article that they needed <b>gold-plated</b> transmitters for Madonna and Green, which were provided by Sennheiser the day of the show. Professional Wireless Systems (PWS), a Masque Sound company, were in charge of wireless sound monitoring; in a series of trial runs, PWS chose a frequency that eliminated interference from other systems.|$|E
5|$|The West Point Museum is {{directly}} {{adjacent to the}} visitor's center, in the renovated Olmsted Hall {{on the grounds of}} the former Ladycliff College. Originally opened to the public in 1854, the West Point Museum is the oldest military museum in the country. During the summer months, the museum operates access to the Fort Putnam historic site on main post and access to the 282 acre Constitution Island. Some of the most notable items on display at the museum are George Washington's pistols, Napoleon's sword, a dagger carried by Hermann Goering when he was captured, a revolver that belonged to Goering, and a silver-plated party book, signed by Charles Lindbergh, Herbert Hoover and Mussolini, among others. Arguably, the most prized artifact on display is a <b>gold-plated</b> pistol that belonged to Adolf Hitler.|$|E
5|$|When {{the title}} was created, a {{suggested}} medal was drafted and designed by the government. The major difference between this medal and the current medal is {{the design of the}} suspension and the star medallion at the bottom: the top suspension is longer than the bottom, and the bottom star is outlined differently and is adorned with rubies. The suspension was made from <b>gold-plated</b> silver, while the suspension of the current medal is made from gold, as the medal. The design of the star evokes the Marshal's Star, which Soviet Marshals wore around their necks. This medal was adopted by Presidential Decree Number 26 on May 15, 1996.|$|E
5|$|In Britain {{the use of}} {{elaborate}} {{symbols of}} authority developed about 15,000 years ago during the Upper Paleolithic. Ivory rods, carved antlers, painted animal skulls, and other objects were buried with tribal leaders at caves in Somerset and Derbyshire. Later, around 2400BCE (BC), a group of peoples from mainland Europe known as Beaker folk conquered most of Britain. This warrior race had a tradition of investing their new leaders with polished ceremonial axes made of green quartzite, red tourmaline, and jadeite. Excavations at Bush Barrow, Wiltshire, unearthed an early example of a sceptre, decorated with bone in a zig-zag pattern, and topped by a stone. Archaeologists believe it and other treasures found in the grave may have belonged to the ruling family who built Stonehenge. By 1600 BCE, the rulers of southern Britain wore gold epaulettes, gold brooches, and <b>gold-plated</b> bronze daggers. A ceremonial gold cloak of the same period, the Mold cape, was found at a Bronze Age burial mound in Flintshire, Wales, in 1833.|$|E
5|$|The National Collegiate Athletic Association (NCAA) Men's Division I Basketball Championship, or NCAA Tournament, is a single-elimination {{tournament for}} men's college {{basketball}} {{teams in the}} United States. It determines the champion of Division I, the top level of play in the NCAA, and the media often describes the winner as the national champion of college basketball. The NCAA Tournament has been held annually since 1939, and its field grew from eight teams in the beginning to sixty-five teams by 2001; as of 2011, sixty-eight teams {{take part in the}} tournament. Teams can gain invitations by winning a conference championship or receiving an at-large bid from a 10-person committee. The semifinals of the tournament are known as the Final Four and are held in a different city each year, along with the championship game; Indianapolis, the city where the NCAA is based, will host the Final Four every five years until 2040. Each winning university receives a rectangular, <b>gold-plated</b> trophy made of wood.|$|E
5|$|The athletes or teams who place first, second, {{or third}} in each event receive medals. The winners receive gold medals, which were solid gold until 1912, then made of gilded silver and now <b>gold-plated</b> silver. Every gold medal however must contain {{at least six}} grams of pure gold. The runners-up receive silver medals and the third-place athletes are awarded bronze medals. In events contested by a single-elimination tournament (most notably boxing), third place might not be {{determined}} and both semifinal losers receive bronze medals. At the 1896 Olympics only the first two received a medal; silver for first and bronze for second. The current three-medal format was introduced at the 1904 Olympics. From 1948 onward athletes placing fourth, fifth, and sixth have received certificates, which became officially known as victory diplomas; in 1984 victory diplomas for seventh- and eighth-place finishers were added. At the 2004 Summer Olympics in Athens, the gold, silver, and bronze medal winners were also given olive wreaths. The IOC does not keep statistics of medals won, but National Olympic Committees and the media record medal statistics {{as a measure of}} success.|$|E
5|$|There {{were some}} {{similarities}} between Ernő and Auric: both were Jewish immigrants {{who came to}} Britain from Eastern Europe in the 1930s and both were Marxists, although they were physically very different. The likely model for Goldfinger was American gold tycoon Charles W. Engelhard, Jr., who Fleming had met in 1949. Englehard had established a company, the Precious Metals Development Company, which circumvented numerous export restrictions, selling gold ingots directly into Hong Kong. Fleming had reinforced his knowledge of gold by sending a questionnaire to an expert at the Worshipful Company of Goldsmiths, one of the Livery Companies of the City of London {{with a list of}} queries about gold, its properties and the background of the industry, including smuggling. Fleming himself liked gold enough to commission a <b>gold-plated</b> typewriter from the Royal Typewriter Company, although he never actually used it. In 1995, this machine was purchased by the Bond actor, Pierce Brosnan.|$|E

25|$|Layers of {{intermetallics}} {{can form}} between the solder and the soldered material. These layers may cause mechanical reliability weakening and brittleness, increased electrical resistance, or electromigration and formation of voids. The gold-tin intermetallics layer {{is responsible for}} poor mechanical reliability of tin-soldered <b>gold-plated</b> surfaces where the gold plating did not completely dissolve in the solder.|$|E
