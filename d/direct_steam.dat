50|$|Reactor {{pressure}} in a BWR {{is controlled by}} the main turbine or main steam bypass valves. Unlike a PWR, where the turbine steam demand is set manually by the operators, in a BWR, the turbine valves will modulate to maintain reactor pressure at a setpoint.

When the turbine is offline or trips, the main steam bypass/dump valves will open to <b>direct</b> <b>steam</b> directly to the condenser. These bypass valves will automatically or manually modulate as necessary to maintain reactor pressure and control the reactor's heatup and cooldown rates while steaming is still in progress.|$|E
