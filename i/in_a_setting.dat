5|$|Final Fantasy Fables is a Final Fantasy spinoff {{starring}} a Chocobo <b>in</b> <b>a</b> <b>setting</b> {{which features}} common elements and {{creatures of the}} series. Music {{from the rest of}} the series is also reused. The game is composed of a number of minigames woven into a main adventure. The game was received positively by critics, who appreciated the originality and light-hearted nature of the title.|$|E
5|$|Kid Icarus: Uprising {{takes place}} <b>in</b> <b>a</b> <b>setting</b> based loosely around Greek mythology. The main protagonist is the angel Pit, {{servant of the}} Goddess of Light Palutena. When the Goddess of Darkness Medusa returns to destroy humanity, Pit goes on {{missions}} first against her, then {{against the forces of}} Hades, Lord of the Underworld and the source behind Medusa's return. During gameplay, players control Pit during airborne rail shooter segments and ground-based third-person shooter segments. In addition to the single-player campaign, multiple multiplayer modes are available, with competitive modes available for up to six players.|$|E
5|$|The Hickmans {{began work}} on Ravenloft in the late 1970s, intent on {{creating}} a frightening portrait of a vampire <b>in</b> <b>a</b> <b>setting</b> that combined Gothic horror with the D game system. They play-tested the adventure {{with a group of}} players each Halloween for five years before it was published. Strahd has since appeared in a number of D accessories and novels. The module has inspired numerous revisions and adaptations, including a campaign setting of the same name and a sequel. In 1999, on the 25th anniversary of Dungeons & Dragons, two commemorative versions of Ravenloft were released.|$|E

Zane appears, and tells Alan that it is himself—the maniacal figure on the televisions—that is keeping him in the Dark Place. Alan refuses {{to believe that he}} is {{trapping}} himself, but soon faces a monstrosity of several televisions, with the irrational Alan on them that tries to kill him. Alan is able to defeat the crazed version of himself, waking up back at the cabin in the lake, and realizes that he is still trapped.|$|E
5|$|The {{fish and}} {{bivalves}} {{were found in}} clay which was probably a lagoon, and the dinosaurs and lizards in sand which probably was land, perhaps a beach; turtles and crocodiles were found in both. Freshwater snails were found in clay {{that may have been}} shallow, drying lakes behind a sandy barrier between lagoon and sea, <b>in</b> <b>a</b> <b>setting</b> perhaps similar to the Florida Keys or the southwestern coast of Jutland. Dinosaurs may have fed there, based on the remains of plants and small land animals, and theropods may have hunted along the shore. Bornholm and Scania appear to be the only places were remains of the Scandinavian-Russian fauna of the Early Cretaceous can be found. Further investigations there may show whether this fauna has European or Asian affinities.|$|E
5|$|The term Regency {{architecture}} refers {{primarily to}} {{buildings of the}} early 19th century, when GeorgeIV was still Prince Regent, and also to later buildings of the Victorian period which were designed in the same style. It follows closely on from the neo-classical Georgian style of architecture, adding an elegance and lightness of touch. Many buildings in the Regency style have a white painted stucco facade and an entryway to the main front door—usually coloured black—framed by two columns. Regency houses were typically built as terraces or crescents, often <b>in</b> <b>a</b> <b>setting</b> of trees and shrubs. Elegant wrought iron balconies and bow windows were also fashionable. An instigator of this style was John Nash, whose most notable work in Bristol is Blaise Hamlet, a complex of small cottages surrounding a green. It was built around 1811, for the retired employees of Quaker banker and philanthropist John Scandrett Harford, who owned Blaise Castle House. The cottages are now owned by the National Trust.|$|E

25|$|Historical romance (also {{historical}} novel) {{is a broad}} {{category of}} fiction which the plot takes place <b>in</b> <b>a</b> <b>setting</b> located in the past, which Walter Scott helped popularize in the early 19th-century, with works such as Rob Roy and Ivanhoe. Literary fiction historical romances continue to be published, and a notable recent example is Wolf Hall (2009), a multi-award winning novel by English historical novelist Hilary Mantel. However, the focus here is on the mass-market genre.|$|E
25|$|However, these did {{not have}} the erotic context which characterizes modern omorashi media, since they predated the first {{full-blown}} anime pornography, which was not available until 1984, when the advent of the first H anime OVAs such as Wonder Kids' Lolita Anime were made possible by the widespread availability of home video. One example of this later erotic context is the 1994 H anime OVA Vixens, which features scenes of incontinence <b>in</b> <b>a</b> <b>setting</b> that is overtly sexual.|$|E

My Name Is Red has been translated into 24 languages and in 2003 won the International Dublin Literary Award, the world's most lucrative literary prize.|$|E

25|$|The {{difficulty}} using oxytocin is that {{it needs}} to be kept below a certain temperature which requires resources such as fridges which are not always available particularly in low-resourced settings. When oxytocin is not available, misoprostol can be used. Misoprostol {{does not need to be}} kept at a certain temperature and research into its effectiveness in reducing blood loss appears promising when compared with a placebo <b>in</b> <b>a</b> <b>setting</b> where it is not appropriate to use oxytocin. Misoprostol can cause unpleasant side effects such as very high body temperatures and shivering. Lower doses of misoprostol appear to be safer and cause less side effects.|$|E
25|$|Television shows {{featuring}} Muppets {{have included}} The Jimmy Dean Show, Sesame Street, The Muppet Show, Fraggle Rock, Bear in the Big Blue House, The Jim Henson Hour, Muppets Tonight, , and The Muppets. A recurring adult-oriented cast of Muppets (<b>in</b> <b>a</b> <b>setting</b> known as The Land of Gorch) were featured throughout {{the first season}} of Saturday Night Live. Guest stars {{on some of these}} programs have occasionally had Muppet versions of themselves. It was a regular practice for the first few episodes of The Muppet Show, and ZZ Top, among others, have appeared as Muppet versions of themselves on Sesame Street. Muppet versions of real people have also appeared in other shows, such as in 30 Rock.|$|E
25|$|The poem {{is written}} in the first person, and is the soliloquy {{of a young woman}} contemplating life and death, {{engagement}} and withdrawal, love and estrangement, <b>in</b> <b>a</b> <b>setting</b> dominated by the sea, the sky, stars, rocky cliffs, and the rising sun. However, it is also possible to read the poem as an allegory on the way fate moves human affairs or as an attempt to comprehend the horrific violence in Europe {{at the time of the}} poem's composition. The poem is not about World War I, but it does try to address the relationships between destruction and beauty, and, in this sense, it resonates with ancient Greek meditations on these matters, especially in the plays of Sophocles and Aeschylus. There are, therefore, evident links with le Cimetière marin, which is also a seaside meditation on comparably large themes.|$|E
