40|$|In this study, polyamide-aluminum foil-polypropylene (PA-Al-PP) {{composite}} {{films with}} different orientation {{status of the}} PP layer were prepared, and their morphology, tensile, peeling and <b>heat</b> <b>seal</b> behavior were studied. The comparative study of tensile and fracture behaviors of single-layer film of PA, Al and PP, {{as well as the}} composite films of PA-Al, PP-Al and PA-Al-PP revealed that in PA-Al-PP composite film, the PA layer with the highest tensile strength can share the tensile stress from the Al layer during stretching, while the PP layer with the lowest tensile strength can prevent further development of the small cracks on boundary of the Al layer during stretching. Moreover, the study of <b>heat</b> <b>seal</b> behavior suggested that both the orientation status and the <b>heat</b> <b>seal</b> conditions were important factors in determining the <b>heat</b> <b>seal</b> strength (HSS) and failure behavior of the sample. Four failure types were observed, and a clear correspondence between HSS and failure types was found.

5000|$|Typical {{preparation}} of a microscale electrode is performed by <b>heat</b> <b>sealing</b> a microwire or carbon fiber {{in a glass}} capillary under vacuum.
