5|$|The operation's codename, Ring, {{referred}} to the encirclement of the towns of Getashen and Martunashen by the Soviet MVD and armed forces. A date in late April was chosen for the commencement of the operation, which called for Soviet troops to surround the towns and search the villages for both illegally procured weapons and Armenian guerrilla fighters. Reacting to the growing violence, <b>Gorbachev</b> <b>had</b> also assigned units of the Soviet 4th Army's predominantly Azerbaijani 23rd Motorized Rifle Division, stationed along the Armenian-Azerbaijani border, {{to serve as a}} buffer force. The 23rd Division and other elements of the Fourth Army were selected along with the Azerbaijani OMON to take part in Ring.|$|E
5|$|In December 1990 Ryzhkov {{suffered}} a heart attack. During his recovery, the Supreme Soviet of the Soviet Union dissolved the Council of Ministers {{and replaced it with}} the Cabinet of Ministers headed by Valentin Pavlov, Ryzhkov's former Minister of Finance. The law enacting the change was passed on 26 December 1990, but the new structure was not implemented until 14 January 1991 when Pavlov took over as Prime Minister of the Soviet Union. Between Ryzhkov's hospitalisation and Pavlov's election as Prime Minister, Lev Voronin acted as the Chairman of the Council of Ministers. The reorganisation of the government made it subordinate to the Presidency, weakening the head of government's hold on economic policy. In contrast to Hough's view that <b>Gorbachev</b> <b>had</b> little reason to remove Ryzhkov, Gordon M. Hahn argues that there were good reasons to replace him given that with Ryzhkov's Politburo support much reduced, the reformist opposition saw him as a conservative.|$|E

In the aftermath of the coup, his rival Yeltsin quickly worked to consolidate his hold on the Russian government as well as the remnants of the Soviet armed forces, paving the way for Gorbachev's downfall.|$|E

25|$|The {{political}} and economic reforms that General Secretary Mikhail <b>Gorbachev</b> <b>had</b> initiated in 1985 saw a marked decentralization of Soviet authority. Armenians, in both Armenia proper and Nagorno-Karabakh, viewed Gorbachev's reform program {{as an opportunity to}} unite the two together. On February 20, 1988, tens of thousands of Armenians gathered to demonstrate in Stepanakert's Lenin Square (now Renaissance Square) Square to demand that the region be joined to Armenia. On the same day, the Supreme Soviet of Nagorno-Karabakh voted to join the Armenian SSR, a move staunchly opposed by the Soviet Azerbaijani authorities. Relations between Stepankert's Armenians and Azerbaijanis, who supported the Azerbaijani government's position, deteriorated in the following years and as a result, nearly all of the Azerbaijanis fled the city.|$|E

25|$|On 11 October 1986, Gorbachev and Reagan met at Höfði {{house in}} Reykjavík, Iceland, to discuss {{reducing}} intermediate-range {{nuclear weapons in}} Europe. To the immense surprise of both men's advisers, the two agreed in principle to removing INF systems from Europe and to equal global limits of 100 INF missile warheads. They also essentially agreed in principle to eliminate all nuclear weapons in 10 years (by 1996), instead of by the year 2000 as in Gorbachev's original outline. Continuing trust issues, particularly over reciprocity and Reagan's Strategic Defense Initiative (SDI), meant that the summit is often regarded as a failure for not producing a concrete agreement immediately, or for leading to a staged elimination of nuclear weapons. In the long term, nevertheless, this would culminate in {{the signing of the}} Intermediate-Range Nuclear Forces (INF) Treaty in 1987, after <b>Gorbachev</b> <b>had</b> proposed this elimination on 22 July 1987 (and it was subsequently agreed on in Geneva on 24 November).|$|E

500|$|On 4 July, Gorbachev {{declared}} that the region was stabilizing, and announced {{an end to the}} operation. In both military and strategic terms, Operation Ring was a failure. The aim of disarming the Armenian volunteer groups was never achieved. Despite the presence of helicopter gunships and armored vehicles, the militiamen managed to elude and evade capture. Ring, however, managed to reinforce the ethnic divide between Armenians and Azerbaijanis, [...] "virtually precluding," [...] according to Michael Croissant [...] "the possibility of further coexistence between the peoples within" [...] Azerbaijan's borders. Gorbachev and other Soviet officials maintained that Ring was necessary to prevent the region from further deteriorating into chaos and as the militias' presence contravened the July 1990 presidential decree.

500|$|According to Swedish {{economist}} Anders Åslund, Ryzhkov differed {{little from}} Gorbachev {{when it came}} to price reform. There were, however, subtle differences between the two men's views, with Ryzhkov supporting an administratively controlled price increase while Gorbachev, as a radical economist who supported market reform, opposed such measures. As Hough noted, Ryzhkov supported [...] "the need for greater fiscal responsibility", while Gorbachev advocated the need for more rational prices which, according to Hough, would have brought inflation under control. Ryzhkov proposed price reform measures to Gorbachev several times but was turned down on each occasions, even though <b>Gorbachev</b> <b>had</b> argued strongly on the need for price reform in his speeches. Gorbachev strengthened his public image by accusing the Soviet leadership's conservative faction together with Ryzhkov, of delaying implementation of the necessary price reform. Ryzhkov had the backing of several high-standing institutions, such as the Ministry of Finance and the State Committee on Prices, chaired by the future Soviet Premier Valentin Pavlov. In contrast to Gorbachev, Ryzhkov actually had, according to Hough, a plan for a transition to a market economy. Gorbachev on the other hand was never able to turn words into deeds.|$|E
500|$|Ideology {{was a key}} {{component}} of Soviet foreign policy. Soviet diplomacy was built on the ideas of Marxism-Leninism; Vladimir Lenin understood that compromise is an important element in foreign diplomacy and was a proponent of peaceful coexistence with the capitalist powers. A primary goal of the emphasis placed on coexistence and compromise was to “prevent the imperialist states from attacking the USSR while it was restoring the Russian economy following the Civil War and, later, while it was undertaking industrial development. Therefore, [...] "certain agreements with the imperialist countries in the interest of socialism" [...] could sometimes be reached. The relationship between policy and ideology remained an active issue until the dissolution of the Soviet Union. According to an unknown former director of the Moscow State Institute of International Relations, all successful diplomatic activities by the Soviet side were based on the principles of Marxism-Leninism and the Soviet evaluation of other countries in certain fields, such as social development. The Directorate for Planning Foreign Policy Measures, an organ of the MER, analysed international relations and tried to predict future events, although it never actually planned the policy of the MER. Soviet foreign affairs minister Eduard Shevardnadze claimed that Soviet foreign policy, and the [...] "new thinking" [...] approach laid out by <b>Gorbachev,</b> <b>had</b> become the cornerstone of maintaining stable diplomatic relations throughout the world.|$|E
2500|$|Although {{restored}} to his position, <b>Gorbachev</b> <b>had</b> been destroyed politically. Neither union nor Russian power structures heeded his commands as support had swung over to Yeltsin. [...] Taking {{advantage of the}} situation, Yeltsin began taking {{what remained of the}} Soviet government, ministry by ministry—including the Kremlin. On 6 November 1991, Yeltsin issued a decree banning all Communist Party activities on Russian soil. In early December 1991, Ukraine voted for independence from the Soviet Union. A week later, on 8 December, Yeltsin met Ukrainian president Leonid Kravchuk and the leader of Belarus, Stanislav Shushkevich, in Belovezhskaya Pushcha. In the Belavezha Accords, the three presidents announced the dissolution of the Soviet Union and the formation of a voluntary Commonwealth of Independent States (CIS) in its place.|$|E

2500|$|UNITA {{gained some}} {{international}} notoriety in 1983 after abducting 66 Czechoslovak civilians and detaining {{most of them}} for over a year. Belgium eventually negotiated {{the release of the}} civilians. Fighting in Angola continued until 1989, when, with Unita advancing militarily, Cuba withdrew its support, removing several thousand troops that it had dispatched to Angola to fight Savimbi's Unita. With many commentators and foreign policy specialists seeing that the Cold War might be drawing to an end, Savimbi's U.S. support, which had been strong, began to be questioned, with some in Congress urging the end of U.S. support for Unita. [...] Matters were further complicated by repeated reports that Soviet General Secretary Mikhail <b>Gorbachev</b> <b>had</b> raised U.S. support for Unita in several formal and informal summit meetings with President George H.

2500|$|On 27 October 1987 at the {{plenary meeting}} of the Central Committee of the CPSU, Yeltsin, {{frustrated}} that <b>Gorbachev</b> <b>had</b> not addressed any of the issues outlined in his resignation letter asked to speak. He expressed his discontent with both {{the slow pace of}} reform in society, the servility shown to the general secretary, and opposition to him from Ligachev making his position untenable, before requesting to resign from the Politburo, adding that the City Committee would decide whether he should resign from the post of First Secretary of the Moscow Communist Party. Aside from the fact that no one had ever before quit the Politburo, no one in the party had ever addressed a leader of the party in such a manner in front of the Central Committee since Leon Trotsky in the 1920s. In his reply, Gorbachev accused Yeltsin of [...] "political immaturity" [...] and [...] "absolute irresponsibility". Nobody in the Central Committee backed Yeltsin.|$|E

On the same day, the Supreme Soviet of Nagorno-Karabakh voted to join the Armenian SSR, a move staunchly opposed by the Soviet Azerbaijani authorities. Gorbachev rejected these claims, invoking Article 78 of the Soviet Constitution, which stated that republics' borders could not be altered without their prior consent. The vote by the Council and the subsequent protests were condemned also by the state-run Soviet media; however, they resonated more loudly among Azerbaijanis. As journalist Thomas de Waal wrote in his 2003 book on the conflict, after the appeal of the Council [...] "the slow descent into armed conﬂict began on the ﬁrst day." ...|$|E
25|$|Since his resignation, <b>Gorbachev</b> <b>has</b> {{remained}} {{involved in}} world affairs. He founded the Gorbachev Foundation in 1992, headquartered in Moscow.

2500|$|President of the United States George H. W. Bush and {{chancellor}} of West Germany Helmut Kohl urged peaceful reforms and criticised the Molotov–Ribbentrop Pact. On 31 August, the Baltic activists issued a joint declaration to Javier Pérez de Cuéllar, Secretary-General of the United Nations. They {{claimed to be}} under threat of aggression and asked for an international commission {{to be sent to}} monitor the situation. Almost immediately after the broadcast the tone in Moscow began to soften [...] and the Soviet authorities failed to follow up on any of their threats. Eventually, according to historian Alfred Erich Senn, the pronouncement became a source of embarrassment. On 19-20 September, the Central Committee of the Communist Party convened to discuss the nationality question – something Mikhail <b>Gorbachev</b> <b>had</b> been postponing since early 1988. The plenum did not specifically address the situation in the Baltic states and reaffirmed old principles regarding the centralised Soviet Union and the dominant role of the Russian language. It did promise some increase in autonomy, but was contradictory and failed to address the underlying reasons for the conflict.|$|E
2500|$|Gorbachev's {{election}} to the General Secretaryship was the quickest in Soviet history. The Politburo recommended Gorbachev to the Central Committee, and the Central Committee approved him. The Politburo meeting, which elected Gorbachev to the General Secretaryship, did not include such members as Dinmukhamed Konayev, Volodymyr Shcherbytsky and Vitaly Vorotnikov. Of these three, Konayev and Shcherbytsky were Brezhnevites, and Vorotnikov, while not supporting Gorbachev, {{took it for granted}} that Gorbachev would succeed Chernenko. It is conceivable, according to historian Archie Brown, that Konayev and Shcherbytsky would rather have voted in favour of Viktor Grishin as General Secretary, than Gorbachev. At the same meeting, Grishin was asked to chair the commission responsible for Chernenko's funeral; Grishin turned down the offer, claiming that Gorbachev was closer to Chernenko than he was. By doing this, he practically signaled his support for Gorbachev's ascension to the General Secretaryship. Andrei Gromyko, the longtime foreign minister, proposed Gorbachev as a candidate for the General Secretaryship. The Politburo and the Central Committee elected Gorbachev as General Secretary unanimously. Ryzhkov, in retrospect, claimed that the Soviet system had [...] "created, nursed and formed" [...] Gorbachev, but that [...] "long ago <b>Gorbachev</b> <b>had</b> internally rebelled against the native System." [...] In the same vein, Gorbachev's adviser Andrey Grachev, noted that he was a [...] "genetic error of the system." ...|$|E
2500|$|Reagan and Soviet General Secretary Mikhail <b>Gorbachev</b> <b>had</b> {{achieved}} closer relations during Reagan's second term, but Bush {{was initially}} skeptical of Soviet intentions. In 1989, {{just after the}} fall of the Berlin Wall, Bush met with Gorbachev in a conference on the Mediterranean island of Malta. The administration had been under intense pressure to meet with the Soviets, but not all initially found the Malta Summit to be a step in the right direction; Scowcroft, among others, was apprehensive about the meeting, saying that it might be [...] "premature" [...] due to concerns where, according to Condoleezza Rice, [...] "expectations [...] set that something was going to happen, where the Soviets might grandstand and force [...] into agreements that would ultimately not be good for the United States." [...] But European leaders, including François Mitterrand and Margaret Thatcher, encouraged Bush to meet with Gorbachev, something that he did December 2 and 3, 1989. Though no agreements were signed, the meeting was viewed largely as being an important one; when asked about nuclear war, Gorbachev responded, [...] "I assured the President of the United States that the Soviet Union would never start a hot war against the United States of America. And we would like our relations to develop in such a way that they would open greater possibilities for cooperation.... This is just the beginning. We are just at the very beginning of our road, long road to a long-lasting, peaceful period." ...|$|E
