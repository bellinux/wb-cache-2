The longest stretch came near the end, {{in the form of an}} extended riff on MacBeth involving Homer killing a ton of people. But aside from the occasional random line or two, it was pretty much a boring retelling of the tale, with Simpsons characters subbing in for Shakespearean ones. So I <b>guess</b> <b>the</b> <b>question</b> is: How much pleasure is there to milk from seeing familiar yellow people reenact parts of Ayn Rand's The Fountainhead?

The analysis of answers to profile question “Father’s surname” in the learning phase revealed that, 64 % of participants had a common surname as their fathers’ and can be vulnerable to guessing attack.|$|R
40|$|A {{criminal}} history may provide more clues about future serious crime {{than has been}} appreciated in the past. Evidence of routine and low tariff crime have long been good predictors of future crime. The focus in predicting reconviction has been largely {{on the amount of}} crime that has been committed. An analysis of research encourages the notion that the type of crime that has been committed is also important in understanding the likelihood of future serious crime. Trying to probe the likely effect of changes of societal response to serious sexual assault by considering hypothetical models is a way forward to the challenge ahead of rethinking sexual crimes. It demonstrates that, as the reporting of serious sexual assault increases, the conviction rate needs to rise markedly to conquer a general feeling that matters are deteriorating rather than improving. The rise needed is much greater than most would have <b>guessed.</b> <b>The</b> <b>question</b> is whether <b>the</b> criminal careers of most sex offenders are really as short as some of the research suggests. The possible value of developing a social laboratory in a local area is suggested in order to begin to understand the changes {{over long periods of time}} in sex offenses. The dangers of “criminal apartheid” are highlighted. The major point is that there is still much to learn about sex crime. Ideas are developed following a systematic study of sex crime in one town, Lancaster, in the northwest of England, derived from the search of the local newspaper over a period of 120 years, 1860 through 1979. 14 notes, 4 figures, 13 reference...|$|R

This involves a form of Russian Roulette with a small Chinese rocket launcher with the sights removed, meaning it cannot be determined which end is which. McClane then asks Gruber some riddles similar to the ones he played in New York. When Gruber gets a riddle wrong, McClane forces him at gunpoint to fire the launcher, which blows Gruber to bits.

The answer to each problem served as a number in a combination lock which, when opened, would release the prize money. Players had a maximum of 10 minutes on the dam, and could not rappel a second time if they reached the bottom early. Once at the bottom, the player would radio to the trustworthy player their <b>guesses</b> on <b>the</b> <b>questions</b> they had seen. Unknown to the other players, the last player was briefed about <b>the</b> four <b>questions</b> after <b>the</b> other players had already gone.

40|$|Key words: SQ 3 R Technique, Students’ Reading Achievement. 	One of the {{techniques}} used in teaching reading is SQ 3 R. SQ 3 R is a reading strategy {{that can be used}} when students are expected to read and remember content material. It is a method for studying text and this strategy has five Steps: Survey, Question, Read, Recite and Review. For survey step, students survey the whole text in order to know roughly what the text tells about. While, for <b>the</b> <b>question</b> step is students will question themselves or create <b>the</b> <b>question</b> by themselves from the reading text that they have just surveyed. They will <b>guess</b> <b>the</b> <b>questions</b> that are commonly asked by the writer and keep <b>the</b> <b>questions</b> in their mind or they can write {{on a piece of paper}} <b>the</b> <b>questions</b> that they have created. The next step is that the students should read the text carefully in order to have a good comprehension of the reading text. The fourth step is to recite. In this step, the students should retell the material they have just read in order to have a better understanding. The final step is to review; the writer will ask the student’s to review the reading text in order to have a better overview of what they have learnt. In this last step, the students make conclusions or summaries of the reading text. 	The formulation of this thesis is: 1) How is students’ reading achievement before being taught by SQ 3 R technique? 2) How is the students’ reading achievement after being taught by SQ 3 R technique? 3) Is there any different score between Students’ Reading Achievement before and after teaching using SQ 3 R technique? 	The purpose the study is: 1) To find out the students’ reading achievement before taught by SQ 3 R technique, 2) To find out the students’ reading achievement after taught by SQ 3 R technique, 3) To find out significant different scores before and after taught by SQ 3 R technique, The research design was experimental research using quantitative approach. The population is all students of the eighth grade that is 41 students. Here, the researcher uses 21 students from A class as a sample research. The research instrument to collect data is test and to measure the different score before and after taught by using SQ 3 R technique is using t-test. The result showed that the students’ reading score before being taught by using SQ 3 R technique was 64. While the score after being taught by using SQ 3 R technique was 91.

30|$|Previous {{research}} suggests that challenge questions can be vulnerable to guessing attacks by friends and colleagues [20, 25]. Just and Aspinall [22] describe guessing in three categories, which are “Blind guessing”, “Focused Guessing” and “Observation”. In blind <b>guessing,</b> <b>the</b> attacker performs a brute-force attack without considering <b>the</b> <b>question.</b> In focused <b>guessing,</b> <b>the</b> attacker may still use a brute-force technique, however, the search space is cut down by considering <b>the</b> <b>question</b> type. In observation, the attacker performs an informed <b>guess</b> about both <b>the</b> user and <b>question.</b> Schechter [20] performed guessing attacks by acquaintances and statistical <b>guessing</b> in <b>the</b> context of credential recovery to evaluate security of challenge questions. We organised an informed guessing (observation) abuse case scenario {{in the context of}} online learning and examinations using the PBAF method.
