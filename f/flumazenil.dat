5|$|A {{reversal}} agent for benzodiazepines exists, <b>flumazenil</b> (Anexate). Its {{use as an}} antidote is not routinely recommended {{because of the high}} risk of resedation and seizures. In a double-blind, placebo-controlled trial of 326 people, 4 people had serious adverse events and 61% became resedated following the use of <b>flumazenil.</b> Numerous contraindications to its use exist. It is contraindicated in people with a history of long-term use of benzodiazepines, those having ingested a substance that lowers the seizure threshold or may cause an arrhythmia, and in those with abnormal vital signs. One study found that only 10% of the people presenting with a benzodiazepine overdose are suitable candidates for treatment with <b>flumazenil.</b>|$|E
5|$|Although the {{incidence}} of respiratory depression/arrest is low (0.1–0.5%) when midazolam is administered alone at normal doses, the concomitant use with CNS acting drugs, mainly analgesic opiates, may increase the possibility of hypotension, respiratory depression, respiratory arrest, and death, even at therapeutic doses. Potential drug interactions involving at least one CNS depressant were observed for 84% of midazolam users who were subsequently required to receive the benzodiazepine antagonist <b>flumazenil.</b> Therefore, efforts directed toward monitoring drug interactions and preventing injuries from midazolam administration {{are expected to have}} a substantial impact on the safe use of this drug.|$|E
5|$|A {{midazolam}} overdose {{is considered}} a medical emergency and generally requires the immediate attention of medical personnel. Benzodiazepine overdose in healthy individuals is rarely life-threatening with proper medical support; however, the toxicity of benzodiazepines increases when they are combined with other CNS depressants such as alcohol, opioids, or tricyclic antidepressants. The toxicity of benzodiazepine overdose and risk of death is also increased in the elderly and those with obstructive pulmonary disease or when used intravenously. Treatment is supportive; activated charcoal can be used {{within an hour of}} the overdose. The antidote for an overdose of midazolam (or any other benzodiazepine) is <b>flumazenil.</b> While effective in reversing the effects of benzodiazepines it is not used in most cases as it may trigger seizures in mixed overdoses and benzodiazepine dependent individuals.|$|E
25|$|<b>Flumazenil</b> is very {{effective}} at reversing the CNS depression associated with benzodiazepines but is less effective at reversing respiratory depression. One {{study found that}} only 10% of the patient population presenting with a benzodiazepine overdose are suitable candidates for <b>flumazenil.</b> In this select population who are naive to and overdose solely on a benzodiazepine, it can be considered. Due to its short half life, the duration of action of <b>flumazenil</b> is usually less than 1 hour, and multiple doses may be needed. When <b>flumazenil</b> is indicated the risks can be reduced or avoided by slow dose titration of <b>flumazenil.</b> Due to risks and its many contraindications, <b>flumazenil</b> should be administered only after discussion with a medical toxicologist.|$|E
25|$|<b>Flumazenil</b> {{was found}} to be more {{effective}} than placebo in reducing feelings of hostility and aggression in patients who had been free of benzodiazepines for 4-266 weeks. This may suggest a role for <b>flumazenil</b> in treating protracted benzodiazepine withdrawal symptoms.|$|E
25|$|<b>Flumazenil</b> {{has been}} found to stimulate the {{reversal}} of tolerance and the normalization of receptor function. However, further research is needed in the form of randomised trials to demonstrate its role in the treatment of benzodiazepine withdrawal. <b>Flumazenil</b> stimulates the up-regulation and reverses the uncoupling of benzodiazepine receptors to the GABAA receptor, thereby reversing tolerance and reducing withdrawal symptoms and relapse rates. Limited research and experience and possible risks involved, the <b>flumazenil</b> detoxification method is controversial and can only be done as an inpatient procedure under medical supervision.|$|E
25|$|A study {{into the}} effects of the {{benzodiazepine}} receptor antagonist, <b>flumazenil,</b> on benzodiazepine withdrawal symptoms persisting after withdrawal was carried out by Lader and Morton. Study subjects had been benzodiazepine-free for between one month and five years, but all reported persisting withdrawal effects to varying degrees. Persistent symptoms included clouded thinking, tiredness, muscular symptoms such as neck tension, depersonalisation, cramps and shaking and the characteristic perceptual symptoms of benzodiazepine withdrawal, namely, pins and needles feeling, burning skin, pain and subjective sensations of bodily distortion. Therapy with 0.2–2mg of <b>flumazenil</b> intravenously was found to decrease these symptoms in a placebo-controlled study. This is of interest as benzodiazepine receptor antagonists are neutral and have no clinical effects. The author of the study suggested the most likely explanation is past benzodiazepine use and subsequent tolerance had locked the conformation of the GABA-BZD receptor complex into an inverse agonist conformation, and the antagonist <b>flumazenil</b> resets benzodiazepine receptors to their original sensitivity. <b>Flumazenil</b> was found in this study to be a successful treatment for protracted benzodiazepine withdrawal syndrome, but further research is required. A study by Professor Borg in Sweden produced similar results in patients suffering from protracted withdrawal. In 2007, Hoffmann–La Roche the makers of <b>flumazenil,</b> acknowledged the existence of protracted benzodiazepine withdrawal syndromes, but did not recommended <b>flumazenil</b> to treat the condition.|$|E
25|$|Chlordiazepoxide is a {{drug that}} is very {{frequently}} involved in drug intoxication, including overdose. Chlordiazepoxide overdose is considered a medical emergency and, in general, requires the immediate attention of medical personnel. The antidote for an overdose of chlordiazepoxide (or any other benzodiazepine) is <b>flumazenil.</b> <b>Flumazenil</b> should be given with caution as it may precipitate severe withdrawal symptoms in benzodiazepine-dependent individuals.|$|E
25|$|Although {{not usually}} fatal when taken alone, a {{diazepam}} overdose {{is considered a}} medical emergency and generally requires the immediate attention of medical personnel. The antidote for an overdose of diazepam (or any other benzodiazepine) is <b>flumazenil</b> (Anexate). This drug is only used in cases with severe respiratory depression or cardiovascular complications. Because <b>flumazenil</b> is a short-acting drug, {{and the effects of}} diazepam can last for days, several doses of <b>flumazenil</b> may be necessary. Artificial respiration and stabilization of cardiovascular functions may also be necessary. Though not routinely indicated, activated charcoal can be used for decontamination of the stomach following a diazepam overdose. Emesis is contraindicated. Dialysis is minimally effective. Hypotension may be treated with levarterenol or metaraminol.|$|E
25|$|Protracted {{symptoms}} {{continue to}} fade {{over a period}} of many months or several years. There is no known cure for protracted benzodiazepine withdrawal syndrome except time, however, the medication <b>flumazenil</b> was found to be more effective than placebo in reducing feelings of hostility and aggression in patients who had been free of benzodiazepines for 4–266 weeks. This may suggest a role for <b>flumazenil</b> in treating protracted benzodiazepine withdrawal symptoms.|$|E
25|$|<b>Flumazenil</b> (Romazicon) is a {{competitive}} benzodiazepine receptor antagonist {{that can be}} used as an antidote for benzodiazepine overdose. Its use, however, is controversial as it has numerous contraindications. It is contraindicated in patients who are on long-term benzodiazepines, those who have ingested a substance that lowers the seizure threshold, or in patients who have tachycardia, widened QRS complex on ECG, anticholinergic signs, or a history of seizures. Due to these contraindications and the possibility of it causing severe adverse effects including seizures, adverse cardiac effects, and death, in the majority of cases there is no indication for the use of <b>flumazenil</b> in the management of benzodiazepine overdose as the risks in general outweigh any potential benefit of administration. It also has no role in the management of unknown overdoses. In addition, if full airway protection has been achieved, a good outcome is expected, and therefore <b>flumazenil</b> administration is unlikely to be required.|$|E
25|$|<b>Flumazenil</b> {{is being}} studied as a {{potential}} treatment to reduce withdrawal symptoms. As its use may result in seizures this should only be done within hospital in areas experienced with the procedure.|$|E
25|$|Specific antidotes are {{available}} for certain overdoses. For example, Naloxone is the antidote for opiates such as heroin or morphine. Similarly, benzodiazepine overdoses may be effectively reversed with <b>flumazenil.</b> As a nonspecific antidote, activated charcoal is frequently recommended if available within one hour of the ingestion and the ingestion is significant. Gastric lavage, syrup of ipecac, and whole bowel irrigation are rarely used.|$|E
25|$|Benzodiazepine {{overdose}} {{describes the}} ingestion {{of one of}} the drugs in the benzodiazepine class in quantities greater than are recommended or generally practiced. The most common symptoms of overdose include central nervous system (CNS) depression, impaired balance, ataxia, and slurred speech. Severe symptoms include coma and respiratory depression. Supportive care is the mainstay of treatment of benzodiazepine overdose. There is an antidote, <b>flumazenil,</b> but its use is controversial.|$|E
500|$|Competitive antagonists {{are used}} to prevent the {{activity}} of drugs, and to reverse the effects of drugs {{that have already been}} consumed. Naloxone (also known as Narcan) is used to reverse opioid overdose caused by drugs such as heroin or morphine. Similarly, Ro15-4513 is an antidote to alcohol and <b>flumazenil</b> is an antidote to benzodiazepines.|$|E
500|$|In {{susceptible}} individuals, midazolam {{has been}} known to cause a paradoxical reaction, a well-documented complication with benzodiazepines. When this occurs, the individual may experience anxiety, involuntary movements, aggressive or violent behavior, uncontrollable crying or verbalization, and other similar effects. This seems {{to be related to the}} altered state of consciousness or disinhibition produced by the drug. Paradoxical behavior is often not recalled by the patient due to the amnesia-producing properties of the drug. In extreme situations, <b>flumazenil</b> can be administered to inhibit or reverse the effects of midazolam. [...] Antipsychotic medications, such as haloperidol, have also been used for this purpose.|$|E
2500|$|<b>Flumazenil</b> is {{the only}} GABAA {{receptor}} antagonist on the market as of Jan 2013, and it is currently manufactured only as an intravenous formulation. Given its pharmacology, researchers consider {{it to be a}} promising medication in the treatment of primary hypersomnias. [...] Results of a small, double-blind, randomized, controlled clinical trial were published in November 2012. [...] This research showed that <b>flumazenil</b> provides relief for most patients whose CSF contains the unknown [...] "somnogen" [...] that enhances the function of GABAA receptors, making them more susceptible to the sleep-inducing effect of GABA. For one patient, daily administration of <b>flumazenil</b> by sublingual lozenge and topical cream has proven effective for several years. A 2014 case report also showed improvement in primary hypersomnia symptoms after treatment with a continuous subcutaneous <b>flumazenil</b> infusion. The supply of generic <b>flumazenil</b> was initially thought to be too low to meet the potential demand for treatment of primary hypersomnias. However, this scarcity has eased, and dozens of patients are now being treated with <b>flumazenil</b> off-label.|$|E
2500|$|Given the {{possible}} role of hyper-active GABAA receptors {{in the primary}} hypersomnias (narcolepsy and idiopathic hypersomnia), medications that could counteract this activity are being studied to test their potential to improve sleepiness. [...] These currently include clarithromycin and <b>flumazenil.</b>|$|E
2500|$|The {{success rate}} of a minimal {{intervention}} where rapid withdrawal is first tried, followed by a systematic tapered discontinuation if the first try was unsuccessful, ranges from 25 to 100% with a median of 58%. [...] Cognitive behavioral therapy was useful to improve success rates for panic disorder, melatonin for insomnia, as was <b>flumazenil</b> and sodium valproate. A ten-year follow-up {{found that more than}} half of those who had successfully withdrawn from long-term use were still abstinent two years later, and that if they were able to maintain this state at two years, they were likely to maintain this state at the ten-year followup. One study found that after one year of abstinence from long-term use of benzodiazepines, cognitive, neurological and intellectual impairments had returned to normal.|$|E
2500|$|Zopiclone is {{sometimes}} {{used as a}} method of suicide. It has a similar fatality index to that of [...] benzodiazepine drugs, apart from temazepam, which is particularly toxic in overdose. Deaths have occurred from zopiclone overdose, alone or in combination with other drugs. Overdose of zopiclone may present with excessive sedation and depressed respiratory function that may progress to coma and possibly death. Zopiclone combined with alcohol, opiates, or other central nervous system depressants may be even more likely to lead to fatal overdoses. Zopiclone overdosage can be treated with the benzodiazepine receptor antagonist <b>flumazenil,</b> which displaces zopiclone from its binding site on the benzodiazepine receptor, thereby rapidly reversing its effects. Serious effects on the heart may also occur from a zopiclone overdose when combined with piperazine.|$|E
2500|$|The GABAA {{receptor}} is a heteromer {{composed of}} five subunits, {{the most common}} ones being two αs, two βs, and one γ (α2β2γ). For each subunit, many subtypes exist (α1–6, β1–3, and γ1–3). [...] GABAA receptors containing the α1 subunit mediate the sedative, the anterograde amnesic, and partly the anticonvulsive effects of diazepam. GABAA receptors containing α2 mediate the anxiolytic actions and {{to a large degree}} the myorelaxant effects. GABAA receptors containing α3 and α5 also contribute to benzodiazepines myorelaxant actions, whereas GABAA receptors comprising the α5 subunit were shown to modulate the temporal and spatial memory effects of benzodiazepines. receptor subtypes and addiction |url=http://www.addictionscience.unige.ch/LabPublications-1/TrendsNeurosciKT2011.pdf |format=PDF |work=University of Geneva |date=2011 |accessdate=December 12, 2014 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150701230113/http://www.addictionscience.unige.ch/LabPublications-1/TrendsNeurosciKT2011.pdf |archivedate=July 1, 2015 |df= }} Diazepam is not the only drug to target these GABAA receptors. Drugs like <b>Flumazenil</b> also bind to GABAA to induce their effects.|$|E
50|$|Many benzodiazepines (including midazolam) have longer half-lives than <b>flumazenil.</b> Therefore, repeat {{doses of}} <b>flumazenil</b> may be {{required}} to prevent recurrent symptoms of overdosage once the initial dose of <b>flumazenil</b> wears off. It is hepatically metabolised to inactive compounds which are excreted in the urine. Subjects who are physically dependent on benzodiazepines may suffer benzodiazepine withdrawal symptoms, including seizure, upon rapid administration of <b>flumazenil.</b>|$|E

50|$|<b>Flumazenil,</b> an imidazobenzodiazepine derivative, antagonizes {{the actions}} of benzodiazepines on the central nervous system. <b>Flumazenil</b> {{competitively}} inhibits the activity at the benzodiazepine recognition site on the GABA/benzodiazepine receptor complex. Because the body does not produce endogenous benzodiazepines, <b>flumazenil</b> only creates behavioral effects when administered concurrently with a benzodiazepine receptor agonist or inverse agonist. <b>Flumazenil</b> is a weak partial agonist in some animal models of activity, but {{has little or no}} agonist activity in humans.|$|E
