40|$|Abstract niet beschikbaarPart a {{introduces}} the CBS <b>job</b> <b>classification</b> at the Monitoring Risk Factor Project on cardiovascular diseases. an error analysis {{with regard to}} the coding of the jobs is the basis for recommendations for the questions about job characteristics in the new questionnaire. In part B the relation between job and (potential) risk factors for cardiovascular diseases is studied. The U&S job presitige scale and the Social Group (both derived from the CBS <b>job</b> <b>classification</b> 1984) are compared with the C 2 classification, that has been used until now, on explaining power. The results showed that job (controlled for education) is especially related to food habits and the consumption of alcohol. The risk factors athat are significant vary with the different groups. The relations are not always linear. The different <b>job</b> <b>classifications</b> are about equally strong in their explanation of (possible) risk factors. The variables explained are different for each <b>job</b> <b>classification...</b>|$|R

40|$|The {{purpose of}} this {{research}} was to measure the relationship between employee preference types and their respective <b>job</b> <b>classifications</b> in public horticulture. Preference types were determined by the Myers Briggs Type Indicator (MBTI). Past and current research indicates that certain preference types I gravitate to particular jobs due to type strengths, likes and preferences. By learning about preference types, staff in public horticulture can improve employee interpersonal relations, productivity, individual understanding, and decrease conflict and stress. The MBTI was given to staff who volunteered to participate in this research from Longwood Gardens, Morris, Scott, and Tyler Arboreta. The results show that certain preference types seem to be attracted to particular <b>job</b> <b>classifications</b> in public horticulture. There are preference differences between the individual <b>job</b> <b>classifications</b> which could cause miscommunication and conflict; therefore, {{it is important to understand}} the differences to be effective managers and employees...|$|R

40|$|The Analysis of Compensation System in The Antara-Reuters Strategic Business Unit Irmayanti The {{objective}} {{of this study is}} to: identify the job factors which is considered in the job point, analyze the employees' perception related to the job factors which is considered in the job point, analyze the criteria of internal consistency requirement in the compensation system based on job points and analyze the factors which influence the salary of employees. There were four methods used in this study, 1) the job evaluation by Point System Method which results in the job points, 2) employees' perception towards the job evaluation by factor analysis, 3) construct a pay structure based on the compensation theories with and without <b>job</b> <b>classification,</b> 4) analyze the influence of the independent variables (<b>job</b> <b>classification,</b> job/position, working experience, and achievements) through double regression. The result of the process is then analyzed and elaborated by description method. The factor analysis shows that there are 3 factors which is the reduction of the 18 original factors. The status of the employees in the pay structure without <b>job</b> <b>classification</b> indicates that 1 employees were under paid and 2 over paid. The pay structure with <b>job</b> <b>classification</b> resulted in five salary group. The calculation indicates that there are 3 employees in the under paid status and 2 over paid status. The double regression analysis indicates that all the independent variables (except working experiences) has a significant influence towards determination of compensation/salary.

40|$|Noise {{exposures}} {{were measured}} in the electric and natural gas distribution operations workforce of a large Midwestern utility. Both personal dosimetry and area monitoring were utilized to evaluate noise exposures based on <b>job</b> <b>classification</b> as well as operation of specific equipment or performance of certain tasks. <b>Job</b> <b>classifications</b> were chosen for study based on observable noise exposures and employee requests. Five <b>job</b> <b>classifications</b> were sampled with 90 % confidence according to NIOSH guidelines for sample sizes. Three of the five <b>job</b> <b>classifications</b> were previously enrolled in the company hearing conservation program {{and two of them}} were not. The study determined that four of the five work groups met the exposure criteria for inclusion in an employer sponsored hearing conservation program while the fifth group did not. The group that did not demonstrate exposures above the inclusion criterion should not be excluded from the program as it was revealed that other exposures exist that were not able to be measured during the study. These activities need to be evaluated before the group can be removed from the hearing conservation program. All three of the task based analysis studies demonstrated noise exposure or the potential for noise exposure higher than regulatory limits. As a result of the measurements, double hearing protection was recommended for one task and the final task based analysis revealed potential for exposure so high that engineering controls or remote operation methods must be pursued...|$|R

40|$|The {{selection}} and placement of recruits into specific military <b>job</b> <b>classifications,</b> such as sonar operation, {{is an important}} concern of the Armed Forces. Presently, the Navy uses the Armed Services Vocational Aptitude Battery (ASVAB) to select and place submarine and surface operators. Yet, attrition among sonar trainees is high and the ASVAB has been criticized as too general a measure to differentiate or predict performance capabilities and make <b>job</b> <b>classifications.</b> Research indicates that a multidimensional assessment of physiological, cognitive, and attitu-dinal variables may best describe the characteristics found and desired in expert sonar operators. The present study assessed the cognitive and personality characteristics of experienced sonar operators, and determined how these operators compared with sonar trainees and non-sonar personnel on the same dimensions. A secondary concern was to examine for possible differences between submarine and surface sonar operators, because different ASVAB selection criteria are used with these groups...|$|R
30|$|Table 1 {{depicts the}} {{initialization}} parameters for a 1000 -agent model, the NASA Workforce in 2005 [6]. All initialization parameters in Table 1 {{are based on}} OPM historical data-sets and structured {{in accordance with the}} variables established in the Shapiro, Mazzuchi, and Sarkani model [6]. The model organizational workforce is distributed into two <b>job</b> <b>classifications,</b> STEM and Non-STEM. Total starting population distribution is represented by the starting STEM or Non-STEM distribution at NASA in 2005. Each of the two <b>job</b> <b>classifications</b> has defined satisfaction threshold levels in three segments: satisfied, committed, and unsatisfied; these segments are based on the NASA 2005 OPM data set for age-group attrition rates. The starting satisfied segment includes workers in age-group 30 – 54 years old; starting committed segment includes workers in age-group 25 – 29 and 50 – 54 years old; starting unsatisfied segment includes workers in age-group 24 and under, 55 – 59, and 60 and over. New worker probability is based on the NASA 2005 OPM data set distribution of new workers. These new workers enter the model environment based on the probability of STEM or Non-STEM worker replacement at NASA in 2005 using OPM data-sets. STEM and Non-STEM age-group starting satisfaction and minimum satisfaction thresholds are uniformly assigned to all same <b>job</b> <b>classification</b> agents within the satisfied, committed, or unsatisfied segments; this is an abstraction based on assumptions from the NASA 2005 OPM data set and model calibration for approximating historical attrition rates [6].|$|R

40|$|The aim of {{this study}} is to examine {{bullying}} in the workplace from the perspective of Australian Information Communication Technology (ICT) professionals. The data collection for this project included conducting a quantitative survey with 2, 315 participants and 43 qualitative interviews with members of Australian Computer Society (ACS). We found that 630 ICT professionals, or 27. 23 % of all survey respondents, identified workplace bullying as an ethical problem. The majority of survey respondents who selected bullying as an ethical issue were permanent full time employees (N= 413, 65. 6 %). A significant relationship was found between respondents identifying bullying as an ethical issue in the survey and their <b>job</b> <b>classification</b> (Deviance = 25. 55, Df = 11, p= 0. 0076), suggesting that <b>job</b> <b>classification,</b> among other things, does predict respondents’ selection of bullying.
