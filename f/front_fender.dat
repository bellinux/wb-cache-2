5|$|The Original E-Series Clubsport was {{released}} in September 2006. The Clubsport had LED taillights and vertical <b>front</b> <b>fender</b> grilles only found on HSV E-Series models. Cloth trim was standard on Clubsport models with leather being an option.|$|E
5|$|The {{enhanced}} performance VE range sold by Holden Special Vehicles (HSV) is marketed as the E Series and it comprised the variants listed below. For the first time, {{in order to}} more greatly differentiate its products from the mainstream donor cars, HSV invested in revised sheetmetal (chiefly, different <b>front</b> <b>fender</b> panels with dedicated air vent and different tail lights). E Series HSV vehicles {{have been the most}} successful and mass-produced vehicles in HSV's history.|$|E
25|$|The {{aerodynamic}} {{package includes}} an active rear spoiler, tuning of the underbody, the intakes in the grille and the <b>front</b> <b>fender</b> vents and aero stabilizing fins.|$|E

25|$|The {{interior}} was a Cassini hallmark featuring a special black fabric with copper metal {{buttons on the}} individual adjustable and reclining front seats and on the padded door panels, that was set off by extra thick copper carpeting. Additional copper accents were on the steering wheel, door pulls, and on the instrument panel. Embroidered Cassini medallions were featured on the headrests. The glove compartment door, trunk lid, <b>front</b> <b>fender,</b> and hood featured Cassini's signature.|$|E
25|$|Changes {{were again}} modest: Five smaller <b>front</b> <b>fender</b> vents {{replaced}} the three larger ones, and flat-finish rockers sans ribbing conferred a lower, less chunky appearance. New {{was a single}} backup light, mounted above the license plate. The previous models' wheel covers gave way to slotted six-inch Rally wheels with chrome beauty rings and lug nuts concealed behind chrome caps. Interior alterations were modest and included revised upholstery, and the handbrake moved from beneath the dash to between the seats. The convertible's optional hardtop was offered with a black vinyl cover, which was a fad among all cars at the time.|$|E
25|$|In 1980, Honda only offered one model, {{designated}} as the Hawk, now simply designated CB400T. The CM400E took {{over the role of}} the cheaper Hawk I. It is similar to the European CB400NA. It has the same European styling and six-speed manual gearbox, although the pegs, footrest and gear lever are in the same position as the earlier Hawk variants. The bike became electric start only. Smaller 30mm Keihin CV carburettors with accelerator pumps were fitted to comply with US emissions controls. The 1981 model is similar to the European CB400NB and has a dual piston front brake caliper, plastic <b>front</b> <b>fender</b> and a different tank shape.|$|E

5000|$|<b>Front</b> <b>fenders</b> are one piece, {{as opposed}} to the two piece found on 2004 models.|$|R
25|$|Fender skirts {{are often}} made as {{extensions}} of the body panels of the vehicles and cover the entire wheel wells. Much like smooth wheel covers this modification reduces the drag of the vehicle by preventing any air from becoming trapped in the wheel well and assists in streamlining {{the body of the}} vehicle. Fender skirts are more commonly found on the rear wheel wells of a vehicle because the tires do not turn and the design is much simpler. This is commonly seen in vehicles such as the first generation Honda Insight. <b>Front</b> <b>fender</b> skirts have the same effect on reducing drag as the rear wheel skirts, but must be further offset from the body in order to compensate for the tire sticking out from the body of the vehicle as turns are made.|$|E
25|$|The new car {{featured}} a more prominent long hood short deck styling, and was longer lower and {{wider than the}} 1969 models. The roofline was lower, while all models now {{featured a}} much less formal roof line than previous years. The windshield rake was increased, and the SportsRoof models had an even flatter fastback roofline. The overall styling appeared much more aerodynamic than years previous, and featured a pointed front end. The grille covered the full width of the front fascia, and surrounded the quad headlights. The <b>front</b> <b>fender</b> line extended to front door, sloping downward and gradually disappearing in the quarter panel. Both front and rear bumpers were slim tight fitting chromed units, that carefully followed the body lines. The taillights were situated in the rear panel above the bumper, and were now long rectangular units with rounded outer edges.|$|E
25|$|The Lexus RC F {{is a high}} {{performance}} version of the RC with the 5.0-liter 2UR-GSE V8 engine with Atkinson cycle at cruising speeds, eight-speed automatic transmission sending the power to the rear wheels. The RC F is equipped with vertical G-sensor for VDIM, Torque Vectoring Differential (TVD) with three operating modes, Standard, Slalom, or Track, front and rear coil-spring independent suspension, monotube gas-filled shock absorbers and ball-jointed stabilizer bars, three new 19-inch diameter forged aluminum wheels, spindle grille with F-mesh pattern on the lower half, unique front hood which raises {{the peak of the}} vehicle, hood air vent from the LFA, front cooling ducts, <b>front</b> <b>fender</b> ducts in the L shape, exclusive combination meters from LFA (a large centrally mounted tachometer that alters according to drive mode, digital and analog speedometer, differential torque vectoring monitor, G-force meter, oil and water temperature gauges, mileage information and a stopwatch), elliptical cross-section thick grip steering wheel, all-new high back seats, ornamentation and pedals, Brembo four-wheel power assisted disc brakes with anti-lock braking system (ABS), electronic brake force distribution (EBD) and brake assist (BA), 19x9-inch front and 19x10-inch rear wheels, 255/35R19 front and 275/35R19 rear tires.|$|E

Many smaller upgrades including improved turn signals. The A2 {{can be identified}} by the large combination turn signal/blackout lights on the <b>front</b> <b>fenders,</b> which also had been modified to mount the larger lights, as opposed to earlier A1's that had flat <b>front</b> <b>fenders.</b>|$|R

25|$|The VAM Javelin saw {{considerable}} aesthetic {{changes with}} only minor technical ones. The VAM models included the same novelties as its AMC counterpart, {{such as new}} headlight bezels and grille, smooth <b>front</b> <b>fender</b> extensions and bumpers without divisions, larger tail lights without wraparound portions and a single central back-up light, larger side marker lights with both light and reflector sections in both amber and red, and new wheel cover designs resembling Magnum 500 wheels. The discontinuation of the central rear reflector {{in favor of the}} back-up light resulted in the addition of a fourth Javelin emblem placed on the right corner of the trunk lid. Two hood designs were available, the one with the Ram Air-type scoops at the front center, and a smoother one with the two rectangular stripped bulges. Despite this, no Ram Air system was ever offered for the car, at least at a factory level. In the interior, a new collapsible steering column with built-in ignition switch and anti-theft lock plus a new simulated two-arm three-spoke sports steering wheel with a central bulls eye emblem were present. A secondary anti-theft mechanism was present {{in the form of the}} floor-mounted shifters being linked to the ignition switch regardless of the transmission type. AMC's new dashboard design included full woodgrain surfaces, complete with a new center console and shifter design for the automatic transmission. However, all three gauges were still the same as in the previous two years. New door panels were also included.|$|E
500|$|The Honda Juno {{had been}} the first scooter to use {{polyester}} resin, or fiberglass reinforced plastic (FRP), bodywork, and even though production of the Juno had stopped in 1954 as a result of Honda Motor's financial and labor problems at the time, Fujisawa continued to encourage research in polyester resin casting techniques, and these efforts bore fruit for the Super Cub. The new motorcycle's fairing would be polyethylene, the most widely used plastic, which reduced weight over FRP, but Honda's supplier had never made such a large die cast before, so the die had to be provided by Honda. The Super Cub was the first motorcycle ever to use a plastic fairing. Motorcycling historian Clement Salvadori wrote that the plastic <b>front</b> <b>fender</b> and leg shields were, [...] "perhaps the Cub's greatest contribution; plastic did the job just as well as metal at considerably lower cost." [...] The technology developed in the Isle of Man TT racing program was equally vital to the new lightweight motorcycle, making possible [...] from a 50cc four-stroke Honda engine, where the first engine the company built a decade earlier, a [...] "fairly exact copy" [...] of the 50cc two stroke war-surplus Tohatsu engine Honda had been selling as motorized bicycle auxiliary engine, had only a [...] output. Honda's first four stroke, the 1951 E-type, had just a little more power than the Super Cub, , [...] with nearly triple the displacement, [...]|$|E

2500|$|Early 1960 models, {{particularly}} the V200 high-trim cars, featured extensive brightwork and ornamentation. An [...] chrome spear atop each <b>front</b> <b>fender,</b> an inner reveal {{ring on the}} deck lid's spare tire stamping, a [...] "V200" [...] nameplate on the dashboard, and stainless steel windshield and backlight reveal moldings, which were deleted from production, replaced with less costly flexible mylar-faced plastic locking strips—in approximately January, 1960. Early and late V200s had a continuous stainless steel molding following the tailfin crease as it swept {{down in front of}} the rear wheel, then continuing forward along the lower break line in both doors and the <b>front</b> <b>fender.</b> The radiator grille was brite-dipped stamped aluminum, and a central grille badge doubled as the hood release. Script [...] "Valiant" [...] callouts were placed in the center of the deck lid's spare-tire stamping and on each <b>front</b> <b>fender.</b>|$|E

2500|$|The Electra, {{along with}} the Invicta and LeSabre, was {{redesigned}} for 1961 with drastically shrunken fins, and was joined with the all-new compact sized Skylark/Special. Electras featured bright rocker panel and wheelhouse moldings. [...] Four VentiPorts per <b>front</b> <b>fender</b> were a hallmark, with identification spelled out on the <b>front</b> <b>fender</b> plaques. [...] Electra 225s had four [...] "hash marks" [...] interrupting behind the wheelhouse of the rear fender. Electra 225 nameplates {{were found on the}} front fenders. Electra interiors were trimmed in fabric. Electra 225s were trimmed in Calais cloth or leather trim, except for convertibles which were trimmed in vinyl. An optional Custom interior featured leather trim, while another featured vinyl with contrasting vertical stripes and front bucket seats with a storage consolex and power two-way seat adjustment.|$|E
