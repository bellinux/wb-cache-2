5|$|Although Morchella populiphila is an edible species, <b>it</b> <b>is</b> <b>not</b> <b>as</b> {{highly valued}} as other morels {{because of its}} fragile nature and its {{inferior}} flavor.|$|E
5|$|While most foods need batter {{coatings}} for protection, <b>it</b> <b>is</b> <b>not</b> <b>as</b> {{necessary for}} cooked noodles and potatoes because their high starch content {{enables them to}} hold more moisture and resist shrinking. Meats may be cooked before deep frying {{to ensure that they}} are done inside while keeping juiciness.|$|E
5|$|A {{few months}} ago I told the American people I did not trade arms for hostages. My heart and my best {{intentions}} still tell me that's true, but {{the facts and the}} evidence tell me <b>it</b> <b>is</b> <b>not.</b> <b>As</b> the Tower board reported, what began as a strategic opening to Iran deteriorated, in its implementation, into trading arms for hostages. This runs counter to my own beliefs, to administration policy, and to the original strategy we had in mind.|$|E

5|$|As {{would be}} {{expected}} for a road crossing the Pennines, Snake Pass has several dangerous bends and blind summits. Like many roads in the North of England passing through similar terrain, Snake Pass has a poor safety record in comparison to other roads in the United Kingdom but <b>it</b> <b>is</b> <b>not</b> <b>as</b> dangerous as other roads bisecting hilly terrain {{in this part of}} England. It was not among the top 10 in a list of the most dangerous roads published in July 2010, despite nine of the top ten being in Northern England.|$|E
5|$|Besides {{the simple}} oxide CaO, the {{peroxide}} CaO2 {{can be made}} by direct oxidation of calcium metal under a high pressure of oxygen, and there is some evidence for a yellow superoxide Ca(O2)2. Calcium hydroxide, Ca(OH)2, is a strong base, though <b>it</b> <b>is</b> <b>not</b> <b>as</b> strong as the hydroxides of strontium, barium or the alkali metals. All four dihalides of calcium are known. Calcium carbonate (CaCO3) and calcium sulfate (CaSO4) are particularly abundant minerals. Like strontium and barium, as well as the alkali metals and the divalent lanthanides europium and ytterbium, calcium metal dissolves directly in liquid ammonia to give a dark blue solution.|$|E
5|$|However, poison {{still exists}} as a murderous entity today, but <b>it</b> <b>is</b> <b>not</b> <b>as</b> popular form of {{conducting}} murder {{as it used}} to be in past times, probably because of the wider range of ways to kill people and other factors that must be taken into consideration. One of the more recent deaths by poisoning was that of Russian dissident Alexander Litvinenko in 2006 from lethal polonium-210 radiation poisoning.|$|E
50|$|Mahieu's other piece, Pour autrui movrai, {{likewise}} {{refers to}} his Jewishness, but <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>not</b> <b>as</b> widely read.|$|R

5|$|The volcano's {{observed}} {{history has}} mostly {{been one of}} effusive eruptions; however, this is a relatively recent occurrence. Prior {{to the arrival of}} the first Europeans on the island, Kīlauea was the site of regular explosive activity, evidenced then by tribal chants referencing the volcano's fickle nature, and today by geological records of an explosively active mode of past activity. Although explosive activity still occurs at the volcano, <b>it</b> <b>is</b> <b>not</b> <b>as</b> intense as it once was, and the volcano would become much more dangerous to the general public if it returned to its old phase of activity once more.|$|E
5|$|Victorious Boxers: Ippo's Road to Glory, {{known in}} Japan as , is a boxing video game created by Japanese {{developer}} New Corporation for the Sony PlayStation 2 video game console. It {{is based on}} the manga and anime series Hajime no Ippo. Though the original series is very popular in Japan, <b>it</b> <b>is</b> <b>not</b> <b>as</b> widely known in the United States (US). The game was released in Japan on December 14, 2000 and in North America on November 5, 2001.|$|E
5|$|Ruthenium is {{the first}} in a {{downward}} trend in the melting and boiling points and atomization enthalpy in the 4d transition metals after the maximum seen at molybdenum, because the 4d subshell is more than half full and the electrons are contributing less to metallic bonding. (Technetium, the previous element, has an exceptionally low value that is off the trend due to its half-filled 4d55s2 configuration, though the small amount of energy needed to excite it to a 4d65s1 configuration indicates that <b>it</b> <b>is</b> <b>not</b> <b>as</b> far off the trend in the 4d series as manganese in the 3d transition series.) Unlike the lighter congener iron, ruthenium is paramagnetic at room temperature, as iron also is above its Curie point.|$|E

5|$|Skulls of P. mongoliensis {{are flat}} on top, {{especially}} {{over the back}} of the skull, with a triangular depression, the antorbital fossa, on the outside surface of the maxilla (an upper jaw bone). A flange is present on the lower edge of the dentary (the tooth-bearing bone of the lower jaw), although <b>it</b> <b>is</b> <b>not</b> <b>as</b> prominent as in P. meileyingensis or P. major (=P. lujiatunensis). P. mongoliensis is among the largest known species. The skull of the type specimen, which is probably a juvenile, is 15.2centimetres (6in) long, and the associated femur is 16.2centimetres (6.4in) in length. Other specimens are larger, with the largest documented femur measuring about 21centimetres (8.25in) long.|$|E
5|$|The beak is very distinctive. From {{the side}} the beak is broad and {{triangular}} but viewed from above it is narrow. The half nearest the tip is orange-red and the half nearest {{to the head}} is slate grey. There is a yellow chevron-shaped ridge separating the two parts and a yellow, fleshy strip {{at the base of}} the bill. At the joint of the two mandibles there is a yellow, wrinkled rosette. The exact proportions of the beak vary with the age of the bird. In an immature individual, the beak has reached its full length but <b>it</b> <b>is</b> <b>not</b> <b>as</b> broad as that of an adult. With time the bill deepens, the upper edge curves and a kink develops at its base. As the bird ages, one or more grooves may form on the red portion. The bird has a powerful bite.|$|E
5|$|The {{most famous}} {{of the very few}} chairs which have come down from a remote antiquity is the reputed Chair of Saint Peter in St Peter's Basilica at Rome. The wooden {{portions}} are much decayed, but it would appear to be Byzantine work of the 6th century, and to be really an ancient sedia gestatoria. It has ivory carvings representing the labours of Hercules. A few pieces of an earlier oaken chair have been let in; the existing one, Gregorovius says, is of acacia wood. The legend that this was the curile chair of the senator Pudens is necessarily apocryphal. <b>It</b> <b>is</b> <b>not,</b> <b>as</b> is popularly supposed, enclosed in Gian Lorenzo Bernini's bronze chair, but is kept under triple lock and exhibited only once in a century. Byzantium, like Greece and Rome, affected the curule form of chair, and in addition to lions’ heads and winged figures of Victory (or Nike) and dolphin-shaped arms used also the lyre-back which has been made familiar by the pseudo-classical revival {{of the end of the}} 18th century.|$|E
50|$|The {{film was}} {{released}} in France but only received a limited release in Australia. <b>It</b> <b>was</b> <b>not</b> <b>as</b> successful as Walk into Paradise.|$|R

50|$|Most {{researchers}} {{have concluded that}} there is marginal evidence for a standardized measuring unit, but that <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>not</b> <b>as</b> uniform as Thom believed.|$|R
5|$|The {{standard}} {{electrode potential}} for the Sr2+/Sr couple is −2.89V, approximately midway between those of the Ca2+/Ca (−2.84V) and Ba2+/Ba (−2.92V) couples, and close {{to those of the}} neighboring alkali metals. Strontium is intermediate between calcium and barium in its reactivity toward water, with which it reacts on contact to produce strontium hydroxide and hydrogen gas. Strontium metal burns in air to produce both strontium oxide and strontium nitride, but since it does not react with nitrogen below 380°C, at room temperature, it forms only the oxide spontaneously. Besides the simple oxide SrO, the peroxide SrO2 can be made by direct oxidation of strontium metal under a high pressure of oxygen, and there is some evidence for a yellow superoxide Sr(O2)2. Strontium hydroxide, Sr(OH)2, is a strong base, though <b>it</b> <b>is</b> <b>not</b> <b>as</b> strong as the hydroxides of barium or the alkali metals. All four dihalides of strontium are known.|$|E
5|$|These {{scattering}} methods generally use monochromatic X-rays, {{which are}} restricted to a single wavelength with minor deviations. A broad spectrum of X-rays (that is, a blend of X-rays with different wavelengths) {{can also be used}} to carry out X-ray diffraction, a technique known as the Laue method. This is the method used in the original discovery of X-ray diffraction. Laue scattering provides much structural information with only a short exposure to the X-ray beam, and is therefore used in structural studies of very rapid events (Time resolved crystallography). However, <b>it</b> <b>is</b> <b>not</b> <b>as</b> well-suited as monochromatic scattering for determining the full atomic structure of a crystal and therefore works better with crystals with relatively simple atomic arrangements.|$|E
5|$|With an {{apparent}} magnitude of −1.46, Sirius is {{the brightest star}} system in the night sky, almost twice {{the brightness of the}} second brightest star, Canopus. <b>It</b> <b>is</b> <b>not</b> <b>as</b> bright as the Moon, Venus, or Jupiter; at times, Mercury and Mars are also brighter than Sirius. Sirius can be seen from almost everywhere on Earth, with only observers north of 73 degrees latitude unable to see it, and it does not rise very high when viewed from some northern cities, reaching only 13° above the horizon from Saint Petersburg. Sirius, along with Procyon and Betelgeuse, forms one of the three vertices of the Winter Triangle to observers in the Northern Hemisphere. Due to its declination of roughly −17°, Sirius is a circumpolar star from latitudes south of 73° S. From the Southern Hemisphere in early July, Sirius can be seen in both the evening where it sets after the Sun, and in the morning where it rises before the Sun. Due to precession (and slight proper motion), Sirius will move further south in the future. Starting around the year 9000, Sirius will no longer be visible from northern and central Europe, and in 14000 its declination will be −67° and thus it will be circumpolar throughout South Africa and in most parts of Australia.|$|E
50|$|Peck {{also created}} the Cartoon Network series Squirrel Boy, which ran from 2006 to 2007, {{although}} <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>not</b> <b>as</b> critically acclaimed as Duckman.|$|R
50|$|Allmusic's {{review was}} positive, earning 3 out of 5 stars, but stated <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>not</b> <b>as</b> good as Miley Cyrus' concert film Best of Both Worlds Concert.|$|R

5|$|Industry {{is heavy}} along the bay, with an {{abundance}} of natural gas and oil wells at all corners. Natural gas was discovered at the site in 1934, and oil was discovered the next year. Point Comfort is home to several industrial plants along the shore, including Alcoa, Union Carbide, Du Pont, and Formosa Plastics Corp, which contribute to the local economies. Despite the restrictions on the bay that prevent the production of fish and shellfish along the superfund site, seafood harvesting is a major industry. However, <b>it</b> <b>is</b> <b>not</b> <b>as</b> prominent {{as it was in the}} 1920s, when Port Lavaca led the nation in shrimp production, leading to the construction of a quick-freezing plant. Today, shrimping is only allowed south of the Port Lavaca Causeway, due to the north's classification as a nursery location. Shellfish production is allowed in Keller Bay and Lavaca Bay south of Point Comfort, but is restricted along the eastern and northern coast and Chocolate Bay, and is conditionally approved in the remaining locations, including along the shore of Port Lavaca. A small tourism industry also fuels economic growth, spurred by the Port Lavaca State Fishing Pier found alongside the Port Lavaca Causeway. The pier once served as the causeway across the bay but was replaced in the 1960s and converted into a fishing pier of , billed as the longest in the world.|$|E
25|$|The Faroese Horse and the Nordlandshest/Lyngshest of Norway {{share common}} ancestry with the Icelandic horse and some {{individuals}} of these breeds {{have the capacity}} to tölt, although <b>it</b> <b>is</b> <b>not</b> <b>as</b> commonly used.|$|E
25|$|Semi-savoy is {{a hybrid}} variety with {{slightly}} crinkled leaves. It {{has the same}} texture as 'Savoy', but <b>it</b> <b>is</b> <b>not</b> <b>as</b> difficult to clean. It is grown for both fresh market and processing. 'Tyee Hybrid' is a common semi-savoy.|$|E
