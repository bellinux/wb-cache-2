During this ceremony, {{he was awarded the}} Army Distinguished Service Medal by Deputy Secretary of Defense William J. Lynn. During the ceremony, Lynn in his remarks noted that, <b>General</b> <b>Petraeus</b> has played an important role as both a combat leader and strategist in the post-9/11 world. Lynn also cited General Petraeus's efforts in current counter insurgency strategy. Admiral Michael Mullen, Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff in his remarks compared <b>General</b> <b>Petraeus</b> to Ulysses S. Grant, John J. Pershing, George Marshall and Dwight D.

25|$|In 2007, he {{returned}} to Iraq when the surge in U.S. forces was beginning. Wright interviewed <b>General</b> <b>Petraeus</b> and spent several weeks embedded with U.S. troops in Baghdad, Ramadi and Diwania. He later criticized American television media for promoting misperceptions of the war. He also criticized some U.S. political leaders, including Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid, for calling the surge a failure before it had been fully implemented.|$|E
25|$|From the 82nd, {{he moved}} on to serve as Chief of Staff of XVIII Airborne Corps at Fort Bragg during 2000–2001. In 2000, Petraeus {{suffered}} his second major injury, when, during a civilian skydiving jump, his parachute collapsed at low altitude due to a hook turn, resulting in a hard landing that broke his pelvis. He was selected for promotion to Major General in 2001. During 2001–2002, as a brigadier <b>general,</b> <b>Petraeus</b> served a ten-month tour in Bosnia and Herzegovina as part of Operation Joint Forge. In Bosnia, he was the NATO Stabilization Force Assistant Chief of Staff for Operations as well as the Deputy Commander of the U.S. Joint Interagency Counter-Terrorism Task Force, a command created after the September 11 attacks to add counterterrorism capability to the U.S. forces attached to the NATO command in Bosnia. In 2004, he was promoted to Lieutenant General. In 2007, he was promoted to General. On April 23, 2008, Secretary of Defense Gates announced that President Bush was nominating <b>General</b> <b>Petraeus</b> to command U.S. Central Command (USCENTCOM), headquartered in Tampa, Florida. In 2010 Petraeus was nominated to command the International Security Assistance Force in Afghanistan, which required Senate confirmation. He was confirmed on June 30, 2010, and took over command from temporary commander Lieutenant-General Sir Nick Parker on July 4, 2010.|$|E

25|$|American {{occupation}} {{troops in}} Nuristan would find themselves directly {{in opposition to}} the HIG forces prepared by the CIA to resist the Soviets. Colonel Pat Donahue, the former commander of the 3rd BCT, had believed that Nuristani population was essentially neutral, hostile to any outside groups, and so isolated that resources allocated to the region would be wasted. These resources were limited by the fact that only 5,000 American troops were available to occupy a rugged area the size of Virginia that had very {{little in the way of}} Infrastructure. A new Counter-insurgency strategy seemed to offer a way around these problems. Known as COIN and refined by <b>General</b> <b>Petraeus,</b> Commander of US forces in Afghanistan, the Army and Marine Counter-insurgency Field Manual FM 3-24 would convert the population of Nuristan to American goals in the region. Unlike Donahue, Nicholson was a supporter of COIN in addition to seeing Kamdesh as a decisive control point in the region. The basic approach to victory by the PRT would involve three steps: 1. Separate the enemy from the people. 2. Link the people to their government. 3. Transform Afghanistan by economic development and the creation of a national infrastructure. Nicholson hoped the PRT would seed a process that would be developed by the local Nuristanis rather than completely imposed from the outside. Lieutenant Keating, first commander of the Kamdesh PRT, was determined to make COIN a success in the region.|$|E
500|$|A {{week after}} Bush's visit, on 10 September, General David Petraeus, the Commanding General of Multi-National Force– Iraq, and United States Ambassador to Iraq Ryan Crocker gave their Report to Congress on the Situation in Iraq. <b>General</b> <b>Petraeus</b> {{specifically}} singled out Anbar Province {{as a major}} improvement, referring to the tribal uprisings there as [...] "the most significant development of the past 8 months". He mentioned the dramatic improvements in security, stating that enemy attacks had decreased {{from a high of}} 1,350 in October 2006 to approximately 200 in August 2007.|$|E
500|$|As the 1st Brigade {{pushed into}} Ramadi, it began aggressively courting the local tribes for police recruits. This was {{critical}} because, according to Colonel MacFarland, [...] "without their help, {{we would not}} be able to recruit enough police to take back the entire city." [...] After the Americans promised the tribal leaders in Ramadi that their men would not be sent outside of the city, the tribes began sending men into the police force. The number of Iraqis joining the police went from 30 a month before June 2006 to 300 a month by July. AQI tried to blunt police recruitment by attacking one of the new Ramadi police stations with a car bomb on 21 August, killing three Iraqi police. They simultaneously assassinated the Sunni sheikh of the Abu Ali Jassim tribe, who had encouraged many of his tribesmen to join the Iraqi Police. The AQI fighters hid the body instead of leaving it for the tribe, violating Islam's funeral rites and angering the tribe. This was one of the catalysts for what became a tribal revolt against AQI. According to David Kilcullen, who would later serve as Senior Counterinsurgency Adviser to <b>General</b> <b>Petraeus,</b> the revolt began after AQI killed a sheikh over his refusal to give his daughters to them in marriage.|$|E

2500|$|After British {{troops had}} been {{withdrawn}} from Basra city, violence continued and General Mohan {{took some time}} to produce a plan for improving security. [...] Notwithstanding the difficulties, the Basra Governorate was handed over to Provincial Iraqi Control in December 2007. [...] By early March 2008, General Mohan had produced a security plan with British support which was presented to <b>General</b> <b>Petraeus</b> and Prime Minister Maliki in Baghdad. [...] The plan called for a six-week period of disarmament, demobilisation and reintegration starting in June 2008 before forcibly disarming the Mahdi Army and other non-Government/Coalition forces afterwards. [...] Later in March Stirrup was in Baghdad and he met with <b>General</b> <b>Petraeus</b> and General Austin, {{the commander of the}} Multi-National Corps – Iraq. [...] Stirrup strongly backed Mohan's plan but noted that Mohan would need to be pressed hard to deliver and also supported with Corps forces. [...] Austin was reluctant to provide support, wishing to focus on Mosul, but Petraeus agreed with Stirrup. [...] However, this plan was overtaken by Maliki's decision to launch Operation Charge of the Knights. [...] Both Stirrup and the American commanders were taken by surprise and were concerned about the lack of planning but Maliki was determined to launch his operation in late March.|$|E
2500|$|<b>General</b> <b>Petraeus</b> {{noted in}} May, 2008 that {{electricity}} levels have exceeded pre-war production; however, this statistic is misleading. The estimated {{hours per day}} of electricity availability has shifted. [...] During the Saddam rule, Baghdad received electricity for between 16 and 24 hours per day with 4 to 8 hours received outside of the capital. Information from the Brookings Institution (early 2007) indicates that Baghdad now receives electricity from 4 to 8 hours per day with {{the remainder of the}} nation receiving from 8 to 12 hours of electricity per day. Current electricity levels of about 4000 MW have not yet reached the stated goal of nationwide production of 6000 MW.|$|E

[...] Anti-war Republican Senator Chuck Hagel of Nebraska criticized the report while praising Petraeus, saying [...] "It's not your fault, general.... It's not Ambassador Crocker's fault. It's this administration's fault." [...] A USA Today/Gallup poll taken after Petraeus's report to Congress showed virtually no change in public opinion toward the war. A Pew Research Center survey found that most Americans who have heard about the report approve of Petraeus's recommendations.|$|E

McCain was a leading advocate for the move, leading some Democrats to call the policy the [...] "McCain Doctrine". Days after the announcement, McCain appeared on CBS' Face the Nation and said, [...] "This is a chance under the new leadership of <b>General</b> <b>Petraeus</b> and Admiral Fallon to have a chance to succeed. Do I believe it can succeed? Yes, I do." [...] On February 4, he criticised a bipartisan non-binding resolution opposing the troop buildup, calling it a [...] "vote of no confidence" [...] in the US military.

2500|$|During 1993–94, Petraeus {{continued}} his long {{association with the}} 101st Airborne Division (Air Assault) as the division's Assistant Chief of Staff, G-3 (plans, operations and training) and installation Director of Plans, Training, and Mobilization (DPTM). In 1995, {{he was assigned to}} the United Nations Mission in Haiti Military Staff as its Chief Operations Officer during Operation Uphold Democracy. His next command, from 1995 to 1997, was the 1st Brigade, 82nd Airborne Division, centered on the 504th Parachute Infantry Regiment. At that post, his brigade's training cycle at Fort Polk's Joint Readiness Training Center for low-intensity warfare was chronicled by novelist and military enthusiast Tom Clancy in his book Airborne. From 1997 to 1999 Petraeus served in the Pentagon as Executive Assistant to the Director of the Joint Staff and then to the Chairman of the Joint Chiefs, Gen. Henry Shelton, who described Petraeus as [...] "a high-energy individual who likes to lead from the front, in any field he is going into". In 1999, as a brigadier <b>general,</b> <b>Petraeus</b> returned to the 82nd, serving as the assistant division commander for operations and then, briefly, as acting commanding general. During his time with the 82nd, he deployed to Kuwait as part of Operation Desert Spring, the continuous rotation of combat forces through Kuwait during the decade after the Gulf War.|$|E
2500|$|On February 20, 2010, Petraeus {{received}} Princeton University's Madison Medal, {{named after}} the fourth president of the United States, who many consider to be Princeton's first graduate student.

May 27, 2010, The Intrepid Sea, Air & Space Museum awarded its Freedom Award to Petraeus.

[...] "This annual event throws a spotlight on individuals who have gone above and beyond the call of duty for our nation." [...] On September 20, the American Political Science Association (APSA) presented Petraeus with its 2010 Hubert H. Humphrey Award in recognition of notable public service by a political scientist.
