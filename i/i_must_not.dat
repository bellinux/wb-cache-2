In brief, he constructed a decent and ample house of stone…for different needs and conveniences. He divided the main building into two, appointing one part for men oppressed by various kinds of infirmities and the other for women in a bad state of health. He also made arrangements for their clothing and daily food, appointing ministers and guardians to take all measures so that nothing should be lacking for them.|$|E
500|$|On Ebert and Roeper, Richard Roeper {{gave it a}} Thumbs Down, while Roger Ebert {{awarded a}} Thumbs Up. In a {{subsequent}} review, Ebert called it [...] "the best blockbuster of the Summer". In his written review, Ebert gave the film three stars and wrote that while the film was not as awe-inspiring as the first film or as elaborate as the second, [...] "it's a nice little thrill machine. [...] I can't praise it for its art, but <b>I</b> <b>must</b> <b>not</b> neglect its craft..." ...|$|E

Just prior to taking command of the district, Van Dorn wrote to his wife Caroline, saying [...] "I am now in for it, to make a reputation and serve my country conspicuously or fail. <b>I</b> <b>must</b> <b>not,</b> shall not, do the latter.

2500|$|Bond's {{follow up}} to Point and Shoot, Interiors Series was {{published}} in Belgium, in 2005, by Fotomuseum Antwerp. The photographs included in the book appear to explicitly and deliberately invade {{the privacy of the}} subjects, who are captured—unaware of the presence of a photographer—at leisure, in their private dwellings. Writing in an essay accompanying the photographs, Bond said, [...] "for me voyeuristic 'fixation' and the 'photographic act' have become inseparable. It is the sense of 'the illicit' that these photographs are leveraging. <b>I</b> <b>must</b> <b>not</b> be caught taking them, and in a way, the viewer of the photograph is included in my anti-social activity, they too are looking when they should not be." ...|$|E
2500|$|The {{creation}} of Eve, according to Rabbi Joshua, is that: [...] "God deliberated from what member He would create woman, and He reasoned with Himself thus: <b>I</b> <b>must</b> <b>not</b> create her from Adam's head, for {{she would be}} a proud person, and hold her head high. If I create her from the eye, then she will wish to pry into all things; if from the ear, she will wish to hear all things; if from the mouth, she will talk much; if from the heart, she will envy people; if from the hand, she will desire to take all things; if from the feet, she will be a gadabout. Therefore I will create her from the member which is hid, that is the rib, which is not even seen when man is naked." ...|$|E

2500|$|It was {{reported}} that Japanese troops were astonished by other Alliance troops raping civilians. Roger Keyes, who commanded the British destroyer Fame and accompanied the Gaselee Expedition, noted that the Japanese had brought their own [...] "regimental wives" [...] (prostitutes) to the front to keep their soldiers from raping Chinese civilians. Thousands of Chinese women committed suicide; The Daily Telegraph journalist E. J. Dillon stated it was to avoid rape by Alliance forces, and he witnessed the mutilated corpses of Chinese women who were raped and killed by the Alliance troops. The French commander dismissed the rapes, attributing them to [...] "gallantry of the French soldier." [...] A foreign journalist, George Lynch, said [...] "there are things that <b>I</b> <b>must</b> <b>not</b> write, and {{that may not be}} printed in England, which would seem to show that this Western civilization of ours is merely a veneer over savagery." ...|$|E
2500|$|During the Boxer Rebellion, the Chinese Boxers did {{not commit}} rape against foreign women and just killed them, but the Western forces of the Eight-Nation Alliance went on a killing, looting, and raping rampage against Chinese civilians. Thousands of women were raped by the invading troops, {{and the number of}} women who killed {{themselves}} was in the thousands. A western Journalist, George Lynch, said [...] "there are things that <b>I</b> <b>must</b> <b>not</b> write, and that may not be printed in Great Britain, which would seem to show that this Western civilization of ours is merely a veneer over savagery." [...] All of the nationalities engaged in looting and rape. Luella Miner wrote that the behavior of the Russian and French was particularly appalling. Chinese women and girls committed suicide in order to avoid being raped. The French commander dismissed the rapes, attributing them to the [...] "gallantry of the French soldiers".|$|E
2500|$|The Blood Quill is a torture quill used by Umbridge {{throughout}} the Order of the Phoenix to punish students {{that she has}} given detention. It is described as having an unusually sharp black nib. As the user writes, the quill magically and very painfully cuts {{into the back of}} the user's hand and uses his or her blood for ink. In the fifth book, Harry has detention with Umbridge on several occasions; he is required to write lines (<b>I</b> <b>must</b> <b>not</b> tell lies) and is not released from this until Umbridge believes [...] "the message has sunk in." [...] When carried out repeatedly over an extended period, this leads to permanent scarring, as Harry shows Scrimgeour in the last two books. The scars tingle whenever Harry hears Umbridge's name, but it is not clear whether this is psychological or akin to Harry's forehead scar hurting whenever Voldemort is active. Another victim of this form of detention is Lee Jordan; in the film adaptation of the book, members of Dumbledore's Army are forced to use these quills as well. Blood quills are considered illegal to own.|$|E

2500|$|<b>I</b> <b>must</b> <b>not</b> however conceal from Your Excellency, {{that the}} Gentry, well disposed, and heartily desirous as they are, {{to serve the}} Crown, and to serve it with Zeal, when formed into regular Corps, do not relish {{commanding}} a bare Militia, they never were used to that Service under the French Government, (and perhaps for good Reasons) besides the sudden Dismission of the Canadian Regiment raised in 1764, without Gratuity or Recompence to Officers, who engaged in our Service almost immediately after the Cession of the Country, of taking any Notice of them since, tho' they all expected half pay, is still uppermost in their Thoughts, and not likely to encourage their engaging a second Time in the same Way; as to the Habitants or Peasantry, ever since the Civil Authority has been introduced into the Province, the Government of it has hung so loose, and retained so little Power, they have in a Manner emancipated themselves, and it will require Time, and discreet Management likewise, to recall them to their ancient Habits of Obedience and Discipline; considering all the new Ideas they have been acquiring for these ten years past, can it be thought they will be pleased at being suddenly, and without Preparation embodied into a Militia, and marched from their Families, Lands, and Habitations to remote Provinces, and all the Horrors of War, which they have already experienced; It would give appearance of Truth to the Language of our Sons of Sedition, at this very Moment busily employed instilling into their Minds, that the Act was passed merely to serve the present Purposes of Government, and in the full Intention of ruling over them with all the Despotism of their ancient Masters.|$|E
