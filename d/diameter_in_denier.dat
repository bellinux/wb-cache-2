40|$|We {{studied the}} effect of {{treadmill}} exercise on muscle fibers in mice with experimental steroid myopathy. Frozen sections of the extensor digitorum longus (EDL) and soleus (SOL) muscles were stained with hematoxylin-eosin, and the muscle fiber <b>diameters</b> measured. <b>In</b> the EDL, muscle fiber <b>diameters</b> <b>in</b> the steroid groups decreased significantly compared {{with those in the}} control groups; moreover, muscle fiber <b>diameters</b> <b>in</b> the exercise groups increased significantly compared with those in the non-exercise groups, whereas the <b>diameters</b> <b>in</b> the SOL did not differ. We speculate that treadmill exercise may prevent corticosteroid-induced muscle fiber atrophy. 本文データは日本理学療法士協会の許諾に基づきJ-stageから複製したものであ...|$|R

40|$|The {{purpose of}} the {{research}} is to analyze the body <b>diameters</b> <b>in</b> 3 - 6 year old children. The biacromial diameters were taken {{as well as the}} two chest diameters, the bicristal and bitrohanterial <b>diameters</b> <b>in</b> 316 children (157 boys and 159 girls) 3, 4, 5 and 6 years of age attending kindergarten in Plovdiv. The analysis shows that all diameters, {{with the exception of the}} bitrohanterial have higher values in boys. The absolute year's increment of the <b>diameters</b> is greater <b>in</b> girls. The growth velocity of the researched features is greatest at the age of 3 - 4 and 4 - 5, decreasing at different rates for the different features at the age of 5 - 6. The only exception is the sagittal chest <b>diameter</b> <b>in</b> both sexes and the bitrohanterial <b>diameters</b> <b>in</b> girls...|$|R

2500|$|The glass {{envelope}} or [...] "bulb" [...] of all {{incandescent lamps}} {{is measured in}} eighths of an inch. [...] Thus a PAR 64 is, nominally, 64 eighths of an inch <b>in</b> <b>diameter.</b> The approximate nominal lamp bell <b>diameter</b> <b>in</b> inches can be found by dividing the PAR size by 8. [...] For example, a PAR30 lamp is approximately 3.75inches <b>in</b> <b>diameter.</b> Similarly, the <b>diameter</b> <b>in</b> millimeters can be found by multiplying the PAR designation by 3.175. [...] For example, a PAR16 lamp is approximately 50.8mm <b>in</b> <b>diameter.</b>|$|R

50|$|Jobber-length drills are {{the most}} {{commonly}} found type of drill. The length of the flutes is between 9 and 14 times {{the diameter of the}} drill, depending on the drill size.

A 1/8 <b>in</b> <b>diameter</b> drill can drill a hole 1+5/8 in deep, since it is 13 times the <b>diameter</b> <b>in</b> flute length.|$|R
