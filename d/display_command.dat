50|$|DOS 5 {{debuted in}} June 1991. This {{is one of}} the biggest {{upgrades}} of DOS in its history. DOS 5 supported the use of the High Memory Area (HMA) and Upper Memory Blocks (UMBs) on 80286 and later systems to reduce its conventional memory usage. Also all DOS commands now supported the /? option to <b>display</b> <b>command</b> syntax. Aside from IBM's PC DOS, MS-DOS was the only other version available as OEM editions vanished since by this time PCs were 100% compatible so customizations for hardware differences were no longer necessary.|$|E
50|$|The {{communication}} protocol describes {{two sets of}} instructions. The <b>Display</b> <b>Command</b> Set (DCS) {{is a set of}} common commands for controlling the display device, and their format is specified by the DSI standard. It defines registers that can be addressed and what their operation is. It includes basic commands such as sleep, enable, and invert display. The Manufacturer Command Set (MCS) is a device-specific command space whose definition is up to the device manufacturer. It often includes commands required to program non-volatile memory, set specific device registers (such as Gamma correction), or perform other actions not described in the DSI standard. The packet format of both sets is specified by the DSI standard. There are Short and Long Packets, Short Packet is 4 bytes long; Long Packet can be of any length up to 216 bytes. Packets are composed of a DataID, Word count, Error Correction Code (ECC), Payload and Checksum (CRC). Commands that require reading data back from the device trigger a BTA event, which allows the device to reply with the requested data. A device cannot initiate a transfer; it can only reply to host requests.|$|E
50|$|Remote desktop {{software}} {{captures the}} mouse and keyboard inputs {{from the local}} computer (client) and sends them to the remote computer (server).

Based on a formal definition of an ontology structure, software resource ontology representing the semantic information of software resources is defined. Some corresponded definitions for software resources sharing are defined. To improve performance of the OSAP, the server push model and <b>display</b> <b>command</b> scheduling is applied. A modified form of the Microsoft Point-to-Point Compression protocol is used to perform bulk comppression. To provide the practicability of the OSAP, the low and high security level is used. It has been tested that the OSAP has better performance involving response time, network usage, RAM usage and CPU usage. Index Terms—Terminal Services, ontology, softwar...|$|E

40|$|BACKGROUND: There {{are three}} basic types of {{decision}} aids to facilitate operating room (OR) management decision-making {{on the day}} of surgery. Decision makers can rely on passive status displays (e. g., big screens or whiteboards), active status displays (e. g., text pager notification), and/or <b>command</b> <b>displays</b> (e. g., text recommendations about what to do). METHODS: Anesthesiologists, OR nurses, and housekeepers were given nine simulated scenarios (vignettes) involving multiple ORs to study their decision-making. Participants were randomized to one of four groups, all with an updated paper OR schedule: with/without <b>command</b> <b>display</b> and with/without passive status display. RESULTS: Participants making decisions without <b>command</b> <b>displays</b> performed no better than random chance in terms of increasing the predictability of work hours, reducing over-utilized OR time, and increasing OR efficiency. Status displays had no effect on these end-points, whereas <b>command</b> <b>displays</b> improved the quality of decisions. In the scenarios for which the <b>command</b> <b>displays</b> provided recommendations that adversely affected safety, participants appropriately ignored advice. CONCLUSIONS: Anesthesia providers and nursing staff made decisions that increased clinical work per unit time in each OR, even when doing so resulted in an increase in over-utilized OR time, higher staffing costs, unpredictable work hours, and/or mandatory overtime. Organizational culture and socialization during clinical training may be a cause. <b>Command</b> <b>displays</b> showed promise in mitigating this tendency. Additional investigations are in our companion paper...|$|R
5000|$|The first text editors were [...] "line editors" [...] {{oriented}} to teleprinter- or typewriter-style terminals without <b>displays.</b> <b>Commands</b> (often a single keystroke) effected edits to a file at an imaginary insertion point called the [...] "cursor". Edits were verified by typing a command to print a small {{section of the}} file, and periodically by printing the entire file. In some line editors, the cursor could be moved by commands that specified the line number in the file, text strings (context) for which to search, and eventually regular expressions. Line editors were major improvements over keypunching. Some line editors {{could be used by}} keypunch; editing commands could be taken from a deck of cards and applied to a specified file.

40|$|The present {{invention}} in {{its various}} aspects is {{as set out in}} the appended claims. In one embodiment, a method for improving aircraft pilot situational awareness includes receiving and processing datalink messages and automatic dependent surveillance-broadcast (ADS-B) data in an aircraft. A spatial and temporal situational model for the aircraft is generated based on the processed datalink messages and the processed ADSB data. At least a portion of the spatial and temporal situational model is rendered on a display device within the aircraft. In another embodiment, an aircraft pilot situational awareness improvement system includes a display device and a processor. The display device is coupled to receive image rendering <b>display</b> <b>commands</b> and is configured, upon receipt thereof, to render one or more images. The processor is configured to receive datalink messages and automatic dependent surveillance-broadcast (ADS-B) and is configured, upon receipt thereof, to process the received datalink messages and the received ADS-B data, generate a spatial and temporal situational model for the aircraft based on the processed datalink messages and the processed ADS-B data, and supply image rendering <b>display</b> <b>commands</b> to the <b>display</b> device that cause the display device to render at least a portion of the spatial and temporal situational model. Furthermore, other desirable features and characteristics of the aircraft pilot situational awareness improvement system and method will become apparent from the subsequent detailed description, taken in conjunction with the accompanying drawings and the preceding background...|$|R
