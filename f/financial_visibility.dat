5000|$|In common use, control {{accounts}} {{refer to}} those that would, under ideal circumstances, balance to zero. For example, an inventory control account will hold the balance amount between a stock account updated by stock transactions on the balance sheet {{and the value of}} stock on hand multiplied by its unit cost. Ideally these would be the same value but rarely are. Reasons for discrepancies include stock losses and gains yet to be [...] "journaled" [...] and the control account measures the differences and provides <b>financial</b> <b>visibility</b> and control of the value of those. If the discrepancy is significant, then actions such as stock counts can be triggered in order to validate stock and correct the balance sheet and clear the control account. Other examples would be the [...] "goods received not invoiced" [...] account.|$|E

Oyer (2004) posits that absence of RPE is optimal if the CEO's reservation wages from outside employment opportunities rise and fall with the economy's fortunes. We directly test and find support for Oyer's (2004) theory. We argue that the CEO's outside opportunities depend on his talent proxied by the CEO's <b>financial</b> press <b>visibility</b> and his firm's recent industry-adjusted ROA.

We also examine the influence of external factors, such as citizens’ income level, their educational level, and their sociopolitical commitment. The hypotheses were empirically tested, using a sample of ninety-two Spanish local public administrations. The data support the hypotheses, with different levels of robustness, and show that size, political will, and citizens’ income level all affect e-disclosure. ...|$|R

40|$|This paper {{documents}} {{that a large}} fraction of the companies going private from 1990 to 2004 were fairly young IPO firms that chose to revert back to their original organizational form, and therefore to a more concentrated ownership structure. Consistent {{with the findings of}} the earlier literature examining leverage buyouts (LBOs), we find strong support for Jensen’s free cash flow hypothesis, suggesting that one key reason for firms deciding to go private is to mitigate agency problems between insiders and outside shareholders. However, our evidence also reveals that firms with small growth in analyst coverage and institutional ownership, and low stock turnover were more likely to go private and opted to do so sooner. Thus, another potential reason for restructuring by these IPO firms may be their inability to enjoy the benefits of public ownership that come from <b>financial</b> <b>visibility</b> because of their failure to attract a critical mass of security analyst coverage and investor interest...|$|E

40|$|This study {{examines}} companies choosing {{to separate the}} tax and audit function prior to and subsequent {{to the passage of}} the Sarbanes-Oxley Act (2 ̆ 2 the Act 2 ̆ 2). While the provision of tax services is not currently prohibited by the Act, some companies have separated these two functions. An examination of the relationship between tax function separation and audit quality, <b>financial</b> statement <b>visibility</b> and tax minimization proxies is performed for two different samples: (1) a matched pair design for companies engaging their audit firm for tax work in 2001 (2 years before the Sarbanes-Oxley Act was placed in effect) and then separating the tax and audit function by 2003 (the effective year of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act), and (2) a logistic regression analysis on all companies in the Russell 2000, a major market index, for 2002 - 2004. The data used in this study is compiled from proxy statements filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission and commercially available information from I/B/E/S, COMPUSTAT and AuditAnalytics. ^ After controls for size, industry and growth are added to the model, the results reveal that in some years separation companies pay significantly less for their audit and, as a consequence, have higher instances of financial statement restatement. These results support the idea that the integration of audit and tax provide a better quality audit, supporting prior empirical work of Kinney et al. (2004) and anecdotal evidence from accounting firms. Some evidence for 2004 exists that separation companies are actually becoming less visible in the capital markets. Given that audit quality, analyst following, share turnover and management ownership are decreasing, this implies that these companies are less concerned with financial reporting quality. Overall, these findings suggest that tax service separation may be motivated by factors beyond merely shopping for the best tax provider. ...|$|R
40|$|Formed in 2001, Res Publica won the Estonian {{parliamentary}} elections in 2003, and its leader became prime minister. It lost the {{elections for the}} European Parliament in 2004 and was down to 5 % in opinion polls. The founding chair of the party analyzes here the causes for Res Publica's rapid rise and fall, reviewing the sociopolitical background of its rise and drawing comparisons with other new parties. Res Publica was a genuinely new party that involved no previous major players and might be characterized as a "purifying bridge party" that filled an empty niche at center right. Its rise was among the fastest in Europe. For success of a new party three factors must be present to a sufficient degree, as expressed by the following multiplication: Prospect of success = Membership x <b>Financial</b> Support x <b>Visibility.</b> Res Publica had all three.

We {{examine a}} sample of 54 {{management}} buyouts (MBO) in Japan from January 2001 to March 2009 and document an average buyout premium of 49. 0 % and a post-MBO investor average return of 54. 6 %. We find no evidence of operating performance improvements; rather, operating cash flow is worse after MBOs in Japan. However, MBO firms do sell off significant amounts of assets post-MBO. The median equity ownership of pre-buyout managers is 29. 36 % increasing to 59. 82 % post buyout. Our MBO sample firms have high equity book to market ratios compared to industry and size-matched control firms indicating that MBO firms are undervalued relative to their peers.

The objectives of study were: (i) toanalyze the <b>financial</b> <b>visibility</b> of pepper farm, (ii) to identify the channel of white peppermarketing and its margin in each agent of marketing, and (iii) to analyze the comparativeand competitive advantages of white pepper. Research used the method of structuredsurvey. Primary {{data were collected from}} 60 farmers, 15 merchants, 5 agents ofprocessing, and exporters. While secondary data were collected from Central Agency ofStatistics, the Office of Estate Crops, and Institutions of Research related to this study. The <b>financial</b> <b>visibility</b> of pepper farm was counted by using method of input-outputanalysis to get value of Beneficial Cost Ratio (B/C Ratio), Net Present Value (NPV), andInternal Rate Of Return (IRR). While the value of comparative and competitiveadvantages were estimated by using method of Policy Analysis Matrix (PAM). Resultsshowed that, period of pepper farm was 7 years where in the fourth year, pepper cropstarted create production of Rp. 15. 116 million and earnings of Rp. 9. 4.

40|$|Fog {{is often}} {{considered}} as a mere nuisance rather than a hazard. However, reduced meteorological visibility conditions cause accidents and transportation delays, with substantial <b>ﬁnancial</b> consequences. The <b>visibility</b> loss results from minute airborne droplets which scatter light, causing drastic alterations {{in the image of}} the environment perceived by vision systems, both human and artiﬁcial. Modeling the visual effects of dense fog makes it possible to simulate foggy conditions, in order to design and test countermeasures for improved safety and mobility. First, we introduce basic notions about the nature of fog and we brieﬂy review the microphysical models which usually serve to describe its droplet size distribution. Second, we explain how light interacts with fog droplets, and we present the optical descriptors which describe scattering and extinction phenomena. Third, we analyze how contrast is impaired by these phenomena {{in the image of the}} environment perceived by a vision system, and we propose and discuss a semi-analytic model of the visual effects of fog. Finally, we show applications of this model to the monitoring of the meteorological visibility through use of charge-coupled device cameras operating in the visible light range...|$|R

40|$|Following in the {{footsteps}} of the second wave feminist publishers of the 1970 s, Sandra Kay Martz founded Papier-Mache Press in 1984. Papier-Mache Press was known for publishing accessible books which, "presented important social issues through enduring works of beauty, grace, and strength," and "created a bridge of understanding between the mainstream audience and those who might not otherwise be heard. " This accessibility, combined with hard work, and savvy marketing and business sense, catapulted Papier-Mache to remarkable <b>financial</b> success and <b>visibility.</b> Of the 60, 000 book titles published in the United States each year, less than one percent sell over 100, 000 copies. Over 1. 6 million copies of the anthology When I Am An Old Woman I Shall Wear Purple were sold in bookstores and gift stores across the United States. This groundbreaking collection {{was one of the first}} non-clinical and positive books on women and aging, and was written by older women themselves. It challenged stereotypes and confronted the invisibility of older women in America. Several years later, another book in Martz's anthology series entitled I Am Becoming the Woman I've Wanted won the 1995 American Book Award. By 1998, Papier-Mache Press had published over sixty titles. In this oral history Martz discussed the successes of Papier-Mache Press, as well as the enormous changes in the book industry which took place in the late 1990 s. She credited feminist culture and politics with her success, and discussed her collegial relationships with other feminist publishers in the United States and Canada, many of whom were her inspiration. She provided an astute assessment of the future of feminist and independent publishing, and discussed the implications of the changes in book publishing in the 1990 s for literacy and the exchange of ideas in a free society. Papier-Mache Press is one of three presses archived at UC Santa Cruz's University Library, as part of the UC/Stanford US History and Women's Studies Consortium California Feminist Presses Project. The project is designed to preserve the output as well as the history of feminist presses in California. The other two presses collected are Shameless Hussy Press and HerBooks...|$|R

This paper shows that the higher involvement of private equity investors affects the going private market as these investors approach firms with different characteristics relative to the traditional management buy-outs. Our results on a sample of 212 UK going private transactions completed in the period 1997 - 2003 suggest that private equity backed deals differ from management sponsored deals without any backing of private equity investors in four ways. First, even though both types of deals suffer from market undervaluation, the mis-pricing is larger for management sponsored deals. Second, it is only management sponsored deals that suffer low <b>financial</b> <b>visibility</b> as their stock’s analyst coverage and frequency of trading are low. Third, Jensen’s free cash flow hypothesis seems not to apply to private equity backed deals as they have shortage of cash, low debt levels, and pay high dividends.

40|$|Numerous authorities, {{including}} governments, regulators, {{central banks}} and supra-national bodies {{have decided that}} this is a question deserving formal investigation. In Australia, there has been no official examination of how climate change might affect our financial system. Yet an 0. 9 °C observed increase in Australian average temperatures since 1910 has already been directly linked to increasingly frequent and intense heatwaves, and is likely linked to changing rainfall patterns observed in recent years. This paper explores where characteristics of Australia’s own financial system may intersect with identified risks relating to climate change. It highlights areas where existing financial system safeguards may not address these specific and unique risks. Drawing on studies and regulatory decisions from overseas and Australia, we set out why climate change deserves careful consideration from authorities charged with maintaining financial system stability. Key points Broad categories of climate financial risk: 	Carbon risk, which includes financial exposure to the risk of carbon emissions or carbon-intensive assets being priced, regulated, stranded by technology, or incurring legal risk 	Climate impact risk, where assets are damaged or devalued as a result of climate change itself How climate risk may originate: 	Efforts to avoid climate change, including domestic, foreign and international policy measures 	Shifting demand for carbon-intensive exports 	Shifting investor appetite for carbon intensive assets 	Fiscal risk from unfunded public contingent liabilities arising from the effects of climate change 	Uninsured or uninsurable assets exposed to increasingly probable catastrophic disasters 	Individuals and institutions are incentivised to ignore risks Points of transmission and amplification: 	How the effects of climate risk may magnify and spread throughout Australia’s financial system. These include: Australian sovereign debt, if affected by factors including macro outlook changes due to our carbon-intensive economy (carbon risk); and fiscal position shifts due to our exposure to climate change itself (climate impact risk) 	Exposure of Australian banks to carbon intensive assets via their business loan books (carbon risk) 	Exposure of Australian banks and parts of the insurance sector to climate impacts via their concentration in residential property & mortgage debt (climate impact and carbon risk) 	Exposure of large superannuation (pension) asset pools, due to concentration in domestic assets of a carbon-intensive, climate impact-exposed economy (carbon risk and climate impact risk) 	Shortage of low-carbon assets potentially leading to over-inflation of such assets Information barriers and opacity: 	Scientific climate models are subject to uncertainty; however this is improving Information is unevenly distributed, with some key <b>financial</b> agents lacking <b>visibility</b> of climate risk which may expose them to loss 	Both public and private disaster mapping data and modelling is unco-ordinated and difficult to acces...|$|R
