5|$|Ficus aurea {{ranges from}} Florida, across the {{northern}} Caribbean to Mexico, and south across Central America.

5|$|In {{its first}} {{advisory}} on the depression, the National Hurricane Center emphasized the threat for heavy rainfall in Jamaica, Cuba, Haiti, south <b>Florida,</b> <b>and</b> <b>the</b> Bahamas. The agency also advised small craft in Cuba and the Cayman Islands {{to remain at}} port. The depression was the first tropical cyclone threat to south Florida since Hurricane Andrew nine months prior, although officials noted the depression's winds were no cause for concern.|$|E

5|$|Spanish <b>Florida</b> <b>and</b> <b>the</b> English Province of Carolina {{were each}} {{subjected}} to attacks from the other, and the English engaged the French based at Mobile {{in what was}} essentially a proxy war involving primarily allied American Indians on both sides.

5|$|The Simpson and Suwannee points, {{found in}} <b>Florida</b> <b>and</b> <b>the</b> Southeastern United States, {{are similar to}} the Golondrina in shape and age. The Dalton point, found in the central United States, shares a similar outline and basal corner auriculation with Golondrina, which may imply that {{they are part of a}} series. Identification is made by {{examination}} of the blade edges—Golondrina exhibits much less serration. The Meserve type has also been known to cause confusion, as it is considered a resharpened variant of the Plainview and Golondrina types.|$|E
5|$|This bird breeds {{throughout}} most of North America, from Alaska and Canada southward to northern Florida and Mexico. While robins occasionally overwinter {{in the northern part}} of the United States and southern Canada, most migrate to winter south of Canada from <b>Florida</b> <b>and</b> <b>the</b> Gulf Coast to central Mexico, as well as along the Pacific Coast. Most depart south by the end of August and begin to return north in February and March (exact dates vary with latitude and climate).|$|E
5|$|A {{tropical}} wave emerged off {{the western}} coast of Africa on July10. Once {{north of the}} Greater Antilles, convective growth {{and the development of}} a well-defined surface low led to the formation of a tropical depression just south of Acklins Island by 06:00UTC on July22. Amid a brief reprieve in strong upper-level winds, the depression intensified into Tropical Storm Bonnie as it crossed Ragged Island around 23:15UTC that day. It later traversed Andros Island at peak intensity, with sustained winds of 45mph (75km/h), and weakened slightly before moving ashore near Elliott Key, Florida, with winds of 40mph (65km/h) on July23. Bonnie weakened to a tropical depression as it crossed South <b>Florida,</b> <b>and</b> <b>the</b> persistent effects of strong wind shear prevented intensification in the Gulf of Mexico. The cyclone degenerated into a remnant low by 00:00UTC on July25 and later moved into southeastern Louisiana before dissipating later that day.|$|E

5|$|A {{tropical}} wave {{moved off}} the coast of Africa on August 16. The wave axis tracked steadily westward, and on August 23 convection increased after the wave passed beneath a cold-core upper-level low. By August 27, the wave axis was located over Cuba, with the area of convection located between <b>Florida</b> <b>and</b> <b>the</b> Bahamas after tracking northwestward. The disturbance crossed southern Florida, and after entering the Gulf of Mexico an anticyclone provided favorable conditions for further development. It tracked slowly westward at 5mph (7km/h), and after developing a surface circulation the system developed into a tropical depression on August 29 while located about 230miles (370km) south-southwest of New Orleans, Louisiana.|$|E
5|$|As Hurricane Ida {{moved over}} the Yucatán Channel on November8, the NHC issued a {{hurricane}} watch for areas between Grand Isle, Louisiana and Mexico Beach, Florida. As the storm {{moved closer to}} the states, a tropical storm warning was declared for areas between Grand Isle and Pascagoula, Mississippi, as well as areas between Indian Pass, <b>Florida,</b> <b>and</b> <b>the</b> mouth of the Aucilla River. The hurricane watch was also modified to encompass a smaller area, between Grand Isle and Pascagoula. A hurricane warning was also issued from Pascagoula to Indian Pass. During the afternoon of November9, all hurricane watches and warnings were discontinued and the tropical storm warning was modified to include areas between Grand Isle and the mouth of the Aucilla River. As Ida became extratropical, the NHC discontinued all watches and warnings on the storm on November10.|$|E
5|$|As a child, Ted was {{frequently}} uprooted as {{his family moved}} among Bronxville, New York, Hyannis Port, Massachusetts, Palm Beach, <b>Florida,</b> <b>and</b> <b>the</b> Court of St. James's in London, England. His formal education started at Gibbs School, in Sloane Street, Kensington, London. He attended ten different schools {{by the age of}} eleven, with his education suffering as a result. Ted was an altar boy at the St. Joseph's Church and received his First Communion from Pope Pius XII in the Vatican at age seven. Ted spent sixth and seventh grades in the Fessenden School, where he was a mediocre student, and eighth grade at Cranwell Preparatory School; both schools were in Massachusetts. His parents were affectionate toward him as the youngest child, but also compared him unfavorably with his older brothers.|$|E

5|$|Due to Nicole's {{atypical}} structure, {{the strongest}} thundershowers were well {{removed from the}} center; most of the weather activity occurred over the north-central Caribbean. In Jamaica, the storm triggered widespread power outages across more than 288,000residences. Extreme precipitation of up to 37.42inches (940mm) caused disastrous flooding in several parishes, severely damaging or destroying 528 houses. The devastation extended to the island's farmland and environment, which suffered from expansive water pollution. In all, Nicole wrought an estimated $240million (2010USD) in damage throughout Jamaica, and there were sixteenfatalities. Elsewhere, minor flooding occurred in Cuba, <b>Florida,</b> <b>and</b> <b>the</b> Cayman Islands. The remnants of the storm contributed to a large disturbance along the East Coast of the United States, causing additional damage and deaths.|$|E
5|$|Early on August 27, {{the storm}} {{weakened}} below tropical storm status and transitioned into an extratropical cyclone while moving over cooler waters. The system dissipated shortly after over open waters. Although the storm remained over {{water for the}} duration of its existence, the outer reaches of the system brought rain and light winds to Georgia, <b>Florida,</b> <b>and</b> <b>the</b> Carolinas. In Jacksonville, Florida, the storm produced 0.47 in (11.9 mm) of rain on August 25. Between August 26 and 27, Cape Hatteras received 2.06 in (52.3 mm) of rain from the storm.|$|E
