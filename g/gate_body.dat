40|$|The dynamic {{behaviour}} of gates in hydraulic structures caused by passing flow poses {{a potential threat}} to flood protection. Complex interactions between the turbulent flow and the suspended <b>gate</b> <b>body</b> may induce undesired vibrations. This thesis contributes {{to a better understanding}} and prevention of gate vibrations by employing a variety of computational approaches. Simulations with the finite-element method are used to analyse the fluid-structure interaction of a new underflow gate type which exploits leakage flow to temper the excitation. A physical model experiment of the same configuration confirms this beneficial effect for a wider range of conditions. Furthermore, an outline of a control system is given that is based on data from acceleration sensors installed on the gates. It is shown how this system can be trained to classify future states and thus support operational decisions that avoid critical vibrations. Moreover, evolutionary computing is explored as a system identification tool for dynamical systems. The differential evolution algorithm was applied to recover the coefficients of several non-linear motion equations of self-excited oscillations from time signals. The collective results from these different methods help to eliminate problems related to flow-induced gate vibrations and so increase water safety...|$|E

40|$|Abstract—The {{increasing}} leakage {{power consumption}} and stringent thermal constraint necessitate more aggressive leakage control techniques. Power <b>gating</b> and <b>body</b> biasing {{are widely used}} for standby leakage control. Their large energy overhead for performing mode transition is the major obstacle for more aggressive leakage control. Temperature and process variation (TV/PV) further magnify the overhead problem, leading to socalled “corner case leakage control ” problem. Light-Weight Vth Hopping (LW-VH) is a candidate technique to tackle the energy overhead problem. This paper demonstrates the application of LW-VH on microarchitectural- and RTL-level idleness exploitation with adaptive control techniques for TV/PV compensation. Adaptive LW-VH shows 30 % average saving on total CPU leakage at microarchitectural level, and 4 % to 15 % leakage saving at RTL level. By combining all the techniques proposed in this paper, a three-tier aggressive leakage control system is introduced to fully exploit idleness at all levels.

40|$|Abstract — Over {{the last}} decade, {{the design of}} ultra-low-power digital {{circuits}} in subthreshold regime {{has been driven by}} the quest for minimum energy per operation. In this contribution, we observe that operating at minimum-energy point is not straightforward as design constraints from real-life applications have an important impact on energy. Therefore, we introduce the alternative concept of practical energy, taking functional-yield and throughput constraints on minimum Vdd into account. In this context, we demonstrate {{for the first time the}} detrimental impact of DIBL on minimum Vdd. Practical energy gives a useful analysis framework of circuit optimization to reach minimum-energy point, while consid-ering the throughput as an input variable dictated by the application. From simulation of a benchmark multiplier in 45 nm technology, we find out that practical energy can be far higher than minimum energy point, in the case of low-throughput applications (≈ 10 - 100 kOp/s) because of static leakage energy and robustness-limited minimum Vdd. With the proposed framework, we investigate the capability of conven-tional optimization techniques to make practical energy meet minimum energy point. Amongst these techniques, channel length upsize is shown to be more efficient than MTCMOS power <b>gating,</b> <b>body</b> biasing, Vt selection or device width upsize, as it increases robustness while simultaneously reducing static leakage energy. A small length upsize with low area overhead is shown to reduce practical energy at low throughput to less than 2. 1 × the minimum energy level. At medium throughput, it even brings practical energy 30 % lower than minimum energy level without optimization techniques. I...|$|R
