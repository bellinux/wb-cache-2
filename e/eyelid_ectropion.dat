50|$|The {{advantages}} of this flap {{is that there}} is no need to skin graft the donor site and scars are placed at the natural skin folds. This flap is used for posterior and moderate-sized anterior cheek defects. Lower <b>eyelid</b> <b>ectropion</b> should be prevented, by minimizing tension and by overcorrection and suspension of the cheek flap to the lateral orbital rim. This anterior-based flap is supplied by the facial and submental arteries and advances upward from the cervical area and rotates forward.|$|E

40|$|PURPOSE: To {{describe}} the previously unreported managed ment of the eyelid anomalies associated with blepharo-cheilo-dontic syndrome. Blepharo-cheflo-dontic syndrome is a syndrome of congenital cleft lip/palate, oligodontia, euryblepharon, <b>eyelid</b> <b>ectropion,</b> and lagophthalmos. METHODS: Case report. A 3 -month-old male presented with bilateral {{upper and lower}} <b>eyelid</b> <b>ectropion</b> with eyelid retraction, marked euryblepharon, severe lagophthalmos, and a right side cleft lip/palate. Lateral tarsal strips, lower eyelid retractor disinsertion, myocutaneous advancement of the cheek and eyelids, and lateral tarsorrhaphy were performed. RESULTS: Correction of the ectropion, eyelid retraction, euryblepharon, and marked improvement in his lagophthalmos were achieved postoperatively. No recurrence of the ectropion or euryblepharon has been noted after 6 months of follow-up. CONCLUSION: Appropriate reconstructive surgery of the eyelids reduces the morbidity associated with the eyelid anomalies and provides an excellent cosmetic result for patients with blepharo-cheilo-dontic syndrome.

40|$|AIM:To {{evaluate}} the efficacy {{and characteristics of}} silicone tube double-passage annular lacrimal intubation and epidural catheter for repairing the traumatic lacrimal rupture. METHODS:Retrospective case study. Sixty-two cases(62 eyes) with traumatic lacrimal rupture {{were involved in the}} study from January 2009 to December 2013. Thirty-two cases(32 eyes) were treated with silicone tube double-passage annular lacrimal intubation, 30 cases(30 eyes) with epidural catheter. All cases were underwent anastomosis surgery successfully after having searched for the broken ends of canaliculus by operation microscope. The operation time, postoperative reaction, efficacy, complications and so on were retrospectively analyzed between two methods. RESULTS:The operation time of silicone tube double-passage annular lacrimal intubation group was 55 ～ 120 (85. 17 ± 15. 05) min and epidural catheter group was 30 ～ 70 (49. 83 ± 10. 71) min. Four cases(12. 5 %) in silicone tube double-passage annular lacrimal intubation group happened postoperative anastomotic inflammation in 1 wk and 24 cases(80 %) happened in epidural catheter group. Thirty-one cases(97 %) in silicone tube double-passage annular lacrimal intubation group and 26 case(87 %) in epidural catheter group were anastomosed successfully 1 wk after the stents was removed. At 6 mo after surgeries, in silicone tube double-passage annular lacrimal intubation group, 2 cases(6 %) were accompanied by lower <b>eyelid</b> <b>ectropion</b> and 1 case(3 %) were accompanied by lacrimal puncta laceration. And in epidural catheter group, 10 cases(33 %) were accompanied by lower <b>eyelid</b> <b>ectropion</b> and 5 case(17 %) were accompanied by lacrimal puncta laceration. CONCLUSION:A good result can be obtained by using the silicone tube double-passage annular lacrimal intubation and epidural catheter for repairing the traumatic lacrimal rupture. But in silicone tube double-passage annular lacrimal intubation group, postoperative reaction is lighter and complications can be less. In epidural catheter group, postoperative reaction is heavy and complications are more...|$|E
40|$|Abstract BACKGROUND: Patients with Möbius and Poland-Möbius syndromes may {{experience}} paralytic lagophthalmos. METHODS: This is a retrospective interventional case series. We report 1 case of Möbius syndrome and 2 cases of Poland-Möbius syndrome, wherein patients underwent lower blepharoplasty for lagophthalmos with 2 different surgical techniques. RESULTS: Two patients with Poland-Möbius syndrome presenting with bilateral lower eyelid entropion and paralytic lagophthalmos underwent lower eyelid elongation using right auricular cartilage via a transcutaneous approach. One patient with Möbius syndrome presenting with monolateral lower <b>eyelid</b> <b>ectropion</b> and lagophthalmos underwent lower eyelid elongation with Tessier cheek rotation flap. In all cases, lagophthalmos disappeared, and no complications were reported after a mean follow-up period of 19. 6 months. CONCLUSIONS: A good functional correction of lagophthalmos was obtained at long-term follow-up with 2 different surgical techniques. In patients with Möbius and Poland-Möbius syndromes, correction of lagophthalmos should be rapidly undertaken to prevent consequences of exposure keratopathy...|$|E

40|$|Purpose: We {{conducted}} a noncomparative, retrospective chart review of 45 patients and 51 eyelids with {{the diagnosis of}} involutional entropion or ectropion that underwent full-thickness lower eyelid shortening between June 2001 and February 2004, in whom the severity of actinic damage was analyzed {{in relation to the}} eyelid position. Patients with any different surgical approach or other primary causes of abnormal eyelid position, such as paralytic, congenital, or mechanical factors, were excluded. Methods: After excision, all eyelid specimens were examined by a single anatomic pathologist, who was masked to the type of eyelid malposition. The extent of dermal actinic change was evaluated under light microscopy, according to a previously validated grading system. Results: Fifty-one eyelids from 26 male and 19 female patients were analyzed. The mean age at the surgery was 76 +/- 10 years (range, 52 to 92 years), affecting one side in 39 cases and both sides in 6 cases. The most frequent <b>eyelid</b> malposition was <b>ectropion,</b> which affected two thirds of the cases (35 eyelids). Half of the patients presented with mild actinic skin changes; however, the severity of the histologic skin actinic changes was significantly worse in patients with ectropion in comparison to those with entropion (p < 0. 0001). Conclusions: Actinic damage affecting the anterior lamella of the lower eyelid contributes as an additional factor in final eyelid position in patients with involutional eyelid changes. More severe and extensive actinic changes were present in <b>eyelids</b> with <b>ectropion...</b>|$|R

40|$|Objective: The {{aim of this}} {{surgical}} procedure was to definitively correct severe recurrent upper and lower bilateral <b>eyelid</b> <b>ectropion</b> after 2 attempts with full-thickness skin grafts. It was necessary to repair all 4 eyelids with forehead skin. Middle lamella support was required. Methods: Bilateral median forehead flaps, which were well vascularized by the supratrochlear vessels, were chosen for this procedure to utilize the readily available forehead tissue. The median forehead flap can be easily positioned to cover the entire eyelid. Furthermore, the flap could be split in half, without the risk of vascular compromise. Middle lamella support was provided with a cartilage graft from the nasal septum. Results: At 4 months, the patient no longer suffered from exposure keratopathy and both forehead flaps had healed well. At 12 months, the functional and cosmetic outcomes of this procedure were acceptable. Conclusions: This method of surgery can be effective in the young, in whom the Mustarde cheek advancement fails, or when there is little available unburnt tissue. It {{can be used as}} an alternative to a forehead flap when both upper and lower eyelids are damaged bilaterally. The split forehead flap definitively corrected the ectropion in this case...|$|E
40|$|Objective: To {{evaluate}} the gender and {{the characteristics of}} the ectropion carriers in our region. Methods: A retrospective study was done evolving 112 ectropion carriers. The sex, race, eyelashes alterations (trichiasis and distichiasis), anterior and posterior blepharitis, conjunctival redness, íris color and pterygium presence were evaluated. Gender data were correlated to ectropion classification (involutional, cicatricial, mechanic or paralytic) and submitted to statiscal analysis. Results: The <b>eyelid</b> <b>ectropion</b> occurred more between 71 and 80 years old. The involutional ectropion was the most frequently observed (66, 07 %), followed by the cicatricial, mechanic, associated types and paralytic. The majority of the patients were male (70, 53 %), with White skin. Trichiasis (21, 42 %) and distichiasis (4, 46 %) were associated to the ectropion eyelid and mainly in the involutional ectropion carriers. Half of the sample had blepharitis and the majority of the patients had red eye (60 %) and brown iris (63, 39 %). Perygium was absent in the majority of the patients.

40|$|AIM: To {{evaluate}} {{the value of}} silicone intubation and ring-fixed method in canalicular laceration. METHODS: A retrospective study of 36 cases with laceration of lacrimal canaliculus. For all the patients, microscope was used to find the broken ends of the lacrimal canaliculus, and then straight insertion was performed to the distant and near broken ends through {{the upper and lower}} lacrimal points, then passed the dacryocyst to insert nasolacrimal canal and ended up in inferior nasal meatus. Thus, clinical data about forming annular support to treat laceration of lacrimal canaliculus was presented here. RESULTS: All 36 patients with traumatic canalicular laceration were anastomosed successfully and all patients healed without infection. The surgery went well, intubation was smoothly, all patients were followed-up for another 6 mo after the stent was removed. The accidental fall off of the stent was not observed during the follow-up. During the follow-up 10 - 18 mo after extubation, when the stent was removed, 32 cases(88. 9 %) recovered to normal lacrimal drainage function; 4 cases(11. 1 %) remained epiphora with obstructed lacrimal passage. All cases were no lower <b>eyelid</b> <b>ectropion.</b> CONCLUSION: For the patients with inferior canalicular laceration, the silicone intubation and ring-fixed method is effective, low irritation and less complication...|$|E

40|$|Radiotherapy {{represents}} {{a major problem}} in facial surgery. Orbital and periorbital radiation therapy causes a contraction of the soft tissues. Scarring with ectropion is the most severe complication, with shrinking of the anterior lamella, skin dystrophy, muscle atrophy, and alteration of the remaining soft tissues. Goals for reconstruction include correction of distorted orbitofacial tissues and the restoration of orbital structures. The management of these patients is not standardized. We suggest systematically using a combined approach of surgery and lipofilling to restore the orbital deformity and dystrophy, respectively. For this purpose, we present the case of a 65 -year-old woman with asymmetry of the orbital regions and severe lower <b>eyelid</b> cicatricial <b>ectropion</b> due to multiple radiation treatments in childhood for an extensive cavernous hemangioma of {{the right side of the}} face. We performed a reconstructive procedure using a tarsal strip technique in association with contralateral upper eyelid graft to correct the extensive retraction of the right lower eyelid and lid asymmetry. Subsequently, the patient underwent lipofilling to correct the post-radiotherapy dystrophy. Skin texture, softness, and elasticity greatly improved with further symmetrization. The combined treatment with surgery and lipofilling can significantly improve the functional and cosmetic outcome of shortened and dystrophic eyelids with a successful result with regard to post-radiotherapy retraction.

40|$|Subciliary and transconjunctival {{approaches}} {{are commonly used}} to enter the orbital floor. Although both surgical approaches {{have been used for}} decades, there is no consensus regarding the most appropriate incision to prevent postoperative lower eyelid complications. The aim {{of this study was to}} compare the frequencies of lower eyelid complications after subciliary versus transconjunctival approaches to orbital floor fractures. The investigator implemented a retrospective cohort study and enrolled a sample consisting of subjects who had orbital floor repair. The predictor variable was two different surgical methods, subciliary or transconjunctival approch. The primary outcome variable was postoperative lower <b>eyelid</b> complications (<b>ectropion,</b> entropion, and <b>eyelid</b> retraction). Other variables were demographic backgrounds, anatomical consideration, or time to surgery. The samples were composed of 346 patients (98 [28. 3 %] females; 225 [65 %] underwent a subciliary approach) with a mean age of 42. 7 ± 21. 1 years. The subciliary approach was significantly linked to the higher rates of ectropion and the lower rates of entropion at 7 days and 6 months postoperatively. There was no statistically significant difference in the frequency of eyelid retraction between both groups. In the setting of orbital floor fractures, these results suggest that the use of the subciliary approach increases the frequency of ectropion, while the transconjunctival approach increases the frequency of entropion. Consequently, the selection should be based on an individual patient basis and surgeon’s preference...|$|R
40|$|AIM: To {{investigate}} the long-term clinical effect of modified frontalis tendon flap suspension {{in the treatment}} of severe blepharoptosis in children. METHODS: A total of 83 cases(114 eyes) of modified frontalis tendon flap suspension for children severe blepharoptosis correction were analyzed between January 2009 to December 2011 for the efficacy and complications of this surgery. Follow-up observation for 5 a. RESULTS: In the fifth year after operation, there were 84 eyes(73. 7 %) with correction and satisfactory correction, 30 eyes(26. 3 %) were corrected, and the operation was satisfactory. Postoperative complications included 4 eyes(3. 5 %) of inverted eyelashes, of which 3 eyes were given suture traction at 1 / 3 interior of the gray line, 1 wk later inverted eyelashes disappeared, 1 eye of secondary surgery. Conjunctival prolapse was in 2 eyes(1. 8 %), the application of corticosteroids eye drops, pressure bandage were used for 1 wk and conjunctival prolapse disappeared.

40|$|PURPOSE: To {{determine}} {{the frequency of}} ophthalmic abnormalities in patients with cutaneous T-cell lymphoma (mycosis fungoides and Sézary syndrome) and T-cell lymphoma involving the skin and to describe the clinical course of the disease with selected examples. METHODS: A computerized diagnostic retrieval system was used to identify all patients with T-cell lymphoma involving the skin who were examined at the Mayo Clinic (Rochester, Minnesota) between January 1, 1976 and December 31, 1990. The medical records of affected patients were reviewed. RESULTS: During the 15 -year interval from 1976 through 1990, cutaneous T-cell lymphoma was diagnosed in 2, 155 patients. Of these 2, 155 patients, 42 (1. 95 %; 26 male and 16 female) had at least 1 ophthalmic abnormality attributable to the disease. The diagnoses in these 42 patients were mycosis fungoides in 19, clinical variants of T-cell lymphoma of the skin (most commonly, peripheral T-cell lymphoma) in 11, and Sézary syndrome in 12. Cicatricial <b>eyelid</b> <b>ectropion</b> {{was the most common}} finding, affecting 17 (40. 4 %) of the 42 patients.

40|$|The use of {{trichloroacetic acid}} (TCA) as a {{periorbital}} and eyelid peel for skin rejuvenation is gaining significant acceptance among oculoplastic surgeons, dermatologists, and other surgery groups. In {{spite of the}} current enthusiasm, there remain potentially serious complications resulting from any periorbital peel. Cases of cicatricial ectropion {{have been reported in}} phenol-peeled patients, and lower <b>eyelid</b> <b>ectropion</b> has reportedly occurred in patients undergoing deep eyelid peel in conjunction with a blepharoplasty (1, 2). To avoid this complication, it is necessary to better understand the depth of the wound produced by different strengths and combinations of peeling agents applied to living eyelid tissue and, more important, to determine the concentrations of TCA that are likely to lead to cicatricial ectropion when applied in a consistent fashion. We chose upper-eyelid skin because it is easier to obtain for histopathologic study than lower-eyelid skin and, in our experience, is more sensitive to hypertrophic changes after chemical peeling or carbon dioxide laser resurfacing. We applied TCA to the preseptal skin of 10 patients 48 h before standard upper-eyelid blepharoplasty. The acid was applied to produce a "frost," using varying concentrations of acid, ranging from 20 to 50 %. The treated skin removed at the time of blepharoplasty was reviewed in a masked fashion by a dermatopathologist to determine the depth of necrosis. We found that superficial peels with necrosis involving 30 % of the epidermis were produced by the lowest-concentration combination of TCA applied (20 % followed by 0 %). As the strength increased, so did the depth of peel. The combination of 50 % followed by a second application of 50 % produced the deepest peel, with necrosis into the papillary dermis. This finding would indicate that the chance of developing cicatricial ectropion with any of the tested combinations of TCA should be very remot...|$|E

Here we provide {{a critical review}} of all patients published with these syndromes. We excluded several earlier reports due to misdiagnosis or insufficient data for reliable confirmation of the diagnosis. There remain 16 reliably diagnosed individuals with BSS and 16 with AMS. Major facial characteristics present in both entities, albeit often in differing frequencies, are excessive facial creases, hypertelorism, underdevelopment of the anterior part of the <b>eyelids</b> (anterior lamella), <b>ectropion,</b> broad nasal ridge and tip, thick and flaring alae nasi, protruding maxilla, wide mouth, thin upper vermillion, and attached ear lobes. In BSS a remarkable extension of the columella on the philtrum can be seen, and in both the medial parts of the cheeks bulge towards {{the corners of the}} mouth (cheek pads). Scalp hair is sparse in AMS only, but sparse eyebrows and eyelashes occur in both entities, and general hypertrichosis occurs in BSS. We compare these characteristics with those in Setleis syndrome which can also be caused by TWIST 2 mutations. The resemblance between the three syndromes is considerable, and likely differences seem larger than they actually are due to insufficiently complete evaluation for all characteristics of the three entities in the past. It is likely that with time it can be concluded that BSS. AMS and Setleis syndrome form a continuum. © 2016 Wiley Periodicals, In...|$|R
