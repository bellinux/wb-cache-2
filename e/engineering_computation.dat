50|$|From {{representing}} the six special cases, {{we see a}} clear advantage of the moment matrix representation, i.e., it allows a unified representation for seemingly diverse types of knowledge, including linear equations, joint and conditional distributions, and ignorance. The unification is significant not only for knowledge representation in artificial intelligence but also for statistical analysis and <b>engineering</b> <b>computation.</b> For example, the representation treats the typical logical and probabilistic components in statistics — observations, distributions, improper priors (for Bayesian statistics), and linear equation models — not as separate concepts, but as manifestations of a single concept. It allows one to see the inner connections between these concepts or manifestations and to interplay them for computational purposes.|$|E

40|$|Software {{engineers}} advocate {{that the}} first step in system development should be a systematic elicitation, analysis and documentation of the requirements, because it is much easier and cheaper to correct mistakes and misconceptions {{at the beginning of the}} process than it is to try and fix problems during implementation and maintenance. The software engineering community agrees on the necessity of a complete and consistent software requirements document for evaluating any software system quality, including reliability [1]. Although requirements documentation has been demonstrated to be effective in other application areas, this stage of the software development is often neglected when solving <b>engineering</b> <b>computation</b> problems. This paper argues that the reliability of <b>engineering</b> <b>computation</b> can be significantly improved by adopting software engineering methodologies for requirements analysis and specification. The argument that requirements analysis can improve the reliability of <b>engineering</b> <b>computation</b> is first made by observing the strong similarity between the waterfall model of the software life cycle and the standard model of the scientific method. The strong similarity implies that <b>engineering</b> <b>computation</b> can benefit from methods that have proved to be successfu...|$|E
40|$|Abstract. This paper {{argues that}} the {{reliability}} of <b>engineering</b> <b>computation</b> can be significantly improved by adopting software engineering methodologies for requirements analysis and specification. The argument centers around {{the fact that the}} only way to judge the reliability of a system is by comparison to a specification of the requirements. This paper also points to methods for documenting the requirements. In particular, a requirements template is proposed for specifying <b>engineering</b> <b>computation</b> software. To make the mathematical specification easily understandable by all stakeholders, the technique of using tabular expressions is advocated. To clarify the presentation, a case study of the documentation for a system for analyzing statically determinant beams is presented...|$|E
