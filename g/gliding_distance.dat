50|$|If {{there is}} a {{suitable}} landing spot within the aircraft's <b>gliding</b> or autorotation <b>distance,</b> an unplanned landing will often result in no injuries or significant damage to the aircraft, since powered aircraft generally use little or no power when they are landing.

Glider pilots routinely land away from their base and so most cross-country pilots are in current practice.|$|R

50|$|For over a {{thousand}} years after this, paper aircraft were the dominant man-made heavier-than-air craft whose principles could be readily appreciated, though thanks to their high drag coefficients, not of an exceptional performance when <b>gliding</b> over long <b>distances.</b> The pioneers of powered flight have all studied paper model aircraft in order to design larger machines. Da Vinci wrote of {{the building of a}} model plane out of parchment, and of testing some of his early ornithopter, an aircraft that flies by flapping wings, and parachute designs using paper models. Thereafter, Sir George Cayley explored the performance of paper gliders in the late 19th century.

50|$|All {{fixed-wing}} aircraft have some capability to glide with no engine power; that is, {{they do not}} sink straight down like a stone, but rather continue to glide moving horizontally while descending. For example, with a glide ratio of 15:1, a Boeing 747-200 can glide for 150 km from a cruising altitude of 10,000 m. After a loss of power, the pilotâ€™s goal is to fly the descending aircraft to the most suitable landing spot within <b>gliding</b> <b>distance,</b> and then land with {{the least amount of}} damage possible. The area open for potential landing sites depends on the original altitude, local terrain, the engine-out gliding capabilities of the aircraft, original airspeed and winds at various altitudes.|$|E
