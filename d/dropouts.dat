At the time, its rates were the highest in {{the province}}, with a total of six <b>dropouts</b> for every 100 students enrolled. In contrast, the district average was 0.9 <b>dropouts</b> per 100 enrolments, and the provincial average was 2.4 <b>dropouts.</b> The following year, the school's rate dropped to 5.4, remaining three percentage points above the provincial average. In 2007, it fell 2.2 points, down to 3.2 <b>dropouts</b> per 100 students, and finally settled at 2%, 0.2 percentage points below the provincial average of 2.2%.|$|E

40|$|<b>Dropout</b> {{of sport}} {{is an issue}} in sport and public health domains. The {{aim of this study}} was to {{identify}} the potential <b>dropout</b> reasons of school athletes and to examine if their perception of <b>dropout</b> was affected by the previous <b>dropout</b> experience. There were 50 subjects who were divided into two groups based on their previous <b>dropout</b> experience (<b>Dropout</b> Group= 22, No <b>Dropout</b> Group= 28). They filled a questionnaire about potential <b>dropout</b> reasons of the current sport. Coach and teammates were two predominated reasons of dropout; Influence of parent and training seemed to affect the termination of the sport to a lesser extent. Moreover, the perception of social value and lost focus were significantly different between two groups. Character of coach and teammates affect the engagement of training in school athletes. However, the parental influence had less influence than expected. Training intensity played little role as the <b>dropout</b> reason. Previous experience of <b>dropout</b> had an impact of potential <b>dropout</b> reasons on their current sport training...|$|R

5|$|Enrollment dropped {{every year}} since the program's {{inception}} such that, when compounded by <b>dropouts,</b> the program was below half-capacity three years later. UW President Glenn Frank had warned of decreased enrollment in August 1928 and of its consequences for the college. UW College of Letters and Science Dean George Sellery offered support conditional on codified discipline and uniform final exams, which Meiklejohn refused. Sellery later refused to allow transfer students into the college. Meiklejohn wrote letters to Wisconsin high schools in April 1929 that acknowledged the college's stereotypes and welcomed demographic change, but the campaign backfired. He sent an adviser to tour the state and solve {{what he saw as}} a communication issue. The adviser found high school seniors largely interested in vocational training, and that the prospect of traditional college excited students {{to the point where they}} did not consider improvements upon that model. The adviser found students uninterested in the Experimental College's prospects.|$|E

This thesis reviews {{the literature on}} therapy <b>dropout</b> and offers specific recommendations and conclusions as {{to the state of}} the literature. Client variables associated with <b>dropout</b> are reviewed in their use for prediction of <b>dropout.</b> Single factors proven to significantly effect <b>dropout</b> are racial status, income, and education. Other client variables reach significance only when used in combination; and, these variables have been applied to predict <b>dropout</b> with an accuracy of up to 80 %.

40|$|<b>Dropout</b> is {{a popular}} {{technique}} for regularizing artificial neural networks. <b>Dropout</b> networks are generally trained by minibatch gradient descent with a <b>dropout</b> mask turning {{off some of the}} units [...] -a different pattern of <b>dropout</b> is applied to every sample in the minibatch. We explore a very simple alternative to the <b>dropout</b> mask. Instead of masking dropped out units by setting them to zero, we perform matrix multiplication using a submatrix of the weight matrix [...] -unneeded hidden units are never calculated. Performing <b>dropout</b> batchwise, so that one pattern of <b>dropout</b> is used for each sample in a minibatch, we can substantially reduce training times. Batchwise <b>dropout</b> can be used with fully-connected and convolutional neural networks...|$|R
40|$|We analyze <b>dropout</b> in deep {{networks}} with rectified linear {{units and}} the quadratic loss. Our results expose surprising {{differences between the}} behavior of <b>dropout</b> and more traditional regularizers like weight decay. For example, on some simple data sets <b>dropout</b> training produces negative weights even though the output {{is the sum of}} the inputs. This provides a counterpoint to the suggestion that <b>dropout</b> discourages co-adaptation of weights. We also show that the <b>dropout</b> penalty can grow exponentially in the depth of the network while the weight-decay penalty remains essentially linear, and that <b>dropout</b> is insensitive to various re-scalings of the input features, outputs, and network weights. This last insensitivity implies that there are no isolated local minima of the <b>dropout</b> training criterion. Our work uncovers new properties of <b>dropout,</b> extends our understanding of why <b>dropout</b> succeeds, and lays the foundation for further progress...|$|R

25|$|There {{have been}} some {{problems}} using disc brakes with certain frame designs.

40|$|The {{present study}} {{examined}} predictors of couple therapy <b>dropout</b> in the VA medical centers using six different <b>dropout</b> criteria. The most accurate <b>dropout</b> definitions included using a statistical modeling procedure {{to determine whether}} the client's rate of change at the final session was greater than average of change for all clients; clients who were still demonstrating gains greater than the average rate of change at the final session were considered to have terminated prematurely. A total of 177 couples (354 individuals) who sought therapy in the VA medical centers in Charleston, SC and San Diego, CA were examined. With a few exceptions, demographic variables generally did not predict <b>dropout.</b> A couple's relationship adjustment and response to conflict were significant predictors of <b>dropout.</b> The content of therapy sessions predicted <b>dropout</b> only when <b>dropout</b> was defined, at least in part, by client's rate of change at the final session, suggesting that such methods of defining premature termination are the most sensitive to the therapy process.

30|$|Here, we applied <b>dropout</b> {{during the}} {{training}} of our hierarchical CNN network as follows. First, we used the same <b>dropout</b> rate for each layer, though there exist sophisticated optimization methods for tuning the <b>dropout</b> rate for each layer separately [36]. We varied the <b>dropout</b> rate with a step size of 0.05, and the best result on the development set was obtained with 0.25. We note here that the original paper used a <b>dropout</b> rate of 0.5, but by allowing an extremely large number of training epochs [28]. Most other authors reported the best results with smaller <b>dropout</b> rates between 0.1 and 0.3 [8, 19, 29] perhaps because they used fewer training iterations. For <b>dropout</b> training, we modified our code so that one “epoch” consisted of five sweeps through the data instead of just one. We found that this fivefold increase in the training time was necessary to get good results with <b>dropout.</b>|$|R
40|$|Objectives: To {{examine the}} effect of high school <b>dropout</b> on {{subsequent}} criminal convictions and how postdropout resource attainment in terms of education and employment may modify such an effect. Methods: Propensity score matching (PSM) using administrative register data covering two full Swedish birth cohorts is employed to assess {{the effect of}} <b>dropout</b> on convictions. Event history analysis is used to examine the modifying effect of subsequent resource attainment. Results: The PSM analysis reveals an effect of <b>dropout</b> on convictions for men, whereas no evidence of such an effect is found for women. Returning to school after <b>dropout</b> significantly reduces the crime-inducing effect of <b>dropout</b> among men. Finding occupation after <b>dropout</b> also reduces the risk for criminal conviction but does so independently of the effect of <b>dropout.</b> Conclusion: Since resource attainment after the <b>dropout</b> event modifies the effect on criminal convictions, it is concluded that policies such as lifelong learning strategies promoting opportunities for a “second chance” may, besides their intended consequences, also have crime preventive side effects...|$|R
