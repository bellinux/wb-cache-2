5|$|Like the UK as a whole, the Northern English {{economy is}} now {{dominated}} by the service sector – as of September 2016, 82.2% of workers in the Northern statistical regions were employed in services, compared to 83.7% for the UK as a whole. Manufacturing now employs 9.5%, compared to {{the national average of}} 7.6%. The unemployment rate in Northern England is 5.3% compared to an England-wide and UK-wide average of 4.8%, and the North East has the highest unemployment rate in the UK, at 7.0% as of December 2016, more than one percentage point higher than any other region. As of 2015, the gross value added (GVA) of the Northern English economy was £316 billion, and <b>if</b> <b>it</b> <b>were</b> <b>an</b> independent nation, it would be the tenth largest economy in Europe. The region does have poor growth and productivity rates compared to Southern England and to other EU countries.|$|E
5|$|To {{save money}} for the production, Bay reduced his usual fee by 30%. He planned an 83-day {{shooting}} schedule, maintaining the required pace by doing more camera set-ups per day than usual. Bay chose to shoot the film in the United States instead of Australia or Canada, allowing him {{to work with a}} crew he was familiar with, and who understood his work ethic. A pre-shoot took place on April 19, 2006 and principal photography began three days later at Holloman Air Force Base, which stood in for Qatar. To film the Scorponok sequence at White Sands Missile Range, a sweep was performed to remove unexploded ordnance before building of a village set could begin; ironically, the village would be blown up. The scene was broken down for the Air battle managers flying aboard the AWACS aircraft, who improvised dialogue as <b>if</b> <b>it</b> <b>were</b> <b>an</b> actual battle.|$|E

25|$|Wiener was {{an early}} studier of {{stochastic}} and mathematical noise processes, contributing work relevant to electronic engineering, electronic communication, and control systems. It was Wiener's idea to model a signal as <b>if</b> <b>it</b> <b>were</b> <b>an</b> exotic type of noise, giving it a sound mathematical basis. The example we give our students nowadays is that English text could be modeled as a random string of letters and spaces, where each letter of the alphabet (and the space) has an assigned probability. But Wiener dealt with analog signals, where such a simple example doesn't exist. Wiener is unlucky in that his early work on information theory and signal processing was limited to analog signals, and was largely forgotten {{with the development of}} the digital theory.|$|E
25|$|Type-III binary {{compounds}} are covalently bonded. Covalent bonding occurs between nonmetal elements. Covalently-bonded compounds {{are also}} known as molecules. In the compound, the first element is named first and with its full elemental name. The second element is named as <b>if</b> <b>it</b> <b>were</b> <b>an</b> anion (root name of the element + -ide suffix). Then, prefixes are used to indicate the numbers of each atom present: these prefixes are mono- (one), di- (two), tri- (three), tetra- (four), penta- (five), hexa- (six), hepta- (seven), octa- (eight), nona- (nine), and deca- (ten). The prefix mono- is never used with the first element. Thus, NCl3 is called nitrogen trichloride, P2O5 is called diphosphorus pentoxide (the a of the penta- prefix is dropped before the vowel for easier pronunciation), and BF3 is called boron trifluoride.|$|E

25|$|In November 1891, Grove Karl Gilbert, chief {{geologist}} for the U.S. Geological Survey, {{investigated the}} crater {{and concluded that}} it {{was the result of a}} volcanic steam explosion. Gilbert had assumed that <b>if</b> <b>it</b> <b>were</b> <b>an</b> impact crater then the volume of the crater, as well as meteoritic material, should be present on the rim. Gilbert also assumed a large portion of the meteorite should be buried in the crater and that this would generate a large magnetic anomaly. Gilbert's calculations showed that the volume of the crater and the debris on the rim were roughly equivalent, so that the mass of the hypothetical impactor was missing, nor were there any magnetic anomalies. Gilbert argued that the meteorite fragments found on the rim were coincidental. Gilbert publicized his conclusions in a series of lectures. In 1892, however, Gilbert would be among the first to propose that the Moon's craters were caused by impact rather than volcanism.|$|E
25|$|In {{some cases}} S2 is negative, {{indicating}} that the image is formed {{on the opposite side}} of the lens from where those rays are being considered. Since the diverging light rays emanating from the lens never come into focus, and those rays are not physically present at the point where they appear to form an image, this is called a virtual image. Unlike real images, a virtual image cannot be projected on a screen, but appears to an observer looking through the lens as if it were a real object at the location of that virtual image. Likewise, it appears to a subsequent lens as <b>if</b> <b>it</b> <b>were</b> <b>an</b> object at that location, so that second lens could again focus that light into a real image, S1 then being measured from the virtual image location behind the first lens to the second lens. This is exactly what the eye does when looking through a magnifying glass. The magnifying glass creates a (magnified) virtual image behind the magnifying glass, but those rays are then re-imaged by the lens of the eye to create a real image on the retina.|$|E

The {{final version of the}} Bat takes its design cues from the Harrier Jump Jet, Bell Boeing V-22 Osprey and the Boeing AH-64 Apache. Chris Corbould described the Bat's size and shape as presenting a major challenge for filming given Christopher Nolan's emphasis on practical effects over computer-generated imagery. In order to make the Bat [...] "fly", it was variously supported by wires, suspended from cranes and helicopters, and mounted on a purpose-built vehicle with hydraulic controls to simulate movement.|$|E
500|$|Following Simpson's divorce {{hearing on}} 27 October 1936, her solicitor, John Theodore Goddard, became {{concerned}} {{that there would}} be a [...] "patriotic" [...] citizen's intervention (a legal device to block the divorce), and that such an intervention would be successful. The courts could not grant a collaborative divorce (a dissolution of marriage consented to by both parties), and so the case was being handled as <b>if</b> <b>it</b> <b>were</b> <b>an</b> undefended at-fault divorce brought against Ernest Simpson, with Wallis Simpson as the innocent, injured party. The divorce action would fail if the citizen's intervention showed that the Simpsons had colluded by, for example, conniving in or staging the appearance of his adultery so that she could marry someone else. On Monday 7 December 1936, the King heard that Goddard planned to fly to the south of France to see Wallis Simpson. The King summoned him and expressly forbade him to make the journey, fearing that the visit might put doubts in Simpson's mind. Goddard went straight to Downing Street to see Baldwin, as a result of which he was provided with an aeroplane to take him directly to Cannes.|$|E

Jackson was expelled from the congregation, and subsequently convicted of libel and fined $100 (today $) for making the accusations, while Rosenberg sued the synagogue for his salary. Rosenberg died of pneumonia in April 1893, {{at the age of}} 43, his [...] "health and spirits", according to a contemporary New York Times report, [...] "broken" [...] by the expulsion.

500|$|Arguments for {{it being}} legally binding {{is based on}} several points. Firstly, the {{judiciary}} of the time were asked by Charles what standing they would give to the Petition were it passed; they concluded {{that it was a}} potentially legislative act. Charles's assent to the Petition was also made in Parliament, not in Whitehall, something normally done with statutes, and Henry Elsynge, the Clerk of the House of Commons, had the Petition placed on the statute rolls as <b>if</b> <b>it</b> <b>were</b> <b>an</b> Act of Parliament. It was later enforced by the courts; when Selden and other Members of Parliament were imprisoned, they cited the Petition as a reason to grant habeas corpus, something the judges accepted, and the ship money case, although a victory for Charles, was a victory in spite of the Petition rather than because of it; the judgment concluded that Charles's actions were acceptable under the Royal Prerogative, but would otherwise be in violation of the Petition. The final word remains elusive, since [...] "it seems impossible to establish conclusively which of these interpretations of the petition is correct. The Petition of Right of 1628 was a unique parliamentary act. It was interpreted differently by different people. And there are probably no absolute criteria by which its true nature can be determined".|$|E
500|$|The four-piece band {{struggled}} {{to come up}} with new material for an album, but in February 1968 recorded Wright's [...] "It Would Be So Nice" [...] and Waters' [...] "Julia Dream". In early February it was announced that the Waters-penned track, [...] "Corporal Clegg" [...] would be the band's next single, however, due to pressure from the label, the song was earmarked for the album, and [...] "It Would Be So Nice" [...] was released in April as a single, with [...] "Julia Dream" [...] on the B-side. Throughout April, the band was taking stock of the songs recorded up to that point. Waters blocked the release of the two tracks, [...] "Vegetable Man" [...] and [...] "Scream Thy Last Scream", on the album, though the band retained [...] "Jugband Blues", and the Waters-written [...] "Set the Controls for the Heart of the Sun" [...] on which Barrett played. With not enough material to fill the album's last 12 minutes, the band started piecing together several pieces of material that was to become the title track of the album, [...] "A Saucerful of Secrets". Mason and Waters planned the track out as <b>if</b> <b>it</b> <b>were</b> <b>an</b> architectural design, including peaks and troughs. Producer Smith didn't like the song, stating to them that they [...] "just can't do this, it's too long. You have to write three-minute songs."
