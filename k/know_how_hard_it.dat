500|$|In {{the early}} months of 1950 Chance of a Lifetime was {{released}} into British cinemas; it was a film in which Jacques [...] "really made her mark", according to her biographer, Andy Merriman. Chance of a Lifetime is a social and industrial relations drama based in a plough factory whose manager cedes control to the workforce. Jacques played Alice, a welder: when she was offered her fee for 17 days filming, she replied [...] "I've done this job welding Bailey and Pontoon Bridges and I <b>know</b> <b>how</b> <b>hard</b> <b>it</b> is. That's not enough money!" [...] and the offer was raised accordingly. The film critic Geoff Mayer considered that Jacques had [...] "the best scene in the film with her mock seductive dance in front of an angry [...] MacGinnis".|$|E

I am Jesus Christ. I'm back again." [...] The meeting was adjourned for lunch and Lennon never mentioned the subject again. In May 1969, Lennon and McCartney recorded [...] "The Ballad of John and Yoko", with Lennon singing the lines, [...] "Christ, you know it ain't easy, You <b>know</b> <b>how</b> <b>hard</b> <b>it</b> can be, The way things are going, They're gonna crucify me." [...] In a BBC interview a few months later, Lennon called himself [...] "One of Christ's biggest fans", talked about the Church of England, his vision of heaven, and unhappiness over being unable to marry Yoko Ono in church.|$|E

A linear system of congruences can be solved in polynomial time with a form of Gaussian elimination, for details see linear congruence theorem. [...] Algorithms, such as Montgomery reduction, also exist to allow simple arithmetic operations, such as multiplication and exponentiation modulonbsp&, to be performed efficiently on large numbers.|$|E

2500|$|The {{cartoonist}} visited John Lennon and Yoko Ono {{at their}} 1969 Bed-In for Peace in Montreal, and their testy exchange later {{appeared in the}} documentary film [...] (1988). Introducing himself with the words [...] "I'm a dreadful Neanderthal fascist. How do you do?," [...] Capp sardonically congratulated Lennon and Ono on their [...] nude album cover: [...] "I think that everybody owes {{it to the world}} to prove they have pubic hair. You've done it, and I tell you that I applaud you for it." [...] Following this exchange, Capp insulted Ono ("Good God, you've gotta live with that?"), and is asked to [...] "get out" [...] by Derek Taylor. Lennon allowed him to stay however, but the conversation had soured considerably. On Capp's exit, Lennon sang an impromptu version of his Ballad of John and Yoko song with a slightly revised, but nonetheless prophetic lyric: [...] "Christ, you know it ain't easy / You <b>know</b> <b>how</b> <b>hard</b> <b>it</b> can be / The way things are goin' / They're gonna crucify Capp!

In a 2013 interview, James explains that she saw an opportunity for social progress in a program that accurately represented men who are attracted to trans women. Typically, she says, in US media trans-attracted men are stigmatized and shamed, and that can make them hate themselves—and [...] "lead to unhealthy and even dangerous situations for trans women." [...] "No one <b>knows</b> <b>how</b> <b>hard</b> <b>it</b> {{is for us to}} date!" [...] Addams adds.

However, after Katy continues to push the idea, Chesney (Sam Aston) is expected to change his mind and begin looking for a flat that he can rent with his girlfriend. Discussing Fiz's reaction, a Coronation Street source said [...] "After just having a child herself she <b>knows</b> <b>how</b> <b>hard</b> <b>it</b> is.

As a result, he was still listed on the state's sex offender registry. Because of this status, Haynesworth had to wear an electronic ankle monitor, be subject to curfews, inform authorities {{in order to move}} from one home to another, and had to request permission to visit his young nieces. <b>Knowing</b> <b>how</b> <b>hard</b> <b>it</b> would be for Haynesworth to find a job until he was fully exonerated, Cuccinelli hired him to work as a clerk in his office. Haynesworth said Cuccinelli was [...] "an extraordinary guy" [...] and that as [...] "a total stranger he put it on the line for me." [...] Cuccinelli had also invited Haynesworth to his office, where the State Attorney General personally apologized to him for the miscarriage of justice in his case.|$|R

40|$|Anyone who {{has ever}} tried to {{construct}} modular, object oriented user interfaces using the Java and Swing, <b>knows</b> <b>how</b> <b>hard</b> <b>it</b> can be. The result can easily end up being difficult to debug, complex to understand and maintain, and certainly not reusable (except by cutting and pasting!). However, huge benefits {{can be obtained by}} separating out the user interface (i. e. GUI components) from the application logic/code. This has been acknowledge {{for a long time and}} a number of approaches have been proposed over the years for separating the presentational aspect of an application from the logic of that application. In the case of client Java applications, used in multi-tier environments this is still true. In this column and the next, we will explore the use of the model-view-controller architecture/pattern (or just as the MVC for short). The MVC originated in Smalltalk but the concept has been used in many places. This article considers what the MVC is, why it is a good approach to GUI client construction and what features in Java support it...|$|R

Dear Mr. Ruskin, England has done terribly ill, ignobly ill, which is worse. That men of all parties should have spoken as they have, proves a state of public morals lamentable to admit. What--not even our poets with clean hands? Alfred Tennyson abetting Lord Derby? That to me was the heaviest blow of all.|$|R

So high a respect had he for their valour, that he urged the king to pretend to retire suddenly beyond the camp, when the Scots, in spite of their leaders, would be sure to leave their ranks and flock into the camp to plunder, when they might be easily dispersed and cut to pieces. The king, however, refused to adopt the suggestion, saying, that no one must be able to accuse him of avoiding a battle or of withdrawing his army before such a rabble. As the armies stood confronting each other in battle array a priest passed along the Scottish front, crucifix in hand, exhorting all to fight to the death for the liberty of their country.

5000|$|Throughout his Juventus career, Ferrara {{played an}} {{important}} role in the club's backline, with his vast experienced and dominating defensive style. Throughout his 12-year tenure with the club, Ferrara formed impressive defensive partnerships with the likes of Mark Iuliano, Moreno Torricelli, Paolo Montero, Gianluca Pessotto, Lilian Thuram, Alessandro Birindelli, Igor Tudor, Gianluca Zambrotta, Nicola Legrottaglie and Fabio Cannavaro. Juventus had what was considered as the best defence in the world at this time, and teams strongly regretted ever going down a goal to the club, as they <b>knew</b> <b>how</b> <b>hard</b> <b>it</b> would be to score one back for themselves. In the 1996-97 season, one of his peak seasons, he scored 4 goals in 32 Serie A matches, while also being capped eight times internationally.Following the Scudetto-winning season, Ferrara, along with veteran defensive teammates Mark Iuliano and Paolo Montero, ended their Juventus careers. While Montero returned to Uruguay and Iuliano opted to join smaller clubs to conclude his career, Ferrara retired from football altogether in May 2005 at age 38. He made just four Serie A appearances in his final season with the club. Following Juventus' involvement in the 2006 Italian football scandal, [...] "Calciopoli", Juventus' 2004-05 title was later revoked.|$|R
