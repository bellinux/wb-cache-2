In this way, a business control model can be constructed similarly for a service based business as for a physical goods production business, having intangible goods instead of tangible.|$|E
40|$|Purpose of {{this paper}} The purpose {{of this paper}} is to explore the role and {{potential}} of packaging in order to obtain more sustainable <b>goods</b> <b>flows.</b> Design/methodology/approach An explorative research approach based on case survey methodology in which description, exploration and analysis of 34 reported cases are made. The empirical focus is <b>goods</b> <b>flows</b> in fast moving consumer goods (FMCG) supply chains. Findings The insights presented highlights and provides guidance on the pros and cons packaging provides for sustainable <b>goods</b> <b>flows</b> in the FMCG industry. Research limitations/implications (if applicable) Based on knowledge and insights about the <b>flows</b> of <b>goods</b> and tomorrows requirements on sustainable societies, this paper reports on insights for making the <b>goods</b> <b>flows</b> in the FMCG industry sustainable based on a packaging perspective. The research has focused on FMCG <b>goods</b> <b>flows,</b> starting with the inbound flow of packaging at the product filler and ending at the retail outlet. Practical implications (if applicable) The insights can guide organisations to consider and reflect on how and when packaging enables or hinder sustainability aspects of <b>goods</b> <b>flows.</b> Extra effort should be on designing packaging system solutions that mitigate the negative effects of non-consumed products. What is original/value of paper While several studies have reported on the sustainability impact of logistics, transportation or supply chain structures, the perspective of packaging is rarely treated, neither in theory nor in practise. With a packaging perspective, the assessment of <b>goods</b> <b>flows</b> in supply chains is integrative, since packaging is naturally built on the intersection of logistics, marketing, sales, ergonomics and environmental considerations...|$|R

They actually mean a change in direction of interregional trade flows respectively caused by the change of tariffs within and outside economic union. The dynamics of trade creation and diversion effects was mathematically described by R.T.Dalimov. The finding shows that trade flow (an output moving from region to region) may be described by Navier-Stoxes equation, with the <b>goods</b> <b>flow</b> caused by the price difference - quite similar to gas or liquid moving under pressure difference.|$|E

Purulia has excellent road connectivity with Raniganj-Asansol industrial belt. South Bengal State Transport Corporation runs 4 buses from Purulia to Kolkata via State Highway 5 thus connecting towns and cities like Raghunathpur, Adra, Neturia to the industrial belt of Asansol, Raniganj, Durgapur and Burdwan.

These should not conflict with reaching the production economics objectives {{of each of the}} units. Production structure is needed to reduce the complexity and should minimise the loss of potential flexibility. Any structure will have some elements in common — the definition of basic elements (e. g. capacities) as a first step in production control structure design; the introduction of product units and the decomposition of the total production control to <b>Goods</b> <b>Flow</b> Control and Production Unit Control; the relationship of sales and manufacturing and the interference of products and capacities as two main determining factors of the <b>Goods</b> <b>Flow</b> Control structure.

In automated production systems buffers are not always the result of local physical space restrictions, but may also be software- controlled. Software-controlled buffers allow a more efficient use of the production units and a better control of the work in progress. Some of these possible control principles are known from production control and <b>goods</b> <b>flow</b> theory. We present a model for production systems in which the <b>goods</b> <b>flow</b> is continuous. The effect of different control mechanisms on the performance of the system (that is throughput and throughput time) is studied.

40|$|Objective: Men with benign {{prostate}} hyperplasia (BPH) with <b>good</b> urinary <b>flow</b> {{may still}} have bladder outlet obstruction (BOO). Intravesical prostatic protrusion (IPP) {{has been shown to}} be able to predict BOO. We aim to investigate the use of IPP to predict BOO in men with <b>good</b> urinary <b>flow.</b> Methods: One hundred and fourteen consecutive men (> 50 years old) presenting with lower urinary tract symptoms suggestive of BPH were recruited in 2001 and 2002. They were evaluated with serum prostate specific antigen (PSA), uroflowmetry and transabdominal ultrasound measurement of IPP and prostate volume (PV). Pressure-flow urodynamic studies were performed on all men and BOO was defined by BOO index >  40. Men with Qmax ≥  12. 0  mL/s were considered to have <b>good</b> <b>flow.</b> Results: Among the 114 men, 61 patients had <b>good</b> urinary <b>flow.</b> Their median age, PV and Qmax were 66 years, 32. 9  mm 3 and 14. 5  mL/s respectively. 14 / 61 (23. 0 %) patients had BOO and their distribution of IPP were as follows: Grade 1 – 0 / 20 (0 %) obstructed, Grade 2 – 6 / 22 (27. 3 %) and Grade 3 – 8 / 19 (42. 1 %). Sensitivity of Grade 2 / 3 IPP for BOO was 100 % while specificity of Grade 3 IPP was 76. 6 %. The area-under-curve (AUC) for IPP was greater than that for PV (0. 757 vs. 0. 696). Conclusion: Even in men with <b>good</b> <b>flow,</b> high grades of IPP were more likely to have BOO and hence, may be a useful adjunct to predict BOO...|$|R
