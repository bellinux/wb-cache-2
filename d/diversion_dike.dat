40|$|Due to the {{impoundment}} of the Three Gorges Dam {{a decrease}} in sediment flow {{has been a major}} factor for erosion on the riverbed further downstream in the Yangtze River. This rapport studies the water flow conditions in the Nanjing reach. It also examines the effect of building a <b>diversion</b> <b>dike</b> {{at the head of the}} reach as a measure to redistribute some of the water flow to the northern branch. This branch suffers from a declining water flow, largely as a consequence from the erosion in the southern branch. By constructing a numerical model model with the software SMS, the current conditions of the reach were simulated. The simulated <b>diversion</b> <b>dike</b> having best effect on diverting water was able to improve the split ratio with 4. 3 percentage points. ...|$|E

In seismic {{response}} analysis, {{total stress}} {{method is adopted}} mostly, but variation of the pore water pressure and the development process of the liquefaction are not considered in this method. Based on the dynamic analysis of two-dimensional effective stress proposed by Zhu-jiang Shen, combined with dynamic consolidation theory of Biot, the foundation liquefaction analysis of the <b>diversion</b> <b>dike</b> for nuclear power plant is performed by using effective stress dynamic analysis program, the liquefied range is given, {{as well as the}} permanent deformation.

40|$|Abstract. Based on {{the data}} of water depth in Nanshatou Passage, and the flow spilt ratio of the North Channel and the South Channel, {{the reasons for the}} {{sediment}} deposition in the Deepwater Navigation Channel of the Changjiang Estuary are explored. The sediment deposition in the Deepwater Navigation Channel of the Changjiang Estuary is affected by multi-factors, among these factors; the influences of the development of the Nanshatou Passage are significant. The development of the Nanshatou Passage leads to the increase of the ebb flow discharge and the southern bank of the South Channel scoured, the scoured sediment is carried by the ebb flow to the northern bank of the South Channel, and is silted in the entrance reach of the North Passage, which decreases the ebb flow volume entering into the Deepwater Navigation Channel. On the other hand, the Coriolis force and V-shaped <b>diversion</b> <b>dike</b> {{at the head of the}} Deepwater Navigation Channel are also key factors on effect of the Deepwater Navigation Channel...|$|E

40|$|Abstract. The {{debris flow}} in Jiasikou gully {{was a typical}} gully debris flow, which was located in Li xian, Sichuan province, China. According to the basic {{characteristics}} of the valley and the debris flow, we analyzed the formation conditions of the debris flow in Jiasikou gully, including topography, water source and sediment source. And we calculated the main dynamic parameters, such as bulk density, flow rate, flow capacity, sediment flush-out and impulse power. Combining the features of above mentioned, we discussed the development trend of the debris flow, and put forward recommendation that blocking dam and <b>diversion</b> <b>dike</b> engineering should be carried out. In the alpine gorge area, crustal relative instability and crustal activity caused the collapse, landslide and debris flow widely.

50|$|An {{elaborate}} {{system of}} flood way defenses {{can be found}} in the Canadian province of Manitoba. The Red River flows northward from the United States, passing through the city of Winnipeg (where it meets the Assiniboine River) and into Lake Winnipeg. As is the case with all north-flowing rivers in the temperate zone of the Northern Hemisphere, snow melt in southern sections may cause river levels to rise before northern sections have had a chance to completely thaw. This can lead to devastating flooding, as occurred in Winnipeg during the spring of 1950. To protect the city from future floods, the Manitoba government undertook the construction of a massive system of <b>diversions,</b> <b>dikes,</b> and flood ways (including the Red River Floodway and the Portage Diversion). The system kept Winnipeg safe during the 1997 flood which devastated many communities upriver from Winnipeg, including Grand Forks, North Dakota and Ste. Agathe, Manitoba.|$|R
40|$|The Colorado River and {{its tributaries}} have {{undergone}} drastic alterations from their natural states over the past 125 years. These alterations include both physical change or elimination of aquatic habitats and the introductions of numerous non-native species, particularly fish. Ironically, several more species occur at most localities today than were historically present before these alterations. This situation complicates the use of biodiversity as a litmus test for monitoring trends of either the deterioration or the health of an aquatic ecosystem. An Altered Ecosystem Over its entire basin (Figure), the Colorado River has been changed from its natural state {{perhaps as much as}} any river system in the world. The demands for water and power in the arid West have drastically altered the system by impoundments, irrigation <b>diversions,</b> <b>diking,</b> channelization, pollutants, and destruction of bank habitats by cattle grazing and other practices. Some reaches, ranging from desert spring runs to main rivers, have been completely dewatered or, seasonally, their flows consist almost entirely of irrigation return laden with silt and chemical pollutants. The Gila River of Arizona, one of the Colorado's largest tributaries, has not Colorado flowed over its lower 400 km (248 mi) since the early 1900 's. These alterations and their effects on the fish fauna have been discussed by sever River Basin al authors (Miller 1961; Minckley and Deaco...|$|R
30|$|In {{the distant}} past, humans reacted to {{environmental}} changes passively—they migrated away from environments that became adverse or unsustainable. Nowadays, many societies {{are equipped with}} tools and resources to withstand {{the negative consequences of}} environment change, to some extent. Common approaches to addressing adverse environmental changes include irrigation, construction of dams and <b>dikes,</b> <b>diversion</b> of water streams, large-scale geo-engineering projects (e.g., reforestation), mandatory ecological standards to curb pollution, more effective agronomic practices and robust crops, new construction codes, and the application of ecological expertise to each new large development.|$|R
40|$|This paper {{summarizes}} {{a four-year}} study that examined the key {{role of the}} regulated hydrogeomorphic regime on {{some aspects of the}} floodplain forest ecology in the Middle Ebro River (NE Spain), including landscape and patch structure, regeneration, litter production and nutrient use by dominant riparian trees. Such an integrative work is aimed at guiding management and restoration plans in the Ebro and other large Mediterranean rivers similarly constrained by regulation. The results demonstrated how decades of regulation by dams, <b>diversions</b> and <b>dikes</b> have caused a generalized senescence in the floodplain forest of the study area that might even alter its species composition in the near future. The high dependence of floodplain forest ecology on the hydrogeomorphic regime was also showed by a P limitation in the floodplain, mediated by sedimentation processes, which controlled litter production and nutrient resorption proficiency in the dominant tree genus Populus and Tamarix. To protect the ecological integrity of the Ebro floodplain forests and analog river ecosystems in the Mediterranean region, management and restoration measures that succeed in reactivating a certain degree of hydrogeomorphic dynamism should be implemented.

50|$|Arizona's {{last major}} drought {{occurred}} during Dust Bowl years of 1933-34. This time Washington stepped {{in as the}} Agricultural Adjustment Administration spent $100 million to buy up the starving cattle. The Taylor Grazing Act placed federal and state agencies in control of livestock numbers on public lands. Most {{of the land in}} Arizona is owned by the federal government which leased grazing land to ranchers at low cost. Ranchers invested heavily in blooded stock and equipment. James Wilson states that after 1950, higher fees and restrictions in the name of land conservation caused a sizable reduction in available grazing land. The ranchers had installed three-fifths of the fences, <b>dikes,</b> <b>diversion</b> dams, cattleguards, and other improvements, but the new rules reduced the value of that investment. In the end, Wilson believes, sportsmen and environmentalists maintained a political advantage by denouncing the ranchers as political corrupted land-grabbers who exploited the publicly owned natural resources.|$|R
40|$|A {{recent study}} {{reported}} considerable sediment trapping by three large channel bars downstream 18 – 28  km of the Mississippi–Atchafalaya River diversion (commonly {{known as the}} Old River Control Structure, ORCS) during the 2011 Mississippi River flood. In this study, we analyzed 3 -decadal morphological changes of the 10 -km river channel and the three bars to elucidate {{the long-term effects of}} river engineering including <b>diversion,</b> revetment and <b>dike</b> constructions. Satellite images captured between 1985 and 2015 in approximate 5 -year intervals were selected to estimate the change of channel morphology and bar surface area. The images were chosen based on river stage heights at the time when they were captured to exclude the temporal water height effect on channel and bar morphology. Using a set of the satellite images captured during the period of 1984 – 1986 and of 2013 – 2014, we developed rating curves of emerged bar surface area with the corresponding river stage height for determining the change in bar volume from 1985 to 2013. Two of the three bars have grown substantially in the past 30 years, while one bar has become braided and its surface area has shrunken. As a whole, there were a net gain of 4, 107, 000  m 2 in surface area and a net gain of 30, 271, 000  m 3 in volume, an equivalent of approximately 36 million metric tons of sediment assuming a bulk density of 1. 2  t/m 3. Sediment trapping on the bars was prevalent during the spring floods, especially during the period of 1990 – 1995 and of 2007 – 2011 when large floods occurred. The results suggest that although revetments and dikes have largely changed the morphology of the channel and the bars, they seem to have a limited impact on the overwhelming trend of sediment deposition caused by the river diversion...|$|R
