40|$|The {{interaction}} between a quantum <b>system,</b> called a <b>central</b> <b>system</b> in what follows, and its environment affects {{the state of}} the former. Intuitively, we expect that by turning on the interaction with the environment, the fluctuations in the environment will lead to a reduc-tion of the coherence in the <b>central</b> <b>system.</b> This process is called decoherence [1, 2]. In general, there are two different mechanisms that contribute to decoherence. If the environment is dissipative (or coupled to a dissipa-tive system), the total energy is not conserved and the <b>central</b> <b>system</b> + environment relax to a stationary equi-librium state, for instance the thermal equilibrium state. In this paper, we exclude this class of dissipative pro-cesses and restrict ourselves to closed quantum systems in which a small, <b>central</b> <b>system</b> is brought in contact with a larger quantum system that is prepared in its ground state. Then, the decoherence is solely due to fact that the initial product state (the wave function of the <b>central</b> <b>system</b> times the wave function of the environ-ment) evolves into an entangled state of the whole sys-tem. The interaction with the environment causes the initial pure state of the <b>central</b> <b>system</b> to evolve into a mixed state described by a reduced density matrix [3] obtained by tracing out all the degrees of freedom of the environment [1, 2, 4, 5]. Not all initial states are equally sensitive to decoher-ence. The states that are robust with respect to the inter-action with the environment are called pointer states [2].

40|$|We {{consider}} a <b>central</b> <b>system</b> which is coupled via dephasing {{to an open}} system, i. e. an intermediate system {{which in turn is}} coupled to another environment. Considering intermediate and far environment as one composite system, the coherences in the <b>central</b> <b>system</b> are given in the form of fidelity amplitudes for a certain perturbed echo dynamics in the composite environment. On the basis of the Born-Markov approximation, we derive a master equation for the reduction of that dynamics to the intermediate system alone. In distinction to an earlier paper [arXiv: 1502. 04143 (2015) ] where we discussed the stabilizing effect of the far environment on the decoherence in the <b>central</b> <b>system,</b> we focus here on the possibility to use the measurable coherences in the <b>central</b> <b>system</b> for probing the open quantum dynamics in the intermediate system. We illustrate our results for the case of chaotic dynamics in the near environment, where we compare random matrix simulations with our analytical result. Comment: 15 pages, 2 figure...|$|R

Moreover, we have implemented a temperature-dependent thermal conductivity (appropriate for olivine) for the lithospheric mantle to improve the calculations of temperature profiles in the mantle.

We have obtained surface heat flow values of 84 mW m− 2 and ∼ 82 mW m− 2 for the Spanish <b>Central</b> <b>System</b> and the Tajo Basin, respectively.
