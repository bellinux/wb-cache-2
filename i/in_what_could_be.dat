25|$|If the {{cannonball}} {{is fired}} with sufficient speed, the ground curves {{away from the}} ball {{at least as much}} as the ball falls – so the ball never strikes the ground. It is now <b>in</b> <b>what</b> <b>could</b> <b>be</b> called a non-interrupted, or circumnavigating, orbit. For any specific combination of height above the center of gravity and mass of the planet, there is one specific firing speed (unaffected by the mass of the ball, which is assumed to be very small relative to the Earth's mass) that produces a circular orbit, as shown in (C).|$|E
25|$|Visual {{extinction}} {{has also}} been used to demonstrate brain bias towards gestalt processing. When presented with a figure containing illusory contours, patients were able to correctly report the presence of stimuli in both contralesional and ipsilesional hemispheres, due to their unconscious processing of the whole field to produce the illusion. This experiment implied that the attention center prioritizes the visualization of surfaces over other stimuli – therefore, although under race model the ipsilesional stimuli should extinguish the contralesional, {{the creation of the}} gestalt takes priority over detection of both. Further, a study using Gabor signals (alternating blurred and noisy black and white bars, commonly used by opticians in diagnostic tests) investigated how the orientation of these signals affected their extinction rate. Bilateral stimuli were least extinguished when both stimuli were oriented horizontally, although both stimuli being oriented vertically also showed a reduction in extinguishing rate when compared to one stimulus vertical and one horizontal – <b>in</b> <b>what</b> <b>could</b> <b>be</b> assumed by the brain to represent two different surfaces.|$|E

[...] Although Austin was also frustrated at the lack of progress, he disapproved of this drastic proposal. [...] In an attempt to quell the more radical groups in Texas, in October Austin {{sent a letter to the}} ayuntamiento in San Antonio de Béxar in which he proposed that all of the ayuntamientos should jointly form a new state government. <b>In</b> <b>what</b> <b>could</b> <b>be</b> interpreted as an inflammatory gesture, Austin signed his letter [...] "dios y Tejas" [...] ("God and Texas") rather than the traditional Mexican closing [...] "dios y libertad" [...] ("God and liberty").

2500|$|An audio {{recording}} version of McLuhan's famous work {{was made by}} Columbia Records.

'The Diocese of Cleveland is awaiting official word from the Vatican concerning any decrees.

Even when the documents are received, a response from the diocese {{is not likely to}} come quickly because they will first need to be translated into English from Latin, the official language of the Church.
