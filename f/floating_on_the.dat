5|$|Females perform all {{tasks of}} feeding and raising offspring, and have {{occasionally}} been observed caring for orphaned pups. Much {{has been written}} about the level of devotion of sea otter mothers for their pups– a mother gives her infant almost constant attention, cradling it on her chest away from the cold water and attentively grooming its fur. When foraging, she leaves her pup <b>floating</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> water, sometimes wrapped in kelp to keep it from floating away; if the pup is not sleeping, it cries loudly until she returns. Mothers have been known to carry their pups for days after the pups' deaths.|$|E
5|$|The {{unprecedented}} rainfall {{turned the}} Chena River into a torrent. On August 14, it passed flood stage {{and continued to}} rise. Because no hydrological equipment had been installed upstream of Fairbanks, residents were unaware of the flood's scale. All day and night on August 14, the water rose. It inundated the A-67 site and volunteers allowed water to fill the hold of the SS Nenana {{to keep it from}} <b>floating</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> rising waters and damaging buildings. In downtown Fairbanks, hundreds of volunteers built a sandbag dike around St. Joseph's Hospital to no avail. As the water crested the emergency dike, doctors, nurses, and patients evacuated to the University of Alaska on College Hill.|$|E
5|$|In Abzû, {{the player}} {{takes on the}} role of a diver in a vast ocean—after waking up <b>floating</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> ocean's surface, the diver begins {{exploring}} the surrounding underwater environments filled with plant and animal life, in addition to uncovering ancient technology and submerged ruins. In a few areas, the diver is also able to explore land-based environments above the water. As the game progresses, the diver unlocks new areas and pursues the secrets behind the forces harming the local environment. The diver's course through the game follows a linear path through interconnected areas filled with marine life. The player directs the diver through the environments using full analogue control, able to interact with the environment to solve switch or item-based puzzles, and sit on pedestals within each area to observe the surrounding sea life. The diver can accelerate, and interact with marine life using sonar chimes. The diver can grab onto the bodies of larger marine animals and ride on them. Each area sports hidden collectables for the diver to find.|$|E

25|$|A {{floating}} toilet {{is essentially}} a toilet on a platform built above or <b>floating</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> water. Instead of excreta going into the ground they are collected in a tank or barrel. To {{reduce the amount of}} excreta that needs to hauled to shore, many use urine diversion. The floating toilet was developed for residents without quick access to land or connection to a sewer systems. It is also used in areas subjected to prolonged flooding. The need for this type of toilet is high in areas like Cambodia.|$|E
25|$|Mobile oceanic {{species such}} as tuna can be {{captured}} by travelling long distances in large fishing vessels. A simpler alternative is to leverage off the fascination fish have with floating objects. When fishermen use such objects, they are called fish aggregating devices (FADs). FADs are anchored rafts or objects of any type, <b>floating</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> surface or just below it. Fishermen in the Pacific and Indian oceans set up floating FADs, assembled from all sorts of debris, around tropical islands, and then use purse seines to capture the fish attracted to them.|$|E
25|$|Shamanism {{has had a}} {{historically}} important influence on the mythologies of Siberian peoples, including the Finnic, Ugric, Yeniseian, Turkic, Mongolic, Tungusic, and other northern Eurasia and Central Asian peoples. A central concept in their cosmologies is the myth {{that the world was}} created from an egg. There are also myths about the Milky Way, ideas about the existence of the World tree or pillar, and the idea that asterisms represent animal spirits. A myth about a bird <b>floating</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> primary ocean that dives for the ground is a central Uralic cosmogonic myth.|$|E

25|$|With all {{survivors}} <b>floating</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> {{water with}} no life vests, co-pilot Carlton suddenly {{noticed that a}} Mrs Thorburn was hanging on to a raft still in its case. Fearing the bright yellow rubber raft might {{attract the attention of}} PLAAF fighters, it took Carlton twenty minutes to finally inflate the rubber dinghy and lift all nine passengers in. Once all were on the dinghy, concern remained that the attacking planes might return; some of the dazed, injured passengers, with their clothes in shreds, hid under a plastic sunshade covering the edges of the dinghy. Although Blown and passenger Peter Thacher kept watch, the attacking planes never returned.|$|E
25|$|In {{the early}} 1930s, she hired William Lawrence Bottomley {{to create a}} unique {{addition}} known as the Finger Bowl, an outdoor dining area consisting of a raised pool surrounded by a flat ledge. Chairs were {{pulled up to the}} ledge and food was served from bowls <b>floating</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> water. It was sheltered by a wisteria-covered arbor supported by 12 stone piers. In the late 1930s, Gifford Pinchot started the White Pine Plantation to reforest some old farmland near the mansion. He was particularly interested in that species since it was the dominant tree in the forests of Pike County and had been heavily harvested during the previous century.|$|E
25|$|Aerated lagoons are a low {{technology}} suspended-growth {{method of}} secondary treatment using motor-driven aerators <b>floating</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> water surface to increase atmospheric oxygen {{transfer to the}} lagoon and to mix the lagoon contents. The floating surface aerators are typically rated to deliver the amount of air equivalent to 1.8 to 2.7kg O2/kW·h. Aerated lagoons provide less effective mixing than conventional activated sludge systems and do not achieve the same performance level. The basins may range in depth from 1.5 to 5.0 metres. Surface-aerated basins achieve 80 to 90 percent removal of BOD with retention times of 1 to 10 days. Many small municipal sewage systems in the United States (1 million gal./day or less) use aerated lagoons.|$|E

However, he discovers that her home has been destroyed (ll. 57–60), and falls into a crazed delirium and breaks into laughter (ll. 61–65). For a year, he roams the street as a madman (ll. 89–130), but the following autumn, he is reminded of {{the night of the}} storm (ll. 132–133) and the source of his troubles. In a fit of rage, he curses the statue of Peter (ll. 177–179), which brings the statue to life, and Peter begins pursuing Evgenii (ll. 180–196). The narrator does not describe Evgenii's death directly, but the poem closes with the discovery of his corpse in a ruined hut <b>floating</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> water (ll. 219–222).|$|E
25|$|The canals of Lake Xochimilco were {{initially}} created along with artificial agricultural plots called chinampas. Chinampas were invented by the pre-Hispanic {{peoples of the}} region around 1,000 year ago {{as a way to}} increase agricultural production. On the shallow waters of the lakes, rafts were constructed of juniper branches. Onto these rafts <b>floating</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> water, lakebed mud and soil were heaped and crops planted. These rafts, tied to juniper trees, would eventually sink and a new one be built to replace it. Over time, these sunken rafts would form square or rectangular islands, held in place in part by the juniper trees. As these chinampa islands propagated, areas of the lake were reduced to canals. These “floating gardens” were {{an important part of the}} economy of the Aztec Empire by the time the Spanish arrived.|$|E
25|$|In {{broadest}} terms, flies are {{categorized as}} either imitative or attractive. Imitative flies resemble natural food items. Attractive flies trigger instinctive strikes by employing {{a range of}} characteristics that do not necessarily mimic prey items. Flies can be fished <b>floating</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> surface (dry flies), partially submerged (emergers), or below the surface (nymphs, streamers, and wet flies). A dry fly is typically thought to represent an insect landing on, falling on (terrestrials), or emerging from, the water's surface as might a grasshopper, dragonfly, mayfly, ant, beetle, stonefly or caddisfly. Other surface flies include poppers and hair bugs that might resemble mice, frogs, etc. Sub-surface flies are designed to resemble {{a wide variety of}} prey including aquatic insect larvae, nymphs and pupae, baitfish, crayfish, leeches, worms, etc. Wet flies, known as streamers, are generally thought to imitate minnows, leeches or scuds.|$|E
