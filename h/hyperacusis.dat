25|$|An {{assessment}} of <b>hyperacusis,</b> a frequent accompaniment of tinnitus, {{may also be}} made. The measured parameter is Loudness Discomfort Level (LDL) in dB, the subjective level of acute discomfort at specified frequencies over the frequency range of hearing. This defines a dynamic range between the hearing threshold at that frequency and the loudnes discomfort level. A compressed dynamic range over a particular frequency range is associated with subjectve <b>hyperacusis.</b> Normal hearing threshold is generally defined as 020 decibels (dB). Normal loudness discomfort levels are 8590+ dB, with some authorities citing 100dB. A dynamic range of 55dB or less is indicative of <b>hyperacusis.</b>|$|E
25|$|In {{many people}} with <b>hyperacusis,</b> an {{increased}} activity develops in the tensor tympani muscle in the middle ear {{as part of the}} startle response to some sounds. This lowered reflex threshold for tensor tympani contraction is activated by the perception/anticipation of loud sound, and is called tonic tensor tympani syndrome (TTTS). In some people with <b>hyperacusis,</b> the tensor tympani muscle can contract just by thinking about a loud sound. Following exposure to intolerable sounds, this contraction of the tensor tympani muscle tightens the ear drum, which can lead to the symptoms of ear pain/a fluttering sensation/a sensation of fullness in the ear (in the absence of any middle or inner ear pathology).|$|E
500|$|Lenin {{was seriously}} ill {{by the latter}} half of 1921, {{suffering}} from <b>hyperacusis,</b> insomnia, and regular headaches. At the Politburo's insistence, in July he left Moscow for a month's leave at his Gorki mansion, where he was cared for by his wife and sister. [...] Lenin began to contemplate the possibility of suicide, asking both Krupskaya and Stalin to acquire potassium cyanide for him. Twenty-six physicians were hired to help Lenin during his final years; many of them were foreign and had been hired at great expense. Some suggested that his sickness could have been caused by metal oxidation from the bullets that were lodged in his body from the 1918 assassination attempt; in April 1922 he underwent a surgical operation to remove them. The symptoms continued after this, with Lenin's doctors unsure of the cause; some suggested that he was suffering from neurasthenia or cerebral arteriosclerosis; others believed that he had syphilis, an idea endorsed in a 2004 report by a team of neuroscientists, who suggested that this was later deliberately concealed by the government. In May 1922, he suffered his first stroke, temporarily losing his ability to speak and being paralysed on his right side. He convalesced at Gorki, and had largely recovered by July. In October he returned to Moscow; in December he suffered a second stroke and returned to Gorki.|$|E
2500|$|SCDS-related autophony differs {{greatly in}} quality and {{range from the}} more common form which results from an open, or patulous Eustachian tube through which sufferers of this {{disorder}} {{hear the sound of}} their own voice and breathing. In contrast, patients with SCDS-related autophony report hearing their own voice as a disturbingly loud and distorted [...] "kazoo-like" [...] sound deep inside the head as if relayed through [...] "a cracked loudspeaker." [...] Additionally they may hear the creaking and cracking of joints, the sound of their footsteps when walking or running, their heartbeat and the sound of chewing and other digestive noises. Some sufferers of this condition experience such a high level of conductive <b>hyperacusis</b> that a tuning fork placed on the ankle will be heard in the affected ear. The bizarre phenomenon of being able to hear the sound of the eyeballs moving in their sockets (e.g. when reading in a quiet room) [...] "like sandpaper on wood" [...] {{is one of the more}} distinctive features of this condition and is almost exclusively associated with SCDS.|$|E
50|$|<b>Hyperacusis,</b> {{means an}} over-sensitivity or {{intolerance}} for typically encountered everyday sounds. Sometimes {{the effects of}} <b>hyperacusis</b> can affect the vestibular system and cause problems of balance. This is termed vestibular <b>hyperacusis</b> and is equally disabling. Dr. Marsha Johnson, an audiologist in Oregon, {{was the first to}} widely publicize vestibular <b>hyperacusis</b> in her many articles. On October 25, 2010, the audiologist Dr. Teddy Caramoan Cheng presented a selected number of studies relating to Vestibular <b>Hyperacusis</b> at the UK's first <b>Hyperacusis</b> Seminar held at the Royal Surrey County Hospital, Audiology Department. The Vestibular <b>Hyperacusis</b> presentation explored the anatomical, physiological, neurotological, audiological, ototoxicity-related, vestibulopathic, and presbyacusic evidence towards creating a Vestibular <b>hyperacusis</b> model.|$|E
5000|$|In <b>hyperacusis,</b> the {{symptoms}} are ear pain, annoyance, and general intolerance to many sounds {{that most people are}} unaffected by. Crying spells or panic attacks may result from the experience of <b>hyperacusis.</b> <b>Hyperacusis</b> may affect either or both ears. [...] As many as 86% of people with <b>hyperacusis</b> also have tinnitus. <b>Hyperacusis</b> can result in anxiety, stress and phonophobia. Avoidant behaviour is often a response to prevent the effects of <b>hyperacusis</b> and this can include avoiding social situations.|$|E

50|$|Vestibular <b>hyperacusis</b> is {{a mix-up}} between the brain's {{maintenance}} of upright balance {{and the sense}} of hearing. Instead of perceiving sounds as intolerable, the brain perceives them as movement sensations, disturbance to postural balance and/or visual focus (fixation). It is different from cochlear <b>hyperacusis</b> in that many people with vestibular <b>hyperacusis</b> can handle normal sounds just fine, but certain pitches and sounds that have higher than 85 decibels may trigger these sensations. People who have vestibular <b>hyperacusis</b> rarely have tinnitus co-morbidly, while as many as 86% of all CH sufferers have tinnitus.|$|E
50|$|The {{most common}} {{treatment}} for <b>hyperacusis</b> is retraining therapy which uses broadband noise. Tinnitus retraining therapy, a treatment originally {{used to treat}} tinnitus, uses broadband noise to treat <b>hyperacusis.</b> Pink noise {{can also be used}} to treat <b>hyperacusis.</b> By listening to broadband noise at soft levels for a disciplined period of time each day, patients can rebuild (i.e., re-establish) their tolerances to sound. When seeking treatment, it is important that the physician determine the patient's Loudness Discomfort Levels (LDL) so that hearing tests can be adjusted accordingly (brainstem auditory evoke response). If people have access to medical care, steroids are used to treat <b>hyperacusis</b> within 72 hours of the onset of the condition.|$|E
50|$|Sometimes <b>hyperacusis</b> {{can affect}} the {{vestibular}} system giving problems of balance, and this {{is referred to as}} vestibular <b>hyperacusis.</b> Vestibular <b>hyperacusis,</b> can also involve feelings of dizziness, nausea, or a loss of balance when sounds of certain pitches are present. For instance, people with vestibular <b>hyperacusis</b> may feel like they are falling and as a result involuntarily grimace and clutch for something to brace themselves with. The degree to which a person is affected depends on not only the overall severity of the symptoms but also whether the person can detect sounds in that frequency range at the volume in question, {{as well as on the}} person's preexisting muscle tone and severity of startle response.|$|E
50|$|It can be {{acquired}} {{as a result}} of damage sustained to the hearing apparatus, or inner ear. There is speculation that the efferent portion of the auditory nerve (olivocochlear bundle) has been affected (efferent meaning fibers that originate in the brain which serve to regulate hearing). This theory suggests that the efferent fibers of the auditory nerve are selectively damaged, while the hair cells that allow the hearing of pure tones in an audiometric evaluation remain intact. In cases not involving aural trauma to the inner ear, <b>hyperacusis</b> can also {{be acquired}} {{as a result of}} damage to the brain or the neurological system. In these cases, <b>hyperacusis</b> can be defined as a cerebral processing problem specific to how the brain perceives sound. In rare cases, <b>hyperacusis</b> may be caused by a vestibular disorder. This type of <b>hyperacusis,</b> called vestibular <b>hyperacusis,</b> is caused by the brain perceiving certain sounds as motion input as well as auditory input.|$|E

50|$|<b>Hyperacusis</b> (or hyperacousis) is a {{debilitating}} hearing disorder {{characterized by an}} increased sensitivity to certain frequency and volume ranges of sound (a collapsed tolerance to usual environmental sound). A person with severe <b>hyperacusis</b> has difficulty tolerating everyday sounds, {{some of which may}} seem unpleasantly or painfully loud to that person but not to others.|$|E
50|$|Where SCDS is {{confirmed}} {{in a comprehensive}} CT-scan, surgery may be offered to correct the dehiscence. Many cases of vestibular <b>hyperacusis</b> have the diagnosis of an unknown cause (i.e. idiopathic). Thus, most therapies that specifically target vestibular <b>hyperacusis</b> involve vestibular therapy, as with any vestibular disorder. An occupational therapist usually performs this type of therapy.|$|E
5000|$|While {{symptoms}} of cochlear <b>hyperacusis</b> range from ear discomfort at normal sounds to panic reactions at soft sound, {{symptoms of}} vestibular <b>hyperacusis</b> are generally linked to balance {{and feelings of}} movement. Someone suffering from vestibular <b>hyperacusis</b> may feel dizzy, sick to their stomach, or confused when {{in the presence of}} loud noises. Fatigue, anxiety, confusion, and even loss of consciousness are also common. Headaches, feelings of pressure in the ear or clutching for something to hold onto in a noisy environment is not unusual. Around 1998, the exploration of CT-Scan images in vestibular <b>hyperacusis</b> patients led to discovery of a rare condition called, [...] "Superior Semi-Circular Canal Dehiscence Syndrome" [...] or SCDS. Clinically, a tell-tale sign of SCDS is either having Tullio's Phenomenon, i.e. sound causing a spinning sensation or abnormal eye movements called nystagmus, or Hennebert's sign (nystagmus following applied pressure into the external auditory canal) ...|$|E

50|$|The {{most common}} cause of <b>hyperacusis</b> is {{overexposure}} to excessively high decibel levels (or sound pressure levels). Some come down with <b>hyperacusis</b> suddenly as a result of acoustic shock as by firing a gun, having an airbag deploy in their car, experiencing any extremely loud sound, taking ear sensitizing drugs, Lyme disease, Ménière's disease, temporomandibular joint disorder, head injury, or surgery. Others are born with sound sensitivity, develop Superior Canal Dehiscence Syndrome, have had a history of ear infections, or come from a family that has had hearing problems.

50|$|Paralysis of the stapedius allows wider {{oscillation}} of the stapes, {{resulting in}} heightened {{reaction of the}} auditory ossicles to sound vibration. This condition, known as <b>hyperacusis,</b> causes normal sounds {{to be perceived as}} very loud. Paralysis of the stapedius muscle may result when the nerve to the stapedius, a branch of the facial nerve, is damaged, or when the facial nerve itself is damaged before the nerve to stapedius branches. In cases of Bell's palsy, a unilateral paralysis of the facial nerve, the stapedius is paralyzed and <b>hyperacusis</b> may result.|$|E
50|$|A {{person with}} <b>hyperacusis</b> might be startled by very low sound levels.
