2500|$|This, however, {{proved to}} be the start of a series of {{disastrous}} miscalculations by Honecker. There were rowdy scenes across East Germany as furious East Germans who had paid in advance for their plane or train tickets and accommodation found that they could not travel and that their hard-earned money had been lost. The 14,000East German refugees camping in the grounds of the West German embassy in Prague had to be dealt with; Honecker sought to humiliate them publicly by expelling them through East Germany to the West, shipping them in eight sealed trains from Prague and stripping them of their East German citizenship while branding them as [...] "traitors". The Party justified the evacuation of the refugees as a humanitarian action taken because children were involved, who had been [...] "let down by the <b>irresponsible</b> <b>actions</b> of their parents." [...] The state newspaper Neues Deutschland ran an editorial, said to have been dictated by Honecker personally, which declared that [...] "by their behaviour they have trampled on all moral values and excluded themselves from our society." [...] Far from discrediting the refugees, the trains produced uproar, with citizens waving and cheering the refugees as they passed through the East German countryside. Torn-up identity papers and East German passports littered the tracks as the refugees threw them out of the windows. When the trains arrived in Dresden, 1,500East Germans stormed the main railway station in an attempt to board the trains. Dozens were injured and the station concourse was virtually destroyed.|$|E

40|$|In this dissertation, I defend Kantian {{ethics in}} terms of the universalizability of moral duties as moral laws against {{relativistic}} ethics like traditionalism and communitarianism. The problem I deal with, in special reference to Kant, is whether our actions are or should be judged by local moral determinants like individuality, community, religion or society, or by universal determinants of Kantian spirit. Those who follow local moral determinants, criticize Kantian universalizability. But I consider universality to be a strong moral determinant and therefore I defend it, and Kant. My argument, which I develop comprehensively in this dissertation, is twofold: Firstly, local determinants are based on historicism and therefore limited in scope; they leave room for partiality and discrimination among individuals. They are also dually-standardized – one for the first person (I use the term agent) and another for the second and third agents, all of whom differ from each other. Secondly, local determinants considered to be moral criteria are challenging to justify: Their projection of what a person is is not the only or real picture of a person as a moral agent. In other words, local determinants don't affect––or their proponents like MacIntyre and Taylor overlook––our deep sense of moral orientation, which deems every human being as the same. Our deep sense of morality has a need for a common standard of morality. With these arguments, I claim that the Kantian model of morality, in contrast, presents a real picture of a person and his sense of morality, though it is quite hard to find a person in the real world who acts in accordance with this moral sense. But our failure in following our deep moral sense does not mean that morality is a matter of individual choice or is merely locally-determined. The universal moral law is, after all, supreme and something to be achieved in the realization of what we are as moral and autonomous beings. The concept of local moral determinants is in fact weak in the sense that one can justify a wrong and <b>irresponsible</b> <b>action</b> as a right action, whereas, universal determinants prohibit us from following such a justification of a wrong action as right. In brief, this dissertation aims to critically evaluate the two kinds of determinants and their link to our practical life from a moral point of view. Another crucial dimension does remain in the debate at hand––the epistemic dimension––but due to the specificity of the project shall remain untouched in this dissertation...|$|R

40|$|This {{thesis is}} a {{normative}} {{analysis of the}} invasion of Iraq in March 2003 (codenamed Operation Iraqi Freedom). It examines whether Operation Iraqi Freedom {{could be described as}} a responsible action by the United States, acting as a great power. The normative perspective and its attendant framework are based on the theoretical approach propounded by the English School of International Relations. The basis of this non-native framework is rooted in the pluralist conception of the English School. The pluralist wing of the English School emphasises the importance of international order and declares that the great powers have a responsibility to protect this order. The threat posed to international order by Iraqi weapons of mass destruction was cited by the Administration of US President George W Bush as the main reason for invading Iraq. The action makes the pluralist conception a logical starting point from which to analyse this act. Therefore, the normative framework of this thesis states that, although a great power has a responsibility to act in order to counter a threat to international order, it has an obligation to act according to certain norms. The normative framework established in this thesis points to three obligations of great powers, relating to the norms of legality, legitimacy and prudence. Addressing the issue of legality is the first step this thesis takes towards assessing Operation Iraqi Freedom as a responsible action. From this perspective, the thesis argues that {{it is not possible to}} define the American-led invasion of Iraq as a legal act. However, in a situation in which a great power may not be able to act according to legal norms, given a consensus regarding an overwhelming threat to international order, this power would have a moral responsibility to act. Such an action may not fall within the commonly accepted norms of law but the presence of consensus would give legitimacy to this great power's actions. Hence, examining Operation Iraqi Freedom from the viewpoint of legitimacy emerges as the second step by which this thesis evaluates it as a responsible action. The analysis from this perspective reveals that, through the perspective of legitimacy, it is not possible to declare the American invasion of Iraq as a responsible action by a great power. Though a great power has a responsibility to act legally and legitimately, in the case of a clear threat to international order, this power may not think it in the common interest to wait for legal and diplomatic processes to take their course. In such a situation, a great power may choose to act - but under the obligation to act prudently. The third step employed by this thesis is thus to analyse and discuss whether Operation Iraqi Freedom could be described as a prudent action. The examination of the invasion from this perspective determines that it is not possible to class the American invasion of Iraq as a responsible action according to the principles of prudence. Hence this thesis affirms that Operation Iraqi Freedom could not be described as a responsible action according to the normative criteria outlined above. In the run-up to the invasion and in its initiation, the United States did not fulfil the three obligations (relating to legality, legitimacy and prudence) necessary for a great power to fulfil while combating a threat to international order. Thus, seen from the pluralist perspective of the English School, this thesis argues that Operation Iraqi Freedom was an <b>irresponsible</b> <b>action</b> by the US acting as a great power.

40|$|Purpose – Building on {{the work}} of Carroll this article {{attempts}} to unravel, explore and explain corporate social responsibility (CSR) as a theoretical construct that has implications and consequences for corporate governance in particular, and more generally for the economy, business and society. It aims to extend Carroll's work on definitional constructs by re-examining some of the theoretical frameworks that underpin, inform and guide CSR. Design/methodology/approach – Carroll identified different levels, or a pyramid, of CSR and these are outlined and {{the advantages and disadvantages of}} a pyramid, levels-based approach discussed. The main contributions of this article lies is in its exploration of corporate social irresponsibility (CSI) as a concept in contrast to CSR. Bowd, Jones and Tench's CSI-CSR model is described, explained, analysed and used as a conceptual tool to make the theoretical move from a pyramid or level-based approach to a more dynamic framework of analysis. Findings – The proposition that CSI is better suited to a shareholder business model and CSR sits more comfortably with a stakeholder business model is examined. It is contested that people often wrongly equate CSR with <b>irresponsible</b> corporate <b>actions.</b> The CSI-CSR model establishes a theoretical framework around which grounded empirical research can be undertaken, applied and on which it can be reported. Research limitations/implications – This is a new area of research that addresses a gap in the literature and puts forward innovative theoretical models. Discussing the concept of irresponsibility makes for an interesting theoretical move. It questions the idea that corporations and business per se are always or necessarily socially responsible. Originality/value – In looking at and developing existing theoretical models, concepts and frameworks and exploring their merits, shortcomings and limitations, the article will be of interest and relevance to the business and academic communities. If there is such a thing as CSR then the implication is that there is such a thing as CSI and it is on this issue that this article seeks to promote and stimulate discussion.

Beside political approach, ethical approach to this issue will give another perspectives on how public organization or public officials should operate. Based on this approach, there are 3 conflicting sources that resulted in <b>irresponsible,</b> or unatehical, <b>action</b> of public organizations as follow : conflict of authority, conflict of interest, and conflict of role. In order to eliminate negative impact of those conflicting aspects, {{we have to consider}} ethics solution as viable alternatives. One of the important steps is put ethics legislation (or ethics law) on policy agenda. It is essential to adopt the law that would regulate public organizations or public officials comply with their ethical action in area such as financial exposure, campaign financing and so forth. Furthermore, some basic principles of limitation should be considered as compelling frameworks. Assuming that there is a strong political commitment from supra-political structure on legislative reform, the possibility of the law to be implemented is relatively high since sociopolitical setting has changed significantly. The establishment of Ethics Commission (or other names) and Ethics Code in Legislative Act (UU no. 22 / 2003), the consistency of media to disclose the issues, and the result of legislative general election are some important factors for us to be more optimistic...|$|R
