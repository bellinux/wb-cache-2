40|$|The {{study was}} {{conducted}} to evaluate the energy use of natural gas and <b>electric</b> <b>ovens</b> in the production of polymer bearings and components. Tests were conducted to evaluate and compare the performance of natural gas and <b>electric</b> <b>ovens</b> in the process of sintering billets which are made from a broad range of materials such as PTFE and other fluoropolymers, elastomers, themosets, themoplastics and composites. The {{purpose of this study was}} to compare the process parameters under similar conditions for industrial applications where <b>electric</b> <b>ovens</b> have predominant use. Tests were performed to obtain the process efficiency and examine cost savings potential in converting <b>electric</b> <b>ovens</b> to natural gas. Preliminary results show that, for the plat studied, cost savings of about $ 10, 000 per oven can be achieved, with a simple payback period of less than two years. The results also show that additional energy savings will be realized if the oven size and exhaust flow are carefully selected. The data obtained from these experiments were used to calculate process efficiency. Design features and environmental issues are discussed...|$|R

50|$|Crompton was keen for {{electricity}} {{to be used}} for domestic as well as industrial purposes.

5000|$|In the 1920s, {{national}} advertising in magazines and radio broadcasts {{played a key}} role in the emergence of the fourth big cereal manufacturer, General Mills. In 1921, James Ford Bell, president of a Minneapolis wheat milling firm, began experimenting with rolled wheat flakes. After tempering, steaming, cracking wheat, and processing it with syrup, sugar, and salt, it was prepared in a pressure cooker for rolling and then dried in an <b>electric</b> <b>oven.</b> By 1925, Wheaties had become the [...] "Breakfast of Champions". In 1928, four milling companies consolidated as the General Mills Company in Minneapolis. The new firm expanded packaged food sales with heavy advertising, including sponsorship of radio programs such as [...] "Skippy", [...] "Jack Armstrong, The All-American Boy", and baseball games. Jack Dempsey, Johnny Weissmuller, and others verified the [...] "Breakfast of Champions" [...] slogan. By 1941 Wheaties had won 12% percent of the cereal market. Experiments with the puffing process produced Kix, a puffed corn cereal, and Cheerios, a puffed oats cereal. Further product innovation and diversification brought total General Mills sales to over $500 million annually (18% in packaged foods) by the early 1950s.|$|E

The second coach consists of the medical store, {{as well as two}} autoclave units. It also houses a drawing room. The train has a main Operation Theatre with three operating tables and a second self-contained operating theatre with two tables. In the main theatre, each table has its own set of anesthetic equipment, shadow lights, Boyles apparatus with Halothane vapourisers and imported Carl Zeiss microscope, multi-purpose monitor, defibrillator, diathermy cautery machine, anesthesia ventilator etc. The theatres are equipped with a closed circuit television camera which is used in providing training to local doctors in live surgical procedures. An attached six bed recovery room is situated beside the main theatre. The Lifeline Express also has a self-contained operation theatre. The second theatre can be detached to form a stand-alone operation theatre, and is to be used in disaster management.|$|E

Three trees at age 25 years were sampled, with boards being removed at DBH level in order to make specimens 2. 5 x 2. 5 x 5. 0 cm in size in the radial, tangential and axial direction respectively. In the combined treatment, specimens were subjected to thermal treatment in an autoclave set at 130 °C/± 3 °C and kgf/cm² pressure for 3 hours, then to a conditioning period, followed by heat in an <b>electric</b> <b>oven</b> set at 160 °C/± 1 °C for the same time.
