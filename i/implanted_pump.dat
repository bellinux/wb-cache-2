Conventional BLI can be repeated within the same animal after bolus reinjections of a bioluminescent substrate.

Use of {{intrathecal}} baclofen with an <b>implanted</b> <b>pump</b> seems a very useful mode of therapy in patients in whom oral antispasmodic agents are either not effective or produce intolerable side-effects. Materials and Methods: Twenty-four patients with mean age 50 years (range 32 - 72 years) had intrathecal baclofen pump implanted for the severe spasticity of spinal origin. One patient died following implantation of pump due to natural causes and {{was not included in the}} study. The patients were followed up for mean 22 months (range, one to five years). Results: All 24 patients showed improvement in their spasm following the procedure. Improvement was noted in pain (12), sleep disturbance (20) and sphincter control (14). Patients had improvement in activities of daily living such as feeding ability (10), self care (10), indoor and outdoor mobility (19), and driving (4). One patient had catheter leakage immediately after the surgery and required change of catheter. The radio telemetry allows very good adjustment of the dose according the individual patients needs. Conclusion: Intrathecal baclofen pump improves the symptoms of spasm and also the quality of life. It helps the patient to live more independently.

40|$|AIM: The {{purpose of}} this {{national}} multicenter prospective study by the French EVADIAC group {{was to investigate the}} possibility that continuous intraperitoneal insulin infusion using an <b>implanted</b> <b>pump</b> (CIpii) increases the risk of autoimmune disease in type 1 diabetic patients as it increased anti-insulin immunogenicity. METHODS: Prevalence of clinical (Hashimoto's disease, hyperthyroidism, gastric atrophic disease and vitiligo) and subclinical (presence of anti-thyroperoxidase antibodies, anti-intrinsic factor antibodies, abnormal TSH levels) autoimmune diseases was estimated by comparing two groups of patients already treated by either CIpii (n= 154) or external pump (CSII) (n= 121) for an average of 6 years. Incidence of autoimmune disease was determined by comparing the same measurements one year after inclusion. RESULTS: No significant difference was observed for the total prevalence of clinical and subclinical auto-immune thyroid and gastric di-seases (35. 6 % and 3. 2 % respectively in the CIpii group versus 40. 4 % and 2. 6 % in the CSII group). No significant difference for the incidence of clinical and subclinical auto-immune diseases was observed: 7. 2 % and 0 % in CIpii and 7. 3 % and 1. 7 % in CSII. CONCLUSION: As previously shown AIA (anti-insulin antibodies) levels were higher in CIpii than in CSII (32. 9 % vs 20. 2 %, P< 0. 0001) but no correlation was observed with either clinical or subclinical autoimmune disease.

40|$|The goal of {{this study}} was to propose a general {{numerical}} analysis methodology to evaluate the magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) -safety of active implants. Numerical models based on the finite element (FE) technique were used to estimate if the normal operation of an active device was altered during MRI imaging. An active <b>implanted</b> <b>pump</b> was chosen to illustrate the method. A set of controlled experiments were proposed and performed to validate the numerical model. The calculated induced voltages in the important electronic components of the device showed dependence with the MRI field strength. For the MRI radiofrequency fields, significant induced voltages of up to 20 V were calculated for a 0. 3 T field-strength MRI. For the 1. 5 and 3. 0 OT MRIs, the calculated voltages were insignificant. On the other hand, induced voltages up to 11 V were calculated in the critical electronic components for the 3. 0 T MRI due to the gradient fields. Values obtained in this work reflect to the worst case situation which is virtually impossible to achieve in normal scanning situations. Since the calculated voltages may be removed by appropriate protection circuits, no critical problems affecting the normal operation of the pump were identified. This study showed that the proposed methodology helps the identification of the possible incompatibilities between active implants and MR imaging, and can be used to aid the design of critical electronic systems to ensure MRI-safety...|$|E

40|$|Because of {{the limits}} of {{wearable}} needle-type or microdialysis-based enzymatic sensors in clinical use, fully implantable glucose monitoring systems (IGMS) represent a promising alternative. Long-term use reducing impact of invasiveness due to implantation, less frequent calibration needs because of a more stable tissue environment around the sensor and potential easier inclusion in a closed-loop insulin delivery system are the expected benefits of IGMS. First experiences with subcutaneous and intravenous IGMS have been recently collected in pilot studies. While no severe adverse events have been reported, biointerface issues have been responsible for the failures of IGMS. Tissue reactions around implanted subcutaneous devices and damages of intravenous sensors due to shearing forces of blood flow impaired IGMS function and longevity. In functioning systems, accuracy of glucose measurement reached satisfactory levels for average durations of about 120 days with subcutaneous IGMS and 259 days with intravenous sensors. Moreover, sensor information could help to improve time spent in normal glucose range when provided to patients wearing subcutaneous IGMS and allowed safe and effective closed-loop glucose control when intravenous sensors were connected to <b>implanted</b> <b>pumps</b> using intra-peritoneal insulin delivery.

40|$|BACKGROUND: Intrathecal drug {{delivery}} using implantable pumps {{is an effective}} method to control stable chronic pain. However, the appropriate alleviation of unpredictable pain fluctuations remains challenging. A possible solution {{is the use of}} patient-controlled analgesia (PCA) by means of a specific device [...] the personal therapy manager (PTM) [...] designed to be used with implanted programmable pumps. METHODS: A multicenter (n = 17), open-label registry recording 168 patients suffering from chronic pain with unsatisfactory control of pain episodes was initiated. While 79 patients (47 %) (group A) already carried an <b>implanted</b> <b>pump</b> at enrollment, all other patients were implanted after being registered in the study (group B). Parameters assessed included pain relief (visual analog score, VAS), quality of life (EQ- 5 D), patient and physician satisfaction, medication use, PTM programming parameters and adverse events. Final follow-up was at 12 months. RESULTS: At 12 months, there was a significant reduction (29 %) of the overall average VAS compared with baseline (P < 0. 01) in patients with newly implanted devices (group B). All patients tended to decrease the concomitant pain medication and the quality of life tended to improve (10 % on the EQ- 5 D scale). In total, 85 % of patients were satisfied with the PTM.

40|$|Purpose: To {{evaluate}} {{the feasibility of}} developing a novel mini drug pump for ophthalmic use. Methods: Using principles of microelectromechanical systems engineering, a mini drug pump was fabricated. The pumping mechanism is based on electrolysis, and the pump includes a drug refill port {{as well as a}} check valve to control drug delivery. Drug pumps were tested first on the benchtop and then after implantation in rabbits. For the latter, we implanted 4 elliptical (9. 9 × 7. 7 × 1. 8 mm) non-electrically active pumps into 4 rabbits. The procedure is similar to implantation of a glaucoma seton. To determine the ability to refill and also the patency of the cannula, at intervals of 4 to 6 weeks after implantation, we accessed the drug reservoir with a transconjunctival needle and delivered approximately as low as 1 µL of trypan blue solution (0. 06 %) into the anterior chamber. Animals were followed up by slit-lamp examination, photography, and fluorescein angiography. Results: Benchtop testing showed 2. 0 µL/min delivery when using 0. 4 mW of power for electrolysis. One-way valves showed reliable opening pressures of 470 mm Hg. All implanted devices refilled at 4 - to 6 -week intervals for 4 to 6 months. No infection was seen. No devices extruded. No filtering bleb formed over the implant. Conclusions: A prototype ocular mini drug pump was built, implanted, and refilled.

40|$|BACKGROUND AND AIMS: Refractory ascites (RA) affects 10 % of {{patients}} with advanced cirrhosis and ascites. Usual therapy includes large volume paracentesis, and in selected patients, a transjugular portosystemic shunt (TIPS). These therapies {{may be associated with}} increased morbidity: paracentesis may induce circulatory dysfunction and impair quality of life and TIPS may induce encephalopathy and is associated with increased mortality in patients with severe liver dysfunction. We present the results of a multicenter, non-randomized trial to assess the safety and efficacy of a new automated pump system for treatment of RA. METHODS: Forty patients at 9 centers (February 2010 to June 2011) received an <b>implanted</b> <b>pump</b> for the automated removal of ascites from the peritoneal cavity into the bladder, from where it was eliminated through normal urination. Patients were followed-up for 6 months. The primary study outcome was safety. Secondary outcomes included recurrence of tense ascites and pump performance. RESULTS: Surgical complications occurred early in the study and became less frequent. The pump system removed 90 % of the ascites and significantly reduced the median number of large volume paracentesis per month [3. 4 (range 1 - 6) vs. 0. 2 (range 0 - 4); p< 0. 01]. Cirrhosis-related adverse events decreased along follow-up. CONCLUSIONS: The automated pump seems is an efficacious tool to move out ascites from the peritoeal cavity to the bladder. Its safety is still moderate, but a broad use in different countries will improve the surgical technique as well as the medical surveillance.

Real-time (RT) -continuous glucose monitoring (CGM) gives RT information {{without the need}} for multiple invasive measurements. In theory, CIPII combined with RT-CGM could provide near normal glucose profiles. The objective {{of this study is to}} investigate effectiveness and safety of RT-CGM in patients treated with intraperitoneal insulin through an <b>implanted</b> <b>pump.</b> Methods: In an open-label, crossover, randomized study, effects of 6 -day open RT-CGM use were studied in 12 type 1 diabetes patients on CIPII, with blinded RT-CGM used as a control. Primary outcome was time in euglycemia. Secondary outcomes included time in other glucose ranges, incidence of adverse events, and patient satisfaction. Agreement of self-measurement of blood glucose (SMBG) and RT-CGM measurements was assessed. Results: Median time spent in euglycemia was 68. 2 % (55. 9 - 72. 3 %) with open RT-CGM and 64. 9 % (55. 3 - 71. 2 %) with blinded RT-CGM (P = 0. 25). Time spent in other glucose ranges did not differ (P> 0. 05). There were no serious adverse events. Patient satisfaction was good. Median relative absolute difference of SMBG and RT-CGM values was 13. 9 %. Bland-Altman analysis showed a mean difference of - 0. 31 mg/dL with lower and upper limits of agreement of - 77. 0 and + 76. 4 mg/dL, respectively. Conclusions: Short-term use of RT-CGM, although safe and with good patient satisfaction, does not result in more time spent in euglycemia, nor does it change time spent in other glucose ranges in our population of type 1 diabetes patients receiving CIPII...|$|E
40|$|Macrophage {{inflammatory}} protein- 1 alpha (MIP- 1 alpha) is an inhibitor of {{stem cell}} proliferation affording protection against damage from agents that express their cytotoxicity specifically in the DNA synthesis phase of the cell cycle. Its ability also to modify the self-renewal capacity of the regenerating cells is now shown to improve and maintain haemopoietic recovery following therapy (sublethal irradiation) whose cytotoxic damage is not limited solely to the DNA-S phase of this cycle. Such non-cell cycle-active cytotoxic agents are used clinically in repeated treatment regimens, which are often limited or terminated because of accumulating haemopoietic damage. BB- 10010, a non-aggregating variant of MIP- 1 alpha, was administered as a continuous dose (1600 micrograms kg- 1 24 h- 1) via a subcutaneously <b>implanted</b> <b>pump</b> {{over a period of}} 7 days. A dose of 4. 5 Gy total-body gamma-rays was given 3 - 4 h after implantation. Day 8 and 12 spleen colony-forming units (CFU-S) were assayed on days 1, 7 and 14 after irradiation. This cycle of treatment was repeated four times (total 56 days), and on day 14 of the last two cycles the marrow-repopulating ability (MRA) was also measured. In the control bone marrow (no BB- 10010) CFU-S fell to < 1 % of normal within 1 day of irradiation and recovered to 40 % at 14 days. Repeated treatments increased the level of damage, and after four cycles CFU-S recovered to only 10 % of normal. BB- 10010 afforded little benefit in the first treatment cycle, {{but by the end of}} the fourth cycle CFU-S still recovered to 35 % of normal. MRA was reduced to 7 % of normal by the irradiation protocol-about half that maintained by BB- 10010 protection. We conclude that BB- 10010 (MIP- 1 alpha) reduces the degree of accumulated haemopoietic stem cell damage following repeated non-cell cycle-specific cytotoxic insults-a principle which should be valuable in repeated clinical cytotoxic therapy regimens...|$|E
40|$|The iron-chelating drug {{deferoxamine}} mesylate (DFO) {{is active}} against Pneumocystis carinii in vitro and in rat and mouse models of P. carinii pneumonia. Because DFO has a short half-life, daily divided or continuous dosage {{was expected to}} improve the dose response, {{as is the case}} with DFO treatment of malaria. Therefore, results of single daily intraperitoneal injections were compared with results of an evenly divided four-times-daily dosage and the efficacy of delivery with <b>implanted</b> infusion <b>pumps.</b> The highest bolus dosage (1, 000 mg kg- 1 of body weight day- 1) was as effective as the standard combination of trimethoprim with sulfamethoxazole. Unexpectedly, very little improvement was observed with the divided or continuous dosage, and several mechanisms that could account for this are discussed...|$|R
40|$|Abstract: Alternate {{forms of}} insulin {{delivery}} {{are being developed}} to overcome problems with current subcutaneous insulin injection therapy like poor compliance due to pain, variable absorption and lack of feedback control. Nasally administered insulin is more rapidly absorbed than subcutaneous insulin. However, it has low bioavailability and causes nasal irritation. Intrapulmonary inhaled insulin shows promise, is absorbed quickly and peaks at 30 minutes and is therefore for prandial use only. Bioavailability is 10 - 20 %. Current inhalers are cumbersome and need repeated spirometry. The Technosphere inhaler, undergoing trials, is small and simple to operate and may be more acceptable. Encapsulated Oral Insulin or insulin incorporated into liposomes, polymers or emulsions have been partially successful. Paracellular insulin absorption by increasing tight junction permeability is successful and is in Phase 2 trials. Transdermal insulin, using iontophoresis and, recently, sonophoresis, with use of specialized particles shows improved absorption. Continuous subcutaneous insulin infusion (CSII) via a portable pump has become a routine therapy for selected Type 1 diabetic patients. Frequency of hypoglycemia is much less during CSII than multiple injection therapy (MIT), though mean blood glucose and HbA 1 C are only slightly better with CSII. Totally <b>implanted</b> <b>pumps</b> deliver intraperitoneal or intravenous insulin. Fluctuations in blood glucose are less. They are limited by invasiveness, delivery problems and infection. Closed loop insulin delivery employs continuous in vivo glucose sensing and automatic adjustment of insulin dose delivered (feedback control). Its safety in clinical practice {{will depend on the}} development of a really accurate and reliable glucose sensor. Small sized nanopump has been developed with closed loop insulin delivery system mounted on a disposable insulin skin patch and is undergoing trials. Gene therapy with transfected gut or liver cells are also showing some promise. Stem cell therapy in Type 1 diabetics has shown encouraging results...|$|R
40|$|In a {{companion}} article, we synthesized current clinical and preclinical data to formulate hypotheses about {{the etiology of}} drug administration catheter-tip inflammatory masses. In this article, we communicate our recommendations for the detection, treatment, mitigation, and prevention of such masses. Methods. We reviewed published and unpublished case reports and our own experiences to find methods to diagnose and treat catheter-tip inflammatory masses {{in a manner that}} minimized adverse neurological sequelae. We also formulated hypotheses about theoretical ways to mitigate, and possibly, prevent the formation of such masses. Results. Human cases have occurred only in patients with chronic pain who received intrathecal opioid drugs, alone or mixed with other drugs, or in patients who received agents that were not labeled for long-term intrathecal use. Most patients had noncancer pain owing to their large representation among the population with <b>implanted</b> <b>pumps.</b> Such patients also had a longer life expectancy and exposure to intrathecal drugs, and they received higher daily doses than patients with cancer pain. Clues to diagnosis included the loss of analgesic drug effects accompanied by new, gradually progressive neurological symptoms and signs. When a mass was diagnosed before it filled the spinal canal or before it caused severe neurological symptoms, open surgery to remove the mass often was not required. Anecdotal reports and the authors' experiences suggest that cessation of drug administration through the affected catheter was followed by shrinkage or disappearance of the mass over a period of 2 - 5 months. Conclusions. Attentive follow-up and maintenance of an index of suspicion should permit timely diagnosis, minimally invasive treatment, and avoidance of neurological injury from catheter-tip inflammatory masses. Whenever it is feasible, positioning the catheter in the lumbar thecal sac and/or keeping the daily intrathecal opioid dose as low as possible for as long possible may mitigate the seriousness, and perhaps, reduce the incidence of such inflammatory masses...|$|R
