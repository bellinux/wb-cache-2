The problem faced by the mine {{planning a}}nd geology team is to determine what level of sampling is necessary in order to accurately construct the geologic model of the orebody such that mining can be done at a low cost and without surprises. This thesis summarizes techniques for orebody construction based on geostatistics. In addition to estimating the position of a surface from the available exploration drill hole data, the accuracy of the estimates is also obtained. An economic model is outlined which compares the cost of additional exploration drilling to the potential cost benefits that result from better location of the mine development and production workings, thus allowing the optimal level of exploration to be determined. Principles of fractal geometry are also used to simulate geologic surfaces, and to construct a model for estimating the amounts of ore loss and dilution that may occur {{as a result of the}} deviations of the geologic model from the true orebody surfaces. An economic model for determining the optimal level of sampling such that ore loss and waste rock dilution is minimized is also outlined. The use of the orebody construction techniques and the two economic models is illustrated using data from LKAB's Malmberget mine, Sweden. Godkänd; 1990; 20070429 (ysko...|$|E
40|$|We {{are living}} in a new sex bureaucracy. Saliently decriminalized in the past decades, sex has at the same time become {{accountable}} to bureaucracy. In this Article, we focus on higher education {{to tell the story of}} the sex bureaucracy. The story is about the steady expansion of regulatory concepts of sex discrimination and sexual violence to the point that the regulated domain comes to encompass ordinary sex. The mark of bureaucracy is procedure and organizational form. Over time, federal prohibitions against sex discrimination and sexual violence have been interpreted to require educational institutions to adopt particular procedures to respond, prevent, research, survey, inform, investigate, adjudicate, and train. The federal bureaucracy required nongovernmental institutions to create mini-bureaucracies, and to develop policies and procedures that are subject to federal oversight. That oversight is not merely, as currently assumed, of sexual harassment and sexual violence, but also of sex itself. We call this bureaucratic sex creep—the enlargement of bureaucratic regulation of sexual conduct that is voluntary, non-harassing, nonviolent, and does not harm others. At a moment when it is politically difficult to criticize any undertaking against sexual assault, we are writing about the bureaucratic leveraging of sexual violence and harassment policy to regulate ordinary sex. An object of our critique is the bureaucratic tendency to merge sexual violence and sexual harassment with ordinary sex, and thus to trivialize a very serious problem. We worry that the sex bureaucracy is counterproductive to the goal of actually addressing the harms of rape, sexual assault, and sexual harassment. Our purpose is to guide the reader through the landscape of the sex bureaucracy so that its <b>development</b> and <b>workings</b> can be known and debated...|$|R
40|$|This thesis {{deals with}} the political, {{military}} and social aspects of the volunteer movement in Great Britain during the wars against revolutionary and Napoleonic France. It explores the nature and purpose of the volunteer infantry, yeomanry cavalry, and armed associations: their organisation, administration, membership, and political adherences. Several questions concerning the political nature of volunteering are addressed, and it is shown that both the volunteers' motivation and the government's reasons for raising a voluntary force were {{more closely related to}} military than to political considerations. The occupational structure and political allegiances of several corps are analysed, revealing a broad range of political allegiance. The conclusion is drawn that the volunteers were more a 'constitutional' force than a partisan one. This thesis also investigates {{the ways in which the}} volunteer movement posed a challenge to the established social and political order, particularly in its autonomy and 'democratic' organisation. The central government and local authorities were, however, well aware of the potential threat, and precautions were taken against its <b>development.</b> The <b>workings</b> of the volunteer 'system' are explored in order to judge the validity of contemporary criticism of volunteer autonomy, and it is concluded that fears of apparently democratic organisation were exaggerated. The question of volunteer loyalty is investigated by examining the means of selection, individuals' motives, and the response of corps to peace-keeping duties. Finally, an assessment of the position of the movement in contemporary society shows it to have been closely related to the ambivalent concept of the 'citizen-soldier'.

40|$|Development of {{reasonable}} hydrogeologic conceptual models {{is an integral}} step in any hydrogeological study. For underground mines in the Canadian Shield, where the presence of distributed workings, faults and surficial tailings impoundments exist, an understanding of both horizontal and vertical gradients is required. As part of the closure plan for the Giant Mine, located just outside Yellowknife, Northwest Territories along the shore of Great Slave Lake, a series of fourteen multi-level monitoring systems were installed to provide information on hydraulic gradients, {{as well as to}} act as a regional monitoring system after re-flood. Multi-level systems targeted to cross large-scale faults show that faults can act as either barriers or conduits for flow, possibly acting to compartmentalise the groundwater system. In one instance, data suggest that the character of a regional fault varies along strike length. Other multi-level systems provide information on the vertical component of gradients, both in the area of tailings impoundments and in areas near extensive underground <b>workings.</b> <b>Development</b> of a reasonable hydrogeologic conceptual model from which to assess both current conditions and potential future conditions after re-flood was significantly improved by the availability of multi-level data...|$|R
40|$|Large {{areas of}} ground are {{permanently}} supported on coal pillars, both in extensive old workings and current drivages in active mining operations.

40|$|This article {{proposes a}} new {{analytical}} framework for studying {{cities in the}} developing world based on the ‘political settlements’ approach. This has a dual purpose: to enrich comparative urban development research by bringing new theoretical ideas to bear on this field, but also to use capital cities as a lens to better understand national political settlements. The central argument is that urban built environments and their transformations in situations of late <b>development</b> reflect the <b>workings</b> of different varieties of clientelism, and by analysing the former we can better understand the latter. Specifically, issues such as the nature of urban land use and land allocation, the pace and form of construction, the effectiveness of environmental regulation and the provision of housing for different income groups are all revealing of political settlements and their broader development implications. The potential of this approach is explored through three narrative ‘sketches’ of contemporary urban development in Eastern Africa: the ‘city as marketplace’ (Kampala), the ‘city as expo’ (Kigali) and the ‘city as construction site’ (Addis Ababa). In presenting this framework, the article seeks to advance debate on methodological and analytical approaches to the study of both power relations and differential patterns of urban development...|$|R
40|$|This thesis examines, {{from the}} {{perspectives}} of local people and service providers, the <b>development</b> and <b>workings</b> of three community projects for older people, people with mental health issues and Aboriginal people in two public housing neighbourhoods in Sydney. It explores the question of how participatory approaches to community renewal can contribute to improvements in the everyday life and opportunities for people living in public housing. In this thesis, I argue that participatory approaches built around people’s lived experiences, can result in important changes, while also contributing towards further community transformations. Drawing on individual and group interviews with residents and front line staff and managers of local services, the thesis reveals the importance of understanding the diversity of people’s lives. Residents wanted respect and acknowledgement of their lived experiences as well as the opportunity to determine local priorities. Through analysing interagency collaboration, the study demonstrates the ambiguities of community practice. Although most agencies were severely constrained by requirements to work on very short term targeted projects, some had discretion to work collaboratively with residents. The analysis of community initiatives, from the perspective of participants, positions the importance of everyday injustices as the key influence motivating people’s involvement in community initiatives. This thesis is informed by feminist and critical theory on social justice and care. Using the work of both Nancy Fraser on social justice and Joan Tronto on the ethics of care, I develop an interpretative framework of a ‘just neighbourhood’ to connect everyday life with community practice. Within this framework, concepts of care intersect with social justice, making visible the significance of care in everyday life, particularly for older people and families. The framework’s application of social justice and care principles has the potential to enrich community practice and research. Through the participatory approach of this action research study, developed over four years, I identify the pivotal role of people with experiential knowledge in supporting the voices of marginalised groups. This challenges powerfully the silencing of people with mental ill-health and Aboriginal people in community renewal, and proposes a ‘just practice’ model for public housing neighbourhoods...|$|R
40|$|The {{estimation}} of vertical stress and its distribution over the underground mine workings is of prime importance. In this project work their estimation is {{been done with}} the help of numerical modeling by simulating the workings. Study and analysis of the stress distribution around <b>development</b> and depillaring <b>workings</b> in coal mines and vertical stress estimation is done. The working has been modelled by writing a program code in FLAC 5. 0. The modelling is done in stages involving driving of galleries (development) to form three pillars and then the extraction of these pillars (depillaring) by slicing, then complete extraction to form ribs further followed by the judicious rob and burst of rib. The model is run in each of these stages to get the vertical stress distribution. From the analysis of stress distribution through numerical model (FLAC 5. 0) for a depth cover of 95. 5 m following maximum vertical stress was observed as Maximum vertical stress over the pillar during development is about 3 MPa, Maximum vertical stress over the stook during development is about 4 Mpa and Maximum vertical stress over the rib during development is about 7 Mpa. The outcome of the results show that the ultimate vertical stress increases considerably with increase in the depth cover and get concentrated over the area of excavation with high stress concentration over the pillars, stooks and ribs above the normal stress under the given depth cover. ...|$|R
40|$|This thesis has a dual focus: the British Cabinet {{committee}} {{system and}} British colonial policy. Its primary {{interest is the}} functioning of the Cabinet committee system and in order to investigate this colonial policy will be analysed. This policy area has been chosen both for its intrinsic interest and because it provides an ideal vehicle for a full analysis of the workings of the committee system and the impact it had on policy development. Chapter One provides a critique of studies of British government and an outline of the main debates in the literature on colonial policy. It then outlines the nature, aims, hypotheses and aims of this study and the topics that will be studied. The second chapter provides an account of the <b>development</b> and <b>workings</b> of the Cabinet committee system. A brief account of the period up {{to the end of the}} Second World War is followed by a more detailed account of the elaboration and consolidation of the system under Attlee and then by an account of how the system fared under the Conservatives. Chapter Three examines the interrelationship between colonial policy and external policy. It first examines the various policy studies of the period and then examines three case studies: the Southern Cameroons, Malaysia and Aden. It concludes that sometimes colonial policy was entirely determined by strategic considerations, that the many external policy studies had little influence on the development of policy and that the committee system functioned erratically, had a conservative influence on policy-making and was poor at getting to grips with the big issues such as decline. The fourth chapter deals with colonial constitutional development. An analysis of the various long-term timetables for constitutional development precedes a brief account of the committee structure for this subject. Two geographical areas are then analysed, the Caribbean and Africa. This chapter concludes that the timetables for independence were of little value, highlights the difficulty Britain had in relinquishing control of the smaller colonies, and concludes that there was no coordinated policy for Africa and that there was no planned process of decolonization. The penultimate chapter deals with all aspects of policy for Malta, including its attempt to become part of the United Kingdom, and serves as a recapitulation of the various themes of this study and highlights the extent to which various policy areas were inextricably intertwined. It demonstrates the problems of constitutional advance in a strategically valuable colony and argues that the committee system did little to provide policy alternatives. This study concludes that the Cabinet committee system was anything but a neutral piece of government machinery. It had a significant impact on policy, but that was because of its many failings, not least its failure to coordinate policy. What was designed to give cohesion and control frequently produced confusion and incoherence. Overall a flawed policy process produced a flawed outcome...|$|R
40|$|The {{period of}} the Park {{administration}} (1961 - 1979) was an era during which Korea 2 ̆ 7 s capacity was fully mobilized for the rapid industrialization of the country, more precisely, for promoting production for export. This thrust produced an array of housing problems which the government could have addressed {{in a variety of}} ways. This study explores how the Park Administration increased its intervention in the housing market and why. ^ Regarding the how question this study identifies main thrusts of housing policy during the period: restrictive control over housing investment and speculation; increased effort to reduce home construction costs and expand the supply of lower-income housing; and attempts to allocate a larger portion of new dwellings to first-time buyers, providing them for non-homeowner 2 ̆ 7 s owner occupation. ^ The basic force which underlay these policy moves was the contradiction between the structural changes occurring in connection with economic <b>development</b> and the <b>workings</b> of the private housing market. The rapid expansion of economic activities, household income, and urban population together with restrictive control of government over housing investment resulted in house price inflation at far greater rates than those of general price inflation. The high rate of house price inflation attracted capital investment into the housing and also speculation, and pushed the living costs of wage workers upward. And also widened the economic gap between homeowners and tenants. These trends made it difficult to promote economic development based on an export-first strategy requiring a low wage rate and a high rate of investment in the primary industrial sector. ^ To resolve the contradiction, a better balance between the demand for and supply of housing had to be created. In the zeal of the regime to promote production for export, however, the regime failed to augment enough resources to housing. The inflationary problem inevitably ensued and serves to threaten the very development process that was being espoused. As a result, the government had to increase its intervention in the manner just described to attenuate the problem. ...|$|R
5000|$|It was {{not unusual}} for mining towns to grow into boom towns {{within a matter of}} only a few months, and Lake City was no exception. Promoted as the [...] "Metropolis of San Juan", the town flourished as a {{distribution}} point for goods and supplies forwarded to mines and camps in the northern Hinsdale County mining districts. The initial influx of pioneers, prospectors, and miners attracted scores of merchants and dozens of lawyers and assayers to provide goods, supplies, and services. Merchants profited by outfitting the surge of prospectors who flooded into the area in 1876 and 1877 and by supplying dozens of mines in the outlying mining districts. The early boom years brought the usual red-light district to Lake City as was seen in any male-dominated mining town of that period. Records from 1878 show that the city had two breweries and a [...] "Hell's Acre" [...] district with 20 saloons, dance halls, and brothels. Lake City had as many as 3,000 to 5,000 residents at one time. But despite this promising activity, northern Hinsdale County's mining districts lacked the three key factors in mining development: year-round transportation, abundant ore, and capital to finance <b>development</b> of underground <b>workings,</b> and by 1879, the boom had subsided.Constructed of rapidly built wooden structures, much of the town was destroyed by a fire in 1879. The town was rebuilt using brick and stone, and consequently many of those structures remain today. By this time Lake City was manufacturing its own building materials using local lumber, locally quarried stone, and bricks made from clay obtained at the nearby Slumgullion Earthflow. By 1884, the population was beginning to dwindle, but the arrival of the Denver & Rio Grande Railroad on narrow-gauge tracks that were laid in 1889 cut the cost of shipping gold and silver ores to smelters, and the economy saw an upturn which extended into the 1890s.|$|R

Although the growth of mutual-aid groups has escalated {{over the past three}} decades, there is little research on support groups created solely for the purpose of servicing depression and anxiety sufferers. Researchers have indicated that support and information at these meetings may prove to be a valuable and effective intervention which helps sufferers come to terms with their condition (Miller, 1987; Stein, Zungu-Dirwayi, Wessels, Berk & Wilson, 1998). The study at hand aimed to elucidate {{the ways in which the}} depression and anxiety support group was experienced as helpful, as well as those areas which could be improved to increase the effectiveness of the group system. The support group was examined over an eleven-month period, November 1999 – October 2000, during which time the progress and experiences of three new group members was specifically observed and chronicled. Seven participants, including three members of a support group catering for black depression and anxiety sufferers, were initially sourced and screened for inclusion in the study. Although not intentional, the three subjects that finally fulfilled the criteria for inclusion in the study were all white females attending the Johannesburg support group. Relevant data on the three participants was collected systematically over this period through a process of triangulation. Methods included structured and semi-structured interviews, written reports, questionnaires and participant observation. The grounded theory approach allowed the researcher to work inductively with the data and to discern and explore the connections between elements and patterns that emerged in the analysis. An integration of the research data revealed that the group was primarily helpful to participants through the factors of universality, cohesion, didactic instruction and downward social comparison. Furthermore, the results indicated that participants presenting with prominent avoidant personality disorder (APD), as measured by the Millon Clinical Multiaxial Inventory-II, are likely to strongly value the relief from social isolation that the support group setting affords them, as well as gaining comfort from belonging to and being accepted by a group and improving their interpersonal skills. On the negative front, the group would or could not move beyond a formative, early stage of group development. As a result, its members were either caught in a repetitive cycle of exploring the same territory or lost interest after a relatively short period of time and terminated membership. Based on the findings of this study, it is suggested that members be afforded the opportunity of attending a more advanced therapy group once they feel they have gained the necessary relief from the primary support group. The support group plays a valuable role of reassuring members that they are not alone in their suffering, offering them the learning experience of being accepted by a group and introducing them to group format and protocol. However, once a foundation has been established, it is likely that members would benefit from joining a more advanced group in which interpersonal learning and role modelling is emphasized. Members need an arena where they can explore their behaviour and feelings in depth, and with other members who are functioning at a similar level. It is hoped that the findings of this study will increase understanding of support group functioning, provide suggestions for future research involving APD clients and depression and/or anxiety sufferers in support gr oup settings and make some contribution towards theory-building in this field...|$|R
