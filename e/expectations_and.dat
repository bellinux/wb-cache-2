40|$|The neural {{response}} to a stimulus is influenced by endogenous factors such as <b>expectation</b> <b>and</b> attention. Current research suggests that <b>expectation</b> <b>and</b> attention exert their effects in opposite directions, where expectation decreases neural activity in sensory areas, while attention increases it. However, <b>expectation</b> <b>and</b> attention are usually studied either in isolation or confounded with each other. A recent study suggests that <b>expectation</b> <b>and</b> attention may act jointly on sensory processing, by increasing the {{neural response}} to expected events when they are attended, but decreasing it when they are unattended. Here we test this hypothesis in an auditory temporal cueing paradigm using magnetoencephalography in humans. In our study participants attended to, or away from, tones that could arrive at expected or unexpected moments. We found a decrease in auditory beta band synchrony to expected (versus unexpected) tones if they were unattended, but no difference if they were attended. Modulations in beta power were already evident prior to the expected onset times of the tones. These findings suggest that <b>expectation</b> <b>and</b> attention jointly modulate sensory processing...|$|R

Reviewers generally agreed that the fights were anti-climactic to their build-up spectacle. The final boss fight with the Joker was singled out for vapid gameplay, a battle with Killer Croc was labeled boring and overly long, and the reviewers said these should not have been in the game. However, the fear toxin-induced hallucination segments of Scarecrow's battles were almost unanimously praised as some of the game's best and most cerebral moments for their fourth wall manipulation, subversion of the game's established narrative and <b>expectations,</b> <b>and</b> meta-textual influences that were compared to the battle against Psycho Mantis in 1998's Metal Gear Solid, and 2002's Eternal Darkness.|$|E
