5|$|An {{estimated}} 24–45% {{of people}} with SCI suffer disorders of depression, and the suicide rate is as much as six {{times that of the}} rest of the population. The risk of suicide is worst in the first five years after injury. <b>In</b> <b>young</b> <b>people</b> with SCI, suicide is the leading cause of death. Depression is associated with an increased risk of other complications such as UTI and pressure ulcers that occur more when self-care is neglected.|$|E
5|$|Substance misuse, {{dependence}} and withdrawal {{are associated with}} self-harm. Benzodiazepine dependence as well as benzodiazepine withdrawal is associated with self-harming behaviour <b>in</b> <b>young</b> <b>people.</b> Alcohol is a major risk factor for self-harm. A study which analysed self-harm presentations to emergency rooms in Northern Ireland found that alcohol was a major contributing factor and involved in 63.8% of self-harm presentations. A recent study in the relation between cannabis use and deliberate self-harm (DSH) in Norway and England found that, in general, cannabis use {{may not be a}} specific risk factor for DSH in young adolescents.|$|E
5|$|In Vienna, {{two women}} were {{poisoned}} at their workplace in 1997, and the measured concentrations {{in one of them}} were the highest ever measured in a human being, 144,000 pg/g of fat. This is about one hundred thousandfold compared with TCDD concentrations in most people today, and about ten thousandfold compared with the sum of all dioxin-like compounds <b>in</b> <b>young</b> <b>people</b> today. She survived but suffered from difficult chloracne for several years. The poisoning likely happened in October 1997, but was not discovered until April 1998. At the institute where the women worked as secretaries, high concentrations of TCDD were found in one of the labs, suggesting that the compound had been produced there. The police investigation failed to find clear evidence and no one was ever prosecuted. Aside from malaise and amenorrhea there were surprisingly few other symptoms or abnormal laboratory findings.|$|E

5|$|Not {{only does}} SCI present {{children}} and adolescents {{with many of the}} same difficulties adults face, it affects the development of their sexuality. Although substantial research exists on SCI and sexuality in adults, very little exists on the ways in which it affects development of sexuality <b>in</b> <b>young</b> <b>people.</b> Injured {{children and adolescents}} need ongoing, age-appropriate sex education that addresses questions of SCI as it relates to sexuality and sexual function. Very young children become aware of their disabilities before their sexuality, but as they age they become curious just as able-bodied children do, and it is appropriate to provide them with increasing amounts of information. Caregivers help the child and family prepare for transition into adulthood, including in sexuality and social interaction, beginning early and intensifying during adolescence. Parents need education about the effects of SCI on sexual function so that they can answer their children's questions.|$|E
5|$|TBI {{is present}} in 85% of traumatically injured children, either alone or with other injuries. The {{greatest}} number of TBIs occur in people aged 15–24. Because TBI is more common <b>in</b> <b>young</b> <b>people,</b> its costs to society are high due {{to the loss of}} productive years to death and disability. The age groups most at risk for TBI are children ages five to nine and adults over age 80, and the highest rates of death and hospitalization due to TBI are in people over age 65. The incidence of fall-related TBI in First-World countries is increasing as the population ages; thus the median age of people with head injuries has increased.|$|E
5|$|Current {{research}} suggests that the rates of self-harm are much higher among young people with the average age of onset between 14 and 24. The earliest reported incidents of self-harm are in children between 5 and 7 years old. In the UK in 2008 rates of self-harm <b>in</b> <b>young</b> <b>people</b> could be as high as 33%. In addition there appears to be an increased risk of self-harm in college students than among the general population. In a study of undergraduate students in the US, 9.8% of the students surveyed indicated that they had purposefully cut or burned themselves on at least one occasion in the past. When the definition of self-harm was expanded to include head-banging, scratching oneself, and hitting oneself along with cutting and burning, 32% of the sample said they had done this. In Ireland, a study found that instances of hospital-treated self-harm were much higher in city and urban districts, than in rural settings. The CASE (Child & Adolescent Self-harm in Europe) study suggests that the life-time risk of self-injury is ~1:7 for women and ~1:25 for men.|$|E

40|$|This report {{examines}} how the increasing geographical inequality in Copenhagen is reflected <b>in</b> <b>young</b> <b>people's</b> active citizenship.

As we make use of hypotheses that are based on theory, we have a deductive approach to our study.

We conclude that the geographic inequality is not reflected <b>in</b> <b>young</b> <b>people's</b> active citizenship.

25|$|Nitrazepam {{is largely}} bound to plasma proteins. Benzodiazepines such as {{nitrazepam}} are lipid-soluble {{and have a}} high cerebral uptake.

40|$|The {{purpose of}} this paper is to explore the {{complexities}} involved <b>in</b> <b>young</b> <b>people's</b> attempts to move away from criminal activity. This paper draws on qualitative data from a study that aimed to identify how <b>young</b> <b>people</b> negotiate transitions away from offending. The paper argues that an analysis of the subtle shifts <b>in</b> <b>young</b> <b>people's</b> perceptions and interpretations of their situation sheds light on the complex nature of desisting from crime. To do so, the paper focuses on the role of relevance in order to explore how these subtle shifts <b>in</b> thinking enable <b>young</b> <b>people</b> to reinterpret their lives and move towards desistance. By way of undertaking this analysis, this paper draws on Alfred Schutz's phenomenological approach to the nature of relevance to explore how <b>young</b> <b>people</b> shift between their known world of 'doing crime' and an unknown world of being 'straight and legitimate'...|$|R
40|$|This paper {{considers}} {{the role of}} schools, place and national identity in shaping the ways <b>in</b> which <b>young</b> <b>people</b> {{make sense of the}} geography of higher education choice in the Welsh context.

The analyses suggest that this choice-making process, and the ways <b>in</b> which <b>young</b> <b>people</b> rationalised these decisions about where to study, varies according to where they lived and which school they attended. The paper illustrates the importance of moving beyond exclusively social-class based analyses of university choice making and embracing the significance of school and place <b>in</b> <b>young</b> <b>people's</b> geographical mobility...|$|R
