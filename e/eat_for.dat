5|$|Regulations {{require that}} {{scientists}} use as few animals as possible, especially for terminal experiments. However, while policy makers consider suffering {{to be the}} central issue and see animal euthanasia {{as a way to}} reduce suffering, others, such as the RSPCA, argue that the lives of laboratory animals have intrinsic value. Regulations focus on whether particular methods cause pain and suffering, not whether their death is undesirable in itself. The animals are euthanized at the end of studies for sample collection or post-mortem examination; during studies if their pain or suffering falls into certain categories regarded as unacceptable, such as depression, infection that is unresponsive to treatment, or the failure of large animals to <b>eat</b> <b>for</b> five days; or when they are unsuitable for breeding or unwanted for some other reason.|$|E

The Lord alone stands as an eternal witness, ever contented, and does not <b>eat,</b> <b>for</b> he {{is the director of}} both the eater and the eaten.|$|E

25|$|The egg sac of the {{triangulated}} cobweb spider is {{made from}} loosely woven silk, and {{is about the same}} size as the spider itself. Each egg sac contains approximately 30 eggs. Cobweb spiders typically live on windows or in dirt areas. They <b>eat</b> <b>for</b> a margin of their day and spend hours developing their web; it does not break if it is woven well. Below or in its web, there may be many dead insects, ranging from stinkbugs to other spiders, and even wasps.|$|E

25|$|The {{patient is}} kept NPO (Nil per os) or NBM (Nothing By Mouth) that is, {{told not to}} <b>eat,</b> <b>for</b> at least 4 hours before the procedure. Most {{patients}} tolerate the procedure with only topical anesthesia of the oropharynx using lidocaine spray. However, some patients may need sedation and the very anxious/agitated patient may even need a general anesthetic. Informed consent is obtained before the procedure. The main risks are bleeding and perforation. The risk is increased when a biopsy or other intervention is performed.|$|E

25|$|Boa constrictors are ambush predators, {{so often}} lie {{in wait for}} an {{appropriate}} prey to come along, when they attack. However, they have also been known to actively hunt, particularly in regions with a low concentration of suitable prey, and this behaviour generally occurs at night. The boa first strikes at the prey, grabbing it with its teeth; it then proceeds to constrict the prey until death before consuming it whole. Unconsciousness and death likely result from shutting off vital {{blood flow to the}} heart and brain, rather than suffocation as was previously believed; constriction can interfere with blood flow and overwhelm the prey's usual blood pressure and circulation. This would lead to unconsciousness and death very quickly. Their teeth also help force the animal down the throat while muscles then move it toward the stomach. It takes the snake about 4–6 days to fully digest the food, {{depending on the size of}} the prey and the local temperature. After this, the snake may not <b>eat</b> <b>for</b> a week to several months, due to its slow metabolism.|$|E

500|$|Breeding occurs from August to December. Like all currawongs, {{it builds}} a large cup-nest out of sticks, lined with softer material, {{and placed in}} the fork of a tree from [...] high. Old nests are {{sometimes}} tidied up and reused in following years. A typical clutch has two to four pale grey-brown, purplish-buff, spotted, blotched red-brown or purplish-brown eggs. [...] As in all passerines, the chicks are born naked, and blind (altricial), and remain in the nest for an extended period (nidicolous). Both parents feed the young, but the male feeds them alone after leaving the nest and as they become more independent, and also moves from giving food directly to them to placing it on the ground near them so they learn to <b>eat</b> <b>for</b> themselves.|$|E

500|$|Act II {{begins with}} Midas enamored {{with his new}} power of turning things to gold. However, his courtiers {{complain}} of being forced to wear heavy golden clothing. Midas rebukes them, saying [...] "I am a God!". But Midas himself begins to experience the problems of turning everything he touches to gold: he cannot <b>eat,</b> <b>for</b> example. He starts to regret his wish, saying [...] "Oh! fool! to wish to change all things to gold! / Blind Ideot that I was!". Midas prays to Bacchus to take away his power, begging [...] "Make me a hind, clothe me in ragged skins— / And let my food be bread, unsavoury roots, / But take from me the frightful curse of gold". Midas has his courtiers sacrifice to the gods {{to see if he}} can be relieved of his curse; Bacchus relents and tells him to bathe in the river. The courtiers find it strange that he does not remove his crown while he swims; one of them resolves to peek under his crown while he is sleeping. Returning from his swim, Midas celebrates nature, saying gold [...] "is a sordid, base and dirty thing;— / Look at the grass, the sky, the trees, the flowers, / These are Joves treasures & they are not gold".|$|E
500|$|The episode {{received}} generally positive {{reviews from}} critics, {{most of whom}} seemed to have judged it on different criteria from their normal {{because it was a}} holiday episode. The Atlantic Kevin Fallon may have called it [...] "sickly oversweet", but maintained [...] "that's exactly what you want at Christmas". His colleague Patrick Burns wrote, [...] "Holiday episodes tread a dangerous line between sweet and saccharine, but this episode splits the difference perfectly." [...] The title of the article they wrote with Meghan Brown, [...] "Glee Does Christmas: Cheesy but Charming", found echoes in other reviews: both Amy Reiter of The Los Angeles Times and Anthony Benigno of the Daily News also thought the episode was quite cheesy, but Benigno characterized it as [...] "the good kind of cheese; the kind you'll <b>eat</b> <b>for</b> antipasti before grandma and grandpa bring out the roast beef on Christmas dinner", and Reiter's bottom line was that it [...] "may not have been the most wonderful episode of the year, but it did feature moments that twinkled and shined like the lovingly trimmed family tree." [...] Time James Poniewozik was less enthusiastic when he noted that Glee delivered an episode [...] "that touched on all the requisite holiday bases but that felt perfunctory", and added that it was [...] "generally ho-ho-hum". Robert Canning of IGN gave it a [...] "great" [...] 8 out of 10, but stated that [...] "the episode as a whole was lacking just a bit to turn it into an absolute classic", and The A.V. Club Todd VanDerWerff gave the episode a [...] "B−" [...] and wrote, [...] "I guess I'd say that I thought the episode worked moment-to-moment, without working as an overall narrative", but also stated that it was [...] "positively filled with stupid moments".|$|E

40|$|Healthy {{eating is}} a topic most people would {{consider}} they have an understanding of, yet it is an area which is not often addressed from a critical perspective.

Healthy <b>eating</b> <b>for</b> children is presented and problematised as a concept while family changes in eating patterns and curriculum influences are interpreted and challenged through the development of a case study investigation of an educational intervention.
