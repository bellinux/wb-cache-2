Pagliarulo took charge of writing the <b>incipit</b> of Fallout 3, then played by Ron Perlman, {{and he tried to}} be inspired by first Fallout's <b>incipit,</b> in 1997, which he considered vitally important to describe the story that Fallout 3 would have to tell. To succeed in making this script effective, Pagliarulo, had to go in the opposite direction to his previous work on Oblivion, which both for setting and characters, represented an extreme Fallout inverse.|$|E

25|$|Nevertheless, at {{the court}} of Svatopluk, who himself professed the Latin Rite, intrigues against Methodius and the liturgy in Old Church Slavonic {{gathered}} strength. Svatopluk sent John of Venice, a known opponent of the Slavic liturgy, to Rome in 879 to achieve a settlement of ecclesiastical differences. In a letter addressed to Methodius in the same year, the Pope sharply rebuked him for using Slavonic in church services. Methodius, however, travelled to Rome in 880, together with a Moravian delegation. Under his influence Pope John VIII {{changed his mind and}} in a letter, known for its <b>incipit,</b> Industriae tuae, the Pope repeated that Mass was to be sung in Latin whenever requested, but he also allowed the use of Slavonic liturgy. The letter also confirmed the decision taken by the Holy See during Rastislav's reign to create an archdiocese for Great Moravia. Upon Svatopluk's request the Pope promoted a German priest, Witching, to be Bishop of Nitra, but he added that the new Bishop and all the clerics in Great Moravia were expected to be obedient to Methodius, who remained the head of the church in Svatopluk's realms.|$|E

Bruckner set it for four unaccompanied voices, intended for {{the dedication of the}} [...] (votive chapel) at the New Cathedral in Linz, Austria, where Bruckner had been a cathedral organist. It was the first motet that Bruckner composed in Vienna. It was published in 1886, together with three other gradual motets.|$|E
500|$|The Book of Kells {{is one of}} {{the finest}} and most famous of a group of manuscripts in {{what is known as the}} Insular style, {{produced}} from the late 6th through the early 9th centuries in monasteries in Ireland, Scotland and England and in continental monasteries with Hiberno-Scottish or Anglo-Saxon foundations. These manuscripts include the Cathach of St. Columba, the Ambrosiana Orosius, fragmentary Gospel in the Durham Dean and Chapter Library (all from the early 7th century), and the Book of Durrow (from the second half of the 7th century). From the early 8th century come the Durham Gospels, the Echternach Gospels, the Lindisfarne Gospels (see illustration at right), and the Lichfield Gospels. Among others, the St. Gall Gospel Book belongs to the late 8th century and the Book of Armagh (dated to 807–809) to the early 9th century. Scholars place these manuscripts together based on similarities in artistic style, script, and textual traditions. The fully developed style of the ornamentation of the Book of Kells places it late in this series, either from the late 8th or early 9th century. The Book of Kells follows many of the iconographic and stylistic traditions found in these earlier manuscripts. For example, the form of the decorated letters found in the <b>incipit</b> pages for the Gospels is surprisingly consistent in Insular Gospels. Compare, for example, the <b>incipit</b> pages of the Gospel of Matthew [...] and , both of which feature intricate decorative knot work patterns inside the outlines formed by the enlarged initial letters of the text.

In Luke's account, Simeon, an aged and devout Jew, stands in the Temple of Jerusalem at the time Mary and Joseph bring the infant Jesus to be {{presented}} in the temple forty days after his birth in accordance with Jewish law and custom. Luke states that Simeon is [...] "waiting for the consolation of Israel" [...] after being promised that [...] "he should not see death before {{he had seen the}} Lord's Christ". (...) Simeon, upon seeing the child, takes him into his arms and prays, prophesizing the redemption of the world by Jesus and of suffering to come.

500|$|The Tale of Mac Da Thó's Pig survives in {{at least}} six manuscripts. The {{earliest}} and best form {{of the story is}} preserved in three texts: the Book of Leinster, in the paper leaves of H.3.18 in Trinity College, Dublin, and in the Harley 5280 manuscript in the British Library (formerly the British Museum). The earliest of these is the Book of Leinster, written c. AD 1160; the Harley 5280 manuscript was written {{in the first half of}} the 16th century, whereas H.3.18 was written c. 1700. In two of these manuscripts, H.3.18 and Harley 5280, the story is called Scēla muici M(ei)c Dathó, [...] "Tidings of the pig of MacDathó". In the Book of Leinster, the story is similarly entitled <b>Incipit</b> Scēl Mucci M(ei)c Dathó. These texts are independent of each other, but are believed to be derived from a common source. Linguistically, this source is believed to be a lost 10th- or 11th-century transcript of a previous version dating to c. 800. The scene of the story, and its familiarity with the area of modern County Kildare, suggests a Leinster authorship; though it appears that the south-west of Ireland was also not unknown to the author.|$|E
500|$|The verso of the folio {{containing}} the Arrest of Christ contains a full page of decorated text which begins [...] "". Facing the miniature of the Temptation is another full page of decorated text (folio 203r [...] "Iesus autem plenus"). In {{addition to this}} page, five other full pages also receive elaborate treatment. In Matthew, {{there is one other}} full-page treatment ( [...] , [...] "Tunc crucifixerant Xpi cum eo duos latrones"). In the Gospel of Mark, there are also two pages of decorated text ( [...] , [...] "Erat autem hora tercia", and folio 187v, [...] " [...] quidem [...] postquam"). The Gospel of Luke contains two pages of fully decorated text (folio 188v, [...] "Fuit in diebus Herodis [...] ", and , [...] "Una autem sabbati valde"). Although these texts do not have miniatures associated with them, it is probable that miniatures were planned to accompany each of these texts and have either been lost or were never completed. There is no surviving full page of text in the Gospel of John other than the <b>Incipit.</b> However, in the other three Gospels, all the full pages of decorated text, except for folio 188c, which begins the Nativity narration, occur within the Passion narrative. However, since the missing folios of John contain the Passion narrative, it is likely that John contained full pages of decorated text that have been lost.|$|E
