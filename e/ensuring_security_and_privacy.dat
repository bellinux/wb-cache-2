To address this problem, we propose a privacy-aware access control policy specification framework, known as Intelligent Electronic Health Records Privacy Manager (iEHRpm). This framework refines the abstract Role Based Access Control model, also commonly known as RBAC, into Parameterized RBAC which provides for finer grain of authorization and comprehensive composition of disclosure rules based on user intentions to ensure security and privacy of electronic health records in a practical healthcare system. An additional requirement in such a framework is that the user specified privacy policy does not conflict with the overall policy of the domain. Conflict occurs when user policy and the domain policy managing {{the same set of}} subjects and resources attempt to enforce conflicting policies over them. The proposed framework provides a methodology for verifying the privacy rules to ensure correctness and logical consistency.

40|$|Modern cloud {{computing}} infrastructures use virtual machine monitors (VMMs) that often include {{a large and}} complex administrative domain with privileges to inspect client VM state. Attacks against or misuse of the administrative domain can compromise client security and privacy.

We introduce a new self-service cloud (SSC) computing model that addresses these two shortcomings. SSC splits administrative privileges between a system-wide domain and per-client administrative domains. Each client can manage and perform privileged system tasks on its own VMs, thereby providing flexibility. The system-wide administrative domain cannot inspect the code, data or computation of client VMs, thereby <b>ensuring</b> <b>security</b> <b>and</b> <b>privacy.</b> SSC also allows providers and clients to establish mutually trusted services that can check regulatory compliance while respecting client privacy.

The checklist was completed from a consumer 2 ̆ 7 s perspective and comprised website layout, access to health information, online advertising, and sale and supply of medicines. Stage 2 involved on-site interviews with staff of Brisbane internet pharmacies and observation of their supply practice. The interviews were recorded, transcribed and thematically analysed. Features of the practices were compared. Results: Twenty-six internet pharmacy websites were identified Australia-wide in January 2009 and reviewed.

40|$|In today's Internet, {{with the}} advent of cloud computing, there is a natural desire for enterprises, organizations, and end users to {{outsource}} increasingly large amounts of data to a cloud provider. Therefore, <b>ensuring</b> <b>security</b> <b>and</b> <b>privacy</b> is becoming a significant challenge for cloud computing, especially for users with sensitive and valuable data. Recently, many efficient and scalable query processing methods over encrypted data have been proposed. Despite that, numerous challenges remain to be addressed due to the high complexity of many important queries on encrypted large-scale datasets. This thesis studies the problem of privacy-preserving database query processing on structured data (e. g., relational and graph databases). In particular, this thesis proposes several practical and provable secure structured encryption schemes that allow the data owner to encrypt data without losing the ability to query and retrieve it efficiently for authorized clients. This thesis includes two parts. The first part investigates graph encryption schemes. This thesis proposes a graph encryption scheme for approximate shortest distance queries. Such scheme allows the client to query the shortest distance between two nodes in an encrypted graph securely and efficiently. Moreover, this thesis also explores how the techniques can be applied to other graph queries. The second part of this thesis proposes secure top-k query processing schemes on encrypted relational databases.

30|$|There exist {{a number}} of works to address safety and privacy issues in VANETs. Raya and Hubaux [25] {{proposed}} a CPPA scheme based on PKI, which can achieve both security and privacy requirements of VANETs. However, it is time consuming because of the usage of a certificate revocation list (CRL). In addition, {{the size of the}} CRL is large, and it increases as the number of the revoked vehicles grows. The increasing number of CRL makes it hard for vehicles to authenticate messages in real time. Thus, checking against the CRL is bound to be a cause of authentication delay. In order to deal with the CRL problem in PKI-based schemes, elliptic curve-based schemes have been proposed due to its time efficiency. ECDSA is a main application of elliptic curve-based schemes. It is more computationally efficient than the commonly used PKI-based schemes [26]. It has been recommended for message authentication by the current wireless access in vehicular environment (WAVE) standards. In addition, many authentication schemes have been proposed based on ECDSA. In [27], the authors proposed an efficient conditional privacy preservation (ECPP) protocol, which was a good implementation of ECDSA. However, the computational complexity of ECPP is heavy because of the usage of bilinear pairing. In order to improve the computation speed in message authentication, Zhang et al. introduced an identity-based batch verification (IBV) scheme in [28]. The IBV scheme still needs to use bilinear pairings and requires a special hash function known as the MapToPoint function, which is also time inefficient in VANETs. However, the IBV enables the received messages with signatures to be authenticated at the same time such that the total verification time could be reduced. To achieve better performance and reduce the computation cost, He et al. [29] and Lo and Tsai [30] proposed new efficient authentication schemes which did not use bilinear pairing under the premise of <b>ensuring</b> <b>security</b> <b>and</b> <b>privacy.</b> They presented a better performance in terms of computation cost. Shim in [31] proposed a conditional privacy preserving authentication scheme, called as CPAS. It reduced the computation time by canceling the use of MapToPoint function. In this paper, we mix together the advantages of both batch authentication and ECDSA without bilinear pairing and employ the MapToPoint to construct our authentication scheme.|$|E
