He was the Driver of the Year (in the United States) {{for three years}} (1967, 1978, and 1984), {{and is the only}} driver to be Driver of the Year in three decades. Andretti was named the U.S. Driver of the Quarter Century in 1992. He was inducted into the International Motorsports Hall of Fame in 2001, the United States National Sprint Car Hall of Fame in 1996, the Motorsports Hall of Fame of America in 1990, the Hoosier Auto Racing Hall of Fame in 1970 , the Automotive Hall of Fame in 2005 and the <b>Diecast</b> Hall of Fame in 2012.|$|E
25|$|Dinky Toys was {{the brand}} name for {{die-cast}} Mazak zinc alloy miniature vehicles produced by Meccano Ltd. They were made in England from 1934 to 1979, at a factory in Binns Road in Liverpool. Dinky Toys {{were among the most}} popular <b>diecast</b> vehicles ever made - predating other popular <b>diecast</b> marques, including Corgi, Matchbox, and Mattel's Hot Wheels (Ralston 2009, 7; Richardson 1999, 128).|$|E
25|$|Corgi Toys of England has {{produced}} {{a wide range of}} Batmobiles ranging from the original sedan to the latest movie Batmobiles. They also have produced a Batboat, Red Bird & Jokermobile for their <b>diecast</b> toy lines.|$|E
5000|$|It was {{announced}} that Cars Toons: Mater's Tall Tales was to be released {{as part of the}} DisneyÂ·Pixar Cars Die-Cast Line in mid-2009. In October 2009, they released several <b>diecasts.</b> They released all of the [...] "Rescue Squad Mater" [...] and [...] "Mater the Greater" [...] <b>diecasts,</b> and they are working on [...] "El Materdor" [...] <b>diecasts</b> and reverse.|$|R

40|$|Tautologically, {{castability}} is {{a critical}} requirement in any casting process. Traditionally, castability in sand and permanent mold applications is thought to depend heavily on fluidity and hot tearing. Given capital investments in dies, die soldering {{is a critical}} parameter to consider for <b>diecasting.</b> We discuss quantitative and robust methods to insure repeatable metal casting for <b>diecasting</b> applications by inve-stigating these three areas. Weight reduction initiatives call for progressively thinner sections, which in turn are dependent on reliable fluidity. Quantitative investigation of hot tearing is revealing how stress develops and yields as alloys solidify, and this has implications on part distortion even when pressure-casting methodologies preclude hot tearing failures. Understanding the underlying mechanism of die soldering presents opportunities to develop methods to avoid costly downtime and extend die life. Through an understanding of castability parameters, greater control over the <b>diecasting</b> process can be achieved...|$|R
25|$|City of Truro {{featured}} as {{a character}} in the book Duck and the Diesel Engine, part of The Railway Series by the Rev. W. Awdry. The loco has also appeared in the television spin-off Thomas the Tank Engine and Friends, and was released as a <b>diecast</b> model in the Ertl range.|$|E
25|$|Typical of {{an early}} {{diecasting}} firm, also made were sundry <b>diecast</b> buildings, road signs, doll house furniture pieces and yard working shovels, pitchforks, rakes and other implements. Some of the larger toys and doll house accessories were apparently tooling from Tri-Ang of England as the Tri-Ang name appears with the clown and Fun Ho! logo on some toys (Fun Ho! 2015).|$|E
25|$|In <b>diecast,</b> the '63 Nova SS was {{modelled}} in 1:18 scale by Sun Star. ERTL {{offered a}} '66 Nova SS hardtop with a 327 V8, '69 Nova SS396 and '70 Nova SS396, {{in a variety}} of colors and wheels. Peachtree made '68 and '69 Novas in detailed 1:18 scale.

25|$|In 2015, in {{the wake}} of renewed debate about the {{symbolism}} of the Confederate battle flag (which was prominently featured on the General Lee 's roof and panel behind the rear window in the first five episodes), reruns of the original series were pulled from circulation. Warner Bros., which owns the property, announced it would also no longer create merchandise bearing the flag, including miniatures of the General Lee. However many people still make and sell custom General Lee <b>diecast</b> replicas everywhere online.|$|E
25|$|Early <b>diecast</b> Fun Ho! {{cars were}} a Ford Model A, a 1949 Ford, a Packard Roadster, an Austin Healey 100, a Studebaker saloon, a Humber Hawk, an MG TD roadster, a Jaguar XK 120 {{convertible}} and coupe, the above-mentioned Mercedes Streamliner and an interesting early 1950s 'High Boy' hot rod that looks suspiciously like the design that Auburn Rubber toys {{used in their}} inventory. A caravan house trailer was also available. A Morestone-like motorcycle with sidecar and single motorcycle with rider were also offered.|$|E
25|$|Importantly, plastic {{gradually}} became the primary {{material for the}} modeling and collecting hobby in the United States after World War II. The post-war labor and business environment supported only the simpler casting of cheaper materials for toys, although they could be made with great detail. By contrast, in Europe complex <b>diecast</b> metal zamac toys in smaller sizes with many working features became the common. These were more complex products for a labor structure driven by a densely populated craft guild environment. These characteristics were not as prevalent in the United States.|$|E

40|$|The work {{is aimed}} at {{evaluating}} the feasibility of the <b>diecasting</b> process, applied to discontinuously reinforced aluminium alloys. The potential of metal matrix composites has been limited, up to now, by the high costs associated to manufacturing and machining. The possibility of producing near net shape components by means of casting processes represents an interesting chance, but various technological aspects have to be deeply investigated (castability, distribution of reinforcement, possible defects, final properties). In this paper, the possibility of producing industrial components by <b>diecasting</b> Al matrix composites is explored...|$|R

25|$|In 1978, British Lesney, {{makers of}} Matchbox <b>diecast</b> vehicles, bought AMT {{and moved the}} company to Baltimore, closing the Maple Road {{facility}} in Troy, Michigan (just outside Detroit). (Cawthon 2002). By this time, prices of plastics had increased and Detroit was squeezed by government regulations of safety, emissions and fuel economy. Detroit sponsored fewer and fewer promotionals so model companies depended more on kits but the model building hobby declined as well. Also, AMT had an incredible display of models and documentary history at its headquarters that was scattered at that time (Anderson 2003).|$|E
25|$|It is {{interesting}} that packaging {{for many of the}} promotional offerings was identical to that of other <b>diecast</b> manufacturers. For example, the Mercedes Unimog (shown here) had an identical silver black-lined box design to that of the NZG Mercedes Coupe. The only difference is the precise box size and the color of the lettering stating what vehicle came inside. This is evidence of the control of the client over many promotional companies and their offerings. Obviously, Mercedes wanted a particular appearance for its packaged products and required that across multiple providers.|$|E
25|$|Models were well-proportioned {{and looked}} similar in style to {{contemporary}} Matchbox or Budgie Toys. For example, similar to Matchbox, the Land Rover (which {{came with a}} horse trailer) had windows, grey or black plastic wheels and a black base (see photo, Force 1988, p.47).The model in the photograph is a very poor example and any self respecting collector wouldn't have it on the shelf. Wheels, however, (the Land Rover had one on the bonnet {{as well as one}} underneath) were somewhat flatter and wider than those of Matchbox and their circumference was not ribbed at the beginning but this feature was added later. The baseplate, however, was pressed steel with etched lettering (not <b>diecast</b> with moulded lettering {{as was the case with}} Matchbox, Budgie Toys or Lone Star vehicles). Finally, the Land Rover had a trailer hook behind which was a cut, curved extension of the baseplate. The front and rear axles were held to the vehicle differently. The front was covered by the tube of the baseplate and held pinched on each side by extensions of the <b>diecast</b> body. The rear axle was exposed and run through holes in rounded sections folded over on each side of the plate. The ref. 072 Bedford articulated lorry was a reproduction of the Meccano factory lorry, its articulated flat trailer was dimensioned to receive the Hornby Dublo container.

40|$|Quality of <b>diecasting</b> {{components}} {{is strongly}} influenced by the fluid-dynamics filling. Consequently, a good design of the die cavity is fundamental to avoid turbulence, resulting in casting defects, and to allow the production of very complex castings. Particularly, the gate system {{is one of the}} most important mould part to be controlled, to guarantee an effective die filling. Commercial software for the simulation of mould filling and casting solidification represent an important tool of analysis and a good help for a correct design. The aim of this work is to define the effect of the gating system geometry on the energy loss during filling of <b>diecasting</b> dies and also on their pattern flow. The study was approached by the use of two numerical simulation software: CalcosoftÂ® (specific for 2 D problem) and Procast. The attention was focused on fan feed gates, considered to be the most widely used in high pressure <b>diecasting.</b> The first part of this paper describes the research of a relationship between energy dissipation and gate design, in terms of gate convergence angle, section thickness, sketch, etc [...] Initially a few 2 D simple geometries, characterized by different shape, were investigated, considering a typical aluminun-silicon alloy for the data needed for simulation. Subsequently, as a function of the results previously obtained, the study was extended also to 3 D geometries, to evaluate the effect of the fan feed shape, of the ratio between runner and gate sections and finally of the runner width/thickness ratio. A first important result obtained by the simulation analysis is that an optimization of the gating system cannot be obtained through the variation of a single parameter; a compromise must be researched in order to take into account the interaction between every factor. So, small variation ranges, for each geometrical parameter, were fixed to avoid bad configurations of the gate-runner system. In other words, guidelines for a good <b>diecasting</b> die design were attained. To validate the results achieved, the approach was extended also to a real geometry of a <b>diecasting</b> die for the realization of flat tensile strength samples of different thickness, demonstrating a performance improvement of about 30 %. The design guidelines obtained are nowadays used for the realization of an experimental <b>diecasting</b> mould for future tests...|$|R
40|$|Abstract. Effort {{has been}} devoted to develop new heat {{resistant}} <b>diecasting</b> alloys based on Mg-Al-Zn system in this research. Small amounts of cerium-rich misch metal and antimony additions to AZ 91 alloy could enhance the tensile strength at an elevated temperature while keeping the good castability. The increase of Zn content in Mg- 8 (wt%) Al-xZn- 0. 5 RE- 0. 5 Sb alloys, was observed to significantly increase the yield strength at 175 oC although the castability such as fluidity and hot cracking resistance was slightly decreased. Intensive microstructural investigation on the new Mg-Al-Zn <b>diecasting</b> alloys was also carried out...|$|R
5000|$|The {{die-casting}} {{business was}} split into a subsidiary called Franklin Die-Casting Corp. In 1926, Franklin Manufacturing [...] "reabsorbed" [...] the <b>diecasting</b> subsidiary and consequently, it also went under when {{the parent company}} failed.|$|R
25|$|Meccano {{introduced}} its OO scale trains in 1938 {{under the name}} 'Hornby Dublo'. The locomotives were <b>diecast</b> metal, and the carriages and wagons were generally made of tinplate. This was a very well planned range of electric and clockwork models, successfully consolidating 12V DC as the standard for OO scale. This led {{to the adoption of}} OO as a broadly accepted modelling standard in the UK, whereas {{much of the rest of}} the world adopted HO scale. As for their O gauge locomotives, electric Hornby Dublo locomotives ran on a third rail electric system with the track built on a pressed tinplate base.|$|E
25|$|About 1978, Cursor went in a {{different}} direction. First, models of contemporary trucks, mostly Mercedes-Benzes, started to appear. Secondly, these were now often <b>diecast</b> in zamac. Then, similar to NZG Models and Conrad Models three or four Mercedes-Benz sedans (the 230, 200, and 190) and the Gelandewagen SUV were introduced in 1:35 scale (Force 1990, 124-127; Gardiner and O'Neill 1996, p. 76). This marked Cursor's main focus on the production of miniatures mainly for promotional purposes. Apparently all three companies were taking similar marching orders from Mercedes-Benz on how the company wanted its promotional models standardized. A BMW 3 series coupe also was made by Cursor in the 1:35 scale. As was typical models usually had opening doors with tilting seats and realistic rubber tires (Gardiner and O'Neill 1996, p. 76).|$|E
25|$|Chevrolet honored California beach resorts {{once again}} by naming the top Chevelle series Laguna with the Malibu taking the middle spot while the base series was called simply Deluxe. In {{addition}} to the standard 350 2 barrel V8, Laguna models featured specific front and rear styling including a body-colored urethane front end concealing the new 5mph bumper system. On minor impact the urethane nose cone, backed up by shock- absorbing cylinders, deflects and rebounds; Laguna models also featured a specific <b>diecast</b> chrome grille with bowtie emblem, a body-colored (steel) rear bumper, front and rear bumper rub strips, bright roof drip moldings, bright wheel opening moldings, chrome taillight bezels, full wheel covers, and Laguna fender nameplates. Two Laguna station wagons were introduced, including a Laguna Estate. Laguna interiors were pattern cloth and vinyl or optional breathable all-vinyl upholstery, distinctive door trim with map pockets, deep-twist carpeting, woodgrain vinyl accents, and Laguna nameplates.|$|E
40|$|A {{cylindrical}} sleeve {{is a basic}} {{geometry of}} <b>diecasting</b> shapes. This paper describes the computer simulation of metal flow in a cylindrical sleeve cavity of pressure <b>diecasting,</b> in the cylindrical coordinates system.

40|$|The {{potential}} {{and the problems}} of the conventional <b>diecasting</b> process are well known. One of the most critical points is certainly the phenomenon of gas entrapping by the molten alloy during the filling of die cavity. The high speed reached by the molten alloy, together with the complex geometry of the die cavity, gives place to highly turbulent conditions. Thus, air and gases can be entrapped into casting, even if overflows are employed. Besides, the entrapped air significantly increases its pressure, making more difficult the progress of filling. The use of vacuum <b>diecasting</b> allows the significant improvement of diecastings quality, and is critically reviewed in this paper...|$|R
50|$|Eventually Vitesse was {{purchased}} by Sun Star Models of Macau, usually a maker of well-detailed 1:18 scale <b>diecasts.</b> Three former Vitesse lines are now supported by Sun Star: Vitesse Models, Vitesse Rallye, and Quartzo which does race car replicas.|$|R
25|$|Another {{departure}} from the Barris Batmobile was a single windshield and large, elevated bat-fins. Curiously, the car's underside was colored light blue, and it appeared to conceal the car's chassis except for a motorized panel, from which devices such as the Bat-winch would emerge. It is assumed Filmation's Batmobile used this light blue underside color to make the panel and devices easier to see. Additionally, the cockpit seating was a vibrant red, with a dashboard panel using bat accents around an inset monitor screen, among other details. Filmation's Batmobile used parachutes, inflatable pontoons and, in case of damaged tires, vertical and rear-mounted jets to lift and propel the car â which then essentially caused it {{to function as a}} high-powered hovercraft. The Filmation Batmobile from The Batman/Superman Hour {{was one of the few}} Batmobiles not to see adaptations to any DC Comics publications or have any commercially available replicas (toys, <b>diecast</b> cars, plastic model kits, etc.).|$|E
25|$|In {{the early}} 1990s AMT {{released}} brand new kits with new tooling {{for some of}} their old favorites, such as the 1955 Chevrolet Bel Air, 1966 Ford Fairlane GT, 1958 Edsel Pacer, 1960 Ford Starliner and 1957 Chrysler 300. These kits sold fairly well and can still be found on auction sites such as eBay at reasonable prices. The details in these kits far exceeded any from the 1960s. In the late 1990s AMT did something new in releasing pre-assembled and painted versions of these kits. These assembled models were sold as the Masterpiece Series and were nicely packaged in foam, similar to heavier <b>diecast</b> metal Franklin Mint or Danbury Mint models. Each had a Certificate of Authenticity enclosed. These models were beautifully finished and featured whitewall tires along with very detailed and authentically painted engines, suspensions and interiors, much more detailed than any promotional ever was, although these seem to be oriented to the adult collector and not the possible customer. Selections included a 1957 Chrysler 300C, 1960 Ford Starliner, 1962 Chevrolet Impala SS convertible, 1962 Pontiac Catalina SD421, 1966 Buick Riviera {{and a few others}} (Doty 2002b, p87). These ultra detailed models can still be had for less than $30.00 today on eBay and are one of the best bargains around. As assembled kits they were factory-glued together, but the glue used appears to be of high quality and when cared for properly they can be kept in good condition for years.|$|E
500|$|Kitmaster {{produced}} an unpowered polystyrene injection-moulded kit for 00 gauge from 1960. In late 1962, the brand {{was sold to}} Airfix, which resumed production in 1968. The moulds later passed to Dapol, which continues to produce the kit. Hornby manufactures ready-to-run rebuilt and un-rebuilt examples of the class and caters for all the major detail variations. Graham Farish produces ready-to-run models in N gauge, and Dapol has announced its intention to produce models in N gauge, slated for release in May 2012. Hornby Dublo produced <b>diecast</b> metal [...] "rebuilt" [...] West Countries in the 1960s, and those became Triang-Wrenn, and ultimately Wrenn Railways. Wrenn produced air-smoothed versions and rebuilt versions, right through to their demise (and subsequent sale to Dapol) in the early 1990s.|$|E
50|$|Rio {{started as}} a {{sideline}} business interest to a <b>diecasting</b> company in Cernobbio operated by the Tattarletti family starting about 1961 (Sinclair 1979, p. 388). Besides customary etymologies for the name 'Rio', the origin as a company name is unclear.|$|R
50|$|An {{improved}} version, the Mark II Austen, {{which had}} an accompanying dagger type bayonet {{that was designed}} to fit over the muzzle compensator was designed, expanding on the use of <b>diecasting,</b> and produced in limited numbers with only 200 examples of this model being produced.|$|R
40|$|A new and {{powerful}} tool is growing its relevance {{in the field}} of casting process design: the numerical simulation. The possibility of describing an industrial <b>diecasting</b> process by means of computational codes, well before of its experimental set up, gives fundamental information and support to the foundry engineer in designing the correct gating and feeding systems, in predicting the final quality of the casting, in improving the die life. An industrial application of this approach is presented in this paper, in which the MAGMASOFT code is employed for describing the fluid-dynamics and thermal fields induced in <b>diecasting</b> of an automotive transmission case. The outputs of numerical simulation, whose reliability have been checked by means of microstructural investigations, have been used for setting up the industrial process, which is currently running...|$|R
