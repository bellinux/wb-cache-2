5|$|Later, John and Tom {{get drunk}} {{and decide to}} kill Brandon. Lana {{attempts}} to stop them, but the pair drive to Candace's remote house where they find Brandon, who has been hiding in a nearby shed. John shoots Brandon under the chin, killing him instantly. Tom shoots Candace in the head as Lana fights with them, begging them to stop. Tom stabs Brandon's lifeless body and tries to shoot Lana but John stops him. John and Tom flee the scene while a crying Lana lies with Brandon's body. The next morning, Lana awakens next to Brandon's corpse. Her mother arrives and takes {{her away from the}} scene. As Lana leaves Falls City, a letter Brandon wrote to her is <b>heard</b> <b>in</b> <b>a</b> voiceover.|$|E
5|$|Ivan Shishman is {{the most}} {{prominent}} medieval ruler in Bulgarian folklore. His name is <b>heard</b> <b>in</b> <b>a</b> number of legends, myths, tales and songs. He is represented as a heroic ruler who fought and died for his country, facing overwhelming enemy forces. There {{are a number of}} places throughout Bulgaria named after the him, ranging from castles and ruins to rocks, caves and localities. That legendary “geography” is mainly concentrated in the region of Sofia, Ihtiman and Samokov, though it extends to the Rhodope Mountains, Sredna Gora, Vratsa, Pleven, Prilep, Varna, etc. Near Samokov are the ruins of “Shishman's Fortress” with the emperor's wells, which reputedly spouted from the ruler's seven wounds. Further north, along the cliffs and heights of the Iskar Gorge, are “Shishman's Holes”, the caves where he hid while fighting the Ottomans for seven years. Other related toponyms usually associated with the emperor's last stand are Kokalyane (derived from kokal, meaning “bone”), Cherepish (from cherep, “skull”) and Lyutibrod (“Fierce Ford”), all thought to be hinting at the fate of the perished Bulgarian troops.|$|E
25|$|Paul Dukas: The Sorcerer's Apprentice, widely {{recognized}} as used in the film Fantasia; the main melody is first <b>heard</b> <b>in</b> <b>a</b> famous bassoon solo passage.|$|E

25|$|The first {{complete}} {{performance of}} the suite at a public concert did not occur until 15 November 1920; the London Symphony Orchestra (LSO) was conducted by Albert Coates. This {{was the first time}} the movement Neptune had been <b>heard</b> <b>in</b> <b>a</b> public performance, all the other movements having been given earlier public airings.|$|E
25|$|In the 1963 horror-comedy The Old Dark House, {{part of the}} rhyme is <b>heard</b> <b>in</b> <b>a</b> tape {{recording}} played backwards while trying to discover {{the identity of the}} secret killer. In the film It (2017), it is used as background music throughout the film, when the shape shifting antagonist is near.|$|E
25|$|Partly {{because their}} unusual melody and heavy accented rhythms are unlike {{anything}} ever <b>heard</b> <b>in</b> <b>a</b> Manhattan revue before, partly {{because there is}} not a clue to their meaning except the gay rolling of Carmen Miranda's insinuating eyes, these songs, and Miranda herself, are the outstanding hit of the show.|$|E
50|$|A {{dispute over}} {{royalties}} {{for the song}} were <b>heard</b> <b>in</b> <b>an</b> Ohio court <b>in</b> 2014.|$|R

25|$|States {{are also}} {{protected}} against lawsuits by their sovereign immunity. Even where states waive their sovereign immunity, they may nonetheless {{have their own}} rules limiting standing against simple taxpayer standing against the state. Furthermore, states {{have the power to}} determine what will constitute standing for a litigant to be <b>heard</b> <b>in</b> <b>a</b> state court, and may deny access to the courts premised on taxpayer standing alone.|$|E
25|$|On February 20, 2009, KLSX {{changed its}} format to Top 40 (CHR) under {{economic}} pressures, and The Tom Leykis Show aired its final broadcast. The show ran Monday through Friday, 3:00 PM to 8:00 PM PT from Paramount Studios and 2:00 PM to 6:00 PM Saturdays in Hollywood, California and was <b>heard</b> <b>in</b> <b>a</b> {{number of major}} metropolitan markets on the West Coast of the United States.|$|E
25|$|Raven-Symoné {{performs}} {{most of the}} theme, while Brown {{performs a}} rap {{near the end of}} the theme and some scattered vocals in the beginning of the theme. Anneliese van der Pol sings the show's title in the chorus. A full-length version of this theme was <b>heard</b> <b>in</b> <b>a</b> music video which aired a few months before the show's U.S. premiere and also can be heard on the show's first soundtrack, released in 2004.|$|E
50|$|His {{music has}} also been <b>heard</b> <b>in</b> <b>an</b> episode of the final season of NBC's hit sitcom Parks and Recreation.|$|R

25|$|A snippet of a {{cue from}} Williams’ score to Cinderella Liberty titled 'Maggie Shoots Pool' is <b>heard</b> <b>in</b> <b>a</b> scene when William Holden's {{character}} converses {{on the phone with}} Paul Newman's character. It is not the recording on the soundtrack album but a newer arrangement recorded for The Towering Inferno. An extended version is heard, ostensibly as source music in a deleted theatrical scene sometimes shown as part of a longer scene from the TV broadcast version.|$|E
25|$|For civil matters, {{the repeal}} of section56A means that the Subordinate Courts Act no longer {{stipulates}} that constitutional questions must be referred to the High Court. However, this continues to be necessary in Magistrate's Court proceedings because these courts lack jurisdiction to deal with constitutional questions, as mentioned above. Assuming that declarations can be sought from District Courts, decisions {{that have been made}} by these courts may be appealed to the High Court and the Court of Appeal in the usual manner. Alternatively, a party apply to the High Court for the constitutional question to be <b>heard</b> <b>in</b> <b>a</b> separate action.|$|E
25|$|Another {{controversial}} area is {{the trailing}} interest issue. Trailing interest is the practice of charging interest on the entire bill no matter what percentage of it is paid. US Senator Carl Levin {{raised the issue of}} millions of Americans affected by hidden fees, compounding interest and cryptic terms. Their woes were <b>heard</b> <b>in</b> <b>a</b> Senate Permanent Subcommittee on Investigations hearing which was chaired by Senator Levin, who said that he intends to keep the spotlight on credit card companies and that legislative action may be necessary to purge the industry. In 2009, the C.A.R.D. Act was signed into law, enacting protections for many of the issues Levin had raised.|$|E

25|$|They were regulars on NBC's Monitor, {{often on}} {{stand-by}} {{to go on}} the air at short notice if the program's planned segments developed problems, and they were also <b>heard</b> <b>in</b> <b>a</b> surprising variety of formats and timeslots, from a 15-minute series in mid-afternoon to their hour-long show aired weeknights just before midnight in 1954-55. During that same period, they did an audience participation game show, Pick and Play with Bob and Ray, which was short-lived. It came at a time when network pages filled seats for radio-TV shows by giving tickets to anyone in the street, and on Pick and Play the two comics were occasionally booed by audience members unfamiliar with the Bob and Ray comedy style.|$|E
25|$|From {{its premiere}} {{to the present}} day, the suite has been enduringly popular, influential, widely {{performed}} and frequently recorded. The work was not <b>heard</b> <b>in</b> <b>a</b> complete public performance, however, until some {{years after it was}} completed. Although there were four performances between September 1918 and October 1920, they were all either private (the first performance, in London) or incomplete (two others in London and one in Birmingham). The premiere was at the Queen's Hall on 29 September 1918, conducted by Holst's friend Adrian Boult before an invited audience of about 250 people. The first complete public performance was finally given in London by Albert Coates conducting the London Symphony Orchestra on 15 November 1920.|$|E
25|$|Unlike the play, Scarpia shows Tosca the Marquise Attavanti's fan in Act 1, where Puccini's librettists {{contrive}} to {{have her}} return to the church following the departure of Angelotti and Cavaradossi. In the opera, both Cavaradossi's interrogation and torture and Scarpia's subsequent murder {{take place in the}} Farnese Palace. In the play, Cavaradossi's interrogation is set at his country house, where he was captured, while Scarpia's murder takes place at his apartment in the Castel Sant'Angelo. The news of the Austrian defeat at Marengo which formed the climax of Act 2 in La Tosca does not emerge in the opera until after Cavaradossi has been captured and tortured. Thus Scarpia is able to listen to Tosca's uninterrupted performance of the cantata (<b>heard</b> <b>in</b> <b>a</b> distant room of the palace).|$|E
50|$|The song is <b>heard</b> <b>in</b> {{the third}} {{episode of the}} first season of The Newsroom. The song is also <b>heard</b> <b>in</b> <b>an</b> episode of The Proud Family ("Makeover"), when Penny is giving a make-over {{to one of the}} Gross sisters.|$|R

25|$|Martin {{declared}} his vocation, {{and made his}} way to the city of Caesarodunum (now Tours), where he became a disciple of Hilary of Poitiers, a chief proponent of Trinitarian Christianity. He opposed the Arianism of the Imperial Court. When Hilary was forced into exile from Pictavium (now Poitiers), Martin returned to Italy. According to Sulpicius Severus, he converted an Alpine brigand on the way, and confronted the Devil himself. Having <b>heard</b> <b>in</b> <b>a</b> dream a summons to revisit his home, Martin crossed the Alps, and from Milan went over to Pannonia. There he converted his mother and some other persons; his father he could not win. While in Illyricum he took sides against the Arians with so much zeal that he was publicly scourged and forced to leave. Returning from Illyria, he was confronted by the Arian archbishop of Milan Auxentius, who expelled him from the city. According to the early sources, Martin decided to seek shelter on the island then called Gallinaria, now Isola d'Albenga, in the Ligurian Sea, where he lived the solitary life of a hermit.|$|E
25|$|On April 16, 1999, Siegel's widow Joanne Siegel, {{and their}} daughter, Laura Siegel Larson, filed a {{copyright}} termination notice. Warner Bros. contested this copyright termination, making {{the status of}} Siegel's share of the copyright {{the subject of a}} legal battle. Warner Bros. and the Siegels entered into discussions on how to resolve the issues raised by the termination notice. DC made a settlement offer to Larson and her family on October 16, 2001, and three days later, DC received a letter from Larson’s attorney accepting the offer, which included millions of dollars in payment in exchange for the copyrights. This offer was set aside by the Siegels at the last minute and in October 2004 they filed suit alleging copyright infringement on the part of Warner Bros. Warner Bros. countersued, alleging, among other arguments, that the termination notice contains defects. On March 26, 2008, Judge Stephen G. Larson of the Federal District Court for the Central District of California ruled that Siegel's estate was entitled to claim a share in the United States copyright. The ruling does not affect the international rights which Time Warner holds in the character through its subsidiary DC Comics. Issues regarding the amount of monies owed Siegel's estate and whether the claim the estate has extends to derivative works such as movie versions will be settled at trial, although any compensation would only be owed from works published since 1999. The case was scheduled to be <b>heard</b> <b>in</b> <b>a</b> California federal court in May 2008.|$|E
500|$|... "Regional Holiday Music" [...] {{received}} mostly positive {{reviews from}} critics, {{many of whom}} pleaded for the show to return.
