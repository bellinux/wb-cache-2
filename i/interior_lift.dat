50|$|After the war, Johnston made {{a direct}} appeal to Governor Lewis Cass of Michigan {{to have the}} {{restriction}} against his trading in the <b>interior</b> <b>lifted</b> because of his other services to the region, but to no avail. He suffered financially from his losses and reduced trading, and {{was never able to}} rebuild his former wealth. Although he applied to the British government for compensation for his losses, no payment was made. Believing he was too old to remove to Canada, he stayed in Sault Ste. Marie. In 1821 Johnston served as a Commissioner during negotiations to end the rivalry between the North West and Hudson's Bay companies and helped achieve their merger.|$|R
50|$|The central {{stairwell}} weaves {{around the}} lift well and has terrazzo treads and landings and features a grooved silky oak handrail with scrolled ends. The original lift is encased within a decorative lattice metal cage and retains its original <b>interior.</b> The <b>lift</b> operator lever mechanism within the lift chamber has been dismantled.|$|R
50|$|Interlocking {{metal pan}} roof systems {{installed}} on mobile homes can fail {{under the pressure}} differential (lift) created by the high velocity winds passing over the surface plane of the roof. This {{is compounded by the}} wind entering the building allowing the building <b>interior</b> to pressurize <b>lifting</b> the underside of the roof panels, resulting in destruction of the building. One example of pan roof systems can be found in this document from Structall Building Systems.|$|R
50|$|Dawson House (1944) is a {{sizeable}} brick building of two storeys with a basement, {{located on a}} sloping site behind Bostock House. The building is orientated {{to the north and}} is H-shaped in plan. The basement level is rendered and painted, {{while the rest of the}} building is dark face brickwork, harmonious with other brick buildings on the site. It has rendered strips painted cream which wrap around the building at the height of window sills and heads. The facade is symmetrical with pared-back classical architectural detailing around entry doors and some sets of windows. Each floor of the building has long central hallways with rooms of various sizes to either side. The building has two <b>interior</b> staircases, a <b>lift</b> and an external concrete fire escape stair. Windows throughout the building are multi-paned sash windows with painted cast iron security grills at low level.|$|R
50|$|STARS {{announced}} {{the arrival of}} its new donor funded AgustaWestland AW139 helicopter at the STARS Edmonton base in December 2012. The helicopter {{is the first of}} two new AW139 helicopters purchased by STARS for service in Alberta, with the second AW139 arriving in late 2013. The new helicopters will enhance access to emergency pre-hospital critical care through more rapid response, an expanded service area, a larger medical <b>interior,</b> more powerful <b>lift</b> capacity, and a de-icing system that will enable flight during adverse weather conditions. The first of the two AW139 helicopters is now operating in Edmonton, while the second is operating in Calgary. A third AW139, purchased through the support of Potash Corporation, is deployed to the Saskatoon base. The STARS crew consists of a critical care nurse, an advanced life support paramedic, and two pilots. Emergency referral physicians also fly with the crew on approximately 20 per cent of responses, and are available for telephone consultation during every mission.STARS captains have a minimum of 3,000 hours flying experience and are trained to fly with night vision goggles. The helicopters also have powerful search lights and can land on highways, fields or any area deemed safe.|$|R
40|$|International audienceChina {{has started}} a massive {{development}} of high-speed rail projects, {{as part of a}} stimulus package, to ease congestion on tracks and in the air, and to limit emission of greenhouse gases. It will affect the geography of China and on its cities. Experiences gathered in France by researchers of the " TGV effect " are put forward as questions to foster research on the changes induced by high-speed rail. A " shrinking of China " has begun. The 505 km Zhengzhou to Xi'an line has cut the travel time between these two cities from 6 to 2 hours. The 1069 km Wuguang line has slashed from 10, 5 hours to 3 the travel time between Wuhan and Guangzhou. By making it easier to move people and goods, railroad construction may gradually shift the center of economic gravity inland, accelerating the development of central and western China. As better transportation links encourage manufacturers to relocate away from the coast, demand for property in the <b>interior</b> may grow, <b>lifting</b> consumer sentiment and retail sales. High-speed rail may also be a boon for tourism : coastal cities in Fujian or Shandong could become resort towns for Shanghai or Beijing residents during week-ends, {{in the same way that}} the TGV- Méditerranée allowes Parisians to spend weekends on Mediterranean coast. High-speed train also means building new train stations. Will these new train stations become major nodes of economic activity in increasingly multi-centered metropolises ? What should be the links between high-speed rail and airports...|$|R
40|$|The {{predominant}} {{contribution to}} the frequency splitting of low-l solar p modes arises from {{the rotation of the}} solar <b>interior</b> and this <b>lifts</b> the frequency degeneracy in l to give a symmetric pattern where the observed (synodic) separation between adjacent m (i. e. for 1 ̄) is similar to 400 nHz. Magnetic fields can also contribute to the splitting, but they do so {{in such a way as}} to introduce asymmetries in the arrangement of the components within each multiplet. In disc-integrated data this effect may become apparent when lgreater than or equal to 2. Here, we attempt to extract estimates of the frequency asymmetries at l= 2 from the analysis of disc-integrated data collected by the ground-based Birmingham Solar Oscillations Network (BiSON) and the GOLF instrument on board the ESA/NASA SOHO satellite. Our analyses demonstrate that we have evidence for there being non-zero asymmetries present (significance approximate to 3 - 4 sigma) during an epoch coincident with high levels of surface activity close to the maximum of solar cycle 23. The asymmetries are indistinguishable from zero at minimum levels of activity near the cycle 22 / 23 boundary. We also compare the observed asymmetries with those calculated from a model that is based upon the recent predictions of Moreno-Insertis & Solanki. While the level of agreement between the two is found to be reasonable, the observations suggest (though with poor constraints placed upon this) that the influence on the mode frequencies of high-latitude activity may not be as strong as in the model...|$|R
