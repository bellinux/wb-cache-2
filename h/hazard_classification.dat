50|$|These Severity, Exposure, and Control {{definitions}} are informative, not prescriptive, {{and effectively}} leave some room for subjective variation or discretion between various automakers and component suppliers.

50|$|It is {{very toxic}} to mammals with a World Health Organization <b>hazard</b> <b>classification</b> as class IB, highly hazardous. It is {{classified}} as an extremely hazardous substance in the United States as defined in Section 302 of the U.S. Emergency Planning and Community Right-to-Know Act (42 U.S.C. 11002), and is subject to strict reporting requirements by facilities which produce, store, or use it in significant quantities.|$|E
50|$|Before the Globally Harmonized System of Classification and Labelling of Chemicals (GHS) {{was created}} and implemented, {{there were many}} {{different}} regulations on <b>hazard</b> <b>classification</b> in use in different countries, resulting in multiple standards, classifications and labels for the same hazard. Given the extent of international trade in chemicals and the potential impact on neighboring countries when controls are not implemented, countries determined that a worldwide approach was necessary.|$|E
50|$|Transportation of {{dangerous}} goods (hazardous materials) in Canada by road is normally a provincial jurisdiction. The {{federal government has}} jurisdiction over air, most marine, and most rail transport. The federal government acting centrally created the federal transportation {{of dangerous}} goods act and regulations, which provinces adopted {{in whole or in}} part via provincial transportation of dangerous goods legislation. The result is that all provinces use the federal regulations as their standard within their province; some small variances can exist because of provincial legislation. Creation of the federal regulations was coordinated by Transport Canada. <b>Hazard</b> <b>classifications</b> are based upon the UN Model.|$|R
40|$|Abstract. In this paper, {{a measure}} {{system based on}} {{acoustic}} resonance is developed for <b>hazards</b> materials <b>classification.</b> It employs the lock-in amplifier as core processor to collect the acoustic resonance spectroscopy (ARS) of sealed containers which storied hazards materials. The transmitter and receiver are coupled externally {{to the wall of}} the container. The transmitter generates the sound by using a swept frequency source. The receiver {{on the opposite side of}} the wall of the container can detect the transmitted signal. The acoustic properties of hazards materials such as velocity and attenuation can be learned from the observed spectrum signal. Then multivariate methods are used to evaluate pretreatment methods, such as normalization, and classification possibilities of data collected by ARS in a laboratory environment. Principal component analysis (PCA) shows that it is possible to observe differences between samples using the data acquired from the ARS system. Further results obtained from Linear Discriminant Analysis (LDA) show that the identification rates for <b>hazards</b> materials <b>classification</b> are 100 %. It is concluded that the ARS system has significant potential in the <b>hazards</b> materials <b>classification...</b>|$|R
30|$|Classification and {{labeling}} of hazardous substances {{according to the}} European Regulation on Classification, Labelling and Packaging [9] {{can be found in}} the publically accessible C&L inventory database according to REACH Title XI [13]. Classification and labeling is an ongoing process, leading to a continuous update of the data. Data used here were collected between August 2013 and June 2014. CAS numbers or EC numbers were used preferentially in the C&L inventory to find the respective <b>hazard</b> <b>classifications.</b> Ingredients with neither a CAS nor an EC number in the INCI list were searched with their INCI names in the C&L inventory. For reasons of clarity and comprehensibility, only the H phrases are presented here, without the GHS symbols.|$|R
5000|$|The GHS {{development}} {{began at}} the 1992 Rio Conference on Environment and Development by the United Nations also called Earth Summit (1992) when the International Labour Organization (ILO), the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD), various governments and other stakeholders agreed that [...] "A globally harmonized <b>hazard</b> <b>classification</b> and compatible labelling system, including {{material safety data sheets}} and easily understandable symbols, should be available if feasible, by the year 2000".|$|E
50|$|The Environmental Protection Agency has {{determined}} that exposure levels from eating crops treated with Naled are {{below the level of}} concern. With higher exposures, however, naled can cause cholinesterase inhibition in humans, which in turn can overstimulate the nervous system causing nausea, dizziness, confusion, and at very high exposures, respiratory paralysis and death. It has the UN <b>hazard</b> <b>classification</b> of 6.1 (inhalation hazard) and is prohibited for use as an insecticide within the EU.|$|E
50|$|The ICSC {{project is}} not {{intended}} to generate any sort of classification of chemicals. It makes reference to existing classifications. As an example, the Cards cite the results of the deliberations of the UN Committee of Experts on the Transport of Dangerous Goods with respect to transport: the UN <b>hazard</b> <b>classification</b> and the UN packaging group, when they exist, are entered on the Cards. Moreover, the ICSC are so-designed that room is reserved for the countries to enter information of national relevance.|$|E
40|$|This paper {{describes}} {{the process by}} which the safety requirements for a future motorway control system were derived. Although the problem domain was found to be amenable to standard analysis techniques, it was necessary to adapt the techniques used to allow for domain specific factors and behaviours, for example, the indirect nature of the causal link between a failure within the system boundary and the subsequent occurrence of an accident on the road. The process was based on domain-specific <b>hazard</b> <b>classifications,</b> a <b>Hazard</b> and Operability (HAZOP) study, Fault Tree Analysis (FTA), and other tools and techniques adapted to support their use within the road transport domain. The objective of the paper is to critically review the utility of the tools and techniques used during these specification activities, and provide guidance for their future use. ...|$|R
40|$|The knowledge-acquisition {{strategy}} {{developed for}} the Explosive <b>Hazards</b> <b>Classification</b> (EHC) Expert System is described in which expert systems and hypertext are combined, and broad applications are proposed. The EHC expert system is based on rapid prototyping in which primary knowledge acquisition from experts is not emphasized; the explosive hazards technical bulletin, technical guidance, and minimal interviewing are used to develop the knowledge-based system. Hypertext is used to capture the technical information with respect to four issues including procedural, materials, test, and classification issues. The hypertext display allows the integration of multiple knowlege representations such as clarifications or opinions, and thereby allows {{the performance of a}} broad range of tasks on a single machine. Among other recommendations, it is suggested that the integration of hypertext and expert systems makes the resulting synergistic system highly efficient...|$|R

5000|$|FHA is {{performed}} early in aircraft design, first as an Aircraft Functional Hazard Analysis (AFHA) {{and then as}} a System Functional Hazard Analysis (SFHA). Using qualitative assessment, aircraft functions and subsequently aircraft system functions are systematically analyzed for failure conditions, and each failure condition is assigned a <b>hazard</b> <b>classification.</b> Hazard classifications are closely related to Development Assurance Levels (DALs) and are aligned between ARP4761 and related aviation safety documents such as ARP4754A, 14 CFR 25.1309, and Radio Technical Commission for Aeronautics (RTCA) standards DO-254 and DO-178B.|$|E
50|$|FHA {{results are}} {{normally}} shown in spreadsheet form, with columns identifying function, failure condition, phase of flight, effect, <b>hazard</b> <b>classification,</b> DAL, means of detection, aircrew response, and related information. Each hazard is assigned a unique identifier that is tracked {{throughout the entire}} safety life cycle. One approach is to identify systems by their ATA system codes and the corresponding hazards by derivative identifiers. For example, the thrust reverser system could be identified by its ATA code 78-30. Untimely deployment of thrust reverser would be a hazard, which could be assigned an identifier based on ATA code 78-30.|$|E
50|$|The {{universal}} {{standard for}} all countries was to replace all the diverse classification systems; however, {{it has not}} been compulsory under UN law. The GHS provides the infrastructure for participating countries to implement a <b>hazard</b> <b>classification</b> and Hazard Communication Standard, which many less economically developed countries would not have had the money to create themselves. In the longer term, the GHS is expected to improve knowledge of the chronic health hazards of chemicals and encourage a move towards the elimination of hazardous chemicals, especially carcinogens, mutagens and reproductive toxicants, or their replacement with less hazardous ones.|$|E
40|$|Many remote technologies, units (satellites, aircrafts, etc.) and {{monitoring}} devices {{of different types}} are in everyday use for the observations, registrations and warning systems about the different natural <b>hazards.</b> <b>Classification</b> based on the philosophy âbeforeâ, âduring â and âafter â the disaster occurrence have been created. Most popular remote techniques and units are included giving the end users a possibility to use them for the comparative analysis between the different technologies and remote methods used. The generalization about {{the different types of}} the natural hazards is performed based on the principles of the generation mechanisms, physical properties and negative consequences they could create. Itâs clear that for some natural hazards the remote techniques are high effective, for others not so, for the rest â not at all.

40|$|Risk {{maps are}} spatial models of {{environmental}} hazards such as predation on livestock. We tested the long-term validity of a published risk map built from locations where Wisconsin wolves attacked livestock from 1999 - 2006. Using data collected after model construction, we verified the predictive {{accuracy of the}} risk map exceeded 91 % for the period 2007 - 2011. Predictive power lasting 5 years or more substantiates the claim that risk maps are both valid and verified tools for anticipating spatial <b>hazards.</b> <b>Classification</b> errors coincided with verifier uncertainty about which wolves might be responsible. Perceived threats by wolves to domestic animals were not as well predicted (82 %) as verified attacks had been and errors in classification coincided with incidents involved domestic animals other than bovids and verifier uncertainty about which wolves were involved. We recommend risk maps be used to target interventions selectively at high-risk sites...|$|R
40|$|Paradoxically, trace {{contaminant}} {{control systems}} that suffer unexpected upsets and malfunctions can release hazardous gaseous contaminants into a spacecraft cabin atmosphere causing potentially serious toxicological problems. Trace contaminant control systems designed for spaceflight typically employ {{a combination of}} adsorption beds and catalytic oxidation reactors to remove organic and inorganic trace contaminants from the cabin atmosphere. Interestingly, the same design features and attributes which make these systems so effective for purifying a spacecraft's atmosphere can also make them susceptible to system upsets. Cabin conditions can be contributing causes of phenomena such as adsorbent "rollover" and catalyst poisoning can alter a systems performance and in some in stances release contamination into the cabin. Evidence of these phenomena has been observed both in flight and during ground-based tests. The following discussion describes specific instances of system upsets found in trace contaminant control systems, groups these specific upsets into general <b>hazard</b> <b>classifications,</b> and recommends ways to minimize these hazards...|$|R
5000|$|Five of {{the deaths}} were caused by the {{collapse}} of recently constructed factory buildings. Stefano Gresta, president of the National Institute of Geophysics and Volcanology, deemed it [...] "unacceptable that modern constructions such as warehouses and industrial sheds have collapsed in an earthquake which was strong, but not exceptional". The area was not included in seismic hazard maps until 2003, when, after a reassessment, it was classified as [...] "medium risk", with a 10% likelihood of such an earthquake in the next 450 years. A law introduced in 2006 imposed building standards appropriate for the seismic <b>hazard</b> <b>classification,</b> but few of the older buildings have been upgraded to meet these requirements.|$|E
50|$|Cashmeran has a bio {{concentration}} factor (BCF) of 156 and an octanol/water partition coefficient (Log Kow) of 4.2, which makes that this material {{not a very}} persistent, very bioaccumulative (vPvB), nor a persistent bioaccumulating toxic (PBT) substance. Short term aquatic toxicity for cashmeran is >1 mg/kg for all species (Daphnia, algae and fish). Cashmeran has an environmental <b>hazard</b> <b>classification</b> (R51/53 according to the EU DSD or H411 according to the EU CLP).In this sense, Cashmeran's bio concentration and aquatic toxicity is even {{an order of magnitude}} more favourable than those substances considered as polycyclic musks, and therefore also does not meet those criteria for the materials considered to be included in that group.|$|E
50|$|Most {{sprinkler}} systems installed today are designed using an area and density approach. First the building use and building contents are analyzed {{to determine the}} level of fire hazard. Usually buildings are classified as light hazard, ordinary hazard group 1, ordinary hazard group 2, extra hazard group 1, or extra hazard group 2. After determining the <b>hazard</b> <b>classification,</b> a design area and density can be determined by referencing tables in the National Fire Protection Association (NFPA) standards. The design area is a theoretical area of the building representing the worst case area where a fire could burn. The design density is a measurement of how much water per square foot of floor area should {{be applied to the}} design area.|$|E
40|$|This paper {{proposes a}} {{methodology}} for flood risk assessment in a non fluvial urban flood. Two <b>hazard</b> <b>classifications</b> were considered; one with water depth and flow velocity classes and other with {{the product of}} water depth and flow velocity. The vulnerability assessment resulted in five classes obtained by cluster and principal components analysis. Flood risk maps were achieved by hazard and vulnerability classesâ crossover. The methodology is applied to {{a case study in}} the city of Vila Nova de Gaia. DTM with one meter resolution; HEC-HMS and HEC-RAS was applied to an urban catch- ment with one hour temporal scale; the 2001 statistical census tracts provide the demographic and social information. This methodology can be considered a straightforward and successful way to assess flood risk maps. However, the differences attained by the two hazard methods point out the need of further developments in the assessment of flood risk in stepped urban areas...|$|R
40|$|This {{document}} describes requirements, procedures, and {{supervisory responsibilities}} of the Oak Ridge National Laboratory (ORNL) Instrumentation and Controls (I&C) Division`s Technical Support Section (TSS) for instrument surveillance and maintenance in nonreactor nuclear facilities having identified Operational Safety Requirements (OSRs) or Limiting Conditions Document (LCDs). Implementation of requirements {{comply with the requirements}} of U. S. Department of Energy (DOE) Orders 5480. 5, 5480. 22, and 5481. 1 B; Martin Marietta Energy Systems, Inc.

OSRs and LCDs constitute an agreement or contract between DOE and the facility operating management regarding the safe operation of the facility. One basic difference between OSRs and LCDs is that violation of an OSR is considered a Category II occurrence, whereas violation of an LCD requirement is considered a Category III occurrence (see Energy Systems Standard ESS-OP- 301 and ORNL SPP X-GP- 13). OSRs are required for high- and moderate-hazard nuclear facilities, whereas the less-rigorous LCDs are required for low-hazard nuclear facilities and selected {open_quotes}generally accepted{close_quotes} operations. <b>Hazard</b> <b>classifications</b> are determined through a hazard screening process, which each division conducts for its facilities...|$|R

5000|$|When {{one or more}} of the {{automatic}} sprinkler heads is triggered, it opens allowing the air in the piping to vent from that sprinkler. Each sprinkler operates independently, as its temperature rises above its triggering threshold. As the air pressure in the piping drops, the pressure differential across the dry pipe valve changes, allowing water to enter the piping system. Water flow from sprinklers, needed to control the fire, is delayed until the air is vented from the sprinklers. In regions using NFPA 13 regulations, the time it takes water to reach the hydraulically remote sprinkler from the time that sprinkler is activated is limited to a maximum of 60 seconds. In industry practice, this is known as the [...] "Maximum Time of Water Delivery". The maximum time of water delivery may be required to be reduced, depending on the <b>hazard</b> <b>classification</b> of the area protected by the sprinkler system.|$|E

40|$|The United Nations has, during many years, {{developed}} {{a model for}} a globally harmonized system for classification and labeling of chemicals, with the aim of it becoming a global standard. This system is implemented in the European Union through the CLP-regulation and is now working parallel to the existing directives until 1 st of June 2015, when all the new classifications of substances and mixtures must be completed. The aim of this project was to adjust the laboratory to the new legislation, through inventory of stored chemicals, update the list of chemicals and perform self-classifications of mixtures. The work included handling of about 650 different chemicals with varying <b>hazard</b> <b>classifications</b> and search for information in corporate websites and chemical databases. This resulted in a new and complete list of chemicals stored and used in the laboratory and, in addition, an example of how to make a self classification of a mixture. Through this work using web based search for chemical classification according to the CLP-regulation, many difficulties were encountered and one of the conclusions is that due to the many noticed uncertainties and inconsistencies in self classification of mixtures the aim of keeping the globally harmonized system harmonized will be nearly impossible to fulfill...|$|R
40|$|This paper {{develops}} a systematic <b>hazard</b> interaction <b>classification</b> {{based on the}} geophysical environment that natural hazards arise from â the hazard-forming environment. According to their contribution to natural hazards, geophysical environmental factors in the hazard-forming environment were categorized into two types. The first are relatively stable factors which construct the precondition for the occurrence of natural hazards, whilst the second are trigger factors, which determine the frequency and magnitude of hazards. Different combinations of geophysical environmental factors induce different hazards. Based on these geophysical environmental factors for some major hazards, the stable factors are used to identify which kinds of natural hazards influence a given area, and trigger factors are used to classify the relationships between these hazards into four types: independent, mutex, parallel and series relationships. This classification helps to ensure all possible hazard interactions among different hazards are considered in multi-hazard risk assessment. This can effectively fill the gap in current multi-hazard risk assessment methods which to date only consider domino effects. In addition, based on this classification, the probability and magnitude of multiple interacting natural hazards occurring together can be calculated. Hence, the developed <b>hazard</b> interaction <b>classification</b> provides a useful tool to facilitate improved multi-hazard risk assessment...|$|R
40|$|A laser is {{a device}} that {{produces}} a coherent, intense, highly directional beam of light of a single wavelength or tunable over a band of wavelengths. These properties have made lasers highly useful tools for research and manufacturing. Lasers are found everywhere. Printers, compact disc players, bar scanners, laser pointers, and alignment lasers are commonly found at SLAC and {{are designed to be}} safe when used as intended. Also at SLAC, high-power, ultra-fast lasers are used in research and represent hazards that must be mitigated. This chapter describes these hazards and the methods used for their mitigation. 1. 1 Hazards / Impacts Laser hazards are related principally to the intensely powerful beam emitted, which can cause eye damage and skin burns. Related hazards include electrical currents, explosions, fires, toxic material, laser-generated air contaminants, collateral radiation, noise, and ultraviolet light. Information on these hazards can be found in related chapters of this manual. 1. 1. 1 <b>Hazard</b> <b>Classifications</b> Laser safety requirements are specified according to the classification of the laser (see Section 4, âDefinitionsâ) based on The ability of the laser beam to cause injury to the eye or skin. For example, a Class 4 laser is capable of causing greater injury than a Class 1 laser. The level of the laserâs accessible radiation. For example, a Class 1 laser system can contain an embedded Class 4 laser. ...|$|R
