The British telecommunication company have establish a submarine cable that linking Kota Kinabalu with Singapore and Hong Kong. Following {{the expansion of the}} Peninsular-based company on 1 January 1968, Sabah Posts and Telecommunication Department was merged with the Peninsular telecommunication department to formed Telecommunications Department Malaysia. All operations under Telecommunications Department Malaysia was then transferred to Syarikat Telekom Malaysia Berhad (STM) which become a public listed company in 1991 with the federal government retained a majority shareholding. There are also other telecommunication companies operating in the state although only providing cellular phone facilities. In 2006, the state has the lowest <b>Direct</b> <b>Exchange</b> <b>Line</b> (DEL) penetration rate, with cellular and internet dial-up penetrations rate only 6.5 per 100 inhabitants. Most residents from the low income groups would rather use mobile phones internet or use internet at their offices instead of setting up internet access at home as the Malaysian main internet provider of Telekom Malaysia were unable to build high speed low cost internet due to the high cost of equipment which are mostly sourced from abroad. Until the end of 2014, there were only 934 telecommunication hotspots in Sabah. Due to this, the government are working to increase the penetration and capability of internet connection as well {{to bridge the gap between}} Sabah and the Peninsular. The mobile telecommunications in Sabah are mostly use 4G and 3G and there is free rural Wi-Fi services provided by the federal government known as the Kampung Tanpa Wayar 1Malaysia (KTW) although Malaysia's public internet speeds are among the slower than many other countries.|$|E

A good forecasting model is helpful to portray Malaysian's acceptance towards communication facilities. Thus, this information can be fully utilised to structure some strategies to ensure Malaysians are benefited from the technologies {{no matter where they}} are. This paper reports on a study aimed to determine the telecommunication technologies demand among Malaysians and attempts to model such demand mathematically. Four telecommunication technologies investigated are <b>direct</b> <b>exchange</b> <b>line,</b> cellular phone, internet dial-up and internet broadband. Some statistical models studied include simple linear regression, quadratic regression,growth curve model and Holt's trend corrected exponential smoothing model. This study discovers that different telecommunication technologies indicate different patterns of demand with different acceleration. the penetration rate of cellular phone is suitable to be modelled by the Holt's method and the remaining technologies are suggested to perform quadratic behavior...|$|E
40|$|This paper {{reviews the}} recent history and {{development}} of the telecommunications sector in Malaysia. Section 2 provides a brief historical account of the sector and the current structure of the sector. This is followed by a discussion on regulatory reforms in Section 3. Section 4 examines the impact of reforms in the telecommunications sector. Section 5 concludes by discussing the future policy agenda for the sector. EVOLUTION OF INDUSTRY STRUCTURE Physical Expansion The infrastructure sector {{plays a key role in}} Malaysia's economic growth and development. The sector's share of development expenditure in the various five-years plans implemented since 1966 has fallen in the range between 18 per cent to as high as 34 per cent (Lee, 2000). This emphasis on infrastructure development notwithstanding, the expenditures appear to be targeted mainly at the transport and power sectors. As a result, telecommunications indicators - such as the fixed line penetration ratio - remained relatively low particularly before 1980 (Table 1). In 1970, the fixed line penetration ratio was merely 1. 3 per 100 population. This figure increased to 2. 9 per 100 population in 1980 and 8. 7 per 100 population in 1990. Significant gains in the fixed line penetration were made after telecommunications reforms were undertaken beginning 1987. By 1995 and 2000, the fixed line penetration ratio had risen to 16. 6 per 100 population and 21. 0 per 100 population respectively (note: the <b>direct</b> <b>exchange</b> <b>line</b> penetration rate is around 20 per 100 population). Concomitantly, cellular phone subscriptions have grown very rapidly since the early 1990 s. The total number of cellular phone subscribers stood close to 84, 557. By the year 2000, this had increased to 5. 1 million subscribers. Table 1 : Malaysia - Telecommunica [...] ...|$|E
40|$|Tanzania {{embarked}} on a liberalisation program of its different sectors including telecommunication industry during the mid 1990 's. The decision to privatise Tanzania Telecommunications Company Limited (TTCL), a state owned enterprise {{was based on the}} goal to improve its quality and quantity of services by way of private investor. Prior to TTCL's privatisation, the Government of Tanzania (GOT) undertook a US$ 250 million Telecommunication Restructuring Program (TRP) with assistance from the World Bank and international donors to revamp the telecommunication infrastructure and restructuring of TTCL. TTCL privatisation was advertised in the local, regional and international press and the sale process was managed and supervised by the Presidential Parastatal Sector Reform Commission (PSRC), a government body responsible with the privatisation of state owned enterprises. The advertisement attracted a number of bids and after evaluation the bid was won by a consortium of Celtel International (formerly MSI Cellular) of Netherlands and Detecon of Germany who offered US$ 120 million for a 35 % stake with a commitment {{to increase the number of}} <b>Direct</b> <b>Exchange</b> <b>Lines</b> (DELs) from under 162, 000 to over 800, 100 in a four year period. The Government in return handed over to the strategic investor both the board and management control of the company in February 2001 after the investor had paid US$ 60 million and a guarantee for the remaining balance after verification of company's year 2000 financial statement. TTCL was also given exclusivity period for the fixed line and international calls for a period of four years in order to allow for the costs of roll-out of telephone services to historically disadvantaged communities, to provide time for TTCL's restructuring prior to the introduction of competition and as an incentive to the strategic investor. This dissertation has analysed the telecommunication industry and failure of TTCL's performance after privatisation and recommends the way forward for the regulatory framework and improvement of company's performance...|$|R

Induced spin {{polarization of}} π-conjugated low-dimensional fragments {{is caused by}} <b>direct</b> <b>exchange</b> with Mn ions of LSMO(001) MnO-derived surface. Due to <b>direct</b> <b>exchange,</b> the pentacene molecule changes its diamagnetic narrow-band gap semiconducting nature to the ferromagnetic semiconducting state with 0. 15 eV energy shift between spin-up and spin-down valence bands and total magnetic moment of 0. 11 μB. <b>Direct</b> <b>exchange</b> converts graphene nanoribbon to 100 % spin-polarized half-metal with large amplitude of spin-up electronic density at the Fermi level.

30|$|There is now {{long-term}} follow-up {{evidence in}} favour of a <b>direct</b> <b>exchange</b> arthroplasty for infection. The results for <b>direct</b> <b>exchange</b> are comparable with a two-stage strategy [1, 2, 4, 8, 12, 17, 19, 21]. These reports suggest that <b>direct</b> <b>exchange</b> arthroplasty is likely to decrease the overall health care costs, reduce morbidity and technical difficulty associated with multiple surgical procedures [2, 4, 12]. Several factors which favour patient selection for <b>direct</b> <b>exchange</b> have been advocated also. These include good soft tissues with antibiotic sensitive organisms, especially gram-positive cocci, and minimal osteolysis. However, these selection criteria are not always applicable. Infected arthroplasty {{is often associated with}} osteolysis [12], especially so in a revision setting. Bone loss occurs due to a combination of infection, disuse and surgery itself. The greater the number of revision surgeries, the more bone is lost. A temporary spacer, as used in a two-stage procedure, can lead to an unstable joint especially in the presence of extensive osteolysis. Other issues e.g. age, poor soft tissues, comorbidities, antibiotic-resistant microorganisms can complicate this already difficult treatment group as well. Recent studies have indicated advantages with either of these methods, but there are no definite guidelines as to which method to be followed [1, 2, 4, 8, 12, 17, 21]. Additionally, there are no previous published results or guidelines for the salvage of infected revision arthroplasties associated with massive osteolysis.|$|R

Accurate simulation of radiative transfer is then of crucial importance for prediction of the thermal performances. In {{the last fifty}} years, several radiative heat transfer methods have been developed: discrete transfer radiation model [1], spherical harmonic P 1 approximation [2], discrete ordinates method [3], [4], non-equilibrium diffusion model [5], [6], effective-emissivity approximation [7], Monte Carlo method [8] and various zonal methods [9], [10], [11]. The Hottel zonal method is intended as a realistic scheme for calculation of radiant heat exchange with respect to spatially distributed heat release.

30|$|This {{procedure}} {{is not without}} challenges. Osteolysis, poor soft tissues and drug-resistant microorganisms can pose a problem with <b>direct</b> <b>exchange</b> arthroplasty. Osteolysis is often underestimated on preoperative radiographs. The exact extent is determined during surgery following debridement. This is exemplified by the two patients who underwent total femoral replacements; they had a minimal amount of viable non-infected femoral remaining after debridement as both had infected hip and knee revision prostheses. The morbidity after failed treatment of an infected revision arthroplasty is substantial, and <b>direct</b> <b>exchange</b> should be considered only in centres which deal with revision arthroplasty frequently.|$|R
