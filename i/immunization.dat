40|$|OBJECTIVES: This {{research}} {{was designed to}} evaluate the impact on health departments of {{the implementation of a}} 1999 policy requiring hepatitis B (HBV) vaccination for seventh grade school entry in the state of Missouri. METHODS: The authors employed a retrospective descriptive design using data from the Missouri Health Strategic Architectures and Information Cooperative (MOHSAIC) system. They based their assessment {{of the impact of the}} new policy on six outcome variables: total <b>immunizations</b> administered, HBV <b>immunizations</b> administered, HBV <b>immunizations</b> given to children ages 10 to 14, percentage of total <b>immunizations</b> that were HBV, percentage of total HBV <b>immunizations</b> that were given to children ages 10 to 14, and percentage of total <b>immunizations</b> that were HBV given to children ages 10 to 14. Outcome variables from the months of July through September 1998 were compared to similar data from the same period in 1999. RESULTS: Statewide, there was a significant increase in all outcome variables. Health departments in non-rural settings, however, did not have a significant increase in total <b>immunizations</b> (t = - 1. 49, p = 0. 158). The number of HBV <b>immunizations</b> did increase at health departments where alternative strategies (e. g., school-based programs) were used, but the increase was not as dramatic as for sites where no such strategies were employed. CONCLUSIONS: Implementation of a state policy requiring additional <b>immunizations</b> can be expected to have a significant impact on the resources of health departments statewide. The use of alternative strategies for managing <b>immunizations</b> outside the traditional health department setting can limit that impact...|$|R

40|$|Methods {{for light}} and {{electron}} microscopic identification and characterization of intestinal cholera antitoxin-containing cells (ACC) using peroxidase-labeled immunoreagent are described {{and used to}} study the ACC response in mice after <b>immunizations</b> with cholera toxin. Specific ACC appeared in significant numbers after two oral <b>immunizations</b> and increased six- to eightfold with two additional oral boosters, whereas further oral <b>immunizations</b> caused no additional stimulation. Intravenous <b>immunizations</b> had to be repeated seven times before ACC could be detected. After two oral <b>immunizations,</b> most of the ACC {{were found in the}} proximal part of the small intestine and no ACC were seen in the colon. This uneven distribution of ACC within the small intestine was eliminated after four oral <b>immunizations,</b> when ACC could also be detected in the colon. The ACC response after four oral <b>immunizations</b> demonstrated a peak at 4 days with far fewer cells present at 2 and 7 days. Electron microscopic studies showed that the ACC were mature plasma cells with the staining localized to the endoplasmic reticulum. Regression analysis {{of the relationship between the}} number of ACC and the magnitude of protective immunity against intestinal challenge with cholera toxin indicates a highly significant correlation (r = 0. 91, P less than 0. 001) ...|$|R

5|$|In Syria {{difficulties}} in executing <b>immunization</b> {{programs in the}} ongoing civil war led to a return of polio, probably in 2012, acknowledged by the WHO in 2013. 15 cases were confirmed among children in Syria between October and November 2013 in Deir Ezzor. Later, two more cases, one each in rural Damascus and Aleppo, were identified. It was the first outbreak in Syria since 1999. Doctors and international public health agencies report more than 90 cases of polio in Syria, with fears of contagion in rebel areas from lack of sanitation and safe-water services.|$|E

40|$|A vaccine against HIV {{is widely}} {{considered}} {{the most effective and}} sustainable way of reducing new infections. We evaluated the safety and impact of boosting with subtype C CN 54 rgp 140 envelope protein adjuvanted in glucopyranosyl lipid adjuvant (GLA-AF) in Tanzanian volunteers previously given three <b>immunizations</b> with HIV-DNA followed by two <b>immunizations</b> with recombinant modified vaccinia virus Ankara (HIV-MVA). Forty volunteers (35 vaccinees and five placebo recipients) were given two CN 54 rgp 140 /GLA-AF <b>immunizations</b> 30 - 71 weeks after the last HIV-MVA vaccination. These <b>immunizations</b> were delivered intramuscularly four weeks apart. The vaccine was safe and well tolerated except for one episode of asymptomatic hypoglycaemia that was classified as severe adverse event. Two weeks after the second HIV-MVA vaccination 34 (97 %) of the 35 previously vaccinated developed Env-specific binding antibodies, and 79 % and 84 % displayed IFN-γ ELISpot responses to Gag and Env, respectively. Binding antibodies to subtype C Env (included in HIV-DNA and protein boost), subtype B Env (included only in HIV-DNA) and CRF 01 _AE Env (included only in HIV-MVA) were significantly boosted by the CN 54 rgp 140 /GLA-AF <b>immunizations.</b> Functional antibodies detected using an infectious molecular clone virus/peripheral blood mononuclear cell neutralization assay, a pseudovirus/TZM-bl neutralization assay or by assays for antibody-dependent cellular cytotoxicity (ADCC) were not significantly boosted. In contrast, T-cell proliferative responses to subtype B MN antigen and IFN-γ ELISpot responses to Env peptides were significantly enhanced. Four volunteers not primed with HIV-DNA and HIV-MVA before the CN 54 rgp 140 /GLA-AF <b>immunizations</b> mounted an antibody response, while cell-mediated responses were rare. After the two Env subtype C protein <b>immunizations,</b> a trend towards higher median subtype C Env binding antibody titers was found in vaccinees who had received HIV-DNA and HIV-MVA prior to the two Env protein <b>immunizations</b> as compared to unprimed vaccinees (p = 0. 07). We report excellent tolerability, enhanced binding antibody responses and Env-specific cell-mediated immune responses but no ADCC antibody increase after two <b>immunizations</b> with a subtype C rgp 140 protein adjuvanted in GLA-AF in healthy volunteers previously immunized with HIV-DNA and HIV-MVA.

40|$|Improving {{childhood}} {{vaccination coverage}} and timeliness {{is a key}} health policy objective {{in many developing countries}} such as Uganda. Of the many factors known to influence uptake of childhood <b>immunizations</b> in under resourced settings, parents' understanding and perception of childhood <b>immunizations</b> has largely been overlooked. The aims of this study were to survey mothers' knowledge and attitudes towards childhood <b>immunizations</b> and then determine if these variables correlate with the timely vaccination coverage of their children. From September to December 2013, we conducted a cross-sectional survey of 1, 000 parous women in rural Sheema district in southwest Uganda. The survey collected socio-demographic data and knowledge and attitudes towards childhood <b>immunizations.</b> For the women with at least one child between the age of one month and five years who also had a vaccination card available for the child (N = 302), the vaccination status of this child was assessed. 88 % of these children received age-appropriate, on-time <b>immunizations.</b> 93. 5 % of the women were able to state that childhood <b>immunizations</b> protect children from diseases. The women not able to point this out {{were significantly more likely to}} have an under-vaccinated child (PR 1. 354 : 95 % CI 1. 018 - 1. 802). When asked why vaccination rates may be low in their community, the two most common responses were "fearful of side effects" and "ignorance/disinterest/laziness" (44 % each). The factors influencing caregivers' demand for childhood <b>immunizations</b> vary widely between, and also within, developing countries. Research that elucidates local knowledge and attitudes, like this study, allows for decisions and policy pertaining to vaccination programs to be more effective at improving child vaccination rates...|$|R
