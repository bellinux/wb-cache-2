25|$|While moneyness is a {{function}} of both spot and strike, usually one of these is fixed, and the other varies. Given a specific option, the strike is fixed, and different spots yield the moneyness of that option at different market prices; this is useful <b>in</b> <b>option</b> pricing and understanding the Black–Scholes formula. Conversely, given market data at a given point in time, the spot is fixed at the current market price, while different options have different strikes, and hence different moneyness; this is useful in constructing an implied volatility surface, or more simply plotting a volatility smile.|$|E

50|$|As an example, {{consider}} a bucket containing 30 balls. The balls are either red, black or white. Ten of the balls are red, {{and the remaining}} 20 are either black or white, with all combinations {{of black and white}} being equally likely. <b>In</b> <b>option</b> X, drawing a red ball wins a person $100, and <b>in</b> <b>option</b> Y, drawing a black ball wins them $100. The probability of picking a winning ball is the same for both options X and Y. <b>In</b> <b>option</b> X, the probability of selecting a winning ball is 1 in 3 (10 red balls out of 30 total balls). <b>In</b> <b>option</b> Y, {{despite the fact that the}} number of black balls is uncertain, the probability of selecting a winning ball is also 1 in 3. This is because the number of black balls is equally distributed among all possibilities between 0 and 20. The difference between the two options is that <b>in</b> <b>option</b> X, the probability of a favorable outcome is known, but <b>in</b> <b>option</b> Y, the probability of a favorable outcome is unknown ("ambiguous").|$|E
