5|$|A notable {{feature on}} the wall of the front porch on the ground floor is a <b>foot</b> <b>print</b> on a stone slab. It is said that this <b>foot</b> <b>print</b> belonged to a {{resident}} of the monastery, who was a water carrier, known as Chitenpa. He served in the monastery for a long time and on one fine day he announced that he had completed his service to the monastery and then stamped his left foot on the stone slab which created a dented formation of his step. This step is venerated as a miracle in view of a belief among the people of the region that such an imprint on a stone slab could only be created by a divine person who was a true devotee of the monastery.|$|E
25|$|The {{most widely}} known Western {{researcher}} to {{have attempted to}} document Orang Pendek is a British woman named Debbie Martyr. Along with British photographer Jeremy Holden, she engaged in a 15-year project {{beginning in the early}} 1990s and funded by Fauna and Flora International. The scope of the project was to systematically document eye-witness accounts of the animal and to obtain photographic proof of its existence via camera-trapping methods. Debbie and Jeremy did not succeed in proving its existence (Martyr has since moved on to head TNKS:s Tiger Protection and Conservation Unit), but they collected several <b>foot</b> <b>print</b> casts that reportedly appeared to be from Orang Pendek and claim to have personally seen the animal on several occasions while working in the forest.|$|E
