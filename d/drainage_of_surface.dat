Though, vertical curves are still designed as parabolic curves that are connected directly to the tangent (without transitions).

The resulting curve, called transitioned vertical curve, consists of transition-parabolic-transition segments. Detailed mathematical formulation and derivation of the instantaneous elevation, grade, rate of curvature, and offset from the first tangent at any point are presented. The highest (or lowest) point on a transitioned crest (or sag) vertical curve, where the instantaneous grade equals 0, is determined as it is of particular importance in highway drainage design. The minimum length of a transition curve is derived based on the criterion of driver comfort. In addition, guidelines are provided to identify the conditions where the <b>drainage</b> <b>of</b> <b>surface</b> water on transitioned curves can be a concern. Finally, the layout of the transitioned vertical curve is described and illustrated using two numerical examples. The new transitioned vertical curve, which exhibits striking similarities to the spiraled horizontal curve, should enhance the design of highway vertical alignments. ...|$|E

40|$|To better {{understand}} recent rapid recession of marine-terminating glaciers in Greenland, we performed satellite and field observations near the calving front of Bowdoin Glacier, a 3 km wide outlet glacier in northwestern Greenland. Satellite data revealed a clear {{transition to a}} rapidly retreating phase in 2008 from a relatively stable glacier condition that lasted for > 20 years. Ice radar measurements showed that the glacier front is grounded, but {{very close to the}} floating condition. These results, in combination with the results of ocean depth soundings, suggest bed geometry in front of the glacier is the primary control on the rate and pattern of recent rapid retreat. Presumably, glacier thinning due to atmospheric and/or ocean warming triggered the initial retreat. In situ measurements showed complex short-term ice speed variations, which were correlated with air temperature, precipitation and ocean tides. Ice speed quickly responded to temperature rise and a heavy rain event, indicating rapid <b>drainage</b> <b>of</b> <b>surface</b> water to the bed.

40|$|Malaria is {{the primary}} cause of ill health in Africa South of Sahara, causing an {{enormous}} health and economic burden. It is estimated that malaria causes up to 500 million-illness episodes and over 1. 2 million deaths annually worldwide. More than 90 % of these illnesses and deaths occur in Africa South of Sahara, the great majority in {{children under the age of}} 5 years (Lopes et al., 2006). In Tanzania, malaria is the leading communicable disease problem, affecting over 95 % of the population. A number of malaria epidemiological studies have been conducted in Tanzania, and mostly covering rural population of northeast and south-east Tanzania. There is a significant lack of knowledge on urban malaria in the country, except for Dar es Salaam and Tanga (Yamagata, 1996; Wang et al., 2006). It is estimated that over 33 % of the population in Tanzania live in urban areas (Mbogoro, 2002); this being two-folds the proportion lived in 1978. The rapid urbanization in many areas of the country brings about major changes in ecology, social structure and disease patterns. Such changes are likely to alter the frequency and transmission dynamics of malaria, with significant effects on disease-associated morbidity and mortality. It has been reported that uncontrolled urban population growth accompanied with poor housing and lack of sanitation and <b>drainage</b> <b>of</b> <b>surface</b> water can increase mosquito breeding places and human-vector contact (Keiser et al., 2004).

Data on malaria parasitaemia and transmission in many urban areas of Tanzania is scanty. Such information are urgently required to provide rational basis for the design, implementation and monitoring of malaria control programmes.

Model selection procedures revealed that environmental factors shaping body size variation in Cyprinidae differed according to the phylogenetic scale considered. At the higher phylogenetic level, we found that both temperature (negative effect) and habitat availability (positive effect <b>of</b> <b>drainage</b> basin <b>surface</b> area) constituted mechanistic explanations of large-scale body size distribution. No temperature-related body size cline was observed at the intragenus level.

Isotopic geochemical dating (35 S, 3 H, 14 C) and tracing (δ 13 C, δ 2 H, δ 18 O, δ 34 S) techniques are used to distinguish the origin of the groundwater and potential isolation or fracture connections. Isolated groundwater may show a dissolved gas signature similar to petroleum gas within the Bulgo Sandstone. To identify the geochemical impact of mine subsidence fracturing, pre and post mining profiles are being assembled for comparison. Groundwater age profiles also help to constrain and verify groundwater flow models. However, to produce useful 14 C dates from carbon dissolved in groundwater differences between carbon species (DIC dissolved inorganic carbon, DOC dissolved organic carbon and dissolved methane / ethane) caused by interaction with siderite in the aquifer are recognised and addressed. A nuclear geophysical logging technique, Prompt Gamma Neutron Activation Analysis (PGNAA) is also used to trace the flow of an injected salt solution into fractures and into the porous and permeable sandstone surrounding the borehole. The variable distance the salt tracer moves into the porous rock under a known pressure increase (above standing water level), over a known time and tracer volume allows calculation of hydraulic conductivity at 20 cm increments {{along the length of the}} borehole. If there is significant flow of the tracer into fractures and beyond the PGNAA measurement range a relative tracer movement distance is provided by the PGNAA log, rather than hydraulic conductivity. Other relevant lithological and hydraulic parameters such as porosity may be derived from measured Si, H, Cl, ±Fe, ±Al elemental abundance provided by PGNAA borehole logging. Borehole sampling of aquifer water at narrow discrete intervals for geochemical profiling requires isolating the aquifer segment or individual fracture flow from the rest of the borehole.

40|$|Hydrology is {{recognised}} as {{an important}} component of the glacial system in alpine environments. In particular, the subglacial <b>drainage</b> <b>of</b> <b>surface</b> meltwaters is known to exert a strong influence on the motion of glaciers and on their capacity to erode the underlying bedrock. This thesis examines the more poorly understood drainage system of the Greenland Ice Sheet, with specific focus on Leverett Glacier, a landterminating outlet glacier on the ice sheet’s western margin. Because of the vast size of the ice sheet, the influence of the drainage system could have wide ranging implications, most notably for sea level rise and continental scale landscape evolution. The thesis commences with an investigation into the morphology of the drainage system of the lower 14 km of Leverett Glacier. This is undertaken using a variety of field methods, including dye tracing and the monitoring of proglacial discharge, englacial water levels, surface melt rates and glacier motion. The data reveal that the drainage system of the glacier closely resembles that of alpine glaciers, undergoing an evolution from distributed to channelised drainage morphologies as the melt season progresses. Another aspect of the field data, the suspended sediment load evacuated from the subglacial system in the emerging proglacial river, is then examined to investigate the impact that this drainage system morphology has on the interaction between the glacier and the underlying bedrock or substrate. This demonstrates that the presence of large, efficient subglacial drainage channels allows for the removal of vast quantities of basal debris during much of the melt season, facilitating an erosion rate 1 - 2 orders of magnitude greater than previously proposed for ice sheet settings. The thesis then focuses on the relationship between discharge, water pressure and ice motion. Observations from Greenlandic and alpine glaciers demonstrate that glaciers generally decelerate through the melt season following a maximum velocity induced by the onset of melt in the spring. The data indicate that the evolution of the drainage system from a distributed to a channelised morphology occurs rapidly and so can only explain this trend in ice velocity during the early part of the melt season. Beyond this period, ice velocity patterns can instead be explained primarily by transient fluctuations in water pressure within the channelised drainage system. These transient pressure fluctuations result from the lag between changes to the rate of meltwater input to the glacier and the subsequent adjustment of channel cross section. This indicates that it is crucial to consider temporal variability in melt rate when seeking to link climate with the dynamics of ice sheets and glaciers. This process can be simulated, which is demonstrated by using the proglacial discharge record to model subglacial water pressure and ice velocity. In the following chapter, this model is built upon by considering how these variations in water pressure, originating in discrete subglacial channels, control sliding velocities across large areas of the glacier. Detailed examination of high-resolution ice velocity records from Leverett Glacier reveals that, in keeping with theory, horizontal ice velocity is dependent on both the volume of subglacial cavities and the rate-of-change of this volume. A simple model of subglacial water movement is then used to demonstrate how these changes in the cavity system could be driven by the pressure fluctuations predicted within the channelised drainage system. This enables a system scale model of glacier hydrology to be developed, which is presented in the final chapter, linking variations in surface melt rate to channel pressure, cavity volume and ultimately ice motion. In summary, this research has helped to illuminate the morphology and functioning of the drainage system of Leverett Glacier. This has improved our understanding of how hydrology influences both the motion of the Greenland Ice Sheet and its impact on the underlying topography, and enabled better prediction of how these processes are influenced by changes in climate...|$|E

To control ascites, drainage and intra-abdominal chemotherapy are often used in those patients but eradication of ascites is difficult and prognosis is poor. Case presentation A 55 -year-old woman was admitted to our hospital on 26 January 2007 with dyspnea, abdominal distention and oliguria. Abdominocentesis revealed peritoneal carcinomatosis resulting from abdominal recurrence from lung cancer. To alleviate the dyspnea and abdominal distention, we drained the ascites aseptically and infused them intravenously back into the patient after removal of tumor cells by centrifugation, and then concentration by apheresis. After the <b>drainage</b> <b>of</b> ascites, we intraperitoneally infused activated killer cells and dendritic cells from the patient's tumor-draining lymph nodes, together with 4. 5 × 10 5 U interleukin- 2 in 50 ml saline by 2. 1 ml/hour infuser balloon. Drastic decreases in the tumor cell count and in ascite retention were observed after several courses <b>of</b> ascites <b>drainage,</b> intravenous infusion and intraperitoneal immunotherapy. The plasma protein level was maintained during the treatment notwithstanding the repeated <b>drainage</b> <b>of</b> ascites.

40|$|Glaciological {{observations}} of under-flooding suggest that fluid-induced hydraulic fracture of an ice sheet from its bed sometimes occurs quickly, possibly driven by turbulently flowing {{water in a}} broad sheet flow. Taking the approximation of a fully turbulent flow into an elastic ice medium with small fracture toughness, we derive an approximate expression for the crack-tip speed, opening displacement and pressure profile. We accomplish this by first showing that a Manning-Strickler channel model for resistance to turbulent flow leads to a mathematical structure somewhat similar to that for resistance to laminar flow of a power law viscous fluid. We then adapt the plane-strain asymptotic crack solution of Desroches et al. (1994) and the power law self-similar solution of Adachi and Detournay (2002) for that case to calculate the desired quantities. The speed of crack growth is shown to scale as the overpressure (in excess of ice overburden) to the power 7 / 6, inversely as ice elastic modulus to the power 2 / 3, and as the ratio of crack length to wall roughness scale to the power 1 / 6. We tentatively apply our model by choosing parameter values thought appropriate for a basal crack driven by the rapid <b>drainage</b> <b>of</b> a <b>surface</b> meltwater lake near {{the margin of the}} Greenland Ice Sheet. Making various approximations perhaps relevant to this setting, we estimate fluid inflow rate to the basal fracture and vertical and horizontal surface displacements and find order-of-magnitude agreement with observations by Das et al.
