5|$|Subfossil {{remains of}} the King Island emu show that the tibia was about 330mm (13in) long, and the femur was 180mm (7in) long. The pelvis was 280mm (11in) long, 64mm (2.5in) wide at the front, and 86mm (3in) wide at the back. The tarsometatarsus {{averaged}} 232mm (9in) in length. In males, the tibiotarsus averaged 261mm (10in), whereas it averaged 301mm (12in) in females. In contrast, the same bones measured 269mm (10.5in) and 305mm (12in) in the <b>Kangaroo</b> <b>Island</b> <b>emu.</b> Apart from being smaller, the King Island emu differed osteologically from the <b>Kangaroo</b> <b>Island</b> <b>emu</b> in the intertrochlear foramen of the tarsometatarsus usually being fully or partially abridged. The outer trochlea was more incurved towards the middle trochlea in the Kangaroo Island bird, whereas they were parallel in the King Island emu.|$|E
5|$|The Australian amateur ornithologist Gregory Mathews coined further {{names in}} the early 1910s, {{including}} a new genus name, Peronista, as he believed the King and Kangaroo Island birds were generically distinct from the mainland emu. Later writers claimed that the subfossil remains found on King and Kangaroo Islands were not discernibly different, and that they therefore belonged to the same taxon. In 1959, the French ornithologist Christian Jouanin proposed {{that none of the}} skins were actually from Kangaroo Island, after inspecting expedition and museum documents. In 1990, Jouanin and Jean-Christophe Balouet used environmental forensics to demonstrate that the mounted skin in Paris came from King Island, and that at least one live bird had been brought from each island. All scientific names given to the <b>Kangaroo</b> <b>Island</b> <b>emu</b> were therefore based on specimens from King Island or were otherwise invalid, leaving it nameless. More recent finds of subfossil material and subsequent studies on King and <b>Kangaroo</b> <b>Island</b> <b>emu,</b> notably by Shane A. Parker in 1984, confirmed their separate geographic origin and distinct morphology. Parker named the Kangaroo Island bird Dromaiusbaudinianus, after Nicolas Baudin, the leader of the French expedition. The name Dromaius ater was kept for the King Island emu.|$|E
5|$|The King Island emu was the {{smallest}} of all emus, and had darker plumage than the mainland emu.

The subspecies was distinct from the likewise diminutive <b>Kangaroo</b> <b>Island</b> <b>emu</b> (D. n. baudinianus) {{in a number of}} osteological details, including size. The behaviour of the King Island emu probably did not differ much from that of the mainland emu. The birds gathered in flocks to forage and during breeding time. They fed on berries, grass and seaweed. They ran swiftly, and could defend themselves by kicking. The nest was shallow, and consisted of dead leaves and moss. Seven to nine eggs were laid, which were incubated by both parents.|$|E

5000|$|The <b>Kangaroo</b> <b>Island</b> dunnart {{is listed}} as {{critically}} endangered by The IUCN Red List of Threatened Species. It is believed that there are fewer than 500 individuals. There are six sites on the western portion of <b>Kangaroo</b> <b>Island</b> were <b>Kangaroo</b> <b>Island</b> dunnart are found. The <b>Kangaroo</b> <b>Island</b> dunnart was believed to {{have a range of}} the entire island at one time. There are several causes to which the population decreased is attributed. Habitat loss is believed {{to be one of the}} primary caused of the decrease in <b>Kangaroo</b> <b>Island</b> dunnart population. Although, no clear habitat preference has been identified for <b>Kangaroo</b> <b>Island</b> dunnarts, they do seem to be depend on some low vegetation. The eastern portion of <b>Kangaroo</b> <b>Island</b> has been largely converted from the natural habitat for agricultural and grazing purposes. 50% of <b>Kangaroo</b> <b>Islands</b> natural habitat has been cleared. <b>Kangaroo</b> <b>Island</b> dunnarts have not been found in the cleared regions. Also, tree dieback caused by Phytophthora cinnamomi, a water mould, has also affected <b>Kangaroo</b> <b>Island</b> dunnart populations. Feral cats may also be a factor in the decreased population. <b>Kangaroo</b> <b>Island</b> dunnart populations are considered particularly vulnerable: because due to their small range a single event can negatively affect a large portion of the population. Forest fire is a major concern for this reason. Forest fires are believed to have impacted the population previously. The Australian government first developed a recovery plan for the <b>Kangaroo</b> <b>Island</b> dunnart in 2011.|$|R

The tarsus of the King Island emu was also three times longer than the culmen, whereas it was four times longer in the mainland emu. Additional traits that supposedly distinguish this bird from the mainland emu have previously been suggested to be the distal foramen of the tarsometatarsus, and the contour of the cranium. However, the distal foramen is known to be variable in the mainland emu showing particular diversity between juvenile and adult forms and is therefore taxonomically insignificant. The same is true of the contour of the cranium, which is more dome-shaped in the King Island emu, a feature that is also seen in juvenile mainland emus.|$|E

The caption states the birds shown are from [...] "Ile Decrès", the French name for Kangaroo Island, but there is confusion over what is actually depicted.
