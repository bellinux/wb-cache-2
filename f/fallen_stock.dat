40|$|The {{continuous}} monitoring of <b>fallen</b> <b>stock</b> mortality in bovine farms {{has been demonstrated}} in different studies to have potential as {{an important component of}} veterinary syndromic surveillance. However, as far as we know, the usefulness of these systems to detect abnormal events in near real-time in the field has not been assessed. To implement this type of system, a number of challenges must be faced. The main difficulties are associated with the non-specific nature of <b>fallen</b> <b>stock</b> data, since multiple events may cause bovine mortality at farm level. Moreover, these data are originated from heterogeneous subpopulations that can be clustered and studied in accordance with different traits (e. g. production type, type of farm and/or individuals, husbandry and environmental conditions, or administrative level). In this study, we present the main pillars of a syndromic system to collect continuous <b>fallen</b> <b>stock</b> data from a specific region and to model time series and detect abnormal events at large and small scale...|$|E
40|$|International audienceThe {{abattoir}} and the <b>fallen</b> <b>stock</b> surveys {{constitute the}} active surveillance component {{aimed at improving}} the detection of scrapie across the European Union. Previous studies have suggested the occurrence of {{significant differences in the}} operation of the surveys across the EU. In the present study we assessed the standardisation of the surveys throughout time across the EU and identified clusters of countries with similar underlying characteristics allowing comparisons between them. In the absence of sufficient covariate information to explain the observed variability across countries, we modelled the unobserved heterogeneity by means of non-parametric distributions on the risk ratios of the <b>fallen</b> <b>stock</b> over the abattoir survey. More specifically, we used the profile likelihood method on 2003, 2004 and 2005 active surveillance data for 18 European countries on classical scrapie, and on 2004 and 2005 data for atypical scrapie separately. We extended our analyses to include the limited covariate information available, more specifically, the proportion of the adult sheep population sampled by the <b>fallen</b> <b>stock</b> survey every year. Our results show that the between-country heterogeneity dropped in 2004 and 2005 relative to that of 2003 for classical scrapie. As a consequence, the number of clusters {{in the last two years}} was also reduced indicating the gradual standardisation of the surveillance efforts across the EU. The crude analyses of the atypical data grouped all the countries in one cluster and showed non-significant gain in the detection of this type of scrapie by any of the two sources. The proportion of the population sampled by the <b>fallen</b> <b>stock</b> appeared significantly associated with our risk ratio for both types of scrapie, although in opposite directions: negative for classical and positive for atypical. The initial justification for the <b>fallen</b> <b>stock,</b> targeting a high-risk population to increase the likelihood of case finding, appears compromised for both types of scrapie in some countries...|$|E
40|$|Abstract Background So-called {{atypical}} scrapie {{was first}} identified in Great Britain (GB) in 2002 following {{the introduction of}} wide-scale scrapie surveillance. In particular, abattoir and <b>fallen</b> <b>stock</b> surveys {{have been carried out}} in GB since 2002, with a total of 147 atypical positives identified by the end of 2006. The results of these surveys provide data with which to assess temporal trends in the prevalence of atypical scrapie in sheep in Great Britain between 2002 and 2006. Results Using the results of abattoir and <b>fallen</b> <b>stock</b> surveys, the prevalence of atypical scrapie (percentage of samples positive) was estimated. The prevalence in the abattoir and <b>fallen</b> <b>stock</b> surveys, for all years combined, was 0. 09 % (95 % confidence interval (CI) : 0. 08 %– 0. 11 %) and 0. 07 % (95 % CI: 0. 05 %– 0. 11 %), respectively. There were no significant temporal trends in either survey. Comparing the surveys' results, {{there were no significant differences}} in annual prevalence or the prevalence within PrP genotypes. For the abattoir survey, the PrP genotype with the highest prevalence was AHQ/AHQ, which was significantly higher than all other genotypes, except ARR/AHQ, AHQ/ARH and ARH/ARQ. Conclusion The estimated prevalence of atypical scrapie was similar in both the abattoir and <b>fallen</b> <b>stock</b> surveys. Our results indicate there was no significant temporal trend in prevalence, adding to evidence that this atypical form of scrapie may be a sporadic condition or, if it is infectious, that the force of infection is very low. </p...|$|E

40|$|A {{comparison}} of rapid {{bovine spongiform encephalopathy}} testing methods on autolyzed bovine brain tissue Angus Wear 1, Kirstine Henderson, Kath Webster, Indu Patel Abstract. In 1999, the European Union (EU) approved 3 rapid methods for the testing of bovine brain samples {{for the presence of}} bovine spongiform encephalopathy (BSE). The evaluation that led to the approval did not include an analysis of autolyzed material. Member states of the EU have active surveillance programs for BSE, which target <b>fallen</b> <b>stock</b> as well as other categories of cattle. Autolysis is a common feature of <b>fallen</b> <b>stock</b> samples because there can be a considerable delay between death and collection of samples. Therefore, {{it is important to know}} whether these tests perform optimally on autolyzed samples. The Veterinary Laboratories Agency (VLA) selected 250 positive <b>fallen</b> <b>stock</b> samples. These had been detected during routine testing using the Prionicst-Check Western blot and confirmed as BSE cases by immunohistochemistry or electron micros-copy. Samples were graded according to the degree of autolysis and then tested by the 3 methods: Prionicst-Check Western blot, Platelia test, and Enfer test. All 3 methods correctly classified the samples as positive BSE cases, therefore alleviating doubt about their ability to do so. Subsequent EU validation exercises, such as those conducted in 2002 – 2003, have included the testing of autolyzed material. It is important that all new methods be evaluated on autolyzed tissue before approval for official use. Key words: Autolysis; bovine spongiform encephalopathy; brain; BSE; rapid tests...|$|E

All <b>fallen</b> <b>stock</b> brains were systematically examined by histopathology to obtain reliable data on histologically identifiable brain lesions. Lesions were found in an unexpectedly high number of animals (8. 1 % of all examined brains). A wide spectrum of diseases was detected showing that this approach provides an excellent opportunity to screen for the prevalence of neurological diseases. Encephalitic listeriosis was by far the most frequent cause of CNS lesions in both species and its prevalence was unexpectedly high when compared to notified confirmed cases. In conclusion, the prevalence of listeriosis as estimated by passive surveillance based on the notification of clinical suspects has been underestimated in the past...|$|E
40|$|Recently, {{screening}} tests for monitoring {{the prevalence of}} transmissible spongiform encephalopathies specifically in sheep and goats became available. Although most countries require comprehensive test validation prior to approval, {{little is known about}} their performance under normal operating conditions. Switzerland {{was one of the first}} countries to implement 2 of these tests, an enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) and a Western blot, in a 1 -year active surveillance program. Slaughtered animals (n = 32, 777) were analyzed in either of the 2 tests with immunohistochemistry for confirmation of initial reactive results, and <b>fallen</b> <b>stock</b> samples (n = 3, 193) were subjected to both {{screening tests}} and immunohistochemistry in parallel. Initial reactive and false-positive rates were recorded over time. Both tests revealed an excellent diagnostic specificity (> 99. 5 %). However, initial reactive rates were elevated at the beginning of the program but dropped to levels below 1 % with routine and enhanced staff training. Only those in the ELISA increased again in the second half of the program and correlated with the degree of tissue autolysis in the <b>fallen</b> <b>stock</b> samples. It is noteworthy that the Western blot missed 1 of the 3 atypical scrapie cases in the <b>fallen</b> <b>stock,</b> indicating potential differences in the diagnostic sensitivities between the 2 screening tests. However, an estimation of the diagnostic sensitivity for both tests on field samples remained difficult due to the low disease prevalence. Taken together, these results highlight the importance of staff training, sample quality, and interlaboratory comparison trials when such screening tests are implemented in the field...|$|E
40|$|Abstract Background Two annual surveys, the {{abattoir}} and the <b>fallen</b> <b>stock,</b> {{monitor the}} presence of scrapie across Europe. A simple comparison between the prevalence estimates in different countries reveals that, in 2003, the abattoir survey appears to detect more scrapie in some countries. This is contrary to evidence suggesting the greater ability of the <b>fallen</b> <b>stock</b> survey to detect the disease. We applied meta-analysis techniques to study this apparent heterogeneity in the behaviour of the surveys across Europe. Furthermore, we conducted a meta-regression analysis to assess the effect of country-specific characteristics on the variability. We have chosen the odds ratios between the two surveys to inform the underlying relationship between them and to allow comparisons between the countries under the meta-regression framework. Baseline risks, those of the slaughtered populations across Europe, and country-specific covariates, available from the European Commission Report, were inputted in the model to explain the heterogeneity. Results Our results show {{the presence of}} significant heterogeneity in the odds ratios between countries and no reduction in the variability after adjustment for the different risks in the baseline populations. Three countries contributed the most to the overall heterogeneity: Germany, Ireland and The Netherlands. The inclusion of country-specific covariates did not, in general, reduce the variability except for one variable: {{the proportion of the}} total adult sheep population sampled as <b>fallen</b> <b>stock</b> by each country. A large residual heterogeneity remained in the model indicating the presence of substantial effect variability between countries. Conclusion The meta-analysis approach was useful to assess the level of heterogeneity in the implementation of the surveys and to explore the reasons for the variation between countries. </p...|$|E
40|$|An {{experiment}} {{was conducted to}} determine the effects of 5 consecutive years of summer grazing date and <b>fall</b> <b>stocking</b> rate on vegetation and dietary crude protein content of cows grazing rangeland in the Nebraska Sandhills.

The paddocks were then grazed in the <b>fall</b> at <b>stocking</b> rates of 0. 0 AUM ha- 1, 1. 0 AUM ha-l, 2. 0 AUM ha- 1, or 3 AUM ha-l. Summer grazing date does not appear to consistently affect herbage production, fall standing crop, herbage disappearance, or fall diet quality. <b>Fall</b> <b>stocking</b> rate reduced cool-season graminoid production although this effect appears to require 3 to 5 consecutive years of fall grazing. Disappearance increased with increasing <b>fall</b> <b>stocking</b> rate by year 5 of the experiment. Crude protein content of fall diets declines with increasing fall grazing pressure but does not appear to be dictated by summer grazing date. Animal intake of fall herbage appeared to be restricted to some degree by low quality forage. ^ In the second experiment, botanical composition, root mass-density, and carbon/nitrogen budgets were compared between cool-season and warm-season subirrigated meadows in the Sandhills. Vegetation yields and composition were sampled at each of 5 cool-season and 5 warm-season meadows.

40|$|Estimates for the {{prevalence}} of sheep infected with classical scrapie are essential for assessing the efficacy of control strategies that have been implemented in Great Britain (GB). Here a back-calculation approach was used to estimate {{the prevalence}} in the GB national flock by integrating data on reported cases {{and the results of}} abattoir and <b>fallen</b> <b>stock</b> surveys for 2002. Prevalence estimates ranged from 0. 33 to 2. 06 %, depending on the estimates used for the frequencies of prion protein (PrP) genotypes in the national flock and the stage of incubation at which the diagnostic tests used are able to detect infected animals. The risk of infection was found to be higher than that of clinical disease, especially in those PrP genotypes that have a later age at onset of clinical disease. Moreover, results suggest that a high proportion (more than 55 %) of infected animals surviving to disease onset die on farm before clinical signs become apparent, which helps account for the high observed prevalence in the <b>fallen</b> <b>stock</b> compared with the abattoir survey. The analyses indicated that attention needs to be given to identifying the stage of incubation at which diagnostic tests are able to detect infected animals and obtaining better demographic data for the GB national flock...|$|E
40|$|Abstract Background This paper {{explores the}} spatial {{distribution}} of sampling within the active surveillance of sheep scrapie in Great Britain. We investigated the geographic distribution of the birth holdings of sheep sampled for scrapie during 2002 – 2005, including samples taken in abattoir surveys (c. 83, 100) and from sheep that died in the field ("fallen stock", c. 14, 600). We mapped the birth holdings by county and calculated the sampling rate, defined as {{the proportion of the}} holdings in each county sampled by the surveys. The Moran index was used to estimate the global spatial autocorrelation across Great Britain. The contributions of each county to the global Moran index were analysed by a local indicator of spatial autocorrelation (LISA). Results The sampling rate differed among counties in both surveys, which affected the distribution of detected cases of scrapie. Within each survey, the county sampling rates in different years were positively correlated during 2002 – 2005, with the abattoir survey being more strongly autocorrelated through time than the <b>fallen</b> <b>stock</b> survey. In the abattoir survey, spatial indices indicated that sampling rates in neighbouring counties tended to be similar, with few significant contrasts. Sampling rates were strongly correlated with sheep density, being highest in Wales, Southwest England and Northern England. This relationship with sheep density accounted for over 80 % of the variation in sampling rate among counties. In the <b>fallen</b> <b>stock</b> survey, sampling rates in neighbouring counties tended to be different, with more statistically significant contrasts. The <b>fallen</b> <b>stock</b> survey also included a larger proportion of holdings providing many samples. Conclusion Sampling will continue to be uneven unless action is taken to make it more uniform, if more uniform sampling becomes a target. Alternatively, analyses of scrapie occurrence in these datasets can take account of the distribution of sampling. Combining the surveys only partially reduces uneven sampling. Adjusting the distribution of sampling between abattoirs to reduce the bias in favour of regions with high sheep densities could probably achieve more even sampling. However, any adjustment of sampling should take account of the current understanding of the distribution of scrapie cases, which will be improved by further analysis of this dataset. </p...|$|E

Flight-to-quality is present if correlations between stocks and bonds strongly decrease in <b>falling</b> <b>stock</b> markets since this constitutes a movement of the asset classes in opposite directions. A movement {{in the same direction}} characterized by strongly increasing correlations in <b>falling</b> <b>stock</b> markets implies contagion across asset classes. We estimate dynamic conditional correlations and analyze normal and extreme changes of these correlations through time without an a priori specification of any crisis period. Daily MSCI stock and government bond returns are analyzed for a selection of European countries and the US. Our findings show that the correlation between the asset classes is characterized by large fluctuations and negative on average for the whole sample period. Extreme negative and positive correlation changes explained with flight-to-quality and contagion are relatively frequent phenomena. Examples of flight-to-quality are in the Asian and Russian crisis 1997 and 1998 and contagion is found after September 11. Controlling for the regime of correlations further shows that stock market volatility contributes to flight-to-quality and bond volatility to contagion. flight-to-quality, contagion, multivariate GARCH...|$|R
40|$|Consumption of <b>fallen</b> <b>stock</b> {{could be}} an {{important}} route for zoonotic infections to enter human populations. Qualitative and Quantitative risk assessments were performed {{in order to determine}} the risk to human health via consumption of <b>fallen</b> <b>stock</b> and identify potential methods for mitigating risk. After initial hazard identification (disease selection) three pathogens were chosen for assessment; two for qualitative and one for quantitative. Influenza A (H 5 N 1) and the prion causing Bovine Spongiform Encephalopathy (BSE) and variant Creutzfeldt-Jakob Disease (vCJD) were chosen for qualitative assessment. Bacillus anthracis was chosen for quantitative assessment. The qualitative assessments were designed to answer the question: “In the scenario of a disease outbreak amongst livestock, what is the risk of one or more human cases (and deaths) occurring due to the preparation and consumption of fallen stock”. The quantitative model was designed to provide probability of infection and subsequent death with Gastro-Intestinal (GI) Anthrax occurring in individuals consuming meat from fallen cattle, whilst also predicting the number of cases and deaths occurring in Western Province (WP), Zambia. The Risk from H 5 N 1 was determined to be “low” to “medium”, and the risk from the prion causing BSE was “very low”. Results from the quantitative assessment suggest that mean individual risk of infection with GI Anthrax is less than 1 in 10, 000, 00 but that the probability of infection given consumption of an infected carcass was 1 in 4695. The mean probability of at least one case of GI Anthrax occurring in WP was 1 in 9. Sensitivity analysis of the quantitative model suggested that the ingested dose of B. anthracis was the most important determinant of disease, and that the ingested dose was most affected by spore reduction during cooking. Qualitative assessment also suggested that risk could be reduced by taking precautions when preparing and consuming meat from infected animals including careful butchery and ensuring meat is properly cooked.
