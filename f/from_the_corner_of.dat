5|$|A Bypass M-21 (Byp. M-21) {{designation}} {{was created}} in the Grand Rapids area in 1945. This designation ran <b>from</b> <b>the</b> <b>corner</b> <b>of</b> 28th Street and Chicago Drive along Byp. US16 and Byp. US131 on 28th Street. At East Beltline Avenue, Byp. US131/Byp. M-21 turned north back to M-21. M-21A in Flint was turned over to local control in 1948, decommissioning the number. The Byp. M-21 routing was replaced by M-21 in 1953. The former routing in Grand Rapids became Bus. M-21 instead.|$|E

Yaya Touré unleashed a 30-yard strike in the 11th minute which went only inches wide of the top corner of the goal, while Mario Balotelli had a curling shot <b>from</b> <b>the</b> <b>corner</b> <b>of</b> the penalty area in the 24th minute which was destined for the goal but for a strong, one-handed save from Sørensen.|$|E

5|$|In 1929, {{this version}} of M-64 was renumbered M-9. In 1934, M-9 {{traveled}} on Pioneer Road in Hillsdale County, from the Ohio border before turning west on Burt Road, north on Clark Road, west on Montgomery Road then north onto Hillsdale Road. During this time a loop was planned to continue north <b>from</b> <b>the</b> <b>corner</b> <b>of</b> Pioneer and Burt Roads to Montgomery Road where it turned west and met back up with M-9 at Clark Road. This short loop was designated M-158, however {{later in the year}} the routing of M-9 was shifted onto the M-158 alignment, eliminating that route. By the middle of 1936, the highway was extended northward to end in Lansing. The M-9 designation was replaced with M-99 in 1940.|$|E
5|$|The Battle of Alexander at Issus {{is painted}} on a limewood panel {{measuring}} , and portrays {{the moment of}} Alexander the Great's victory. The vertical format was dictated by the space available in the room for which the painting was commissioned – each in William's set of eight was made {{to be the same}} size. At an unknown date, the panel was cut down on all sides, particularly at the top, so the sky was originally larger and the moon further <b>from</b> <b>the</b> <b>corner</b> <b>of</b> the scene. The scene is approached from an impossible viewpoint – at first only feet from the fray, the perspective gradually ascends to encompass the seas and continents in the background and eventually the curvature of the Earth itself.|$|E

5|$|The head {{is small}} and streamlined, adding to the agility of the cheetah. Saharan cheetah have narrow canine faces. Small, short, and rounded, the ears are marked by black patches on the back; the edges and base of the ears are tawny. The high-set eyes have round pupils.

5|$|The {{fountain}} looks unfinished, like concrete {{that has}} not been completely mixed. Up close, it is very rough and textured. There are several square pillars or cubed tubes that form a semi circle inside a pentagon shaped pool. The natural colored pillars jut out and crisscross <b>from</b> <b>the</b> <b>corner</b> <b>of</b> the plaza “like the tentacles of some immense geometrical octopus….breaking open.” There are two bridges, or walk ways (with stairs), that allow the public to stand in-between the tubes and have a view overlooking the plaza and city. A series of platforms at pool level permit pedestrian entry into the fountain and behind the falling water. The fountain and plaza are easily accessible to the public at all times and in all conditions, rain or shine. The fountain's budget was US$310,000, and it was dedicated on April 22, 1971. The Los Angeles Times reported that its actual cost was US$607,800.|$|E

Sanders and the student turned and ran in the opposite direction. Harris and Klebold shot at them both, with Harris hitting Sanders twice in the chest but missing the student.

25|$|Portugal and the Netherlands {{faced each}} other in the first semi-final. Cristiano Ronaldo put the hosts in the lead from a corner kick midway through the first half, and just before the hour mark Maniche made it 2–0 for Portugal with a {{spectacular}} goal <b>from</b> <b>the</b> <b>corner</b> <b>of</b> the penalty area. An own goal from Jorge Andrade gave the Netherlands a glimmer of hope. Portugal came close to scoring a third goal that was only stopped by Wilfred Bouma's blocking attempt. The game ended 2–1 to Portugal and the hosts, after their opening day failure, were through to the final of their European Championship. The Czech Republic looked likely candidates to face the hosts in the final. They were favorites to take the trophy, having won all four games. However, they would have to see off the upstart Greeks to do so. The Czechs had several chances, including a shot from Tomáš Rosický that struck the bar. The game remained goalless, until the dying moments {{of the first half of}} extra-time, when Traianos Dellas headed home the winner, the first and only silver goal in a European Championship.|$|E
