5|$|Rommel {{believed}} that the Normandy coast could be a possible landing point for the invasion, so he ordered the construction of extensive defensive works along that shore. In addition to concrete gun emplacements at strategic points along the coast, he ordered wooden stakes, metal tripods, mines, and large anti-tank obstacles {{to be placed on}} the beaches to delay the approach of landing craft and impede the movement of tanks. Expecting the Allies to land at high tide so that the infantry would spend less time exposed on the beach, he ordered many of these obstacles to be placed at the <b>high</b> <b>water</b> <b>mark.</b> Tangles of barbed wire, booby traps, and the removal of ground cover made the approach hazardous for infantry. On Rommel's order, the number of mines along the coast was tripled. The Allied air offensive over Germany had crippled the Luftwaffe and established air supremacy over western Europe, so Rommel knew he could not expect effective air support. The Luftwaffe could muster only 815 aircraft over Normandy in comparison to the Allies' 9,543. Rommel arranged for booby-trapped stakes known as Rommelspargel (Rommel's asparagus) to be installed in meadows and fields to deter airborne landings.|$|E

25|$|In 1863, a great {{storm that}} {{occurred}} between May 4 and May 6 uncovered {{a great deal}} of the hull. It was discovered by Solomon Linnell and Alfred Rogers of Orleans. On May 9, Leander Crosby visited the Sparrow-Hawk and removed several artifacts. The rudder was few feet distant from the hull and it was removed, studied and re-assembled. By August 1863, Sparrow-Hawk was once again buried beneath the surface for a few months after which she was exposed once again, and then removed above the <b>high</b> <b>water</b> <b>mark.</b>|$|E
25|$|Over {{the next}} eight years, Paluma {{conducted}} survey work on the Great Barrier Reef for the Admiralty. The 1893 Brisbane flood ripped Paluma from her moorings and left her well above the <b>high</b> <b>water</b> <b>mark</b> in the nearby botanical gardens. As locals considered how to return her to the Brisbane River, another major flood two weeks later refloated the gunboat, and she was pulled clear without any significant damage. The depression of the 1890s saw Paluma and her sister placed in reserve, being reactivated for annual training at Easter. In 1895, she was returned to the Queensland Government.|$|E

25|$|By 1914 the DATI had 138 {{instructors}} travelling the country, informing farmers {{about new}} methods in agriculture, horticulture and poultry-keeping. The {{start of the}} 20th century saw the <b>high</b> <b>water</b> <b>mark</b> in Plunket's achievements. The IAOS was flourishing and vigorous. In 1903 there were 370 dairy societies, 201 cooperative banks and 146 agricultural societies {{under the auspices of}} thee IAOS, and by 1914 there were over 1,000 societies and nearly 90,000 members. However, most unionists considered Plunkett too conciliatory and their hostility cost him his seat at the general election in October 1900, when they put up a candidate to split the unionist vote.|$|E
25|$|The {{division}} {{itself was}} assigned to VIII Corps, and spread out along the southern coast of Cornwall and Devon. The Dorset County Division was based {{to the east of}} the division, and the 48th (South Midland) Infantry Division had been placed in reserve behind both formations. The 203rd Brigade was positioned on the western flank of the division's assigned area, and the 209th Brigade on the eastern. The battalions were spread out defending various potential landing areas and other important locations. The coastal defensive positions the division occupied included tubular scaffolding obstacles on the <b>high</b> <b>water</b> <b>mark,</b> barbed wire, minefields, beach front defensive fighting positions equipped with a range of modern and antiquated weaponry such as Maxim machine guns.|$|E

At {{the northern end of}} Cemetery Ridge is a copse of trees and a low stone wall that makes two 90-degree turns; the latter has been nicknamed The Angle and the <b>High</b> <b>Water</b> <b>Mark</b> of the Confederacy.

25|$|Milne {{took the}} {{leadership}} {{at a time}} when the Greens nationally had passed a peak. In the 18 months between the <b>high</b> <b>water</b> <b>mark</b> of the 2010 Federal Election and Brown's retirement, polls nationally were trending downwards. This was reflected in a number of setbacks for state and local Greens parties, which some commentators blamed on Brown's absence. The outcome of 20 October 2012 election in the ACT resulted in a reduction of Greens Legislative Assembly members, from four to one. The Western Australian state election was held in March 2013. For the Legislative Assembly, the total primary vote for the Greens fell by 3.52% to 8.40%. In the Legislative Council the Greens' representation was reduced from four to two members.|$|E
25|$|In the semifinals, UMass and Rhode Island {{played one}} of the most {{significant}} chapters of the many in their storied rivalry. Corell and URI's Kayla DiLorenzo, two of the ACHA's best goalies, traded big saves with 29 and 23 stops, respectively, but early goals from Labossiere and Raschelle Bräm were just enough for a 2–1 victory. The Minutemen fell one win short of their intended destination though, as Miami University formally launched a dynasty that would eventually grab three national titles in four years with a 3–1 championship game win. Siobhan Elvin scored a shorthanded goal for UMass to make the score 2–1 early in the second period, but Kaley Mooney answered quickly for the RedHawks and penalty trouble down the stretch doomed a comeback attempt. Nevertheless, the second-place finish remains the program's <b>high</b> <b>water</b> <b>mark.</b>|$|E
