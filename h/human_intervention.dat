40|$|Climate {{change is}} a major concern in the twenty-first century and its {{assessments}} are associated with multiple uncertainties, exacerbated and confounded in the regions where <b>human</b> <b>interventions</b> are prevalent. The present study explores the challenges for climate change impact assessment on the water resources of India, one of the world's largest human-modified systems. The extensive <b>human</b> <b>interventions</b> in the Energy-Land-Water-Climate (ELWC) nexus significantly impact the water resources of the country. The direct <b>human</b> <b>interventions</b> in the landscape may surpass/amplify/mask the impacts of climate change and in the process also affect climate change itself. Uncertainties in climate and resource assessments add to the challenge. Formulating coherent resource and climate change policies in India would therefore require an integrated approach that would assess the multiple interlinkages in the ELWC nexus and distinguish the impacts of global climate change from that of regional <b>human</b> <b>interventions.</b> Concerted research efforts are also needed to incorporate the prominent linkages in the ELWC nexus in climate/earth system modelling...|$|R

5|$|Despite their {{technical}} complexity, neither {{device was}} revolutionary {{by the standards}} of the time. However, the total vision of their design was. Evans was attempting a radical shift in thinking about the manufacturing process, treating it as a continuous integrated whole rather than a series of isolated processes. Thus, manufacturing could be a fully automated production line. The missing link was materials handling, and Evans's mill designs sought to feed materials continuously through a system without the need for any <b>human</b> <b>intervention.</b> This was the first fully automated industrial process, and the idea of continuous production was proved to be a critical ingredient of the industrial revolution, and would ultimately lay the foundation for modern mass production.|$|E
5|$|Early {{people began}} {{altering}} communities of {{flora and fauna}} for their own benefit through means such as fire-stick farming and forest gardening very early. Exact dates are hard to determine, as people collected and ate seeds before domesticating them, and plant characteristics may have changed during this period without human selection. An example is the semi-tough rachis and larger seeds of cereals from just after the Younger Dryas (about 9,500 BC) in the early Holocene in the Levant region of the Fertile Crescent. Monophyletic characteristics were attained without any <b>human</b> <b>intervention,</b> implying that apparent domestication of the cereal rachis could have occurred quite naturally.|$|E

40|$|Climate {{change and}} a river’s {{response}} to it {{are likely to be}} slow processes as compared to the responses to direct <b>human</b> <b>interventions</b> such as engineering works.

The termite assemblages were considerably different among sites, with a conspicuous reduction in both diversity and abundance with increased disturbance, related to the reduction of tree density and soil cover, and with the intensity of trampling by cattle and goats. The wood-feeders were the most severely affected feeding group.|$|E

Mérens foals are often born in the snow, without <b>human</b> <b>intervention,</b> but are usually handled and accustomed to humans from an early age.

5|$|The {{fact that}} Munro, an {{excellent}} observer who spent years on Lānai, only saw the bird three times implies {{that it was}} already very rare by the 1910s. From 1900 to 1940 nearly all of Lānai's forests were converted into pineapple fields. This conversion reduced {{the area of the}} hookbill's potential habitat, and {{is believed to be the}} biggest contributor to the species' extinction. It has also been suggested that avian malaria, which began affecting Lānai's birds in the 1920s, may have contributed to the species' decline. Likewise, the introduction of feral cats and rats to Lānai may have led to a decline in the hookbill's population. The extinction of local snails through <b>human</b> <b>intervention</b> could also have led to the Lānai hookbill's extinction.|$|E

40|$|Estuarine {{suspended}} {{sediment transport}} models are typically calibrated against suspended sediment concentration data. These data typically cover a {{limited range of}} the actual suspended sediment concentration dynamics, constrained in either time or space. As {{a result of these}} data limitations, the available data can be reproduced with complex 3 D transport models through multiple sets of model calibration parameters. These various model parameter sets influence the relative importance of transport processes such as settling, deposition, erosion, or mixing. As a result, multiple model parameter sets may reproduce sediment dynamics in tidal channels (where most data is typically collected) with the same degree of accuracy but simulate notably different sediment concentration patterns elsewhere (e. g. on the tidal flats). Different combinations of model input parameters leading to the same result are known as equifinality. The effect of equifinality on predictive model capabilities is investigated with a complex three-dimensional sediment transport model of a turbid estuary which is subject to several <b>human</b> <b>interventions.</b> The effect of two <b>human</b> <b>interventions</b> (offshore disposal of dredged sediment and restoration of the tidal channel profile) was numerically examined with several equifinal model settings.
