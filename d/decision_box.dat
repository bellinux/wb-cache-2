40|$|Abstract Background This project engages {{patients}} and physicians {{in the development}} of <b>Decision</b> <b>Boxes,</b> short clinical topic summaries covering medical questions that have no single best answer. <b>Decision</b> <b>Boxes</b> aim to prepare the clinician to communicate the risks and benefits of the available options to the patient so they can make an informed decision together. Methods Seven researchers (including four practicing family physicians) selected 10 clinical topics relevant to primary care practice through a Delphi survey. We then developed two one-page prototypes on two of these topics: prostate cancer screening with the prostate-specific antigen test, and prenatal screening for trisomy 21 with the serum integrated test. We presented the prototypes to purposeful samples of family physicians distributed in two focus groups, and patients distributed in four focus groups. We used the User Experience Honeycomb to explore barriers and facilitators to the communication design used in <b>Decision</b> <b>Boxes.</b> All discussions were transcribed, and three researchers proceeded to thematic content analysis of the transcriptions. The coding scheme was first developed from the Honeycomb’s seven themes (valuable, usable, credible, useful, desirable, accessible, and findable), and included new themes suggested by the data. Prototypes were modified in light of our findings. Results Three rounds were necessary for a majority of researchers to select 10 clinical topics. Fifteen physicians and 33 patients participated in the focus groups. Following analyses, three sections were added to the Decision Boxes: introduction, patient counseling, and references. The information was spread to two pages {{to try to make the}} <b>Decision</b> <b>Boxes</b> less busy and improve users’ first impression. To try to improve credibility, we gave more visibility to the research institutions involved in development. A statement on the boxes’ purpose and a flow chart representing the shared decision-making process were added with the intent of clarifying the tool’s purpose. Information about the risks and benefits according to risk levels was added to the <b>Decision</b> <b>Boxes,</b> to try to ease the adaptation of the information to individual patients. Conclusion Results will guide the development of the eight remaining <b>Decision</b> <b>Boxes.</b> A future study will evaluate the effect of <b>Decision</b> <b>Boxes</b> on the integration of evidence-based and shared decision making principles in clinical practice. </p...|$|R
40|$|Includes bibliographical {{references}} (pages -#) An {{experimental study}} was conducted to evaluate two factors in the graphic structure of flowcharts used for a problem solving task. The two factors were the directional orientation of the flowchart and the number of alternatives leading from <b>decision</b> <b>boxes.</b> A third factor evaluated was problem complexity. Sixty-four subjects were randomly assigned to eight experimental groups. Seven groups used variations of binary and multiple alternative flowcharts to solve problems. Binary flowcharts had two alternatives leading from <b>decision</b> <b>boxes</b> while multiple alternative flowcharts had three or four alternatives leading from <b>decision</b> <b>boxes.</b> The flowcharts also varied in directional orientation which was the direction in which the flowchart led the reader (left-to-right, top-to-bottom, right-to-left, and top-left-right-bottom). The eighth group used prose in paragraphs to solve problems. The subjects were required to solve 15 simple and 15 complex problems using the procedural instructions. The performance measures were the number of incorrect solutions to problems, the time used to view the formats, and the time used to solve problems. Two major conclusions were made: 1) Performance was best when the directional orientation of the flowchart was consistent with reading patterns. The best configurations for the graphic structure are either from left-to-right or from top-to-bottom. 2) The number of alternatives leading from <b>decision</b> <b>boxes</b> had no effect on performance...|$|R
40|$|Abstract Background Decision Boxes are {{summaries}} {{of the most}} important benefits and harms of health interventions provided to clinicians before they meet the patient, to prepare them to help patients make informed and value-based decisions. Our objective is to explore the barriers and facilitators to using Decision Boxes in clinical practice, more precisely factors stemming from (1) the Decision Boxes themselves, (2) the primary healthcare team (PHT), and (3) the primary care practice environment. Methods/design A two-phase mixed methods study will be conducted. Eight Decision Boxes relevant to primary care, and written in both English and in French, will be hosted on a website together with a tutorial to introduce the <b>Decision</b> <b>Box.</b> The Decision Boxes will be delivered as weekly emails over a span of eight weeks to clinicians of PHTs (family physicians, residents and nurses) in five primary care clinics located across two Canadian provinces. Using a web-questionnaire, clinicians will rate each <b>Decision</b> <b>Box</b> with the Information Assessment Method (cognitive impacts, relevance, usefulness, expected benefits) and with a questionnaire based on the Theory of Planned Behavior to study the determinants of clinicians’ intention to use what they learned from that <b>Decision</b> <b>Box</b> in their patient encounter (attitude, social norm, perceived behavioral control). Web-log data will be used to monitor clinicians’ access to the website. Following the 8 -week intervention, we will conduct semi-structured group interviews with clinicians and individual interviews with clinic administrators to explore contextual factors influencing the use of the Decision Boxes. Data collected from questionnaires, focus groups and individual interviews will be combined to identify factors potentially influencing implementation of Decision Boxes in clinical practice by clinicians of PHTs. Conclusions This project will allow tailoring of Decision Boxes and their delivery to overcome the specific barriers identified by clinicians of PHTs to improve the implementation of shared decision making in this setting. </p...|$|E

40|$|Visual cues are {{important}} navigational tools for many solitary foraging insects. In addition to {{information provided by}} path integration, desert ants learn and use visual cues for homing back to their nest. In this study, we compared the visually based learning of two desert ant species: the North African Cataglyphis fortis and the Australian Melophorus bagoti, each of which lives in ecologically similar but visually different environments. In our experiment, ants' choice performance was measured by training foragers in a channel system. We used a <b>decision</b> <b>box</b> with two visual stimuli during their homebound trips, {{with one of the}} stimuli always being the correct one that provided thoroughfare. To determine any habitat effects on learning, we examined intraspecific comparisons in C. fortis with different nest surroundings. The intraspecific comparison in C. fortis revealed no differences in learning the task. In general, C. fortis showed little learning in our task and the results were similar for ants from barren and cluttered environments. Overall, M. bagoti learned the task faster and had a higher level of accuracy than C. fortis. One explanation for this species-specific difference could be that the cluttered habitat of M. bagoti favours the evolution of visual associative learning more so than the plain habitat of C. fortis. 9 page(s...|$|E

40|$|Abstract Background Applying {{evidence}} {{is one of}} the most challenging steps of evidence-based clinical practice. Healthcare professionals have difficulty interpreting evidence and translating it to patients. Decision boxes are summaries of the most important benefits and harms of diagnostic, therapeutic, and preventive health interventions provided to healthcare professionals before they meet the patient. Our hypothesis is that Decision boxes will prepare clinicians to help patients make informed value-based decisions. By acting as primers, the boxes will enhance the application of evidence-based practices and increase shared decision making during the clinical encounter. The objectives of this study are to provide a framework for developing Decision boxes and testing their value to users. Methods/Design We will begin by developing <b>Decision</b> <b>box</b> prototypes for 10 clinical conditions or topics based on a review of the research on risk communication. We will present two prototypes to purposeful samples of 16 family physicians distributed in two focus groups, and 32 patients distributed in four focus groups. We will use the User Experience Model framework to explore users' perceptions of the content and format of each prototype. All discussions will be transcribed, and two researchers will independently perform a hybrid deductive/inductive thematic qualitative analysis of the data. The coding scheme will be developed a priori from the User Experience Model's seven themes (valuable, usable, credible, useful, desirable, accessible and findable), and will include new themes suggested by the data (inductive analysis). Key findings will be triangulated using additional publications on the design of tools to improve risk communication. All 10 Decision boxes will be modified in light of our findings. Discussion This study will produce a robust framework for developing and testing Decision boxes that will serve healthcare professionals and patients alike. It is the first step in the development and implementation of a new tool that should facilitate decision making in clinical practice. </p...|$|E
