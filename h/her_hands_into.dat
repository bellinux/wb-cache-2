5|$|The video starts {{showing a}} woman {{galloping}} through a snowy forest on horseback. She enters a warehouse where a cage surrounded by crows is suspended by chains. Nearby {{there is a}} trapped short-haired woman with a flayed face and crow-like eyes. The first woman stops under the cage {{and looks up at}} it. She casts a stone against a wall that reflects her like a mirror and the building collapses. In the snow, she finds a body—the second woman, inanimate and frozen—hidden under a blanket. She closes her eyes, plunges <b>her</b> <b>hands</b> <b>into</b> the body and pulls out a sword. Entering the forest, she sees numerous flying crows and ends up on a snowy plain on which there are erected many scarecrows. During the refrains, she uses her sword to destroy scarecrows, rip their sails and break the wooden crosses. Scarecrows' eyes weep black blood that turns to crows. Then, it is shown how the other woman was killed: the big peaks which covered the ceiling of her cage had gradually collapsed on her. Finally, the living woman plants her sword in the snow, then disappears into the air. Farmer plays the role of both women.|$|E
500|$|Bousman {{came up with}} an idea whereby a character's {{hands would}} get stuck in some sort of vessel and this {{resulted}} in the [...] "Hand Trap". It proved to be a challenge but after much discussion, Hackl, property master Jim Murray and art director Michele Brady came up with a suitable design. They arranged a glass box suspended by chains from the ceiling which contained a hypodermic needle with the antidote and which had two hand-holes on the underside. As soon as Vaugier's character Addison put <b>her</b> <b>hands</b> <b>into</b> the holes razor blades would close in on her hands and any attempt to withdraw from the trap would cause her to bleed to death. In order for the trap to be used safely, the prop builders made the handcuffs move inside the box and fake blades that would retract from the actress's hands, thus allowing her to slide her hands out. Hackl subsequently commented that the character did not have to put <b>her</b> <b>hands</b> <b>into</b> the trap as there was a lock with a key on the other side box that would have opened the contraption.|$|E
500|$|It is Day 15, October 6, 2004, and Claire {{wakes up}} from nightmares two {{nights in a}} row, screaming. In the first, Claire wakes to find herself no longer pregnant, as she walks into the forest and {{encounters}} John Locke (Terry O'Quinn) at a table, playing cards. She asks him why he is there, but Locke interrupts, telling her [...] "He was your responsibility, but you gave him away, Claire. Everyone pays the price now." [...] Locke looks up with one white and one black eye. She hears crying and finds a baby crib. After unfolding several layers of material she dips <b>her</b> <b>hands</b> <b>into</b> {{a pool of blood}} and then wakes screaming; she has injured her hands by digging her nails deeply into her palms. In the second dream, someone holds Claire down and injects something into her stomach, though she has no wound.|$|E
60|$|It gave Kate a great awe of him, {{partly because}} {{a little girl}} in a book would have gone up, slid <b>her</b> <b>hand</b> <b>into</b> his, and kissed him; but she could nearly as soon have slid <b>her</b> <b>hand</b> <b>into</b> a lion's; and she was right, {{it would have been very}} obtrusive.|$|R

60|$|Freda slipped <b>her</b> <b>hand</b> <b>into</b> Mrs. Halliday's {{and smiled}} up at her.|$|R
60|$|Rachel made <b>her</b> <b>hands</b> <b>into</b> a cup, {{for she had}} no other, {{and held}} water to Anna's lips, which she drank greedily, {{emptying}} them many times.|$|E
6000|$|Grisell {{sprang up}} eagerly to meet him, {{but as she}} put <b>her</b> <b>hands</b> <b>into</b> his he looked sorrowfully at her, and she asked under her breath, [...] "Ah! Sir Leonard--?" ...|$|E
60|$|Jeanne made no answer, but {{her eyes}} were full of tears as she put <b>her</b> <b>hands</b> <b>into</b> Harry's, and no sound came from her lips in answer to his good-night.|$|E
60|$|She slipped <b>her</b> <b>hand</b> <b>into</b> {{mine and}} I turned to lead her away.|$|R
60|$|Yes, please, said Sylvie, putting <b>her</b> <b>hand</b> <b>into</b> mine: and {{we walked}} off together.|$|R
60|$|Mrs. Constable thrust <b>her</b> <b>hand</b> <b>into</b> <b>her</b> lap {{and drew}} forth a thickly covered sheet.|$|R
6000|$|She {{looked at}} him a moment, hesitating, and then thrust <b>her</b> <b>hands</b> <b>into</b> her muff. [...] "That means nothing. Forgiveness is between equals, and you don't regard me as your equal." ...|$|E
60|$|He obeyed. There was {{something}} changed about her, something {{which he did}} not recognise. She thrust <b>her</b> <b>hands</b> <b>into</b> a box of cigarettes, took one out and lit it. She leaned against the table, facing him.|$|E
60|$|Molly plunged <b>her</b> <b>hands</b> <b>into</b> the muff, {{overturned}} {{a row of}} {{the family}} infants and flew to the mirror. Hint for the beauty column. To make bright eyes, rosy checks and a bewitching smile: Recipe--one set Russian sables. Apply.|$|E
60|$|Rilla {{dared not}} try to speak. She slipped <b>her</b> <b>hand</b> <b>into</b> Walter's and pressed it hard.|$|R
60|$|She put <b>her</b> <b>hand</b> <b>into</b> his offered palm, {{lowering}} her head, {{dark with}} bronze glints, upon which <b>her</b> father's <b>hand</b> rested for a moment.|$|R
6000|$|Here she {{hollowed}} <b>her</b> <b>hand</b> <b>into</b> a screen, and, leaning towards Katharine, inquired, {{in a very}} audible whisper, [...] "Does {{your friend}} WRITE?" ...|$|R
6000|$|Kate {{suddenly}} stopped, for Mr. Wardour sat down, {{drew her}} between his knees, took both <b>her</b> <b>hands</b> <b>into</b> one of his, and looked earnestly into her face, so gravely that she grew frightened, and looking appealingly up, cried out, [...] "O Mary, Mary! have I been naughty?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "It's useless, useless," [...] she replied, {{dropping}} <b>her</b> <b>hands</b> <b>into</b> {{her lap and}} gazing vacantly on the ground. [...] "I can't care; I can't even cry. And all you say is only pity. I don't want that. Would {{you still}} pity me, I wonder, if you knew that even though I had come to take this wretched money from you, I meant to taunt you, to accuse you of lying to me?" ...|$|E
60|$|Shirley {{advanced}} to meet Messrs. Hall and Sweeting, {{shaking hands with}} them cordially. They were come to tell her of certain successes they had achieved that morning in applications for subscriptions to the fund. Mr. Hall's eyes beamed benignantly through his spectacles, his plain face looked positively handsome with goodness; and when Caroline, seeing who was come, ran out to meet him, and put both <b>her</b> <b>hands</b> <b>into</b> his, he gazed down on her with a gentle, serene, affectionate expression that gave him the aspect of a smiling Melanchthon.|$|E
60|$|When {{she heard}} those last words, the Princess Alicia began to put <b>her</b> <b>hand</b> <b>into</b> the pocket where {{she kept the}} magic fish-bone.|$|R
60|$|At which words Miss Keeldar put <b>her</b> <b>hand</b> <b>into</b> Caroline's with an impulsively affectionate movement, {{which was}} well {{seconded}} by {{the expression of}} her face.|$|R
6000|$|... "It's dry water," [...] said Polychrome, dipping <b>her</b> <b>hand</b> <b>into</b> {{the stream}} and showing how the water fell from it and left it {{perfectly}} dry.|$|R
60|$|While Amy dressed, she issued her orders, and Jo obeyed them, {{not without}} {{entering}} her protest, however, for she sighed as she rustled into her new organdie, frowned darkly at {{herself as she}} tied her bonnet strings in an irreproachable bow, wrestled viciously with pins as {{she put on her}} collar, wrinkled up her features generally as she shook out the handkerchief, whose embroidery was as irritating to her nose as the present mission was to her feelings, and when she had squeezed <b>her</b> <b>hands</b> <b>into</b> tight gloves with three buttons and a tassel, as the last touch of elegance, she turned to Amy with an imbecile expression of countenance, saying meekly...|$|E
6000|$|I saw the indignation {{rising in}} the old woman's face. She was insulted. This boy was making fun of her. That was her thought. She thrust <b>her</b> <b>hands</b> <b>into</b> her pockets and {{straightened}} up {{to give him a}} piece of her mind. Her temper was all up, and hot. Her mouth came open and let out three words of a bitter sentence,... then it fell silent, and the anger in her face turned to surprise or wonder or fear, or something, and she slowly brought out her hands from her pockets and opened them and held them so. In one was my piece of money, in the other lay four silver groschen. She gazed a little while, perhaps to see if the groschen would vanish away; then she said, fervently: ...|$|E
6000|$|... "It's heartless in me, Fanny; and you needn't {{say such}} a thing. I'm sure I didn't utter a {{syllable}} to wound him, and just before that he'd been very disagreeable, and I forgave him because I thought he was mortified. And you needn't say that I've no feeling"; and thereupon she rose, and, putting <b>her</b> <b>hands</b> <b>into</b> her cousin's, [...] "Fanny," [...] she cried, vehemently, [...] "I have been heartless. I'm afraid I haven't shown any sympathy or consideration. I'm afraid I must have seemed dreadfully callous and hard. I oughtn't to have thought of anything but the danger to him; {{and it seems to}} me now I scarcely thought of that at all. O, how rude it was of me to see anything funny in it! What can I do?" ...|$|E
60|$|Statira {{had slipped}} <b>her</b> <b>hand</b> <b>into</b> Lemuel's, {{and she held}} it fast, as if in that clasp she were holding on to her chance of life.|$|R
6000|$|... "I {{will make}} them understand!" [...] said Felix. He drew <b>her</b> <b>hand</b> <b>into</b> his arm, and they wandered about in the garden, talking, for an hour.|$|R
6000|$|... 'I {{will have}} one, you cruel wretch!' she screamed, darting <b>her</b> <b>hand</b> <b>into</b> the fire, and drawing forth some half-consumed fragments, {{at the expense}} of her fingers.|$|R
60|$|Every {{face in the}} {{gathering}} was turned upon me, and I heard the rustle of the innumerable necks and saw countless eyes without meeting one friendly one amongst them. The woman had swept past me, and was whispering, with many shakes {{of her head and}} dartings of <b>her</b> <b>hands,</b> <b>into</b> the Prince's ear. For my own part I threw out my chest and curled my moustache, glancing round in my own debonair fashion at the assembly. They were men, all of them, professors from the college, a sprinkling of their students, soldiers, gentlemen, artisans, all very silent and serious. In one corner there sat a group of men in black, with riding-coats drawn over their shoulders. They leaned their heads to each other, whispering under their breath, and with every movement I caught the clank of their sabres or the clink of their spurs.|$|E
60|$|One point {{upon which}} I {{was anxious to}} gain {{information}} was as to how long these proceedings had been going on. When did St. James assert his hold over Dr. McCarthy? From neither of them could I learn how long my colleague {{had been in his}} present situation. One or two leading questions upon my part were eluded or ignored in a manner so marked that {{it was easy to see}} that they were both of them as eager to conceal the point as I was to know it. But at last one evening I had the chance of a chat with Mrs. Carter, the matron--for the Doctor was a widower--and from her I got the information which I wanted. It needed no questioning to get at her knowledge, for she was so full of indignation that she shook with passion as she spoke of it, and raised <b>her</b> <b>hands</b> <b>into</b> the air in the earnestness of her denunciation, as she described the grievances which she had against my colleague.|$|E
60|$|Fiorsen spun round, {{shook his}} fist, {{and went out}} muttering. They heard the front door slam. Gyp turned {{abruptly}} to the window, and there, in her agitation, she noticed little outside things as one does in moments of bewildered anger. Even into that back yard, summer had crept. The leaves of the sumach-tree were glistening; in a three-cornered little patch of sunlight, a black cat with a blue ribbon round its neck was basking. The voice of one hawking strawberries drifted melancholy from a side street. She was conscious that Monsieur Harmost was standing very still, with a hand pressed to his mouth, and she felt a perfect passion of compunction and anger. That kind and harmless old man--to be so insulted! This was indeed the culmination of all Gustav's outrages! She would never forgive him this! For he had insulted her as well, beyond what pride or meekness could put up with. She turned, and, running up to the old man, put both <b>her</b> <b>hands</b> <b>into</b> his.|$|E
6000|$|... "You think so," [...] said she, unconsciously sliding <b>her</b> <b>hand</b> <b>into</b> his, {{as though}} to thank him by its {{pressure}} for the comfort he was giving her.|$|R
6000|$|... "Oh, yes," [...] cried Cynthia; [...] "I'll show you." [...] She {{hesitated a}} moment, and then thrust <b>her</b> <b>hand</b> <b>into</b> his. [...] "Do {{you want to}} see?" ...|$|R
6000|$|... 'No--no--' faltered the victim; but, alas! Mrs. Gooch {{had only}} to thrust <b>her</b> <b>hand</b> <b>into</b> the little pocket of his monkey suit to convict him on the spot.|$|R
