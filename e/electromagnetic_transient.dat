Constant exciting current produces good linearity’s between torque and slip frequency. In current control, the primary current is the control input to the induction motor whereas the primary terminal voltage is the control input in voltage control. Two transient phenomena are associated with induction motor operation. One is the mechanical transient of the dynamic system driven by induction motor {{and the other is}} the <b>electromagnetic</b> <b>transient</b> within the induction motor. In the first, speed and position of the motor shaft are state variables whereas in latter voltage, current, magnetic field are the state variables.

An overview of existing transient simulation methods for power systems, with {{special emphasis on}} HVdc converter plant, is made, and their main features outlined.
