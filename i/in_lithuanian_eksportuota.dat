40|$|Master's thesis {{analyzes}} {{manifestation of}} public governance characteristics <b>in</b> <b>Lithuanian</b> public administration system. In Lithuania {{the manifestation of}} public governance is not widely examined, therefore {{there is a need}} not only to analyze the public governance but also to evaluate its manifestation <b>in</b> <b>Lithuanian</b> public administration system. This master's thesis raises a following problem – do the public governance characteristics occur <b>in</b> <b>Lithuanian</b> public administration system? The research subject of study – public governance doctrine. The aim of this study – identify the main characteristics of public governance and evaluate their manifestation <b>in</b> <b>Lithuanian</b> public administration system. The following objectives of research help to achieve the aim: 1. describe the concept of public governance and development context; 2. analyse public governance characteristics and elements and their importance to public administration improvement; 3. present and analyse the characteristics of Lithuanian public administration system; 4. assess the manifestation of key elements for public governance criteria and preconditions for application <b>in</b> <b>Lithuanian</b> public administration system. For implementation of the objectives there were used theoretical and empirical research methods. It can be concluded that the public governance is a set of control, coordination, management tools and methods, which emphasizes the importance of cooperation with the public, self-regulatory networks, empowerment of citizens, interaction and values in the public administration application. Its key elements are trust-based cooperation, citizen empowerment and evidence-based management. The investigation showed that <b>in</b> <b>Lithuanian</b> public administration system {{one of the most common}} elements is trust-based cooperation, the least common element is citizen empowerment, and the manifestation of evidence-based management <b>in</b> <b>Lithuanian</b> public administration system can be considered average...|$|R
40|$|The aim of {{the present}} study was to {{describe}} the genetic polymorphism of the -LG milk protein locus <b>in</b> the <b>Lithuanian</b> Blackface sheep breed obtained using isoelectric focusing (IEF) method and <b>in</b> the <b>Lithuanian</b> Native Coarse wool sheep – using PCR-RFLP method. The results of study as follows: <b>in</b> <b>Lithuanian</b> Blackface sheep two genetic variants A and B with allele frequency of A= 0. 52 and B= 0. 48 were identified. The most frequent genotype <b>in</b> <b>Lithuanian</b> Blackface breed, detected in 66. 7 % of studied individuals, was heterozygous genotype AB. Homozygous genotypes AA and BB were observed at frequencies of 19. 0 % and 14. 3 %, respectively. <b>In</b> <b>Lithuanian</b> Native Coarse wool sheep two genetic variants A and B with allele frequency of A= 0. 69 and B= 0. 31 were identified. The BB genotype was not frequent (7. 8 %) <b>in</b> <b>Lithuanian</b> Native Coarse wool breed. The genotypes AA and AB were observed at frequency of 46. 1 %. Mean observed heterozygosity value (Hobs= 0. 511) <b>in</b> <b>Lithuanian</b> Blackface sheep was slightly lower than mean expected heterozygosity (Hexp= 0. 667). <b>In</b> <b>Lithuanian</b> Native Coarse wool sheep mean expected heterozygosity value (Hobs= 0. 461) was similar to the mean observed heterozygosity (Hexp= 0. 434). The deviation from Hardy-Weinberg equilibrium was not detected in any of those breeds. Conclusions: the detected high frequency of genotype AB <b>in</b> meat-wool type <b>Lithuanian</b> Blackface and Lithuanian Native Coarse wool sheep might be in agreement with the observations made by Bocharev. Since the priority in the development of this breed is given to the improvement of the meat traits, the associations between β-LG variant AB and higher body weight are possible. However, in order to prove this observation, further analyses are needed...|$|R
