5|$|Altrincham now has {{eighteen}} primary schools, {{one special}} school and eight secondary schools, including five <b>grammar</b> schools; the Trafford district maintains a selective education system {{assessed by the}} 11-plus exam. Several of Altrincham's secondary schools have specialist status: Altrincham College of Arts (arts); Altrincham <b>Grammar</b> School for Boys (language); Altrincham <b>Grammar</b> School for Girls (language); Blessed Thomas Holford Catholic College (maths and computing); Loreto <b>Grammar</b> School (science and maths); and St. Ambrose College (maths and computing). Altrincham College of Arts, Altrincham <b>Grammar</b> School for Boys, Altrincham <b>Grammar</b> School for Girls, Blessed Thomas Holford Catholic College, Loreto <b>Grammar</b> School, and St. Ambrose College were all rated as outstanding in their most recent Ofsted reports. Brentwood Special School is a mixed school for 11- to 19-year-olds who have special needs or learning difficulties.|$|E

50|$|<b>Grammars</b> with {{prescribed}} sequences are <b>grammars</b> {{in which}} the sequence of rule application is constrained in some way. There are four different versions of prescribed sequence grammars: language controlled <b>grammars</b> (often called just controlled <b>grammars),</b> matrix <b>grammars,</b> vector <b>grammars,</b> and programmed <b>grammars.</b>|$|R
50|$|Controlled <b>grammars</b> are a {{class of}} <b>grammars</b> that extend, usually, the {{context-free}} <b>grammars</b> with additional controls on the derivations of a sentence in the language. A number {{of different kinds of}} controlled <b>grammars</b> exist, the four main divisions being Indexed <b>grammars,</b> <b>grammars</b> with prescribed derivation sequences, <b>grammars</b> with contextual conditions on rule application, and <b>grammars</b> with parallelism in rule application. Because indexed <b>grammars</b> are so well established in the field, this article will address only the latter three kinds of controlled <b>grammars.</b>|$|R
50|$|In {{computer}} science, SLR <b>grammars</b> are {{the class}} of formal <b>grammars</b> accepted by a Simple LR parser. SLR <b>grammars</b> are a superset of all LR(0) <b>grammars</b> and a subset of all LALR(1) and LR(1) <b>grammars.</b>|$|R
5|$|Although no {{attendance}} {{records for}} the period survive, most biographers agree that Shakespeare was probably educated at the King's New School in Stratford, a free school chartered in 1553, about a quarter-mile (400m) from his home. <b>Grammar</b> schools varied in quality during the Elizabethan era, but <b>grammar</b> school curricula were largely similar: the basic Latin text was standardised by royal decree, and the school would have provided an intensive education in <b>grammar</b> based upon Latin classical authors.|$|E
5|$|As of 2010, further {{education}} in Greater Manchester is co-ordinated by the Greater Manchester Colleges Group, {{a joint venture}} composed of an association of 24 colleges in the region. Primary and secondary education within Greater Manchester are {{the responsibility of the}} constituent boroughs which form local education authorities and administer schools. The county has several independent schools such as Bolton School, Bury <b>Grammar</b> School, Manchester <b>Grammar</b> School, Oldham Hulme <b>Grammar</b> School, St Bede's College and Stockport <b>Grammar</b> School.|$|E
5|$|Ashford has twelve {{primary schools}} two <b>grammar</b> schools, two further {{secondary}} schools and a college. The Norton Knatchbull School {{was founded in}} Ashford around 1630 as a free <b>grammar</b> school by its namesake, Sir Norton Knatchbull. The school continued to be led and funded by Knatchbull's family due to a stipulation in his will in 1636. It was known simply as Ashford <b>Grammar</b> School until 1980. The original school was based next to {{the church in the}} town centre, but has moved several times. By the 20th century it had moved to its present location on Hythe Road. The current school premises were built in the late 1990s. The corresponding <b>grammar</b> school for girls is Highworth <b>Grammar</b> School for Girls to the west of town. It opened as the County School for Girls in 1908, before moving to its current premises on Maidstone Road in 1928. There is also a private independent school, Ashford School on East Hill, which was founded in 1898. For much of its history, it has only allowed girls, though boys started to be admitted in 2006.|$|E
50|$|Vijay-Shanker and Weir (1994) {{demonstrates}} that Linear Indexed <b>Grammars,</b> Combinatory Categorial <b>Grammars,</b> Tree-adjoining <b>Grammars,</b> and Head <b>Grammars</b> all define {{the same class}} of string languages.Their formal definition of linear indexed <b>grammars</b> differs from the above.|$|R
40|$|In {{this paper}} we {{introduce}} {{the class of}} so called Ch(k) <b>grammars</b> [pronounced "chain k grammars"]. This class of <b>grammars</b> is properly contained {{in the class of}} LR(k) <b>grammars</b> and it properly contains the LL(k) <b>grammars.</b> However, the family of Ch[k) languages coincides with the family of LL(k) languages.

50|$|Unlike <b>grammars</b> {{controlled}} by prescribed sequences of production rules, which constrain {{the space of}} valid derivations but do not constrain the sorts of sentences that a production rule can apply to, <b>grammars</b> {{controlled by}} context conditions have no sequence constraints, but permit constraints of varying complexity on the sentences to which a production rule applies. Similar to <b>grammars</b> controlled by prescribed sequences, there are multiple different kinds of <b>grammars</b> controlled by context conditions: conditional <b>grammars,</b> semi-conditional <b>grammars,</b> random context <b>grammars,</b> and ordered <b>grammars.</b>|$|R

5|$|In 1912, a Cecil Priestley was {{temporarily}} employed by Henn {{as a member}} of the Guildford <b>Grammar</b> School staff. It seems today that he conceived the idea of a Guildford Preparatory School.

40|$|This thesis studies {{regulated}} <b>grammars,</b> their fundamentals {{and expressing}} power regarding Chomsky hierarchy of languages. Programmed <b>grammars</b> are investigated {{in more depth}} considering a few types of leftmost derivations. A variant of deterministic syntax analysis of programmed <b>grammars</b> is introduced. This analysis works similarly as LL(k) parsing. Transformations of matrix <b>grammars</b> into programmed <b>grammars</b> without changing their expressing power are introduced. The syntax analysis by regularly controlled <b>grammars</b> partly using programmed <b>grammars</b> are presented. In the end, cooperating distributed <b>grammars</b> with left permitting <b>grammars</b> as components are mentioned.

5|$|One of Manchester's {{most notable}} {{secondary}} schools is the Manchester <b>Grammar</b> School. Established in 1515,• {{as a free}} <b>grammar</b> school next {{to what is now}} the Cathedral, it moved in 1931 to Old Hall Lane in Fallowfield, south Manchester, to accommodate the growing student body. In the post-war period, it was a direct grant <b>grammar</b> school (i.e. partially state funded), but it reverted to independent status in 1976 after abolition of the direct-grant system. Its previous premises are now used by Chetham's School of Music. There are three schools nearby: William Hulme's <b>Grammar</b> School, Withington Girls' School and Manchester High School for Girls.|$|E

Besides these explicit operations, Boolean <b>grammars</b> allow implicit disjunction represented by multiple rules for a single nonterminal symbol, {{which is the only}} logical connective expressible in context-free <b>grammars.</b> Conjunction and negation can be used, in particular, to specify intersection and complement of languages. An intermediate class of <b>grammars</b> known as conjunctive <b>grammars</b> allows conjunction and disjunction, but not negation.|$|R
5|$|Responsibility {{for local}} {{education}} fell to Cheshire County Council in 1903.

40|$|A {{practical}} {{tool for}} natural language modeling {{and development of}} human-machine interaction is developed {{in the context of}} formal <b>grammars</b> and languages. A new type of formal <b>grammars,</b> called <b>grammars</b> with prohibition, is introduced. <b>Grammars</b> with prohibition provide more powerful tools for natural language generation and better describe processes of language learning than the conventional formal <b>grammars.</b> Here we study relations between languages generated by different <b>grammars</b> with prohibition based on conventional types of formal <b>grammars</b> such as context-free or context sensitive <b>grammars.</b> Besides, we compare languages generated by different <b>grammars</b> with prohibition and languages generated by conventional formal <b>grammars.</b> In particular, it is demonstrated that they have essentially higher computational power and expressive possibilities in comparison with the conventional formal <b>grammars.</b> Thus, while conventional formal <b>grammars</b> are recursive and subrecursive algorithms, many classes of <b>grammars</b> with prohibition are superrecursive algorithms. Results presented in this work are aimed at the development of human-machine interaction, modeling natural languages, empowerment of programming languages, computer simulation, better software systems, and theory of recursion.
