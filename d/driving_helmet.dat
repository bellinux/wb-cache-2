40|$|The first- and second-impact {{absorption}} {{properties of}} different commercial polymeric foams were analysed {{in order to}} identify possible alternatives to currently used polystyrene foams (EPS) for protective helmets. An appropriate “falling dart” apparatus was built complying with standard regulations to study and compare an expanded polystyrene (EPS) actually used in motorcycle helmets productions, with commercial polypropylene (EPP), polyvinyl-chloride (EPVC) and polyethylene (EPE) foams. Both dynamic cushioning tests in a “free sample” configuration and impact tests using guided hemispherical indenters were performed for each class of material at three different temperatures (- 20 °C, ambient, 50 °C) and at two different bulk densities. Also the residual deformation was measured for each sample. In order to characterise dynamic absorption properties of materials, deceleration peak values obtained from the tests with hemispherical impactors have been plotted versus different static loads in a cushion curve fashion. Expanded polypropylene showed better second-impact absorption properties and lower residual deformation than EPS, suggesting it as a possible alternative material for inner polymeric foam protective shells, particularly in view of matching the two-shock criteria required for official approval of car <b>driving</b> <b>helmets...</b>|$|R
40|$|In {{order to}} ensure the safety measures, the {{detection}} of traffic rule violators is a highly desirable but challenging task due to various difficulties such as occlusion, illumination, poor quality of surveillance video, varying whether conditions, etc. In this paper, we present a framework for automatic detection of motorcyclists <b>driving</b> without <b>helmets</b> in surveillance videos. In the proposed approach, first we use adaptive background subtraction on video frames to get moving objects. Later convolutional neural network (CNN) is used to select motorcyclists among the moving objects. Again, we apply CNN on upper one fourth part for further recognition of motorcyclists <b>driving</b> without a <b>helmet.</b> The performance of the proposed approach is evaluated on two datasets, IITH_Helmet_ 1 contains sparse traffic and IITH_Helmet_ 2 contains dense traffic, respectively. The experiments on real videos successfully detect 92. 87 % violators with a low false alarm rate of 0. 5 % on an average and thus shows the efficacy of the proposed approach...|$|R

40|$|As part of {{the effort}} to {{stabilise}} worldwide road fatality rates the World Health Organization has highlighted the need for comprehensive in-country laws addressing five key risk factors: speed, drink <b>driving,</b> motorcycle <b>helmets,</b> seatbelts and child restraints. However, the effectiveness of laws covering these five key factors may be dependent on the governance of the country implementing these laws. This study sought to determine if there is a correlation between governance and road fatality rates. To do this, data on six governance indices from the World Bank and road fatality rates from the World Health Organization covering over 176 countries was obtained. A Pearson’s correlation analysis was performed on this data. The findings indicate that there is a negative correlation between key governance indices and road fatality rates. The finding from this study highlights the importance of good governance as {{part of the}} effort to reduce worldwide fatality rates...|$|R

ESPN ran a comedic segment on [...] "How to Steal a Championship" [...] where two crew members from Davey Allison and Ricky Rudd's teams which were second and third and points respectively, attempted to steal Earnhardt's <b>driving</b> uniform and <b>helmet,</b> in an effort so Earnhardt could not start the race. Those efforts were thwarted by longtime Earnhardt crewman Chocolate Myers and Earnhardt won by merely starting the race, and completing the first lap.|$|R
50|$|Protection {{motivation}} theory conventionally {{has been}} applied in the personal health contexts. A meta-analysis study on protection motivation theory categorized major six topics: cancer prevention (17%), exercise/diet/healthy lifestyle (17%), smoking (9%), AIDS prevention (9%), alcohol consumption (8%), and adherence to medical-treatment regimens (6%). As the minority topics, the study presented prevention of nuclear war, wearing bicycle <b>helmets,</b> <b>driving</b> safety, child-abuse prevention, reducing caffeine consumption, seeking treatment for sexually transmitted diseases, inoculation against influenza, saving endangered species, improving dental hygiene, home radon testing, osteoporosis prevention, marijuana use, seeking emergency help via 911, pain management during and recovery after dental surgery, and safe use of pesticides. All these topics were directly or indirectly related to personal physical health.|$|R
40|$|Objectives The aim of {{this study}} was to model the avoidable burden of the risk factors of road traffic crashes in Iran and to {{prioritize}} interventions to reduce that burden. Methods The prevalence and the effect size of the risk factors were obtained from data documented by the traffic police of Iran in 2013. The effect size was estimated using an ordinal regression model. The potential impact fraction index was applied to calculate the avoidable burden in order to prioritize interventions. This index was calculated for theoretical, plausible, and feasible minimum risk level scenarios. The joint effects of the risk factors were then estimated for all the scenarios. Results The highest avoidable burdens in the theoretical, plausible, and feasible minimum risk level scenarios for the non-use of child restraints on urban roads were 52. 25, 28. 63, and 46. 67, respectively. In contrast, the value of this index for speeding was 76. 24, 37. 00, and 62. 23, respectively, for rural roads. Conclusions On the basis of the different scenarios considered in this research, we suggest focusing on future interventions to decrease the prevalence of speeding, the non-use of child restraints, the use of cell phones while <b>driving,</b> and <b>helmet</b> disuse, and the laws related to these items should be considered seriously...|$|R
40|$|Legislating five of {{the main}} risk factors for road traffic {{injuries}} (RTIs), as much as enforcing the law, is essential in forging an integral culture of road safety. Analysis {{of the level of}} progression in law enforcement allows for an evaluation of the state of world regions. A secondary analysis of the 2009 Global status report on road safety: time for action survey was undertaken to evaluate legislation on five risk factors (speed management, drinking and <b>driving,</b> motorcycle <b>helmet</b> use, seatbelt use, and use of child restraints) in the Americas. Laws were classified depending on their level of progression: the existence of legislation, whether the legislation is adequate, a level of law enforcement ≥ 6 (on a scale of 0 – 10), and whether the law is considered comprehensive. A descriptive analysis was performed. The totality of the countries has national or subnational legislation for {{at least one of the}} five risk factors. However, 63 % have laws on the five risk factors studied, and none of them has comprehensive laws for all five. Seatbelt use appears to be the most extended enforced legislation, while speeding laws appear to be the least enforced. There are positive efforts that should be recognized in the region. However, the region stands in different stages of progression. Law enforcement remains the main issue to be tackled. Laws should be based on evidence abou...|$|R
40|$|Background: Cranium-cerebral traumas in today’s era are {{a serious}} {{public health problem}} with bothsocial and {{economic}} dimensions. They are characterized as an ‘epidemic’, due {{to the increase in}} car accidents and they particularly affect the productive population. The objective {{of this study was to}} investigate the occurrence and allocation of Cranium-cerebral traumas among the population in the Prefecture of Laconia, in order to determine the explanatory factors or risk factors, the record of how they are managed (diagnosis, therapy, and outcome) and their correlation with demographics and other factors. Methodology: This study was conducted with the collection of data from hospital archives and Emergency Department logbooks from the General Hospital of Sparta. Specifically designed record forms were used which included patient demographics, means of arrival to the hospital, the clinical pictures, the gravity of the injury, possible accompanying injuries, diagnostic tests, treatment and outcome, as well as evidence related to the causes of the injury. Results: 2352 cases of children and adults with Cranium-cerebral traumas were included in this study who came to the Emergency Department from 1 st of January 2005 to 31 st of December 2010. The cause of Cranium-cerebral traumas in adults is affected by gender, nationality and place of residence, while in children it is affected by place of residence and the means of arrival to the Emergency Department. Respectively, the outcome of Cranium–cerebral traumas in adults is affected by place of residence and their means of arrival to the hospital while in children it is affected by nationality and place of residence. Conclusions: This study has revealed the magnitude of the problem and the epidemiological characteristics of Cranium-cerebral traumas in the Prefecture of Laconia, with the ultimate need for intervention at a level of prevention. Proposals regard the improvement in road networks, informative campaigns to the public regarding enforced road safety <b>driving</b> measures (<b>helmet,</b> seatbelts, baby car seats, etc.), in applied educational programmes for the promotion of road safety conduct, in parental education on the basic safety regulations and prevention of accidents concerning children...|$|R
50|$|Morris made a {{comeback}} to motor racing at the 1983 James Hardie 1000. Originally {{he had planned}} to enter a Holden VH Commodore SS, but negotiations to buy the spare Holden Dealer Team car fell through only weeks before the race. He went to Bathurst anyway, only as a spectator (though with his <b>driving</b> suit and <b>helmet,</b> just in case), but was offered the drive in the Commodore to be driven by its owner Rusty French, and former Re-Car team owner Allan Browne. Never a serious racer and admittedly uncomfortable in the car, Browne spotted Morris in the pits and after talking to him offered to step aside to allow the 1976 winner to race. Despite not having previously driven the car, Morris was immediately 6.3 seconds faster than French and managed to move the car from 31st to 10th in qualifying, enough to qualify for Hardies Heroes. He would eventually start 9th following the Hardies Heroes crash of Dick Johnson who destroyed his Greens-Tuf XE Falcon at Forrest's Elbow. Incredibly, thanks to some car swapping, Johnson started the race from 10th position in a replacement Falcon which was re-built overnight. Ironically this Falcon was the same car that John Fitzpatrick had crashed in practice which saw it a non-starter in 1982. In the race, Morris diced early with the RX-7 of Allan Moffat, but brake problems due to the brake fluid boiling saw Morris and French finish in 8th place, nine laps down on the winning HDT Commodore of John Harvey, Peter Brock and Larry Perkins.|$|R
50|$|The Nissan {{team also}} raced a Nissan Gazelle in the 1987 Australian 2.0 Litre Touring Car Championship for 20-year-old Mark Skaife, who had {{previously}} shown good form finishing second in the 1985 and 1986 Ford Laser series held at Amaroo Park. Skaife, who had joined the Nissan team as a mechanic in 1987, {{went on to win}} the 2.0 Litre championship, winning three of the four rounds of the series to break the stranglehold that Toyota had on the baby car class. He was joined at Bathurst in the Gazelle by Adelaide Hills Nissan dealer Grant Jarrett. During qualifying, Jarrett was having trouble making the class cut off time and it looked as if the Gazelle, which due to the race being an FIA WTCC race was forced to run in a higher engine class than it did in Australia (putting it in the same class as the BMW M3), would be a non-qualifier. However, late in Friday qualifying Jarrett managed to make the cut. During the time Jarrett was on his qualifying run, Skaife was reportedly nowhere to be seen in the Nissan pits. When the car returned to the pits it was driven straight into the garage and the doors closed. Both drivers emerged a short time later, with Skaife having damp hair and a flushed face while Jarret looked more like he had just got out of a shower than a touring car. This led to speculation it was Skaife and not Jarrett who had just been in the car for its final qualifying run. The pair finished the race in 19th place after numerous mechanical problems which had started within the first 10 laps. Despite the speculation that he had not driven his fastest qualifying laps, in the race Jarrett proved his critics wrong and would be credited with a faster race lap than he recorded in qualifying. However, in a magazine interview almost 20 years later, Fred Gibson admitted that it was indeed Skaife who qualified the car using Jarrett's <b>driving</b> suit and <b>helmet.</b>|$|R
