5|$|Obama's {{inaugural address}} {{received}} mixed reviews, with some describing {{the tone of}} the speech a praiseworthy one of restraint and plain speaking, while others described the speech as low-brow and cliched. Despite his optimism, Obama was critical of former Presidents GeorgeW. Bush and BillClinton. David E. Sanger, chief Washington correspondent for The New York Times, described the speech as the harshest rebuke of an outgoing President during an inaugural address since Franklin Roosevelt's call for restoration of American values. The Bush administration was upset about {{the tone of the}} speech, saying that the speech veered from that of a ritualistic but respectful thanks to that of a public diatribe. Members of the Republican party viewed the speech as a missed chance to seek unity, while Rahm Emanuel, Obama's White House Chief of Staff, described the speech as a reflection of the mandate of the people. In an analysis of the inaugural address, one reporter described the speech as one that emphasized the burdens of the moment and the cloudy future whose challenges may be met with the resolve that <b>is</b> <b>part</b> <b>of</b> <b>our</b> American heritage.|$|E
500|$|In {{an effort}} to improve this situation, Trans Media Watch drafted and {{published}} a memorandum of understanding for media companies: signatories of the memorandum agree to [...] "work toward… increasing positive, well-informed representations of transgender people in the media." [...] In March 2011, Channel 4 became the first company to sign the memorandum. [...] "Our editorial independence always come first; but it <b>is</b> <b>part</b> <b>of</b> <b>our</b> remit to reflect {{the diversity of the}} UK", said Cosgrove.|$|E
500|$|The surname [...] "Affleck" [...] is of Scottish origin. Affleck {{appeared}} on the PBS genealogy series Finding Your Roots in 2014. When told during filming that an ancestor had been a slave owner in Georgia, Affleck responded: [...] "God. It gives me kind of a sagging feeling to see a biological relationship to that. But, you know, there it <b>is,</b> <b>part</b> <b>of</b> <b>our</b> history ... We tend to separate ourselves from these things by going like, 'It's just dry history, and it's all over now'." [...] Later, a representative for Affleck told host Henry Louis Gates Jr. via email that Affleck [...] "was uneasy about the slave owner" [...] and the information {{was not included in}} the show's final cut. When this became public knowledge during the 2015 Sony email hacking scandal, Affleck said he had been [...] "embarrassed" [...] by the information.|$|E

500|$|One of Tarn and Zach Adams' {{early works}} was a text based {{adventure}} game called dragslay, {{written in the}} BASIC language and influenced by Dungeons and Dragons. This was the brothers' first fantasy project. In high school, Tarn Adams taught himself the C programming language and developed it further. dragslay would later have an important influence on Dwarf Fortress. Adams explained his interest in fantasy games, that {{he had grown up}} [...] "surrounded by that sort of thing...along with generic sci-fi, generic fantasy <b>is</b> <b>part</b> <b>of</b> <b>our</b> heritage." [...] Years later, before entering graduate school in mathematics, Adams began working on a project he called Slaves to Armok: God of Blood. It was named after a deity in dragslay, originally named for a variable [...] "arm_ok"—which counted the limbs the player still had attached. This new project was a two-dimensional (would later have 3D graphics) isometric fantasy role-playing game in which the player encountered and fought goblins.|$|E

It inspires pride, <b>is</b> <b>part</b> <b>of</b> <b>our</b> Kiwi identity and a symbol of Kiwi success on the world stage." [...] The airline began using black as its corporate colour ahead of a sponsorship campaign with NZ's rugby union team, the All Blacks, in 2011.|$|E

2500|$|Nkrumah {{consolidated}} {{state control}} over newspapers, establishing the Ghanaian Times in 1958 {{and then in}} 1962 obtaining its competitor, the Daily Graphic, from the Mirror Group of London. As he wrote in Africa Must Unite: [...] "It <b>is</b> <b>part</b> <b>of</b> <b>our</b> revolutionary credo that within the competitive system of capitalism, the press cannot function in accordance with a strict regard for the sacredness of facts, and that the press, therefore, should not remain in private hands." [...] Starting in 1960, he invoked the right of pre-publication censorship of all news.|$|E

2500|$|According to some viewpoints, Resolution 2758 {{solved the}} issue of [...] "China's {{representation}}" [...] in the United Nations — but it left {{the issue of}} Taiwan's representation unresolved in a practical sense. The ROC government continues to hold control over Taiwan and other islands. While the PRC claims sovereignty over all of [...] "China" [...] and claims that Taiwan is part of China, it does not exercise sovereignty over Taiwan, and has never done so. President Ma Ying-jeou said, [...] "The Republic of China is a sovereign country, and mainland China <b>is</b> <b>part</b> <b>of</b> <b>our</b> territory according to the Constitution. Therefore, our relations with the mainland are not international relations. It is a special relationship".|$|E

2500|$|In another {{scene in}} which a {{character}} dies from solar exposure among the ashes from cremated bodies, massive wind turbines propelled biodegradable dust at the actor in the director's attempt to have the computer-generated effects follow the actor instead of vice versa. Boyle commented on his approach to using effects, [...] "There <b>is</b> <b>part</b> <b>of</b> <b>our</b> brain where we admire the effect, but we {{put it in a}} side compartment of our experience because you know there's no way an actor can live through that, or be there in that moment." [...] During the post-production process, Boyle hired one visual effects company, London's Moving Picture Company, to work on the film's 750 visual effects. The assignment of a single company was contrary to the industry trend of hiring multiple vendors to work on a film's effects. Boyle chose one company for ease of quality control, though the decision resulted in a prolonged post-production process.|$|E
2500|$|Gender {{identity}} and roles {{play an important}} part in Mormon theology which teaches a strict binary of spiritual gender as literal offspring of divine parents. Part of Sunday Church meetings are currently divided by biological sex, and for most of the 1800s church presidents Joseph Smith and Brigham Young had men, women, and children set separately for all Sunday meetings. Expressions and identities for sexuality and gender are [...] "separate, but related" [...] aspects of a person and stem from similar biological origins. As far as gender minorities, Church leaders have stated that they have unfinished business in teaching on the difficult and sensitive topic of transgender individuals. Church spokesman Eric Hawkins stated in March 2016 that LDS bishops recognize that [...] "each case is different" [...] and [...] "difficult and sensitive" [...] and that they recognize the [...] "emotional pain" [...] many gender minorities feel. He also reaffirmed the church's views that [...] "gender <b>is</b> <b>part</b> <b>of</b> <b>our</b> eternal God-given {{identity and}} purpose" [...] and stated that the Church does not baptize [...] "those who are planning trans-sexual operations" [...] and that undergoing a [...] "trans-sexual operation" [...] may imperil the membership of a church member.|$|E
2500|$|Within the church, {{there have}} also been a number of {{unofficial}} statements regarding gender. For example, [...] "Strengthening Our Families: An In-Depth Look at the Proclamation on the Family" [...] (a book compiled by the School of Family Life at the church-owned Brigham Young University) states, [...] "Although we do not fully understand the eternal nature of gender, we should acknowledge its meaning and purpose, and humbly seek to understand and appreciate the nature of divine gender distinctions in God's plan for His children." [...] The book also states: God created us male and female. This is not a mistake or a variety of genetic or hormonal chance. What we call gender is an essential characteristic of our existence prior to our birth. Gender <b>is</b> <b>part</b> <b>of</b> <b>our</b> eternal identity and essential to our eternal progression. Although we may not know all the reasons why this is so, we do know some of the reasons why gender is essential to our eternal progression. To achieve our exaltation, an eternal marriage {{between a man and a}} woman is necessary. ...The sexual union between a married man and woman is, among other things, the means God has ordained to bring His spirit children into mortality, which is an essential step in the plan of salvation.|$|E

2500|$|At {{the most}} basic level of being-in-the-world, Heidegger notes that {{there is always a}} mood, a mood that [...] "assails us" [...] in our unreflecting devotion to the world. A mood comes neither from the [...] "outside" [...] nor from the [...] "inside," [...] but arises from being-in-the-world. One may turn away from a mood but that is only to another mood; it <b>is</b> <b>part</b> <b>of</b> <b>our</b> facticity. Only with a mood are we {{permitted}} to encounter things in the world. Dasein (a co-term for being-in-the-world) has an openness to the world that is constituted by the attunement of a mood or state of mind. As such, Dasein is a [...] "thrown" [...] "projection" [...] (geworfen Entwurf), projecting itself onto the possibilities that lie before it or may be hidden, and interpreting and understanding {{the world in terms of}} possibilities. Such projecting has nothing to do with comporting oneself toward a plan that has been thought out. It is not a plan, since Dasein has, as Dasein, already projected itself. Dasein always understands itself in terms of possibilities. As projecting, the understanding of Dasein is its possibilities as possibilities. One can take up the possibilities of [...] "The They" [...] self and merely follow along or make some more authentic understanding (see Hubert Dreyfus's book Being-in-the-World.) ...|$|E

He left for France in 1977 after 10 years in Israel. He is chairman of Peace Now in France. He said the group seeks to support Israel's long-term future because [...] "as friends, as Jews, we {{want to tell you that}} you are going down a wrong path. I think our initiative is actually helping Israel's image in Europe. It is a pretty low image over here these days, because of what happened in Gaza, mainly, and it is commonly believed in Europe that Israel is the provocative, negative side of the conflict—the one that is blocking the peace process." [...] He claimed that [...] "We’re not saying that only Israel is responsible for the problem. As Jews tied to Israel, we speak to the Israelis. So this is a call to the Israelis, but of course [...] have a lot of the responsibility for the continuation of the conflict." [...] He affirmed, on behalf of the membership that [...] "our connection to the state of Israel <b>is</b> <b>part</b> <b>of</b> <b>our</b> identity," [...] but in Europe [...] "Israel is seen as responsible for all the problems [...]" [...] Chemla added that the group's was not a movement as such after the first petition but hoped to become one.|$|E
