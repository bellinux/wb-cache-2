40|$|AbstractNel-like protein 1 (NELL- 1) is an osteoinductive {{molecule}} {{associated with}} premature calvarial suture closure. Here we identified apoptosis related protein 3 (APR 3), a membrane protein {{known as a}} proliferation suppressor, as a binding protein of NELL- 1 by biopanning. NELL- 1 and APR 3 colocalized on the nuclear envelope of human osteoblasts. NELL- 1 significantly inhibited proliferation of osteoblasts co-transfected with APR 3 through further down-regulation of Cyclin D 1. The co-expression of NELL- 1 and APR 3 enhanced Ocn and Bsp expression and mineralization. RNAi of APR 3 significantly reduced the differentiation effect of NELL- 1. These {{findings suggest that the}} effects of NELL- 1 on osteoblastic differentiation and proliferation are partly through binding to APR 3.

40|$|AbstractVirB 8 is a {{critical}} component of the Brucella suis type IV secretion system (T 4 SS). We previously showed that the transmembrane (TM) domain plays an essential role in interactions of this protein with itself and the other proteins of the T 4 SS. We report that a point mutation in this TM domain stabilizes homodimers of VirB 8 and heterodimers with VirB 10. A similar variant of Agrobacterium tumefaciens VirB 8 showed the same phenotype. The B. suis VirB 8 variant was unable to complement a virB 8 mutant and displayed a dominant negative phenotype when expressed in wild type B. suis.

A sequence containing two of the six WD motifs {{in the middle of}} CRN 7 was responsible for the interaction. CRN 7 enhanced the polyubiquitination of Tob in vitro, and overexpression of CRN 7 promoted proteasome-dependent degradation of Tob.
