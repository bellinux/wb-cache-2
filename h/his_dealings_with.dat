5|$|Forster's {{attitude}} {{brought him}} into conflict {{with the people of}} the different nations he encountered and made him welcome nowhere, as he was too revolutionary and antinational for Germans, proud and opposing in <b>his</b> <b>dealings</b> <b>with</b> Englishmen, too unconcerned about Polish science for Poles, and too insignificant politically and ignored while in France.|$|E
5|$|Aside from {{painting}} Bảo Đại as {{a sexually}} insatiable glutton, Diệm's campaign also attacked {{the head of}} state's nationalist credentials. They criticised him as being too soft in <b>his</b> <b>dealings</b> <b>with</b> French colonial authorities, and for serving {{as the head of}} state of the Empire of Vietnam, a puppet regime set up by Imperial Japan after they invaded during World War II. They also accused him of ceding half the country to the communists. The communists had already captured more than half the country on the battlefield, and Diệm claimed he had no choice, but Diệm's campaign portrayed him as incompetent and unwilling to take the blame.|$|E

5|$|Washington gained {{valuable}} military skills {{during the}} war, acquiring tactical, strategic, and logistical military experience. He also acquired important political skills in <b>his</b> <b>dealings</b> <b>with</b> the British military establishment and the provincial government. His military exploits, although they included some notable failures, made his military {{reputation in the}} colonies such that he became a natural selection as {{the commander in chief}} of the Continental Army following the outbreak of the American Revolutionary War in 1775. His successes in military and political spheres during that conflict led to his election as the first President of the United States of America.|$|E
5|$|After Kidd's {{arrival in}} Boston on 3 July, Bellomont demanded from Kidd a written {{account of his}} travels, which Kidd, after haggling over the time, agreed to deliver {{on the morning of}} 6 July. When he did not do so, Bellomont issued a warrant for his arrest. It was {{executed}} as Kidd was en route to see Bellomont at midday the same day. Kidd then attempted to negotiate his freedom, using the secret locations of his treasure and a captured prize ship as bargaining chips. Although a portion of Kidd's treasure was recovered, it did not buy Kidd's freedom, and he was shipped to London in April 1700, where he was tried, convicted, and hanged. In contrast to the relative secrecy with which he conducted some of his communications with Kidd, Bellomont was scrupulous in <b>his</b> <b>dealings</b> <b>with</b> other potentially questionable merchant and pirate business, despite being offered as much as £5,000 to overlook illicit activities.|$|E
5|$|In 1960, Danny Greene and his {{childhood}} friends Billy McComber and Art Sneperger are longshoremen at the Cleveland docks. Meanwhile, the members are exploited by corrupt union boss, Jerry Merke {{and the leadership}} of the ILA union urges Greene to run against him. Meanwhile, Sneperger can't pay a gambling debt to Cleveland Mafia Capo John Nardi. In return for Sneperger's debt being forgiven, Greene supplies Nardi's crew with goods stolen from the docks. Merke finds out, demands a cut of Greene's profits, and then sends an enforcer to kill him. Instead, Greene beats up the enforcer, then beats up Merke, throws the union leader out of his office, and is later elected union president.

5|$|In April 1829, Nicolls was {{appointed}} Superintendent of Fernando Po (now Bioko), a tropical island immediately {{off the coast}} of Africa, which the West Africa Squadron used as a base for operations against the slave trade. Nicolls received the appointment after colonial administrator and anti-slave trade crusader William Fitzwilliam Owen had refused the post, and after merchant John Beecroft was deemed unfit for the post. Owen, however, voiced his dissatisfaction with what he viewed as Nicolls's harsh rule on the island, and Beecroft increased his influence in the area. Nicolls, in turn, attacked Beecroft for <b>his</b> <b>dealings</b> <b>with</b> former slavers. Nicolls's health suffered in Fernando Po and by April 1830 he had left for Ascension. When Nicolls returned to England ill, Beecroft was placed in temporary charge of the island.|$|E
5|$|In {{the summer}} of 1778, George Washington ordered Major Benjamin Tallmadge to form the Culper Ring. This group was {{composed}} of a select few trustworthy individuals whose purpose was to collect information about the British movements and activities in New York City. The Ring is famous for uncovering Benedict Arnold's intentions of treason, which shocked Washington because Arnold was someone who had {{contributed significantly to the}} war effort. Arnold was embittered by <b>his</b> <b>dealings</b> <b>with</b> Congress over rank and finances, as well as the alliance with France, so he conspired with the British in a plan to seize the post that he commanded at West Point. Washington just missed apprehending him, but did capture his co-conspirator Major John André, a British intelligence officer under Clinton who was hanged by order of a court-martial called by Washington.|$|E
5|$|In {{the early}} spring of 313, as Licinius {{advanced}} against Maximinus, the latter resorted to savagery in <b>his</b> <b>dealings</b> <b>with</b> his own citizens, and his Christians in particular. In May 313, Maximinus issued one more edict of toleration, hoping to persuade Licinius to stop advancing, and win more public support. For the first time, Maximinus issued a law which offered comprehensive toleration {{and the means to}} effectively secure it. As in his earlier letter, Maximinus is apologetic but one-sided. Maximinus absolves himself for all the failings of his policy, locating fault with local judges and enforcers instead. He frames the new universal toleration as a means of removing all ambiguity and extortion. Maximinus then declares full freedom of religious practice, encourages Christians to rebuild their churches, and pledges to restore Christian property lost in the persecution. The edict changed little: Licinius defeated Maximinus at the Battle of Adrianople on April 30, 313; the now-powerless Maximinus committed suicide at Tarsus in the summer of 313. On June 13, Licinius published the Edict of Milan in Nicomedia.|$|E

5|$|Jones {{was accused}} (in a lawsuit brought by Mona Brewer against Earl Paulk of Chapel Hill Harvester Church) of using {{money from a}} $125 million green space bond sale to {{purchase}} a Decatur, GA church building from Paulk for $2.4 million, a sum claimed to be unjustifiably {{in excess of the}} land's actual value. The County made no use of the property, and was the building was later leased to a start-up cable network for a token sum of a dollar per year. During the ensuing court case, the plaintiff alleged that, as part of a questionable relationship, Paulk arranged for a sexual encounter between Jones and one of Paulk's former mistresses. When deposed, Jones refused to answer questions relating to that incident, {{as well as a number}} of other questions involving <b>his</b> <b>dealings</b> <b>with</b> Paulk. That case was ultimately withdrawn by the plaintiff's attorney, Louis Levenson, who felt that the judge in the case was biased against his client. The case was subsequently refiled and drew a different judge.|$|E
5|$|After {{all that}} has been said and done, {{what are we to}} make of Lloyd George’s legacy as a war leader? On the home front he {{achieved}} varied results in tackling difficult, and in some instances, unprecedented problems. It would be hard to have improved on <b>his</b> <b>dealings</b> <b>with</b> labour and the program to increase homegrown food, but in the sectors of manpower, price control and food distribution he adopted the same approach as his predecessor, taking action only in response to the changing nature of the conflict. In the vital area of national morale, while he did not have the technical advantages of Churchill, his personal conduct damaged his ability to do more to inspire the nation. All things considered, it is unlikely that any of his political contemporaries could have handled matters at home as effectively as he did, although it can be argued that if someone else had been in charge, the difference would not have been sufficient to change the final outcome. In his conduct of the war he did advance the cause of the Entente significantly in some ways, but in determining strategy, one of the most important tasks for which a prime minister must be responsible, he was undeniably a failure. To sum up, while Lord George's contributions outweighed his mistakes, the margin is too narrow, in my opinion, to include him In the pantheon of Britain's outstanding war leaders.|$|E
5|$|As {{early as}} 1786, Marshall had been implicating several {{prominent}} Kentucky politicians in {{a scheme to}} take Kentucky out of the Union and into alliance with Spain. After the expiration of his Senate term, he resumed these charges {{through the pages of}} the Western World newspaper. His allegations resulted in a legislative investigation of Kentucky Court of Appeals judge Benjamin Sebastian, who was found to be receiving a pension from Spain and resigned from the bench. Federal judge Harry Innes was also a target of Marshall's allegations, and the two became embroiled in a legal battle that lasted almost a decade. Innes hired William Littell to write and publish a book giving Innes' version of <b>his</b> <b>dealings</b> <b>with</b> Spain. Marshall countered by publishing his History of Kentucky in 1812. Although blatantly partisan, it became the most widely read history of the state at the time. Marshall and Innes ended their legal battle with an agreement, signed in 1815, that neither would publish anything negative about the other again. Innes upheld his part of the agreement, but in 1824, years after Innes' death, Marshall published an updated edition of his History of Kentucky which was just as vitriolic as the previous version had been. Marshall faded from public life during his later years. He died at the home of his son in Lexington, Kentucky on July 3, 1841.|$|E

5|$|From Conakry, Penfold also {{assisted}} Kabbah {{in negotiations}} with Sandline International—a private military company led by Tim Spicer, a former British Army officer—whom Kabbah intended to hire to lead a counter-coup. Sandline had been contracted to provide assistance to the Nigerian-led forces in Sierra Leone {{at a time when}} relations between the UK and Nigeria were poor, so Penfold used Sandline personnel to liaise with the Nigerians to provide intelligence for Kabbah and the British High Commission. In February 1998, a coalition of Nigerian troops and local militia—assisted by Sandline—restored Kabbah to power, and Penfold was transported back to Freetown by a British warship. The role of Sandline, however, sparked a political controversy in the United Kingdom, as the company was accused of violating an international arms embargo on Sierra Leone. Penfold was ordered back to the UK, where he was investigated by HM Customs and Excise for allegedly assisting Spicer in violating the embargo. Customs dropped their investigation after deciding it was not in the public interest to prosecute anybody, but Foreign Secretary Robin Cook ordered a parliamentary inquiry into what the FCO knew about Sandline's contract with Kabbah. Penfold received a reprimand for failing to report adequately on <b>his</b> <b>dealings</b> <b>with</b> Sandline, and the inquiry—led by Sir Thomas Legg—recommended better communication between the FCO and the high commissioner.|$|E
