30|$|The first {{heat release}} rate method was a thermal {{compensation}} method for measuring {{heat release rate}} prior the development of OCC (Thompson and Cousins 1959). The method was implemented in the FM Roof Calorimeter. Simple temperature and flow measurements in the exhaust stream {{were found to be}} of low fidelity due to heat losses in the exhaust system. The OSU Calorimeter (Smith 1971), an early bench scale test for measuring heat release rate, used this method. Measurements of carbon dioxide and carbon monoxide have also been used with exhaust flow rate measurements to determine heat release rate (Tewarson and Tamanini 1976, Tewarson and Pion 1977). However, the heat release rate per mass of carbon dioxide/carbon monoxide is more dependent on the composition of the fuel than is oxygen consumption, and measuring heat release rate using carbon dioxide and carbon monoxide (and other <b>hydrocarbon</b> <b>measurements)</b> is more complex, expensive and time consuming to perform.|$|E

Mole ratios of squalene to DPL up to 9 to 1 were studied. In contrast to small, nonpolar molecules, which profoundly influence the structure of lipid bilayers as detected by changes in both their thermodynamic phase transition parameters and membrane fluidity, this large, nonpolar, linear hydrocarbon is devoid of such influences. It is clear from our data that a large nonpolar molecule such as squalene, having no polar group that might anchor it to the aqueous interface, cannot intercalate between the acyl chains either below or above the phase transition of DPL. This behavior is not compatible with models that treat the bilayer interior as a bulk hydrocarbon, and suggests that great caution should be exercised in extrapolating partition coefficients based on bulk <b>hydrocarbon</b> <b>measurements</b> to lipid bilayers...|$|E

40|$|Methyl esters of soybean oil, {{known as}} biodiesel, are {{receiving}} increasing attention {{as an alternative}} fuel for diesel engines. Biodiesel is a nontoxic, biodegradable, and renewable fuel {{with the potential to}} reduce engine exhaust emissions. However, previous results have shown that biodiesel produces a higher fraction of soluble organic material (SOF) in the exhaust particulate matter than petroleum-based diesel fuel although its total particulate emissions were lowered. Also, because biodiesel has a high boiling point and low volatility compared with diesel fuel, its unburned hydrocarbon vapor could be lost by deposition in the hydrocarbon sampling line. This loss could be the source of reported reductions in hydrocarbon emissions from biodiesel-fueled engines. No information about whether the typical measurement temperature for unburned hydrocarbons is suitable for biodiesel <b>hydrocarbon</b> <b>measurement</b> is available. In this project, the formation of SOF in diesel exhaust particulates and the deposition of hydrocarbons in heated sampling lines were studied experimentally and theoretically;The experimental results showed that biodiesel produced a higher SOF fraction in its total particulates than diesel fuel under virtually all engine operating conditions. The SOF fraction decreased with increasing filter temperature at constant dilution ratio and with increasing dilution ratio at constant filter temperature. Biodiesel injection tests, where a small quantity of neat biodiesel was injected into the exhaust gas showed that most of the unburned biodiesel showed up in the soluble organic fraction of the collected particulates. The response of the heated flame ionization detector did not match the concentration change of unburned biodiesel in the exhaust gas. Based on the predicted results from condensation and multicomponent adsorption models, adsorption of vapor phase hydrocarbons on the carbon particle surface is the primary source of the SOF in the total particulate matter. The condensation process, by itself, cannot explain the formation of SOF during the dilution process. Adsorption of hydrocarbons is also shown to take place during transport of the hydrocarbon sample, even at high temperature. At the standard <b>hydrocarbon</b> <b>measurement</b> temperature, adsorption onto the sampling line walls could affect the concentration of unburned hydrocarbons and biodiesel in the exhaust gas sample.

These conditions were known for their characteristically high hydrocarbon emissions predominantly from over-mixed and under-mixed mixture zones, respectively. The investigation was carried out to supplement current findings in the literature with valuable information on the formation of high hydrocarbon emissions with increasing swirl levels generated by intake-port throttling. This was achieved through the use of cycle-resolved high <b>hydrocarbon</b> <b>measurements</b> in addition to cycle averaged emissions and in-cylinder pressure-derived metrics. While there was negligible overall effect at the moderately dilute low-load conditions, increasing swirl {{has been shown to be}} beneficial to premixing efficacy under highly dilute conditions with extended ignition delay.

In addition, we provide BC emission according to the age categorization of the vehicles – a feature not represented in the previous studies and yet important for policy makers. In our estimation, we adopt an emission factor (EF) based approach with an aim to estimate the emissions for the year 2010. Emission factors (EFs) are relations between a specific emission and the concerned activity leading to that emission, and normally determined in an empirical manner. Road vehicle EFs represent a quantity of pollutants emitted given a unit distance driven, amount of fuel used or energy consumed [24]. In addition to an EF-based technique, many other techniques are being used in the community for quantifying emissions from a large number of real world vehicles.

The measurements were carried out over the period March 1991 -February 1997. The concentrations at the sites, with 100 - 150 km distance between them, are quite similar and they are predominantly determined by large-scale transport. The concentrations in this part of the country are substantially higher than those observed at a coastal site in the north of The Netherlands, but much lower compared to the concentrations in cities and near streets. A distinct difference between the trends of aromatics and aliphatics was observed. The concentrations of the aromatic components display trends that are systematically 4 - 5 % yr- 1 lower than the trends of the aliphatics, which is possibly related to the increased use of catalysts in cars and, partly, to an enhanced atmospheric chemical activity. For the chlorinated species the trends are highly significant. The trend of 1, 1, 1 -trichloroethane is in the order of 8 - 12 % yr- 1 downward while for tetrachloromethane an annual downward trend of 4 - 6 % is found.

Several ozone depletion events and concurrent decreases in hydrocarbon concentrations relative to their background levels were observed at Alert and Narwhal ice camp. At Narwhal, a long period (≥ 7 days) of ozone depletion was observed during which a clear decay of alkane concentration occurred. A kinetic analysis led to a calculated Cl atom concentration of 4. 5 × 10 ³ cm⁻³ during this period.

40|$|Incineration is a {{promising}} technique for {{the disposal of}} organic hazardous wastes. However, the waste destruction characteristics of turbulent spray flames have not been characterized. In the present research two reactors are used to simulate various aspects of liquid injection incinerator flame zones. The following questions are addressed: (1) Under what conditions do flames quantitatively destroy waste compounds, and (2) how must the flame be perturbed to cause it to fail to quantitatively destroy wastes. The two reactors operated on a simulated waste stream consisting of acrylonitrile, benzene, chlorobenzene, and chloroform. A microspray reactor was used to investigate destruction processes associated with individual droplets of waste compounds. A turbulent flame reactor used a heptane-fueled waste-doped turbulent spray flame to simulate incinerator flame-zone processes. The flames {{were found to be}} capable of quantitative waste destruction without the necessity of using common post-flame processes such as afterburners. Furthermore, the high waste destruction efficiency conditions corresponded to high combustion efficiency conditions (i. e., minimum CO and hydrocarbon emissions). Failure to achieve high destruction efficiency resulted from the perturbation of flame parameters. Failure conditions were identified with high and low theoretical air, low temperature, poor atomization quality, and flame impingement on a cold surface. Each failure condition also resulted in elevated CO and hydrocarbon emissions.

Seveal areas of concern are: 1. exposure of airport workers and urban residents to toxic chemicals emitted when the engines operate at low power (idle and taxi) on the ground; 2. contributions to urban photochemical air pollution of aircraft volatile organic and nitrogen oxides emissions from operations around airports; and 3. emissions of nitrogen oxides and particles during high-altitude operation. The environmental impact of chemicals emitted from jet aircraft turbine engines has not been firmly established due to lack of data regarding emission rates and identities of the compounds emitted. This paper describes an experimental study of two different aircraft turbine engines designed to determine detailed organic emissions, as well as emissions of inorganic gases.

Therefore, it is critical to understand pollutant emission rates for office equipment because even low emissions in areas that are under-ventilated or where individuals are in close proximity to the pollutant source can result in important indoor exposures. We reviewed existing literature reports on pollutant emission by office equipment, and measured emission factors of equipment with significant market share in California.

40|$|With highly {{efficient}} modem catalysts, startup HC emissions {{have become a}} significant portion of the trip total. Liquid fuel is a major source of HC emissions during the cold start and fast idle period. Thus the control of liquid fuel, particularly during startup, is required for future engine designs. The effect of a turbulence plate, or charge motion control valve, on the port liquid fuel mass is examined. A purging process was used to examine the effect of a charge motion control plate on the port fuel film mass. It was found that the charge motion plate can provide substantial reductions in both the total and downstream intake fuel film mass. These reductions are the result of the increased intake turbulence that results from the charge motion plate. This increased turbulence provides enhanced fuel - air mixing and increases port film strip atomization due to the increased viscous shear. The effect of different film locations was postulated and backed experimentally. The downstream and valve films have the most immediate effect on the fuel delivery. Large upstream films, which can take thousands of cycles to develop, influence the fuel delivery on a much longer time scale. (cont.) In-cylinder <b>hydrocarbon</b> <b>measurements</b> were made.

40|$|International audienceDuring the Mediterranean Intensive Oxidant Study (MINOS) {{campaign}} in August 2001 gas-phase organic compounds were measured using comprehensive two-dimensional gas chromatography (GC×GC) at the Finokalia ground station, Crete. In this paper, C 7 ?C 11 aromatic and n-alkane measurements are presented and interpreted. The mean mixing ratios of the hydrocarbons varied from 1 +/? 1 pptv (i-propylbenzene) to 43 +/? 36 pptv (toluene). The observed mixing ratios showed strong day-to-day variations and generally higher levels {{during the first}} half of the campaign. Mean diel profiles showed maxima at local midnight and late morning, and minima in the early morning and evening. Results from analysis using a simplified box model suggest that both the chemical sink (i. e. reaction with OH) and the variability of source strengths were the causes of the observed variations in hydrocarbon mixing ratios. The logarithms of hydrocarbon concentrations were negatively correlated with the OH concentrations integral over a day prior to the <b>hydrocarbon</b> <b>measurements.</b> Slopes of the regression lines derived from these correlations for different compounds are compared with literature rate constants for their reactions with OH. The slopes for most compounds agree reasonably well with the literature rate constants. A sequential reaction model has been applied to the interpretation of the relationship between ethylbenzene and two of its potential products, i. e. acetophenone and benzeneacetaldehyde. The model can explain the good correlation observed between [acetophenone]/[ethylbenzene] and [benzeneacetaldehyde]/[ethylbenzene]. The model results and field measurements suggest that the reactivity of benzeneacetaldehyde may lie between those of acetophenone and ethylbenzene and that the ratio between yields of acetophenone and benzeneacetaldehyde may be up to 28 : 1. Photochemical ages of trace gases sampled at Finokalia during the campaign are estimated using the sequential reaction model and related data. They lie in the range of about 0. 5 ? 2. 5 days...|$|E
40|$|The {{hydroxyl}} (OH) radical is {{a common}} intermediate species in any hydrogen- or hydrocarbon-based flame. Investigating OH at elevated temperatures and pressures is not a trivial task, and many considerations {{must be made to}} fully study the molecule. Shock tubes can provide the experimenter {{with a wide range of}} temperatures and pressures to investigate a variety of combustion characteristics including, but not limited to, OH kinetic profiles. Described in this dissertation is the diagnostic used to measure OH within a shock tube using UV absorption spectroscopy from an enhanced UV Xenon lamp passed through a spectrometer. OH absorption was made over a narrow range of wavelengths around 309. 551 nm within the widely studied OH X?A ground vibrational transition region. Experiments have been performed in the shock-tube facility at Texas A&M University using this OH absorption diagnostic. A calibration mixture of stoichiometric H 2 /O 2 diluted in 98 % argon by volume was tested initially and compared with a well-known hydrogen-based kinetics mechanism to generate an absorption coefficient correlation. This correlation is valid over the range of conditions observed in the experiments at two pressures near 2 and 13 atm and temperatures from 1182 to 2017 K. Tests were completed using the absorption coefficient correlation on stoichiometric mixtures of methane, methane and water, ethane, ethylene, and acetylene to compare against a comprehensive, detailed chemical kinetics mechanism which considers up through C 5 <b>hydrocarbons.</b> <b>Measurements</b> of methane show good agreement in peak OH formation and ignition delay time when compared with the mechanism. Improvements can be made in the shape of the methane-oxygen OH profile, and sensitivity and rate of production analyses were performed with the mechanism to identify key reactions for tuning. Similar results were found for methane-water-oxygen mixtures with no difference in profile shape or ignition delay time noted. There is room for improvement between the mechanism and measured values of OH for ethane-, ethylene-, and acetylene-based mixtures, although interesting pre-ignition features are nonetheless captured relatively well by the mechanism. Uncertainty in the measurement comes from the inherent noise in the photomultiplier tube signal and is ? 25 - 150 ppm for the 2 -atm experiments and ? 6 - 25 ppm for the 13 -atm experiments...|$|R
40|$|The main {{sources of}} {{volatile}} organic compounds (VOCs) in the Metropolitan Area of Sao Paulo (MASP) are vehicular emissions. The addition of ethanol to gasoline results in increased emissions of some carbonyl compounds inducing a problem in photochemical smog formation in urban areas. At the same time, tropospheric ozone {{represents one of the}} main atmospheric pollutants in MASP. The megacities {{play an important role in}} atmospheric chemistry and climate that not only affects local populations but also in regional and global scale. In São Paulo state, controlling ozone levels is a priority, not only in the urban area but also in the neighboring cities and agricultural areas affected by the photochemical precursors and ozone coming from the megacity. Since this pollutant is formed in the atmosphere by photochemical reactions that depend on VOCs concentrations, NOx and UV radiation (l≤ 394 nm), the current study presents data from continuous sampling and analysis of their precursors in SP city. Hourly ozone and NOx were measured during the sampling campaign. Automatic <b>hydrocarbons</b> <b>measurements</b> were carried out 24 hours a day during 2012 and analyzed on a CG-FID coupled to thermal desorption unit. Meanwhile carbonyl compounds were collected every 2 -hour between 8 a. m. to 6 p. m. and analyzed by HPLC. During the sampling period were obtained 110 samples of carbonyls compounds and more than 800 samples of hydrocarbons. The results indicated that most abundant hydrocarbons were toluene, ethane, propylene, propane, ethylene, 2 -methylpentane, trans- 2 -butene, cis- 2 - butene and 1 -butene which are related with a greater photochemical ozone potential formation following the MIR reactivity scale of Carter. The average mixing ratios of carbonyls were 9. 8 and 5. 8 ppbv for formaldehyde and acetaldehyde respectively. Statistical analyses were applied. High correlations between aromatic compounds were found, and a negative correlation of some hydrocarbons with the ozone. The hourly time average evolution shows that most of the compounds follow a similar pattern, which is inversed to the compared ozone daily pattern. The study demonstrates that the ambient concentration of aldehydes has presented a significant reduction over the years. FAPESPFAPERJCNP...|$|R
