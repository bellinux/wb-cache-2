40|$|PV module designs using {{glass plates}} as front and as back covers {{are often used}} to {{minimize}} moisture ingress. Both effects, moisture ingress and moisture leakage are found {{to contribute to the}} degradation of the PV-modules. The moisture transport for different material combinations for PV modules was numerically simulated by Finite Element Methods (FEM) and validated by permeation tests [1]. Previously simulated water vapor ingress through back sheets is compared to simulations on water vapor ingress through edge sealants. <b>Edge</b> <b>sealant</b> properties were determined in a literature survey. Finally, a new in-house developed upgrade for the permeation test method enables measurements of edge sealants based on the existing permeation equipment...|$|E
40|$|A step-stress {{accelerated}} degradation testing (SSADT) {{method was}} employed {{for the first}} time to evaluate the stability of CuInGaSe 2 (CIGS) solar cells and device component materials in four Al-framed test structures encapsulated with an <b>edge</b> <b>sealant</b> and three kinds of backsheet or moisture barrier film for moisture ingress control. The SSADT exposure used a 15 oC and then a 15 % relative humidity (RH) increment step, beginning from 40 oC/ 40 %RH (T/RH = 40 / 40) to 85 oC/ 70 %RH (85 / 70) as of the moment. The voluminous data acquired and processed as of total DH = 3956 h with 85 / 70 = 704 h produced the following results. The best CIGS solar cells in sample Set- 1 with a moisture-permeable TPT backsheet showed essentially identical I-V degradation trend regardless of the Al-doped ZnO (AZO) layer thickness ranging from standard 0. 12 &# 956;m to 0. 50 &# 956;m on the cells. No clear 'stepwise' feature in the I-V parameter degradation curves corresponding to the SSADT T/RH/time profile was observed. Irregularity in I-V performance degradation pattern was observed with some cells showing early degradation at low T/RH < 55 / 55 and some showing large Voc, FF, and efficiency degradation due to increased series Rs (ohm-cm 2) at T/RH &# 8805; 70 / 70. Results of (electrochemical) impedance spectroscopy (ECIS) analysis indicate degradation of the CIGS solar cells corresponded to increased series resistance Rs (ohm) and degraded parallel (minority carrier diffusion/recombination) resistance Rp, capacitance C, overall time constant Rp*C, and 'capacitor quality' factor (CPE-P), which were related to the cells? p-n junction properties. Heating at 85 / 70 appeared to benefit the CIGS solar cells as indicated by the largely recovered CPE-P factor. Device component materials, Mo on soda lime glass (Mo/SLG), bilayer ZnO (BZO), AlNi grid contact, and CdS/CIGS/Mo/SLG in test structures with TPT showed notable to significant degradation at T/RH &# 8805; 70 / 70. At T/RH = 85 / 70, substantial blistering of BZO layers on CIGS cell pieces was observed that was not seen on BZO/glass, and a CdS/CIGS sample displayed a small darkening and then flaking feature. Additionally, standard AlNi grid contact was less stable than thin Ni grid contact at T/RH &# 8805; 70 / 70. The <b>edge</b> <b>sealant</b> and moisture-blocking films were effective to block moisture ingress, as evidenced by the good stability of most CIGS solar cells and device components at T/RH = 85 / 70 for 704 h, and by preservation of the initial blue color on the RH indicator strips. The SSADT experiment is ongoing to be completed at T/RH = 85 / 85...|$|E
40|$|The {{invention}} {{is a novel}} solid {{oxide fuel}} cell (SOFC) stack comprising individual bi-electrode supported fuel cells in which a thin electrolyte is supported between electrodes of essentially equal thickness. Individual cell units are made from graded pore ceramic tape that has been created by the freeze cast method followed by freeze drying. Each piece of graded pore tape later becomes a graded pore electrode scaffold that subsequent to sintering, is made into either an anode or a cathode by means of appropriate solution and thermal treatment means. Each cell unit is assembled by depositing of a thin coating of ion conducting ceramic material upon the side of each of two pieces of tape surface having the smallest pore openings, and then mating the coated surfaces to create an unsintered electrode scaffold pair sandwiching an electrolyte layer. The opposing major outer exposed surfaces of each cell unit is given a thin coating of electrically conductive ceramic, and multiple cell units are stacked, or built up by stacking of individual cell layers, to create an unsintered fuel cell stack. Ceramic or glass edge seals are installed to create flow channels for fuel and air. The cell stack with <b>edge</b> <b>sealants</b> is then sintered into a ceramic monolithic framework. Said solution and thermal treatments means convert the electrode scaffolds into anodes and cathodes. The thin layers of electrically conductive ceramic become the interconnects in the assembled stack...|$|R
40|$|A {{torsion test}} {{recently}} implemented for solid oxide fuel cell sealant materials is analyzed {{as a method}} for measuring the shear strength of sealant for solid oxide fuel cells. The finite element method is used to simulate the stress distribution in the hourglass-shaped steel specimens with intermediate sealant layer with different specimen's dimensions and configurations. Also, it is analyzed how stress concentration changes if the sealant does not completely fill the gap or is squeezed out of gap. The reduction of seal thickness to outer radius ratio results {{in an increase in}} stress concentration at the outer <b>edge</b> of <b>sealant.</b> The developed specimens with a hollow halve steel plate as well as the ones with two hollow halve steel plates appear to be suitable choices for torsional shear strength test, reducing the torque for fracture and stress concentrations. Effects of lack of filling and squeezing out of gap onto the stress distribution are negligible compared to the effect of pre-existing discontinuities...|$|R
50|$|Slate tiles {{are often}} used for {{interior}} and exterior flooring, stairs, walkways and wall cladding. Tiles are installed and set on mortar and grouted along the <b>edges.</b> Chemical <b>sealants</b> {{are often used}} on tiles to improve durability and appearance, increase stain resistance, reduce efflorescence, and increase or reduce surface smoothness. Tiles are often sold gauged, meaning that the back surface is ground for ease of installation. Slate flooring can be slippery when used in external locations subject to rain. Slate tiles were used in 19th century UK building construction (apart from roofs) and in slate quarrying areas such as Blaenau Ffestiniog and Bethesda, Wales {{there are still many}} buildings wholly constructed of slate. Slates can also be set into walls to provide a rudimentary damp-proof membrane. Small offcuts are used as shims to level floor joists. In areas where slate is plentiful it is also used in pieces of various sizes for building walls and hedges, sometimes combined with other kinds of stone. In modern homes slate is often used as table coasters.|$|R
40|$|ABSTRACT: High barrier {{packaging}} {{applications for}} medical, industrial and food packaging often include aluminum foil. Thinner gauges of aluminum foil contain pinholes through which moisture and oxygen {{from the environment}} can enter the package accelerating the degradation of the contents. This paper addresses the impact of foil pinholes and fractures on the oxygen and moisture barrier of multilayer flexible packaging, in theory and in practice using laser-produced pinholes. The analysis shows that the transmission through the pinholes is less than that occurring through exposed <b>sealant</b> <b>edges</b> and much less than that which would take place through non-foil packaging of the same size. BACKGROUND: While metal and glass containers {{have a long history}} of high barrier protection of food and other products, the cost of metal containers and the fragility of glass containers make them less attractive than flexible packaging containing aluminum foil. The aluminum foil is usually the most expensive component of the flexible package and as such the economics drive the use of thinner gauges. Practical considerations of process capability to handle thin foils without excessive web breaks, wrinkles and other factors limit how thin a foil can be produced and converted into packaging. Aluminum foil is produced by one of several processes that include a rolling process where the thickness of one or two sheets is sequentially thinned under compression between rolls. The number and size of pinholes in a thin foil will depend on the filtration of inorganic materials from the molten aluminum, the casting process and the rolling conditions such as lubricant type and lubricant filtration 1. The relationship between foil caliper and allowable number of pinholes can be seen in Table 12...|$|R
40|$|Batteries {{with various}} types of {{chemistries}} are typically sold in rigid hermetically sealed containers that, at the simplest level, must contain the electrolyte while keeping out the exterior atmosphere. However, such rigid containers can have limitations in packaging situations where {{the form of the}} battery is important, such as in hand-held electronics like personal digital assistants (PDAs), laptops, and cell phones. Other limitations exist as well. At least one of the electrode leads must be insulated from the metal can, which necessitates the inclusion of an insulated metal feed-through in the containment hardware. Another limitation may be in hardware and assembly cost, such as exists for the lithium-ion batteries that are being developed for use in electric vehicles (EVs) and hybrid electric vehicles (HEVs). The large size (typically 10 - 100 Ah) of these batteries usually results in electric beam or laser welding of the metal cap to the metal can. The non-aqueous electrolyte used in these batteries are usually based on flammable solvents and therefore require the incorporation of a safety rupture vent to relieve pressure in the event of overcharging or overheating. Both of these features add cost to the battery. Flexible packaging provides an alternative to the rigid container. A common example of this is the multi-layered laminates used in the food packaging industry, such as for vacuum-sealed coffee bags. However, flexible packaging for batteries does not come without concerns. One of the main concerns is the slow egress of the electrolyte solvent through the face of the inner laminate layer and at the <b>sealant</b> <b>edge.</b> Also, moisture and air could enter from the outside via the same method. These exchanges may be acceptable for brief periods of time, but for the long lifetimes required for batteries in electric/hybrid electric vehicles, batteries in remote locations, and those in satellites, these exchanges are unacceptable. Argonne National Laboratory (ANL), in collaboration with several industrial partners, is working on low-cost flexible packaging {{as an alternative to the}} packaging currently being used for lithium-ion batteries [1, 2]. This program is funded by the FreedomCAR & Vehicle Technologies Office of the U. S. Department of Energy. (It was originally funded under the Partnership for a New Generation of Vehicles, or PNGV, Program, which had as one of its mandates to develop a power-assist hybrid electric vehicle with triple the fuel economy of a typical sedan.) The goal in this packaging effort is to reduce the cost associated with the packaging of each cell several-fold to less than $ 1 per cell ({approx} 50 cells are required per battery, 1 battery per vehicle), while maintaining the integrity of the cell contents for a 15 -year lifetime. Even though the battery chemistry of main interest is the lithium-ion system, the methodology used to develop the most appropriate laminate structure will be very similar for other battery chemistries...|$|R
