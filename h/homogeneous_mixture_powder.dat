The stability of aqueous mullite and mullite–CNFs suspensions was studied through zeta potential and rheological behaviour of concentrated slurries.

The obtained powders were characterised through the determination of particle size distribution and morphology by Field Emission Scanning Electron Microscopy (FSEM) and Laser Scattering. The freeze dried powders were used to obtain dense composites by spark plasma sintering.

50|$|The {{simplest}} {{method for}} preparing high-Tc superconductors is a solid-state thermochemical reaction involving mixing, calcination and sintering. The appropriate amounts of precursor powders, usually oxides and carbonates, are mixed thoroughly using a Ball mill. Solution chemistry {{processes such as}} coprecipitation, freeze-drying and sol-gel methods are alternative ways for preparing a <b>homogeneous</b> <b>mixture.</b> These <b>powders</b> are calcined in the temperature range from 800 °C to 950 °C for several hours. The powders are cooled, reground and calcined again. This process is repeated several times to get homogeneous material. The powders are subsequently compacted to pellets and sintered. The sintering environment such as temperature, annealing time, atmosphere and cooling rate play {{a very important role}} in getting good high-Tc superconducting materials. The YBa2Cu3O7−x compound is prepared by calcination and sintering of a <b>homogeneous</b> <b>mixture</b> of Y2O3, BaCO3 and CuO in the appropriate atomic ratio. Calcination is done at 900-950 °C, whereas sintering is done at 950 °C in an oxygen atmosphere. The oxygen stoichiometry in this material is very crucial for obtaining a superconducting YBa2Cu3O7−x compound. At the time of sintering, the semiconducting tetragonal YBa2Cu3O6 compound is formed, which, on slow cooling in oxygen atmosphere, turns into superconducting YBa2Cu3O7−x. The uptake and loss of oxygen are reversible in YBa2Cu3O7−x. A fully oxygenated orthorhombic YBa2Cu3O7−x sample can be transformed into tetragonal YBa2Cu3O6 by heating in a vacuum at temperature above 700 °C.|$|R

40|$|The thesis {{deals with}} the {{preparation}} and testing of ceramic compositions {{to be used as}} bone substitute. The proposed composition consisted of calcium enriched calcium phosphate, kaolin and barium titanate in different ratios. The <b>homogeneous</b> <b>powder</b> <b>mixture</b> was dry pressed at different pressures and fired at temperatures up to 1350 degC for different soaking times. The physical properties of the fired compacts that were tested are bulk density and porosity. These were determined as function of pressing pressure, firing temperature and soaking time for different compositions. The mechanical properties investigated were the ultimate compressive strength and Young's modulus, which were determined for different compositions and forming pressures. The electrical properties investigated were D. C. characteristics (resistivity) and A. C. characteristics (A. C. resistivity, dielectric constant, dielectric loss and loss tangent). The piezoelectric behaviour of the fired compacts was investigated and the piezoelectric coefficient (d) in the axial direction was obtained {{as a function of the}} percent barium titanate added. The development of piezoelectricity when barium titanate is added was interpreted, using XRD, as due to the formation of barium titanate silicate. Compositions determined as having properties comparable to those of natural bone, were tested for in vitro solubility in pure water and saline solution. The results obtained showed that the selected composition (containing 15 % kaolin, 10 % barium titanate, pressed at 35 MPa and fired at 1350 degC for two hours) has properties comparable to those of dry bone and a reasonable in vitro solubility.

40|$|Numerical {{simulations}} {{are carried}} out to study the structure and speed of laminar flames propagating in compositionally and thermally stratified fuel-air mixtures. The study is motivated {{by the need to}} understand the physics of flame propagation in stratified-charge engines and model it. The specific question of interest in this work is: how does the structure and speed of the flame in the stratified mixture differ from that of the flame in a corresponding <b>homogeneous</b> <b>mixture</b> at the same equivalence ratio, temperature, and pressure? The studies {{are carried out}} in hydrogen-air, methane-air, and n-heptane-air mixtures. A 30 -species 184 -step skeletal mechanism is employed for methane oxidation, a 9 -species 21 -step mechanism for hydrogen oxidation, and a 37 -species 56 -step skeletal mechanism for n-heptane oxidation. Flame speed and structure are compared with corresponding values for <b>homogeneous</b> <b>mixtures.</b> ^ For compositionally stratified mixtures, as shown in prior experimental work, the numerical results suggest that when the flame propagates from a richer mixture to a leaner mixture, the flame speed is faster than the corresponding speed in the <b>homogeneous</b> <b>mixture.</b> This is caused by enhanced diffusion of heat and species from the richer mixture to the leaner mixture. In fact, the effects become more pronounced in leaner mixtures. Not surprisingly, the stratification gradient influences the results with shallower gradients showing less effect. The controlling role that diffusion plays is further assessed and confirmed by studying the effect of a unity Lewis number assumption in the hydrogen/air mixtures. Furthermore, the effect of stratification becomes less important when using methane or n-heptane as fuel. ^ The laminar flame speed in a thermally stratified mixture is similar to the laminar flame speed in <b>homogeneous</b> <b>mixture</b> at corresponding unburned temperature. Theoretical analysis is performed and the ratio of extra thermal diffusion rate to flame heat release rate (CTh) is shown to be a parameter that determines the effect of extra thermal diffusion by mixture stratification on flame propagation. Smaller values reflect less impact of stratification. For the cases considered, the values of CTh are quite small. This work suggests that employing the laminar flame speed from a <b>homogeneous</b> <b>mixture</b> to approximate the flame speed (and flame structure) in thermally and compositionally stratified mixtures is reasonable for hydrocarbon/air and hydrogen/air mixtures. ...|$|R
