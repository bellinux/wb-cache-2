5|$|Chapter seven, Settlement, {{concerns}} sedentism – {{the transition}} from a nomadic lifestyle to a society which remains in one place permanently – which began to rise in the Near East {{at the end of the}} Last Glacial Maximum. It required new ways of thought and social organisation; Wade thinks that an evolutionary adaptation for less aggressiveness allowed this change, noting how the skeletons of the ancestral population were less gracile than those of today. Sedentism facilitated the development of agriculture, including the cultivation and domestication of wild cereals and animals. The domestication of cattle in northern Europe and parts of Africa facilitated the spread of a genetic mutation that allowed lactose tolerance, and Wade believes this is evidence of culture and evolution interacting. The following chapter, Sociality, focuses on the common dynamics of human societies, including warfare, religion, trade, and a division of roles between the sexes. Wade theorises that these institutions have an evolutionary basis, and looks at closely related primate societies – such as those of chimpanzees and bonobos – for evidence. Wade goes on to suggest that cannibalism may have been more common in the human past by noting a common <b>genetic</b> <b>adaptation</b> that protects against Creutzfeldt–Jakob disease, which is associated with the consumption of brain.|$|E
25|$|In {{late summer}} and autumn, the plant stops {{producing}} carnivorous leaves, and instead produces flat, non-carnivorous phyllodia. In this species these are highly recurved. The natural habitat of this species dries quickly during July and the small phyllodia are probably easier to maintain with the little water available than its spring pitchers. This is a <b>genetic</b> <b>adaptation</b> and plants kept permanently wet in cultivation also lose their pitchers in mid summer. Also of note is the simultaneous flowering and pitchering {{at the beginning of}} the season as drier conditions prevent later growth of pitchers post flower production.|$|E
25|$|Maize {{was first}} {{grown in the}} eastern United States around 200 BCE, and highly {{productive}} adapted strains became widely used around 900 CE. The spread was so slow because the seeds and knowledge of techniques for tending them had to cross inhospitable deserts and mountains, and more productive varieties of maize had to be developed to compete with indigenous crops and to suit the cooler climates and shorter growing seasons of the northern regions of the continent. Tropical maize does not flower under the long day conditions of summer north of Mexico, requiring <b>genetic</b> <b>adaptation.</b> It seems that maize was adopted first {{as a supplement to}} existing agricultural plants, but gradually came to dominate as its yields increased. Ultimately, the EAC was thoroughly replaced by maize-based agriculture. Most EAC plants are no longer cultivated, and some of them (such as little barley) are regarded as pests by modern farmers.|$|E

2500|$|Hemoglobin C (HbC) is an {{abnormal}} hemoglobin with substitution of a lysine residue for glutamic acid residue of the β-globin chain, {{at exactly the}} same ß-6 position as the HbS mutation. The [...] "C" [...] designation for HbC is from the name of the city where it was discovered—Christchurch, New Zealand. People who have this disease, particularly children, may have episodes of abdominal and joint pain, an enlarged spleen, and mild jaundice, but they do not have severe crises, as occur in sickle cell disease. Haemoglobin C is common in malarious areas of West Africa, especially in Burkina Faso. In a large case–control study performed in Burkina Faso on 4,348 Mossi subjects, that HbC was associated with a 29% reduction in risk of clinical malaria in HbAC heterozygotes and of 93% in HbCC homozygotes. HbC represents a ‘slow but gratis’ <b>genetic</b> <b>adaptation</b> to malaria through a transient polymorphism, compared to the polycentric ‘quick but costly’ adaptation through balanced polymorphism of HbS.|$|E

5000|$|<b>Genetic</b> <b>adaptation</b> to {{fragmented}} habitat — overtime species evolve {{to become}} adapted to their environment. This {{can lead to}} limited fitness {{in the face of}} stochastic changes.

This trait results in a limited ability to avoid predators and disease which could perpetuate further problems in the face of climate change.

40|$|In many human infections, {{hosts and}} {{pathogens}} coexist for years or decades. Important examples include HIV, herpes viruses, tuberculosis, leprosy, and malaria. With {{the exception of}} intensively studied viral infections such as HIV/AIDs, {{little is known about}} the extent to which the clonal expansion that occurs during long-term infection by pathogens involves important <b>genetic</b> <b>adaptations.</b> We report here a detailed, whole-genome analysis of one such infection, that of a cystic fibrosis (CF) patient by the opportunistic bacterial pathogen Pseudomonas aeruginosa. The bacteria underwent numerous <b>genetic</b> <b>adaptations</b> during 8 years of infection, as evidenced by a positive-selection signal across the genome and an overwhelming signal in specific genes, several of which are mutated during the course of most CF infections. Of particular interest is our finding that virulence factors that are required for the initiation of acute infections are often selected against during chronic infections. It is apparent that the genotypes of the P. aeruginosa strains present in advanced CF infections differ systematically from those of “wild-type” P. aeruginosa and that these differences may offer new opportunities for treatment of this chronic disease...|$|R

40|$|Nearly 40 % of {{commercial}} fisheries have now collapsed {{or are in}} serious decline. In response, governments have invested {{millions of dollars into}} artificial breeding programs, but many programs have failed to rehabilitate dwindling wild stocks. This failure may in part lie in the lack of knowledge about the genetic architecture of fitness: the genes and genotypes that are associated with individual performance. In this paper we discuss (i) artificial breeding programs, (ii) the genetic architecture of fitness, (iii) additive and nonadditive genetic effects on fitness, (iv) genetic diversity and evolvability, and (v) natural breeding and adaptation. We argue that most breeding programs do not maintain <b>genetic</b> <b>adaptations</b> and may consequently be ineffective at rehabilitating or enhancing wild populations. Moreover, {{there is no evidence that}} preserving genetic diversity as measured from neutral genetic markers increases fish performance or population viability outside of populations that experience strong inbreeding depression, and limited data that genetic diversity increases the potential for populations to adapt to changing environments. We suggest that artificial breeding programs should be used only as a last resort when populations face imminent extirpation and that such programs must shift the focus from solely preserving genetic diversity to preserving <b>genetic</b> <b>adaptations...</b>|$|R
50|$|According to a {{research}} report published in June 2011, a new variant of swine flu had emerged in Asia with a <b>genetic</b> <b>adaptation</b> (a S247N neuraminidase mutation) giving some resistance to oseltamivir and zanamivir, but no {{significant reduction in}} sensitivity to peramivir. But a H274Y virus mutation showed resistance to oseltamivir and peramivir, but not to zanamivir, and only in N1 neuraminidases. Ultimately 3.2% (19/599) of A(H1N1)pdm09 viruses collected between 2009 and 2012 had highly reduced peramivir inhibition due to the H275Y NA mutation.|$|E
50|$|Genetic {{monitoring}} {{has also}} been increasingly used in studies that monitor environmental changes through changes {{in the frequency of}} adaptively selected markers. For example, the genetically controlled photo-periodic response (hibernating time) of pitcher-plant mosquitos (Wyeomyia smithii) has shifted in response to longer growing seasons for pitcher plants brought on by warmer weather. Experimental wheat populations grown in contrasting environments over a period of 12 generations found that changes in flowering time were closely correlated with regulatory changes in one gene, suggesting a pathway for <b>genetic</b> <b>adaptation</b> to changing climate in plants.|$|E

40|$|Purpose: To {{characterize}} muscle recovery following {{total hip arthroplasty}} (THA) combining <b>genetic</b> <b>adaptations</b> in {{the affected}} leg with objective function and body composition assessment. Methods: Preoperatively and at six weeks postoperatively, objective function was assessed by: maximal voluntary contraction of the operated leg quadriceps (MVCOLQ) in Newtons (N), 30 s chair sit-to-stand (ST), and six-minute walk test (6 MWT), with lean mass of the operated leg estimated by dual energy X-ray absorptiometry (DEXA). <b>Genetic</b> <b>adaptations</b> were assessed from vastus lateralis (VL) biopsies by quantitative polymerase chain reaction (qPCR) analysis of markers of hypertrophy (FOS, calpain 2 (CAPN 2)), atrophy (20 s proteasome alpha subunit 7 (PSMA 7), cathepsin L 2 (CTSL 2), inflammation (Tumour necrosis factor alpha (TNF-Î±), Interleukin- 6 (IL- 6)) and lipid metabolism (lipoprotein lipase, LPL and peroxisome proliferated activated receptor gamma (PPARAG). Results: 14 patients were recruited. At six weeks, no significant differences, relative to preoperative values, were noted in either objective function or leg lean mass. Markers for hypertrophy were increased (FOS + 1463 %, p = 0. 016), with atrophy (PSMA 7 - 44. 8 %, p = 0. 016; CTSL 2 - 42. 5 %, p = 0. 050), inflammation (TNF - 29. 6 %, p = 0. 023) and lipid metabolism markers showing a decreasing trend (LPL - 42. 45 %, p = 0. 016).
