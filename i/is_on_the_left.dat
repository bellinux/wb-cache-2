5|$|McLean's favoured {{position}} is {{as a central}} midfielder, but he can also play as a left midfielder. He {{has said that he}} favours playing in the centre because he can get more of the ball and influence play more than when he <b>is</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>left.</b> He is a naturally attacking player and when playing in the centre he makes runs to and beyond the striker which adds an extra dimension to his team's play.|$|E
5|$|Entrance to the {{platforms}} {{is controlled}} by automatic ticket gates on Platform 3, which is used by many northbound CrossCountry trains and local services to Bristol Parkway and Gloucester. The main station restaurant and bar <b>is</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>left</b> and the short Platform 1, a bay, is beyond this. This is most frequently used by Severn Beach Line trains but is long enough to handle any four-car Diesel Multiple Unit (DMU). Behind Platform 1 is a brick wall that forms part of the signal box and on this are some metal artworks created by artists with learning difficulties to celebrate Brunel's 200th anniversary in 2006; an interpretation panel is nearby. The High Level Siding beyond Platform 1 is the rump of the Bristol Harbour Railway, and Barton Hill traction maintenance depot {{can be seen in}} the distance alongside Bristol East Junction (formerly South Wales Junction) where the lines to Bristol Parkway and Bath diverge.|$|E
5|$|There {{are small}} {{enclosed}} chambers {{to either side}} of the centre chapel. The chapel of St Padarn <b>is</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>left,</b> with an imitation pointed vault and slate slab floor. In the entrance to the chapel there is a window on the left side depicting scenes from the manuscript Life of Padarn. The single-light window with various figures, scenes and motifs is by Elizabeth Edmundson, and dates from 1988. It includes Teilo, Padarn and Dewi (David) at the top, a healing by St Samson, Maelgwn, Arthur and Caradog, two kings of Ireland on horseback and a figure with the Virgin and Child. The figures are mostly modelled on figures from the Book of St Chad. In the chapel itself, which has a low slate altar stone and seat, is a porcelain relief sculpture by Gillian Still showing a story from the Life, the ordeal by boiling water. The chapel is lit only by two small windows (one with red glass, the other green) into the central chapel. Neither the altar stone in the larger room nor that in the chapel of St Padarn have been consecrated so neither are strictly speaking altars, and neither can be used for a Eucharistic service.|$|E

5000|$|A {{mnemonic}} for the aldohexoses is [...] "All Altruists Gladly Make Gum in Gallon Tanks": allose, altrose, glucose, mannose, gulose, idose, galactose, talose.

At carbon 3, <b>the</b> first two <b>are</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> right, <b>the</b> next two <b>are</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>left,</b> and so <b>on.</b> At carbon 4, <b>the</b> first four <b>are</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> right and <b>the</b> rest <b>are</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>left.</b> At carbon 5, all eight D-aldohexoses have <b>the</b> hydroxyl group <b>on</b> <b>the</b> right (because if <b>the</b> hydroxyl group <b>were</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>left</b> instead, due to the [...] system naming convention, they would be L-sugars rather than D-sugars [...] ).|$|R

25|$|During {{the fourth}} week of embryological development, the stomach rotates. The stomach, {{originally}} {{lying in the}} midline of the embryo, rotates so that its body <b>is</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>left.</b> This rotation also affects {{the part of the}} gastrointestinal tube immediately below the stomach, which will go on to become the duodenum. By the end of the fourth week, the developing duodenum begins to spout a small outpouching on its right side, the hepatic diverticulum, which will go on to become the biliary tree. Just below this is a second outpouching, known as the cystic diverticulum, that will eventually develop into the gallbladder.|$|E

A perennial source of water {{has been found in}} the form of a lake and an old quarry site discovered nearby was probably the source for building materials of the type found in Hire Benakal monuments.
