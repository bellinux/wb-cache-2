40|$|Long-period (LP, 0. 5 - 5 Hz) seismicity, {{observed}} at volcanoes worldwide, is a recognized signature of unrest and eruption. Cyclic LP “drumbeating” was the characteristic seismicity accompanying the sustained dome-building {{phase of the}} 2004 – 2008 eruption of Mount St. Helens (MSH), WA. However, together with the LP <b>drumbeating</b> was a near-continuous, randomly occurring series of tiny LP seismic events (LP “subevents”), which may hold important additional information on the mechanism of seismogenesis at restless volcanoes. We employ template matching, phase-weighted stacking, and full-waveform inversion to image the source mechanism of one multiplet of these LP subevents at MSH in July 2005. The signal-to-noise ratios of the individual events are too low to produce reliable waveform inversion results, but the events are repetitive and can be stacked. We apply network-based template matching to 8 days of continuous velocity waveform data from 29 June to 7 July 2005 using a master event to detect 822 network triggers. We stack waveforms for 359 high-quality triggers at each station and component, {{using a combination of}} linear and phase-weighted stacking to produce clean stacks for use in waveform inversion. The derived source mechanism points to the volumetric oscillation (∼ 10 m 3) of a subhorizontal crack located at shallow depth (∼ 30 m) in an area to the south of Crater Glacier in the southern portion of the breached MSH crater. A possible excitation mechanism is the sudden condensation of metastable steam from a shallow pressurized hydrothermal system as it encounters cool meteoric water in the outer parts of the edifice, perhaps supplied from snow melt...|$|E

40|$|Kizimen Volcano {{began to}} erupt in December 2010. The {{eruption}} {{was preceded by}} a precursory period of seismicity that lasted for 20 months. This paper discusses the space-time features of the precursory seismicity. We provide {{a brief description of}} this explosive and effusive eruption between December 2010 and March 2013. The eruption started with some explosive activity followed by extrusion of a viscous lava flow. The extrusion of viscous andesitic magma and the motion of the lava flow down the slope were accompanied by unusual seismicity {{in the form of the}} quasiperiodic occurrence of microearthquakes, the so-called <b>drumbeat</b> phenomenon. It is shown that the occurrence of a <b>drumbeat</b> was first recorded during the extrusion process at the volcano's summit. Subsequently, the <b>drumbeat</b> mode of activity was caused by the front of the viscous lava flow as it was moving down the slope. The dynamic parameters of the microearthquakes varied in accordance with the dimensions of the lava flow front. The motion of the main tongue of the lava flow (March to September 2011) gave rise to <b>drumbeat</b> I with energy classes of microearthquakes K = 3 - 5. 5, while the second tongue, which was smaller than the first, produced <b>drumbeat</b> II with microearthquakes of K < 3 during its motion down the slope. In January 2013 we saw a phenomenon similar to the <b>drumbeat</b> that was recorded at the start of the eruption. This was caused by an obelisk being extruded at the volcano's summit.
