The shores are often foul, but the midway is mostly clear, and, where sunken rocks are, they are shown by whirlpools. The flow of the tide, or rather the damming up of the lower waters between Porto da Lenha and the mouth, causes a daily rise, which we found to measure about a foot; thus it assists in forming a treble current, the rapid <b>down-flow</b> in the Thalweg being subtended by a strong backwater on either side carrying a considerable portion in a retrograde direction, and showing a sensible reflux; this will continue {{as far as the}} rapids. In the Amazonas the tides are felt a hundred leagues from the mouth; and, whilst the stream moves seawards, the level of the water rises, proving an evident under-current.

40|$|We present here flow fields –including {{three-dimensional}} velocity {{fields and}} interface deformations – associated with optimal disturbances in a two-phase shear flow. Optimal disturbances (OD) are {{a consequence of}} the transient growth dynamics fostered by the non-self-adjoint nature of the linear operator, in this case a generalization of coupled Orr-Sommerfeld and Squire operators. The base state consists of an initially flat interface with tension, across which the density, viscosity and mean velocity all change. In the immediate vicinity of the interface, boundary layer flow profiles match the tangential stress and velocity. In this work we focus on parameters characteristic of atomization in cryogenic rocket engine injectors, namely Re = 1000, We = 150 (based on liquid boundary layer thickness), density ratio r = 0. 02 and viscosity ratio m = 0. 025. The OD of this two-phase flow show some similarity to OD in ordinary boundary layers; among the important differences is the effect of transient growth on the shape of the interface.

(The column could be easily modified to produce high-purity liquid nitrogen.) Whereas typical industrial distillation columns for producing high-purity liquid oxygen and/or nitrogen are hundreds of feet tall, this distillation column is less than 3 ft (less than about 0. 9 m) tall. This column was developed to trickle-charge a LOX-based emergency oxygen system (EOS) for a large commercial aircraft. A description of the industrial production of liquid oxygen and liquid nitrogen by distillation is prerequisite to a meaningful description of the present miniaturized distillation column. Typically, such industrial production takes place in a chemical processing plant in which large quantities of high-pressure air are expanded in a turboexpander to (1) recover a portion of the electrical power required to compress the air and (2) partially liquefy the air. The resulting two-phase flow of air is sent to the middle of a distillation column. The liquid phase is oxygen-rich, and its oxygen purity increases as it flows down the column. The vapor phase is nitrogen-rich and its nitrogen purity increases as it flows up the column. A heater or heat exchanger, commonly denoted a reboiler, is {{at the bottom of the}} column. The reboiler is so named because its role is to reboil some of the liquid oxygen collected at the bottom of the column to provide a flow of oxygen-rich vapor. As the oxygen-rich vapor flows up the column, it absorbs the nitrogen in the <b>down-flowing</b> liquid by mass transfer. Once the vapor leaves the lower portion of the column, it interacts with <b>down-flowing</b> nitrogen liquid that has been condensed in a heat exchanger, commonly denoted a condenser, at the top of the column. Liquid oxygen and liquid nitrogen products are obtained by draining some of the purified product at the bottom and top of the column, respectively. Because distillation is a mass-transfer process, the purity of the product(s) can be increased by increasing the effectiveness of the mass-transfer process (increasing the mass-transfer coefficient) and/or by increasing the available surface area for mass transfer through increased column height. The diameter of a distillation column is fixed by pressure-drop and mass-flow requirements. The approach taken in designing the present distillation column to be short yet capable of yielding a product of acceptably high purity was to pay careful attention to design details that affect mass-transfer processes...|$|R
