5|$|The Muisca played music, {{sang and}} danced mainly {{as part of}} religious, burial and <b>initiation</b> <b>rituals,</b> with harvests and sowing and after the victory in battles. Also during the {{construction}} of their houses, the Muisca performed music and dances. The early Spanish chronicles noted that the music and singing was monotonous and sad. As musical instruments they used drums, flutes made of shells or ceramics, trumpets of gold, zampoñas and ocarinas. At the rituals, the people would be dressed in feathers, animal skins (mainly jaguar) and decorated their bodies with paint. At the dances the women and men held hands and both the commoners and the higher social classes participated in these activities. The main deities associated with the dances were Huitaca and Nencatacoa.|$|E

25|$|Furthermore, Eliade {{argues that}} Westerners {{can learn from}} non-Western {{cultures}} to see something besides absurdity in suffering and death.

2500|$|Eliade {{says that}} secular man cannot escape his bondage to {{religious}} thought. By its very nature, secularism depends on religion for {{its sense of}} identity: by resisting sacred models, by insisting that man make history on his own, secular man identifies himself only through opposition to religious thought: [...] "He [...] recognizes himself in proportion as he 'frees' and 'purifies' himself from the 'superstitions' of his ancestors." [...] Furthermore, modern man [...] "still retains a large stock of camouflaged myths and degenerated rituals". For example, modern social events still have similarities to traditional <b>initiation</b> <b>rituals,</b> and modern novels feature mythical motifs and themes. Finally, secular man still participates in something like the eternal return: by reading modern literature, [...] "modern man succeeds in obtaining an 'escape from time' comparable to the 'emergence from time' effected by myths".|$|E

40|$|Thesis (MPhil (Sociology and Social Anthropology)) [...] University of Stellenbosch, 2009. The {{purpose of}} this thesis is to attempt to {{understand}} the concept of manhood in the context of Xhosa-speaking people; and to investigate why it is significant for them to use traditional circumcision in the male <b>initiation</b> <b>ritual.</b> In the context of the research problem, the aim is to understand: i) why traditional circumcision is important in executing this ritual, ii) people’s beliefs about the concept of manhood, iii) how the <b>initiation</b> <b>ritual</b> is practised in the present day, iv) the controversy and debate around the <b>initiation</b> <b>ritual</b> in the Eastern Cape, and v) the role of the government’s policies in regulating this rite. In terms of research design and methodology, I used qualitative research. The sampling method includes non-probability sampling – that is purposive or judgmental sampling. In the research process I utilized individual interviews, focus group interviews, participant observation, and any literature that was relevant to this study. The field research was conducted in Mchubakazi Township in Butterworth, Eastern Cape. As regards the research findings, the following data came out: firstly, manhood refers to belonging to a group of men who live in a certain village. These men are characterised by having undergone the <b>initiation</b> <b>ritual,</b> especially using traditional circumcision. A man who has undergone hospital circumcision is more likely to experience humiliation and disrespect from the orthodox Xhosa-speakers. Their argument in support of this statement is that he is only half a man. Secondly, traditional circumcision is perceived as being significant in this ritual; it is a necessary adventure a male must go through in order to become a man. It is basically an act of courage. It is not necessarily compulsory in the process of transforming a boy into a man, but it is important for his image {{in the eyes of the}} community. Thirdly, the <b>initiation</b> <b>ritual</b> of Xhosa-speakers consists of four phases, namely: the ‘entering phase’ (umgeno), the phase of being an initiate (ubukhwetha), the ‘coming out phase’ (umphumo) and the phase of being a graduate (ubukrwala) ...|$|R
