50|$|The {{information}} and supporting evidence needed for <b>security</b> <b>accreditation</b> is developed during a detailed security review of an information system, typically {{referred to as}} security certification. Security certification is a comprehensive assessment of the management, operational, and technical security controls in an information system, made in support of <b>security</b> <b>accreditation,</b> {{to determine the extent}} to which the controls are implemented correctly, operating as intended, and producing the desired outcome with respect to meeting the security requirements for the system. The results of a security certification are used to reassess the risks and update the system security plan, thus providing the factual basis for an authorizing official to render a <b>security</b> <b>accreditation</b> decision.|$|R

5000|$|Once {{the system}} {{documentation}} and risk assessment has been completed, the system's controls must be reviewed and certified to be functioning appropriately. Based {{on the results}} of the review, the information system is accredited. The certification and accreditation process is defined in NIST SP 800-37 [...] "Guide for the <b>Security</b> Certification and <b>Accreditation</b> of Federal Information Systems".Security accreditation is the official management decision given by a senior agency official to authorize operation of an information system and to explicitly accept the risk to agency operations, agency assets, or individuals based on the implementation of an agreed-upon set of security controls. Required by OMB Circular A-130, Appendix III, <b>security</b> <b>accreditation</b> provides a form of quality control and challenges managers and technical staffs at all levels to implement the most effective security controls possible in an information system, given mission requirements, technical constraints, operational constraints, and cost/schedule constraints. By accrediting an information system, an agency official accepts responsibility for the security of the system and is fully accountable for any adverse impacts to the agency if a breach of security occurs. Thus, responsibility and accountability are core principles that characterize <b>security</b> <b>accreditation.</b> It is essential that agency officials have the most complete, accurate, and trustworthy information possible on the security status of their information systems in order to make timely, credible, risk-based decisions on whether to authorize operation of those systems.|$|R

Concretely, from any first level private key, the adversary can easily derive a proper “private key ” which can decrypt any ciphertexts for the target identity. That is to say, one key generation query on any first level identity excluding the target’s first level identity, is enough to break their schemes 1...|$|R
