40|$|In the {{extrusion}} {{blow molding}} process the shape and thickness distribution of the <b>finished</b> <b>container</b> depend on {{the dimensions of the}} parison at the time of inflation. In particular, the processes of swell and sag act to cause a variation of parison dimensions between the time the melt emerges from the die and the moment of inflation. In the present study the effects of die geometry, extrusion velocity and the rheological properties of the resin on parison behavior were studied. Four annular dies (a straight, a diverging and two converging dies) and three high density polyethylene resins were used. To study the individual contributions of swell and sag to the overall parison behavior, two types of experiments were carried out. First, swell was studied in the absence of sag by extruding the parison into an isothermal oil bath. Both diameter and thickness swells were measured as functions of time. Then combined effect of swell and sag was studied by extruding the parison into an isothermal air oven. A simple lumped parameter model was developed to predict the length of the parison using the swell data, storage modulus and process variables...|$|E

50|$|Day 8 {{begins with}} Merv <b>finishing</b> the <b>container,</b> Tom on the railing, John and Paul {{on the door}} opener, Gordie to find sinks for a sink wall, Katrina on {{furniture}} projects, and Andy on more design work. While on the road looking for metal sinks and finding only cheap plastic ones, Gordie gets a hit on the junk hotline, where he manages to get 20000 smoke-damaged wine corks. The lack of anything of immediate use adds to Geoff's troubles, already at a high due to Paul {{spending too much time}} on the door opener. Geoff issues an ultimatum on the door: finish it or demolish it in two hours. After Gordie invites Geoff on a trip raiding the Canadian National Exhibition (Day 8 being Labour Day, {{the last day of the}} Exhibition) for possible crib wall supplies, Geoff leaves Andy in charge of the door opener's fate. However, Martin arrives unannounced just after Geoff leaves, leaving Andy to receive Martin's crib wall redesign. Martin also signs off on Andy's window layout, opening the way for Merv to install the window. Andy also approves of Paul's and John's work after one door is finished in the door opener.|$|R
40|$|Pesticide use {{in modern}} day {{agriculture}} has increased tremendously. Pesticides {{are used to}} control pests and weeds, as well as protect crops from postharvest losses; however, their effects on humans and the environment cannot be overstated. This study examined pesticide acquisition, handling, and use among 120 farmers within the catchment of a small urban irrigation scheme. Also, in-depth interviews and focus group discussions were conducted among selected farmers through which further data was collected to augment that of the survey. Twelve types of pesticides, including herbicides, insecticides, and fungicides, were found in use in the study areas. Three main sources of information about pesticides were identified, 43. 3 % from extension officers, 39. 2 % from agrochemical dealers, and 10 % from colleague farmers. Seventy-five percent (75 %) of the respondents purchased the pesticides from agrochemical shops. Out of 74 farmers who were observed spraying pesticides on their farms, only 25. 7 % wore dresses that covered their whole body but without goggles.

The increasing tendency to use prefabricated materials increases the volume of packaging necessary in product transport; in addition, the traditional materials also arrive more protected with packaging. A specific management for this kind of waste is analyzed on this article. The main problem packaging implies in a construction work is the volume it occupies; {{in the case of the}} plastic, the construction of a block of 100 houses generates more than 1, 700 m 3 of plastic waste, basically film to wrap the pallets, and a weight of 35 kg. This means that if traditional containers are used, these will transport a great amount of air. Recommendations for the management of the waste coming from plastics packaging includes the segregation at origin, trying to maintain the product packed until the last moment and immediately storing the packaging material once it has been opened. When there is space enough at the work site, containers of greater dimensions than the traditional ones can be used. These containers will be only for discarded plastic materials, and at the same time, compactors can be used to reduce the volume of plastics.

40|$|There is a {{requirement}} (within the food packaging industry) for a greater analytical knowledge and more scientific understanding of the ROPP capping process and of the interaction of caps (closures) with the threaded part of the glass <b>container</b> (<b>finish).</b> Threads used within the industry have largely developed empirically from metal thread profiles. An improved understanding is needed so that problems associated with that process can be better understood and solved. Such problems can be manifest in damaged closures, ‘spinners’ and closures that are just too difficult to open. The term ‘spinners’ is used for closures that do not break the pilfer band (a tamper evident safety feature) when twisted. The same term {{is also used to}} describe closures that have been turned the wrong way (i. e. clockwise) on opening, stripping the thread whilst not breaking the pilfer band. To combat this problem it is desirable to produce a closure system that has a high torque when twisted in the wrong direction (known as the over torque) whilst maintaining good seal integrity and a low torque for correct opening procedure. A successful feasibility study was carried out to investigate the appropriateness of using finite element techniques to investigate closure systems and gain the required understanding to improve these systems. The follow on project utilised these finite element techniques and experimental testing using a single-head capping machine. The Project focuses on the industry standard glass thread finish called the GF 305 that utilises an extra deep, aluminium ROPP closure. The results of this work so far are presented here...|$|R
