5|$|The {{power station}} {{also has a}} <b>jetty</b> (see § <b>Jetty)</b> – imports via the <b>jetty</b> ended c.1980 – in 2004 the <b>jetty</b> was trialled for the import of Tall Oil by barge.|$|E
5|$|A new wooden {{northern}} <b>jetty</b> {{was added}} in 1872 which allowed {{the removal of}} the original western landing place. Another <b>jetty</b> was built on the south west corner in 1898 which reached deep water even at low tide, thus allowing steamers to use the pier at all states of the tide. This was damaged in a gale in 1903, and although it was rebuilt in 1909, it closed in 1916 and was dismantled in 1923. The northern <b>jetty</b> had also been damaged in the 1903 storm but was replaced by the present steel structure in 1905.|$|E
5|$|No {{escape from}} the <b>jetty</b> or the vessel was {{possible}} {{in the absence of}} rescue boats, given that no fixed link was built from the <b>jetty</b> to the shore. However, all concerned praised the initiative and courage of the firefighters and rescue workers.|$|E

5|$|The {{city also}} has water {{transportation}} that ply the Terengganu River. The lifeline {{between the north}} and south parts of the city are the water taxis more popularly known as bot penambang. Bot penambang are engined, roofed wooden boats made to carry passengers from Seberang Takir <b>Jetty</b> and Pulau Duyong Kecil <b>Jetty</b> to Kuala Terengganu <b>Jetty.</b> It is the easiest and shortest way to get to the city. There are also ferry services to the resort island of Redang and other small islands, although these services are mainly carried out by modern express ferries. The ferries dock at Syahbandar <b>Jetty,</b> {{just in front of the}} General Post Office.|$|E
5|$|The fort {{was linked}} to a <b>jetty,</b> Coalhouse Wharf, on the {{riverside}} a short distance to the south. A standard gauge railway track led from the fort's interior to the <b>jetty</b> and was used to bring guns and supplies from the wharf. The heaviest guns were transported to and from Coalhouse Fort (and other Thames forts) aboard two specialised gun barges called Gog and Magog, built in 1886 and 1900 respectively and used until the 1960s. The remains of the <b>jetty</b> are still visible, as are sections of the track within the fort's entrance.|$|E
5|$|Maintaining the {{services}} of the Illawarra Steam Navigation Company did, at times, take some {{effort on the part}} of the residents. For example, in Ulladulla a wooden <b>jetty</b> was built in 1859 in order to retain {{the services}} of the company; they had informed the farmers that their ships would not call again at Ulladulla unless better mooring facilities were provided. (After seven years the <b>jetty</b> was replaced by a stone pier built by the government on the natural reef). Similarly the town of Tathra was created through the erection of a small <b>jetty,</b> built so that the local farmers could gain access to coastal shipping which previously had stopped 25km away at Merimbula.|$|E
50|$|In {{buildings}} with <b>jetties</b> on adjacent walls the dragon beam is a horizontal, diagonal beam projecting from a corner which supports the <b>jetties.</b> Sometimes the post below the dragon beam {{is called a}} dragon post.|$|R
40|$|Penang Island has a rich {{historical}} background {{being the first}} site to be colonised by the British in 1786. Consequently, the island also has many old settlements that are now marketed as heritage attractions. Clan <b>jetties</b> are unique and have attractive architecture, many being designated as heritage sites. They also double up as a new attraction to tourists. Development and political preeures pose the greatest dangers to their survival, as is poor environmental management, poverty and out-migration and expose to environmental hazards. THis paper identifies the potentials of clan <b>jetties</b> as heritage building and tourism attractions. It reports on surveys of clan <b>jetties</b> in Penang and highlights {{the extent to which}} tourists are aware of such <b>jetties</b> and make attempts to visit them. Finally, it provides suggestions as to how best to develop the clan <b>jetties</b> in a sustainable way...|$|R
50|$|The Government of Maharashtra has {{declared}} a policy {{for construction of}} multipurpose <b>jetties</b> on 19 August 2005 to promote transportation of cargoes through short-sea shipping (SSS — Coastal Route).These <b>Jetties</b> can also handle international cargo through lighter-age operations.|$|R
5|$|The {{power station}} {{also has a}} <b>jetty</b> on the River Ouse, with a loading {{capacity}} of 200 tonnes- historically the <b>jetty</b> was built and used {{for the construction of}} the power station in the 1960s/70s – such as the delivery of equipment. In 2015 a planning application was submitted for the improvement of the jetty's load capacity to 500 tonnes by White Rose CCS developer Capture Power Limited (Drax/Alstom/BOC joint venture), for the construction of the CCS project.|$|E
5|$|An {{application}} to Parliament for a <b>jetty</b> {{in the following}} year was unsuccessful, but in 1860 the Upsall, Normanby & Ormesby Railway received permission for a line with access to the river, the S claim of exclusive rights to the foreshore having been rejected. The <b>jetty</b> was also opposed by the Tees Conservancy Commissioners and they moored barges along the foreshore to obstruct construction. In {{what became known as the}} Battle of the Tees, a fight broke out when a steam tug sent by the Commissioners interrupted men moving the barges. The barges were successfully moved, but a more serious fight developed the following night when three of the Commissioners' steam tugs arrived. The police then kept watch on the works until they were finished.|$|E
5|$|In the 1960s, the Merrie England bar and an {{amusement}} arcade were constructed {{at the end}} of the pier nearest to the shore. The 1939 theatre, which is still in use, narrowly escaped damage in 1985 when the early stages of a fire were noticed by performer Vince Hill. In the 1980s, a Victorian-styled entrance was built. In 1991 the pier gained the Carousel bar as an additional attraction, and a small tramway to ease access to the pier-head. By this point, the pier had ceased to have any nautical use, but the <b>jetty</b> section was adapted for use as a helicopter pad in the late 1980s. The Christmas Eve storm of 1997 destroyed the landing <b>jetty,</b> including the helipad.|$|E

5|$|Spiral Jetty: The {{northwest}} {{arm of the}} lake, near Rozel Point, is {{the location}} for Robert Smithson's work of land art, Spiral <b>Jetty</b> (1970), which is only visible when the level of Great Salt Lake drops below 4,197.8 feet (1,280.2 m) above sea level.|$|E
5|$|Around 1:00am (evidence on {{the precise}} time conflicts) on Monday, 8 January, a {{rumbling}} or cracking noise was {{heard from the}} vessel, followed shortly by a huge explosion within its hull. The force of the explosion was seen to blow men from the <b>jetty</b> into the sea. Local residents reported seeing Betelgeuse engulfed in a ball of fire a few moments later. A series of further explosions followed, breaking the vessel in half. Much of the oil cargo still on board ignited and this generated temperatures estimated to exceed 1,000°C. The concrete unloading <b>jetty</b> crumbled and firefighters, arriving on the scene from several neighbouring towns, were unable to get near the vessel. The firefighters concentrated their efforts on preventing the fire from spreading to the tanks of the storage farm and on containing the oil spillage. Local families living on the island fled for their lives.|$|E
5|$|Burnham-on-Sea {{railway station}} was the {{terminus}} of the Burnham {{branch of the}} Somerset and Dorset Joint Railway, but the tracks continued onto the <b>jetty,</b> where ferry services to South Wales could be boarded. The station opened in 1858 as Burnham, and was renamed Burnham-on-Sea in 1920. It closed to scheduled passenger traffic in 1951 and stopped being used for excursions in 1962. It finally closed to goods traffic in 1963.|$|E

40|$|The Patos Lagoon estuary {{has one of}} {{the most}} {{important}} harbor complexes in Brazil. The increasing navigational activities observed in the last decade enhanced the dredging demand in the access channel of the lagoon. Developments have been proposed for the area, which include an extension of the <b>jetties</b> at the entrance of the estuary, as well as deepening the existing access channel. The objective of this study is to investigate the effect of the proposed developments on the circulation pattern of the estuary. Three scenarios are the focus of this study: a) original channel geometry and <b>jetties</b> length; b) original channel depth and extension of the jetties; c) modification of the channel depth and extension of the <b>jetties.</b> The TELEMAC flow model, based on the finite elements method, was used to carry out two-dimensional depthaveraged simulations to investigate the effect of such alterations on the hydrodynamics of the area. Results showed that the extension of the <b>jetties</b> would reduce flood and enhance ebb fluxes in the estuary. The scenario with the extension of the <b>jetties</b> without dredging, however, would lead to stronger velocities at the access channel causing stronger shear stresses over the bottom and potentially reducing the demand for dredging. The scenario considering the extention of the <b>jetties</b> with dredging would lead to weaker velocities, which could promote the siltation of the access channel. Moreover, the extension of the <b>jetties</b> seems to reduce salt-water intrusion, which could affect the entrance of commercial fish and shrimp species, harming the local fishery production...|$|R

KPA also controls Biawak Oil <b>Jetty</b> that handles petroleum products.|$|E
5|$|Linda passed {{very near}} Socorro Island. In addition, early {{forecasts}} predicted that Linda would make landfall in California. The landfall never materialized and warnings or watches were {{not necessary for}} any location. However, Linda caused large surf, which crashed ashore in California, where it swept five people off a <b>jetty.</b> Moisture related to Linda also contributed to a landslide in southern California that destroyed or damaged 79houses.|$|E
