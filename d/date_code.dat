2500|$|American Motors did {{not provide}} {{identification}} on the engine block, known as VIN stamping, as some other car manufacturers had been doing at that time. Other than the actual displacement, {{there was no way}} to associate a vehicle with the original [...] "born with" [...] engine. Since this was common practice at the GM and Chrysler plants it is much easier to verify that the exact engine in the car is actually the factory original unit. Each AMC vehicle was inspected to confirm that the engine displacement (identified by numbers cast on the block under the engine mounts) corresponded to its corresponding engine code in the vehicle identification number (VIN). A tag screwed to the valve cover provides an engine's build date, and that <b>date</b> <b>code</b> always preceded a specific car's production sequence. However, there is no engine [...] "numbers matching" [...] test for AMXs or any other AMC automobiles.|$|E

In the late 1980s most plants switched to a 4-digit code with a 2-digit year followed by a 2-digit month (e.g. 8909) or a 2-digit week (e.g. 9051). Overall, the <b>date</b> <b>code</b> format was not strictly enforced. At least the 1821 series of integrated circuits bore an IEC 60062 letter and digit code (e.g. A1 for January 1990).|$|E

40|$|Bottle Co. was unique. An {{outgrowth}} of the Ohio Bottle Co., {{it was the first}} of the large conglomerates, setting a tone that would be followed two decades later by giants like the Knox Glass Bottle Co. and the Owens-Illinois Glass Co. American Bottle set the standard for small-mouth bottle production in the beer and soda bottle field and forced competitors to invent or adopt semiautomatic machines (and eventually gob feeders to make them fully automatic) to try to keep up. The company pioneered the use of <b>date</b> <b>codes</b> to establish the year a bottle was produced, but their markings were so cryptic that many of them have been misidentified, misunderstood, or ignored by researchers for decades. Ironically, most of the marked bottles associated with American Bottle are the result of hand – not machine – production, and the company refrained from using <b>date</b> <b>codes</b> on machine-made bottles until 1916. The American Bottle Co. initiated the placement of <b>date</b> <b>codes</b> on the heels of bottles, a device for tracking the number of round trips that a soda or beer bottle makes. Because these bottles were intended to be returnable, the number of trips between the bottling plant and the consumer affects the profit margin. As financial planning became more important to the beverage industry, attention to the number of round trips became more important. By the mid- 1920 s, most returnable bottle manufacturers used date codes; by the 1950 s, it was a standard throughout the industry. American Bottle initiated the practice in 1906...|$|R
