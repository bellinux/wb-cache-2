5|$|Unlike the Netherlands or Luxembourg, whose monarchies {{went into}} exile {{alongside}} the government, King Leopold III {{surrendered to the}} Germans alongside his army – contrary to {{the advice of his}} government. In the days before his surrender, he allegedly attempted to form a new government under the pro-Nazi socialist Henri <b>De</b> <b>Man</b> though this was never realized. He remained a prisoner of the Germans, under house arrest, {{for the rest of the}} war. Although the government briefly attempted to negotiate with the German authorities from exile in France, the German authorities passed a decree forbidding members of the Belgian government returning to the country and the talks were abandoned.|$|E
5|$|As the Belgian forces, {{together}} with their French and British allies, were forced to retreat, Leopold decided that surrendering the army was the only viable course of action. On 24 May, as the government was leaving the country for exile in France, a group of ministers including Pierlot held a final meeting with Leopold at the Kasteel van Wijnendale. They called for him to {{follow the example of}} the Norwegian king, Haakon VII, and join them in exile as a symbol of continued resistance. Leopold refused, believing that as commander, he should surrender alongside his army, provoking real animosity. He also believed that, by leaving for France, the Belgian government would surrender its neutrality and become a puppet government. He also believed that, as a neutral power with no formal treaty of alliance with France or Britain, the Belgian army was not obliged to hold out as long as it possibly could if it incurred huge casualties and had no change of defending its own territory. On 28 May, after a brief attempt to form a new government of sympathetic politicians under Henri <b>De</b> <b>Man</b> and after denouncing Pierlot and his government, Leopold surrendered to the Germans and was made a prisoner of war.|$|E

25|$|Since theorists of {{literature}} often draw {{on a very}} heterogeneous tradition of Continental philosophy and the philosophy of language, any classification of their approaches is only an approximation. There are many types of literary theory, which take different approaches to texts.

500|$|The game's soundtrack was {{composed}} by Joris <b>de</b> <b>Man,</b> The Flight, and Niels van der Leest, with vocalist Julie Elven {{serving as the}} primary performer. Lucas van Tol, music supervisor and senior sound designer, provided the composers with a game design document, insisting on an intimate sound for the score. For the tribal theme, they experimented with bows on piano wire and resonator guitars (with layered tracks of harmonicas {{on top of the}} latter) and playing cellos with plectrums or the back of a bow to convey how contemporary instruments would be played by someone to whom the instruments were unknown; <b>de</b> <b>Man</b> also used a contrabass flute and made synth pads from blowing on a Thai bamboo flute, noting [...] "distant pads and ambiences, and wide, spread out chords seemed to work well". Circuit-bent synthesizers and percussive loops, run through impulse responses of metal and iron being beaten, were devoted to making a thematic identifier for the machines based on technology and metal. Van Tol required that the music be supplied in stems so that different pieces could be combined. The positive response to the first E3 trailer's main theme led it {{to be included in the}} main menu. The composers also did the motion capture for diegetic music vignettes, portraying in-game tribal musicians. The game's soundtrack, featuring 80 tracks that span over four hours, was released digitally via Spotify in March 2017.|$|E
500|$|The Man in the Moone {{became a}} popular source for [...] "often extravagantly staged comic drama and opera", {{including}} Aphra Behn's The Emperor of the Moon, a 1687 play [...] "inspired by... the third edition of , and the English translation of Cyrano's work", and Elkanah Settles The World in the Moon (1697). Thomas D'Urfeys Wonders in the Sun, or the Kingdom of the Birds (1706) was [...] "really a sequel, starring Domingo and Diego". Its popularity {{was not limited}} to English; a Dutch farce, Don Domingo Gonzales of <b>de</b> <b>Man</b> in de maan, formerly considered to have been written by Maria de Wilde, was published in 1755.|$|E
500|$|Development {{began in}} 2011 after the studio {{completed}} {{the development of}} Killzone 3, with game director Mathijs de Jonge considering it [...] "the most risky" [...] idea of those that were pitched at the time.

The game engine, Decima, was previously engineered for Killzone Shadow Fall and altered for Horizon Zero Dawn. The game is the first new intellectual property (IP) developed by Guerrilla Games since Killzone in 2004, and also the studio's first attempt at developing a role-playing video game. The music was composed by Joris <b>de</b> <b>Man,</b> The Flight, and Niels van der Leest.|$|E

500|$|With France's {{defeat and}} the {{installation}} of the pro-German Vichy regime, it was widely believed that Germany was about to win the war. Leopold was hailed as a [...] "martyr" [...] or a symbol of national resilience, in contrast to a Government that appeared to place its ideology above the interests of the Belgian people. On 31 May 1940, the senior representative of the Catholic Church in Belgium, Cardinal Jozef-Ernest van Roey, circulated a pastoral letter calling for all Belgians to unite around the King. Other figures in the King's entourage, particularly the authoritarian socialist Henri <b>De</b> <b>Man,</b> believed that democracy had failed and {{that the end of the}} war would see the King as the ruler of an authoritarian Belgian state.|$|E
500|$|Syzygy tablebases were {{developed}} by Ronald <b>de</b> <b>Man,</b> released in April 2013, in a form optimized for use by a chess program during search. [...] This variety consists of two tables per endgame: a smaller WDL table (win-draw-loss) which contains knowledge of the 50-move rule, and a larger DTZ table (distance to zero ply, i.e. pawn move or capture). [...] The WDL tables were designed to be {{small enough to fit}} on a solid-state drive for quick access during search, whereas the DTZ form is for use at the root position to choose the game-theoretically quickest win instead of performing a search. Syzygy tablebases are available for all 6 piece endings, and are now supported by many top engines, including Komodo, Deep Fritz, Houdini, and Stockfish.|$|E
500|$|Although Rǫgnvaldr {{was likely}} the sea-king who {{assisted}} the Scots against Haraldr, {{there is evidence}} suggesting {{that it may have}} been Ragnall instead. For example, the saga makes the erroneous statement that Rǫgnvaldr was descended from Ingibjǫrg Pálsdóttir, a woman who was much {{more likely to have been}} Ragnall's grandmother than Rǫgnvaldr's. The saga also notes that Rǫgnvaldr's military force was partly gathered from Kintyre, which may be more likely of Ragnall than Rǫgnvaldr, since Ragnall is known to have specifically styled himself dominus Ergile et Kyntyre. Also, transcriptions and translations of Howden's account of the episode have generally stated that [...] "Reginaldus" [...] was a son of Somairle. A recent reanalysis of the main extant version of Howden's chronicle has shown, however, that this particular part of the text originally read in Latin Reginaldus filius rex <b>de</b> <b>Man,</b> and was later altered to include Somairle's name above the last three words. Since the source of the original manuscript probably read in Latin Reginaldus filius Godredi, the sea-king in question appears to have been Rǫgnvaldr rather than Ragnall.|$|E
