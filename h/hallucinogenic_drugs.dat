5|$|Psychedelic rock is {{a diverse}} style of rock music inspired, influenced, or {{representative}} of psychedelic culture, which is centred around perception-changing <b>hallucinogenic</b> <b>drugs.</b> Psychedelic rock {{is intended to}} replicate and enhance the mind-altering experiences of psychedelic drugs, most notably LSD. Many psychedelic groups differ in style, and the label is often used indiscriminately.|$|E
5|$|Auditory {{hallucinations}} {{are typical}} of psychoses: third-person hallucinations (i.e. voices talking about the patient) and hearing one's thoughts spoken aloud (gedankenlautwerden or écho de la pensée) are among the Schneiderian first rank symptoms indicative of schizophrenia, whereas second-person hallucinations (voices talking to the patient) threatening or insulting or telling them to commit suicide, may be a feature of psychotic depression or schizophrenia. Visual hallucinations are generally suggestive of organic conditions such as epilepsy, drug intoxication or drug withdrawal. Many of the visual effects of <b>hallucinogenic</b> <b>drugs</b> are more correctly described as visual illusions or visual pseudohallucinations, as they are distortions of sensory experiences, and are not experienced as existing in objective reality. Auditory pseudohallucinations are suggestive of dissociative disorders. Déjà vu, derealization and depersonalization are associated with temporal lobe epilepsy and dissociative disorders.|$|E

25|$|Not {{all people}} have the same {{internal}} perceptual ability. For many, when the eyes are closed, the perception of darkness prevails. However, some {{people are able to}} perceive colorful, dynamic imagery. The use of <b>hallucinogenic</b> <b>drugs</b> increases the subject's ability to consciously access visual (and auditory, and other sense) percepts. The Mental Imagery article goes into more detail.|$|E
25|$|One {{suggestion}} is that the motifs found in the rock art of the British Isles are depictions of phosphenes, entoptic phenomenon produced through the disturbance of the optic nerve that result from altered states of consciousness. Such altered states might have been induced {{by the use of}} <b>hallucinogenic</b> <b>drugs,</b> evidence for which exists from Neolithic and Bronze Age Europe.|$|E
25|$|Thompson {{often used}} {{a blend of}} fiction and fact when portraying himself in his writing as well, {{sometimes}} using the name Raoul Duke as an author surrogate whom he generally described as a callous, erratic, self-destructive journalist who constantly drank alcohol and took <b>hallucinogenic</b> <b>drugs.</b> Fantasizing about causing bodily harm to others was also a characteristic in his work used to comedic effect and an example of his brand of humor.|$|E

25|$|The 5-HT receptors, the receptors for serotonin, {{are located}} on the cell {{membrane}} of nerve cells and other cell types in animals, and mediate the effects of serotonin as the endogenous ligand and of {{a broad range of}} pharmaceutical and <b>hallucinogenic</b> <b>drugs.</b> Except for the 5-HT3 receptor, a ligand-gated ion channel, all other 5-HT receptors are G-protein-coupled receptors (also called seven-transmembrane, or heptahelical receptors) that activate an intracellular second messenger cascade.|$|E
25|$|The {{history of}} smoking {{dates back to}} as early as 5000 BCE in shamanistic rituals. Many ancient civilizations, such as the Babylonians, Indians and Chinese, burnt incense {{as a part of}} {{religious}} rituals, as did the Israelites and the later Catholic and Orthodox Christian churches. Smoking in the Americas probably had its origins in the incense-burning ceremonies of shamans but was later adopted for pleasure, or as a social tool. The smoking of tobacco, as well as various <b>hallucinogenic</b> <b>drugs,</b> was used to achieve trances and to come into contact with the spirit world.|$|E
25|$|Micropsia {{can result}} from the action of {{mescaline}} and other <b>hallucinogenic</b> <b>drugs.</b> Although drug-induced changes in perception usually subside as the chemical leaves the body, long-term cocaine use can result in the chronic residual effect of micropsia. Micropsia can be a symptom of Hallucinogen Persisting Perception Disorder, or HPPD, {{in which a person}} can experience hallucinogenic flashbacks long after ingesting a hallucinogen. A majority of these flashbacks are visual distortions which include micropsia, and 15-80% of hallucinogen users may experience these flashbacks. Micropsia can also be a rare side effect of zolpidem, a prescription medication used to temporarily treat insomnia.|$|E
50|$|Noribogaine, or 12-hydroxyibogamine, is the {{principal}} psychoactive metabolite of the <b>hallucinogenic</b> <b>drug</b> ibogaine. It {{is thought to be}} involved in the antiaddictive effects of ibogaine-containing plant extracts, such as Tabernanthe iboga.|$|R

25|$|There are few {{treatments}} for {{many types of}} hallucinations. However, for those hallucinations caused by mental disease, a psychologist or psychiatrist should be alerted, and treatment {{will be based on}} the observations of those doctors. Antipsychotic and atypical antipsychotic medication may also be utilized to treat the illness if the symptoms are severe and cause significant distress. For other causes of hallucinations there is no factual evidence to support any one treatment is scientifically tested and proven. However, abstaining from <b>hallucinogenic</b> <b>drugs,</b> stimulant drugs, managing stress levels, living healthily, and getting plenty of sleep can help reduce the prevalence of hallucinations. In all cases of hallucinations, medical attention should be sought out and informed of one's specific symptoms.|$|E

500|$|The term [...] "psychedelic" [...] {{was first}} coined in 1956 by {{psychiatrist}} Humphry Osmond {{as an alternative}} descriptor for <b>hallucinogenic</b> <b>drugs</b> {{in the context of}} psychedelic psychotherapy. As the countercultural scene developed in San Francisco, the terms acid rock and psychedelic rock were used in 1966 to describe the new drug-influenced music and were being widely used by 1967. The terms psychedelic rock and acid rock are often used interchangeably, but acid rock may be distinguished as a more extreme variation that was heavier, louder, relied on long jams, focused more directly on LSD, and made greater use of distortion.|$|E

500|$|Repeated use of {{psilocybin}} {{does not}} lead to physical dependence. A 2008 study concluded that, based on US data from the period 2000–2002, adolescent-onset (defined here as ages 11–17) usage of <b>hallucinogenic</b> <b>drugs</b> (including psilocybin) did not increase the risk of drug dependence in adulthood; this was in contrast to adolescent usage of cannabis, cocaine, inhalants, anxiolytic medicines, and stimulants, all of which were associated with [...] "an excess risk of developing clinical features associated with drug dependence". Likewise, a 2010 Dutch study ranked the relative harm of psilocybin mushrooms compared to a selection of 19 recreational drugs, including alcohol, cannabis, cocaine, ecstasy, heroin, and tobacco. Psilocybin mushrooms were ranked as the illicit drug with the lowest harm, corroborating conclusions reached earlier by expert groups in the United Kingdom.|$|E
