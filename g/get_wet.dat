5|$|Agent Carter {{was filmed}} over five days, with Gabriel Beristain serving as cinematographer. The budget {{did not allow}} for a {{storyboard}} artist to be hired, so D'Esposito, Winderbaum, and Beristain worked together to plan a shot list for the production using stand-in actors. The stunts were also pre-filmed to show the actors. D'Esposito explained that having the shots planned helped with planning the visual effects for the film. The mid-credits scene with Neal McDonough as Dum Dum Dugan was planned to show the character in a pool, but had to be changed on set to taking place beside the pool when {{it was found that}} the muscle suit McDonough wears to portray the character could not <b>get</b> <b>wet.</b>|$|E
5|$|The {{development}} programme {{moved to the}} University of Exeter in 1982, where the C1 chassis was fitted with fibreglass shells and tested in a wind tunnel. It was recognised {{at an early stage}} that the vehicle would have to be aerodynamic; although it was only ever intended to be small and relatively slow, reducing wind resistance was seen as essential for the vehicle's efficiency. By March 1982 the basic design of the C1 had been established. Sinclair then turned to an established motor design company, Ogle Design of Letchworth, to provide professional styling assistance and production engineering. However, Ogle's approach was not to Sinclair's liking; they tackled the project as one of car design and focused more (and expensively) on the aerodynamics rather than the cycle technology around which the C1 was based. The weight of the vehicle increased to over , far more than Sinclair's desired specification. By March 1983, Sinclair and Wood Rogers had decided to stop the C1 programme. Wood Rogers comments that Ogle were convinced that the C1 would be a flop, telling Sinclair {{that it would not be}} fast enough, that its drivers would <b>get</b> <b>wet</b> when it rained and that the battery was not good enough.|$|E

25|$|In this game, Tim Tebow {{also created}} an iconic image {{of himself and}} the Gators for 2008. Because of the rainy {{conditions}} in Tallahassee that day, the field was extremely wet and slippery, affecting play on both sides. On a 4-yard TD run into the endzone, Tebow slid in on the wet turf, causing {{the front of his}} white Away jersey to <b>get</b> <b>wet</b> red paint on it. The paint also got on his face and helmet and stayed on {{for the majority of the}} game. The red paint resembled blood to many people which provided Tebow with a bravado of bravery and passion, which also highlighted his intense sideline celebrations and enthusiasm. The image of Tebow's paint-stained Jersey became one of the lasting and memorable images in sports for 2008 and for the decade at large.|$|E

Sigler described the plot: [...] "With my character, she's basically going against her parent's wishes to be with this gentleman. She's pregnant with a baby, which is Mariah, and they run away together. So it's kind of an epic love story, it's nice."

500|$|Her first {{starring}} film {{role was}} in the 2007 horror–thriller P2, in which she played a businesswoman who becomes trapped inside a public parking garage with a deranged security guard. About the dress her character wears {{for much of the}} film, Nichols said, [...] "When I read the script originally, it wasn't a dress, it was a small nightgown with no bra or underwear. Then I read the first scene where she gets wet, and I went: 'OK, {{this has got to be}} altered! Nichols said in an interview that among the rules established in her contract were: [...] "I will not <b>get</b> <b>wet</b> and show nipples" [...] in addition to no nudity. A bra was sewn into the [...] "Marilyn Monroe dress" [...] she wore in the film. She said, [...] "I wasn't going to run around for two months without a bra, I thought that was inappropriate. But in place of the nipples there's clearly a lot of cleavage. So we made a compromise." [...] P2 was generally disliked by critics. Reviewer James Berardinelli said that her performance was [...] "admirable, although one wonders whether she was cast more for her physical assets than her acting ability." [...] John Anderson of Variety wrote that [...] "Nichols is in territory well trod over the years by everyone from Fay Wray and Grace Kelly to Heather Langenkamp, the terrified but gutsy heroine, who in this case has been chloroformed and put into a sheer white evening dress by her abductor—who must have anticipated that his captive would try to escape in an elevator, which he could then fill with water. (Nichols' considerable physical attributes, henceforth, seem to occupy most of the screen.) She's sympathetic, hysterical when required and likeable." ...|$|E
500|$|The {{video screens}} showed both live shoots and special footage {{directed}} by Robson. Cohen worked by Danny O'Brien at BCC Video to create double-sided custom video LED cubes that hanged above stage right. There were three larger-sized video screens above the stage area. The gyrating wheel in which Spears opened {{the show was}} made by Branam Enterprises and was attached to a platform also created by Tait Towers. 171 white light [...] were provided by Spectra. The giant music box from which Spears emerged in [...] "Born to Make You Happy" [...] (1999) was designed by Michael Cotton. Confetti was shot from machines provided by Pyrotek. Pyrotechnics were done by Gerb Fountains, whereas artificial snow was provided by Little Blizzard. During the encore performance of [...] "...Baby One More Time" [...] (1998), there was a water screen {{in which it was}} poured nearly two tons of water pumped at 360 gallons a minute. Cohen said, [...] "The water screen is the keystone of the entire design because it impacts every system—electrics, staging, dancing. Rob discovered the company (Chameleon Productions of Orlando, Florida) that makes the screen, and I immediately looked at what they had in stock, which was a straight line. And I knew we didn't want a straight line. We wanted a circular water screen so we could physically build a shower for her to stand in the middle of and not <b>get</b> <b>wet</b> and then walk through when she wanted to. Of course, everyone thought I was crazy, so I suggested a six-sided shape. Everyone was concerned that the gaps between the sections might cause gaps in the actual sheets of water. But I kept saying that if you put them 40' to 50' up in the air, gravity will cause the water to attach to itself, so you end up getting a solid sheet." ...|$|E

2500|$|W.K.'s major-label debut studio album, I <b>Get</b> <b>Wet,</b> was {{released}} on November 13, 2001 on Island Records. Continuing the sound established by his previous Bulb Records EPs, I <b>Get</b> <b>Wet</b> is characterized by its metal and punk rock influences and lyrical content revolving around partying. The album is also well known for its cover art: a photograph by Roe Ethridge of Andrew W.K. with a stream of blood running from his nose onto his chin and neck, which generated minor controversy in Europe after it was seen to represent cocaine abuse. To achieve the effect, W.K. initially said that he struck himself {{in the face with}} a brick during the photo shoot, but later explained that it did not lead to enough blood flow. Consequently, he supplemented his own blood with some of an animal which he got from a butcher's shop. I <b>Get</b> <b>Wet</b> earned positive press from publications such as NME and Kerrang! and featured two UK hit singles, [...] "Party Hard" [...] and [...] "She Is Beautiful", also rising to the top spot on Billboards Top Heatseekers albums chart. At the same time, W.K. also developed a reputation for his highly energetic live shows.|$|E

2500|$|The {{band was}} spotted by film-makers Cameron Allen and Martin Fabinyi, who founded their own {{independent}} record label, Regular Records, in September 1978 to record and release the group's music. Fabinyi's brother Jeremy Fabinyi became Mental As Anything's manager. Their debut release was a three-track EP, Mental As Anything Plays at Your Party, in December. It featured all original tracks, and is their only release on which Plaza and Mombassa were credited by their original names, Martin Murphy and Chris O'Doherty, respectively. Sydney radio station Double Jay (now Triple J), gave airplay to its most popular track, [...] "The Nips Are Getting Bigger", a drinking song written by Plaza, which showed a stylistic debt to British new wave. Soon after the EP's release, the Australian arm of Festival Records took over distribution of Regular Records and released a remix of [...] "The Nips Are Getting Bigger" [...] {{as a single}} in July 1979. This was followed on 1 November by the band's debut album, <b>Get</b> <b>Wet,</b> with Allen producing.
