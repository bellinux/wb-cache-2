5|$|Situated {{between the}} incus {{and the inner}} ear, the stapes transmits sound {{vibrations}} from the incus to the oval window, a membrane-covered opening to the inner ear. The stapes is also stabilized by the stapedius muscle, which is innervated by the <b>facial</b> <b>nerve.</b>|$|E
5|$|The {{cause of}} trigeminal neuralgia, {{in which one}} side of the face is exquisitely painful, is thought to be {{compression}} of the nerve by an artery as the nerve emerges from the brain stem. An acoustic neuroma, particularly at the junction between the pons and medulla, may compress the <b>facial</b> <b>nerve</b> (VII) and vestibulocochlear nerve (VIII), leading to hearing and sensory loss on the affected side.|$|E

5|$|The {{adverse effects}} of {{long-term}} linezolid therapy were first identified during postmarketing surveillance. Bone marrow suppression was not identified during Phase III trials, in which treatment did not exceed 21 days. Although some participants of early trials did experience thrombocytopenia, it {{was found to be}} reversible and did not occur significantly more frequently than in controls (participants not taking linezolid). There have also been postmarketing reports of seizures, and, , a single case each of Bell's palsy (paralysis of the <b>facial</b> <b>nerve)</b> and kidney toxicity.|$|E
5|$|Two sets {{of muscles}} are {{associated}} with the outer ear: the intrinsic and extrinsic muscles. In some mammals, these muscles can adjust the direction of the pinna. In humans, these muscles have little or no effect. The ear muscles are supplied by the <b>facial</b> <b>nerve,</b> which also supplies sensation to the skin of the ear itself, {{as well as to the}} external ear cavity. The great auricular nerve, auricular nerve, auriculotemporal nerve, and lesser and greater occipital nerves of the cervical plexus all supply sensation to parts of the outer ear and the surrounding skin.|$|E
5|$|Physical {{examination}} {{of the nervous system}} is typically normal apart from the presence of papilledema, which is seen on {{examination of}} the eye with a small device called an ophthalmoscope or in more detail with a fundus camera. If there are cranial nerve abnormalities, these may be noticed on eye examination {{in the form of a}} squint (third, fourth, or sixth nerve palsy) or as <b>facial</b> <b>nerve</b> palsy. If the papilledema has been longstanding, visual fields may be constricted and visual acuity may be decreased. Visual field testing by automated (Humphrey) perimetry is recommended as other methods of testing may be less accurate. Longstanding papilledema leads to optic atrophy, in which the disc looks pale and visual loss tends to be advanced.|$|E
50|$|In 2010, Culp had {{her final}} facial surgery {{performed}} and had regained {{much of her}} facial function, including the ability to smile, speak, and feel facial sensations due to the regrowth of <b>facial</b> <b>nerves.</b>|$|R

50|$|In addition, {{affected}} {{individuals may}} experience paralysis of various <b>facial</b> <b>nerves</b> and drooping {{of the upper}} eyelid (ptosis). Other signs include double vision, fever, chronic fatigue, vertigo or arthralgia. Occasionally the patient may present {{with a feeling of}} protrusion of one or both eyeballs (exophthalmos).|$|R
5|$|The {{increased}} pressure leads to compression and traction of the cranial nerves, {{a group of}} nerves that arise from the brain stem and supply the face and neck. Most commonly, the abducens nerve (sixth nerve) is involved. This nerve supplies the muscle that pulls the eye outward. Those with sixth nerve palsy therefore experience horizontal double vision which is worse when looking towards the affected side. More rarely, the oculomotor nerve and trochlear nerve (third and fourth nerve palsy, respectively) are affected; both {{play a role in}} eye movements. The <b>facial</b> <b>nerve</b> (seventh cranial nerve) is affected occasionally –- the result is total or partial weakness of the muscles of facial expression on one or both sides of the face.|$|E
5|$|Making {{up about}} 2 {{percent of cases}} of paralytic polio, bulbar polio occurs when {{poliovirus}} invades and destroys nerves within the bulbar region of the brain stem. The bulbar region is a white matter pathway that connects the cerebral cortex to the brain stem. The destruction of these nerves weakens the muscles supplied by the cranial nerves, producing symptoms of encephalitis, and causes difficulty breathing, speaking and swallowing. Critical nerves affected are the glossopharyngeal nerve (which partially controls swallowing and functions in the throat, tongue movement, and taste), the vagus nerve (which sends signals to the heart, intestines, and lungs), and the accessory nerve (which controls upper neck movement). Due to the effect on swallowing, secretions of mucus may build up in the airway, causing suffocation. Other signs and symptoms include facial weakness (caused by destruction of the trigeminal nerve and <b>facial</b> <b>nerve,</b> which innervate the cheeks, tear ducts, gums, and muscles of the face, among other structures), double vision, difficulty in chewing, and abnormal respiratory rate, depth, and rhythm (which may lead to respiratory arrest). Pulmonary edema and shock are also possible and may be fatal.|$|E

50|$|Heerfordt syndrome, also {{referred}} to as uveoparotid fever, Heerfordt-Mylius syndrome, Heerfordt-Waldenström syndrome, and Waldenström's uveoparotitis, is a rare manifestation of sarcoidosis. The symptoms include inflammation of the eye (uveitis), swelling of the parotid gland, chronic fever, and in some cases, palsy of the <b>facial</b> <b>nerves.</b>|$|R
50|$|Treatment is {{symptomatic}} and {{may include}} nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) and corticosteroids to reduce swelling, antibiotics and immunosuppressants. Surgery may be indicated to relieve {{pressure on the}} <b>facial</b> <b>nerves</b> and reduce swelling, but its efficacy is uncertain. Massage and electrical stimulation may also be prescribed.|$|R
40|$|Abstract. Current {{literature}} rejects nerve {{release in}} leprous facial neuropathy and states that lesions {{are restricted to}} the peripheral zygomatic branches. Since there are approximately 500, 000 patients with this disease throughout the world, we wanted to clarify the precise location of <b>facial</b> <b>nerve’s</b> affection and the benefit of neurolysis. Our study showed that in patients with leprosy, the <b>facial</b> <b>nerve’s</b> main trunk, the peripheral zygomatic branches, and all other branches were affected. Follow-up showed improvement in lagophthalmos and in misreinnervation, with no improvement in the control cohort. Nerve release improves muscle function in leprous facial neuropathy, provided surgery is performed on all affected segments. Intraoperative electroneurodiagnostics is an effective tool for detecting the most proximal site of lesion and ensuring effective surgery...|$|R

25|$|The <b>facial</b> <b>nerve</b> {{controls}} {{a number}} of functions, such as blinking and closing the eyes, smiling, frowning, lacrimation, salivation, flaring nostrils and raising eyebrows. It also carries taste sensations from the anterior two-thirds of the tongue, via the chorda tympani nerve (a branch of the <b>facial</b> <b>nerve).</b> Because of this, people with Bell's palsy may present with loss of taste sensation in the anterior 2/3 of the tongue on the affected side.|$|E
50|$|Some {{researchers}} {{have suggested that}} the underlying problem of this disorder could be congenital hypoplasia or agenesis of the cranial nerve nuclei. Certain symptoms associated with Möbius syndrome may be caused by incomplete development of <b>facial</b> <b>nerves,</b> other cranial nerves, {{and other parts of the}} central nervous system.|$|R
50|$|During development, semaphorins {{and their}} receptors may be {{involved}} in the sorting of pools of motor neurons and the modulation of pathfinding for afferent and efferent axons from and to these pools.

25|$|Bell's palsy is {{the most}} common cause of one sided <b>facial</b> <b>nerve</b> {{paralysis}} (70%). It occurs in 1 to 4 per 10,000 people per year. About 1.5% of people are affected at some point in their life. It most commonly occurs in people between ages 15 and 60. Males and females are affected equally. It is named after Scottish surgeon Charles Bell (1774–1842), who first described the connection of the <b>facial</b> <b>nerve</b> to the condition.|$|E
25|$|Surgery {{may be able}} {{to improve}} {{outcomes}} in <b>facial</b> <b>nerve</b> palsy that has not recovered. A number of different techniques exist. Smile surgery or smile reconstruction is a surgical procedure that may restore the smile for people with <b>facial</b> <b>nerve</b> paralysis. It is unknown if early surgery is beneficial or harmful. Adverse effects include hearing loss which occurs in 3–15% of people. As of 2007 the American Academy of Neurology did not recommend surgical decompression.|$|E
25|$|The translabyrinthine {{approach}} will sacrifice hearing on that side, but will usually spare the <b>facial</b> <b>nerve.</b> Post-operative cerebrospinal fluid leaks are more common.|$|E
