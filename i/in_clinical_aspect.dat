40|$|Abstract Fixed and mobile-bearing {{in total}} knee {{arthroplasty}} are still discussed controversially. In this article, biomechanical and clinical aspects in both fixed and mobile-bearing designs were reviewed. In biomechanical aspect, the mobile-bearing design {{has proved to}} provide less tibiofemoral contact stresses under tibiofemoral malalignment conditions. It also provides less wear rate in in-vitro simulator test. Patients with posterior stabilized mobile-bearing knees had more axial tibiofemoral rotation than patients with posterior stabilized fixed-bearing knees during gait {{as well as in}} a deep knee-bend activity. However, <b>in</b> <b>clinical</b> <b>aspect,</b> the mid-term or long-term survivorship of mobile-bearing knees has no superiority over that of fixed-bearing knees. The theoretical advantages for mobile-bearing design to provide a long-term durability have not been demonstrated by any outcome studies. Finally, the fixed-bearing design with all-polyethylene tibial component is suggested for relatively inactive, elder people. The mobile-bearing design is suggested for younger or higher-demand patients due to the potential for reduced polyethylene wear and more normal kinematics response after joint replacement. For younger surgeon, the fixed-bearing design is suggested due to less demand for surgical technique. For experienced surgeon, one familiar surgical protocol and instrumentation is suggested rather than implant design, either fixed-bearing or mobile-bearing. </p...|$|E
40|$|The {{carbohydrate}} metabolism in the carcinogenesis of DAB fed rat hepatoma was investigated {{by studying the}} G- 6 -Pase and Glucokinase activities to analyse the marked increase of glycolysis and decrease of respiration in the cancer tissue. And same time, these enzymes activities were measured in embrionic, new born, and regeneratig rat liver, which showed rapid growth and cell division, to study whether there was biochemical specificity in hepatoma. The liver homogenate G- 6 -Pase activity decreased progressively along with DAB feeding and was almost absent in the hepatoma tissue, while the glucokinase activity increased gradually and about 4 times of normal activity in cancer tissue. On the other hand, there was no change of glucokinase activity in the embrionic, new born, regenerating, or normal rat liver. And the G- 6 -Pase activity was almost absent in the embrionic rat liver and showed rapid increase after birth to maximum in 12 th day born rat liver. From these results, both enzymes have important significance in the elevated glycolysis in cancer, although only G- 6 -Pase seems rate limiting factor in the physiologically elevated glycolysis state of the liver. So difinite difference was recognized between hepatoma and these tissues biochemically. The serum G- 6 -Pase activities in the carcinogenesis of DAB fed rat showed no significant change from normal rat. For clinical application, the serum G- 6 -Pase activities of various patients were also measured. Patients with hepatic disturbance especially acute hepatitis or active hepatitis demonstrated significant elevation of the G- 6 -Pase activity, while no other patient did not. So the measurement of serum G- 6 -Pase activity is very useful <b>in</b> <b>clinical</b> <b>aspect...</b>|$|E
40|$|To prospectively {{examine the}} {{relation}} between tumor vascularity and glucose metabolism in adenocarcinoma (AC) and squamous cell carcinoma(SCC) of the lung by using positron emission tomography/computed tomography (PET/CT) and dynamic contrast enhanced magnetic resonance imaging (DCE-MRI). Forty-one consecutive patients with histologically confirmed untreated NSCLC underwent routine diagnostic work-up, including DCE-MRI and PET/CT. PET/CT images were used to derive glucose metabolism (SUVmax and SUVmean), and DCE-MRI images were used to derive tumor vascularity (Ktrans, Kep, Ve and iAUC). Any differences in the DCE-MRI and PET/CT estimations between the NSCLC subtypes were determined by the Wilcoxon rank sum test. Spearman's rank correlation coefficients were calculated between the DCE-MRI parameter values and the SUV. SUVmean and SUVmax in AC were significantly lower than in SCC, but Ktrans and Ve in AC {{were significantly higher than}} in SCC. Significant correlations between SUV and DCE-MRI parameters were observed for SUVmax and Ve (ρ = - 0. 357, P =  0. 022), SUVmean and Ktrans (ρ = - 0. 341, P =  0. 029), and SUVmean and iAUC (ρ = - 0. 374, P =  0. 016) in total; for SUVmax and iAUC (ρ = - 0. 420, P =  0. 037), SUVmean and Ktrans (ρ = - 0. 411, P =  0. 041), SUVmean and Kep (ρ = - 0. 045, P =  0. 026), and SUVmean and iAUC (ρ = - 0. 512, P =  0. 009) in AC; However, for neither in SCC. AC and SCC showed different patterns in both tumor vascularity and glucose metabolism. Tumor vascularity and glucose metabolism negatively correlated in AC, but not in SCC.

40|$|Although {{the number}} of {{ulcerative}} colitis patients has increased rapidly in Japan, few reports have been published regarding their <b>clinical</b> <b>aspects.</b> We investigated the clinical characteristics and chronological change of ulcerative colitis in Japanese patients. METHODS: Patients diagnosed with ulcerative colitis {{during the period from}} 1981 to 2000 were registered and their clinical profiles were analyzed. The chronological changes <b>in</b> <b>clinical</b> <b>aspects,</b> such as onset age, sex distribution, severity, extent of disease, clinical course, and corticosteroid use, were also determined. RESULTS: A total of 844 patients were registered, composed of 431 men and 413 women, with a median onset age of 34 years. The proportion of mild colitis and proctitis was significantly larger in patients with an onset at over 60 years of age, relative to those with an onset at less than 30 years (P< 0. 016). The proportion of ulcerative colitis patients with old age onset (P= 0. 09), male sex (P< 0. 01), mild colitis (P< 0. 01), proctitis (P< 0. 01), one-attack-only type (P< 0. 01), and not-treated-with-corticosteroid (P< 0. 01) demonstrated a chronological increase from 1981 to 2000. CONCLUSIONS: The distinctive clinical features and chronological change were seen in Japanese ulcerative colitis patients in recent years.

40|$|The Sporothrix complex members cause sporotrichosis, a {{subcutaneous}} mycosis {{with a wide}} spectrum of clinical manifestations. Several specific phenotypic characteristics are associated with virulence in many fungi, but studies in this field involving the Sporothrix complex species are scarce. Melanization, thermotolerance, and production of proteases, catalase, and urease were investigated in 61 S. brasiliensis, one S. globosa, and 10 S. schenckii strains. The S. brasiliensis strains showed a higher expression of melanin and urease compared with S. schenckii. These two species, however, presented similar thermotolerances. Our S. globosa strain had low expression of all studied virulence factors. The relationship between these phenotypes and <b>clinical</b> <b>aspects</b> of sporotrichosis was also evaluated. Strains isolated from patients with spontaneous regression of infection were heavily melanized and produced high urease levels. Melanin was also related to dissemination of internal organs and protease production was associated with HIV-coinfection.

40|$|Autism Spectrum Disorder (ASD) is {{a common}} {{disorder}} with an heterogeneous clinical presentation and unclear etiology. Rare, highly penetrant, variants explain approximately 20 % of ASD genetic liability, while common genetic factors of low effect, which combine in affected individuals to reach a pathological threshold, {{have not yet been}} identified. Epigenetic factors may additionally modulate the effect of genetic variants. ASD overlaps with other Neurodevelopmental Disorders (NDD), both <b>in</b> <b>clinical</b> <b>aspects</b> and <b>in</b> causative genetic variants, frequently rendering specific diagnosis difficult 1, 5. Here we hypothesize that, while genetic variants overlap in a large extent between NDDs, epigenetic factors may regulate the expression, activity or function of genetic factors, leading to the characteristic phenotypic presentation that differentiates ASD from other NDDs. To test this hypothesis, we addressed the role of epigenetic factors in ASD, focusing on microRNAs (miRNAs). These small noncoding RNA molecules negatively regulate gene expression, influencing many biological processes and, because they are released from pathological tissues to plasma in disease situations, may constitute useful biomarkers. We thus profiled miRNAs in plasma from ASD patients and patients with other NDDs. Projeto Autism Spectrum Disorder in the European Union - ASDEU financiado pela DG-SANCO; FC...|$|R

It plays {{a crucial role}} in the absorption of small peptides including not only > 400 different dipeptides and 8, 000 tripeptides digested from dietary proteins but also a repertoire of structurally related compounds and drugs. Owing to its critical role in the bioavailability of peptide-like drugs, such as the anti-cancer agents and anti-virus drug, PepT 1 is increasingly becoming a striking prodrug-designing target. Therefore, the understanding of PepT 1 gene regulation is of great importance both for dietary adaptation and for clinical drug treatment. After decades of research, it has been recognized that PepT 1 could be regulated at the transcriptional and post-transcriptional levels by numerous factors.

40|$|Schizophrenia is {{a severe}} {{psychiatric}} disorder with {{a complex and}} variable set of symptoms. Both genetic and environmental mechanisms {{are involved in the}} development of the illness and lead to structural and neurochemical abnormalities in the brain. An intriguing facet of schizophrenia is sex differences, which have been described for nearly all features of the illness, including the peak age of onset, symptoms and treatment response. The ovarian hormone, estrogen, may be protective against schizophrenia and evidence is accumulating that estrogen may exert this effect via an interaction with brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF). Both estrogen and BDNF have trophic effects on the developing brain and promote synaptic plasticity and maintain neurons well into adulthood. Major neurotransmitter systems including dopaminergic, serotonergic and glutamatergic pathways are modulated and supported by estrogen and BDNF. Despite their commonalities, estrogen and BDNF have mostly been examined independently but increasing evidence suggests an interaction between the two in brain regions pertinent to schizophrenia. This review will focus on the role of estrogen and BDNF <b>in</b> <b>clinical</b> and animal studies of schizophrenia. We include animal models of neurotransmitter dysfunction and genetic manipulation to show how estrogen may provide a protective effect in schizophrenia, including through mediating BDNF expression and activity. This posited estrogen-BDNF interaction could play a key role in modulating sex-dependent results reported in animal work as well as sex differences <b>in</b> <b>clinical</b> <b>aspects</b> of schizophrenia.

40|$|Background: Cystic adrenal lesions (CALs) {{represent}} a rare entity having heterogeneity <b>in</b> etiology and <b>clinical</b> manifestations. Due to their very low incidence and heterogeneity <b>in</b> <b>clinical</b> <b>aspects,</b> many controversials still exist about their management. Methods: From 1984 to 2012, 21 patients (7 M, 14 F, mean age 48. 2 years) underwent adrenalectomy for CALs. 9 patients suffered from hypertension, and 7 {{were affected by}} thyroid disorders. Results: 4 patients presented with vague abdominal pain, while in 17 patients the CAL was incidentally identified during imaging examinations. All patients underwent evaluation of adrenal functionality and imaging study. We found 1 case of cystic pheochromocytoma (confirmed by urinary and blood sampling, and MIBG-scan). All patients underwent adrenalectomy (open approach in the first 10 patients treated from 1984 to 1996, laparoscopic lateral transabdominal approach in the other 11 cases). Indication to surgery included: size over 4. 5  cm in 16 cases, suspected malignancy at imaging evaluation (not confirmed by histology) in 4 cases, cystic pheochromocytoma in 1 case. Histology revealed 11 endothelial cysts, 3 pseudocysts, 6 epithelial cysts and 1 cystic pheochromocytoma. Conclusions:The presence of CAL, even asymptomatic, requires complete endocrinological evaluation and imaging study. In the presence of large size, endocrine activity or any suspicion of malignancy, patients must be referred to surgery. Copyright © 2014 Surgical Associates Ltd. Published by Elsevier Ltd.
