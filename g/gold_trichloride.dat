[...] With the molecular formula Au2Cl6, the name <b>gold</b> <b>trichloride</b> is a simplification, referring to the empirical formula, AuCl3. [...] The Roman numerals in the name indicate that the gold has an oxidation state of +3, which is common for gold compounds. [...] There is also another related chloride of gold, gold(I) chloride (AuCl). [...] Chloroauric acid, HAuCl4, the product formed when gold dissolves in aqua regia, is {{sometimes referred to as}} [...] "gold chloride" [...] or [...] "acid gold trichloride".

50|$|A {{variety of}} {{reagents}} {{have been used}} to dope PTs. Iodine and bromine produce highly conductive materials, which are unstable owing to slow evaporation of the halogen. Organic acids, including trifluoroacetic acid, propionic acid, and sulfonic acids produce PTs with lower conductivities than iodine, but with higher environmental stabilities. Oxidative polymerization with ferric chloride can result in doping by residual catalyst, although matrix-assisted laser desorption/ionization mass spectrometry (MALDI-MS) studies have shown that poly(3-hexylthiophene)s are also partially halogenated by the residual oxidizing agent. Poly(3-octylthiophene) dissolved in toluene can be doped by solutions of ferric chloride hexahydrate dissolved in acetonitrile, and can be cast into films with conductivities reaching 1 S/cm. Other, less common p-dopants include <b>gold</b> <b>trichloride</b> and trifluoromethanesulfonic acid.|$|E

50|$|Calculations {{indicate}} {{that in the}} hypothetical monomeric forms of the gold trihalides, the Jahn-Teller effect causes differences to arise in the structures of the gold halide complexes. For instance, gold(III) bromide contains one long and two short gold-bromine bonds whereas gold(III) chloride and gold(III) fluoride consist of two long and one short gold-halogen bonds. Moreover, gold tribromide does not exhibit the same coordination around the central gold atom as <b>gold</b> <b>trichloride</b> or gold trifluoride. In the latter complexes, the coordination exhibits a T-conformation, but in gold tribromide the coordination exists {{as more of a}} dynamic balance between a Y-conformation and a T-conformation. This coordination difference {{can be attributed to the}} Jahn-Teller effect but more so to the decrease in π-back bonding of the gold atoms with the bromine ligands compared to the π-back bonding found with fluorine and chlorine ligands. It is also this decrease in π-back bonding which explains why gold tribromide is less stable than its trifluoride and trichloride counterparts.|$|E
30|$|Gold {{nanoparticles}} (GNPs) {{have generated}} much interest {{due to their}} unique and attractive physical and chemical properties, such as high thermal and electrical conductivity, photothermal effects, tunable size and shape dependent optical properties, chemical stability, biocompatibility and facile functionalisation, and are used {{in a wide range}} of applications including material science, catalysis, biomedicine, and quantum dots technology [1 – 6]. Since the first scientific research on the formation of gold colloids by the reduction of <b>gold</b> <b>trichloride</b> by phosphorus was published by Faraday in 1857 [7], various methods for the synthesis of colloidal gold have been used, such as chemical methods [8 – 11]. The well-known Turkevich method [8, 12] is the simplest way to produce aqueous suspensions of monodispersed GNPs with good stability [13].|$|E
40|$|Rapid {{synthesis}} of gold nanoparticles (AuNPs) by pulsed electrodeposition {{was investigated in}} the non-aqueous electrolyte, 1 -ethyl- 3 -methyl-imidazoliumbis(trifluoro-methanesulfonyl) imide ([EMIM]TFSI) with <b>gold</b> <b>trichloride</b> (AuCl 3). To aid the dissolution of AuCl 3, 1 -ethyl- 3 -methyl-imidazolium chloride ([EMIM]Cl) {{was used as a}} supporting electrolyte in [EMIM]TFSI. Cyclic voltammetry experiments revealed a cathodic reaction corresponding to the reduction of gold at − 0. 4 V vs. Pt-QRE. To confirm the electrodeposition process, potentiostatic electrodeposition of gold in the non-aqueous electrolyte was conducted at − 0. 4 V for 1 h at room temperature. To synthesize AuNPs, pulsed electrodeposition was conducted with controlled duty factor, pulse duration, and overpotential. The composition, particle-size distribution, and morphology of the AuNPs were confirmed by field-emission scanning electron microscopy (FE-SEM), energy-dispersive spectroscopy (EDS), and transmission electron microscopy (TEM). The electrodeposited AuNPs were uniformly distributed on the platinum electrode surface without any impurities arising from the non-aqueous electrolyte. The size distribution of AuNPs could be also controlled by the electrodeposition conditions...|$|E
30|$|Topp et al. {{also studied}} Au NPs {{stabilized}} by DDA that were synthesized by {{the method of}} Jana and Peng [29]. This single phase synthesis involved first dissolving DDA and <b>gold</b> <b>trichloride</b> (AuCl 3) in toluene {{with the aid of}} the surfactant didodecyldimethylammonium bromide (DDAB) and ultrasonication [27]. Next, the reducing agent tetrabutylammonium borohydride (TBAB) dissolved in toluene containing DDAB was added to the AuCl 3 solution. Note that both the starting reagents and solvents are different from those used by Kim and Carroll [15]. Au–DDA NPs with a diameter of 7.0  nm and a much narrower size distribution than that in ref [15] were formed. Au NPs with DDA ligands were dissolved in chlorobenzene and added directly to a solution of P 3 HT:PC 61 BM. For an active layer containing 3  wt% Au (with reference to weight of P 3 HT), the PCE was found to be 2.9 %. This was lower than the PCE of 3.2 % of the reference device. The reduction in PCE was due to reduced V oc, J sc and FF and the PCE reduction increased with the Au–DDA NP loading. This negative effect of Au–DDA NPs in P 3 HT:PC 61 BM devices is different from the positive effect of Au–DDA NPs in P 3 OT:C 60 devices in [15]. Topp et al. argued that the insulating nature of the DDA ligand shell as evidenced by the forward biased dark IV characteristic is the cause of the negative effect.|$|E
