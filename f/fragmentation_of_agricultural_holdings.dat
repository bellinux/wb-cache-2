40|$|This paper aims {{to give an}} {{overview}} of the main technical and policy issues that have {{to be taken into account}} when land consolidation is implemented in the most practicable way. The paper focuses on land consolidation for agricultural purposes, that is land consolidation as an instrument to abolish <b>fragmentation</b> <b>of</b> <b>agricultural</b> <b>holdings.</b> Land consolidation for specific non-agricultural purposes such as nature and landscape is not an issue in this paper. Land consolidation on a voluntary basis implies too much uncertainty with respect to its final results. Land consolidation can only be carried out in an efficient way when it is based on special legislation. Therefore the description of the land consolidation process in this paper emanates from a process provided by law. In countries where land consolidation already has a long history, procedures have become rather complicated, because over the years the instrument of land consolidation has been developed in such a way that the fulfilment of a variety of different goals with respect to the development of the rural area can be achieved. The advanced multi-purpose character of the instrument may imply that the instrument is becoming too inert. Therefore there is a need t...|$|E
40|$|In Denmark, {{there has}} been {{widespread}} opposition {{to the use of}} Genetically Modified Organisms (GMO’s) as a result of which rules have been developed relating to the co-existence of GM, conventionally and organically produced crops. This has been {{in the form of a}} spatially elaborated implementation of the precautionary principle adopted in the Maastricht treaty from 1992 by the EU (Andersen, 2000). We concretised these rules in relation to actual landscape practices among primary producers of sugar beet in Denmark, we simulated the co-existence of GM and conventional sugar beet in an area of intensive sugar beet production on Lolland, South Eastern Denmark. The theoretical basis for our work finds three major sources of inspiration namely Ulrich Beck’s theory of the `Risk Society´, Torsten Hägerstrand’s concept of `the progress landscape´ and its relation to the social practices of land users, and Brian Wynne’s studies of the discrepancy between theoretical and practical knowledge related to environmental risk. The farmers, who were involved in the study, were interviewed concerning their opinions on land use practices in cases of co-existence. Interviews were carried out both before and after the study took place. It is concluded that although the farmers are positive towards the possibility of introducing GM sugar beet, it is not realistic to expect the rules of co-existence to be observed, which makes the risk assessment behind the new rules unrealistical. Further studies of social practice in relation to trends and geographical variations in the distribution of structure, size and <b>fragmentation</b> <b>of</b> <b>agricultural</b> <b>holdings</b> are recommended in order to investigate possibilities for realistic co-existence...|$|E
