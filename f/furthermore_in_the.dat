5|$|Several Australian species {{practice}} acoustic and vibration {{behavior as}} {{an aspect of}} courtship. They have been observed producing hisses and whistles from air forced through the spiracles. <b>Furthermore,</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> presence of a potential mate, some cockroaches tap the substrate in a rhythmic, repetitive manner. Acoustic signals may be of greater prevalence amongst perching species, particularly those that live on low vegetation in Australia's tropics.|$|E
5|$|The pre-Islamic Middle East was {{dominated}} by the Byzantine and Sassanian empires. The Roman-Persian Wars between the two had devastated the region, making the empires unpopular amongst local tribes. <b>Furthermore,</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> lands that would be conquered by Muslims many Christians (Nestorians, Monophysites, Jacobites and Copts) were disaffected from the Eastern Orthodox Church which deemed them heretics. Within a decade Muslims conquered Mesopotamia, Byzantine Syria, Byzantine Egypt, large parts of Persia, and established the Rashidun Caliphate.|$|E

5|$|Long's demise {{did not end}} the {{sequence}} of self-proclaimed mystics who raised armies and engaged in politics. During the interwar period, a sorcerer named Chem Keo claimed to be Long's reincarnation. During World War II, Huỳnh Phú Sổ {{claimed to be a}} living Buddha and quickly gathered more than a million supporters. He raised a large peasant army and battled both the French and the communist Viet Minh independence movement, before being killed by the latter. In another case in 1939, a Taoist attempted to demonstrate that he was immune to French bullets. <b>Furthermore,</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> years immediately after World War II, the Cao Đài's numbers swelled to 1.5million.|$|E
5|$|The {{sketches}} {{were written}} {{during the spring}} and summer of 1828, possibly even earlier. The inner movements were sketched up to the final bar, while the outer, sonata-form movements were only sketched up to the beginning of the recapitulation and in the coda. In the sketches, passages from different movements (or even different sonatas) sometimes appear on the same leaf; such evidence suggests that the last two sonatas were composed in parallel, at least in part. <b>Furthermore,</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> B-flat Sonata, Schubert sketched the finale before completing the first movement, unlike his usual practice, in which finales were conceived at a later stage.|$|E

25|$|<b>Furthermore,</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> early 3rd century, Rome had to {{acknowledge}} sovereignty of Caucasian Albania and Armenia to Sassanid Persia, but all {{what is now}} Georgia was back under Roman control with Aurelian and Diocletian around 300 AD.|$|E

25|$|When {{the number}} of {{oscillators}} (particles) is increased to three, the orthogonal matrix {{can no longer be}} described by a single angle; instead, three are required (Euler angles). <b>Furthermore,</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> quantum case, the matrices may be complex. This requires the introduction of complex phases in addition to the rotation angles, which are associated with CP violation but do not influence the observable effects of neutrino oscillation.|$|E
25|$|The Empire of Aksum {{is notable}} {{for a number}} of achievements, such as its own alphabet, the Ge'ez script which was {{eventually}} modified to include vowels, becoming an abugida. <b>Furthermore,</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> early times of the empire, around 1700 years ago, giant Obelisks to mark emperors' (and nobles') tombs (underground grave chambers) were constructed, the most famous of which is the Obelisk of Aksum.|$|E
25|$|Campylobacter {{is one of}} {{the most}} common causes of human {{bacterial}} gastroenteritis.

About 15 of every 100,000 people are diagnosed with campylobacteriosis every year, and with many cases going unreported, up to 0.5% of the general population may unknowingly harbor Campylobacter in their gut.|$|E

25|$|The {{logistic}} {{service of}} the Project was performed by Maria Lanzellotti, and was vital for the contacts with local, regional and national administrations for authorisations, contacts with supporting companies, logistics, organisations of meetings of Working Groups and conferences, public relations, etc. <b>Furthermore,</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> second stage of the Project, the Association SFERA managed numerous organisational aspects.

25|$|Law no. 273/2004 on the {{procedure}} of adoption in Romania does not stipulate {{as a condition}} of the adopter to be heterosexual, so under the domestic laws a homosexual can claim to an adopt a child. <b>Furthermore,</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> case of E.B. v. France (2008), the Grand Chamber of the Strasbourg Court ruled that the authorities' refusal to allow a person to adopt a child on the basis of sexual orientation creates a difference of treatment incompatible with human rights.

25|$|In {{families}} {{with more than}} one child (twins or triplets), it has been found that maternal sensitivity is lower, as there are more needs {{to be taken care of}} by the mother and less time to form a unique bond, which in turn results in decreased cognitive development in the infants (relative to if the child were raised alone). <b>Furthermore,</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> newborn period, women who displayed high maternal sensitivity had children who were able to regulate their emotions and who had higher symbolic and cognitive skills. In the case of the triplets, the child that received the least maternal sensitivity was the one that showed the poorest outcomes cognitively and had the most medical problems.|$|E
