The detectors collected millions of cosmic rays during the magnet repairs which took place between fall 2008 and fall 2009, prior to the first proton collisions.

25|$|The basic hull {{design of}} Hamburg is a conventional, robust steel construction, with entirely flat decks amidship that slope {{slightly}} upwards towards the bow in {{a compromise between}} modern construction techniques and traditional <b>design</b> <b>values.</b> The superstructure adapted a clear, streamlined design in spirit of the modernism of the late 1960s. With usage as a cruise ships in mind, the ship was built with a mid-ship lido deck complex spanning two decks {{on the top of}} the ship. The upper level of the complex was extended all the way to the sides of the ship, allowing a view uninterrupted by lifeboats from the lido to the surrounding sea from behind the shelter provided by high glass screens. In addition to the lido deck, a large sports deck was designed behind the funnel.|$|E
