I was under {{exclusive}} contract, like they owned me… <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>he</b> <b>had</b> my dressing room bugged… He was very possessive of me as a person, he didn't want me to go out with anybody, have any friends. No one can live that way. So I fought him… You want to know what I think of Harry Cohn? He was a monster.|$|E
500|$|Franco did {{extensive}} research for his role. He {{went from being}} a non-smoker to smoking two packs of cigarettes a day, but has since quit the habit. He learned how to ride a motorcycle, play guitar, as well as the conga and bongo drums. The actor also carefully studied Dean's mannerisms by watching his three films (East of Eden, Rebel Without a Cause and Giant). Franco also read numerous biographies on Dean's life. The actor also took advice from some of Dean's closest friends, including Martin Landau, Dennis Hopper, Liz Sheridan (Dean's former girlfriend) and Leonard Rosenman. [...] "Martin was the most informative person that I spoke to. He helped me tremendously with James's physical mannerisms," [...] Franco reflected. [...] "I isolated myself a lot during the filming. I did this because <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>he</b> <b>had</b> a pervasive loneliness throughout his life and I wanted to feel what that felt like. Not talking to my family or loved ones had quite an emotional effect on me." ...|$|E
500|$|Anderle later {{stated that}} the line [...] "was taken {{slightly}} out of context" [...] and that Love was {{more concerned with the}} [...] "bottom line" [...] than the [...] "artistic" [...] side of business. [...] Asher did not recall hearing the remark and could not verify whether it was actually spoken. He said that, [...] "it seems very much like Mike. And to tell the truth, <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>he</b> <b>had</b> a point," [...] arguing that Pet Sounds [...] "was not much of a success" [...] and that its music [...] "was [...] not what Beach Boys fans were expecting." [...] Parks believes that Love's hostility toward Wilson and Smile was [...] "the deciding factor" [...] in the album's cancellation. In a 1998 deposition related to the memoir , Wilson testified that Love had never spoken the line to him, and when asked if Love's opposition to the lyrics made him shelve the album, he responded: [...] "No. There weren't as many lyrics as there was just—see, Smile wasn't a lyrical thing." ...|$|E

500|$|Flight 367 {{departed}} from Stockholm Arlanda Airport at 1:30p.m. on 26 January. The aircraft, a McDonnell Douglas DC-9, landed at Copenhagen Airport at 2:30p.m., {{where it was}} taken over by Vulović and her colleagues. [...] "As it was late, we were in the terminal and saw it park," [...] Vulović said. [...] "I saw all the passengers and crew deplane. One man seemed terribly annoyed. It was not only me that noticed him either. Other crew members saw him, as did the station manager in Copenhagen. I think it was the man who put the bomb in the baggage. <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>he</b> <b>had</b> checked in a bag in Stockholm, got off in Copenhagen and never re-boarded the flight." [...] Flight 367 {{departed from}} Copenhagen Airport at 3:15p.m. At 4:01p.m., an explosion tore through the DC-9's baggage compartment. The explosion caused the aircraft to break apart mid-air over the Czechoslovak village of Srbská Kamenice. Vulović {{was the only one of}} the 28 passengers and crew to survive the crash. She was discovered by a villager named Bruno Honke, who heard her screaming amid the wreckage. Her turquoise uniform was covered in blood and her [...] stiletto heels had been torn off by the force of the impact. Honke had been a medic during World War II and was able to keep her alive until rescuers arrived at the scene.|$|E
2500|$|After {{two years}} of calling {{baseball}} telecasts for CBS, Jack Buck was dismissed in December 1991. According to the radio veteran Buck, he {{had a hard time}} adjusting to the demands of a more constricting television production. CBS felt that Buck should have done more to make himself appear to be a set-up man for lead analyst Tim McCarver. Jack Buck's son Joe tried to rationalize his father's on-air problems by saying [...] "My dad was brought up in the golden age of radio, <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>he</b> <b>had</b> his hands tied somewhat, being accustomed to the freedom of radio. I'm more used to acquiescing to what the producer wants to do, what the director wants to do." ...|$|E
2500|$|Harrison Ford {{considers}} Deckard to be human. [...] "That was {{the main}} area of contention between Ridley and myself at the time," [...] Ford told an interviewer during a BBC One Hollywood Greats segment. [...] "I thought the audience deserved one human being on screen that they could establish an emotional relationship with. I thought I had won Ridley's agreement to that, but in fact <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>he</b> <b>had</b> a little reservation about that. I think {{he really wanted to}} have it both ways." [...] Scott suggests that Ford may have since changed his view, although Blade Runner 2049 director Denis Villeneuve claimed that Ford and Scott argue about the issue to this day. Other people involved in the movie's production who have expressed the view that Deckard is human include: David Snyder (art director), M. Emmet Walsh (who portrayed Bryant) and Rutger Hauer (who portrayed Roy Batty).|$|E
6000|$|... "By no means. But {{you know}} <b>he</b> <b>has</b> a roving disposition, and <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>he</b> <b>has</b> {{a sort of}} fondness for Jackson--the boss of the ranch." ...|$|R

6000|$|... "I must admit," [...] {{the doctor}} answered, [...] "that <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>he</b> <b>has</b> very {{little chance of}} recovery. His {{constitution}} <b>has</b> gone. <b>He</b> <b>has</b> no recuperative powers." ...|$|R
2500|$|In a 1998 {{interview}} for George magazine, Westmoreland criticized the battlefield prowess of his direct opponent, North Vietnamese general Vo Nguyen Giap. [...] "Of course, he [...] was a formidable adversary", Westmoreland told correspondent W. Thomas Smith Jr. [...] "Let me {{also say that}} Giap was trained in small-unit, guerrilla tactics, but he persisted in waging a big-unit war with terrible losses to his own men. By his own admission, by early 1969, <b>I</b> <b>think,</b> <b>he</b> <b>had</b> lost, what, a half million soldiers? He reported this. Now such a disregard for human life may make a formidable adversary, {{but it does not}} make a military genius. An American commander losing men like that would hardly have lasted more than a few weeks." [...] In the 1974 film Hearts and Minds, Westmoreland opined that [...] "The Oriental doesn't put the same high price on life as does a Westerner. ... We value life and human dignity. They don't care about life and human dignity." ...|$|E
2500|$|Quicker than thought I {{brought my}} saber down {{with all my}} {{strength}} upon [...] head. He was moving as the blow fell, and I suppose I did not strike him where I intended, for he received a deep saber cut {{in the back of}} the neck. He fell senseless on his side, then rolled over on his back. He had in his hand a short Sharpe's cavalry carbine. <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>he</b> <b>had</b> just fired as I reached Colonel Washington, for the Marine who followed me into the aperture made by the ladder received a bullet in the abdomen, from which he died in a few minutes. The shot might have been fired by someone else in the insurgent party, but I think it was from Brown. Instinctively as Brown fell I gave him a saber thrust in the left breast. The sword I carried was a light uniform weapon, and, either not having a point or striking something hard in Brown's accouterments, did not penetrate. The blade bent double.|$|E
2500|$|When Chandler came to {{work with}} Wilder he was already a {{recovering}} alcoholic. As Wilder noted, [...] "He was in Alcoholics Anonymous, and <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>he</b> <b>had</b> a tough time with me – I drove him back into drinking..." [...] By the time the picture was released, Chandler was thoroughly disillusioned with the writers' lot in Hollywood; he published an angry piece titled [...] "Writers in Hollywood" [...] for The Atlantic Monthly in November 1945 in which he complained: [...] "The first picture I worked on was nominated for an Academy Award (if that means anything), but I was not even invited to the press review held right in the studio." [...] He neglected, however, {{to mention that the}} studio had kept him on salary during the eight-week shooting schedule and that no changes to the script were allowed without his approval – a very rare accommodation for screenwriters, particularly newcomers, in those days. Offended, Wilder responded by saying, [...] "We didn't invite him? How could we? He was under the table drunk at Lucy's," [...] a nearby watering hole for Paramount employees. This relationship with Chandler is what drew Wilder to his next project, the Best Picture-winning The Lost Weekend, about an alcoholic writer. Wilder made the film, in part, [...] "to explain Chandler to himself." ...|$|E

6000|$|... "He is gone, poor fellow!" [...] he said. [...] "He {{never spoke}} again. The bullet went {{close to the}} heart. <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>he</b> <b>has</b> bled to death, internally.|$|R
2500|$|Shortly {{before the}} {{findings}} of the inquiry into Wright's death were released in September 2010, Ulster Television News broadcast a report regarding the question of collusion. South Belfast UDA brigadier Jackie McDonald explained to Ulster Television's Live Tonight the UVF's mindset at the time Wright was threatened with execution by the CLMC in 1996, [...] "It was obvious he [...] was doing his own thing and going his own way. <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>he</b> <b>had</b> become such an embarrassment to the UVF that they had to send word to him {{to get out of the}} country – that's when the LVF was formed, that's when the breakaway group appeared." [...] When asked by the interviewer whether or not the CLMC had actually been prepared to carry out the death threat against Wright McDonald replied, [...] "You have to be prepared to kill people if you tell them to do something and they don't do it – something of that magnitude. If you say they had to go and they don't go – the defiance alone, it doesn't leave many alternatives". McDonald expressed his personal belief that there had probably been no state collusion in Wright's death. Equally dismissive of the allegations of collusion, Willie Gallagher of the Republican Socialist Movement offered the suggestion that had the INLA not killed Wright, he would have been released from prison shortly afterwards. Once free, Wright would have continued to conduct and orchestrate his murder campaign against nationalists.|$|E

6000|$|... "He is a gentleman." [...] said Lady Laura; [...] "and <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>he</b> <b>has</b> position. <b>I</b> {{do not see}} why {{he should}} not ask any girl to marry him." ...|$|R

6000|$|... "Easy with him," [...] Harry said. [...] "Steady {{with that}} arm. <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>he</b> <b>has</b> a {{shoulder}} broken, {{as well as}} this knock on the head that has stunned him." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "He is not sentimental," [...] said Mrs. Penniman; [...] "but, to be {{perfectly}} fair to him, <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>he</b> <b>has,</b> in his own narrow way, {{a certain sense of}} duty." ...|$|R
60|$|I threw {{myself on}} the sand, weary, hopeless, parched with thirst, and racked with pain. Bludger was already lying in a {{crumpled}} mass at my feet. <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>he</b> <b>had</b> fainted.|$|E

6000|$|... "I didn't know," [...] said Jimmy {{with some}} surprise. [...] "Bob claimed he hadn't {{a gun and}} <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>he</b> <b>had</b> not. Sometimes I'm puzzled, but I really think the unlucky shot was mine." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "He's my father's sister's husband--but that doesn't matter; I'd {{defend him}} {{if he were a}} stranger. <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>he</b> <b>has</b> been shamefully treated. The idea of searching his private desk!" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Yes, I have a {{right that}} you should say that--I {{have a right}} that you should always say it. <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>he</b> <b>has</b> behaved very foolishly, but I don't blame him----" ...|$|R
6000|$|... 'Indeed,' {{answered}} the young desperado, 'and <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>he</b> <b>has</b> had just a lang enough lease o 't, when he's for betraying honest folk {{that come to}} spend siller at his public.' ...|$|R
