5|$|In 1997, Matt and Jeff {{created their}} own wrestling promotion, The Organization of Modern Extreme Grappling Arts (frequently {{abbreviated}} to OMEGA Championship Wrestling, or simply OMEGA), in which Matt competed under the name High Voltage. The Hardys launched the promotion because, at the time, there weren't many places to wrestle, nor <b>did</b> <b>they</b> <b>know</b> anyone who could help. Both Matt and Jeff would take apart the ring {{and put it back}} together at every event they had, while Matt sewed all the costumes worn in OMEGA. The promotion would fold in October 1999, after both Matt and Jeff signed with the World Wrestling Federation. Eight years later in 2007, Highspots.com produced a two-disc DVD set entitled OMEGA: Uncommon Passion, chronicling the history of the promotion, including matches and interviews with many OMEGA wrestlers.|$|E

25|$|Saturday, {{on the eve}} of the game, NFL {{commissioner}} Pete Rozelle called Jim Kensil and Don Weiss, {{the executive}} directors of the NFL, for an update on the weather conditions. It is suspected that they informed him that Sunday's game time temperature of about 5° was playable. Rozelle, who in June 1966 had seen to it that the AFL-NFL Championship game would always be in a warm weather city, inquired if the game could be postponed until Monday. Predictions held Monday would be even colder than Sunday and the game was not postponed. Little <b>did</b> <b>they</b> <b>know</b> that the cold front would be far colder and would arrive much sooner than expected. The Packers, who had for years eschewed late-season home games because of the cold winters, would play host to the Cowboys in a game that would mark the coldest New Year's Eve in the history of Green Bay and the coldest title game in the history of the NFL, a record that still stands.|$|E
25|$|The 1804 {{silver dollar}} was {{actually}} produced in 1834, when the U.S. Department of State decided {{to produce a}} set of U.S. coins {{to be used as}} gifts to rulers in Asia in exchange for trade advantages. Since 1804 was the last recorded year of mintage for both the dollar and $10 Eagle, it was decided that the set would contain examples of those coins dated 1804, {{as well as the other}} denominations currently being produced. Mint officials, not realizing that the 19,000+ dollars recorded as being produced in 1804 were all dated 1803, proceeded to make new dies dated 1804. Little <b>did</b> <b>they</b> <b>know</b> the stunning rarity they were creating. Only 15 silver dollars with the date of 1804 are known to exist; in 1999, one of them sold at auction for more than $4 million. There are 8 Class I dollars, struck in 1834 for the aforementioned sets, 1 Class II dollar, struck over an 1857 Swiss Shooting Thaler (and now residing in the U.S. Coin Collection at the Smithsonian Institution), and 6 Class III dollars, struck surreptitiously sometime between 1858 and 1860 to meet collector demand for the coin.|$|E

However, Dever's {{definition of the}} temporal scope of the field in What Did the Biblical Writers Know, and When <b>Did</b> <b>They</b> <b>Know</b> It?

2500|$|The ICA armed {{itself with}} Mauser rifles bought from Germany by the Irish Volunteers and smuggled into Ireland at Howth in July 1914. This {{organisation}} {{was one of}} the first to offer equal membership to both men and women and trained them both in the use of weapons. The army's headquarters was the ITGWU union building, Liberty Hall and membership was almost entirely Dublin based. However, Connolly also set up branches in Tralee and Killarney in County Kerry. [...] Tom Clarke called a meeting of all the separatist groups in Dublin on 9 September 1914 to assist a German invasion of Ireland, and prevent the police disarming the volunteers. [...] An intellectual dispute broke out within the ranks of the ICA between Liam O'Briain, and the ICA's military commander, Michael Mallin. [...] he thought that the former's plan for an integrated movement was totally unrealistic. [...] O'Briain wanted to pursue a strategy without the Dublin brigade being [...] "cooped up in the city".

2500|$|From {{this same}} evidence, {{something}} {{can be seen}} of Saint Patrick's mission. He writes that he [...] "baptised thousands of people". He ordained priests to lead the new Christian communities. He converted wealthy women, some of whom became nuns {{in the face of}} family opposition. He also dealt with the sons of kings, converting them too. The Confessio is generally vague about the details of his work in Ireland, though giving some specific instances. This is partly because, as he says at points, he was writing for a local audience of Christians who knew him and his work. There are several mentions of travelling around the island, and of sometimes difficult interactions with the chiefly elite. He does claim of the Irish: Never before <b>did</b> <b>they</b> <b>know</b> of God except to serve idols and unclean things. But now, they have become the people of the Lord, and are called children of God. The sons and daughters {{of the leaders of the}} Irish are seen to be monks and virgins of Christ!Saint Patrick's position as a foreigner in Ireland was not an easy one. His refusal to accept gifts from kings placed him outside the normal ties of kinship, fosterage and affinity. Legally he was without protection, and he says that he was on one occasion beaten, robbed of all he had, and put in chains, perhaps awaiting execution. Patrick says that he was also [...] "many years later" [...] a captive for 60 days, without giving details.|$|E

According to this explanation, Moses sang, [...] "I will sing to the Lord," [...] and the Israelites responded, [...] "I will sing to the Lord"; then Moses sang, [...] "For He has triumphed gloriously," [...] and the Israelites once again responded, [...] "I will sing to the Lord." [...] Rabbi Eliezer son of Rabbi Jose the Galilean taught that Moses sang the entire song, one verse at a time, and the Israelites respond after him by repeating the entire song, one verse at a time, as where a minor read the Hallel for a congregation and they repeated after the minor all that minor had said. According to this explanation, Moses sang, [...] "I will sing to the Lord," [...] and the Israelites responded, [...] "I will sing to the Lord"; then Moses sang, [...] "For He has triumphed gloriously," [...] and the Israelites responded, [...] "For He has triumphed gloriously."
