50|$|The {{criss-cross}} algorithm {{works on}} a standard pivot tableau (or on-the-fly calculated parts of a tableau, if implemented like the revised simplex method). In a general step, if the tableau is primal or dual infeasible, it selects one of the infeasible rows / columns as the pivot row / column using an <b>index</b> <b>selection</b> rule. An important property is that the selection is made on the union of the infeasible indices and the standard version of the algorithm does not distinguish column and row indices (that is, the column indices basic in the rows). If a row is selected then the algorithm uses the <b>index</b> <b>selection</b> rule to identify a position to a dual type pivot, while if a column is selected then it uses the <b>index</b> <b>selection</b> rule to find a row position and carries out a primal type pivot.|$|E

Thirteen corn hybrids {{were used in}} a randomized complete block design with three replications in each location.

In the first index, heritability of traits with the same sign was used as economic values. <b>Selection</b> <b>index</b> including grain yield and net assimilation rate in the second stage (NAR 2) was the best.

5000|$|<b>Index</b> <b>Selection</b> is {{a method}} of {{artificial}} selection in which several useful traits are selected simultaneously. First, each trait {{that is going to}} be selected is assigned a weight - the importance of the trait. I.e., if you were selecting for both height and the coat darkness in dogs, if height were the more important of the two one would assign that a higher weighting. For instance, height's weighting could be ten and coat darkness could be one. This weighting value is then multiplied by the observed value in each individual animal and then the score for each of the characteristics is summed for each individual. This result is the index score and can be used to compare the worth of each organism being selected. Therefore, only those with the highest index score are selected for breeding via artificial selection.|$|E

In the literature, in <b>index</b> <b>selection</b> algorithms for relational databases, at most one index is considered as a candidate for each attribute of a relation. However, it is possible that more than one different type of indexes with different storage space requirements may be present as candidates for an attribute.

Thus, the algorithms available in the literature for optimal <b>index</b> <b>selection</b> may not be used when there are multiple candidates for each attribute and there is a need for a global optimization algorithm in which at most one index can be selected from a set of candidate indexes for an attribute.

40|$|Abstract Background The {{prediction}} of the outcomes from multistage breeding schemes {{is especially important}} for the introduction of genomic selection in dairy cattle. Decorrelated <b>selection</b> <b>indices</b> can be used for the optimisation of such breeding schemes. However, they decrease the accuracy of estimated breeding values and, therefore, the genetic gain to an unforeseeable extent and have not been applied to breeding schemes with different generation intervals and selection intensities in each selection path. Methods A grid search was applied in order to identify optimum breeding plans to maximise the genetic gain per year in a multistage, multipath dairy cattle breeding program. In this program, different values of the accuracy of estimated genomic breeding values and of their costs per individual were applied, whereby the total breeding costs were restricted. Both decorrelated <b>indices</b> and optimum <b>selection</b> <b>indices</b> were used together with fast multidimensional integration algorithms to produce results. Results In comparison to optimum indices, the genetic gain with decorrelated indices was up to 40 % less and the proportion of individuals undergoing genomic selection was different. Additionally, the interaction between selection paths was counter-intuitive and difficult to interpret. Independent of using decorrelated or optimum <b>selection</b> <b>indices,</b> genomic <b>selection</b> replaced traditional progeny testing when maximising the genetic gain per year, as long as the accuracy of estimated genomic breeding values was ≥ 0. 45. Overall breeding costs were mainly generated in the path "dam-sire". Selecting males was still the main source of genetic gain per year. Conclusion Decorrelated <b>selection</b> <b>indices</b> should not be used because of misleading results and the availability of accurate and fast algorithms for exact multidimensional integration. Genomic selection is the method of choice when maximising the genetic gain per year but genotyping females may not allow for a reduction in overall breeding costs. Furthermore, the economic justification of genotyping females remains questionable. </p...|$|R
