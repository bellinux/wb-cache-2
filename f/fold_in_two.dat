These protein structures are usually related to one single physiological protein activity.This hypothesis was, however, challenged by observations that proteins could <b>fold</b> <b>in</b> <b>two</b> alternative conformations, such as the prion proteins which exist in a physiologially active cellular form and an insoluble form.Extending the concept of a protein that exists in a soluble and an insoluble form, for the bacterial transcription factor RfaH two entirely different structures were observed to coexist in solution. RfaH is a two-domain protein, the C-terminal domain (CTD) of which can fold into alpha-helical and, alternatively, into beta-barrel form. These two interconvertible structures have two different functions, in alpha-helix form the CTD inhibits binding of the N-terminal domain to the RNA-polymerase, whereas the beta-barrel form recruits ribosomes.RfaH is thus the first member of the transformer protein class which obviously violates the original 'one sequence - one structure - one function' suggestion that governed protein research for decades [...]|$|E

40|$|Dimerization of genomic RNA {{is a key}} step in the {{retroviral}} {{life cycle}} and has been postulated {{to be involved in}} the regulation of translation, encapsidation and reverse transcription. Here, we have derived a secondary structure model of nucleotides upstream from psi and of the gag initiation region of Mo-MuLV RNA in monomeric and dimeric forms, using chemical probing, sequence comparison and computer prediction. The 5 ' domain is extensively base-paired and interactions take place between U 5 and 5 ' leader sequences. The U 5 -PBS subdomain can <b>fold</b> <b>in</b> <b>two</b> mutually exclusive conformations: a very stable and extended helical structure (E form) in which 17 of the 18 nucleotides of the PBS are paired, or an irregular three-branch structure (B form) in which 10 nucleotides of the PBS are paired. The dimeric RNA adopts the B conformation. The monomeric RNA can switch from the E to the B conformation by a thermal treatment. If the E to B transition is associated to dimerization, it may facilitate annealing of the primer tRNAPro to the PBS by lowering the free energy required for melting the PBS. Furthermore, dimerization induces allosteric rearrangements around the SD site and the gag initiation region...|$|E
40|$|The ribosomal protein S 15 {{controls}} its own translation by binding to a mRNA region overlapping the ribosome binding site. That {{region of}} the mRNA can <b>fold</b> <b>in</b> <b>two</b> mutually exclusive conformations that are in dynamic equilibrium: a structure with two hairpins and a pseudoknot. A mutational analysis provided evidence for the existence and requirement of the pseudoknot for translational control in vivo and S 15 recognition in vitro. In this study, we used chemical probing to analyze the structural consequences of mutations and their effect on the stem-loop/pseudoknot equilibrium. Interactions between S 15 and the pseudoknot structure were further investigated by footprinting experiments. These data, combined with computer modelling and the previously published data on S 15 binding and in vivo control, provide important clues on pseudoknot formation and S 15 recognition. An unexpected {{result is that the}} relevant control element, here the pseudoknot form, can exist in a variety of topologically equivalent structures recognizable and shapable by S 15.

The only family 3 glycoside hydrolase for which a three-dimensional structure is available is a beta-glucan exohydrolase from barley. The structural coordinates of the barley enzyme is used here to model representatives from distinct phylogenetic clusters within the family.

40|$|Abstract Background Secreted frizzled related {{proteins}} (SFRPs) are multifunctional modulators of Wnt and BMP (Bone Morphogenetic Protein) signalling {{necessary for}} the development of most organs and the homeostasis of different adult tissues. SFRPs <b>fold</b> <b>in</b> <b>two</b> independent domains: the cysteine rich domain (Sfrp CRD) related to the extracellular portion of Frizzled (Fz, Wnt receptors) and the Netrin module (Sfrp NTR) defined by homologies with molecules such as Netrin- 1, inhibitors of metalloproteinases and complement proteins. Due to its structural relationship with Fz, it is believed that Sfrp CRD interferes with Wnt signalling by binding and sequestering the ligand. In contrast, the functional relevance of the Sfrp NTR has been barely addressed. Results Here, we combine biochemical studies, mutational analysis and functional assays in cell culture and medaka-fish embryos to show that the Sfrp 1 NTR mimics the function of the entire molecule, binds to Wnt 8 and antagonizes Wnt canonical signalling. This activity requires intact tertiary structure and is shared by the distantly related Netrin- 1 NTR. In contrast, the Sfrp 1 CRD cannot mirror the function of the entire molecule in vivo but interacts with Fz receptors and antagonizes Wnt 8 -mediated β-catenin transcriptional activity. Conclusion On the basis of these results, we propose that SFRP modulation of Wnt signalling may involve multiple and differential interactions among Wnt, Fz and SFRPs. </p...|$|E
40|$|The {{fact that}} herbivores and predators exert {{top-down}} effects to alter community composition and dynamics at lower trophic levels {{is no longer}} controversial, yet we still lack evidence of the full nature, extent, and longer-term effects of these impacts. Here, we use results from a set of replicated experiments on the local impacts of white-tailed deer to evaluate {{the extent to which}} such impacts could account for half-century shifts in forest plant communities across the upper Midwest, USA. We measured species' responses to deer at four sites using 10 - 20 year-old deer exclosures. Among common species, eight were more abundant outside the exclosures, seven were commoner inside, and 16 had similar abundances in- and outside. Deer herbivory greatly increased the abundance of ferns and graminoids and doubled the abundance of exotic plants. In contrast, deer greatly reduced tree regeneration, shrub cover (100 - 200 <b>fold</b> <b>in</b> <b>two</b> species), plant height, plant reproduction, and the abundance of forbs. None of 36 focal species increased in reproduction or grew taller in the presence of deer, contrary to expectations. We compared these results to data on 50 -year regional shifts in species abundances across 62 sites. The effects of herbivory by white-tailed deer accurately account for many of the long-term regional shifts observed in species' abundances (R 2  =  0. 41). These results support the conjecture that deer impacts have driven many of the regional shifts in forest understory cover and composition observed in recent decades. Our ability to link results from shorter-term, local experiments to regional long-term studies of ecological change strengthens the inferences we can draw from both approaches...|$|E

40|$|Staphylococcus {{epidermidis}} is now {{among the}} most important nosocomial pathogenic agents owing its virulence to the adhesion and biofilm-forming abilities on medical surfaces, such as catheters. Biofilm control by antibiotics is often innefective and new strategies of biofilm control are being sought. One promising strategy is the use of bacteria-specific virus, known as bacteriophages, to control infections by pathogenic bacteria. Bacteriophages, also know as phages, have been suggested {{to be one of the}} most abundant biological agents on the planet. Phages are currently suggested as possible alternatives to antibiotics for the treatment of bacterial diseases in humans to minimize the pathogen loads in medical devices. The goal of this study was to isolate new phages with potential bactericidal activity against S. epidermidis clinical isolates. Bacteriophages were isolated from an effluent from Waste Water Treatment Plants or from Hospital efluents, using a set of 40 bacterial strains as background. Five phages were isolated but when determining the phage titer the achieved concentration was around 10 E 5 pfu/ml and this titer was reduced 1 <b>fold</b> <b>in</b> <b>two</b> week‘s time. In order to increase the concentration of bacteriophages, since the obtained concentration was not sufficient to use in biofilm assays, severall optimization steps were performed, using previous described isolation protocols, namelly: using different concentrations of CaCl 2, using different concentrations of top agar, using different buffers, and using different phage filtration systems. For the optimization protocols we selected the bacteriophage with the higher titters and found that an optimized protocol was achieved by using Tris Buffer, Top Agar at 0. 4 %, and purification with CsCl 2 gradient (q = 1. 3, 1. 5, and 1. 7) with ultracentrifugation at 100, 000 g for 1 h at 4 ⁰C. This phage titter was determined to be around 10 E 8 - 10 E 9 pfu/ml. The optimized produced phage was then characterized by determining the lytic spectrum. The phage was able to lyse 13 strains, and of these strains 10 had the biofilms genes present. Finally, the 10 selected strains were tested for biofilm formation, using the microtiter assay, and it was confirmed that they formed biofilms in TSB supplemented with 1 % glucose. For future work; we need to determine if we have lytic or temperate phages with DNA sequence analyses and to test the Phage against to the Biofilm formation of relevant bacterial strains...|$|E
40|$|M. Tech. Onychocryptosis is the {{diagnostic}} term for an ingrown toenail. It {{is a common}} and painful condition that occurs either when the nail grows into the skin on the lateral or medial side of the toe, or if the skin {{on the side of}} the toenail grows over the edge of the nail. Magnetis Polus Australis is a homoeopathic remedy recommended in the Homoeopathic Materia Medica specifically for the treatment of onychocryptosis. In previous studies, Rohl (2003) used the remedy Magnetis Polus Australis in a 7 cH and a 30 cH potency whereas Khan (2004) used it in a 200 cH and a 1 M potency. Their studies showed promising results but had sample sizes too small for definitive conclusions. In their respective studies, they recommend using Magnetis Polus Australis 2 M in a single dose. The present study was aimed at determining the efficacy of Magnetis Polus Australis in treating symptoms of onychocryptosis such as pain in the big toe (hallux), tenderness to pressure, infection, erythema and oedema of the lateral nail <b>fold</b> <b>in</b> <b>two</b> different potencies, namely 30 cH in repeated doses and 2 M in a single dose. This study was a six week double-blind, placebo controlled study involving forty participants. Pre-diagnosed onychocryptosis participants were recruited and randomly divided into three groups. The first experimental group received a once-off dose of Magnetis Polus Australis 2 M powder and a 50 ml bottle of placebo liquid. The second experimental group received a once-off placebo powder and a 50 ml bottle of 30 cH Magnetis Polus Australis liquid. The control group received a once-off placebo powder and a 50 ml bottle of placebo liquid. All powders were taken immediately in the presence of the researcher, whereas the 50 ml liquids were taken home to be taken as ten drops under the tongue twice daily for the total six week study. After the initial consultation, there were two more follow-up consultations at three weekly intervals. At each follow-up consultation all symptoms of the condition were observed, namely pain in the big toe (hallux), tenderness to pressure, infection, erythema and oedema of the lateral nail fold, and were recorded in respect of each participant (Appendix D and E). At the end of the clinical trial all the recorded data were analyzed and compared using Fisher Exact Tests (FET) according to the symptoms of onychocryptosis. Results showed no significant difference between the experimental and control group and therefore did not confirm the efficacy of Magnetis Polus Australis as a specific treatment for the symptoms of onychocryptosis. The only finding was that the control had a significant improvement in pain as opposed to the experimental group. A possible explanation is that the experimental groups, especially the 2 M group, demonstrated a homoeopathic aggravation. Further research on this topic is required with a larger sample group over a longer time period...|$|E
