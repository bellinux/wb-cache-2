25|$|In his {{analysis}} of the new art movement, Apollinaire makes a distinction between four different types of Cubism; scientific, physical, orphic and instinctive. The first, Scientific Cubism, <b>is</b> <b>the</b> <b>art</b> of painting new ensembles with elements borrowed not from the reality of vision, but from the reality of knowledge. It is the tendency of 'pure' painting. The painters Apollinaire places in this category are: Picasso, Braque, Metzinger, Gleizes, Laurencin and Gris.|$|E
25|$|Orphic Cubism <b>is</b> <b>the</b> <b>art</b> of {{painting}} with elements borrowed not from visual reality, but entirely {{created by the}} artist and endowed by him with a powerful reality.

All of these devices can be incorporated by the performer. A performer aims to elicit responses of sympathetic feeling in the audience, and to excite, calm or otherwise sway the audience's physical and emotional responses. Musical expression is sometimes thought to be produced {{by a combination of}} other parameters, and sometimes described as a transcendent quality that is {{more than the sum of}} measurable quantities such as pitch or duration.|$|E
25|$|Mosaic <b>is</b> <b>the</b> <b>art</b> {{of decorating}} solid {{surfaces}} {{with pieces of}} multi-coloured stone or glass set in mortar. Golden mosaic can be created by applying gold leaf to a single surface of a transparent glass tile, and placing the gilt inwards towards the mortar {{so that it is}} visible but cannot be scraped. The gilt tiles are often used as a background to figures, giving a glowing and sumptuous effect. Mosaic can be applied equally well to flat or curved surfaces and is often used to decorate vaults and domes. In churches where mosaic is applied extensively, it gives an impression that the interior of the church has been spread with a blanket of pictures and patterns.|$|E
