5|$|The katipo {{typically}} catches wandering ground invertebrates such as beetles (e.g. Cecyropa modesta) or amphipods (e.g. Bellorchestia quoyana), {{but it may}} occasionally catch moths, flies, {{and other}} spiders. Katipo can catch insects much larger than themselves. These larger insects often become entangled in the web and in the ensuing struggle, the web's <b>ground</b> <b>anchor</b> line breaks. Due to the silk's elasticity, this causes the prey to become suspended a few centimetres off the ground. The katipo then moves to the prey, turns so that the spinnerets are facing the insect and spins silk over it. Like most theridiids, the tarsi of the hind legs have a row of strong curved bristles which are arranged as a comb. The katipo uses these to scoop sticky silk from her spinnerets and throws it over the insect {{with a series of}} rapid movements. After the insect is firmly immobilised, she bites it several times, usually at the joints, before spinning more silk to strengthen the web, and then administering a last long bite which ultimately kills the insect. The spider then moves the prey up into the web until it is ready to eat. If food is readily available then it is common to see five or six insects hanging in the web waiting to be ingested. The male's hunting behaviour is similar to the female's, although may not be as vigorous due to its smaller size.|$|E

Soil nail walls require a smaller right-of-way than <b>ground</b> <b>anchor</b> walls and have less environmental impact. Installation of soil nail walls is relatively rapid and typically uses less materials and smaller construction equipment than <b>ground</b> <b>anchor</b> walls.|$|E

50|$|An earth anchor is {{a device}} {{designed}} to support structures, {{most commonly used}} in geotechnical and construction applications.

40|$|Common {{applications}} of earth retaining systems using <b>ground</b> <b>anchors</b> include soldier pile walls with anchors, sheet pile walls with anchors, diaphragm walls with anchors, and secant pile walls with anchors.

(II) Lateral Earth Pressures Consult with Geotechnical Services for suitable lateral earth pressure distribution for the project. For earth retaining systems constructed from the top down and restrained by <b>ground</b> <b>anchors</b> (tiebacks), the lateral earth pressure acting on the wall height, H, may be determined as described below. The lateral earth pressure distribution for the design of temporary or permanent anchored walls constructed in cohesionless soils may be determined using equations provided in AASHTO LRFD BDS (2007). In those special situations where there exists external loading in addition to lateral earth pressure, such as a slip plane or adjacent structures, etc, the following equations based on P may be used to determine p.

50|$|An {{investigation}} {{found that a}} bolt {{in one of the}} stay-chains had snapped at the point where it was attached to the masonry of the <b>ground</b> <b>anchor.</b> There was criticism of the construction method used, as the attachment to the <b>ground</b> <b>anchor</b> relied on one bolt rather than two, and the bolt was found to have been badly forged. A number of other bolts were also bent but had not broken. It emerged that three years previously the distinguished Engineer, Eaton Hodgkinson FRS, had expressed some doubt about the strength of the stay chains compared with that of the suspension chains. He had said that they should be rigorously tested, but they were not. It also came to light that some time before the accident one of the cross bolts had started to bend and crack, although it was believed to have been replaced {{by the time of the}} accident. The conclusion was that, although the vibration caused by the marching had precipitated the bolt's failure, it would have happened anyway.|$|E
40|$|Marquees {{are light}} {{structures}} that {{are connected to}} the <b>ground</b> by tensile <b>anchors</b> to resist forces imposed by wind pressure acting on the structure. The current methods for predicting the ultimate pullout capacity of marquee <b>ground</b> <b>anchors,</b> based on the axial capacity of a single pile, are inaccurate and uncertain. This paper aims to quantify the uncertainty associated with the methods commonly used for pullout capacity prediction of marquee <b>ground</b> <b>anchors.</b> The study is concerned with a variety of <b>ground</b> <b>anchors</b> currently used in the Australian marquee industry. A series of in situ anchor pullout tests were conducted at six different locations in the Adelaide Region, South Australia, and the actual pullout capacity in each test is determined and compared statistically with the corresponding predicted pullout capacity of four methods currently used in practice. A probabilistic approach is used to determine the probability that the predicted pullout load exceeds a certain value utilising any of the methods considered. This approach is useful in that it enables the designer to make informed decisions regarding the level of risk associated with predicted pullout loads and, consequently, increase the safety of marquee structures.

50|$|Bryan Roberts, a {{professor}} of engineering at the University of Technology, in Sydney, Australia, has proposed a helicopter-like craft which flies to 15000 ft altitude and stays there, held aloft by wings that generate lift from the wind, and {{held in place by}} a cable to a <b>ground</b> <b>anchor.</b> According to its designers, while some of the energy in the wind would be 'lost' on lift, the constant and potent winds would allow it to generate constant electricity. Since the winds usually blow horizontally, the turbines would be at an angle from the horizontal, catching winds while still generating lift. Deployment could be done by feeding electricity to the turbines, which would turn them into electric motors, lifting the structure into the sky.|$|E

40|$|Marquees are {{temporary}} light structures that {{are connected to}} the <b>ground</b> by tensile <b>anchors</b> to resist forces imposed by wind acting on the structure. Failures of such structures are not rare and have resulted in deaths {{and tens of thousands of}} dollars of damage. Consequently, an accurate estimation of the ultimate pullout capacity of <b>ground</b> <b>anchors</b> is essential; however, current methods for estimating the ultimate pullout capacity of marquee <b>ground</b> <b>anchors</b> are inaccurate. This is attributed to the fact that the models used by current methods were originally developed to estimate the axial capacity of a single pile rather than small size anchors. The aim of this paper is to develop a more accurate model for predicting the pullout capacity of marquee <b>ground</b> <b>anchors</b> based on the neurofuzzy technique. The type of neurofuzzy networks used are the B-spline networks that are trained with the adaptive spline modelling of observation data (ASMOD) algorithm. A series of 119 in situ anchor pullout tests, conducted at six different locations in the Adelaide Region, South Australia, are used for the neurofuzzy model calibration and validation. Statistical analyses that compare the actual measured pullout capacity with those predicted by the neurofuzzy model and three existing pile capacity prediction methods are conducted and discussed. ...|$|R

The technique is the drilling process monitor (DPM).

It measures and assesses the continuous quality & strength distribution of geomaterials in real time and along the hole. It then upgrades the drilling works to become an in-situ ground investigation technique of choice.
