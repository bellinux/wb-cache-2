5000|$|The five {{remaining}} girls {{learn about}} the four types of men to avoid in relationships: the Player (charismatic), the Professional (wealthy), the Pushover (sensitive), and the Parolee (high sexual aptitude). The one that they should look for is the Urban Renaissance Man, who possesses all four qualities in equal measure. MoNique arranges the Charm School Prom, and invites seven eligible bachelors to the party. The girl who can pick out the one Urban Renaissance Man from the group that consists of Players, Professionals, Pushovers, and Parolees will be safe from elimination.

MoNique and the other Judges, watching this from a monitor, are appalled at what Brooke is doing. Saaphyri gets {{in a fight with}} the Parolee as well over his negative comments about large breasts. Eventually the prom ends and none of the girls choose the Urban Renaissance Man, meaning all the girls are at risk for expulsion. The next day the girls must decide who represented Charm School the best and the worst the previous night. The girl voted the best is safe from expulsion and the girl voted the worst representative is at risk for expulsion. Brooke and Shay plot for Shay to win and ask Leilene to vote for Shay. When the votes are tallied, however, Becky wins best representing Charm School. Brooke was voted the worst for her promiscuous behavior, and Mikki reveals that Leilenes vote against Brooke was the deciding vote. Brooke badly loses her composure and fights with Leilene. The other girls are shocked at Brookes true colors and Leilene joins Becky and Saaphyris alliance. At elimination, Becky is safe from expulsion for voted best representative, and Brooke is called down to the carpet for being voted the worst representative. Leilene and Saaphyri are also called down to the carpet. MoNique first tells Saaphyri that she was wrong for fighting, but wasnt the worst, and she could leave the carpet. Leilene is told that she was only with one guy all night, and it wasnt even the right one and that she could do better, but she could leave the carpet. MoNique then says that Brooke is the [...] "whore" [...] of Charm School, which offends Brooke. MoNique then explains that her behavior was whore-like, and for that reason, Brooke is expelled.
