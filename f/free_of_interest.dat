It is important to make note of the distinction between the Federal Reserve System that governs the Federal Reserve Banks, and the Federal Reserve Banks themselves.|$|E
50|$|When Harpalus escaped {{and fled}} to Crete, the orator faced {{a new wave}} of public uproar.

Demosthenes was fined 50 talents and imprisoned, but after a few days he escaped thanks to the carelessness or connivance of some citizens and travelled around Calauria, Aegina and Troezen. It remains still unclear whether the accusations against him were just or not. In any case, the Athenians soon repealed the sentence and sent a ship to Aegina to carry Demosthenes back to the port of Piraeus.|$|E

However, the issuing authority for them came from different statutes.

It must pay for them in full, dollar for dollar, by drawing down its account with its district Federal Reserve Bank.|$|E
50|$|After {{the failure}} of his farming venture, Pestalozzi wanted to help the poor. He had been poor himself {{most of his life}} and he had {{observed}} orphans who gained apprenticeship as farmers only to be overworked and underfed. He desired to teach them how to live self-respecting lives. This led him to the conception of converting Neuhof into an industrial school. Against the wishes of his wife's family, Pestalozzi gained the support of philosopher Isaak Iselin of Basel, who published it in Die Ephemerides, a periodical devoted to social and economic questions. The publication led to subscriptions and loans <b>free</b> <b>of</b> <b>interest.</b> The new foundation had a short period of apparent prosperity, but after a year Pestalozzi's old faults again led the institution to near ruin. An appeal for public support in 1777 brought much-needed help, and Pestalozzi contributed to the periodical a series of letters on the education of the poor. The appeal, however, only postponed {{the failure of}} the institution. In 1779, Pestalozzi had to close Neuhof. With help from his friends, Pestalozzi was able to save the house at Neuhof for himself and his family to live in. Despite the property being saved, they were in financial ruin and were reduced to poverty. His family connections abandoned him, along with most people who had shown interest in his ideas.|$|E

40|$|Bibliography: pages 84 - 86. Zimbabwe officially {{abandoned}} {{financial repression}} when it introduced financial liberalisation in 1991. Since independence in 1980, {{the government had}} used interest rate controls and strict foreign exchange regulations {{in order to control}} the economy. This mini-dissertation will analyse financial reforms in Zimbabwe from 1991 to 1997. The analysis will consider whether there were statistical grounds to believe that the financial liberalisation hypothesis would work. That is, do real interest rates in Zimbabwe have a statistically significant and positive relationship with real money demand and real savings? This paper will show that in Zimbabwe this relationship does indeed exist. The existence of such a relationship suggests that the <b>freeing</b> <b>of</b> <b>interest</b> rates in 1991 should have raised savings and financial intermediation as the theory predicts. However, as this did not happen, this paper will put forward reasons why, from 1991 to 1997, lifting controls in the economy did not increase savings as expected...|$|R
