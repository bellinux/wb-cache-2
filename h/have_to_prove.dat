5|$|Cats {{who live}} {{outside of the}} Clans are split into three groups. Housecats, known as 'kittypets', are often sneered at by the Clan cats for their cozy and lazy life. Occasionally a curious kittypet will wander into the forest to explore; at this point, they are chased away, but will rarely come to harm. As a result, kittypets often warn each other not to enter the forest. 'Loners' are cats who walk outside of the Clans, usually by themselves. Although {{regarded}} by the Clans with suspicion, they do not cause the forest cats any trouble, and so are free to wander outside of the borders in peace. Similar to loners are 'rogues', who differ only because they intentionally try to cause the Clans harm. It {{is not unusual for}} a rogue to be a former Clan cat looking for revenge. For a kittypet, loner or rogue to join a Clan is rare, but not unheard of. Often, these newcomers <b>have</b> <b>to</b> <b>prove</b> themselves in order to be regarded with trust {{by the rest of the}} community.|$|E
5|$|Symes {{was injured}} during {{pre-season}} but made his second Bournemouth debut {{on the opening}} day of the 2010–11 season against Charlton Athletic as a half-time substitute. Bournemouth lost the game 1–0 but played against ten-men for the last half-hour after defender José Semedo was sent off for a bad tackle on Symes. He was again a substitute for his side's League Cup match before he made his first start the following weekend as Bournemouth defeated Peterborough United 5–1 and a week later he grabbed his first Bournemouth goal with a penalty in a 3–0 win against Tranmere Rovers. However, Symes soon suffered a shoulder injury, which required specialist treatment and kept him out for nearly a month. With Bournemouth's form pushing them towards the top of the league, Symes admitted he would <b>have</b> <b>to</b> <b>prove</b> himself again to manager Eddie Howe. Bournemouth, however, suffered a number of injuries to strikers, and they risked bringing Symes back early. He was brought on as a half-time substitute against Carlisle United and helped lead his side to a 2–0 victory by scoring the second goal. He instantly won a place in Bournemouth's starting team and followed up his goal-scoring performance by netting twice against Exeter City to put Bournemouth second in the table. He soon spent another six weeks on the sidelines because of a shoulder injury before returning in November. His injury problems continued during the winter and he struggled to gain a run of games in the team meaning he did not score again until February at which point he scored in three successive matches.|$|E

25|$|Two months later, {{early in}} 1977, the Court handed down its decision. The justices had {{unanimously}} ruled in Doyle's favor {{on all the}} jurisdictional questions.

25|$|In August 2013, former High Court justice Ian Callinan {{recommended}} 23 more {{changes to}} the Victorian parole system.

25|$|Pfizer was of {{the view}} that it {{deserved}} {{the right to a}} patent on tetracycline and filed its Conover application in October 1952. Cyanamid filed its Boothe-Morton application for similar rights in March 1953, while Heyden Chemicals filed its Minieri application in September 1953, named after scientist P. Paul Minieri, to obtain a patent on tetracycline and its fermentation process. This resulted in tetracycline litigation in which the winner would <b>have</b> <b>to</b> <b>prove</b> beyond reasonable doubt of priority invention and tetracycline’s natural state.|$|E
25|$|Having {{established}} the facts, Gordon {{turned to the}} law. He applied the test from Mt. Healthy City Bd. of Ed. v.

First, Myers would <b>have</b> <b>to</b> <b>prove</b> that her distribution of the questionnaire was constitutionally protected speech, and that her firing was a result. If she could establish that, the burden would then be on Connick to show {{that she would have}} been fired whether she had distributed the questionnaire or not.|$|E

25|$|In the 1980s, the war {{on drugs}} led governments again to turn to money-laundering rules in an attempt to seize {{proceeds}} of drug crimes in order to catch the organizers and individuals running drug empires. It also had the benefit from a law enforcement point of view of turning rules of evidence upside down. Law enforcers normally <b>have</b> <b>to</b> <b>prove</b> an individual is guilty to get a conviction. But with money laundering laws, money can be confiscated and {{it is up to the}} individual to prove that the source of funds is legitimate if they want the funds back. This makes it much easier for law enforcement agencies and provides for much lower burdens of proof.|$|E
25|$|The {{view has}} been taken {{that it may be}} rather {{burdensome}} for the Prosecution to <b>have</b> <b>to</b> <b>prove</b> the alleged contemnor was unaware of any rational basis for the criticism. Furthermore, although the Court did not mention this, since the effect of a statement has to be judged from an average reasonable person's point of view, perhaps the rational basis for the criticism should be apparent to the person in some manner. For example, there could be a requirement that the statement expressly mention the basis, or {{that it is possible to}} imply the basis from the statement. The basis might also be discernible from external sources such as media reports, so long as this is clear to an average reasonable person.|$|E
25|$|In {{response}} to these tactics, the 1920 version of the California Alien Land Law included more stringent rules designed {{to put a stop}} to such circumvention. Among other changes, it introduced a provision that would prove to be crucial in the Oyama case – namely, it stated that if a person purchased land in another person’s name, it would be presumed that this was done with intent to bypass the Alien Land Law. This was a significant shift in the rules regarding burden of proof in state escheat cases involving land. Whereas before the State would <b>have</b> <b>to</b> <b>prove</b> its case, this was no longer the situation – it was now incumbent upon the defendant to prove that the purchased land was a bona fide gift rather than an attempt at getting around the land ownership restrictions.|$|E

25|$|Lèse-majesté {{complaints}} can {{be filed}} by any person against anyone else, {{and they must}} always be formally investigated. Details of the charges are rarely made public. A section 112 defendant always meets with obstructions {{from the beginning to}} the end of a case, especially when asking for a provisional release. There are months-long pretrial detentions, and those who are charged are routinely denied bail, remaining in prison for many months awaiting trial. In most cases, convictions result in harsh sentences. The United Nations Working Group on Arbitrary Detention determined in August 2012 that the pretrial detention of an alleged lèse-majesté offender violated international human rights law. The courts seem not to recognise the principle of granting the benefit of the doubt to defendants. Judges have said that accusers did not <b>have</b> <b>to</b> <b>prove</b> the factuality of the alleged lèse-majesté material, but only to claim it is defaming in any way. Pleading guilty is seen as a move to seek a royal pardon.|$|E
25|$|The {{passing of}} the Land Drainage Act 1930 held promise for the future. The many bodies {{responsible}} for small parts of Somerset's flood defences were swept away, and replaced by the Somerset Catchment Board. More importantly, perhaps, they did not <b>have</b> <b>to</b> <b>prove</b> that benefits would occur to a particular community in order to issue rates for drainage work, but could raise rates based on the rateable values of properties. This should have worked, but they soon became apprehensive, and reverted to producing reports, which were not actioned. However, inactivity gave way to action in 1939, when a new engineer was appointed, who saw it as his job to direct {{what needed to be}} done. Work began on improvements to the King's Sedgemoor Drain in 1939. The items to be addressed were the size of the channel, the size of the bridges, and the size of Dunball clyse, all of which were too small. The onset of the Second World War, just a few months later, threatened to stop the scheme, but did not.|$|E
500|$|Between 25 January and 29 January, Thomas {{was interviewed}} four times {{by members of}} the Australian Federal Police (AFP) and {{by members of the}} Australian Security Intelligence Organisation (ASIO), {{accompanied}} by Pakistani officials.

[...] Thomas was then transferred again, this time to the city of Lahore, where he was kept for another three weeks, and interrogated by Pakistani officials and an American official referred to as [...] "Joe". This man suggested that Thomas return to Afghanistan with a recording device, to obtain information on Al Qaeda figures, a suggestion Thomas rejected because he feared he would be killed. Joe also threatened Thomas that he would be sent to Afghanistan where he would be tortured by having his testicles twisted, and implied that agents would be sent to Australia to rape Thomas' wife. Thomas was then returned to Islamabad.|$|E

500|$|While Frick's {{suggestion}} that a citizenship tribunal before which every German would <b>have</b> <b>to</b> <b>prove</b> {{that they were}} Aryan was not acted upon, proving one's racial heritage became {{a necessary part of}} daily life. Non-government employers were authorised to include in their statutes an Aryan paragraph excluding both Mischlinge and Jews from employment. Proof of Aryan descent was achieved by obtaining an Aryan certificate. One form was to acquire an Ahnenpass, which could be obtained by providing birth or baptismal certificates that all four grandparents were of Aryan descent. The Ahnenpass could also be acquired by citizens of other countries, {{as long as they were}} of [...] "German or related blood".|$|E
500|$|His {{appointment}} to the King's Bench Division allowed him to hear pension appeals, and he attempted to reform the principles applied by the government minister and the Pensions Tribunals. In Starr v Ministry of Pensions [...] 1 KB 345 he ruled that {{it was up to}} the tribunals to prove that an injury was not due to war service, reversing the previous state of affairs where a claimant would <b>have</b> <b>to</b> <b>prove</b> their injuries were due to war service before they would be granted a pension. In James v Minister of Pensions [...] KB 867 he also allowed for judges to approve time extensions for the claimant to gather more evidence when such extensions had been rejected by the Tribunal. These two cases made a large difference to applicants, and he received praise from both the British Legion and the public.|$|E
