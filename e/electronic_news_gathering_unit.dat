2500|$|The {{collision}} {{was investigated}} by the National Transportation Safety Board (NTSB), which concluded that [...] "...the probable cause of this accident was both pilots' failure to see and avoid the other helicopter. Contributing to this failure was the pilots' responsibility to perform reporting and visual tracking duties to support their station's <b>electronic</b> <b>news</b> <b>gathering</b> (ENG) operation. Contributing to the accident {{was the lack of}} formal procedures for Phoenix-area ENG pilots to follow regarding the conduct of these operations." ...|$|R
50|$|In 4:1:1 chroma subsampling, the {{horizontal}} color resolution is quartered, and the bandwidth is halved compared to no chroma subsampling. Initially, 4:1:1 chroma subsampling of the DV format {{was not considered}} to be broadcast quality and was only acceptable for low-end and consumer applications. Currently, DV-based formats (some of which use 4:1:1 chroma subsampling) are used professionally in <b>electronic</b> <b>news</b> <b>gathering</b> and in playout servers. DV has also been sporadically used in feature films and in digital cinematography.|$|R

5000|$|Mix-minus is {{also often}} used {{together}} with IFB systems in <b>electronic</b> <b>news</b> <b>gathering</b> (ENG) for television news reporters and interview subjects {{speaking to a}} host from a remote outside broadcast (OB) location. Because of the delay that is introduced in most means of transmission (including satellite feeds and digital fiber optic connections), the remote subject's voice has {{to be removed from}} his earpiece. Otherwise, the subject would hear himself with a slight (but very distracting) delay.|$|R
5000|$|In TV, live {{television}} remotes are an almost daily part of television news broadcasts in the U.S. As {{a part of}} <b>electronic</b> <b>news</b> <b>gathering</b> (ENG), remotes are meant to bring the audience {{to the scene of}} the action, although often nothing directly related to the story is happening there anymore. In some cases live remotes have even taken ridicule, particularly for reporters who stand out in the middle of a hurricane's winds, risking their lives while telling viewers not to do the same.|$|R
50|$|Although it {{continued}} to nominally be an independent station, in 1988, CFAC-TV began airing some programs from the Global Television Network. In 1989, Maclean-Hunter purchased Selkirk Communications, but due to CRTC ownership regulations at the time (Maclean-Hunter already owned CFCN-TV), CFAC-TV was sold to Western International Communications (WIC). A year after WIC bought channel 2, it changed the call letters to CKKX-TV. In 1992, CKKX’s news operations were expanded with the acquisitions of a satellite uplink truck and a fleet of <b>electronic</b> <b>news</b> <b>gathering</b> microwave trucks.|$|R
50|$|Further {{improvements}} {{were made}} {{with the introduction of}} the SA 365 N1, which had a substantially redesigned Fenestron anti-torque device, and with the SA 365 N2, which was equipped with more powerful Turbomeca Arriel 1C2 turboshaft engines. In January 1990, the overall type was formally redesignated as the AS365. The AS365 Dauphin is one of Eurocopter's more successful helicopter designs; and has been widely used as a corporate transport, airborne law enforcement platform, emergency medical services (EMS) helicopter, <b>electronic</b> <b>news</b> <b>gathering</b> platform, and search & rescue helicopter.|$|R
50|$|Apart {{from the}} more routine {{passenger}} and cargo transportation missions, shipboard helicopter operations are used by civilian and military operators to conduct search and rescue missions, while what for the civilian operators is often <b>electronic</b> <b>news</b> <b>gathering,</b> for the military becomes intelligence gathering missions or battlefield surveillance and reconnaissance. Some helicopters, such as the Kamov Ka-31 airborne early warning helicopter, fulfil specialised roles. The SH-60 Seahawk's roles can include antisubmarine warfare, anti-surface warfare, special forces insertion, combat search and rescue, vertical replenishment and medical evacuation.|$|R
5000|$|Though not {{technically}} a SAP channel, television stations can also broadcast a [...] "PRO" [...] (professional) audio subcarrier {{which is used}} to communicate with station personnel, particularly those engaged in <b>electronic</b> <b>news</b> <b>gathering.</b> This one-way audio channel allows individuals at the television station to send messages to people located away from the station, and is frequently employed during on-location newscasts as the foldback channel to reporters and cameramen. This channel is located at 6.5 times the pilot (102.271 kHz), and is also part of the MTS standard.|$|R
50|$|A {{predecessor}} {{to video}} journalism {{first appeared in}} the 1960s in the USA, when reporters had to write and shoot their own stories. Michael Rosenblum compared the introduction of video cameras to the invention of the portable camera in the 1930s: film spools of plastic made photography independent from heavy plates and tripods, and digital video technology liberates TV from heavy <b>electronic</b> <b>news</b> <b>gathering</b> (ENG) equipment, artificial light and television studios in much the same manner. Video journalism makes it possible for videographers to document any event while it is still occurring.|$|R
