5|$|There are no {{official}} counts or {{estimates of the}} number of active taiko <b>groups</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>United</b> <b>States</b> or Canada, as there is no governing body for taiko groups in either country. Unofficial estimates have been made. In 1989, there were as many as 30 groups in the US and Canada, seven of which were in California. One estimate suggested that around 120 groups were active in the US and Canada as of 2001, many of which could be traced to the San Francisco Taiko Dojo; later estimates in 2005 and 2006 suggested there were about 200 <b>groups</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>United</b> <b>States</b> alone.|$|E

5|$|In 1982, {{the band}} {{released}} {{one of their}} most popular, controversial and acclaimed albums, The Number of the Beast. The artwork and title track led to Christian <b>groups</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>United</b> <b>States</b> branding the band as Satanists, encouraging people to destroy copies of the release. The band's manager, Rod Smallwood, later commented that Christians initially burnt the records, but later decided to destroy them with hammers through fear of breathing in the melting vinyl's fumes. The protests were not restricted to the US, with Christian organisations preventing Iron Maiden from performing in Chile in 1992.|$|E

5|$|From 1970 onward, {{increasing}} numbers of books teaching readers how to become Pagan Witches were published; the earliest was Paul Huson's Mastering Witchcraft (1970), which made no reference to Wicca. This was followed by Raymond Buckland's The Tree: The Complete Book of Saxon Witchcraft, in which he propagated his newly developed tradition of Seax-Wica; utilising Wica as {{the name of the}} tradition, he also referenced the Wicca as the name of the religion as a whole. Contrastingly, during the 1970s the term Wicca was rejected by feminist Pagan Witchcraft <b>groups</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>United</b> <b>States,</b> in particular the Dianic tradition; the term does not appear in the early works of Zsuzsanna Budapest and Starhawk, although the latter would adopt it by the 21st century.|$|E

5|$|In {{the summer}} of 1999, a geopolitical dispute with the global Islamic {{community}} and Jewish <b>groups</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>United</b> <b>States</b> and Israel arose over an Israeli franchisee opening stores in the Israeli-occupied territories. When Burger King franchisee in Israel, Rikamor, Ltd., opened a store in the West Bank settlement of Ma'aleh Adumim in August of that year, Islamic groups, including the Arab League and American Muslims for Jerusalem, argued that international Burger King parent Burger King Corporation's licensing of the store helped legitimize the illegal settlement. Beyond the called-for Islamic boycott of the company, the Arab League also threatened the revocation of the business licenses of Burger King's primary Middle Eastern franchise in the 22 countries {{that are part of}} the League's membership.|$|E
5|$|Fordham College at Rose Hill has a {{long history}} of college theater, as well as non-major theater groups at both Lincoln Center and Rose Hill (the Mimes and Mummers, Fordham Experimental Theater, the Theatrical Outreach Group, Splinter Group). There are also choirs (University Choir, Schola Cantorum, Gloria Dei Choir) and a cappella groups {{spanning}} both campuses (Fordham Ramblers, Satin Dolls, b-Sides, Hot Notes, F-sharps). The Mimes and Mummers, the oldest entirely student-run club at Fordham University and among the oldest college theater <b>groups</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>United</b> <b>States,</b> was founded in 1855 as the Saint John's Dramatic Society. The Mimes put on two musicals, a drama, and a comedy each year – all non-student-written shows – as well as workshops designed to help students at Fordham learn about theater. The club receives from the school a budget which allows the hiring of professional directors, music directors, and choreographers but the shows are student produced, with all elements of technical design run by the club's executive board.|$|E
5|$|The mounted {{police were}} {{established}} to be an armed force, primarily due to the perceived threat from the First Nations on the prairies. The police were initially equipped with the Snider-Enfield Carbine Mark III and the Snider-Enfield Short Rifle, but these were single-shot breechloaders, and inferior to the repeating weapons already being used by Indian <b>groups</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>United</b> <b>States.</b> These were replaced with the Winchester Model 1876 repeating rifle from 1878 onwards, but the new guns proved quite delicate and did not perform effectively during the 1885 rebellion. In 1895, the force began to replace the ageing Winchesters with the Lee-Metford Magazine Carbine, but these weapons did not perform as well as hoped. The program was halted and instead the Lee-Enfield Magazine Rifle Mark I was introduced in 1902 as the standard police small arm. The very limited supplies of ammunition held by the force meant {{that the police had}} few opportunities to practice with their weapons, and as a result their marksmanship was typically quite poor.|$|E
