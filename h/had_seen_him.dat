5|$|John Surratt stood {{trial in}} Washington in 1867. Four {{residents}} of Elmira, New York, claimed they <b>had</b> <b>seen</b> <b>him</b> there between April 13 and 15; fifteen others said they either saw him, {{or someone who}} resembled him, in Washington (or traveling to or from Washington) {{on the day of}} the assassination. The jury could not reach a verdict and John Surratt was released.|$|E
5|$|Wark's final {{full season}} at Portman Road, 1982–83, <b>had</b> <b>seen</b> <b>him</b> record the highest league goals tally of his career. He scored 20 goals in 42 league games, {{though it was}} not enough to prevent Ipswich from {{slipping}} to ninth place in the final table – their lowest position since finishing 18th in 1978.|$|E
5|$|At Boyd's suggestion, the Beatles {{attended}} the Maharishi's lecture at the London Hilton on Park Lane on 24 August 1967. The Maharishi had announced {{his intention to}} retire, so this {{was expected to be}} his last public lecture in the West. Some band members <b>had</b> <b>seen</b> <b>him</b> on a Granada TV program years earlier. The Beatles were given front row seats and were invited to meet the Maharishi in his hotel suite after the lecture. During the ninety-minute meeting, he invited them to be his guests at a training retreat in Wales.|$|E

5|$|Ann Marten {{was called}} to give {{evidence}} {{of the events of}} the day of Maria's disappearance and her later dreams. Thomas Marten then told the court how he had dug up his daughter, and Maria's 10-year-old brother George Marten revealed that he had seen Corder with a loaded pistol before the alleged murder and later <b>had</b> <b>seen</b> <b>him</b> walking from the barn with a pickaxe. Lea gave evidence concerning Corder's arrest and the objects found during the search of his house. The prosecution suggested that Corder had never wanted to marry Maria, but that her knowledge of some of his criminal dealings had given her a hold over him, and that his theft of the money sent by her child's father had been a source of tension between them.|$|E
5|$|Having {{been turned}} down by several {{professional}} clubs, including Newcastle United, Sunderland, Derby County and Southport, Bruce {{was about to start}} work as an apprentice plumber at the Swan Hunter dockyard when he was offered a trial by Third Division club Gillingham, whose manager Gerry Summers <b>had</b> <b>seen</b> <b>him</b> playing for Wallsend in an international youth tournament. He travelled down to Kent with another player from the Wallsend club, Peter Beardsley, but although Gillingham signed Bruce as an apprentice, they turned Beardsley away. At the time Bruce was playing as a midfielder, but he was switched to the centre of defence by the head of Gillingham's youth scheme, Bill Collins, whom Bruce cites as the single biggest influence on his career.|$|E
5|$|On August 7, 1888, {{three days}} after the Lyceum opening of Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde, Martha Tabram was {{discovered}} stabbed to death in London's Whitechapel neighborhood. On August 31 Mary Ann Nichols was found, murdered and mutilated, in the same neighborhood. Press coverage linking these and other Whitechapel murders of women created a furor in London. The public and police suspected that {{some or all of the}} murders were committed by one person, who became known as Jack the Ripper. Some press reports compared the unidentified killer with the Jekyll and Hyde characters, suggesting that the Ripper led a respectable life during the day and became a murderer at night. On October 5, the City of London Police received a letter suggesting that Mansfield should be considered a suspect. The letter writer, who <b>had</b> <b>seen</b> <b>him</b> perform as Jekyll and Hyde, thought that Mansfield could easily disguise himself and commit the murders undetected.|$|E

5|$|On March 8, 2011, former Alice in Chains bassist Mike Starr {{was found}} dead {{at his home in}} Salt Lake City. Police told Reuters they were called to Starr's home at 1:42pm and found his body; Starr was 44. Reports later {{surfaced}} that Starr's roommate <b>had</b> <b>seen</b> <b>him</b> mixing methadone and anxiety medication hours before he {{was found dead}}. Later reports indicated Starr's death may have been linked to two different types of antidepressants prescribed to him by his doctor. A public memorial was held for Starr at the Seattle Center's International Fountain on March 20, 2011. A private memorial was also held, which Jerry Cantrell and Sean Kinney attended according to Mike Inez.|$|E
5|$|Although Smith {{maintained}} his innocence, detectives quickly gathered evidence linking him to Corcoran's death {{and those of}} the other two women. Witnesses <b>had</b> <b>seen</b> <b>him</b> leaving the Rainbow with both Corcoran and Hyde, and he was the last person to see them both alive. CCTV footage from around Birmingham showed his distinctive car visiting key locations linked to the investigation, and even captured Hyde getting out at one point to visit a chemist. Smith was seen buying petrol from a filling station and driving near the area where Hyde's body was later discovered. Corcoran was seen on camera struggling with Smith outside Monte Carlo's. CCTV footage showed him driving around Bromsgrove, a town close to Droitwich, after killing Corcoran, and later film showed him returning to Birmingham. At least two witnesses recalled seeing Smith with blood on him: a motorist who saw him buying petrol, and another who spoke with Smith about his appearance. Smith told the latter that he had been in a fight, although he had no visible signs of injury.|$|E
5|$|For {{the next}} two seasons, after Sheffield Wednesday signed an influx of foreign players such as Paolo Di Canio and Benito Carbone, Humphreys failed to hold down a regular place and he only played a total of 31 matches in those two seasons. Humphreys was sent on loan to Scunthorpe United on 13 August 1999, where he played six matches and again scored twice. He was then sent on loan to Cardiff City where he played 11 matches, scoring twice. After a brief return to the Wednesday team for the 2000–01 season, Humphreys decided to leave Wednesday to play more first team {{football}} was allowed to join Cambridge United on trial. Humphreys impressed on trial, scoring 3 goals in 7 appearances, and it looked likely that Cambridge manager Roy McFarland was going to offer him a contract. However, Humphreys' trial was cut abruptly after he broke his foot. After the sacking of Roy McFarland, new Cambridge manager John Beck was reluctant to offer Humphreys a new contract until he <b>had</b> <b>seen</b> <b>him</b> play.|$|E

5|$|In 1982, Morrissey {{auditioned for}} One Summer, a {{television}} series by Willy Russell for Yorkshire Television and Channel 4 about two Liverpool boys who run away to Wales one summer. Russell had been {{attached to the}} Everyman for many years, and Morrissey <b>had</b> <b>seen</b> <b>him</b> while he was working behind the bar downstairs from the theatre, though the two had never been introduced. Morrissey went to at least eight auditions, and in one read for the part of Icky opposite Paul McGann, who was reading for Billy. McGann, five years older than Morrissey, believed {{that he was too}} old to be playing the part of 16-year-old Billy, and stepped back from the production, leaving the role to go to Morrissey. Spencer Leigh got the part of Icky and Ian Hart played the supporting role of Rabbit. Russell had a professional disagreement with the director Gordon Flemyng and producer Keith Richardson over the casting of 18-year-old Morrissey and Leigh; he believed that the sympathy of 16-year-olds running away was lost by casting older actors. Russell subsequently had his name removed from the credits of the original broadcast. After filming One Summer for five months, Morrissey went travelling in Kenya with his cousins. When he returned to Britain, One Summer was being broadcast, and he dealt with the new experience of being recognised in public.|$|E
5|$|Manchester United's {{starting}} right-winger {{from the}} 2008 final, Owen Hargreaves, missed the match {{as he was}} still in rehabilitation after a double knee operation to cure his tendinitis problems that <b>had</b> <b>seen</b> <b>him</b> play little part in the 2008–09 Champions League campaign. It had been expected that defender Wes Brown would also miss the match after suffering a recurrence of a foot injury, but he returned to training quicker than expected and was involved in United's match against Hull City on 24 May, although he picked up a slight knock during the game. Rio Ferdinand was also a doubt following a calf injury that has kept him out of the United side since the semi-final second leg against Arsenal; Alex Ferguson had said that Ferdinand might not start in Rome if he was not fit to play against Hull, but he later admitted that Ferdinand was on course to recover in time to play in the match. Second-choice goalkeeper Ben Foster also missed the match after requiring surgery to repair a ruptured ligament in his right thumb in May 2009. On the other hand, following John O'Shea's winning goal in Manchester United's semi-final first leg victory over Arsenal, United manager Alex Ferguson suggested that the Irish utility player would be guaranteed a place in the starting line-up were United to reach the final. O'Shea's place in the team was confirmed at Manchester United's media day the week before the final. South Korean midfielder Park Ji-sung was also promised a place in the team after he missed the 2008 final, finally making him the first Asian to appear in a European Cup final. Cristiano Ronaldo suffered a slight injury scare in training the night before the final, requiring a bandage on his lower right leg, but he was eventually fit enough to play in the match.|$|E

25|$|Bujor {{remained}} on the editorial staff until April 1907, when Stere objected to his ideological vacillation—a dispute between them was aired in the daily Opinia, and Ioan Cantacuzino took his place. For his part, Bujor, who now shunned the PNL, depicted Viața Românească as a National Liberal mouthpiece.

They started a private search but failed to find any trace of him. The police were finally notified on September 3 and, after that, the missing judge was front-page news.|$|E

Thomas Taylor the engraver in the major coining conspiracy. Catherine Carter, wife of Thomas Carter who had twice previously been named and blamed by Chaloner, testified to Chaloner's skill as a forger and {{his role in the}} lottery scam.|$|E
25|$|Zelko {{was subject}} to intense g-forces as the {{aircraft}} tumbled and had great difficulty in assuming the correct posture for ejecting. After his parachute deployed, he used his survival radio to issue a mayday call {{and was able to}} contact the KC-135 that <b>had</b> <b>seen</b> <b>him</b> shot down. Zelko used his survival radio while still descending although this was contrary to his training. He reasoned the altitude would give his signal the best possible range and was also sure he would be quickly taken prisoner by Yugoslavian forces on the ground and wanted to confirm he was unhurt before this happened.|$|E
25|$|Bryks landed {{safely and}} started to bury his parachute.

Bryks hid in a barn until nightfall, then went to the hamlet where he asked at a house for a doctor to treat his burns. The occupants betrayed him by calling the Germans, but when Bryks heard their motorised patrol coming he fled the house and hid in a garden. The patrol caught him, beat him up and took him to St Omer.|$|E
