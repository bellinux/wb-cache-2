PATIENTS AND METHODS: Fifty-fiveBrazilian systemic lupus erythematosus children and adolescents and 308 healthy individuals were studied. Gender, race, and age of onset of systemic lupus erythematosus were recorded. The <b>human</b> <b>leukocyte</b> <b>antigens</b> typing of class II-DR was carried out by polymerase chain reaction amplification with sequence-specific primers (PCR-SSP). Data were analyzed statistically using the chi square test with Yates' correction, Fisher's exact test, and Bonferroni's correction. RESULTS: <b>Human</b> <b>leukocyte</b> antigen-DR 15 was the most frequently detected antigen in this group of children and adolescents, and it also occurred more frequently in the female group, in children with onset of systemic lupus erythematosus between 0 and 9 years and between 10 to 14 years, and in the Black race group, but these associations were not statistically significants.

METHODS: Forty-seven bcr-abl positive individuals were evaluated. Typing was performed bymicrolymphocytotoxicity and molecular biological methods (<b>human</b> <b>leukocyte</b> <b>antigens</b> Class I and Class II). A control group {{was obtained from the}} data of potential bone marrow donors registered in the Brazilian Bone Marrow Donor Registry (REDOME). RESULTS: Positive associations with HLA-A 25 and HLA-B 18 were found for the b 2 a 2 transcript, as well as a tendency towards a positive association with HLA-B 40 and a negative association with HLA-A 68. The b 3 a 2 transcript showed positive associations with HLA-B 40 and HLA-DRB 1 * 3. CONCLUSION: The negative association between <b>human</b> <b>leukocyte</b> <b>antigens</b> and the BCR-ABL transcript suggests that binding and presentation of peptides derived from the chimeric protein are effective to increase a cytotoxic T lymphocyte response appropriate for the destruction of leukemic cells...|$|R

40|$|AbstractObjective: A {{retrospective}} {{analysis was performed}} to examine the role of HLA antibodies and cytomegalovirus mismatch {{on the development of}} bronchiolitis obliterans syndrome and survival after lung transplantation. Methods: Of 339 consecutive lung transplantations performed over a 102 -month interval, 301 patients survived at least 3 months. There was a minimum follow-up period of 13 months. Bronchiolitis obliterans syndrome was defined as a decline in forced expiratory volume in 1 second less than 80 % of posttransplantation baseline and/or histologic presence of obliterative bronchiolitis and was defined as occurring “early” if documented within 3 years of transplantation. Variables analyzed included preoperative donor and recipient cytomegalovirus status and the development of antibodies to <b>human</b> <b>leukocyte</b> <b>antigens</b> after transplantation. Microcytotoxicity was used to determine the presence of antibodies to <b>human</b> <b>leukocyte</b> <b>antigens.</b> Variables were subjected to Kaplan-Meier analysis to determine their impact on freedom from bronchiolitis obliterans syndrome and survival. Results: The development of antibodies to <b>human</b> <b>leukocyte</b> <b>antigens</b> after transplantation correlated significantly with bronchiolitis obliterans syndrome (P =. 02). The development of antibodies to <b>human</b> <b>leukocyte</b> <b>antigens</b> did not affect survival (P =. 33) unless they were detected within 2 years of transplantation (P =. 04). There was greater frequency of early bronchiolitis obliterans syndrome in cytomegalovirus seronegative patients who received allografts from seropositive donors compared with all other combinations (P =. 02). There was also a trend toward worse survival of cytomegalovirus seronegative patients who received allografts from seropositive donors (P =. 13). Conclusion: These data suggest that bronchiolitis obliterans syndrome is the result of an immune-mediated process in which HLA antibodies and cytomegalovirus may play a significant role.

25|$|The {{immunochemistry}} of Triticeae glutens {{is important}} in several inflammatory diseases.

The response is also dependent on the genetic makeup of the <b>human</b> <b>leukocyte</b> <b>antigen</b> genes. In gluten sensitive enteropathy, there are 4 types of recognition, innate immunity (a form of cellular immunity priming), HLA-DQ, and antibody recognition of gliadin and transglutaminase.
