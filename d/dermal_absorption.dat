25|$|According to the Agency for Toxic Substances and Disease Registry (ATSDR) (2007), benzene {{is both an}} anthropogenically {{produced}} and naturally occurring chemical from processes that include: volcanic eruptions, wild fires, synthesis of chemicals such as phenol, production of synthetic fibers, and fabrication of rubbers, lubricants, pesticides, medications, and dyes. The major sources of benzene exposure are tobacco smoke, automobile service stations, exhaust from motor vehicles, and industrial emissions; however, ingestion and <b>dermal</b> <b>absorption</b> of benzene can also occur through contact with contaminated water. Benzene is hepatically metabolized and excreted in the urine. Measurement of air and water levels of benzene is accomplished through collection via activated charcoal tubes, which are then analyzed with a gas chromatograph. The measurement of benzene in humans can be accomplished via urine, blood, and breath tests; however, all of these have their limitations because benzene is rapidly metabolized in the human body.|$|E

Furthermore, some studies suggest that <b>dermal</b> <b>absorption</b> may contribute some small fraction to the overall human exposure. European data indicate that the use of BPA in paper may also contribute to the presence of BPA in the stream of recycled paper and in landfills. Although there are no estimates for the amount of BPA used in thermal paper in the United States, in Western Europe, the volume of BPA reported to be used in thermal paper in 2005/2006 was 1,890 tonnes per year, while total production was estimated at 1,150,000 tonnes per year.

40|$|In risk {{assessments}} of soil bounded pollutants, the bioaccessibility {{is defined as}} the amount of solid-solubilized phase transition fraction of pollutants, which is actual available for oral, pulmonary and <b>dermal</b> uptake (<b>absorption)</b> by human. The bioaccessibility does not express the bioavailability of pollutants, thus, the effect on organism by uptake of pollutants. However, the bioaccessibility is an excellent benchmark for the potential bioavailable amount of pollutants in soils, because more than the bioaccessible fraction cause no effects on organism function. The results enhanced the knowledge about in-vitro extraction tests to determine the bioaccessibility of soil bounded pollutants for oral, pulmonary and dermal uptake. The applicability and validity of the approaches will be discussed for selected inorganic and organic pollutants. New applicable knowledge for the pulmonary and dermal exposition pathway in soil protection is summarized. The conclusion is that a risk assessment on basis of total content of pollutants in soil samples overestimate mostly the actual human health risk. The approved and practice-oriented in-vitro method DIN 19738 : 2004 - 07 for estimating the oral bioaccessibility exhibits a good ruggedness and validity particular for the priority metals As, Pb, and Cd in soils. The use of the DIN-method is recommended for application in the triggering further investigations according the Federal Soil Protection Ordinance in Germany. More research studies are needed for an essential assessment of validity regarding the priority organic compounds. First reasonable results in estimating of pulmonary bioaccessibility was achieved by a promising, however, non standardized in-vitro method for selected metals (Pb, Cr, and Ni).

Extensive <b>absorption</b> (at least 92% of the administered oral dose) of o-toluidine from the gastrointestinal tract was observed. Studies show that the absorption of o-toluidine from the gastrointestinal tract in rats is rapid with peak values at 1 hour; the blood values were near zero in 24 hours. It is expected of aromatic amines, like o-toluidine, to be absorbable through the skin due to their lipid solubility. 48 hours following subcutaneous injection of labeled o-toluidine hydrochloride into rats, detected radioactivity in decreasing range: liver > kidney > spleen, colon > lung, bladder. In another study, 72 hours after oral application to rats, radioactivity was detected in decreasing range: blood > spleen > kidney > liver > subcutaneous abdominal fat > lung > heart > abdominal skin > bladder > gastrointestinal tract > bone marrow > brain > muscle > testes. The main excretion pathway is through the urine where up to one-third of the administered compound was recovered unchanged. Major metabolites were determined to be 4-amino-m-cresol and to a lesser extent, N-acetyl-4-amino-m-cresol, azoxytoluene, o-nitrosotoluene, N-acetyl-o-toluidine, N-acetyl-o-aminobenzyl alcohol, anthranilic acid, N-acetyl-anthranilic acid, 2-amino-m-cresol, p-hydroxy-o-toluidine and other unidentified substances.

40|$|Abstract Background Despite the {{increasing}} promotion of alcohol-based hand rubs and the worldwide use of ethanol-based hand rubs in hospitals only {{few studies have}} specifically {{addressed the issue of}} ethanol absorption when repeatedly applied to human skin. The aim {{of this study was to}} assess if ethanol absorption occurs during hygienic and surgical hand disinfection using three different alcohol-based hand-rubs, and to quantify absorption levels in humans. Methods Twelve volunteers applied three hand-rubs containing 95 % (hand-rub A), 85 % (hand-rub B) and 55 % ethanol (hand-rub C; all w/w). For hygienic hand disinfection, 4 mL were applied 20 times for 30 s, with 1 minute break between applications. For surgical hand disinfection, 20 mL of each hand rub was applied to hands and arms up to the level of the elbow 10 times for 3 minutes, with a break of 5 minutes between applications. Blood concentrations of ethanol and acetaldehyde were determined immediately prior and up to 90 minutes after application using head space gas chromatography. Results The median of absorbed ethanol after hygienic hand disinfection was 1365 mg (A), 630 mg (B), and 358 mg (C). The proportion of absorbed ethanol was 2. 3 % (A), 1. 1 % (B), and 0. 9 % (C). After surgical hand disinfection, the median of absorbed ethanol was 1067 mg (A), 1542 mg (B), and 477 mg (C). The proportion of absorbed ethanol was 0. 7 % (A), 1. 1 % (B), and 0. 5 % (C). The highest median acetaldehyde concentration after 20 hygienic hand disinfections was 0. 57 mg/L (hand-rub C, after 30 min), after 10 surgical hand disinfections 3. 99 mg/L (hand-rub A, after 20 minutes). Conclusion The overall <b>dermal</b> and pulmonary <b>absorption</b> of ethanol was below toxic levels in humans and allows the conclusion that the use of the evaluated ethanol-based hand-rubs is safe. </p...|$|R
40|$|This Streamlined Approach for Environmental Restoration (SAFER) Plan {{addresses}} the actions {{necessary for the}} characterization and closure of Corrective Action Unit (CAU) 356, Mud Pits and Disposal Sites, as identified in the Federal Facility Agreement and Consent Order (FFACO). The CAU, located on the Nevada Test Site in Nevada, consists of seven Corrective Action Sites (CASs) : CAS 03 - 04 - 01, Area 3 Change House Septic System; CAS 03 - 09 - 01, Mud Pit Spill Over; CAS 03 - 09 - 03, Mud Pit; CAS 03 - 09 - 04, Mud Pit; CAS 03 - 09 - 05, Mud Pit; CAS 20 - 16 - 01, Landfill; CAS 20 - 22 - 21, Drums. Sufficient information and process knowledge from historical documentation and investigations are {{the basis for the}} development of the phased approach chosen to address the data collection activities prior to implementing the preferred closure alternative for each CAS. The Phase I investigation will determine through collection of environmental samples from targeted populations (i. e., mud/soil cuttings above textural discontinuity) if contaminants of potential concern (COPCs) are present in concentrations exceeding preliminary action levels (PALs) at each of the CASs. If COPCs are present above PALs, a Phase II investigation will be implemented to determine the extent of contamination to support the appropriate corrective action alternative to complete closure of the site. Groundwater impacts from potentially migrating contaminants are not expected due to the depths to groundwater and limiting hydrologic drivers of low precipitation and high evaporation rates. Future land-use scenarios limit future uses to industrial activities; therefore, future residential uses are not considered. Potential exposure routes to site workers from contaminants of concern in septage and soils include oral ingestion, inhalation, or <b>dermal</b> contact (<b>absorption)</b> through in-advertent disturbance of contaminated structures and/or soils. Diesel within drilling muds is expected to be the primary COPC based on process knowledge. Recirculation processes within the mud pits enhance volatilization of volatile organic compounds (VOCs), thereby reducing the potential concentrations of any VOCs that may be present. A secondary source of contaminants from random truck dumping activities and leaking vehicle discharge may have released fuels, grease, motor oil, and hydraulic fluids into the mud pit effluent stream. Radionuclide contamination is not expected at these CASs based on historical information. The primary radioisotopes that could be expected, if present, are cesium- 137, tritium, and strontium- 90. The SAFER process ends with closure of the site based on the laboratory analytical results of the environmental samples. There is sufficient information and process knowledge from historical documentation regarding the expected nature and extent of potential contaminants to recommend closure of CAU 356 using the SAFER process. On completion of the field activities, a Closure Report will be prepared and submitted to the Nevada Division of Environmental Protection for review and approval...|$|R

Drinking water from water supplies contaminated by nitrate from fertilizer runoff, animal waste, and/or nitrate-containing substances at waste disposal sites may result in overexposure to nitrate. Release of nitrate and/or nitrite to soil from fertilizer runoff, animal waste, and/or waste disposal sites could result in increased uptake by plants used for human consumption. Occupational Populations Workers who are employed in occupations where fertilizer use is common (e. g., farming, greenhouse operations) may be exposed to nitrate and nitrite through dermal routes and inhalation of dust particles. Toxicokinetics There is no information regarding the toxicokinetics of nitrate or nitrite following inhalation or <b>dermal</b> exposure. Gastrointestinal <b>absorption</b> of nitrate and nitrite occurs after drinking water or eating food that contain these compounds. Some of the nitrate in your body moves from blood to the salivary glands where some of it is changed to nitrite. Both nitrate and nitrite can be produced inside the body. Nitrate and nitrite are widely distributed in the body. Most of the nitrate that you take into your body each day leaves in the urine the same day it enters your body. Some nitrite in the stomach forms other substances called nitrosamines, some of which may be harmful. Normal Human Levels National surveys of the U. S. general population conducted in 2005 - 2008 showed that the geometric mean level of nitrate in urine of nearly 18, 000 participants was 42. 7 or 46. 3 mg/L.
